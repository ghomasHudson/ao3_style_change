"You have my word as a Malfoy I will keep your secret as I am still in debt to you for saving my life. Thank you for that and for what you did for my mother and me with the trails. Does these secret accommodations have anything to do with the girl's bathroom on the second floor?"
He was finally happy. Andromeda had accompanied him to a muggle doctor to fix his eyes and then spent the next week with him and Teddy to make sure he was okay. They were the only ones who he had kept contact with in the wizarding world. He wrote his friends every few weeks but he couldn t bring himself to meet up with them. Death Eaters were still on the loose so Shacklebolt against his wishes assigned a few Aurors to keep tabs on him until the remainder could be apprehended.
"You re a what?" Ginny yelled it was the first time she made her presence verbally known. She had been trying to put her hand on his leg all night and he kept brushing it off only to find it on his leg again minutes later.
He couldn't look up from the book and a slight trembling had begun to form in his hands as he turned to the next mark section.
"Harry, MALFOY. It may not be Slytherin of me but I would at least like us to all be civil and I promised a certain Professor to look after his snakes this year since he could not."
"You should know Harry that Ron and I are no longer together. I do love him but he refuses to grow up. He told everyone about how you grew up and then continued to bad mouth you to the rest of the Gryffindors. Ginny was so mad that she ran off to owl their mother. The rest of the dorm were so mad that even Neville refused to sleep in the same room as him so he kicked him out and Ron slept on the couch because I refused to let him sleep in my room. He yelled at me and told me that I was stupid to believe all the things the founders said about you and that you were just some disgusting dirty freak and should be put into Azkaban for all the deaths you caused because you didn't defeat Voldemort sooner. That was my last straw so I broke up with him." At hearing this Harry turned his large head and nuzzled his nose into Hermione's hair. They sat in silence for a while until a pop startled them.
"Harry I am not like Weasley." He said as he walked over to Harry. "I admire you for coming out to your so called friends. It took me two years to come out to mine, and it took fifteen seconds for Pansy to say about time. So I cant judge you because I would be judging myself." He said as he stood in front of Harry and looked into his eyes.
"Well I am sorry but I got sick of you ignoring me." At that point Headmistress McGonagall entered the classroom.
"Hey Teddy, missed you." He watched as Harry held his precious bundle to his chest. He looked over the boy and watched in amazement as the blue hair slowly grew and turned to match Harry's. "Hey little man I want you to met someone."
"Well it looks like you can enter but they have two conditions. You always have to enter with me and I can't leave you down here by yourself yet." Harry said as they passed through the guarded door into the common room where he was introduced to Salazar Slytherin's portrait.
"Sorry I couldn't resist. At least its clean now, the first time it was all dirty and this place was filled with bones of all sorts of small animals. Dobby helped me clean it up since I helped free him and he felt guilty for almost killing me."
"My apologies Professor, I had a meeting with the Headmistress this morning and it ran a bit over. He said as he went to the front of the classroom to hand her a note."
He found his way into Harry's study he did not think anything of it as he looked around. He noticed the snitch that floated in the air and the shelf with Harry's fathers' journals on it. He studied the shimmering cloak that hung on a peg next to the fireplace. When he took it off to wrap it around his body because it smelt like Harry he noticed that he disappeared. He then noticed a wand box on the mantle and went to investigate. He tried to pick it up but it wouldn't move, he even tried to open the lid but it was sealed shut. He went to reach for his wand but was stopped by a voice.
Harry landed in the common room of Salazar s chambers. The founder himself could been seen asleep in his portrait so Harry slipped pass to enter the study. He took the Elder Wand that he had been carrying with him since the war out of a holster that was on his calf and placed it in a box sitting on the mantle above the ornate fireplace. He had placed a fake one in Dumbledore s grave without anyone being the wiser and kept the real one with him. He figured since now that it was part of his ancestry it belonged with him and no place was safer than the Chambers. He had hung his invisibility cloak up next to the mantle in its place. . He was planning on going to the clearing in the Forbidden Forest tomorrow during a free period to retrieve the Resurrection Stone and place it with the Wand as well, then the three Hollows would be together again and in a place he deemed safe from the outer world. He took a seat in the chair behind the desk to gather his thoughts before retiring to bed. Tomorrow was going to be a day to truly test his friendships and his temper he presumed. He missed his friends but he could no longer deny who he was. He was sick of playing the role of the savior and one of placating his friends. Over the years Severus and Salazar s training and tutoring had made him very knowledgeable in many of the subjects that he played fool in. This past summer he took the O.W.L.S for Arithmancy and then owled Professor Vector and completed all of the required sixth year exams receiving top marks and would be joining her NEWT class this year, he even took the O.W.L.S. for Ancient Runes and passed with an "O".
About a month before September he received a letter from Hogwarts requesting if he would like to return to Hogwarts to finish his seventh year schooling as an eight year student. He decided that he would have to have a talk with the new Headmistress before he could give her an answer.
before he entered. What he saw almost took his breath away. Their standing in front of him was a tall
"Well she seems rather sweet to me." He said as he stroked Nisha s scales and she rubbed her tiny head against his chin.
When he had entered the Great Hall for the welcoming feast he saw the golden trio minus the one he was searching for. He noted the absence of many of the Slytherins only two besides himself had returned, Pansy Parkinson and Millicent Bulstrode. He listen intently to the speech Headmistress McGonagall gave about the new teachers and the announcement of the eighth year tower that would house all returning eighth year students and that each student would have a single roommate from their house to reside with for the year. This announcement meant Draco would have a room to himself as the only returning male Slytherin. She then went on to announce that their head of house would be Professor Vector and that they would be given some special privileges that year that would be handed out with their time tables later. It was after her speech that the first years came in to be sorted and the sorting hat sang his song about school unity and even encouraged the traits found in every house. Draco was proud to see many first years entering into Slytherin. When the last student was sorted and Professor Sprout was placing the Sorting Hat on the chair to be returned to the Headmistress office a bright light emanate from the hat and the Great hall fell to silence.
"SLYTHERIN", the hat called out and it was seconds later that the Great Hall was in an uproar. The Slytherin table was seated in a shocked silence as they watched the boy once known as Harry Potter join their ranks. Hufflepuff were busy gossiping loudly and Ravenclaw were looking into the rule books about the sorting of students while the Gryffindors were yelling and saying that the hat made a mistake. Draco didn t watch Harry coming over to the table instead he had turned his gaze to the end of the Gryffindor table and watched as Granger was trying to calm down a very red Weasley and Weaselette. So he was taken by surprise when he felt someone sit next to him.
He watched as Draco crawled under the thick comforter on the bed. It was always slightly cooler in his room and he was glad for the thick comforter and cashmere blankets on the bed. He usually had a fire lit in the fireplace but he preferred to let it go out as he slept. Draco held the comforter a loft waiting for him to join him on the bed and when he did he felt the other boy curl on his side and wrap an arm around his waist to pull him in closer. He did not have a nightmare that night which was a blessing for him. He had been haunted by nightmares for months now and it was rare for him to go a night without them.
"Sorry. Mom why don't you go back and let Severus talk to his snakes. I will meet up with you in a bit."
"Mister Weasley you will watch your mouth or you will have detention tonight with me." Headmistress McGonagall yelled out to Ron's comments. Harry watched as Ron crossed his arms over his chest and glared at Draco.
"This repugnant imbecile was teaching first years cutting hexes on a living snake," he said as he pointed to the terrarium. "I could hear his screams all the way in the Great Hall were Andy was going over the things she required we have for our classes starting next week, she will send you the list. Harry he is in so much pain he wasn't conjured, he is alive, and in pain I can feel it. We have to help him Harry please?"
He didn't know what to say to that so he just ran his hand done her smooth scales noticing that they felt like silk. He continued to ponder the new information that he had received as Harry wandered out of the bathroom dressed in his school robes. He rose from the bed with Nisha securely wrapped around his arm to the outstretched arms of Harry.
"Brilliant. Now Lily Evans I would like to introduce you to Severus Snape, Potions Master. Severus if you would please pretend to be a Gryffindor for a moment I feel you would lose some of your gloom. With that said I shall leave the two of you, I have classes tomorrow." Harry turned and left to go to his bedroom. He could hear Lily behind him call Severus s name and he took a quick peek behind him and saw that she had invaded his portrait and was in the mist of giving him a piece of her mind and Severus was cowering in the corner. He hoped they would be happy, they deserved it.
"Somewhat I could go get it and read it in here. The magic this afternoon took a lot out of you and you need to rest. I will watch over you I promise." He kissed Harry on the lips and rose from the bed to retrieve the book he had left in the library.
"You were having a nightmare." He said calmly while running circles with his hand on Harry's back trying to soothe his nerves. "Do you want to talk about it?"
"Lets see you have been obsessed with boy wonder since first year and you came out to us during fourth year. Come on the only reason you dated me was to please your father and now you don't have to. So are you going to tell him that you're gay and that you like him too, because it is obvious that he likes you. He has been looking at you in all of our classes and he was subtly flirting with you as well."
"Now Salazar he is not only your heir but mine as well as you know. Gryffindors may be able to call the sword in great need but he has always been able to call it forth at will since it is rightfully his." Godric said as he looked at a stunned crowd of students and teachers.
"I am not Potter, why do you insist on calling me Draco. We have never been that informal before and its not as if we are friends Potter."
He waited patiently in their room for Draco to be done talking to Lady Ravenclaw. He knew that the information he got from her would be just for him unless Draco wanted to share it. Their familiars were currently entwined together on their bed. He must have dozed off because he awoke to a warm body curling up next to him and a head full of blonde hair pressing a kiss to his chest then settling down.
"I'm sorry my dear you can't take this class." He heard her whisper to the student as she stepped out of the circle received her wand back and went to sit near the back of the room until the rest were tested.
Harry watched as his two ancestors stood in front of him, he could feel Draco shift him so he was leaning against him. "I thought you said that you couldn't take any form?" he asked Salazar.
"Why are you rooming with the enemy and why the hell did you get resorted Harry. You re a Gryffindor not a bloody snake!" Ron yelled as he slammed his fist down onto the table.
"Sorry Professor, but she is still much too young for that she is only a few months old and I feel it would upset her." And with a wave of his hand Draco watched as Nisha vanished from her spot around Harry s neck. "Sorry she wanted to return to our rooms she was getting a chill and the fumes were upsetting her Professor." Draco couldn't believe it he had just witness Harry preform wordless and wandless magic as if it were nothing and then return back to his potion as a dismissed and stunned Professor walked around the class to inspect the rest of the students potions. They continued to work in silence and every now and then Harry would give him a tip on his potion which Draco noted. His potion was coming along a lot faster than it had before and it was perfect thanks to this new Slytherin at his side.
"No, I will take it. I feel that we will have to reschedule our lunch my friend, there are things I need to discuss with Luna, Harry." Viktor had finally found his voice as he came out of the shock Luna had put him in.
"Now there is one more to be sorted this night. One who has found out the truth and knows who he truly is, Mr. Harrison Corvus Black," the old hat said.
Before Draco could reply the McGonagall had called for silence and told the school that the Sorting Hat s decree was absolute and that the feast was to begin. They ate in silence and when the feast was over and start of term announcement were made they were dismissed to their common rooms.
“One more thing lil dragon heir, my door shall be open to you and Harry now it will lead you to my room in
already it was currently yelling at Headmistress McGonagall. The students were gossiping so loud you
"Well I guess they will no longer be your students. By the power of the Founders bestowed upon me banish you from the Castle." With a crack the Professor was expelled from Hogwarts perimeters. "Kreacher would please pack that man's things and send them to the gates.
"I know Salazar, sorry my dear lady. I am Godric Gryffindor and this is my longtime friend Salazar Slytherin. You may address us as Lord Gryffindor and Lord Slytherin. We have come to formally claim our Heir."
He heard a small green snake say. He walked carefully over to it trying to avoid the many tails in his way. It was exactly how heremembered it down to the crack through its surface. He quickly reached down and picked up the stone. He then placed it into his robe pockets and thanked the various snakes that had remained. When he felt Nisha crawl up his body to rest around his shoulders he used Salazar s ring to return him to his rooms. He had about a ten minutes before Herbology started so he quickly placed the stone in the box next to the Elder Wand then ran for the exit.
"As always I serve the most noble house of Black." The elf said as he bowed, he then turned and Harry watched as he glared at the room s newest occupants as he exited the room.
He moved his hand to tangle in Harry's hair while the other caressed its way down to his waist. He heard him moan as he pulled away to get a breathe of air then he continued to lay kisses along his jaw and down his neck. Harry's hands were caressing Draco's back and he could feel them slowly lowering down to his arse when they were interrupted by a knock on the door.
"Well I am not sure of my dinner plans yet but I should be free no later than seven o'clock. If you want the girls could come over then and we could ..."He was cut off when a hand grabbed his shoulder and roughly turned him around.
"I heard you were a tiger Mister Potter but no other information was given about your transformation. You are quite impressive I have never seen one so large or have I ever seen one with your coloring. You may return to your seat."
"As much as I am a Slytherin and that snakes are our mascot, I do not like extremely large poisonous snakes rubbing up on me. Got it Harry." Draco said as he sat next down to him in Transfigurations which was the last class of the day.
"You disgust me. How could you torture an innocent creature, what did it ever do to you? What were you thinking teaching cutting hexes to first years?"
When the train arrived he waited until everyone had left and boarded the last carriage under his invisibility cloak. He entered the Great Hall and took in the familiar sights. He saw Draco gazing around the Great Hall looking for someone and caught Luna absently dancing to her seat. He noticed Neville had more confidence this year and had sat across from Dean and Seamus. His eyes finally fell on to his friends. From his point of view he could see Hermione trying to calm down a distressed Ron by rubbing circles on his hand while she sat next to him and Ginny looking around the room in search of someone while Dean kept placing his hand on her thigh. HE watched as she would get nervous every time someone entered the Great Hall and brush his hand of before allowing it to return. He couldn t help but laugh at this because he had heard many rumors about her last year from Neville and Luna and for a time he had hoped they were untrue. Now he was comfortable with who he really was and as the first years entered to be sorted he slipped back into the shadows and removed his cloak to wait for for his life to truly begin.
"Thank you Kreacher, would you bring up the new painting to the Slytherin hall in the tower. Then you are free to go to our rooms if you would like."
They were interrupted at that moment as a beautiful black owl with a letter. Draco watched as it landed on Harry s outstretched legs and as he took the letter which he quickly read then placed it into his robes.
"Possible. Look I should go I have to meet them in a half hour. I will see you and the girls around seven."
"I am the Lord of The Most Ancient and Noble House of Black, Lord Potter and the Heir of Salazar Slytherin and Godric Gryffindor know your place."
things go and if I do get y N.E.W.T.S. done then I will be free to run Hogwarts at and Administration level and McGonagall could handle the students and I could manage everything else.”
He looked up surprised but grasped Harry's hand and again he felt that tingling sensation. "Are you sure you want the others to know?" he asked as he looked down at their joined hands.
"Silence," he yelled as he drew his wand and approached the two individuals. "What in Merlin is going on here Draco?"
Draco couldn't believe that Harry Bloody Potter was going to be giving him competition in his grades this year. When he walked into Arithmancy he thought he had walked into the wrong class, but when Professor Vector had announced that he got a perfect score he was shocked. He had come in second to Granger by missing half a point and Granger was shy of perfection by missing seven points. The look on her face to be beaten out of first place was priceless. He would have to thank Harry for that later. They were on their way down to the dungeons for potions and he could tell that Harry was trying to avoid Granger and just barely succeeding so in true Slytherin fashion he decided to intervene.
"Harry, wake up. Please Harry." He frantically said as he pulled the thrashing young man into his arms. "Harry… Harry wake up… You are safe. I am here Harry wake up." He whispered into his ear as he stroked the sweat soaked hair from his face. Dark grey eyes snapped open and before he knew it he was under Harry with a wand at his throat.
"It is nice to finally meet the real you Harry." He watched Luna say as she came up and wrapped her arms around Harry. He watched as Harry bent down and kissed the lithe girl on the forehead.
He had been placing tender kiss across Draco's jaw and had moved down his chest in his attempts to quiet the young man in his arms and it had finally worked as Draco grabbed his head and pulled him back up so he could lay claim to his lips.
slender woman wearing regal robes with her long hair flowing freely and a beautiful diadem on her head.
When class was dismissed he had about an hour before he was going to meet with his friends. So he went back with Draco to their room.
"Look I never intentional blocked or have I ever rejected our bond. Yes we are Soul Mates and I have suspected this since the beginning of summer but wasn't confirmed for me until I kissed you. We have always been drawn to each other. I thought you were the most beautiful boy I have ever seen when I first met you in Madam Malkin's but then you had to open your mouth and you reminded me of my cousin who's favorite past time was Harry hunting. Our bond mutated a bit but it was fixable because we never fully rejected it and that was mostly due to things that happened to me when I was a baby." He watched as Harry paused to take a few breathes, "I am going to tell you something that only four people in this world know; one of them only guessing and two of them are now dead. Voldemort split his soul into pieces and hid these pieces into dark artifacts called Horcruxes that was how he would return. The last year during the war Hermione, Ron and I went and collected the remaining Horcruxes and destroyed them. When he came after me when I was a baby he accidently turned me into one. I was a Horcrux, I walked into that forest knowing I was going to die and I was okay with that. It was the only way to defeat him. I didn't die because when Voldemort cast the killing curse it killed the piece of his soul that was attached to my scar. When I went to the Manor to return your wand I couldn't help but feel drawn to you in a different way than before, there was no feelings of rivalry. You looked so confused and depressed and all I wanted to do was wrap you in my arms and comfort you and this scared me so I left."
"Look I know I have asked a lot of you already and that you deserve answers. I will try to answer as many as I can but you must know that some things and answers are not mine to give and I will at least try to answer those the best I can." Harry said. Draco looked at him and noticed that Harry seemed nervous.
"Harry I... was hoping you would walk with me to Potions I was wondering what time you would like the girls to meet at our room tonight." He said as he watched Granger turn on him and glare.
"What a beautiful specimen. I would love some of her venom, for strictly academic purposes of course."
"I said take it off." He looked at Draco and could tell that he meant what he said. He had never showed anyone the scars that he had. He preferred to take a shower last and when anyone was around until the day that Severus saw them and helped him make a glamour potion that they had found in the potions library. He watched as Draco continued to stare at him as he removed his clothing and slipped his own black sleep pants on over a pair of rather tight pair of green boxer briefs.
"No, not really. I have trouble sleeping at night. I have nightmares almost every night about the war and this time it was different I couldn't wake myself up out of it. It seemed too real and things changed in it. I can't talk about it yet."
As Harry expected Fawkes was sitting on a perch in the kitchen while Kreacher was feeding him pieces of bacon.
"Mister Malfoy I believe it is your turn." Andromeda called. He squeezed Draco hand before watching him walk up to step into the circle. The white light was more intense this time and Harry watched it fade to reveal not only the familiar blue light that seemed to claim the Slytherins from the water rune, although the darkness of it made it seem to shimmer black at times, but also a dark yellow coming from the air rune as well.
"Master Draco he did not say but I knows who he is, and you must go see him." Sage said and stomped her foot.
"You do know sir that one there is highly poisonous, it has tried to strike everyone who has got near it. I can hardly condone you buying it and wearing it like a necklace."
"Yes Ron I do more than I trust your parents right now. Snape never lied to me or tried to manipulate me like Dumbledore. Dumbledore knew about my parents just like yours did. He also manipulated me and tried to play on my insecurities and dreams. I love your family but right now Ron I don't want anything to do with your parents. I need time to forgive them. I was hoping we could still be friends once you got past the changes with me. But I am not changing for you or anyone I am going to be true to myself and if that involves no longer playing dumb so others can feel like they are helping me or better than me so be it." He said as he pushed away from the table. "I am sorry for hurting your feelings but I cannot be Harry Potter any more, he was an act. I acted the way I thought I was supposed to but that is not me."
Draco didn't know what to think when Harry came storming into their room. He watched as Harry ripped off his robes and through them in a bunch in the corner then yell for Kreacher. Nisha even seemed to want to get away from her master as fast as possible. He could feel the frustration and the anger coming of him in waves.
could barely hear the howler yelling. Godric and Salazar were waiting for them as they entered into the
"Nothing of importance mo choir lets head out and leave these two alone to chat and have a quiet day in our rooms."
He watched as Harry began to chuckle then turned to face him. "I thought that was obvious Draco," he said as he leaned in towards him. Draco could feel his breathe on his face when he finally finished "I like you." With a stunned look on his face he watched Harry grab his bag and march off into the Forbidden Forest.
"Look I was scared and you guys already had enough on your plates, with leaving your families to go with me I didn t think I should bother you."
"Better now I will admit that I am still shaken but it will pass now that you are here. So what is this book about my heart?"
"What do you mean you had help?" Draco asked as the shock of finding out Harry was gay finally wore off.
Harry watched as the rest of the class pulled out their books. He noticed Hermione looked upset at the fact that there was no real instruction for the class she sat next to Dean and tried to get his attention. Padma and Pavarti sat behind them already deeply involved in their books. The class rounded out with three other Ravenclaws, two Hufflepuffs and all of the current Slytherins.
They walked hand in hand to the Great Hall for lunch and sat at the Slytherin table together. Pansy and Millicent didn't let this go unnoticed for long and soon they were the topic of gossip though out the hall.
He was returning with the book when he saw Salazar moving through the portraits towards the study so he decided to ask "Salazar do you know a common translation charm?"
Draco watched as the students went to receive the clothes they were to be tested in. The girls were given cotton shifts and the boys were given cotton draw string pants. He was surprised to see that more than a few of the students didn't go to receive their clothes and were being ushered out of the hall. The number of students had decreased by half before he went to change into his pants. He waited next to the door that Harry had entered curious if he would keep the glamour on or if he would take it off. He wasn't surprised when the door opened and Harry stood their barefoot and with pants slung low on his narrow hips. He heard gasps and whispers when the two of them returned to the group around the circle.
Draco didn't know what to think when he had read the news that Harry Potter had disappeared from the wizarding world a week after the defeat of the dark lord. He had just seen the Chosen One four days before when he had shown up at the Manor's doors...
"I know and I am sorry, but things were made clear this summer. Some of things that I had felt were put into perspective and that's why there can t be an us."
Harry still in his lion form began to slink back to his seat and changed on his way effortlessly. By the time he sat down Headmistress McGonagall had called the class back to order and they began to study their lists.
"Draco I had Kreacher put my things away and when he closed the door the closet grew and put all of my clothes to one side. I asked Salazar why and he simply said that my other half when found would fill the rest. I didn't argue or question him. That room over there is the bathroom and before you ask its larger than the Prefects bathroom and it has a shower."
“I am very proud of you Harry for asserting your authority, but next time give us more notice I missed the
"Don t mind him", he heard from behind him. "Kreacher feels the necessity to make up for past misconceptions. Kreacher."
"Well this is most unusual to show both affinities for water and also air. Well done Mister Malfoy you may take a seat." He watched a stunned Draco go sit with the rest of the students that showed affinities. He wasn't surprised to see Teddy wiggle his way out of McGonagall's arms to sit down in Draco's lap.
Within moments they were back in their room in the eighth year tower. With a quick kiss goodbye he watched Harry leave their room to go to class.
He had heard that Patronuses could change depending if the memory used was based on love. He had his proof in front of him that Harry did love him. Yes he was scared and he wanted to run, but he did not want to reject the bond that was between them. He couldn't, he knew he had been falling for Harry ever since that first kiss. He had realized ages ago that he had a crush on him and everything seem to be falling into place now. There really was only one thing left for him to do. He got down on his knees in front of Harry and pushed his hands away from his face to meet his eyes. He looked into those dark grey depths and said the only thing he could "Harry I love you too, mon beau coeur."
"Well that is helpful. You no longer have to call for Kreacher and you didn't even tell them about your ring." Draco said as he stretched out nest to him on the bed. They were still in the cotton drawstring pants and had forgotten their rooms in the Great Hall.
"Yes... Yes I believe you are right Mister Black. I would like everyone to practice the spells seen today and to try to cast them non-verbally for next class."
He could feel magic seep into his mind from the wound as the burning sensation slowly start to fade. The blackness he expected never came. He could hear Harry calling his name as he was dragged into his arms and he watched as Nisha slithered to the end of the bed and looked at them both. He heard the familiar hissing of Harry's parseltounge and anger behind it. It was weird because slowly the hissing turn to things that sounded like words and then abruptly it turned to words and sentences.
It was only a bit after nine so the common room was filled with their classmates. Many didn't even notice them as they slipped through, but they did hear a distinctive squeal as they passed Pansy and Millicent before they reached the Portrait.
"Please take a seat, we are currently reviewing the final exams from last year. As you received top marks with a perfect score I believe you can start on reading chapter 18 in your book." Professor Vector said as she handed him his exam. When he turned around he noticed only two free seats left in the classroom. One next to a very angry and confused looking Hermione and the other next to Draco who just looked shocked that he was in this class. So without a second thought he took the seat next to Draco and quietly got out his book and began reviewing the chapter that he had already read. By the end of the class Professor Vector had gone over the exam and began asking questions on their current reading. It seemed she felt it necessary to prove to the rest of the class that Harry had earned his grades and called on him repeatedly. This only seemed to confuse the rest of the class and frustrate Hermione to no end. When the bell rang he was relieved that it was over and the homework she had assigned he could finish easily and he could escape his classmates for a few minutes before double potions before lunch.
He began to wonder about his place after the death of both Sirius and Dumbledore but it wasn t until his seventeenth birthday that things really changed again. He woke up in agonizing pain. His whole body glowed from the magic coursing through it and then he felt his bones break and grow. His hair lengthened and lost the unruliness. He felt the magic in his body grow and expand it was painful and he nearly died. He woke the following morning and crawled his way to the bathroom and looked in the mirror what he say confused him. His hair was still black but fell to his shoulders in waves. He now stood at least six foot one and his shoulders were broader. The biggest change he noticed was his eyes were no longer emerald green but were the color of dark grey storm clouds. In his panic he threw up a glamour that changed him back to his original appearance and hid the changes from his friends.
come. I must tell you the last heir will be here soon and his mate is waiting for him. You must have many
A small crack sounded in the hallway and the familiar elf was standing before Harry in a low bow. "Yes Master Black."
Morning arrived too early for Harry. He was just stepping out of the shower when Kreacher arrived and grabbed his hand and with a pop he was in his and Draco s bathroom starring at a much disheveled Draco.
"Yes I am. If that bothers you I am sorry but like I said before I am not changing for no one." With that said he left his two best friends and his ex-girlfriend stunned in the room.
"There you are young man. What have I told you about running off?" a very frazzled older witch said as she took a reluctant Teddy from his arms. "Thank you for taking care of him… good Merlin you look just like Cissy when she was younger. I'm Andromeda Tonks it's nice to finally meet you newphew. You can call me Aunt Andy if you like but if you pass the tests to get in to my class I guess it will have to be Professor when we are in class."
Draco watched as the hat was placed on Harry s head and a glamour fell away from him in a rippling affect. More shocked gasp fell from the rooms occupants as the hat was overheard saying to him if he was going to start a new he should not hide behind the false glamour placed upon him from years ago. The new Harry was revealed, his hair was no longer unruly and it fell in soft waves to his shoulders, a snake was seen wrapped around his neck with its head whispering into his ear and yet the most striking change was his eyes. No longer were they the emerald green and hidden behind glasses but they now were a storm grey. Draco drank in the various changes of his once rival and waited for the hat to announce the inevitable placement in Gryffindor.
"Who is it Sage?" Draco question. He was tired of the constant invasion of his home by the Ministry and the Auror department. Aurors had been station to guard him and his mother until there trial. His father was once again in Azkaban and his friends had abandoned him.
"Well I guess that makes this easier to ask so Viktor I would like to offer you the position of Defense Teacher at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. You of course can write your own contract, I will need a temporary lesson plan by tomorrow and you would need to start on Monday." Viktor shook himself out of his shock and looked to Harry.
Harry wasn't very far into the forest before he called Kreacher. The little elf had Nisha wrapped around his waist as some sort of belt.
"The magic I have been able to do wandlessly since sixth year. I had private tutoring and when I can into my inheritance I could do it wordlessly as well it is effortless for me now. The disappearing will have to save for another time it is not mine to entirely tell. When I can I promise you will be the first that I tell."
"Just want to understand your Heir." He said chuckling as he returned to Harry casting the charm on his way.
"See I told you the new look was just an act Mione." Draco could hear Ron say before there was a large gasp from the rest of the students.
He really didn't know what to expect when he returned to their room. He had assumed that Harry had disappeared to where ever he was hiding. So when he entered and he saw Harry sitting on his bed with a letter in hand and two owls perched on a conjured stand he didn't really know what to do.
"My apologizes Severus but it needed to be down. I believe even you told me I should have been in Slytherin towards the end of sixth year. I played the part well and never did I reveal to Ron and Hermione that I knew of the oath you gave to Dumbledore. By the way if you haven t heard already I cleared your name with the Ministry and I have a present of sorts for you."
He almost took out a few first years as he ran out of the girls bathroom on the first floor. As he entered Greenhouse seven he noticed that many of the occupants were already pairing up. Draco was already standing next to Pansy as he made his way over to the tables.
"You knew about this didn't you?" he asked Harry as they left the Great Hall for the hidden entrance to the chambers.
It wasn't long before they had reached the entrance and he watched Harry hiss at the door and the snakes began to move and unlock it. Draco was amazed at the size of the Basilisk's skeleton that filled the Chambers.
The rest of the day passed without any real commotion. They received a few glares from some of their classmates mostly from Ron. A few whispered "I always knew were whispered" in the hallways and even a few "they're so cute together" were heard which had surprised Draco. At dinner Headmistress McGonagall made the announcement that they would be receiving a new teacher on Thursday and if seventh and eighth years would like they could sign up for Alchemy training on signup sheets in their common rooms. If they wished to take the class they would have to pass a test in the Great Hall on Thursday during third hour or on Friday during the same time period. They would be introduced to the new teacher during those times.
She began to stand up but he had bit her robs and pulled her down into her side. He liked the laugh that she had rang out when she fell into him he had truly missed his friend and he began to purr when she started to scratch behind his ears.
"Hermione will you Kindly escort the first years to the Great Hall for lunch we will be there shortly."
"And what is that?" he replied as he now got to see the front of him and the tattoo of Marauders that ran across his muscular chest and the two on his toned arms that said Padfoot and Prongs. He couldn t help but think that he was a very attractive man and he realized then that the other feelings he had this summer for Harry Potter were turning into crush on Harrison Corvus Black.
Herbology passed by in no time. The next class was Defense Against the Dark Arts where the instructor, an Ex-Auror named Clark Bingham, decided it was his personal duty to duel against each and every student to see where they were, and what needed to be taught. Harry s fellow classmates did very well and the duels were over within minutes. He noticed that Hermione, Ron and Neville gave him a good fight and that Draco, all though some of his spells could be questionable lasted the longest. Professor Bingham decided to save him for last. Harry couldn t believe that the old Auror thought he was going to get the best of him. He played along for a while but when he was getting bored he decided to finish it. Bingham had casted and Expelliarmus while he casted a wordless Protego Maxima and sat down in the middle of the classroom. Professor Bingham stood there and continued to cast spells but nothing could get through and after a while Harry had enough. So he stood up and placed Nisha on the floor then wandlessly and wordlessly casted Engorgio on her then allowed her to pass through the shield. She was enlarged to about 7 meters long, he watched as the rest of the class backed away from her and Bingham stood slacked jawed and starred.
"Well if you must know MALFOY, I call you Draco because I would like us to be friends. You have never lied to me before and never treated me as anything but a normal person. But most of all I have not hated you since the fifth year. Yes you were a complete and utter prat to me and my friends, but someone wise once told me to look past the Malfoy mask to see the real person and when I did I liked what I saw. You saved my life at you manor and after today I am pretty sure all of my so called friends will no longer be speaking to me." He yelled and flung himself on his bed.
"Well do you accept Krum or is Harry just standing here with his hand out for nothing?" Draco sneered.
He said as he reached out a hand to stroke the snake's scales je gave out a gasp a molten mercury eyes looked at him.
The hour or so he was gone passed in no time. He had taken a shower and Nisha had worked with him to show him the difference between the two languages. She would shake her head when he was speaking in the human language that she couldn't understand which helped him slowly get control of his new ability. When Harry returned they held conversations back and forth and by lunch he could control his new ability.
" Mmm 'k." he heard the quite voice say. He watched Harry turn the small boy in his arms to face him. The amber eyes that looked at him slowly changed to a silver grey and the black hair started to have blonde streaks appear throughout it.
"First off don t expect any special treatment from us just because you re the Savior and all and I will not apologize for trying to turn you over during the battle."
Ginny Weasley was the only seventh year Gryffindor claimed much to Harry's surprise when a pale red light engulfed her from the fire rune.
He could not breathe and his whole body was begining to shake. He could tell Draco was having a hard time trying not to attack Ron but Draco was having an even harder time trying to keep him from not losing his temper.
"No Harry they are a testament to how you have survived. I am sorry to say this but the only scar I have is one you gave me." He said as he stepped forward so Harry could see him better and waved his wand over his chest.
"Please do not yell Mister Finch-Fletchly. Mister Black was registered during the summer so he is perfectly capable of assisting. Mister Black would you care to share your form with us."
"Just because you are a painting does not mean I cannot give you company. But first I need you to promise to apologize to her, she has been through a lot and let s just say Salazar should really warn people about waking up portraits that have been asleep for seventeen years."
And now that he was on his way back to Hogwarts to finish his final year of schooling, part of his sentence, he was thinking about Harry wondering if the Savior of the Wizarding World would be returning as well. He had looked for him at Kings Cross Station and aboard the Express but did not see him.
Draco looked at Harry and he could feel the hurt evaporate from his heart but he saw pain flash across Harry's eyes, what was going to come next was something that was causing him pain. "I grew up in a home where I was called a freak because of my magic. I was no better than a house elf, I cooked and cleaned and did all of the chores from a very young age. I was mental abused by my Aunt and Uncle and physically by my cousin for a time. I lived in a cupboard for the first ten years I was there. They thought guys who liked blokes were disgusting and were freaks. I didn't know how to handle the feelings that I had for you and after reading my fathers' journal I came to accept them. I am sorry for not telling you, but I wanted you to like me for who I am not because I am the Savior or because of some bond. I have admired you for many years and I know who you are, I can see behind the masks you so carefully construct for yourself. Draco mo chorí means my heart because that is what you are to me. It may be too early to tell you this but I do love you and I am sorry for hiding this from you." Harry sat there as Draco watched him run his hand through his hair and then burry his face in them. He watched as Harry waved his hand and whispered "Expecto Patronum." Instead of the silver stag Draco was expecting a massive dragon began to fill the room.
Draco watched the conversation between the house elf and his master. He caught himself starring at Harry. He had grown since the last he saw him, he was now the same height as himself. He noticed that he was broader in the shoulders as he removed his robes and handed them to the elf. When he turned around and their eyes locked he felt he was looking into an oncoming storm his eyes were so grey and alive.
"Good afternoon class. This year is going to be a bit different. I handing a list of spells out of what is required of you for your N.E.W.T.S and you will have independent or group study if you wish on them. Starting in January I will be giving you practical and written exams, but before that I will be available to help you during your class time which is not mandatory. However I would like a two foot essay on the spell that you studied that week and on Thursdays I would like a demonstration of what you have learned during the class period."
"If you had my tutors you would too, besides it is only a calming draught, and I think that a few of our classmates are going to need it today." He said as he looked over to his friends table.
Harry walked over to the table and was repulsed by what he saw. A once beautiful snake laid mangled next to its cage. He could tell that at one point tis scales were white with a pearlescent shine to them. He laid his hands on the limp body and poured his magic in to it. He watched as the numerous cuts began to heal.
"What are you doing?" he asked as he watched the aged elf hang his new silk shirt up in his wardrobe.
One more Hufflepuff strode forward to be dismissed before the Ravenclaws started filling in to the circle. He was not surprised to see the dark yellow tendrils from the air rune encircling Luna who was the only Ravenclaw claimed. He was not surprised to see the intensity of the color when Luna's affinity showed. He knew that she was stronger than she let on.
"Let's see you used to follow me around all the time to spy on me and you don t think that I did the same, how daft. Plus it does help that Moaning Myrtle loves to talk about you but would never say where you disappeared to."
"Thanks mo chorí." he heard Harry say as he walked out the door. He defiantly was going to look for a translation charm soon, he wanted to know what Harry had been calling him.
"Hello Mister Malfoy, I apologize for not speaking plainly but I needed to inform Harry of certain, information that you are not yet ready for. I welcome you to my Sanctuary in the Chamber of Secrets, I do wish you could have meet Letalis. He was very sweet when he was young, but alas he meet his end a few years back."
"Besides the dramatics of youth you may want to look in the library for a book on bonds. That might explain some things. If you have more questions afterwards you can seek me out."
"No, not yet but maybe someday if you're lucky. By the way this is Nisha she is and Indian Krait and something more, she is bonded to me so you don t have to worry about her biting you in your sleep. Plus she will be with me most of the time anyways. I told Kreacher that you are allowed to give him orders and he is to follow them within reason. He will not obey anyone else so do not worry about Ron or Hermione trying to get him to do something to you. There is one more thing that I have to ask of you Draco."
"Mister Harry Potter, I am here to request your presents at the reading of the Potters and Black wills." The Goblin didn t even give him a chance to change from his ruined clothes that he had fallen asleep in the night before. He simple had took his arm and apparated into a secure room at Gringotts.
"Harry..." he looked into the emerald green eyes of the one who held him "your snake seems to be talking to me and I think I can understand it as well. What is going on?"
heirs once you are untied so do not fret about what is to come, live the moment and all will be as it
The commotion in the Great Hall Thursday during third hour was over whelming. Harry and him had walked in hand in hand to see all of the eighth year students and about half of seventh years staring at a circle that was in the center of the room. He didn't get much time to examine the circle before he realized that his boyfriend had released his hand and was bending done too scoop up an energetic ball of blue and green.
He knew something was going to happen he could feel it the entire time he was in the Great Hall as his classmates were slowly shown their affinities, he just didn't know exactly what. When the white light surrounded him it nearly blinded him. He felt the elements respond to his control and as the light faded the dark tendrils of green, yellow, blue, and red wrapped around him searing lines into his flesh. Green vines began to wrap around his left weaving in and out of his tattoo of his father's name. Yellow feathers began to appear on his right arm. Red flames and blue waves crashed against each other on his back to surround the Deathly Hallows tattoo. He could barely hear the screaming of his name form the students and teachers that surrounded him. It wasn't until the dark tendrils of light faded back into the runes that their sound penetrated the circle.
banish a foul reprobate who made first years participate in torturing one of magic’s sacred creatures,
"Ronald Weasley how dare you call him a freak." Hermione yelled. Everyone was shocked even Ginny looked appalled at Ron for calling Harry a freak because she knew of his past.
"Why? Why didn't you tell me? What does this mean and why if love is so important to you would you block something like this?" he felt hurt and scared everything he had wanted was suddenly stolen from him. Harry was just playing some game with him.
"Welcome back, I have made a list of potions on the board, I would like you all to choose one of the potions listed and work on it individually. You have the remainder of the class to work on it and may leave after a finished vial is on my desk and I would like a two foot essay on the aspects of the potion and individual ingredients due at the start of next class you may began."
"It is from Shacklebolt. He assigned some Aurors to look after me this summer while they tried to round up the remaining Death Eaters. Two of them just turned up dead. They were tortured and the Dark Mark was carved into their chests. One of them was the one assigned to watch over Andromeda and Teddy"
"I wouldn't do that if I were you." He turned to face the portrait behind the desk. "He trusts you and when he is ready he will show you but he isn't yet. He still unsure of your intentions when he knows what his are."
"That may be true but I will always have you. You have never once abandoned me, you may have not liked me but you never let up on being a bloody prat to me. You have always been a constant Draco. Thank you." He said as he sprawled out on his bed.
The eighth years were escorted by Professor Vector to the third floor and down the west corridor to a very large portrait of the four founders. The portrait open to the password unity and they went inside. The common room was decorated with black leather and oak furniture. There was four hallways leading off from the common room each opening surrounded by their individual house colors and shield at the top of the arch way.
"No Master Black, Kreacher can't sense anything like those," he said as Nisha was slithering down his leg to the forest floor.
"Harry I forgave you a long time ago." Draco's other hand found its way to his and began to pull him to the bed. "Lets get some sleep."
Harry watched her turn around and return to the head table as he grabbed Draco and Hermione and we to
"Well I was hoping that it would not have come up, but yes I would have eventually. I can teach you if you want. Sirius taught me over the summer before fifth year. No one knew and by Christmas with some help from a tutor, I made my first change. Sirius was so proud of me, he was a dog that looked like a Grimm, I took up most of his room and Buckbeack tried to kill me."
"Give me a minute Hermione I will be right out." Harry yelled at the door then turned towards him to look in to his eyes and brushed a wayward strand from his face. "So I am hoping this means you will go out with me?"
"I am sorry Harry. You have always been my friend and even more a brother. When the first time you do something that I don't like because I cannot logically understand I brushed you aside and I am sorry for that. Big sisters are supposed to protect and love their little brothers and I betrayed you because I could not understand why you hide your true self from us for so long. I realized after much contemplation last night that probably was due to the fact that you didn't want to lose the only friends you had. Your family had been so awful to you, and you didn't want to risk losing the one you created for yourself. So once again I am truly sorry and regretful for my actions these past few days. I love you little brother and I accept that you are gay and love Draco. But don't get me wrong if he hurts you he will be reintroduced to by right hook again."
"I need you to keep a secret. You don t have to worry about sharing a room with me I have other arrangements in the castle that no one knows and most wouldn t understand. So these rooms are yours but for appearance sake I will leave some of my things here like Kreacher suggested. If someone comes looking for me just tell them that I am out or that I am in the bathroom and send Kreacher to get me."
“Mon couer what ever you decide I will support you.” he said as he brought Harry into his arms and kissed
"I wanted to see if you are okay and to return this to you." He said as he held out Draco s wand. "It took down Voldemort and I wanted to say thank you. I know you knew it was me when your Aunt and father questioned you. Why didn t you tell them it was me? You know what never mind I don t need to know. I... just wanted to give you your wand back and make sure you re okay and it seems that you are. So... I guess I will be leaving now. Good bye Draco." With that he turned and left.
By the time he had Kreacher setup dinner in the Room of Requirements Ron, Hermione and Ginny were entering the room.
If you are reading this then I am not there beside you. First and foremost you must know that I love you and what we did we did to keep you safe. Before I continue I would ask for you forgiveness for the deception that I was forced to play. You were born not out of the love between Lily and James, you were born from the love James and I had for each other. Lily in the sense is your mother for she carried you until you were born but James and I are your blood and your fathers. Your true name is Harrison Corvus Black and you are the heir to both the Potter and Black estates. I truly wished I would be there for you when the truth is revealed. Dumbledore would not allow me to tell you when you freed me during your third year. It was so hard to look upon you and not be able to tell the truth. James and I had performed a wizard s oath with him when I sent you and James into hiding truly believing you would be safe. The oath would have been fuffiled at the defeat of Voldermort or upon your seventeenth birthday. It seems that I have missed both. I loved your father and when he died I lost part of myself and my biggest regret in life was going after that rat and not being able to watch you grow up. I fought so hard for you but Dumbledore, Arthur and Molly thought you were better off with Lily s family. I know you have a lot of questions and I know that I cannot answer them, but I hope what you find in the wills and our vaults will put to rest many of them. You were born from the love of two men and you must always remember that love is love not matter who you find it with. James and I both love you Harry and we will always look after you. I hope that if you should find that you need something that you could look to Remus and Severus they knew nothing of the deception. We obliviated the knowledge from Remus and Severus had always had eyes for Lily so we figured he would watch over you for her so he was never informed. I hope you can forgive us and forgive the Weasleys and even that old coot Dumbledore. I truly wish this fines you well and I hope you live your life for you, no longer hiding in the shadows and be true to yourself. You are the son of two Marauders and you need to live for yourself and damn the consequences my son.
"I believe he has locked himself in that charming cottage with the Lady Evans. Good night Harry and Draco."
He had started to drift off to sleep when the shuffling of feet grabbed his attention to someone's approach. Not knowing who it was as Draco was supposed to be in class he decided to feign sleeping. It surprised him when Hermione sat down next to his head and began petting his fur.
. He looked down and in a terrarium on the bottom shelf was a small but very beautiful black and silver snake with glowing emerald green eyes.
Harry had led them into an ante chamber of sorts where two snake statues stood guarding a door and suddenly the room was filled with hissing.
"No Ron I am not I am just Harry, I have always been just Harry. It is not my fault that you can t see that."
Hogwarts but as a seerer I am tied to the Mistress of Fates as well. I watched and as much as I wanted to
"Yeah, I was hoping for a better wake up than this but I have to get ready for class it seems we have slept part way through breakfast. I have Ancient rune and you don't have class until third hour and that isn't mandatory so we have until lunch to work on this. I'm going to get ready then we will go back to our room and I will meet you at the start of second hour to help you. We will figure this out Draco I promise." He watched as Harry leaned in and kissed him. He felt the passion and even the concern Harry had for him behind it. He could admit that he was jealous of Harry's ability to speak to snakes and he never imagined that he would have that ability one day but now he did and he was a bit worried at what it meant for the two of them. He watched as Harry rushed to the bathroom to get ready.
“Well I believe I have the perfect candidate and will ask him when I see him this weekend. I believe we
"I know you can't Hermione and I am not asking you to. But I know who he is I have seen through his mask I have had a lot of practice in that. Draco is complicated he did most of the things to protect himself and his family. He was never a Death Eater, he never took the mark."
“Then I guess it is all in your hands. I will owl you the forms this mysterious person will need to fill out and
"Not a problem Viktor I will see tomorrow no doubt and I will have the elves prepare a room for the two of you."
"He was actually when he found out, I think I gained some of his respect then. But let me finish well I went to a muggle doctor and got my eyes fixed after I moved into Potter Manor. Then got new clothes and my tattoos, grew out my hair and basically hide away from the magical world all summer. Even went to a gay club in London one night. Not sure how to tell Ron that part yet. I studied a lot, took my owl in Arithmancy and Ancient Runes and passed then took all the exams Professor Vector and Professor Babbling had assigned after I had owled them. Then read up on all sorts of Pureblood traditions and etiquette so that I would no longer make a fool of myself. I think that explains my summer, except appending time with my godson and his grandmother."
After pondering over the past few years he decided his first order of business was to drop the glamour he had worn since his seventeenth birthday. Then he was going to get his eyes fix and a few wizarding tattoos. Next order he was going to burn all of his clothes and get himself an entire new wardrobe.
"Harry you didn't wake me. I was in the library reading a book." He decided he wasn't going to tell him that he been snooping around his study.
"Well what is going on dear boy since it seems that you know more than what you have been letting on."
“You can call me Grandmere Roe and so can Harry lil one. We founders will help guide and protect you
"Humpf, I didn t think he would bring you here in a towel." Draco said as he yawned and rubbed the sleep from his eyes. "But Granger was here a few minutes ago looking for you. I didn t think you were a morning person Potter."
"Severus be nice to the boy. Hello Harry." The woman with red wavy hair and familiar green eyes that had accompanied Professor Snape said.
She hissed into his ear as she settled herself back around his neck with her tail wrapped around his arm.
"Lets see; Ancient Ruins on Tuesday and Thursday, Arithmancy Wednesday and Friday, Astronomy Tuesday Through Thursday, Charms Thursday and Friday, DADA Wednesday and Friday, Herbology Wednesday and Friday, Potions Wednesday and Friday, Transfiguration Wednesday and Thursday. If everything goes as planned you can add Alchemy Thursday and Friday I expect there will be an announcement tomorrow at dinner about it."
Harry watched and listened as the hundreds of snakes went off to search for the resurrection stone. What would have token him and Nisha days if not weeks to find took his new allies less than fifteen minutes.
"Don t worry Draco he has mellowed out and I would protect you." He watched as a blush formed across Draco s cheeks. He couldn t help but think how he would like to see that more often.
The meeting with McGonagall went as well as he expected. She was upset that he didn t tell her about his talk with the Sorting Hat and about his discoveries this summer. When he had left her office he could hear her having a heated discussion with Dumbledore s painting about keeping secrets. By the etime he had reached the seventh floor Arithmancy classroom, Professor Vector had already started class.
When Harry looked up his eyes were sparkling and Draco saw joy in them, he now knew that Pansy and Millicent were right.
He received his books and equipment list a week later and made a trip to Diagon Alley. He left off his glamour and ventured to the Leaky Cauldron. He first went to Flourish and Blotts and bought his school books. Then he went in to Madam Malkin s Robes to by new school robes. His next stop was Eeylops Owl Emporium, he didn t want to get a new owl but he saw the necessity of it. When he entered he was instantly drawn to a pair that sat next to each other. One was a beautiful golden color with flashes of orange and red while sitting next to it was a beautiful black owl that had pale grey and white accents. He inquired about the pair and soon left with them he named the male who was the golden one Apollo and kept with him. The black female was named Artemis and he sent her to Andromeda and Teddy so he could always keep in touch with them while he was at school. He went to a few more shops picking up things here and there. But when he passed Magical Menagerie he heard a small voice calling out. When he went into the shop he wandered towards the back where he could hear the voice coming from.
During his trial he found out that Harry had sent in his memories and was interviewed and was an integral part of clearing Draco of the charges brought against him. He was only sentenced to house arrest for some of the crimes he had committed as a juvenile. Harry had also sent information that acquitted his mother of all charges.
"Fine." With a wave of his hand the glamour rippled away to show Draco the scars that laid beneath. He had the burn from the Hungarian Horntail on his lower right side that went part way across his stomach. The fang mark from Letalis the basilisk on his right arm, the knife wound from Wormtail where the Dark Mark would be on a Death Eater given to him during Voldemort's resurrection and "I must not tell lies" still carved into the back of his left hand. He turned to show Draco the scar that crossed his lower back that was from the final battle. He had gotten hit from a stray cutting curse and healed it on his own so he could continue to fight. When he turned around he watched as Draco tried to mask the shock on his face. "I know they are pretty ugly."
"It Still just Harry, Draco, and I am playing at nothing. Lets just say that the truth about a lot of things was revealed to me this summer and for now leave it at that."
"Harry I am a founder and a Slytherin. I only told you what you needed to know at the time. Godric here would never have omitted the truth he is to honorable for that."
Hermione was the last to go for the Gryffindors and to many of the students surprise she was not shown to have any affinity for the elements. He watched as she went off disappointed to sit next to Ron.
The next morning he awoke to two panicked familiars darting under the covers and slithering their way up between himself and Draco.
"Good afternoon students. I am Professor Andromeda Tonks. I will be teaching Alchemy to those of you who are found to have the aptitude for the class. Alchemy is the study of the elements in their most raw form and the power to change and manipulate them. Very few are able to do this and even rarer are they able to do this with more than one element. The circle here represents the elements. The rune for air, water, fire, and earth mark the four cardinal points. I will ask each of you to change into these. They are made from cotton and have never been touched by magic. There are changing rooms towards the back of the hall once everyone is changed we will begin with the seventh years first."
"Hello Miss Parkinson. I am glad that you are getting along with Mister Black here. I hope that he will help with breaking the tension with the other houses. It does not bode well for the rest of the houses to discriminate against Slytherin. Malfoy would you kindly close your mouth you look like a fish. If any of you need my assistance for something that is important you may call on me. Now I am going to retire." They watched their Professor say as he turned and left with a flourish of his robes.
