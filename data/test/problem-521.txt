I never know how to summarize correctly. very hot I guess, I'm mostly insulting harry's abilities to handle his nightmares
“I can’t do anything else,” Draco retorted, too quickly, “your body is on my arm and if I moved you would have w—fallen off this bed.” Harry resisted rolling his eyes. For a Slytherin, Draco was a terrible liar.
Harry turned around when he was prompted to. Draco pried his arse cheeks open and kissed Harry’s tailbone.
Harry and Draco looked at each other and laughed quietly. They set all of the charms again and Harry pulled the covers back, causing Draco’s erection to spring back up.
“Of course, you can't. Don't go mad on me, Potter,” he joked. He pulled Harry closer to him by the legs. Harry laughed, cupping Draco's cheeks with his gloved hands when Draco bent over to kiss him. “I love you.”
Harry mulled over her evidence and nodded in defeat. “Maybe he didn't hate me,” he conceded. He looked over at Ron and felt his throat get scratchy. “He's refusing to take it.”
“My birthday is June 5th,” he said instead, “my favorite color is purple—yes, purple, stop giving me that look. My favorite food is soupe à l’oignon,” Draco continued, ignoring Harry’s question, “dessert is chocolate covered strawberries, and despite popular opinion I actually
“Well, Freddie, there's our answer,” George said cheerfully. “And, Harry, if you were to wake up tomorrow to see Malfoy completely naked and in your bed, what would you do?”
“We saw that kiss, mate,” Fred called when Harry walked back to the living room. “Malfoy's really got you, hasn't he?”
“I won't forget about you,” he murmured. Draco pulled him into a tight hug and rested his chin on Harry's head. Harry wrapped his arms around Draco's back. “Why do you always smell so good?” he asked. Draco shook with quiet laughter. Harry shivered after a moment.
“You do?” he asked. Draco hummed. “Well, for your mental health and my stomach, I hope you haven’t slept with any of your stuffed animals,” Harry teased. Draco pulled a confused expression.
“I don’t care, Draco,” Harry snapped. “Are you going to fuck me or am I going to have to find someone else who will?” Hurt flashed over Draco’s features for a split second before he recomposed himself. Harry felt a pang of guilt but was still focusing too hard on sex to register it fully. Draco stuck his hands down Harry’s pants and squeezed his bare arse. Harry moaned and bent forward to take Draco’s lips in an open-mouthed kiss. “Good choice.” He removed their shirts and rocked their hips together.
“Is everything all right, Prongslet?” Sirius asked, guiding him down a hallway and into a very lavish sitting room.
“Headmaster, I just had a dream,” he said, “a vivid dream that Arthur Weasley was attacked by a snake in the Ministry. I—I’ve had dreams before, nightmares, everyone has, but this was different. I swear it was. I—Please, send someone to the Ministry. Just to be sure, I care about Mr. Weasley and he’s a—”
Malfoy's hand moved from Harry's chest to his hip and gripped his side tightly. His slim fingers poked just barely under Harry's jeans and dug into the skin right above his arse.
“I was wondering… do you think your parents would be okay with me going to visit Sirius tomorrow? Just for a few hours? I have to talk to him and Remus about some things. The whole dating-Draco-Malfoy thing being one of them,” Harry said.
Draco kissed Harry’s forehead. “I have something we can do,” he suggested. Harry rose an eyebrow. “Get dressed, I’ll show you what it is.” Harry slid off the desk and quickly threw on his sweater from Mrs. Weasley and warm trousers, following Draco out of the house and towards the frozen rows of corn out in the field.
“If one twin likes you, the other will as well,” Harry explained with a shrug. “Must be a twin thing. They're practically the same person split in two. Finish each other's sentences, finish each other's classes, finish each other's homework—”
me to fuck you? Because that can be arranged. I could fuck you so hard, I could do it right here, right now, that you won’t be able to stand. I’d have to carry you back.” Harry whined in response. “I should. Fuck, Potter. I’d love to see you take it right now.” He rocked his hips into Harry’s and Harry moaned. Draco bit his neck lightly. “You’d have to be quiet. We don’t want people to hear and walk up on us, now, would we?”
“I do not squeak,” he said indignantly. Ron shrugged and dragged him out of bed and downstairs where the whole Weasley family was waiting in front of the Christmas tree. Harry yawned again and rubbed the sleep from his eyes with the heels of his palms.
“Baby, you'll be all right. It's all going to be fine, yeah? I don't need their approval to have feelings for you. And I don't need their approval to act on those feelings.” Draco planted a kiss on Harry's head. Harry moved his face and his nose brushed Draco's neck. Draco shivered and his breathing halted.
“Or…” Harry hummed, walking backwards towards his bed and pulling Draco with him, “you could get undressed.”
Harry smiled when Draco's lips moved to his neck. Draco chuckled into his skin. “I see that smile,” he murmured. “Open your eyes.” Harry did and turned his head to look at his boyfriend.
Less than six minutes later, Draco was coming down Harry’s throat with a groan. Harry swallowed and pulled off with a deep breath. Draco pulled Harry up and kissed him.
Draco joined him a moment later and reached into his own pocket, pulling out a short silver chain. He blushed a pretty pink color that spread across his cheeks and handed it to Harry. The bracelet had a thin silver chain and clasp, and a silver flat piece engraved with what seemed to be a date. “Wh—is this…”
“Yes, but I’m a perfectionist.” He planted a kiss on Harry’s forehead and they walked back to Ron and Hermione’s compartment.
He whimpered at the entrance of the third finger. It burned, and Draco paused to let Harry get used to it. When he nodded, Draco immediately crooked his fingers again, with more force than the last time he did it, and they shoved up against Harry’s prostate instead of just brushing it. Harry shouted and reached up to grab Draco’s shoulder, digging his fingers into the soft skin. He shuddered and his following gasp was drowned out by Draco’s mouth over his. He arched up, searching for more friction, but got none.
The doorknob clicked, and Ron looked at it hopefully. Malfoy’s face appeared in the crack of the doorway, and Ron saw red around his eyes. “Do you want to come in?”
Harry hissed softly. Draco’s eyes widened and he sat up, scrambling to get a parchment and quill out. “Draco?”
“Vernon likes throwing things. The first heavy thing he can get his hands on. I quickly learned to duck from flying objects. Dudley is big enough that he could easily sit on me until I pass out. He likes to rough me up, bruise me a bit. Sometimes break a few bones. Until I was eleven, until Hagrid knocked down the door and personally handed me my Hogwarts acceptance letter on my birthday, I had to sleep in the cupboard under the stairs.”
“Y—you have no idea what—Draco, my nightmare—” he stammered into Draco’s shoulder. “Y—you were—you had red eyes, and—and grey skin. You were so cold. Your veins were black, and your fingernails were long… it was like you were him. Like you—were Voldemort. I c—I could hear you, asking—asking what was wrong, but—it was like I was—hallucinating everything.” He sniffled. “Did—I thought I heard something break. Did my magic get out of control?” he asked.
“What, you mean like my wand?” Harry interrupted. Draco looked at Harry curiously. “Ollivander said my wand's twin was Voldemort's because the feathers in our wands were from the same phoenix.”
“Umm…” Harry stopped doing it. “I think I did it wrong.” Draco sighed from beside him and moved Harry’s hand gently out of the way.
“I’m going to make you come until you’re a shaking, crying mess,” Draco agreed lowly. “The only thing you’ll be moaning is my name. Over. And over. And over.” He punctuated each sentence with a bite up to Harry’s ear.  “You’ll be having dry orgasms and you’ll be so full of come that you won’t be able to breathe without it spilling out of your arse.” Harry whined and nodded.
“Because I like it, and you love me.” Draco rolled his eyes but grabbed the book and leaned into Harry’s arms anyway. “So… tell me about these Horcruxes.” Harry wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist. Draco shifted in Harry’s arms and somehow managed to snuggle closer. Harry grinned. “I told you you’d like it.”
“That’s his neck!” he exclaimed. Draco snickered and slid off the couch, onto his knees on the floor. The cat looked at him and placed a paw on his cheek. Draco’s face split into a grin.
“What's it say?” Ron asked. Harry handed it to him, knowing that it was really nothing terrible. Ron read through it and gave it to Hermione.
“Do you really?” Malfoy asked quietly, moving to nip some more at Harry's jaw and neck. Harry's previously clenched fists loosened and he felt his face heat and heart beat faster. Malfoy stuck his tongue in the small dip of Harry's collarbone before sucking on it lightly. Harry felt himself start to get traitorously hard and he tried to move away again.
“I lied, before,” Harry admitted. “To Dumbledore about that dream with the snake and Arthur Weasley.” Draco hummed in curiosity. “I wasn't watching the snake attack him. I was the snake attacking him.”
“What did you two do while you were gone?” Hermione asked suspiciously. Harry shrugged and looked down at Draco with a small grin. Draco rose an eyebrow and smirked.
“Mhm. I’d say around a month’s worth of it, or more if we want to be overly sentimental and look at all the paintings and explore the decor first.” Harry laughed and grabbed the sides of Draco’s face, kissing him firmly and briefly.
“Harry, what a lovely surprise,” he said brightly, “what brings you here? You should have called first; we would have cleaned up the house a bit to make it more presentable.” Harry shrugged guiltily, and Remus shook his head. “Ah, well, it's no matter. I'm glad you're here.”
He was suddenly very awake when he saw who was sitting on the couch with a cup of tea in his hand, talking to Arthur solemnly.
Harry sat up abruptly, throwing the blanket off his legs. “I—I—I need to see Dumbledore,” he gasped. He hissed in pain and brought his hand up to his forehead. Draco held his shoulder and turned Harry to face him with concerned eyes.
“Sorry, I just saw… I wasn’t thinking…” Draco trailed off and bit his lip, stuffing his hands into his sweatshirt pocket. Harry swallowed shakily and his gaze swiveled back to Dumbledore.
After a moment of heavy breathing and getting steadily more aroused, Harry groaned and moved to sit on Draco's thighs and kiss him. “Fuck, I've missed you so much.”
“I'm serious,” Draco said, “you could pull it off very well.” He leaned forward, lips barely brushing Harry's. “I love you.”
Harry hummed in affirmation, memorizing Draco's blissed out expression. He frowned after a moment. “Draco…” The blond arched an eyebrow. “What’s going to happen after the winter hols?”
“Harry, I would love to say it's perfect, but frankly, I'm not exactly sure what it is,” Draco said after finishing unwrapping it, inspecting the cardboard box curiously.
“Someone's here to see you, mate,” Fred urged. Harry frowned and walked down the staircase, hands stuffed in the pocket of the sweater Draco had given him.
“I mean… I dunno, I've noticed other… blokes before, and found them attractive,” Ron gestured his hands awkwardly in the air.
“Say that again,” Draco demanded. “Weasley, say that again, in those exact words.” Ron did. “I know of something like that. I read about it or heard about it, it’s some ancient, Dark magic. Worse than Blood magic. I remember my father shutting me up about the subject incredibly quickly. He yelled at me to never ask about it again. It’s an evil practice, not just Dark magic. It’s pure evil. You have to be a sadistic bastard to do something like it, I just can’t—I can’t place it!” he groaned. “Damn it!”
"Shut up, Harry." Ron shoved his shoulder and stuck his tongue out at Harry. Harry grinned and rested his head atop Hermione's.
Draco heaved in air and bit Harry’s earlobe. “Gods, you’re so tight, Harry. Do you like this? Do you like feeling me fuck you?” Harry nodded minutely.
“I mean… if I wanted to try it with a bloke, y—yeah, I guess,” Ron stammered. Harry rose an eyebrow.
Harry grabbed Draco's upper arms tightly. “Draco!" He took a deep breath. “You're spiraling. Calm down.” Draco exhaled sharply and nodded.
“Is the rest of you just from quidditch too?” Draco asked pointedly. Harry blushed. “Didn’t think so. Shut up, Potter.”
“N—no,” Harry gasped. “We wouldn’t.” Draco moved his hands down to Harry’s arse and squeezed it tightly. Harry let his head fall back against the tree and bit his lip to quiet his moan.
Draco placed a hand on the small of his back to support him silently. Harry leaned into the touch and sighed. “Thank you, Headmaster,” he mumbled. Dumbledore nodded solemnly and Harry and Draco took that as their queue to leave.
“I don’t know why you bother having Potter do that, Hannah, Draco’s obviously a top,” Zabini chimed in. “He’s the one that would be feeling Potter up.” Harry chose not to mention the hand that was currently in his lap and rubbing him through his denim.
“My turn,” George said loudly. “I’ve never had a crush on a Slytherin.” Harry, Hermione and Ron drank. “Oh? Ronniekins, who’s the lover?” Ron reddened.
“Well…” Harry shifted on his feet and avoided eye contact. “When I was over at Grimmauld Place yesterday, I might have invited Sirius, Remus, and Draco to the New Years’ Eve thing… and they might have agreed to come.” Mrs. Weasley sat in a dining chair and beckoned Harry to sit beside her. He did. “I’m sorry, it was last minute, but I never see Remus or Sirius anymore, and Draco was there, and I—”
Draco kissed his cheek. “It will be. I'll make it okay.” He stood up and pulled the shower curtain closed so it covered Harry's body up. He walked out of the room, returning with Hermione in tow right as Harry was washing his hair.
,” Draco finally snapped, troubled look on his face. Harry rose an eyebrow and looked Draco up and down. “I know how I act, but that’s all it is. An act. I’m used to getting what I want and now there’s a chance that I won’t. I don’t do well with competition.”
“Who put those other marks on your neck?” Harry froze and his gaze crept up to Draco, who was smirking again. “The faded ones, not the ones Malfoy just gave you.”
“I do. I want them to accept you, Draco. You—you mean a lot to me, and I'd like if they made an effort to at least tolerate you.”
“Blimey, she'll be getting quite a lot of books for Christmas, then,” Ron said with a grin. “I'm pretty sure we all got her studying material and parchment and such. I got her a huge book that is filled with misspellings that I think she'll love. You're supposed to find them and correct them, and it's around four hundred pages long. And it was surprisingly cheap. I guess nobody wanted to take the time to go through and fix it, but Hermione loves books, correcting things, and schoolwork.”
“Absolutely not!” Hermione cried. “Malfoy, if you think Snape won’t lie to Harry or just run along and tell You-Know-Who that something’s wrong with Harry, you’ve lost your mind!”
“Why do you think I wear them, Draco?” Harry purred. “It keeps you staring.” The pressure on his arse was a lot, now, and Draco canted his hips up, searching for more friction. Harry fell forward in surprise and caught himself by the hands on Draco’s chest.
“Harry, is he… you know… right now?” Harry swallowed thickly. His face burned as he nodded. “We’re in public!” Hermione whispered furiously. Harry’s other hand clenched around a fork as Draco tongued at his slit.
“It’s been far too long since we’ve done something like this,” he said, voice rough. Harry nodded in enthused agreement. Draco took Harry’s cock back into his mouth, swallowing him down to the base.
“Hey, Ginny,” he said, gratefully accepting the cup of hot cocoa that Mrs. Weasley offered. “How've you been?”
“I do have one question, though,” Harry murmured. Draco hummed. “Why did you lie about who it was that you were talking to?” Draco sighed.
“And that’s why we’re going to be subtle, but not keep us a secret anymore,” Draco murmured. “Just… subtle, at first. To warm people up to the idea.” He kissed the tip of Harry’s nose. “Then we can have as much PDA as we want.” Harry laughed and shook his head. “What is it?”
“Wait—I didn't mean it like that,” Harry rushed, sitting upright and leaning over Draco. “It was more than ideal. You're quite talented at fucking me into the mattress until I scream. And I'd like you to do it again soon.” A slow smirk formed on Draco's lips.
“Move over.” Harry turned around and looked at Draco in confusion. “Scoot over, Potter.” Harry complied, shuffling backward so there was enough room for another person on the bed. Draco took off his shirt and climbed under the covers next to Harry, wrapping an arm around his waist and hugging him close. “We’re not speaking of this.” A hand carded through his hair gently.
“What? No,” Harry said. He tried to take a step but fell against Draco’s chest. “Um. Maybe a little?” he amended. Draco sighed. “I’m sorry, I didn’t know how strong it was. Please don’t be mad.”
“I think that would look amazing on you,” Draco murmured, stroking Harry's hair softly. “I'm sorry I snapped at you when I told you what was happening with the Mark. I was scared, and I didn't know what reaction you would have.”
Harry hummed and kissed Draco again softly. “I would say that you are currently in a rough spot with your family and that it's risky to take a chance like that, and I don't want you to get hurt. But also that it's a very nice gesture, and I've never been outside of England besides Hogwarts, and you’re very thoughtful for inviting me to Amsterdam.” Draco grabbed his hands and intertwined their fingers.
They froze when the door opened. Harry pulled off and quickly climbed onto the bed, pulling the sheets over them both. Their charms were dissolved and the curtains pulled back. Harry closed his eyes in an attempt at feigning sleep to Snape, who it inevitably was. He heard Draco sigh in relief and Harry poked his head up to see a house-elf holding a cup of tea in his bony little fingers.
The front door squeaked open, and Harry looked over Draco's shoulder to see Sirius in the doorway. Draco turned as well and undid the silencing charm.
“All right. Well, good night, everyone,” Hermione said quietly. Harry heard the door click shut and he easily started falling back asleep before hearing Ron's voice from above him.
“Well, I’m glad you’re coming to terms with your sexuality, then, Ron,” he chuckled. Ron shoved his shoulder again, and he nearly fell off the twin bed.
“No, of course, you’ll stay here, don’t be ridiculous.” Sirius waved his hand at nothing and continued, “you’re my cousin and you won’t be staying in any trashy hotels as long as I have this house.” Draco smiled brightly, and Harry’s stomach jumped and did a flip at the sight. It was just a smile, he should not have been so affected by it.
new chapter! lots of people were asking for the new chapter, and its finally here. so i hope you all like it as much as the last two. more coming next week!
“You’re so… willing,” Draco murmured in astonishment. “How? You don’t seem put off or nervous at all.”
“‘Course not.” He looked back at the camera and shrieked in surprise when he felt a tongue on each of his cheeks, not even noticing Mrs. Weasley take another photo. His arms dropped from around his friends and he ran over to Molly, scrubbing his sleeves over his cheeks. “You guys are terrible!” he cried. The twins laughed and Fred ran towards him. Harry darted away, and he nearly made it through the kitchen before Fred picked him up by the torso and carried him over his shoulder back to the living room.
“Chamomile, I suppose,” Harry said helplessly. Winky bowed and popped back away. Harry felt exhaustion overcome his body and his eyelids drooped, adrenaline and shock and fear leaving him.
“I don’t like giving up on things,” Harry said, “and you’re going to have to deal with that for quite a while.” He paused. "Did you say you want me?" He saw Draco blush for the first time today, and he silently cheered at his accomplishment.
“Wow, Harry,” George commented through a mouthful of potatoes, “Malfoy’s seriously got you wrapped around his finger.”
“Harry, do come over and stand next to Ron and Hermione,” Molly said encouragingly, camera in hand. Harry did as requested and Ron placed him right between him and Hermione, wrapping an arm around Harry’s shoulders casually. Harry wrapped both his arms around his friends’ necks.
“Something like that. Anyway, my mother finally told me about her. She had said she writes Aunt Andromeda around holidays, so I nicked the address off a letter that Mother was sending to the Muggle post office—can you believe my
“Okay,” he whispered. Draco pulled his wand out and murmured a spell that Harry had never heard before. Suddenly, the room filled with thousands of stars and constellations.
“Hey, Cho.” Harry rested a comforting hand on her shoulder. She looked over and wiped the tears from her cheeks.
“You don’t want to do that,” he warned. He grabbed her arm tightly when he felt Draco pulling his cock out of his jeans and pants.
“I thought Hufflepuff was supposed to be the angelic House,” he grumbled as Draco walked over to him and dropped his knees on either side of Harry’s outstretched legs, sitting on his thighs. Another one of those feral grins appeared on Draco’s face.
“I'm coming, little cousin!” Sirius called. He walked down the stairs and set a hand on Draco's shoulder. “How's it at home? Is anyone giving you a hard time?”
Harry woke up with a dull ache in his back. He was still in Draco’s arms; he looked up to be met with silver eyes already staring at him. Harry frowned and yawned. “Were you watching me sleep?”
“What—no! I'm not insane! My family is here!” Harry cried. Everyone at the table had queasy looks or were glaring at George. The twin must have noticed because he cast a silencing spell around himself, Harry, and Fred so that nobody else could hear their conversation.
“I was walking back to the dorm and that arse just grabbed my wrist and wouldn’t let go,” Harry grumbled, “started saying shit about me and how he could ‘take care of me’.” Harry scoffed and shook his head. “I’m not someone that just goes around letting anyone who wants to fuck me do it.” He dropped onto the ground in front of his trunk and opened it, rifling through it to find his robes.
Their pace quickened after finding an easier way for Harry to move, which was using his thighs to push himself up and come back down. “Draco—” Harry’s voice broke off and he gasped, his head falling backward in surrender to bliss. “God.”
“Excuse you, that was entirely your fault!” he cried. “You were being an arse, and Professor Moody came in and turned you into a ferret because you were so rude. Although, I have to admit, him throwing you around in the air like that made me feel just a little bit bad for you. And when you smacked against the ground, even Ron flinched.”
Draco pointed across the room. “That one, over there. Personally, I don't think it looks anything like a dragon, but…” Harry followed his finger and saw a constellation that really just looked like a curved line to him.
Draco traced the side of Harry's face with the light pads of his fingertips. Harry closed his eyes and leaned into the comforting touch. “Harry,” Draco whispered. He made an odd, choked humming noise in the back of his throat. “Where do they live?” Harry's eyes flew open.
“I heard you yawn,” Hermione said softly. “You do make a tiny noise.” Harry groaned and the trio of friends all started laughing right when the camera flashed. Molly chuckled.
Draco’s fingers found their way into Harry’s hair and Draco moaned quietly. Harry looked up at his face through his own eyelashes and saw Draco’s head leaned back, the front of his throat exposed and skin taught. Draco thrust harder, and Harry gagged slightly. He could feel a steady stream of drool dripping from his lower lip. He could also feel the beginnings of tears pricking at the sides of his eyes, but Draco felt so good in his mouth that Harry didn’t care.
“I'm glad the two of them decided to move back into Grimmauld. Maybe they’ll fix it up a bit. Quite gloomy, that house,” Mr. Weasley mused with a little smile.
“Did you just call me a whore?” Harry teased, accepting a quick kiss. “Only yours, love.” Draco rolled his eyes. “What is a Horcrux?”
"I don't love when my boyfriend is exhausted because he stayed up all night worrying," Harry replied sternly."Go to bed." He stood and pushed Draco all the way down the stairs, only stopping in front of the fireplace. He placed a handful of Floo powder into Draco's hand and kissed him one more time. "I love you."
He stepped back. “Wait!” he cried. She leaned back in surprise. “I'm seeing someone! I—Idon'twanttokissyou,” Harry rushed out. Cho turned red.
“Mate, what's that around your neck?” Ron asked curiously. He walked toward Harry and looked closer at it. “A promise ring?” Harry blushed. “Well, shit. When did this happen?”
The next day, Harry hadn’t seen Draco all day and was getting worried. At dinner he didn’t show up and Harry sat at the Gryffindor table, frowning across the Hall at the absence of a blond head.
Harry sighed and frowned. “Fine. But you owe me when we get back after hols.” He stood on his tiptoes to kiss Draco slowly. “Thank you.” Draco rose an eyebrow.
“Draco.” Harry shuddered and gasped, head falling forward, heavy breaths blowing against Draco's neck. Harry felt his eyebrows knit together as he moaned and rode out his orgasm, rocking back and forth weakly on Draco's cock as he came between their stomachs.
“Hmm… yes,” Harry admitted. “I don’t want you getting in trouble or hurt or dragged back to live with that psychopath against your will.”
“Bullshit.” Harry looked at Draco again. “You’re lying. What’s going on? Was it Abbott’s Dare? Or Marietta’s?” Harry didn’t answer. “You’re being difficult, Harry.” He looked up to Draco at the use of his first name. “Don’t read too far into it,” Draco warned. “Tell me what’s going on.”
"I'm sure they'll do quite all right," Draco assured. "I love you, Harry. I don't care about what they think anymore."
Draco bit roughly at Harry’s skin and continued to fuck into him. Harry was nearly sobbing and reached around to grab Draco’s hip for stability.
“Well, I—I'm… bi?” Harry said after a moment, voice rising into a question for no reason at all. “And—and I'm kind of… seeing someone—a—a boy, I'm dating a boy from school, and—” He broke off awkwardly, cheeks fuming very hot. He burrowed further into Draco's sweatshirt.
“Oh, that’s Freddie,” Sirius mused. “He loves chin scratches.” Harry curiously scratched right under Freddie’s mouth, and the cat did nothing. Just blinked at him with confused blue eyes.
“I’ve been planning something,” Malfoy said, “something really big and really… over the top romantic. We never officially went on a first date, so I wanted to make up for it. My mother and Blaise have been helping me. With some… altered information on her part, at least. But I couldn’t let him know, so I just pretended like I wasn’t in touch with my mother to keep it a secret. I was excited because I was going to show him tomorrow, and... Harry’s been having dreams. When I said something was stressful, I meant the situation. Not him. Fuck, this all sounds… so bad when I say it out loud,” he exhaled. Ron nodded in agreement.
Harry turned his head and scowled at the plank of wood above him where Ron lied. “I just fucking might, maybe we'll do it tomorrow if you don't let me fucking sleep,” he said seriously. “I'm tired and drunk and I don't want to be discussing my sex life with anyone except Draco because he's the only other person that is relevant to it. Shut up.” He curled back against Draco's chest.
“I am—essentially—a house-elf to them whenever I'm there. Think of any chore, I do it. Cleaning the floor with bleach until it sparkles. Washing dishes. Scrubbing the couch. Washing the bathtub.
“It was good. I told Sirius and Remus about Draco and I. They took it well. Sirius said it's unexpected but if it works, then he can't say anything about it.”
Molly surprisingly moved to hug him, and Draco surprisingly returned it with ease. Harry smiled softly at the sight.
Harry stumbled through the Weasleys’ fireplace in their living room and saw Mr. and Mrs. Weasley sitting on the couch and drinking tea while holding hands.
“I've never liked Lucius Malfoy, but telling his fifteen-year-old that he'll be taking You-Know-Who’s Mark and not giving him a choice… I've more than half a mind to go turn him into the Wizengamot at once,” Mr. Weasley grumbled.
"What about your family?" Harry asked worriedly. "I don't want you relationship with them to be even more sour."
“You were under no obligation to let either of us into this part of your life, and you still did. And even though it's a hard discussion for you to have, you still told us. It shows you respect us, and respect goes both ways,” Remus explained. Harry smiled and accepted the hug that Sirius offered.
“Harry, it’s okay,” she said calmly. “I adore Draco, he’s very charming, and I’d love to see the others again. Anyway, I already over-estimated and bought way too many groceries, since Charlie and Bill can’t come this year, so I’m glad I can put them to use now.” Harry smiled in relief.
“Merlin's balls, Harry,” Ron groaned, “I love you mate and I'm happy that you're happy, but honestly if you tell me one more time about how bloody perfect Draco Malfoy is, I'm going to hit you.”
“Look, Harry, it’s your choice, but Dumbledore isn’t always in his right mind.” Harry frowned slightly. “I’m not pressuring you into speaking to someone else, but the Headmaster is very biased towards you anyway. It’s very likely he’ll sugar-coat what’s going on if something is the matter at all. I’m just saying that maybe we should find someone who will tell you the whole truth and not leave parts out. If something is going on, and Dumbledore doesn’t tell you exactly what it is, then someone could get hurt because of it.”
“Wow. All right. Um, I…” She sighed again. “I wasn’t expecting that. I don’t want to be that friend that controls your life, but please hear what I’m saying.” Harry nodded. “Whatever you do, be one hundred percent sure that you’re going to be safe. And that if he wants you to do something you’re not comfortable with, leave. Get out of there as fast as you can.”
Sitting on the sofa, a white cat jumped up on Harry’s lap and chirruped. It yawned and curled up in a ball, glaring at Harry until he started petting it.
“What—fuck,” he cursed. He ran to the corner and peered around it, to see a blond head turning the next one. Harry caught up to him and grabbed Draco’s shoulder, pushing him into an empty classroom.
Neville’s jaw was hanging open. Harry smiled awkwardly and laughed. “Yeah, we’re… erm. Dating.” Neville continued to gape. “Please don’t tell anyone. He’s not out to his parents, and his home situation… well, if he were to be publicly dating me, it wouldn’t be very good for him at all.”
“I dare you to eat one of your own Puking Pastilles.” George shrugged and went to grab the box of Weasley’s treats that were supposed to be banned by Umbridge. (But nobody gave a shit what that old toad wanted, so…)
“I guess,” Harry grumbled under his breath, mock reluctantly. He wasn’t mad at Draco, he couldn’t be. And it was a good blowjob so he couldn’t complain. He leaned forward and rested his face in the crook of Draco’s neck, arms wrapped around under Draco’s waist. One of Draco’s hands came up to card through his hair, the other presumably still holding his book above Harry’s back.
So that's why he always diverted Harry when Harry tried to go after his neck. “This is a turn-on for you,” Harry realized. Draco's blush only deepened.
Draco tugged Harry’s pants off and grabbed the base of Harry’s cock firmly, licking a stripe of saliva along the underside before pushing it past his lips. Harry moaned and Draco’s free hand came up and entwined their fingers together.
“That you were one of a kind, but not because you survived the Killing Curse, because you're an idiot, and the only person I've ever really cared about,” Draco replied in confusion. “What is this about?”
“I think you should. A lot of people are in it, even some Slytherins. Hermione, Ron and I started it because Umbridge isn’t teaching us anything of use.”
The door to the compartment slid open and Neville walked out of it. “Hey, Harry.” He glanced at Draco and his eyebrows creased in confusion.
“We can do that when you’re sober, Harry,” Draco hummed into his hair. Harry tucked himself into Draco's chest.
"Considering how we got together, that's not completely out of the question, actually," he admitted with an uncharacteristically high-pitched laugh. Everyone stared at him with wide eyes. Draco laughed softly.
“I was already doing that, but yes, I suppose now that you have my sweater we are the perfect stereotypical couple now.”
“I know. Just let me deal with it, yeah? He’s been a lot different this year.” They nodded reluctantly. “Thanks. I’m actually supposed to go somewhere with him later today.”
Harry shook him, tears building in his eyes. Cold hands with long fingernails (again, something Draco never had) caught his wrists, and Draco looked into Harry’s face. Harry yanked his hands from Draco’s grip after seeing beady red eyes instead of the soft grey ones he was used to. “Draco?” he asked, voice quivering. “Where’s—”
“I think that You-Know-Who is a manipulative bastard and that if Malfoy doesn't willingly take the Dark Mark, he'll find a way to threaten him into taking it. Malfoy isn't a Gryffindor, Harry, and if he gets scared enough he'll probably do something to save himself.” Harry sighed heavily.
“No.” Draco shook his head. “You're mine now, Potter, you can't get away from me that easily.” Harry smiled and dropped a lazy kiss on Draco's lips before lying his head on Draco's chest.
“Shove off, Harry!” he groaned. “I mean… I guess… he's… his skin looks really soft,” he admitted with a choppy shrug. “And he has really nice eyes, and when he does that little half-smirk it’s really…” Ron trailed off.
“I was thinking... that we hadn’t seen each other all day and I wanted to make sure you knew that I haven’t forgotten about you quite yet.” He grinned and leaned up to kiss Harry. Harry frowned. “You look good when you’re mad.”
Harry didn’t make eye contact with Draco when they separated. He was quite embarrassed. “Um… I’m going to go up to bed,” he said quietly, face flaming. Draco moved off his lap with a frown and Harry stood up, stuffing his hands in his pockets as he walked to the Slytherin dorm.
He started to feel slightly uncomfortable when Draco trailed kisses down his mouth and jaw, landing on his pulse point and began sucking avidly and determinedly to leave a giant bruise on Harry’s neck. It was only uncomfortable because now he felt people staring at his face, instead of something else on him. He bit down hard on his lip to stop from making any noise.
“I wanted to give you something,” Draco murmured. He locked the door. Harry rose an eyebrow and sat on a cushioned bench.
A soft voice and something warm behind his ear caused Harry to stir from sleep. The warmth moved to his jaw.
They both turned at hearing a loud shattering sound. Ginny was standing there, broken glass and a puddle of pumpkin juice surrounding her feet.
“He's not like how you think he is. He's not like how he was. He's nice. He cares, a lot. He's funny, and comforting, smart, and witty. His smile, Ron. And his eyes. Just—everything. Did you know he has dimples? His hair is so soft, and sometimes he hums quietly when he's doing homework.”
Harry snorted. “You have no room to talk, George,” he reminded helpfully. George grinned. Draco chuckled.
“I mainly don’t want to see you get hurt, Harry. And I can say that Ron doesn’t want that either,” Hermione said reasonably. He sighed.
He awoke to someone shaking him. He turned around and saw Ron in his pyjamas shaking his shoulder. “What?”
“I’ll pay you back,” Draco muttered, sticking the candy horizontally on the parchment, connecting drawing-Harry’s and Voldemort’s heads.
There was silence at the other end of the door. “Malfoy… I know you love him, too,” Ron said softly. “I don’t like you, but I do love Harry. He’s my brother. I’m doing this for him. He’s devastated, so please, just—open the door.”
Draco looked at him, obviously trying to contain a laugh. His efforts failed quickly, and he pulled Harry into a comforting hug, chuckling.
“Tu es beau, mon amour,” Draco replied. “You don't need to know what it means. Not yet.” Harry frowned, puzzled, but nodded. “Now, I really need to get to Prefect duties.” Harry sighed and nodded, standing up from where he had somehow ended up straddling Draco's thighs. Draco stood up as well and pulled Harry into one last strong kiss before kissing his cheek and hugging him, leaving afterward.
“I make food, clean up afterward. If I don’t do something perfectly, I get punished.” Draco moved away and looked at him worriedly. “I get pushed around a lot. Petunia’s form of showing displeasure is mostly harsh, jeweled backhands to my face that leave it stinging for hours. She particularly enjoys when her rings cut my cheek and make it bleed.
“You’re so sensitive,” Draco purred. His other hand came to haul Harry up by the shoulder so that his chest was pressed against Harry’s back. He wrapped an arm around Harry in not a possessive way but in a protective, reassuring way. He kissed Harry’s cheek. “Harry.” Harry choked on his breath. “Baby, look at me.” Harry tilted his head to the left, where Draco was speaking into his ear. Draco kissed along the tear tracks on Harry’s face and even Harry’s eyelid before kissing his lips and eliciting a moan. He retracted his fingers and held Harry lightly for a moment before kissing his neck. “How?”
“Okay, one more,” she prompted before everyone could sit back down. Harry regained his composure and smiled at the camera, startling when two people rested their heads on his outstretched arms.
“Hello, boys,” Sirius said, a hint of amusement in his voice. “I'm just going to take a wild guess and say you both are panicking right now because of what was just said?”
“Mm… a short dress,” Draco answered thoughtfully. “Ooh, sheer black lace over dark blue silk. Off-the-shoulder. And figure-hugging for the top half but not the bottom…”
“Pinch him, and then myself, because I'd be dreaming. And then I'd be very confused.” Harry stood up from his chair. “I'm tired. I'm going to bed. Goodnight.” The silencing spell broke and he bid everyone goodnight before walking up to bed.
“He’s a good person once you get to know him, I promise,” Harry assured. Neville gave him a skeptical look. “I swear it. On my life. He's a better person.”
Harry's face flamed up. “I—I—well—to ourselves?” Fred nodded, smirk playing on his lips. “Then, I guess—I mean—umm…”
They sat for a moment, lazily kissing, before cleaning themselves up and walking back to the Burrow.
“I'm not mad. I think… your dad loves you, but he's a bit crazy,” he said. Draco pulled him closer, biting his lip.
“Just you,” he mumbled. Draco nodded and helped him stand, allowing Harry to guide them towards the bathroom.
“Well for one, you’re a world record idiot,” Draco teased. Harry scoffed. He knew it was true, but he'd never admit it. “Oh, stop scowling. Second, you’re the only person I've ever…” He trailed off and blushed, looking away. “That I've ever actually cared about. Third, you're mine, and there is certainly only one person that I decide I want at once. And you have honestly the best arse I've ever seen.” Harry offered him a shy smile. Draco rolled his eyes and grabbed Harry's cheeks and pulled him in for a quick kiss before leaning back. “I should get back, I have to do my Prefect duties.”
“Whoever gave you a good time, I can do better,” the boy said lowly. Harry scoffed and tried to twist his hand out of the kid’s grip, to no avail.
“Actually, I have. I owled a whole Bertie's box full of your Puking Pastilles to Ernie Macmillan one day. He ate half the box in one swallow. Threw up all over Hufflepuff table.” The twins and Draco snickered. Harry's mouth dropped open, and he shoved Draco's shoulder lightly.
After getting settled into the Burrow, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione were all trapped in Ron's bedroom together, Harry turned to Hermione.
“I know, I just… I want all of those things you said before. To not have to pull you into a separate corridor when I want to kiss you between classes, or put up Notice-me-not charms in the common room when I want to lie my head on your shoulder.”
“I like him,” Harry said thoughtfully. “Thanks, Nott.” The boy held up a peace sign with his fingers and then went back to ignoring them. Draco threw a pillow at Harry. “Well, now we’re
. Draco’s free hand came up to frame Harry’s jaw, the other hand holding onto Harry’s still. The long kiss was followed by a series of shorter kisses, Draco and Harry laughing like little kids and smiling against each other’s lips.
Lightning crashed again, and Draco looked at the sky with a flinch. “No, but that might.” Harry rolled his eyes.
“Honestly. That's the worst kind of taking advantage of the underage wizard laws.” Percy scolded. And for once, Harry had to agree with him.
“My father taught me over the summer. He pulled a few strings and I'm now allowed to do lots more than a normal fifteen year old wizard,” Draco replied.
“I dunno. Like as long as Sirius’, maybe? I want to be able to pull it up out of my face. It would make flying easier, and I want to try something new with it since it doesn't listen to what I tell it to do now. It's just a thought, I might not even do it, but I was just wondering.”
“Yeah.” Harry rolled his eyes. “Geez, Malfoy, trying to kill me already?” he added sarcastically. Draco pulled back and grabbed the sides of Harry's face, looking into his eyes seriously.
“We could stand to leave,” Blaise chimed in. “Or… watch.” Harry turned to him and he was practically drooling at the gossip going around. Dean nodded in shocked agreement.
“I don't want to be those people,” Draco continued, “I don't want to get angry at you when we talk about my parents. I don't have a great relationship with my father, and I haven’t grown up in a very emotionally supportive household. I'm aware that what you went through was astronomically worse. I just have a hard time talking about my family because I still love them and I still miss them.” Harry nodded in understanding.
“I love you,” Draco repeated. Harry nodded quickly and smiled before kissing him again with a quiet whine of satisfaction in the back of his throat.
“Uhh—” Draco gripped tighter and pulled Harry harder against his groin. “Charms… Harry, we need to put up charms,” he groaned. Harry huffed and fumbled for his wand in the nightstand and cast silencing and locking charms. He shoved the piece of wood under the bed and returned to snogging Draco breathless. He moved down the blond’s body and pulled the silk black pyjama trousers off along with Draco’s pants. Harry wasted no time sucking Draco’s cock down as far as he could into his throat. Draco tangled his hand in Harry’s hair and arched into his mouth. “God, Harry.” Harry looked up and his partner was staring back at him with parted lips and hooded eyes that were blown in a very attractive manner. Draco tightened his grip on Harry’s hair and pushed his hips up suggestively. Harry moaned around Draco, nodding. “Fuck.”
“I know you're trying to help, baby, I do,” he murmured. Harry tucked himself further under Draco's arm. “I’m—fuck—I don't know what to do. I want my father to be proud of me… but I think he's asked too much this time.”
“If I said anything about you, no matter what it was, you know what would happen, right?” he asked. “Look. I love you, Harry. I don’t want anything to happen to you. At all. Ever. I want you to be safe, okay? If my parents—my father, in particular—even have that thought planted in their head… I don’t even want to think about what would happen.” He brushed a lock of hair from Harry’s forehead lightly and kissed it. “It’s not because I don’t want everyone to know how much I care about you, but I don’t want either of us to get hurt.” Draco kissed his lips. “You know that, right?” Harry sighed and nodded.
“You're not even of age,” Harry said softly. “You can't legally make your own life decisions… he's taking advantage of that law. You're his son. And a rather brilliant one, at that. If he's not already proud of you because you're attractive, and smart, and a million other things that would take me hours to say, then maybe you should focus on being proud of yourself and not worry about your father being proud of you.”
The train lurched and Draco bit his lip. “We have to go.” He kissed Harry's forehead before starting to walk away.
“Here? Now? Harry, we’re in your best friend’s bedroom,” Draco scoffed fondly. Harry quirked an eyebrow and bit his lip, attempting to stifle a smile. “Are you serious?” Harry hummed in affirmation. “Harry…” He moved closer and wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist.
“I really can't,” Draco whispered. “I will Floo-call you. And don't forget to write me letters.” Harry bit his lip and nodded, frowning slightly. Draco sighed. “I suppose I can spare a few more minutes.” Harry grinned and leaned into the hands that were cupping his face. “Charles Nichols, the Ravenclaw that grabbed your wrist a couple of weeks ago and then got in a bad accident and had to go to the Hospital wing… I might have been the one who sent him to Pomfrey.”
“Her arm!” he cried. Draco didn’t look at him still, and it clicked in Harry’s brain. “Draco… are you jealous?” No answer. “Are you nervous?” No answer again. “Are you—”
“Fuck, Harry,” Draco heaved, “you’ll make me come so fucking fast if you keep doing this.” Harry would have smiled, but he couldn’t with his mouth full. He instead tightened his throat and momentarily choked before relaxing again. He bobbed his head in sync with Draco’s rough thrusts.
“They won't care,” Ron replied. “As long as Sirius makes sure you don't die, but you'll be fine.” He nudged Harry's shoulder. “Mate, you know that none of us care, right? I mean, I'm not sure if any of us, except maybe Percy, are completely straight. So, if that's been weighing on you, we don't care whether you like blokes or girls or nobody at all, or other people who identify as whatever. It is a bit of a shock that you're dating the ferret, but we'll get over it eventually. And, if he ever hurts you he'll have a whole group of rabid Weasleys set on him.” Harry grinned.
“Don’t take that tone with me, Ronald Weasley,” she warned, “I shouldn’t have let you go. I see you brought Draco back with you, and it truly is lovely to see you again.” Malfoy leaned into Ron’s ear.
Upon looking down, Harry saw more circular bruises on his hips from what looked like fingertips, and he groaned. “That prick,” he grumbled.
“Would you let it go if I said that it's a secret?” he asked. Harry shook his head. “Right. I've been planning something for us in my Prefects’ quarters that I don't use. We never got an official first date, so I made something in my private dorms for us.” Harry smiled into Draco's neck and then shoved his shoulder. “What was that for?!”
"We'll do it somewhere private. Or sneak around the castle," Draco murmured. "How does that sound? Good?"
Draco chuckled and kissed his head again. Harry decided silently that he liked that feeling. “Okay. Sorry, love.”
He had never been this hard in his life. A hand rested softly on his lower back and Harry focused on the warmth of Draco’s palm. After a moment of breathing, he nodded. Draco leaned over his back and kissed Harry’s shoulder.
“Yeah. He does,” he agreed. Harry yawned. “I think I’m going to go to bed, I’m really tired.” He stood up and stretched his arms above his head. “Goodnight, you two.” He clapped a hand on Ron’s shoulder and leaned down to hug Hermione before walking up the staircase and falling onto the bed. Casting a quick Tempus, Harry saw that it was ten-thirty. He placed Draco’s letter on the side table with his wand, rolled over, and fell asleep.
“Mr. Potter, what on earth’s wrong?” Dumbledore asked, hustling out of his personal chambers in his nightgown. Sweat dripped down the side of Harry’s face and he didn’t register it until a sleeved hand wiped it away from his temple lightly. He looked over to Draco, who was blushing.
“I got put in a cupboard probably from day one of being left on their doorstep.” Harry heard Draco repeat the words under his breath, ‘cupboard’ and ‘doorstep’. “It's very likely I never even got held as a baby.” Draco held him tighter at this.
Draco moved a little faster, and a little harder, and he kept making Harry claw at the bedsheets and cry out. “Fuck you, Malfoy, I’m not going to break,” Harry snapped from his pillow, “move faster—
A sudden warm hand on his back startled him and made him jump, hitting his spine painfully on the frame of the bed. He crawled out from under it, a silver gift in hand, with a scowl at Draco.
“He showed up at Grimmauld Place with his bag basically overflowing. Said he was leaving and Sirius is letting him stay with them for a while.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “You’re a shit liar,” he declared, drawing his wand. He walked over and grabbed Harry’s wrist, pointing the tip of his wand at the raw skin and murmuring a healing charm. The pain went away and Harry gave a tiny smile as thanks before going back through his trunk to look for his tie.
Harry frowned and glanced at Draco. Draco shrugged next to him and kissed his temple lightly. Harry exhaled heavily when Draco's mouth reached his earlobe.
Draco kissed him. It was nothing like one of their usual kisses. It was soft and gentle, and Harry dared to think that Draco was being
Ron seemed taken off guard by the question but after a moment, he said, "of course. What do you mean, 'do I want a hug.'" He scoffed. "I always want a hug." He walked up and wrapped his arms around Harry and Hermione's back and rested his head on her shoulder, sandwiching her between him and Harry.
I am so, so, sorry. I honestly have nothing to say for myself. I've been putting off posting this chapter because I'm not sure how well it's going to fit into the story, but I'm going to do it anyway. I really hope all you like it and I know I haven't posted in around four months. I've been trying to perfect it.
“Shh, it’s okay, baby,” Draco whispered throatily, “just wait for a little longer.” Harry dug his nails into Draco’s skin. “Fuck, Harry, you’re so perfect,” Draco murmured. Harry whimpered. Draco’s rhythm faltered, and he slammed into Harry a few more times before he was stroking Harry’s cock again as they both came loudly, shaking and resting their heads on each other’s shoulders.
“Because that absolutely makes me want to run out the door,” he teased. Harry grabbed his cheeks and kissed him.
“My birthday is July 31st. I don’t really have a favorite color, but I guess I’ve always liked blue. My favorite food is anything raspberry, and my favorite dessert is treacle tarts.”
“Hm. That’s why I borrowed your cloak,” Draco murmured. Harry sighed. Draco kissed him lightly. “Forgive me?”
“Thank you,” he mumbled. Draco wrapped his arms around Harry and returned the tight embrace. “I love it.” Harry frowned after a moment and pulled away slightly to look Draco in the face. “I've not gotten you anything yet. I usually go shopping with Ron and Hermione over the hols in Diagon Alley right before Christmas. I'll get you something as well.” Harry shrugged. “What do you want? I mean, your family has enough money for a moderately sized country…”
Draco added another finger and it went easily enough. The lube definitely helped. They were continuously brushing Harry's knot of nerves and he could feel himself tensing as he got closer to coming. Draco pulled off his cock with a pop and Harry whined, which turned into a moan when he felt the jolt of pleasure again. Draco moved up to kiss him. It was light, soft and almost reassuring. The discomfort Harry had initially felt was gone, entirely replaced by pleasure. He was gasping and arching his back with every stroke. “Mo—Draco, more,” he said shakily.
“Ravenclaws are smart, but they’re assholes,” Draco said. Harry absentmindedly rubbed his mildly sore wrist. “Did he hurt you?” Harry looked up at him.
“Listening. Being there. I dunno, everything?” Draco smiled fondly at him. To Harry's surprise, he reached down and picked him up by the arse, Harry flailing for half a second before wrapping his legs around Draco's slim waist and latching his ankles together. Draco looked up at Harry and kissed a soft trail of tiny kisses from his jaw that led to Harry's shoulder. Harry wrapped his arms around Draco's neck and kissed his forehead. “They don't understand. They don't see you like this.”
“We—um…” Harry looked up to Draco, silently asking if it was okay to tell Neville. Draco shrugged and even planted a kiss on Harry’s head before whispering, “I’ll be inside.”
Harry wiped his cheeks with his sleeves and wrapped his arms loosely around Draco's waist. “Okay.” He smiled uneasily.
“I don’t want to think about it. I want you to fuck me,” Harry said, lust overcoming slight irritation.
“Harry… what—” Draco tried to say, but Harry cut him off by kissing him. Draco gave in for a moment before pushing Harry back slightly. “Harry, tell me what’s going on.”
"Of course, Harry. And remember; You have nothing to be afraid of. You did nothing wrong. You protected yourself and your cousin from a Dementor." Harry nodded uneasily and Mr. Weasley clapped his shoulder before straightening up again. "Well, good. You'll be fine. This is all just procedure." With that, he swept away down the hallway that they had just come from. Harry took a deep breath to steady himself and opened the doors to see what seemed like a full Wizengamot. He sat down in the thronelike seat several feet below the Judge's desk(which was really just where Cornelius Fudge was sitting, clearly trying to attempt the holier-than-thou and the high-and-mighty looks and failing miserably).
“I don’t know, but how is he going to get out?” Harry whined quietly as the warmth of Draco's mouth engulfed him. He set both his forearms on the table and tensed. Draco licked a fat stripe up the underside of his cock and Harry inhaled sharply.
Molly stood up and clambered over dozens of children's feet to Harry and Draco. “I'm so sorry, dears,” she scoffed fondly, shaking her head, “they’re being so crude. Forgive the manners, you seem like a very polite young man.”
“He gave you jewelry? Let me see,” Hermione spoke up. Harry held out his wrist and she drew out her wand, casting detection spells rapidly before he yanked his arm away.
“Fuck,” Harry moaned quietly. Draco nodded in agreement, crooking his fingers again. Harry continued to massage the front of Draco's trousers, reveling in the muffled gasps he received in return.
“Now, as much as I love talking to you, Hermione, I need you to leave the room, because I need to wrap your Christmas present.” Hermione scoffed and shook her head, but stood up nonetheless.
Harry dropped his hands into his crossed lap. He looked up at Draco, blushing furiously. He smiled when Draco kissed his forehead. A clicking noise went off and Harry turned his face, covering his laugh with his sleeved palm. “You're an arse,” he murmured into his hand.
“Please,” Harry groaned. “I love the rain.” Draco sighed and shook his head but stood up anyway. Harry laughed and jumped off the bed, grabbing Draco’s hand and pulling him toward the door.
Harry opened the door to Ron's room and immediately sat on his knees and bent over to grab Draco's gift, looking under the bed for the neatly wrapped box. His sweatshirt slid up his back and pooled under his arms, exposing his torso to the drafty air.
He moaned loudly into his mattress as the kiss turned into licking. “Draco, fuck!” Draco thrust his tongue in as far as he could, before pulling out and repeating the action. Harry pushed his hips back towards Draco’s face wantonly, searching for more. He fisted his sheets tightly, moaning again. “Draco—” Harry’s jaw hung open and his eyelids forced themselves to flutter closed. Draco flicked his tongue and wiggled it barely further into Harry, his fingers gripping tightly onto Harry’s hips. He sucked on Harry’s rim, all while making the filthiest noises. Harry groaned. “Ohhhh fuck—” he choked out, “Draco, please, please.” He was begging, but Harry didn’t care. Draco pulled back, and Harry felt saliva trickling down the inside of his thigh. He moved to support himself up on his forearms but it was pointless as he just fell back on the bed with a whoosh when Draco pushed two fingers into his arse without warning.
“You’re a stubborn git,” he stated. Harry was startled into a laugh. “I’m serious. You don't give up on anything.” Draco huffed and shook his head.
“Yes, for my trunk,” Draco affirmed. “I wish I could stay, but I told Sirius I'd be back later and I should probably sleep a bit before I have to leave. I can stay for a few minutes longer, though.” Harry frowned.
“Hey, what happened? What’s wrong?” he asked. Harry shook his head and got out of bed, rushing out of the dorm and through the common room. Draco was beside him a second later with a sweatshirt on. “Are you all right?” the blond asked. Harry shook his head again and paused at the Griffin statue that led to Dumbledore’s office.
“If you insist,” he murmured. He let Harry unhook his leg from his hip and then let go of Harry’s arse. Draco grabbed Harry’s hips and spun him around so that Harry was facing the tree, arms wrapped low around his waist and mouthing at Harry’s neck.
“Where is he?” Hermione asked. Harry put his pointer finger facing directly down on his table. Her jaw opened slightly. “Is he under the table?” Harry nodded minutely. “Oh my god.” She started to move to look but Harry stopped her.
“God, Draco,” Harry breathed. Draco hummed around him softly. “Your mouth is perfect.” Draco pulled his mouth off and looked up at Harry, pulling a lip between his teeth and smiling.
“Draco, please—please, I need—” Before Harry could finish his sentence, Draco flipped him over and removed his fingers. Harry’s hips were lifted into the air and he scrambled to support himself on his forearms.
“No,” Draco murmured. Harry interlaced his fingers in Draco’s and rested his head against Draco’s chest. Draco leaned into his ear. “I love you.”
Draco pulled out and thrust back in, slowly, shallowly. Harry heard himself making breathy gasps, and then Draco growled quietly. His hands were on Harry’s hips, holding him lightly. Harry’s arms gave out, and his head fell forward onto the pillow, his ragged breathing audible.
“I love you,” he murmured. Draco dropped a kiss on Harry’s lips before bending down and getting dressed in record time. Harry pulled on the rest of his robes and righted himself as best he could without a mirror. Draco watched him, clearly amused. “What?”
“Of course, what else—” he started to say, when realization hit across his features. “Oh. Oh, god no. Holy fuck, Harry, what the hell?”
“Tell me something about yourself that I don’t know,” Draco probed. Harry ran a lip through his teeth.
“That was you? That had the whole Gryffindor and Hufflepuff side of the Hall smelling terrible for weeks!” He scrunched his nose at the memory. Draco grinned and grabbed Harry's hand under the table.
