“Good morning!” A smartly dressed saleswoman strides from the service counter to greet them. “I’m Bernice. Are you gentlemen looking for something in particular today?”
“You may, provided you can recline or lay down.”
Warm hands land on either side of his spine and begin rubbing. He moans at the relieving touch.
“They’re engaged!”
Matthew is waiting for them just outside The Spotted Owl and Harry sees his face light up when he spots James. Harry’s heart warms seeing his son and his boyfriend so happy. He knows it could end in heartbreak, as so many teenage romances do, but having grown up in such a homophobic household, Harry is thankful he’s raised his son to know that his sexuality isn’t shameful.
“Really? Scorp’s coming over?”
“Of course.” Draco sets the pasta on the counter and retrieves his wand from the kitchen table. “Why don’t you go have a shower, and I’ll join you when these are done and under a stasis? We have less than an hour before the kids will be home.”
He kisses Draco softly. “Nothing’s wrong. We are okay. More than okay, actually.”
“Oh, I know. It’s just…different now, for some reason. I’m happy for the first time in a really long time. I just want to enjoy it.”
There’s a soft chuckle and Draco obliges, setting a steady rhythm. The meeting of wet skin and their hard-panting breaths mix with the sounds of the shower running over them. Harry knows he’s already terribly close to the edge but this — his gorgeous fiancé setting his whole body alight with pleasure and sensation — is what he wants. He presses back into Draco, one hand wrapping around his cock while the other braces against the wall.
“May I see it?”
Saturday? Like, four days from now?”
“Yeah, but almost all of the changes have been good.” Al perches next to his dad. “The only bad thing has really been when you were sick, and even that was for a happy reason.”
“Done properly, no, sex does not hurt.” Draco seems he’s not sure if he should be reassuring James or issuing warnings. “It’s meant to feel good, James.”
; owled his solicitor about some paperwork,
“Fuck. No.” Harry rubs the sleep from his face and sits up. He takes the phial Draco is offering and downs it. “Thank you.”
“Not yet. I don’t feel like I need to push, it’s just…there’s no way to ever be prepared for this. I can’t even describe it. Suddenly this little body I’ve kept safe for nine months…my body’s goal is to expel him at all costs. I know it’s how we get him into our arms, but it’s just…”
“He did.”
“Pardon me if I haven't dedicated my time to stalking you like l used to in school,” Harry quips, voice laced with sarcasm.
“You realise we can’t actually tell much of anyone right now, unless we want the press to make an announcement for us.”
“You were pacing, weren’t you?”
“Here’s what we’re thinking.” Draco speaks gently, waiting for Matthew to lift his head. “We’ll give your parents these two weeks of break to process this. Once you get back to Hogwarts, you can write and ask them if you have a place in their home
“So Matthew stays, indefinitely.”
“Have you got something to tell me?”
They land at the main Apparition point for Horizont Alley and Harry immediately feels Draco’s arm around his waist to steady him.
Harry hurries to the Floo and opens the connection to find Hermione’s smiling face.
“I can’t reach all the way around you anymore!” she giggles before putting a hand on either side of his belly. “Hi, baby brother!”
Draco furrows his brow before he answers and Harry can hear the effort to keep an even tone in his voice. “Yes. Not all exposure seems to cause it. Usually long term exposure or short but very intense exposure. And for whatever reason, it’s much more prevalent in witches.”
“I’ll brew him some. It only takes a couple of hours.” Draco seems thankful to have something he can actually
“I will start seeing you every week from here on out.” She waves her wand and packs her bag. “If we make it four more weeks, I'll be very pleased, though I would prefer you make it all the way to thirty-eight. I see no reason you won’t, provided you take the discussed precautions.”
Someone is shaking him. He squints to see Draco standing over him.
“I’d really like the chance to take you out properly, if you’re amenable.”
“Are we really having this conversation whilst doing the breakfast dishes?” He hands Harry a plate and shakes his head. Harry joins him in relieved laughter.
“Yeah. It feels kind of like a little fish wiggling around. This is the first time I’ve felt it.”
on his way into the kitchen. Moving around the kitchen, he starts putting together dinner for himself.
“Thank you.” Harry leans into Draco. “We’re both excited. We wanted you to know before the press catches wind.”
Feeling incredibly awkward, Harry does as she asks.
Several contractions later, Harry has begun to wonder if Healer Powell was somehow mistaken, that perhaps he still had more labouring to do. But then there’s fire spreading in his groin, and burning, so much burning, and he’s bucking back against Draco and there is nothing in the world except a desire to bear down, to push their son from his body.
The strange sensation continues travelling up his body and with it, he becomes aware of his breathing and the sting of something in the crook of his right arm.
“We are doing everything we can to make sure the baby and I are both okay. I see my Healer every week, and I’m getting regular exams and testing. Draco takes good care of me.”
Since the sex in front of the mirror, both Harry and Draco had been nearly insatiable. Any time Harry has been comfortably enough, they’ve been finding every position a heavily pregnant man can be in for penetration.
have a lot of Gryffindors. Lions…so Leo?” Harry doesn’t particularly like that one, but it’s certainly better than his family names.
“I’m so happy for you, Dad. Draco is great.” James’ voice is close to his ear.
“I’ll come straight back here as soon as they’re safely on the train.” Draco hesitates. “Are you sure you’ll be okay alone?”
Draco turns from the register and startles when he sees the look on Harry’s face.
“Yes, Lily, it does. It totally sucks,” Harry sighs. “Matthew may need some space as he deals with this, but the best thing we can be is supportive and willing to listen.”
“Harry,” Draco says, disbelief in his voice.
“Let’s go, then.”
“Draco…” Harry’s tired, and while he doesn’t want to turn down whatever Draco has in mind, he’s also not feeling up to being much of an active participant.
They lay in silence — but for their breathing — for long minutes before Harry shifts himself into Draco’s arms and, exhausted, drifts to sleep.
He feels Draco shift and suddenly Healer Powell hurries in with two Mediwizards, but he ignores them all and closes his eyes, obeying his body and pushing down.
had to worry about this since you
They’re halfway through their tea when the Floo chimes. A few minutes later, there’s a soft knock on the open bedroom door.
Matthew looks terrified but James smiles at him reassuringly. “That works.”
“I think it’s great that you guys are coming back to school,” Seamus yawned. “It would have been proper boring otherwise.” Dean elbowed him in the side, expression cautious while he glances at Harry and Ron.
She jogs over when she notices Harry is outside.
“Malfoy is up to something,” Harry declared.
Harry scrambled after him, crumpling the cloak under his arm as he did.
“You can help Uncle Draco look,” She tells him sternly. “I don’t think he’s very good at it, he keeps looking in the same place!” Her bushy brown hair is escaping from under her hastily put-on hat. She reminds Harry so much of a young Hermione that he has to bite back a smile.
“You’d better go and get yourself some food,” Blaise said, with a twinkle in his eye, “and we’ll be seeing each other later. Adieu!”
A man appears in the doorway. He seems like he’s around Harry’s age, maybe even younger. His brown hair is dishevelled and greasy in the way hair gets when one uses only spells and no shampoo to clean it. His expression is one of delight when he spots them.
. Small potted plants on the abundant little side tables, slightly bigger ones with big leaves on the window sills. Even hanging from the ceiling in little round pots were plants. It almost felt like they were in one of the greenhouses. The common room was filled with life, even more now that it was filled with its occupants.
When he looks back down at Rose she is giving him the stink-eye and promptly turns to Draco.
Rose is rather forcefully looking through the plants her mother had so carefully planted around the house. Draco is all the way on the other side of the garden, looking under the hedges that surround the perimeter.
Half an hour later he had resorted to picking at the frayed hems of his pyjama. Harry let his mind wander… he had already come up with a million things Malfoy could be doing at night, none of them commendable.
As soon as Malfoy turned his back, Harry quietly got up and hurried after him towards the door. He had to walk really close behind Malfoy in order to slip through the door without touching it himself. Harry felt the warmth radiating from Malfoy’s body. It made him shiver, but he didn’t feel cold.
attractive. Especially as he’s looking down at Rose as if this problem is as big and serious as one he would encounter at the Ministry, with a small wrinkle between his frowning eyebrows. Harry has to physically shake himself out of his longing stare.
He looks up at Ron, who’s standing behind his daughter wearing a princess themed apron.
Harry felt tense. Every one that fought in the battle was offered the opportunity to enrol in auror training immediately. However, most people were also aware that Harry didn’t like to talk about it. He couldn’t explain why, but the fact that anyone, most of all the people from the Ministry, expected him to jump at the chance to start training right after the war made him incredibly angry. Uncontrolled magic angry. Grimmauld place had a lot less plates in its kitchen after the last time someone tried to talk to him about it.
An angry red now colours his cheeks, Harry is glad to see he struck a nerve. The whole situation suddenly became a lot more to Harry. It’s not the first time they deal with a Voldemort sympathiser and he simply doesn’t seem to have the patience to take it too seriously. All of that was used up on actual Voldemort.
The form informed him that a woman had been transferred to St. Mungo’s from a muggle hospital because she was bitten by a venomous, magical snake.
to each other at any point?” Maybe not, Draco thought fervently. Maybe he and Luna spend the night together in a corner in the Gryffindor common room, both outsiders, and left quickly, without ever speaking to any of them.
Hermione sat up then, quickly. She glanced at Harry before turning to Seamus and starting a lecture that everyone who’d stayed at Grimmauld Place even one night had heard at least once. “Sure, arguably we’d be great at Defence,” she stated, “But what about Potions? And Charms? We missed a whole year of education, and starting Auror training with such a disadvantage...”
Lovegood, the traitor, nodded. “Sure, Harry. See you later, Draco!”
But Draco doesn’t walk away. He reaches his hand out to Harry’s face. Touches his numb cheek with equally freezing fingers, ever so gently.
“Harry,” Draco acknowledges seriously as he looks him up and down. “Don’t bother unwrapping that scarf, you’ll need it.” And with that, he steps past Harry into the house.
“In just a second, I’m going to ask your dad and your brother some questions.”
Harry surges forward. Their kiss becomes more desperate, Harry’s licking into Draco’s mouth, causing them both to moan softly.
to decide to come back to school. And in his head, he was. But his heart wasn’t really in it. He was tired.
“We turn around,” She hisses. She does most of the listening, but her word is final. Once again of one mind, they twist around, hissing at their capturer.
it read,
Malfoy sneered. “Are you a prefect now, Potter? I don’t owe you any kind of explanation.”
“Let’s go,” She smiled.
He watches Draco as he wanders around, looking around the backyard area, shuffling through the fallen leaves with the pointy ends of his boots. Things have changed slowly since they started their, well, arrangement. It had a long build-up and just happened one night, and then they didn’t really stop. Apparently they’ve started doing things like spelling each other’s boots or broken glasses or episkeys for small wounds lately. Harry doesn’t think he minds.
The man curls his lip, presumably at the use of the muggle curse.
A new class? Harry briefly glanced at his schedule. Indeed, on Wednesday morning at ten there was a period blocked out for C.O.C. Harry returned to the, well,
, Harry remembered with some effort, but he couldn’t recall the boy’s first name.
“Harry,” Draco breathes, interrupting his rambling thoughts. He takes a step closer, into Harry’s space.
Harry tears his eyes away from Draco, ignores his annoyance and grins at the man, Rookwood Jr. apparently.
“Come off it, Potter. Just tell me what I did,” he snapped.
It feels like days had passed since he’d last been home, but it was only four in the afternoon. Harry takes off his constrictive robes and paces around the kitchen. He’s too fired up to go sit down, or make dinner. He needs to do something, he needs… He needs to see Draco.
Draco hardly looks up when Harry joins him in looking through the hedge.
“Draco.” Potter sounded pained. “You don’t remember?”
“No!” Harry shouts. He darts in front of Draco instinctively. But the snake slithers forward and lifts up her heads, ready to pound.
“Do you think we’ll bunk with the new last year's students?” Dean wondered. “They’d have to expand the Gryffindor dorms, for sure.”
“Fine, fine, I’ll get you some. The last of my stash!” he exclaimed dramatically. “Anything for you, my dear friend!”
“Uncle Draco!” Rose calls when they enter. She launches herself at him, squeezing his waist into a tight hug.
“Fuck!” Harry yells as he lands on his ass on a cold concrete floor in a small dark room. He doesn’t have the knocker in his hand, which is strange, because this was clearly portkey magic. And his wand is gone. Shit. As Harry stands up, Draco springs into existence in the small room. He has landed on his feet, though he’s now leaning on Harry for support. Harry’s not sure if physical, emotional or both.
“You can take that thing off now, Potter,” Malfoy snapped.
Something had changed in Malfoy’s face when he turned around. He started moving into Harry’s space, closer and closer until his hands came to rest on his cheeks and his mouth touched Harry’s lips. Harry made a soft sound of surprise. He wanted to get his hands on Malfoy, but the other boy moved away before he had the chance to do so.
Blaise sighed deeply, but Draco felt the cool little bottle against the palm of his hand nonetheless and closed his fingers around it eagerly. Finally leaning up a little, he downed the potion at once. Draco’s headache disappeared like snow in the sun. He was left, however, with an overwhelming feeling of embarrassment and he wasn’t sure why, which made his heart-rate spike in slight panic immediately. Truthfully, Draco did a lot of embarrassing stuff on a daily basis. Many things were different in his extra year at Hogwarts, and one of them was the image he had of himself. He was many things, but cool and collected was not one of them. This worried him, because there was only one secret he kept so close that not even Blaise knew about it.
“Why are you so, so…” Draco gestured vaguely in the direction of Blaise’s voice, “vivacious?”
Harry has to try very hard not to smile at her.
Draco froze. Potter kept walking towards them.
On the other side, Dean and Seamus high fived; Dean reluctantly and Seamus with a big grin. Harry smiled at them. He was vaguely aware that they sometimes shared a room in Grimmauld Place, also. When he turned back to face Ron, his face had gone sour.
Luna frowned. “No— ”
want that normal school year.”
“Blimey,” Whispered Ron.
Draco huffed. “You Gryffindors party like animals! I may not remember what I did last night, but I feel like whatever it was, it had something to do with
Malfoy opened the door to the common room with unsteady hands. Harry followed him in. Did he fuck it up? Why wasn’t he saying anything?
close but most importantly, he was no closer to figuring out what had happened last night.
“Oh yes, your wands didn’t come with you. Ingenious modification of the portkey charm, isn’t it?”
As they walk to the apparition point in silence, Harry thinks they still make an impressive pair. Their Auror robes still call for respect from the other Ministry workers, and the chatter immediately dies down when they enter the elevator. If Harry’s murder frown had not been enough to cause that, Malfoy never forgot how to twist his face into a permanent sneer. And on top of that, they’re Malfoy and Potter. Harry secretly enjoys it just a little.
Hermione hummed in agreement.
Harry looked at Malfoy, then. His short hair was ruffled from real or pretend sleep. It made him seem more approachable somehow. They stared at each other for a couple seconds, until Malfoys cheeks started getting pink again.
“This way!” It’s Draco’s turn to grab Harry by the arm. They’ve learned long ago that he is better at understanding the layout of places due to having spent his former years living in a manor.
just had. Despite his efforts to make it seem like nothing was wrong, Harry could tell that Malfoy had felt embarrassed.
“Hi, Malfoy.”
Seamus slumped back down in his seat dejectedly. “This can’t be good,” He muttered.
Draco sat up, felt some vomit rise in his throat and immediately let himself fall back onto his mountain of pillows. He closed his eyes, but not before seeing Blaise shake his head at him. “That was
“Get out of the bathroom,” Harry sighed, suddenly tired.
Harry felt embarrassed when he thought about it.
” Ginny asked. Harry and Ron exchanged a meaningful look. They were already later than Hermione was comfortable being, and though the drive to Kings Cross wasn’t that long, they knew Hermione needed to be there at least fifteen minutes before departure.
“What?” Malfoy spluttered. He was caught so off-guard that he forgot his manners.
Draco barely spares him a look. “Good morning to you too, Potter. Yes, I slept surprisingly well in your horrible bed, thank you for asking. Oh, wait…”
Harry breathed in deeply, looked at his feet and then said something he did not say very often. “Yeah, sorry.”
“Malfoy-” Harry started.
“It’s not so much
The man scoffs. He opens his mouth to reply, but Draco cuts him off.
They look around. Apart from the ugly ceiling light bathing the room in an orange glow, there is no furniture.
When Harry made his way back to his friends, his spot had been taken by Neville.
“Oh you know, just Neville, Dean and Seamus and Harry, Ron and Hermione. And us.” Luna smiled serenely. Draco almost choked on his own saliva. This was his worst case scenario, slowly coming true. He twisted to face Luna fully, making imploring eye-contact.
“What the fuck,” he groaned.
Harry supposed it was. The rugs on the floor were made up of all possible colours, very different from the overwhelmingly red Gryffindor common room. In between the windows and against the other walls, open cupboards were filled with board games and books. On the right side of the room, snug in between cupboards, were two doors leading to the dormitories. Harry itched to go and see what was behind them.
To his credit, Rookwood immediately starts running when the snake turns on him. It follows at a more leisurely pace, while making a sound that Harry thinks might be snake-laughter.
“Returning eighth year student, would you please stay seated?” Professor McGonagall spoke.
“What’s going on, Rose?” Harry asks, slightly jealous that Draco gets a hug while he only got yelled at.
“Yes, we probably should go inside now.” He sounds out of breath.
“What,” Said Seamus, “With the whole auror offer and all, I meant.”
“No!” Rookwood shrieks.
“Students, could you please gather at the Hufflepuff table?” Professor McGonagall asked. Every one complied quickly. Harry supposed they were all curious about the reason they had to stay behind. They really didn’t have a clue what their year would look like.
His former enemy was standing in front of a small cupboard carrying what Harry recognized to be potions ingredients; aconite, dittany and knotgrass as well as some half-filled jars.
He can hear Draco groan softly next to him. When he glances over, his partner has his eyes closed as a muscle twitches in his jaw. His sharp jaw, that Harry had been kissing just last night.
“South,” Draco says as he twists on the spot to take in his surroundings. He points in the distance, to what seems to be a small village. “That’s Turner’s Hill over there, the muggle town where the attack happened. Our culprit’s house should be around here somewhere.”
He barely has time to finish that thought when he hears the familiar pop of someone apparating in in the hallway.
“You’re brewing potions in here?” This had not been at all what Harry expected. He turned to look at Malfoy.
“You’ve been hanging out with him…?”
“Well Potter, I think you deserve to take the afternoon off,” Auror Hickey says as he slaps Harry on the shoulder. “Or what’s left of it, anyway.”
The other man is breathing heavily. His cheeks are flushed, at least; he doesn’t look like he’s about to faint anymore. He’s looking at Harry intently, a dark look in his eyes that Harry knows all too well. He stalks forward and presses their mouths together hotly.
“I’m not stupid,” Ron scoffs. “I’d never get away with that. No, it’s just turkey again this year, mate.”
And so they went. Right away they found themselves in a small hallway, with a door on each side. The boys crowded in to see what they were. Bathrooms, looking much like the ones in Gryffindor. A little ahead of them was a short set of stairs; only a few steps up. Harry and Ron looked at each other, and then raced each other up.
Potter and Draco listened to the sound of her footsteps receding, until they were well and truly alone. Draco still had his back turned to Potter, who cleared his throat awkwardly. When Draco didn’t make a move, he walked around Draco to face him instead. Draco kept his gaze locked on Potter’s horrible trainers. He hadn’t even bothered to tie the laces.
“Okay,” Harry said. He opened the door and lifted the tapestry slightly, checking that the hallway was completely empty before emerging. He held the fabric aside for Malfoy, who followed him with a quiet, surprised
Ron leaned towards Harry. “They really do get smaller every year,” He whispered in awe.
Potter merely raised his eyebrows. He looked vaguely amused, to Draco’s chagrin. He was not being taken seriously.
“Hurry up, won’t you?” He snaps, tone unnecessarily harsh.
Draco leans in and presses his lips against Harry’s again. His hand sneaks into Harry’s hair and tugs a little. A small groan escapes Harry’s lips and he’s kissing back, wanting
“What do you want with us?” Draco snarls.
The language came more naturally to him now, and it was easy to mediate between the snake and the Zoologists. The snake, it turned out, was quite demanding. Harry was itching to get away, to get home, but it took the better part of two hours before the team of Aurors had arrested Rookwood, searched the house, collected evidence and took care of that damn snake.
“Not your scene, my arse,” Draco grumbled. “You’ve had Pepper-Up and I want some too.”
Of course, she started describing the start of the party in painstaking detail, but not the ones Draco was actually interested in. He kind of zoned out as he listened, occasionally humming when she left a space for him to do so. He didn’t tune back in until she described Daphne Greengrass leaving.
“Fuck! I need to stand!”
“This section is our king-size bedroom suites.” Bernice gestures down the aisle. She waves her wand broadly over the section of furniture. “I’ll be nearby if you need me, just raise a hand and the charm will alert me.”
. I don’t feel like we’ve forced anything; it just works.”
Harry opens the door as Draco is climbing the front steps. Draco’s eyes widen just a fraction in surprise, but Harry smiles.
“We went to bed last night, and I was tired, but didn’t feel at all ill. Then just after four this morning, I woke up incredibly nauseous and vomiting. It didn’t stop until Draco got me some anti-nausea potion.”
“Then why are you still ill?” Al is not yet convinced, that much is clear.
That’s Draco. The terrified tone of his voice makes Harry want to look at him, but he can’t. He can’t make his mouth form words. He’s trapped in the dark and can’t open his eyes.
“Have you any idea how much I’ve missed seeing you like this?”
“And his boyfriend is living with us.”
“Let’s go up to the house and get cleaned up. Quidditch gear is far too restrictive for what I have in mind.” Harry raises the Snitch in front of his face, winks at Draco, and lets go.
“Absolutely gigantic,” Harry quips.
With the help of both the Healer and Draco, Harry turns. He feels positively ridiculous like this, his arse sticking out of the water. But if he’s in labour, he supposes there will be a lot of feeling ridiculous today.
“Do you want to stay?” he asks softly. He watches a delighted expression spread over Draco’s face.
Harry is certain his grin matches Draco’s. “We’re going to have a baby.” He leans in and kisses Draco softly. “We should probably see what Healer Carr has to say and find out more about what we need to do now.”
Each person’s work is largely independent, which Harry appreciates because he really prefers to work on his own. The Dark Magic experts do, however, frequently ask one another to offer an opinion before lifting away what they think to be a benign spell. Pulling the wrong layer away from the magical imaging often results in having to reset the entire process and start over. So when Claire, the tall blonde French woman whose lab station is next to his, asks him to take a look at a tangle of spells before she lifts it, Harry thinks nothing of it.
“Exactly,” Harry grins. “Shower then? And shopping? Maybe even lunch out?”
“Enjoy your wedding, gentlemen. Congratulations! I’ll see myself out.” With a wave of her wand, everything is packed, and Healer Carr bustles from the room.
“You’re on!” Harry pushes the door open and they trudge up the hill towards the house.
It’s always been hard since it’s the day his parents died, but since Ginny’s death, it’s always seemed just a little more difficult. He never wanted his kids to grow up without one of their parents, and he’s terrified of them ending up with no parents at all. The day just weighs heavily on him.
“That should do it.” Draco is clearly not thrilled with where they’re going, even if they both know it’s a good choice for the disruption. For all his appreciation of the finer things in life, Draco despises the wealthy culture he was raised in. “At least their food is good.”
“You mentioned Granger helped you set up your television to work around magic, do you think she could be persuaded to ward one of these for my flat too?” Draco asks, gesturing to Harry’s telly. He sinks back onto the couch, more towards the middle this time, and reaches for the wine, topping off both their glasses.
“Merlin, yes, please. It’s been almost a month, Draco. Just because I was too sick for us to do anything, doesn’t mean I haven’t wanted it. I’ve missed you.”
“We’re both okay?” Harry’s heart needs the clarification, just one more time.
“Yes, love?” Draco’s head pops around the door.
Harry pads into Draco’s lab and settles on the couch, shaking his head as Draco doesn’t even notice. The lab Draco has created in the attic space allows him to work from home most of the time, and Harry is exceptionally thankful for the specially warded reading nook Draco’s made for him off to one side. There’s a comfortable couch and chair where Harry can lounge, read, and relax close to his fiancé that is safe for him, even while pregnant.
“Gonna cum…Oh, Merlin, gonna cum…”
“Hmmm.” The Healer makes some notes and Harry is worried that she seems more concerned than before. He wishes she was more personable and less brusque, but she’s magically and medically competent, and that matters more.
“This isn’t going to go anything like we planned, is it?” Draco exhales heavily.
“That’s quite brilliant, actually.” Harry is impressed with how skillfully the magical community can be camouflaged that close to the Muggle community.
“I honestly don’t know, but last night I couldn’t sleep at all. Absolutely nothing was comfortable for more than three minutes. I did manage to snooze once Draco got me into the tub, but now the discomfort is moving out of my back and hips and wrapping around my stomach.”
“I love you, Draco.”
Draco places a hand on Scorpius’ shoulder.
“You won’t. You’ll be ready to push before then and it will give you something else to focus on. I’ll give you gentlemen some privacy. You can press the call button if you need someone. Otherwise, I’ll be back in a bit to see how you’re doing.”
“We’ll see,” James finally concedes. “I’d like to work towards it, at least.”
“You really want to get married? Before our son is born?” Draco sounds less incredulous now and more…anticipatory, perhaps?
“I’m ready.”
Coffee securely in hand, Draco and Harry stroll towards Currys, enjoying the warmth from the coffee and easy conversation. Harry can’t help but steal looks at his handsome company, and the shop appears in front of them more quickly than Harry would like. He leads Draco to a massive display of televisions. Draco studies them intently for a moment and then looks to Harry.
Draco helps him to the loo and then steps into the warm water, waiting until Harry is ready to get in. Harry grips his hands and steps over the edge of the tub, and they settle together, Harry leaning heavily on Draco’s chest. The warmth of the water is immediately relieving.
Draco escorts Harry to the elevators, up three floors and down a long hallway to a set of double doors. The sign above them reads “Department of Dark Magic Damage Research.” He opens the door for Harry and steps in behind him.
“Yes. Very much.”
Draco holds him close, Regulus snuggled between them, for a long moment. Harry can’t help but think about how a year ago, everything was set in motion to grant him a fresh chance at love and
Oh Merlin. When Lily
“Much better,” Harry agrees, closing his eyes and feeling the warmth emanating from having Draco wrapped around him. He inhales and lets out a soft sigh at the pleasant aroma of Draco's shampoo mixed with the sweetness of the apple he'd been eating.
Draco is standing at the hob, stirring something that smells wonderful when Harry comes downstairs from his nap.
of sixth year Arithmancy and Herbology this summer and half of seventh year, right? Plus, a good portion of Portions, Transfiguration, and Charms! And you’ve learned it
Harry spreads Draco’s arse apart, exposing his furled hole. Leaning forward, he eases Draco’s arse back just slightly and licks from the back of his balls up to his hole. Every bit of Draco is delicious and Harry finds he is already developing a taste for him, and him alone.
“Thank you,” Matthew says softly as he grasps James’ hand, and they cross the platform.
“Thanks, love,” Harry grumbles.
“Really?”
The connection closes and Harry rises from the hearth. Draco emerges from the pantry with a bottle of wine as Harry moves to check on dinner. A distinct scratching at the window catches his attention just as he slips on his oven mitts.
Malfoy’s shoulders raise in something that’s almost-but-not-quite a shrug. ”I wanted a son. Astoria wanted to live comfortably without being tied to a man. We both got what we wanted.”
“That would be lovely. I’ve missed you.”
“Draco!” Harry is torn between amusement and horror as he studies the paper. The press has usually treated Draco fairly and on his own merits in the last few years, but when their relationship had first become public, there had been some less-than-kind headlines.
“We need to talk with Matthew, alone, tonight. And then probably him and James together.”
“Happy New Year!”
“Why don’t you share what you’re comfortable with and we’ll ask for specifics if we need them.”
And then Matthew is between them and they’re hugging him from either side. Harry looks at James, who is crying silently at the end of the bed but smiling through his tears.
“Draco?”
“So the same as my birthstone?”
“That will be part of this process, too. If they say you do, you can make that choice. If they say you don’t, we will have it in writing and that will make the next part easier.”
“You and Draco.”
Draco quirks an eyebrow. “
“Train leaves at 11.00, but love, you can’t go if you’re like this. Let’s see how you are in a few hours.”
“Yep.” Draco cracks a smile. “Let’s go work on dinner.”
happy, aren’t you?”
“I haven’t dated in the nearly twelve years since Gin died. I’ve focused on the kids. I’ve been lonely,” he pauses when Hermione’s eyes narrow, “…romantically speaking. And it was what was necessary for us. And I wasn’t looking for anyone when Draco asked me for tea. But Hermione…”
Harry’s interest is piqued. He really did enjoy being an Auror and learning how to defend against and circumvent Dark Magic. “Go on.”
“We certainly took long enough after that to get our ducks in a row and start seeing each other properly.” Harry shakes his head, thinking back to the weeks of awkward maybe-flirting on his part.
“Did you say yes?”
Harry nods towards the entrance where two Daily Prophet reporters loom outside the door.
doing this. By Saturday night, he will be married again — bonded this time.
“What sounds good, James?” Harry asks as they make their way to the kitchen.
“So, if you’re amenable…” Draco draws a deep breath and smiles nervously. “…I’d like that ‘forever’ to begin as soon as possible.”
“Yeah.”
Draco says nothing, but Harry tips his head back to see him weeping openly. Those emotions his husband works so hard to control around people he doesn’t know are on display. Harry opens his mouth to tell Draco how much he loves him, but the next wave of pressure overtakes him.
“And Sirius.” Harry runs his fingers over the stars, pausing over a constellation. “What about Orion?”
“Oh!” Draco’s soft gasp of surprise makes Harry open the eyes that had fluttered shut.
“I’m your own personal cautionary tale,” Harry laughs. He and Draco are adults and in a committed relationship — they are thrilled to be having a baby — but if the circumstances can keep his son from ending up pregnant too young, that’s an added bonus.
“…and then we did a full series of core imaging. It’s certainly not normal for a pregnant man, but it’s not something we’ve seen—“
Draco grins at Harry. For as much as this was unexpected, they’ve warmed quite quickly to the idea of having a baby. They’re now both just as excited as if they’d been trying to conceive.
?!” Lily is practically squealing with excitement at this news. Harry laughs outright. He’s been concerned that Lily, who was somewhat accustomed to receiving all of her father’s attention the last two years, would feel pushed aside by Draco. This is, apparently, a non-issue.
Harry chews his lip, trying to decide how forward to be.
“Nothing fancy,” Harry clarifies. “Just a ceremony here Saturday evening. Minerva has agreed to perform the bonding ritual. We’ll have some robes tailored. We were hoping you’d help decorate a spot in the garden?”
“James? Really?”
Harry is quite relieved to know this. He has always encouraged his kids to have an open dialogue with their partners in a relationship, but he knows kids don’t always listen. Plus, it’s not the easiest conversation to initiate as an adult. It’s probably mortifying as a teen.
“I do.”
Harry looks down at the outfits. One is dark wash denims that fit rather snug, a dark burgundy dress shirt, and a charcoal sport blazer. The other is fitted charcoal trousers and a supersoft deep green ribbed, fitted, turtleneck jumper. Harry turns to Hermione and waggles his eyebrows. “Let’s go with Slytherin green, just for the fun of it.”
“Why is this funny?!”
“You took a nap, didn’t you?” Hermione says knowingly.
Draco laughs. “Yes. That helps.”
“Me, too. I just didn’t foresee any situation where I’d have a…” At Draco’s pause, Harry cranes his neck and looks up at him inquiringly. Draco looks down at him and shrugs. “I’m not sure what to call this.”
Lily wins the dinner battle. Pizza is ordered and the kids quickly settle into their rooms, Scorpius choosing the room next to Al’s. Harry pauses at the door to James’ room, seeing him sitting on his bed, expression pensive.
Once Scorpius’ furniture has been chosen, shrunken, and packed, they do exactly that. Harry thanks Bernice again and steels himself, taking Draco’s hand and leading him out the door.
“I’m flattered, Draco, really,” Harry says earnestly. “Can I think about it?”
“It sounds like he dropped to the canal. Let’s have a look.”
“We absolutely care.” Harry leaves no room for doubt in his tone. “But we care because if you’re having sex here or elsewhere, we want you to be safe and careful. And because we know that if we don’t want you to be having sex, it’s not going to somehow keep it from happening if that’s what you decide to do. Denial won’t keep the two of you safe.”
“Do you think you’re labouring?”
“Would you?”
“It’s just a lot to take in and a lot happening to my body. It’s ok. Just stay with me.”
“How long have you been up?”
“I am going to put you on modified bedrest, Mr Potter. You need to be reclining or laying down at all times. You can go to the loo and you can move between your bedroom and the living room. Otherwise, I’d prefer you not move around any more than necessary.” She glances from Harry to Draco and back again. “I’m also going to advise that you not have any vigorous anal penetration. No anal sex, nothing larger than three fingers. Anything smaller is ok for now, including toys that vibrate. If you have pain or unusual discharge, stop immediately and call me.”
“We do.” Harry has always been open with his children, and he plans to continue that with this subject matter. But he’s never had to tell his kids he’s romantically involved with someone, and he’s not sure the best way to do it. The fact that Draco also has a child complicates matters further.
“Nervous?”
“Do you want me to go first?” Hardy asks gently.
“Thank you, Healer Carr.”
“That’s good to know.”
Hermione appears in the living room just as Draco is withdrawing from the fire. He looks to Harry and nods, indicating that Minerva is, indeed, free for Saturday.
“Do you think we’ll have the baby today?”
“Yeah, I think we might need to review some of our dealing with the
the attention."
"You don't have to pay me for it Draco Malfoy."
"I told him to fuck off because he tried to 'talk sense' into me, and I wasn't having it. If you're asking about that because I lost us house points, then tough shit sweetheart. Prepare to lose more from him."
"You're such a git Malfoy. Why are you doing this? What do you hope to get out of this bloody charade you're playing?"
“Apparently Mina, who is Muggle-born, sometimes hears her parents. Lil does
“I didn’t have one. I was raised by Muggles. Madame Pomfrey at Hogwarts was the first magical medical care I had, at least after I was 15 months old. I don’t know who I saw before that.”
“I know, son, but it’s important that you truly understand. And especially if you’re thinking about going further, it’s important that you remember that if either of you
“Oh!” Bernice appears flustered. “I’m sorry; I had no idea that was you, Mr Potter. Or you, Mr Malfoy.”
“I can’t believe you’re pregnant.”
“Are you ready?” Healer Carr moves to stand beside his hips. Harry nods and she pulls back the bed covers, casting the charm before easing Harry’s left knee up so he can pull it towards his chest.
“I know today isn’t your favourite, so I thought maybe it would help.”
“What do we need to do from here, Healer?” Draco asks. “Obviously, neither of us has any idea what’s involved with a male pregnancy.”
“You know me well.” He can never put anything past Hermione, and thank goodness for that, because it’s kept him out of trouble more than once.
“I’ll make sure I spend some time just with him after we tell them. If he’s not ok with it, we can make a different plan.” Draco pauses thoughtfully. “I really do think he’ll be ok with it, though. He’s a pretty laid-back kid.”
Harry returns the kiss enthusiastically, then there are hands slipping under waistbands and cupping bare arses and Harry shifts Draco backwards until his thighs meet the table. Desire is pooling in Harry’s groin and he presses deeper into the kiss, slowly laying Draco down onto the table, legs hanging off the edge, and places a palm on either side of the man’s torso.
“I wanted to give her our engagement news in person before the papers figure it out. And if we tell her I’m pregnant, there’s a guaranteed pile of reputable reading material being delivered here by tomorrow evening.”
Something vaguely warm pools in Harry’s gut and he returns the intense gaze. “You’ve done exactly that, Malfoy. You’ve raised a fine young man from what I can see. And for what it’s worth, it sure seems to me like you’ve made a good man out of yourself, as well.”
“James? Everything ok?”
“No, Harry. Don’t talk like that.” Draco’s voice is sharp.
“Oh?”
“He did,” James says firmly. “He asked me what I thought about doing it at Easter and I told him that if he wanted to do that, I would be there for him no matter how they reacted. We did talk together about the best way to do it and decided when he got home before he unpacked was best, just in case.”
His secret had, of course, to do with Potter. And with every passing minute it became more and more likely that he had indeed been involved in whatever had happened last night.
“I’ll be happy not to hear all those cars in the street anymore,” Ron remarked. For the past summer, he and Hermione had claimed a room in the front part of the house, where all the magic in the world wouldn’t completely muffle the sounds of London traffic.
“So, about last night,” Potter started.
“The beds in the dormitories have been assigned. You will find your belongings by your bed, as well as your class schedule for the upcoming period.” She looked around the group, making sure she had everyone’s attention before perching lightly on the arm of a sofa. “There is one more thing I need to discuss with you. An extra, new, class has been added to all of your schedules. It will be given by me, personally. It takes place on Wednesday morning. This once, you don’t have to prepare anything. For now, I will leave you to explore. Good night,” She said promptly. With a twinkle in her eyes, she stood up and swiftly walked out of the common room, closing the door behind her softly.
“Uncle Harry!” She yells, eyes wide. “You’re finally here!”
“I will,” Harry says distractedly. He’s looking at Draco, who is talking to some colleagues elsewhere.
Draco hadn’t shared with him all that he got up to during his nightly adventures, but Harry was sure now that he would soon tell him all about it.
“Yes, see you on Monday,” Harry repeats, still staring daggers at Draco’s back. He doesn’t turn around, so there is nothing left to do but apparate home under Hickey’s expectant gaze.
Harry opened the door to the men’s room. Sitting on his trunk, blocking the sink and the door to the stall both, was Malfoy, with an open book in his hands.
“Cock?” Ron laughed loudly from where he was sitting on his bed. “They’re introducing a new class and they’re calling it
Filch rounded the corner, carrying a lantern and muttering to himself, Harry noticed vaguely. But his attention wasn’t really on Filch. He was focused on Malfoy with every atom of his body, aware of every point of contact between their bodies. Harry couldn’t stop staring at Malfoy’s slightly parted lips. Almost involuntarily, he started leaning in ever so slowly.
“You’re my favourite uncle, Uncle Harry!” Hugo calls after him, making Harry grin as he steps out into the horrible cold.
“What is it?” Harry asked.
“For fucks sake, Harry!”
“It’s Helga, she’s disappeared!” Rose’s voice trembles a little as she announces this, and Harry can see that she’s trying very hard to keep her bottom lip from wobbling. He’s still confused, and a little ashamed to admit that he doesn’t immediately seem to know who or what ‘Helga’ is.
“Excuse me,” Harry said as he stood up. “I need to use the loo.”
“HELGA!” Rose’s voice calls loudly, scaring Harry and Draco apart.
“I’m off to bed,” He yawned. “Are you coming?”
Harry and Draco hurry up the steps. This is the ground floor. Light spills in through cracks in the thick curtains covering every window.
Draco felt observed by the suits of armour now, even though they were as still as if they hadn’t a drop of magic in them. They made no move to stop him. He looked around the room. There was no sign that anything out of the ordinary had happened here last night. It didn’t even smell like firewhisky.
Backup arrives with a loud pop, making them jump apart. Together, it doesn’t take them long to round up Rookwood. Harry helps the people from the Beasts Department with the snake, which feels very unreal. For years he’d believed he lost the ability to do this, he’d tried and tried. But when that snake was about to attack Draco, something came over him. The need to protect Draco was so strong, he didn’t even have to think about it.
“Luna… Malfoy?” Potter asked.
They walk up to the house together in silence. The front door is made of plain wood, and there is no doorbell to be seen. Harry bonks on the door with his fist a bunch of times. His other hand is on his wand, just like he knows Draco’s is.
“You’re right. You don’t have to tell me anything.” Harry raised his head and locked eyes with Malfoy. “I just noticed you sneaking out, that’s all.”
Okay, so. Decidedly not comforting. Draco took his hands away from his face and promptly hugged his knees to his chest. Could he obliviate Potter, Luna and then himself?
“Me and Blaise left quite early on,” she explained at Draco’s stricken look, “but I doubt you’d have noticed, half the school was still there at that point.”
After waiting for a couple of minutes so as not to rouse any suspicion, Harry hurries into work. The Auror Headquarters are still quiet; as most of his colleagues were not morning people the general starting time had shifted to nine thirty. Harry’s cubicle was located near one of the ends, where Kingsley’s used to be. It was decorated with pictures of him and his friends and drawings Rose had made for him over the years. Thankfully, not many people bother him in his little corner, except Draco of course, because partners are assigned neighbouring cubicles and also he’s nosy.
with Draco - in a while. And last time they were not entirely sober, which leads Harry to believe that Draco definitely must know about Harry’s crush on him. Drunk him is very obvious about these sorts of things.
He looks at Draco. “Are you okay?”
It doesn’t take long before they reach a lonely house, hidden slightly in the trees. It seems abandoned and dark, overgrown with vines and the surrounding area, Harry’s not sure it could be called a garden, is filled with weeds.
“In a little, I’ve almost finished that essay on conjuration.”
Seamus looked like he regretted ever bringing it up.
Harry returns the kiss like his life depends on it, digging his fingers into Draco’s hips, hard.
“Me and Luna have some people to mingle with,” Ginny hooked her arm though Luna’s demonstratively. “Yes,” Luna added while nodding seriously. “We like to mingle.”
Harry smiled half-heartedly. It was overwhelming to be back in the great hall. The repairs had been done wonderfully. The castle was fully restored to its former glory, without any traces of the war, the battle, ever happening.
They arrive dead in the middle of a wet field on a grey, drizzly day. Harry holds on to Draco’s arm a second longer than strictly necessary.
There is a door, but of course it’s closed. Harry walks up to it, holding his hand out and starts throwing spells at it, nonverbally. It doesn’t budge but the lock starts rattling.
Seamus elbowed him in the side softly.
happen.”
“No thank you,” Draco said quickly. “Just for clarification, when you say there were only so few of us, exactly who were left?”
“I know you.”
“Might as well actually go to the loo,” Harry mumbled to himself.
Draco yanks him backward by the back of his robes just in time before the door swings open on what would have been Harry’s face. And Harry knows they are in a very serious situation, whisked away during their investigation to Merlin knows where without letting anybody know where they went. But he can’t help leaning into Draco’s chest just a little.
ready to start the day.
“Draco, I haven’t known you to be this polite to me,
Draco lets out a shaky breath, and lets himself be dragged a couple of paces before he regains himself and starts running beside Harry. They leave the room and find themselves in a small corridor at the bottom of a staircase. Rookwood’s footsteps are thundering above them, causing dust and filth to fall from the ceiling with his every step.
“There’s a higher rate of miscarriage and complications in male pregnancies. I already almost lost you both once.” Draco snuggles him closer. “I’ve never been so scared in my life as when I kissed you and walked out of that procedure room, Harry. I want us to do everything we can to make sure the both of you stay healthy.”
“That’s true.” Draco grips Harry’s hips and turns him so they’re face to face, leaning in for a kiss. Harry lets his eyes drift shut and enjoys the butterflies he still gets, even now, when Draco’s lips touch his.
“We have found that Dark Magic, especially Dark Magic cast on witches before they hit puberty, can cause unseen damage that can manifest later in life.” Draco’s voice takes on something reminiscent of Hermione’s lecture tones, but alarm bells are ringing in Harry’s head. “We are trying to learn to seek and find that damage so it can be repaired and prevent those issues.”
“I never set out to keep it quiet,” Harry replies firmly, eyes meeting Malfoy’s and holding his gaze. “It’s not something I hide and it’s not something I’m ashamed of. The kids know, and so do my friends. Ginny knew.” Harry takes a deliberate breath and waves a discreet hand over his cup, warming his now-cold tea. “Most people just assume, I guess, since I married a woman. And I haven’t dated or anything since Ginny died. I haven’t really done anything since then besides raising the kids. I retired early from the Aurors at the end of my paternity leave and it’s been me and them ever since.”
They stroll down to Wand and Wood and step inside. At first glance, Harry can tell that Draco has chosen well. There’s row upon row of well-made furniture with a varying range of woods but all classic designs.
The stairs are an impossibility and he labours in the living room, kneeling and squatting against the couch in turn. He’s quite relieved when Healer Carr comes again and checks his progress.
“Exactly.” She slides her fingers in and continues. “Since the canal is already formed, all I’m doing at this point is looking for the membrane. It’s about the size of a Galleon and it feels a lot like really solid jelly. I use my outside hand to put pressure on the womb in the direction of the membrane and check for any bulging and especially any spots it may be tearing loose, which would mean premature labour is imminent.”
Harry puts the bread on a plate and shuts the finished salad in the cooling cupboard. “That’ll take about another half an hour in the oven. Would you like to see the rest of the house?”
“Why wouldn’t it go well?”
“Want to send them into a total tizzy?” Draco’s voice sounds mischievous.
“Go on, Harry,” she encourages, eyes a bit bright and voice a bit shaky.
Draco turns and waves his wand quickly over the closed door, setting his wards. “Would you like to pick up coffee? There’s a Costa just around the corner.”
“Hi, Hermione.” He smiles at the sight of his best friend. He loves being with Draco, but he has missed the time he and Hermione usually spent together.
“You’ve done a brilliant job with him, you know? Scorpius is a great kid. I’m glad Al’s had a friend like him.”
“The Healer said he’s so skinny there’s nowhere for the baby to hide,” Draco explains. “And he’ll be much bigger before this is over.”
“I’m pretty familiar now. Dad gave me several of the books Aunt Hermione got him to read when he first found out he was pregnant.”
“So I’ll have a bedroom? And a place for my stuff?”
“Oh…” Harry stutters and then immediately feels his cheeks heat. “Thank you; it would be much appreciated.” He steps back to allow Draco to order and pay for their drinks.
Harry suddenly feels Regulus shift and for a moment it feels as if that little body might burst out his spine. The pressure against his pelvis screams to new levels and suddenly he feels like his hips are being wedged forcibly apart.
“Harry, you don’t think…”
“Thank you.”
“Oh really? Who are you making all these plans with instead of making some with me?” she asks teasingly. Acutely uncomfortable, Harry braces himself to tell her, kindly, that he’s not interested in making plans with her any time soon.
Harry shuffles Matthew’s note under the second piece of paper and reads:
“I love you, too.” Draco releases his hold on Harry and threads their fingers together again.
They all pop into the living room of Potter Cottage and Harry is suddenly exponentially more nervous. Deep breath and forced smile, he faces the kids. James is looking at him knowingly and Harry wonders if he’s already figured out what’s coming.
“I AM exhausted,” Harry admits. “I slept horribly last night without you. We had training for our new project this morning, then a working lunch, then this imaging disaster all afternoon.”
, he’s missed this. Draco has taken brilliant care of him through everything, but there’s nothing that can take the place of
“We’ve got a bit before midnight. Shall we watch a movie or play some games?” Draco speaks up from beside him.
“I love you, too, Draco.” Harry’s half-closed eyes fill with tears. He’s completely petrified that something will go wrong and this will be the last time he sees Draco.
“James, why don’t you join the others in the living room for a few minutes. We want to have a discussion with Matthew, and then with both of you.”
Draco nips at his ear, then drags himself nearly out of Harry at an agonisingly slow pace.
“I think the baby knows you,” Harry grins. “It just happened again. It won’t be long before you can feel it, too.”
“Okay. I love you.”
“Yep!”
“That works. In the meantime, I don’t suppose we can go back to what we were doing before that letter arrived?” While he can’t have Draco the way he’d prefer, Harry had very much been looking forward to as much as they could do.
“I know we talked through everything related to the bedroom the other night, but I have a couple of things I want to…revisit, I guess.”
Harry bends to sign his name below Draco’s and his breath hitches. There, signed on the parchment in elegant penmanship is “Draco A. Potter” and somehow seeing it on paper for the first time makes it that much more real. He and Draco are
“I’m afraid so. They usually stare when I’m out alone or with the kids. The press knows to keep their distance, but they’ll still be following us around since our relationship is
.” He mutters and the pace accelerates. Harry lets a loud moan escape and his breath quickens further. A squelching sound replaces the silence of the room as his hole greedily accepts the repeated intrusion of the long, thick dildo.
“Well, yes, but you’re incredibly open with your kids about everything. I somehow expected it to be…less internally agonising.”
He rolls his eyes at himself.
“You’ve not screwed up anything, Harry.” Draco exhales. He runs his fingers along the arm that Harry’s thrown over him. “I just want to know what’s on your mind.”
“That’s fascinating! It sounds like you’re making great progress.” Draco sounds proud of him and for whatever reason, that makes Harry’s heart swell. “Will that case make its way to Potions for anything?”
Harry stretches and lifts himself to his feet before helping Draco off the couch. James hands them each a glass of sparkling cider.
“Bloody hell,” Harry mutters. He taps out his reply and sits with his finger hovering over the send button.
“Henry, here, went by ‘Harry.’ That’s who I was named after. And Fleamont—”
“You never did tell me what your lab’s working on now.”
Harry sighs and turns his head to Draco.
“We’ll put enough in to start it for you. Once we know more about long-term plans, we’ll make any changes needed.”
“I’m going to need new clothes.” Harry rests a hand on his belly. “I’m getting fat.”
Draco leads them to a tiny hole-in-the-wall Italian bistro, just across the street from CRMM, and they settle at a small table against the front window, perfect for a bit of people-watching with their lunch.
want to know you have what you need to be safe and enjoy sex if you're going to do it, and I
“Yes. Yes. Just like that. Godric, this feels amazing.” Harry’s voice is low and gravelly. He presses his arse back to meet the slow strokes.
going to die. Why would you think that?”
Last night had been wonderful. He and Draco are certainly as dynamic and compatible in the bedroom as they have found themselves to be outside of it, and Harry finds himself wanting to wake up like this every morning, not just today. He has been afraid it would feel uncomfortable, waking up next to someone again, but instead, he is comforted and…happy. Harry chuckles lightly to himself at the thought. Draco Malfoy makes him
Harry stares out over London and just enjoys how right it feels to be with Draco. Never in a million years did he expect to have a romantic relationship again. He certainly didn’t think it would be with a man. And he would have bet all his gold in Gringotts against it being Draco.
“Wow!” She’s never spent much time around a pregnant person, so Harry supposes she’s probably fascinated. He certainly was when Ginny was expecting James. Harry looks to his oldest son, who is staring into space and not eating the food in front of him.
Malfoy was decent enough when Harry had encountered him in the last several years. Harry’s middle son and Malfoy’s son are best friends and starting Third Year at Hogwarts together in Slytherin House. Albus had visited the Malfoys’ posh London flat and Scorpius had been to Potter Cottage dozens of times over the last two summers, but Harry and Malfoy have never interacted beyond coordinating visits and pick up times. They had certainly never gone out for tea together, even with the boys.
Draco’s tongue is replaced with fingers as he carefully stretches Harry open. Hips press back, desperate for more, deeper, faster and the groan at finding himself suddenly empty is involuntary.
“Thank you, Healer Carr. We just needed a moment to wrap our heads around the news.” Draco eases back around to sit next to Harry.
Harry stops running his fingers through Draco’s baby-soft hair and reaches for the remote as the credits begin to roll. Lifting his head from Harry’s lap, Draco sits up and stretches. They’d opted for a Friday night in at Potter Cottage instead of going out. Takeaway and a movie had been the perfect choice.
“You passed out. I went down to get you some tea, and I assume you went to the loo. I heard a crash and when I made it to our bedroom, you were unconscious halfway between our bed and the loo door. I brought you here. You’ve been out for several hours.”
“Oh?”
“May I?”
“I’m fine. It just takes a minute for everything to settle. Go on up and get unpacked, all of you.” Harry lifts a hand and sends their trunks upstairs.
? Harry wonders as he eases into the glider to watch Draco unshrink the crib, changing table, and dresser, all in the same white as the beadboard.
“I love both of you so much.”
Her hand continues moving and pressing at intervals. She finally seems to find what she’s looking for and presses more firmly for several moments, fingers twisting and pressing inside in response. Harry is watching her face intently for a clue but can gather nothing until she nods, lifts her outside hand, and withdraws her fingers. He winces in discomfort, despite the charm.
Harry can’t help but grin as Healer Carr rearranges the blankets and lowers the drape, leaving Harry’s large abdomen exposed.
Harry hugs Al and stands. “I’m going to go see how the unpacking is going, but Draco ordered dinner and it should be here in an hour or so.”
“We do.” Draco’s voice is full of pride as Healer Carr turns to him. “He’s incredibly bright. What he’s not telling you is that he’s considering Healer Training after Hogwarts, so he’s also very interested in the subject matter.” The more Draco has worked with James this summer, the more he’s encouraged James to study Healing and specialise in Mind Healing if that’s what he wants to do. Draco is convinced James’ only academic issue is a lack of confidence in himself.
“I would be quite all right with that. Come on, let’s go ride the Eye.” Draco leads Harry to a secluded entrance at the base of the London Eye, giving his name to the hostess.
“Hot cocoa?”
They stand there, just for a moment, and drink each other in.
“Can Draco feel? He couldn’t feel it earlier, but I think he could now.”
, Al.” Harry tries to paste on his most reassuring smile, despite feeling nauseous all over again.
“That’s it!” Healer Powell fairly crows. “He’ll be out in just a few more pushes if you go like that. Take a breath and go again as soon as you feel the urge!”
Harry shifts again against Draco. He can’t get comfortable. No matter how he lays, Regulus is pressing against something that shouldn’t be pressed against. He’s also very energetic, and Harry can clearly feel him moving around pretty much constantly.
“No better, then,” Draco sighs, disappears into the loo, and returns to perch on the bed next to Harry. There’s a
“You’re giving me a locker?” Draco’s voice is incredulous as he follows behind Harry.
“Lily!” he exclaims, scooping her up. “Oh, I’ve missed you!”
Harry draws his head out of the fire.
“It does. Just having you here helps. This,” Harry raises his cup slightly, “is just icing on the cake.”
Under the hot stream of the shower, Harry resumes his exploration of Draco’s mouth between shampoo and soap. Draco’s hands slip to his hips and pull him closer. Hard cocks rub together and desire jolts through Harry. The buzz in his mind that had been there in the locker room returns.
“Yes, Harry?” Hermione’s voice trembles the slightest bit as she locks eyes with him.
“Did you not want to go look with them?”
“I’m always hungry nowadays. But you need the Apothecary, and we need to go to a Gringotts branch. And frankly, I just need out of the house for a while. We can look at baby things if we want to drive the point home. And maybe stop at Pixies and Petit Fours?
“Of course.” Draco moves to the window. “It seems that James has written.”
Harry stumbles as he steps through to Minerva’s office. Thankfully, Draco knows the Floo is becoming even more difficult and is there to catch him.
“Goodnight, boys,” Harry says.
Harry swallows hard and feels his nerves rising. He’s never done this with anyone, but he knows what he wants — provided Draco is comfortable with it, as well.
Hermione rolls her eyes. “Right then. Upstairs?”
“When will
Harry heaves a breath and nods. He can do this. And as soon as he does, they can meet their son.
“I don’t know why I’m so nervous,” he confesses. “I suppose it’s because I want this to go well, but it seems silly. I already know I enjoy your company.”
“Healer Carr, thank you for coming.” He ushers her in and moves to sit on the edge of the bed next to Harry, taking his hand. “This is my fiancé, Harry.”
“Am I going to be dealing with Ministry officials?”
Harry grins. “We’re co-workers come Monday.”
“Yes, please.” Draco’s face is pinched with worry. “I need them both to be all right.”
“Of course not.”
“You, as well,” Draco says warmly. “I’m glad you could join us today.”
Silence is a strange look on his children, Harry decides as they shoulder their bags and head up the stairs. He turns to Draco and buries his head in the blond’s neck.
“I couldn’t have done it without you.” Harry studies the beautiful picture made of his husband holding their son. “Your support got me through it.”
“I’ll be sore, but I’ll be all right.” Harry waves a hand and a cleaning charm removes the evidence of his release from their chests and the slick of lube from his crevice. He leaves Draco’s release inside himself, though. For whatever reason, he doesn’t want to vanish that. He curls into Draco’s side, slinging an arm over his torso as Draco’s arm wraps around him.
“I do have my solicitor up to speed with the situation. We can have letters sent or action taken if you feel it’s ever warranted,” Draco tells Minerva.
“Good, because Merlin knows you wouldn’t do it yourself.” Hermione gives Draco a commiserating look before looking back to Harry. “Was it anything serious?”
“Agreed. I hate having to hide it, but I don’t want the kids to hear about this from the press,” Draco sighs.
“Neither do I. That was my great grandfather.” Draco pauses. “What about Etamin?”
Harry feels like he’s been punched in the gut. He knew James was going to be having sex soon enough, but knowing it might be happening and having confirmation are two entirely different things. Taking a deep breath, he forces himself to focus on the matter at hand, which is not the sex, but the aftermath. Draco seems to notice his struggle and helpfully takes the lead.
When the sobs have slowed, Harry steps back and surveys both boys. They’re puffy-faced and red-eyed and Harry’s heart breaks all over again for his son and the boy he cares so much for.
“A good curry sounds fantastic. I’m pretty much always game for Indian food.” Harry pauses. “
“You should probably call the Aurors for security. They’ll post a guard to ensure staff safety as well, in case someone gets wind of my admission.”
“Like what?”
“I am. We have imaging photos to show you if you’d like to see.” Harry smiles at Scorpius before turning his attention to Al.
want to be someone’s poster boy or public figure.” Harry wrinkles his nose.
“Of course. I’ll have it brought in when we’re done. But let’s have a look at your baby first.”
Harry’s heart soars at the easy way Draco speaks about their future and he’s sure there’s a sappy grin on his face. Albus meets Harry’s eye and there’s a rare full-faced Albus smile.
“Can I work?”
Harry nods slightly, and Draco squeezes his hand. “I’ll make sure he does.” Draco’s voice is firmer now.
“That’s phenomenal.” Harry’s voice is full of pride. “You’re amazing.”
“I love you, Al. I’ve missed you.”
“If I must,” Draco drawls, following Harry through the sitting room to the large, open kitchen.
“I feel like I’ve already screwed this up.” He chuckles softly.
Draco kisses Harry’s cheek, hugs James, and Apparates away. Harry knows when the doorbell rings over the phone less than ten seconds later that Draco didn’t use an approved Apparition point. He must have Apparated directly onto Matthew’s front stoop.
“You’re terrible.” Harry pauses. He hadn’t planned on stopping here today, but he also wouldn’t mind knowing what Draco likes. He does intend to marry him at some point, after all. “I wouldn’t mind looking at some rings with you, though. Driving the press a bit mad will be a bonus.”
They’re much later getting ready to head out than Harry had anticipated, but the languorous sex in the shower had been well worth it. Draco had pinned Harry’s arms above his head under the shower stream with one hand, worked him open with the other, and slid deep inside him before pounding against his prostate until he came untouched. After their first time on Thursday, they’ve been nearly insatiable and Harry is enjoying being properly fucked thoroughly and often.
“This weekend? Saturday evening maybe?”
“It is. I made a larger batch of both, but James doesn’t need a huge supply at school, so I bottled these for him to take. Do you have the box ready?”
James nods in understanding.
“It sounds like you had a good conversation,” Hermione states matter of factly.
“That’s perfect.”
“Have you taken any pain-relief potion?
Instead of reaching out for the spoon, Draco stands from his stool and steps towards Harry. He puts his hand on the spoon, partially over Harry’s hand, and guides it to his own mouth. Harry’s eyes widen slightly and his other hand automatically comes up below Draco’s chin to catch any drips.
“No. Your dad didn’t even know he was a carrier. We were just as surprised as you.” Draco’s voice is gentle but resolute. “But we’re very happy about it.”
“I know.” Draco reaches for the shampoo. “I’m just nervous.”
“Harry…” Draco’s moan sounds like a desperate plea, then he presses his cock deep into Harry’s arse and Harry feels himself being filled.
“Tired?”
“Maybe our birthstones instead of all diamonds?” Harry ponders.
James glances between Harry and Draco and takes a breath.
“He shifted somehow during that one, I think. It feels like he’s wedged in between my hips now. It’s like being split in two. This is awful.”
“I am.”
Harry thinks through his last two encounters with Draco.
“That exactly.” Silence stretches between them as they hear the fireplace come to life.
“Harry…Harry…Harry…” Draco’s voice is filled with lust as Harry’s name falls repeatedly from his lips.
Draco toes off his shoes and Harry quickly does the same before they both sink onto the soft blanket.
“I’m so happy for both of you!”
“I’ll write to her some time this week then. I’ll let her know we are very much in love and happy and thrilled to be expecting our sixth child.” Draco’s hands find their way to Harry’s belly, caressing the place where their son lies. “I’ll also tell her that her opinions are not needed or wanted, and that she can kindly keep them to herself in the future. We can ward against her letters if she doesn’t get the message.”
“We can secure tutoring if you’d like, James, but I’d be happy to help you study this summer. I’m certain your Aunt Hermione would, as well.” Draco smiles. “You do realise we were the top two in our year at Hogwarts, yes?”
“I don’t necessarily
“I think I might be starting.” Harry manages a smile. “I think we might get to meet our son today.”
“Draco. I need to say this. This is experimental and we both know it.” Harry takes a deep breath. “If something happens to me, please take care of my kids. Custody, as well as the house and vaults, are already arranged. The paperwork is in the warded drawer in the desk in our study. Just in case.”
“Do you feel better now?” There’s an easiness to Draco’s voice now that Harry hadn’t realised was missing before.
“I’ve enjoyed that, as well.” Harry smiles, remembering. “I like being touched just about anywhere but my armpits and my feet.”
This was what Harry had been afraid of. He clenches his fists loosely and continues, needing confirmation of his suspicions. “Would being possessed by a dark wizard regularly over the course of several months potentially cause damage?”
“She’s flirting with you, Potter!”
Lily comes thundering down the stairs as quickly as she’d gone up them and thrusts a DVD case into her dad’s hands.
“Going back for the others?” Harry looks over to Draco, who nods.
“We haven’t set a date or anything, Lil. We’ll be engaged before we do that.”
Draco leans in and presses his lips gently to Harry’s. Harry grins into the kiss and then steps back.
“I found this one most useful when I was looking for stars or constellations that would work for names. We’ll have to switch to the other if we look at planets and moons.”
“Faster, Draco. Please…” Harry is surprised at the desperation in his own voice. The hands on his belly grip more firmly, and the pace becomes more frantic. Canting his arse back, Harry pushes each of Draco’s thrusts against his prostate and he cries out.
Harry lifts a hand and levitates the plates of curry to the table, Hermione following behind with extra rice and a basket of naan.
“I don’t think I’m up for sucking you off, but maybe something else?”
“Come in.” Harry is leaning against the headboard of the bed, Draco next to him, both reading. He shoots a look to Draco, who shrugs. It’s been four days since the kids got home and Matthew came to stay with them. Things finally seem to be settling into something resembling normalcy.
“Do you want to see if she wants to come through for dinner? Did you make enough?”
“Thank Merlin.”
Harry sighs and hits the reset button on his Magiscope again. He’s beyond frustrated, and the other three members of his lab team left almost an hour and a half ago. Having had such a wonderful weekend with Draco, today has been completely awful. After two mornings waking in Draco's arms, waking up alone this morning started the whole day off on a sour note. The morning had seen Harry and his lab mates in training for their new project, so he had been mentally exhausted long before noon. Then, his entire department had to have a working lunch for a meeting that could have been a memo, and now, he can’t seem to untangle the mass of magic in this core imaging without screwing up the whole thing. Pressing his face to the eyepiece, he lifts his wand to try again.
“All set, then?”
“So we’ll all be Potters?” Al asks excitedly.
“I thought maybe you and I could go into wizarding London today and pick out new bedroom furniture. What I have now isn’t enough room for both of our stuff, and it would be something that’s
“That would be great, Mr Potter.”
“It will. What do you have left to do before Healer Carr arrives?”
By the time Harry's finished the washing up and cleaned up the kitchen, two more owls are impatiently tapping the window panes. Pushing open the window, he ushers in Woody first. Woody, ostensibly named after Oliver Wood, one of James’ favourite quidditch players, allows Harry to untie the parchment before nipping him on the ear and going to join Cupcake. “You’re a right arsehole, you are,” Harry grouses at the bird. Midnight, Albus’ owl, hoots softly where she waits by the window as Harry removes the final parchment and gives her a quick pat. “Go on then, girl. Have some treats and rest.”
Harry feels Draco shrug behind him and his heart aches at Draco’s willingness to give up his chance at a loving relationship, to just accept never being able to have that in favour of doing what was necessary for him.
Draco chuckles into his ear.
“Is it over?” Harry whispers. He realises it must be. He can feel his magic again, so they’ve clearly administered the antidote. He opens his eyes to look into Draco’s relief-filled grey ones. A glance around reveals he’s back in his hospital room.
knows
“I’ll talk with him tomorrow, and we can try to set something up for him either at Hogwarts or starting over Easter.”
He can’t explain how or why he knows he needs to stand, but his body screams at him to be on his feet.
“Are you all right?” Malfoy inquires.
Draco slips an arm around Harry’s waist and squeezes gently. “You haven’t looked at your mobile, have you?” he asks with amusement in his voice.
“Probably.” Scorpius stares at his shoes.
Harry turns at the sound of James’ voice and sees all four kids plus Matthew hurrying towards them. He grins at the sight. He’s missed having all of them under one roof.
“James,” Draco sighs, “the only issue you have is your self-confidence. You do realise we have covered
“Great Godric’s ghost!” A glance in the direction of the sound leads to a woman staring wide-eyed at his stomach.
“Can I stay, dad?” James asks softly. “I’d like to know what this is like. It’ll be me someday, I hope.”
“Harry.” Minerva’s voice is thick with emotion. She steps towards Harry and envelops him in a tight hug. “You seem so happy. It’s about time you get something good in life.”
Harry studies the case of rings, trying to imagine what he’d like Draco to slide onto his finger. There are some truly ostentatious designs, and some that are more plain than he would prefer. But on the back row, Harry spots something he likes.
Harry runs his eyes down his body again and heads into the bathroom. He has a meeting with the new Department Head at the Center for Rare Magical Maladies in about twenty minutes and Draco had promised him these clothes were appropriate. He wonders if he’ll get to see Draco and if it would be appropriate to find him afterwards to ask him to go to lunch. Shrugging to himself, he reaches for the Sleekeazy’s and sets to work on the rest of his appearance.
“We haven’t really decided.” He smiles at his fiancé. “Draco and I will be together for the long run no matter when we get married. We’ll figure out what’s right for all of us.”
“I’d like that very much.” Harry tips his head again and offers up his mouth to Draco, who immediately bends his head to kiss him back. Harry pulls away gently.
“Al, why don’t you come with us? Your dad can Side-Along James and Lily and I can take you and Scorp.” Draco smiles.
“Give me your hand, Harry.”
“Harry!” Draco’s voice drifts up the stairs. The man in question makes his way, slowly, to the top of the stairs.
Before he can reach for the reset button again, he feels hands on his waist. Harry jumps and turns around. Draco’s beautiful silver eyes are gazing at his face with concern.
“Harry. You’re due in
“But Lil…why are you asking me that?”
A delighted grin from Draco makes Harry’s pixies take up their dancing once more. “Absolutely!” They set off down the hill side by side. “That’s one of the downsides to having a flat in London proper. No place to play Quidditch.”
“I don’t think so.” Harry runs his fingers through his hair again and sighs. “And we didn’t go get dinner. He came over here instead. I cooked.” He gestures vaguely towards the hob before moving his hands back into his unruly locks.
“Of course not. But he invented Sleekeazy’s. That’s where my family got all their gold. I still get a quarterly payout from them. It was part of the terms of sale when he sold the company.”
“Your pregnancy appears viable, and you’re right where you should be for four weeks along. Your body is also doing a proper job of adapting.” The Healer removes her gloves and turns her attention back to the two men. “Now, what questions do you have?”
“Nearly done, Harry! Next contraction, a big push for his shoulders.”
“Oh, that’s wonderful!”
Harry can’t help but roll his eyes. “You’re incorrigible, love.”
“I love you. I never expected to have a chance to fall in love and be happy, and I most certainly didn’t expect that chance to come with you. But now, I can’t imagine my life any other way.”
James' face is pale, but he leans forward to smack his brother upside the head. "So's every gay man at Hogwarts."
“What…what if I told you you’ll have to turn over for me to get what I’m thinking of?”
“What’s the matter?” Draco is already dressed and perched on the dressing bench, tugging on his socks.
“I’m sorry.” Harry breathes a relieved sigh as the potion takes effect.
“I trust you to do what you feel is right for our family in regards to her.” Harry has no clue how to best handle Narcissa Malfoy, so he’ll leave that to Draco. All in all, she is a non-issue for them and their future. Even if she could take Draco’s vaults, it still wouldn’t deter them.
“You never said Wizarding Wedgies were off limits!” he wheezes, arms going around Draco and holding him upright.
“Draco, you did nothing wrong. It just caught me off-guard.” Harry squeezes Draco’s hand lightly. “Come on, then. Let’s head for that curry you promised me.”
“Slowly. Watch the monitoring charms. We can move the fetal stasis monitor for now.”
Harry feels his cheeks take on just a hint of heat at the open inspection he’s being given. “It hit me harder than I thought it would. I’ve never been without at least one of the kids — not since Ginny died.” Harry sips his tea and sighs softly. “I’ve never even left them overnight with anyone. I just couldn’t. Even when James and Al had gone to Hogwarts, I still had Lily. I even did all their tutoring and schooling myself.”
“No, I’m not. I’m right here.” Draco heads for his usual chair beside Harry, pausing to help Harry undress beneath the blankets.
“Yes.” Harry is grateful to have Draco’s presence at this moment and smiles back at him. “I have just never been very graceful using the Floo.”
They stand, spent, still entwined under the shower for long minutes. Harry makes an effort to memorise this feeling — Draco inside him, wrapped in strong arms, both of them radiating love and contentment.
“I’m ready,” Harry groans. “You can go hard, you won’t hurt me. I don’t think I’m going to last much longer.”
Harry whimpers desperately. ”I want to feel you inside me.”
“Never?” Draco sounds shocked. “Not even as a child?”
“That should be fine.” Healer Carr waves her wand and her equipment begins packing itself neatly away. “I’m sure you gentlemen have much to discuss, but Mr Malfoy, if you would be so kind as to see me to the Floo, I will pass back the recipe for the long-acting anti-nausea and enough doses to get you through the time required to brew it.”
