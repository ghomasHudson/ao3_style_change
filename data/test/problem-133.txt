"Someone released a troll in the dungeons," The young ones gasped in fear except Harriet, "And we wanted to make sure everyone was safe and here because we had to guide the students back to their common rooms."
"Ewww!" The girls squealed. The day soon ended with Merry and Harry promising to text each other as soon as they got home. Harry used a floo to get back home to Mr. Feose. She was greeted with black gates. She knocked on the gates.
"Okay fine," She sighed and pulled back her blankets. They grabbed their robes and brooms while Harriet let Beetlejuice sleep and digest a mouse that he ate earlier. They walked quietly out of their dorm and common room. They then sprinted towards the Quidditch field. As they snuck in, Merry climbed on the broom first and took off. Harriet got on next and just floated for a bit. Merry twirled and dropped in the air while laughing. Harriet took off slowly and learned how to turn and go faster by herself, she read a lot of books on how to fly.
"Would you like to get her supplies?" The sales woman laughed. The three of them walked to the back to get a bed, food, and toys.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Just watch some Netflix," Merry pulled out her phone and handed it to Harry. Harry searched until she found a show called A Series of Unfortunate Events and started watching it out loud while Merry did her hair. Harry went through two full episodes which took two hours until Merry was done with her hair.
"That's good," Draco nodded in approval.
"History of Magic," They turned a left turn into a group of older boys. Harriet let a little squeak escape her mouth. "Sorry!" She turned her head to the ground and started to step aside for them.
"We didn't want the troll to die because we are aware of what happens to the trolls that are caught," Harriet explained.
"I'm going, my parents force me to every year."
"Great so do I!"
"Very good Potter, 10 points to Slytherin," He smiled. She smiled brightly and sat a bit straighter. She got points for her house already!
Dark Magic: -
"Pretty good, you?" She still says in a Scottish accent.
"Trip to Scotland," He said in his most Scottish voice which made Harry giggle.
"Tired from working two shifts but better now cause I saw you," He taps her nose while she blushes. He is a very attractive man, 19 years old, even Harry can see that.
"Do you want to see?" Merry asked. Harry nodded so Merry took a picture of the back of her hair. She gasped at seeing her hair so fancy because she was used to it being a rats nest. Merry showed her makeup also which made Harry blush. She looked so pretty! Harry was about to say something when a knock came from the door. It was thrown open to reveal a bushy haired girl and a chubby round faced boy.
"Thanks," Harriet smiled back. Daisy flew back over to her original position when Marcus scowled at her for not practicing. Harriet for some reason thought back to Merry and her's conversation about attractive boys. Mark wasn't bad looking, what do people even look for in guys? Smart? Kind? Selfless? Patrick was quite shy and Derek seemed to hate everything. Pucey though was really nice to her and always liked to pat her head. Flint also was very nice to her and liked to ruff her hair. They both always went up to her and talked to her even when they weren't playing Quidditch. But Daisy also did that, could girls like other girls? Her Uncle and Aunt always said things like faggots and homosexuals burn in hell. Would she burn in hell if she fell in love with a girl? Harriet had to ask Merry some questions about this later. She looked up and made eye contact with Flint, her chest burned a bit and her face flushed. Why was this happening? Is this what it is like to have a crush on someone?
"Is it wrong?"
"Right after Snape lectured us about how we would hate the consequences of sneaking out," Merry sat up, mouth opened.
"Do you have everything?" Cara shouted after them.
"Slick!" She shouted and jumped into his arms.
"Because my family is dark." He sighed, he already knew why. He must deal with people not trusting him a lot due to his parents.
"Thank you for taking time out of your schedule to help me," She smiled up at him which made him ruffle her hair. She giggled loudly at his huge hand making a huge mess out of her hair.
Harriet sat down across from her and in between Pucey and Flint. Shit. "Bit nervous," She mumbled and smiled nervously.
"We have to go find a compartment soon," Merry notified Harry.
"Hello yes, the usual. Alright thank you," Mr. Feose said into the phone.
"She said to bring food," She smiled. "But we have to stay there the entire time cause I told her that Herbology was canceled..."
"Oh then I will come back after I go to Gringotts," Harry said excitedly. Harry loves to read no matter what the book may be. They said goodbye then Harry left to find Gringotts. She walked for awhile in a crowded street with more adults than kids. She soon found a tall white marble building that loomed over the street. Harry walked in to see people scattered at different counters either looking bored or frustrated and the goblins looking the same. She walked up to one who didn't seem busy.
"Well, I guess he could be," He tried to make it better. Harry nodded as if he did make it better.
"We all will be cheering in the stands for you," Merry smiled brightly.
"You can sit you know," Millicent gestured to the seat across from her. Merry and Harry sat down. Harry eyed Millicent's cat wondering what the cat would think of Beetlejuice.
"That's a phoniex," Harriet said to no one in particular. Flint grunted in acknowledgment.
The next morning, Harriet made breakfast for her family. She wanted them to know that she cared for them. She was only insulted and smacked upside the head with a frying pan because she burnt a few things. She also was pushed down multiple times that day by her cousin. Every insult became less and less harsh throughout her life, 'freak' by her family, 'bitch' from Dudley's friends, 'weirdo' from the other kids in school, and even 'loser' from a few girls who sometimes would pour their lunches onto her. The only ones who would ever talk nicely about her would be her teachers, saying how hard working she is, how kind she is. How brilliant she is, how independent she is, how she can solve problems so quickly and by herself. Harriet soon put all of her effort into her studies, since it was the only thing she was praised on, her family hated her cooking and drawing so she put all of her work into her grades. It was the only thing she could do to find at least one sentence of praise and she learned so much in the process, she also learned cooking and drawing tips so she can impress her family with it.
"Dean Thomas," He saluted her with two fingers. She giggled at his gesture which made the boy smile triumphantly. The bell soon rang which signaled class was starting. The professor Flitwick took attendance which he fell out of his seat, well off of his stack of books, when he called her name. The class laughed as she ran to help him up.
"Hello Harry, how have you been?" Mr. Feose smiled while counting coins behind the counter.
"Oh hush, at least your hair isn't dead anymore," Merry brushed through her hair. Merry finished with her hair and changed in front of both Harry and Pansy. Harry could never do that, she can just feel their eyes on her body that was once bruised and broken. Pansy started to brush her teeth at a different sink. There were six different sinks and six showers. The showers were just a gray curtain to cover the shower, that is not a lot of privacy. Soon everyone was laying down to sleep. Harry shut her curtains after saying goodnight to everyone. She pulled out her phone to see that it was 10:30. She watched some cartoon comedy that just ended up confusing Harry. She checked her phone again, 12:23. Harry pulled back a curtain to see everyone asleep and someone was snoring lightly, probably Millicent. Harry tiptoed to Merry's closed bed and pulled back the curtains slightly.
"Have a wonderful first day everyone," He smiled and left behind a very dramatic Snape. The girls left to explore the castle and hopefully eat soon.
But don't judge on what you see,
"Everyone pick their favorite tune," Dumbledore said while twinkles in his eyes, "And here we go!" There were the words of the song in the air so the first years could know what to sing.
"I promise to train extra hard," He chuckled deeply at her excitement and determination. He only seemed to grunt, growl, or shrug for most of his answers.
Everyone looked very scary to her, everyone looked so powerful and wise. She hid and watched the elegant people talking and dancing, it had a very odd feeling to it which gave Harriet the shivers. The ballroom was stunning, it was emerald and marble stone with jewels everywhere and a giant chandiler in the middle of the room. Lucius was talking to a group of powerful men in dark robes, Narcissa was laughing with some other housewives. Riley and Cara were talking to Mr. Feose? Mr. Feose isn't a pureblood by any means, nor should he hold any politic power. Riley was sipping his drink lightly while observing him like a true Slytherin, steathy and gathering information before striking him with a question which would destroy Mr. Feose's composure. Cara was frowning at him and Mr. Feose was chuckling carelessly. Harriet continued to wonder why Riley and Cara were talking to him until she saw a flash of purple, it was Merry dragging Draco to what Harriet guessed to be another doorway. She also saw some other younger kids depart from their parents who were deep into conversation. Harriet quickly ran from the ballroom, watching out for anyone. She ran back into Draco's room, she bent over panting with her hand on her chest. She flopped onto Draco's bed and grabbed a book that she was reading from that afternoon, she read only a few sentences before there was a knock on the door.
"Riley knows how to heal, he studied healing when he was younger," Merry explained.
"They were excellent people, brilliant also. Your father was an Auror which is like a magical police officer. He loved pranks and jokes. He was loyal and brave to the very core. Your mother was an Auror also and she was the most brilliant witch of her age. She aced every course throughout her 7 years of schooling. She had a temper when it came to your father," He started to chuckle at this. "She always would tell him off if he needed it. She was brave also like your father." He sighed and shifted in his chair. "They- they were so young when they passed. Younger than me even." He rubbed his temples and gulped. "Are you sure you want to know how they died?"
"I'm just telling the truth," Pucey smiled mischievously and shrugged.
Thank you guys for the kudos, they mean a lot!
"I don't know," Harry sat back down. A few more hours passed with Merry on her phone and Harry and Millicent reading.
You can keep your bowlers black,
"I expect my students to come to class on time," She pressed her lips together in a line, reminding Harry of her Aunt.
The room filled with silence, everyone knew the answer was quite gruesome and cruel.
"Really?" Harriet was surprised, she knew some places in the Muggle world were having trouble accepting the idea.
"Okay thanks," Harriet's eyes started to water up, how did she deserve these awesome friends?
"Sure," Oh crap, "Well like I said Abbott, MacMillan, Flint, Malfoy, again of course, Parkinson, Greengrass, Bulstrode, Carrow, Nott, Longbottom, Weasley, and Fawley. There is also Burke," Harriet knows there is a portrait of a Burke that encourages Slytherins to call muggleborns Mudbloods, she avoids that painting at all costs. "Avery which the youngest is a friend of Snape, Black which almost every single Pureblood family has at least one Black in it, my mother even was a Black before she married my father. There is Crouch, which really isn't talked about by any prideful Pureblood. Also Rowle, Selwyn, Shafig, Travers, Yaxley are all again in political power or in Azkaban for being a death eater. Shacklebolt is high in political power, very high but only tends to work on the light side of the Wizarding world. The one no one talks about is Gaunt, Gaunt ended technically after Riddle died, Tom Riddle," Draco's voice squeaked a bit when saying his name, "But Gaunt is in other families so it continues to live on. The same thing happened with Prewett, all true members died but it was continued on due to being included in other families."
"Harry's just is excited to see the library," Merry laughed, still on the couch.
Harriet giggled, "You can call me Harry, but Morning Neville." He nodded shyly and turned back to his Hogwarts: A History copy. She noticed that Hermione was staring at her, more like glaring a bit. Harry smiled brightly and waved excitedly, trying to make a new friend. Hermione seemed confused by her waving but smiled back slightly in return before reading again. Harriet nodded to herself, she really did want to have lots of friends in this school. This was a chance to start off new. She sat down by Merry and looked over her prepared notes for the lesson. Mr. Feose had multiple lesson plans for each class so she prepared notes and objectives to learn. She also wrote down key ideas and events from the wars.
(See the end of the chapter for
"So no," She clicked her tongue, "Alrighty then." She sipped her pumpkin juice with her eyes wide open. Flint slapped Pucey upside the head.
"Look Albus," he relaxed a bit which made Albus become hard and stiff, Slytherins don't show anger so they are known to relax before striking and poisoning their prey. "I'm a reasonable man, but I do believe what you are doing is quite illegal."
"Careful don't want to give him a big head," Merry chuckled.
Set Gryffindors apart;"
She had a bruise on her face for weeks the time she accidentally called Petunia 'Mom', because how dare a spectacled small girl call her 'Mom'. She was only a freak. Nothing else. She was 5 at that time. She was 6 when her Aunt told her how her parents died, and how she burned or got rid of their belongings. She was 6 when her Uncle put a lock on her cupboard because she tried to sleep with them like Dudley did when he had a nightmare. She was 7 when she found out her real name, she honestly thought her real name was freak since her family never called her anything other than that. She was 9 when she thought about running away, but she was too scared, she never had an courage. She was 10 when she became so bored with her everyday life, she wanted to change it but had no idea. She wanted to feel something but she couldn't explain what she wanted to feel, possibly happiness or passion. She never knew though. She didn't quite understand those feelings to begin with.
"Please, you don't have to do that. It feels weird because we are the same age."
"Do you want them?" Ms. Haack asked as Harry read the summary excited. Harry looked up and smiled really wide as she nodded. Ms. Haack smiled back as she checked out the series of book. The warning bell rang which meant 10 minutes until classes start. The two quickly said goodbye and Harry dashed to her English class. English was a yes and no subject for her. She loved writing, reading, and truly understanding the book by stripping it down and analyzing it. But she hated learning grammar and how to write. She huffed when she saw Piers and Dudley waiting outside of the class. They both saw her and smirked.
"And why is that?" He asked interestedly. She just looked around and tapped where her scar was which was hidden by makeup. He somehow understood and motioned her to follow him. She followed him into a room with a table and two chairs.
Whether we be old and bald
"He must be a prefect, they help patrol the school," Merry explained as they quickly ran back to the dungeons. Harry just wondered what Cedric would have thought about them breaking the rules on their very first night. They ran to their common room door, Merry almost missed it which made Harry laugh. Harry said the password and they quickly made their way to their dorm. They slipped in unnoticed and quickly put away their robes and wands.
"How do you fall asleep then? I always have to take sleeping pills to fall asleep cause I'm a very light sleeper. So I need a really strong pill to knock me out for the whole night," Harriet chuckled, she found sleeping in a room with other girls very odd for some reason. She was too used to quiet nights alone so hearing people shifting when they sleep or making any noise in general really put her on edge. Therefore she became very restless and she needed a higher dosage to keep her asleep all night.
Merry came in first with Draco trailing behind her like a puppy, "Sorry it took so long. Yaxley wouldn't shut up about his latest investment." Merry snorted while Draco rolled his eyes.
"I- I- I," She stumbled out, tears started to build up in her eyes but she didn't want to rub them. If she cried would they make her warm milk like they did for Dudley? Would they let her watch the tele for an hour?
"I bet he was," She chuckled into her hand quietly, she can imagine the little terror Draco was as a toddler. He probably was very bratty but also quite adorable while loving cuddles. Before either of them could say anything more, there was a loud shout from the entrance of the mansion. Narcissa was the first to get up while Harriet trailed after her, keeping a reasonable distance. There was laughing as they turned the corner, they saw Lucius off to the side covering his mouth chuckling. Draco was drenched with snow and his clothes were becoming wet from the melting snow and Merry was holding an empty bucket crying from laughing. Draco's face was bright red when he saw his mother and Harriet also smiling at his wettened state. His ears were bright pink from the cold and embarrassment and there was a pile of snow on top of his head which almost blended in with his hair.
"Pleasure to meet you, Merry," He said sweetly.
"Hello Harriet, I'm Narcissa and this is my husband, Lucius," She turned to her quiet husband who was observing the small girl in front of him.  Draco's mother stepped forward a bit and seemed to bend down a bit, more to Harriet's level. Narcissa held out her hand for Harriet to shake, Harriet gently shook her hand while hiding a bit behind her blanket. Narcissa smiles very kindly which surprised Draco, neither of his parents aren't that kind to strangers right away.
"I think we need a new feather over here professor," Harriet said. Dean threw his head back laughing which led to the whole class laughing at her comment.
"Like..."
"That is all," He sneered at her and broke the eye contact first which made her smirk and him growl when he figured out her game. "Tomorrow I shall have out your schedules. Have a pleasant slumber," And with that, he left. Merry was giggling and shaking, Harry looked at her worriedly.
"No just like a bunch of blankets and pillows on the floor," She explained. The guys nodded and threw all of the pillows and blankets on the floor leaning against Pansy's bed which was across from the television. Harriet got out of bed which made Draco almost drop the pitcher of pumpkin juice, she didn't have pants on! She was in a sweatshirt and underwear! And the sweatshirt really didn't cover her arse so... sweet Merlin why does she look so cute? More importantly, why are there cacti on them that have sombreros?
"Yes Master Draco?" He puffed out a bit tiredly.
"Daphne Greengrass," A pretty blond girl smiled at her.
~Words~    I am going to use this for when animals talk or when Harry talks back.
This made Harry smirk, she knew she was going to be in Slytherin.
"But enough of them, let's get you two a wand. And remember the wand chooses the witch. Merry you first," She gulped and moved forward slowly. In under 5 minutes, Merry had her wand, 10-inch elk wood with unicorn hair core which was good for charms and hexes.
Harry was nibbling on a slice of cheese pizza, Mr. Feose never even heard about pizza. He was very eager to eat muggle food whenever he had the chance. Harry never had pizza either but Dudley absolutely loves it and has it all of the time.
~I don't like you,~ Hissed Autumn. Yeah, she hated Harry.
"I don't know," Harriet whispered back. The whole class looked at her wondering what she could have done. Harriet got up and turned to the young man.
"Here is the- ah, Slick, where have you been?" Mr. Feose sets the ice down and claps him on the back.
"Well they are not the worse I guess," He grumbled.
"Thank you, that was very helpful Draco," She smiled, "I didn't expect you to explain so much to me, thank you very much."
"He is very adventurous, I can tell he likes to explore," Harry smiled.
Harry was going to say something to him but Snape sneered at her again, "Why do you have a potion book? More importantly a seventh-year potion book?"
"Cedric," Harriet grabbed onto his cloak which made him melt, "We need you help, I really don't want the troll to die. Do you?" She pouted. There it is, the Slytherin in her doing something for her advantage. Well its more to the trolls advantage to living but still.
"You said some boys are really nice and smart?"
"That is a very helpful subject, I think mine is going to be potions," Harriet smiled.
"Anguis," Jason snarled at the door which opened immediately. Harry smiled because she knew anguis was Latin for snake. They walked in one by one.
"Not that I know of, but if you don't come back I'm sure one of your friends will grab your stuff," He smiled. Harriet gave Merry one last nervous look before she left.
"Yeah like every other week or so."
"What does it sound like to you?" Harry asked.
Harriet heard the door open again and she turned away from Marcus and his friends talking to look at a sharp looking man. He had deep cheekbones and his hair was perfectly set, even more than Draco's. His eyes flickered onto her emerald ones, his stare burned into her. She looked down shyly and turned back to Marcus, she shuffled closer to him and shivered knowing that the man was still looking at her back. Marcus noticed her move closer to him and he wrapped a blanket around her. He flinched when he saw the reason why she shifted closer to him.
"Yes I am," Harry blushed and played with her hair. She would play with her skirt or the buttons on her blouse but she had nothing to show off to impress him like Merry did. But she could impress him with her intelligence! Could her intelligence impress a Hufflepuff?
And don't get in a flap!
"What I bet this boat was never clean?" Merry whined. They had to wait a bit to make sure all of the first years were in the boats. When they were ready to go the large man got into a bigger boat and they all took off. Harry let her fingertips touch the water gliding along the surface of the water. Merry elbowed her in the ribs gasping.
And unafraid of toil;"
(See the end of the chapter for
"Do you need something Harriet?" She asked while putting her book down to give Harriet her full attention. Harriet jumped a bit at the idea of her being concerned for her well being.
Where you ought to be.
"We can do those later, they can wait," Merry yawned and got into bed. Harry nodded to herself and got under the sheets.
"You think?" She can't be that good.
"Harriet!" She heard someone scream. She looked up to see a bludger coming at her, she dropped a few feet so it glided over her. Harriet continues to go after the snitch, the bludgers coming at her started to add up. Flint was screaming at Mark and Patrick to actually do their job. She stopped to catch her breath way up in the air while the other seeker lost the snitch. Sweat was dripping down her face from all of the maneuverings she had to do in order to not get hit by the bludgers. It seemed like even the Gryffindor beaters were trying to keep them away from her. The crowd was filling with murmurs of confusion. She spotted the snitch again, she pushed the tip of her broom down to go forward.
"Blaise probably has been having his ear being talked off for the last 10 minutes," Pansy laughed. The other girls laughed in agreement. Malfoy really seemed to be the talker in the group. As the girls started to get closer to the open field, Merry tugged on the back of her robes to make them both stop.
"You don't care about looks?"
"But I want to stay here," Harry pouted, she really liked the library and how nice and quiet it was.
Sorry for the late upload, summer classes have been getting in the way lately.
She is magic.
"Whatever, now come over here and sit your little arse down," Pansy tisked. "We didn't come here for nothing."
"Ms. Potter!" He said abruptly, trying to make her jump but she didn't. "What would you get if you add powdered root of asphodel and infusion of wormwood?" He sneered. She could see out of the corner of her eye that Hermione raised her hand way up in the air and practically stood. Snape ignored her and just looked at Harriet waiting for an answer.
Harriet pushed her backpack more onto her shoulder and walked faster. She was running late to get to school because it was the day her parents died and she wasn't in the mood to even move. She quickly ran to class, attempting to not come in contact with Dudley and his gang. She quickly threw her backpack down and sat in her seat quietly. She listened to the older kids talk about what they are going to do for Halloween. Most talked about going trick or treating or some were going to parties with their parents. Harry really didn't understand either, she didn't have parents nor has she ever went trick or treating. Dudley always went with his 'friends' all of the time, he would always come home and rub how much candy he got in her face. She never took any candy because she almost got her hand cut off the last time she tried to eat some food when her Uncle wasn't looking. The teacher came in wearing a witches costume. Harriet secretly wondered if real witches wore those type of clothes. The teacher took the whole period talking about a scary Halloween story about how witches took the life out of children to make them younger. Later to bring justice, the villagers burnt the witches to death. Harriet shivered in her seat, it seemed so brutal to burn the witches alive. Dudley and Piers were whispering and smirking in front of her, that can't be a good thing.
"Yeah, what year are you guys in?" Merry flirted while Harry blushed and looked down.
"Harriet, you are the best of our year, you are definitely smarter than me," Harriet chuckled a bit at that, "Why do you think you're weird?"
"Was it magic or did you just suddenly know?" Merry's eyes were wide and her arms gesturing everywhere.
Just do your best, we’ll do the rest,
"What's up?" She looked worried and sat back down by her. "Are you alright?" She placed her hand on her forehead.
"Do you know what this breed is?" The sales woman asked.
Fear her anger.
"Thank you Mr. Dobby sir," She thanks him gently. Dobby's huge eyes start to water and his ears fold in a bit, she starts to apologize in fear she never meant to upset him.
"Wait what?" Merry asked confused.
"Thought so," Merry laughed. They walked quietly to potions class and as they walked in Harriet almost fell.
"He was a seventh year when I was a first year. He did also tutor and help teach potions later on," Riley explained. Harry nodded and looked at her feet wanting to ask questions about her parents and why she had to live with the Dursley's. Riley realized her hesitation to say something but did not say anything.
"We aren't scared of the name," Harriet looked up at Merry to make eye-contact, "We are scared of what he did and what he did to many that we loved. He basically transformed most of the Purebloods into his killing slaves because he fed off of their fear for their families. Now the thoughts and actions he did, transferred onto the older generation of Purebloods which causes our generation to be seriously harmed. He tore apart the Wizarding world and created a large divide between wizards. That's why we are scared, Harriet," Merry's eyes were wet again. Harriet hated to see her cry, she didn't know how to fix her worries, maybe time will heal them and create new strengths.
"It is her enemy when she is awake and her best friend when she sleeps," Merry explained. Harry wondered if Beetlejuice would like a stuffed animal while she let him go under her shirt. He loved to wrap around her torso. Millicent was putting Autumn in her cage while the cat promised to harm Harry which made her laugh quietly. Harry sat by the window as the train slowed down, her heart was in her throat. Merry held her hand comfortingly.
"Flint," Riley said softly while he grunted again in reply, "I have just found your new seeker."
"We just got a new series of mystery novels this morning," Ms. Haack said excitedly as she held up three books. Harry gasped as she examined the book covers. Ms. Haack gave the books to her to look at. Harry slowly grabbed one of them and turned to the back to read the summary.
"Want to have a little fun?" Harry smirked.
Light Magic: -
"Today is the day that Harriet's parents died, that's why she is feeling down!" The first years gasped all together, they had completely forgotten! With their pureblood parents, most had to not grieve nor celebrate the death of you-know-who. They simply forgot what even happened on this day because they were taught to forget.
"Okay let's go," She separated from Mr. Feose and went after Merry.
"That was nice of him, wasn't it Harriet?" Merry giggled but stopped when she realized Harriet looked sad and confused.
"Eww he is a Gryffindor," Pansy cringed.
"Can... can girls like other girls?"
It was the end of the day and she was trying to rush out of school so she didn't have to deal with the other kids. She quickly walked onto the school courtyard and trying to calm down. Dudley and Piers probably weren't going to do anything anyways.
"Well yes but the guardian has to be here to give a drop of blood," He said while fixing his papers.
Next chapter Hogwarts Express!
"I guess you are and I hope you will continue to be surprising," They took off after his last words.
"Yeah he just needs to not get into trouble," He smiled back while still blushing.
"You did so well!" Daisy yelled.
Merry sighed as she slipped into her pajama shorts, "Felix Rosier. He used to be with us every Christmas but as soon as he left Hogwarts, he was always with his parents. His parents are... horrid people. That's why most of the older kids absolutely hate him, they feel as though he betrayed them."
"So who is all coming?" Harriet asked.
"It's not dead, just knocked out!" Harriet explained. She quickly thought of a place for the troll to go, in troglodytarum agri which is a cave where most trolls live. She shouted a travel spell and the name of the cave, the troll will arrive unharmed and should wake up in 20 minutes. The troll disappeared with a loud pop.
As they were playing and laughing while the bright, clean snow fell onto the field, someone smiled at the sight from the dark, isolated forest. The person watched the children play around, their eyes mostly focused on the smallest one with the scar. They whispered a curse so she would fall from the great height and hopefully die painfully. The curse didn't seem to stick on her, she was laughing with the Malfoy because snow hit him in the face. The person grumbled and tried again louder, nothing. Again, louder, again, nothing. She laughed again, happy. She was never meant to be happy, ever. Nor was she supposed to be in Slytherin, it was supposed to be Gryffindor like her parents. The person cursed softly, the plan was failing. It always has, no one knows why. The person quietly left to go inform his failure. Hopefully, the Crucio won't be as long this time.
"They are your guardians."
"I got knock outed by a bulger and was unconscious for 2 weeks," He said with a blank face.
"That subject is also very helpful," Hermione agreed.
"Really? Not even like a family party with boring grownups? My family has them a lot," Merry said.
"What's wrong?" He walked up to her with a soft voice. He rested a hand on her shoulder, Harriet made a wounded noise. "What happened?" He asked a bit louder, wanting to know why she was crying.
She is magic.
"How old is he anyway?" Pansy scoffed as they entered the Great Hall.
"People have keys to my volts?" She emphasized the word my.
"This is your washroom and this is your dorm," She opened the dorm to the left of her. "Breakfast starts at 7'o clock on the weekday and 7:30 on the weekend. Classes start at 9'o clock and as Snape said your schedules will be handed out tomorrow at breakfast. Don't worry if Snape seemed a little... well you know, he cares deeply about his students even though he doesn't seem like he does. We all do care about each other, other houses really don't like Slytherin so we have to stay together. I really do hope you find this place like a home, it may take a while but it will come soon. I hope you sleep well and make this your home for the next 7 years," She smiled at the girls. Harry decided that she really liked her. With that she left, leaving the girls to pick what bed was theirs. Harry chose the bed in between Merry's and Millicent's. She sat on her bed, it was so elegant. The blanket was a very thick, emerald green quilt and the sheets were emerald green silk. There were three pillows on her bed and there were silver curtains made of a thick material. There was a snake carving above head of the bed that had emerald eyes and a silver body. She really liked it here, it was cold and comforting. There also was a roaring fireplace near Daphne's bed and Tracey's. There were desks next to every other bed and there was at least one nightstand for each bed.

"Really now?" Harry whined. Merry just smirked and started to work on her face. She put on some blush and concealer under Harry's eyes. Merry put on mascara and eyeliner next which made Harry move around and giggle a lot. She put lip liner, lipstick, and gloss only on the middle of Harry's lips. She also filled in her eyebrows a bit.
"So put me on! Don't be afraid!
"The Ministry doesn't want the people to freak out," Mr. Feose explained.
"So do you know when the first game is?" Pansy asked from overhearing their conversation.
"Harriet do you want to go to supper tonight?"
"Yep," Harriet popped the p and turned back to her notes. She pulled out her book and turned to the first page. The pages were filled to the brim with annotations and little fun facts. Also, there were a few little doodles which always made Harriet smile. Mr. Feose would doodle in her book when she was trying to study.
"Are you going to Malfoy's party?" Harriet asked.
"Shut up freak!" He punched her in the stomach hard to make her collapse in pain. She barely could breathe as Piers spat on her and they left laughing 'witch'.
"We shall take you up to your dorms now, girls to the right and boys to the left," Gemma motioned the girls to follow. Harry again ended up in the back. They walked up quite a bit until Gemma stopped by two doors across from each other.

"What?"
"Well Malfoy I don't care if they think I'm weak or not. Plus this is none of your business and you can't do anything about it so-" Harriet cut off by Merry.
"Yeah."
"Where is that Riley person you were talking about?" She asked while trying to keep tears from falling.
"Hush," Harry giggled and blushed a bit. They sat by the other Slytherins who were all sitting up in the front, all because they were not afraid of Snape. Neville once again looked quite scared so she waved to him which made him smile and wave back excitedly. The bell quickly rang which made Harry quite scared, what if she hated this class. She loved potions but what if her favorite class turned out to be a big flop. As the bell rang, Snape entered very dramatically which made Harriet snort. She is going to have a really hard time not making fun of him for being so dramatic. Before he started taking attendance, he looked over them dramatically which made all of the students look away, except Harriet. Harriet stared at him directly and smiled. He scoffed at her and swept away and started to take attendance.
"You really are clumsy, aren't you?" She laughed.
"I brought something!" Merry sang as she cracked open the door to see Harriet still curled up in bed with one eye open.
"This is going to take a long time," Harry sighed.
"Yeah," Harriet said quietly on her bed, her stomach was turning so much. She never had a Christmas before, the Dursley's always went all out for Christmas. Dudley always got dozens of presents. Her Aunt always made her cook everything, and when neighbors stopped by to compliment her food, her Aunt would always take the credit. Her Uncle would always have this huge party at work, which she had to cook everything for. But at least the people there liked her food, she always tends to feel like everything she ever does is utter crap.
"Up," She whispered quietly with her arm out. The broom immediately slammed into her hand with a loud audible smack. Merry burst out laughing at the face Harriet made at the loud smack.
"Well it's now or never," Harry said with a shaking voice. She grabbed some floo powder which was in a little pot on the floor. She stepped in the fireplace and closed the gates from the inside.
"We have to go get our wands, a pet, and books of course," Harry said while playing with her new phone, she never has even seen one. She jumped as her phone made a noise which made Merry laugh.
Harriet walked carefully down the stairs, not wanting to fall, she stared up at the huge Christmas tree that was lit up with twinkling lights and moving ornaments. Harriet wished She walked around a bit until she found what seemed to be the living room, Harriet stared at Draco's mother who was reading a book calmly by the fire. Narcissa sensed someone near so she looked up to see Harriet with curious, big eyes and in her oversized clothes.
"Feel better Harriet, I will write a note explaining your absences so you won't get into trouble. If you need something, don't be hesitant on asking. I'm always here to answer questions and help others," He patted her head and let himself out after saying goodbye to everyone.
Harriet was confused when she opened up the door and looked down the hallways. No one was around and it was deadly quiet, no one running around or stomping. No screaming or shouting, no pans being smacked against the walls. She aimlessly walked down the halls in her pajamas, she assumed she was heading in the right direction when she saw the large staircase, the same staircase that they were running on the previous night. Harriet really liked it here at the Malfoy's, it was so calm and nice. Draco and Merry were nice to her like always but it was super fun so far since they were bonding as friends. Draco isn't as annoying as Blaise teases him for, he actually is quite caring.
Harriet nodded softly, "Yes please. If it's not too much to ask for."
"No problem, are you sure your alright?" She asked.
~ Spooky scary skeletons ~
(See the end of the chapter for
"So?" Her harshness boomed in Harriet's ears, she didn't care.
"Yes?" Her voice was high and tight.
"What do you need?" She sneered at her.
"Be nice," Harriet pouted.
"I have a hard time remembering stuff like directions, plus this place holds so many secrets. I really want to know all of them," Harry explained.
"Yeah, I got him before first year. I named him after some name I read in a book once," He shrugged and sat next to her. Her heart started to beat faster and she just keep petting his cat. Marcus and Harriet kept talking for most of the remainder of the night, most of his replies were grunts or nods but she didn't mind, she could tell he was engaged in the conversation by his eyes never leaving hers. Merry had her hand on her mouth, trying to stiffle some laughs while watching Harriet stumble on her words and gesture her hands more than usual just from talking to Marcus. Blaise and Pansy were teasing Draco for pouting most of the night because Harriet was talking to Flint all night and not him. Vincent and Geogory were eating and talking to each other over by the older students.
"Oh course what are friends for?" She giggled while Malfoy pouted and crossed his arms.
"Pansy Parkison," A girl with a cropped haircut and a upturned nose introduced herself.
"Want to sit?" He asked and gestured to the sit to his right almost knocking down his ink.
"Oh and this is Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle," Malfoy introduced them because they were too busy eating. But they looked up and waved at her when they heard their names. She smiled and waved back. They finished eating until they had to sing the Hogwarts song. The older years and other Professors looked really sick and strained.
"No!" Merry shouted which gained the attention of others. She apologized and why everyone got back to what they were doing, she turned to her friends and leaned in.
Two twin redheads at the Gryffindor table finished the song while a death march tune. Harry and Merry were both crying with laughter at the lyrics. After that Headmaster Dumbledore dismissed the first years so their head of houses and Prefects could introduce themselves and go over rules.
"Thank you, Cara," Harry smiled.
"Just make yourself at home Harriet," Narcissa smiled kindly at the young children.
I know that they are young but young kids have crushes so whatever :p Plus I think with her uncle and aunt always hiding things from her so she has very sudden odd feelings and doesn't know how to express them. I hope you enjoyed and sorry for any typos <3 (Hopefully the quidditch game wasn't that boring :p)
"'M Ron Weasley," The redhead smiled at her. She swore she could hear Draco scoff in the background.
"Draco dear," Draco looked up at his mother, his face still a bit red. "Here," She flicked her wand at Draco's wet clothes. It dried instantly and the pile of snow on his head and shoulders disappeared. She brushed him off lightly and combed his hair gently with her fingers.
"Merry do you want the kitten?"
"I have an idea!"
"Yeah, you're probably right," Harriet smiled slightly and turned to go to class. Merry jogged up to her.
"Oh I was... um... well you see...," Hermione tried to make up an explanation.
Merry popped another sweet into her mouth, "Here let me say names so you are not confused any longer." With that she started naming the people in the room, "Those are the Carrow twins," With that both of their heads shot up, Merry pointed to the one of the left, "That one is Flora, " She then gestered to the one of the right, "That one is Hestia." They both smirked and looked at each other, Merry must have said the opposite name. Harriet noted that the correct Flora seemed to bite her lip more and had a slight cut on her upper ear while the correct Hestia had a lighter brown shade of eyes, it had some golden flecks in it.
"Happy," She sniffled and rubbed her nose.
"I don't know, some boys are weird and gross but others are really nice and smart," Harriet really never thought about it before.
"Someone betrayed them, Peter Pettigrew. He was a deatheater, a follower of Voldemort. He craved power and control. He protected your parents and their secrets but he told Voldemort where they were hiding. Voldemort was Tom Riddle's name after he became insane. Followers that followed him when he was sane were killed but he gained followers when he was insane. He promised them different things like power and respect. Your parents wanted a man named Sirius Black to be their secret keeper but Black said it would be too obvious so Pettigrew became their secret keeper. The official documents that changed your parents' secret keeper were not writing yet so when your parents were murdered Black got the punishment. He is your godfather, he is your guardian. But he is in Azkaban for life due to your parents murders and 13 muggle deaths which Pettigrew is responsible for." Mr. Feose waited for Harry to ask questions because he knew that she would have lots. Harry just stared at the ground with tears rolling down her face. Mr. Feose got up and sat beside her, rubbing her back. He was going to start talking again but she beat him to it.
"When do we get to Hogwarts?" Merry yawned.
"Oh," Is all Harry said.
"Dumbledore wants to see you."
4 hours later after countless clothing and accessories were thrown at her to try on, they were done shopping. Merry's mother had a nice warm smile but tired eyes. She was very skinny and had her light brown hair in a messy bun. Merry was very excited to try things on just like Harry. Harry was really into the dresses she bought, they were mostly to her knees and were really flowy. Merry also made Harry buy a crap ton of makeup which Harry was less excited about because she never had an interest in makeup. Halfway through their shopping, Harry forgot that she hadn't said her name. It made Harry almost to start crying when putting on a robe that complete strangers were being really nice to her. When the three were satisfied with what they got, they went to check out and bought everything. Harry wore out an emerald green dress that went to her knees and black converses. A new lady was at the counter and checked out everything. Merry's mother wanted to buy Harry's clothes but Harry said she had the money. Merry's mother was about to make Merry say goodbye to Harry but Harry suggested lunch after seeing Merry looking really torn. The three went to some shop for sandwiches and ice cream, Merry sat by Harry while her mother sat across from them. Harry really liked Merry and her mother, they were really nice and seemed to really care about her. Merry was ranting on and on about this place and the food. Merry ended up ordering for Harry because Harry trusted Merry's opinions. Merry proved that she had good taste in clothing and makeup so Harry trusted her to have good taste in food. Merry and Harry were bonding the whole time on their journey, talking about celebrities and Quidditch. They had become friends over the few hours spent together.
"You can sit," Narcissa smiled. Harriet sat across from her quietly, trying to take up the least amount of space possible.Harriet sat across from her quietly, trying to take up the least amount of space possible. "How are you, Harriet? Did you sleep well last night?" Harriet tried to calm herself, Narcissa seemed quite nice and her voice was super soft. Harriet wondered if this is how all mothers are, Cara, Merry's mother, is always nice to her also but she is quieter than Narcissa. Narcissa is seeming to put in extra effort for Harriet to be calmed, Cara always knew when Harriet needed her space or quiet time.
"Take Harriet's blanket up to my room," He ordered out. Dobby looked at her scar a bit in confusion, Harriet gently hands it to him. She felt super bad when he held it, it was as big as him.
"I know that- It just blinked!" Merry squealed.
"She may not want us," Vincent interrupted.
"Next wardrobe," She said excitedly. She was going to have clothes that actually belonged to her and weren't hand-me downs. She went into a shop which had lots of witches and dresses in the window. There was both wizarding clothing and Muggle clothing in the store. There was an older, snobbish looking witch at the counter who was on the phone arguing with someone. She had her hair everywhere and her makeup was terrible. The women in the store wore tight clothing to show off their bodies. Harry was about to leave when the lady up front got off the phone.
"Was it what Ron said?" Merry pushed the hair out of her eyes comfortingly. Hermione nodded and some more tears escaped. Merry hugged her tightly and whispered comforting words.
"Yes, you may," She raised an eyebrow in confusion. Merry turned to Harriet.
"Because the chasers could have done more goals, the keeper could have blocked some more, and the beaters could have also hit more bludgers," Patrick explained more in detail.
She heard deep chuckling from above her, "Sorry about that. Achilles likes to cuddle." She looked up to see Marcus, she blushed when she made eye contact with his dark brown eyes.
"But you were so excited for the candy-," Harriet gasped loudly, "We missed confusing people with our costumes!" The group was planning on wearing different house uniforms to confuse students and professors.
"Thanks Draco," She giggled and kissed his cheek lightly which made him blush deeply. "See ya later," She giggled and ran to the Quidditch pitch while Draco continued to blush and touch his cheek while smiling stupidly.
"4th," The one on the left purred and winked at Merry. Merry just giggled and played with the end of her top buttons to make him look at her chest which worked. The handsome male in the middle just kept his eyes on Harry.
"Party?" Harriet turned around confused.
"You won this time Potter." Harriet smirked and took a bit out of her apple. The excitement died down quickly which led to the boys talking about Quidditch. Harry looked around the Great Hall some more and let her eyes stop on another pair of eyes that were staring directly at her. Flint. He looked at her lazily and slightly amused. She stared back with the same expression. She examined his face, his nose looked very broken and he definitely had very crooked teeth. He had cheekbones and a jawline to die for. His eyes were as dark as his hair which was very messy on top. His hair was longer on top but shorter on the sides. He also was very tall and muscular, which she noticed from before. Harriet remembered that he was a pureblood from the book she read. His family was known for being dark and followers of Voldemort. He seemed to be examining her also. Maybe it was a Slytherin thing, examine the unknown before doing anything else. They continued their stare off until Merry nudged her arm slightly.
"Come on, let's go before Malfoy loses his pants," Merry snorted.
"Okay," Harriet sniffed, "I was really looking forward to it also!"
"Merry said that all the kids go into a different room?"
"Stop bragging Draco," She hit his thigh in annoyance.
"I'm Zabini, but you delicious darling can call me Blaise," He winked at her. Merry threw a piece of chicken at him which missed him.
"Longbottom!" Snape growled and stomped towards the trembling boy. Harriet still in the storage room knocked down a fully stocked shelf on propose. The class was silently and Harriet held her breath. Snape stormed into the storage room to see an equally trembling girl whose arm was covered in slime.
------------End of Flashback------------
"Hello!" Yelled an old man as he jumped up from behind the counter. Merry screamed and jumped back while Harry just stared at the man's wild hair. Harry was told about Mr. Ollivander and his ways.
"I'm almost done," She tied her hair and tightened her pony.
"What is the difference between monkshood and wolfsbane?" Snape really was hard to look through, well being in Slytherin for so many years he must know how to hide his emotions well.
"Just promise me that you won't go to the party where the adults are going to be, just stay with me and Draco. I don't want to see what will go down if you meet the wrong person," Merry rubbed her eyes, somehow she got so attached to this precious girl. She would do anything to keep her safe, Harriet has been through so much and she doesn't deserve any more pain.
"No take it, you are so much better than him," Merry gasped, "This is an honor!"
"First years over here, first years over here!" The booming voice ordered. The three girls made their way over to a lake with dozens of small boats and a very large man.
"Yes ma'am," She said while pouting. Aunt Petunia just scoffed at her and shooed her away. Harry thanked her and went out the front door. She looked around the neighborhood and saw that Ms. Figg was not home. She knew that Ms. Figg was a squib, she had a floo in her living room. Harry smirked as she walked over to her house. She walked around to the back and found the back door not locked. This neighborhood was very safe to the point where most people didn't even lock their front door. Harry walked into her house while stepping over some cats at the door. The cats didn't even seem like they cared she came in as she shut the door. She walked slowly to the floo and opened its gates with shaking hands. She turned around to see no cats have moved at all.
"Have you finished all of your chores?" Aunt Petunia sneered.
"I know that, just with your family-"
Sorry, a lot has been going on lately like classes to my birthday, I will try to update this more. Maybe once a week, hopefully. Sorry for any typos! Hope this made your day better <3
"A bit excited are we?" Severus raised an eyebrow at Draco but hugged him none the less. Riley patted his head and looked up to see Harriet hiding near the corner.
"Life will go on, worse things will come along. You will think probably in 10 years this nervousness was nothing," Merry rubbed her back comfortingly.
"Get me a snake," She teased.
"Really?" Harriet laughed, she liked flying it was like for once she could be free. It was like she didn't have to be the girl who lived nor the girl who always has nightmares. She could just be herself. It was the same exact feeling she had when she left the Dursleys and she always wanted to remember that moment.
"You were sleeping," Harry laughed as she packed up everything.
"Yeah?"
"I will," She nodded to him as Draco gushed over the potions in the book. The adults then unwrapped their few presents, Riley got sweaters and sweets while Severus got novels and transfiguration books. Narcissa got a stunning necklace from Lucius which she kissed him for, Cara got a few warm robes also. Lucius received novels along with a glass figurene to add to his collection. The rest of the day resulted in Harriet curling up in her warm blanket while reading a dystopian novel that she got from Cara and Draco trying on his new clothes, he was very excited for how thick they were. Merry played with her jewelry and makeup while eating sweets, they watched muggle movies in Draco's room until nightfall came. Merry was very close to hitting Draco upside the head for how much he kept interrupting the movies with normal logic.
"Well usually everyone in our Slytherin year, Pansy, Blaise, Tracey, you already know the rest. And Flint, Pucey, Warrington, and Montague. Also Farley and Zang, the two Slytherin Prefects. The Carrow twins, Flora and Hestia, they are 3rd years. Sullivan Fawley is a Hufflepuff who is a 2nd year, his parents have quite a powerful position in the Wizarding world. Hannah Abbott and Ernie Macmillan are both Hufflepuffs in our year, both of their parents work for the Ministry." Draco knew so much about families that are purebloods, he looks like he could list off purebloods.
"So which house is the best for me?" Harry asked in her mind.
"Are you packing for a mid-day feast?" Merry joked. Harriet looked down slowly at her collection of food. She frowned, she didn't have to pack up food anymore. She could eat whenever she wanted. She never had to starve and wonder if she would ever be able to eat again. Harry swallowed to lump forming in her throat and quickly shoved the fruit in her bag.
"If you like other girls?" Harriet blushed deeply.
"Here you go," Harry giggled and offered the toad to Neville. He blushed and took his toad slowly. He made a wounded noise when their hands accidentally touched.
"We are 11!" Harriet was so confused, why should they be interested in boys? The girls all laughed.
"Only you, only you," Dean chuckled. She was still quite confused but she shook her head like she was shaking away the confusion. She took her sleeve and started to clean off Seamus's face. Seamus blushed as red as Ron's hair as she cleaned his face off.
"I'm not sure," Harriet looked down and started to fake cry silently. Snape, who has seen his fair share of fake criers, almost immediately could tell that she was faking. But even though he would never admit it, fear that she was actually scared and crying was racing through his body.
"I assume you are Harriet Lillian Potter," He said as a statement. Harry nodded and took a seat when the goblin sat down.
"Sick?" Merry reached over and felt her forehead. "You do feel a bit warm," She said nervously.
One time Harriet was 5 years old and she drew a picture of her family, her Uncle Vernon, her Aunt Tune, and her Cousin Duds. Her Uncle refused to be called anything else and her Aunt always hated when Harriet called her that but she had a hard time forming words. It was the same nickname that the evil little boy used to call her that was friends with Lily. Dudley quite liked his nickname actually, it was different than the stupid nicknames his parents gave him. It was different from his 'friends' at school, it made him something other than a spoiled kid who is violent. When Harriet brought it home, she was so excited to show her Aunt. To show that they were a family, maybe her good artwork would let her eat a bit more for dinner.  She was shaking with excitement, would her Aunt call them a family finally? She ran all of the way home, she wanted to let them know that she cared, she wanted them to be her family.
"What is wrong?" Pansy overheard them which peeked interest in the other girls finishing getting dressed.
"Thank you sir, for taking time out of your busy schedule to tell me what is wrong and what is right," She sassied him lightly while giving off an innocent look despite her words.
"Wolfsbane is more common in potions because of the rubbery texture of the plant absorbs the potion better than monkshood which has a more leathery texture but otherwise they are the same plants," She rambled on.
"I have to agree with Merry, this is a major compliment from Slytherins to just give you the position without having you try out," Daphne nodded.
"What the hell was that?!" Merry shouted. A few students in the hallway turned their head to try and find the problem. Harriet grabbed her by the arm and pulled her towards an abandoned corridor which they found last night.
"Thanks you guys," Harriet laughed and rubbed her itchy eyes.
Her Aunt forcefully opened up the small cupboard under the stairs, Harriet looked at it confused. Was she supposed to clean it? It was quite dirty and full of dust, there were cobwebs everywhere. Her Aunt threw her in the small cupboard casually and carelessly like she was only a simple coat, her head hit the wall and she whimpered at the sudden pain. She sat on the floor and looked up at her Aunt while she was crying.
"Present," She smiled kindly at him. Merry shook with silent laughter and kept her hand over her mouth so she didn't laugh out loud. Snape sneered at her but continued on with attendance. He started to talk about his rules for class which was just him saying to not be an idiot.
"How do you know this?" Everyone seemed to know everything when it came to Riley.
"Damn that really does work," She chuckled. They went to shower and got dressed. Beetlejuice showered with Harry, he slithered in the water by her feet. After they were done, it was just before 7 so they grabbed their school supplies and books. Beetlejuice went along with her under her blouse. Harry grabbed the 7th year potion book that she found in an empty classroom. They sat in the common room, waiting for the rest of the girls. The fireplace was going strong, filling the room with warm heat. They sank down on a fluffy couch while Merry played on her phone and Harry read the potion book. They sat in comfortable silence until a door quietly creaked open. The girls turned around to see a very relaxed looking Snape. Behind him was a shorter man with short curly, light brown hair that was longer on top. He had deep cheekbones but yet a delicate, feminine face. He had large red eyes with very long eyelashes. But not scary red eyes, like fresh cherries, just lightly frosted over with morning frost. He looked very delicate and feminine all over but something about him looked strong. Harry couldn't figure out what though.
"Yes you do," Mr. Feose whispered back. His heart was breaking because he knew that she would probably never seen her godfather. He continued to rub her back as she cried softly.
Merry rolled her eyes and cuddled more into Harriet's warm blanket, "I have no idea Malfoy, just shut up."
"Who did you learn from?"
"Excellent idea Draco!" Harriet cheered. Merry snorted at Draco pushing out his chest proudly. The trio walked to class while Harriet was slightly scared. Her scar hurt whenever she looked at the professor that taught the gruesome subject. She got a very weird vibe from him. They walked into class but this time Harriet sat away from the professor as possible.
"It's an eyeshadow palette, I can teach you how to use it. I thought I could finally test you how to do makeup since you always seem so fascinated by how I do it," Merry smiled, Harriet smiled back generously.
"Yeah Viktor Krum, he's the youngest seeker to ever join professionally at 16," She smiled back.
"Anything from the trolley dears?" The woman asked sweetly.
"Now that would have been funny," Merry laughed. "Do we have lunch now?"
Over the years Mr. Feose taught her more and more. She never could get enough. Mr. Feose never took her to the Wizarding World because he didn't have permission from the Ministry. Harry thought that was fine though she was thankful to learn from the books. She knew that she was ready for anything the Wizarding World could throw at her.
"Around 6," Harry sighed.
"To some people but I don't think so," Merry calmed down Harriet who was quite nervous. "I don't think it is wrong, I think that love is love no matter what. Also, gay marriage is allowed here."
"Since my parents were murdered," Dumbledore flinched at that part, it seems that he hasn't gotten over her parents' death. To be honest, she doesn't think she has even gotten over it. "So?"
"It really is, most adults barely understand and yet they are the ones making the laws and in charge."
Harry goes to Diagon Alley.
"I-" Harriet started off but Merry interrupted.
"What?" She looked up at him, he looked away quickly and coughed.
"Yeah," Harriet rested her jaw on her fist lazily.
"Yes, it will be!" Merry stuck out her tongue at him. Narcissa had her face in her hands while chuckling and Lucius was shaking his hand while covering his smile with his hand.
"You know..." Merry started off which gains Harriet's attention.
Harriet couldn't move for a week when she looked through some of her Uncle's papers, but she was only 7 years old. She was curious, her eyes always had to look at everything. Examine everything around her, her eyes sparkled with wonder and amusement at even the simplest things like ducks walking around the park or when the toast popped up. Petunia noticed as time went on, Harriet's eyes started to fill with fear. Her eyes would look up briefly as they wanted to see the world and explore but the fear of being hit scared her so she stopped looking at the world with such big round eyes. Eyes just like her mother, so vibrantly green. But... at times, there are sparks of mischief, mischief never was in the eyes of Lily. Lily's eyes also never had fear in them nor as much curiosity in them, but every time she saw Harriet eager to read a book, to dream and wish that magic existed, she only could think of Lily. Lily, her sister who always got all the attention and love. Her special sister, the important sister. She ruined her life. She was neglected because of those big green curious eyes, those same green eyes on the little freak only made Petunia suffer even more.
"Well I am going to Hogwarts too," Millicent snorted.
As the weeks went on, Harriet was introduced to more classes like Astronomy and Herbology. Out of all of her classes, both of them used muggle technology the most. Both classes had a webpage where they put each lesson on it so the students could explore the study more. Astronomy seemed a bit boring to Harriet in the beginning but as the weeks went on she started to enjoy it. Astronomy was a night but she was a night owl anyway so she didn't mind. Although Merry was always ready to fall asleep on her at any moment during the class. At first, she didn't really understand why they had to take the class but she found out the importance of the class like how learning the where the stars are can help navigate you. Herbology was the same thing for her, the class seemed a bit bored in the beginning but she soon figured out the importance of the class. It was useful to identify all of the different plants so in her professor's words 'They didn't die in a slow and painful death'. Harriet was acing all of her classes and was impressing her professors and peers with her advance knowledge. Apparently, the professors thought she was going to be like her father who was quite bad at the courses. But Mr. Feose told her, after she mentioned it to him in a text, that her father just simply didn't do the work but he was quite clever.
"I still have to send a letter to Hogwarts," Harry looked around, trying to find an owlery.
"I really don't know!" Harriet cried out, tears rolled down her face. She was a freak even here, the Dursley's were right, she was a true freak.
"10 points to Slytherin for being the first one with the broom in their... hand," She trailed off seeing the broom on the ground.
Bring back what we’ve forgot,
"No, I really don't ask things about my heritage to her," Merry shifted uncomfortably. Harriet backed off seeing how Merry reacted.
"There," She smiled.
"Why?" Harry whispered.
"Ah, Harriet Potter and Merry Baxter... I remember your parents' wands, I remember every wand I have ever sold and made," He leaned over the counter making both of the girls step back.
"I'm Cedric Diggory," The middle one said and blushed at Harry's stare.
"Lemon drop?" He offered kindly.
"Thank god we aren't paired with the Gryffindorks," Malfoy sighed dramatically.
Merry pointed to the two kids playing chess, "That is Ernie Macmillian, he is a Hufflepuff in our year." The blond boy looked up curiously when he heard his name, he smiled when they made eye contant and he waved shyly at her with a rising blush on his face. She giggled lightly and waved back. "And Hannah Abbott who is also a Hufflepuff in our year." The blonde girl smiled and shortly waved at her, Harriet waved back kindly. Merry introduced everyone else, most people would look up at her and smile at least. There were two random older Ravenclaw girls because their parents dragged them along and one Ravenclaw boy who was a 7th year whose father has high political power in the Ministry. There were also a few Gryffindor's but there were all older like in their 6th or 7th years. No one didn't even look at scar, not even once. The two Slytherin prefects were there, they talked to Harriet the most out of everyone there. Gemma, the girl Prefect, seemed so relaxed while Jason, the boy Prefect, kept chuckling and seemed so amused about the topics Harriet talked about. She felt a brush of fur on her hand which made her jump a bit.
"The Dursleys?"
"Neither do I," Merry laughed and also swung her leg over her broom. Harriet jumped and crossed her legs around the broom trying to hold on. She stayed in the air and kicking her legs back and forth happily.
"HOLY SHIT!" Merry shouted and took off to get closer to her, "That's better than any seeker I have ever seen! You are a natural at this!"
"Careful Ron here is obsessed with him," The other boy next to them asked.
"I think he still cares for them though," Harriet spoke up, before the others could object she continued, "Think about it, he warned everyone that the party was ending. If he didn't, wouldn't everyone have gotten in a lot of trouble?" Both Merry and Draco were quiet, they stared nowhere in thought.
"I-I have family left," she whimpered out, shaking in her seat.
"Yeah I will adopt the kitten," Merry said.
"I can't wait to see what Christmas will be like with you in the house," Merry giggled which made Harriet snort.
"Wait," One ordered. Harry snapped her head up to look into his eyes. There were four Slytherin boys, all towering over her and Merry.
Their daring, nerve, and chivalry
The two girls made their way out of the dungeons while their school cloaks and wands. Harry also took Beetlejuice along so he could see his home for the next 7 years.
"No problem, now I better get going if I were you," He chuckled, "And don't worry I will clean up this mess." The two girls slipped out into the corridors, avoiding professors and other head students looking for the now gone troll or troublesome students.
There's nothing hidden in your head
"Bad day?" He asked which Harry replied with a snort.
--------------------------
"Four to a boat!" The large man ordered. The girls all stepped into the boat trying not to tip it over. Harry almost fell into the water laughing because Merry was trying to clean off the seat of the boat.
"Yeah, a summary of the first chapter," Harry explained.
"What are you two doing up this early?" He sneered at them.
Draco walked into the room, "What are you two talking about? How stupid Rosier is?" He grumbled as he fluffed the pillows again.
Let the greatest power of power rain, may it save us all.'
"The Draught of the Living Death," She smirked.
"I'm fine, I just have a question," She blushed.
"I don't know any spells that could take down a troll!"
"Seriously, are you good?"
"Well, we have hundreds of other books that you may be interested in," The lady giggled.
"Well we aren't getting any younger," She giggled then sprinted up some stairs. Harry laughed and ran up to catch her. They laughed together as they ran through stairs and corridors. Stopping at every classroom to see what they may hold. Many held abandon books which Harry took one of each and other random school supplies. Soon they were on the 8th floor, they figured out where all of their classes would be held and even future ones. They left the library for tomorrow during the school time and the 3rd floor for a later time. It was already 6 in the morning, so they had to run back to not get caught. Luckily no one came across the two girls the whole night but at one point they thought they heard Cedric's voice.
"You also are the top bank owner, you have the most money in the Wizarding World with your combined bank accounts," The goblin explained.
"How did you know that?" Merry whispered harshly.
"She doesn't feel good," Merry nodded sadly. The guys all cooed and groaned in pity and sadness. The older students overheard and started to ask questions.
"What?" Harry said startled.
"Come on, come on, I want to get to the party," Mark winked at Marcus who glared at him.
"Let's go sit down for a moment," Merry's mother said. Merry's mother had trunks for both of them and multiple other supplies like potion kits and even a broom for both of them.
"Harriet Potter," She liked the fact that he didn't look at her scar or say 'I know that'. She liked this weird Irish wizard.
He sighed and shifted some parchment papers around, "I am concerned about your holidays?"
"I feel like you could really knock together some heads and help the Wizarding World," He chuckled.
"Because that would mean ruining my makeup and hair which you did," She emphasized the word you. Merry's face flashed with realization and slowly lowered the spoon down.
"Yeah, that will probably be for the best," Millicent agreed.
"They will be fine Cara," Mr. Feose patted her back. Both kids waved at them for the last time and disappeared into the train. They talked about their summers as they went to find an empty compartment. They bumped into some older kids, Harry collided her head into one of their lower chests.
"We don't want to get her even more upset," Gregory added on.
Harriet woke up to the sun shining into her room, she stretched and was confused when her hands and feet didn't hit the walls of her cupboard. She opened her eyes timidly, she was alone in a large room. She sat up and looked around, oh it's a Draco's room. She wondered why she woke up, it seemed so early. She flicked her wand and the time glowed in the air, it was 7:12 am. Even though she is used to waking up early but she is getting better about sleeping in a bit so she doesn't wake up the other girls. No one was in the room with her but she was sleeping in his bed, the three of them must have crashed after their little quidditch match. She caught the snitch first before Draco or Merry even saw it. But for an odd reason, her scar has been burning lately, more than usual. She really wants to tell someone like Merry or Riley about the pain but she doesn't want to be selfish nor a bother.
"Well that's why I'm here to make sure it's not serious and how I can help you feel better," He smiled at her. He tapped her forehead with his elegant wand.
Harriet Lillian Potter is that person.
When he got to her name, he sneered, "Our newest celebrity, Harriet Potter."
"Done!" Merry shouted. Harry sighed and moved while stretching her muscles.
"Okay," She whispered and looked down, still upset that he might be blamed for her mistake.
"It is supposed to show your power in numbers most people are in the 1000's but the highest is 2000. Your power can't be put into those numbers," The goblin explained.
"I don't trust myself enough for that," Harriet sighed and swung her leg over the broom.
"Oh no," Harry moaned while closing the cap.
"Dudley and Piers," Was all she said. He slid a bowl filled with cookies over to her and left. She almost finished a whole cookie before he returned with a vial.
"That couldn't have happened!" Harry laughed. She really did like Merry, she calmed her and made her laugh. She could tell they were becoming quite close.
"Do you want to go?"
"Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts,
"You- you- wait what?" He frowned.
"Freak", Her Aunt called from the kitchen. Harry quickly folded and put the letter in her back pocket. She gave the rest of the mail to her Uncle who just scoffed at her. Aunt Petunia knew that her letter would be coming and was trying to prevent her from going. But oh was she wrong, Harry was going to Hogwarts no matter what.
Harriet cuddled more into Merry tired, this was a very long day for her. So many emotions and excitement in one day, "Draco just let them believe in what they believe," Merry sighed.
"Smith is the hottest," Merry shouted.
"Hi," He said a bit scared at first but smiled at the end.
Sorry for any typos, comments and kudos are appreciated! Hopefully, everything made sense!
"I am alright dear, don't worry," He reassured him. She sat back down in her seat as he continued the lesson. He explained that we were going to lift a feather. Sounds easy enough. The class was chanting the phrase and waving their wands awkwardly.
Where those of wit and learning,
----------------------------------------
"Let's go," Harry said. The three girls made their way outside when they heard a booming voice.
Those patient Hufflepuffs are true
"No Cedric we didn't!" Merry answered sarcastically. There was a scream from the bathroom, shit. Harriet ran into the bathroom.
"Hello Hermione, can I call you that?" Hermione nodded. "What do you think your favorite class is going to be?" Harriet asked trying to make conversation.
"Wingardium Leviosa," Seamus said. Boom!
"No don't worry its fine, let's go," He tapped the weird stone griffin with his wand a few times and whispered 'Lemon drops'. Well for Flint, it wasn't really whispering, it was more like low, deep talking. He walked her up, she tried not to blush with him in front of her. He knocked on a door, the door opened by itself. They walked in, with Flint in front and Harriet hiding behind him. The office was very bog and filled with knick-knacks which Harriet may or may not wanted to play with. There was a bird off to the side by a big wooden desk, she walked towards it to get a closer look at it.
"Why is there a cat?" Merry whispered.
"Why what happened?" Merry walked up to the door, wanting answers.
"Honey I could be a lot ruder, trust me," Merry chuckled which earned her a light slap on the head from Harriet.
"Why did you get so much?" Snickered Harry.
"So how was it?" Merry asked while laying on her bed.
"Can you list off all of the families in the Sacred Twenty Eight?" Harriet was scared and curious about his answer.
"I missed you too!" She shouted back. They hugged until the train whistled.
"You like the Bulgarian Quidditch team?" She asked after she saw his bracelet.
"How are you girly?" He laughs.
Narcissa chuckled to herself a bit, "No not really, I always find it difficult to fall asleep the night before Christmas. Both Lucius and Draco could always fall asleep instantly, that's why Draco and my husband are always awake at the crack of dawn on Christmas."
"Thank you, Professor Woods," Neville said politely.
Crave her love.
"Well, how?"
Your top hats sleek and tall,
"I'm not," Harry pouted.
"I understand why you did this, it was for a good cause. And you also saved a life in the process, amazing job students. 20 points to Slytherin for teamwork and the extreme knowledge needed, 10 for Hufflepuff for guidance and helping those in need, and 10 for Gryffindor for informing me and being able to admit that you need help," Riley smiled. The students smiled at each other, proud of themselves.
"You really did?" Another boy asked very amusedly.
"Yes," Draco seemed to choke back an insult, most likely not to get Harriet mad, "The youngest ones are 8 years old and 7 years old so they never come to any parties yet. And the last one I believe is Slughorn, which the youngest is older than Snape so his bloodline runs through other Purebloods so the name still have purity." Draco sighed at how much he talked.
Sorry for the basically 4 month disappearance, a lot of horrid things happened in life and I was not motivated at all to do anything for a really long time, especially to write for this because I was so overwhelmed by this story. This took a long time to write and I wanted to focus on where this story can go and I realized I set it up so wrong, it wasn't how I wanted it, it's all fixed now and I have a really good idea on how first year and second year will go and I believe it's quite good. So hopefully you guys will enjoy how I'm going to progress this fanfic and its overall content :)
First Quidditch game and some crushes appear
"Yeah, it can get a bit boring by all of the parents talking about businesses and other pureblood tasks."
"I will be fine, don't worry."
"Please sit Ms. Potter, Mr. Flint you may leave now. Thank you for directing her to my office." Flint remained motionless, he seemed to have hidden anger but refused to show it on his face. He left without a word after staring at the professor for a while with a blank expression. She sat down in a really cushiony chair that she could sink into. Dumbledore also sat down in a bright orange chair that was also cushiony, the chair made a weird noise which made him pet the arm lightly. Harriet giggled, this man is very silly. He smiled and offered her a little dish filled with candies.
"No he's not, he is just making conversation," Harry frowned. Merry laughed and shook her head. Harry continued to frown, why would he even want to impress her? The bell rang which made the cat snarl lightly because there obviously was some students missing. Words appeared on the chalkboard, 'Read the first chapter and take notes on the most important key points.' Everyone opened their book and started to read silently. Harriet took out her already pre-made notes on the chapter and sat quietly. She avoided looking at the Professor knowing she was looking at her questioningly. Merry was reading it quietly to herself trying to figure out what she was reading. She was frowning and looking severely lost. Harriet stole her parchment paper and wrote a few notes that would help her understand the chapter. When Merry got the parchment back, she read it and nodded. She mouthed the words thank you to Harry which she just mouthed back no problem. As the rest of the class was reading the chapter, some kids came through the door, 8 minutes late.
"You really know your animals huh?" She giggled. The woman unlocked the cage. When the cage unlocked the kitten immediately jumped out of her cage and started to lick Merry everywhere on her face. Merry giggled and tried to tame the young kitten.
"Sorry that I'm late," She panted as she came up to Flint.
"Well, maybe I should just talk to him before we meet up so he doesn't think that I hate him," Harriet shifted and popped a normal muggle jellybean in her mouth. She made a face, she forgot she hated jellybeans.
"Well what is going to happen to the troll when they find it, they aren't violent," Harriet spoke up concerned.
"Maybe it's how I grew up," Harriet always loved to question everything. But maybe that led to her trust issues, she questions news to people. Nothing in her mind was unbiased or non-corrupt, the world was terribly corrupt just like her life at the Dursleys.
"Knowing how to survive in the real world is important," Was all he said.
"Are you going to do anything?" Merry scoffed.
"You weren't supposed to fall off your broom!" Merry laughed.
"They are delicious," Daphne licked her lips while Harriet wondered how people can be delicious, can't only food be delicious? Well, of course, there is cannibalism. Is there cannibalism in the Wizarding world?
"Food?" She raised her head in hope.
"Eat a bit before we leave, you need your strength," Pucey gestured to some fruit and bread. "You are more than ready for this, you will be fine." He patted her head softly. The group ate and talked, Harriet felt really welcomed here. They all treated her like a little sister which made her chest warm up. Was this the same feeling when she thought Flint was kind of cute? If it was, does she like Flint? In what way does she like him? She doesn't have time to work this out, she has a game to win.
"Slytherin because you would gain the most. You could learn, make friends, still be brave, value your own values, change minds and conquer whatever is in your way. Slytherin will help you on your way to victory, to conquering everything and anything, learning so much that people fear you. You will do excellent in Slytherin," The hat moved a little on her head ready to yell out her house. Even though he basically told her what house she was going to be in, she was still scared. Merry was her first friend, she wanted to be in the same house as her. "Slytherin!" The whole hall was dead silent, she was going to puke. Professor McGonagall took the hat off and silently congratulated her with a slight smile. Harry smiled back and thanked her. The whole hall was still kind of stunned but the Slytherin table burst out in cheers and clapped. Harry jumped off the stool and quickly walked to Merry who looked so proud of her. Merry saved a seat for her which was right next to her. Harry smiled as she saw her own robes turn into Slytherin colors. She knew she made the right choice. They hugged and laughed as Harry dramatically sighed.
"Yeah but I'm a bit nervous," She said honestly.
"Nah he was doing more than undressing if you ask me," Liam snickered. Cedric's jaw dropped while blushing. He quickly ran away from them. Both girls giggled and blushed from hearing their conversations.
"Well, I'm honored to escort you to your first ever party!" Merry giggled while looping their arms together. They skipped to catch up to the other first years. The party was not too loud nor not too boring. The first years sat together, drinking juice and playing games like exploding snap. The upperclassmen drank actually alcohol and talked about more adult matters like gossip. Harriet really likes this balance of fun and calming safety, she wanted to win more just to have this happen again. Off in the corner, Marcus and Derek were looking over at Harriet giggling and wiping away the dust on her nose.
"Yeah, do you have everything?" Merry got up, rubbing her itchy eyes after crying.
"Wolfsbane is more common in potions because of the rubbery texture of the plant absorbs the potion better than monkshood which has a more leathery texture but otherwise they are the same plants, just different names," She rambled on. Snape seemed impressed by her advanced answer.
"Well, Merry can text her," Millicent offered.
"What if I do bad?" Harriet whispered nervously.
"We are waiting for our friends, sir," Harry said politely. He continued to sneer at her while the more kind man smiled at them. He placed his hand on Snape's lower back which made his sneer disappear.
"Bloodworth School of Witchcraft and Wizardry."
"Potty!" Crap. Dudley and his gang. She walked faster and ignored their taunting calls. "Potty!" They started to run fast towards her so she started to run also.
"That's amazing! I wish I could have known more in detail of the Wizarding world," She sighed lightly, "I just learned from books so it was really confusing."
"And sometimes use it as blackmail," Pansy smirked and Daphne threw a pillow at her head which hit her in the face.
"Seriously, I heard someone died in this class while listening to him talk about the Goblin Wars for hours," Merry said exaggerated.
"Oh you may not think I'm pretty,
"Sit still!"
"Would you like to see your bank information?" The goblin pulls out another piece of parchment. He showed the parchment to her after she nodded.
"I like learning and I have never read these books before!" Harry said excitedly.
"What do you mean?" Harry gasped stunned.
------------------------------------
"More than less, yes dear," His eyes no longer were twinkling and his face looked older now.
"Holy mother of ducks," Harry swore. She could not believe what she just read.
"Okay come on, we need to get you to the Great Hall," Merry grabbed her bag and walked towards the door.
"The day we celebrate the slaughter of witches," Pansy hissed in disgust. Hogwarts once didn't celebrate Halloween because back in the 80's or so, a Ravenclaw brought up that Halloween was once a day where Muggles killed and made fun of witches. But a Hufflepuff boy did not get the memo and still dressed up, which everyone once had to. And that ended the whole debate, so now Hogwarts still celebrates but people can choose to not celebrate.
"So Harriet," Daisy flew up to her, "Excited about the game tomorrow?"
"So he just made you the new seeker?" Merry could not believe it. The girls were all laying in their beds talking about Harriet's new position.
"You are very welcome, I hope you use the knowledge from the books usefully," He drawled out as he looked at her calculatingly.
"I studied for 7 years how to make a perfect potion every time. I know how to brew almost every potion known to the wizarding world. You can have this book back anyways, I know how to brew everything in it," She got up and handed the book to him. Severus is never the one to show emotion but she completely surprised him. Potter's daughter knew and actually liked to brew potions?! Impossible! He was about to bark at her about where she got the book but Riley spoke first.
"Especially Malfoy," Merry snickered. Harriet doesn't really understand what is exactly happening, the girls mention Malfoy and her in one sentence then giggle. Is it some kind of inside joke? Her stomach fell, were they making fun of her behind her back?
"I think I can do this," Harriet puffed out her chest confidently, she never feels this feeling very often. She feels it when Mr. Feose told her that she did well on her potion. Now she feels this feeling even before she had done the task. Merry patted her back and walked her over to the others.
Harriet rubbed her eyes more, "You always know what to say," She sniffed.
"Hi Draco," She chuckled softly.
"Draco, why don't you go show her your room?" Lucius smiled.
"Really?" She looked at Merry who nodded and Cedric who also nodded, "Thanks," She smiled shyly.
"It is not just a toad, it's a toad eye!" Merry looked at the opened jar of toad eyes like it was about to kill her.
Harry (Harriet) Potter
"You don't know that! What if they hate me and refuse for me to be friends with Draco? What if they kick me out of Slytherin because I'm weird to them? What if they kick me out of Hogwarts because they don't see me worthy to even be a witch? What if-?!" Harriet rambled on in fear.
"Exploring."
"Who are you?" Merry asked.
Harriet opened the door, realizing she still didn't have pants on. It was Gemma, the Head girl, "Hello Harriet, are all the first year girls in there?" She asked rushed.
"You should try joining next year!"
Extra little chapter about Halloween before Harriet went to Hogwarts
"No, thank you, Mistress Harriet," He squeaked out. She pouted a bit, she wanted to tell him that he didn't have to call her Mistress. She doesn't need to be above him, she just wants to be his friend.
"Dumbledore," She sniffed, now she knew why the others were so distant towards the older man, he doesn't seem like someone you want to trust. Harriet held out her arms, she really has a hard time hugging people but she trust Malfoy, he is really nice to her and always talks to her. He never treats her different due to her being a half-blood. He smiled and hugged her tightly.
(See the end of the chapter for
(See the end of the chapter for
"You won't even have done it," Harriet challenged.
"What is wrong with this school?" Merry whispered in her ear. Harriet bit her fist while trying to not laugh. The teacher, Mr. Binns, had a very monotone voice and seemed like he was completely uninterested by the topic. Hermione was quickly scribbling down notes which made her receive multiple glares from the other Gryffindors. Neville looked downright confused and completely lost. Merry was sleeping on her desk when the class was only 10 minutes in. Harriet followed along in the prepared notes and annotated chapter. The class seemed to fly by for Harriet, Merry almost fell off her desk when the bell blasted loudly.
"What?" Merry rubbed her eyes and yawned.
"Malfoy Manor!" Merry shouted and threw down the floo powder, green flames engulf them with ash flying everywhere. Harriet opened her eyes and coughed not only from the ash but also Beetlejuice tightly wrapped around her torso in fear. She rubbed him a bit under her sweatshirt to try and calm him, he hissed and nudged her hand in shock of the instant travel.
"Come in," Harriet shouted and continued to lay on her stomach while finishing up a page.
"Mom asked Mr. Feose if he could join us on Christmas," Merry slipped in as she grabbed some last minute things.
~A snake!~ Hissed Autumn ready to pounce. Millicent pet Autumn to calm her. Willow was too busy biting her dragon to notice the snake.
Harry goes to Hogwarts and gets sorted.
"Don't worry, I'm prepared," Merry giggled and cast a spell on the stairs.
"You will get one soon," He teased back. She went to the Dursleys' house later and saw no one home. She didn't have anywhere to put her trunk so she kept it in her pocket. She put on some old clothes so they wouldn't find out where she was. She texted Merry that she was home and that she was going to bed. She took a quick shower and quickly fell asleep smiling for the first time instead of crying.
"Wand?"
"Nothing," Harry blushed and trying to cover the needle with her parchment paper.
"Harriet?" Merry whispered to Harriet. She looked up from her plate filled with fruit.
Harriet woke up to her Aunt screaming and pounding on her cupboards door.
"I'm not sure, they are really nice and pretty but I don't know if I like them."
"Same here," Merry laughed and grabbed her hand. They skipped to a store which was labeled Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. in gold writing. Merry walked in first, dragging Harry behind her. No one was in the room so they let their eyes wander around the shop.
"Yeah, it's on my trunk. The blue box," She pointed to her trunk at the end of her bed. He walked to it and examined the bottles. He nodded in thought again and closed it softly.
"That's fine, just know that I will always accept you and love you no matter what," Merry held her cheek. Harriet sniffed and scrunched up her face, about to cry. "Oh shit, don't cry, you will make me cry then!" Merry laughed and hugged her tightly. Harriet cried into her shoulder, she couldn't believe she had such an amazing and accepting friend, maybe life was repaying her from her terrible past. She was so glad she had Merry in her life. Merry rubbed her back until she stopped crying.
"Purge?" Merry asked.
"I'm not," He made a face at her.
"I am Gemma Farley, Head Girl, and this is Jason Zang, Head Boy," The boy just seemed to growl at the first years. The girl seemed nice enough to Harry. "We will be showing you to your dorms and home for the next 7 years." With that the prefects and Slytherin first years left to go to the dungeons.
"Yeah, of course, read any book you want," He chuckled which made her smile brightly. They sat on the couch, Harriet curled up with the book on potions with her fluffy blanket. Merry sat in an armchair, playing with her hair.
"Hopefully this class will be more entertaining," She sighed as they walked into the classroom.
"How so?" His eyes twinkled with dark amusement.
"Cedric is a head boy, he is supposed to be searching the halls for students," Riley nodded at the ashamed Hufflepuff and raised an eyebrow at the Slytherins.
"Thank you," Harriet hugged her back.
"You're not late," He growled, he didn't seem to be a morning person.
"I will miss you too," He kissed her on her cheek which made her blush deeply. They quickly said goodbye and Mr. Feose and her ate quickly. Harry fed Beetlejuice some potatoes which he loved.
Harriet would always compliment her and smile brightly at her. Merry would always feel more confident after she complimented her. Also Merry would calm her down after her nightmares. They would talk about the nightmare while eating some sweets to calm her down. Merry sighed and walked back to the dining hall for lunch. She walked to her friends and sat down.
"No," She groaned with tears welling up in her eyes.
"I know, I felt it and it wasn't even directed at me!" Merry giggled back. The upper years near them congratulated her and welcomed her to Slytherin. 2 more students went into Gryffindor, Ron Weasley who was the kid with the dirt still on his nose and Dean Thomas. Also, another student got on into Slytherin, Blaise Zabini. He winked at her as he sat down near her. The Headmaster gave a speech which made Harry question his sanity. When he finished his speech, the tables filled with food. Harry gaped at the food and piled her plates with roast beef, potatoes, and green beans. She ate until she couldn't anymore.
Heir of: House of Potter, House of Gryffindor, House of Slytherin, House of Hufflepuff, House of Black, House of Ravenclaw, House of Peverall, House of Prince, House of Woods, House of Riddle
Sorry for any typos, comments and kudos are appreciated!
"Hey it's time to go back in, dinner starts in 15 minutes!" Daphne yelled at the scattered students who were all looking at something different in a field. They all raced each other to the Great Hall laughing.
"May I go take out the trash and shower? Harry asked her Aunt who was out in the garden planting flowers. Aunt Petunia just scowled at her but nodded. Harry went into her trunk which she had to unshrink to get her clothes and grabbed an outfit. She had about an hour to get to Kings Cross. She ran upstairs and ripped off her clothes. She washed and healed her hands with magic because she used chemicals in the kitchen for 4 hours. Her hands did end up bleeding and split open from the chemicals her Aunt insisted on using to clean the kitchen. She showered quickly and got dressed in her new outfit which was a white long sleeved blouse, a teal ribbon that went under her collar, a black skirt that ended at her mid thigh, black knee high socks, and black converses. Merry convinced her to wear this for her first day. They talked all of the time throughout the last month. They found a lot about each other like Merry was deadly afraid of spiders and Harry loves animals. Harry could talk to Merry a lot because she was in her locked cupboard all summer. Harry brushed her teeth and hair. Merry had promised her that she would do her makeup and hair on the train for her. Harry ran downstairs and threw all of her old clothes away, most of them were ripped and dirty anyway. She also threw away all of her broken parts of toys that she got from Dudley or rather got from the trash. She never had real toys, she only got them from Dudley's broken ones that she was never supposed to have in the first place. Harry did her bed for the last time and grabbed her trunk and put it in her pocket. She let Beetlejuice wrap around her arm and grabbed the trash. She looked out back, her Aunt had her back turned and still doing the flowers. Harry smirked and ran out the front door. She threw the trash bag in the can outside and ran to Mr. Feose. She let the wind ruin her hair and let tears fall. She never felt so alive and free. She was finally going to be free, no more beatings or starving. No more crying herself to sleep, no more abuse or neglect. She. was. free. Harry cried her whole way to the shop, she was crying because she was finally truly happy. She was going to go to Hogwarts and be the best witch ever know. She was going to have friends. She was going to learn until her head exploded. She was going to be happy. Harry threw open the doors to Mr. Feose shop.
"You aren't weird, you are the kindest and caring person I have ever met. I know you have insecurities about-"
Harriet looked up to see Narcissa rubbing her eyes tiredly and trying to quiet a yawn, "How did you sleep?"
"That is very kind of you. What are your names?" He responded sweetly.
"With you, now hurry up so they don't get suspicious," Merry sat down behind her waiting for her to go first.
"Wow I'm surprised that you wanted to sit this far back, you usually want to sit by the professors," Merry laughed. Harriet just smiled and pulled out her prepared notes. Draco started to rant about how his father taught him all about this subject. Harriet was polite and nodded along as he talked while Merry glared at him.
"No," Merry whined which made everyone frown in confusion. "Today is the day!"
"And I am pleased to meet a beauty as yourself," He kissed her hand again.
"What were you afraid that a tsunami of toads would come?" Harry giggled, she knew how to control the spell to only make the wanted item to come to her not all of the items that are named what she wished. The other girl just pressed her lips together.
Lily and James Potter,
"Are you excited for your first day of classes?" He smiled.
"Have any of you seen a toad, Neville here lost his," The bushy haired girl said to reveal her bucked teeth.
"Oh my god, Draco is going to piss himself when he finds out!" Pansy giggled.
"Yes!" She squealed again.
"Now put your hand over the broom and say 'up!'" She shouted. The group was a choir of 'up's and maybe a few swear words. Harriet watched everyone before she even looked at her broom, no one had got the broom in their hand yet.
"He already has one," Millicent snorted.
"Like people were disowned, affairs happened, people were murdered," Merry shrugged, "Mother really never explained it too well, something just happened to make us less pure."
"Could I switch my guardians now?"
She waited till he flew even more away from the snitch and made her move. She shot towards the snitch, Gryffindors screamed at their seeker. He took after her, still quite a distance from her. She followed the snitch sharply and always kept her eye on the snitch.
'Don't worry kitten, this human named Merry will take you home," Harry explained to the cat. Merry looked at her confused.
"A lot," Harriet made a wounded noise, "But usually the kids all go into a separate room and play games."
"Well, that's fine because we are already here," Merry giggled at Harriet's blank look.
~No, I don't know if they are edible~ Harriet hissed back quietly. Beetlejuice grumbled, as much as a snake can grumble, and hid back in her blouse. Harriet quickly puts 3 more eyes in as Merry tried not to throw up.
"Stop flirting! Come on!" Merry raced over to grab her broom, Harriet and Draco jumped up to race after her. After grabbing their brooms and equipment, they were on the field with Harriet wearing a bunch of layers since Draco and Merry didn't want her to get cold at all.
"You scared me!" Harry pushed her aside and made their way to their compartment again. They had 5 minutes until they were at Hogwarts. Merry shortened her skirt and Harry's.
"Cause..." Harriet mumbled, she rubbed her eyes. Merry sensed that she didn't want to share but there is definitely a horrid story behind this.
"They seem so lonely down here," Merry whispered almost in tears. Harry nodded wiping away some already fallen tears, she knew best what it was like to be alone. Harry promised that they would come down here to talk to them every single day. Most of the paintings cried out in joy, some left the frame because they were so emotional. One of the paintings was a young girl in yellow robes who looked a bit off. She was Merry's favorite, she had a lisp and was the most excited to see them. Apparently, she was sorted a Hufflepuff but was later sorted into Slytherin because she lost her mind. When she lost her mind, she gained Slytherin qualities and values. There were multiple famous Slytherin witches and wizards, each told them their stories and why they were famous. One witch was famous for killing her husband who was abusive and became at the time the smartest witch of the century. Another witch was famous for saving Merlin from death. A wizard was famous for creating the first wand that would replace the staff. Another wizard was famous for assassinating the Minister who was trying to mind control the wizarding world. Every single painting was of famous Slytherins, there had to be around 3 dozen or more paintings. For some reason this filled Harry with determination, if they could make something of themselves, she could too. Harry's favorite painting was an old wizard with a huge anaconda who speaks Parseltongue like her. He immediately took interest in her along with his snake, Apep. Apep is the meaning of the personification of evil. Apep was abandoned as a young hatchling because he was the last one born and was too weak to carry on. Yvain Bolequaid, the old wizard, took Apep in when he saw him in his own backyard. They apparently were inseparable since that day. Yvain passed away when he was murdered by his father. Yvain was in love with a muggle, a muggle boy. His father was enraged and used the killing curse on him but only after using the cruciatus curse for over an hour. The wizard said that the muggle who he was in love with died a year later. Yvain thinks he took his own life. The way Yvain spoke about his lover in a way that made Harry's heart sink but yet sore in ways she never thought possible. She only could wish that she could have a love so deep like theirs despite the tragic ending. They promised to see them the next day and talk more. Beetlejuice really liked Apep, they quickly became close friends. Much like Harry became really close to Merry. Merry wiped away some tears while Harry rubbed her nose.
"Continuing on have you guys seen the Weasley Twins?" Tracey smirked. The girls all giggled while Harriet looked around confused, is this how normal girls act?
Harriet looks up at Lucius a bit scared, he smiled slightly and nodded his head, "You are always welcome here in our home anytime, hopefully, you will be able to come back this summer."
"Come here wench!" Piers shouted. Harry ran through the school courtyard as they chased after her. She jumped over some seats and then ran through the forest. They started to get closer to her so she started to run until her lungs started to burn and her legs started to shake. Harriet ran through the forest and into the playground near her Aunt and Uncle's house. Dudley and his gang were right behind her and shouting at her.
"Wait!" Draco shouted which made everyone turn to him when Merry started to climb up the girls' stairs. "Us boys can't go up with you or the stairs will collapse." The boys all frowned in sadness and frustration.
"Are you guys talking about Viktor Krum?" A redhead next to them asked.
'Humans, please I want an owner who will give me milk and a ball of yarn,' The kitten meowed. Harry cooed and put her finger in the cage which the kitten licked and nibbled on.

"I need a whole new wardrobe in both Muggle clothing and wizarding clothing," Harry explained while blushing heavily. She really didn't belong here. The older lady was about to snap at her but a girl around her age appeared in front of Harry.
"Pucey go faster!" Flint yelled across the field. Pucey was last year's seeker but now he was a chaser/back up seeker. Harriet watched practice, just interested in how everything worked. Flint usually had separate lessons for her so she could train in private and not be scared. The keeper of the team was the only other girl who was a seventh year, Daisy Weeble. She was really nice to Harriet and treated her like a little sister. The two beaters were 6th years, Mark Helton and Patrick Grube. And the last chaser was Derek Warrington who was a 5th year and was a friend of Marcus.
"That's it!" He screamed and pulled out a piece of parchment.
"What would you get if you add powdered root of asphodel and infusion of wormwood?" Mr. Feose huffed. He was quizzing her for her first year of potions. He was trying to stump her but was failing.
"Thank you," He whispered and hugged his toad to his chest.
"Why were you in here? Didn't you get the message," Harriet frowned in confusion.
"Yeah, she is really excited that you are adopting her."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Harry!" Merry shouted and motioned them to come towards her and her mother. Harry ran to her and jumped into her open arms.
"No but-"
"Well I am glad you enjoy potions, it is a very difficult and useful skill. Not many can brew potions well," He smiled at her.
"Thank god the Professor isn't here yet," The British redhead sighed. The two boys behind him sighed and nodded in agreement. Harriet cringed, as well most of the class did, knowing the Professor was here. The cat jumped off the desk and transformed into their professor mid-jump. All of the boys' faces dropped immediately.
"Did he tell you what he wanted?" She was quite scared.
"I know but we can do next year, I promise," Harriet cuddled into Merry while Draco pouted. They ate candy and crisps that the girls had for dinner and silently watched the movies. The group watched different Halloween movies while avoiding the ones with witches to avoid debate until they started to fall asleep. Everyone was asleep by 6:30 with the room dark except the light from the television and the slight light coming from the window which was a view of the underwater lake. Harriet snuggled into Merry more with her arm around her waist and her head on her shoulder. Merry yawned and opened her eyes and say Harriet snuggling into her. She smirked as an idea popped into her head.
"Yes," She swallowed.
"Want Chinese or pizza?" He grabs the phone.
For some reason, this took me a really long time to write but anyways I hope you enjoyed <3
"Yes."
"Where is your snake?" Merry asked her. Harry eyed both cats again and let Beetlejuice come out of her blouse.
"Put this on your bruise and we will put ice on it after," He explained. She quickly put most of the vial on and rubbed it into her cheekbone. She knows how to put it on, you use 2 fingers and do 3 clockwise rubs than 5 counterclockwise. The most potion that they make is this one, she gets a lot of bruises.
"Are you sure you will be okay?" Merry asked rubbing her arm comfortingly.
"I'm not a pureblood," Harriet frowned.
"Slytherin has a party every time we win, so let's do this!" Mark whooped while Patrick was right behind him, leading the rest of Slytherin to their common room.
"Thank you," She said honestly, she was so stunned that Merry paid attention to how she always looked at the other girls who did some type of makeup so fascinated in wonder. They tore into more presents, Harriet still undoing the wrapping paper gently. Narcissa still taking pictures while the kids tore into their gifts. Draco got mostly books and clothes, Merry got mostly jewelry and sweets. Harriet got some books from Cara, most of them about conspiracies and dragons, and some nice robes from the Malfoys which made her almost tear up, she didn't expect such thoughtful gifts. Draco got her some fancy chocolates which she thanked him for greatly, she loves chocolate sweets the most. She opened up the last present which was from Riley and Severus, she stared at it in wonder. There were a few books about advanced potions, all of them she has never seen before.
A whole month passed and it was the end of June. June passed quickly, Dudley and his friends teased her a lot but she never minded, her Aunt always hit her for no reason, she avoided her Uncle at all costs. After everyone left in the morning, she would clean the house with her magic and spend the rest of her day with Mr. Feose. This became normal to her until one day she got a letter addressed to herself in the mail. It looked old with really nice handwriting in green ink. She flipped it over to see a red seal with some sort of symbol on it.
"Alright, alright," Harriet sighed dramatically and walked over.
Vaults: 9
"Professor?" She said nervously. Riley just smiled and knocked on the door.
"Yeah," Harriet nodded while color soon risen to her cheeks.
"Harriet!" The blond Slytherin in front of her, dressed very elegantly, yelled in excitement. She smiled brightly and waved at him while Merry brushed off any speck of dust or ash off of her body. Cara arrived very shortly behind them, she barely cared about the ash on her, she just smiled at the people in front of her.
"You could just send them an email," Merry explained. Merry showed her how to send an email and to who. Harry sent an email to Dumbledore and McGonagall.
"I will miss you," Harry smiled.
"Of course they do but you hold such a kind nature that I have only seen in very few people," Narcissa clicked her nails on the table next to her in deep thought. Before Harriet could respond, Winky came back with a tray of two cups. Narcissa grabbed one delicately and gently sipped on it before setting it aside. Harriet thanked Winky and sipped mouth fulls of the sweet liquid. She couldn't really have sweets at the Dursleys, therefore, she never cared for the taste but Merry always offers her sweets and Hogwarts never runs out of desserts so she is starting to enjoy the sweetness.
"Well I have no other place to go, I will go to his shop then," Harry sighed and left the school unnoticed.
"He is so innocent though," Pansy ticked her tongue and rolled her eyes.
"Draco is with his father, they went to a store down the road to go grab some last minute supplies for the Christmas party tonight. And Merry was grabbing some snow outside to hit Draco with when they come home." Harriet giggled at her statement. "Would you like to have a cup of hot chocolate with me?"
"One of everything! But 5 treacle tarts," She set them down next to Harriet.
"Mr. Feose said he could come and spend Christmas with us," She fixed her skirt that was riding up. Harriet never realized but Mr. Feose has never talked about his own family before, he may not have any. Maybe that's why he always treated her like his child. She wants to ask him about it, but that seems rude. Maybe one day it will come up.
"Number 27 in 101 odd ways to catch the snitch," Harriet giggled.
"You wasted food! I am not eating here tonight!" Her Aunt came up to her and slapped her on her bruise from Dudley as hard as she could.
"Hello Harriet," Riley smiled at her while Severus separated from Draco and gave her a blank look.
"I think Pewerc is the hottest," Cara added.
"What are your names anyway?" Merry asked the three boys.
"I'm okay, I promise," She whispered and wiped away the newly fallen tears and older that started to dry on her face.
"Never had someone that didn't fit one of my wands," He sighed as he fixed his burnt lamp.
"Potter, Harriet," Called out Professor McGonagall. The whole hall burst out in whispers. The Headmaster sat up as if he couldn't wait to see what house she got in either. Harry took a calming breath and moved her way through the students in front of her. They gasped and gave her room quickly. She felt sick to her stomach when she sat down on the stool facing the whole school. She stared at her clasped hands in her lap until the hat was set onto her head. He covered her eyes completely. He said nothing and when he started to talk she jumped a little bit.
"Oh bullshit, I'll deck him!" Harriet has just a bit of a temper, just a bit which usually ends in her punching someone.
"You look nicer with a shorter skirt," Merry smirked. Harry snorted and put away her other outfit. Beetlejuice slept the whole way to Hogwarts and Willow was still attacking her dragon in her cage.
"No not at all," She motioned them to follow them out the door.
"Yes," Harriet said blankly.
"Did you have to get so many books?" Merry laughed.
"But it's not their fault," Harriet frowned. The three older girls just shrugged in lost of answers.
“The Draught of Living Death, sir.” She answered politely.
"I forgot the ice, hang on," He got up and went to go grab ice. The fireplace rang, Harry got up to go open the gates.
"Well I want to go see the library but it's fine if you guys don't want to. We can do whatever," She looked at the ground shyly.
"So you can see your friends and not feel as bummed out during the Holidays, plus Flint will be there," Merry sang out teasingly which made Harriet blush lightly.
Harriet was only 5 years old and still had a hard time walking and talking. She mostly just mumbled and stumbled her way through life.
She honestly wouldn't mind Ravenclaw, she loved to learn.
And learn until our brains all rot."
"I think we will end it for today," He grunted and landed so she landed right next to him.
Harry walked out of the book store with half of the books in the store.
"I'm Riley Woods."
"Really? That's quite impressive, Draco is thinking about trying out next year for chaser. He has been practicing almost non stop all break," Narcissa compliments her while also being proud of her own son.
"Professor," Is all Harriet said while staring at the cat who seemed a little annoyed that not a lot of students are in the class. Harriet frowned, she has seen this cat before. She gasped when she remembered.
"Don't listen to Ron, we are your friends," Harriet smiled at her, pushing away her anger towards the redhead.
For I'm the Hogwarts Sorting Hat
"Can we go on the floor?" Harriet pouted.
"I think Draco is really pretty," Harriet giggled, Draco smiled back at her. He loves when she laughs, he hopes he never has to see such a pure and kind person get hurt in their entire life. Even if others want her hurt, he will be there protecting her from everything.
She heard Flint swear a lot of curse words loudly which would have made her giggle if she was not about to die. The crowd gasped loudly again, Harriet awkwardly flung her other hand onto the broom and kicked her way onto her broom again. Her head was pounding and face bright red. She gulped down air a few times and looked for the snitch again. She found it easily and took off again. The other seeker came up beside her and keep swinging his arm towards her, she kept avoiding it, not wanting a fight just the snitch. The snitch went in a 90 degree downwards so she did the same. The seeker took her lead, she kept falling while he pulled up before her being afraid of faceplanting in the grass. She pulled up, the snitch at the tip of her broom so she stuck her hand out. It was out of reach.
"Riley helped my mother when she got severely ill," Merry explained, Harriet could see the look of worry and helplessness in her eyes. The same look she got when talking about her parents so she knew not to push it since it was very sensitive to Merry. Daphne and Tracey pulled back the curtains and cooed at her being sick. Riley soon came in with a toolbox or well medicine box and Millicent looking very worried.
"Merry," She whispered and shook her sleeping body lightly. She groaned and turned over to glare at her.
"I'm sorry, Aunt. I will put it in the refrigerator for someone other than me to eat later," Harry apologized as she hung her head. Aunt Petunia nodded and gave Uncle Vernon a kiss on the cheek as she left. Harry put the extras away and cleaned the kitchen as her Uncle ate silently. After he finished, she cleaned his plate.
Nothing. She did it again. Nothing. She did it harder. Still nothing. She looked up and looked for Flint's eyes. His eyes were equally confused. She pushed again, using her shoulders this time. Still nothing. Harriet rubbed her face tiredly. She felt her broom twitch, her heart jumped. Dear Merlin, please don't stop working now. She looked up to at the Teacher's area. Riley looked extremely worried, Snape was saying something under his breath to himself. She studied the movement of his mouth, he seemed to be chanting something. Also, Quirrell seemed to be doing the same thing. Her eyebrows furrowed in confusion. Her broom seemed to twitch at sudden movements but only slightly. She grabbed onto it, fearing the worst. She grabbed on at the right moment because her broom suddenly took off. The crowd gasped as it took her at odd turns and sudden movements. She looked up at Snape and whispered a fire charm. Fire lit his robe, Riley shrieked and stood up. Snape jumped up and patted the fire out. Quirrel fell out of his seat which meant her broom stopped moving but its last movement was throwing her off her broom. She squealed quietly and gripped onto the broom with one hand as she hanged.
"You will always have us, no matter what," Merry held her hand and squeezed it.
"Of course darling, I will take care of her for now but I will need to give her back to her original owner," She tried not to laugh at Minerva glaring at her.
"Like a fort?" Merry feels like Harriet has never made one from the look she gave her, noted.
"We should go up there," Theodore offered.
"What are you doing?" Aunt Petunia screeched. Harry looked at her confused, she used the supper plates, she cooked what they wanted. What did she do wrong?
Everyone clapped loudly and cheered. The hat nodded and went still once again. Professor McGonagall started to list of names. The first person to go up was a girl who got sorted into Hufflepuff. The table clapped loudly and cheered. 'This may not be that bad' Harry thought. Soon Merry's name was called.
~I wish to sleep,~ Beetlejuice hissed as his head poked out. He flicked his tongue to taste the air and slithered out with the help of Harry.
"There is something I also want to tell you or rather show you," Harry flinched at the show you part, she heard that before and it never ended well. He got up and grabbed a scroll with lots of dust on it. He handed it to her and said, "This is too soon I know but I feel like you should know about it." She slowly unraveled it in her lap. The writing was large and rushed.
"Her name is Autumn," Millicent said when seeing Harry's stare at her cat on her lap. Autumn is a very fluffy orangish cat with a weird nose. She seemed to glare at Harry.
"Will come in handy in the future," Merry winked. The girls all giggled while the boys just looked a bit scared. "Now come on." They all rushed to the girls dorm and Merry knocked.
"But I haven't ate?" They always at least give her something like an apple before she sleeps.
"I was going to take you there you know," He chuckled and got up.
"Everything," Merry said while pulling out a bag of coins. She bought three of everything.
"Fuck!" She swore as she fell. She is quite clumsy for some unknown reason. Harry got up to look at the ground, nothing, she tripped over nothing. She laughed and brushed herself off. She was a block away from the shop. The shop, in particular, was not very homey nor the exact opposite. It was dark but was lit faintly by torches. It smelled a bit foul but also like potions brewing and leather. It was a middle sized shop with a fireplace in the shopping area, a living room/library in the back. It also had a room where Mr. Feose slept upstairs and a brewing spot upstairs. The place was home enough for Harry despite its rather less equip-ness. She knocked on the door loudly, muggles were rushing past her. The muggles could not see the shop nor have ever even questioned people randomly disappearing. The door opened very quickly by no one. She stepped in and threw her bag on the rocking chair in the corner.
"Why? Because we know it's Halloween," Pansy snorted.
"Oh my fucking goodness! You actually did that!" She fell next to Harriet, laying her head on her shoulder crying from laughter. Her teammates landed and clapped. Flint grabbed her open hand and yanked her up in one go.
Cara, Merry's mother, smiled when she saw the girl's walking down the stairs, "Ready to go?"
Merry didn't want any awkward discussion to come from Harriet's treatment of Dobby, so she came up with a distraction, "Harriet is the starting seeker for Slytherin even as a first year." Dobby scurries off in fear, Harriet promises to herself that she will attempt to be friends with Dobby.
"No it's fine as long as you have my tarts," Harriet looked at the food she was holding.
"That really was cool though," Merry said as she packed up her things after the bell rang.
Harry was patient with potions and learning but not really anything else. She had a bit of temper.
"Don't worry I was really nervous the first time I played," Pucey smiled, trying to comfort her.
"So we have 2 more hours," Merry groaned. A knock came from the door again to reveal an older woman with a cart of sweets.
"Shh! The class is starting!" Merry hushed Draco which made Harriet giggle. The professor took attendance and when he called her name, he looked directly at her scar. Her scar burned like no other pain she has ever felt before. But she knew he was looking for a reaction from her so she just smiled and said 'Here'. He looked sort of disappointed but for only a second before he put back his stuttering fool act on again. As he talked, well more like stuttered, on and on about a boring subject, she just stared at him wondering why her scar hurt when he looked at her.
"I like plants so probably herbology," He said shyly.
"Bye-bye little pud-pud," Harriet kissed her on the head and said goodbye to Ms. Figgs. The cat meowed goodbye and placed her paw on her chest. "I will miss you too pud-pud but we will see each other again soon."
"Yes, I don't think that they would like you to be hanging around dark wizards."
"Your face!" Merry laughed.
"Wicked!" Harriet laughed. They talked as the other students needed help on their brooms.
"This is a key that will fit into all of your vaults and no one else can use it except you and the keys are now erased," The goblin pulled out another parchment.
"Next your hair," Merry sighed knowing it was going to take a long time.
"Even though a house elf could blow you over," Merry laughed. Harry's lips twitched in annoyance. She always had a hard time when people commented on her, mostly her body. They say, knobbled knees, short, wild tamed hair, freakish scar, too pretty to be smart, flat chested, too boyish. She dealt with the Dursley's picking out every single thing wrong about her to the point where she is very insecure when anyone says remotely anything about her. She knows to not care about what anyone says about her but when they say it directly to her face, it hurts. Harry knows Merry didn't mean it in a bad way but it just hit a sore spot with her.
"No but Harry could probably use a spell to find him," Merry offered. Neville looked at Harry who smiled at him and squeaked while blushing bright red. He refused to look at her again and only looked at the ground.
"Morning Harriet! Ready for the game?" Daisy smiled.
The lady at the counter snapped, "Are you here to socialize or to buy?!"
"The boys need to come with us so we have a proper headcount," Gemma informed sadly, "You guys can have a movie night later." The guys all left the room with their head down and said goodbye. The girls all put the pillows and blanket back, not saying anything.
"We?" Harriet looked up from the floor about to slide down a secret passage that leads to the outside of the dungeon.
"Let me guess, you already have it finished," Merry rolled her eyes playfully.
Sorry for any typos and I hope ye enjoyed <3
"We are bonding and becoming closer friends," Oh that's why this is important!
"I better get going," She sighed while rubbing the back of her head. Today was the day she got to go to Hogwarts, her Aunt tried to keep her from going but she would, oh yes she would go. Harry got up and pushed open the door slowly. She went to go clean until her hands bled.
------------Flashback-------------
Once everyone left and Draco was taking forever in the bathroom, Harriet asked Merry, "Who was that?"
"Good morning Harry," Ms. Haack sang sweetly.
"Not since last night and that cookie," Mr. Feose always has made her eat 3 meals per day no matter what. He always would rant about how important it is for a growing young body to eat properly. This way she doesn't have malnutrition at all but she does lack vitamin D. He makes her take some vitamin potions that makes her very healthy and her bones stronger.
"She seemed... I don't know... A bit depressed also," Tracey added.
"I have never been to a party?" Harriet frowned.
"Yes, you can. You can live on your own when you reach of age which is 18," He explained with a raised eyebrow. She was shaking in her seat, she can finally get away from the Dursleys'!
"Here we are," He cleared his throat from the heavy conversation.
"Have you asked?" Harriet raised her eyebrow.
"Take out the garbage, Freak!" Her Aunt screeched and held up a pan, threatening to hit her. She squeaked in fear and ran to grab the trash bag. She ran quickly out of the house and threw the garbage in the outside bin. She panted from the run and wiped her forehead. It was very hot and humid outside from the summer heat. She jumped a bit when she heard a cat meow. It was a brownish-gray cat who looked at her with a dull look. The cat was beginning to step towards her, looking focused and her shape started to get a bit fuzzy.
"Thank you Harriet!" Hermione ran up and hugged her. Harriet was frozen for a moment and then hugged back. "You saved me!" She wiped away her own tears.
"I never got to ask you that, why do you hate people calling you Professor Woods?" Hermione asked.
---------------------------------------------
"What?" Harriet shoved her face into the pillow.
"Thanks, Riley," Harriet smiled.
"It will be just fine," Merry assured her. The train started to slow down and squeak to a stop. Kids rushed out of their compartments excitedly. Harry got up and straightened her uniform, she has never been this nervous before in her entire life probably because this was the start of a new life for her.
Merry grumbled to herself, "Yeah. He still can be an arse though."
"My parents will?" Harry asked
"Is that it?" She said while getting up from the chair.
"I missed you so much!" Harry shouted.
"Yeah, it will be fun," Merry smiled.
"Most adults don't know more than kids, they are just simply winging it and trying to stay alive."
"You still in the 'boys are gross phase?'" He laughed.
"What?"
"Should we go get books?" Merry asked while putting her bags and kittens stuff in her trunk. Harry did the same with her bags.
Wrote this knowing I have a deadline for 2 assignments in 5 hours so sorry if it was complete crap
"Coulter, Crabbe, and Goyle. Your parents are about to leave, I suggest you all leave soon. The party is ending soon. Merry Christmas," With that, he left with no more words. Adrian and Derek cursed but Marcus smacked them upside the head for cursing in front of the young students. The group all said their goodbyes right after, the older ones left in a hurry. Marcus patted her head and wished her a Merry Christmas. He handed her a small gift, she excitedly thanked him back but worried that she didn't have anything to give back. Marcus just chuckled it off and patted her head once more before leaving with Achilles who seemed to want more pets from Harriet. Daphne went into a hug and Harriet awkwardly hugged her back. Pansy gave her a large gift and said it was a few clothes to improve her fashion sense. But Harriet knew it was because Pansy became worried when she saw Harriet in worn out clothing.
Harriet woke up screaming, sweat dripped down her face. Her throat was burning and her hands were bleeding from the indents of her nails. She gulped down air as Beetlejuice, her snake, tried to calm her.
"You never had any wizard candy," Merry explained and opened some Bernie's Bott Beans Every Flavor.
"Don't cry," She sneered at her whimpering niece, "For Merlin's sake! You are such a bother!" She shoved Harriet in the direction of her cupboard, "Get in there!"
"Hang on," Merry texted 'are you awake?' to Harriet. An almost instant response, 'No'. Smart ass response as usual. 'Herbology was canceled, want to watch a movie?'. The response took longer, 'What movie?'. Merry smirked, 'Beetlejuice,' Harriet's favorite movie and in good timing for Halloween. 'Yasssss,' was Harriet's response 'Bring fooddd'
"Yeah we are," Harry said quietly.
"But seriously if you feel like you are going to have a panic attack or get sick, tell me okay. I have an excuse already planned so we won't have to fly today," Merry whispered to her.
"Of course! But I will miss seeing you!" She giggled.
"Yeah, boys should be smart, everyone really should."
"There was a dark and powerful wizard, he started a revolution between the light and the dark. In the Ministry, there are 3 political stances the light, the gray, and the dark. The light wants more muggle influence like technology and they are complete pacifists. The dark wants to keep pureblood traditions and think that dark magic should be allowed. The gray is basically in-between when dealing with muggle uses and pureblood traditions. Obviously, there is more to that but that is the majority of it. The Ministry was taking the lights side by giving the muggleborns more rights than the purebloods. And well you know what muggleborn and pureblood mean," Mr. Feose stopped to take a drink of soda which he still is not used to drinking.
"Harriet Potter and Merry Baxter right?" The same girl asked. Both girls nodded.
I gladly accept to enroll in Hogwarts and will patiently wait until school starts.
"Why not three?" Merry asked defending.
"I'm not afraid or see them as bad, I'm just scared they will hate me because I'm stupid and weird!" Harriet leaned into Merry's calming touch, she tends to have these little mental breakdowns quite a bit. Harriet has absolutely no confidence in anything she does or anything she can do which causes her to always worry about how people think of her.
-------------------------------------------
"Okay, that's good," Harriet let out a breath relieved, "We probably should go eat breakfast before the others get worried."
------------------------------------
"Good morning. Name?" He pulled out some paperwork at looked down at her again when she didn't say anything.
After dinner, they all went to the library which may have led to Harry checking out 15 books. After staying there for a while, they realized it was close to 9 which meant they had to be in their dorms. They all walked to the dungeons while laughing about Merry telling a story of her mother once took care of a dragon which set half of their house on fire. The girls all said goodnight to the boys and walked up to their dorms. Some took showers while the rest got ready for bed. Harriet laid in bed with her baggy t-shirt on and saw the other girls texting on their phone probably telling their parents all about their day. Harriet quickly grabbed her phone and searched for Mr. Feose's number. She quickly typed in the number and texted him about how she got into Slytherin and how she liked her classes so far. After she was done typing and rereading her text she sent it. She looked over at the other girls who were laughing and eating sweets that Millicent brought in. Merry handed her one which she ate after checking it. As she ate the sweet Harriet thought that this was going to be an interesting year.
"I want the students to not see me as a Professor who judges their abilities but as someone, they can always come for advice or just plain old talking to. I want to help build the student, not judge them. Plus I'm quite young, I don't want to be compared to the old fuddy-duddy Professors here," He winked and chuckled. Hermione was about to say something about disrespect but he beat her to it. "I'm just joking Granger." She nodded and lead the boys out.
"I know this is a lot," Harry snorted at that, "But how about I give you some books about Hogwarts and politics in the Wizarding World to make more sense than I explained," Mr. Feose suggested. Harry gladly took the books and went back to her house after thanking Mr. Feose and saying goodbye. She read all throughout the night until morning.
"How were the books about nuclear war and origami?" Ms. Haack asked as she saw the books she was returning.
"No, I was going to go up after eating with some food to see how she was," Merry explained while popping in a strawberry.
"It's over 100, I know that," Harriet said softly. They hummed at her comment, not knowing how to continue this topic as they sat down. As they piled food on their plate, Harry looked around the room. Everyone seemed very lively and excited. She once again caught eyes with Flint. They continued to have what seemed to be a staring contest until Flint had to turn to his friend so their staring contest didn't get caught. She smirked because she won and started to eat. When she looked back at him, he was glaring slightly at her, knowing that he lost. She smiled kindly at him which seemed to startle him. He smiled back slightly which honestly looked like he was baring his teeth. She giggled and smiled brightly at him which made him shake his head and turn back to his plate.
"Is that good?" Harry showed the email to Merry.
"This was made before your parents could put his name on or Severus Snape's name," Harry nodded because Mr. Feose talked about both Riley and Severus before but he never mentioned them being close to her parents.
"Oh my god, we are such idiots!" Merry groaned into her hands.
"Wasn't expecting that," Merry laughed breathlessly.
"Better! Friends!" She swung open the door to reveal everyone which made Harriet yelp. "Wait shit did I scare you? Shit sorry!"
"I'm just saying why would muggles believe in a fat guy who creeps into people's houses?" He stated.
She is the sky, the earth, the wind, and the water.
"Okay, okay, sorry," He apologized. Harriet pushed him aside and delicately said a knockout spell which sent the troll to the floor.
"So?"
"Do you have a smart phone?" Merry asked while eating her chocolate ice cream.
"How about the main way?" Draco frowned at why they had to even question the path they should go.
"Ah shit," He swore.
"Shit!" She let go of the broom and checked her hand, her palm was bright red and definitely would bruise later.
"I do not!"
"Seems like nothing in there should be a problem," He smiled and closed his own medicine box which was a pretty red color. "I think it's nothing to worry about," Which made the other girls still watching in the room sigh in relief, "But I do want you to rest today and maybe even tomorrow just in case. I'm sure your friends can grab your homework assignments." He smiled at the other girls who all smiled back. Harriet looked at them, not really feeling the need to smile. She sunk more into her bed which was very soft and sunk in.
"No 'cause I knew you would know it," She laughed. They made their way to the Great Hall and sat down at the end. Harriet ate a muffin and an apple which she packed from earlier. Merry ate some roast beef and potatoes which she threw most of the at Blaise for talking in French for too long. Harry started to take back to him in French, they talked about the weather and how they were making Merry so upset very quickly.
"We," Merry corrected.
Harry finished tying her tie when the bathroom door slammed open, it was Merry laughing.
"I'm so sorry, I don't believe we have met," Mr. Feose coughed.
"Yes, did you even look at the schedule?"
"And we will all be there to help you," Daphne promised and Millicent grunted in agreement.
"What did he say?" He asked softly as he rubbed her back.
"Diagon Alley," She whispered as she threw the powder down. She closed her eyes and felt her stomach flutter as she felt air whip around her. When the air stopped she opened her eyes slowly to see a person looking at her.
"Don't you have to meet Flint soon?"
"Coming!" Mr. Feose shouted. He slammed open the doors and let out of a gasp when he saw Harry.
"Of course, what else?" She joked. He laughed and ordered their usual.
"I know, I know," Harriet giggled, "I am glad." She went to grab her plates of food and sat down next to Merry while Draco sat down next to her.
Also, I have a question would you guys like either a short chapter every 3-4 days (about) or a long chapter every 1 and a half - 2 weeks (about)? Or does it not matter?
"Well you are just excited to see the cute Quidditch players," Harry teased back. Snape grimaced while Riley chuckled.
"You are a very intelligent girl despite not growing up in the Wizarding world and you are tremendously sweet and supportive. Draco could use a friend like you who always supports him yet will keep him out of trouble or doing something wrong."
"Y-yeah it's j-just em-embarrassing and-and slightly fu-funny," Harriet stuttered while trying not to laugh at herself. Merry still looked at her worriedly so Harriet added," I will t-tell you late-later." Merry nodded in acceptance and turned back to the cat on the desk still confused. Harriet looked around to find Neville who was sitting by Hermione looking very scared and nervous. She wished she could go over there and say some calming words.
"Let's go find an animal," Merry said between giggles. They both walked to the store holding each other up still giggling. The store was filled with owls that hooted loudly and cats that had more than one tail. They lazily walked down the aisles until Merry squealed excitedly.
"Yeah, I eat a lot," Harry joked while faking a laugh. Merry didn't notice her fake laugh and laughed along.
I'll eat myself if you can find
"You can get a lot of muggle technology now," Merry nodded.
"Why?" Harriet looked up confused.
"What's wrong?" Merry looked over at her with her eyes blown wide. Harriet stuttered while blushing heavily.
"He said about a month," She rocked back and forth, she had a lot to do so she wouldn't seem like an amateur.
She remembers the book Merry and her read, '101 odd ways to catch the snitch'. Harriet remembered the 27th way, stand on the broom. For shit's and giggles, she did exactly that. She wobbled stood up on the broom, earning multiple gasps and swear words from the crowd. She lunged forward and off of the broom on accident to catch the snitch in her left hand, she almost caught it in her mouth on accident. She fell to the ground, she rolled over laughing while the Slytherin's screamed and chanted. The crowd clapped, not that excitedly though. Merry ran up to her laughing.
"Shut up Dean," He shoved the boy slightly laughing.
"Thanks," He coughed and rubbed the back of his neck.
"Okay," Harriet laughed back and wiped her tears away. They walked to the Great Hall laughing and holding hands.
"Well then you have to explain to Snape why you weren't in his class," She rang out as she walked away. Harriet's eyes widened and quickly packed up her things.
