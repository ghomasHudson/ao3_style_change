„I knew his friends wouldn't accept me,“ I ask, allowing the heavenly smells of sugar, coffee beans and chocolate to calm me. „But I didn't think they'd make it so hard for Harry.“
I follow her upstairs, every other step creaking. I'm not sure if it's the season or if the house just is on the darker side, with its narrow hallways and dark wood.
He shifts his weight on one elbow, using the other arm to pull my hands up and above my head, pinning my wrists to the mattress. „Look at you, darling.“
I'm rather sure it's not my mother who made me freak out just now with the john, but knowing she might die any day certainly didn't help, either.
Draco glances at me sideways. I roll into a parking lot and we finish the fries. When he's done, he uses the mirror to vanish the grease on his fingers and set his lipstick to rights again.
„Oh, I know I'm not. Do you have any idea how many people turn on their heels the moment they see me?“
there? It's a miracle the Ministry doesn't simply fall apart without you as Minister. You should start cloning yourself, so everyone can get a piece of your endless wisdom.“
It turns out that Greengrass's revelation was enough luck for one day. The Flints aren't in London. Their house is empty. I send an owl and Ron drags me to the next small restaurant.
The look George gives me borders on icy. But then it softens. He puts a hand on my shoulders and squeezes.
He rubs his dry, red eyes. „I mean, I'm better now. Lydia helped me and it's not... I do want to live. Sometimes I just feel like I can't. Like I'm... still this little boy that was only ever a liability.“
All the blood in my body rushes into my face and I start stammering. Malfoy swallows. Parkinson looks bored. Ron looks at me with an expression of utter astonishment.
„What?“ His voice sounds a little broken. He looks down at me. His hands are fidgeting. The nails are bitten down to the quick.
Feeling like a whore, because, apparently, he's no good at anything other than shut his mouth and take it. And even that isn't really something he excels in.
and his hair looks like a bird would've nested in it. Apparently, no one has ever, in all those years, told Harry that his glasses look ridiculous. The man is a mess, as Draco suspected he would be.
„I'm sure you can survive peeing your bed for the rest of your life, if that's how it is going to be.“
“I’ll be right back,” I say to the handsome bloke, smiling at him and putting down my flute with precision.
And if all of that wasn't enough already, I spent the last three years selling my arse to anyone willing to pay just to survive.
When she closes the door behind her, I can hear a sob. Ron just stand there, burying his face in his hands. Cautiously, I step over and drape an arm around his shoulders.
„How many more vampires do I need to take down before you get it into your thick skull that I'm not harmless?“
I'm flipping through a book on Metamorphmagi, stumbling over one chapter that I have to read more closely. It deals with the origin of them and how it works differently from common magic, which usually requires the usage of a wand.
There is so much bitterness in my voice, it surprises even me. What do I care what some pureblood idiot thinks of me?
They work as friends. They won't work as fuckbuddies, Harry knows that. And Draco isn't into him. Sleeping with him would be the worst thing Harry could do.
He's not, but I still can't bring myself to crawl back into bed. Instead, I pull one of our two plastic chairs next to the bed and watch Potter.
Draco looks at Harry. Whatever he sees in the Gryffindor's face, it's enough to make him lower his wand.
Teddy is holding my hand as we're walking down the stairs – him being the one who reached for it in the first place. That alone should have been a giveaway. Kids don't usually like me much.
I have never, in all the five months we've officially been dating, seen Draco so involved in dinner. He usually likes
The cry George lets out shocks me just a little. I'm used to all sorts of cries and screams and grunts and what not, but it's been a while since I've been confronted with pain like this.
Weasley strides ahead and Harry holds my hand. He's trying to hide it, but I can tell he's nervous as well.
I have been to Harry's house before, even spent the night here, but it feels different this time. He doesn't shag me in the hallway the second we arrive. Instead, he asks: „Are you hungry?“
To his delight, Draco complies. They've been dating for a month now, yet Harry feels like Draco wants to keep him at arm's length.
I hate gyms. Wizards don't have them, at least to my knowledge, and I understand perfectly well why. They're disgusting – a gathering of sweaty, grunting people, either showing off or silently praying no one notices them struggling. The air smells of sweat, metal and disinfectants.
I wonder of he told them about me. I doubt it, because if he had, they'd have probably already murdered me.
We approach a round table that is filled with old classmates of mine and I focus on breathing evenly. This is going to be bad. It's going to be bad and that's okay, because this, for once, is totally, entirely my fault. They hate me because I've been an arsehole.
„I guess love is being willing to die for someone,“ I say. As the words are leaving my mouth, I realize I don't agree with myself.
I should’ve kissed him right in front of Harry. I want to tell him about all the blokes I took to bed.
„I'll grab something on the way. Knowing you, you probably only have coffee and chocolate in store, don't you?“
There is a fair bit of smut in this chapter. It's not really any more explicit than it is in the rest of this series, but I just wanted to give a little heads-up.
I don't think about Malfoy's hands on my crotch. Not at all, because when I do, heat is rushing through my body and that is just wrong on so many levels.
I nod. „Yes, I... had an idea what we could do. It's not perfect by any means, but I hope it might at least make the situation a little better for him.“
I know that Harry isn't as in love with all those shiny, unnecessary things as I am, but I remember him saying that he does appreciate it from time to time.
Both Sam and Harry look up from the files they'd been looking at for almost an hour now, watching Terry standing over them, his blue eyes dark. Blaise is leaning in to hear the Ravenclaw out as well.
I wandlessly conjure lube (a skill I spent hours perfecting) and start opening him up with gentle, but sure fingers. Draco is writhing underneath me, clutching at my back, his head tilted back. Thin, silvery streaks run out of the corners of his eyes into his blond hair.
I think it will take me a lot more months until I can try being friends with Harry without breaking all over again every time I lay eyes on him.
Without even telling Serena, I leave the bar. I follow Potter across the room. My world narrows to nothing but him.
And why am I even thinking about that? Potter ditched me. It's over now. The next time I run into him, I'll just nod politely and then get on with my life.
Potter takes his sweet time. I feel half-mad when he finally gets back. My back is itching and the heavy metal cuffs cut into my wrist. They're sore and open.
All I wanted was to give everything I have to Harry. He’s the one I wanted to spoil with my new riches. He’s the one I wanted to buy a bathtub for.
I invite Ron at least once a week, but he rarely shows. Mostly, we hang out at his flat. Not really talking about Hermione, even though she's the reason he's never at mine.
Ron shakes his head. „No, there is someone. I'm just not sure if she wants to break up with me because there is someone or if there is someone because she wants to break up with me. You feel me?“
When I hear the door down the hallway open and then steps approaching my cell, I think it's Weasley again, coming to beat the living daylights out of me.
By now, Draco has been in my house plenty of times – but never alone. There were always the faint voices of our sons, sometimes the drum of footsteps or the soundtrack of some movie.
Maybe he doesn't want people to know he's gay. But that would be a little weird, since there are currently two queer people at their table.
It took Harry a little bit of convincing until I agreed to talk the procedure through with Granger before we'd actually went.
„You guys were a really depressing lot to be around. Do you really think it'd cheer me up to be silently stared at for hours?“
I'm a little surprised when Weasley puts his wand under Flint's jaw. „What the hell? I didn't do anything!“
I rub my eyes with the knuckles of my hand. „It's nothing. There was someone, after... you know, when Ginny and I were broken up. It wasn't serious.“
„I mean, do I still love him – yes. Of course I do. But if he wants to be with Hannah, well – it might be for the best anyway.“
„Three players have been accused of abuse so far,“ Zabini says. „But none of them got benched or even kicked out, because no one could prove they really did take the potions. Even though everyone was sure they did.“
He gives a tiny shrug. „I'm still mad for you hurting Mom. But... I mean, if you and Harry were together, Albus and I would be something like brothers. That would be cool.“
But Harry waits until my own tongue is darting out, flicking over his bottom lip, before he opens his mouth. The first touch of our tongues ignites a fire in my belly that I've never felt before. Not like this. I do remember, darkly and faintly, wanking in the safety of my own bed, silencing charms put up. Those are my best memories of sex.
I don't listen to anyone but Pansy anymore. Many men talk a lot. They talk and talk and talk and I know now that words mean nothing.
And maybe, I also miss kissing him. I don't know what it means that kissing him was like everyone says snogging a Veela is – mind-blowing. A kiss to me has never felt like this.
I shrug. „It's fine. I get why you did it. In the end, it's what saved us all. If I'd have just gone then, many people who are now dead might still be alive.“
Of course, the public adjusted rather quickly to Harry's change in career. They were a little confused at first, begged him for a week or so to come back (
I wait as the couple exchanges a quick look, confusion written all over Ron's features. I think he's asking Hermione: „I didn't get that right, did I? He didn't really spell
She grins and plants a kiss atop my head. „You're not half as cold or tough as you think, Draco. And not half as mean.“
He's mouthing at my jaw, slowly fucking his fingers in and out of me, making me moan and cry and beg.
I think about his boyfriend and the pain in my heart is dull. I hope he's treating Draco right. I hope he knows how lucky he is to have him.
„I do.“ I brush his hair back, then start grinning. „Honestly, if we broke up now, Hermione would probably hunt me down for robbing her of her new book club.“
Ninety percent of our time together is almost as good as it was back then, before we kissed and ruined it.
I come inside him and he stops breathing, staring up at me in awe. I pull out and suck him off, two fingers shoved into his swollen, fucked-red hole. He comes quickly, fingers fisted into my hair.
I'm sitting on my desk, the three letters in front of me, trying to decide what I want to do. Which of them interests me the most, which is the most promising.
Al sprints back to my bedroom and I pet Scorpius head. He's vomiting again and I try to assess what it is exactly that's wrong.
„So that means you'll be doing the internship with the DADA classes and maybe later on the one with the pre-Hogwarts children?“ Hermione asks, handing me a cup of coffee. She might be a terrible cook, but her coffee is the best of all.
„As a fair warning though: I'm a mess, Potter. A trainwreck, actually. I'd say I'm definitely undatable and horribly complicated and wouldn't advise you to take me up on my offer and yet, I have to ask you out. Because I've been thinking about you all the time. I've missed you and I want you and I want to try.“
After a week, I can't bear it anymore and talk to Pansy. We're sitting in the apartment she's sharing with Weasley and she pours me tea.
„It's fine,“ I say and that's the moment Ron comes padding into the living room, clad in his thin pajama bottoms.
Reluctantly, I loosen my grip. Before Draco can turn away, I take his shoulder. He lets a curtain of hair cover his features, but I push it behind his ears.
It takes Harry so long to answer that Draco almost grabs and shakes him. At least spits something cruel into his face.
It's a turning point. If Draco says no, Harry will leave. Draco knows that with a certainty that should surprise him. But if he says yes...
I grin widely and press a quick kiss to his belly. „Oh, I want you to do it to me, too, believe me. But let me go first.“
This, falling on the sofa in a tumble of limbs, sucking bruises into his pale neck while he's moaning, sifting his hands through my hair, canting his hips suggestively.
He kisses me and for a few long moments, we're lost in our lips moving together, in no hurry at all. When I draw back, my face has grown serious. I trace the shape of his mouth with my finger.
Still, Draco can't make himself leave the house just yet. This might be the last time he's allowed in here and he wants to soak up every little detail. Grimmauld Place is so full of Harry's things that it makes Draco's heart ache.
Draco manages to get dressed before Derek stirs and is out of the flat with a rustle of his coat, his boots making close to no sound on the floor.
Muggle clubs lack the finesse of most wizarding clubs, but then again, I'm very sure I wouldn't be able to appreciate said finesse anyway, so who cares?
„There's a mob in front of our apartment,“ Parkinson says, smoothing down her hair. She's wearing heavy make up.
I slip one hand into my pocket and close it around the sachet, then try to push it into Potter's hand.
I bump into one of Harry's older students on my way downstairs, where I know Pansy is waiting for me. It's the first time that happens. The boy must have lingered. He's not quite as tall as I am. Brown hair. Freckles.
I know it's kind of risky to walk into a brothel with Dreamscales in your pocket, but I'm Harry Potter and though I mostly hate it, I know that it also protects me. Even though I'm here in disguise – as an Auror and the Chosen One, I'm sure I could find an explaination why I have drugs in my possession.
The procedure stretches over most of the day. I have to wait an hour until it's time for my testimony. Having to sit on that chair and tell a whole room of people gazing at me in disdain what Julien did to me, is almost worse than waiting for a john to enter the room.
„Why?“ He stares at me, betrayal written in his childish eyes. Everything inside of me clenches. I can't breathe. „And why with Albus' dad?“
Around one a.m., we eat grapes and crackers. I'm warm in his jumper, curling up on his sofa. I know I should leave, but I'm too cozy right now.
My heart loses its rhythm when Harry slowly slides his arm through the bar. My pulse is beating hard in my throat as I move my own hand close enough for Harry to take it.
I shout because of a twist of Malfoy's finger. I should be embarrassed, but – oh my God. This feels like nothing I've ever experienced. It's a searing, pulsing kind of pleasure deep inside me, a pleasure that is almost too intense to bear and yet, so much more patient than the pleasure I know.
Pansy hitches one shoulder. „Neither do you.“ She takes another sip, dark eyes still frighteningly clear. „He won't let you.“
He sucks on Harry's throat before moving lower, his hands slipping under Harry's shirt. The Gryffindor's hands move back to Draco's hips, then over his back and Draco's whole body is on fire.
Only now, Harry notices the familiar shape of the eyes, even though estranged by fake lashes and a ton of makeup, plus the curve of her nose.
I focus and gather my magic, already sizzling in my core, and get ready to blast this vampire off of me.
I blink and look up. Wearing a hood constantly has the unwelcome side effect that I'm often oblivious to my surroundings. I guess I should really start working on my Glamour, but somehow, I can't make myself not resent it. It just takes so much concentration to keep up. And sometimes, people see through it. My hair and my scar both refuse to coorparate whenever I try to change them magically.
Harry hums, not quite convinced. Draco gets up and joins him on the couch. Just like everyone lately, Draco seems tired. Harry lightly brushes his hair back.
„Usually, you saying that would hint at a pending duel, but I trust you not to make me start a fight at my new work place.“
I blush and try to object, but the second finger pushes inside again and he twists it just so, hitting the spot dead-on. All I can do is moan.
„Yeah. I think he's pulled himself together a bit and is ready to fight for her. He says it's ridiculous and honestly, I think he's right.“
A smile ghosts around Malfoy's pale lips. It's a new expression. One I didn't know before. „Of course it does. Someone has to make sure to deflate your big ego.“
„Potter is making you mental,“ Pansy says, not even bothering to roll her eyes at Draco's ridiculous response.
“And it's quite understandable that you freaked out when I cast that curse. It wouldn't have worked, but you couldn't know that.“
Harry smiles at me, and it's the same, yet not the same as always. The Weaslette eyes me, not hostile, but definitely suspicious.
I want to ask Malfoy if he wants one as well, but then I can't bring myself to. As soon as I'm ordering another latté, I feel bad and add a black coffee.
The muggle pub I've chosen is close by and by the looks of it, more a modern bar than an old-fashioned club.
I look at you as you study my face. You're pretty sure of yourself in that moment, but there is a lingering nervousness on your features.
„I think it was a sense of duty. My mother was Petunia's sister. I think she felt obligated to take me. Even though she hadn't been close to my mom for years.“
A strange, unsettling feeling comes over me. For years, the name Narcissa Malfoy didn't mean much to me. She was just this haughty, regal looking woman that I despised because of her husband and git of a son. Then she was the mother who would have done anything to save her son, helping me in the process.
I don't really know what to say to that. Except that, whatever he thinks, I know now that Malfoy has changed, in the end. The Malfoy I remember from school would have never talked like this.
I look away and crumple the paper between my fingers. Ginny reaches for me, but I pull my hand away.
Tall, taller than me, which is always a plus. A bit on the lanky side, but that's fine. His hair is dark and cropped short. A tight shirt is accentuating his lean muscles.
It relieves me. This way, it's easier to take. It is because I understand George's pain. I understand his need to make it stop and I understand that I'm the best candidate to blame. I'm a vessel for him and that is fine. He's not a cruel man, not inherently. He's hurting.
Draco looks at him for a long time. „I don't know what to say,“ he finally says and Harry tries his very best not to be disappointed.
„You're not giving yourself enough credit, Draco. You're strong. You survived things others can't even imagine. You're actually not stupid – no, you're smart. And beautiful.“
„Dammit,“ the man says. He turns far enough for Harry to see his profile, lifting his phone. Probably looking for directions.
I laugh a little. The smile I give Potter is almost warm. I can't pretend I wouldn't be touched at what he's done. I hate him for it, but I'm also touched.
My little patient is wearing pajamas and seems a little drowsy, leaning against his grandma's legs and choosing not to talk to me.
I can't read Draco's face as he turns his head away. The always present line around his mouth deepens.
„You are a very bad business man, Harry,“ Draco tells him, his hands petting Harry's thighs. One slips under Harry's jumper and presses lightly against his stomach.
Harry is dying to know how Malfoy knows this junkie, why he froze when walking into this room, but he knows that asking wouldn't do any good. Malfoy would never tell him.
I try not to be affected. In the end, it doesn't matter who is splitting me open. Some of the clients will probably be easier than my captors.
When he starts kissing my neck, rolling his hips, I lose my mind. My hands fly to his back, caressing it. Slipping under his shirt.
After three months, Pansy and I can move into an apartment again. It's as small as the old one was, but a little prettier.
„I don't have any more to offer.“ The words are drawn from my mouth by his goddamn eyes. His hips. His hands. His mouth.
I take off my coat and put in on the rack, toeing off my shoes, wishing I was someone like Pansy – someone whose face everyone has already forgotten.
I miss Draco already and he's in the same room as I am. Before he can open the door, I spin him around for one last kiss. Against his lips, I whisper:
He smiles. „I like when you say my name,“ he signs and while I have a near death experience, Harry falls asleep.
I nod, drawing up my walls. „I understand. If you'd rather look for someone else, I could help you. There is a lot of trust required between patient and healer. But I will have you know that I take my job very seriously. I'm brilliant at it.“
I nod and give him a more genuine smile. Maybe I'd have come with him if George wasn't there. And if I didn't have plans already, that is.
„There isn't really anything to do until the others get back,“ the Gryffindor starts, pushing up his glasses. Draco eyes him.
Harry throws a quick look over his shoulder and closes the door behind him, stepping out on the porch.
Over the last years, I've become quite accustomed to muggle drinks and have also finally grasped the concept of muggle cash, even though I still find the paper money to be irritating.
Someone passes us from behind and I flinch. Harry places one hand on my lower back. I think he quite likes that place. I do too.
The deeply unsettling realization that some part of me seems to be attracted to Draco Malfoy has me resorting to desperate measures.
She takes a swig from her wine. „The usual. At one of his father's dinner parties. Our parents introduced us and the rest is history.“
Sometimes, mostly when the shop is busy, Potter will only drop by for a couple minutes, looking at our newest products and chatting with me about the weather, before leaving again.
But that was a different kind of fear. It was so powerful, it knocked me off my feet, had my heart racing and my breath catching.
I know I have no right to. Potter, on the other hand, has every right to be mad at me. To hate me, even.
Both Parkinson and Malfoy seem exhausted when I find them upstairs after lessons are finished for the day.
Half my brain is busy fighting the images of hands pulling at me – palms leaving red and blue marks on my skin. Men forcing themselves inside me. Tearing me open.
„Do you want to come to mine after your shift?“ I ask, thumb stroking over Draco's hand. He's smiling. I think I can feel his heart pounding.
Draco turns and pulls my arm around him. I don't dare to breathe when he presses his body against mine. „Hold me tighter,“ he says and I comply immediately, burying my nose in his hair.
Malfoy blinks at me and I can tell he's uneasy. I made him uneasy and I feel I can hardly breathe in this room, this room smelling of sex and perfume and faintly of mold.
Harry runs the shop, but he doesn't know how to make sweets. Which is fine by him – he's never been a baker or much into cooking either. He gladly gives Lavender and Raymond free reign when it comes to creating the heavenly sweets that soon render the business's fame valid. He even allows them to pick new employees – after he's run a thourough background check on them.
Malfoy blinks at me. „That's unfortunate.“ He pulls my shirt off, then presses up against me, hands digging into my hips.
I get back to my office. Harry isn't there, but I didn't expect him to be back already. He's interrogating Flint's wife again. She told us just about nothing last time and I think it's a good idea to try her again.
Potter's skin knits back together. I keep on casting until nothing is left of his violence but two big, rosy scars, so tender, I'm afraid to touch them.
He has nice eyes. Green. His jaw is square, his hair a chocolaty brown. Normally, I go for guys a little more slender, but he's hot, no question.
I nod, leaning in slowly. Press my mouth against his shoulder. Not kissing it. Just rest there, breathing against him.
He's sitting on a small mattress, next to his godson, reading to him. The mess of black hair is a giveaway, as are his striking eyes, covered by hideous glasses. The five years that have passed since I last saw him didn't do him much good. He's still rather scrawny and while I do think that he looks older, he also looks as tired as I remember him.
Albus rolls his eyes, his sympathy for me apparently already forgotten and then he drags Scorpius away from me.
The first time Derek came home smelling of another guy's cologne, Draco threw a fit. But Derek somehow twisted things so effectively that, in the end, Draco felt like the bad guy. And, also, Derek told him that he could always leave.
She rolls her eyes. “I really hope his arse still makes you as mad as it used to, because otherwise I’d say put your dick away and leave the Golden Boy be.”
„Yeah, it does sound promising. But let's not think too easy. I mean, it's less likely, but if Mrs. Flint really did sleep with Runcorn, she's a possible subject as well. We don't know what their relationship was like.“
When Jenna manages to land a well-placed hex and Cyrus goes down, I blow my whistle and end the fight.
I clear my throat and rush through my greetings. „I've written this book for gaining a clearer understanding of who Lord Voldemort was and how it was possible for him to establish such an oppressive reign with a comparably small amount of followers.“
One time in Februrary, Ginny wrote him. She asked him how he was doing. How school was. She said she missed him.
I snort. „Yeah, I figured.“ My jaw clenches and I'm not sure if the nausea in my stomach is caused by alcohol or the Slytherin. „I don't really get why though.“
Greengrass shakes her head decisively. „No. Laila is a good wife. She loved her husband and would have never cheated on him.“
He turns to Parkinson and Malfoy. „You both have my floo address. If you need anything, don't hesitate to call me.“
„Thanks,“ I read from his lips. He won't look at me. I wish he would. Communicating is hard enough as it is when you're deaf – if the person you're trying to have a conversation with isn't even showing you their face, it becomes nearly impossible.
Harry will not let Draco insult his friends, but he feels like, by Draco's standards, this is not a real insult. Pick your battles.
Potter looks into his glass. „I don't know. Hermione is trying to talk herself into believing that Ron and her could never work in the first place and Ron just keeps ranting about how she's out to fuck with his life.“
Too many people Harry has loved in his life had left him. First his parents, then Sirius, Remus and, of course, Dumbledore. And the latter had not only left him, but lied to him about everything, right from the beginning.
Potter's posture relaxes a fraction. His expression shifts from anger and worry to something more like irritation.
I didn't really think my suggestion for today would evoke anything other than giddy excitement in Draco.
„We need to stick together. If we're fighting, we won't get anything done,“ the Ravenclaw says, voice sharper than Harry has ever heard it.
„I still can't believe she actually apologized to you,“ Ron says, as if he'd have read his thoughts. His eyes are on Parkinson and her expression is cooling significantly.
The ceremony goes by in the blink of an eye and at the end of it, I'm all teared up and applauding like a mad man.
„I'm doing everything wrong,“ he says, looking at his coffee. Then up and shakes his head, rolling his eyes at me in a self-deprecating manner. „It's all good, really. I'll fix it.“
Granger rolls her eyes, but her gaze at the ginger is fond. Weasley gives us something that's probably meant to be an aloof smile.
Harry and I are drinking tea in the kitchen when Weasley barges in, a rolled up Prophet in his hand. He slams it on the table in front of us.
It's around three a.m. already when the first people finally leave. Usually, I'd be happy that the party was such a success – people are dancing, Luna and Ginny even making out eventually, Harry's mouth twisting. Then he's blushing. Looking at me. Rolling his eyes.
The moonlight is illuminating the kitchen as I keep Andromeda in a dead lock, her hand away from her wand.
They're lying entangled for a while, Draco listening to Harry's heartbeat, until the sticky feeling between his thighs is starting to become really gross.
“You're a hero, man,“ another of them says and I drown out their voices, my eyes scanning the tables.
He shrugs and one of his easy smiles appears on his face. Smiling always looks calculated on me. Strained, sometimes. On Potter, it's the easiest thing in the world.
She pauses and looks into my eyes. „But there isn't. I've never even heard about a spell to counter lycantrophy and if I had, I'd never have used it if it means my child will always be feeling sick and weak. That trade isn't a fair one.“
Pansy is quiet for a moment. „Alright, I understand. But then go get a different job. One Potter can live with.“
I roll my eyes, then stare straight ahead. „I don't need your pity,“ I sign, not caring that she can't understand it.
Ron huffs out a small breath. „Bad things, Harry. I don't – I don't like to think about it. I don't want to believe what some people are capable of.“
Parkinson's eyes dart at me, then away. „For one, Draco and I are different people, Potter. We deal with things differently. But Draco had it harder than me too.“
I kiss him again, then say: „No one has to know. We can forget it as soon as it's over if you want to. Just...
As much as Harry wants to function like a normal human being, he can't escape the thoughts. They mostly come at night.
The alcohol is buzzing in my veins. Granger, a little startled by my unexpected knowledge, needs a split second to recover.
He pinches the thin skin of his cuticles until he's bleeding and finally, his heart slows a bit. His airways clear.
For the first time in my life, tears are rolling down my cheeks and I'm not ashamed of them. I just let them roll, salty in my mouth.
Just when I think that this isn't at all how I always imagined it to be, despite the exstatic expression on Harry's face when he bottoms out, he hooks my right leg a little higher over his shoulder, changing the angle.
Rain is turning the light grey of my trousers into a dark, muddy mockery of the pristine colour. There is nothing overly pristine about the trousers themselves, but the colour was, before the rain interfered. I keep my gaze firmly fixed on the cobble stones that are slippery with wetness. My shoes used to be posh, but now they're worse off than my trousers. Not just from the rain though, but mostly due to the amount of time I've been wearing them for.
„Good. I've told them that you're giving lessons almost every day and that they're not to disturb you. And I think it would be good if you told them not to – you know. Run into your kids.“
Her dark gaze meets mine again. It's unsettling, how it makes me feel like I'm eleven again, like nothing had changed at all, and at the same time like we're both completely different people.
My magic is roaring, cackling in the room. Draco swallows, but doesn't budge. He's still looking at me, defiant. Pained.
„I'm not saying you're wrong, I just... I mean, we're looking for the person who started this, right? The cradle of those Ipos, if you will. And I just don't think it's Quidditch.“
„Then don't. Everyone knows we're together now,“ Harry says, before going back to marking Draco's skin.
But with BSL, Ron isn't such a bad student. I secretly find it adorable how upset he gets when he can't get the hang of one sign or the other. Unlike Hermione though, who then gets frantic and doesn't know what to say at all anymore, Ron mostly just laughs and starts signing gibberish – that I, more often than not, actually understand.
Pansy doesn't look up from her work, but for a moment, the letters and numbers in front of her eyes lose all meaning. „Alright. Why do you need my help?“
Kissing Malfoy makes me hot all over. It makes me moan and it makes me desperate. I keep trying to get closer, even though we're already pressed flush.
„I just wonder if ends are ever going to meet in this case,“ Sam sighs after they've gone round in circles for quite a while. Blaise takes her hand and squeezes, smiling at her.
I'm wearing one of his jumpers (I like his better than mine), leaning against the kitchen counter and picking at the remnants from Weasley's breakfast. Harry is draining a cup of coffee.
One look at Ron and I know that I'm not going to be the only one in need for a little heart-to-heart tonight.
Draco loves fashion. I'm convinced he hasn't expressed half of his style yet. But we're working on it.
Ron and Hermione stay until we've finished the last bottle of wine and Draco is so relaxed that he's snarking with Ron like they do when they're alone.
I'm in the hallway, carrying two heavy shopping bags with groceries, when the front door opens and Draco enters.
My hand is in my pants. I don't allow myself to stop and take a moment to think about this. What it means.
With a groan, Harry crowds in close again, catching me by my thighs. Hauling me up. Sweet desire is burning in my chest as he pushes me against the door, fumbling his zipper open with one hand.
But, luckily, even as a wolf, my rational side won the fight and I stayed put. Eventually, Teddy stopped howling.
„It has always been one of my very favorite cities in the world. And I think I recall you saying you've never been, so I thought...“
But Narcissa nods. „Yes. She doesn't know where he is, either.“ I'm pinned down by a razor sharp gaze. „Do you believe he is in trouble?“
Harry doesn't meet me at the bar like usually, but I'm not surprised. I know his friends are having a party for him and he'll probably come over late.
The person now entering the room keeps their head low, as most of us do. The jacket they're wearing is dripping, face shadowed by a huge hood that faintly reminds me of a dementor. I think it's a bloke, judging by the rather broad shoulders and comparably narrow hips.
It's been four months since Pansy shook off the paralyzation. Eight times the same question. We've been here every other week.
Harry very lightly punches my shoulder. Then, his fist opens and his fingers curl around my shoulder. I feel faint.
Potter seems to sense that his eyes on me make me beyond uncomfortable, because he doesn't look at me when I push the berry into my mouth. It makes a little pop as my teeth crush the skin and it tastes... a little like kiwi and blueberries. A little bit like cherries.
„I.“ Harry has trouble thinking with Draco's lips on his neck. He bites, lightly. Harry's breath catches in his throat.
I have indeed, for a week now. I'm only just getting used to the luxury of Harry's huge bathroom, of the warmth and the food. And the absence of greedy men.
“Look, if you... told them what Julien did to you, then that would shine a whole new light on the case. I mean, all I said to them was that it was obvious you were afraid and Julien wasn't on professional business, forcing you to go with him againt your will. But if I could tell them what the actual reason for your fear was – it might change everything.“
And through all of that, there was always Harry Potter who, if he'd had tried, could have had me anytime, any way he'd wanted to.
He pauses a moment. „I didn't have many options after the trials. When Pansy started to strip here, I didn't want to leave her alone.“
It's hard for him, not seeing Harry at work all day. Since Flint locked him in the dungeons, Draco'd like to keep Harry in sight at all times.
„It's not like I need him. I don't need a man at all. I'm perfectly fine on my own. I just thought it would be nice, you know, to reconnect? Because you can't tell me he's over me. His reaction clearly shows -“
I focus on Harry's question and take a breath, hoping the oxygen will banish the weakness in my body.
I look at Ron, the early morning silence making our voices appear louder, heavier than they actually are. There is something about those hours that lends everything some kind of gravitas that it wouldn't have in the daytime.
Malfoy ignores me and turns back to Robards. „He wasn't able to think clearly. I made sure of that.“
Objectively, I have to admit that she's prettier than Malfoy is. But unlike him, she excudes a coldness that would keep me at distance.
Still, I can't watch him leave like this. I get up and grab my pants, shrugging them on. Following him out of my room.
„You were surprised about Dean and Seamus as well. Which shows how oblivious you are, but that's beside the point.“ She studies my face with eyes way too smart for my liking. „Harry, do you -“
He must have let go of my wrists at some point, because now my arms are wrapped around his neck, my legs steel around his waist as he fucks into me, cheek on cheek with me, spilling inside me on a long, broken groan.
The barista smiles at me, his nose ring shining in the light. He sports a head full of brown curls and endearing dimples. His fingers brush mine as he hands me my cup of black coffee.
My boss even throws me some concerned glances and I mess up the customer's oders more than once, resulting in less tips and more bad-mouthing me behind my back.
My mother's face is pale and fragile, but the expression on it is almost peaceful. I'm never sure if that gives me hope or rather forces me to admit defeat.
I don't give a damn. I come into his mouth and he swallows it like I swallowed his and my brain is wiped blank.
I give him my iciest smile. „That wasn't being mean, Potter. It was merely a helpful suggestion how to salvage your soon-to-be-awful sex life.“
After what feels like forever, he pulls back. His fingers remain where they are, barely moving. My skin feels too tight and I want to hide, yet never move.
Malfoy's kitchen is tiny. It's really, really tiny and doesn't look like his at all. Beside his huge tea collection, maybe.
„Sure. Would be about time I beat you,“ Draco says lightly, hoping that it's an acceptable answer that won't make a fool of him.
„Now I feel like I'm just drifting. I always try so hard to be good and make things right, but it's like I can't anymore. I'm not good for anything. I'm just kind of... there.“
„Um... did we make plans?“ I ask. I wouldn't put it past me to have forgotten about them, should they have existed. My memory isn't the best lately.
I look at him and set my tea down. With one step, I've crossed the distance between us. I haul him in and kiss him roughly. Malfoy makes a little gasp that I respond to with a groan and then I lift him up and put him down on the counter. It's a little messy – Malfoy isn't as light as he looks and I'm not as strong as people think I am, but now he's tilting his head down and kissing me.
„No, she wasn't. She was in love with Cedric. I think she cried on all our dates. She even cried when I kissed her.“
I've never seen Draco naked before and part of my brain registers how absolutely gorgeous he is – all long legs and his back a perfect curve. But most of my brain is busy processing all the bruises on his body. Most are fading from healing spells.
„Are you sure you don't want to get out of the house a bit?“ she asks me one afternoon and I shake my head. I've just began to not fear every shadow of this strange house that once belonged to my family. Going out seems like too much.
„How are you?“ she asks me, still with that faint worried undertone she has adopted since my breakup with Ginny.
„He's feeling the low, so don't be surprised if he's being a little shit,“ the guard tells them before leaving.
„She kind of was. But when she realized I'm as bent as they come, she got over it. It was awkward for a bit, but... we got past it.“
He moans, broken. Desperate. His hips push against me. He's rock-hard in his pants, so hard it must hurt.
His eyes grow softer. Pleading, almost. „Look, I get why you don't want people to know. I won't tell anyone, if that's what you want. But don't hide from me.“
The first time I do, Draco's face lights up when he sees me. I hand him a cup of coffee, kissing him on the mouth very briefly.
„We can. I only have to make sure you understand that this is illegal. If someone finds out, you'll face serious punishment.“
I rush through my shower (Ginny's bathroom isn't really one to fawn about), then slip into one of her baggy shirts and my own pants and pad over to her bed. She holds up the covers for me and I crawl under them.
The biggest change though isn't his physical appearance, but the way he carries himself. Gone is the permanent downturn of his mouth, the comically raised chin. Instead of arrogance, he know moves with a deliberate confidence.
Some of the people we're passing throw us a look or two. But all they see is Malfoy scum being escorted out of the building.
Harry snaps. He blames it on the high tension, on the panic – the past terror and his present, very very real fear of Draco leaving.
I make a show of rolling my eyes as I'm unfolding the note. But when I read it, I can't keep up my bored facade.
Draco's eyes are steel and if the situation wasn't so precarious, Harry would be proud of him. „You're not my friend.“
Before I can open my mouth and tell him that it's him that I want, that I think he is the best, Draco continues.
It's not the first time playing Quidditch with the Weasleys that someone ends up injured – the field is just too small and the players too strong.
I can feel Draco hard against my belly and it makes my own cock twitch again. I lick his neck and Draco tilts his head back, giving me better access.
„I want to please you, Harry. I genuinely do. I just can't promise you that you'll be able to please me. I can't even please myself.“
„Thanks.“ She looks around the empty café. It's already past rush hour and there is only an old man hunched over at a table in the corner, face hidden by his newspaper. He's here every Wednesday and Friday, for at least three hours.
“No, it wasn't like that. He didn't fuck me,“ I say, keeping my voice low, throwing glances around. I hope everyone is wrapped up in their own conversations.
He reaches over the table and takes my hand. „Then thank you, Draco. This is wonderful. No one has ever done something like that for me.“
„It was bloody awful.“ There is this hard set to Ron's mouth that always appears when he's shocked to his core. „It was one of those gangs that – you know. Trafficking. It's basically slavery.“
Our first outing takes place during the third week of our new-old relationship. We're caught holding hands in a Muggle park. I'm not sure if we were trying or not, but I know we're both glad that it's out there now.
„You've been going on about how you hate your job for at least twenty minutes now,“ I say, leaning against the wall right next to the bars.
Draco snorts. Then he's silent. I don't know what he's thinking, because I don't look at him. Still.
He pulls me close and I push one of my legs between his and grope for my wand, summoning a blanket. Draco pulls it over both of us, his hands carding through my hair.
I turn around, wishing she wouldn't shout my name so loud in here, but also strangely glad she stopped me. I arch one brow at her.
A middle aged witch with laughter lines adorning her eyes and frizzy, grey streaked hair, smiles at me.
For a long time, it was the only thing that grounded me, that got me up in the mornings. Knowing I had Ginny and that she'd never leave me, I soldiered through Ron and Hermione's fights, Hermione's tears when her blindness dragged her under, Ron's drinking and cussing and tantrums.
We both pretend as if it wouldn't be a big deal, Draco going out with me. As if he'd be wearing his black turtleneck jumper every other day and not only walk around in sweats.
„I have tickets for the Cannons match on Saturday. It's going to be a bore, certainly, but I know nobody who'd actually want to see the Cannons fly, meaning I can't get rid of the tickets – I mean, who ever would? - so I was thinking, perhaps it'd be a good idea – well, a decent idea – if, you see, I don't go alone, because Pansy flaked on me for some bird she desperately needs to see naked, which I really don't think is very smart, since they are close friends, but -“
Hands clumsy from eagerness get jeans open. I help Draco yank his off. He wants to just pull them to his thighs, but I insist on taking them all off. He doesn't object.
Draco is in the kitchen, making coffee and probably checking his reflection at least three times in the chromed fridge, while I pad toward the door to my flat. A letter is lying on the ground – muggle. A deep frown is creasing my forehead. My heart is pounding hard.
„I'm not sure. I think it would make sense if those Ipos would have been invented as a doping method.“
I know he's working hard, even though I have no idea what job he might have. But whenever he is home, exhausted and frustrated, as it seems, I don't notice him leave his apartment.
“He's a pillock,“ Harry says, as if it was an undeniable truth, a certain fact of life. It makes me smile.
I skirt the table and lean down to press a kiss on Draco's hard lips. At first, they won't give in, but eventually, his mouth softens, and with a sigh, he allows me to part his lips with my tongue, slipping it inside.
„They aren't a hundred percent sure who it is yet, but everything points to Astoria Greengrass. Jade's daughter.“
I know the feeling, this sudden emptiness. I stroke a hand over his chest, then down his body, until I find his puffy, slick hole.
,“ I choke out as I watch Draco kissing my belly, then mouthing at my cock. He blinks up at me, smirking.
He's coming too fast, because I don't have it in me to tease him and I swallow everything, even though I know I shouldn't.
Cleaning up is a little awkward, but the feeling is almost completely drowning in the hurt cursing through my body.
He didn't come home last night. He didn't come home and I couldn't sleep, because I was waiting for his steps on the stairs.
He can feel Harry's sideways glance but chooses to ignore it. To cover his heating cheeks, he leans forward and takes a sip from his drink, his hair hiding his face from Harry.
I start shivering so violently that I can hardly keep upright. Harry takes my hand and pulls me out of the way, so not to block the entry any longer.
„As I said. I knew what she needed but somehow, I couldn't give it to her. Even though I really tried, but... not hard enough.“
„I'll see you soon,“ Sam tells her and they smile at each other. They always do. Pansy kisses her cheek and leaves the room, wondering how the hell she is supposed to be concentrating on brewing sleeping draught now.
The centerpiece is a cozy looking bed with green covers that seems to be calling to my tired limbs. A closet made out of light wood is set up on the right wall, a big window next to the bed.
His hands slip from my shoulder and around my waist. As he pulls me closer, our bodies flush, I moan.
Wild with want, I shove a hand into his pants. He groans when I cup his bulge. His pants are wet with precum.
Even if I wasn't what I am, there is still enough to ensure Harry can never be mine. It's a cliché that I hate, but in this case, it's true – he's too good for me.
I do, but I don't like it still. I fumble with an old quill on my desk. „So... do you know where he works, exactly?“
It's strange, lying on my stomach, on display for Malfoy of all people. I never thought I'd ever do something like this. I never thought I could yearn for it so much.
Hermione drags me over to Percy and I'm pretty lost. Percy isn't fluent in sign language at all and Hermione is only signing her own words for me, but not Percy's responses and doesn't even face me while doing it, so I really have no idea what's going on.
Nothing's up. I've just seen Parkinson in the Prophet this morning. Parkinson with her new shop everyone's gushing about and that's good for her, but bad for me. The urge to visit said shop... is barely resistable.
I give her one of my reassuring smiles. „I completely understand your concerns, but they're unfunded. I might be young, but I'm one of the best in the field when it comes to lycanthropy and related illnesses. You can trust me.“
Draco hesitates. „Not really. My father never confided me in his political doings. I overheard them fight once though.“
The friendly nurse looked at him. Harry can't remember his face, save for the red mark on his left nostril.
„Looking back, I think I started to wonder pretty early on. Like, when I was fourteen, maybe. But I didn't recognize those feelings for what they were back then. Then I got with Ginny and for a while, I really didn't think about it anymore. But when we broke up, I began questioning again and decided to just... you know, try it out. And I liked it. So, now,“ Harry shrugs and smiles wryly, „I've come to the conclusion that I really don't care about gender. I like both.“
I don't know what he's on about or what he wants me to say and I'm too tired to figure it out right now, so I just wrap my arms around my body and stay quiet, praying he'll leave me.
„I'll be fine,“ he says and wants nothing more than to leave the office. Maybe get some coffee and work on his new project.
Harry's eyes sparkle as I nod and push a cup of steaming tea into his direction. Before I lift my own, I roll my stiff neck.
I bend to kiss my mother's forehead, her skin cool and dry under my lips, then stride out of the room.
The smile she gives me couldn't fool anyone. She's half out of the door when I turn. Call after her.
He seems so gone already, kissing me with desperation. I turn my head slightly, giving him access to my throat.
I stare dumbly as she chooses a table pretty much in the middle of the room. She must be coming straight from work, judging by her formal jumpsuit and slightly messy hair.
„Yeah. I think that's the problem. Ron just wants – he just wants someone safe. Someone he knows will love him and put him first and say yes when he proposes.“
Blaise steps forward. „I asked him to. He's going to be the godfather. But if it bothers you, we can...“
My apartment is still a rather small one, but it's nicer than the old one was. I'm especially proud of the bathroom – it's clean and almost decadent with a bath tub and big shower.
He's standing next to her in the lab and she wonders how in the hell he's got time for a casual visit right now with all those criminals on the loose.
At first, I don't recognize the expression on Scorpius' face. It's one I don't think I have seen before.
„If it's not too inconvenient, I'd like to stay until Astoria sends a patronus. It would be better if my parents weren't still home when I bring Scorpius. Especially my mother doesn't handle his episodes well. She gets very scared.“
„You filthy Death Eater scum. I took you in, I took care of you, and you go let yourself get fucked by someone else...“
My heart is thundering in my chest. I'm not sure if I'm angry or frightened. If I'm pitying him or hating myself for coming.
Things are way, way better now than they were just two months ago, but their interactions still feel stilted, a little awkward. But I know I shouldn't complain. They're talking, they're making an effort. It's all I could ask for.
„Come on, Pansy.“ Hermione's gaze is affectionate as she slings an arm around Pansy's waist and escorts her to the door.
Burying a problem like this seems... not like you. I'm sure you'd have either wanted us all dead or reintegrated into society.
I want to tell him how stupid it is to say that – he can't protect me, no one can – but my body betrays me and relaxes. It feels like he can, even though I know it's a lie.
„She was my girfriend. I owed it to her. She was so busy with her career and she was always so up-front with me, you know,“ I say as if Lydia could possibly know that. She doesn't know me. „She made it clear what she expected and wanted out of a relationship and I failed her.“
„You don't. I'm just... You just think of me as attractive or something. Or maybe it's the old hatred that makes it hot for you. You don't really like me.“
The melting process in my chest proceeds and I wrap my arms around his neck, carding my hands through his soft, messy hair.
He is so gone, I almost can't help myself. I want to throw him over my shoulder and toss him on my bed and make him scream my name.
Despite his controlled, neutral face, I can tell that the topic agitates Malfoy. I wonder how often he's talked to Parkinson about it.
The pad of my finger presses against his entrance and white-hot desire shoots through me. I rub him gently until he stops clenching, until I can feel his tight hole flutter. Open for me.
I flip him off, but grab both of our cups, heading toward the door. They're disgusting. We really should exchange them for new ones more often.
„Maybe Draco's right. Maybe I am bad for him. His ex... I don't know the half of it, but I think he abused him. Physically and emotionally. He was... I think over-jealous. Called Draco a cheat.“
I almost forgot I asked him. Well, I didn't forget, but I didn't mention it again. I thought he had forgotten.
We didn't talk much about the report after we came home yesterday. I was exhausted and Harry sensed that I wasn't in the mood for questions and deep talk. Instead, we napped on the sofa, ate dinner with Weasley who showered me with
„Why him?“ Harry says bluntly. If no one else is going to speak up, he will. The last thing he wants to do is having to work with Malfoy. Even though Harry doesn't consider Malfoy his enemy anymore like he had in school (it seems so childish now), Malfoy is most definitely not his friend. Most importantly, Harry doesn't trust Malfoy. In any regard.
Harry sprints toward him and catches one of the wizards by surprise, stunning him. The other sends a dirty look Harry's way, before grabbing his companion's arm and vanishing.
I catch myself thinking about him at random times, almost like I used to in school. I shouldn't feel so warm whenever he touches me.
It's also brutal to work in the heat of July, even though London doesn't compare to Montpellier, obviously.
Except that I'll probably never get a chance to interview the Chosen One himself for my book again. It would have been stupid not to say yes. And yet, standing here – it does feel stupid.
I keep telling you that I'll leave as soon as I find some place to work that is not dark alleys. You say I'm welcome to stay as long as I need to.
Harry somehow wished the Slytherin would start fighting him again just to gain some normality back, but that didn't happen.
Mostly because I know I have to, I visit the Burrow. Molly is over the moon to have me there – but it's still not easy to meet her eye. Her face is marred with grief.
„Look who's finally here,“ Flint says, attention on Draco now. Harry wants to use his distraction, do something. But he doesn't know what.
„Come dance with me,“ I say, smiling. She doesn't need to be told twice and I follow her to the dancefloor.
He backs away just a little and I can tell he doesn't want to. But he raises his brows and his voice is earnest when he says: „If you don't want that, that's okay. I know you're not really one for casual...“
The look Ncuti throws me is somewhere between exasperated and pitiful. „Theoretically? Yes. But do you really believe in such a huge coincidence? Wizards don't throw knives into the river on a daily basis, Harry.“
Usually in this position, Harry tends to forget who the cock up his arse belongs to. Often enough, it didn't matter.
For all my carelessness earlier, I'm more than nervous as I follow Ron into his and Hermione's flat, him babbling on about Auror training.
„I'm not a complete moron, Harry. I know that it's a woman and I know you're not talking to me about it because Gin's my sister. But I want to know. I'm not gonna... get mad or anything.“ Ron frowns. „Unless you're cheating on her. Then I might kill you.“
But maybe I was wrong. Because right now, my blood is rushing south and I feel things I haven't felt in forever.
It takes me a second to realize he tried to disguise himself. The scar is glamoured, his hair brown instead of jet black. There also seems to be a glamour on his features to distract the eye, but that doesn't work on me.
„My shop is doing well enough that I can afford to not give a fuck about some stupid vandalists,“ she says unconcerned and I follow her inside.
I tell her about sleepovers and stealing her mum's makeup, about long nights and failed attempts at baking.
I take the kettle from the stove and pour tea into my favorite mug. After a moment of consideration, I add a splash of milk and a lot of sugar.
„Draco saved my life. And Teddy, even though... I'm still not quite sure if this has been the right decision.“
My eyes flicker to his face, then back to my tea. A faint groan and a door opening informs us that Weasley has joined the living – or maybe rather the inferi, since he needs an awful lot of time to fully wake up.
At first it was a little awkward. But only for a couple of minutes, then they just teased each other like they always did.
I just spent an hour begging for more while a fat john buggered me senseless, my left arm weirdly twisted so he could look at the Dark Mark while slamming into me.
Draco can't breathe, squirming in Harry's arms. He's above embarrassment now. Nothing matters anymore except for finally getting off.
„I'm not so sure about that. And anyway...“ I grab the menu from her table and smooth down my shirt. „It's not just that. We fought a lot and... it won't work, Pansy.“
He's hard, as always. His hands are running over my sides and I press myself against him, trying to signal he can go.
Harry just shakes his head and tries to brush my hair back, but ends up almost poking a finger into my eye.
When he feels Draco's lips on his entrance, he cries out. It's quiet, sort of aborted. A pathetic sound.
„She just stopped fighting.“ Draco looks at Harry now. „She didn't want to fight. I think she -“ He cuts himself off. Takes another swig.
„You will regret this one day, but I'm still glad you said it,“ he says, and that Breakable is in his voice, too.
sorry. It came off wrong. I didn't mean to be a jerk and I don't care about queer people. I mean, I'm tolerant. Whatever. I never cared about Dean and Seamus and they shared my dorm!“
Slowly, very slowly, my breathing normalizes and my heartbeat slows. It wasn't a bad one. I manage not to cry. I manage to inhale and force my muscles to relax.
„No.“ The answer comes too quickly. He lifts his brows at me. I shrug, face hot. „I like your teeth.“
“Anything you want. For real,“ I add as he gives me one of his suspicious looks. “I've done it all and I'm perfectly fine giving you whatever you want right now. You can fuck me.“
„Harry,“ I say. It's strange, hearing my own voice in the quiet room. Unbidden, memories from years ago press forward, demanding my attention. I've said his given name before, in quiet rooms where no one could hear me. It was usually either on a breathy exhale or a shout.
„But I can't trust you anymore. You say we got it wrong, that you're not responsible for Runcorn's death. But you confessed before. I don't know what to think and, honestly, I don't even want to think about it at all anymore.“
Harry's features harden. „Maybe I should apologize for that. But I didn't feel like you hadn't enjoyed it.“
I rinse my mouth, not quite able to banish the tard, sour taste, then open the door and almost knock Potter over.
They kiss, messily and Draco can feel how hard Harry is through his denims. It's heady and surreal that Draco's the one who made that happen.
I pull him closer, inviting him to settle between my thighs, but he leans back on his elbows, pulling me with him until I'm on top.
But I also don't want it to end. I'd be content to slowmotion-fuck him against this dirty door for hours.
I'm pushed on the bed, stripped with greedy hands. Teeth are scraping my collarbone. My hips are grabbed. I'm flipped on my belly.
Zabini is staring at Malfoy with a strange expression. It's almost like he'd be surprised at Malfoy's outburst.
I get Malfoy's (or should I maybe say George's) Dreamscales the same night I'm going out on my first field mission. It's a small one, not even really a case and more to get us used to operating under cover and dealing with real people, not the actors they usually get us to interrogate.
I know with a groundbreaking, gut-turning certainty, that I'd do almost everything for this man. I'd kill for him, die for him. Hurt for him.
„I wanted to ask you, Mrs. Tonks,“ I say. I don't think I'll ever get used to the fact that she doesn't see herself as a Black. She looks so much like one. „About Teddy's dad. Remus Lupin. Or, more specifically, about...“
This question is an easy one. It's obvious which answer he wants to hear. It also happens to be the truth, which is rare.
He sucks bruises into the golden skin of Harry's throat. Draco had always had a thing for that, but Derek wasn't really into it. Harry is, judging by how he bares his throat and grips Draco even tighter. His hands come up and he pulls the tie from Draco's hair so that it falls around his face while they're kissing.
Knowing this poor looking boy was actually Harry Potter (the Harry Potter, The-Boy-Who-Lived) should have changed things for Draco, but it didn't. He still wanted to be friends with him.
It takes me ages to find a book that really sheds a light on veela themselves and not one hundred and one reasons why they shouldn't be integrated into society.
I nod, suddenly aware that I'm still holding that stupid glass of champagne. „Yes. I thought it was about time someone threw a party for you. I, ah, wanted to surprise you.“
There is one question burning on Harry's tongue above anything else and he stares at Derek, trying to find answers in his face.
I smile at him. Every time I look at him, I can't think of anything else but kissing him again. But I think I'm waiting for him to make the move.
Draco gives him one of those smiles that he doesn't want to show, but can't help to. What Harry sees in his eyes... it makes the tension in his chest break.
„Fuck, Drake.“ A sigh. Gentle hands in my hair. Rough asphalt under my knees. „It's okay, love. I've got you. I'm here.“
I keep running useless tests. They all tell me the same thing – Teddy is perfectly healthy, except for this ominous thing damaging his magical core. This tension that shouldn't be there.
Busy with her grandson, she hardly notices Potter leaving. I dash after him and catch his wrist at the foot of the stairs.
„Maybe,“ Sam says, clearly not convinced. „But I just can't imagine that Terry will be interested in a relationship. And then he'll break Otis' heart.“
When he pulls out, I flop down, still catching my breath, floating. Malfoy lies down next to me and I think I might be able to feel his hammering heart from afar.
„You know I love Harry, but when he's in a bad mood, it brings everyone else down as well. Please tell Draco to cheer him up with a good shag or something.“
He swallows thickly. For the first time, I recognize that particular look in his silver eyes for what is: Fear.
Harry blinks at me, setting the plate down. I have his full attention now and kind of wished I hadn't.
When he starts fucking me, the burn slowly transforms into something like molten lava – sweet, thick, liquid desire pulsing through my body, making my thighs tremble.
It wasn't like it was any easier to be around his family. Draco couldn't stand to see his father's face anymore and he couldn't bear to hear his mother cry.
Harry clearly seems to enjoy himself and the noises he makes are so fucking hot that Draco wonders if it's possible to come just from that. Harry's hand is tangled in Draco's hair, not pulling though and it only spurs Draco on to take him deeper, not caring that his jaw hurts.
It's Sunday and she had the whole day off. I can't remember the last time we've spent such a relaxed day together.
Malfoy is wearing pajamas, striped pajamas, bare feet and tousled hair. My mouth is dry and I can only stare for a moment.
Draco charges at Derek and Harry jumps to help him. A curse shoots out of Derek's wand, but Draco bends his hand away from them. Harry gives into the urge and lands one right in Derek's face, sending the man to the ground.
I don't look at their bodies for too long. It always makes me feel a ton of different things and most of them aren't pleasant.
When I come inside him, I do so with a loud, guttural groan that I'm ashamed of. Slowly, I pull out, watching my cum trickling down Harry's thighs.
He doesn't find it funny how Draco is taking his office apart with his eyes. He probably should have cleaned up a bit, but there's never time. Plus Harry
Everyone is dead silent, Malfoy and Harry staring at each other. Harry doesn't notice that his empty coffee cup is shaking until Sam grabs it and holds it still.
Harry lets him push him on his back and spreads his legs. He'd do anything to make this better for Draco.
Since I'm not teaching at a school, but private courses at home for Auror Trainees and homeschooled kids, holidays for me aren't as set as they are for most teachers, but break has now officially begun for me, too. It will end in July already, but that's fine with me.
Whenever someone calls me a whore, they're right. It's not something I'm proud of. Not something I like about myself.
I squelch any ill-placed disappointment and lead him into the living room. He looks at Pansy, who stares back in a manner that can't be described at anything else but hostile.
If I had known I'd run into one of Draco's Slytherin buddies, I would have come up with a whole cover-story, containing shared hobbies and favourites and well thought-out family history.
Draco presses another kiss to my cheek, puts my hand on his waist. „I think I'm in love with you,“ he says and I'm hit by lightening.
I thought that I was done making the wrong choices. In fact, for a long time, I felt like I sacrified my whole life for making the right choices. And then, it gave me Scorpius and for the first time, I felt happy. Like it was all worth it.
Adrian Rogers is standing not that far from Harry and Draco, talking to a woman. They're standing really close and Draco nudges Harry.
„I'm sorry for grilling you like this,“ she says when the corners of Draco's mouth are starting to point downwards. „It must be difficult for you, knowing Connor is free again.“
„What is it, Pans?“ Blaise asks before Draco can, crossing his legs elegantly and sipping on his drink.
When the girl comes over to me, I almost stop breathing. I can see her lips moving, but my anxiety muddles my brain and I can't read them.
„Yeah,“ Harry says and I know he's thinking the same thing. „That sounds... sensible. So, maybe we could hang out next week? Just get some coffee. I have a lot of new students and a couple hilarious stories,“ he says and my smile widens.
„Oh, stop looking at me like that. It's not weird. We're coworkers. It would be weird to have break at the same time and
Next to him are sitting two teenagers – a girl around thirteen with some weird red mark on her cheek and a boy about two years older, gangly and lanky.
She pushes her hand toward me. When I take it, her fingers are having trouble closing around mine. But not as much as just a few hours ago.
The Ministry for Magic is buzzing with witches and wizards coming in, the Atrium almost overflowing. Every single floo supplies a never-ending stream of people stumbling into the building, most of them looking slightly disoriented for a moment, despite having done it hundreds of times before.
“We'll be there in a sec,“ Ron says and never have I ever heard him speak in such a manner to Draco. Whatever his opinion on the Slytherin might be, right now, all
I let him sleep until way in the afternoon. Only when my eyes are burning and I have a hard time focussing on the letters, I quietly store away my papers and get up, skirting the table until I'm standing next to Potter.
Draco so soft... it's hard to handle. For me. It's hard to handle having him looking at me like that.
Flint gives me an unimpressed look. „A punishment fuck, I guess. I've spent some days in a bloody cell because of your scrawny arse.“
His own signing has become more fluent, quicker and more confident. I feel clumsy and ignorant next to him with my fumbling fingers.
„Oh Merlin, I love you, Harry. I love you I love you I love you.“ He can't stop saying it. I can't stop moaning.
Speaking of exes – Draco shivers just thinking of Derek. Everytime he's alone in the streets, he keeps looking over his shoulder.
Nothing about my dreams about the Dursleys is easy. I hardly ever understand what's even going on, but I wake up puking my guts out every time without fail. I don't know why.
Some people stared at them, they couldn't believe that they got along. It was uncomfortable, because it reminded Draco who he was.
Green eyes are suddenly finding mine. I can't bear looking at them, so I close my eyes and pretend I don't exist. I excel in that discipline, so it doesn't take me much at all.
„You do realize why though, right? No one can be that thick. Not even you,“ is what I end up saying.
„I don't understand,“ Pansy says when Draco firsts tells her about his „relationship“ (or whatever it is) with Harry. „So you're snogging. But you don't fuck. At all?“
I raise my eyebrows, but join him nonetheless, displaying myself like I usually would, feeling like scum. Like trash.
Ginny and Luna leave after dinner, but the rest of our guest sticks around for much longer. Only when Neville can't seem to stop yawning, eyelids dropping, Hannah and he get going too.
“If you guys really want me to,“ I finally allow myself to say. The last thing I want is for them to drag me along under the perogative of ther Gryffindor heroicness.
It takes a while of awkward fumbling and awkward questions until I realize that we won't be shagging tonight, either.
Then, I can't resist. „And what about yourself? Already determined whether you play for the other team?“
„It's okay if you need time. I'm sorry for dropping it all on you like that, but I just – I needed you to know it. And tonight, I want you to have fun.“
She has her wand drawn and at my throat, her eyes blazing. „Don't, Draco. I swear to Salazar, if you keep up this facade, I will hex you.“
„Harry. I can't stand thinking you'll beat yourself up because of me. I don't want you to... put blame on yourself that isn't yours. So, please. Promise me.“
„You don't see yourself very clearly, Draco. I know you think you're not good enough for Potter, but, really, you're worth three of him. You're smart and witty and absolutely gorgeous.“
She is here sooner than I had anticipated, hair a mess, clearly thrown on the first clothes she got her hands on.
„I'll pretend to not have heard that,“ I murmur, impressed with myself for being able to form sentences again already.
„No, but they're all not dealing very well with strangers. And they could frighten the younger kids. But mostly, I don't want your older students to make fun of them.“
I stare up at him, breath caught in my throat as he rolls us over, hovering over me. I'm so hard, it hurts.
I had turned on my stomach, arms crossed, cocking my head at her. „Why would I hang at your house if Potter was your husband?“
My world narrows only to the Slytherin standing before me. Our eyes lock and it's like we've never been apart.
I've never fucked a man before and, even though he did tell me that he has bottomed before, I don't think Draco does it often. He tells me what to do, but his voice is shaking while he does.
I think the moment he said it, he feels like it sounded arrogant, conceded, because he's blushing, scraping one of his sneakers over the floor.
As I said, I'm not an expert when it comes to blow jobs. I rarely deep throat, because my gag reflex is pretty strong and the whole ordeal usually feels like a chore to me.
The first time I go looking for him and he's not at his usual spot, I'm not too worried. The second time, I feel a bit uneasy.
At the same time, I see the little boy that sat on my lap and didn't want to fall asleep unless his mom was in the room with him, so clearly, it has tears prickling in me eyes.
No one really knows whether Pansy and Hermione are official or not, but everyone who sees them together know that they have something. Something special that doesn't necessarily need labels. I think it might be exactly what Hermione was looking for; what she couldn't have with Ron.
I try again. Nothing changes, except that I'm now actuely aware of Malfoy behind me, looking over my shoulder. It makes me nervous.
Neville is blushing and Parvati rolls her eyes. „I'm not going to admit anything. When will you finally let it go, Georgie?“
„Not like this. Please?“ Draco's looking up at Harry, anxiety coming off of him in waves, he knows that and he knows he's ruining the mood again and he doesn't want to, but he can't help it.
When I make it into the kitchen, Ron and Hermione are waiting for me there. Also, there's coffee and water, which is really all I want right now. I'm parched.
Draco trails off. He's not sure whether he should really say this. Sometimes he doesn't know what's offensive and what isn't. This might be risky. He doesn't want Harry to get angry at him.
I'm still not a hundred percent sure what exactly he meant by that, but I give my best to give him said solidity.
I bite my lip and look at Draco, who obviously still hasn't completely recovered from his brief outburst of snark.
A bucket of ice water has just been dropped into my stomach. My heart is racing and my fingers are itching to draw my wand. Just to regain some sense of control.
Jenna grins, even though she's trying to bite it back. Of course my students were all too scared to appear dumb to ask me about this.
Parkinson steps aside and follows me as I drop Draco as gently as possible on the bed of the one room flat.
Draco is sitting at the long table, all alone, a glass of white wine in front of him, an empty plate pushed away. He's brooding over a thick book, pale hair falling over his eyes. I stare at him, mesmerized by his effortless grace.
Hermione is helping Pansy looking for a new job, which apparently requires a lot of late-night meetings. And sleepovers. And breakfasts.
„You're a natural,“ the guy he'd given his first blowjob to had told him and even Derek had repeatedly voiced how good Draco was at this. And Derek didn't tell Draco that he was good at anything very often.
I only told her because I felt like she should know about that as my girlfriend, that she even had the right to. But she seemed to think I was telling her because I wanted to experiment.
George opens his mouth to answer, when I spot not only one, but two familiar faces. Ron had lingered at Fortescue's, talking to Seamus, while I was already on my way to Flurish and Blott's. Now he seems to have caught up to me.
She shakes her head. „No. You go home and on the way, you grab some flowers. Then you'll start cooking or do whatever romantic gesture you can think of. When Harry gets back here, I'll tell him to go home. You'll surprise him and kiss him and tell him what a great boyfriend he is.“
Sometimes I worry she keeps herself awake with the attempt to wait for me, but there is not much I can do about it.
Hermoine sighs. „Do you really think this is any of your business? Even if Malfoy were – are you that close now?“
„A little more thouroughly,“ I tell him when he got there and he complies, finger-fucking me until I'm afraid I might come from this alone.
„Of course, it won't get the Ipos off the market immediately, but give it two or three weeks and it'll be over.“
Draco does intend to change that, but for now, being a good little minion might be the best approach.
„It's okay. We don't have to do it again. I'm so sorry.“ His eyes are searching Draco's face and his fingers around Draco's hand are tight.
I have a boyfriend now and Harry isn't good for me. It would be so much smarter to just keep avoiding him. Certainly not spending any time with him alone, because that, I apparently can't handle very well.
„Can't really blame them,“ Weasley says. „The people coming at you, I mean. I thought Harry had been hexed at first, too.“
„Hey, handsome, what -“ The words die in my throat when I see who it is. Without thinking twice, I turn and try to open the door, get out again. But it's locked.
Draco stares into my eyes, panting already. „Harry,“ he whispers and then he's kissing me and it makes me forget that this isn't like the last times we've had sex.
„I'm sure the Savior doesn't need to ask me for flirting tips,“ he signs, movements clipped. Almost angry.
He brings his mouth close to mine again, so that I can feel his breath. Gently, he takes my bottom lip between his teeth, pulling just a little.
The admission hurts. I can't remember the last time I had to explain that to someone. People usually know and if they don't, they don't care.
Harry pulls me inside, somehow kicking the door shut before crowding in, pushing me up against it, hot kisses moving from my mouth to my neck. I'm moaning already, fingers digging into his back.
„They're always like this,“ Potter says, startling Draco. There is an empty chair between them and still, he feels awfully close.
„Sit,“ Archer says to Malfoy. Terry, always a sweetheart, smiles at him briefly and then scoots over so Malfoy can sit next to Zabini. The dark Slytherin is still trying to catch the blond one's gaze, but Malfoy just shakes his head slightly, jaw set.
I let him lead me into the kitchen. I sit down at his table and mock the old furniture while he heats up pasta for me. We eat lasagna together and he asks me if I'm cold and I tell him to fuck off.
„Because Blaise knew that you wouldn't have accepted it. He also knew that, back then, I'd rather have died than for you to know what Derek did to me.“
I know that Potter is a sucker for cuddling and physical affection in general, but I don't give it to him, because we're not fucking, this time. We're not lovers. I will not pet his hair.
„Yes. Nymphadora was the same around that age. Only she could already morph her nose, too. She did it often to amuse me.“
Not knowing what to say, Harry stays quiet. Draco inclines his head. Harry notices that his shirt is buttoned askew.
I spend the day at the hospital with Hermione. We don't talk very much. Mostly just drink coffee at Pansy's bed. From time to time, I'll talk to Pansy, tell her a story.
Part of me doesn't want to tell him. But I'm not an asshole and certainly not a liar. „Pretty good. I'm spending more time with old friends again and I've been dating someone for a couple months.“
But Robards won't grant me a break, so I'm sitting in his office once again – next to a handcuffed Malfoy, this time.
Ron flinches as he burns his lips on the hot coffee. I close my hands tighter around my own cup, relishing the feeling of my skin melting.
Draco carefully pulls out, his hand petting my thigh. My eyes follow his every move. Scared he'll leave now.
He pushes the blond against the wall, taking some weight off Harry and they kiss for what feels like forever and Harry feels like he could just keep doing this. There's no real need for more.
„I think... I've always known. From when I first started to think about, you know, sex and all that. But I didn't want to admit it, even to myself. I've spent a lot of time praying the gay away, I'd say.“
I wandlessly slick my fingers and slip them behind his balls, further back. He's tense, but doesn't push away.
„But, really – Draco ended a whole relationship because the guy he was with preferred taking it up the arse, too,“ Pansy says.
I wait for half an hour, until I can't bear the cold anymore. Slowly, I creep out of my hiding place.
As Harry had already suspected, one of the two men pointing their wands at him is Derek Connor. He seems a little paler than the last time their paths had crossed, but otherwise, it's the same man.
We reach the floos and with every step we take, my worry grows. Accompanied by confusion and a touch of anger.
Hermione moves in with him. He doesn't see her all that often because she's so busy, but two or three times a week, they'll have dinner together. Usually, Harry cooks. When they order takeaway, Hermione pays.
While she is shifting her weight, I'm momentarily distracted by her gorgeous dress and makeup. She's wearing a golden, glittery short dress, showing off strong and shapely legs I really didn't know she had. Her eyes are smokey, almost like mine, just more dramatic.
If stares could kill, Zabini would be dead. Harry can't help but be curious what part about his love life has Malfoy so embarassed.
I don't have the energy to fight him on this, so I let myself be led into the bedroom, toeing off my shoes. The big bed is calling for me. I'm so exhausted, I can't even be bothered to worry about how it might seem to climb in bed in front of Harry. Honestly, if a shag is the price of a couple hours of undisturbed sleep, I'll take it.
I don't know how to respond. I'm not sure if he's saying that to somehow hurt me or if he is actually drunk enough to wind up in my flat by accident.
“And you need to understand when someone doesn't need your saving. I don't need you to be my hero. So just let me go.“
„Your father got the kiss.“ He doesn't say he's sorry. If he did, I'd have jumped up and clawed at him through the bars. Maybe I would have gotten a scratch in before he'd knocked me out.
I hesitate. I want to live with you. I basically already do. But I can't help but think of the last time I've lived here with you. I was hurting and battered and unable to touch you.
„Harry James Potter, you're not like Derek. Not one bit, do you hear me? Derek is badly damaged from what, I can't know, and he's hurtful and sadistic. He might have loved Draco in his own, twisted way, but he doesn't know what it feels like to truly love. You do, Harry. You're the most loving person I know.“
I think he's more nervous than I am when he settles between my thighs. I pull my legs up, hooking one over his shoulder. I wait for him to line up, a little frown of concentration on his face as he looks down, trying to get the angle right. I want to eat up his whole face just because of this little frown.
I know that. Many have told me before, like it's something amazing. I'm not so sure. All I know is that it makes sex more painful, which isn't really necessary, since anal sex easily turns painful without the right amount of preparation.
It's been a while since I've had a shower this good. I decide to seize the opportunity and clean myself properly. Most clients like that better.
Malfoy bristles. „That's ridiculous. Do you have any idea how many Aurors are found every night in Knockturn Alley, paying some two-knut hooker to shoot their load into?“
He's sitting hunched over, folded into a corner. His head is hanging down, blond, messy hair covering his face.
„It's over.“ Draco's own voice is rough. „I can't do casual with Harry. And it doesn't matter anymore anyway.“
He doesn't want to hear Draco tell him that Harry's crazy, that they were never friends. That Draco hasn't thought of him once in all this time.
Draco looks down on himself, apparently only now noticing the disastrous state of his clearly expensive suit. „I'll clean them later. No damage done.“
Now, in Blaise's flat, Draco's legs suddenly can't carry his weight anymore. His friend prevents him from falling by wrapping an arm around his waist.
He has a scar now, a pretty ugly, angry scar stretching from the left side of his jaw down over his neck, disappearing into his collar.
„Help me with the dishes,“ she said. Harry didn't mind. At home, he often had to do the dishes by himself. That's where the scar on his thumb stam from – a knife that slipped through his fingers and cut him open. Aunt Petunia was scared by how much it bled.
Harry can't really argue. He himself isn't really one for spilling his guts all the time. Draco sighs and averts his gaze, but doesn't back away.
I take another swig from my coffee, then put it down and hop on the counter. Harry shuffles to the side to make room for me, but I catch his shoulder and arrange him between my knees.
One more look at him and I have to stop fooling myself. There is definitely something feminine about Draco, but he's undeniably a guy. A guy with long legs and gray eyes and someone help, what the hell is wrong with me?
Instead of nodding, insulting one or the other item in his office and then leaving, Draco crowds in closer. His free hand lands on Harry's hip.
Ron gets home rather late, but Draco and I are still on the sofa together, him reading, me flipping through various job offers. I'll have to consult Hermoine on this. I'm sure she'll be have better advise to offer than any of those dusty books I bought on the subject.
It's hard for Pansy, so very hard to admit that she simply can't stay away. She just can't. The pull is too strong to resist.
My knee leans against his. He presses his leg against mine, hip to ankle. I pretend my heart isn't pounding faster.
„Is it true that you've fancied Hermoine?“ Harry asks Zabini, the liquor making him bold in his desperate attempt to distract from his own fixation on the blond boy next to him.
She wasn't really cut out to be a mother to begin with and that is not a bad thing, in itself – but it is if you only realize it after already having kids.
„I'm fine,“ I sign and she steps closer. Sits next to me on the bed. I can smell her – familiar and earthy.
„Not really, I'm afraid. After Blaise was hit, it was over. Terry was hardly able to stand and I had to get him out of there and... we let them escape.“
I don't tell him how much I'd love to fuck him. I don't want to scare him away. And, afterall, it's not like that would be something I need. I'd be fine either way, I'm sure.
At some point, Harry leans against my shoulder, but I don't think he's reading the lines before I say them. At a later point, he tentatively puts his head on my shoulder. At a point when my voice is already starting to grow hoarse, I put an arm around him and start petting his hair.
I smile as I sink to my knees and pick him up. He lets out a sound of protest as my dead hands touch his body. „And you're cold.“
Before Harry follows, he throws another look around – just in time to watch Sam and Terry spin into darkness, Sam's hair like a raven's wing in the storm.
But third time's the charm, because I find myself in a soft armchair, heart hammering, palms sweaty. My therapist is a black middle-aged witch, wearing a chic, but plain purple dress and kitten heels, huge glasses. Her hands are folded in her lap and while her smile is warm, it makes me nervous all the same.
Harry shakes his head at this impossible Slytherin, then his hands come up to Draco's waist, pulling him close as he kisses him again, more fiercely this time. Draco rests his hands on Harry's chest.
I have no idea how he does it, but suddenly, Potter is everywhere. He seems to always be leaving the house when I come home and I've gotten used to glaring daggers into his back. He's still ignoring me. I've hissed his name twice more and he consequently acts like I wouldn't exist. I have yet to look him in the eyes.
Part of me still hopes that one day, I might be able to work as an author fulltime. Having my book published has easily been the best and proudest moment of my life and I yearn for experiencing it again.
Basically, he pretends that Draco Malfoy has not gotten into his head and made himself comfortable there. It's good that they get along a little better than they used to, Harry thinks as he's shedding his clothes and changes into sweatpants and a faded tee.
„Harry came on to me and I can prove it by giving them my memories, if I have to. I think I actually told him how dangerous it was. And he didn't care.“
We've reached the end of part one of the Choices Series... I hope you liked it! Thanks to everyone who took the time to comment. There really is nothing more encouraging than to see readers invested in what happens to the characters.
Potter is staring at me with those green eyes that I still dream of sometimes, dazed and shocked and... relieved? Astonished? It's hard to tell.
Draco seems genuinely worried when she announces she'll be home all evening, all night and all morning.
Hermione looks at me, puts a hand to my arm. „Harry, have you met anyone new lately? Or someone you haven't seen in a while?“
It's useless. The moment Draco walks in, I'm gone. He's wearing simple jeans, not that tight, and a purple jumper. His hair is open, silky and I want to bury my hands in it.
I can tell that the name doesn't roll off her tongue easily, but the fact that she uses my given name at all surprises me.
Anticipation and dread is buzzing in my veins, but I push it all down and away. Tonight, I'll make Harry happy. I'll finally give him what he wants and I'll be
Without warning, Derek's hand jerks forward, but before it can close around Draco's wrist, Draco has raised his wand, pointing it at Derek's chest. The other man stills, watching Draco with astonishment in his eyes.
The Prophet on the other hand usually knows much more than it should. But it doesn't seem to know anything about the Malfoy heir. I might have shown up at the editorial department and grilled them.
Without realizing it, Harry is relaxing against the soft cushions of the sofa and Sam's warm shoulder, talking animatedly about his failures in Divination. Terry says that once, Trelawny told him he was going to marry a highborn Veela that would eventually murder him in his sleep with a golden necklace, which has everyone choking on their drinks.
Pansy just left and I'm reading when Harry enters the flat, dropping his bag and coat to the floor. He finds me on the sofa and while he does smile when he sees me, it's obvious that something is bugging him.
Then... Draco always wants to say he doesn't know from what point on things went downhill, but if he's honest, he thinks he does.
I decide to let it go for tonight, think about something else before my brain goes to mush. I could have a glass of wine and some good chocolate, maybe. Alone.
„Alright, alright. I mean, I do understand you,“ she says, a reverent expression clouding her face. „Blaise really is a sex god.“
We kiss until the heat is too much to bear. He drags me to the sofa and we crash there in a tangle of limbs, almost rolling off it. Laughing together.
My friends, who all know me so well, can see through it, even though Ron has already complained that it hurts his eyes.
Draco shrinks when Harry fixes him with a deep frown. „I'm not sure why you're so very confident that I don't hate you all of a sudden. But you should leave.“
“Merlin's balls, Ferret. I'm not sixteen anymore. I have plenty better to do than sell your arse out. You seem to do just fine in that regard on your own.“
Afterall, Derek had always meant trouble and if there is one thing he doesn't seem capable of, it is letting go of Draco.
„Look, I'm sorry if I was being nosy. You're right, I'm probably not someone you'd talk to about your relationship,“ Potter says.
I haven't slept for thirty-six hours and I think I'm losing my mind. I'm tossing and turning, the damp covers clinging to my legs. My head throbs faintly and my eyes are filled with sand that just won't go away. Whenever I rub them, I just drive it in deeper.
She still wants to go through with the divorce and I can't blame her for that, either, even though I wish she would have waited a little longer, so Scorpius could get settled a little more.
I nod slowly. Of course he does. My question was how exactly, but I'm sure he'll get to it soon enough.
I've never been to Knockturn Alley that late at night and I already know that I wouldn't come back without a good reason to.
“I'm working at St.Mungo's,“ she says. “Speaking of which,“ she turns to Ron, a slight frown on her face. “I was meaning to tell you earlier, but somehow, it always got away from me. One of your colleagues, Dawson's brother, keeps lurking around the building. Mostly on the third ward. If he's got important business to go about, that's fine with me, but there's something creepy about him. Is he shadowing someone? Because otherwise, I really don't understand why he'd be spending so much time there.“
“I understand if you don't care about my words, but I... beg you not to tell your colleagues or friends about my profession. Or where to find me. It would almost certainly mean the end of me and my mother needs me. She doesn't have anyone else.“
I look at my coffee, blowing on it, then wrapping my hands around the cup. „We've always had elaborate parties at the Manor. It was... quite fantastical. If you're a child and don't know what things the adults are talking about over firewhiskey and ciggars, at least.“
Potter slows his steps and frowns at me. His eyes are narrowed. „Being a werewolf doesn't make someone a beast, Malfoy. It's the human that does.“
Draco thinks about it for a moment. He's not sure, really. He's used to Derek setting the pace and just following his lead and Derek had always wanted to get into it pretty quickly. No pun intended.
The first look tells me the terrible truth, but I refuse to believe it. I have to grab the bag, have to shove my hand inside, have to turn it and shake it and then whimper, high, choked off sounds, until I finally face the fact that I've been cheated.
I've been a coward, once again, hiding and squeezing my eyes shut until someone broke in and dragged me out of my little hideaway, forcing me into the unforgiving light.
But there is no wasting time with Hermione Granger. When Ron comes back as well, I'm fighting a losing battle.
Our eyes lock and I think maybe, with the head through the wall might be best here. It's how Potter operates, afterall.
I miss you whenever you're not with me. When I see you laughing with someone else, I'm so jealous that my insides clench.
He is so tired, he just wants to rest his head on the table and sleep in the office. He would, if there were no one around.
“I just really thought she'd be it, you know? It's always been her. All this time. All my life, really.“
I'm late to the Leaky, because I'm rushing there from St. Mungo's and I'm so tired that I kept falling asleep on the bus and then missed my station. At least it's not snowing today. The sun shines bright and the air is so cold it cuts, but clear and fresh. I remember that I used to love these kind of winter days.
„Oh, I'm fine. Have you tried this new brand of ink? It doesn't fade as quickly. I find it really helpful.“
„Yeah, we're totally winning at life,“ I say – the first thing I can come up with to ease the tension.
I can feel his cock stiffen even further and his eyes take on a predatory look that immediately makes me want to come.
Hermione smiles and gets up from her desk, fingertips never leaving the smooth, wooden surface as she skirts it to come hug me.
He's not alone. A man that seems a few years older than us is holding his hand, smiling down at Draco. He's tall and handsome with a stubble and crisp shirt.
St. Mungo's is already wide awake when Harry and Ron arrive, both panting, adrenalin still pumping through their bodies.
„Hey,“ I say, feeling at a loss. I don't know what to say. I don't know if I should peel Harry's hands off his face.
„He is stable. I'm optimistic that he'll be able to leave during the day, but for now, he's sleeping. You can visit him, if you like, just be quiet,“ he tells them.
Ginny and Luna arrive during the third round. Probably another late practice. Ginny has a lot of those since she got the spot with the Harpies.
„I hope you don't expect all of our vacations to be that fancy,“ Harry says, gaze wandering over the thick carpets and dimmed lamps of the suite I rented for the night.
I've been back here for two weeks now and I haven't slept through one night without dreaming of Harry.
I make this pathetic noise against him, but it's quickly swallowed by his sweet moans. He pulls on my bottom lip and then he allows me to claim his mouth.
Green eyes blink up at me and I do come. Into his mouth. Some of it is trickling over his chin and the sight makes it under the top five of my favourite ones.
It's heavenly to feel clean again. I don't want to leave the bath tub. The water is greyish-red now. When I make myself get up, I notice something sticky between my thighs. I'm still bleeding.
After not dying in your bathroom, I slink downstairs. You're sitting on a ratty couch, looking at me as I walk in.
Impulsively, Draco sits up straighter and leans over, plugging the files from Harry's hands and then taking his glasses off for him. The Gryffindor blinks at him, then smiles when Draco climbs on his lap.
In broad daylight, Knockturn feels like a sad, forgotten place, roamed by sad, forgotten creatures. At night though, there is something dangerous in the glint of stranger's eyes, like every window would hide another secret.
We kiss until we have to come up for air. I feel dizzy and turned-on and still a little as if I'd be coming down with something.
Malfoy's lips press together. Hastily, I add: „I can pay you for it. I mean, I get that you don't usually just give it up for free.“
We're not the Golden Trio anymore. I've always hated that title, but now – I feel like it was quite accurate. What we had was special.
„Things like that stick with you though,“ Harry says and Draco looks at him, a lump forming in his throat.
I pull back and give him a friendly pat on the back. He turns around and for a moment, he's standing between my knees, looking up at me and my heartbeat is kicking at the sight of his green eyes.
It probably wouldn't change all that much. And it's not like I could tell them, anyway. That's Harry's story, not mine.
He also doesn't intend to let some john fuck me into an early grave, but I don't think I'm that close to death yet. At least ten more johns or so would have to make an effort, I think.
I kind of gape at her. „Um... I wouldn't really call it a decision. I mean, I just... really wanted to, I guess.“
I wake up with a warm, heavy weight on m chest. Irriated and strangely happy, I blink my eyes open. My hands are carding through soft, messy hair. Harry.
Well, okay. Maybe not – maybe it's okay to find it a little strange. Afterall, it's so foreign, isn't it?
I watch the rise and fall of his chest. His hair is covering half of his face, one single strand moved by his small puffs of breath.
„If you tell me this is a mistake again, then I will hex you,“ Draco says. His fingers weave through Harry's hair.
I run a hand through my hair. „She's bitter, but I don't think she killed anyone. But I wouldn't swear by it either.“
Draco's throat is tight now and he lets his arms slip away. This feeling of rejection is a familiar one and it still gets to him, makes him feel so small.
In general, the list of people I love is very short. I love my parents – my father because I can't help it (and I hate him at the same time), my mother because for all her flaws, I've never once doubted her love for me. And I love Pansy.
Sometimes, when I look at the destroyed patch of skin on my arm, I think of Fiendfyre. I think of the heat and the sweat and the panic. I think of hands clawing at my shirt, so afraid I might let go.
I will never forget the fear I've felt in that moment. It was the only time in my life that I really, truly thought I was about to die.
I feel like I'm about to burst, but when Mrs. Weasley personally fills my plate with a slice of treacle tart, I force myself to eat up.
I get a piercing stare. „No money for a grand celebration. And without the luxury, where's the fun in it?“
Draining my coffee, I get up and gather my papers, while the barista returns to the counter. Part of me would rather stay, maybe work on some of my private projects or just read a book and enjoy a sandwich and a flat white. But I have work to do.
“Mrs. Malfoy is in St. Mungo's. It's... not looking good,“ Parker fills me in, his gaze sweeping over the unmoving Slytherin in front of him.
She blinks, apparently not quite believing it's actually me. I flush a bright red, but can't stop staring at her.
„I'm okay. It's not like they wouldn't love each other. It's just hard for Albus, seeing his brother go to school and make so many friends, and – well, perform magic.“
If it was up to me, I'd move in with Draco on the spot. But, of course, we don't do that. It's never good to rush things and the last thing I want is to stupidly fuck this up.
It doesn't prevent them from putting a restraining order on him. It doesn't prevent them from giving him a fine that I know he can't pay.
„But I just don't know what I could do,“ I sign, looking at the chopped carrots rather than Hermoine.
Tom limps back to the man's table and sets a butterbeer down in front of him. The man only nods, doesn't speak again. I can see his hand for a quick moment, but it's too brief to notice details. It's a bloke's hand. That's all I can say about it.
„Why are you still calling her Samantha when you two are sleeping together?“ she asks, not looking at Blaise.
„Nothing! Just that me being concerned you might not be serious, especially after dropping those shit statements, is valid!“
I spin around so fast, I think my neck cracks. She gives me a stare, defiant and so emotional that it makes me uncomfortable.
Only when he pickes up the shards by hand and throws them in the trash, I realize that Malfoy doesn't have a wand.
I wake Harry up with a blow job and the fact that he's moaning my name before he's even fully awake makes me hard in a second.
If she's here to give me another lecture on how I'm destroying Harry's life, I'll kick her right out. I really would.
„I disagree. We both have first hand experience of Malfoy losing his head under pressure. That necklace back in Sixth? The wine that almost killed me? Malfoy cracks easily. He gets careless.“
„Just be honest, okay? Remember how we said we always want to be honest? You don't have to try to please me.“
He kisses me and I wrap my arms around his neck, tightly. His hands are on my waist, one slipping to my lower back. When I open my mouth, he groans, pulling me tighter. I can feel his erection pressing against my belly and push against it.
“If you want to fuck me, have at it. I'm assuming you paid. But other than that, there is really nothing I can do for you,“ I say.
„But are you sure the protection spells on Draco are working?“ she asks, mostly just to say something and not look at Blaise. Or Sam.
He is watching Draco come undone under him, writhing and finally, finally letting the moans out he's normally holding back and he looks so beautiful like this,
After a long silence, Harry says: „I'm really sorry about that. About what happened to you and that no one helped you.“
„Pansy won't have to suffer through twelve years. And, remember, no one came to visit Sirius. You're with her every week.“
Pansy swallows, then smiles. She's clearly done talking about it now. „You guys are the sweetest.“ She blows Harry a kiss and Draco feigns indignance.
My loyalties lie with Pansy and therefore, I don't care much about Hermione's feelings and reasoning. I care how she treats Pansy.
I'm just on my way to one of the stalls (I never use a urinal because I'm weird like that), when I notice him.
His voice is breaking on the last word and I know, I know with a bone deep certainty, that he doesn't want to leave me. He wants me like I want him.
But at the same time, he's taken back to school, having those eyes on him while Malfoy'd insult him and Harry would feel his blood boiling.
Everyone laughs. Even Draco. I'm watching him. It's mesmerizing, the way his eyes crinkle and shine and how his white teeth are exposed.
But Draco knows better. He's here because Potter is, because Draco has always been so weak for him, stupid for him, not able to resist any chance to get closer.
„Your point is?“ I wasn't planning on snapping at him, but here we are. I know he hates that side of me.
We're both listening to the noises of the coffee shop, the clattering of cutlery, the roaring of the coffee maker. I try not to think about last night, about Potter panting and arching his back. About his warm body pressed to mine. Urgent, hot kisses in the living room.
„Everything alright, mate?“ Ron seems more relaxed than I've seen him in a while – on leg propped on the couch table, cup of tea in hand.
I know I'll have to tell her something. Otherwise she'll never let it go. „It's just... I have the feeling he isn't very happy with his marriage.“
Something in Flint's gaze shifts and Harry gets a glimpse at the underlying crazy. „Well, the deal is over now. Draco needs to pay for what he's done.“ He stares at the blond. „You're just like Lucius. Weak and impressionable.“
I lift the cup and burn my tongue, quickly putting it down again. Rain is drumming against the windows of our flat. This October is the worst. I can't remember the last time I was able to go outside without once again being confronted with the fact that my Impervius is shit.
“As if I was some kind of animal that couldn't resist a pretty boy,“ Harry says, wrinkling his nose.
I don't complain though and we get heavenly smelling crepes in paper bags, chocolate sauce dripping all over Harry's fingers in no time.
But he sees that Draco knows what he is thinking and doesn't seem all that bothered – just fondly exasperated.
„Ginny is just joking,“ the Ravenclaw says. „She doesn't actually think haircolor is very important.“
I glare at her. „I always wash the sheets.“ I'm lying. I didn't wash the sheets the night Potter left. Maybe the smell of sex is somehow hot, lingering in my sheets. Maybe I was hoping for sex dreams.
I nod, not trusting myself to speak and help him push down his trouser. He pushes me to the bed and I shiver as I flop down on the mattress.
„But... I do know that you can hate and love someone at the same time. I think that nothing is as complicated as loving your family.“
Ron looks at me. „Why would he lie if he didn't do it? He couldn't have said anything to make things worse.“
“Kingsley believed you. I mean, he never said the words, but it was obvious that he did. Robards and some other Auror you don't know would have sacked me, just for associating with you. And because Julien funds half of the department, of course. But Kingsley was having none of it.“
Draco is obviously an expert and I didn't get laid in two years, so I come after thirty seconds. It takes Draco by surprise – I think he was just getting started – and my head must be red as a traffic light while I stammer apologies.
His hand reaches for my crotch, but I catch his wrist and try to regain my composure. Focus on what I'm here to do.
It's also better because I get free coffee every day and can lend books without paying for a membership.
Harry has always, since he was a kid, thrown himself in front of the gun pointed at someone else. If there is one think Draco doesn't want, it's to be just one more person Harry has to save, risking his own safety in the process.
When he pulls out and collapses next to me, he seems absolutely out of it. I did this to him. It makes me smile smugly, despite my throbbing erection demanding attention.
„You never respected me.“ It's something he hasn't thought about before, but now he thinks this is what it all comes down to. „If you did, you wouldn't have hit me. You wouldn't have made me feel weak and dirty and disgusting just so I'd be too scared and ashamed to walk away. You wouldn't have raped me.“
„Being locked into a room with a bunch of moody teenagers for three hours straight? Who would have thought.“
On the other hand, what does it prove that those players have taken Ipos? They could have acted on their own, not on demand of their coach.
It's not a sufficient replacement for lube and I know I must hurt Draco when I push in, but he doesn't complain – only arches his back, pulling me close, begging for more. It hurts me not to be able to hear him, but just the look on his face is enough to have me worry I won't last.
My mouth falls open, my eyes wide as saucers, as I find myself nose to nose with Draco Malfoy. A very
„Did you find anything on that lost Gillyweed?“ Terry asks them, leaning over his desk, looking a little desperate. His nose ring glitters in the yellowish light of their office and his big blue eyes swim with confusion.
We share a moment of silence, then I ask hesitantly: „We don't necessarily have to go back to England tonight.“
I'm bleeding when you find me on your doorstep. I hope you don't see it. The bruises on my face I can't hide, but maybe the old jeans and your jacket cover the rest of the mess I am.
Maybe that's a sign from the universe that I should just let it be. Draco and I got pissed together once. We agreed that we don't hate each other.
Before he tortured me with the Cruciatus, he threatened to hand me over to Nagini. I was kneeling right in front of the enormous snake, able to see her glistening fangs, Voldemort's voice in my head. I looked Death right in the eye. In my case, she was yellow orbs with slits for pupils.
Harry reaches out, touches her shoulder tentatively. Sam laughs, a watery sound, and wipes the tears away. „Merlin, I'm sorry.“
„So,“ he says and it's too funny how he's visibly pulling himself together. „Why aren't you dating? Or... you know.“
„Look, if fucking a Malfoy is beyond you, we can pretend it has never happened. But I need to talk to you about your godson.“
„Not really. Except that one of those wankers is a really powerful one. He's casting spells I've never heard of. You should watch out for him.“
„You sure you're not fired?“ Pansy asks me, eyebrow arched. Her face is gaunt and her movements still shaky, but they're
Unafraid, I push a hand in the tangled fur of his shoulder and hold on tight. The wolf turns his head toward me, eyes wide.
His legs wrap around my waist and we snog for an eternity. We would have for even longer if my stomach didn't growl.
„Of course we do.“ He sets his glass down. Reaches for mine and sets it down as well. My heart is pounding, painfully so.
Draco yelps and spins. No one is standing behind him. There is only an elderly muggle couple that looks at him bemusedly from a few yards away, waiting for the traffic light to turn green.
I nod, then correct myself: „I asked Hermione to. But, yes. George and Finnigan didn't want to come because of me, but I'm supposed to tell you that they'd be happy to celebrate with you another time. And they wish you all the best.“
„I'm going fucking crazy,“ Sam says as she drops into the last free chair – the chair between Pansy and Blaise that the dark-skinned Slytherin saved for her. Pansy almost wishes she'd sit somewhere else.
Yesterday, I finally managed to get her to have dinner with me. We sat on the table together, drinking expensive champagne like we always used to, sharing takeaway and for the first time since I've walked through her door, I felt like what we used to have might not be lost completely.
Draco looks to the side. There is the tiniest frown on his forehead. My heart is pounding away and I think if it keeps going at that speed, I'll die way before my time. All beats used up.
Suddenly, I realize I'm never going to hear how Malfoy sounds when he's joking. When he's being gentle. When he laughs.
My father is looking at me with so much disgust in his eyes, it makes my knees go weak. But I won't back down.
After ninety minutes, I get off the machine on wobbly legs, drying my face with the towel I brought, yearning for a shower.
I lick into his mouth and grind against him, rock-hard, aching. He keens a little, low in his throat, head falling back. I bite his neck, suck bruises into it. When I kiss his jaw, he sighs.
Carefully, I put my glass down and pluck Harry's out of his hand. He smiles at me, anticipation in his eyes.
When Harry Potter quits the Aurorforce and opens a sweet shop in Diagon Alley, the Minister for Magic feels obliged to hold a short, but intense speech on the great loss the DMLE – and basically the whole wizarding world – has suffered and how they will soldier through these difficult times. Nonetheless, he wishes Harry the best of luck.
I bite my tongue. Surprise crosses Ron's face at my use of Draco's given name. He shakes it off for the moment. „Yeah, but he didn't. Not for the stunner, at least.“
„Salazar,“ Draco breathes, leaning with his back against the closed door, pulling Harry in. He kisses Harry's neck and Harry makes keening, breathless sounds he's ashamed of, but he can't help it.
Draco hesitates. „It's new. We haven't really... had the talk, you know. But I like him. And he seems pretty smitten with me, too, so...“
She links our arms and I kiss her head. There was a time while I would always beeline to the shower after a night of work, wished Pansy wouldn't see me like this, but those times are long over. She doesn't care and so I don't either.
„Well, then better be prepared, because I am a mess. Regardlessly, I have high expectations on my boyfriend.“
„It's impossible to turn a person into a Veela – one has to inherit the blood – but it is very possible to be turned into a werewolf. Don't you think, with the werewolf blood already inside him, it would overpower the Veela and stop the magical conflict in his core?“
Not that I'd want to, of course. The humiliating era of me chasing Potter's attention is supposed to be over.
It's going to take me a minute or two or a million to get used to this. I was a spoiled brat and then I was a haughty, terrified teenager and then an ant. And now... I don't know who I am.
“Auror Parker testified that Mr. Malfoy had been bleeding rectally. That is an unusual occurence after consensual sex. How do you explain that?“
The first thing I notice is the smell of the room. Little kid, illness and something that kept wafting through the classrooms in Hogwarts, making me turn up my nose in pretend haughtiness.
After his fingers have slid down my back, between my buttocks and carressed my sore entrance. After I've spread my legs for him and he sank into me from behind, one stong arm wrapping around me, holding on to my biceps for leverage. After I sucked on his fingers while he fucked me deep and I made him cum with a well-timed clench of my arse around him.
Malfoy had been right – the club isn't very pretty. It stinks like piss and sweat and sex and Harry doesn't even want to know what kind of things the people here get up to at night.
Losing that, this person that has been in my corner since day one, was like waking up after a nightmare only to realize it wasn't a dream.
“It'll pass soon,“ I say and settle between his legs, swallowing his raging erection without much preamble.
My hand is creeping up his thigh – until he stops it with his, takes it and scoots up the bed, tugging me with him, lying on his back.
I can't help it – I scoff. „Oh, I bet that bugs you, Granger. Always need to know everything, don't you?“
Pansy, momentarily distracted, focuses her attention back on me. „You don't think you could try with his friends again? They don't have to love you. Not even
I can't really imagine that anyone could ever love Snape the way I loved Sirius, but of course I know that there must have been more to the man than what I saw.
„I think you've all proved that you're ready for the real deal. Your training is completed. No more practice cases from now on – ever. Not only when we're in desperate need for backup,“ he says and now he really is smiling.
The Slytherin lies next to him, not trying to touch him, but Harry scoots closer until they lie shoulder to shoulder. He speaks to the ceiling.
The Minister sighs. „I believe you do, but I can't change the verdict because you believe something, Harry. There is the word of four against Malfoy – including his own testimony.“
You look shocked. Of course, you don't understand what it's like to be me. To be one on the wrong side, one everyone hates now. The only people seeking me out are those, who get a hard-on thinking about fucking a Death Eater. I am still surprised how many men get off on fucking me until I can't even cry anymore. I'm not sure whether it helps I'm pretty – or used to be pretty – or if they don't even take a look at me, only interested in the faded, scarred mark on my forearm.
I grin as I get up, flicking my wand and cleaning us both. Harry is still breathing heavily, staring at the ceiling. I reach out and pull him up. Kiss him.
„A letter to the Prophet, saying that Potter not only likes to fuck blokes, but especially loves taking it up the ass from a Death Eater.“
One look at Weasley's face and the outcome is clear. His grin is wide enough to light up the whole Ministry.
He freezes. Then he pulls his hand away and his face makes my blood run cold. It's closed off and shuttered.
„I don't want Harry to know. He'll freak out,“ he says, hands on Pansy's shoulders to hold her back. She has her eyes narrowed, arms crossed.
Slowly, I approach the bar, still under the cloak. A second or so before I pull it off, Draco's eyes find my face.
„I wasn't out in Hogwarts, you know. I believe it's obvious that my parents wouldn't have approved.“
I move out of Grimmauld Place two months later. You try not to show it, but I know you're upset about it. You want me to stay.
He gets a sentence of ten years and I almost blow up the whole courtroom. He gets that sentence despite Parkinson's claims that she was assaulted, that Draco was trying to help.
He looks into my eyes, with those green orbs that have been making me weak since I was eleven years old and suddenly, I feel like I have to
I know it's wrong, wrong and stupid, but I turn to Harry, voice not a fraction warmer when I say: „I can speak for myself.“
„Mainly. It's also still weird to see Terry hanging out at my flat, but that's a whole other thing. I think at this rate, Harry'll go nuts before we get a chance to arrest anyone. Especially Flint or Derek, who are apparently fucking evil geniuses because whenever we think we've almost got them, they're gone again without leaving a trace. Like, how?“
I miss flying. I haven't missed it in a long time, but now, that I'm starting to think about all the things I used to enjoy doing, flying is at the top of the list.
The tip of my wand digs into his neck. Still, no one moves to stop me, even though I can hear whispers now, distressed and captivated by the scene I'm making.
I'm strolling listlessly through the aisles, my gaze wandering over a huge assortment of book covers, when I notice my son talking to another boy. At first glance, I'd think he's younger than Albus. Skinny and tiny with a head of platinum blond hair.
Harry nods and then his mouth is on mine again. We're not breathing because we can't separate. This has been so long overdue, I don't think anything could stop me right now, stop me from kissing him. Only Harry.
I look into his eyes. „There would be much against us. The wizarding world and its expectations on top of the list. But I won't run, if that's what you're afraid of. If you say you're all in, I will be, too.“
During a magical core examination, it's vital that no other magical beings are around. Otherwise, their magic can bleed into the spell and distort the result.
Harry's face is surprisingly close to Draco's and he kisses him as soon as Draco smiles up at him. They both don't taste very good this shortly after waking up, but Draco finds he doesn't really care. Harry leans back, pulling Draco with him so that Draco's sprawled over him. He's running his hands over Draco's back and Draco thinks he could get used to this. Oh, he defnitely could.
I'm wearing sunglasses in February and a hood pulled over my trademark hair, even though Pansy and I are strolling through an area of London that's mostly muggle.
“He was in pain and out of his mind, like he said. I don't blame him for thinking me a suitable outlet for his anger. I did cause his family quite a lot of agony over the years.“
He wasn't too happy over my appearance. Or maybe he just wasn't too happy about me seeing him stumbling out of another car.
It might be a fuckbuddy date, Harry guesses, but that seems unlikely too. Fuckbuddies don't go on dates, do they? That's the whole point of the concept.
If I'd have thought about it, I'd have realized that I don't know why I'm here – what my intentions are and why I'm not looking for a productive way to pass my time.
„I don't want to lose you completely,“ Harry suddenly says. The determined Gryffindor look has returned to his face. „I think I'm ready to try to be friends.“
Well. It might have something to do with the fact that Draco said: „You're a slut for it, aren't you?“
But then again, neither was Sirius, yet Harry loved him with everything he has, so he decides that it's none of his business and goes through with the meeting.
„You know, Sam and I had another idea. We've... got the tip that some of the more important dealers like to sell at this club in East London. I think it's called Boombarda or something.“
When he turns on the shower head and the water hits his skin, he feels another memory nudge at his mind.
I hardly overhear any of the talk Serpent gives George about how his property is not to be damaged in such a rough way.
I look at her, open my mouth to tell her that's crazy, and close it again. Close it because I understand.
„Maybe we should play some time. It could be your time to shine. I'm not nearly as good as I used to be, I bet.“
I have to smile. Hagrid has always been such a horrible liar. It's astonishing, really, that he managed to keep Draco's secret for so long.
„Not really. I can't stand seeing their faces anymore. Makes me feel even guiltier than I already do. And a little mad to, yeah. What about you? Why is the Golden Trio not together? And where is your bride-to-be?“
Harry knows he has a tendency to be overly jealous, overly protective. He also knows he has a temper.
„Fuck.“ The Gryffindor shoots up and wriggles into his coat. „I have to babysit Rose today,“ he explains.
„Probably the first time he ever got his dick sucked by a guy,“ Pansy muses, hands still carding through my hair. I hum affirmatively, sleep pulling on my tired limbs.
I don't want to explain how scared I get whenever Pansy meets someone new. How I think she'll forget me and no one would care if I died tomorrow.
Harry laughs and pulls Draco close in a quick motion, then wrestles him until Draco's lying flat on his back, looking up at Harry.
She winks at him. „Oh, I get it. It's the hair. There's just something about blonds...“ She grins at Luna.
In front of the others, you're still wearing your disguise, but whenever we're alone, you drop it. You're so good with wandless magic, you don't even
He'd never, in a million years, do the same for Malfoy. The Slytherin would probably run at the first sign of danger. The Malfoy Harry used to know would have, that is for sure at least.
„Don't get too excited,“ I warn her. „I don't think a bit of fucking will keep him from arresting me if he thinks I'm guilty.“
Draco swallows. He's straddling my thighs and looks so incomprehensibly good in his rumpled scrubs and with his messed up hair.
I take sips from my favorite cup and look around the empty apartment. An apartment for two, which has eventually grown into an apartment for one.
Simply because it is always hard for me to screw up the courage to actually walk into her office. Still.
„She's very excited to see you, honey,“ I say. „You're basically all we've talked about last time we saw each other.“
It's late when I retreat to Ron's room, just to get a little privacy. After hours of watching Bill and Fleur together and then Ron and Hermione, who got steadily more cozy as Ron's alcohol level rose, I just... needed a minute.
With a shrug, Ron helps me maneuver my heavy trunk into my new room. „I think he needed his space. He lives at the Joke Shop now.“
“Not that you couldn't be just as brilliant if you did something else,“ I add, remembering that Potter doesn't want to be an Auror.
Luckily, I'm not holding my drink right now – otherwise it would have now been spilled all over my nice jeans.
„Well, Hagrid gave me time to rest and he also gave me a crash course in lycanthropy. What was to come and how I had to protect myself and others. By the time of the trials, I had already taught myself to brew Wolfsbane Potion.“
The boy whose name I've already forgotten licks wet stripes over my skin and then, with a flutter of lashes, takes me into his mouth.
„Draco.“ Serena grins at me. She's been here for longer than I have, but she's still dealing with the same shit – if for different reasons.
He stops being a brat about the paperwork, even though it is dull and partly inefficiently organised. Harry won't want to be fucked by someone acting like a petulant fifteen-year-old. Draco needs some grace and dignity.
I start slow on his neck and shoulders. His surprised, pleased little sigh goes straight to my chest. I'm working my fingers into the hard, knotted muscles of his back, up and down his spine, as far as I can comfortably reach.
„How was your talk with Brighton?“ I ask him, hand lingering on his elbow. Draco pushes it away. Takes it in mine. I think some people are staring, but I don't care.
„I like slow and sweet sometimes,“ I say, pulling him in until he's lying on my chest, one hand following the curve of his back until I can cup his butt, smooth and rounded under my palm. Arousel is pulsing through my veins, my cock hard against Draco's thigh.
„I don't really know what happened, honestly. She said... I mean, for once, she's got it in her head now that I want to get her up the duff
„Sometimes, yes. But... they weren't really my friends. We just had to get along for our parents' sakes. Most of us didn't like each other much.“
„I need new boots,“ the Weaslette says and Harry doesn't say anything and I feel strange as I show her to our collection of dragon leather boots.
Still, I haven't forgotten what I am. You took me in, did so much for me and never asked for anything in return.
Derek's favorite bars as hottest traffick points, his favorite hooker dealing – it was just a feeling. Plus, he didn't like Draco working the case at all.
We've made it through half of the book when I have to stop because I can't listen to my own voice anymore, scratchy as it is now.
„Harry, get me something sweet, would you? I haven't eaten since... seven a.m.“ Harry gets up, but I pull him in for the briefest kiss. „Thanks,“ I say against his lips and he smiles.
The next john is my second most hated kind, right after the timid ones that need me to convince them I'm into it.
Ncuti's voice isn't soft, but it's also not harsh, when he says: „You can plead on mental instability. The judges will take the trauma you experienced into account.“
Harry kneels before me and I think I might faint with lust. He peers up at me through his thick lashes.
I let him try for a couple minutes and part of my brain registers that he really is good at this, better than Potter, but I hate it. His mouth on me feels so
“I wouldn't say he basically admitted that. He insinuated that my former profession means I'm fair game.“
„No, we're not. I'll be on the streets soon because I can't pay this fine. I can't travel and I can't properly cast. I can't walk down Diagon without having insults thrown at me. I have no stable job and no future. We're not. Equal.“
Harry swallowed and, drugged by alcohol, in the dark in front of the flames in which Hermoine's face had danced, he admited something he didn't even dare to think in the security of his own brain until then.
There are two girls sitting only a few metres from me, curled around each other. Long, black shiny hair a stark contrast to blond curls. They're holding each other and I wonder if they're here for someone else or if one of them is sick. Or maybe was.
They're all taking their leave, exchanging overboarding hugs and stumbling a little. Draco is definitely drunk, drunk enough to have trouble walking a straight line, but not drunk enough to feel sick.
„But I just want you to know that I don't... hold grudges or whatever. I'm here to do my job and do it well and so are you, I guess. So you don't need to be worried I'd try to make life hard here for you.“
I think Harry Potter is a virgin. At least when it comes to guys. Definitely when it comes to anal sex.
It might also be the fact that Draco is a bloody veela. I know they have this allure-thing going on.
I shake myself. I care for Pansy. I straighten my spine and try to focus, even though it's hard. I've done harder things, for fuck's sake.
Pushing the door to the loo open, I'm greeted by even worse smells: Piss and Gillyweed and the faint reek of spunk.
He looks up at Harry, batting his lashes innocently and then can't stifle a smug grin as Harry is instantly rock hard.
