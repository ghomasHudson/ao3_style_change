Draco threw his head back and laughed. "I'm sorry. I'm not that old." He grinned, tucking a lock of hair behind his ear. "I'm twenty seven. Wizards do live longer lives, just not that much longer." He smirked at her.
"Oh, you mean besides returning your missing son?" Draco asked sarcastically, pouring himself a cup of tea from the service his house-elf had levitated to the table.
"Of course, I nearly had to put the beast down," Lucius continued casually, like they were talking about the weather.
“My sapphire cufflinks with the inlaid mother of pearl,” Lucius grumbled with renewed frustration. “Minister Shacklebolt has requested a meeting tomorrow morning and I can’t find my best set.”
Grinning, he flicked his eyes over to see if Teddy was still awake. He was, lying on his back as well, head turned looking out at the moon.
Draco hummed in agreement thinking about just how little they had gotten from their mother. "Except the freckles," he commented absently. "Potter never had any freckles."
The other boy's pert nose scrunched up in disgust and he dug in his pocket to pull out a crisp white monogrammed handkerchief. "Here," he held it out to the messy snuffly boy in front of him. "My dad always says it's bad manners to wipe your nose on your sleeve."
Harry shelled out a small fortune and shrank all the supplies into a smaller bag so he could carry it in one hand and hold Lily’s with the other.
Life was finally starting to get back to normal. It felt good to have all his kids under one roof. Despite the heavy beginning of his and Andromeda’s conversation Harry hadn’t felt this happy in a long time. He just hoped Draco didn't mind the little addition the next morning for breakfast.
"Oh." Harry now felt a little embarrassed for his ignorance. It seemed Lucius Malfoy just had a way of making him feel like he knew absolutely nothing about the Wizarding World.
"Find everything alright?" Draco asked, affecting casualness. The realization of how good that shade of green looked on Harry, not to mention how the silk clung to every one of his hard won muscles rose in his mind before he struggled to push it away. He hurriedly pulled on his top hoping he’d kept hold of any outward reflection of his thoughts.
!" No one was more surprised than her when Harry's wand fairly exploded with red sparks. She squealed and dropped the wand, jumping back from it with wide eyes.
That was one thing Harry had learned since he’d entered the Wizarding World. If a building stood steeped in magic for long enough it had an almost sentient feel to it if you paid enough attention.
Teddy was turning eleven. Harry approached this revelation as he would approach any double-edged sword; with extreme caution.
"Well, I'm not sure when exactly he found out, you'll have to ask him that yourself, but I can tell you about when everyone at Hogwarts found out. It's really an interesting story." Draco grinned.
This was moving a little too fast for them. Just a little too fast. Neither of them was ready to discover what this could be.
"Hasn't he?" Harry drawled in amusement. "Weren't you just telling me that he'd been getting into fights with kids older than him, twice his size and winning every time?"
"Belle!" she exclaimed shrilly, slapping her hands to her cheeks in dramatic fashion when she was sure her daddy was looking. "I told you, you couldn't come with us! Where are you going?! Come back!"
Cassiopeia looked like she'd swallowed a fly. "I beg your pardon? Grimmauld Place?" She looked shocked. "The Black ancestral home?"
The boy just shook his head a little and shifted so he was pressed closer to Harry's side. He sighed. When Draco had stripped him of his right to be an arrogant, obnoxious, pain in the ass all of James' buried fear and insecurity had surfaced and now he wasn’t too eager to reassert his independence.
Harry pulled his head out of the fireplace in surprise. "That wanker hung up on me," he muttered in bemusement. That's it, he was fire-calling Kingsley now to apologize in advance for the rain of fire he was going to-
"Potter!" Lucius exclaimed in shock. "Have you no pride for your heritage?" he demanded. "I cannot speak for the Potters, but the Blacks were an extremely proud and tradition orientated family. The heirlooms in these vaults will be positively steeped in magic and history from both families. It is tantimount to an ancestral snubbing for you to be so callously blasé about the heritage and gifts given to you from your ancestors."
"I didn't tell them," Scorpius protested quietly. "Their snakes knew already and they asked me if it was true."
"The Weasleys have adopted Harry in a manner of speaking," Narcissa explained neutrally. "Since the end of the war our families' differences have taken a rather significant dive into unimportance."
"God, Harry. Do you have to always sound so bloody amused when you answer the damn phone?" his cousin grumbled with good naturedly on the other end.
Picking up her own perfectly polished silverware, she began to eat her pancakes and actually enjoy her breakfast for the first time since… well, a long time.
"But he runs too fast!" Albus complained as he stepped out from behind a boxwood topiary shaped like a unicorn.
They put all the books up and left the library to grab a snack before heading off to entertain themselves separately. The up coming visit to Malfoy Manor was at the forefront of their minds.
Harry looked stunned, confused, but he nodded and stroked a hand over Draco's hair in a rare show of truly intimate public tenderness. "I'll take care of them."
"Well," Harry began as he stepped up to the table and pulled out a chair, George following behind him just as eager as the children to hear the story. "The first time was when your Uncle Dudley turned eleven."
Waiting another steadying moment, Narcissa soon took off at a sedate pace toward the solarium. It was the nicest this time of year and it would be formal enough to keep some distance while still being comfortable. God, why was she so nervous?
Surprisingly, since it came from a Malfoy, the compliment meant a lot to him. "Thanks. Scorpius seems like a sweet kid, too."
Narcissa had tried to have more children after Draco was born, but after three miscarriages and one stillborn, Lucius had finally put a stop to it. He couldn't stand to see his wife heartbroken and devastated even one more time. On some level, Draco knew, his mother had been relieved.
In a way the Manor reminded Harry of himself, too. He’d never let all the pain and despair in his life stop him from living, from moving on and being happy.
Draco shot him a warning look before relaxing back against his shoulder. “So, you have no idea what to get Teddy?”
Then he’d noticed it at the Burrow; the almost mischievous, nurturing warmth of the place. It felt quirky, and odd, and too full, but always welcoming to more, and forever filled with love and cheer.
The whole group paraded into the floo room once more, the children triumphantly content, Narcissa and Lucius amused and calm, Harry and Draco quiet and strangely distant.
"Sounds good." Harry grinned and continued to watch Ron tweak and taste and generally putter around the kitchen while keeping an ear on the kids for trouble.
“Is there anything else you need, Mr. Potter?" Her cheeks were a little flushed and she seemed determined to put aside her unpleasant shock that his kids talked to snakes.
Teddy landed on his back laughing like a loon. "You're it! You're it!" he chanted as he clutched at his stomach and tried to suck in a breath around his giggles.
"I don't see why not. It's just like any other language. Although, I suppose, true Parselmouths would still have to inherit the talent, but I mean, if Ron can say something in Parseltongue then anyone can." He grinned wryly.
with a deep red feathered head, back, and wings, a royal blue belly, and an orange and yellow tail. She turned and blinked at him with bright yellow eyes and moved her head around in curiosity.
"Draco, are you quite sure those children are Potter's? They seem much too agreeable to have been spawned from him," Lucius drawled mockingly as he walked next to his son.
Her thoughts paused and her eyes flicked toward her son's mustard and pancake covered plate then back to him. Shaking her head to herself she just pushed her thoughts away and went back to her conversation with Lily and Rose.
"You're very welcome, James." Draco grasped his small hand in his larger one and shook it firmly. "You must come again and visit Lightning. He took quite the liking to you," he told the little boy receiving a smile back before he moved away to go stand with his father.
He got a snort and a halfhearted grumbled in answer before Harry dragged his head up and threw his arms onto the table with a thump. "No, I'm not," he groaned.
"Well, like I said, it's an extremely rare ability. The most infamous Parselmouth was over a thousand years ago and is considered a Dark wizard. Voldemort was a Parselmouth, as well, so being able to talk to snakes is regarded as a Dark ability."
The little girl frowned and curled tighter into Draco's chest turning her face into the soft material of his shirt. She could smell the clean scent of his soap and the dry spice of his cologne.
"That must have been some fall. These are going to need to be cleaned before I can put the healing salve on them, alright?" Draco pulled out his wand and waited for the little boy to nod.
"Calm yourself, Potter!" Lucius snapped, straightening the few hairs that had fallen out of their ribbon when the magical wave had hit them. "That should have worked exactly like a wand. Either you feel a small tingle of power or you feel nothing. There should have been absolutely no- none of what just occurred."
Perhaps that was why Draco was suddenly thinking about having more children after being single so many years. His biological clock was ticking.
She pursed her lips in irritation and straightened the hem of her blouse. "Yes, well. Thank goodness my darling sister is no longer with us. God rest her soul," she tacked on insincerely.
Lifting his free hand, Draco cupped Harry's cheek to hold him close for a moment, lengthening their kiss before they pulled apart.
Tilting his head once more so he could look at him, Draco stared into his eyes for a moment. "Yes," he finally answered, "I'd love to have more kids."
"Are you absolutely insane?" Hermione asked once he was done with his slightly abridged explanation of things.
Lucius was hurting too, but he had to be strong for his family. He would be, but he gave himself that one moment in the dim light of his bedroom with his wife as his only witness to truly feel the grief for the first time in over two decades.
Harry nodded, "Sure, Dud," and stood to open a draw at the end of the kitchen counter pulling out sheet of parchment and a muggle pen. He quickly jotted down a note to Professor McGonagall, folded the letter into thirds vertically then again in thirds horizontally. He looked up and around searching for something.
Harry stared at the suit of armor in awe, his eyes picking out the dents and nicks from historical battles where they scarred the otherwise perfect metal.
Albus seemed like a good kid, Draco thought. Judging by the all of ten minutes he'd spent with him. A little quiet maybe, but polite and cute as any little boy is at that age. What on earth was the kid doing running around Diagon alone?
"Oh, tosh," Margaret scolded him, pinching his cheek lightly. "You're not even getting there yet. When you're as old as Kingsley and I, then you can talk of feeling it."
"Yes, sir," James grumbled through clinched teeth then turned on his heel and stormed out of the kitchen up the stairs to his room.
He'd never seen Harry quite that mad before. Not even when he and James had broken the window in the front parlor playing with his practice snitch. He'd also never heard him talk about the war before either. Oh, he'd talk about it in broad terms like "a dark wizard wanted to get rid of non-purebloods", and "I was the only one who could stop him".
Ron gave a snort and popped back into the kitchen Harry following behind him. "They're great, mate. Just came back from Mum and Dad's."
Glancing over at him, Harry ran a hand through his messy hair. "I am too. This has been really good for them. I can't tell you how bad it was getting with them just sitting around the house.”
Draco's eyes fluttered open and he tilted his head to see Harry's face. "Thank you." He smiled softly, pleased. "Your kids are amazing, too. Teddy as well, even though you didn't spend as much time raising him. They're all wonderful."
"I would think so," Teddy said. "It's like a tattoo, right? Those are permanent." They all thought back, trying to remember if they had ever glimpsed a skull and snake on Draco or Lucius's left arms. They realized that they hadn't because neither man was ever in anything, but long sleeves.
Chrissy glared at the end of the wand in concentration and held it tightly in her little hands. Harry could hear Dudley and Marianne holding their breath behind him. She took a deep readying breath and shouted at the top of her lungs.
"Albus and Lily, definitely." They both nodded in complete agreement. Teddy bit his lip debating with himself, then finally reached a decision. "And Scorpius too. He'll be able to get things from his family's side that we wouldn't be able to get."
!" the little boy shouted with a bright smile directed at Fleur who smiled back at him momentarily distracted from her scowling.
"Yeah," Harry breathed and stared out of the door toward the yard watching the kids run and play. It seemed odd, wrong, not to see a little blond boy glued to Albus's side out there. "He's been great. Great with the kids and great about letting us impose on him at the Manor when Grimmauld gets to be too much and the kids refuse to go to the Burrow."
She tore her gaze away from the giggling little boy and smiled wanly at her son. "Yes, dear. I'm just curious. You said that Teddy was Remus Lupin's son?" Her tone was deceptively neutral.
As if on cue all the other children began shuffling guiltily putting on bashful little grins. A couple of them surreptitiously snatched handfuls of the barely touched cookies hiding them in their pockets.
There, inside were piles of rubies, and emeralds, and sapphires, and diamonds, wrinkled lumps of gold and shiny veins of silver, all just laying in that drawer. Harry felt an incessant urge to reach forward and just pick up one jewel, just one to see if it was real.
Harry just barely kept himself from snorting. He would bet his left arm that Lucius hadn't completely cleaned up his ways. There was no way the man would give up everything Dark and sordid. And if he did, he wouldn't be Lucius Malfoy.
"Do you know where we could look for an answer?" Teddy asked, getting somewhat desperate, then. He needed to know! His grandma hated the only other blood family he had. But he liked them and he just wanted her and Harry to not fight again.
"Time to go, James, Albus," Harry called and was promptly bombarded with a volley of protests from Malfoys and Potters alike. He just grinned, happy for the first time in a long time. "That's enough, boys. Say thank you to Scorpius and Mr. Malfoy then we have to floo home, come on."
Albus he stroked a hand along the snake's smooth cool body studying his pale yellow and gray ghostly patterned scales. “
"I should be asking you that, Harry." She pulled away and looked him up and down with concern. "You, boy, are too skinny."
"My lord," she breathed pressing a hand to her breast. "Rapier Roses. I haven't seen these in years! Look Kingsley! Come look at these."
And shockingly enough, to himself and to Lucius, Harry realizing that he did. He did trust this man that had tried to kill him and his friends more than once.
Albus examined his hands in amazement then turned those huge green eyes on Draco. "They're great, Mr. Malfoy. Thank you!"
She breathed again and this time Harry knew that it was more to keep herself from falling apart than to find her words. “It’s been a couple of years. I-I’m not sure how long, but I’ve been… overwhelmed.”
Sighing heavily, Draco tightened his arms around the boys and continued to rub their backs soothingly. He looked up to find James, Teddy, his mother, and Lily all watching the scene in trepidation.
"I wrote for Scorpius to write back right away, so I suppose we wait until Artemis comes back," Albus answered.
A week of sending out Feelers and running Trackers, Harry finally found Ginny Potter sitting on a beach in the Virgin Islands.
"Andromeda!" Harry burst, surprised at the venom in her voice. A mix of indignation and protectiveness welled up in him. "I may not like Lucius, but Narcissa is not condescending nor are either of them excessively prejudiced any longer," he tried to tell her.
Lucius was still studying him intently, thinking over his words before he answered. "I will warn you, Mr. Potter, that my son is possessive and what he takes to claim, he keeps." And with those cryptic words the older man strode off to speak to the stable manager leaving Harry feeling uneasy and even more confused.
Now, a third of the way through, Genevieve, the heroine, has met Vance, the handsome hero, and they've had mad, hot, wild, steamy, passionate-… three times already. And Narcissa couldn’t put the silly book down. The mindless little thing was addictive.
George shook his head and turned to Harry. "Malfoy sure is something else. Never expected the pointy faced prat to be that good with children. Or have a sense of humor, come to think of it."
Harry broke their mouths' contact for a second to murmur, "My bedroom," before they were fused together again and moving without a thought past the fire burning in their veins.
First the marriage severing, then Scorpius had taken up his time, and then he had the shop, and having more children by whatever means just got pushed to the back of his mind.
Conversation at their table was a tad strained for a time. Ron looked truly unhappy and a bit sloshed. Hermione kept shooting him scathing looks. Audrey and Percy seemed uncomfortable with the tension and Harry was at a complete loss.
"That is a lovely name. Named after a flower; fitting for a pretty girl," Draco said smoothing a hand over her tear dampened hair and tucking it behind her ear. "My mother is named after a flower as well, you know."
Harry stared at him, stunned. Heart pounding, he swallowed the nervous lump in his throat and croaked, "I'm sorry, Draco. I-I didn't mean to hurt you. It took me by surprise and so soon after Ginny left." He shrugged helplessly knowing there was no excuse that would make this right. "I didn't know if I was ready to try something like this again."
As the children said their goodbyes and whispered smugly of their success the adults prepared for departure in a more sedate manner. Lucius and Narcissa bid them farewell then retreated to their separate morning tasks leaving Draco and Harry to stare at one another with carefully schooled expressions trying to conceal their fear and longing.
Lucius nodded trying not to roll his eyes. Narcissa had done the same panicky over preparation for nearly all of Draco's birthday celebrations, so he was well practiced at damage control. "I'll take care of it, my dear. Why don't you have a seat with Draco and order some tea? Just have a rest while I work on the gardens."
"It's a valid concern, Harry," Draco told him honestly, moving obligingly when Harry's arms wound around his waist pulling him closer. "A lot of the old pureblood families still have the same prejudices, and a lot of the Wizarding World still have the same fears. But I do think her mistrust in your judgment was unfounded."
"I have done many terrible things," he said, and the children listened raptly. "Some of them, I regret deeply. Some of them, I do not. Many people hate me for the power I held in the Ministry before the Second War. Many people hate me for the prejudice I held for half-breeds, muggleborns, muggles, and those creatures I viewed as inferior.
"Oh! But I like your hair too, Miss Cissy." Lily turned on her perch and tentatively twirled a lock of Narcissa's hair around one of her own little fingers. "I think yellow hair is really pretty."
A frown stole over Marianne's pretty face. "You really think that was him doing magic?" she asked in bewilderment.
There was a long moment of silence then Andromeda found her voice. And it was obvious she wasn’t happy. "You took my grandson into Malfoy Manor," she repeated flatly. "You put my Teddy in the same house as my condescending, prejudiced sister and her bastard husband?"
"Oh! Can Teddy really stay with us, Aun’ Dromeda?" Lily latched into Teddy like a limpet, her eyes wide and pleading like her father’s had been.
"I'm might have been a bit rude," Andromeda agreed, her eyes still fastened on the kitchen door. “It was a bit of a shock.”
The response he got was a wave of excited exclamations and a stampede of small people stumbling into the kitchen.
Teddy had been trying to learn Parseltongue with Scorpius and could understand maybe every third word. He wasn't anywhere near fluent, but he could get the general gist of what his snakes were saying.
Ron frowned at him. "How did you get them off the walls?" He got a look that said he really didn't want to know. "Right, okay, don't answer that."
Shaking himself from his dark thoughts, Harry stared blankly off toward the kitchen stove. "James is... very unhelpful. He'd been taking the most responsibility for his siblings while I was gone and Ginny was
"And this Harry Potter is happy enough to impose upon my darling son's hospitality, but to not offer up his own?" she remarked with affected lightness and surprise.
had the lights in the room extinguishing and soon Harry and Draco were fast asleep, embracing each other as if they'd done it all their lives.
Harry turned to look at him wide eyed and shook his head in disbelief. "Yeah, over horrid mother-in-laws and catty wives."
Molly wasn't sure she'd heard him right and she just stared for a moment until his increasing nervousness snapped her out of it.
The sound of laughter drifted over to them on the wind and Harry looked toward the pond where Lily was petting a large white swan that seemed to be coolly tolerated her cooing. James and Albus were splashing around in the shallows while Scorpius stalked that one unfortunate peacock that seemed oblivious to the danger. He couldn't help himself, he grinned.
"Scorpius, Draco's son, has attached himself to Albus like a limpet, but all the kids get on with him."
Harry only hummed in agreement, suddenly feeling drained and lethargic in Draco's arms. "Nova said they'd been listening the whole time."
"Yeah! And his arms are too long," Scorpius added as he wandered toward them on the path. "He won't even have to run. He'll just have reach for us." He demonstrated by thrusting his arm out as far as it would go and making a grabby hand.
"Oh, do that a little more and it will certainly be enough thanks." Draco grinned, tugging him back into another kiss. Their tongues twisted and their noses nuzzled against each other as their lips moved together and against. It was positively blissful.
Hermione watched all of this and couldn't help the guilty ache that started in her chest. She had been very uncharacteristically unfair to Draco and she wanted desperately to make up for it.
Hermione couldn't believe her eyes. Harry had said that the Malfoys were different, more human than they seemed. That they treated the kids wonderfully, but she hadn't really believed it. At least not until last night.
And Harry's family was important to him above all else. Draco didn't want him to have to choose between them. Especially since he was pretty sure he knew who Harry would choose.
Draco sighed as he sipped at the tea Harry had fixed him and happily watched the activity around him. He wanted this for his family. He wanted this beautiful man, and these amazing children, and if there was one thing Malfoys excelled at, it was getting exactly what they wanted.
"Yeah." Scorpius nodded as he stuffed some hash browns into his mouth. "It's hard, but I think I can understand a little bit. I can tell what they’re talking about at least." He shrugged and lifted a hand to stroke over Tal's head as the snake curled around Albus's shoulders.
Shortly after the plates had been cleared away, spelled to clean themselves in the sink, and the strudel brought out and served, there was a disturbance in the vicinity of Lily and Hugo.
"Well, Potter," Draco said wryly after closing the door on yet another uninhabitable guestroom. "It seems like you're bunking with me."
Lucius stepped up with a roll of his eyes drawing his own wand and tapping the end to a stone gutter jutting out of the vault walls at eye level and murmured, "
"Mr. Malfoy." Shacklebolt nodded politely as he stood up and reached across the desk to shake his hand. "I'm glad you could come. Please, have a seat."
The next morning he had the kids dressed and ready to go before breakfast. He stepped into the floo with Lily on his hip instructing Albus and James to floo together right after.
Draco clapped his hands and smirked. "Wonderful. Now that everyone is introduced, Albus, why don't you show Scorpius your room?" He reached for Lily snagging her under the arms and before Harry could even think of protesting lifted her away.
"I don't want to play with the boys. Can I sit with you and Draco?" Lily asked. She had a smudge of dirt on her little sundress and a handful of leaves in her hair. In that moment, Draco thought she strongly resembled her father.
Upon looking in the mirror for the first time, toothbrush stuck in his mouth and toothpaste foam gathering at the corners of his mouth, Draco raised an eyebrow at his reflection. It wasn't really anything he hadn't been expecting; messy hair, creases where the sheets imprinted on his chest, but what he found interesting, or amusing -either one, was the love bite just under his left collar bone.
Harry climbed out rather less gracefully than Lucius who strolled onto the walkway as elegantly as could be not a hair out of place. The older man quirked an amused smirk at Harry’s jelly legs, before he turned to the vault door expectantly.
"You wouldn't happen to make earrings, would you?" Bill asked with a teasing grin as he lightly flicked his ever present fang earring with his fingers.
Lucius scolded him with such vehemence that Harry had no doubt he was missing something the older man felt so fundamental to his life. And he hadn’t even known he was missing something at all.
They shared friendly goodbyes, then Harry was out the door and wishing he could get home just a little quicker than a floo ride. He’d been gone barely an hour and a half and he already missed his kids.
Closing the bedroom door behind him, he found Harry leaning against the opposite wall watching him with glowing eyes.
"Lucius darling,” Narcissa stepped forward and placed a calming hand on her husband's arm. “There's really no reason to fuss. These things happen. I'm sure Shotzy will do his best to repair the floo as quickly as he can. The Manor is a very old house after all, and it's to be expected that things will need fixing every once in a while."
"I figured he would be," Harry agreed, readily. "He's a really smart kid, Draco. You did really good with him."
"Well, I would guess words and knowledge, Potter. What do you normally think is possessed in books?" Lucius drawled sardonically before reaching forward and carefully pulling a battered volume from its place on the shelf.
A sour look came over Lucius’s face. “Ah, yes. It seems that they have been quite successful at it, too. Making full use of our house-elves and those snakes as I understand it.”
"Does everybody know what they want?" Harry asked, noticing not for the first time just how strange his kids were acting that day.
Coming out into the garden to the sound of laughter, Harry paused just outside the door and smiled at the sight before him.
Harry just shook his head. "Nope, shouldn't hurt her a bit. At least it didn't when I did it. Might even prove a little fun. Come on. We'd better go outside for this. It can be a bit destructive." He ushered his now slightly nervous cousin out into the backyard.
His groin gave a stir of arousal and Draco figured he might as well hop in the shower before those thoughts lead to other things he didn't have time for with a house filled with children and a breakfast waiting to be consumed.
Harry slumped in his seat and sighed. "I'm alright, Ron," he assured him knowing what his friend was going to ask. "It's getting better."
"Do you have a problem with sharing?" Draco asked almost petulantly not liking the thought that Harry might indeed have a problem with sharing a bed with him. He thought they were friends, the thought he was squeamish about being so close to him didn’t sit well with Draco.
And that was what scared him. Even with Ginny he hadn't felt quite like this. It was powerful and heady, and something that he wasn't quite sure he was ready for. His wife had just abandoned him and his children, he was still learning how to be a good father, he was just now getting his life back together.
Placing his ear against it, Scorpius listened for any sign of life inside. It was completely quiet, so he gingerly turned the handle and pushed the door inward. There was plenty of light streaming in from the bay windows and the whole room was illuminated.
"Yes," Draco whispered, emotion filling that one word. Harry paused in his pleasant fidgeting, listening silently. "I don’t have siblings, because my mother couldn't have anymore children. I'd always wanted a large family if I had any kids. Then Astoria completely ignored Scorpius and after the marriage severing I was so busy picking up the pieces, trying to keep it together that even thinking about trying to have another relationship made my stomach turn."
The look on Andromeda’s face was a picture of shocked confusion, but her eyes showed signs of igniting. “Seeing each other? What on earth, Harry?”
Harry and Ron sat in silence for a few long moments as the event sank in. Turning to his best friend, Harry couldn't keep the incredulous frown from his face.
"I grew three inches," Teddy informed his godfather with a grin that reminded Harry so much of Tonks. "Besides, I think you're shrinking."
The moment the treasure was out of sight, Harry sucked in a huge breath of air and took a shaky step back. "What was that?"
"No, she didn't," Draco agreed dryly. "The entirety of his care fell to me with some help from Mother and Father. On Scorpius's second birthday I changed the wards, locked down the vaults, and filed for a severing."
Narcissa chuckled and waved dismissively. "I hardly think there will be any suffering going on, darling."
Harry thought about his cousin's concerns for a moment before saying, "You know, Dudley, if she is a witch you could enroll her in a wizarding primary school. She wouldn't be the freak in school then. Or she could be taught by my mother-in-law. Molly taught all of her kids before they left for Hogwarts and is teaching most of her grandkids as well."
Andromeda had a firm, sure presence. It was larger than herself and told you that she wouldn’t be swayed or ignored easily. Her eyes told of pain, loss, and hardship. Narcissa looked at her for a long moment, but there was no denying it.
Once Lucius had finished, the quill laid itself elegantly down onto the blotter and stilled. He pulled the document towards himself reading it once over before handing it to Harry for his inspection.
This was what he needed, Draco realized, just this. He exhaled waveringly before kissing Harry deeply, languidly, offering and begging all at once.
"Of course, darling." Narcissa smiled at him and patted his arm. "We want Draco to make a good impression, don't we?"
Of course, the fact that he didn't find her particularly attractive could have also been a contributing factor. She was undoubtedly beautiful, but Draco didn't find the female form all that arousing. Why had he let his father talk him into marriage again?
” she said satisfied with this conclusion. Then her curled back into Draco's chest and drifted off into a doze, listening to his voice rumble in his chest.
"Come now, Potter." Lucius smirked in amusement. "You always knew you were from good stock. This can't really be a surprise to you, can it?"
The Adder snake is the only venomous snake native to Great Britain and the only one frequently spotted in Scotland.
Soon, the meal being finally underway, everyone broke off into their separate conversations. Draco began to enjoy himself just listening to those around him.
"Aw! Why not? It would be so cool. Lily and I could practice talking to it, so we could get as good as you and Al," James said accompanied by an emphatic nod from Lily.
"Oh, nothing, really," drawled a dryly amused voice from the suddenly open door. "It’s charmed to only open when I tell it to."
"Damn it, Narcissa! Where the hell are my good boots?" Lucius cursed the next morning as he rushed around their suite trying to get dressed.
(1982) starring Julie Andrews, where Robert Preston's character, Toddy, mentions that the only woman he ever slept with was named Nanna LaNou... and she had an adam's apple "like a coconut".
"When you pass on," he continued trying for tact, "you will be leaving Draco and Scorpius with more than just money. You will be leaving opportunity, options, and a veritable empire of land property. Very generous of you by the way," he added offhand.
"You're right, there is," Narcissa stated plainly. "Draco and Harry have known each other since school. They hated each other and if I'm not mistaken tried to kill one another a time or two over the course of their education." She smirked elegantly at her mother-in-law's incredulously raised eyebrow.
"What did you and Father discuss this afternoon?" Draco asked as they sat on the patio watching the kids playing in the gardens.
Cursing, he grumbled about forgetting things and pulled his wand out. With a wave a stick of wax and his seal popped into existence on the table in front of him making Dudley jump in surprise.
Harry chuckled and took his wand back. "Very good, Teddy. Chrissy, why don't you give it a try. Now, you might not be able to do it so don't fret if nothing happens. Not everyone can do magic."
She chewed on her lip in indecision looking like a much prettier version of her father for a moment. Finally she tentatively answered, "Can I try red sparks, Uncle Harry?"
"When you are ready to talk we can discuss him going back with you then, but for now he stays with me," Harry repeated solemnly.
He took a deep breath of that scent he was growing to crave and Draco knew had to tell Harry now, while they were on the subject or he might never tell him.
"Oh, of course," Cassiopeia agreed redundantly. "I take it they have not bonded yet, regardless of their supposed attachment. If there will be more children involved, I should hope they plan on legitimizing their union," she continued with level of haughtiness that Narcissa had never been able to perfect.
Draco nodded understandingly and leaned his head against Harry's shoulder in comfort. They listened to the sounds of their kids playing outside until they were ready to start making lunch.
It went so good Harry even had another meeting set up with Lucius to discuss other investment ideas he had.
"Well," Draco breathed after a beat of silence. "That took me back." Then he had Albus's suddenly pale face pointed up at him in panic.
“Now,” Narcissa smiled mildly holding everyone’s attention. "The Manor is large enough that everyone should be able to comfortably stay the night until the floo is in working order."
They remained warily silent, until Teddy broke into a mischievous grin. "'Do as I say not as I do', eh, Miss Cissy?" He earned a smattering of giggles from his partners in crime and vindicated smirk from Lucius.
"So, Draco," Charles grinned at him flirtatiously. "Do you have any interest in dragons?" he practically purred.
The crowd cheered and clapped and the chameleon was uncharmed and cut into. Teddy had the largest piece and finished every last bit of it. Draco had two and very nearly licked the plate clean.
"Alright, Teddy!" Andromeda said from her place next to Harry. "Make a wish and blow out the candles!"
"That sounds perfect, Luna," Harry smiled widely, almost a little gleefully, at her. "Shall we meet you there, then?"
He shook his head and gave the two frightened boys in his arms a quick squeeze before letting go. "No, of course not. I was there when everyone discovered Harry could speak Parseltongue," he said as he stood up then chuckled. "Actually, it was my fault that everyone discovered it."
Since Fred had died he hadn't thought about expanding. His shop in Diagon was profitable enough, but in the past couple of years there had been several products he’d been putting off developing for lack of expendable income. Now with the possibility of Harry funding the research it wouldn’t hurt to at least discuss their options.
"Draco, you aren't going to tell anyone, are you? Oh! Please don't tell anyone!" the little boy pleaded, tears springing to his eyes. "Daddy said not to tell anyone, but I just couldn't let Mister Adder bite Scorpius! I'm sorry."
"So, what is it Lily?" James prompted from where he was sprawled against a round embroidered cushion Mischief coiled up on his belly.
Harry and the shop clerk watched, Harry with amusement and the clerk with a growing sense of unease, as the Potter children and Lupin adoptee began lifting snakes out of the tank and getting to know them.
Of course the kids loved to play in their back pasture much like they did while visiting the Burrow, so they never complained about a visit to Uncle Ron and Aunt Hermione's.
Chuckling at just how distraught his cousin sounded, Harry threw a reassuring arm around Dudley’s shoulders and winked at Marianne who had also adopted a troubled expression. "Don't worry, Dudley. I'll help you get your pounds exchanged at Gringotts Wizarding Bank, and I'll help you shop for their school supplies."
Shotzy almost wet himself with relief. The children were busy shooting badly hidden grins at each other. Harry and Draco seemed oblivious to it all just concerned about the malfunctioning floo.
“Huh.” Harry sat back bewildered trying to reconcile this new modern enlightened Lucius Malfoy with the old, evil prejudice Lucius Malfoy that had tried to kill him several times over his teen years.
Narcissa nodded her head, but it was clear that some of her happiness had flown away. “It’ll be alright, dear. We’ll get through it.” She lifted his hand that she still clasped and kissed it bringing a tender smile to her husband’s face. “Your cufflinks are in the third drawer of your jewelry box, my love, the one with the inlays.”
"The owls have come, Master Lucius," he said in a squeaky voice, holding the tray aloft for Lucius to take the missives from it.
"They know about the war, but I haven't told them about your family's part in it. It hadn't really crossed my mind, to tell you the truth. And besides, they know that we hated each other in school anyway," Harry answered defensively.
Draco studied his expression intently for a moment before smiling softly. "Yeah, but it's a nice first." He laid his head back down to Harry's shoulder and shifted closer. "I haven't slept this well in a very long time."
"So, the difference between Lightning and the other horses is like the difference between a post owl and a wild owl," Harry surmised, his eyes never leaving his son and the giant of a horse.
Draco Malfoy looked Potter up and down and thought he’d matured well. Harried, stressed, and slightly tearstained with red headed starfish attached to his side didn’t detract from Potter’s new found attractiveness at all.
Draco giggled and summoned a house-elf to order some cheese, crackers, and fruit to take the edge off of their buzzes. "Precisely. Malfoys aren't anything if not opportunistic."
"Luna, this is Lucius Malfoy," Harry hastened to the reintroductions before she said something that forced Lucius to seriously question her sanity.
Taking one look at the uncomfortably stiff bodies filling the kitchen and at how Scorpius was standing pressed against the back of Draco's legs, Harry turned toward his family and smiled widely at them.
An intrigued smirk twisted at the woman’s full lips. “How did they manage that?” she asked sounding much too amused for Lucius’s liking.
Draco blew blond hair away from his eyes and leaned back in his chair crossing his legs. "No, I don't suppose you would be."
"For marrying a muggle-born named Edward Tonks," Narcissa answered sounding casual, but her expression gave her away.
Lily's snake, Belle, he was informed by his daughter, was a flirtatious thing. She was the equivalent to a girly girl in the reptilian world. Snake-ish giggling and cooing aside, Harry surmised that if you pissed her off, she'd get you when you least expected it.
The older wizard nodded. "Of course. I will be at the Malfoy Manor with her on Saturday. Is the Master of Malfoy Manor aware of my coming?"
Stepping into the Menagerie, they were hit with a wave of pure animal smell. It came as a cross somewhere between animal poo, barnyard, hay, ferret food, and just plain fur. Of course the kids started bouncing up and down even more excited.
Grin melting into a look of determination, Harry straightened up and walked slowly toward him. Draco uncrossed his arms feeling his heart speed up, but his eyes never left Harry's. They were mesmerizing in their sudden intensity.
That brought Harry up short, because it was completely true. As Parselmouths they were all considered the Masters of the Serpents. Snakes naturally obey whatever they tell them.
Gotta work, gotta work, gotta work! James chanted to himself as he kept his eyes on Teddy's bright purple hair. The plan had to work, because their dad had to be happy again, and Scorpius would be a cool little brother, and Lily wanted a little sister. He just knew it had to work. It just had to work.
Harry sighed and pushed a hand through his hair. "Ginny left them there saying she would be around in a couple of days for them. Then she disappeared for three weeks without so much as a word."
Lucius scoffed rather ungentlemanly. "Yes, I heard about what she did. Threw away three children and perhaps the most powerful wizard, magically and politically, in a century in a fit of nerves and ran off to some God forsaken island in the West Indies.” He sneered keeping his voice level so as not to draw attention. “That girl never did use an ounce of sense God gave her."
"They're doing what?!" she exclaimed, pressing her hands to her flushed cheeks. "Oh dear! That won’t do. Claude! Claude!
"Do you believe me, James?" he asked feeling desperate for his son to say yes. "I love you. You and your brother and sister. You're all three of you my life."
He had come to a realization then that his little sister had gone completely around the bend. Ron would tear out his own heart before he gave up Hugo and Rose, so Ginny must actually be mental to give up James, Albus, and Lily. It made him ache with sadness and shame for his little sister.
Harry snorted, he could see an eleven year-old Draco bouncing up and down with the excitement of getting a horse as a present.
He tapped a long finger on his chin and squinted trying to remember. "Then there was a Dorea Black that married a Charlus Potter. They would be your," he lifted a hand and counted silently on his fingers, "great-great-grandparents."
Looking back up at the seemingly annoyed, frowning wizard, Albus smiled bashfully at him. "Tal says he's sorry for being rude."
"Oh, sweetheart." Molly rushed over and gathered the sullen boy into her arms. "Wouldn't you like to stay with me and Grandpa? We could bake cookies and have hot chocolate."
It was a good thing he hadn't immediately panicked. No, he apparated into the Burrow at two in the morning shouting for Molly and Arthur in a fit of near hysteria thinking his wife and kids had been kidnapped. He was high profile in the ministry and still had enemies even though the war had ended a decade ago.
They didn't find much. One dark wizard on the Malfoy side wrecked mayhem sometime in the fourteenth century, one witch was convicted of human sacrifice in the sixteenth century, and a whole bunch scattered throughout were awarded various metals and honors for services to the Ministry and such.
"They'll need magic stuff to go there though, won't they?" Dudley asked, once again concerned. "We don't have any wizard money. I don't even know where to go to get a wand!"
She just chuckled and hugged his arm around her middle. "You think it’s romantic too, my dear. Don't try to deny it."
"Narcissa!" Lucius scolded while the children all paused in their eating to stare at her wide eyed. "I just finished scolding them for invading their fathers' privacy and here you are, woman, encouraging them."
"Well, that's understandable," Molly assured him and decided to go back to snapping her beans to help lighten the atmosphere and give her something else to do than sit there staring at Harry.
The image of Draco smiling at him and waving through green flames would stay with him as he fell into bed that night.
"He is a magical animal, Mr. Potter," Lucius explained moving to stand next to him as they watched Narcissa guide James’s hand to stroke the horse’s nose. "Uncanny intelligence, greater lifespan, and often times annoying personality quirks are all to be expected with magical animals."
The small, scared woman gave a little shriek of fright and bolted for the doors just before they closed, narrowly missing getting her skirt snagged in the gate.
"Yeah!" they cheered. Teddy grinning, flushed, and happy came forward and let Draco pull him into an extra tight hug.
Harry just stared at the page for a moment before he turned stunned green eyes on him. "Ignotus Peverell. This is one of his journals." He gestured uselessly to the book in his hands.
James finally lifted his head and met his dad's eyes. "It's just that Mum, you know. Every time you left she would just- it was like- Like she wasn’t really there either." He cut off, his throat tightening with the remembered feelings of crushing responsibility and loneliness, tears coming to his sad hazel eyes. Boys weren't supposed to cry!
With a heavy sigh, he wandlessly summoned the unopened bottle of Ogden's Old Firewhiskey from his study and cracked the seal. It was going to be a long night.
"Albus, Lily, you’re going to be looking through those books. Look for anything about family history or with the Black name on it." They nodded, went off in opposite directions, and started reading each and every title on the shelved books.
Harry smiled proudly at him as he pulled his wand and lit the eleven candles perched along the ridge of the chameleon's back. "You ready, Teddy?" he asked, grinning.
Turning in his seat to give the child his full attention, Draco placed his hands in his lap and asked very politely, "What can I do for you, sweetheart?"
The children burst out laughing and Draco made a show of pouting, but did indeed close his mouth and continue eating with much more decorum.
Narcissa shook her head slightly and fluttered a hand up to her throat then back down to her lap, not sure what to do with them. "It was a long time ago, Hermione. The pain has dulled, the loss felt less keenly, but I still remember and love them, each and every one. What helped me the most, what helped me move on, what I would not have survived with my sanity intact without, was my son and my husband," she said, sounding as though she wanted nothing more than to be in the light and away from the lingering grief.
They were quiet for a time, then Albus asked, "Is that all that he told you? Nothing about what would make Aunt Dromeda dislike your family so much?"
Draco couldn't tear his eyes away from Harry's, but he sucked in a breath and nodded, clutching at Harry's upper arms tightly as he started to press forward penetrating him inch by inch.
"Done." Lucius grinned and leaned his chair back at a relaxed angle a hand under his chin, index finger spanned across his jaw, his other fingers curled against his chin. "Where did you learn to negotiate, Mr. Potter? I'm really rather impressed."
"Right." James nodded then turned the conversation back on track. "Alright, so Draco nearly killed Dumbledore and let Death Eaters into Hogwarts. What do we think about that?" He looked around at his siblings inquiringly.
Grinning, Draco leaned forward and grasped Harry’s shoulder in a half embrace of farewell. The scent of sunshine and herbal shampoo floated up to Harry's nose and he had to shake his head to clear it.
A explosion of air escaped the dark skinned Minister as he leaned back in his chair and rubbed tiredly at his eyes with the heels of his hands. "Alright. I'll look into it. Once I've figured out who is doing this every single copy of unlawfully obtained information will be given back to Mr. Malfoy along with an official apology to him and anyone else affected by this."
"Hey, ducklings," Draco greeted as he stepped into Scorpius's play room followed closely by Harry. "It's time for you all to head home."
There was no point in going through all of the details of presenting clothes, so they didn't try. Draco instead summoned one of his more mild mannered elves to him. "Frilly, would you be so kind as to answer any questions Marianne has about house-elves and your work?" he asked, though knowing the house-elf took it for the order that it was.
He laughed as she flooed home to pack a bag for Teddy and the kids stampeding back outside eager to continue their war against the garden gnome.
He’d felt it first at Hogwarts. The deep pride the castle held in its students and professors. The heartbreaking sadness after the Final Battle had battered its walls.
Draco rolled his eyes. "Running the house-elves ragged, more like. She nearly put five of them in St. Mungo's earlier this week in a bid to de-Dark the gardens."
Andromeda waved him off and took over making tea while he finished up the dishes. "That's understandable, Harry. Teddy just couldn't contain himself anymore and insisted we come and visit."
They read through the list together as the rest of the room went back to their food. It was all pretty standard from what Harry could remember. Wand, cauldron, uniform, dragon hide gloves; the books hadn't changed much either except for the Herbology book Neville had written. The reading of the list went without a hitch until they got all the way to the end.
"I figured they would just get a list from the goblins like I did," Harry said then immediately felt like a naughty child when Lucius turned a truly outraged look on him.
Sitting down at his desk in his study Harry began looking through some new papers Lucius sent over. All in all, Harry decided that today had been a good day.
"Like what?" James persisted anxiously. It was starting to freak him out, how so totally unhappy Scorpius looked about telling them this stuff. Could it really be that bad?
Harry smiled. "Me too. This was great, Draco. I can't thank you and your parents enough for doing this for Teddy." He leaned down and kissed him softly, slowly.
"Thank you, Peters. Do be so kind as to inform me when your wife finally decides to run away to the Caribbean with that French wizard she's been shagging behind your back. We can discuss it crudely and publicly in front of your children so that everyone can hear all the juicy details," he replied gritting his teeth, his magic seething inside him.
Harry snorted at his own thoughts. Even for wizards, a sentient house was a far stretch of the imagination, but that was how some of the ancient places felt to Harry, like they had personalities of their own.
"That's enough of that, Harry James Potter. It is over and done with. She is gone and good riddance to her. She gave you up and there is no reason why you shouldn't move on."
"Lucius retired?" Harry asked incredulously, waving off Draco’s wordless offer of a refill. The drinks were strong and he was already on his second.
He glanced toward his wife to find her in a rather impassioned conversation with the little Lily about the little girl's snake and decided to keep his own council for the time being. There will be time enough to discuss their son's potential love life, but for now the matter will rest.
From what he heard, if Lily took after her namesake at all, she'd be one of the smartest witches in her year. He wasn't worried about her at all.
"We are somewhat interrelated, aren't we?" Lucius mused. "Perhaps it's time for the pure-bloods to branch out a bit. Get some fresh blood in the family lines." He smirked at Harry's incredulous look and stepped away from the cloth.
The rest of breakfast was served soon after that and everyone ate contentedly. The kids laughed and giggled and regaled their parents with stories from the night before, while Harry and Draco took the opportunity to just enjoy being all together for a quiet, late morning breakfast. They trading knowing looks and tangled their bare feet together under the table.
Narcissa picked up her tea again and sipped lightly at it. "There is not much to tell. They have fallen in love," she said bluntly. "Draco was taken with them from nearly the very moment they all met. And they seem to be equally smitten."
Narcissa’s answering smile was bright, curving widely at her red lips. She nodded, a happy tear slipping past her control. “Most certainly, Andie. Most certainly.”
Giving him a maternal smile, she stroked a green stained hand over his cheek and hair. "Anytime, dear. I don't mind reminding you."
"So, I gave the money to the twins with the proviso that they could have the damned money as long as they bought Ron some dress robes. I didn't really care what they did with it after that."
Hermione was chatting about something complicated and legal with Audrey, while Angelina and Fleur were chattering about something or other he couldn't quite make out. The only men left at the table were Charles and Arthur.
Harry grinned wryly to himself at that thought and patted the pocket of his robes that held the three velvet bags. Today had been... enlightening. Lucius and he had gotten along just fine and neither of them were stabbed to death and left to rot in a vault
Harry watched them leave with a ten ton weight on his chest. He'd let things get this way, he knew, with his all-consuming work, and his extended overseas assignments. There was no one to blame, but himself. He’d ignored Ginny and he’d ignored his kids.
He looked back up at them and smiled. "It looks like she found two entries under the names of Edward Hamilton Dursley and Chrysanthemum Scarlet Dursley in the record book. Looks like they'll be admitted into Hogwarts."
A quick rifling through drawers and a small walk-in closet later, Draco had pulled on a pair of jeans that were just a smidgen big around the waist and a tad long in the leg, and a muggle sweatshirt that smelled like Harry's detergent.
Rolling his eyes, Lucius shifted until Narcissa had rolled over. He pressed against her back wrapping an arm around her waist and holding her closely. He nuzzled into her sweet, flowery scented hair and sighed. "You would think such a ridiculous thing was romantic, Narcissa."
Teddy fearlessly shoved his hand in a large pile of snakes and waited for one to slither up his arm. He didn't have to wait long. Two Dwarf Sunfire Reticulated Pythons
Money was no problem for him or his family, but he couldn't shake the feeling that he should leave more of a legacy behind for his children and his grandchildren. He hadn't even touched most of his money and when he died he wanted to be able to leave his children more than just an empty lot in Godric's Hollow, Grimmauld Place, and a couple piles of cold gold.
"No, of course not, dear," Narcissa cut him off with a dismissive wave. "I did not pack them wine. I simply picked out a few jars of your more popular salves and rubs and maybe a package or two of your tea cookies."
Teddy huffed out a breath and scooted toward the window to make room for James, pushing his irritably sleepy snakes nearly off the bed in the process. "Harry and my grandma got in a fight," he replied quietly so their voices wouldn't travel.
Scorpius wasn't naive enough to believe that his parents had loved each other when they were married, and he could tell that his dad wasn't as happy as he should be. His dad loved him, Scorpius was in no doubt about that, but his dad could be happier. Harry made him happy.
"Good morning, Potter Family," a familiar voice drawled from the doorway. The whole family turned to find Draco and Scorpius watching their entry, one with an amused smirk and the other with an excited smile on their face.
"You were what, fourteen, fifteen, when they opened that blasted shop? How on earth could you have made such a savvy investment that young? Draco was still whining about acne and you at that age." He seemed rather put out at this new information.
“No doubt,” Lucius nodded with slightly vindictive amusement. “That girl is going to put grays in Potter’s hair as sure as the sun rises.”
"I know, Harry. Are you alright?" Draco asked, dropping his lips down to the top of Harry's messy head, his fingers still moving gently through his hair.
Jolted out of his shock, Lucius composed himself and nodded his head regally. “I do not believe we have ever formally met,” he said as he strode toward the two lounging women and shook her hand politely. “Young Theodore speaks of you often.”
Draco turned around giving Andromeda his back and flashed Harry a stiff smile. "Of course, I just got a bit of a shock and dropped the mixing bowl," he answered. "I'm going to check on the kids. The timer should go off in twenty minutes, pull the cookies out, and don't forget to turn off the oven," he threw over his shoulder as he brushed past Harry and disappeared outside.
"This is unacceptable," he sneered coldly. "This is why we keep house-elves, so that things like this don't happen. Shotzy!" he bellowed for the house-elf who was specifically in charge of all of the Manor fireplaces.
It was so different from what he’d had his whole life, what Scorpius had, and they both loved it immensely.
The room went absolutely silent and all the fiery heads turned to stare until Harry and Lily stepped out behind them.
He hissed in annoyance and huffed again, sounding much like a displeased child. “I must have looked there three times! Are you sure?”
"I'll thank you not to tell such lies about your own father, Draco." Lucius sipped at his brandy and crossed his legs in his plushy winged back chair. "I brought you into this world and I can take you out of it," he drawled casually.
“Yes, well,” Draco sniffed, sounding insulted. “Now, I don’t think I could stomach that many people kissing my ass at once. Brownnosers are so déclassé.” He flicked a hand through the air dismissively.
"Enough," a familiar stern voice said from above their heads. "No more of that talk," Hermione ordered. "It's time for dinner and I don't want any sad moping at the table."
"That's what I thought, too," Teddy agreed. "But I'm more worried about why Grandma is so angry with them. Do you think they were really awful during the war?"
"Yep!" Lily grinned guilelessly lifting her snake up in explanation. "Belle was helping me." She was way better at fibbing than the boys were.
When breakfast had been cleared away and the children were looking mightily pleased with themselves, Lucius called for Shotzy.
Before he could answer James turned to his sister. "Mum's not coming home, Lily," he said sneeringly. "She doesn't want us anymore."
A bark of laughter, an ugly unhappy sound, fell from his lips. "I should be thankful she dropped the kids off with her parents before she grabbed the first international portkey available she was that far gone."
Narcissa had her sister over at the Manor for tea and luncheon at least a dozen times since they'd reconnected. Draco and Andromeda had spent a few of those visits getting to know one another.
Narcissa didn't even bother mentioning that they would all end up killing themselves within a year if they had to live that close to Cassiopeia, Lucius's mother, but she did voice her concerns about Draco. "But, Lucius, Draco and Scorpius have lives here. Draco's shop is flourishing and Scorpius has all his friends here. Harry and the children are here."
"Worthless woman," he hissed none too softly to himself. He half expected Potter to defend her, his ex-wife and childhood sweetheart, but all he got was a grimace and slight shake of the head.
Draco stared around from his place with Harry, Ron, Hermione, Percy, and Audrey and smiled. Everyone was mixed and matched and looked comfortable and happy.
After trading tense, awkward introductions, they seated themselves in the wing backed chairs in front of Lucius’s desk. He pulled out all the pertinent papers and documents and various other things, before looking up at his two guests his expression impenetrably business like.
He got a dismissive wave for his troubles as Draco strode across the room. "It's nothing, Potter. Scorpius has been pouting for days now because he hasn't been able to see his Albus." He grinned down at his blushing son before turning back to smirk at Potter's incredulously raised eyebrow. "We're happy to have you."
Albus stared at the handkerchief warily for a moment before he took it and blew his nose. Cleaning up his face he sniffled one last time and offered the handkerchief back to the blond boy.
She smiled sadly at him and tugged his fingers away stroking her hand through his hair. "Don’t beat yourself up, Harry. She was weak and it was her decision to keep quiet. That’s on her."
The rest of the two hours until the Potters and eldest Weasleys arrived went much smoother for all involved. Narcissa was safely ensconced in a hot calming bath with a very distracting Lucius, the house-elves were actually able to get the majority of the preparations done, and Draco got to sneak tastes of the hors d'oeuvres the kitchen elves had begun to set out on the tables.
"Wow. Mr. Malfoy actually went to Azkaban," James breathed, not sure if he was impressed or terrified at the thought.
Soon, they had locked the vault up behind them and were once again in the cart zooming off through the tunnels faster than was strictly healthy.
Except for Teddy's two little snakes, they were all good sized reptiles. Thankfully, the shop attendant informed him that they were pretty well matured. They should stop growing soon so he wouldn’t have to worry about them reaching epic proportions.
"Those children visit Scorpius often, then?" she inquired neutrally, watching Narcissa out of the corner of her sharp gray eyes.
Ron stared at his wife's, his best friend's shaking back completely at a loss. His heart was physically aching and he felt like his throat was so tight that he couldn't breathe, but still he didn't know how to console the woman he loved with all his heart.
"Yeah.” Harry nodded. “Ron seemed pretty accepting actually. He said he was just glad that the kids and I weren't wallowing anymore."
"So we're to have muggles on Saturday," she concluded curiously. "Is there anything I should tell the house-elves about? Nothing muggles can't eat or are allergic to?" she asked with a charming level of ignorance that made Draco smile.
There was much laughing and some more fawning before Harry was able to make it back to Draco's smirking side.
"It's a lizard that changes color for camouflage," Teddy said looking up, trying to see the snake perched on his head.
Calmly, he lowered the paper to the table causing the snake to turn and look at him with annoyed black eyes.
Harry snorted and folded one arm on the table. "And I'm sure he thought you were Bellatrix, as well. I thought you were the first time I saw you."
"Ah, Mr. Potter. To what do I owe this pleasant surprise?" Lucius Malfoy smiled blandly from behind his dark massive desk.
Harry just smiled at that and nodded. "Shall we head for the floos and see if the house-elves at the Manor have finished dinner?"
A tortured look crossed over Harry's face causing Ron to throw his head back and laugh. Definitely too much fun.
Nodding in agreement, Harry gestured for him to follow and led the way back toward the kids, drawing everyone's attention.
"Molly's right, Harry." Arthur finally spoke up. "Despite you being rather absent as of late, what Ginny did was inexcusable. There is nothing that could constitute abandoning her family the way she did." His words cracked with sadness and disappointment, and Harry couldn't really blame him.
Harry grabbed onto James's shoulder warningly before the young boy could launch himself at the older man.
Albus smiled brightly at him and wrapped an arm around his shoulders. "Me too. They make each other happy. We can all see that. And we want to stay together, so what do we have to do to make that happen?" He frowned in determination.
Lucius hummed as he leaned forward to get a better look and tried to decipher the runes circling the staff in equidistant spaced bands. "Unfortunately, my knowledge of the Ogham alphabet is very limited so I’m not quite sure, but I think it's a magical staff. Much like the staffs wizards carried before the time when secrecy became vital for survival and wizards began crafting wands instead."
Harry trudged through Diagon Alley trying to ignore the stares as he pulled Lily along by the hand. James, Albus, and Teddy followed behind laughing and pushing and chasing each other as they went.
Lucius eyed it with restrained disgust, but deigned to give it one shake letting go quickly. "Charmed," he drawled not sounded it at all.
"That's a very pretty name for her, Teddy." Andromeda stepped up and kissed him on the head as she combed her fingers through his messy hair. "Very appropriate as well." She grinned as the red bird hopped onto her grandson's shoulder and began nibbling affectionately at his ear with her black beak.
Andromeda studied him, considering. "I don't know, Harry. You have your hands full with those three, already."
The four Weasleys departed and Harry and Draco were left in the kitchen sipping their tea. Harry still looked worried and doubtful.
Acting quickly on instinct, Draco eased out from under Lily placing a pillow under her head and called for Shotzy.
She felt somewhat naughty, but the last time she’d been in Diagon Alley, she’d stopped off in Flourish and Blotts looking for a new novel to read in her spare time. Little did she know that she would stumble upon the latest romance by Nanna LaNou
"Oh, Mr. Malfoy! Go right in, the Minister's waiting for you," she told him with a slightly apprehensive smile.
A warm smile curved over Narcissa Malfoy's perfect face. "It is quite our pleasure, Mr. Potter. You have charming children," she informed him elegantly.
Harry stepped up next to Draco and wrapped a comforting arm around his waist. "Yes. Freeing a house-elf is more complicated than simply saying it. Some of these elves have served a wizarding family for generations and take pride in their duties. The elves and the wizards are bound by magic that is old and nearly unbreakable. It’s actually cruel to release a house-elf unless they wish to be free."
"Are you sure?" Scorpius asked with pleading eyes. "Because I really want Albus's cousins to like me."
The doorbell to number 12 Grimmauld Place gave a rusty chime and Harry looked up in confusion. Nobody ever came to the front door; they always flooed into the kitchen or apparated to the backdoor.
“Genevieve,” he gasped huskily, his muscular, bare arms wrapping around her. “I couldn’t live if you had died.” And then he kissed her, hands slipping under her clinging wet dress to press into her silky, damp, warm-
Draco smiled at the sight, remembering not too long ago when his son would let him pick him up and carry him to bed. "Well, Potter, I guess that's my cue to get going. It's about Scorpius's bedtime as well." He stood up and straightened his robes.
Narcissa looked at him as if he'd just suggested roasting the peacocks on a spit in the garden for the main course.
But here he was, being granted the privilege of seeing the Malfoys at ease and relaxed, unmasked of their sneers and snobbery. It was really nice, he thought. He felt honored to witness it.
"Ugh. Yes. That horrid woman stuck the damn thing to my drawing room wall with a Dark permanent sticking charm. Took me ages to get the stupid tapestry down." He scowled just at the memory of it.
On reflex Teddy morphed his hair to match the snake's dark orange, gray, and black diamond pattern. He turned to James curiously. "What did they say?"
"I’m not playing at anything, Draco," Harry denied. "It wasn't a game. This isn’t a game. I was just-" he sucked in a shaky breath and ran a hand through his hair, "I was just scared, alright?"
Rolling his eyes, Draco placed a hand each on Albus and Scorpius's backs propelling them forward and into the front entry forcing Potter and his starfish to retreat back into the house.
"You could say that," another aristocratic voice came from behind him. Turning, Harry found Draco watching the scene in front of them with smiling eyes. "It would seem that Lightning has found another favorite to amuse himself with."
He stood up and took a step back motioning for the kids to do the same. He was fully aware of how young wizards and witches often times created destruction when they were first introduced to a wand of any kind.
Harry felt his heart sink heavily into his gut as he stared at his godson with his depressed features and his slumped shoulders. Nova and Stella curled silently around his shoulders as he stepped toward him.
Draco had to roll his eyes again. Of course Harry would teach his five year old daughter how to banish a Bogart.
!" He thrust his arm out hand clasped as if he held a wand ready to conjure up a snake. The kids jumped in surprise. "Out of the tip of my wand, a big black snake burst forward hissing and snapping furiously. It acted like it wanted to eat us."
Malfoy Manor had grown on him in a way that only the Burrow and Grimmauld ever had. It felt lived in, loved, cherished, respected, wise almost. Places like that, places with generations of memories and laughter in them never let go once they adopted you.
Perhaps, they can put their daughter in a better mood, he thought as he strode down the stairs to the kitchen. But then again, probably not.
"It came to my attention sometime ago that you had been required to file a copy of every business transaction and contract you make with the Ministry," the Minister said.
"Good morning, Potter," greeted a balding, pot bellied bureaucrat from the other side of the lift. "Terribly sorry to hear about your wife, lad. Bad business that. And she was so pretty too. Guess us good old English blokes can't compete with tropical drinks, beaches, and boys, eh?" He chortled, obviously pleased with himself.
"No, Teddy will want to be left alone," Harry answered. "He's the kind of kid that won’t talk until he's absolutely ready."
"I don't believe Mr. Malfoy would ever follow such a horrible wizard like Voldemort." Lily scowled, indignant at the very idea.
First, he stepped up to a table and stand filled with armor, swords, spears, daggers, and bows and quivers still filled with arrows. Harry breathed in amazement and ran his gloved hand over the blade of a jeweled sword that eerily resembled the Sword of Gryffindor.
"No, Lucius," Narcissa murmured to him as he reached for the lamp on his side of the bed. He looked at her questioningly. "Leave it on?" she asked quietly, her eyes duller than normal, darker.
"Yes." Lucius nodded. "I beleive that you are even related to the Blacks as well. Here, let me think." He looked upward, gaze distant as if studying something from long ago. "If I remember correctly, Cedrella Black married a Septimus Weasley. They had two or three sons, one of them being your grandfather, Arthur Weasley."
Her mother-in-law sniffed a little at that, but didn't comment further. Like all woman who had mothered a child at one point in her life, she had a soft spot for the eccentricities of youth.
Draco let out a surprised laugh, clearing away the lingering ache that went along with memories of the Tournament. Harry closed his eyes and let himself float on the sound for a moment before opening them again and looking back at Draco.
"Wow." Harry smiled crookedly in awe. "Well, what about us meeting up at your shop, then? How did they engineer that?" he questioned eagerly, definitely more impressed than annoyed.
"Yeah. That's why George knew before you." Harry averted his eyes so he wouldn't have to see the look on Ron's face when he told him this next bit. "I'm part owner in Weasley Wizard Wheezes and Lucius thought it would be a good idea to talk to George about his plan for the business so I could reinvest and help him out if he needed it."
"So, tell me about this young man of yours and then we'll sort out the rest of your problems I know you're still stewing over."
"Are you sure?" Harry panted against his collarbone where he'd been leaving his mark on Draco's pale flesh. "Draco?"
The kids all jumped and snapped their heads around to see Lucius standing there with a mildly disapproving eyebrow raised, fully dressed and arms crossed sternly over his chest.
"Tipsy is sorry, Masters, Mistress," she curtsied nervously, "but there is no more rooms available for Mister Harry Potter, sir."
Taking a deep breath, Teddy rose onto the tips of his toes with the force of it and blew as hard as he could. Every single candle extinguished itself in perfect synchronization.
"That," Harry answered with an excited flush on his cheeks, "is the man I bought Teddy's gift from."
He quickly changed into his borrowed pajamas and immediately appreciated the way the silk felt against his skin. Maybe he'd buy himself a pair next time he went shopping. He wasn’t sure he could go back to his fraying t-shirt and ratty flannel pants after this. Shaking his head he stepped up to one of sinks in the double vanity and unwrapped his brand new toothbrush.
Narcissa glanced over toward the pile of silk pillows and poofs that made up the sitting area the children frequented. "Thank you, Cassiopeia," she replied pleasantly. "The children often like to sit in here and have a light afternoon snack."
Draco stared at him for a moment feeling immeasurable warmth burst in his chest and expand outward. This amazing beautiful man could not have said anything else more perfect to make Draco fall even more in love with him. A stinging hit him in the back of the eyes and he looked away so Harry wouldn't see the shine in them.
"I don't know," James answered, thoughtfully. "I don't think so, I mean they're not in Azkaban, are they?"
"Grandma didn't know that Harry was friends with Draco and that we'd visited the Manor with him," Teddy answered simply.
Molly sighed sadly as she watched the children play. She supposed they weren't really her Ginny's babies anymore. They were Harry's now since Ginny left them. And Teddy, of course, had always been his godfather's pride and joy.
Harry chose not to respond to that. His experience with mothers weren't all that great. Molly, and now Narcissa and the rest of the Weasley women were the exception, but he didn't have as much faith in mothers as he probably should. Aunt Petunia and to some extent Ginny had ruined that for him.
"Your inarticulateness has done absolutely nothing to diminish how terrifyingly happy that sentence just made me." He breathed deeply and squeezed Harry almost painfully tight around the middle. "You really believe that, Harry?" Draco asked hopefully. "That you'd be alright with being a father to Scorpius and you'd be alright with me being a father to your kids?"
"Not, really." Harry smacked an reassuring kiss to his temple. "It was more the 'Voldemort came from Slytherin' thing than anything else."
Harry just nodded. "I guess. I haven't really checked. They opened a separate vault in my name and have been dumping my share in there since the store opened. George asked me if I wanted to buy out half of Fred's share so we could split the profits fifty-fifty, but I didn't want to." He frowned and ran a hand through his hair. "George should have it, you know."
"And four of that 'gaggle of uncouth little children', as you called them, are mine as much as Harry's. You would do well to watch your tongue in regards to them, Grand-mère, because I will not tolerate any of the children that come into this house being treated as anything less than family," he warned her with such intensity that she leaned away from him and raised an eyebrow in surprise.
Snapping their heads around, they saw a shocked Ron and a red faced, tear stained Hermione standing near the doors to the Manor.
"Well, let's move on, shall we?" he suggested forcefully, looking down to read through the rest of the papers. Finally he laid them down and began rubbing at his temples. This agreement was already giving him a headache. He just positively couldn’t wait to get started.
Harry snorted and he looked out the kitchen window to see Teddy directing an ambush on their garden gnome his cousins eagerly hanging off his every word.
"There's a whole wizarding quarter in central London," Harry informed her. "Diagon Alley extends into more of a village than an actual alley. Then there's Knockturn Alley, but that's for the more shady shops." He grimaced. "You don't want to go there unless you have to."
He answer was some sputtering over the line and he burst into laughter. "Haha! Way to go, Big D! How far along is she?"
Draco stepped up to his mother who had been standing there quietly, face deathly pale. "Mother, are you alright?"
Harry huffed in annoyance and bent down to make sure all the boys were unharmed and relatively soot free. "I'm so glad we could entertain you, Malfoy."
Narcissa chuckled and acknowledged that she wasn't serious in suggesting they continue their playing for the night. She wasn't a young woman anymore either.
"You do not have to partake, Mrs. Weasley, if you do not want to," Draco continued, not intimidated in the least by her thunderous look. "But you are in my home and you will not create a scene on Teddy's birthday. If you do not like how this party is being conducted you are free to leave, but if you so much as try to start something with me, my family, or my house-elves in front of the children I will personally escort you out." He leaned closer to her and hissed, "Do I make myself clear?"
Draco didn't know where she was going with this, but he was willing to let it play out. He was curious now that it the situation didn’t seem like it was going to turn unpleasant.
"Okay, now try SSSsssahShhsss," Albus instructed in a tone that reminded Draco of Professor McGonagall.
The next morning Harry sat on his marital bed and stared at his open wardrobe. He wondered if he could really stand up, grab his robes, floo to the Burrow to drop his kids off, and apparate to the Ministry to start another day of work.
This conversation had grown tiring and Narcissa decided to drop the act altogether. Cloying platitudinous conversation had never been her forte anyway.
She scowled and pursed her lips in disapproval causing him to laugh. "Yes. Snakes. Really, Harry, are you sure that was a wise decision?"
Shaking himself out of his thoughts, Draco looked the boy up and down. He was disheveled and still sniffley from crying. Putting away his shock at seeing Harry Potter's son in his store, he stepped forward and crouched down to eye level with the shy little boy.
He sighed and rubbed at his temples. "Very well, very well." He waved a hand at them. "You children are frighteningly perceptive and frighteningly capable. Your fathers have my sympathies."
Frowning, Harry straightened up holding the phone to his ear a little more securely. "Is there something wrong?" he asked in concern.
"But we weren't spying!" Scorpius exclaimed, frantic to minimize the amount of trouble they were definitely in.
Lily leaned against Narcissa and smiled. "Oh good. Daddy said that when people found out about his gift they were scared of him."
Harry watched his expression, his eyes while he spoke. Then he leaned up and captured Draco’s lips in a warm kiss. "I'm glad I testified for you," he declared, their mouths still touching, then he tugged on Draco’s bottom lip with his teeth.
He didn't know what exactly to think about that at the moment. Lucius had long since let go of his resentment and animosity toward the younger man. Especially since Potter was so enmeshed with his family and they now had a business relationship, but it hadn’t occurred to Lucius that Potter would do anything like this for him. For Draco or Scorpius, most definitely. For Narcissa, yes, but for him?
"Me too," Teddy piped in, a good portion of his attention still fastened on the Hogwarts letter his godfather was mulling over. "I get about every two or three words."
She squealed in surprise and giggled even as Draco set her on her feet. "Come with me, darling. Would our Lily-flower like to sit next our Narcissus for breakfast?" he asked grinning.
"Nah, it's alright." He gave her a small smile. "I'll tell you, but you can't tell anyone. My dad doesn't really want everyone to know."
Glancing around the table he saw that everyone was finished with their breakfast. Narcissa was wiping down Lily's syrupy hands with a moist cloth a house-elf had fetched for her. Scorpius and Albus, however, still had melted chocolate at the corners of their mouths.
"Sure thing. This is my wife, Angelina," George gestured to the only dark skinned woman in the room. A pretty girl, Draco remembered, that used to be on the Gryffindor Quidditch team. Draco shook hands with her and gave her a kind if shaky smile.
"Perhaps Potter would be willing to... speak on our behalf once more," he suggested haltingly, reluctant to even hope to consider the idea.
Draco was seeing images of his insane Aunt Bellatrix flashing before his eyes as he looked at this woman. She looked so much like her. Despite that he knew exactly who she was. She was Teddy's grandmother. She was Andromeda Black Tonks.
"No," Lucius muttered in astonishment before he looked over Harry's shoulder and read the words himself. "Good lord, Potter. Do you even know who Ignotus Peverell
How could he say no to that? Really, Draco already knew that he couldn't. "Alright, you bloody manipulator." He scowled teasingly even as he tightened his hold on Harry's hand. "We'll go and have dinner at the Burrow."
"Oh yes!" Luna exclaimed excitedly. "But Daddy and I were having some real trouble getting the funding for research on this one story. It's about a conspiracy to-"
Straightening to address the parents once more, Draco smiled again in welcome. "Hors d'oeuvres and drinks are being served. Alcoholic drinks are available for the adults of course." He winked. "Just ask one of the house-elves for whatever you want and they'll get it for you."
“Stop that, Potter! That is the most disgusting habit I have ever seen.” Draco slapped his hand away from his mouth with a revolted look on his face.
"If Lily can't blackmail you into helping then I'll put toads in your bed, now start reading!" Albus ordered, quite forcefully.
"No, I guess not," he conceded with a wry smirk of his own. "But I’m not here to discuss family heirlooms." Well, not the Malfoy family heirlooms anyway.
They went back to snapping green beans and were soon distracted by other things. Like an excitable toddler showing off a warty toad they'd found in a puddle and an impromptu stick sword fight that resulted in several nasty scraps and flushed laughing faces.
"What I can't believe is that you children are actually spying on your fathers," drawled a darkly amused voice from the other end of the hall.
Draco watched the scene with bemusement. "Yes. The Malfoy house-elves have been bound to my family for centuries. They won't hurt you," he assured them. "They are our servants. They will bring you anything you want to drink or eat."
"I'm so glad you could join us, dear. And this must be Scorpius." Molly released Draco only to bend down and pull his son into a warm hug as well. "You look so handsome," she gushed at him as she smoothed down his robes with freckled motherly hands. "I wish I could have gotten my boys into dress robes more often when they were your age," Molly lamented with a smile.
"You know, now that you mention it," Harry grinned in amusement, "they had been acting really rather suspicious all that day before Belle took off."
Harry snorted and propped an elbow on the table, his chin on his hand. "Yeah. The kids get along really well with his son. They love going over to the Manor to play and his parents are surprisingly good with them as well." He sifted his free hand through the snapped beans absently.
"Tell me how long you’re keeping him so I can pack his bag?" Andromeda looked at Harry’s pleased grin and hoped he knew what he was doing. Trying to take on four kids at once was no small thing.
"Scared?" Draco scoffed. "I was bloody scared too, Harry," he shot back. "In less time than it takes a house-elf to shit, I found myself frustratingly attracted to and embarrassingly smitten with my boyhood enemy. Of course I'm going to be fucking scared out of my goddamn wits, but I'm not the one that decided avoidance was the best way to deal with that!"
“Is turning eleven really that important?” he asked then immediately cringed at the look Draco shot him.
When he got back upstairs, taking care not to trip on the creaky stair third from the top, James whispered to Stella and set her silently on the floor. He waited at the edge of the landing until she gave him the all clear then he snuck past his dad’s room and turned the corner heading up the next flight to the owlery.
Draco stood staring down at the boy, a cold mask painted across his features. James’s hand remained unshaken until his arrogant scowl began to melt reflecting the insecure hurt little boy beneath. His shoulders hunched as he began withdrawing into himself. Suddenly, Draco snatched up the small hand before it could fully retreat and gave it one firm shake.
"That's really amazing," she said, her eyes tracking Teddy through the yard as he once again led the siege against the garden gnome. "Is it just his hair or...?"
"No, Mother," Draco cut her off with a firm frown. "Harry already said that was more than he'd been planning on inviting to begin with. Usually the kids' birthdays consist of them and the Weasleys."
An amused sniff was the only crack in Lucius's mask of polite indifference. "So, it would seem," he drawled. "Is there anything else we need to discuss, Minister?"
Narcissa had to blink back her own tears as her memories came flashing back bringing echoes of all her pain and confusion with them. "I don't know, Hermione," she said. "You will never know, but you will live through it and the pain will ease. It won't ever go away completely, but it will ease. I promise you that."
"Alright, ducklings, but remember stay away from the Rapier Roses, the statue of Poseidon in the back corner, and the Poison Poppies. Really, Mother. Whose idea was it to plant such things in the public gardens?" Draco huffed as the boys all sped off in different directions shouting and screaming at the top of their sugar coated lungs.
Harry was left staring after him feeling stunned and bereft of his presence. Draco had simultaneously enraged him on his behalf and allayed his unvoiced fears. He hadn't even know he'd been afraid that they wouldn’t pull through until Draco had told him they would. Being angered by words from his old school rival was not new but being comforted by them was completely uncharted territory. It left him reeling.
"Got something to hide, Harry?" Ron grinned at him feeling warm and relaxed with the whisky sloshing in his belly.
Ron just shook his head and patted him on the shoulder. "It's alright, mate. If I had known, if any of us had just noticed… We all should have paid more attention. It’s not just on you."
"Yes," Narcissa agreed with a pleased smile on her face. She squeezed her husband lovingly. "It's very romantic."
Harry scowled at him, but leaned into his massaging hand anyway. “It’s not about a party or his presents. It’s more about Andromeda… and Hogwarts.”
Besides, Scorpius never seemed to mind being an only child. Not like Draco had, at least, but maybe he was hiding it. Draco had grown very adept at hiding his loneliness from his parents. After a time, even to a child it seemed cruel to keep asking for something his mother wanted desperately to give, but couldn't.
Days later Harry sat at the picnic table in the Burrow’s backyard snapping green beans while the children ran and chased each other in the field behind the house.
Ron nodded thankfully and walked away to kindly ask the diminutive house-elf for the strongest drink they had.
A gasp was ripped from Draco as Harry gripped his thighs in strong hands and lifted him off the floor pressing him back against his bedroom door. The fury and intensity just ratcheted up one hell of a notch and Draco felt a bit like he was about to be consumed.
A jolt of pain lanced through his chest. James missed his mum. Not as much as he probably should, though, he realized. She’d been there but not, for so long, it was like she’d been gone for a long time before she finally left. He thought he missed the things a mum would do for you, more. Like give you hugs, and make you cookies and pancakes. Like patch you up when you get hurt, and hold you when you're sad. Draco did those things, he realized, and so did his dad, really.
"Alright, Mr. Potter. This investment in Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes, is scarily profitable. I commend you, but you have done absolutely nothing with the money.” He sneered at the revilation. “Have you discussed further developments with Mr. Weasley? Or perhaps offered to reinvest a portion of your profit back into the company, provided you receive it back with interest?"
Frowning, Harry thought about that. It was true. This was the first time Harry had hosted Draco and Scorpius for a play date, but he and the kids had been to the Manor nearly a dozen times. And they’d loved it.
"Of course I bloody well do!" Harry snapped pulling his eyes from the book to glare at Lucius. "I have his bloody Cloak of Invisibility."
"And back in those days Harry and I were horrible rivals. We hated each other," Draco told them as the children's giggles over Snape disarming Lockhart so humiliatingly subsided. "It was no secret just how much we disliked one another, so naturally Snape had to pair us together for the disarming practice."
Discretion being the better part of valor, Draco flashed him an uncertain smile before hesitantly asking the Weasley son, Charles, to pass the peas.
What did he think? Harry frowned in deep thought for a second before breaking into a bright smile. "I think that it's completely amazing."
He laughed and squeezed her again before turning to put the kettle back on the stove to brew more tea. "I'm sorry for not coming to see you both. It's just been really hectic lately."
"Be right with you!" Draco's unmistakable voice called from somewhere in the back of the store behind the counter.
"Gah!" he yelp and jumped back from it with a hand pressed to his pounding heart, the children’s giggles sounding from behind him. "Is it supposed to do that?" he demanded with a scowl at his lover.
"It was our pleasure." Draco waved it off. "I think Mother and Father enjoyed it almost as much as the children did."
"Are you going to show us some?" Eddy asked excitedly from his place next to Albus, Tal stretched out on his shoulders indulgently.
"Ah." Draco nodded and smiled at them reassuringly. "Well, don't worry. You'll be able to jump right back to London when the party's over."
They paused at an odd wooden staff in one of the back corners of the room, Harry looked at it curiously.
Then everything had gone quiet. So quiet. He had sneaked away from his Grand-mère's side and crept up to his mother's birthing room. What he'd seen there he would never forget.
You can have two dads, he decided. And if one of those dads can have babies, then that's just an added bonus.
Turning back to Albus's hand's Draco looked them over before pulling a handkercheif from his own pocket and wiping the salve away. "You're all done, Albus. Check them over and tell me if I missed a spot."
Everybody knew that stuff though. Grandma-Molly had told them the stories about Harry and Uncle Ron and Aunt Hermione while they were in school. A lot of the really bad stuff, a lot of the stuff about the Death Eaters and what it was like during the war was never talked about, though.
Some time later, Narcissa and Lucius collapsed against each other, sweat slicking their skin and breath panting hotly from their swollen lips.
"I beg your pardon?" The man looked like he was trying to decided whether he was more insulted or confused. By the tone of his voice, Harry guessed he chose insulted.
Narcissa nodded approvingly. That had been part of the problem that the Death Eaters had been fighting against in the beginning… before everything went pear shaped that is.
Draco sighed internally and resigned himself to being continuously charmed by Potter children. He had to admit that despite how much he'd wanted to punch him in the face during school, Saint Potter made cute kids.
Harry frowned and was about to ask what he meant, but Lucius's study door opened to reveal the man himself waiting for them.
This was one of Molly's favorite days because it usually brought all of her thirteen grandchildren together and gave her an excuse to cook for more than just her and Arthur.
They stayed in awkward quiet for several moments before Narcissa finally turned to look at her sister head on. “I have gotten to know your grandson, Teddy,” she said with a genuine, if small, smile. “He is a lovely boy. So very sweet and –hm- quite precocious as well.”
His mind was turning that over until an echo of his grandmother saying those things about Miss Cissy and Mr. Malfoy made him scowl. He'd known that Narcissa and his grandmother knew each other, had guessed that much at least, but he hadn't even considered that they'd be sisters. Why didn't they like each other anymore? Why did his grandmother hate her family so much?
Huffing in mild frustration, she called for a house-elf and ordered her tea and cakes. She would enjoy herself no matter what. She was resolved. Of course it never hurt to have a little help.
"Good lord. Lucius, you've created another hazard in my gardens! Take those wards off before they hurt themselves!" Narcissa cried in despair as she watched Lily go flying only to land in an elephant ear patch and bounce back up with a wide grin on her pretty face.
When he did realize Dudley and his wife were looking just a wee bit panicked he grimaced apologetically. "It'll be alright, Dudley. If they go to Hogwarts, they'll be there with my kids and the Weasleys. They won't be alone. You have plenty of time to prepare for it."
Narcissa sipped at her tea. She prayed that her son, should he be- should he eventually choose to carry a child would not have the same difficulties she had.
"Right, and I know who you are, as well. You are Andromeda Black Tonks," he replied, pulling out his wand and vanishing the ruined cookie mix from the floor with a sharp flick. "You’re the forgotten Black sister. Disowned for marrying the muggleborn, Theodor Tonks. I know who you are," he finished, voice growing frostier with every word.
"I'll do it," James volunteered scrambling to his feet. "I can sneak downstairs and grab Stella to keep watch on Dad's door, then, while I sneak up to the owlery to grab Artemis, Al can write the note to Scorpius."
James fidgeted hesitantly then nodded. "Yeah, we can speak it," he said. "Though, not as good as Albus. Me and Lily have to practice."
Dudley lifted his head, a flash of hope shining in his still somewhat beady eyes. "How do we do that?"
There were several gasps from the gathering children and adults as everyone stared raptly at the bird and Teddy. "She's amazing," the little boy murmured in awe as he lifted a hand and stroked it down her back gently.
Scorpius looked down at the snake in his lap and felt the sharp pang of longing in his chest. He'd always wanted siblings so badly and now he just might have a chance to get them. But it wasn't just brothers and a sister he would be getting. He would be getting another father as well in Harry.
"Oh." His mother sounded slightly faint. She went back to staring raptly at the boy as he entertained the other kids with morphing his nose into odd amusing shapes. It made Draco want to rub his own nose in sympathy, but of course the children found it to be absolutely hilarious.
and he’ll flounder.'"  Draco spoke low and drawling, his voice sound eerily similar to the late Potion Master's.
Half an hour later, Harry had his floo illegally hooked to Dudley's and after repeated reminders to say the address clearly, Dudley, Eddy, Chrissy, and a just visibly pregnant Marianne all stumbled through his floo.
He went back downstairs to find Albus in the library trying to translate one of his favorite books to Parseltongue so that Tal would understand it. Lily was sprawled on her belly in the living room chatting about girly things with Belle. James and Teddy were in the backyard playing some game with Mischief, Nova, and Stella.
"Hey, Scor!" James grinned and patted the smaller boy on the back as if they hadn't completely engineered this meeting. "Long time no see."
The owl nipped affectionately at Harry’s ear and held out his leg with McGonagall's return missive attached.
Rosie stepped forward with her bushy red hair and a bright grin on her face. "Yes, Mr. Malfoy! Will you have a piñata?" she asked hopefully.
Narcissa and Andromeda met each other’s gazes and burst out laughing. Husbands really were lost without their wives to keep them headed in the right direction.
And they did. They read all through the rest of Lucius's entry and then started on Draco's without stopping until they hit the end of that one too.
Dudley dropped his elbows heavily on the kitchen table and tiredly rubbed at his face. "Well, when she was a baby toys would go flying across the room, but you know how kids throw things, so we never thought much about it. The other day, though," he bit his lip, "Eddy was picking on her about something, he would just not stop and finally she got so upset she suddenly disappeared."
Draco snorted in amusement and curled closer around him. "I said stop moving, not stop breathing,” he said voice rough with sleep.
"Yes, Draco." Harry looked into his bright gray eyes. "I would love to think about having children with you." He leaned in once more and captured Draco’s lips open mouthed and hot.
Flooing to the Manor the next day took some juggling. Lily went as Harry's barnacle as usual, Teddy and James came in behind them, leaving George with Albus to pop through last.
"Did you finish the letter?" he asked as he flopped back down in his spot on the floor, Artemis abandoning him to perch on the footboard of Teddy's bed.
Stumbling out of the fireplace and into an elegant Welcoming Parlor, Harry set Lily on her feet then turned as the floo flared again to help James and Albus out of the grate.
Harry took his time teasing and preparing him until Draco's chest was heaving with the effort to take in air and his highs were quivering and sweaty. Leaning forward he nuzzled Draco's throbbing, red member drawing a needy whimper from deep in his throat.
The sun was just lightening the sky when Teddy was jolted awake by Artemis pecking gently at his head. Groggily, the little boy untangled himself from the other children and closed the window behind the bird before untying Scorpius's reply and patting the owl tiredly on the head.
"Ah, finally. Do have a good morning, gentlemen," Lucius called over his shoulder as he stepped off the lift and strolled down the hall leaving a lift filled with gob smacked Ministry employees behind.
After hugging, kissing, and ushering all the kids out toward the gardens, Draco straightened up to welcome the adults.
He grunted and pulled harder, but the drawer didn't budge an inch. He jiggled it and yanked, but nothing happened. Finally he grabbed it with both hands and braced a foot on the desk leg. He pulled so hard he thought his arms would pop off.
"No! We weren't trying to spy on you, Grandpa!" cried Scorpius. "Honest! We were looking for information about Teddy's grandmother," he blurted, then promptly slapped a hand over his mouth, eyes wide. He wasn’t supposed to say that! His grandfather could always make him tell him anything he wanted with just a look.
"Molly," Harry interrupted from where he stood at the kitchen counter. "I think it would be best to take the kids home. They've been away for too long as it is."
Marianne's eyes pinched around the edges with sadness and flicked over to Teddy. He was bent double in laughter as Eddy tried to run away from the gnome as it chased him brandishing a stick at the back of his knees.
This was all just too much, Draco decided. He was falling in love with Potters left, right, and center, big and small, and it was obvious his son was there right along with him. The falling was painless, it was the landing that could kill you.
"Draco, what are you eating?" Harry scrunched up his nose in disgust as Draco slathered his pancake in mustard.
Harry shrugged. "Could be by this evening, or a couple of days depending on how busy she is. It's the middle of the spring term, so I imagine she's busy with the OWLs, NEWTs, and other exams."
Draco quirked an eyebrow at that. "You wouldn't mind if one of your kids got Sorted into Slytherin?"
"Not better,” Hermione shook her head, but was able to give the older woman a tremulous smile. “Not better, but getting there."
There was a short silence before Cassiopeia seemed to shrug off her insincere, pleasant mask and returned to her arrogant, conceited, viscous self.
"Whatever," James scoffed pushing away from the table. "If he really wanted us, Lily, he wouldn't be gone all the time," he told his her with the conviction of an all knowing older brother. "Come on, let's go to bed."
Ron's face cleared and his nodded understandingly. "She does that, doesn't she?" Then he frowned. "How come George knew
"I don't know about that, Albus. Being a Parselmouth is an inherited gift. It would be very difficult, if not impossible, to learn," Draco said as calmly as you please. Harry almost fainted.
The two men watched her stare at one particular wall for a moment, not knowing exactly what to say until she blinked and turned her blue gaze back on Lucius. "Your home is much less itchy than it was," she told him. "I like it much better than I did last time."
"Now that we are all relatively comfortable, why don't you start at the beginning," he suggested not unkindly.
Draco was about to tell her nothing when Harry beat him to it. "It's a host's gift, Molly, for you and Arthur," he answered, grinning when his lover shot him an annoyed scowl.
Narcissa chuckled too, seemingly not noticing anything odd with his reply. She tilted her head toward her son. "Draco is the exact same way. I'll find him nodding off at nine thirty on the settee if I don't remind him to head up to bed."
"Alright," Harry sighed as he lifted Lily into his arms prepared to floo home to Grimmauld Place. He couldn't help, but feel reluctant to leave as well. "Say goodnight."
Eventually he admitted that it was a good idea and agreed to send the information he’d requested. Tea finished and decision made, George said goodbye and flooed back home.
"Teddy!" He opened his soapy arms for the little boy as he came running at him. "How are you, little Moony? Gosh, you're getting so big!" Harry lifted him up into the air and squeezed him tight.
He'd gone to Gringotts the day after his conversation with Draco and requested the goblins give him a financial statement from each and every one of his vaults; Potter, Black, and WWW respectively.
Only stopping when they were almost nose to nose, Harry had the fleeting thought that he was actually a couple of inches taller than Draco, then the entirety of his attention was taken up by something much more important. Smiling slowly, he raised his hands, cradled Draco’s cheeks, and threaded his fingers into that silky silver hair.
Teddy, James, Albus, and Scorpius all traded meaningful looks as they put away the game before their fathers could ask any more questions.
"What?" Albus didn't have any more time to protest because Scorpius snagged his wrist and dragged him to the back of the store.
"She gets picked on," Dudley confided. "At school the other kids make fun of her because she's quiet and probably a little weird now that we know that she's actually pretty prone to -um, accidental magic?- right, accidental magic. Half the fights Eddy gets into are him defending his little sister. I'm really amazed he's won all of them considering he takes after his mother in the looks department."
The kids trailed after him completely absorbed by their new pets. They didn't see how people gasped as they walked past or how the other shoppers cleared a path for them. It was almost like when the war had first ended and everyone was in awe of the Savior except decidedly more alarmed.
Next to Harry, George snorted, but smothered his chuckles to keep their presence secret ’til the end of the story.
Draco had known they were familiar, friends even, but he hadn't realized that they were quite that close.
"Oh, did you boys hear the story?" she asked innocently, but her keen blue eyes took in Harry's pale face and panicked expression. "The children asked Draco to tell the story of how you discovered that you were a Parselmouth," she said mildly.
"Well, hello there." He smiled softly. "You are a very pretty young lady. A bit flushed and snuffly, but lovely nonetheless. Here darling, blow." He produced handkerchief from out of nowhere and held it up to her nose in a practiced move. She gave a great little girl blow and he scrunched his own nose at her in amusement wiping up the rest of the snot from her upper lip before pulling the cloth away
"Alright," Draco breathed, turning his face to press his lips against Harry's temple, inhaling his scent; sweat and spice and earth and Harry. "So I haven't done that in a while. Not in so long that I don’t remember it being quite that intense."
Lifting his head from Draco's chest for a moment he stared into his dilated, hungry gray eyes and nodded, his own eyes reflecting back just as much hunger and need.
"I do believe that you are asking questions you already know the answer to, Cassiopeia," She said making the other woman flick her eyes toward her sharply. "Harry's ex-wife abandoned their children and retreated into seclusion on an island in the West Indies. Since shortly after, Harry and Draco have grown to be friends and are, in fact, seeing each other romantically. Do not trifle with my patience and playact ignorance. We both know you read the gossip columns from front to back."
"It is a longer journey," Draco commented with amusement plain on his face. "I'm Draco Malfoy," he introduced holding out his hand.
Both women shared a highly entertained look as Lucius wrinkled his nose beleaguered at the very thought.
"Is that true?" Lily asked after a moment of silence, her tiny voice hesitant. "You don't really want us?"
The lift doors opened and Harry ushered his embarrassed kids out of the small compartment leaving a sputtering Peters and several speechless Ministry officials behind them.
Draco popped from his seat as if pushed and quickly strode toward her, kissing her cheek lightly. "Grand-mère, I hope your Portkey travel was satisfactory?" he inquired out of obligation.
They made the rest of the journey to the gardens companionably. Draco answered any questions they had and pointed out various magical items they might find interesting. The problems didn't start until they actually stepped out of the house.
Chuckling he stroked a hand over her fiery hair. "You are a charmer, darling. Be sure to keep your dad on his toes, alright?" He grinned at her, his eyes gaining an extra mischievous sparkle when Potter glared at him.
Bill noticed as well, but paid it no mind. "Hey, Draco. It's good to meet you finally. Ron tells us you're the reason our Harry's not moping anymore," he commented congenially.
It was turning out to be a really pleasant day. Draco Malfoy and his bright laugh and charming smile had barely crossed his mind the entire time they had their ice cream. The trend followed him all the way through their wandering towards Quality Quidditch. Of course, he should have known his uneventful day wouldn't last for long.
A contented sigh escaped Draco as his eyes slid half closed. "So, you'd want to think about having more kids with me, then?" he pressed as Harry continued to pepper his mouth with little kisses.
"Uhmum-mum-mumm!" she taunted. "You said a bad word, I'm going to tell on you," she grinned slyly, "
Shaking his head, Harry moved on from the armor and wondered off toward an ornately carved chest of drawers. The wood was warm and smooth under his hands. Beautiful faeries, howling wolves, and elegantly sweeping vines were carved into the chest making it whimsical and mesmerizing. He absently pulled open a drawer only to gape at its contents.
Teddy has to know why his grandma is so unhappy that he’s spending time with the only blood family he has left. James, Lily, Albus, and Scorpius are going to help him with that.
"That's great, Luna," Harry interrupted as kindly, and quickly, as possible. "You can tell me about it when we meet, alright?"
They made it into Grimmauld Place with a minimum of fuss and were soon ushering the children up the stairs and into the bathroom to wash their faces and brush their teeth before they were tucked snugly into their beds, the lights turned off.
Scorpius just snorted. "You thought that was scary? Try being there when my grandmama gets angry. Not even my grandfather sticks around for that."
Draco felt tears start to well up in his eyes as he remembered, as well. The screaming had been frightening. His Grand-mère had kept him in another wing of the manor, tried to distract him. He'd been scared for his mother and scared for his little brother or sister. It didn't sound like it should have; all that pain.
Eventually, Cassiopeia shrugged it all off and waved her hand through the air dismissively. "Very well, Narcissa. Our family owes Harry Potter lives and life-debts. I will play nice," she said. "The Gaunts never were any good stock. I never understood what Lucius saw in that interloping half-blood of theirs anyway."
Harry took a set, as did Lucius who didn't hesitate to pull the gloves on and make a fist repeatedly with each hand. Watching, Harry did the same hoping that they would fit only to feel them shrink down to fit like a second skin around his hand. Amazed, Harry wiggled his fingers and smiled in delight.
He passed it to James to sign, then Teddy, and Lily, then it finally passed back to him. Albus folded it in thirds then thirds again like he'd seen his dad do loads of times. Then sealing the folds with a sparkly unicorn sticker he'd stolen from Lily the week before, he carefully tied it to Artemis's leg. The owl was given instructions to take the letter directly to Scorpius and peck on his window until he opened it.
"Oh, yes." Cassiopeia nodded and smiled falsely. "That's right. How generous of his wife to take in another woman's child. I do assume that young Teddy's parents are dead, yes? Mrs. Potter must be a kind woman."
Harry just looked at her in surprised confusion. Ron was supposed to be the loud naysayer, she was supposed to be the voice of reason.
Draco and Harry, of course, had no idea that their children were about to start plotting against them. All they knew was that in each other's company they were the happiest they’d had been in a long time.
Drying his hands he moved back to the kitchen table and took a seat across from her. Not for the first time Harry was struck by just how much she resembled her insane dead sister. He brushed the thought aside and focused on her words.
Lucius took a deep breath and pierced each child with a stern glare. "I want an explination, every single detail." The kids sat close mouthed, completely petrified. "Now!" he barked.
"It would appear so." Draco nodded his lips quirking up as well. "He plied the boy with homemade cookies and nonstop chatter.” Draco gave him a soft smile. “Albus is a sweet kid, Potter."
Audrey seemed extremely thankful for his question. "I work in the Department of Feminine Issues and Lobbying."
They shook hands and Lucius was out of the office and into the lifts before he fully registered what had happened. He'd just spent the last twenty minutes with the Minister of Magic and he wasn't on trial or under suspicion or having his freedom revoked.
Draco's heart gave a painful beat against his ribs causing him to gasp and wrap his arms around Harry's neck, holding on tightly. "Thank you," he whispered against Harry's neck. "Thank you."
While receiving excited comments and more inquiries from the rest of the family, Draco was a little taken aback by the intense and slightly suspicious stare Fleur sent his way. He gave Harry a questioning look only to receive a shrug and an eye roll in answer. Apparently, Fleur eyeing people like that was not an odd occurrence.
"Okay, right." He rolled his eyes and continued. "Dad said that Sirius was my cousin through Grandma, so we should start looking at the Black family."
Once the children were happily settled, Narcissa looked over them with benignly smiling eyes and inquired, "Tell me, dears, what did your forays into espionage uncover about your fathers?"
It was a valid objection, Lucius had to admit. If they were to up and move to a totally new country they would all be leaving behind their home and their lives. He knew Draco and Potter were quite attached and the children's hearts would be broken if they all had to be separated.
"Oh. Well -um- just keep working at it, then. Sorry for yelling." He scooted down in his chair and tried to hide his heated face behind his whisky.
Chuckling, Draco schooled his face into seriousness and returned the nod. "Of course. Wouldn't taste the same otherwise."
The Malfoys traded panicked looks only to be bowled over once again as the Minister strode over to his wife and leaned closer to examine the razor sharp petals of one blood red rose. "Well, look at that," he murmured with a smile on his lips. "This is one of the rarest species of Rapier Roses alive. How did you get these?"
Once everything was finished, the appetizers all set out, the garden lit with fairy lights and glowing miniature stars, the tables covered with casual tablecloths, and the house-elves stationed discreetly around the perimeter with waiting trays of food and drinks, the guests started to arrive.
"An invasion of privacy, I agree," Lucius interrupted, still smirking darkly. "I am the only Death Eater free of Azkaban that was not marked before their majority. It is obvious they are keeping a rather close eye on me."
"It’s broken, Narcissa," Harry repeated sounding just as surprised. "It worked fine this morning, but just now it wouldn't send us home."
Abruptly, Draco's whole demeanor changed. He was once again the easy charming man he'd been standing in Harry's front entrance those nights ago.
Harry realized suddenly where his eyes had been glued for the last five minutes and snapped them down to his delicate porcelain tea cup. Sipping at it he tried to cover up his momentary lapse in attention.
The lift finally stopped at the Atrium and Lucius just shook his head as he stepped off not wanting to think on it any longer. It would only make him confused and edgy. At least he would have good news to tell Narcissa during their lunch.
Harry smiled apologetically. "I would like that, yeah. George doesn't really have a problem with him and your mum's alright with it."
"Hm?" He glanced up and focused on her. "Oh, yes. I'm fine, just getting a little tired I suppose. I'm used to going to bed when the kids do now." He gave a strained chuckle hoping to cover his awkwardness.
"Oh, well, we lobby for funding of different charities that help woman and funding for medical research and things like that," Audrey told him as she took a bite of her asparagus with obvious relish.
"What on earth have they done to this hall?!" the cultured, feminine voice shrieked in outrage. "This wallpaper is atrocious! And that tapestry is a travesty."
She felt numb, but Andromeda knew that in the end it was probably for the best. As Teddy’s godfather, Harry was fully within his rights to claim full custody of him. And Teddy loved it at Grimmauld. Teddy loved Harry. And despite her angry words, Andromeda knew deep down that there was no place safer for him than with Harry.
“What do you mean?” Draco shrugged and picked up his tea cup with his free hand. “You throw him a birthday party and give him extravagant gifts. Isn’t that what you did for his other birthdays?”
"So, what you're saying is that Lucius is using his retirement from being evil dark wizard minion to seek new and improved ways of earning more money," Harry summed up his words a little bit slurred. Damn, two of those minty drink things was really one too many.
Leaning forward, Lucius looked at the Minister trying to find any duplicity or deception in his expression. He could find none.
A short planning session later, the five of them were sneaking down the stairs to the second floor. Scorpius went first, seeing as how he knew where to go, then Albus, Lily, James, and last, Teddy. They crept through the hall in a straight line constantly looking left, right, and over their shoulders for any sign of Lucius or anyone else that might give up their game.
James's tears continued to fall for a few more moments then he began to pull away. Harry still held onto James’s shoulders as the boy wiped the rest of his tears away with the back of his hand.
Lucius just smirked wryly. "Yes. He was a gift for Draco before he started Hogwarts. I believe the beast's original name was Ginger Snap."
Blowing out a breath, Ron gave him a small shake of the head. "It's alright, mate," he said again. "I probably wouldn't have taken any of this great if you'd told me right off the bat. Frankly, I'm surprised at how well I'm taking all this, now. I guess you just picked a good night to come clean." He grinned at him, eyes dancing with tentative humor.
James smiled back and stepped into the room, closing the door behind him. "Hey. What happened today?" James asked, brow furrowed in concern.
Narcissa frowned in innocent concern. "Draco didn't keep you up, I hope. I remember he used to be an appallingly active sleeper as a child. All arms and legs everywhere."
Harry and Draco contemplate wizarding houses and eleventh birthdays. While the Black sisters finally have a conversation and Lucius is harassed by house-elves and a ministry summons.
George’s eyes widened a little at the expression on Lucius’s face like he didn’t know if he should be afraid or not. “That’s good?”
"What do you think went wrong?" Albus asked, a puzzled frown wrinkling his face. "Stella said they seemed happy."
"I know well what would have happened to Teddy back then. Maybe even better than you, Andromeda. But this isn't the war,” Harry said sternly. “The war's been over for a decade and Teddy has never suffered a single disparaging remark or dirty look from those people while under their roof," he informed her, voice dangerously deep, before his face contorted into an indignant scowl. "And how dare you suggest that I would ever subject Teddy -or my own children for that matter- to a situation that was even remotely dangerous or unwelcoming to them?"
"When he got up there, Lockhart demonstrated some completely ridiculous technique for blocking spells and your dad didn't have a clue as to what to do. I was busy laughing evilly to myself when Snape leaned down and whispered in my ear, 'Draco, why don't you give the Wonder Boy something to be afraid of? Cast
They degenerated into comfortable silence once more, each of them with different things on their minds.
He wanted to leave them something that even if they decided not to get a job, they would still have to work at maintaining their assets. That was a job in and of its self.
"I'm a matris," Draco explained a bit nervously. "I can bear children. I can get pregnant and give birth to an infant. I can have babies." He clarified, rushing through and rephrasing perhaps more than he needed to.  Harry seemed to understand him just fine, but that wide eyed unicorn in spotlight look was not reassuring.
Seeing the reddening looks on their faces, Draco decided to interrupt the father-son bonding moment before it devolved into tears on either side."Come on, Potter. Don't be so hard on the kid. He spent most of the afternoon stuffing his face with cookies in my shop with Scorpius. Nothing happened to him. He's perfectly fine. No reason to sick Granger on the poor boy."
"We're friends now," Harry replied earnestly, begging his best friend to understand. "He kind of pulled us out of the limbo we'd been stuck in since Ginny left."
That was all Harry needed to hear. Teddy had some problems when he was younger adjusting to the fact that he was different. Even though he couldn't talk to them, maybe having snakes that knew he could change and appreciated that would help him feel more comfortable.
Later that night after Andromeda had gone, Narcissa was seated at her vanity brushing out her hair while Lucius was pulling off his socks and unbuttoning his cuffs getting ready for bed. She hummed a little tune under her breath and leaned toward the mirror to examine herself for any new wrinkles.
Harry blushed again. "He was trying to teach Scorpius to say, 'SSSsssahShhsss', which means 'the sun is warm on my rock'. What Scorpius actually said was a mixture of gibberish with an ass and bollocks thrown in there."
"Uh... No?" Harry looked back at him with a grimace. Now that he mentioned it that did seem like a good idea.
Call him a coward, but he was dead scared of what might be growing between him and Draco. Just being friends with him was amazing and the prospect of furthering that relationship to something more, something that Harry had little to no experience with, his marriage notwithstanding, was beyond debilitating.
Maybe they were acting a little like horny teenagers, but with their mouths fused and their groins pressed achingly tight together neither Harry or Draco could bring themselves to care. The kids were asleep in their rooms in the Manor and Draco’s parents were discreetly nowhere to be found.
Narcissa crawled toward him slowly, until she was nearly on top of him and had her face completely hidden in his neck. She felt his strong, sure arms wrap tightly around her and she felt old tears and old sobs rising to the surface once again.
Setting spells for automatic clean up and food and water replenishing completed the finishing touches and Harry soon deemed himself finished.
“Usually a child’s parents will have a gift from both of them, something they can take to school with them. Something they would have for years to come,” Draco explained.
"Thank you, Mr. Malfoy," George replied, sounding wary in his neon lime green suit and his coordinated fuchsia waistcoat and tie. "Fred had more of a head for it than I do."
Harry stared at him for a moment, flashes of memory zipping through his head. The feel of silky silver blond hair between his fingers, the sound of Draco's laughter in the air, the press of soft, firm lips against his own, that weightless feeling in his chest every time Draco smiles at him.
"Blond, dear-heart," Narcissa corrected kindly before she handed Lily a cookie still fussing over the little girl's dirt smudged dress. "Yellow hair is called blond, but thank you, that's really sweet."
"I did." He smiled down at her and shifted her ’til she was sitting sideways so he could see her face. "She's very pretty. Did you pick her out all on your own?"
Mind stunned blank with the surprisingly lack of hostility, Draco took his hand and shook on reflex. "Good of you all to welcome us," he said, sounding slightly dazed.
"Hm? Oh, yes, yes. Leave. Be gone with you, hellions." Lucius chuckled waving them off with a casual hand. "Though I will caution you on any future plots that may involve attaining more siblings," he added with a mischievous smirk. "I highly doubt either of your fathers will need any manipulating on that score."
Another laugh barreled out of him and Harry was feeling so much better than when they had started this. Dragging a hand through his bangs, he smiled again. "Come on, then. Let's keep looking through these books. I think I might just want to take the journals with me so I can read through them."
The warmth he’d been feeling abruptly fled and Harry had to swallow the lump that started to form in his throat. “I don’t know. I haven’t thought about it.”
That just made Teddy laugh harder. "Hey, Al, Scor! Jamie is it!" He was met with a chorus of groans.
"Oh." Ron didn't seem to know how to respond to that. "That makes sense, I guess," he hedged. "At least now I know why they wouldn't ever let you pay for anything."
He straightened on of his shirt cuffs in agitation and flipped his long, silver hair back over his shoulder. “The children came up with the plan to bribe one of our house-elves to disable the floo stranding the Potter family at the Manor over night. As I’m to understand it, they believed that if they forced their fathers to spend the night together they would fall in love.”
Hearing that, Harry was surprised too. Eddy was fierce to be sure, but he was also thin and short. He wasn't built at all like his dad; stocky to the point of fat and tall.
Ever since breakfast, James had been plastered to his side and Harry had to admit he was worried. The boy went from practically shunning him to being his own personal barnacle. Not that he minded. He somewhat missed the days when James had been his first little starfish before Albus and Lily were born. James had always been so independent, though, and those days were over too quickly. It was disconcerting to see him regress for the last couple of hours.
“Yes! Yes! Don’t stop!” Genevieve gasped, gripping his arms tightly as he thrust his big, thick, hot, throbbing-
"Believe it, Lily," Albus shot back bluntly. "Dad didn't deny that the Malfoys were Death Eaters and it says it right here that he was caught red-handed at the Battle of the Department of Mysteries."
He returned it and caressed her soft cheeks adoringly. "Goodnight, my dear." They curled up together, the room now dark and quiet. It took them both a long while before they actually slept.
"Why are you telling me this?" Harry asked the other man after a long moment of contemplating the growing surreality of his life.
After being assured once again that there was no noxious smell, and that the main course would be on the table soon, Draco retreated from the kitchen and made his way back up to the party.
Harry just snorted and munched on a slice of cheese. Give Lucius Malfoy his money so he becomes his financial adviser? Well, it was a thought. The Malfoys certainly were rich enough. Lucius must be doing something right.
Rolling his own eyes, Harry propped his arm on his armrest and set his chin in the palm of his hand. "The kids don't like to stay at the Burrow for very long without me and I don't feel comfortable leaving them here without me or Draco to help them incase they get anxious."
He hummed in pleasure. "I'm pleasantly exhausted." A smile curved at Draco’s lips as he glanced out over the gardens once more to see his parents slow dancing in the shadows to their own music.
"Let's discuss this inside, Potter. The muggles are starting to stare. Of course, you would live in a muggle neighborhood." Draco rolled his eyes and closed the door behind him as if he owned the place.
"Almost everyday." Narcissa smiled serenely back at her, but her eyes had an edge to them. "The children have become quite close over the last few months. They do so enjoy their time here at the Manor," she gushed airily.
A laugh barreled out of Lucius echoing through the vault. It sounded nice. Harry had never heard the man truly laugh before -evil maniacal laughter and dry chuckles didn’t count- but this one sounded nice. It was easy to see where Draco got his own warm laughter from.
Scorpius stepped out of the birds of paradise only to hear a menacing hiss from underneath his foot. He looked down and let out a frightened scream.
"I never said he was," Ron raised his hands in defense. "I'm just saying that I wouldn't have picked him if someone asked me. Then again I wouldn't have picked any other guy either."
"I believe so, yes." Narcissa smiled blandly. "Abraxas was much more agreeable than Cassiopeia in that respect." She sipped her tea and reflected on just how much she truly disliked Cassiopeia Malfoy (née de Vil).
Teddy giggled and continued to pet the bird gently as the other children gathered around him asking to touch and stare at his knew pet in awe.
Harry freed the owl of the letter quickly conscious of Dudley and Marianne's intently watching as he cracked the Hogwarts seal and unfolded it. As he read, Artemis flew off his shoulder to land on the arm of Marianne's recliner and beg pets from her.
"Are you? A Matris I mean?" Albus asked tentatively reaching over and grabbing his friend’s hand in reassurance.
Smiling slightly, Harry nodded and relaxed, leaning his hip against one of the jewelry cases. "The kids missed you and Scorpius," he told Draco, quietly. "I missed you and Scorpius."
Lucius's eyebrows rose into his hair line and Harry stared at the elf in shock. Luna had found the unplottable Manor and rang the doorbell as if it were any other home she'd been invited to. A surprised snort of laughter escaped him and he quickly smothered it when Lucius turned a sharp scowl at him. Only Luna, only Luna.
"Sirius," James muttered, sounding slightly confused and far away. "Mischief wont tell my why they all call me that though. She calls me Dog Star, too. "
"No. He lives with his maternal grandmother. I would like him to live with us, but she likes to hog him." He grinned, trying to return some lightness to the conversation. "He does come and stay with us as often as he can, though."
Shooting a speculative glance toward Draco, Harry watched the soft smile on his face as he too watched the children get sun kissed and covered in dirt.
Harry thought about how that was just one more clue to Ginny’s issues he’d missed. Then he brushed the echoes of old guilt aside and turned his attention back to more pleasurable pursuits. Latching his lips on the corner of Draco's jaw, he nibbled and licked the soft skin there.
Lucius watched him a moment before he nodded, "Certainly," and stepped out to get the other bag from the goblin.
Taking in his lover’s nervous tics and his worried frown, Draco placed a hand on his shoulder and gave him a comforting squeeze. “What’s bothering you? You’re twitching like a potion junky.”
"Give up, Potter," Draco drawled from his previously silent seat on the stone patio floor. "You aren't going to win this one. I suggest you just give in now and save yourself the headache."
"Oh. Well." She struggled for something tactful to say then finally gave up. "Have you always liked men as well, then?"
Squeezing Albus's hand still holding his own, Scorpius continued. "Voldemort kept two of Dad's classmates and Ollivander, the wand maker, in the dungeon. It was Dad's job to guard and take care of them. At one point, your dad and Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger were captured and brought here. Dad was forced to identify them to make sure it was really them before they were handed over to Voldemort, but Dad said he couldn't really tell if it was them or not.
Hermione lifted her head and stared into the darkness around them unseeingly. "I just keep asking myself, why? What did I do that would have caused it? How could I have let it happen?"
Harry snorted in guilty amusement before schooling his expression and pulling back from Draco's embrace. "We'd better get out there and keep the kids from eating all the appetizers before the party even starts."
"I know." Ron sighed again. "She's gone round the bend and I can't figure out why." They sat silently for a bit. Then Ron shook head and took a deep breath visibly shoving his own problems to the back of his man. He fixed his blue eyes back on Harry desperate for a change of subject. "So, you and Malfoy then?"
Her voice rang with finality, making the older woman scowl in frustration and confusion. Pulling any further explanation out of Narcissa would be like pulling her beloved Rapier Roses from the ground; painful and bloodletting.
"Yeah." Dudley nodded distractedly as he watched Chrissy and Lily pet Belle and giggle over her colorful body.
Sobering from their little teasing, Narcissa reached out and tugged him back toward her with a delicate hand clasping around his. "Be careful, my love." She pulled him down until he gave her a soft, tender kiss on her freshly painted lips. She murmured, "I'll be waiting," and released him.
Nervously straightening her blouse, Andromeda stepped away from the table and began slowly backing away toward the fireplace. "Alright, Harry," she murmured, sadly, not looking at him. "I'm sorry."
"It did work!" Albus insisted. "We got to spend the night and Dad had to sleep with Draco. They even cuddled!"
They both watched the flashes of ward magic at various points around the garden while the house-elves carried their wounded inside and Narcissa fixed her tea with her preferred amounts of cream and sugar.
Draco straightened even further, going rigid and cool. "It is available, yes. You are welcome to it. The elves are under strict orders to keep it away from the children and to cut anyone off who seems to have imbibed a little too much. Neither Harry nor I will be drinking tonight seeing as we are the hosts and are therefore responsible for our guests," he explained coldly, a bit of his old sneer sneaking through.
Harry snorted. "They peck because you’re supposed to give them a treat for delivering your letters, Dudley. They get testy if you don't thank them properly."
She sighed and placed a warm weathered hand over his. "We're your family, Harry. They’re family. We don't care if the children can talk to snakes. We just care if they’re happy."
"Why are we all up here?" Teddy asked while he played with Nova as the snake slithered over his hands. "Why don't we go outside and play in the gardens?"
"Splendid," Lucius drawled. "Right this way, young Mr. Potter." An absent gesture with his cane pointed them in direction of the aforementioned horse.
The older woman turned away and sniffed. "I do seem to recall something of that sort. So, Harry Potter lives in your ancestral home with his -four?- children? My, his wife must be quite the busy woman."
It's working, the plan is actually working! Teddy thought as he panted, keeping close on Albus's heels. The only thing he was worried about was whether the snake could remember the way. This would all be useless if Belle couldn't find Draco's shop.
A bright smile broke out on his face and Harry dropped the sudsy plate in his hand back in the sink with a clatter.
It was amazing. A deep black velvet, softer than anything Harry had ever felt, backed with what appeared to be woven strands of silver that were then threaded through the velvet to serve as prongs holding millions of diamonds of various shapes to resemble stars in the night sky.
No one spoke until the elf reappeared with a tall cold glass of juice for Marianne and a short tumbler of firewhisky for Dudley. He held out a chair from a nearby table for Marianne and pushed it in for her as she sat down.
Finally, Draco bit into his duck and turned to Audrey. "I understand that you work at the Ministry as well. What do you do there?" he inquired politely.
Harry stared at her for a moment, but still couldn't stop placing most of the blame on himself. He should have seen it, or been there, or something. Maybe none of this would have happened.
"Here," Draco handed Harry a set of forest green silk pajamas when they stepped into the massive room with the massive bed. The room alone could be bigger than the dorms in Gryffindor and Harry had never seen a bed so big.
While Harry was trying to find his footing in this surreal new world he found himself in he came to a realization that steadied him. Despite the differences between his and Draco’s marriages and the abandonment of their wives, there was one way in which their circumstances were completely the same. They loved their kinds unendingly and they children were now theirs entirely.
Smirking, Draco nodded and pulled Harry back into a deeper kiss. “You better get started on that, Potter, because the chicks always leave the nest before you’re ready.”
"Albus," Harry frowned at his messy, raven haired son. "Don’t shout, at me. I didn’t lie. Your mum-"
Draco hummed, smiling. His eyes started drifting closed and he just enjoyed being held. He'd had a rather physically lonely few years since he'd divorced Astoria. He'd forgotten what it was like to have simple human touch.
Harry was discovering that Draco Malfoy had matured into a different man very unlike how he was in school. He was seemingly kind, sympathetic, and generous. He was also bossy, spoiled, and a bit of a flirt. It was comforting to know that some things never change. Regardless, Harry was still surprised every time Draco did something uncharacteristic of the mean little ferret he’d known at Hogwarts.
had just gone down hill. The people no longer trusted a newspaper that fell to Ministry pressure and Death Eater threats.
Narcissa nodded in earnest agreement. "Draco's quite right, dear. There are plenty of guestrooms for you and the children to stay in."
"No, Scorpius. You're not in trouble." He finally let them off the hook his voice softening. "I will, however, request that when you wish to use the house-elves in any future schemes, you inform me ahead of time. Especially if something important, like the floo, is to mysteriously cease functioning as part of those schemes."
"I don't know. I didn't think she was still so stuck, you know." He shrugged halfheartedly. "She and Ted had some concerns of what might happen when Remus and Tonks got married, but I didn't realize she hadn’t gotten over them yet. Or that she would still fear people's reactions to Teddy's parentage."
As they deepened the kiss, Draco was about to pull back and suggest they save it for later when a previously murmured argument turned loud drawing everyone's attention.
Kingsley quirked at eyebrow at him dubiously. "We'll see about that once the investigation is complete. It would seem that even when Harry's not working for the Ministry he's still intent on serving justice."
His shower went quickly after that and by the time he hopped back out and dried himself off with his fluffy blue towel he was absolutely starving. God, he'd forgotten just how hungry sex made him.
Only when Harry resumed his place next to him did Draco pull himself away for a moment to smile brightly at his lover before turning back and delving into the mating habits of some obscure Asian breed or other. Harry just shook his had in amusement and began a conversation with Arthur about the newest muggle technology he'd discovered.
"Individual duels weren't working out too well, so Lockhart decided to put your father and I up on the stage and let us have at it," he went on something in his voice said he was reaching the climax of the story so the children quieted down and leaned in. Harry and George almost found themselves leaning as well, even though they knew how the story ended.
"Why?" gasped James as he stared at the older man with wide, horrified eyes. Some of his fiery spirit was peeking through again.
He just chuckled and shook his head in amusement. "They love those snakes. They can’t get into much trouble and don't make a mess. Besides, it helps that the kids can actually talk to them and tell them not do things they aren't supposed to.
Then again, he was amazing with his own child so it stood to reason he would be amazing with all children. His Scorpius made Harry’s Albus happy when nothing else could. He’d humbled James. He’d gotten Lily to laugh. Draco had all the Potter children eating out of the palms of his hands and Harry couldn't even get through a meal without feeling like the worst father ever.
Lucius studied him for a long moment trying to decide of he was having him on. "You wish to have the meeting with Miss Lovegood," he clarified.
"What charities do you support? What type of research?" Draco continued, ignoring the dark looks from Hermione and the tentative conversation Harry was trying to strike with his two best friends.
When Lily gave a happy giggle and the two boys broke out in flaming blushes, Scorpius couldn't take the anticipation anymore. He squeezed Albus's hand painfully tight and burst out, "Well, what happened!"
Draco stared down at the little boy nearly speechless. He knew exactly who this kid was. Well, he hadn't known his name, but he sure as shit knew who he belonged to. Those bright green eyes, that messy hair, that stubborn chin. There was only one person he could have gotten all of that from.
"Yes, I believe that I am," he replied with subtle sarcasm that went completely over the other man's head. The other men in the lift with them all shifted restlessly and watched the scene unfolding with mixed looks of horror and blank astonishment. "And you are?" Lucius asked condescendingly.
She looked at him with her mouth open in astonishment before nodding. "Alright." She turned her head again to look around and nearly jumped out of her skin when a little house-elf walked in front of her carrying a tray with smoked salmon and crackers on it. "What on earth is that!?" she nearly shrieked drawing a bit of attention to them. She'd seen the garden gnome at Grimmauld before, but these creatures looked completely foreign and nothing like a garden pest.
"You do realize, Mr. Potter, that my son has seen fit to adopt you and your children," Lucius said when Narcissa, Draco, and James were distracted bringing Harry's attention back around.
They flooed directly into the little vegan cafe, Greene Thumbe, that Luna had picked out. Lucius took one sneering look around the place with its store front of windows, its order-at-the-counter set up, and its various spacey clientel and hated the place immediately. Of course, being the professional businessman that he is, he took a deep breath resigning himself to some horrid grassy concoction and followed Potter and Lovegood toward the counter to place their order.
Narcissa eyed the strange tea in her own cup for a moment before banishing the liquid and pouring herself a fresh cup. Perhaps it would taste better without so much cream and sugar.
Edward frowned at her even as his little sister nodded enthusiastically. "Dancing Chrysanthemums?" he repeated dubiously.
That night Harry and Draco lay awake in Draco's bed just holding each other, both of their minds running in circles and their heartbeats comforting to one another.
A spike of pain lanced through his heart as Harry thought about all of this for the millionth time. How could he have been so blind? Or so neglectful? He had just assumed that everything was fine while he was gone. Apparently he couldn’t see a problem until it was flashing like a Weasley Wizard Wheezes firework in front of his face.
Harry’s stared at him in bewilderment mouth opening and closing before he finally shut it with a snap.
Harry wasn’t sure whether he should take exception to the way Malfoy was speaking to his son and talking about his father and Sirius or be grateful he was calling James out on his horrid behavior.
"This is going to sting a little," he cautioned then murmured a handy scrape cleaning spell his mother had used on him as a boy. Albus whimpered a little when the spell swept over his palms, but held still. "Perfect," Draco praised with a smile. It was returned timidly.
"Fortunately that won’t be a problem anymore, Mr. Weasley, because Mr. Potter is looking to reinvest in your business."
Cassiopeia sighed, sounding very put upon, as if she had not just been told off like a child by her grandson. "Yes, very well, Draco. We have had our fun for the morning anyway. I dare say your tongue gets sharper and your disposition fouler the older you get." She scrunched her nose in a gesture Harry recognized from Draco. "You get that from your mother, no doubt. Well, shoo-shoo,
Narcissa clenched her hands in a white-knuckled grip around her tea cup. "Yes, pity," she forced out through her pursed lips.
A small disdainful scoff escaped him before he could stop it, but Lucius was a master at keeping up appearances and continued to act like a casual stroll through the Ministry after being tried for war-crimes as a Death Eater was perfectly normal.
Draco wasn't exactly sure what he was thanking him for, but Harry seemed to understand. He rolled them over, slipping from inside Draco in the process, then settled more comfortable in bed, holding Draco against his chest firmly.
Harry laughed. "Oh quiet, you. Why don't you go outside and say hi to James, Albus, and Lily. They'll be happy to see you." He put his godson down and watched as the little ten year-old scampered out the backdoor and bounded through the yard with an ear splitting shout that was promptly answered by his cousins.
Little did he know that while he was lying awake in his own bed trying not to think about how it felt to wake up with Draco in his arms, his children had all sneaked into Teddy's room to hold an emergency meeting.
He went barefoot down the stairs until he rounded the corner to the kitchen to find all five kids still in their pajamas talking and giggling with each other while Harry stood in front of the stove, jeans riding low on his hips, and bare feet tapping some random rhythm as he scrambled eggs and flipped pancakes.
"Remember when the glass disappeared from the python tank and the snake chased you and Peirce around the reptile room?" he continued voice drawling with a hint of humor.
She flushed at being caught out in her astonishment and straightened up. "No, I'm alright, Mr. Potter. It's just a little hot in here." She tugged weakly at her collar and fanned herself with her hand.
When she didn’t immediately respond, Harry continued, "Scorpius, Draco's son, gets on amazingly with the kids, Teddy, too, and Draco is great with them. We've been over to the Manor quite a bit and Narcissa and Lucius are -quite surprisingly, mind- great, as well. It came as a shock, I can tell you,” he gave an awkward laugh and finished with, “considering the last time I'd had any prolonged contact with them I was testifying at their trial."
And just as they'd rehearsed all morning, Lily took off after her snake as she slithered away into the crowd.
They held each other’s gaze, communicating more than words could ever say, until Lily's delighted squeal distracted them.
Ugh! It was all too much. Teddy sniffled, his eyes starting to burn. He wiped at them furiously with the back of his hand. It felt like he didn't know anything anymore. It was frustrating and it hurt to realized that there were things about his family that his grandmother and Harry hadn't told him.
The children giggled madly along with George when he described how the snake had snapped at Dudley and Peirce's ankles.
Her tea and cakes had arrived and she was on page eighty-seven. Vance was pulling Genevieve away from the cliff’s edge before it could crumble and plunge her to a watery death.
"When is Mum coming home?" Lily asked, her voice muffled around noddles, her pretty hazel eyes watching Harry sadly.
"That's what I said, wasn't it?" Harry frowned back. "Yesterday I entered into a business arrangement with him and signed a contract. He explained to me that two copies of the contract were for us, but the third would be sent to the Ministry because apparently they were keeping tabs on him since he’s the only free and pardoned adult Death Eater."
Harry sipped his tea and shrugged. "We had a bit of an argument about some investing I want to do, but other than that nothing really special."
A huff of breath escaped Harry before he took a rather large sip of his own scotch. "Yeah, Ron. It really is getting better. I didn't realize it before, but Ginny had become so detached from everything that her leaving hasn’t really changed much."
"Maybe it takes more than just spending the night once and cuddling to fall in love," Teddy suggested, sounding for all their confusion like the very voice of wisdom. He was oldest after all, he must know about these kinds of things.
"I thought I should hand in my resignation personally," Harry answered still standing in front of the Minister for Magic's desk.
Scanning the letter beginning to end, Harry went back and read it three times before Dudley finally snapped. "Well, what does the bloody thing say?"
Wary and curious, Lucius accepted the offer and perched himself regally in one of the visitor's chairs. They were much more inviting than the ones from Fudge's regime he noted absently.
"That is enough!" Harry bellowed making both his children jump. His voice echoed off the kitchen walls angrily.
He held the stick level with his lips and with a mischievous wink at his cousin blew lightly at the wick until it burst into a small flame.
"So, you see, Potter. You're really not alone. There is life on the other side." Draco grinned at Harry and laughed at the look on his face. Draco shed the maudlin conversation like a fashion offending coat and strode down the hill to join in the children's games.
Draco grinned amused by the displeased expression on James’s face. "There's nothing wrong with practice."
Scorpius nodded numbly up at them and returned Charlie’s smile tremulously. He looked away and finally took stock of the sight before him.
"What?" Harry frowned and leaned away in confusion. "What does that have to do with the sword?" he asked in annoyance.
"Oh yes, Mr. Potter." Lucius nodded gravely turning his gaze on the seemingly unsuspecting sword as Harry lifted it up himself and stared at it wonderingly. "Oh indeed, yes."
"Hey mate, calm down." Ron leaned over and squeezed Harry’s shoulder almost painfully trying to ground him in the present, in the cool evening, in the yard, in the now. "It's alright, Harry. Just take your time. Breathe a little. Hermione always breathes when she gets crazy, says it's centering or some shit. Do some of that, alright."
A small insistent tug distracted Draco from his current discussion on Quidditch with Angelina and Ronald about. Tilting his head, Draco caught a flash of blond out of the corner of his eye and turned fully to see a small toddler pulling at his robes.
Teddy's hair faded from magenta pink to bright green as he held his godfather's wand with an intense look of concentration. "
Narcissa, who'd been silently watching everything from just behind her husband, was the only one who saw the looks the elf and her grandson had been trading. She didn’t miss the looks the children had been giving each other, either.
