“Did you see the most recent decree from the old cow? Boys and girls not permitted within six inches of each other.” Pansy snorted as she gawked at the ridiculousness of the rule. She looped her arms flirtatiously around both Crabbe and Goyle, who were perched on either side of her.
A nagging voice has always told him it was bound to end this way. Himself and Voldemort, eye to eye, surrounded by the depths of something dark.
Draco Malfoy, however slightly, was bothered by Harry and Ginny’s kiss. He just wasn’t fully aware of why that was.
Sirius’s eyes were sharp with honesty and suddenly Remus couldn’t breathe. That familiar blush was creeping up his cheeks again, and he dared to lay down his quill to meet his stare.
The shrieking shack was a sight for sore eyes as always, but it certainly seemed less threatening with Lupin and Black cuddling in the corner.
They were outside, by the lake. The sun was setting peacefully beyond the turrets of the castle. Harry immediately noticed the pale glow of the evening light against Malfoy’s hair; there was something utterly enchanting about it. Like it was a halo or something. Catching himself, he shifted his focus to their surroundings.
Sirius Black and Remus Lupin we’re perched at the edge of the water, laughing and splashing each other lightly.
Their eyes were fixed as Draco’s face came closer, closer, until it hovered mere inches from Harry’s. He then proceeded to lift a hand, brushing his fingertips against his temple, trailing them inferiorly, tracing a line along his cheekbones and jaw.
Remus opened his mouth, clearly wondering if the middle of the Three Broomsticks was the place to say what he knew he’d felt in his heart for forever.
“Well, are you just going to stand there all day or are you going to view this memory with me so that we can get out of here?” Malfoy’s familiar scoff brought Harry back to reality, and he found himself groaning internally.
It was the light snoring and a subtle pressure against his left pectoral muscle that caught his attention next. His train of thought came crashing as rapidly as it had arrived at what he saw and... felt.
Ron’s response was a shrug. “It’s quite obvious, really. You deserve to be happy, Harry, with all that we’ve been through in the past year.”
“Well, if it isn’t he famous Harry Potter,” he mocked, and Harry’s knees trembled slightly. This wasn’t how he remembered this going. What was happening?
The room they found themselves residing in was minimal at best, lined with creaking floorboards and ripped curtains. There was a bed in one corner, and a quilt that seemed much too measly for anyone their age. The place was a wreck, to put it simply.
And if he did, would it be salient that he lacked any interest at all in their physique? Would the entire world know the secret that only he and Pansy had shared?
“What is it Professor? What’s happened?” Harry questioned anxiously, momentarily letting go of Draco’s hand.
James had promised Lily that although she had to end their “date” early to go study, he’d catch up with her later. She rolled her eyes at his arrogance, as always, but Remus had caught the subtle smile that pulled at her lips as she walked away.
“Good enough,” he repeats, the syllables a solid reality, just like the man before him. And, in a sudden fit of realization, Draco realizes the epitome of his salvation.
He knew that Malfoy would take this as a personal offense against his house. And he realized quickly that their thin truce was about to end.
“Come in, boys, I have your assignment prepared.” He smiled softly, an omniscient sign that belonged solely to Dumbledore. Harry breathed a sigh of relief at his apparent lack of anger. Perhaps detention wouldn’t be so bad, armed with the knowledge of Dumbledore’s forgiveness.
“Preoccupied my arse, Severus!” Lily called passionately as she held her wand steady, and James couldn’t help but beam  at her decision to stand up to him. “You guys came here to hurt poor Remus! And you will all be punished!”
“Narcissa. Draco.” He stated formally, greeting them as if they were nothing more than acquaintances.
It’s Draco Malfoy who kisses Harry one night in the common room, a bit drunk off of fire whiskey and house unity.  But it’s Harry who kisses him back, lacing his fingers around the bare skin of his neck and tugging him closer. And in that moment, Harry feels like he’s died and come back to life.
“Draco, Harry. I have come to bring you back to Hogwarts. I’m afraid that something horrible had happened.”
This room was all too familiar. There were four beds, each of which was currently occupied. Harry’s attention was stolen immediately by the boys, who appeared several years older than they had in the previous memory.
At this, Sirius let out a loud guffaw. “My God, Rem. If I didn’t know you better, I wouldn’t question that a damn bit.”
Why had he called him Draco? And why had it felt so right? So pure? Like he should’ve been doing it his entire life?
He positively melted when Harry’s hands tugged him closer, lining their bodies against one another in a perfect, heated match. He gasped softly against his lips, suddenly very aware of how close they were and unable to control the very real urges that began to rise like fire within.
“And if He Who Must Not Be Named finds out that we’re against him? He’ll kill our parents, then us.”
It was at this moment that the post arrived, owls swooping in from every which way. The expected chaos ensued, those available reaching for letters and packages from home.
“Apparently they tried to bestow some kind of idea that he’d have an arranged marriage, and Sirius flipped shit and told them to fuck off. That’s when they threw him out.”
His face must’ve been dumbfounded, or perhaps just plain dumb, because Malfoy’s contorted into one of concern.
He’d called him gay, that was it. Why did that bother him so much? Was it just because it was Malfoy, or was it something much deeper?
The cheers from the Gryffindors were deafening. Harry beamed with pride as he watched his father high five his team mates.
He turned around to face Harry, who held his mouth agape at what he saw. It was Lucius Malfoy in all respects... except his eyes. They were complete pools of darkness, from sclera to Iris. No color remained except the pitch black that seemed to consume him, running down below his eye sockets as if someone had ripped them out clean.
James smirked with a soft chuckle. “Oh, yeah, you’re a rebel Alright. You’re as ferocious as a puppy.”
And then, like the crash of an ocean wave,  Sirius Black pressed his lips to Remus Lupin’s. Remus was slammed with the chaotic swirl that was the incoming tide, And he never wanted it to stop. Not today, not tomorrow, not ever.
He’s lifting himself from the floor and begins running straight toward Draco, bruised and splattered with soot. Before he can open his mouth to speak, Harry’s arms are thrown around him.
It was one of those confusing moments again. Something about the air in the room, the warm fuzzy feeling that was observing his father and those he’d grown to love, had him not hating Malfoy at all.
“I... I want in. I’m tired of being the little guy. I want to be a part of something big. Something powerful.”
“I’m glad you got to come here, too, you know.” Remus’s eyes settled into a seriousness as they met Black’s face. “How are things at home?”
Harry snickered, and Draco shrugged nonchalantly. “If it weren’t for this moment, I wouldn’t have you now.”
“Because it’s Wormtail. Wormy wormy wormtail.” Sirius tipped his drink back, finishing the last of the sweet foam that lapped at the bottom.
They clenched their eyes shut once more, focusing with all of their might on becoming animagi. On transferring every bone, every organ, every piece of flesh to their animal form, whatever it may be. On complete surrender.
“Where are we?” Malfoy’s voice was barely above a whisper, the words hanging on the edge of the darkness that enveloped them.
“Harry,” She called. But his name sounded foreign, like it had never belonged to him. He tried to respond, but his voice was lost somewhere in the craze. He stared at her, squinting as her image finally quit swaying.
Finding himself in a subconscious that did not belong to him. Watching Draco Malfoy face every last one of his demons.
If he’d had any doubt in his mind about Draco, it would’ve dissipated in the next moment. His cheeks burned a rosy pink, reflecting the uneasy thoughts that were escalating through his mind.
“Mate, That was bloody brilliant. Hands down, the best punch I’ve seen you throw yet.” Sirius’s exuberance was matched only by the underlying tone of thankfulness that coated his words.
“I- I don’t understand,” he stammers, but Malfoy’s rising and crossing the empty space between them.
“Awh, it’s not so bad, Pete. This could come in handy for some pranks, you know. You’re Small and fast.” He winked, but Peter only stuck out his bottom lip further.
And in the midst of that desire, he could see flashes of Draco’s memories running spiritedly trough his mind’s eye- confusion over his sexuality...hurt and rejection on behalf of his own family... the desire to be his own individual coated with earning an unattainable love...
Harry paused, flabbergasted. His eyes darted to Malfoy, who seemed humble and in thought. Suddenly, silver eyes that were as soft as a storm cloud were meeting his own.
In the next few seconds, he’d conjured a Patronus that flitted gracefully from the room to deliver a message.
Peter looked like he might shit himself at any moment. He was clearly in disbelief and began chewing his nails as he contemplated whether they were joking.
It was beautiful. He was absolutely stunning, lying peacefully against Harry, and something about it just felt more right than anything else in the whole wretched world.
“Now. The memory charms have been successful to their intent. The only one who recalled any reason of how they got into the shack that night was Mr. Snape, and he has been sworn to silence. He remembers his own speculations, but no evidence remains in his psyche. The rest are convinced that that you all snuck out separately and ended up in the shack after you began quarreling. Can I trust that you will continue to protect Mr. Lupin’s secret to the best of your ability?”
The world began to vibrate, an earthquake against the plane of his own mind. A shelf toppled over. More memories, breaking on the floor.
Regulus clutched his jaw with both hands, whimpering slightly as he gritted his teeth through the pain. He shot one last look of contempt in their direction before skittering away. Snape’s gaze lingered on Lily a bit longer as if he was pleading silently for things between them to mend. When her expression remained resolute and narrowed, he made the regrettable but snap decision to follow in Regulus’s footsteps.
He deserved someone like Ginny, whose level-headed continuity was an unending source. She wouldn’t yell like this, or throw bratty temper tantrums when she felt threatened. No, she’d take him by the hands, and pull him close...
“It’s not,” he snapped, and Lily froze to avoid being caught. She- along with Harry and Draco- we’re gaining on them.
Harry seized the opportune moment to trek the last few steps toward the exit. He gripped the handle and threw the door open, but it was no library on the other side. Where an entrance to a memory had once stood was now replaced by the most blinding of lights, protruding with a yellow glow through the open doorway.
Was it evident in his face that his heart had skipped a beat? It must’ve been clear that he wasn’t expecting this question with the silence that followed as he formulated a response.
As if echoing his thoughts, the face of Lucius Malfoy appeared somewhat violently in the fire. Draco did not falter but wore an unreadable expression.
Sirius leaned against the wall, cradling an exhausted Remus between his legs. He had his head nestled in the crook of Sirius’s neck, and appeared more contented than it seemed he’d been in days.
She tipped the bottle upward, placing a single drop on her tongue that dissolved as rapidly as it landed. She continued by placing another drop in between Potter’s lips. This was risky, and honestly Pansy had no idea if it would work. But she also knew it was her only chance to save him.
His eyes had squeezed shut through the chaos, a minor defense mechanism that now ended as they sprung open.
“How very kind of you, Saint Potter.” He chuckled softly and squeezed his hand. And then, with a seriousness that could move mountains, he turned his head and faced him directly.
It held, but not for long, and the shield was visibly shaking as Draco shot curses from around it. He hit one, no, two, Death Eaters and Harry silently beamed at what a grand team they made. If only they’d been able to see it sooner, how different would things have been...
Her eyes remained shut as she intently transferred pieces of her memory to the magic, and with a flick of her wand the doe trotted through the wall of the shack. James was awestruck, completely captivated by her beauty and talent. She exchanged a humble smile with him after opening her eyes, and the energy between them seemed to Radiate warmth through the entire shack.
Harry’s tumbling, struggling to find hand-holds in the pile as things get heated. He’s almost to the diadem, and Draco is silently willing his thoughts to persuade his victory. He can hardly move, and in the midst of chaos he notices that his leg is tingling.
He hasn’t tried to perform the charm since, but something tells him he won’t be able to. It’s a nagging feeling in his gut, and he admittedly doesn’t like it.
Harry ignored his own mannerisms and instead migrated toward the Slytherins as they began their assignment.
“Well, if I’m Sirius, who does that make you?” Harry meant this statement lightheartedly but felt his pulse skip as the words rolled from his tongue.
“Memories,” Harry whispered, placing a hand on a random globe of white light. He was greeted by images of Buckbeak in their third year Care of Magical Creatures Lesson. He quickly let go of this, sprinting along to another shelf. Another memory, a more recent one, one that had occurred only hours before, if he estimated correctly...
Their kiss was slow, and soft, and when they separated there was an adventurous gleam in Remus’s amber eyes.
Draco was lost for words, caught in confusion. Why had he followed him? Hadn’t he done a fine job of pushing him away?
“He wants you to be a Death Eater.” Harry’s conclusion brought Draco’s gaze back up to his own. Emerald held flush with gray, open and honest.
Harry caught himself chuckling relaxedly. So much friendship existed between the companions, that much was evident just in the way they talked.
“Sirius, why don’t you shut the fuck up and go bother someone else?” He’d clearly hit a nerve with his little brother, who was all but red with frustration. His cool facade was quickly crumbling.
“All ears, my friend,” Draco added. It was evident that they’d all been dragged to these social events one too many times.
“Fine. I dare you to kiss someone yourself. Kiss...” Nott wiggled his eyebrows suggestively as Draco’s gaze roamed the circle. He wanted Nott to pay for his little comment about Potter. But...how?
For the first time, Harry shifted his focus to the boy in front of him. He appeared almost scared, a few shades paler than his normal vampiric tone. Suddenly, he felt sick to his own stomach. What if Draco didn’t want this? What if Zabini’s  intervention was only pious?
“It seems a bit quiet, doesn’t it?” Draco asked at the conclusion of the next few moments. Harry nodded, puzzled. Should they venture beneath into the hollows of the tree in search of the Marauders?
He spun around, shrieking as Harry hit the ground. Instinctively, he ran forward, pushing the ant-like creature with both hands so as to create distance between them. “Get the fuck away from him!” He called, but the others were gaining on them, and soon, they were surrounded.
“I think about you all the time.” Was the response, and Harry felt his stomach lurch. “Ever since you gave me my wand back. And then Pansy and Blaise are all about your friends, and suddenly you didn’t seem so bad anymore. And then I realized that...that...”
The entire room was silent. The drop of a fork could be heard from the Hufflepuff table, and it was enough to magnify the pounding of Harry’s heart in his chest.
It was this fact that had him feeling empty, like he’d left a piece of himself back in the pensieve. With Draco.
“Draco, I don’t know fucking how, but when the fiendfyre caught your leg… it must have reversed the effects of the snake bite.” He’s smiling, a wide, wholesome grin, and Draco finally catches his breath.
Overwhelmed with emotion, he stares at Potter, who’s a fucking light at the end of the incessant, winding tunnel that’s been his life the past few years. He becomes lost in the details of his face, cheeks flushed crimson with adventure and green eyes peering from behind glasses that were probably permanently crooked by now. He pulls his lip between his teeth as he too contemplates what happened.
Now they’re both on the ground, Draco panting and Potter pointing his wand at the wound. “Reinervate!” He commands, but nothing happens.
“You are pathetic.” The voice of his father shakes the walls, breaks the foundation. Rips open the fortress of his solitude, jagged lines coursing through his very being and down to his core.
They met at the entrance to the office bright and early. Malfoy was already perched against the wall when Harry arrived, silent but lacking his normal contempt.
And all at once, certain memories started falling from the shelves and shattering against the floor. Their contents were projected high above them, like a theater screen playing a movie. It was images of Draco, and his father, and every dastardly thing that had happened to him wide on display.
Harry’s laughter was the greatest of interruptions, and it was returned by a rather toothy grin from across.
And with that, the memory came to a close. It was a brief hold on their surroundings, lasting only a moment before time seemed to unfreeze at another scene in front of the Potter estate.
Harry turned to face his former nemesis, and the contemplative expression he wore all but melted the remaining tendrils of his belly knot.
Draco kept up, each press of his shoe against the dirt a match to Harry’s. He didn’t have to see Draco’s face in the darkness to know that he was worried. He could feel the emotion rolling off of him as they treaded forward.
He hated Potter that year. Hated him because in being the Chosen One, he had help. He had an entire Order of people protecting him. He never had to be alone.
Draco chewed his lips violently, biting back the screams that threatened to dislodge his throat. His fingernails bled as he dug them seamlessly into the concrete, each one bending and breaking beneath the pain. He grunted and groaned but refused cry. Harry couldn’t take it anymore.
It began with Remus’s transformation. It was horrific, and heartbreaking, but Harry couldn’t look away as each bone in Remus Lupin’s body broke and re-formed into the wolf. His cries were wrenching, skin bleeding, teeth gnashing at what was probably the worst pain anyone could feel.
“Take that back, Zabini!” He bickered, and Pansy rolled her eyes with a lopsided smile thrown in Draco’s direction before they exited.
Harry finished the letter, glancing immediately to Malfoy’s face for any sign of what he was thinking.
“So being myself is a blatant disrespect to the Black name, eh? Maybe I should’ve gone to Potter’s. He wouldn’t have let that happen to me!”
When Harry looked back at its owner, Malfoy’s eyes were a humble shade of silver. Upon meeting green they seemed to dilate, recognizing what was happening with a nervousness that Harry could almost taste. How uncharacteristically pure, how subtle, how... nothing had ever happened like this. Who was this guy, and what had he done with Malfoy?
The edges of such utopia began to fade into the darkest of charcoals, scratching closer and closer to the image’s center. Harry squinted, straining to see the smiling faces before him. He didn’t want them to leave, but they were fading rapidly, clouded by the chalky black substance that was his mind moving to another place, another time.
“I know.” She pulled him into a warm embrace. “And you won’t. We’ll continue to be friends like we always have been.”
“Want to talk about it?” Blaise asked genuinely as Pansy laced her fingers into a rest for her chin.
“But you can’t be this person, Draco! I need you to be better than this! I need you to beat Voldemort. I- I can’t do it without you.”
Maybe... and then there are images flashing through his mind. Of stone family drawings and cruel and unjust punishment.
They shuffled down a nearby corridor to a hidden spiral staircase that Harry had only know about thanks to the Marauder’s Map.
The man was incapable of responding, mere bones beneath him. He screamed as his skin melted away, and his skeleton crunched and cracked as it rapidly decayed. It was mere seconds before he was silenced, his bony form decomposing to ash.
It was Draco, and he was suffering. How had Harry not known? Or perhaps, had he not cared enough at the time to even notice?
They laughed together, and it was a gorgeous noise. It was the sound of two enemies transformed into friends, and perhaps so much more. A warm acoustic to the silence of the memory; a song of victory.
“You don’t have a choice, Harry Potter.” His malicious grin turned into a loud laugh that barked in waves that seemed to shake the entire world around them.
All at once, Everything and nothing seemed to make sense. Harry had never known, he’d never had any idea...
Harry couldn’t see his face, but in the boy’s hand was a bowl. An ordinary vessel, it seemed, except that within it was a conglomeration of leaves and twigs and other things that a child would play with.
“Why do the Slytherins hate them so much?!” Harry’s next question was blurted, unplanned, and instantly regretted.
“Draco!” Harry whimpered pathetically, just a second too late. Because across the room from him, that same green light was absorbed by Draco’s chest. In a fit of adrenaline, Harry lurched forward with the intent of catching him. If this is what was happening, what was truly occurring, then Draco would fall backward, that same determined expression permanently fixed upon his face.
“So, I know what we can do to help Rem at the next full moon.” Sirius rolled over to face the other two. Peter perked up enthusiastically; James peered upward from the paper.
“I heard you and the Weasellete called it quits,” he called haughtily. “Did she finally realize that you’re into blokes?”
Draco’s brow was narrowed, clearly wondering the same thing. He remained silent, awaiting the headmaster’s orders earnestly.
“Hey, guys.” A startled Sirius Black jumped dramatically as Remus seemingly appeared from thin air and took a seat next to him. He laughed warmly at the ridiculousness of his reaction, pulling a charmed smile from Sirius.
The shadowy figure of Tom Riddle himself seemed to glide forward and into plain view. He was preserved just as Harry had seen him last in the Department of Mysteries. It was unsettling, seeing him again, even if his own presence was invisible.
“When I fired the killing curse at you that evening, and I was temporarily overcome by the magnificent Harry Potter... the curse rebounded. And in that moment, a piece of me... belonged to you.”
Without further question, Lucius Malfoy walked away. And Peter Pettigrew remained, no more than a traitor, his betrayal hanging blatantly in the air.
The day Harry kissed Malfoy was one he would savor endlessly. They were on the couch, watching some muggle sitcom that Harry enjoyed far too much. His face lit up at each joke, and Draco smiled at his reactions.
“I haven’t asked anyone yet,” he admitted coldly, clearly more interested in the potions textbook he was studying than her flirtatious demeanor.
And Harry had to find Draco. He had to follow the memories to find the boy that never had a choice. He had to profess everything he’d learned so far to him, every last detail that’d suddenly lit up his world like lighting in the middle of a storm. A storm that held the same pastel gray as Draco’s eyes...
On the third shelf down, he seemed to pause, cocking his head as he pondered the title of a black and gold hardcover.
“I-I’m dying. My life, it flashed- I’m dying.” He stuttered, and suddenly the air was heavy and thick like fog. Images of Death Eaters, and Draco, and sparks flying in his direction...
And Draco panicked, realizing that the inevitable had somehow occurred. What he’d pretended wasn’t going to happen, what he’d wished would never happen...
Draco gave a single nod in agreement. “Headmaster, you should know- I know why they’re here, or at least I believe I do.”
After enough whining on Pansy’s part, the three were granted permission to leave the vicinity in favor of the garden outside.
After gazing in his direction, Voldemort continued. “I have one more task for you. It is a large one, but I have faith in your ability to serve me.”
They chuckled, enjoying the moment until it appeared that a group of Slytherins was headed their way.
“You really would be better off with Ginny Weasley!” He called, the wind whipping his hair, and it was a miracle that he didn’t choke on the words as they escaped his mouth.
“What the fuck, Potter? How did you-“ His face is a cross between confusion and embarrassment, and his heart is pounding.
“Do you think that cursing your little friend is going to solve your problems?” He gawked. And then, settling into something more serious:  “He is nothing but a player in my game.”
There was a slight pull on his navel, as if he was being thrown across another dimension. A dizzying whirl that had Draco grabbing a fistful of his robes with his free hand. And then...nothing. There was a sensation of something flat beneath his feet, and he peeked an eye open hesitantly to view the familiarity of the Headmaster’s office.
A jerking sensation. A heavy thump of something falling next to him, vibrating the cool ground beneath. Who else could possibly be interrupting his time here? Could it be...?
This time, however, he could make out faint shapes. The ceiling of a room. A mobile that was spelled to spin calmly above his head.
He approached it rapidly, peering at an unchanged Dumbledore before throwing open the door to reveal white and gray wisps of magic emanating outward. They tangled like snakes through the air, reaching forward in a fashion similar to woodsmoke.
And then... a face. He was sitting across the Great Hall, picking at his food as he scraped his plate mindlessly. His eyes were downward, but his focus was clearly elsewhere. His cheek rested in a bent palm that was suspended by an elbow propped impolitely on the table.
Harry refused to lose sight of him in this state and stalked in his direction, praying that the memory would continue. He lacked the knowledge of how to fix him but knew that he needed support. Would he find it in his friends?
“I know this is probably not the way you’d imagine this moment, but I just- I want to make you mine. Forever. I want the world to know how I’ve felt about you for years.”
Draco stood, shaking, his face a mixture of relief and utter disbelief. Harry hopped to his feet as their eyes met, and his gaze held the same kind of shock that meant something big had happened. Something life changing.
Harry gulped. He’d almost forgotten this memory, though now it ran electrically prevalent in his mind.
Instead, he quickly and recklessly decided to risk diving in anyway. Without hesitation, he leaned forward, touching his nose to the substance that poured outward.
“You’ll never make up for what you’ve done,” he hears his father say, and the words are a gun to his head.
He sunk deeper into Remus, releasing to him every piece of torn up teenager he had to give. And in return he felt Remus’s tongue lapping at his own.
“We must make atonement for our loss. This battle will not reflect the conclusion of the war. We will win, Draco, and you are to play a part in that.”
This is what drives him to sneak out, throwing the covers from his insomniatic body and frustratingly stalking from the common room. He doesn’t know where he’s going, just that he needs some fresh air.
Draco’s mouth falls inexplicably, and he’s unable to make sense of anything that’s happened in the past ten minutes.
His heart was thumping wildly against his ribs, ecstatic and fluttering as he neared what so thankfully appeared to be the very statuesque form of Draco Malfoy...
Harry watched the jolted expression of Lily, who seemed stuck between a grateful  sigh of relief and an anxiety attack. He saw his father slide a hand around the small of her back as he led her down the stairs and to toward the exit.
Harry pulls away suddenly, and the absence is heavily vacant upon his lips. His stomach twinges as Harry snaps upward. It is all too evident that they are no longer alone.
“I-I can’t be sure,” he stated, but a slight smirk was tugging at his lips. Potter tilted his head, confused. He knew that Draco had figured out his identity, but he didn’t dare say a word.
His laughter quelled softly, and he paused to contemplate the look in the eyes that bore into him from above.
“You like that, don’t you?” He smiles, playfully amused as he trails a path down Draco’s chest. The caress is heaven, and in his semiconscious state Draco feels whole. Green eyes flicker down to his lips, pale but smooth despite his current state. Harry knows this is it, and it’s all or nothing. There is no longer right and wrong; light or darkness. It’s only Draco, and himself, and everything that he’d thought he’d known to be true snowing gently in broken bits all around them.
Even in the darkness, Sirius could feel the heat coming from Remus’s cheeks. In a flit of spontaneity, he removed his hand and lifted himself into a seated position. With less than a foot of space between them, Sirius raised his palm to Remus’s right cheek.
“I- I don’t know what you’re talking about.” Peter fidgeted, obviously nervous and twitching with sudden fear. He glanced from side to side, eyes falling on the vacancy around them. There was no escaping this- no smart comment from James to distract the Slytherin, no wise remarks from Remus to humble him. Here, he was alone, and he’d have to make a choice- if he was unable to fake his way out of this...
It was raining. Of course it was fucking raining when he’d decided to walk out in a poor attempt at making a statement.
He brushed his hand against Harry’s subtly, signaling for him to follow. Together, they approached the head master. The auror exited, and Dumbledore smiled and clapped his hands together.
Harry wasn’t sure why his heart was racing. His gaze traveled down to the circular button, propped against his now sweaty palm. He expected the song to be muted, for a title to flash across the screen with the absence of ear buds.
Harry shook his head. “Nah, go ahead and keep it. I’ve got as much luck as I need.” He eyed Draco with a sideways glance, a soft blush tinting his cheeks.
When he looked up, Sirius was much closer. He placed a hand on each shoulder in a comforting reassurance.
“Draco!” He caught himself screaming, shuffling after the boy who weaved in and out of the bookshelves stealthily.
“It’s nothing.” He said nervously, and Harry could almost feel the simper on Malfoy’s face beside him.
Harry marveled at the boy before him. He was absolutely beautiful, and, somehow, he was his. The entire prospect was almost unbelievable. Almost.
“Mr. Malfoy, no, please, don’t hurt me!” Peter cried in his own rodent-like manner. His hands clutched the bars, knuckles white from anticipation. Draco stared directly through him as he blankly focused all of his effort on the spell before him.
The door slammed open. A crowd of eighth years walked in, jabbering as always. Hermione was in the forefront with her newest friend Pansy in tow and a very amused Blaise Zabini. Behind them, Draco Malfoy entered with an almost grateful expression.
Because even Hermione noticed gray eyes peering in their direction, and she cocked her head contemplatively before turning back to her notes.
“That moment in death when your life flashes before your eyes? That’s when you come here.” The voice of Draco’s subconscious echoed in a strange form of memory.
“Fucking Potter,” he muttered instead, and Harry noticed his cover up as if it had slapped him across the face. “I’m just trying to walk and I run face first into him snogging the goddamn Weaselette outside in an open corridor.”
Harry was floating. No, sinking? Either way, it was a tranquil bliss that he had never met before. His arms were featherlight as he waved them about, like he was making some kind of snow angel. Like he was nothing more than an innocent.
“You’ve put in a long day’s work,” he stated almost proudly. “I know that visiting memories is no easy feat, and I admire your willingness to get along for this task. With that being said, it is after curfew so I recommend you both go get some sleep. Tomorrow we will continue.”
“I’m not sure, yet. But I don’t think it’s an absolute negative. I can see that he really regrets what he did, and you know how Pete is susceptible to bullying...”
Until images of Draco Malfoy, and a bright green light hitting him, of his body falling into darkness and landing in a bank... of memories... he was isolated, alone. Lying on the ground. Passed out. He had to be near here. There was a shelf in the background, like the others, but... something in Harry instinctively pulled him forward. To the next row, and the next.
He collapsed, breathing heavy and desperate for oxygen. He was rapidly becoming numb, and cold, like ice...
He took another step back, and another. Lucius held a firm grasp on both shoulders now. He was squeezing, like he could crush Draco with his bare hands.
“Don’t forget who got us into this mess.” Harry started mindlessly as he lifted the trap door to the whomping willow.
Eighth year at Hogwarts was intended to be one of educational fulfillment, a chance to finish one’s goal of mastering NEWT level witchcraft and wizardry. What it had become, however, was quite the opposite.
Harry could fight it no longer. The grin that spread across his cheeks was involuntarily giddy. He laughed, shaking his head as his eyes met Draco’s. Again.
“Crazy? Me? Never.” Sirius wiggled his eyebrows facetiously and placed his own hand on top of Remus’s. There was a brief silence between them, butterflies clearly coating the air.
Blaise leaned inward and was whispering something to Pansy. She nodded and slowly began inching her way to the boy on the ground, just enough to remain unnoticed.
And Potter would laugh. It was a peculiar sound, a dancing rhythm from his grin that sent Draco’s head reeling. He’d never noticed the small dimples in his cheeks, or the way he folds his lips when he’s concentrating. Little details that left him wondering what else he’d missed about Potter all these years.
It was the fucking snake. Nagini, the one who’d lived with them for months at Malfoy Manor. The one who the Dark Lord had fed numerous times in front of his followers, Draco chewing his cheek with silent opposition.
“You know, you’d have to actually get out of those restraints first.” He watched as his father continued to wiggle, lacking a witty response as he fought unsuccessfully to beak free.
He thought it would end, but the wand held steady as the punishment continued. Harry couldn’t breathe, he couldn’t think as his own body subconsciously flexed and tightened at every muscle. Discomfort turned to anger in a flashing fury as he watched the malicious glint reflect from Lucius Malfoy’s gaze.
An eternity stretched. No one fired a curse. No one twitched. And then...a loud clunk against the closed door of the cabinet.
An involuntary shudder traveled down his spine. His hands were so smooth, perfectly molded to the curvature of his face.
He wanted the reality where Malfoy had become Draco- where those gray eyes had locked into his own for moments at a time. Where they’d laughed together, and ironically created their own memories.
He watched the trail of a liar as he escalated the steps to his bedroom. And he’d never respected him more.
“You know what? Remus is right. Fuck you twats and your bigoted opinions. It’s none of your goddamn business what we do.”
Sirius and James looked at Peter, than at each other, with an expression of both great awe and amusement.
“Yeah, that’s what you’re gonna end up doing if you keep spending so much time with him.” Blaise flashed him a facetious grin, and the room bursted with howling laughter.
“Potter, wait.” Draco demanded helplessly, and he turned back. Malfoy was frozen for the moment, but finally formed he words.
“You could never kill me,” he says to the air, as the whisp of Lucius Malfoy’s presence fades into nothing. “It was just me, all along. Hurting myself because you trained me to. It wasn’t my fault. It wasn’t my fucking fault.”
“I saw Potter throw punches at you. I followed and heard you and Pansy talking in the infirmary. I knew that you had some kind of... feelings for him or something. And that was all I needed to know to go forward with my own plan.”
“Well, I have. And let me tell you,” he leaned in, his whisper hot and heavy against the shell of his ear. “You are going to be amazing.”
Pansy laughed too before closing the space between them, pressing her lips cautiously against Draco’s. He held frozen, clearly inexperienced and unsure of what to do next.
Draco paused; Harry cocked his head. Damn, those Slytherins were cunning. Pansy’s objective and intricate line of thinking had flown right past Harry’s obvious line of thought. Draco pressed his lips into a hard line as he contemplated her words.
And Draco sobs, without really knowing how to stop, and Harry’s skin is warm against his own. It’s the first time he’s ever really felt whole.
“We’re drunk,” Harry said as the world began to sway, reflecting outside what he so desperately felt within.
Leading them was none other than Lucius Malfoy. Harry stole a glance at Draco, who seemed relaxed as ever. It appeared that he really had in fact been set free.
He pivoted on his heel to rejoin his group, but paused momentarily to jut out his chin and spit directly at the two Gryffindors.
“So, Peter, any girls in our year that you fancy?” Sirius nodded his head at the boy, who turned three shades redder as he retracted within himself.
In his peripheral vision, Harry began to see figures. Glancing in their direction revealed a very recent Draco Malfoy perched in his own hospital bed with a bottle of skele-gro in one hand and the other cradling his jaw.
A wicked laugh from behind them. “You can’t run from your demons, Draco! They are your demons, after all!”
His fingers gripped tendrils of raven hair by the handful, tugging him impossibly closer. Harry only responded by mashing himself against his body, yearning for every piece of their essence to become matched. The Gryffindor seemed to lurch forward, teeth clicking against Draco’s as he allowed his mouth to succumb fully to their kiss. His hands were warm and left tingles as they wrapped around the bare skin of Draco’s neck.
Draco gasped softly from beside Harry, engrossed in the conflict. Clearly wanting Regulus to pull his head out of his arse. Using this memory as a learning tool for himself and all that he now stood for.
They stuck close, able to see the gang ahead some yards away by the faded light of their own charms. Harry’s heart was pounding with each step, fearful for what would happen to the Marauders.
“Me, too, mate. He sounds pretty torn up about what happened.” James wiped the blackberries from his face before Sirius exploded.
Harry readied himself to pace back and forth, contemplating with complete focus on finding the Death Eaters. But as soon as they approached their goal, a large set of wooden doors seemed to appear from thin air. Draco eyed them suspiciously, and Harry couldn’t help but join him.
Something was definitely off. And Draco was nowhere to be found. The silence rattled a sort of tenseness down his spine. A sense of impending dread prickled from his hair to his toes as he stepped forward, wandless and wondering what in the fuck was going to happen next.
But despite the discomfort of pins and needles prickling every surface of his body, Harry suddenly was coherent enough to realize that he wasn’t in pain anymore. What the...
“Draco!” He called as Hermione lowered the volume with a flick of her wand. “This is nothing but Taylor Swift!”
Malfoy’s hands were splayed before him, struggling for balance as their equilibrium was thrown into motion. Something in Harry was disappointed that it wasn’t his forearm he was using to steady himself.
“We looked everywhere, mate. The Astronomy Tower. The infirmary. Hell, we even checked the library!” Harry chuckled at his exuberance.
If he would’ve kept his mouth shut, quelled his Gryffindor instincts and pressed his lips into a hard line of defiance, then maybe he wouldn’t be here. But, no.
“That’s because he’s more of a brother to you, right? James Potter, perfect, Gryffindor James Potter always coming to your goddamn rescue.”
“You in, Peter?” Sirius’s face was positively glowing, the way it always seemed to when Remus was the subject matter.
“Fiendfyre.” Granger’s voice pierces the quiet confusion. “It’s a dark enough spell to destroy a horcrux. That’s why when you dropped the diadem, Harry, it disentigrated.”
“Yeah, I did too.” They crept forward, almost there, and anticipation slowly began to prickle the crown of Harry’s Head. What would they find when they entered? The Headmaster? The culprit? Voldemort himself?
And suddenly his stupor was broken by a very self-appeased Pansy Parkinson suggesting that they lock each other in a closet for seven minutes and see what happens. “It’s a muggle game! Hermione told me about it,” she chattered, and Harry noticed Hermione’s cheeks blushing the same way that Draco’s had. What the fuck?
“Oh, shut up.” Harry insulted flippantly, grasping the sides of his head and pulling him insatiably forward for a kiss.
Thank you for reading this far! I promise this story is already complete, I just may be a bit slow at uploading chapters. I’m hoping to have it completely posted by tomorrow! I hope you enjoy it so far!! ❤️
One bed to the right was Black himself, hair grown out past his shoulders and bearing a frame that was all muscle. He laid back dramatically with a sigh.
“Alright, Remus, we’re here and we’re ready to party.” James Potter threw open the rickety door with Black and Pettigrew by his side.
Teddy is spending the night at the Burrow, and Draco and Harry are doing their usual dance of washing and putting away the dishes.
“What is it with you and Potter? Like we get it, you don’t like each other, but why do you two always go out of your way to talk shit? It’s like you’re both obsessed with each other or something.”
“Perhaps you should join the other students in the Great Hall. It would, of course, be safer for you that way. To answer your question, however, I believe they have entered from the somewhere on the seventh floor.”
And with that, the ultimate compliment of respect that had Draco’s cheeks burning with excitement, he turned to collect the others.
A knock on the door interrupted his cries, and he quickly wiped his tears with the back of his hand while stifling a sniffle.
“Hey, look,” he instructed, turning toward the body that was walking beneath the stands. “Isn’t that Pettigrew?”
There was no sign of Wormtail or Prongs anywhere. Harry’s eyes darted about, determined to land on him but coming up vastly empty. Where the fuck were the others? Had they run? That would’ve been smart, but not quite in the style of James Potter. He’d have to be around there. Somewhere.
But in all of his Gryffindor courage, somewhere he fell short. Scratching the back of his head nervously, he hurriedly switched gears.
He smiled to himself, able to feel the heat radiating from his blush. His fingers brushed lightly against it, and it was evident that Remus experienced an involuntary shudder. For a moment, his eyes closed, and his mouth dropped in a state of heaven. Sirius couldn’t help himself. Seeing Remus so relaxed, so naturally beautiful... it was too much and not enough all at once.
And then coincidentally Ron and Blaise were the first to end up locked away together, and from the suspicious noises coming from behind the door, Harry assumed they’d figured out they were in each other’s company. Was he fucking dreaming?
Suddenly, the door flung open once more to reveal the presence of Kingsley Shacklebolt amongst several other aurors who’d arrived after receiving Dumbledore’s message.
His brows immediately furrowed. “You get to make out with a girl and I have to expose myself to a bloody cat!?”
With an unruly gust of wind, the fire died down to smoldering orange and black ashes. And Draco was alone.
Something behind Harry caught Draco’s attention, and before he pivoted to investigate he noticed a deep blush blooming across cheeks. Silly git, what was that for?
He was bawling, and angry, and desperate in the pictures, but Harry had seen all of these emotions from Draco before. He stood there, wide eyed, staring blankly as the wind continued to twist around them. Harry could only watch as he re-lived his most repressed memories, shaking profusely as the images became more grotesque.
And then Luna (was she even an eighth year?) ended up with Ginny, and Dean with Seamus, and suddenly drunk Harry was wondering if Pansy was behind these matches or if this was one big coincidence.
All of Draco’s bigoted behavior suddenly made sense now. Like pieces clicking in place, Harry saw clear as day through his mind’s eye every insult thrown his way, every sneer sent in his direction. The blood supremacist jabs toward Hermione; the monetary bias toward Ron. Every single one of them was a front. An attempt to win at the game his father was playing, and he never even had a chance.
Harry stole a glance to his right, desperate to see the reaction written across his face. He felt featherlight, even more so now that he was armed with the knowledge that Draco Malfoy had obviously contemplated some type of relationship between them prior to all of this. He grinned as his eyes befell crimson red cheeks that matched the memory of the Draco before them.
Harry glanced back and forth, taking in the scene before him, trying to comprehend not only what was happening but also what in the fuck happened to Draco.
“Well, forgive me, Black, but it appears that Bella and I are a little... preoccupied?” Snape lifted his hands in the air in a gesture of sarcastic surrender.
“I don’t need help, Lily.” The words dripped like poison from Snape’s mouth, a cold and uncaring break of their friendship.
“Well, duh.” Sirius answered, a wide grin spread across his face. “But think about it. We could spend the entire moon with Remus. He wouldn’t hurt us if we were animals. And we could keep him from injuring himself as much.”
The morphing of three unregistered animagi as Remus emerged in wolf form snapped him from his reverie.
Firstly, his thumb glided in downward motion as he pressed it. Secondly, the rest of the students filed in from Quidditch, faces painted in red and gold, green and silver. Third, it appeared that Hermione’s magic was more solid than she’d anticipated.
“Professor, one more thing,” Draco pressed, curious. “Where did you get the memories that we were taken through?”
He jolts back to look at him, but his lids have come to a gentle close. His chest rises and falls in a shallow rhythm, and Harry notices the amount of blood that’s pooled around them.
Missing something. Needing something. Barely hanging on. Clinging to the idea of his friends for support.
When they passed the large gargoyle at the entrance to the office, Dumbledore was nowhere to be found. They glanced up and down the corridor, not a soul in sight, and proceeded to head to the nearest staircase.
“Wh-what does that have to do with anything? And Why do you care?” Peter spat frantically, questionable regret coating his voice.
“I know it’s you.” Harry whispered suddenly as he felt that breath come even closer, hot and heavy against his lips.
“I’m sorry I called you crazy. You’re not crazy!” He yelled over the pounding thunder, pressing forward with another step.
He quelled his Gryffindor instinct, however, when another idea crossed his mind. If Draco wouldn’t wake, he’d just have to get him out of there on his own.
“Leave them alone!” Lily cried from beneath James’s arm, but Sirius was already standing and fumbling for his wand.
There was silence as their eyes held, emotions running high, Remus still processing what they’d done for him. He couldn’t help the tears that blinded him, making his vision cloudy.
Remus Lupin was pale. He didn’t move a muscle, didn’t twitch an inch. There was a greenish hue to his cheeks, like he might just up and vomit at any second.
“Not particularly, no. It’s kind of nice and relaxing viewing these memories, now that I know you’re alive and all.”
The common room twisted and comforted into a starry night sky. Two boys at the rail, gazing forward after a long day of detention.
Draco, for a split second, appeared as if he might cry. Pansy, with a satisfied smile, began stirring counter clockwise.
Draco’s heart skipped a sunken beat, trying to absorb every moment through the yellow haze that was currently his world. What in the actual fuck had he just heard?
Harry shared a smile with Ron, whose understanding nod was enough to make him burst with relief. His friends were here, and they were safe. They’d defeated the Death Eaters, for now. Draco had won them a solid victory. The Slytherins had arrived in the nick of time. Everything seemed to happen with purpose, pieces falling fatefully into place.
He’d never had to pretend. He’d never had the weight of his parent’s lives toppling against his shoulders; Voldemort had already robbed them from him.
“Well, I’m sorry to inform you that the rumors have already started, darling. Apparently you and Potter had quite the row.”
“Okay, Potter. Let’s be fair. When you stop being such an egotistical, selfish prat, I’ll go to Hogsmeade with you.” She glanced down at her page, ending the conversation with her lack of attention.
The fingertips were soft, and warm, and he found himself not minding one bit that Malfoy was using him to steady himself. Even if that’s all it was.
Draco and Harry sped past her, no longer caring if they could see ahead. They had to protect Remus, and the animagi.
In his place was a small rodent, brown and almost measly, with a long, wiry tale and a twitching nose.
As they passed the area where the Marauders rested, it surprisingly looked like they weren’t going to stop. No snide comments; no rude glances in their direction. It was almost suspicious, how indifferent they were.
He was in what appeared to be the Department of Mysteries. Rows and rows of glowing white orbs lines shelves on either side of the room. He slowly stepped forward, brow creased as he wondered how the fuck Draco had any memory of this place. It couldn’t have been his own; his solitude lacked the necessary presence of those who had traveled with him to this place last year.
Together they snuck out of the Great Hall, and Harry followed earnestly. It was much more entertaining than re-living his own experience at the Yule Ball.
Ron grinned, up for the challenge. “You know it. Don’t expect to walk away without your arse handed to you, though.”
As Filch hurried toward the noise, Crabbe seized his opportunity and began unbuckling his trousers. In the presence of several whispered giggles and chattering from the alcove, Crabbe turned toward the cat and slid his pants down. Pansy was completely incoherent, drooling with laughter to the point that Draco was casting silencing charms around them.
“Oh, don’t worry about it.” She flipped her hair behind her shoulder. “I wonder what they’re going to serve tonight. I’m starving.”
Harry lifted his head, finally in control of his muscles. A sudden wind seemed to whip out of nowhere. He could see Draco shielding his eyes as the memory orbs around them shook and threatened to break. He focused on the older Malfoy’s form, who rested his shoulders in an amused fashion. He bore a wicked grin on his face.
Everything remained coated in pitch black darkness. He groaned, adjusting his glasses merely by touch as he pulled himself to a standing position. Extending his arms forward, he wondered what in the hell he was going to do next, when the world began to brighten.
The sound of triumphant joking bounced along the group as they returned to their post by the fire, resuming their same seating pattern.
This time, Pettigrew and Potter himself were absent. In their place was a relaxed Sirius Black, seated casually next to a laughing Remus Lupin.
He still couldn’t see the boy’s face, but the slump of his shoulders gave away his disappointment and blatant disheartenment. Harry wanted to stomp up to the man, to ask him what the hell was so important that he couldn’t pay attention to his son.
He needed to be strong, too. For him. So, even as the world faded, much too dark this time, and he heard one last spoken “Reinervate...” he vowed to hold on with everything he had.
When they stepped onto the seventh floor, things were eerily silent. Harry wasn’t sure what he was expecting:  maybe some dueling, or the cries of an injured Death Eater. But all that was heard was the quiet plank of their footsteps.
Harry could almost feel the wind whipping against his face. The freedom permeating the air, the openness of the expanding horizon.
“Why didn’t you?” Harry asks, and he’s hooked on this selfless version of the enemy that only Death seemed to twist into reality.
Draco’s eyes are prickly, and he’s not sure why there are tears surfacing at such an inopportune moment. Perhaps he’s gone completely insane... or maybe...
No longer trying to hide their romance, Remus Lupin and Sirius Black were tangled up in one another, hands far from lonely. Peter laid with his eyes closed, soaking up the rays and debatably napping.
There were women in ball gowns, men in suits and proper wizard robes. At a table in the forefront sat the familiar figures of Pansy and Hermione.
When he was rejected by Potter on the train, he was hurt. Baffled. Lost. His father had always told him to stay in good standing with those who held power, and, wow, if he hadn’t already fucked that up.
At once, his father was vomiting. Lily was patting a gentle hand on his back, trying to prevent him from aspirating.
Sirius continued to plant kisses to the side of his neck, trailing up to the base of his jaw and rubbing his nose gently along his ear... “mhm. You’re right, Rem. You’re pretty loud.”
“Is that any way to talk to Daddy dearest? May I remind you just of who you’re talking to?” His voice was sharp and ghastly, a menacing undertone taking precedence.
“One of the goals of your detention was to show you both that differences and similarities walk a fine line. I was hoping that through the memories you would learn more about each other, as well as those depicted. Would you say you’ve accomplished this?”
He allows his thoughts to consume him, until his leg is painless. He’s floating, flying… until he’s not.
“I don’t get it!” He complained pathetically, falling into a chair. “Why doesn’t she like me, Remus? You guys are friends.”
The crisp night air was clear; the sky was a royal blue painted with stars. Harry immediately became entranced by it and headed to the rail for a better look.
“I never said I hated him.” Malfoy was strangely defensive, and Harry eyed him suspiciously before continuing through the shack.
“Oh, Draco.” She placed her hands on each of his shoulders. “Butterflies. A whirlwind of emotion. A longing to never let each other go.” She drew her words dramatically, banking on the edges of hopeless romance. And then, she laughed.
“Fuck the Malfoy family! They’re as bad as the Blacks!” Sirius’s voice was rising, blood pumping loudly through his veins. Remus could hear it whooshing through his chest violently as he continued to rest against it. And then, he gazed downward at the boy who could very well have been sleeping against his body, and he visibly melted.
“I- you-“ Harry stuttered, realizing that for some reason, Malfoy wasn’t going to hit him back. He shuffled confusedly, trying to make sense of what had happened. He didn’t get much farther before McGonnagal approached them.
“God, I never would’ve had the courage to tell you that if I wasn’t completely pissed. I’m no Gryffindor.”
He’s on the bed, and now Draco is crying. Yelling. Laughing hysterically. Because he’s fucking insane, sitting in a bed half-naked with Harry Potter and telling himself to shut his fucking mouth before Teddy wakes up.
“Blaise!” Pansy cried excitedly as he separated from his parents, who made their way to the elvish wine and horderves.
Draco lowered his wand and turned back to the Dark Lord, unable to look Pettigrew in the eye. It was this gesture that assured Harry of his unadulterated innocence.
Malfoy shrugs. “Didn’t seem right. I was tired of manipulation. I’ve always been a follower, and I figured that if I couldn’t be a leader, I could at least support one. I knew you had a chance at setting the world free from the same bullshit that ended up killing me.”
“Ah, come to join the party, I see?” A haughty and detestable glint reflected off each iris as he folded his arms behind him and began to pace. “Severus, why don’t you come hither to your own side?” He cocked his head, challenging his Godfather. Like he knew something no one else did.
“You didn’t know it, but I was there. I was in the compartment behind you on the train this year. I heard about your loyalty to the Dark Lord.
And Sirius Black wasted no time in slinging hexes in Lucius Malfoy’s direction. Beside him, Remus Lupin sat calmly in wolf form.
“I wouldn’t put it past her. You are the Savior of the Wizarding world. I’m sure she’d love to get into your pants.”
“My father always said that Sirius Black was a traitor. That he disgraced my mother’s family. But he never told me why.” His expression was blank and lacked the usual contempt that Harry expected.
“Come on, let’s not let Peter start eating himself.” Remus stood, extending a hand to help Sirius lift upward.
Eventually, Draco used his palms to press himself upward. He still struggled to catch his breath as he stood, chest rising and falling rapidly against his determination.
“No, Peter. Don’t do it.” The words were a soft whisper from beside Harry, a plea for integrity. For redemption.
And now, it had bit him right in the arse. Just a bit lower in all technicality, but Draco didn’t care. He just wanted solace.
“There, look, it’s a trap door. We’ve found it!” Malfoy exclaimed excitedly, making his move to enter the shack. Bellatrix cackled exuberantly, Regulus and Snape held their wands forward. Prepared.
He could see the doorway ahead, a looming entrance beyond that fueled his exhausted legs. He only now realized that he was sweating, droplets rolling off the back of his neck from the anticipation.
“What if you would’ve gotten caught!? Don’t you know you could go to Azkaban for this!? Why would you do that for me? I am not worth that!”
“Your first task, my dear servant, is quite painful I’m afraid. But it is something you must endure.” Voldemort appeared smug, God-like, as if he and only he possessed the secrets of time. He scavenged Draco up and down, eyes hungry and teetering on the edges of reward and punishment.
Draco smiled softly at the sentiment. Harry, following a bit of courage, draped an arm around his waist.
Draco Malfoy limps. He fucking drags his leg behind him, pushing forward and sacrificing every ounce of repituity while doing so.
And Draco was laughing now, and they both were sharing in some kind of undiscovered release of tension between them. Like everything beyond this moment would figure itself out on its own.
Colors ran, molding and mixing into another memory that displayed itself with unspoken significance.
Was it Harry they wanted? To finally take him o Voldemort for one final kill? Or was their presence completely accidental, and was it the Headmaster that they awaited?
He wasn’t drowning, or floating, but was suspended somewhere between the two. It wasn’t bliss, but it was far more tolerable than despair.
“Avada Kedavra!” He screamed, and Harry’s eyes snapped upward at the sound. Everything was muffled, the commotion was silenced, the edges of his field of view were blurry. In the center of everything, he saw clear as day the complete craze, the wild ecstasy that danced successfully in Malfoy’s eyes. The beam of green light that was emitted from his wand was aimed directly at Remus Lupin.
The blonde was visibly shaking across from him. “Don’t tell me to calm the fuck down! I have every right to be upset!” Another object from the living room table was pelted in his direction. For the second time that day, Harry hastily lunged downward.
“Because you’re my brother!” Regulus’s carefully planned facade had crumbled. Here, in the middle of the hall at the witching hour, they were no longer Gryffindor and Slytherin. They were family.
Black’s fingers began tracing the back of Remus’s hand softly, a small gesture that did not go unnoticed by Harry.
“Draco, you just wait until I get out of here! You better hope I don’t see your face again!” The irate snap of the Elder Malfoy broke the tranquil mood of the gang as he passed by, levitated by Shacklebolt himself.
Both Draco and Harry lurched forward, eager to see what the writing entailed. When Draco’s shoulder brushed unexpectedly against Harry’s, even the time within the pensieve seemed to slow.
“Your father is one of his favorites. If his life is at stake, all of our parents’ lives are.” Blaise observed, an expression of deep thought pulling at the edges of his face.
Like it had been so many years ago when they first fell in love, wrapped up in the memory of the very inspiration for his research. Re-living a love story that was soon to become their own.
They could’ve stayed like that forever, but why would they? There was an entire world outside of the pensieve waiting to be conquered.
Everything went fuzzy, like static.  It was probably because his body couldn’t take it any more, not when it’s own psyche had betrayed it.
That warm feeling threaded through Draco’s hands and feet. Because he knew, even in his godfathers short and abrupt language, that it was true.
He lacked words, and luckily Draco continued. “He treats me similarly. You think it’d make a difference that I’m his son, but it doesn’t.”
After the wolf led a trail of sniffs down Jame’s back and Peter’s tail, it seemed to move on and accept them as if they’d always been there.
There was no pulling out of this spell, no manipulation tactics that could break the hold on his limbs. Draco Malfoy had- against all odds- overpowered his father. His face held a mixture of exasperation and disbelief, feeling drained and yet the most alive he’d ever been.
“Speak for yourself, Pads.” Remus turned and pressed his lips to Black’s. It was sweet but bore an intensity that suddenly had Harry longing to grasp onto the blonde beside him for an encore. The love that those two shared was painfully obvious, and it caused Harry’s heart to throb with desire. Because the feeling that resonated between them with each kiss was achingly similar to how he felt about the boy who was currently holding his hand. He hiccuped, trying actively to suppress the giddy disbelief that bubbled in his chest as the scene played out.
“Hey, so I just thought about how we call you Moony,” Peter piped from across the table. “Why don’t I get a cool nickname?”
This time, they landed near the Great Lake. The sky was a crisp blue, evident even in the dull hues of the memory. Several students were outside; some where studying, others were playing games.
“Mr. Potter, Ms. Evans, would you two please kindly escort your peers to the infirmary? It will be a long walk through Hogsmeade but I feel that it is worth it.” His eyes told the story his words lacked:  keep the hidden passage secret.
As he approached, Malfoy removed himself from his post and muttered the password that caused the gargoyle to leap aside. Wordlessly, he led the ascent to their doom.
Now, she was turning to face the Slytherins. “I was just- they were- I’m only trying to do what’s right!” She huffed drastically, unsure of what to make of the unforeseen rejection.
“Uhm, no, it’s just... it’s just...” Harry suddenly couldn’t spit out the words that were scrambled and fried within his mind. Those lips. Those eyes. The way he moved gracefully and effortlessly in a fashion that opposed his own blunt clumsiness. All at once, he knew. It wasn’t the music. It was Draco. It was everything about him.
When they were in closed quarters, Sirius turned to a bashful Remus. “Okay, Rem. With the full moon coming tomorrow, this is the perfect time to show you what we’ve been working on.”
“When McGonagall started rounding up the students, we knew something wasn’t right. We tried to come find you. And, when you weren’t in the Headmaster’s office, it became sort of a guessing game.” Ron nodded, continuing the story.
The expression on Draco’s face was hopeful. He was talking about becoming a potions master. About following his own dreams.
One environment faded into another entirely, and Harry was interested to see that he’d landed in the midst of the Slytherin common room. It was dark, and the fire blazed an unlikely green flame.
Voldemort’s expression was sickeningly cruel; like he got off on this specifically. Watching his followers suffer for him in an egotistical competition against himself and his own power.
Either way, the temptation was far too strong to resist, and he knew that the rest of the eighth years would be back any minute from the younger students’ quidditch match. So with a sinking feeling in his gut, he reached forward.
“Who’s a good boy, who’s a good boy?” Peter dramatically called, speaking in a high pitched whine that had Sirius growling and James giggling.
The edges of the dormitory began to darken, leading them to a place that lacked the warmth of hugs and lit lanterns.
“Isn’t it obvious?” Hermione rolled her eyes. “She healed Harry by using the Liquid Luck. After consuming Felix Felicis, everything you attempt is more likely to succeed.”
“Ms. Evans, you followed trouble and it led you to danger. And as for you two,” he gestured to Sirius and James, “I’m not sure what encouraged you to enter that shack, but you put everyone’s lives at risk by being there. Including Mr. Lupin’s.”
Next to him, Sirius Black was gazing into the distance. Thinking about anything but transfiguration, it seemed. Settling upon some idea, he turned to Remus with a soft smile and nudged his arm. The boy jumped slightly but relaxed when he realized that it was just Sirius, who was now excitedly scratching a note with his quill.
It must’ve been obvious, completely and utterly blatant that he’d been so engrossed in the couple before them that it quite literally took his breath away. Because Malfoy, instead of performing the Heimlich Maneuver or spelling him some air, stood their laughing.
“I don’t have mine either.” He eyed Malfoy curiously before shrugging. “Might as well go on without it.” As he lowered himself through the door, Draco Malfoy refused to be silent about his uneasiness.
Draco held his stare for a moment. He’d never noticed how soft those eyes were albeit their vibrancy. Sharp but honest. Pure.
“I have no doubt in my mind that you will do great things in my name,” He declared confidently, “but I must know that your intentions are pure. I have a few...challenges for you to endure.”
He focuses instead on the vibrancy of his stare, the way his green eyes cut through him like no one else ever could. The soft patches of dirt that bespeckle his face and hands from battle. The beads of sweat that slowly trickle down the side of his neck, reflecting his urgency.
His stare is piercing. It cuts through every guarded wall Draco has spent the past few weeks constructing.
“They don’t know, Rem. They think they know something. They don’t fucking know anything. I won’t let them know anything.”
There’s a tightness in his chest, and it fluctuates with his heart rate. Harry is having a nightmare, and it’s all his fault.
“I can’t do that. Not when all of the precious students’ lives are at risk.” Malfoy frowned dramatically, feigning compassion at its best.
That was the year he faked his attempts to kill Dumbledore. That was the year he held his wand to the man, playing the role astutely. He never had any intention of ending his life, and it showed. It was all a part of Draco’s plan.
It was simple, and to the point, and it revealed nothing about how he actually felt. If it weren’t for everything he’d witnessed and gone through with the bloke in detention recently, he would’ve been offended and went on his way.
Through the alcove stepped Albus Dumbledore with a calm and collected manner that was almost contagious. The entire room was silenced by his presence.
He wasn’t floating anymore. He was sinking. Drowning. Anchored by the reverberations of depression that coursed familiarly through his veins. He’d almost forgotten, but he never would truly be able to lose this feeling...
His eyes shut. Harry’s did too. And in the next second Draco’s lips were pressed against his. The moment was short, but infinite in its own right.
When Umbridge took reign of Hogwarts, Draco had a rather lengthy speech given to him by his father about how “impressions are everything.” He was instructed to remain on her good side, regardless of the price.
And he could take it no longer.  He lifted his other hand, resting it on his left temporal bone, pulling him closer...
“I- I didn’t mean that-“ Regulus stuttered after a moment, backtracking on what had been spoken without thought.
They didn’t even down half of it before it became uncomfortably obvious that they were drunk. Harry was sure it was their tiny stature and pre-pubescent livers that had done them in.
“Oh my god, Moony, did you just agree!? Did we just-“ his features were ecstatic as he pulled him up the rest of the way and pressed their lips together again.
Holding a soft expression, an almost contemplative face, Harry felt his own lips tug upward. “It’s nothing.”
“You can live forever in my subconscious, but you can’t survive here. Not out in the open. Not where you become just another memory for me to file away.”
“I happen to disagree. The more darkness you feel and experience, the bigger I become. And the more power I receive.”
Harry didn’t dare look at Draco as the world began to darken. It was too much for him to process. His cheeks burned as he watched them. Their kiss was his own personal train wreck, an awakening that hit him full force. There was a reason he and Ginny had never snogged like that, and deep down he’d always known why.
“...while the other survives.” He finished, eyes malicious and unyielding. Harry blinked comprehensively. When he failed to draw the necessary conclusion, he got angry.
His body was buckling, and Harry knew he was having some sort of panic attack. The trauma, it was far too much... Harry wouldn’t blame the boy for giving in, his father’s hold on him much like the kiss of a dementor...
He was definitely in awe at how Draco held him, how his hands slid down to his hip bones and hooked there. There was no comparing the smoothness of his stomach nestled against the groove of his own, their legs almost intertwined, and something warm, pressing against the inside of his leg...
But before he could react any further, he was already tossing his wand to the boy. “Potter! Here!” He called, and Harry caught it mid-air with a beaming grin.
All in all, eighth year was more than just preparing for NEWTS. It seemed that it was educational in all kinds of ways, and at the end of the day, the golden trio had learned more than they would’ve ever expected from the silver trio. And, on top of that, everyone seemed to learn that when Seamus Finnigan was drunk, you should just go ahead and listen.
“Tell my brother that I need to speak with him, Lupin.” His voice was threatening, but Remus didn’t back down. He rose to a standing position, height clearly an advantage against the younger Slytherin.
His eyes were a vibrant green, a certain shade that only revealed itself when he smiled. Draco felt his belly expand, radiating a weightless sensation throughout his entire being.
It was James’s turn to be on the receiving end of the growl. With a laugh from the others, Sirius morphed back. His face was beaming with excitement.
“I don’t know. All I know is that they know about me. And I’m trying to enjoy my last- however long it’s going to be- here, with you, but I just...”
And, suddenly, as a bolt of lighting lit up the sky... Draco was crying. There was thunder, and wind, and he was soaked to the bone... and he sobbed. Because he wasn’t good enough. Because Harry deserved better. Because this time, what if he really had ended it all?
“Harry,” the soft whisper of Draco snapped him from his reverie. “It’s time to fight the real enemy here.”
“You- are you saying that you haven’t done ANYTHING? That you’ve got nothing for me to take back to the Dark Lord regarding your progress!?”
Harry’s smile faded considerably upon turning to the git, whose face had paled several shades closer to white.
Draco held his wand forward, unwavering. Harry stood wordlessly but beamed at the undying determination of the boy next to him. There was absolutely no doubt about any of this now.
It was almost as if this was set up, like they were walking head first into something premeditated. A trap.
Shadows merged to form the familiar shape of a girl, and even in the blur Harry could recognize that form. She was Draco’s best friend, the support he’d needed through everything. But why was she in front of him? Almost... above him?
With this in mind, Harry began to sift through the objects on his desk, searching for anything that might be a clue. He turned to the bookshelf, running his hand along the spine of several works, eyeing the titles for anything regarding memories or the pensieve. Failure seemed imminent, and he turned to make sure that nothing around him had changed.
“So, Draco, Who are you going to the Yule Ball with?” A slender girl with dirty blonde hair crossed her legs as she made herself comfortable next to the Malfoy heir. Harry immediately recognized her as Daphne Greengrass, another Slytherin in their year.
The first few cracks of his injured form had Draco wincing. He stood beside Potter, rooted to the floor with an emotion that had previously been unlearned:  sympathy.
“I know that you two have somewhat of a jagged history. But I do hope that in these dire times you may be able to set aside your differences as you seem to have been doing in detention.” He glanced between the two, and Harry nodded determinedly.
He then turned to his friends, who were currently held at Wand point by a now standing James and Lily.
“Theodore, you can come out now.” From behind the cabinet stepped the fellow Slytherin, wand by his side as he came to the forefront.
At the far end of the Hall was a large stage, adorned with floating lanterns and a centralized podium that was decorated with carnations.
“Professor Dumbledore? Can you hear me?” He asked aloud, in somewhat of a dumb fashion, grasping for anything that would lead him to the missing Malfoy.
Harry stood slowly, having fallen from the haste of his chase. He then glanced around cautiously, observing his surroundings with utter and blatant confusion.
“What did you do to him!? Potter!” Snape drew his wand before he could answer. He stuttered a bit, hands still raised in surrender. It was at this moment that Bellatrix and Regulus began to stir.
The next few moments were spent stupidly captivated by the bloke against him, wondering if he’d died and gone to heaven. A heaven that would’ve been hell just a few days ago.
“You know, Draco, you don’t have to move into another building. I know you hate your neighbors because they remind you of your family. Our flat is large enough for a third member.”
“Meddle with time, Harry, I know.” He rolled his eyes at Draco’s eerie likeness to Hermione in the present moment. He was grounding him, like she had tried to do so many times before. But with Draco, it was different. For some reason he couldn’t quite understand.
And that wasn’t Harry’s fault, but it also wasn’t something Draco could change. It was a never ending cycle, and, just as the rain fell from the sky, he would battle his own self destruction.
When Draco approached his unarmed opponent, the rest of the room was highly preoccupied. He rushed forward and came to an abrupt halt, Wand pointed inches from his father’s face.
He tilted his head, glancing about the room for some sort of answer to a question he wasn’t sure had been asked. And then, an idea occurred to him.
Draco winced, keeping his head forward. Harry followed as he coldly ascended the steps and emerged on the upper floor of Malfoy Manor.
He lowered his head before responding. “Imagine if I won, Zabini. I could use it...” His eyes were solemn but almost hopeful. Like liquid luck was the answer to all of his problems.
“I give that a 7. Pansy and I whooped y’all,” Blaise stared, and the playful humor of the soirée continued.
He didn’t have to see the crimson of his eyes to know exactly who the shadow belonged to. Even in a memory, he felt something thick lodge itself in the back of his throat.
It was dark again, and for a moment Harry pondered the possibility of their setting as the dungeons at Hogwarts. The ungodly silhouette of something inhuman, almost serpentlike against the dim lighting had him discarding that theory with an involuntary shudder.
No, he refused to believe that the Draco he so desperately sought after was the boy running cowardly from the restricted section. And suddenly another emotion entirely flooded through Harry’s being:  anger.
Directly in front of him, his father rose and stepped forward. This was his opportunity, the moment just before his father would regain full capacity.
Harry smiled, acutely cognizant of the reactionary tightening of Draco’s body against his own. His pulse was hammering; he wanted to continue like this forever. But something inside was slowing down, enjoying every moment. Hitting the breaks on the hungriness that threatened to devour them whole.
Draco’s eyes flickered down to Harry’s abdomen, or perhaps something lower, and had it not been for his Godfather getting it on a few feet away he knew he’d use this moment to claim Draco as his own.
The world around him was dark, but he didn’t mind. Nothing could bother him here. Not in this dream, or reality, or whatever it was...
Harry stole a glance at Draco, whose eyes had gone wide with anticipation. He watched their every move, contemplated what was coming. At Sirius’s remark, a small gasp escaped his mouth.
He nodded again, still woozy but coming to by the second. The loud crack of spells being cast was suddenly magnified as his hearing restored. He gasped, glancing around and suddenly remembering where the hell he was.
The day that Harry asked Draco Malfoy to marry him he was also the day that he was forced to see a Healer.
Some of these orbs were blank as he touched them- memories that hadn’t yet been filled. He backtracked, racing along the same aisle, touching each ball of white light softly until-
Voldemort smiled. “Yes, the grand Harry Potter is about to be extinguished. And in your death, only then can I truly... survive.”
When Draco was eight, he’d drawn a portrait of his family. It was an assignment by his private tutor, a sort of busy-work while she prepared more practice for magical theory. He’d drawn them, stoic and cold, using shades of gray and black to fill in the spaces between them. They didn’t touch, didn’t love. Lucius told him that artists didn’t make any money in the Wizarding World. Draco ripped up the drawing and threw it in the rubbish bin.
Harry wept. He didn’t know why. All of the emotions he felt, every one of them was far too real to be a dream...
Albus Dumbledore, in all of his omnipotence, smiled softly. “Mr. Malfoy, Dare I Say that I am very proud of the young man you have become. Now, if the both of you will take my hand...”
He felt like vomiting. What was going to happen? Was Sirius’s memory charm advanced enough to permanently erase their memories of Remus? Where the fuck was Draco? Harry refused to lose him. There had to be a way... he had to be around here somewhere...tucked away safely in a...
“Me? Careful? Never.” Black’s flippant tone was nothing short of affectionate, the smile dripping from his voice.
Dumbledore smiled. “Why, they were a combination of vials collected from myself, Professor Lupin, and mostly your Godfather, Harry.”
And suddenly, in the heat of the moment, a revelation crossed over him like a shooting comet in the night sky. He felt a ton of things, but none of those was free.
He said nothing, evaluating the change of routine skeptically before leaning his head back against the wall. “Is this the part where you insult me?”
He landed in the tight embrace of Sirius Black, who instinctively jumped to catch him. His arms were wrapped warmly around him as his reality began to crumble in the form of sobs.
“Though it seems as if you were well taken care of.” Hermione finished, eyeing the Slytherins thankfully. “I’m thoroughly confused, I must admit, but any friend of Harry’s is a friend of ours.”
He shifted his focus to the other two; Albus Dumbledore’s arm extended for him to take hold. And something about the way those words had rolled off of Draco’s tongue, so firm and resolute and brand new... it sparked a fire within him.
“Oh, so it’s ‘we’ with you two? I always knew Draco was a poof, but harry? I guess I expected more from the Chosen One.” He crossed his arms, wand still held firmly in his hand, and glared at the two with an amused smirk. He was far too confident, even if he was surrounded by armed members of their clan.
He spun his wand in a quick circular motion around his head, wielding a large blue light in the direction of Snape. It was immediately blocked by the Slytherin head of house. Dumbledore raised his wand in the air, pointing it at the ceiling and gathering power for his next spell.
A sigh of relief escaped as a small consequence of a much bigger picture. He was alive, and that was something.
James and Sirius went back and forth like they always did, laughing and jabbing and going on like brothers.
They were married with only family and close friends in Luna and Ginny’s back garden. Harry had to pause during their vows for a quick oxygen enhancement spell, but other than that it was as if he wasn’t sick at all. It was beautiful, and light, and for a moment... Draco could pretend that everything was going to be ok.
Remus stood frozen, still unable to move his hand for his wand. Instead, he held eyes with Lily, whose green irises were damp with worry.
It was a prospect he couldn’t pass up, regardless of doubt or fear. And so, with guts he hadn’t known he possessed, he spoke the spell that would come to change everything.
“Don’t let them bother you, Reg. Know that it grosses us all out equally,” Bellatrix added with a wicked grin.
The Death Eaters were propped stoically, as if they were puppets on strings, soldiers waiting for command to fire.
“But why?” Harry cocked his head, unable to wrap his brain around someone who would willingly die for him. Not with the intent of defeating Voldemort, or winning a war, or for other justifiable reasons... but simply because he was Harry.
“It’s good to have you back, Darling.” Narcissa moved forward, not daring to touch him but retrieving the decorative cane from his hand.
Draco hadn’t had nearly enough time to process it, but Harry’s humor was a comforting and oddly placed beacon in the storm that would become their punishment. Obviously, something had gone right. Even if they were teetering on the edges of expulsion.
“Even if you can wake him up, he will falter against me.” He called after confidently, but Harry continued forward without quarrel. He reached Draco, desperately throwing himself onto his hands and knees and giving him a quick once over.
This was infinitely worse than any words he could’ve thrown at them, any hand signals or insults jabbed their way. It was deep, and vulgar, and completely unacceptable.
Before he can answer, Draco points upward. “Potter, look,” He states, his hazy vision landing on the most peculiar glint of sapphire. “It’s a diadem. Isn’t it pretty?”
Harry blinked, then blinked again. He turned his head abruptly from side to side, then patted down his robes. He was in Dumbledore’s office.
Around them, the bright white background began to form into shapes. Rows of beds. Nightstands with potions and healing salves. The infirmary.
This realization was enough to move mountains. To scatter the seas. Suddenly Harry felt that he could do or be anything. It was Draco, and his unannounced support, that meant everything.
Hours pass, though the clock reads otherwise. And Draco tells him that he needs to go back to bed. That they’ve both got work in the morning, and Teddy is visiting Andromeda...
Remus, as if running on his own animal instinct, fled the room. Without hesitation, Sirius transformed back to canine form and followed.
Across from them sat James and Peter, each sipping on a butter beer and enjoying the event that was a Hogsmeade Saturday. Perched relaxedly in the Three Broomsticks, it appeared that nothing could ruin the sunshine that bled through the windows or the cool fall breeze outside.
He doesn’t have a lot of time; he’s figured that much out. Even if he manages to outrun Voldemort, the poison will still inevitably travel through his circulatory system. He’s already broken into a cold sweat as he approaches his destination.
Peter’s body began to transform, morphing and shifting between sizes and lengths. His arms bubbled, legs swelled, and face became engorged as his physique began to shrink.
He turns to glance over his shoulder when the sound of a child laughing fills the spaces between bustling bodies and adult feet. A familiar tuft of blue hair comes dashing forward, and Draco feels a momentary reprieve from his own hollow dissonance. His face lights up as the boy throws his arms around his neck, crying “Cousin Draco! What are you doing here?”
“Before your school year is concluded, I will have expected you to do a most honorable deed in my name. You will be the one to kill Albus Dumbledore.”
“Stop it! Please, stop it!” He yelped meaninglessly, but in a fit of coincidence it appeared that Voldemort had finished his game. With a flick of his wand, Draco was released, his back rising and falling with exhaustion as his chest heaved.
Blaise moved suavely across the circle to Pansy, who wrapped her arms around him exuberantly. It was clear that she was the type to put on a show if need be. She was the life of the party, and if it was fun, she was doing it. If she was forced to kiss her childhood best friend, it was going to be the hottest kiss any of them had ever witnessed.
His other arm instinctively crept forward, wrapping around Potter to rest by his other hand. His stomach lurched, but this time it was expanding, a balloon that had been patched. It swelled and sent waves of something- he couldn’t quite identify the feeling- along every inch of his being. His heart began to race, and it only continued to rapidly pulsate as Potter responded by gently rubbing his head against his chest.
He had every intention of doing so, but something uncontrollable came over him first:  a laugh. A giggle that welled from his stomach, bubbling upward as it escaped from his throat. There was something enchanting about how far they’d come. It was odd, and almost impossible, and Harry would have never seen it coming. And yet, here they were.
After the cat calls and the clapping (largely from the area of Hermione and Pansy) subdued, they separated and shared soft smiles that meant the world.
Sleeping softly, head nestled against his chest, was Draco Malfoy. His breath was a gentle tickle through his shirt, leaving a trail of goosebumps beneath the fabric. He was also... drooling, a bit, and Harry caught his own lips tugging upward at the sight.
How even after the death of James and Lily Potter, life had to continue in a gray monotony that only improved upon Sirius Black’s escape.
Draco’s head lolled a bit as he tried to pick up his pace, the footsteps behind him booming louder with closeness.
A sigh from the other Marauder, who briefly folded his head in his hands before turning back to Remus.
“Since yesterday, apparently.” He answered, chuckling to himself. Pansy flashed them a knowing glance that didn’t go past Hermione. She eyed them curiously before continuing.
“Don’t you?” She asked almost omnipotently. Neither of them said a word, lost in their own ideas of what was to come.
A quick pause, both lips pulled into an understanding smile. And then Harry’s grin widened into something slightly more facetious.
“Fuck, Malfoy, when did you become such a selfless git?” He’s smiling, and Draco chuckles. It’s a beautiful truce, winding and weaving Draco whole.
A microscopic female deer. He’d worked so hard for this moment. He’d reluctantly spent hours upon hours with his former nemesis- and savior of the Wizarding world- studying and practicing a charm he should’ve mastered years ago.
“I can second that,” Zabini stepped forward, arms crossed as he stood comfortably next to Ron. “It’s been a rough year, Draco. Wouldn’t you agree?”
“Of course you are, Moony.” He stepped forward, placing one hand on his shoulder and using the other to tilt his chin upward so that their eyes met. “You won’t ever have to be alone anymore.”
After the war, Draco had considered himself a work-in-progress. He’d ventured through the stages of grief, mourning his losses and wishing he could change the past. He’d also picked himself up off of the floor, vowing to start new. None of this was easy. Panic followed him around every corner, but around every corner was the reassuring laugh of Teddy; smile of Harry. If he’s honest with himself, he’ll admit their great assistance in his own healing.
Remus turned to face him, and their eyes met. Still smiling, Sirius settled into something more resolute.
It was that cough after the words came out, the soft wheeze that Draco assumed was from nervousness that would come to mean everything.
For the first time, Harry witnessed the carefully placed stoicism of Lucius Malfoy flicker before it faltered.
Sirius folded his arms. “No! I don’t know. I just can’t stand to see the people I love most get hurt!”
They separated briefly, gasping for breath as they hovered mere inches from each other. Remus’s hands were still clung to Sirius’s robes, and he made no move to let go. Their eyes were locked, and this moment was everything.
He didn’t have to see his face to read his expression. He knew that smirk anywhere, could feel it dripping from the haughty tone of his voice. He balled his fists involuntarily as the knot in his stomach tightened. After everything he’d seen, every memory he’d walked through, the sound of that voice made him want to do nothing short of vomit.
He could kill his father. He was strong enough. He was angry enough. He had every intention of putting him in the place he’d been held at himself for too many years.
The word sounded tired, as if he was inconvenienced by his presence but unwilling to fight it. And in that moment, Draco Malfoy sensed something he’d never felt before resonating through the air between them:  a truce. He decided to test this boundary, stepping forward and cautiously closing the distance between them.
“After the last full moon, we finally finished it. At James’s house. We did it.” His smile was eccentric and wild and beamed proudly.
Harry never realized that Draco Malfoy was perhaps the greatest actor he’d ever met. Self-preserving, self-respecting. Bold. All qualities he’d come to admire.
The moment was endless, accompanied by a satisfied smirk from Pansy and a knowing twinkle in Dumbledore’s eye.
Behind him, Draco smiled with newfound confidence. A plan unfolding, he wrapped his knuckles around the biceps of the man before him and pulled, leading him out of his subconscious and into the light.
Harry had convinced Draco almost impossibly to join him at a muggle park. It was just the two of them, and the vacancy brought a sort of peace between them.
“Obliviate!” He called, and then rapidly turned to Severus and Bellatrix. “Obliviate! Obliviate!” And finally to Malfoy. “OBLIVIATE!”
The voice belonged to James Potter, who was perched casually on his four poster. The boy unpacking his trunk in the corner jumped, clearly not expecting to be addressed.
Detention with Filch was looking like heaven at this point; polishing the trophy room by hand was much more appealing.
Potter’s already there, rummaging through stacks of decade old-belongings that only the Room of Hidden Things would hold. He’s clearly searching for something.
He tore open the finest of parchments, fingered the contents of the letter. In the an exquisite and formal cursive were the insincere words of his father.
Draco gulped, fully aware of what would happen if he was caught disobeying. He wondered if his friends were punished in the same fashion or if this was one of the few things that separated them. After a long moment of contemplation, his desire to be free outweighed his fear of his father.
“I know it’s you, Sirius. I can see it in your eyes!” He exclaimed, pointing a shaky finger toward his snout. Turning to the rest of his gang, he continued:  “That dog is no canine! He’s my brother! He’s a freak just like you, Lupin!” He craned his head back to the larger wolf, who suddenly sprung forward.
But then, another whisper. A distant proclamation that rings through the periphery of his hearing. “Draco... always... good enough...”
“Just be safe, Blaise. You never know what you might... catch.” Draco drawled sarcastically while Pansy buckled over.
There it is! If you’re still here reading, I hope you enjoyed this. Thank you for sticking with it. ❤️❤️❤️
Was he even... alive? The word, even in his thoughts, seemed choked. No, Draco couldn’t go. Not like this. Not when he’d just broken free... not when he’d been given, like the Marauders, his own... second chance...
His head hit the floor, eyelids sunken and heavy. He tried to hold on, but it was difficult, perhaps the hardest thing he’d done thus far...
He quickly tried to piece together what had happened, to formulate the memory they’d been jerked out of.
Draco watched from afar, shaking his head with a smile. They may have been daring, but they were his friends, and it was obvious that he’d trust them with his life.
Draco huffed from behind, and Harry could almost feel the eye roll. “I knew you weren’t going to tell me, you prat.”
“You are the person that he’s head over heels for. Apparently.” He paused to... did he just roll his eyes? “And thus you have become a beacon for him, a representation of all things good. And here we are, together, two opposite but opposing equals.”
Pansy continued to story.  “Blaise’s disillusionment charms are amazing, really. We were able to sneak into the Gryffindor common room as everyone was shuffling out. The spell even tricked your bloody stairs into letting me enter the dorm.” She winked. “We just sort of figured that after spending so much time together that if Harry was there... Draco would be, too.” She cast a glance between Ron and Hermione, who seemed to be absorbing all of the information.
He paused, silver eyes burning like fire. Harry silently wondered if those cheeks were hot to the touch, if that pale skin would flicker against his own.
“I mean, he’s not wrong,” muttered Malfoy, and Harry shook his head with a smile as they continued to watch.
“I don’t think this one’s mine, you prat.” His words were venomous, but the grip of their fingers intertwined only tightened.
Draco didn’t seem nearly as jumbled in his thoughts as Harry was. In fact, he seemed quite content beside him. That was almost comforting. Harry felt his own physique relax considerably before the world began to shift again.
Not until the door is thrown open, and Harry’s there, sporting nothing but a pair of boxer shorts and a concerned purse of his lips.
“I most certainly have NOT- thought about it-“ He winced as he fought to continue his argument, but his face was bright red and Harry had a nagging suspicion that it wasn’t from his swollen jaw.
“What’s right is for you to stay out of it.” He spat. “I told you, I don’t need help. Especially from a mudblood like you.”
“I’m- I’m not dying,” he declares, more to himself than anyone else, and Harry’s still beaming as he presses a continuation of their earlier kiss to his lips. It’s war, but in this brief moment, they’re fucking happy, and that’s all that matters.
“Geez, Draco, are you performing a seance in here or what?” With a flick of her wand, the room illuminated.
“And what exactly is that, Theo? What are you planning to do?” Draco pressed for information, wand held steady.
“We know what you are, Lupin. I always knew you were pathetic, and now it seems that we have proof.”
“Is Moony still in the library?” James asked nonchalantly, twisting and tossing the snitch between hands.
“I think they’ve pretty much got it wrapped, Hermione.” Ron concluded, peering about at the bodies scattered on the floor.
Fifth year Harry Potter was anywhere but invested in the subject before him. Perhaps it was because Umbridge had gotten beneath his skin that day. Or maybe it was because he was Snape’s least favorite student.
He turned back to the gang. “You guys really should go. I appreciate all that you’ve done, I really do. But I don’t want to hurt any of you. I care about you too much.” His eyes were desperate, pleading.
A stomp interrupted the scene, a loud noise opposed to the soft cries of each memory. It was Draco’s foot, brought forward in a fury, and from his level Harry could see that heavy tears had hit the floor in front of him.
“My son, standing defensively next to Harry Potter. I never thought I’d see the day. But, then again, I was wrong.”
The serpent’s attention is diverted to the trio as they halt and sharply turn backward. Weasley’s grumbling is barely audible above the high-pitched whine of the fire, and Draco begins to cough as smoke chokes the air.
He turned suddenly to one of the farther shelves on his right and took off in its direction. Malfoy was momentarily incapacitated by what appeared to be his own confusion before he followed.
“What has happened is a tragedy. An atrocity. Potter and his colleagues have embarrassed this entire family. Do you agree?”
The air around them waved like oceans, the current flipping and flopping as one memory morphed into another. Draco instinctively grabbed Harry’s arm, unfamiliar with the alarming change in scenery.
Her words were like a lullaby, a song that would come to be his favorite. A tune he would treasure forever.
“Malfoy! It’s so good to see you. I notice you’ve been hanging around those three pretty often. Anything you wanna tell me?” He gestured toward Harry with a wiggle of his brows and an obnoxious thumbs up that had Dean dragging him away. “Okay, Okay, you’re cut off.”
Before long, the rest of the Gryffindors erupted into applause. Harry heard Draco gulp beside him as Sirius joined his father at the table.
With a hoop and holler from across the group, the soirée continued. It wasn’t long before Draco’s and Harry’s drunken confession inspired the start of several other relationships. By the end of the evening, Blaise and Ron had snuck to the dorm and Pansy and Hermione had locked lips in a deserted corner.
He slipped into the compartment in question, hid himself on the luggage rack. He’d been convinced that Draco Malfoy was working for Voldemort, and Ron and Hermione had called him crazy.
“Well, we got the heck out of there,” she started counting off of her fingers, “Potter was (according to you) miserable with his date, and Blaise-y is probably getting his freak on as we speak.”
In the background, Professor Snape and Blaise Zabini were casting similar binding spells on the rest of the men.
“All of you! Get the fuck out of here! Do you hear me? I’m done being afraid. You don’t scare me anymore!”
“You’re not real,” he says, and the words are a bit shaky as they permeate the air. His father’s face twists into something unreadable, a cross between a scowl and utter shock.
“There’s been a break through the warding of Hogwarts. It’s been penetrated, or somehow bypassed. There are...intruders, within the walls of the castle.”
And all at once he knew. He didn’t have to touch him. He recognized the proper, clean smell of a Malfoy, and his heart was pounding in his chest. He felt something inside him lurch, like he never wanted this moment to end. Why was he so close? And why did he want him closer?
This was how their arguments would unfold:  Harry’s genuine obliviousness to any underlying issue would result in his own defiance to anything Draco had to say.
His mother vacated the room wordlessly; his father sat down on an adjacent sofa. Draco nervously anticipated what speech he’d be given, wondered if he’d done something wrong.
Hermione motioned for them to come as the others began making way to the door. Harry yawned before holding up a finger, signaling that he’d be there in a moment. Truth be told, he was exhausted.
The patronus feeling ignites a fire that courses through his veins. He knows he could perform the charm. He knows he will never fail at it again.
A thousand questions buzzed against Harry’s skull, begging for release but trapped against the overwhelming silence. Draco pointed right; Harry left, but neither moved.
Harry wasn’t sure what had caused him to become so defensive, but his voice dripped involuntarily with poison. Perhaps it was because Malfoy was being so nice, so incomprehensibly caring and kind. Maybe it was because on top of that, Harry had just spent the last five minutes pondering what it would be like to snog him.
It was one of those infinite moments that Harry knew would remain alive forever, if only in a memory.
It wasn’t the hurtful words of his father, ringing like a screeching alarm clock on repeat throughout his brain. Telling him he was a failure, a nuisance, an embarrassment.
Harry absorbed this information, processing its intricacies as he studied the morphed form of Lucius Malfoy.
Flabbergasted and confused, Black-eyed Lucius broke his concentration and thus the wind died around them.
Remus, for the moment, appeared all but healed. His eyes had opened a bit wider; the purple rings beneath them faded into a light pink.
Pansy patted him on the back before leaving the classroom. “We’ll figure it out, another way. I promise.”
“Come here. It’ll all be fine.” She pulled him in for a brief hug, a soft smile on her lips. “Now, run along. The guests will be here soon.”
They settled in the familiarity of the Gryffindor common room. It didn’t look much different than the one Harry had left that morning, except the faces were hardly recognizable.
“Thanks, Evans. You’re not so bad yourself.” She grinned at his remark, and Remus extended a hand toward the center of the group.
His stomach lurches; he thinks he’s going to vomit. He drops his wand and without a word runs back to the castle.
She giggled. “Relax, Relax. It’s nothing too bad. Just that the whole school knows you did something to piss off the Chosen One big time. He doesn’t punch just anyone, you know.” She winked, and Draco shuddered in the bed.
“Oh, sure, because associating with a bunch of blood-supremacist racist twats is doing the right thing.”
“Better, actually. It’s amazing what a few healing spells and a bottle of Skele-gro can do for a fracture.” His words were ominous, but there was something about the way the silver of his eyes glinted. He was humored by something.
Across the room, Draco couldn’t help but eye Harry. Just to make sure he didn’t hear his house mates being ridiculous and immature.
“Actually, it was about your friend, Black.” Lucius stepped forward, a sly smile tugging his lips awry.
He had no vials, no memories from his own psyche, nothing to pour into the pensieve that he thought would lead him to the blonde.
Harry approached the pensieve, followed by a slightly apprehensive Draco. From opposite sides of the basin, they leaned over the silvery smoke slowly. In a sudden moment, green eyes met silver, and Harry swore he’d never seen those eyes appear so honest. Before he had a moment to process this, they tumbled head first into a swirling oblivion.
With curfew minutes away, the landscape was vacant of students. All were in their common rooms, safely bunkered in for the night. All except two.
He knew that Potter wasn’t lying about the Dark Lord’s return, but he kept his mouth shut while the press beraded him. Even his own house mates turned their back on him; it was disgusting. Second rate friendships at best. Draco would’ve never... he couldn’t finish the thought.
“Crabbe. Truth or dare?” Blaise turned to Pansy’s left as he resumed his spot next to Greengrass, who somewhat reluctantly placed her head right where it had been.
Suddenly feeling a strong absence without his touch, Harry instinctively reached for his hand and took hold. Slightly startled, Draco looked down before peering sideways with that crooked smile in place.
He couldn’t stand, he could hardly move as the fire traveled into his toes and up his hamstrings. he knew things were getting close to the end, or something like it, when a shadow above him signaled the very presence of his captor.
And there he lay, at a complete standstill. His vision was blurry, the colors of the world around them a giant mixing pot. Noises ran incomprehensible as the pain continued to accelerate. He was sure he was dying- he had to be dying.
Sirius’s mouth was fierce and passionate against his own. Remus thought he might die, right then and there; the only thing convincing him otherwise was the rapid racing of his pulse in each ear.
“Sirius!” He called, but he’d already approached his brother and was now standing eye to eye with what was supposed to be his family.
Harry was both relieved and disappointed at the news. He was grateful to have the freedom to do all kinds of things- with Draco specifically- but there was a nagging feeling, sinking in his gut...
There was a hint of anxiety in Draco’s voice as he followed the Gryffindor. Turns out he wasn’t as confident as he made himself sound, Harry thought with an internal smirk.
Falling in love. Knowing that the boy before him was good and wholesome. Having faith in someone like he’d never had before. Wanting to keep him forever.
It was an endless stretch of time that Draco remained motionless, and the scoff of Lucius Malfoy from behind him was enough to boil his blood.
It reached his trunk, and arms, and legs, and finally his head. He took Draco’s hand and rose from the ground cautiously. What the fuck was happening?
As he passed where Harry stood, completely oblivious to his presence, the tightness in his stomach twisted. He fought the urge to cry, or scream at himself. He wasn’t sure which.
Darkness was illuminated by a hodge podge of blurry shapes and lines as Harry’s eyelids slowly separated. There were noises, but they were as difficult to identify as the array of blended colors before him. Muffled chaos filled his ears; it was clear that something violent was occurring around him. Even if he couldn’t quite make out what it was.
Dumbledore contemplated for a silent moment, glancing between the two as he fingered his floor length beard.
“Are you hurt? We came as fast as we could.” Her brow was creased, not a hundred percent satisfied of his wellbeing.
What he witnessed had to be some sort of miracle. Where Draco’s limp body had lay was nothing but an empty space, vacant and wandering before him. He strained to lift his head, desperate to find what the bastard behind him had done with Draco’s body.
It looked like they wouldn’t be indulging in sweets for the next few moments, at least. Ahead of them, at the end of the alleyway, was a familiar gang of Slytherins.
“Oh, Evans, won’t you love me? With your beautiful red hair and your sassy know it all attitude?” He dramatically leaned his head on Remus’s shoulder and batted his eyelashes in an oh-so feminine manner.
It was dark, but the tears that ran down his cheeks were unmistakeable. Draco Malfoy was not only afraid for his life; he was hurting. And there was nothing Harry could do at this moment to stop that.
“We’ve got to stop them!” His remark was reactionary, the same heroic tendency that Harry had been known to have. The one thatDraco couldn’t help but admire, stupid and rash and reckless as it was.
The day they were married, Harry proposed a toast to his new husband. For his “undeniable courage against everything that threatened to destroy him during the war,” along with his “heart that is bigger than he will ever let on,” and his “dedication to what he believes is right, for all of the right reasons.” Ron, Hermione, Pansy, and Blaise were among the loudest of the applause. Draco was crying (from the onions in the hor d'oeuvres, of course).
Harry watched as Draco retreated to his dormitory, followed as he found sanctuary in his very own four poster.
“Speaking of the losers!” Bellatrix cackled, turning the group’s attention to the approaching Gryffindors.
What he never expected was a the frigid feeling of ice  crackling from his head to his toes, freezing him whole until his eyes opened to reveal a world just as white.
Harry didn’t care about anything else; not his aching legs or violently contracting lungs or the fact that he was utterly wandless should something happen...
And if he was in Draco’s memory... what had become of him? Was he that much closer to finding him? Or was this all some kind of twisted, whimsical game of the pensieve?
The group came to a halt as they rounded a corner, attempting to graze between buildings as a short cut to the candy store.
When they entered the banquet hall, Draco paused to admire the sheer elegance of the decorations and setup.
And then, like a train that was violently thrown from its tracks... Harry remembered. He remembered how this story would end. How the forgiveness unfairly bestowed upon Peter Pettigrew by his parents would result in their ultimate betrayal. How the innocence and freedom of Sirius Black was soon to be robbed from him in exchange for 12 years of suffering in Azkaban. How Remus Lupin never got to change his last name and instead spent more than the next decade believing that the love of his life had been the one to steal every last shred of happiness that he’d been given.
Harry’s heart raced. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d run so hard; even the Triwizard Tournament didn’t hold a candle to the determination that resonated throughout him now.
He paused, unsure of how to respond. She was his best friend, after all, but he couldn’t bring her into this. Whatever his father had to tell him was going to be on a whole new level of deep, or gruesome, or something, and he didn’t want her involved. For his own sake or for hers.
“First of all, YOU punched me. Are you completely mental? And secondly... are we going... down there?”
“Weasley,” Blaise turned to the redhead. “I’ve seen you play chess, and it is bloody brilliant, if I do say so myself. Care to match me at some point?”
Potter’s mouth drops into the finest of “O’s,” and Draco can’t help but stare at the plump crimson of his lower lip.
The astronomy tower was far less elusive in the daylight, beams of sunshine flooding over the rails and banishing the shadows.
Both were standing stupidly behind the couple, trying to lean in and eavesdrop a quite possibly private conversation.
“God damnit, Draco, why can’t you hear me? You need to hear me! Come back here you prat!” But Draco Malfoy, in the ghost of a memory, fled the room.
The rest of the group lurched for their turn. There was an understanding that Sirius got to go first, that Remus’s transformations affected him more than the other two. No one seemed to question why that was.
Draco had stomped out, thoroughly ruffled. How dare Potter offer help to him? As if testifying on his behalf wasn’t enough. Draco didn’t need any more favors. He didn’t need any of it.
He was riding Buckbeak, flying across the castle grounds in the most liberating of feats. It was a happy memory, one that could easily create a patronus. Harry was high, both in spirit and in elevation. He’d never felt this way before. Would he ever feel it again?
Draco and Harry hadn’t realized that in their proximity to Black and Lupin, they’d become closer than they’d ever been before.
Voldemort had spoken the words himself, in the foyer of Malfoy manor. He was repulsed by the snake-like manner of his body; the red of his eyes was horrifying. Draco wanted no part of this.
For a split second, an emotion Draco had never witnessed form the man before him overtook his features:  fear.
With an elbow to the ribs, Harry found himself being pulled toward the shrieking shack by the Slytherin.
“Please, Black. If you think that this-“ the blonde male threw a disgusted glance down the table- “is where you belong, you’re more pathetic than I thought.”
The memories were changing everything, it seemed. He followed him up the stairs, crossed the threshold to his room while in tow.
“Draco! Draco, can you hear me?” He asked, patting his robes and searching for any sign of injury. His eyelids remained shut, face in an almost tranquil expression of slumber. Harry paused, glancing for any changes or proof that he sensed his presence.
“Pshh, you’d be lucky if SHE gave YOU so much as a handjob,” Blaise jabbed, trying to direct the subject away from Draco. It was obvious that something was wrong.
Sirius Black, falling through the other side. Losing him forever. Feeling like he had no one left in the world.
“Is this the part where I get to drink?” He asked facetiously, a smile pulling at the edges of his lips. There were giggles from the girls and chuckles from the rest as they tipped back each glass.
Several things seemed to happen simultaneously. At once, James and Sirius had their wands drawn and pointed directly at Snape.
His stare held daggers in their direction, and it was only a moment before they became aware of his position.
The interesting bit about the Slytherins playing this game was that no one seemed to object to what was coming for them. Harry had played it once or twice, or maybe a few times in his own drunken stupor in the common room. But there were always pleas, arguments, etc. when the shit hit the fan. Not here, amongst the snakes. Unlike the lions, they were prepared for the venom that was their price to pay.
The wolf towered above them; its only match was Sirius’s large and gangly black paws. The difference between them was blatant enough. Sirius was a playful puppy; the wolf was a viscous dog.
Pansy and Blaise were grounded, sure, resulting in a lonely Draco Malfoy not receiving owls from any of his friends.
He ran his hands along several orbs with Malfoy now in tow.  Images of Draco- laughing with his friends, learning in the classroom, strolling about Diagon Alley- they were all much too young. He picked up his pace, weaving through shelves and dodging Malfoy’s chase as he neared what had to be getting close to the end.
When the eighth year common room lit up that Friday night with the anticipatory mood of another soiree, Harry wasn’t surprised to see the silver trio enter suavely. Seamus was already drunk, and with Dean in tow he marched right up to Malfoy and gave him quite the uncomfortable hug.
His words make me laugh. For the first time in ages. I don't really remember the last time I smiled or even wanted to.
I would love those nights. Your worried eyes and fake light-hearted jokes. A little bit too tight a grip of your arm around my chest. I would cherish them and hold them close to my heart. Soon, I would try to make them happen more often. Soon, I would cease feeling guilty about it.
He is distant, the silences are awkward, I don't mention Astoria. It feels as though we've been thrown back to the beginning of the year. That's when I fully realise how far we've come, how different we are now to the us that were before, how much this friendship means to me. In fact, only now, when all the easiness is gone, do I acknowledge it for what it was, do I realise I've been happy.
With their wands drawn, Death Eaters close the circle around Harry and Aunt Bella. She slashes her wand and a streak of red drips down Harry's forehead. "Tell me, ugly, where did you get the sword?"
The noseless fucker gapes like a fish, having seemingly forgotten why they are even here. Now, isn't it the perfect moment to strike him once and for all? But Harry goes on and on, and the Dark Lord
I don't know why, but talking to him about it is much easier than I thought. Much, much easier than thinking about it when I'm alone.
I have some ideas as to the library and the living room, but they are just minor changes. The kitchen in the basement is okay, and is actually the most inhabited place in the house, except for Potter's bedroom, I suppose, though I haven't seen it.
You wouldn't show up for a couple of weeks, until one night you just walked into my bedroom, undressed without words, crawled under the blanket and kissed me or bit me - I let you.
Severus grabs the tip of the wand pressing into his throat, wrenches it out of Bella's grip, and throws it on the floor. The wand clatters, rolling over the marble, and with a shriek, Bella dives after it.
I can't kiss him now, I can do nothing. This is not the time and place. His friends are watching. The madman awaits him.
"Verbal and physical contact (within limits of modesty) between patients of the opposite sex is encouraged."
Irritable and restless, unable to sleep that night, I went out in a foul mood. On and on, I walked the streets, until my feet brought me to the familiar club. I ordered a drink, and another, and the third one shortly after. It didn't help. Aimlessly, my eyes scanned the crowd until with a start I spotted you. The sight made me choke with anger.
More than once I covere McGonagall's back, help Flitwick and deflect curses flying at Ginny Weasley. At first, it wasn't that hard, because those Death Eaters who knew me thought I was on their side. Now, it's getting tough. I barely stand on my feet, my whole body aches, and I'm not that much of a fighter. Everyone is exhausted, we've lost people, and
"Done," he says, there's a sound of him putting the lid over the cauldron. "Let it simmer for twenty minutes."
"What's this?" I ask, though I think I already know. There were rumours, and once I witnessed it myself in the third year, though I didn't know what I was seeing.
Granger is straddling Weasley on the sofa, her T-shirt up under her armpits. His fly undone, Weasley's hands fondle her small tits in a black bra. The two of them gape at Potter and me in turns.
I descend the stairs and mingle with the crowd, the game of 'Spin the Bottle' still going on. I contemplate the thought of joining it again, but end up on the sofa between Neville and Ron. I want to have fun, but somehow it's not fun anymore. I refuse Firewhisky and sit, thinking of Malfoy. Of his kiss and why he left. He didn't mention
I only notice that winter is almost over when rose petals pour down on our heads as Malfoy and I head to classes on St. Valentine's Day.
Shaking his head, he steps back again. "I have to go, I have to..." He lifts the crown in his hand. "This is another Horc-"
Still in his shirt, he is fiddling with the cuff of his sleeve. There's tension to his quiet posture and all the uncertainty in the world.
"Six out there," he says, "the seventh one is the remaining part that's still inside him. The two are already destroyed, four to go. Including the locket."
"By hand." His footsteps approach. "It wasn't warded." He stops. Next moment, the blanket is wrenched off me altogether, cool air making me squint as though from the light. "Get up."
"It's not stupid... and...  look... it's kind of crazy, yeah? All this..." I wave my hand. "Absolutely wild. Can we just... sit for a second and talk?"
"Prophet is been arrive, as always. Kreacher is must taking it away. Kreacher is been sorry Master Draco read it."
I don't know how I am supposed to sound. Surprised but not too eager? Mildly interested but not too indifferent? My heart is thudding. There's no way anyone knows. Surely I've never...
There's noise and voices and clatter of trunks. Students are leaving for Christmas. I feel naked again, exposed, knowing my every step is scrutinised more than ever. But Draco's beside me, and most certainly he feels the same; and all those people saw us kissing last night anyway.
Squeezing your eyes shut against his image, you stumbled out of the bedroom. You dumped everything over the bannisters, down into the hall by the staircase and refused to cry. Tears choked you, swelling up against your will. You refused to let them fall, striding angrily back, picking up the defeated brogues and Chelsea boots, one of them still lay mocking you across the room. Snatching it up, you dashed back, throwing everything down from the landing.
On tenterhooks, waiting for him to return, I didn't even pretend to be reading, or asleep. I just sat there, waiting.
I'm pretty sure he ignores her. I imagine his arrogant face, the way he glances at her down his nose, turning away to pour himself tea in the most stuck-up manner.
Oh, what a relief that would be to pass this task to someone else. To Snape. He is strong and always knows what to do. Unlike me, he is not a coward. I am weak and tired. So tired. I would stay in bed forever so that I wouldn't have to do anything, and maybe eventually the Dark Lord would forget about me. Snape would probably accomplish it for me. He would. He’d made a Vow, he said.
"I am sorry, Harry… I—" She rummaged in her handbag, retrieving a handkerchief. "I don't know what to say." She shrugged and noisily blew her nose and made a face, tucking the white piece of cloth back into the bag.
"No, Hermione, just think!" Agitated, he springs on his feet. "It fits! He left me the Stone, and he left you the book! With a legend of the Deathly Hallows
Slowly, he headed down the corridor and I followed, holding him by the sleeve. Only then did the noise around us resume. When I heard Ron talking in a low voice behind us, I realised he'd been standing there all along.
Zabini is so pissed off, that I see he barely restrains from punching me. I would gladly punch myself.
“Just now. I… stood here for a while, watching you…” He locks his arms around my shoulders, his forehead leans against mine. “When it appeared - it wasn’t your Stag, it was a Dragon… and then I knew.”
"Hermione's right." Potter rubs his eyes under the glasses. "I need him where I can keep an eye on him."
break up, did you? You only said so to keep her safe. You both knew that. She's still waiting for you, I'm sure."
He kisses me, again and again, throwing the blanket off. I grip at his shoulders, rolling him around, and push him down on his back. Our erections press into each other, making us gasp.
When I didn't react, because he couldn't be possibly speaking to me, he wiggled his fingers impatiently. "C’mon, Potter, we're wasting time."
How would Malfoy look at me through the eyes of a stranger? Would he consider me handsome? Okay... what the fuck? What a ridiculous notion.
"Don't mind them". He makes a face and tucks his arm under his head. "I killed fucking Voldemort, can I have a moment of peace with my...
The novelty of me being a thing at Hogwarts is wearing off. But all the same, people stare; they whisper and throw glances at me. How long will it take for them to stop?
the fragrance will be faint, barely there. He will turn in my arms and reach down, finally finding my aching cock… he will hold my hips and kneel before me, taking me in his mouth, into the firm, perfect 'O' of his lips…
"Yes, so that neither of you would be able to expose the other." Dumbledore stands up and walks to the window. "And there's another thing you should know, Harry." With his back to me, he looks into the darkness outside.
I can't leave, I know. Not until I sort out this thing between us. In spite of everything, in spite of shame and embarrassment, I realise I’m not ready to lose him for good.
I am about to start walking, when a sound from above makes me look up. The sun is right in my eyes, making it barely possible to see a figure in the air, approaching on the broom.
I take a step forward, and another one. With my hand outstretched in front of me, I begin walking towards the exit. No one gets in the way, and in no time my hand bumps into the hard wooden frame of the Great Hall double door. Sliding my palm over the wood, I step into the Entrance Hall and turn to the right, heading in the direction of the back door leading to the courtyard. The breeze caresses my face, the warm touch of the sun gentle on my skin. I sit down on the stone steps and turn my face upwards, inhaling deeply. I realise I’ve closed my eyes. Not that it makes any difference. I open them. No. I close them again, this way it's better. It's nice and soothing, and makes me imagine - makes me pretend - that I'm just chilling out in the sun, on the steps before Herbology class, waiting for my friends to finish their lunch and pick me up.
"Draco, listen...considering everything you have told me... The Dark Lord voiced his intention to send you to Hogwarts after the Easter break. I was trying to find a way to persuade him to leave you here by my side. But now... you absolutely must go. You cannot stay here. The Dark Lord
It fills my palm, hot to the touch and thick. The skin is so smooth, so tender, that I'm suddenly afraid to hurt him.
"Dumbledore..." His voice is barely a whisper, and he must be grateful that Bellatrix doesn't see his face.
I wept for my Mother and the thought that I'll never see her again. For her safety and mine - Potter said.
"Okay," I say as firmly as I can, putting my hope in any leftovers of my authority over these two that might still be there, "we must split and search the room. Goyle, you go to the left; you this way, Crabbe." I point ahead. "And I'm going down there." I point at the last aisle to the right.
Tracing his wrist, I slide my fingers up, bracing myself to feel what is to come, what I think I will feel, what is
I know what is trying to stand between us again, the thing that always did. This time I am determined not to let it.
"Dumbledore's dead. Snape killed him," he says curtly, folding the Cloak many times until it is no larger than a handkerchief; he stuffs it in his pocket.
"Maybe, but I've got an idea of how to make things work for you. Would you like to know, or would you rather keep whining?"
happens, Harry, do you understand? You must promise me to protect him in the end. You will Ennervate him, get him out of here and hide him. It is my wish, Harry, and my command."
"And do remember, Draco, no matter what, no matter what your Father has done... You will always remain a Black.
In the deadly yellow light of the streetlamp, your eyes were dark. Staring you down, I shook my head.
I knew it did. It loved you. Probably because you were related to the Black family, or maybe because you played the piano, or for any other mysterious reason, your presence brought the house to life. It never particularly cared for me, and once you were gone for good, I wouldn't be able to stay here alone.
It's so damn hot, my glasses are scorching, my vision blurs, I take them off. I need to hide you. I don't want to see your face. Staggering forward, I grab the photos. Fire is licking at my sleeves, I feel nothing.
Covering my face, I press my fingertips to my useless eyes, smearing hot tears over my skin. I can't go on like this, I can't… I can do nothing.
is repeating in my head over and over. Relieved, even from here I see the movement: he curls into a ball on his side.
"You mean..." Weasley's eyes grow round as saucers when realisation finally hits him. "Bloody hell, Harry!" He says, scandalised. "But
"I am afraid not, my Lord. She fainted. She is unable to stand upright due to the fever. I beg your leave to deliver her to her chambers."
I walk and squint at their faces. My glasses are dirty, but I see enough to know that I can't find what I'm looking for. I stop on the spot and turn around, peering into the crowd. Around, around, around. My head swims. I don't see...
Slowly, oh-so-slowly, gingerly I moved and moved and moved, on and on, until his body clenched as he cried out and came. I watched white strips covering his stomach in bouts until his hand stilled and he went boneless. Carefully, I pulled out. He curled on his side and looked at me.
“Do come in, Mr. Malfoy,” McGonagall says into silence. “Please, take a seat, the class has already begun.” There’s a steeliness in her voice that wasn’t there a moment ago.
I no longer understand anything. What is that supposed to mean? Where did he get it? Why is he doing that? Does it mean I was right? Does it mean he'd made the box?
"Malfoy?" Following his nod across the Ministry ballroom, my heartbeat will skip just a little at the flash of blond hair and the elegant set of shoulders clad in the expensive fabric of your impeccably cut tuxedo.
"That's not--" He falters. "Er… sure. We'll try again. With another Patronus, but not before I brew a new batch."
“Potter?” His hands reach to unlock my grip around his chest as he hops off the broom. “Take my hand.”
I am wildly anxious to put it like this, but we've reached the point where nothing but honesty can work.
That was actually what I intended to do a bit later - summon Kreacher after I will have wallowed in self-pity. Alone. But Malfoy’s visit interrupted me, and I’m sort of pissed off, but the mood is broken, and I hardly want him to leave now and let me resume my lonely suffering.
I move before I know it, coming to my senses while already leaping halfway across the Hall. Because he's an idiot, a reckless Gryffindor idiot, and even death hasn't changed him at all. He is wandless.
I've taken up the habit of sitting on the back porch with Malfoy in the evenings. After the epic embarrassment with Ron and Hermione two weeks ago, things had gotten back to normal, but I avoid getting in their way, trying to give them the privacy they need.
I defiantly stuff another slice into my mouth, all the while hoping that Astoria can see me right now, eating half of the token of her affection.
flares my hope to life, making me wait, leaving me hanging, trapping me in that fucking circle again - the ever-fleeting cycle of hope and despair and
That's when I realised that all that time I wanted someone like you, but different. Someone with your face, someone as graceful, beautiful, charming. Someone who would love me the way I craved. Someone so unlike you.
"Well, gentlemen… Let's take a look at your potion.” There’s a sound of the heavy lid opening. “But it is excellent! Very good, Mr. Potter, very good." He puts the lid back and moves away.
"We don't have Muggle money anyway," Weasley said, "don't tell me you want to transfigure galleons."
Footsteps echo against the stone. Hard and vicious, determined. Someone is walking to the dais, gasps of shock bursting here and there.
I don't ask what it is and why it must be destroyed. They won't tell me. The only thing I gathered is that this is the item they ambushed the Ministry for and nearly got captured. After a whole day of futile attempts, they finally quit.
He exhales. Barely. And finally opens his eyes. His gaze is cautious and waiting and patient. And...
Falling-falling-falling— Sudden coolness shocks me back to my senses, I can't breathe. Ice filling my lungs like water, I look up. A roaring fire is swimming above… I let myself drown.…
"Oh, it's a super weird story, mate. Last night, I was playing with my Deluminator, and I heard a voice -
I haven't talked to him since the night when I confronted him and Zabini. I probably should; I don't know how. How to even approach him after everything I shouted in his face? I don't know. I'm still not entirely sure if I'm even right, if Noir wasn't a joke. But I hope.
"Okay, come in, then." I throw the door open. "I'm going to get dressed." I turn around, heading to pick my clothes from the armchair.
"That I had fucked off and give posh tea-parties at the Manor." I step outside. "But no, here I am, still stealing chickens." I head to the remnants of the half-burnt logs from last night and point my wand at them to start a fire. I hope Harry will say something, but he is silent, and I will
Nothing happened. He did nothing, said nothing, just stood there. There was a heavy sigh, and another, and a long silence, until I realised he didn't come to kill me. It seemed he wanted to talk. Whatever in hell could Potter and I possibly talk about? I didn’t understand until it finally dawned on me that he came to apologise. To right the wrongs and all that shit.
I look down to where my hand disappears beneath the sleeping bag, at its movement under the fabric. I want to
It's cold, and I shift on the windowsill and wince, disturbing my bandages. My wounds have gotten better, but any wrong movement still hurts. I should probably fetch the quilt. I can't summon it from here, Pomfrey took my wand away.
They are a weird couple. I mean, what girlfriend would urge her man to play Spin the Bottle? And Malfoy - was he okay with just
Carefully, my hand reaches to the bedside table, immediately finding the vial. Kreacher always places it just right, so that I won't knock it over. Pulling the stopper out with a soft pop, I bring the vial to my mouth and drink. I only have a few spare seconds to put it back on the bedside table, drop my head on the pillow and pull the blanket up to my ears before the Dreamless Sleep grips me.
I would launch forward and crush your lips until we both tasted blood. I would crowd you until your back hit the wall. I would clutch at you until you gasped for air, I would rip your clothes off and…
I may have still doubted it when you grinned at me at the Ministry function, the tip of your cigarette glowing as you took a drag.
"Yeah," I agree. "Last night..." I clear my throat. "I wasn't there on purpose, no matter what they think. I spent the evening on the balcony, and when I went back, they were there. I had no idea."
"Letting the Devil tempt their souls last night, Paul and Christopher committed a sin, indulging in physical intimacy with each other. Had they not been stopped by the staff members, the consequences would have been even more menacing. They deserve a punishment and should atone. Do their parents agree?"
too. It's a map, will help you find him." There's a rustle of parchment. "Do whatever the fuck you want, Harry. Maybe next time you're lost, Malfoy will look out for you."
I swallow and unfasten my belt. By the sound of it, he's doing the same. I push my jeans down, getting stuck in them around my ankles.
Mother's flat is pretty and airy. Light colours and elegance. So very unlike his house. So very like I wanted his house to be one day.
When Malfoy leaves to get ready for classes, I begin to dress, all the while thinking that what I promised him is easier said than done.
between us, everything that makes us who we are; all our choices that cannot be fixed; everything that we've never talked about.
, and I have received it. He reached out, as though offering me his hand - a gesture of friendship, an invitation to honesty - and I am taking it, confirming this secret bond between us. I am no longer alone.
My thoughts slow, thick like jelly, I stare at the spot where he stood mere moments ago. No, no. It's a mistake, someone's stupid mistake. It cannot be happening, not to Dumbledore, never to him.
The you that wouldn't rile me up, drive me mad, make me jealous, play with me in our endless game tug-of-war. The nice, the kind, the safe you. Someone who wouldn't wield my love as a weapon over my head as soon as he glimpsed its glint in the shadows. Someone with your face.
It feels good, so good that just a little bit more, and I may come in no time. I close my eyes, concentrating on that feeling…
You look at me, eyes obscured with the shining strands falling across your face. Without my glasses I can't really discern where your hair ends and the sun begins.
"Yes... So I did and told him that Mr. Potter was dead. While in fact, he wasn't. I looked closely and touched the pulse on his neck, and... his eyes fluttered open. I should have been shocked, you know, but I wasn't, because all I could think of was you. I asked him whether you were alive, and he nodded... and I stood up before the Dark Lord and the Death Eaters and told them he was dead."
With his hands tied behind his back, he stares down at his feet. A few strands of black hair have escaped the hairband; they fall on his face, on his red puffy cheeks, obscuring his swollen eyelids and the piggy eyes, and the faint line on his forehead, that I know is still
above his right eyebrow. He looks very pale in the face and gaunt, skin stretched tight over the sharp features. And I realise, that although he is the strong one - last night might have taken its toll on him, too.
I crawl back over him until our faces meet. His outline is blurred in the yellow glow of the lamp. I am dying to know the look on his face, the way he looks at me now.
You and Theo had known each other since forever. You’d never been best friends, but got along just fine. It was only after Hogwarts that you realised you liked him.
Last night flares vividly in my memory: Malfoy's hot breath on my skin, our fervent kisses, me clinging to him like a drowning man, groping for the last hope. Our frantic release in the dark, though we barely knew what we were doing... My face grows hot.
"Where?" Malfoy asks. He picks at the grass between the tiles and throws it in front of him on the steps.
At first, I thought it was a cruel joke… but Hermione has never been cruel. Then I thought that my memory was playing odd tricks with me, or was it my eyes?
I don't know what to do now. Dumbledore has left me so many things to accomplish and figure out. But now I see no point. Without him, there is no way I will succeed. Without his command and guidance, without his wisdom and support. He always told me what to do, he was always
Guilt is screaming at me, I want to spill it, to unload it off my chest, to make you carry away my burden… to make you hate me so that I can forgive myself.
enters with Parkinson on his arm. In a black tuxedo and a bow-tie that look utterly Muggle, he holds himself stiffly, staring ahead. Heads are turning. It looks as though Parkinson is the one walking, and he's being dragged along, putting his feet one in front of the other. I feel for him. I know better than anyone what it feels like: to be under the fire of hundreds eyes.
"After what happened, I find it impossible to be near him. I am so sorry, Draco. I failed you. Again."
"Shhh..." He rocks me, and for a moment there is nothing but him shielding me from the world, his warmth, the pressure of his grip and the weight as he rests his head against mine. "I'm not going anywhere."
I don’t want to listen to this. No matter what she may say now, it won’t change what had already happened. I kneel in front of the fireplace. "Does he know that you had something to do with my escape?"
Helpless before his ire, you didn't deny it as you should have. Everything must have been written across your face, for one look at you made him cringe.
Determined to find him first, I dash to the right aisle between the piles of cauldrons and the old broom shed. That's the way to the Vanishing Cabinet, and I can take it with my eyes closed. But no, I don't need to go there just yet. I stop and clutch the coin in my hand, thinking of Harry, and concentrate. It is suddenly obvious that I have to run ahead, and take two turns to the right, past the Vanishing Cabinet, and then duck abruptly to the left, and to the left again, between two piles of old broken chairs that reach almost to the ceiling. Who the hell put them like that and why? I run and run, I have no idea where I am by now, and to find the Vanishing Cabinet again, I will have to return to the door and start from there. My foot catches at something and I trip, landing on my outstretched palms. The coin flies out of my hand and rolls under the battered armchair.
"Now, Jared, I want you to address this chair as if it were your father, and tell him everything that makes you angry. Come on, everything you hate about him, you can say now."² Mr. Vice squeezes Jared's shoulder in reassurance and steps back, leaving the boy in the middle of the room, facing the empty chair.
When I suddenly bump into something hard on my way, I realise I reached my destination. Sliding my palm over the wood, I carefully walk around the bench and sit down. Leaning against the hard wooden back, I inhale a lungful, hold it, let it go. And again. The air is quiet, there's no tide over the still waters of the Lake and never has been, but if you
I feel Malfoy's presence, but can't bring myself to look at him. Seems like he's as pissed as I am; there's no other explanation for
Sometimes during Quidditch I catch his gaze on me. Our eyes meet a second before diving for the Snitch. And there's challenge: desire to prove, outsmart and show off, that is always our driving force. But also something else, genuine and bright, something like joy, something that makes me feel myself to be the reason of it.
I take a sip from the glass again and relish the burn sliding down my throat, spreading warmth to my fingertips... Yeah…
"Do you want to date her? Make a move!" His voice is cruel. "Ask her the fuck out! Or do you want me to have a word with her about you first?"
The area is devoid of human presence - Granger checked thoroughly. We've made our camp in a forest, near a small mountain river.
"Excellent, Mr. Potter," Malfoy hisses into my ear in so perfect a parody that I can't help sniggering again.
Mesmerised, I trace the lid when the chain weaves around my hand. It slithers through my fingers, gleaming faintly in the dim light until it
When I finally put it on, I feel better having it on me again and at the same time, I feel even worse. Rage overcomes me; anger I haven't felt before. Well... I probably have – yesterday - when Ron told me that I have no family.
"The group is having a morning session at the moment," Alex replied, "here we are." He stopped in front of the door with the number 238.
I hug the pillow, pressing my face into it. I squeeze it in my arms, close my eyes and let the tears run. I am starved for his touch, for his face, for his presence, for the mere knowledge that he is
I feel his hand on my arse, stroking, sliding back and forth, as his thigh slips between my legs. I don't really know what to do - I've never done this before - but I am bold with desire, or wine, or both, and it seems there aren't that many options but touch and kiss and
"Well, you behave like you know her very well. Astoria this, Astoria that! What does she look like?" He mimics my voice. "You talk about her all the time!"
You rolled your eyes. "If Hermione didn't want you, she wouldn't be living with you all these years. Come on." You opened the jewellery shop door. "I don't know what kind of help you want from me, I'm not the jewellery type." You wiggled your eyebrows.
"You may as well help me and do the stirring," he says as though nothing has happened and presses a spoon into my other hand.
Those years without his constant presence, without his measuring looks and immaculate posture, had brought something into your life that you'd never had before. Something like freedom. Something that would be taken away as soon as he stepped into the Manor again. Something that didn't have the right to exist when Father was near.
He steps very close, leaning in… and I feel his fingers pulling the collar of my shirt up. He puts the tie around my neck. I swallow. I don’t know what’s the matter with me, but his proximity is doing things. To me. Goosebumps are rising over my forearms under the fabric, I keep myself from inhaling his smell in a lungful. The deft movements of his fingers at the base of my throat make me hold my breath, until he pulls the collar down, adjusting it over the tie, and steps back. I’m not sure what has just happened, but I’m relieved when he withdraws.
"How are you?" He asks, glancing in turns between the Tower Bridge over the river and my sketch of it.
"She does," I finally find my voice, "she owns some property in London that's not connected to my Father in any way. But she won't leave the Manor."
He agrees. I try. We try together. Each time I work on my Patronus, he tries, too. To me, it comes without effort now, though it hadn’t made any difference the last time we tested the potion again. I avoid thinking about it too much. I just live.
"Why would you be such a dick?!" He says. "I've never made this about your blindness. Do you expect me to start now?"
The glow of the fire outside makes golden flickers dance on his skin. Here we are - our shadows - intertwined on the wall, moving,
Potter and Granger share their night vigils in turns. Weasley is ill, often running a fever, his left hand still bandaged. They don't trust
There's understanding and a bit of pity. Everyone knows about Noir. Everyone read his name splattered across the Prophet.
"And the remaining are?" I tighten my grip around his chest. He leans back into me, and I lean against the wall.
I tuck the band between my teeth and card my fingers through his hair. Wavy and thick, it is a bit longer than mine. I like the way the sunlight brings out the gold in it. I smooth it back from his forehead and temples, gathering it up from his nape into a tiny ponytail and tie it with a band.
He summoned his backpack and the sleeping bag from his bunk, stuffing it jerkily inside. His woollen sweater followed and a small leather pouch he often wore around his neck; he grabbed his second pair of jeans from the floor, stuffing everything angrily into the backpack, while the three of us gaped at him in silence. His silver shield charm still glimmered around me.
It bursts in a blinding silver, soaring high, filling me with joy, making me howl in despair. Searing-bright, it is more powerful than anything I cast before, but somehow it feels lacking, taking a part of me away. It is alien, but very familiar, too, unlike any Patronus I've ever cast. Swooping in a flash of silver, it dives into the sky.
Malfoy is all irritable today. Though not refusing to play, he avoids looking at me and replies mainly 'yes' or 'no' when I say something. As soon as we meet in the air, every time he turns his broom around, leaving me looking at his retreating back. I cannot stop staring at how his hair is gleaming in the sun, cannot stop noticing how graceful his movements are, how strong and sure his posture looks on the broom. I am afraid of being too obvious, anxious he might notice, anxious twice because now he knows I may look.
"Forgive me, Harry." He steps back and leans against the railings. His breath is laboured. He looks so old and frail
I send the letter and wait, and wait. It's past midnight and I'm in my bed. If he isn't asleep, surely he isn't busy at the moment not to have time to check on the box. Shurely he hasn't forgotten about me. With the whole school gossiping about me these days. I don't think he could.
And isn't that what I wanted? What I've been asking for? His words sting, let me down, wind me up, make me sick, make everything worse.
There's a surge and a brief flash of light that instantly dies down. I can't believe it. It hasn't happened for ages. I haven't failed my Patronus for over half a year.  My heart leaps in a panic. No, no, it can't be.
“Maybe I will, I mean... why not?” I wash the shampoo out of my hair. “Though I don’t dance, I’ll just sit in a corner.”
She's all raised chin and bare shoulders, a tiny waist and silvery scales of her long shimmering gown; all immaculate bob haircut and arrogance, staring from beneath the black fringe.
I put the lamp down on the bedside table and turn away, sitting down on the bed with my back to him.
The wall explodes, and when the debris settle, there is a huge hole in the place where the door should have been. Granger directs her broom and disappears through it, Harry and I follow, and Weasley with a roaring Goyle is behind us.
The lamp is right behind him, so I still can't discern the man's features, but his voice is familiar to the point of being ridiculous. Because
"No, I mean... kissing... I wouldn't be able to give that impression. That she's your girlfriend, I mean."
The next turn to the left will take me right to the Common Room's hidden door. I ignore it, quickly walking past, and turn to the right instead, in the direction of the Potions classroom. There I stop and lean against the wall.
Your eyes snapped open to land on Theo in the doorway. His smile was knowing, and his bathrobe was open in the middle. He pushed himself off the doorframe.
again is weirdly turning me on. It seems like an eternity passes before it slows down... slower and slower... until it finally stops.
I try to raise my head and growl when it falls back and hits the stone floor. Sharp pain makes sparkles bloom before my eyes.
With a flick of my hand, my shirt flies across the room and the glasses follow. I put them on, catching my own eyes in the picture, my smile unabashed,
"NO." Eyes narrowed, Weasley shook his head. "YOU DON'T KNOW HOW IT FEELS! Your parents are dead! You have no family!"
Their faces are grim and dirty, a lot of them are crying, but seeing me, faint smiles break on their faces. Each one of them. They wave and cheer and greet me, as though I'm some bloody hero. I don't know why they think I deserve it. So many people died because of me.
Only when a few days pass, and I'm sick of lying in my bed, doing nothing, going on in my head in circles, only then I begin to remember a bunch of little things. Only then afterthoughts begin nagging: that a lot of letters Zabini couldn't possibly have sent because they appeared when he was right in front of me.
His heartbeat under my palm is fast and steady, measuring the moments with a heavy rhythm. I slide my hands up and over his shoulders, finally stepping back.
"It's his plan... it's his plan," I repeat over and over, "it's his plan." Until my voice drowns in tears that choke me.
A half an hour later, I am sipping scalding tea, sitting at the kitchen table. It's cold here, and I shiver, looking around, and notice a grey woollen sweater I saw on Potter at dinner. It's fucking freezing, and I'm only in the T-shirt and my pyjama bottoms…
you stand where he stood?! Tell them how it happened that night. Tell them how you looked him in the eye, a man who trusted you!" He points his finger at Snape. "And killed him. Tell them!" [11]
"Yes." The disfigured locket lies on the ground and the sword of Gryffindor gleams near it. Weasley pulls the thing up by its chain. "It's gone. It's empty." He wipes his eyes.
At the edge of my vision my Father shifts, but I do have the answer to that. While the Dark Lord was skinning Aunt Bella for the sword of Gryffindor (though I had no idea what he was on about) and letting Potter's people go, I rehearsed my every possible answer many times.
It’s all that matters. He lets me stay with him, and I'm not going back to that wretched house, because he
A sound startled you. In bewilderment, you turned your gaze away from the shattered porcelain and looked around, as though seeing your own kitchen for the first time. The air crackled with your magic, poised to snap in a burst of violence. At first, you didn't even understand it was a doorbell. Who the hell could it be? He wouldn't ring a doorbell. He never did. Before you could think, your feet were bringing you out of the kitchen, past the offensive heap by the staircase and across the hall to the front door. You wrenched it open.
She's in her dress from last night. She told me, when we were outside, that the party in the Gryffindor tower was winding down, when she decided to go find me and stay. Or maybe I imagined this, I'm not sure. But she saw me snogging Malfoy, yeah? That's how we ended up outside in the first place.
At lunch he doesn't pay me any attention, and though I see no reason why he should, I feel like something is missing.
He threw his head back, and his breath hitched - in pain or pleasure, I couldn't be sure. No, in pain.
"No." My face is burning. "No, I..." I look away. I didn't know it would be so hard to meet his eyes.
I finally look at him. His face determined, he reaches out and tries to pull me closer. I resist and step back. We are not alone, his friends are watching. I'm not sure he really means it.
Obediently I followed her. "Maybe you're right," I said. But we both knew she was doing it for me not to be alone.
going to Hogwarts. If you don't care for your own life, think at least about me and Father. We’ve only just found you. Do you think I give a damn about the Dark Lord or his cause?" She whispers angrily. "Your Father brought this plague on us, and now we've gone too far to turn around. But when all this is over, I want my family whole and safe, whatever the outcome will be. This is all I ever cared for. Remember that. You are going to Hogwarts."
in Diagon Alley. You must get out of Hogwarts. Quickly, we don't have time. Crabbe and Goyle are here searching for you."
He would never hang around with us or anything, but sitting together in classes - in all classes, not just Potions - would become our routine.
or some such. Something I'd hardly be able to pull off. I think it comes down to the way a person holds themselves... their body language and grace, or lack thereof...
"So." He crosses his arms over his chest. "Well... that time when I... used Sectumsempra on Malfoy in the bathroom..."
It's dark, and I am sprawled on the floor. I don't know where I am or how I got here. The last thing I remember...
