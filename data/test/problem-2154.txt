Draco realised, belatedly, that Potter was trying to
“I’ve never met an arsehole, arsier than you.”
“Why are you so pointy.”
Potter grimaced — as if he shamelessly believed, despite being the reason they were in this fucking mess, that he retained the right to grimace.
“Malfoy, are you alright—”
Draco wasn’t sure what irritated him more — the fact that Potter was going around recommending him to people, or the fact that this arrogant slug had very obviously approached
“Greengrass.” He said, in greeting.
“Break Potty’s heart? How

Potter sighed. “Why are you so embittered.”

Undies laughed. Undies thought Draco was funny. This was fair, Draco
Undies looked up at Draco from below his lashes, “if you want… you could always volunteer to take Robards’ lap-dance for him,”

“you’ve both been gone an awfully long time,”
Draco continued, “do you mind giving me and Pot— Harry a few minutes? I think I may have lost my… brooch,”
“Stop rubbing it in my face.”
Undies nodded because Draco had wanted him to. Addy nodded because she’d also noticed the collective flinch that went up a few moments ago, and Addy was brilliant fun.
Draco watched with satisfaction as all of Potter’s fur-like hair — or perhaps hair-like fur was the more accurate description — fell off his body.
The group of shame-faced Aurors nodded grimly.
“I love that song.” Astoria said.
Draco and Potter exchanged a look.
“What, Potter.” Draco spat.
“Malfoy!”
“Are you overreacting?”
Draco pinched Potter's side. “I did actually, because I’m competent. Unlike a certain someone whose name starts with a P and rhymes with Cotter.” Then, Draco pretended to ponder over something, “although I think I might have misspelt your name.”
“I wanted to see the panic on their faces.” Draco answered.

Potter turned to her, “we’ve done nothing, Hermione — I really am Harry, but, uh, it’s complicated,” Potter shot Draco a look.
“What the fuck, Malfoy.”

Perusing the strange forest he’d found himself in, Draco registered an unmistakable groan from above him. He sighed in dismay.

“Perhaps my sister can interest you in a dance, instead?” Draco said, gesturing towards Potter (who stood next to the buffet table, stuffing his face).
Draco shut his mouth and turned back towards Weasel. He was staring like a creep at Granger — who looked stunning, and was consequently garnering the attention of all the eligible bachelors in attendance — but had made no move to talk to her. Draco groaned. Weasel was such a bloody loser.
“You did not, you dirty liar!”
“Very well then, get in the carriage, both of you. What
Robards paused to think. “Okay, that’s acceptable.”
“Fuck you, Potter.”
Potter winced. “It’s a cursed wound. That won’t work.”
“It was sarcasm you fucking idiot. I’ve told The Man-Pig,” Draco inclined his head towards Man-Pig, “that we’re looking for my brooch — use your raisin-sized brain and

Across the room, Pansy and Astoria smirked. Draco vowed to transfigure the sugar in their sugar containers into salt.
Weasel threw his hands in the air, “okay, fine, we’ll just ignore lèse-majesté, I guess,”
Granger lowered her head (Draco almost gaped in response —
Draco exchanged a look with Astoria.
“It’s lovely to be of acquaintance, Miss Harry — I daresay your eyes are lovely as well,”
So why was Draco avoiding them?
“No it doesn’t, shut up.”
Draco inhaled a deep breath, and then let it out in one go.
Astoria smirked. “And break Potter’s delicate heart?”
Potter gave Draco an incredulous look, “says

And that’s when the coffee machine exploded — all over Shacklebolt’s newly bought dress-shirt.
“I agree, Malfoy. What can I say.”
With an obsequious smile on his face, Draco turned, pulling Potter to the side. Once out of direct view, he began whispering furiously, “I think the faerie trapped us in a twisted rendition of Cinderella—”
An awful, awful lightbulb flashed in Draco’s brilliant mind.
Draco made a face.
“Twenty-two.”
angry, but it was anger at himself — a deep, visceral thing that never really went away. Despite everything, he was above externalising that anger on undeserving subjects. It was pathetically crass to do so, after all.
Robards rubbed his eyes, “have you forgotten this morning when you promised to, and I quote, ‘conduct an impromptu lobotomy’ on Potter using your self-inking quill,”
“Vivaldi’s four seasons.”

“Man-pig told me to tell you that he’s taking you on a spa retreat tomorrow,”
“I will hurt you.”
“It’s the truth.”
Potter caught Brown in his arms as she fell forward, “awe Malfoy, did Lavender hurt your manly man feelings?”
Potter (like a predictable fool) began to bristle indignantly.
“Harry! Draco! Where’ve you both been?!” The man-pig looked Draco and Potter up and down, “the state of your
“Malfoy, what the fuck! It took me six months to change my name on the registry!”
"Harry." Draco snapped, pulling said man away from his examination.
Harry's eyes snapped up, and there he was, walking in as if he owned the shop. He was, as ever, dressed like a businessman minus the jacket and he carried two foam cups, a plastic bag dangled of his arm and he had some magazines snuck under it. Harry refused to say they were friends but really, if he thought about it, Draco could be counted as one. When Harry started developing his art, Draco lend out his skin for payment so Harry could master it, but, nowadays while he didn't need him anymore, he just, never left. Sometimes he even brought snacks and ordered, not asked, Harry to do fun things with him. They forged an odd bond, one in self exile, the other exiled and by coincidence moved into apartments in the same block.
Draco had a tough time choosing, stepping back and forth, halting a hand midway whenever he was about to point out one or another until, Harry slapped him playfully on the back of his head and admonished him. "Make a choice, or I won't be doing anything for you today."
That night they arrived back at their home after they'd grabbed some take-away from an Italian place. Everyone in good spirits , Harry especially so. Madame Malkins had confirmed his hopes and said the order would take a while due holiday pressures. She did said that he could expect delivery before the end of the second week in January. She was very apologetic, taking pride in her fast services but Harry understood. He had thanked her profusely and now, at the dinner table, he kept forgetting to actually eat mind drifting back to the preparation process. He couldn't wait to finish up and leave England behind.
Arms folded, Rom grew ever redder and ready to shout but Ginny eyed Draco for a moment and nodded. She took a deep breath and spoke, a voice laced in anger, she spoke seemingly calm. "We've been investigating in the magical surge spikes within this neighbourhood for a time but the output has been scrambled. It has made pin pointing the location quite difficult, but we finally we were able to conclude it came from this building." She took another deep breath to further calm herself. "We are looking to speak with the owner for further information."
"Now," Solomon extended his hand again, nearly jabbing Harry in the chest. He spoke slowly, which was unsettling with his deep, rough voice. "Nice to meet you."
Harry chuckled. "That's good to know, thanks again."
"Illogic? The freakin' front door won't open." He gestured down. "Besides, it's rather high, I don't want to break a leg or something.."
When he looked, he almost yelped. He caught himself in time by slapping both hands against his mouth, trembling heavy, even Draco knew the dark haired man was rapidly building up to a massive panic attack.
Andromeda pulled one map out and folded it open. "The map of Europe," She pointed at the corner and pulled a parchment note spellotaped to the back off. "Notes written with either some short comments, with, for example, learn language, learn culture or dangerous travel zone at the moment or simply notes of which places he would've liked to see or roads to ride which he also marked on the map itself. Sirius planned to travel the world, but, never did."
Harry nodded. Bernadette went on. "If anyone in the village knows anything, within a fortnight we'll know and from there, further action can be taken. While it's true, we have no officials, if the Mayor finds it necessary, he can request a team from the Ministry to come take a look."
"There are other magical beings in the reservoir?" Harry had asked and Charlie had nodded. He said there were, all of them, from centaurs to flubberworms and all enjoying the peace the reservoir brought them.
Andromeda sat, legs pulled up next to Teddy, nursing her hot coffee and occasionally tipping the present with her feet when it threatened to fall off the couch. Harry had taken the chair, lounging, and every now and then he peered out of the window in hopes that an owl would come carrying presents from Ron and Hermione.
"Oh Merlin, that again," Solomon straightened while he sighed and dropped his hand. He sounded overly bored, dragging his words. "I know. One is blue, the other purple and way too bright."
He always has the Marauders Map at the ready- rounding another corner, walking another mile, running past classes and from the lights into the shadows - nowhere to hide, yet, he keeps going all the while wondering; trying and failing to understand why he is here. Here at Hogwarts when he could be anywhere else, searching for that one place he might feel safe and secure, already knowing he can't find it in the castle. Or maybe he can, maybe he hasn't searched well enough. Still. He doesn't get why he is here or maybe he does. It was all because the school board decided they, seventh years who didn't graduate, must be back - were forced back to complete their schooling and find a place in life.
"Because I can?"
"Nice to meet you," Shelley said politely but never took her shocking bright blue eyes, the exact same colour her nephew sported, of the paper she studied. "Hope you'll have a good time here, we're swamped right now so no time for chitchat, thank you and goodbye."
Instead, he explained the easy accessible and save mode of long distance port-keys. It was fairly simple, one purchases a ticket for an exact tine and date of travel from and to designated locations, much like muggle airplanes. The downside being the extreme nausea and dizziness which could be, for an additional fee, be remedied by potions at arrival.
Draco pouted. Actually pouted and went to clear the table but in a rush, Harry stopped him. "Thanks," Harry mumbled. "Appreciate it." He slid the coffee close and merely asked, what he could do for him on this fine day. Which it was, the sun was shining and a light breeze kept the temperature within bounds.
Harry then sat down, deflated. "We could check if they cleaned it, but yeah," He scratched the back of head, feeling a little silly for being so easily wound up. Must be the hero-complex Hermione Granger keeps mentioning. Harry stashed those thoughts away for the moment. "I do like to take some action. Maybe, check it in at the Aurors, let them investigate it? I really don't feel good about it."
"I will not have my first Christmas with my family together be in ruins," Andromeda wagged her finger. "You will wrap today, lazy bums."
Harry bristled and looked at Charlie. He just shrugged helplessly. Then, the guard not so kindly asked them to leave. "Main building is closed, you know that, Charles."
Draco shrugged and dropped his gaze on the floor. "Maybe, but you did came to talk with me when I asked and I'm not finished yet."
Harry nodded. "I know, Draco is a bit miffed he let that slip to me just as we were turning onto your property that's why he is hiding on your couch."
"No, I do have a point, so," Draco corrected and fumbled his keys from his car out of his pocket. He settled an elbow on the table, letting the keys dangle for them both to see. "Why don't we get freshened up and go for a ride? Safest option we got. I have to steer so I can't hex you, and you can't hex me, may it cause both our deaths."
Sure enough, lower on the shelf were books with simple titles, "Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, Durmstrong Institute.." His finger ran across the titles. He knew of those but there were eight more that he didn't know of and he knew he'd found Hermione a gift. Despite being on bad terms with Hermione and Ron, he couldn't imagine not getting them a gift. Ultimately, they were still his best friends, even if, they had a bit of fight going on. He pulled a book from each school and stacked them up on the first one he had found and left to pay.
"Shit." He said with no heat, using the foul muggle word he normally never dared uttering for the third time that day. He sagged to the floor, checked Harry's wrist for a pulse. "Nice timing, scar head. Now what?"
"What happened to you?" He asked curiously.
Draco nodded. "If that's all?" He stood and opened the door for them.
Harry sat stunned, still holding half a cup of tea as his eyes followed Andromeda who left the kitchen. True enough, they superficially cleared the air between them but neither boy was comfortable enough with the other yet as they hadn't gone further then dotting out each major event that happened during their years at Hogwarts and muttering out an apology as they acknowledged their part in said altercation.
"Yeah, it's pretty." Charlie acknowledged and quickly dragged Harry through the gate, muttering the password loud enough for Harry to hear as they went.
Harry ended up at Andromeda Tonks' house, not knowing where else to go. With him appearing right in front of her gates, a little too close, the wards were breached and an alarm sounded, loudly ringing in his ears. Standing there, Harry watched how she rushed out the house, her midnight blue robes billowing dangerously as she moved with her wand in hand and ready to attack.
Andromeda leaned over the table, taken a slight pity as she patted Harry on the head, saying soft encouragements and at that, Draco left the kitchen. He remembered well how hard Harry had studied the last three months and he thought Harry had noting to worry about.
"Thanks, Mrs Dell'elion." Harry said politely when he closed the door.
"Uhh, yeah.." Harry hackled.
"Ahh.." The black haired wizard sighed and scratched the back of his head. Draco in turn send him a deadly glare whilst swatting, as far as he could manage, at the curtain to stop: "It's ruining my hair, you fool! Tell me what you did!"
"Oh! Well, there is our workspace, of the Dragon-handlers I mean," Charlie changed directions. "Its were we clock in, get our schedules and tasks, deliver reports and such, all the fun work stuff."
There wasn't anything left to say when Harry's front door was blown down. Harry jumped behind the couch Draco sat on. The blast knocked Draco sprawling, arms and legs wide by pressure and the couch almost toppled over. It wobbled on its legs but remained standing. Draco tried to move but three wands were shoved into his face. Two came close, one actually touched the tip of his nose. When he looked up, he knew he was toast. The two Weasleys were there, along with another Auror he'd never seen before. The man was tall, broad and very, very angry.
Draco followed him with raised eyebrows until Harry was done and took his seat at the table, holding a cup of coffee. Only then did Harry look up, white as a sheet and with dark circles under his eyes.
"I can work with that." Harry said resolutely. "Thank you, Mrs. Dell'elion."
"What's that?" Charlie asked, taking a step to the side and crouching down. Their laughter gone, Harry went over. He looked over Charlie's shoulder and frowned while Charlie grabbed a stick to poke at it.
"It's odd," Draco who'd agreed to Harry's notion. "Christmas shopping was so peaceful."
"More than I need though," He answered and tapped one stack. "These are for the drivers licence and these," He tapped the other stack. "These are about taking care of the motor, it wasn't said I needed to learn that, but, if I'm going far and stuff, I guessed I need to know how to fix the bike will it break on me."
Harry didn't know what to say, he just nodded and Charlie went on. "It's not that far yet, however, right now, and this has loosely started around the 1930's, the Ministries began having huge problems with dragon sightings. They have entire teams dedicated to obliviate muggles. Since it's such a problem, the ministries decided that getting rid of them would be much easier and dragons started to drop like flies. That's when they founded the Sanctuary, dragons as a whole almost became extinct. many species are extinct and right behind us, we're breeding and saving abandoned eggs to regrow what we've lost."
Meanwhile, the voices grew impatient, louder and knocks on the door came in rapid. Draco gave it no heed, didn't even look but instead rushed over to the mirror. He looked and with some awkward bending retrieved the needle from his back, letting in dangle on its wire and donned his shirt. He was glad he choose black that morning, pinpricks of blood welling up and soaking in the material, he checked for his wand. "Here we go, I'll be right back." He said to Harry, who didn't hear him anyway. Too wrapped up in panic.
Kreacher looked at him wide-eyed, Harry comically mirroring the movement. "Master?"
"Ready to go?" Charlie asked when Harry put his empty pint on the table.
"Honestly," He sighed. "There's a lot of bad blood between us. One car ride will not correct what animosity we created between us but I can, we got to the point where we can be civil."
"Hey four-eyes, how's life?" The man clad in a crisp black button up and dark blue slacks said, a grin on his face. "I've brought coffee, magazines and lunch, call me perfect."
"What?! I thought you locked me in! You let me out!" Came Harry's shouted reply, making Draco stop his act; realizing he was caught in an anger fit against the door, he flushed red and shouted back. "That's not funny, let me in! I'm freezing!"
Harry Potter simply didn't care. There he was, standing on platform nine and three quarters, about to board the Hogwarts express that would bring him and his two best friends back to the castle for their repeat of seventh year.
The room, four walls with one covered in wire choices and a see through mirror door to the front didn't hold much. There being just a metal supply cart, a chair, as well as a bed in the middle and a basin next to the mirrors set in a corner for good view. A machine stood on the other side against the wall to clean and stock his instruments in. The room was cold and kept empty for easy cleaning.
Two days later and the loud bang that apparently came from the clock on the first hallway sounded every hour, making anything nearby shake on its place. It was unexplainable, same fact went for the front door still not opening and their kitchen that had turned purple from ceiling to floor.
"Where is the owner?" Ginny asked.
Draco turned to look at her. "What if I say I'm the owner and I do not know what your speaking of and thus, cannot provide any information?"
Harry who had handed Teddy over, smiled and followed Andromeda, curious as to why they went into the study.
All in all, the box made him happy and Andromeda gracefully accepted the bar of Honeydukes dark chocolate he offered her. He knew that was the only flavor she'd eat on occasion.
Ron gaped and silence reigned between them. Ron sat down next to him. There in a dinghy, dirty side alley smelling of garbage and cat piss, Ron and Harry sat side by side talked quietly without interference and Ron came up with the most brilliant idea. "You should take that vacation, go see Charlie, I bet he's happy to have you."
Harry always got in a worried frenzy with such tales, broom accidents were dangerous. He flew a lot, so all the more aware of the deadly endings it could have. "But?"
"That's Silas Soul," Charlie pointed and the guy broke his conversation briefly for a quick smile and wave. "The girl is his niece, Shelley. There are our administrators."
Charlie immediately continued to drag Harry towards the double door entrance but Harry stopped him. A little shy, he fiddled with the camera until he got it of his neck and held it up to Charlie in a silent question.
Miraculously so, he did. Within five minutes his nausea left, the dizziness faded away and he felt better, much better. He got off the floor and looked at the Lady. Old, wrinkled and dressed in garb Trelawney would be jealous of, she smiled and ever young, winked and spoke, voice strong, "I would ask how the journey went but it's always awful, so lets not. Now giddy up and out, I've got another load coming in," She checked a muggle watch on her wrist in a grandeur fashion, "In about three minutes."
"Hold on," Harry stopped him and pointed around the rest of the building. "What is rest then?"
A pop in the air was heard and his house elf bowed over him. "Master? Yous Ok?"
Harry bit his lip and tapped his knee against Draco's and he tore his gaze away to lock it with Harry. With practiced ease, Draco pulled up his sleeve, the dark mark came in sight but neither looked at it, preferring to stare at each other. In silence, Draco wrapped a well used leather strap over his upper arm, and tore it, tight, successfully pinching of the blood flow. He raised the potion bottle and held it, ready to tip over above the crook of his elbow where the skin was already littered with little black points and faint blue veins. He raised a daring eyebrow at Harry.
"Easy," Charlie approached him as if going near a scared animal while hushing Harry's loud voice. "She's just a receptionist. All she does is pass along the message to the right people and hope they take care of it before the one who gave the message comes back to yell at her for it not happening." Charlie almost stumbled over his words when he rushed to say it. He never liked dealing with angry people, he too felt discomfort and worry but he wished Harry would just calm down a bit as it made him feel even worse out of sorts.
"Really?" Charlie breathed out. "I mean, I did a lot of tidying up and stuff and since we don't really have guestrooms I figured I settle you in here because a couch isn't-"
"Yes, you." Draco said smugly. "You do that and I'll free myself."
Within minutes, Harry found himself being hoisted into protective gear by Gavriil. It was hard to chew the sandwich Zhanna had given him – "Nobody starves on my watch"- while Gavriil tucked on him left and right , and also trying to pay attention at the safety briefing Charlie was sprouting out. He was lucky for his experience in flying, it cut Charlie's instructions short. He mainly rehearsed that claw and bite marks were hard to heal, fire hurt and to keep them at distance - "Don't let them barrel into you, their force will knock you right of your broom" - Within thirty minutes both were walking in complete gear and with borrowed brooms out the back of the building towards a large pen.
Harry nodded and dutifully repeated her name with another thanks. He made his way to the backdoor, dreading the walk back to Charlie's home. He hoped the redhead was back already, because he needed to loan his broom. All the way over, he cursed himself for not bringing his own and vowed to send a letter home and request it be sent over to him before the day was done.
When he asked what she came for she smiled sweetly. "I've been invited to watch over you redoing the library with no magic whilst your ferret is off to work. It's going to be so much fun!"
"Thank you." Harry said his goodbyes. He made quick work of getting in and out the shop, and made the decision of a little walk through the garden when he was instructed to come back in thirty minutes to pick up his photo.
Harry felt tired and knew he needed to sleep but every time he closed his eyes the events of the day filled his mind, especially the flying, and excitement rushed through him. He had loved it so much.

“Arsier’s not a word, fool.”
“Wha— No!
“Tragic.”
Lenio: (Fandom) Pain-relieving spell
Draco was much too exhausted to come up with an appropriate repartee. On principle, however, he shot Potter a scathing look.
“Let me get this straight,” Robards began, rubbing his temples, “you made a bet which resulted in you voluntarily refusing medical treatment, which consequently almost resulted in irreparable damage which could have been permanently debilitating.”
“I’m flattered, but I’m afraid not,”
“Wait, Robards. It was a moment of stupidity—” Potter began.
Draco refused to blush. “Potter’s pathetically in love with your boyfriend’s little sister.”
“Oh shut up, Malfoy — it took you six months to talk to that cute mailman—”
And here comes another one.
Weasel. Was. The. Prince.
Once in plain view of everyone in the room, Draco turned to Potter, their faces only a few inches apart.
Draco shot Astoria a scathing look.
“THE RAID WAS VERY EVENTFUL!” Potter interrupted, his eyes wide. “Tell me more about the office — did you finish all the paperwork?”
“Harry Potter — it’s lovely to be of acquaintance,” Potter grinned, looking a bit like he had to go wee.
Fury erupted in Draco’s mind. Outwardly, he smiled a smile the temperature of ice.
There was also, and more crucially, the fact that the decision most probably had something to do with Draco’s lovely black tattoo. (The whole skull-snake-death-eater shebang.)
“What, Malfoy.”
Draco walked stiffly into Astoria’s cubicle. He walked stiffly not because he was angry, but rather because doing so made it appear like he was angry. And
“Robards.” Potter spoke up, suddenly.
Head Auror Robards sighed heavily in the background, “will you two give it a rest? You’ve just uncovered an illegal cartel — an illegal
“Give Robards a five minute lap-dance.” Undies answered.
“Yes, Minister?”
Potter ran towards Robards, and threw himself at him, kissing him on the other cheek.
“No, you’re my stalker.”
That being said, as flattering as Undies’ little crush was, under his impenetrable smile Draco was largely uninterested and greatly uncomfortable.
“No.”
they make me sound smart,”
“How could you make all those old men think I wanted to marry them?!”
Potter took Teddy’s hands in his. “Hey Teddy, what’s Draco?”
As always, Potter flushed, “of sucking you? You wish.”
Potter turned to Draco incredulously, “did you sign me off as Hairy Pooter again.”
“I did, you weakling.”
“I suppose it’s impossible to wear Undies while you’re on the Potty,” Pansy sighed.
“Stop taking your frustration out on me.”
want to sleep with them?” Draco asked, innocently.
“I’m planning on murdering some puppies when I get home.”
“Your brooch!? The pearl one?!” Draco nodded solemnly, “go on, go on! Quickly, now,”
“Shut the fuck up, Malfoy — no you’re not.” Potter rolled his eyes.
“You know me so well, Hairy Pooter.” Draco beamed at Potter.
“I will tear your testicles off,”
Draco bit back his laughter at seeing Potter’s awkward flirting fail. “Where to, Miss Brown?”
So, of course, Draco was left with the duty of explaining all it was that required explaining.
Draco hissed, filled with fear that if Weasel never got his act together he’d be stuck in this godforsaken world forever.

Because he could. (And one of the pillars of Wizarding Britain was the right to free will, damn it.)

Addy winked at Draco and grinned back.
Brown looked up at Draco, “yes, I am — and you are?”
“Tell them, Potter, about your distasteful fetishes,” Draco continued, following Potter’s minute movements with his eyes.
“Don’t speak to me.”
Draco’s smirk widened.

Draco yawned lazily, “calm down Pooter, you’ll hurt yourself. More than you—”
Despite his unfavourable mood, Draco felt himself smile. “It’s nice to know you’re having a good day.”
And so they shut up. For approximately forty seconds. Then, Potter said:
Potter scowled back.
“Oh, just after Prince Ron,”
Potter squeaked.
“Okay, so let me get this straight — the world that I’m living in is a mirror image of

Happy New Year everybody!!!!
Draco massaged his temples. He wished, briefly, that this was a nightmare. Then, he glanced surreptitiously at Potter. The Potter in Draco’s nightmares looked
Draco smiled maliciously. “Great.” Then he turned around the room and pointed his wand at everyone who was trying unsuccessfully to hide their wounds, “all of them hurt themselves.” Then, Draco began firing off spells, left, right and centre. “
“Stop squirming, Potter.” Draco snarled.
Draco glanced at Potter’s tightly clenched fists.
“I’d imagine whoever it was that had to give you the lap-dance would share the same sentiment.” Potter said.
“He’s Ron, Malfoy.”
(This wasn’t technically a lie. Draco did actually know of these spells. He’d just been too scared to learn any of them.)
Undies grinned, “we made a bet — the first one to end up in Mungo’s has to give Robards a lap-dance.”
stepsisters — one of whom was heart-wrenchingly beautiful, and the other whom looked like a talking ball of hair.
“Why, Malfoy.”
“Nah, he’s always been barmy,”
“Yes,”
Draco shook his head, “all I did was choose the music.”
“I’d never rather die than give you a lap-dance.” Undies said, ever the loyal admirer.
“I could destroy you without moving a single inch of my body.”

It felt like he’d been hit in the head with a bludger. Wincing, he scanned his surroundings.
“So, Potter.” Draco started.
Potter rolled his eyes. Granger and Weasel’s weirdly disturbing open-mouthed kisses were increasing in intensity by the minute. Draco felt extremely uncomfortable. And then, Draco saw Weasel’s wandering hands.

“Why are you so awkward with your feelings.”
Granger attempted to sneak back home at five am the next morning. Little did she know that Draco was in her bedroom waiting for her, wand in hand and hour-long lecture on the tip of his tongue.

“Yes, happy new year to you too, Malfoy,”
Everyone — notably, Potter — paled considerably.
“Step-fath—” the man-pig frowned — “Vern—” Granger’s eyes widened —
Potter gave Draco an indecipherable look.
Draco smiled sweetly, “let’s just leave them here and fend for ourselves,”
After about thirty seconds, Granger opened her mouth to speak, “... tell me more.”
“Only in your dreams.”

(Also — I'm very, very exhausted, so please forgive any grammatical errors)
Was Draco being unnecessarily rude? Probably. Did a majority of the DMLE deserve Draco’s rudeness? Well, sometimes they did. In this particular instance though, not really.
My word, get in the carriage right
“Robards!”
Potter’s flush darkened.
“Well, you said you were partners—”
“He’s never going to talk to her at this rate!”
“What?”
“Send a message to everyone to meet me in the amphitheatre in ten minutes.”
Potter looked at Granger with a face of indescribable horror.
“Listen here,
Out of the corner of his eye, Draco saw Granger giving both Potter and him an odd look.
Andromeda laughed in the background. “So what happened after that, Draco?”

make them think that,”
“Poy— Poy-Tee? Dwaco?” Teddy frowned, his black fur melting into beautiful white-blond locks.
Teddy smiled a gummy smile at Draco, “Silly Dwaco. That Hawwy Pooter.”
“You’re ugly.”
Draco bit back a swear.
“Sorry, Malfoy — why are you so stuck up.”
“You lot. Get ready to perform a thirty minute group strip show in front of the entire department.”
“I’m surprised none of you ended up in St. Mungo’s.” Draco said, evenly.
“Huh?”
“Do something, Potter.”
Draco snarled at Potter and vowed to tear the wings of the faerie-bastard who had imprisoned them in this crazy, twisted world.
Granger looked up at him, “thank you, Draco — these are the loveliest clothes I’ve ever seen,”
“Because you want you keep your testicles intact.” Draco said, calmly.
“...And then, Potter’s shirt got stuck on his head—”
“Ooh, Malfoy — a man of
The someone-or-the-other didn’t know how to take a hint, “not even a waltz?”
“No, you fucking toad, I’m being sarcastic.”
Draco smiled and started to trail the hand he had on Potter’s waist down towards Potter’s leg. Potter’s eyes widened. From behind them, someone (and by someone, Draco meant Pansy Bitch-Face Parkinson) wolf-whistled. “Go fuck yourself, Pansy.” Draco said, his hand now lingering on Potter’s thigh. Ignoring Pansy’s laughter, Draco leaned closer to Potter. “You’re certain you haven’t hurt yourself?” Potter nodded, a challenge in his eyes. “Did everyone get that?” Draco asked.
Draco bit back his grin. “Why are you here, cow?”
“Yeah, don’t worry about it — hey, Malfoy,”
Draco set Teddy down on Andromeda’s lap, covered his eyes with Andromeda’s hands and punched Potter in the face.

And of course, that was the moment that Shacklebolt lost his fucking marbles.
“Hey, Potter—”
“It was great. How was the office? Do you feel like any more of a sulking child now?”
Draco snapped his head towards the unmistakable brunette who was making her way after Granger and Weasel.
Draco ignored Potter’s inconsequential babble and continued, “I’m afraid I’ve no idea what happened to your
“Shut your mouth, Malfoy.”
Draco shut his mouth. Potter looked sorrowfully at the floor.
“Right. So, how are you two going to get back?”
“So?”
Draco grinned. “That’s true, silly me.”
“You stupid bitch—” Draco whispered back, furious.
“—WHY CAN’T YOU JUST FUCKING
Draco looked at Potter, tamping down his glee. “So, Potter. It’s horrible to see that you’re
And that is the story of how Robards had to floo both Draco and Potter to St. Mungo’s for exacerbated internal bleeding.
Yet despite all that, despite his obviously superior IQ, it had somehow slipped his mind that if Granger was Cinderella, in this horrible, twisted world, Weasel was the prince.
Astoria sighed, “ah, the beauty of friendship.”
“... So you’re not related?” Granger asked.
Draco froze.
“May I request of this beautiful lady, a dance?” Asked someone whose name Draco had already forgotten.
“Potter you cockroach, how utterly useless can you get? You can’t even
“Did you do that?” Potter demanded.
Potter had the good grace to look abashed, “no, of course not. I — uh, I apologise for offending you, Greengrass.”
Savage looked at Draco. “Is everyone you know like this.”
Merlin knows why.”
Potter ran his hands through his
“Why are you so scared of commitment.”
“Don’t you dare, you insufferable pig—”
“Stop talking to yourself,” Draco muttered, pulling himself off the grass. It was then that he realised — with rather disconcerting apathy — that he was wearing a dress.
Potter scowled. “It’s two fucking inches, arsehole. And yes, I haven’t hurt myself.”
“You fucking idiot.” Draco snarled.
Draco sat down gingerly on his own chair, wincing slightly. Then, he glared at Potter.
He’d passed his auror exams with flying colours, and if it weren’t for that little black mark on his resumé (Prior Occupation:

“Malfoy!”
“Oh my god, where’s Harry.”
“We’re best friends, ‘Mione,” Potter smiled foolishly.

Draco smiled acidly. “You’d think that, wouldn’t you? Unfortunately” —

Granger’s mouth twitched, “right. So both of you are blood related in

“Draaaaaaacccccoooooooooooooo,”

Draco dearly hoped that is wasn’t Shacklebolt. And of course — because Draco had hoped for something with all his heart — it turned out to be Shacklebolt.
“Potter.”
Potter moved his leg backwards and failed to hide a wince. “Yes. Completely normal and unharmed.”
“That was a big word, Potter. Hope it didn’t hurt your brain.”
“Shut up, Astoria. All men are wolves.” Draco snapped, glaring viciously at the few men who’d been looking, shamelessly, at Astoria’s bosom.
A voice called from downstairs,

“Why are you such a toad.”

“Wh— That’s none of your business, I’m old enough to make my own decisions—”
There was complete and utter silence. Draco stared at the floor and willed back his laughter.
Draco gasped. “Fuck you, Potter.”
“Wha—
“Weasel’s the Prince. I can be whatever I want.”
Draco cocked an eyebrow, “scared, Potter?”
“Oh anytime, Malfoy.”
“Mmm.”
Draco looked at Potter cooly. Then, he opened his mouth, “hey, Undies—”
It took Weasel two bloody weeks to get his shit together and find Granger.
“You have the

but that would be a lie.”
Draco turned to a middle-aged man standing a few steps away from him, “excuse me, Sir? My name’s Draco Malfoy, it’s lovely to meet you. I’m here on behalf of my sister — she’s the tall, black-haired one at the buffet table — she was admiring your coat earlier—”
Also: I apologise for what I've written, because I just re-read it and it is most certainly absolute trash, but, well, I did try.
Adelaide Murton — Addy — smiled at Draco, “Muggle lingerie.”
“Merlin, he’s trying to eat her face.”
“Who has better comebacks — Potter or I?”
“Here, Granger — wear this and sneak out, once we’ve left,”
“Thank you Undies — did you all decide on what the loser has to wear when they give Robards the lap-dance?”
Draco rolled his eyes and kicked the jostling tree. Potter fell to the grassy floor with a loud thud. It was then that Draco noticed — with indescribable glee — that Potter was
“our little Potty here’s a kinky fiend.”
“Well, Hermione, we were kind of hoping you could help us with that…”
“Oh, but it’s so much
“Oh?”
“Shut up.” Potter said, weakly.
“Father.” Draco paused to swallow back the bile which had arisen upon calling this abhorrent creature his father.
“Hexing an unsuspecting opponent — what a spineless worm you are, Potter,” Draco sneered.
intelligent man. Throughout a majority of his Hogwarts education he’d come second to only Granger herself (excluding sixth and seventh year, in which his life was consumed by a fucking psychopath.)
“Pansy, she gave them to me the day i came back, she said ‘it is time to begin your muggle loving initiation!’ and so we spent almost three days watching muggle cartoons and various horrible movies.” He was still chuckling a bit but now his brow creased and he took on the expression of a drunk man who was overly concerned about something stupid.
“I’ll get him sorted ma’am.” Harry nodded and draped Malfoy’s arm about his shoulders.
“Mr. Malfoy, is it wrong of me to presume that you are heavily intoxicated at this moment?” Her stern gaze rested on his bloodied hair and her face softened a bit.
hey guys, idk if anyone is paying like attention to this story but im gonna do a re write of it. im never happy with my writing so yeah idk that'll happen soon thanks so much to everyone who liked it
He tried his best to sober up, but the nearly full bottle of top shelf firewhiskey bubbled in his stomach and he failed at holding a straight face.
“Oh! Profes- I mean uh… Headmistress! Fancy er, meeting you here?” He was trying so hard not to laugh, but her massive witches hat had this bloody awful peacock feather in it and Salazer did he hate peacocks. He accidentally let loose a snicker, and he could tell by the look on her face that this was the wrong course of action.
“Mr. Malfoy, i understand you aren’t handling your situation very well, but i need to remind you that this behavior is unacceptable for more reasons than simply breaking school rules. I’m going to let you off with five points from the 8th years and a warning that you are required to attend group therapy. I’ll help you back to the dorms but if i see this again i wont be so forgiving.” She stood up and grasped his elbow in her oddly strong grip.
“Well thank you for your generosity Mr. Potter, five points to the 8th years for helping a classmate in need, now goodnight to you both. Oh and do get some sleep Potter.” She left the room with a swirl of her robes and a clack of heels, leaving Harry Potter and a very drunk Draco Malfoy alone.
He could hear low whispers from the kitchen but only caught the occasional phrase or word. There was quite a lot of mention of his parents' names, and a moment of near yelling from Molly when Dumbledore brought up the ministry. The soft clamor of pots and pans filled the space when silence fell, and soon the whole downstairs smelled extraordinarily delicious. She walked out from the kitchen with two full plates and a small bowl, one was set in front of Draco and the other handed to Dumbledore as he took a seat, Molly sat too with her little bowl. In front of Draco was the largest, most colorful plate of home made food he had ever had the pleasure of seeing, it was beans on toast with fried sausage, mashed sweet potatoes, vegetable cakes, sliced turkey smothered in gravy, and a messy slice of cherry pie. He had no idea how Molly had made all of this food seemingly out of thin air, and in what seemed like less than ten minutes. Dumbledore was sat next to him with a similar plate filled with food, and Molly was sitting across them with a little bowl of chocolate pudding, it looked perfect, like what a family should eat.
Her eyes drooped and she began to frown, but it wasn’t so pinched and angry as before. She knelt down next to him and took her wand out to heal his forehead.
He figured Ron would take good care of Hedwig until he came to get Harry, or if he came to get him that was. He tried to tell himself not to think like that, Ron was his best mate no way he would leave him stuck here all summer with the bloody Dursleys. Since he had quite a bit of time before the lights would be turned out and everyone went to bed, Harry let his eyes drift closed. Hedwig was warm enough he didn't even need a blanket, and she seemed quite content to have a quick rest on Harry's lap after that ordeal. He drifted off with his hand resting on her back while she made soft cooing noises.
“Well, erm, that depends i suppose on whether i’ll have to snog a dementor for it.” He paused and hiccoughed and held back his roiling stomach. “And may i say, dear headmistress, that you look just stunning tonight. Radiant in fact!” He tried to give his best ‘how charming and sweet i am’ smile, but by her expression he assumed it looked more like a ‘pissed out of this universe’ grimace.
“Gracious is there really only one though? I’ll have to find the other one tomorrow or she’ll gut me like her first husband.” Harry hoped the fucker would fall asleep soon, he had no clue what to say to half the shit Malfoy was telling him about. Luckily it seemed Malfoy didn’t care much if Harry responded at all.
“Thank you headmistress, sorry for being an arse.” He graced her with a small smile and did his best not to fall over as they made their way back to the dorms.
This was the exact subject he had been trying so hard to avoid, and he’d been doing a pretty good job of it if his contraband whiskey had anything to say. He avoided her intense gaze and focused on the bit of skin he had been picking on his hand since he had gotten out of Azkaban.
“Draco, have you been attending the required 8th year therapy sessions lately? I’ve heard from the healers that they’ve missed you for quite a while.” She helped him sit up a bit straighter and rested in front of him on her knees.
He made his way back up to his own dorm that he shared with Ron. He had been offered a private room, but Ron was his best friend and neither of them really wanted to be alone at night. Though it was a little awkward when Hermione was able to sneak in, but Harry knew when he was meant to make himself scarce. Which had been why he was on the couch so late tonight, but he figured they’d be asleep by now.
As he was drifting off to sleep, curled up like a child on the old velvet chair, a loud knock rang through the echoing halls of the manor. Draco startled awake and quickly unfolded his stiff legs to walk to the front door. It was too bloody far, just like everything in this damned house, Draco thought to himself as he stumbled over the folds in the rug. He paused at the door handle, fingertips barely touching the cold silver knob, he didn't have to answer, he could hide away in this house until he died of starvation or froze to death. Another booming knock shook him away from those thoughts, and he opened the massive dark wood door to reveal Albus Dumbledore, his school headmaster. He had a warm smile on his face, and the rush of seeing someone familiar almost knocked Draco over. "Ah, Draco my boy, how are you?" Draco did his best to remember all the things his father had told him about Dumbledore, a phony, a liar, too old, demented fool, blood traitor, but right now he couldn't find the energy to think those things, he was starving and exhausted. "I'm well sir, won't you come in?" Draco stepped aside and allowed the one person he was told to avoid at all costs to enter his home. Draco led the headmaster through the halls into the large sitting room and moved some items off the couch to allow dumbledore to rest. "I would offer you tea sir but i believe this house is right set on keeping all food and drink away from me"  Draco went back to the velvet armchair that was now across from dumbledore and did his best to sit gracefully. "Draco, when is the last time you saw or heard from your mother?" That was the million dollar question, everyone wanted to know where Narcissa was. Draco huffed what sounded like a laugh but left the air empty, "sir, i haven't heard anything from my mother in almost four days now, and no, i don't know where she went."
Harry smiled fondly at him and kept his voice at a whisper. “Mate, you’re never gonna believe where i w-” He stopped short when an absolutely thunderous snore caught his sentence and snuffed away his words. He laughed softly and slipped under his covers, setting his glasses on the table and his wand under his pillow.
McGonagall blushed a tad and purposefully looked around the common room before clearing her throat.
“Yes Mr. Potter, though i believe i will be giving a short speech at breakfast about the importance of asking for help and to dissuade students from participating in self medicating.” Harry, having apparently understood what was being said, simply nodded and glanced at Malfoy who was now putting all his energy in standing and not spilling his bottle of half digested whiskey on the poor Headmistresses lovely shoes.
Harry awoke with a jolt, he'd had a terrible nightmare about wormtail talking (or grovelling) to Voldemort, it didn't seem like anything important was going on, though he thought he heard mention of Narcissa Malfoy which was odd. As he sat up and wiped the sweat off his forehead, he saw that the lights under the door were gone, meaning it was past ten O'clock PM, and it was likely everyone was asleep. After all the years of having to escape locked doors without magic, Harry had learned how to pick locks manually. All he needed was two sharp flat objects and he could escape anything. He found a few broken quill tips and some small nails on the floor, and set to work deciding what he could use to get out. He grabbed a couple of the nails and shoved them into the keyhole of his small door. After about a solid five minutes of haphazardly fiddling with the rusty lock, he finally heard the click he was waiting for. He wasn't done yet however, the chair under the door was still an issue. He pushed the door as much as he could, cringing at every little squeak against the floor, until he could shove his fingers in between the door and the wall. He pushed the edge of the chair until he felt it fall against the floor, he whipped the door open and stopped the chair just before it could crash down and expose him. He looked around and saw the light under Vernon and Petunias door turn out, a sign they were just about to fall asleep. He waited about another five minutes before standing up and stretching his stiff knees and popping his back, he reached back in the closet and softly woke Hedwig, who seemed to understand now was not the time for a loving screech.
Harry."
“Right, don’t die then i suppose.” This had to be the weirdest night Harry had experienced in a while, but he praised himself for handling it so well. Malfoy was definitely out cold by now, not quite snoring but more just letting out a puff of breath on the exhale. He looked peaceful, which is not something Harry had ever thought about this particular bastard.
"DO NOT RETURN HEDWIG, KEEP HER WITH YOU! Oy Ron mate you remember when you picked me up from the dursleys in that flying car from second year? i need a bit of that right now as i've made a mess of things and am now locked back in that little closet. Don't worry though mate i'll be good for a couple days just come and get me if you can in a bit, send a letter through the post slot it'll slip under my door and i'll handle things from there mate. see you soon.
“Oh, yeah of course Headmistress. Is everything alright?” He took hesitant steps over to the both of them and grasped the elbow she handed over to him.
"You! Of course it was you! Good heavens I can't believe we even let you stay here you insolent blasphemous child, go to the closet immediately and don't make a single sound!" Harry was standing in the middle of what looked like a war zone, pillows were ripped with stuffing floating through the air, and Dudley was laying on the ground, stunned and making pathetical little whimpering noises. He had tried to touch Hedwig, he was too rough and Hedwig had nipped at his fingers, so he pulled one of her feathers out. When Harry heard her shriek from his room he had dashed up the stairs, barely touching the steps. When he saw Dudley standing next to his poor owl he felt his blood boil and his anger shot out everywhere like tiny bullets, ripping up the pillows and curtains and everything within reach, including Dudleys left shoulder and foot. He wasn't even bleeding, just knocked over and scared. Harry was sure he would be fine, but he had made this horribly dramatic noise as he fell and practically shook the whole bloody house. Petunia had raced up the stairs nearly as fast as Harry and was immediately sobbing over her precious little boy, screaming her damn head off at Harry, who felt just as stunned as Dudley. Vernon took quite a bit longer to get up those dastardly stairs, (he swore one day he would pay someone to fix them as they were far too steep) but when he did he made such a scene you'd think Harry had just murdered his whole family in cold blood.
Harry Potter was sitting on the common room couch, looking like the essay he was writing was perhaps the most difficult thing he’d ever faced (all Dark Lords and Death Eaters included). He looked up as the door opened and his sleepy eyes lit up with shock.
“Alright Malfoy let’s get you up to bed before you sick up on me.” Which was seeming more and more like a very real possibility.
“Are you gonna be alright Malfoy? I don’t know if McGonagall wanted me to make sure you didn’t choke on your own vomit.” Harry didn’t know CPR or anything about taking care of drunk people, and he felt thoroughly unprepared for this task.
“Ah, Mr. Potter, if you would be so kind as to help Mr. Malfoy here up to his bedroom. I do believe the rooms are warded against all women, including myself.” She smiled tightly at harry as he stood up from the couch.
Dumbledore's smile had been slowly losing its luster since he had entered the house, it was freezing cold, there was no food or drink for this young boy, and his mother was nowhere to be found. "Draco i do believe you need some help until she can be located, the ministry is doing everything they can to find her, but she is using very strong cloaking magic." Dumbledore understood that the young man in front of him valued pride and honor over most things, and that this news wouldn't be a happy event. "I am perfectly capable of living on my own headmaster." This was a lie, the tremble in his legs gave away that he hadn't eaten in three days and he was dangerously exhausted. "I understand that Draco, but unfortunately wizarding law in London does not share that sentiment. While you are underage it is required you be guarded by adult wizards or witches." Dumbledore knew Draco was not actually able to care for himself, and since Narcissa had disappeared, Draco had no family left for him. Draco slumped back in the velvet green armchair and rested his head in his hands. "What would you have me do sir? Mother is gone, Father is in bloody azkaban, and all my family members are absolutely insane." Dumbledore shifted his oddly coloured shoes, he knew this was about to be the emotional breakdown of the century. "This isn't going to be easy for you my boy, but I have a family who is willing to care for you as long as needed." Draco looked up from his hands, surprised any sane wizarding family would want him in their house. Dumbledore cleared his throat a bit and pushed forward, "It's the weasley family, they've agreed to care for you." Well that would explain the 'sane' part then, Draco thought to himself. He felt the heat rise in his neck and cheeks, how could Dumbledore think to place a boy like Draco Malfoy with, of all people, the weasleys?
Molly cleared her throat a bit, she was shuffling her hands  and looking away, "Now Draco, i just wanted to let you know that Arthur and I were of course hesitant to take you in, only because of pressure from the ministry to, as they put it, 'correct your upbringing'. We understand that you must be horribly confused right now and the last thing we want to do is put any further strain on that, but I must stress that this is a tolerant household and we will not accept any name calling or things of the sort." She looked very stern for the first time, and Draco realized just how much she loved her children and the lengths she would go to protect them. He wished he could say the same about his mother. "I understand Mrs. Weasley, and please trust me when i say i don't share all the same values as my family, i am terribly sorry for any grief i have caused in the past." He felt the shame of his father's actions spread hotly through his neck, he really didn't believe anyone deserved to feel less than, but he couldn't help wanting his fathers approval, and doing anything to just get a fraction of the love he deserved. "I would like to thank you right now for helping me, and i promise i won't take up much energy or space, i'm capable of taking care of myself for the most part." Molly shook her head and tsked at Draco, but she knew he needed to eat and didn't push the subject of how capable he was. "Don't you worry lovey, eat up now and i'll make up a bed for you when you're done."  Draco happily obliged and began to stuff himself with the hearty meal, it made him ten times warmer and his eyes started feeling heavier and heavier.

“I’m all good ma’am, honestly i don't quite need those sessions. Besides, it’s kind of weird to hear everyone talk about their dead relatives and then stare at me like i’m why it all happened.”  He could tell he was rambling now, so he quickly shut his mouth.
She spoke the password and helped him through the entrance. Since it was nearly 1 in the morning, they were both surprised to see that anyone was awake.
“Malfoy have you been wandering about the castle wearing one singular muggle princess sock?” It was bright pink, way too small, and had multiple copies of one of those cartoon princesses little muggle children loved. This was clearly the funniest thing that stupid drunk bastard had ever heard, his eyes flew open and he laughed so loudly that Harry could hear someone yell “shut it!” a couple rooms over. Malfoy quieted a bit but was still shaking with laughter.
As Harry left the room quietly, he heard a soft “Thank you, Potter…” from a still very asleep Malfoy. He smiled to himself, “Night Malfoy.”
It was cold and dreary outside of Malfoy Manor, as per bloody usual. The inside wasn't that different, Draco didn't know how to light the fireplace as it required a special incantation his mother created. Narcissa had also taken the family house elf wherever the hell she had run off to so he couldn't even call upon the small creature for help. He hadn't bothered to learn the name of this new one after Dobby had been freed, what was the point of it when he was almost 17 anyways. Draco knew he needed to figure things out fast, so far he had been sleeping and looking for some kind of food in the house. Again, Narcissa and Lucius knew all the charms required to make this beautiful house work, they were meant to teach him on his 17th birthday. Draco realized at that moment that he might not even see them on his birthday.
Draco was now sitting at a worn wooden table, so big it filled the frightfully small dining room, and it was covered with some sort of sticky substance that hadn't yet been cleaned off. He did his best to control his expressions, and he could appreciate that the house was very cozy, he almost fell asleep just sitting there from how warm it was. When he and dumbledore had apparated just outside the front door of the worlds most unsturdy house, Draco had felt a rush of emotions overcome him, shame from what he was having to do, guilt for taking from a family that had less than he did, disgust at being in the same house as Ronald Weasley, and at the end of all that, a spark of gratitude that anyone would care enough to take him in. But then stout little Molly Weasley had come out the door with her arms wide open ready to take the son of her enemy into her embrace. This surprised Draco so fully that his knees buckled and he nearly passed out, as his vision cleared and he began to stand back up, (with the help of Mrs. Weasley) he heard a shrill voice "Good Lord Albus has this boy ever eaten once in his whole life?" He didn't want to say that the answer was closer to a no than a yes. "I did give him my last packet of sweets Dear Molly but no he hasn't eaten in quite some time, though i'm sure you are all too happy to get him well fed." Dumbledore was all too right about this, which is how Draco found himself sitting at a dining table in the Weasley's house at almost midnight, waiting for Molly to bring him a massive plate of food.
He toed off his trainers and slipped his button up off his shoulders. Generally he slept in his pants but Hermione had been so embarrassed the first time he had done that, so he wore t shirts when she was over for the night.
