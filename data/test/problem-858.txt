They stood staring at each other for a long moment which was only interrupted by Lisa Turpin announcing from a chair by the fire, ‘You are both disgustingly sappy. I think I just revisited my dinner.’
Sometimes he didn’t want to deal with the curious looks of the other eighth years, didn’t want to deal with the whispers and the questions – although it wasn’t so bad from the eighth years really. It seemed like, to a lot of them, this was just the continuation of the Draco/Harry relationship that had seen so many fights and insults and that, much like before the war, they were content to just ignore the stupid drama of it all and get on with things.
They called Kreacher to come and get the cabinet and after ordering him to take the cabinet out into the Forbidden Forest and release the boggart, they turned their attention to the next classroom. And the one after that, and the one after that. Hours and hours of tedious combing through classrooms and corridors, alcoves, and hidden rooms. They passed Hermione and Weasley at one point who were climbing a rarely used spiral staircase painstakingly sweeping every stone step for spells and jinxes and frequently came across the house elf who was restoring the castle’s connection to the armour, statues and portraits they’d already cleared of spells.
‘Give me back my wand, Death Eater, or my friends will make you regret it,’ the boy hissed all pride and attitude and Merlin, Draco could remember being like that.
It made Luna laugh to repeat his indignant, ‘I will not be your bi crisis!’
, Hermione said, ‘I just wish I knew what made Harry so sure that he’s changed.’
‘We’re paired up already,’ Slughorn said jovially, ‘Odd numbers, though, so I won’t say no to the three of you working together.’ Slughorn gave Harry a gentle push in the direction of the two Gryffindors, clearly expecting Harry to scramble eagerly toward them.
‘You really love him.’ It was a statement not a question. ‘How did that even happen?’
‘But…?’ Ginny joined Hermione in narrowing her eyes at him.
was a waste of perfectly good paper. She nodded her head approvingly at the article, though she didn’t even have to open her mouth to talk at length about the muggle justice system, and the importance of a fair and unbiased trial. Draco was well aware of her thoughts on the Wizarding World’s system of law. The fact the Wizengamot had agreed to hold proper trials was about the most she could ask for at this stage, he did not want to be around when she learned about the next plan Kingsley’s new administration was intending to put in place.
Luna frowned and Harry threw his wet towel at him. Draco batted it carelessly aside before he slipped back into the bathroom to fix his hair. A quick and complicated wiggle with his wand had his hair dry and falling perfectly into place. Harry’s idea of styling his hair involved roughly rubbing it with a towel and then raking his fingers through it. Draco ran his own fingers through Harry’s hair until he was satisfied the mess had become more artful than lazy and ignored the way Harry rolled his eyes.
Hermione smiled and then her lips turned down, her eyes widening in horror. ‘Oh. Oh dear. Ron has no idea, does he?’
‘I didn’t know that,’ Harry murmured, looking around the vault as though seeing it for the first time. ‘I don’t know anything about my family,’ he admitted in a mournful whisper.
‘Do you know the best part, Head Auror Robards?’ Harry asked conversationally. ‘All this power you’re feeling? That pounding in your heart that says you know exactly how easy it would be for me to do it? To make the Ministry burn? All that power belongs to Draco too.’
Even more confused, Draco had only been able to stare at his father, searching his face for any hint of what his father could possibly mean. Eventually he’d blurted out, ‘What?’
‘I fancy Draco.’
‘Er,’ the stallholder shifted uncomfortably and Harry realised it might not have been polite to just start inquiring about the man’s plans for educating his children out of the blue.
Weasley and Granger, on the other hand, took up a lot of Harry’s time. They always had. Draco had spent years watching the Golden Trio strut around Hogwarts as though they owned the place. Never one far from the other two (as long as you didn’t count Weasley’s imbecilic behaviour during fourth year or the ridiculous and petty spats of third year). It was only the fact they now took up a lot of each other’s time that they hadn’t noticed Harry was no longer as isolated as he’d been throughout the first six years at Hogwarts.
mean a lot to his father. ‘I don’t want you doing something because of my father.’
He could almost feel Draco roll his eyes; he didn’t need to turn to see him do it. He slowed his pace for a moment, waiting for Draco to step into place beside him before he lifted their joined hands and draped his arm across Draco’s shoulders until he could pull him close and press a kiss to his temple.
That he didn’t even have Draco Malfoy to –
His most vivid memory of the day after involved waking up angry and hurt and determined that if Harry didn’t want to be his friend, then there must be something wrong with the other boy, that those muggles he’d been raised by had done something to him and that he wasn’t worthy of being the friend of a Malfoy. After all, why shouldn’t he want to be known as Draco’s friend? Why shouldn’t he want to associate with the right sort of blood and family? There was clearly something wrong with him if he didn’t see what was right in front of him and so he’d climbed from bed and dressed for the day and he’d been exactly as cold and as cruel as his father had taught him to be because kindness did not get you what you wanted but money and fear and the knowledge of how to use it could.
‘She took away all the other outlets for students – clubs, games – and essentially locked us up in our common rooms unless we were in class or the library. Honestly, Granger, what did you think would happen if you locked up a bunch of hormonal teenagers?’
He felt Harry stiffen against him before he forced himself to relax, letting out a long breath, as if telling himself not to feel guilty for something he couldn’t change – another thing he’d been working on with his mind healer. ‘I got so used to only being able to tell them things, of it being the three of us against the world. I was told to tell nobody what I learned about Voldemort, that it was too important and dangerous for anyone else to know. Dumbledore insisted I could only trust Ron and Hermione with the information and I believed him.’
He’s not sure what makes today the day, whether it’s the weather or his mood or that his tea was just that touch better than normal, but when he steps into the floo in the Ministry Atrium he knows that tonight he’s going to tell Ginny. It’ll hurt; he knows that. Knows she’ll be angry too but now, finally, in a way he never thought he could be, he’s prepared for that hurt.
Even Longbottom had visited once, the first time in living memory a Longbottom had set foot in Malfoy Manor. Draco had made a point of noting down the date and making a thing of it just to be a prat, but Longbottom had taken the dramatics with good humour and a playful shrug that Draco feared would soon have them on a first name basis. The horror.
‘Are you telling me you and Draco have?’ Hermione attempted to counter and unfortunately failed.
It was that understanding that had him offering a soft, ‘Hello.’
He almost missed the moment when Draco’s words went from Latin to Parseltongue from one word to the next.
‘I’m sorry what?’ Hermione said, staring at him in bewilderment.
A perfectly ordinary evening with Draco, Harry and Luna (ft. brief Hermione and Astoria).
‘I don’t do couples counselling,’ she’d apparently felt the need to point out.
Ginny made a face at that but she too scuttled back out of the way of anything especially lethal.
Madam Pomfrey, satisfied neither of them were about to fall over dead or lose their magic, let it go. McGonagall had pursed her lips, raised her eyes to the ceiling and seemed to be wondering what on earth it was she had done to have deserved the two of them. She trusted Madam Pomfrey’s judgement, though, and she trusted Bill’s. Bill seemed to find the bond more of a stubborn puzzle to be solved than a fascination as Hermione did. Bill was intrigued but he was working under the assumption that nobody was dropping dead and, given Pomfrey’s use of the words “thriving” and “healing”, Bill didn’t seem to think it was anything more than a curious connection between Draco and Harry.
‘No idea,’ Harry replied with a grin. ‘I’m usually a bit preoccupied.’
‘I’ll hex you first.’
Hermione was next to leave the room (her turn to get the snacks) and the moment she was through the door Ron did cast a
Ron had hurt him in ways he’d have never expected from someone he thought of as his best friend and as the days had turned into weeks and those weeks had trailed into more than a month, Harry had been struck with a rather startling (good startling, not bad) realisation.
‘It’s not just mine,’ Harry added thoughtfully. ‘Sometimes I can feel the way your magic reaches out to mine.’
The warm feeling that had been blossoming in his chest since he’d received Harry’s note on Monday was back and larger than it had been before. It took great effort to keep his lips from twitching up into a smug smile. He watched the whole thing out of the corner of his eye as Slughorn welcomed Harry back with another vigorous shoulder slap and motioned him toward the side of the room where Granger and Weasley had set up their cauldron at the desk behind Draco.
Harry wanted to argue but he didn’t have a leg to stand on. If it wasn’t for Draco pointing out it was okay to spend his money on things for himself and not just school supplies that he needed, he’d still be sitting around in Dudley’s too-big cast-offs.
And he did. Mostly.
‘I don’t think I ever really thought about it that way,’ he murmured. He saw that they were both looking confused and added, ‘No, I know I still see things differently to Ron and sometimes he’ll make a comment about something that seems completely strange to me and Hermione, but I never really thought about the fact that he must think we’re both daft sometimes for not knowing what he’s talking about.’
‘I’ll answer any questions I can,’ Draco offered. ‘Whatever I can’t answer we’ll find out, okay?’
Harry’s whimpering softened but he didn’t drift back into an easy sleep as Draco would have preferred. His eyes snapped open and when he looked at Draco, they were watery with unshed tears.
‘Oh.’
He shared a look with Harry before they each took another step, wands at the ready. The hum of magic under Draco’s skin was alive and dancing and if he took the time to look closely, he’d have noticed the way power danced back and forth between them, even without contact. The ties binding them together were stronger than ever. Draco hoped that would keep Harry safe as they cautiously started across the open field.
‘I’m not ready to have this baby, Harry,’ she tells him, and she won’t meet his eyes, her words soft. ‘I can’t get rid of it either.’
‘And you know what you’re doing.’ It was a statement, not a question but Draco couldn’t treat it as such. Not if he wanted to end this nonsense of Granger dogging Harry’s every move and constantly second guessing his choices. Not if he finally wanted to be done fending off her lectures about redemption and how escaping his past as a Death Eater meant he really shouldn’t be using Dark magic.
Draco considered that. Considered how few students Hogwarts really had – even before the war broke out and people were afraid to return, the castle was filled with empty classrooms and corridors gathering dust. Well as much dust as the house-elves would allow at any rate. He’d never understood that, never understood why so much of the castle stood empty when –
Pansy nodded, tilting her own glass. ‘When did you figure it out?’
He found Harriet beneath a desk. The legs had collapsed under the weight of the stone that had been blasted into the room. If he’d only looked at her face, he might have thought her merely asleep, perhaps he’d have thought her perfectly unharmed. But she was stuck under a chunk of floor that had pressed her beneath one of the desks and her breathing was uneven, coming in pained gasps that sounded wet. Removing the desk seemed like a priority but he didn’t know what sort of damage lifting that sort of pressure would do.
Draco frowned at the way Hermione said “Slytherins”, but he nodded all the same. ‘They need to make amends and this is how they do it.
Draco nodded smugly but he was being perfectly honest when he said, ‘You should talk to Madam Pomfrey. She gave me a lot of exercises to do after Azkaban – and some back in third year – to strengthen certain muscles that’ll help you with your game.’
‘You’re thinking too loudly,’ Draco murmured, rolling over to snuggle into Harry and tuck his head under Harry’s chin.
Harry was feeling a bit useless, sitting around painting Draco’s nails and unable to help, but the books Draco and Bill had moved on to were written in Runic – the archaic kind that even Hermione struggled with. He was choosing to offer moral support by sitting with Draco now that he’d gotten all of his homework done and finished off the training Smith had set him, but he feared he was proving more distracting than anything what with all the fidgeting.
He didn’t quite succeed judging by Hermione’s tetchy noise and rolled eyes.
He’d gone about this whole thing hoping that he could help Harry learn about his family. He’d never imagined he’d be able to give Harry the chance to know his grandfather.
‘Mother has done a lot of research; she’s been in contact with a few people in France she knows, discussing their schools and education systems and spoken at length with Andromeda about her experiences with Dora. I think this is her way of making up for the past, for not stopping Father when she had the chance,’ he admitted.
Remus came on a quiet evening in February. Face sombre, eyes puffy with grief as he took Harry into McGonagall’s office and explained in a soft broken whisper that Sirius was gone. That the quiet solitude of Grimmauld, the horror of being trapped within the walls of his hated childhood home, had driven the darkness too deep and that he was gone. That Sirius had lost the light and his smiles and the ability to fight off the deep sadness the dementors created and that he had taken his own life.
That was one of those things Draco had found himself talking with Ginny about. She’d said, quite without resentment and apropos of nothing, that Draco was lucky to have the Harry he was now. She’d told him he was lucky he got to be with a version of the man who understood his own needs and wants and didn’t wrap his whole world around his two best friends until everyone else was pushed to the wayside.
Harry cried because he could see his own life in Draco’s. He could see years and years spent being abused and neglected at the Dursley’s. He could see summers locked in a room with bars on the window, and years of physical violence from Dudley that was overlooked by his aunt and uncle because they’d never liked him, because they’d never wanted him.
It was just before six, far too early for anyone else to be awake on a Monday, far too early for Draco to be awake, if he were honest, but he’d had a nightmare and then Harry had had one (possibly brought on by Draco’s) and there’d been no getting back to sleep. They’d decided on a run and while it probably hadn’t been the best decision – it was bloody fucking cold and dark outside – the fresh autumn air had been exactly the thing to clear their minds.
‘Fuck,’ Draco hissed somewhat apologetically. He didn’t like the idea of swearing in front of Molly Weasley any more than he liked the idea of swearing in front of his own mother. It was disrespectful, but the pain was pure agony and the word needed to be said. A lot of words needed to be said but he managed to hiss most of them out in French which had Fleur making a surprised (possibly impressed) squeak at the table where she and all the others were awkwardly stood hovering out of their chairs and staring at the scene in confusion.
Mustafa nodded. ‘You’ll be coordinating with us today.’
Harry started laughing into Draco’s shoulder, sticking his hand out from beneath the covers to grope about for his wand. When he didn’t find it, he flicked his hand impatiently and wandlessly (silently) summoned some socks. He disappeared under the covers, groping around a bit until he re-emerged, slightly breathless, with hair even messier than usual. Draco felt socked feet slip back between his own.
Draco scoffed. ‘We’d still have gotten detention and you’d have even more reason to have hated me when I left you alone to face Quirrell sucking down unicorn blood.’
No one who would visit him in Azkaban or care that he was there.
‘A healing charm?’ Mustafa repeated, confused.
The common room was empty when he came back and that saved him having to stop and talk to Granger or the Weasel. It meant he got to quietly slip back into bed beside Harry and drift off without any kind of interrogation. He did have to shuffle Athena a bit to make room. She’d decided in his absence to stretch her body as long as she could across the warm space he’d left.
‘I know what he did,’ the friend insisted. ‘Everyone knows what he did!’
‘Hermione.’
The expression on Harry’s face went from annoyance to anger in an instant and he took a threatening step toward the auror. ‘Take. Them. Off.’
‘I just don’t understand how I never saw it before,’ he whispered back.
‘Well, no.’
It was just a pity about the smell.
. What made him all the more newsworthy (apparently) was that so often these days, he was captured beside Harry and the wizarding world didn’t seem to know what to do with that.
‘Don’t worry,’ Draco assured the worried looking auror – honestly, he couldn’t have been more than twenty. ‘I’ll stop by the office tomorrow to give my statement.’ He held his hand out for Harry who took it and let Draco apparate them away.
‘I knew you were friends,’ she told them, which was obvious, Harry had point blank told her that. ‘And I suspected Draco wanted more but – oh Harry, you really are hopeless when it comes to this sort of thing, I honestly didn’t think you’d even noticed.’
‘No,’ he admitted. ‘I didn’t. not really. But you chose him over me.’
He knew Harry had. That Luna had. That Ginny had a unique understanding of Voldemort’s influence (and a strange understanding of Draco himself) that made accepting Draco’s place by Harry’s side much easier than most others would ever find it. He didn’t understand Neville’s acceptance or Hannah’s or the way all the younger students he tutored could see beyond his past when some days he didn’t think he’d ever see beyond it. He didn’t understand Andromeda letting him near Teddy or Molly and Arthur trusting that he loved Harry. He didn’t understand the respect he was earning at the Ministry or the people there who fought for his chance to work toward redemption.
It didn’t. It might have been true but there were things Harry was beginning to understand about their school quidditch matches that didn’t make him feel particularly generous to Madam Hooch. And weirdly made him respect the fact that Lucius had purchased seven Nimbus 2001s and not just given Draco one.
Hermione and Weasley both flinch at that, it being news to them. Harry didn’t look surprised at all which was all the confirmation Draco needed that he was right about the type of curse he’d been looking at.
‘You will, you know,’ Ron assured her. ‘You’re going to do amazing things. Make the world a better place.’
‘You don’t trust me.’ Draco said the words calmly, without censure. He hadn’t expected or believed otherwise, but the words still left an ache in his chest. He knew a month of tentative friendship wasn’t enough to overcome seven years of insults and bullying, not like it had with Harry or Luna, but he’d thought he was getting somewhere with Granger at the very least. She’d certainly seemed more understanding – or at least her understanding – of his place in Harry’s life.
Harry had never expected to cry over Malfoy, but he did that day and once those tears had dried up that was it. Sickened by what had occurred he turned his back on the Ministry, on Kingsley and the people who were trying to clean it up and he took comfort in Ginny and it was all wrong, but it was all either of them had in that moment and lost in their grief together they made choices that were all wrong and there were moments over the years when Harry would wonder about his life if he’d stuck around the Ministry. There were quiet moments when he would think about Malfoy and how trapped he was in a life he’d been forced into and although he never cried again there were times when he was sad.
She reared back like she’d been slapped, and he wanted to roll his eyes, but he could admit that had been a bit harsh. He hadn’t meant it to be, he didn’t blame her for going, but the simple truth was, she and Ron hadn’t been around and so much of what happened over those months happened because they weren’t. He hated to think what might have happened to Draco – to himself even – if he hadn’t gone down into those holding cells, if he hadn’t kept going back.
He snatched his hand away. Harry caught it and brought it to his chest with both hands. ‘I love you,’ he said, firmly. ‘I’d snog you in any alcove in this castle and all the broom closets. Don’t let yourself think about this. You’re shields are too good to get caught up in this kind of magic.’
It wasn’t just Bill, though. It was Molly and Arthur and George; it was Percy and Kingsley and the head auror. It was McGonagall and Madam Pomfrey; Andromeda Tonks and Hagrid spoke highly of the man he was becoming. It was so many people she trusted who now trusted Draco and all she could think was that those four months had been so important, how she’d missed so much, but she hadn’t really understood how much until Bill found the answer to the strange bond between them.
This didn’t seem to sit well with Weasley but Harry (not one for standing around) was showing remarkable restraint, especially when Draco knew he looked terrible and was swaying dangerously on his feet.
‘Are they still in Australia?’ he asked carefully.
‘Kinky,’ was Harry’s only response.
‘The only Defence teacher we had with any sort of qualifications was Remus,’ Hermione put in quietly.
Harry said he never forgot who Draco was and Hermione believed him.
They’d spoken with the mind healer again, after they’d had a good night’s rest and from all they’d discussed, Draco could agree that Weasley’s walking away had triggered long-held fears of abandonment and loneliness in Harry which had caused the nightmares and brought up all the things about the isolation in his past he hadn’t fully been able to deal with growing up.
‘Lumos,’ he murmured and a moment later held his wand aloft, casting a soft glow over the mess.
Confused, Harry asked, ‘Why would you need to undo it?’
‘Hello, Granger.’
His mind healer would be so proud.
Harry dropped back onto his pillow, snuggling deeper into the duvet. ‘She said it was beautiful, how tangled we are with each other.’
He hoped that wasn’t all this was.
The look seems to light a spark in Draco because caution is suddenly gone and in a blink he is the confident man he’s come to be. Not the arrogant git who strolled around Hogwarts as though he owned the place, not that one Ginny is familiar with, but the softer self-assured man Harry has gotten to know and love these last two years.
‘Eighteen,’ Harry contradicted. ‘Draco’s medi-spells are brilliant.’
He hadn’t exactly been planning to stop an attack but given how much notice the Ministry liked to give him before they came to take him out for a job, he’d gotten very good at improvising when it came to evidence collection. Although, the MLE was well behind the muggle police when it came to that sort of thing. He’d read a couple of books on the subject after Harry had sat him down in front of a television and showed him a sampling of what the muggles liked to watch. The muggles used sealed plastic and paper envelopes and little plastic numbered cards but in the wizarding world, MLE officers tended to use random scraps of paper, stared long enough to form a solid memory and then the lot got scooped into a box – charmed of course, just in case anything in there was spelled.
The hand he’d had clenched in a tight fist around the sheets (which didn’t help much as it caused a fresh wave of pain through his shoulder) relaxed long enough for her to grab hold and squeeze.
His words faltered briefly but he managed the rest of his speech. He had no idea how. In a single jerky moment he’d gone from being the confident and authoritative head auror to a fifteen year old boy who never thought he’d be as strong or powerful or brave as his famous friend.
‘You still own the house in Godric’s Hollow.’
‘The villa in Tuscany,’ Draco had whispered, remembering his father’s earlier words. ‘You both bet on when Harry and I would get together?’ he’d demanded incredulously.
‘Malfoy has Potter under some sort of spell,’ the Ravenclaw hurried to say. ‘Made him curse me behind my back.’
He wasn’t a healer, but he had been taught the same field medi-spells as Harry during one of his earlier assignments with the aurors. The first spell he cast told him removing the pressure would be a terrible idea but leaving her would be an even worse one. He wished he had an emergency med-evac portkey, but the Ministry only issued those to his auror handlers and while he thought Harry might have one somewhere, he doubted it was on his person. And Harry wasn’t exactly there with him, either.
Ron winced, hands nervously toying with the bottle of butterbeer before him. Neither of them had chosen alcohol for this date. Hermione wanted a clear head and she expected Ron did too.
Nine? Nine out of forty-two?’ Harry didn’t understand. ‘I don’t understand.’
Ron didn’t move. Harry was the one to get to his feet. ‘I’m – uh – I’m going to go back to looking for the rest of Draco’s present.’
They went back to playing after that. Every now and then Hermione would look up and pin Harry with a look that he steadfastly refused to acknowledge. Now was not the time to have it out about his relationship with Draco. He was on edge and could feel the edges of his temper threatening with every look she cast him. If she tried to talk to him now, he knew he’d blow up at her, possibly (probably) say things he’d regret, and he didn’t need that now. He needed to focus on Draco. Draco who was having a bad day and had been dragged off to who knew where to do Merlin knew what. Hopefully, not to get himself killed.
Her anger doesn’t last long, though, before she breaks down and starts to cry and he has no idea if he can, if he should, but he can’t stand to see her cry and so he gets up and wraps his arms around her. She fights him at first but its half-hearted and soon she’s openly sobbing onto his chest. He ignores the ache in his knees from the cold tiled floor and just holds her, knowing how much of this mess is his own making and knowing that he needs to ride this out with her.
When his feet next landed on solid ground he opened his eyes and found himself looking up at the burned-out shell of a seaside cottage. The image was blurred around the edges and he blinked his eyes a few times before his magic worked through the wards around the cottage and showed him that far from being a burned out shell, the cottage was well maintained, with a flourishing garden and gleaming windows that must have been spelled to protect them from the sea spray.
She nods slowly. ‘I stay at Jez’s some nights after practice so I don’t have to come home.’ The admission costs her, he can see that but in getting the words out, there’s an admission too and suddenly Ginny laughs because admitting to crashing at her teammate’s place after practice just so she doesn’t have to come home is a step toward admitting that she sees something wrong too.
‘Just smells like Hermione, mate,’ Harry offered with a teasing grin.
‘Fuck off,’ Harry couldn’t help but laugh. ‘You can shower on your own then.’
God, he can’t even remember the last time he and Ginny had sex, how could there be a baby?
‘Why didn’t you ask us to go with you?’ Granger questioned, lowering her own copy of the paper to look at Harry with a hurt expression.
He could see the man that Draco had helped emerge from the skinny ruined shell he’d been. The one that Pomfrey had spent hours and hours of her summer healing. He could see the man who had taken the friendship Luna had always offered and cherished it – and why should he not be proud of that? Why should he look in the mirror and be shamed for what he saw as Ron had tried to make him?
Oh, he suspected Granger had noticed Harry paying more attention, spending more time, with other people but he didn’t think she understood exactly what she was seeing, distracted as she was with her studies and her new relationship with the Weasel.
‘And she doesn’t wish you were dead?’ Harry sounded impressed rather than incredulous which was nice if a little bewildering. Mostly because Draco was just impressed by Hannah’s nature and not a little confused by it.
‘I don’t get it,’ Ron mumbled. ‘I was in Australia for four months and suddenly you’re friends with Slytherins?’
‘But no one knew.’ He thought that’s what it boiled down to. ‘Harry never saw any of the people in his life as his because it never occurred to him that they might care for him like that – also probably never occurred to him that there were adults who could and would help,’ he added thinking about all the times Harry could have reached out to Sirius or Lupin – or even his cousin Nymphadora. He thought about the times he had tried, and it had gotten him exactly nowhere. Draco shook his head. ‘Harry had you and Ron and that was about all he knew.’
‘Hogsmeade?’ Draco suggested.
‘Mother and I are turning the Manor into a primary school and a temporary home for magical children.’
Baffled, Hermione could only stare. Next to Luna’s bright skirt and tights, her unicorn print t-shirt, Malfoy stood tall and imposing in
Of course, it didn’t work out that way.
He wished today wasn’t one of the bad days. He wished he could have gone with Draco. Maybe if he’d taken the Ministry’s offer, maybe if he’d stayed away from Hogwarts and instead gone straight to the Aurors, he would be the one escorting Draco on this task. At least then he would be there to help, to step in and help shield Draco when the curses and wards became too much.
‘What are you doing?’ Harry questioned.
), there’d been such a strange and intangible feeling that if he just did this, if he just managed to succeed in his task that maybe there’d be a way out. That maybe succeeding would change it all and the future would be bright again, full of the freedoms his father had taught him they’d always been denied. Full of the power and prestige of being a pureblood shining in the face of those who would corrupt bloodlines and ruin magic.
Draco always had been somewhat obsessed with Harry Potter and if the stalking Harry had performed in sixth year was anything to go by (and they both knew it was), Harry had been just as obsessive about Draco in return. His stupid saving people complex, the very one that Dumbledore had once called “moral fibre” hadn’t let him stand by and watch as Draco was abused by Aurors.
Amused by the sheer delight on her face and the way Harry couldn’t seem to contain his laugh, Ron replied, flushing slightly, ‘You’re welcome.’
As long as he got grandchildren, of course. That part was nonnegotiable. Not that he or Harry minded, there would definitely be children in their future and given how lonely both of them had been as children, certainly more than one.
‘I’m well aware, thank you.’
‘Daddy!’ Astara cried again, her excitement visible.
Draco gave him a thoughtful look before he admitted, ‘I think you’ll need to wait for her to come to you about this.’
It was. It also turned out not to be the thing that had taken out Marigold, but they only learned that when the vine erupted again from her open chest and tried to eat Harry’s face and, in dodging out of its way, he triggered the actual curse which had knocked her down long enough for the wild healing spell to attack her. Draco caught that curse right as it was making aim for Harry’s thigh, his sensitivity to dark magic the only reason he caught it as it was colourless and soundless. The soft zing across his senses the only warning he got. He caught the curse on a shield, Harry killed the vine with a spell he’d gotten from Neville (and promised never to use – sorry Neville) and they were successfully able to take their first steps across the boundary.
I would love to hear your thoughts on this chapter, especially on Harry's own interpretation of his past and growth.
Harry, for some reason Ron couldn’t make sense of, seemed terribly amused. ‘Four kids. Two boys, two girls. Two at Hogwarts, two at home. You’ve got the two, yeah?’
Harry frowned. ‘Hermione would have loved a class like that.’
‘No,’ Harry agreed sadly. ‘I don’t envy Charlie and Marigold that choice.’
None of them had attempted to make excuses for Weasley’s behaviour. There couldn’t be any excuses for that, and even if there were, they’d all been so completely blindsided by it there wasn’t much chance they’d have managed anything coherent.
never...’
‘Why are there so many stairs?’ she moaned into the blankets as Ron rushed to make sure she was alright. ‘I’m fine,’ Ginny grumbled, shoving his hands away as he tried to roll her over to check. ‘Bloody hell, Ron, he didn’t actually kill me.’
He would not make that choice for Hermione, just as he hadn’t made it for Ginny who wanted to see the best in her brother and was happy to help him work through things so that he came out of this as a healthy well-adjusted man and not an arsehole. He would never stop Ginny from wanting to help Ron work through this. Although he did appreciate that Ginny was more than happy to jinx her brother when he started acting like a jerk – he thought that might have been half the reason Ginny was willing to talk with Ron while he sorted himself out.
‘Not yet,’ Harry answered. ‘We’re finishing the renovations on the Manor first. Then we’ll move in here when the school opens.’ He looked to Draco. ‘Does your mum still want to live here when we’re done?’
‘Yeah,’ Harry nodded, confirming what appeared to be Ron’s fears. ‘And oi, how come you never had to give the sex talk to the third years?’
Harry dropped his head against the table with a thump, just barely missing his soup. He was pathetic.
She hesitated, searching his eyes for any hint of deception and then, reached out and clasped his elbow. He grinned wickedly and she had a stomach lurching moment of fear that this was a terrible mistake before the apparition sucked her in and spat her out. She stumbled away from Malfoy and looked up, the dread that had only just started to form vanished when she found herself not in front of Malfoy Manor as she’d expected, but in front of a cosy looking house (it was  far too large to be described as a cottage although that was the feeling she got while looking at it).
The alcohol was dredging up a few memories he thought he’d forgotten, helped by the talk of their past and the things that had driven them together and apart.
So it was with considerable reluctance that he interrupted the pair when it was time for them to prepare to leave for the Burrow. Harry, still in his pyjamas, talked animatedly the whole way up the stairs, the portrait held in front of him as he took careful steps toward their bedroom. Draco kept a steady guiding hand on the small of his back, prepared to do some very fast moving should Harry trip.
Hermione frowned at him and then her shoulders drooped and all of the sudden she looked very tired. Her eyes were still red from crying just moments ago and there were bags under her eyes that suggested her last few days of holidays hadn’t been nearly as restful as they should have been. He didn’t think it was all because of NEWTs, Hermione had a lot going on and Draco wasn’t about to pry. They didn’t have that sort of relationship. It would be up to Harry to check in with her and make sure something else wasn’t bothering her.
‘Dinner?’
‘Draco!’ she snapped at him and followed it up with a sharp tirade in French.
‘It’s not a bad photo really,’ Draco mused, ‘I look fucking fit.’
He really was. It wasn’t something he thought he’d ever have been able to explain to his younger self and he was sure he’d never adequately explain it to Ron – even if he were inclined to try – but the man Draco was now was worth loving. He was worth fighting for. He was worth losing his oldest and first friend for.
As clearly as he could see Granger wanted to be angry, that she wanted to defend her actions, the quiet and calm way Harry asked her, Draco’s own careful questioning, caused her to think before she spoke. ‘I didn’t want them worrying about me,’ she eventually said, and it was clear she realised as she was saying it that her confession somewhat validated Draco’s argument.
The hex bounced harmlessly off Draco’s quickly erected shield and he rolled his eyes. A wordless flick of his wand quickly disarmed the boy and Draco reached out a casual hand to snatch the wand out of the air before anyone else could get a hold of it.
had gotten teary eyed.
Harry wasn’t the only one who’d told him that was ridiculous (which had gotten him a very knowing look from Draco over the hypocrisy of it) but none of them could change the way Charlie felt about missing out on what moments he could have had with Fred, and it hadn’t changed the way he wanted to start taking those moments with the family he had left. Even if that meant turning up at Christmas with all his belongings and announcing he was home to stay. Even if it meant taking a position in the Beast Division of Magical Creatures and being home for dinner with his parents every night until he found a place of his own.
Because that’s what it felt like, Harry could see that now. When he was back at Hogwarts, he didn’t have to think about the Dursley’s and just how horrible things were, but Ron and Hermione didn’t either. He shouldn’t be hurt or mad or even angry at them for not asking questions because they were just kids. But he was. He’d had time now, to think about things, to actually feel it all, and he was struggling to understand how he could have gone so many years with no one stepping in to help. With no one asking questions.
‘I don’t think I ever really thought about it,’ Harry answered slowly, clearly wondering at the question. ‘I can feel that,’ he added. ‘It doesn’t feel any different to when I use my own magic.’
Draco had slid one hand down Harry’s neck, massaging the tense muscles there with a thumb. ‘Harry,’ he’d said softly, ‘you know what’s kicked them off again. You know why they’re worse than normal right now.’
‘Did you have to fill out all that paperwork right now?’ Harry grumped because it had definitely not been necessary to fill out the application for a vault of his own (now that he was of age and not on the run) while Harry was stood in the corner of the foyer being a living breathing example of just why you shouldn’t break into a goblin-run bank. Well, you shouldn’t break into any bank – but there’d been extenuating circumstances!
Draco and Pansy reconnect over a bottle of Firewhiskey.
Later, while he and Draco were standing side-by-side in the bathroom preparing for bed, Harry asked, ‘Do you think it’s some sort of pureblood secret? This needing extra tutors to just get by?’
‘Of course, she can.’ He rolled his eyes.
Talking about their childhood was easy, giving their different experiences of those early years, of the hours spent catching brief glimpses of each other at society functions or the short hours of play in sprawling gardens. Even talking about the first few years at Hogwarts was easy enough, although hearing about some of the things he’d done from Pansy’s perspective certainly changed his own understanding of certain things.
Not anytime soon, that was for sure.
‘Send your patronus through,’ Mendenhall barked from behind Draco.
He bestowed on Harry a sharp look that somehow suggested he expected him to make Draco tell them when he was hurt. Harry gave him an incredulous look back that suggested he’d have a better chance resurrecting Voldemort and getting him to change his ways.
‘I shouldn’t.’
He opened his eyes but didn’t raise his head from where it was pillowed on his arms. He liked the feel of Draco’s heat where his arms pressed against Draco’s hip. It was a solid reminder he was alive. He saw Luna first, she was a mirror of Harry’s position on the other side of Draco, head pillowed on her arms, face turned toward him. Ginny was the one who had been stroking his hair.
‘No,’ Granger shook her head. She waved a hand between the two of them and made another strangled sound. At least her tears had dried up and she no longer looked like a watery and snotty disaster. Well, not as much of one. Helplessly she said, ‘Harry, I didn’t even know you were gay!’
Harry turned away then, couldn’t face the look on Ron’s face as he started to talk. He didn’t give an explanation, refused to justify his feelings, instead he said, softly – openly – with as much feeling as he could, ‘I love him.’
He woke up, not to Harry or Athena, but Hermione and Ginny.
Harry tentatively crouched down to get a good look at the rusted metal claws attempting to gnaw through Draco’s boot. ‘Fuck, yeah, okay.’
The only thing he could think to add was, ‘If the fields are heavily mined, I can only assume they’ve made use of witch bottles.’
‘He’s going to be okay,’ Ginny reminded him, choosing not to comment on the uncontrolled magic. He was grateful, it wasn’t like he could explain Draco’s theory that the absence of Voldemort’s soul was finally giving his magic room to stretch. ‘It’s going to take some time but he’ll be okay, remember that.’
‘Oh, shut up,’ Harry snapped sheepishly. ‘But seriously, Hermione, are you alright?’
‘I think I’m on some very good potions,’ he mused.
Both Harry and Draco wince at this because, honestly, Harry doesn’t know the answer to that. He’s pretty sure the obsession he had back then could never be called love but he’s also pretty sure his obsession wasn’t solely driven by his need to prove that Draco was a Death Eater.
Spending the night with Harry, seeing the way he was making a point to keep up with how things had been between them before Hogwarts started back up again, Draco was feeling secure in his relationship. He knew the place he had in Harry’s life and he wouldn’t be the one losing out if this turned into something ugly.
‘Don’t make it more than four?’ Draco repeated, shooting Harry a look.
Draco snorted. ‘I’d have loved to have seen that.’ He laughed with genuine delight. ‘Your face must have been hilarious.’
‘He did,’ Hermione replied. ‘Professor, how could this happen?’
It was the perfect kind of day they’d have taken advantage of back at the Manor during the summer. Draco didn’t much like being inside anymore and Luna was always happy to have a picnic and confuse the hell out of them talking about magical creatures and plants Harry still couldn’t be sure were real.
‘We crossed paths plenty of times when we were clearing the castle,’ Draco reminded them both. ‘She saw me work then.’
Into the stunned silence that followed Harry’s words Draco placed his mug carefully onto the tabletop and uttered, ‘Granger, I do hope you’re not averse to a little voyeurism.’ Then he shoved both hands into Harry’s hair, tugged his head toward him and thoroughly snogged him.
Draco tried to look annoyed, but it came off looking pleased, so he gave up on that idea and drew his wand to cast the first of many (many) spells for the day. ‘Close your eyes, focus on our connection and tell me if you notice anything.’
Harry put his arms around him and murmured reassurances over and over again. A soft litany of, ‘I’m okay, I’m okay, we’re okay.’
Hermione didn’t poke her head into the bathroom, but he saw her glance through the open door as she made her way to the sofa under the large window overlooking the lake. She had a strange expression on her face that Draco couldn’t interpret and given that he’d dealt with a full range of emotions from her in the last couple of hours he was quite happy to remain ignorant.
‘I thought they’d been destroyed,’ Andromeda murmured, from the sofa. His aunt and mother were leaning forward to get a look, so Draco eagerly held his hand out toward them for their inspection.
‘Honestly, the damage wasn’t all that bad, but he’s grounded for a week and we confiscated all of his potions equipment until Hogwarts.’
‘And for those of us without curse breaker training, Mister Malfoy?’ McGonagall asked of him sharply.
‘Come with me,’ Harry whispered, easing down until he was laying atop Draco and grinning against his lips when he felt Draco’s hands come to rest on his hips.
Much like real glitter, these obliviation markers were near impossible to completely get rid of and could be passed around. Although unlike the muggle counterpart they didn’t just move from person to person, they copied themselves until a neat little new spark latched onto the new person. It wasn’t an infallible system – the spark couldn’t travel down a telephone line – but if they covered a wide enough area, deniability and disbelief would do the rest.
Luna led the way down to breakfast. Harry was waylaid coming down the last staircase into the Entrance Hall by a group of fawning third years and Luna wasn’t much of a deterrent which was why an enterprising fourth year thought it a good time to hex him while his back was turned. Fortunately (for the fourth year) his aim was terrible. The hex skimmed over Draco’s shoulder, leaving an annoying ringing in his ear. He spun around, flicked his wrist to slip his wand down from its holster into his hand and locked eyes with the boy just in time to watch him, egged on by friends, fire another hex his way.
, but I think it’s easier to know he walked because he isn’t my whole world anymore.’
He’s been pulling away. He thought she had too. He’s started planning a whole other life, one that features Draco and warm Sunday mornings in the bedroom they’d share in Draco’s cottage. Merlin, when he told Draco about seeing a lawyer, about drawing up the divorce papers, they’d started talking about the family they’d have some day, about their options and what they’d like to do.
Harry rolled his eyes. ‘I don’t need to be under a spell to tell you not to do that again.’
And that was probably fair. Luna hadn’t been called to attend this meeting either but when he and Harry had emerged from their bathroom just thirty minutes before, Luna had been curled up on their couch munching on some toast and announced she planned to help. McGonagall had given her a disapproving look, but she hadn’t sent Luna (or Ginny) right back out again. They were both of age and perfectly capable of identifying and not springing a trap or setting off curses – more so than the fifth-year prefects in any case.
‘We’ll need a house elf to repair the armour,’ Harry realised and sent off another patronus, this one to the kitchens. ‘Are there more subjects that could be taught?’ Harry asked as he started to work his way along the portraits on one side of the corridor while Draco took the other.
She needed to hate Draco because if she didn’t then she needed to acknowledge that Draco was everything that Harry wanted and needed and that when she’d turned her back on her best friend, Draco had been there building him back up stronger and surer than he’d been before.
But she’d taken hold of him and swept him inside and she’d listened as he babbled and ranted and sobbed and apologised. Merlin, he’d apologised again and again for not helping Draco sooner, for not stopping Voldemort sooner, for a lot of things, most of which he still doesn’t remember.
‘Of course, not.’ Draco thought Harry was ridiculous for even suggesting it. ‘But I broke his nose, so I suppose we’re even.’ Draco grinned suddenly at an amusing thought. ‘I’ve broken two thirds of the Golden Trio’s noses.’ He turned to Hermione. ‘Want to let me make it a set?’
There was a moment, frozen in time where Harry and Draco could see the future stretching out before them perfectly. All the horror and the fear, the chaos and the death. Everything that had been and could be again if they didn’t play this right.
Robards couldn’t stop his mouth from falling open and it occurred to Harry how few people, even knowing he killed Voldemort, saw him as an actual threat.
‘Oh no, I meant that all those potions Madam Pomfrey has been making you take have done a good job.’
‘I didn’t think of that,’ he admitted.
He didn’t not like it when Harry snapped his name like that. Although, he preferred it when Harry would snap “Malfoy” like when they were younger and still thought they hated each other. It sent a pleasant shiver down his spine that was wholly inappropriate because he’d been a horrible human being and Harry had no reason to find that version of him in any way attractive or nice to be around.
And maybe it was that he was sore and tired and just feeling lonely and emotional, but when he finished breakfast and stood up to go back to his dormitory to collect the right books for his classes, he dropped a kiss on the top of Luna’s head and murmured around the sudden lump in his throat, ‘Don’t ever stop being you.’
Ron frowned down at the pages and Harry hoped he didn’t read any of the little captions which added the details (“so you can dress like the Chosen One!”) of what he was wearing and how much it cost. Knowing how much money Harry had spent on a decent pair of boots probably wasn’t something Ron needed to know. Sometimes
And it is an awful thought, a horrible one, but it doesn’t feel horrible. It feels like maybe it’s an answer, one they don’t necessarily have to discuss now but, also, they really do.
‘But he’s a boy!’ Carter sounded genuinely bewildered and if he’d been ten years older Harry would have said something else entirely but as he was dealing with a child, he kept his response age appropriate.
Harry’s mouth twisted into a grimace. ‘Yeah, it was a fucking mess.’
He’d found one. Of course, he’d found one. But his hands had come away slick with blood and there didn’t seem to be any way for Harry to stop the bleeding – he didn’t even know how he would begin – and his rudimentary knowledge of
also landed on the table, one knocked his knife to the floor with a clatter, the other only just missing Granger’s glass of juice. Draco watched Harry picking up his letter with an annoyed look as he unrolled his newspaper. He glanced at the front page, only giving the photo on the front of Kingsley in the Ministry’s atrium a brief look before Harry tossed his letter into his lap. Draco placed the paper down and picked up the letter. He only had to glance at the now broken seal before he laughed.
That didn’t mean he couldn’t reach out to her now and telling her about his relationship with Harry seemed as good a start as any. Crabbe and Goyle had never much cared who he was sleeping with or crushing on, he hadn’t much cared who they’d been crushing on either, but he’d done a lot of experimenting with Pansy (and Pansy and Blaise and Pansy and Daphne and that one time with Blaise and Theo – which wasn’t actually relevant to his thoughts but a nice memory all the same) and she’d been the one person he hadn’t managed to lie to about his infatuation with Harry Potter.
and the
Harry looked at him blankly. ‘What?’
‘Yeah,’ Harry answered Ron’s question first, ‘Got the identifying tattoo and everything.’
Taken aback by the praise, Draco couldn’t have held back the (small) proud smile if he’d tried, not that he wanted to try. ‘Thank you, sir.’
Draco glanced down at the shard sticking out of his shoulder, teeth clenched, and nodded. Madam Pomfrey had used her wand to vanish his t-shirt and the jumper he’d been wearing and now his naked arms and chest were on display for two-thirds of the Golden Trio. Draco could only lament the fact that he was in too much pain to appreciate the complete look of shock on their faces when they took in his Dark Mark, standing out in stark contrast to his pale skin. He’d have loved to appreciate their confusion over the tattoo that crept across his bicep and onto his chest.
Ron looked gobsmacked but any response he might have had was overridden by Hermione asking (while sounding genuinely perplexed), ‘Harry, when do you sleep?’
‘His death wasn’t your fault,’ Draco firmly reminded him, his voice soft but clear in the empty common room, leaving no chance to be misunderstood.
‘You just said you like her,’ Ron defended. ‘You had plans with her!’
Granger’s eyebrows shot up. ‘Library? You have a library?’
‘Not the money, you git,’ Harry laughed. He shook his head and said, in a much more serious tone, ‘Where do we start?’
But he’d cursed people and tortured them and nearly killed Katie and Ron. And Harry had nearly killed him, and it was all tangled up in her head and she just wished she understood, she just wished she knew exactly what he’d said and done that had made Harry want to get to know him, that had let Luna forgive him and led Ginny to form some sort of weird friendship with him.
Harry winked at her.
That was Harry’s fault. He should have talked to Ron sooner. He shouldn’t have let his worries and his fears over losing his best friend get in the way of being honest and open about his relationship with Draco.
Weasley snorted, turning around to glare at him. ‘You’re a coward Malfoy,’ he snapped. ‘You didn’t fight at all, you ran away.’
He shook his head, regretted it immediately when the world went white, but managed to croak down to her, ‘Blood curse. Waiting on Fleur.’
‘She still hates me,’ Draco told Harry, voice heavy with acceptance. ‘This has all been for you. It was just biding her time and waiting for me to show what I really am.’ He tried for a reassuring smile. ‘She loves you.’
He reached the line of Aurors, ignored the way Mendenhall swore and made a grab for him while another barked out an order for him to stop. He acted unconcerned by the spells the three remaining witches were firing back and simply walked ahead, pausing only to glance back over his shoulder and arch a brow at Harry.
He was dead asleep in the early hours of Thursday morning when a solid weight dropped onto the bed, startling him awake and dislodging Athena who made her displeasure known with a hiss before she fled for the couch. Groggy, half asleep and heart pounding in his chest, Draco reached for his wand only to stop when a soft voice mumbled a greeting into his pillow.
It wasn’t unsound advice and – frankly – Draco was astonished it had come from Harry. ‘That’s not terrible advice.’
Draco unabashedly watched Harry’s jumper rise, revealing smooth tanned skin and then turned to find Longbottom watching him in amusement.
This amused Harry terribly and he wondered rather, idly, how long Ron would ignore the obvious truth of his relationship with Draco if no one actually said the words.
McGonagall’s lips twitched in what might have been the beginnings of a smile, but she would not disparage her fellow teachers. ‘I think we can all agree that Sybil’s tenure here was dubious at best.’ Well, most of them.
‘All students must return to their common rooms immediately,’ she said. ‘Students must return to their common rooms immediately.’ As soon as she was finished speaking, she removed the charm from her throat and returned her stern gaze to Draco. ‘I need to meet with the other professors, I trust you won’t do anything stupid before Mrs Weasley arrives?’
‘Everything,’ slipped out before he could censure himself.
Pansy, perhaps for the first time ever, offered up a piece of wisdom he could actually respect. ‘You live your life exactly as you want to because you want to. Just because he didn’t belittle your choices and attempt to disown you for daring to be with another man – and Harry Potter to boot – doesn’t mean you have to feel like the choices you make are for him.’
I adore the next chapter, it's like 6000 words of pure Draco & Pansy. Look for it in two weeks time...which I have now realised is Christmas. Eh what the hell, not everyone celebrates Christmas, and by that point I can almost guarantee I'll need a break from my family.
She could pretend to still hate him all she wanted but it had been months and she couldn’t help but see the changes in him, couldn’t help acknowledging that the boy who fought in a war had become a man who had grown and learnt and was changed by his experiences.
‘I don’t resent you for going with Hermione,’ Harry began, ‘so don’t think that’s why I’m saying this but, mate, you weren’t here.’
It wasn’t that easy, Hermione knew that, but she found herself pushing to her feet and striding toward the stairs before she could second guess herself.
But sitting on the freezing cold street in a random muggle village wasn’t really the place for having deep thoughts about all the work Kingsley and the rest had ahead of them. Cleansing the Ministry of corruption was one thing, establishing new laws and regulations to prevent it happening again was another thing entirely and one he suspected would be hit with a lot more resistance than they’d so far received. And there’d been plenty of that. No one was happy to be fired from their position, certainly the members of the Wizengamot hadn’t been impressed to be given the boot. He didn’t imagine any of them would be impressed when they saw where those seats and votes would now be assigned.
‘Yes, yes I do.’
Harry huffed out a disgruntled, ‘Oh, it’s going to be one of those days, then?’ but he was already moving toward Draco and the edge of the ward as he spoke.
and he couldn’t help wondering about the boy in the cell who would never have the chance to make the right choices, who would never have the chance to teach Harry how to love and laugh and –
Draco felt rather smug. It must have shown on his face because Harry prodded him sharply and hissed a reprimand to which Draco only laughed and said, ‘Well I suppose we can’t all have our sexuality sorted at fourteen.’
). She didn’t have the capacity for forgiveness that Neville had or the memory of a nice boy who helped with Potions – Draco was more than a little dubious about this last one, especially when he’d been forced to torture Hannah and said more than a few cruel things about her friends and her house.
Draco ignored them all and met Harry in the middle of the newly cleared space. They shared a grin before both started to tug their robes over their heads. Draco neatly folded his and set them safely aside, leaving him in snug dark jeans, dragon hide boots and a Slytherin green V-necked t-shirt that did nothing to hide the Dark Mark on his left arm or the wand holster on his right. He knew from experience that the tips of the stag’s antlers showed at the neck of the t-shirt.
was smart enough to duck and Harry caught the attacking wizard in the side with a violet light that knocked him off his feet and into the lamp post behind them. Thick chains shot from the end of Harry’s wand to wrap tightly around the robed attacker and Draco turned away so he could search the street for the rest of the robed figures. But the street was quiet, no longer surging with the bodies of muggles trying to flee and any hope he had of finding the other two cloaked figures was gone with them.
The Carrow property.
(See the end of the chapter for
Four months should not have been enough to overcome the years of hate and hurt between them. It shouldn’t have been enough to turn loathing and spiteful words into soft smiles and tender exchanges. Harry should hate him for all he’d done and all he’d put him through. But he didn’t and Draco didn’t hate him either.
‘I know you don’t like it when people call him that.’ Ron shifted next to him, turning his body until his back was pressed against the armrest and Harry could feel his eyes burning into the side of his face.
Draco would have pointed out that it was a terrible explanation but they’d just had another row about his refusal to take some dreamless sleep so that they could both get some fucking sleep and he’d spectacularly lost (and was rather bitter about it, Harry would like to have pointed out) so they’d gone to Pansy for a change of scenery and possibly a buffer. It wasn’t like Draco would kill Harry – maim him maybe – but Salazar, he was bone tired and in the worst of moods and Draco was just as tired and in even worse a mood and while that had led to some deeply gratifying angry sex just that morning what Harry really (desperately) wanted, was some sleep.
Professor Joseph arrived just after the last student settled in and Draco observed the way some of the students straightened up in their seats (Granger amongst them) and how Joseph’s eyes trailed over the class. He saw it the moment the man realised Harry was there because he did a double take and then tried to recover without anyone being the wiser. It was far from a smooth movement and Draco chuckled under his breath.
He shuddered, pressing his thigh more firmly against Harry’s, only just resisting the urge to crumple against the solid weight of Harry’s shoulder and lose himself in the comfort of Harry’s embrace, never mind that they were in public, never mind that, to most of the students, their friendship was bizarre and wrong and made no sense given what they’d been like for the last seven years.
‘I have a lot of things to come to terms with,’ he said eventually.
Draco would never be the same. He could feel Azkaban leaving its cold cruel mark on his heart, etching helplessness into his very soul. Some days, he wondered why the dementors didn’t just take it. Why wouldn’t they put him out of his misery? It wasn’t as though he didn’t deserve it, not after all that he’d done.
wished he didn’t know, but they’d come with a decade of spell-refreshment from the company and weren’t likely to fall apart the first time he stepped in a potions spill.
‘Seven spells,’ he told Bill who nodded, looking down at a small notebook where he’d been making note of everything Harry had said. It was a muggle notebook and a cheap plastic ball point which amused Harry, but he’d never understood wizards who whipped parchment, ink and quill out of their pockets as though there wasn’t great risk of staining and awkward fumbling about as you tried to work out how to open the ink and dip your quill without spilling it everywhere.
When they’d told Luna, she’d nodded and said that sounded exactly like what she saw when she looked at them, magic entwined beautifully and their souls shining as one. Just how it was Luna could see that – and without aid of a spell or charm – Draco hadn’t worked out, but he was perfectly willing to just accept that it was something special to Luna because there was no one more special than Luna Lovegood and he would spend many days over the rest of his life making sure that she knew how much he appreciated and treasured her as though that could ever truly make up for the things he had done to her in the past.
‘It’s hardly my fault Harry is an idiot who couldn’t figure out he wanted to shag me and save me,’ Draco casually replied.
While Harry was studiously engaged in downplaying his sitting at the Slytherin table and trying to placate his friend, his other friend was studying Draco. Her eyes darted all over his face, trying to make something of his expression. He saw the way they darted down to his chest and realised she was thinking about the tattoo she’d seen. She frowned, looking back at his face and he knew he needed to change the arrogant and distant expression he was giving her. He softened his look slightly and watched in satisfaction as she darted a look once more at Harry before she looked to Luna and then she made her decision.
Mendenhall, stood a few feet to Harry’s other side, growled out the command, ‘Get this barrier down!’
‘You were a child,’ Draco reminded her, surprisingly gentle, because it really wasn’t her fault, and it wasn’t Harry’s. There was a lot of blame to be placed firmly on the Dursleys but plenty more on Dumbledore and Mrs Figg. Plenty of blame to be placed on anyone who didn’t offer Harry the safety and support he needed to have him even thinking he could reach out for help.
He’d been tired and sad, and he remembered telling Harry about his fantasy, about the wife or husband he’d have, about the kids – always more than one because he was an only child and he’d hated it. About the warm house he wanted. Even then he’d been able to admit the Manor would never be home again, not the way it once had been. The Dark Lord had ruined most of his childhood memories associated with those great sweeping halls and lush gardens.
‘I have no idea what that means,’ Harry informed him, with the kind of patience he’d had to develop listening to Draco explain things that he found fascinating and Harry very much did not.
Either they’d been incredibly lucky with their timing or – and honestly Draco thought this seemed (astonishingly) more likely – the
After another questioning glance at Harry for translation, Hermione sputtered. ‘That’s not true at all!’
‘Merlin, why are you here?’ he groaned. If he buried his face under a pillow, would they give up and go away?
Granger made a sound like an angry cat and snatched back the paper. ‘You let him paint runes on you in blood, Harry! I know you have no idea what those runes mean. He could have been doing anything.’
They wouldn’t see each other again for months.
This was why Harry had wanted to be alone. This was why he’d sent even Luna and Ginny away. He’d known what waking up in the Hospital Wing broken and bruised would do to Draco and he’d known that if there’d been people around, he’d have kept a lid on his emotions, swallowing them down until he couldn’t feel them anymore. Burying them behind masks and pretences until he pushed himself too hard and broke.
He nodded. ‘I’m going to need three days of sleep to recover,’ he admitted.
Wards built with magic that recognised the Dark Mark were always the easiest to dismantle. It might have been crafted from the Dark Arts but that sort of magic recognised him and was almost too happy to do his bidding. While Draco might not have the same fear of Dark Arts as most people, rather he had a healthy respect for what those spells could do, he didn’t always like the way they felt. The Dark Mark ward was oily.  When he’d described them to Harry once, he’d said it reminded him of Snape. Dark and unmoving but not something you could ever quite grasp the truth of. Draco thought the comparison was a bit unfair at the time, but it stuck with him now because the wards never reminded Draco of the Dark Lord. It had taken him a while to figure out why but once he had, he’d recognised the same problem in a lot of the Dark spells he was called on to break down.
‘About which part?’ Harry has to know although he could honestly say that he’s been serious about everything tonight he thinks a little clarification for Ginny’s sake is a good idea.
At the time, he’d been gripped with a sudden terror, horrified that he’d just blurted it out.
Draco wished she hadn’t. He nodded once before taking a healthy swallow of the whiskey. ‘Snapped his own wand,’ Draco informed her. ‘He’s living like a muggle somewhere down in Wales. He’s got a squib relative down there his family never talked about.’
‘Dumbledore did that?’
The admission startled her. Clearly Pansy hadn’t been expecting the truth. The old Draco certainly wouldn’t have admitted to such a failing. The old Draco wouldn’t have realised he didn’t have friends, wouldn’t have realised the relationships he cultivated out of manipulation and casual sex were anything less than proper bonds of friendship. He would never have realised how his own arrogance, his own desire to emulate his father, would limit his ability to trust the people around him, would limit his understanding of people and relationships until he had no one he could truly trust, no one he could turn to.
‘Ah.’ So, this was going to be that conversation. Honestly, he was impressed she’d waited as long as she had. Although he did suppose that between classes, homework, auror training and Draco, cornering him alone was a little hard to do these days.
‘Harry?’
Harry drew Draco back out of his sleepy musings with a quiet chuckle and the suggestion, ‘Maybe next year.’
He had to agree with her. There were things about sixth year he never wanted anyone to know. There were things he wished Harry didn’t know. But of course, Harry did. It really did seem as though every big, horrible moment of Draco’s life was one he could share with Harry.
‘My hands are cold too,’ Draco informed him but those he slipped up into Harry’s hair before he bent down to capture his lips. He regretted not taking his gloves off first, he did so love the feel of running his fingers through Harry’s soft hair.
Snape had once used the same technique on Harry. It had been much more effective.
Draco smirked. ‘Ah but you love me and that’s so much better.’
‘The last bit of Draco’s Christmas present,’ Harry answered honestly. With another sigh, he made for the first cabinet on the right and started opening drawers and poking about – with his wand (he was allowed to keep that now when he visited Gringotts) because he wasn’t an idiot. In theory, nothing in this vault could hurt him too badly but he was sure there were a few things in here that had blood protections on them, and Harry wasn’t sure how far his bond with Draco went when it came to ancient family curses.
Draco turned back around, his stomach twisting. Harry reached out and lay a hand on the portrait’s frame. Draco watched him send a pulse of magic into it, not much but enough that it tore through the spells on the frame. ‘Hello,’ he said softly. ‘Who’re you?’
Ron hadn’t looked angry or disgusted, he hadn’t looked much of anything accept uncomfortable and – if Harry chose to identify it – sad. But Harry wasn’t dealing with it. He wanted to get dry and dressed, put some paste on his burns and curl up around Draco and just sleep. He didn’t want to have some sort of emotional confrontation with Ron, he didn’t have it in him.
This time Harry rolled his eyes, though Draco hoped he was smart enough to realise the very good reason Draco hadn’t used that little trick Fleur had taught him. Sometimes it was best to let the DMLE think they were in control.
And, ah, his legs couldn’t hold him anymore and he slid, boneless, to the floor. There was a chunk of stone under his arse that was going to leave a bruise – maybe Harry would kiss it better?
‘I don’t know what I’m eating but it tastes incredible,’ Harry moaned when they were sitting around digging into the containers of rich and spicy food.
‘You’ve not lost the Weasleys,’ Draco reminded him.
Harry shrugged. ‘It hasn’t hit the papers yet because some of the charges being pinned on them are leaking confidential trial documents to the press, but it will. Draco got his second year of probation knocked off under the evidence that he’s serving both years of service to the Ministry concurrently. One of the conditions was that he sit and pass his exams.’
He hated that, if he thought about it, it wasn’t just one person. But that was something his mind healer could pick apart when he was finally in a place where he could discuss Dumbledore and Snape and even Sirius (and all the resentment and guilt bubbling inside him) without shutting down or trailing off into excuses and memories he hadn’t even begun to unpack and explore.
There were enough dramatics over Christmas dinner as it was.
Four-year-old Pansy had thought him a prince, sixteen-year-old Pansy had thought him a cruel bastard.
The whole thing took just moments. Hermione shrieked, Ron yelled and Narcissa Malfoy screamed. Not one of them seemed able to move, stunned by the unexpected turn of events.
It probably hadn’t even occurred to him that the plant might be lonely and just in need of some affection, either, though Draco thought he’d leave off pointing that out until they had an expert who’d checked.
Hands scrabbled, wands were grabbed, and they were both on their feet again. Draco was no longer aware of the crowd of students watching them. He didn’t see the way the sniggers and snide remarks about his chances had given way to gaping mouths and stunned silence. He was back in the empty ballroom at the Manor, back in the last fleeting month of the summer when he was trying to regain his strength and spent hours in the late afternoon working with Harry.
Merlin, even Harry – now – was doing everything he could to save Draco.
There was a sigh and Hermione turned to face the man side on. He seemed to be debating with himself before he made a resigned little growl and turned to face her. There was a shiny silver stud in one nostril, pastel pink hair in a stylish undercut that went a long way to showing off sharp cheekbones. He was still wearing black skinny jeans with artfully torn knees, he still had on a soft looking t-shirt and a nicely cut grey jacket that reached mid-thigh. He was definitely wearing what she honestly thought were a pair of well-worn 1460s and he was very definitely not a muggle or muggle born.
Now if his stag decided to trot over to Harry, they’d be having words.
‘You and Weasley have never had a date?’ Draco asked incredulously.
If this reaction had come from Weasley he’d have understood. Weasley’s hatred of him ran hotter and longer than even Harry’s but coming from Granger, it was different. It cast doubt, not only on Draco, but on Harry and the complete faith and trust he had in Draco. He honestly didn’t mind so much that Granger had her doubts about him, that was to be expected, but he was disappointed that she had so little faith in Harry. After all this time, shouldn’t she trust him explicitly?
Harry stepped up hurriedly to follow in Draco’s footsteps, pausing on the very edge of the ward (impressing a couple of the aurors with how easily he located its boundaries, Draco would later learn) as Draco paused
hate everything about me and she doesn’t. That’s what this is about,’ Draco explained softly. ‘She has every reason to hate me, she should hate me for all that I’ve done because I almost killed the man she loves and brought Greyback into the castle which nearly got Bill killed – or worse – but she doesn’t because you love me, and I’ve changed – I’m trying to change, and she doesn’t know how to deal with that.
Clearly, one of the reporters had arrived on scene earlier than the aurors had realised. The picture had perfectly captured the moment Harry had teasingly joked about it being kinky. They’d gotten Draco’s smirk clearly despite the grip he had on his wand with his teeth. They’d captured the wink too.
Molly was attempting to feed him a third slice of pudding when the growl had all of the hairs on the back of his neck standing to attention. It was a deep warning growl that spoke of danger, one he felt echoing deep within his chest rather than heard with his ears. He froze, cutting himself off in the middle of a protest about being full (so full) and, confused, he glanced at Harry. Sat beside him, Harry had frozen too. For just a moment Harry sat completely still and then Draco watched, baffled, as Harry raised his left arm. After a long beat of staring in bewilderment at his arm, he tugged the sleeve down and boggled at the tattoo of the large dog.
‘I want my best friend in my life, but I don’t need him,’ Harry softly confessed to the darkness. ‘I don’t want him in my life if he’s going to be disgusted and horrified that I choose to love you. I don’t want him in my life if my choice to love a man disgusts him.’
It was Mendenhall’s obvious and deep annoyance that tamped down Draco’s rage. Mendenhall’s expression spoke clearly to his own surprise. When the two had come to collect Draco, there’d been no fight being waged. He’d didn’t think it had been going for long either. As far as he could tell everyone was still accounted for, there were no obvious signs of spell damage or that tang of blood and magic in the air that had been burned into Draco after months of witnessing torture and death.
‘What are you thinking about?’
‘Fuck,’ he hissed. He searched around for some way to get out of the classroom, some way to help the other students and came up with the only response he could. He leant out over the gaping hole as far as he dared, one hand gripping tight to the jagged edge of the wall and peered up, trying to get a better angle as he cast another diagnostic spell.
It was nice to be able to walk around with Draco, openly holding his hand and not worry that someone was going to say something or do something. They’d been a lot more discreet about their relationship at the muggle market in the village near the Manor, neither of them wanting to chance that someone might say or do something that would end with either of them in handcuffs while some stupid bigoted muggle was bleeding on the pavement. That would definitely be a one-way ticket back to Azkaban for Draco, even if the aforementioned muggle had been in the wrong – and actually existed – and in spite of the staunch support Draco was slowly finding in Kingsley, Robards and Winthrop.
Draco was not the only one who took what the Inquisitorial Squad was and used it for payback for the many years that Slytherin had been forced to back down and roll over to make way for all the muggle loving fools that Dumbledore invited into the school.
Harry’s eyes flashed dangerously and before Draco could stop him, he was on his feet and rounding angrily on Hermione. ‘Is that true?’ he demanded.
Inside was just as much of a mess as he’d remembered. He pulled a face.
Draco shrugged. ‘I was planning to.’
‘I will never expect you to like me,’ he went on. ‘But please don’t hate me because you think you should. If that’s how you feel, of course you should hate me, but don’t let Voldemort win by continuing to hate me because you think it’s what you’re supposed to do. I have changed and I think you see that – I think you’ve been seeing that for a while and it has nothing to do with the bond between Harry and I – but if you haven’t, that’s for you to decide.
‘You have that meeting with McGonagall tomorrow at eight,’ Harry reminded him softly.
‘I’m going to take her up to bed.’ He offered the unnecessary explanation to the table. ‘Gin,’ he said, ‘grab her bag, please.’
One he did know the answer to, and one that had hurt to hear when the mind healer had brought it up, was his relationship with Hermione in those first months of school – and a lot of the time after that when they were friends.
‘Draco didn’t touch you,’ Harry told him hotly, and barely even noticed the heat that was pouring off him, obliterating the chill of the gloomy dungeon corridor and pressing oppressively down on his classmates like heat from a roaring fire – not Draco, though Harry was too distracted to notice the way the heat eddied around Draco, teasingly warm. ‘That pain you’re feeling across your back? The sharp hot burn screaming fire into your skin? That was me.’
‘That’s a brilliant idea, Draco.’
There were about a million different ways Harry had pictured the confrontation with Ron happening. Strangely enough, he’d never once considered that it might happen while he and Draco were covered in thick brown sludge and in desperate need of a shower. He wasn’t in the mood to talk, Draco wasn’t in the mood to entertain his least favourite Weasley, and honestly, all they wanted was a nice long hot shower and a warm bed.
Draco scoffed, he didn’t have a choice and they all knew it. He’d gotten off easy with three months in Azkaban and a month of house arrest. This was just the price he had to pay for his freedom. It wasn’t like it was a bad price, either, under other circumstances he would have quite enjoyed the work, but both McGonagall and Harry were right to be worried. If he were anyone else then being called on by the Ministry to offer his Dark Arts expertise following the clean up after the war would have been an honour, something he could have built a respectable career on.
Ginny released his shoulders and prodded him sharply. ‘You’re covered in blood and tears and it’s very unattractive. Draco would hate it.’
Draco grinned.
Harry chuckled at that and Hermione turned around to give them a warning glare. It didn’t have much of an impact. They went from talking in whispers about Luna to discussing potions and a bunch of random other things. They were so wrapped up in their conversation that they didn’t notice when Joseph trailed from his discussion of the shield charm to one about practical use in duels.
About the only consolation Harry had, was that Draco was at least with two aurors who took their job seriously and didn’t actively wish Draco harm. There’d been too much of that on the last one of these little tasks the Ministry had taken Draco on.
The boy wasn’t showing any signs of being shy now that he had his confirmation. He took Harry’s hand, looking positively delighted by such an adult exchange and fessed up his name like it was some sort of secret.
‘I hate that there were so many different choices I could have made.’
‘Not my finest look,’ Harry admitted, lifting the duvet for a quick peek.
‘Nope,’ Harry informed him. ‘Shove over a bit.’
The soft sound of paws racing toward them had them both falling silent and turning to face the stairs just as a large cat loped onto the landing and shifted to become a slightly out of breath McGonagall. Clutching at an apparent stitch in her side McGonagall strode toward them, lips pursed, eyes ablaze with fury.
‘Dad got really quiet and disappointed – it was horrible. Dad’s not supposed to be the one that gets all serious, that’s mum’s job, but she was so mad she couldn’t even speak to him. She just stuck his tongue to the roof of his mouth and told him she’d remove it again when he could think before he spoke or next time she’d do something worse.’
He didn’t seem to have realised Ron meant that literally and not in the “I haven’t seen you in so long” kind of way – which thank Merlin. That would be embarrassing. Ron was perfectly secure in himself – well he had been – but he didn’t need Harry thinking (after twenty years) he was ogling the bloke. ‘Almost twenty years, mate,’ Ron agreed. And then, because honestly, he had to say it otherwise he was never going to be able to have a proper conversation he just went ahead and said, ‘No, sorry, this is ridiculous – what the hell happened to you? You have muscles! And tattoos! I think you’re a good foot taller than when I last saw you.’
‘You look like shit,’ were the delightful words Pansy greeted them with when she’d opened the front door of her tiny London flat.
‘I’ll send word to the Ministry for a curse breaker,’ Winthrop said.
Draco stepped over the fallen body and stalked toward Harry. Harry met him halfway. They met, toe to toe, Draco just that touch taller, and for a moment they could only stare. And then they were reaching for each other and it was exactly the wrong time and place for a proper snog, but it was also the perfect moment.
‘I hate him, Hermione.’ He looked at her imploringly, but his voice was calm. He was dropping a simple fact not flaring with rage. ‘I can’t just forget everything he did. He nearly killed me!’
Inside the shop was warm and smelled amazing, Draco took a quick look at the menu but had zero idea what he was looking at. ‘I’m going next door,’ Draco said, indicating the off licence. ‘Order whatever you think I’ll eat.’
‘Out, Potter.’
Hence, the presence of Charlie and a witch from the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures.
But joint Christmas presents was another reason he really needed to talk to Ron.
Malfoy rolled his eyes, but he was grinning too. ‘I’m honestly a little proud.’
He was not. He glanced up and met the eyes of their dad who seemed to have been struck dumb by the idea that Harry Potter was taking the time to talk to his kids and learned that, apparently, Carter had been under the impression he was going to marry Ginny Weasley one of these days – and he said it just like that, as though he were parroting someone else’s words which made Harry laugh and had Kate elbowing her brother to shut him up.
gossip pages – with limited success) was something to be ashamed of.
The moment on the train that had set them on their path was a little clearer but what Draco never told anyone until a cold night in a cell in Azkaban was what his clearest memory of that day actually was. He was a little boy, looking to make his first proper friend and he had no idea how to do that, no idea how much acting like his father would set it all wrong and he’d been so unbelievably hurt. He’d been crushed that the first time he’d tried to do something on his own had been thrown back in his face in a humiliating moment in front of a blood traitor Weasley and that he’d shamed the Malfoy name in that moment, no matter how he’d scrambled to cover it in a sneer and scorn.
Draco’s whole body stiffened and his eyes flew to McGonagall taking new meaning from the look she’d given him earlier. She was deep in discussion with Ginny and Hagrid, tasking them with clearing the quidditch pitch and stands by the sound of it and, if she felt his gaze burning into her back, she didn’t acknowledge it.
How long would it take for people to start questioning Harry? How long before people wondered if he was under a spell or being blackmailed? The wizarding world had turned on Harry before, Draco could see it happening again, and all because now he was a real threat. All because the silly wannabe Death Eater had shown his true colours.
Draco stopped casting and glared at the ward, swearing in French as he did. Bill whistled sounding impressed but Charlie shifted restlessly and demanded, ‘Why isn’t it working?’
Soon enough Rose was on the train waving out the window and the train was leaving and so were the other parents, although the pink-haired man she’d come to stand next to lingered. His youngest daughter, her blonde hair flowing behind her as she ran, was chasing after the train. Hermione thought she saw a half a dozen heads pop out of window to wave to the girl, but she couldn’t make out any features.
It was the smile that got him. Draco rolled his eyes. ‘Ugh. Fine.’ He slid his wand back into the holster on his thigh, made sure with a glance that Harry had his wand out (just in case) and then he moved toward the cabinet with slow cautious steps.
Ginny snorts at this but she’s mad enough that she glares when Harry’s own lips twitch in a smile.
‘But not wearing pants!’ Draco shouted back.
‘We shall never speak of this,’ Draco said.
‘You shouldn’t touch this one either,’ Draco told him, choosing not to mock Harry for his minor concession. ‘Alright, Longbottom, what’s this about a girl?’
Draco hadn’t looked back; they all knew that was true. ‘I wanted to tell you in person before it gets out and people start accusing me of slipping him potions or blowing him for my freedom.’
He’d likely have to broach the topic with Bill and McGonagall. And wouldn’t that be a fun conversation?
Harry was there. His body a shield against the cruelty of Azkaban, his patronus a shield against the dementors. Finally, he eased into sleep, one not marred by terror and memories.
Draco grimaced. ‘Because if we fix this then Mother and I need to make allowances for at least triple the number of students we’d originally planned for at Burbage Hall.’
Kingsley’s office until he did something about it.’ He considered the truth of those words and then thought about where they were in their education at the moment and whether or not it was advisable to upset Hermione in the middle of her NEWTs. ‘Er, you are planning on telling her, right? We should tell her?’
‘I think she’s gone into shock,’ Malfoy advised.
Ron and Hermione had tried to ask him about his sudden lack of animosity toward Draco immediately after Potions that first day he’d been back. Harry had told them the truth when he said he and Draco had spoken over the summer about Hogwarts and that they were going to put the past behind them. Neither of them had seemed particularly inclined to believe him but then he’d asked about Australia and Hermione’s parents and they’d gotten (temporarily) distracted.
The words elicited a choked sound from Draco that he would never have wanted to make in front of Harry back then. ‘You were broken too.’
Hermione and Weasley approached them as they were leaving the Great Hall. Hermione looked serious, her hair tamed back in a very practical ponytail and she was wearing a Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes jumper which, given what he knew of George’s practical wear, seemed rather a good choice. Weasley looked serious and determined but he hadn’t made any clothing choices with curse breaking in mind.
He’d spend the rest of her life helping her to make up for her own mistakes and failings.
‘No,’ the fact it was Harry who disagreed surprised Granger. She looked betrayed. She was looking at Harry as though she couldn’t believe he’d ever say something so wretched in defence of a society that had only just come out the other side of a war. A war that had only gained momentum in the first place because of the wizarding world’s prejudices.
That was not…inaccurate. They hadn’t actually started the day with any plans. Through sheer force of will (and a dubious amount of sleep), Draco had managed to get on top of all his homework and with the application of some bribery (sex, lots of sex) he’d also managed to make sure Harry had done all of his, leaving them an entire weekend just to relax for the first time since the summer. The plan was to have a very leisurely breakfast and to simply spend the day together, possibly with Luna if she could get away from her Care of Magical Creatures project.
‘An interesting tactic, Mister Malfoy, I approve.’
‘I think it’s a time bubble.’
because I trust Draco with my life – I just don’t trust anyone with his.’
Pansy froze. Whether at his blunt admission or the open acknowledgment of the things he’d been through he didn’t know, but her hand tightened on her glass, the other spasmed into a fist on the sticky tabletop. There were plenty of ways she could respond, plenty of sharp words about how he deserved what he got or soft ones of sympathy.
‘Who’s not wrong?’ Ron asked, breaking away from the passage of his textbook that seemed to be causing more frowns than relief if the wrinkles in his brow were anything to go by.
Only some, of course, because Fleur studied it from a curse breaker’s perspective and wasn’t likely to do something as crazy as paint runes on her husband’s neck.
‘You can’t leave!’ the junior auror blurted out, sounding horrified that his suspect was up and planning to simply stroll away. Draco could sympathise, it was hardly going to look good on any upcoming evaluations. Of course, the fact that he’d stood by and watched over
Ron grinned. ‘Alright then, tell me how all this happened.’
Hence the nails. And observing Hermione.
He went to bed alone but woke up in a tangle of limbs and even though he was jinxed on his way to breakfast, he smacked the spell away with a shield charm, the simple spell not enough to bring down his mood.
Harry’s tone was thoughtful – hurt – but there was a sense of acceptance to it now that Draco was relieved to hear. He didn’t exactly mourn the loss of Weasley, but he was Harry’s oldest – and until this last week – best friend. Draco could be upset for Harry while also being thrilled not to have to deal with the Weasel. That didn’t mean he also hadn’t been expecting Harry to be more upset. Three nights of horrific nightmares notwithstanding, Harry had been remarkably calm about the actual departure of the Weasel.
Harry hated even the smallest bit of paperwork, he couldn’t imagine being chained to a desk day in and day out, it would drive him mental. Even as academically inclined as Draco was, he needed to be out and doing things – or at least locked away in a heavily warded room removing curses or making potions.
Harry would be missed too. Mrs Weasley was sure to start wondering where he had gotten to when the meeting broke up and everyone else came home but not Harry.
‘Very much,’ Draco assured him, looking down at the sleeping man with such a soft expression that even if he didn’t think Longbottom was a good man, he’d likely have earned some forgiveness.
That sounded like something his mind healer might have said – or perhaps Andromeda.
, but the spell failed and looking at the position of the sun in the sky was utterly pointless – it was hidden behind some very gloomy looking clouds and had been for days.
‘I thought about it, you know.’ Pansy spoke softly, as though admitting the words were a sign of failure, of weakness. ‘Giving up magic and hiding away in the muggle world.’
Draco laughed. He couldn’t help it. Harry glared at him, but Draco was unable to contain his mirth. When he got himself under control he said to Granger, ‘He’s gotten a lot better.’ He had, after all, made the first move.
The venomous words had hit his girlfriend especially hard.
Mendenhall grunted his agreement, expression suggesting his recollection of being blown back onto the lawn from a small version of that was enough thank you, he didn’t need to see one ten times larger.
‘Bill taught him some things as well,’ Ginny supplied, surprising Harry again. Ginny rolled her eyes. ‘If you’d been home at all over the summer you might have noticed,’ she reprimanded. ‘Bill said he asked the curse breakers to explain what they were doing when they came to clear the Manor.’
‘Both it is.’
Draco ignored him and turned to the goblin. ‘Right,’ he said. ‘We’re going to need the paperwork to place the Potter Trust Vault in trust for our children, we’ll need parchment for cataloguing and I’d like additional paperwork to get started on merging the Black, Malfoy and Potter vaults as well as the three Lestrange vaults and I want to declare them as the start-up capital for Burbage Hall – which I’m going to need paperwork for as well.’ Draco wrinkled his nose. ‘I think we’ll need to make some charitable donations too,’ he admitted. ‘But I refuse to just hand the Ministry money – they’ll waste it.’
‘How did we let it go so wrong?’ she murmurs, and her voice is stronger now. She’s still boiling mad, Harry’s not stupid enough not to see that, but she’s calmed down enough, is thinking about what he’s said in a way that says maybe, just maybe, she’s been having some of these thoughts too but just hasn’t the push needed to properly examine the thoughts.
Ron would come around, he always did, but Harry wasn’t going to stand around and wait for him this time. Draco understood that and he thought that Hermione might now too. At least, he thought that’s what all her weird and awkward words had been about. She’d stopped by the Manor to see him the day after Boxing Day, greeted him with a very long and rather tight hug and then told him it was okay to take as long as he needed to forgive Ron. He’d, luckily, been more bemused than annoyed by her words because it wasn’t as though he needed her permission to feel how he felt, but he understood the intention behind her words and that was what counted.
His impression of Harry Potter didn’t mesh with the boy who had spent all night on the floor beside his bed in a Ministry cell. True, his understanding of what made Harry tick was different than it had been before Voldemort forced him to take the Mark and find a way to sneak his Death Eaters into Hogwarts. The boy he’d thought Harry was would never have turned back in a room on fire to rescue him. (The boy Draco thought he once was would never have lied to his family about recognising Harry). But there was a huge difference between not being able to stand by and watch someone fall to a flaming death when you could do something, and sitting guard over someone you’d never even liked in the bowels of the Ministry.
Holding his hand wasn’t enough. Slowly, carefully, he slid Draco across the bed until he was far enough over that Harry could slide on beside him. He carefully kicked off his shoes – the ratty trainers Draco hated so much but Harry felt were too comfortable just to throw away – and eased onto the bed. He tried not to move too much, not wanting to bump Draco and risk hurting him. Eventually, he found the right spot, resting on his side with his chin on Draco’s shoulder and an arm draped low across Draco’s hips. He’d probably end up with the arm he tucked behind his head numb but it was worth it to be close enough not only to see the stuttering rise and fall of Draco’s chest but to feel it.
‘He asked me on a date,’ she admitted, sitting down at the Gryffindor table across from them at lunch as though she hadn’t been avoiding them for days. ‘A proper one.’
‘He’s already useful,’ Harry snapped, but the anger he’d been feeling had subsided somewhat in the face of Robards concern and his obvious regard (and respect) for Draco.
Behind him, Winthrop and Mendenhall cried out in alarm and Draco chanced a glance over his shoulder to see that the force of the ward coming down had blown them clear off their feet and back out onto the lawn. Harry remained unmoved. Feet planted firmly, wand raised to hold his shield in place. It was fascinating the way the blast flowed around him. His shield held, much like Winthrop and Mendenhall’s had but unlike them, the ward flowed around and over Harry, the bloodied runes on his neck doing their job.
Draco sniggered. He hadn’t lost his concentration though and the last of the wards came down, this one with a rather pretty opalescent shimmer that even the least sensitive of the aurors could see.
‘Not a chance.’
The smell of the sea threatened to drag him back to this morning’s nightmare and he had to swallow around a suddenly dry mouth. As he did, he became aware of the taste and feel of magic in the air. It wasn’t something he liked to think about, his new sensitivity to magic, he’d earned it the hard way through torture and pain and nothing good came of dwelling on it.
‘Aurora, please go meet Mrs Weasley in my office and escort her down.’
For most people, what they knew of Draco’s summer came from the
‘I didn’t,’ Longbottom agreed. ‘Harry loves you?’
Something to think about then. Something else to ask her about when he finally presented her with his finished proposal for the new wizarding primary school.
‘I hope he does,’ Hermione spoke softly with her eyes directed at her plate. ‘I still love him; I just don’t understand how he could say such hateful things about Harry. He was just so thoughtlessly cruel.’
McGonagall frowned at him, but she answered him all the same when Hermione sat up with interest. ‘I had to complete my mastery in transfiguration and take a number of independent courses on teaching.’
She’s sat at the kitchen table, eyes distant as she looks out the window, ignoring the mug of tea on the table in front of her. His newfound confidence doesn’t falter when he sits down across from her. Maybe he’s a cowered for not waiting until she looks at him, but he needs to say this now, needs to say the words he’s been avoiding for so damn long.
His little sound isn’t enough for her and she slams her fist on the table. ‘Oh? Fuck you Harry! I thought this was what you wanted. I thought, fuck, my Quidditch career is over but at least this’ll make Harry happy and you just – fuck you. How dare you fucking sit there and tell me you want a divorce!’
But who would he be without those horrible experiences? Who would Astoria be without everything she’d experienced?
Harry Potter was just as bad as everyone else.
‘She’s very curvy,’ Weasley lamely attempted to recover.
‘I’m still talking with the mind healer,’ he confirmed on the walk back up to the castle.
Draco had yet to point out he wasn’t sure subtext had really been his thing. He wasn’t especially subtle. There were plenty of people who had always known he’d fuck Harry Potter if he could. There were just less who knew of the times when he wanted more than a quick and dirty fuck. Well until now, obviously.
‘We’re going to have to sweep it,’ Draco told Harry who passed the news on to Mustafa.
‘We didn’t trigger this.’
‘Small wedding. Four children. Surrogate,’ he stated, not really to her but just aloud so he could hear himself say the words and remember that feeling of lying in bed with Harry before everything could sink down and drag him under.
Harry gave a rueful grin in response, hoping she would take his surliness as it not being the time. ‘He gets that from his mother. Narcissa tutored me a bit over the summer. She was a good teacher but I’m pretty sure I’m never going to be great at Potions.’
‘I never saw the appeal in either of them,’ he’d admitted. ‘I was never one for a Gryffindor fantasy – although Blaise and I did once catch a glimpse of you in the quidditch showers and I’m pretty sure that fuelled all of my fantasies for most of fifth year.’
He’d had moments of doubt, wondering whether Draco would be that happy to see anyone and Harry was just the only one willing to come, but those doubts never lasted long. Never lasted beyond the first words out of Draco’s mouth, even if those words were a scathing remark because Harry was always happy to snap something back.
Harry’s sobs rivalled Myrtle’s as he screamed for help. His voice rough and throat raw as he shouted and screamed and desperately tried to save the man he loved.
The two captured wizards weren’t so lucky. Still crouched in the road, Draco snapped a powerful stunner at the one trying to curse him and slapped a more traditional body bind on the other. As it wasn’t normally his job to capture dark wizards – or anyone for that matter – he didn’t have any of the portkeys aurors and members of the MLE often used to tag and transport suspects. He’d just have to hope his spells held until someone else came along to scoop them up.
Draco nodded, annoyed, though his annoyance probably had more to do with Harry’s admittedly half-arsed shoulder pat of commiseration.
Harry woke with a deep shuddering sob.
Harry studied her expression, trying to discern whether she was angry, hurt or amused – she seemed to be all three. ‘Are you mad?’ he ventured.
‘Thank you, Kreacher,’ Draco said with a fond smile.
‘Do you think he’d mind?’ she asked.
Ron’s eyebrows shot up. ‘They’re clearing out the Manor?’
All this devotion also had the delicious bonus of annoying Harry. It made allowing Kreacher to essentially worship him a delightful way to make Harry frown and grumble endearingly. And Draco did so love the way Harry looked when he was annoyed. Although it was probably a good thing that Granger was too upset to notice Kreacher’s behaviour. It was far too early in the day for a rendition of SPEW.
had made a point of highlighting the flaws in the Wizengamot and spoke of change on the horizon.
And he would have lost them, he knows that. If they’d come home to find him in bed with Draco Malfoy (Slytherin, Death Eater, absolute git) they’d have thought he was drugged or spelled and fought against the relationship until it tore them apart. Because Harry wouldn’t have left Draco, not then, not after months of getting to know him – the real him – and seeing the man Draco could always have been if not for the ways his father had pushed and shaped him. This Draco, so fresh out of Azkaban, needed Harry. And Harry needed him. They were healing each other and, Harry hated the thought, but at this moment in time – or even just two months ago when he’d returned to Hogwarts – Harry would choose Draco over his friends.
Harry’s stinging hex might have had a bit more power behind it than he’d intended when it slammed into the Ravenclaw’s back, judging by the pained scream he gave as his whole body jerked forward with the impact. Startled, the audience of NEWTs students drew back, some of them reaching for wands (some of them already had wands in hand) as they looked at Draco in alarm.
Hermione simply rolled her eyes but chose not to respond to that, rather she asked, ‘Do you think Voldemort’s curse on the Defence Against the Dark Arts position is responsible for the decline in student numbers?’
Slughorn made it all the way through his pre-potion instructions and jovial blathering before Harry made an appearance.
But after it all, after the threats and the fear and the lack of sleep and appetite, after he’d begun fading until he was nothing but a shell and so broken by what he was supposed to do, there was a moment in a bathroom with Harry Potter and Draco’s memory of that moment was worse, more distorted, than any other. He remembered crying. Had a vague idea that he’d attempted to cast an unforgiveable – knew that he had in fact – but there was a watery quality to the memory, a hazy wash of confusion and hurt and a strange moment of betrayal so sharp and deep that Draco didn’t understand it. That moment was blood and pain and a sort of helpless confusion because Harry (and he knew this now, Salazar, he knew, and he didn’t understand, and he was sorry) was good and light and the one meant to defeat the Dark Lord and probably the only one who could save Draco and his family from what was to come.
He didn’t understand the forgiveness the people he loved offered but he cherished it and he would spend the rest of his life trying to deserve it. He would spend the rest of his life loving and giving and striving to be even half the man Harry thought he was and could be. He’d spend the rest of his life listening to Luna’s stories and encouraging her adventures (and holding her when she cried because Astoria couldn’t return her feelings). He would spend the rest of his life answering George’s questions about Potions and Ginny’s endless demands for a training partner.
Hermione snorted and then asked, ‘Did Hogwarts even have divination before she came along?’
‘A warded dome?’ he suggested.
Draco didn’t know how to answer that because it wasn’t something he and Harry were in the right mind to monitor during prolonged contact. They hadn’t paid it any mind as they held hands or sat together and, in the middle of sex, they had much more interesting things to be thinking about than what exactly the small tattooed snitch was doing.
Hermione snorted and made grabby hand motions until he passed it over. He watched her read the blurb on the back and then thoughtfully start to page through the first couple of pages. Her eyebrows rocketed up when she realised that, against all expectations, it was well written – Harry could tell as he’d had the same thoughts. He could also see the moment she realised just how explicit some of the book was because she flushed a brilliant red, her eyes darting up to Harry knowingly.
They simply left him to it. Harry spent the rest of the morning sprawled on the carpet in front of the fire, chin on his folded arms as he talked with the portrait he’d propped against the side of the box. Draco brought him more tea at some point, but he was content to allow Harry time with his relative. Time to listen to stories about his own childhood that Fleamont had witnessed, stories about James and Lily, even about Sirius and Remus where he could remember them.
‘He went to Azkaban to visit you every single day.’ She’d leaned in closer to him then. ‘Do you know what dementors do to him?’
Harry crowded in close, one hand easing around Draco’s waist to tug him as close as possible while he batted Draco’s hand gently away with the other. He stretched up just a touch on his toes to place a soft lingering kiss on the tip of Draco’s nose.
He was pleasantly surprised when neither auror pulled out the rune covered shackles.
‘I don’t know,’ Hermione admitted, sounding rather small and defeated.
Shouldn’t have let his heart break at the sound of the vault door opening and closing.
Slowly, Harry nods. Softly he says, ‘You said you don’t want to raise a child right now, Ginny. You said you can’t just get rid of it. Draco and I want children, we’re going to need help.’
Harry’s choice of words startled Draco and he turned to look at his boyfriend, lowering his mug to the table. ‘What?’
‘I told you I died three days after the war ended,’ Harry pointed out wryly, highlighting the contradiction in his behaviour with casual amusement.
Luna pondered the question, chewing thoughtfully on a banana before she replied with a shrug. ‘He didn’t fight in the war.’
‘It really has,’ she agreed. And then, because she couldn’t help it, she blurted out, ‘You're gay?’
Draco wasted no time. ‘I’ve got Harriet under field stasis,’ he said. ‘It’s been nine minutes. I can’t find Xiu Mei, Archie, Delilah or Peter.’ He gave the mangled foot he could see a sharp look, directing Pomfrey’s gaze there. ‘I can’t be sure who that belongs to.’
(See the end of the chapter for
‘I best take advantage then,’ Draco chuckled. ‘Go on then, tell me how all those what-ifs would have led us right back here.’
It was the first Christmas Draco had ever had that he wasn’t forced to dress for breakfast or a party he didn’t want to attend. He and Harry crawled out of bed and after pulling on a dressing gown (both of them), pyjama bottoms (Harry) and slippers (both of them), they made their way downstairs to find his mother and Andromeda already up, though not dressed, and seated in the one room they’d bothered to properly refurnish.
Draco nodded. ‘There were four muggleborn students in our year – if you count Thomas,’ he paused to look at Harry, who shrugged. Even Dean didn’t seem to know where he fell on that scale. ‘Forty-two allegeable, nine sent letters.’
‘You “couldn’t let him go”?’ she demanded, when he failed to answer whatever unasked question she was attempting to throw at him with her look alone.
Any time of day was too early for that.
‘Harry visited Draco every day in Azkaban,’ Ginny answered promptly, not giving Harry time to dance around the point.
It was a low blow and Harry flinched as Draco’s words hit home.
Whatever worry Draco had had when Harry first returned to Hogwarts, that brief fear that he would ignore what had developed between them over the summer away from the prying eyes of his friends and their returned scrutiny, had vanished the moment Harry had teased and joked with him that day in Potions. Those worries and fears had vanished the moment he’d continued with the easy smiles and inside jokes, the small touches.
That had been an interesting conversation with his mother over the summer. They’d both come to the conclusion that the Malfoy name was just a name and that it would be “ill advised” of them to think that restoring the reputation of a name that neither of them really believed in anymore, could fix all of their problems. A few well-placed donations and whispers in some easily bought ears was not how he or his mother wanted to go about things. That was his father’s way and look how well that had turned out for him. He was the one rotting in a cell, he was the one who had brought the Malfoy name he’d so prided, to its knees.
That might have sounded like the old arrogant Draco if it didn’t hold so much truth. He did know too much. While the Hogwarts DADA professors had been an inconsistent mess in the past, Draco had studied the textbooks thoroughly after fourth year. Going back to learn everything he could from his old textbooks and raiding the library at the Manor. On top of that he’d had private lessons in Dark Arts for years and though he’d never taken them seriously until sixth year, he’d still learned a lot more than he’d realised, something that living with Voldemort and his Aunt Bella had driven home.
Harry’s smile dropped. ‘Been together almost twenty years now,’ Harry informed her.
Ron made a strangled noise which Harry ignored.
After they’d chewed in comfortable silence for a few minutes, Harry broached the topic of their meeting with McGonagall. He wanted to know what she’d had to say and what they were supposed to be doing about it.
‘Ever thought about getting a tattoo?’ he asked.
Fuck, where was Luna when he needed her?
The problem, it turned out, was that Neville had never been on a date before and that he was having serious doubts about why someone as nice and pretty as Rebecca Kemp would want to go out with him. Draco let Harry field that one because, well, Draco had no idea why anyone would want to go out with Longbottom – he certainly didn’t see any kind of appeal.
Harry laughed and gave her another hug. ‘Come sit down, we’ve got so much to catch up on. Draco can make tea.’
‘Malfoy cursed me,’ the Ravenclaw spat out. ‘He’ll be back in Azkaban where he belongs.’ He tried to straighten to his full height, despite the pain and turned slightly to face Harry as he finally reached them. ‘He’ll finally get what he deserves.’
‘It is dangerous,’ Draco conceded, acknowledging Granger’s words and not for the first time. ‘If you don’t know what you’re doing,’ he clarified. Again. Because he had already had this conversation with Granger before. Well, mostly. He’d been very firm on his stance and taken to distracting her with other things. The most successful of course, being the conversation about the loss of pureblood culture.
The bear trap purred.
‘What does that have to do with our bond?’ Harry wondered, shooting him an amused look when he breathed a sigh of relief as the castle doors closed behind them.
Her footfalls were quiet, she dropped into the booth across from them without warning with a soft, ‘Sweet fucking Salazar, it’s true.’
Draco might have argued with him but their weekend visit to Azkaban was still (unfortunately) fresh in his mind.
Draco interrupted him before he could get too worked up. ‘I don’t know,’ he answered. ‘I expect most of the ones born into magical families are being taught at home by their parents or tutors – I’ve heard there a few small schools dotted around the country, but they’re set up mostly for OWL and NEWT prep. I’ve got a meeting with McGonagall Sunday after we get back, she shared the numbers with me. She has some concerns about the system in place for choosing the students who get to come to Hogwarts.’
She was looking back at him with the same appraising look, eyes sweeping over him, assessing the cut of his own muggle clothes, his hair that was starting to darken away from the striking silver-blonde into a more natural looking, healthier blonde. He had a theory the change had something to do with his time in Azkaban and his own desire to no longer look like a younger version of his father. He suspected his magic was at play, but he liked the change, felt the darker blonde colour looked more natural and didn’t leave him feeling washed out and corpse-like as he had when he’d first been released.
conversation with his friends.
‘Like muggle physiotherapy,’ Hermione nodded, sounding impressed. ‘I didn’t even know Madam Pomfrey knew about that sort of thing. She certainly never did anything like that with Harry and you know he ended up in her care a lot.’
Draco sighed but didn’t bother to look away from his book as he replied softly, ‘She talked to Weasley and now she feels guilty about it.’
‘We just do,’ Luna replied, as though she could read Harry’s thoughts on this.
Of course, things couldn’t go as planned and so the small speech Draco had painstakingly prepared (and practiced at least once in front of Harry) was for nought because his father acted nothing like the father he’d been expecting. He wasn’t standing in a cell talking to a man full of airs and stiff manners so sharp that nothing could be gleaned of his true meaning. The stiff Malfoy mask they’d all learned to put on was nowhere to be seen in that moment. No, instead he’d gotten his dad, the one he’d so rarely seen in the last few years once the war really kicked off. Instead he’d found the man he’d loved and admired, the one he’d thought so deeply buried or even just a half-imagined memory from when he was a very young child.
Although, granted, he sincerely doubted either of them were ready for that last one. Thankfully, Hermione gave him an opening.
‘You want your wand back?’ Harry asked not waiting for a response before he offered the conditional (and perfectly reasonable), ‘You can have it back just as soon as you admit to McGonagall why Draco has it in the first place.’
Not even questioning Draco’s instructions, Harry stood where Draco pointed, faced the barrier he couldn’t see but could sense, and closed his eyes, blocking out all the noise of the curse breakers behind them and the pained grumbles of the dragon to see if he could hear what Draco wanted him to.
But he was trying. Ron was trying and he loved and adored (possibly worshipped) Hermione and had for years. Just because he and Ron weren’t currently speaking didn’t mean Hermione had to completely shut him out. She’d been mad at him – for good reason – but she loved him, and Harry wouldn’t begrudge her wanting to stand by him as he worked through the layers of insecurities and self-doubts – and the anger – that had him spouting off horrible words. Because the fact that he was trying was something that even Harry – who was still more inclined to dislike him – supported.
It had always been the three of them, could they survive the fallout of Ron and Hermione breaking up?
‘I can’t give her what she wants,’ he told Harry. Even to his own ears he sounded lost and unsure. He’d been undone by her ruthless demand for answers in a way he wasn’t expecting.
She hadn’t hexed him, instead, she’d sat down with him and asked for his help with a problem she was having with her DADA essay. He’d helped her because he couldn’t not and then they’d fallen into silence which had been excruciatingly uncomfortable for him but didn’t seem to bother her. When he’d finally just blurted out the question of why she was sitting with him – talking to him – she’d smiled at him with a soft expression.
That pronouncement was met with a heavy silence.
‘Not like that,’ Ron returned. ‘I wanted to hurt him for choosing a Death Eater over us.’
‘It felt like I stepped through a ghost,’ Harry explained.
Hermione looked at Draco as though seeing him properly for the first time. ‘He told you all of this?’
Such a nice change from the earlier months of his probation in which he’d frequently wound up in Madam Pomfrey’s care.
Harry shrugged. ‘We send them home.’
‘Yes,’ Mendenhall tersely replied.
‘Harry, are you read a
Hermione couldn’t have those things when she had memories of her own of pain and hurt and bullying. Of the arrogant prideful bigoted twat he’d once been and all the harm he’d caused her and people she loved.
This is one of this chapters I went back and entirely rewrote months after I'd initially finished it. It probably shows. But it fits better with where this story is going and I hope you agree. Also includes a sweet Draco&Luna moment and Ginny being awesome. Because she's Ginny.
Draco nodded and they fell silent as they started on their tasks, the only sound the soft crackle of the fire Kreacher had started before they’d returned and the scratch of Hermione’s quill on parchment.
He was tired and worried, and he didn’t want them to ask any of those things. He just wanted to be alone so he could hold Draco’s hand, so he could brush the hair from his eyes and trace the scars he’d left on his body with callused fingertips. He wanted to sit right in that chair until Draco woke, groggy and sore, and told him off for staring while he smiled happily with the knowledge that Harry had sat there with him, just waiting for him to come around.
Draco, sat beside him, shaking. ‘Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. We are never doing that again.’
They went back to trying to get homework done and Harry went back to his book only to be distracted minutes later by the way Hermione was trying to read over his shoulder. ‘What?’ he asked, lowering the book with his fingers between the pages to keep his place.
Ron made a face, expression sour. ‘No,’ he denied firmly, shaking his head in disbelief.
Granger snapped, ‘About everything!’ Granger’s own nightmare seemed to have been forgotten in face of her hurt (and not a little anger) that her best friend had hidden such a significant development from her. ‘How could you not tell us about this?’
Draco had once witnessed her take down a fox in the Manor gardens despite her small size and her relative youth. If Crookshanks was known to bring Granger mice and spiders, then Draco had genuine concerns he’d wake up one day to find a slaughtered sheep in his bed – or possibly a small child.
He took a deep breath and he said, a little sharper than he intended, ‘You weren’t here.’
Someone Harry Potter could love.
Draco gave him a fond look. ‘I hate that everything you just said sounds completely plausible to me.’
Granger was flushed a brilliant red when they broke apart and she didn’t seem to know where to put her eyes. ‘Um.’
Draco nodded, unconcerned. He made a point of looking studiously interested in what Joseph had to say after that, but it didn’t last long. He didn’t say anything of interest and after just two minutes, Draco dropped his head onto his arms and contemplated a nap. This had Harry sniggering again which drew Joseph’s attention once more.
‘I don’t think you and Ron ever realised just how much attention I paid to Draco,’ he started off slowly, thoughtfully. ‘I know things in sixth year were a bit of an eye opener for you, but didn’t it ever occur to you to wonder how I knew something was up? How I knew he was up to something that first day in Diagon Alley?’
‘We should have helped him,’ Hermione dismissed his words, voice thick. ‘He had to know that we would have helped him, it shouldn’t have mattered that we were just children.’
Ron sputtered. ‘What? Harry, why?’
He hated Voldemort for giving Draco his Mark. Hated the Ministry for seeing a boy who was forced to make the choices of a man and using those choices to unravel spells and curses they were afraid to let their well-trained curse breakers attempt. He wished he’d made Voldemort suffer in the end, wished the aberration of a man could have felt half as much of the pain and suffering that he inflicted on others.
‘I’m not sure there ever was a curse,’ Draco answered honestly. ‘And I don’t see how cursing a single position, even if there was a curse, could result in the placement of completely useless teachers in all the others – not you Headmistress, you were marvellous.’
Draco smiled ruefully, ‘Not as many as you’d think but enough. Hopefully.’
‘There were thirty-nine students in our year, Harry. Thirty-nine students in all of magical Britain attended Hogwarts.’
‘He made a lot of mistakes, Hermione, he admitted as much to me.’
Draco grinned. ‘It wasn’t like there was anything else to do. I have to hand it to Umbridge – horrible woman but she really paved the way for rampant sexual exploration.’
They sober at that.
When he’d reached the shimmery ward that served as a door to Draco’s cell he’d thought for a moment it was empty. There wasn’t much more than the dim glow of a weak lumos to provide light in there and certainly no window given how deep under London they were inside the Ministry. He remembered frowning, remembered squinting tired eyes into the gloom, and he remembered the first thing he saw wasn’t even Draco at all but the blood.
Draco wanted to tumble back onto his back and take a nap. He didn’t. He forced himself to stand gracefully, pretending not to notice his stiff knees or the burning ache in his arm, and turned to peer out onto the lawn where Mendenhall and Winthrop were struggling to their feet.
It wouldn’t be the first time. He dearly hoped it was the first time the idea had been brought about by a suit of armour charmed to incite lust.
‘Because we were worried about you, you prick.’ Ginny’s look was as sharp as her words. He did know her well enough to recognise that the sharpness covered genuine worry, however.
Neville was covered in dirt and looked as though he’d just spent the last few hours happily absorbed in the greenhouses. He smiled cheerfully at them all, not seeming to notice the subdued air in the room and made a beeline for the stairs and a quick shower.
Hermione beamed at Harry. ‘Thank you, Harry. At least some of you have enough sense to know I can defend myself.’
‘I didn’t,’ he answered truthfully. He hesitated for a moment and then determinedly went on, hoping Ron never held this conversation against him. ‘Me and Gin, it wasn’t about timing,’ he admitted. ‘It was about needing that connection to block out the grief. I don’t regret it, but I do wish it hadn’t happened that way.’
Disarming the fourth year (a Hufflepuff Draco didn’t know) set his friends off and suddenly Draco found himself on the wrong end of six different wands, all held by angry looking midgets. Merlin, had he ever been so small? He’d gone through another growth spurt after Azkaban (thanks primarily to Pomfrey’s quick thinking) and he knew he was tall now, but he certainly hadn’t been tall in fourth year. But had he been that small?
‘What?’ Harry snapped. ‘No, she shouldn’t.’
Draco frowned, lifting his head off Harry’s shoulder to stare at him through the dark. ‘You know that it’s okay to walk away from him for that, yes? That it’s not giving up or being selfish to turn away from someone who used words to purposefully hurt you?’
Draco shuffled forward, threading an arm around Harry’s until he was pressed close, chin resting on Harry’s shoulder to peer down into the box. ‘This is Fleamont Potter,’ he introduced. ‘He’s you grandfather.’ He pressed a kiss to Harry’s shoulder before saying, ‘Mister Potter, may I introduce you to your grandson Harry.’
He’d only managed to look up because of the kindness in her voice, even though it was filled with hesitation. ‘Does he make you happy?’
Harry was lying beside him, on his side facing Draco and, if he really tried, Draco thought he could see Harry’s frown through the gloom. This wasn’t going to be one of those times when he could tell him to shut it and wait until morning then.
Luna led the way to the Gryffindor table and Draco broke off to the Slytherin table. He loved Luna dearly but not enough to follow her to that particular table. He wasn’t even sure he’d brave it for Harry, and he was still a week away from returning to Hogwarts.
‘Norwegian?’
She laughed this time. ‘What are you going to do with all that extra money?’
‘Our kids are never going to know this Hogwarts,’ Harry went on, still sounding sad but now there was an edge of determination to his words.
Pansy’s delicate eyebrows shot up and she looked Harry over with a shrewd expression. ‘Enough to ask for this meeting,’ Pansy answered. ‘Do you care about Draco?’
They’d hardly expected Granger to be awake, hardly expected anyone to be, but it worked in their favour. There was no one around to witness Granger’s breakdown. He didn’t much care who caught him snogging Harry, but he thought both Harry and Granger would prefer no one had the chance to see her tears and obvious pain.
‘I’d have married a lovely pureblood girl who’d provide me with the son my father wants,’ Draco played along.
Luna and Draco shared a look, a silent battle over who would step in if Harry’s temper got the better of him. Draco lost. Luna’s pointed look very clearly stated that he was Draco’s problem. He dearly hoped he wouldn’t have to intervene; it was a lot more fun watching Harry tear people to shreds on his behalf.
She envied Ron. She envied the way he could be cruel and mean and hate Draco. She envied that he could say all the things she wanted to say, all the things she thought she should say but she didn’t understand how he could attack Harry’s sexuality just because he didn’t like who Harry loved.
He would be the second to admit he was slow on the uptake – Ginny being the first, though closely tied with Draco if he were being honest.
of August and disappeared on some auror mission, Draco truly felt at ease.
She smiled a watery smile at him, which was better than the slap he would have expected. ‘For making this seem like a better option for my parents.’ She paused. ‘Also, the strangely encouraging support of my future career.’
He found nothing.
Intrigued, Harry asked about how the tradition came about and the sort of things the children were taught which spiralled into a discussion on the sort of subjects children should be learning in schools and honestly, it was just nice to be the one having an animated conversation with a stallholder instead of standing aside trying to pretend he had any idea what was being discussed.
She thought she’d taken him by surprise with the sharpness of her tone, but he didn’t prevent her from coming in. He didn’t prevent her from witnessing Draco struggling to hastily zip the fly of his jeans, but she barely even noticed.
The lift jerked to a stop on one of the lower levels – the same one that housed the holding cells where he’d first found Draco. Instead of turning left when he exited, Harry turned right toward the training rooms. He hadn’t been down here in two weeks and in spite of the display of power he’d just pulled off upstairs he had no doubt he was about to get his arse kicked down here.
But it doesn’t change anything. It doesn’t. He has never loved anyone as completely, passionately, maddeningly, as he does Draco, and if he lied right then in the face of Ginny’s news then he’d only be condemning three – no four, there was a baby now – people to a life of misery and regret.
Harry seemed to be feeling the same way.
Harry stopped dead. ‘The
Draco and Ginny might mock him for it, but it had been seven months (more or less) and he was perfectly willing to admit that, for him, it was Draco and it would always be Draco.
Draco summoned a patronus and sent it off in the direction of the sparks with a request for help. It didn’t get very far. His wolf bounded across the snow leaving no pawprints behind and then collided with something Draco couldn’t see (or sense) and simply dissolved into silvery whisps. It was nothing like the way a patronus normally vanished as it darted off to deliver its message. It didn’t leap seemingly into space and time, swallowed by a veil normally only breached during apparation. No, his wolf collided with a barrier and the magic splashed against it before it vanished.
‘Oh Merlin,’ Harry breathed, burying his face into Draco’s chest hoping that the familiar warmth would force the lingering hooks of his nightmares to stay they hell out of his head.
And so he’d sat beside Draco, talked with him, laughed with him and it had been just as easy as it had been in those later summer months once they’d gotten to know each other, once Harry’s temper stopped getting the better of him (mostly) and once Draco had been stripped of the pureblood rhetoric that made him such a git. Although, honestly, he was still a bit of a git.
‘I know that,’ Harry assured her, ‘and I will tell him.’
He didn’t know how to explain to them how hard his summers had been because even after all the shouting and the hurt and anger of the summer before his fifth year, he didn’t think they really understood. He didn’t know how to put into words the things he felt and experienced in those quiet dark moments in Privet Drive when he’d never known for sure if he was going back to Hogwarts. In those dark terrifying moments on the edge of dreams when he never quite knew if any of it was real.
‘We had a housekeeper when I was a child,’ she also explained. ‘One summer I spent a week with her learning all the household charms that a good pureblood wife should know.’
He hoped it helped Ron.
Words muffled from where he’d pressed his face into the crook of Draco’s neck, Harry murmured, ‘It was Sirius.’
‘I think that was the first time I ever really understood you might have a thing for boys as well,’ Pansy said of the Yule Ball in fourth year.
Harry laughed again and the sound was carefree and warm, and she didn’t know that she’d ever heard Harry laugh like that before.
Which Harry knew was as good as admitting to all those years he’d filled his wank bank with images of Harry and so Harry fell asleep with a sweet smile on his lips and no more worries about Hermione and her strange avoidance because there wasn’t much he could do but wait her out and, in the end, it was just the next day when Hermione, as Draco predicted, did come to Harry.
Sprawled as he was, half on and half off the bed, Draco could only snigger a laugh as Harry stumbled off the bed, hopping naked around the room as he tried to stretch out the cramp in his calf. He deserved the pillow to his face, he’d admit, but what else was he supposed to do? At least they’d both gotten off before the cramp had set Harry stumbling around in pain.
The way Bill told it, Molly had looked triumphant after that last bit and Arthur had been pinching his nose, glasses held in one hand. By all accounts, Molly had then calmly said, ‘Well as long as you’re looking, that’s all I ask.’
‘Bloody hell,’ he grumbled, ‘I bet his wife is really pretty.’
She stares at him incomprehensively.
Harry glared at him.
Harry didn’t like it, but he suspected Draco was right – he usually was, and he knew it too. So, Harry went back to painting Draco’s nails the midnight black Luna had left lying about and lost himself in wondering if he could get Hannah to add in some tiny little artwork like he’d seen on her own nails just last week. It would be pretty cool to have a golden snitch zooming from nail to nail like the one on Draco’s back did when it felt like trading canvases and skipping across Harry’s skin.
Harry, scrambling back into his jeans, paused in his search for his shirt, to glance over at Draco where he was sprawled naked on the bed, hands folded behind his head, eyes lazy as they watched Harry scramble about for his clothes.
At which point Lisa, seeking revenge no doubt for all those sleepless nights, piped up from an armchair to say, ‘Ron hit him first.’
‘I may not have realised it without the unfortunate need to fix the Vanishing Cabinet and all the trauma that ensued, but I do find it fascinating.’
‘I’m fine,’ he replied curtly.
It was hard. People died. But Harry played the role. He faked confusion and anger and a whole host of other things. He’d gotten very good at lying over the years. Very good at pretending and hiding. He’d managed to conceal an affair for five years. Managed to hide where he was really getting most of his insight into Voldemort’s activities from for just as many.
‘I know,’ he says, and he does. ‘I love you too.’
He’d been wrong to think that the admiration he gained from such talk was important at all. That the other students in Slytherin who had their own parents influencing them, could – or even should – be a factor in choices he made. His arrogance and the certainty he’d experienced early sixth year, the confidence of the Draco who had stomped on Harry’s face and broken his nose – the one who had gloated over his exploits in the common room – that certainty (that Draco) hadn’t lasted long once the truth of his task and Voldemort’s ruthlessness reached him through the arrogance of his youth.
The fault for Dumbledore’s death lay at Voldemort’s feet. At Dumbledore’s own, at Snape’s for being willing to enter into that bargain, but it did not lie at Draco’s.
Draco grimaced, that was going to be a long and tedious task. Especially given the way the stairs moved around.
At least when he next woke up he was looking at Harry and not Weasley.
Harry shrugged, fiddling with the leather chord Draco had tied around his wrist while he’d been asleep. ‘I had plenty of gold to get me through the summer and the goblins love Draco. I’m pretty sure they’d let him have all my money and all my vaults if he asked them nicely.’
Their calm interaction stumped Weasley and he stood gaping at his girlfriend, words forgotten. Eventually he managed a garbled, ‘Hermione!’
Draco nodded and offered a curt, ‘Yes.’
Hermione gave him an unimpressed look. ‘If you’d said those things to me, I’d have chosen him over you in that moment – purely out of spite.’
So maybe there was a part of Harry that would happily let Draco kill Ron. But it was only a small part and it was fuelled mostly by the hurt and confusion because they’d all been expecting Ron to be angry. They’d honestly been expecting him to be furious that Harry was with Draco but none of them had expected the vicious onslaught of homophobic slurs. All Harry had wanted was a chance to explain how it had happened, how much Draco had shown that he’d changed not just said pretty words – hadn’t Ron seen for himself how much Draco had changed? – but all he’d gotten was anger and vitriol until Neville had stepped in and Harry had fled.
‘Do you think Hermione will come around?’ Draco wasn’t sure what made him ask the question. Wading through Merlin knew how many spells and curses in a snow-covered field was hardly the place to ask such a loaded question, but it had been days now since the confrontation with Hermione. Days of her avoiding them – avoiding everyone, Draco suspected, and while he knew that, in the end, it would be entirely up to Hermione to decide if she wanted Harry in her life (knowing he came as a package deal), Draco couldn’t help wondering if he even wanted her to come around.
Pansy smiled at him softly. ‘We could take this slow, spend weeks and months dancing around all the shitty things you did, all the ways you hurt me and how we just gave up on you, but that’s not really my style. We’re going to order lunch, we’re going to drink this entire bottle, and we’re going to sit in this shitty booth until we’ve sorted this out.’
‘Healer Yang thinks it’ll be good for me,’ Ron admitted. ‘Doing the training without Harry. He thinks it will give me the chance to be my own person and not feel like I’m stuck in Harry’s shadow.’
‘What’s this?’ Slughorn chortled cheerfully, as he opened the classroom door. His happy expression slipped when he caught sight of Harry crowding the Ravenclaw – Chris – against the wall and the uneasy way all his classmates were eyeing Draco. ‘Oho,’ he sputtered. ‘What is going on here boys?’
‘Two questions then,’ Harry murmured, eyes still roving over the other pairs as he tried to search out a visual clue to what was happening. ‘First being what this is and how it was triggered.’
Harry smiled wider, offering a cheeky wink.
She didn’t know how to set their relationship back onto the right path when she wasn’t sure it had been on it in the first place. Had she even been in the right headspace to take their relationship from friendship to romance? Had she let her fear of the war and her feelings of loss about her parents drive her to something she wasn’t ready for? She’d spent
will ruin things.’
Draco thought that was rather Harry’s point with all this talk about finally letting people in, but it didn’t mean he couldn’t help drive it home. Despite all the history between them, the rest of the Weasley family had been very supportive of Harry and Draco. They hadn’t questioned Harry’s choices (they might have questioned his behaviour but that was mostly because no sane person visited Azkaban willingly every day) and they’d not tried to change his mind or make him feel bad or stupid for wanting to get to know Draco.
‘Like what?’ Hermione asked.
She bundled Harry through a door into what he would later realise was her own bedroom, but he was numb as she pushed him gently back onto her bed and then he blinked and Draco was there, climbing up behind him and arms were wrapping around him and Harry simply broke. His whole body shook with sobs and he –
Draco wasn’t sure he believed Bill then and he was even less sure now after a letter from his mother expressing how much she enjoyed getting to know Harry’s chosen family. She’d delighted in telling him about their discussion and how Molly had spoken rather highly of Draco’s role in improving Harry’s mood and his grief. There’d been no mention of the fact that Molly had killed Aunt Bella, no mention of any topics at all that might have put strain on their relationship.
There was only one person that stag could possibly represent, and it sent her mind spinning. It sent Ron’s spinning too and neither of them had an explanation for what they’d seen and McGonagall’s fury as she asked them for details in her office had been another startling discovery because the headmistress was
Harry climbs to his feet circles back around the table and reclaims his seat. He studies her for a long moment and his thoughts guiltily circle back to the fact that he is ready. He’d happily have a baby right now. But not with her.
(That maybe Draco deserved that same love in return.)
Amused, Draco asked, ‘Didn’t you read the menu?’
this. But don’t think for a moment that you control him. Voldemort couldn’t in the end, what makes you think you could?’
Both Harry and Granger looked at him, eyes searching for any sign he wasn’t alright and that this should wait and the very fact that Granger was looking at him that way truly drove home how important Harry was to her. She had every reason to distrust him, every reason to hate him for what he’d done to her and the people she loved but here she was being nice to him, showing understanding when rightfully she should have whipped out her wand and hexed him six ways from Sunday. All she had to go on was a tattoo, his friendship with Luna and Harry’s friendly behaviour, but it seemed that, for the moment, that was enough for her to reserve judgement.
Harry actually rolled his eyes but he still seemed embarrassed when he said, ‘Fred taught me that one, summer before fourth year.’
‘Fuck,’ she mutters, dropping her head into her hands. ‘Fuck. Fuck. Fuck!’
Nor had Draco’s reflexively snarky, ‘You probably should, Blaise knows exactly what he’s doing.’
‘He’s a Death Eater, Harry,’ barked Ron, on a bitter laugh. ‘Do you think about that when he’s shoving his cock up your arse? Is that the appeal?’ He scoffed. ‘Or do you fuck him? Is that it? One more way to beat Voldemort?’ Ron made a disgusted sound. ‘What would people say if they knew, huh? What would the rest of the wizarding world think if they knew their sweet precious saviour was a fairy?’
‘We’ll get Artefacts and Objects in to have a look at it before we move it,’ Mendenhall declared. He glared up at Harry and then at Draco. ‘Go outside and catch a portkey back to school before this becomes even more of a circus.’
‘We haven’t spent any time here in a while.’
Draco studied the smooth surface of the box and, after all four of them had tried every diagnostic charm they could think of, shrugged. ‘I haven’t a clue.’
When they looked at him now, eyes skittering away when caught looking too long, they saw his aunt. They saw the Carrows who had tortured them and Greyback who had a thing for kids and eating raw meat outside of the full moon.
She suspected saying it that way made it less awkward for him. She didn’t want it to be less awkward, she wanted him to understand that the fact he could even think those words about their best friend hurt. ‘That’s not an excuse,’ she said.
The goblins were perfectly content to continue doing business with Harry’s gold, but they were champions at holding grudges.
Winthrop pulled a face behind him that might have made Draco smile under different circumstances. He offered Harry a wry smile as Winthrop gripped his bicep tightly and Mendenhall’s fingers dug into his shoulder. Harry’s outraged glare for Mendenhall was the last thing he saw before the portkey activated and he was swept away from Hogwarts.
Ron might not care so much that
‘Did you?’ She sounded amused and not nearly as drunk as he did but that was Pansy. She’d always been able to drink them all under the table. She suffered the worst hangovers for it though, so none of them had ever minded.
‘Yeah, but I never thought it would happen to me and Hermione.’
‘That’s it?’ Hermione mused. ‘It just “spiralled”?’
Draco shrugged. ‘He doesn’t know anything about magic anymore.’
‘When have I ever turned down sex for curse breaking?’ he scoffed.
‘Do you want to talk about it?’ Draco asked, already doubting the answer would be yes but feeling obliged to ask all the same. He wanted to keep this peace between them, wanted to show he was willing to move on from the war and his past behaviour in regard to everyone and not just Harry.
Another ward came down and Draco could see it perfectly, in his mind, the way Harry’s nose wrinkled as he complained, ‘Why did that one smell like something died?’
‘I know. Sixth year…’ he trailed off, not really knowing how to explain. He didn’t want to explain, not really, not in detail.
Hermione seemed to be struggling to stay quiet and listen, but Ginny once more reached out to squeeze her hand. Draco thought Ginny had seen some of this, thought she might have suspected it at the very least. Hadn’t she spent some time on the fringes of Harry’s life? There’d been years where he barely even noticed she existed, at least Draco had always had Harry’s attention. Poor Ginny had, and he would never say this to her face, just sort of been there until Harry’s brain decided he
‘Okay, that’s just fucking weird,’ Harry declared. ‘I don’t care how much time you spend in the wizarding world – this is just ridiculous.’
Fifth year was a strange year. Dichotomous in that he was young and carefree, free to explore his sexuality and the joy of hormones, but he was given power and responsibility in the form of first his prefect duties and then his role in the Inquisitorial Squad. His prefect status acknowledged his hard work and his status within Slytherin and the school long before Umbridge created her squad of students who could properly wield that power and influence in a way being a prefect didn’t allow. She might have made sweeping changes (not all of them good, a lot of Slytherins felt free to admit to that in the safety of the common room) but Umbridge had been exactly what Draco had needed in that moment, an opportunity to show that his father’s teachings had not steered him wrong.
Draco’s alarm disappeared and he felt his lips tug up into a smirk. He read the caption under the photo before he trailed eyes up to the bold headline. He nudged Harry in the ribs with his elbow, ‘You’re still the dashing hero, I see.’
Draco nodded. ‘The muggle prime minister is choosing someone from within his staff.’
‘Seriously?’ Harry looked between Draco and Hermione and both nodded. ‘What an idiot. I mean, I’m assuming you did upset her, but I expected that given what you had to tell her. Did he even give you a chance to explain?’
Harry wasn’t stupid and he’d become a lot more observant since the war ended – probably something to do with not spending half his subconscious and his power on holding back a piece of Voldemort's soul – he could recognise that when Hermione had first realised the truth of his and Draco’s relationship that she’d still strongly disliked him. That she honestly had probably still hated him. But Hermione had seen how much Draco meant to Harry and she’d understood that pushing him would mean losing him and so she’d bitten her tongue and she’d sat back and she’d watched. And while he couldn’t say she was ready to call Draco friend, he did know that she could see the changes in him and was, in all likelihood, going to take that step one day.
‘I’d like to think ‘Mione and I could have talked you out of wasting all that time on some poncy Death Eater.’
He and Draco had history, yes, and a nasty one full of bullying and physical violence at that, but they had faced those things head on, talked them to death until they understood and healed and that was why he and Draco could love each other now. Facing those actions, learning how it impacted them – how Draco felt knowing everyone assumed he’d bought his way onto the quidditch team or why Harry reacted the way he did to remarks about his schoolwork – that was how they could be in a relationship.
Hermione didn’t seem to know whether to be jealous or impressed, if Harry was reading her expression right. Ron, on the other hand, finally shook himself free of the horror of Draco and Ginny sharing a meal and training together, to stare at Harry in confusion.
But Harry didn’t think Hermione needed to hear that. Not yet anyway. He supposed there might come a time, if Ron didn’t settle into himself and learn from all his past mistakes, that Hermione would be quite happy to let Harry point out Ron’s flaws and criticise his many failings. Harry was just trying not to be too eager about that possibility. He didn’t want to give Ron that much of his time and energy at the moment. He just wanted to quietly hate him for a bit but sort of in the background where it didn’t impact on his day and was just something that occurred to him at random moments when he was forced to remember Ron’s existence.
‘I’m not sure what to think about that,’ Draco admitted. ‘I don’t really remember much of that.’
‘Hermione might know something about the Mark,’ Harry murmured, sleepily. ‘She used a similar charm on those coins we had for the DA.’
‘The man I talked to everyday in Azkaban – that man is worth loving.’
Draco rolled his eyes. ‘He saw me talking to Hermione (who was crying) and thought I’d upset her.’
Weasley flinched when he spoke but other than scowling down at his eggs he didn’t comment. Granger looked interested by the question and Draco could appreciate that, although she didn’t know all the facts, she recognised there was more going on than she knew and therefore was reserving judgement until she possessed those facts.
There was a beat while they all considered that and then Pomfrey knocked down the suggestion. ‘Any form of apparition will do more harm than good. The stasis can hold her another thirteen minutes by my count.’
And it
‘I sleep just fine,’ Harry assured her, with a smile. ‘I mean, I’m not getting ten hours a night like some people,’ he shot Ron a pointed look, ‘but I do alright.’ He shrugged. ‘Besides, it’s only for another six months and then Draco and I can sit our exams – NEWTs first, but they’ve promised to rush our results so we can sit the rest right after.’
Or that Ron’s first time would be with Hermione.
‘He’s a Death Eater,’ Harry replied harshly, turning to look at them finally, eyes blazing with fury. ‘It’s what he deserves,’ he added bitterly.
‘I don’t want details,’ Pansy assured him. ‘I don’t need to know everything. I think it’s better if I don’t.’
Ron shook his head. ‘I don’t want her to think I have doubts.’
Carrel shot one last glare at Draco before he turned tail and scurried back to the Hufflepuff table. McGonagall didn’t watch him go. Not waiting to be asked, Draco withdrew the wand from his robes and handed it to McGonagall.  She took it from him and tucked it into her own robes.
to talk to Weasley after he said such horrible things to you and probably because she misses him.’

Harry was already moving, sprinting across the common room, arriving beside Draco at the same time as Hermione even though she’d been much closer.
They could add that to the list of questions they had. Although, perhaps not one they would ask Hermione to research as he wasn’t sure he’d be able to explain to her why there was a book she couldn’t touch let alone read.
That was one of the arguments Draco had tried to use. Harry hadn’t listened then and he didn’t want to listen now, but again, Robards wasn’t finished.
He tightened his hand around Draco’s in his pocket, but he didn’t speak, leaving Draco to have this moment of quiet reflection.
Draco spat out a mouthful of toothpaste and said, ‘You have met my father, yes?’
(See the end of the chapter for
But that was later when he understood that the world he loved so much and the things he believed so strongly were corrupt and wrong and that everything he thought he knew needed to be twisted and turned until it was shaped completely different. Until he was completely different.
It wasn’t intentional, but as he’d been talking, he’d been getting angrier and angrier and his magic had reacted accordingly. The air in the room warmed as he spoke until a bead of sweat formed on Robards’ forehead and the paint on the wall behind Harry started to crack and bubble. He didn’t once take his eyes off the man who wanted to be his boss. It wasn’t something he was proud to show off, and it certainly wasn’t something the old Harry would have done, but this Harry would do anything in his power to protect the man he loved.
