Quietly I step toward the cart Malfoy enters minutes ago. Knocking on the side of carriage I swing myself up into the compartment. It wasn't that I didn't expect any of his friends to be here but I didn't expect him to completely alone. Clearing my throat I sit my bags in the seat beside me and across from Malfoy. Look up and meet his peircing grey...no blue eyes.
"Did they say who all would be returning from our year?" Harry question once Hermione was don't list off all of her classes.
The plane lands nearly in my plate before I catch it and flip it to the side potter wrote his reply on.
Light footsteps behind me snag my attention. "Honestly Potter didn't you get any new robes, those are several inches to short, and look at the hem is completely unraveled." before I can think of a witty reply Malfoy pulls out his wand. Under his breath he releases two spells directed to my robes. One lengthening the garment itself and the other restoring the hem to a rightful state. "Your welcome, " Malfoy meets my eyes. "I am...glad you survived Potter." he dips his head and quickly leaves the changing compartment.
Draco shakes my hand, smiling tentatively. "It looks like everyone has made it inside. Let go take a look at our room." Draco leaves me standing in the hallway. I never actually expected him to accept my friendship. I am glad he did, though. I rush inside and see Hermione glancing at me, curiously from the fireplace in the common area. I make my way over to her, "I think I just became friends with Malfoy."
Harry starts unpacking his suitcase, and as he does this, he starts talking about Quidditch this year and how he thinks the teams will do. "McGonagall has asked me to be Captin of the Slytherin team this year," I tell him. "really, she asked me to be Captin for Gryffindor."
I leave Harry sitting on his bed as I go to the washroom to change and brush my teeth. He is still sitting in the same spot when I come out. I don't think he is coping with his emotions from the war. "sometimes, " I huff, "sometimes, my nightmares are so bad that when I wake up, I cannot move except to check my pulse to make sure I'm still alive. After that I just lay there. Sometimes after those nightmares, I have panic attacks. sometimes I just pass back out."
Everyone pushes their way through. Everyone except Potter, that is. Stepping out of everyone's way, I find myself at his side once again. "what's the matter, Potter? You won't have to worry about all your fans hounding you for autographs until tomorrow. Everyone in there was in the war with you."
Potter sits back crossing his arms a smirk forming on his lips "still upset about that are you malfoy, that was 8 years ago." I feel a smile pull at my own lips "Dont flatter yourself Potter." There's a glint in his emerald eyes that I don't entirely like "I'm done with childish fights, Malfoy. I've grown tired of them so, do you know what I plan on doing?"
Threading my fingers in his hair, I pull him to my chest into a tight embrace. Harry sighs and relaxes in my arms before wrapping his own around my middle. My breath hitches, and I try to pull away. Harry's grip tightens around me, and suddenly, I'm pulled into his bed beside him. I'm starting to panic now, but Harry’s grip is like a vise. I close my eyes and take a deep breath. I try to calm down. I breathe in Harry's scent, where his head rests against my chest.
Sighing, I step back to let him leave. Quietly we make our way to the dining hall and sit quickly, shoving food in our mouths. I forgot how hungry Quidditch makes me. I see Harry talking to Weasley, and I glance at Granger. “do you have the work from arithmancy, Granger?” she beams at me and gives Harry and Weasley a pointed look before looking back to me’ “I took the liberty of getting your work for you actually. I hope you don't mind. I'll get it to you after dinner.”
"This should be no problem for me. Your nimbus 2000 will hardly be able to keep up!" smirking Harry glides up beside me, pats the shaft of his broom, looks me in the eyes, and says, "It's not about speed, Draco, it's about how you ride it." I stare at him, eyes wide, fighting to keep from falling off my broom. He seems utterly oblivious to what he just implied. “I ride brilliantly, Harry. I wouldn't get your hopes up." I manage to reply smoothly using his phrasing against him. Harry sits there, digesting my words before his eyes widen, and a blush creeps over his cheeks.
Ron coughs, "what did you just say, mate, your friends with Malfoy, what do you wanna be friends with that slimy git for?" I pat Ron's shoulder, "he is different, Ron more subdued, not so easy to anger, I think you guys could even be friends with time." Ron is not okay with that as he mumbles fowl words under his breath about Malfoy and friends and walks away.
Several long moments later the red steam engine pulled up to the curb. Draco stood back wanting to wait out the crowd of first year's and their parents who are all so proud to have children boarding the train. The bitterness came off of him in waves. Finally as the last few stepped over the threshold draco made his way to train. It was obvious now he had made a mistake. By avoiding the crowd. Outside he had ensure a large audience would be waiting on the train. Suppressing a groan, Draco fixed a blank expression across his warm face while keeping a ducked head.
The sorting hat has just finished it's duties and is being taken back to its place in the headmistress's office when head mistress mcgonagall speaks. "I am glad to see so many of you have came, and returned this year. We have rebuilt much of the corridors that were damaged. The only wing yet to be repaired is the east wing on the 6th floor. I have for this reason blocked that particular path off and students are not to venture into the wing."
Caught up in his thoughts Harry almost failed to notice his two life long friends Ron and Hermione waving at him heading in his direction. Harry quickly plastered a smile on his face. Embracing Hermione and pounding Rons fist he glanced around.
Draco plays his part very well. With confusion written all over his face, he stands, grabbing his things and making for the door where I wait.
I grin back at him “well. That was quite a bit easier than I thought it would be. I’ve only ever told Zabini and Parkin. Though I think they already knew.” Harry snorts “what, did they catch you snogging a picture of professor Lockhart or something. everyone was batty over him.” My shoulders shake with laughter “more like or something. I couldn’t stand him.” Harry doesn’t question me further about it and soon dinner ends with everyone making their way stumbling sleepily to their dorms.
"Okay, students, your password will be butterbeer. Your room is labeled with your names attached to the door." McGonagall instructs us, "I will see you all bright and early for your classes tomorrow; please rest well."
"Ron, I disliked him as much as the next person, but it's different now. Nothing is the same. Nobody is the same as they were before. The war changed everyone. It's possible it has changed Malfoy too." I try to make eye contact with Ron but he refuses to meet my eyes. "whatever you say mate."
"I almost believed that sneer was real. I know you have a rep and all that nonsense." Draco hides a smile "that I do." and I nod "well, you will likely have to create a new one because I don't plan on ignoring you all day. What kind of friend would I be then?" Draco puts a hand on his forehead "what have I gotten myself into with you?" I clap his shoulder and shovel food on my plate "id say you in for a great deal of mischief."
I haven't opened my eyes yet. I simply lay warm under my sheets with strong arms still wrapped around my middle. "Good morning." A gravelly voice whispers into my hair and last night comes back to me. I tense but just as quickly relax. I am laying in Harry's arms. Harry came to my bed last night to comfort me and then held me all night.
I see Potter read the note and look in my direction before shrugging as if to say what can you do, and mouthing what appears to be "sorry, mate." nodding my thanks Potter begins to write a reply when Mcgonagall announces the end of dinner and he never gets the chance to finish.
“hold still." I grab his shoulders. “I'll go first, then you follow after.” In the dim light, nobody has to know how much room I have behind me or the fact that honestly, I could step back at any time. I just like the feel of his body pressed up against mine. I don't step back straight away, but look down at the small boy, and the blush creeping up his face again.
Harry felt the lie slip from him tongue "of course Hermione." It's not that he wouldn't want to tell them so much as he wouldn't know how to talk to another witch apart from Hermione and of course Ginny. “I was actually...” Harry hesitates “wondering if Malfoy would be returning.” he voices turn to look down walk tying to avoid the unbelieving looks coming from their direction.
Without windows in our room, the complete darkness makes my eyes grow heavy now that I've calmed down, and before I know it, I've succumbed to sleep with the chosen one, Harry Potter, the love of my life in my arms, and I'm terrified I'm going to regret this in the morning.
Harry looks at me, eyes red. "I'm sorry you had to go through that. Do you talk to anybody about them?" I wish I could tell him I do, but since the war, I haven't had anyone to talk to about them. "like I said, even just to say it out loud to yourself helps." shrugging, I force a smile "so. What class do you have first?"
I'm pulled from my thoughts as he turns his face my way fully and I have to take a breath to keep my face from visibly reddening. Why would I be studying his face? It dosen't matter I tell myself as Potter finally speaks. "you know you may be right. mcGonagall always wondered I think why we weren't friends."  I feel my rigid posture relax slightly. How is it so easy to talk to this boy who was my sworn enemy all through school? "Ah, Potter Granger is not the only one who is top of her class, and if I am correct I offered to be your friend in first year, but you declined."
Ron and Hermione glanced at each other, "Dean Thomas, Seamus..." Hermione list ticking each off of her fingers. "I'm positive there are others, but we didn't receive any lists. Those are just the mates Ron and I have takes to."
Harry's shoulders relax as he tells me he has Transfiguration first. I do as well, and when we compare our schedules, it would seem we have all but one class together. Harry has a free period, and I took arithmancy. I gather my books for class.
“Malfoy, ” Potter calls to me. “Im-Im glad you came back this year.” and with that odd comment he turn back and slides the door closed leaving me standing completely dumbstruck. did potter just say he was glad to see me?
"what are you sneering at Malfoy?" Wesley calls over Potters shoulder. I do not bother to respond. I didn't come to Hogwarts this year for petty squabbles. I came to finish my education and maybe make it through the year alive.
Harry glances around our new room. There are no four-poster beds, just simple framed full-sized beds. My side is all forest green with hints of silver in small places. Harry's side is mostly crimson with a little gold in a few areas. Luckily, there are bookshelves because I genuinely do like to read, and I have quite a few books. "McGonagall outdid herself this time," Harry says, glancing at my side. "hey, Potter do you plan to use your bookshelf, I just have several books, and I don't think my one will hold them all." I ask politely, "yea, no, I won't be using it your free to do with it what you please." he raises a brow "oh, and my friends call me Harry." nodding, I grab my first suitcase to start unpacking "alright...Harry, call me Draco then."
I nod and sigh “its honestly hard to believe we've managed to grow this much in a year's time.” Malfoy clenches his jaw “right well I imagine this past year required a lot of growing up on both of our parts.” with this he turns to glare out the window. “we shouldn't have had to though. None of us should have had to go through that.” I say the words barely more than a whisper.
The rest of our ride to Hogwarts is quiet and uneventful. The hiss of the train jolts me back to reality and I grab my stuff from the over head compartment. Ron slides out his and Hermione’s and with that we step off the Hogwarts express and head for the castle one last time. I realize as we start toward the carriage that Ron and Hermione will be able to see the thestrel’s. Everyone who was in the war and likely most who weren’t will be able to see them now. Somehow this thought does not sooth me. I didn't expect it to but I wish they had never gained this particular sight.
"Professor Mcgonagall as Head Mistress, " the unfamiliar voice of a slytherin a few seats down meets my ears. "who would you rather have had take dumbledores position, please enlightened me?" I hiss effectively shutting down his complaint.
I'm startled from my thoughts as a small parchment plane clips the side of my head and lands beside my plate. Ron and Hermione are sitting across from each other in a heated debate about something or other. Opening the plane I read the note written in nest lines.
Slowly and quietly, I slip from his arms and stand up, grabbing my glasses off the nightstand. Standing now, I cannot help but look him over. When else will I have time to just look at him to take in his features. His hair has fuzzed up from sleep, and his face is so relaxed. He almost has a smile on his pink lips. I'm not mad about waking up in his arms; I'm only shocked. Grabbing my robes, I make my way to the bathroom to get ready for classes.
Harry shakes his head. "No, it's not that. I just always stayed in Gryffindor. For most of my life, it was my truest home. It's just a little disappointing that I won't get to stay there this one last time." he answers honestly. The sincerity, in his words, leaves me slightly shaken. "I know what you mean. I may have had a large House, but the Slytherin common room was my home." Harry looks at me as if he is seeing me for the first time. He smiles and turns to me, offering his hand "I'm Harry Potter, it's nice to meet you, and you are?" He grins at me.
Malfoy raises a single brow “Potter, are you-I’m sorry, are you quite alright,” he questions, “why are you not with Granger and the weasel?” my hackles rise at the name. Malfoy has coined for Ron but shakes my head and shrug, “carriage was full.” this time I manage to hold back my smile as I lean back and stretch my legs out. I have gotten quite a bit taller since the last time I had to ride in the carriages.
The words were cut off by sure hands gripping onto his tie and pulling him forward, connecting Harry's lips with the red-headed girls in a blunt kiss. He winced at the harsh contact, hands flailing at his sides in shock. When Ginny jerked back, seemingly pleased with herself, Harry was still stuttering as he tried to comprehend what just happened.
"What was that about?" Hermione asked, dropping the books into Ron's chest and pouting to herself as she corrected her robe after Draco's graceless exit.
"Nice of you to show your support." He teased, the hallway behind them erupting in murmurs as the other students caught on to Draco's unusual attire.
Sat in the Gryffindor common room, the blond kept his face passive, but on the inside he was screaming with rage. How dare she. How dare that punny little girl touch Potter like that. Kiss his boyfriend as though he were air itself and she hadn't taken a breath in years. Only he had a right to do that, to feel such a way for the other boy. And yet Ginny Weasley had strolled up to Harry, planted one on him, as though she wasn't committing an act of Treason.
"What happened to keeping quiet?" Harry quipped back just as he slid a second finger inside Draco and curled them both upwards. The blond moaned, head knocking back against the wood as his body arched, hungrily taking in more of the digits inside him.
"I'm not contesting that, Potter." Draco grumbled, ruffled by Harry's frantic movements enough he jolted when the boy suddenly filled his field of vision again.
The result was immediate, causing Harry to jump slightly as thin ropes wound themselves around Draco's chest from seemingly out of nowhere. Looping and twisting around his pale torso, it was only seconds later that the blond was incapacitated. Arms glued to his sides, legs free, Draco's chest rose and fell dramatically as his eyes rapidly darted around the room.
"You should go," Draco said, stretching his arms above his head as Harry stared down at him, lust still lingering in his eyes as he watched the action. Pushing at his chest until the brunet rolled off him Draco sat up, fully clicking out his back. Immediately Potter was on him again, searching hands sliding across his front and hungry lips capturing his own as Harry attempted to seduce Draco into letting him stay the night when they both knew the consequences of getting caught weren't entirely worth it.
With a bored smirk, Draco straightened the collar of Harry's shirt, pleased by the large red and purple bruise marks littering his slender throat.
"Draco," He moaned out, dropping a hand to his cock and stroking firmly. Pre-come dripped from his tip onto the bed and he squeezed the base of his cock for some relief. He wanted tonight to last, he always did, but something about the way Draco was shuddering against the sheets with every touch he gave had him already on the edge. Letting himself go, Harry spread the blond's cheeks fully before burying his face in the hot flesh. Draco cried out in surprise, jerking forward as the flat of the brunet's tongue dragged across him. Fingers tangled in the sheets, nearly tearing them as he moaned, eyes drifting shut as Harry pointed his tongue and attempted entry. His hole relaxed, always so needy for the other boy, and he slid inside, opening Draco with ease. Harry groaned, movements becoming more frantic, wetter as he dove his tongue in and out of Draco with passion, spearing inside him unrelentingly. Pulling back for air he rubbed his lube thumb against the glistening skin, rutting against Draco's thigh as the tip slipped inside.
"No, that's disturbing. Change it back," Harry ordered, hand stifling further laughter as Draco ruffled his new locks.
"It's the weekend, Harry." Ginny said through a grin, enjoying the older boys flustered expression at being corrected.
"You like that?" Harry whispered, mouthing over the bolt of Draco's jaw, dragging teeth down until he could feel the blond's heartbeat against his lips.
"Draco," He sighed, words intended to be scowling but coming out far too fond and flustered. Draco dragged his tongue along his bottom lip, clearly uncaring of Harry's internal struggle. His hands settled on his belt, slowly tugging the zip down as fingers encroached on the growing bulge sitting there.
"Insulting me isn't going to do you any favours, Malfoy," Harry warned, biting his lip at the shaky moan Draco let out at having been addressed by his last name. Something Harry rarely did, and which mad Draco keen every time it occurred.
"Harder," Draco repeated and Harry let out a mirthless chuckle, lifting his head to stare the other boy down. With a final squeeze, he dragged his hand up the Slytherin's body until it reached the slope of his throat. Maintaining eye contact, Harry placed a light pressure, the touch imploring. At the smile which broke out on Draco's lips, followed by a curt nod, he tightened his hold and watched as Draco let out a choked moan. Picking up his pace, Harry slammed his hips against Draco's, lost in the pleasure that was his body, and growing desperate to come but unwilling to do so until Draco orgasmed first. Tilting his hips slightly, Harry slowed down long enough to seek out the spot inside Draco that made his back arch like a cat, eyes drifting shut as he panted Harry's name, voice wrecked with pleasure. Finding it, he released Draco's throat long enough to grip his weeping cock, stroking firmly as his own cock pounded against Draco's prostate relentlessly.
Draco moaned as his belly was stretched by Harry’s piss. It wasn’t the first load of piss he’d taken that way that night, nor the second. Normally this was reserved for people who paid extra for their tickets. But then Harry was there, and he wanted Harry’s piss invading his colon. His bowels sloshed, full of liquid, and he felt a sick thrill of arousal as Harry began thrusting again, apparently brought back to hardness by the unspeakable act.
“I never even had one. Dudley did, of course. I got to watch the TV show, sometimes. Didn’t know how to get money changed to muggle money till the year I was on the run, and my aunt would have thought I’d stolen it, anyway.”
Harry’s HIV test had finally come back positive. Meaning, he had antibodies to it—not that those did any good against the virus, in the long run. But he’d known it was going to; it was simply a matter of time. He’d even gotten the flu-like sickness that sometimes goes with initial HIV infection. He’d been fucking Draco every day, sharing needles with him when they did drugs, and even taking steroids to trash his immune system further and catch up to Draco.
Draco was extremely weak, and had given up on going to the toilet at all. Instead, he just shat the bed, letting his waste leak out of him without even attempting to control his bowels, vomiting occasionally as the nausea took him. He pissed there as well, since everything was already dirty. Most of the bed was slick with his disgusting fluids.
So he’d gotten the call from the NHS, attended a counseling session with a very nice lady who obviously assumed he’d be devastated by the news, and brushed off the offer of antiretroviral prescriptions with the excuse of “needing time to think about this.” Then he’d gone home to Draco and celebrated.
It actually took Harry a minute to see it. Draco was face-down, and his hair was soaked with several men’s piss and cum, making it look darker than usual. But then the man using his mouth came and Draco turned his head to receive another cock, and Harry’s eyes met his. For a split second, a look of shock and recognition flashed across both their faces.
Harry couldn’t remember the name of this dive. Not when he was drunk enough for what he planned to do next. He tossed back the last of his sixth drink, then headed towards the back room.
Had anyone walked in, the stink would have knocked them flat. All that shit and vomit lying about, and with the heat turned up because Harry and Draco were wet with liquid shit and running fevers. However, the two of them had been lying in their own mess so long that they barely noticed the smell, unless they put their faces right in it. Which they did, sometimes, because the stench turned them on.
The vile, bitter taste of shit and vomit exploded over Draco’s tongue. He gagged, adding a little of his own vomit to the mix. Still, though his cheeks puffed out, he managed not to lose the mouthful. Harry would punish him if he did, and though the punishments were always orgasmically amazing and sybaritically disgusting and painful, he didn’t want to disappoint Harry. Instead, Draco swirled the vile sickwaste around his mouth, getting used to its sulfurous, earthy bouquet, and then forced it down. All those fecal pathogens were going to make him so, so sick. His cock throbbed in anticipation of how his guts would cramp later, as the germs ravaged them.
. It had tasted like snot, if someone had farted at the same time as you’d coughed a snot wad into your mouth, according to Draco.
He was prepared for the plastic sheeting on the floor, the acrid smell, the puddles, the numerous half-naked men using a filthy, soaked body that dangled from a stained sex sling.
Today, thanks to their HIV and their habits, they were both sick. They weren’t sure where they’d picked it up—the illegal food cart? Leftover Indian food? Taking cocks ass to mouth in that tube station gloryhole? But wherever it had come from, it had their bowels and stomachs absolutely trashed. Neither of them could stop shitting for more than a few minutes. Both of them found this situation extremely hot.
“I was headed to the gents, but it wasn’t filthy enough,” said Harry. Or at least a close enough approximation of the passphrase. He couldn’t feel his tongue.
him? Sure, Draco was being pissed on and drinking piss, but inside him? It was depraved—and so, so hot. Harry’s cock was doing its best to get hard again, not that it was going to succeed for about ten minutes. Fortunately, the drinks he’d had earlier meant he had some piss to give Draco. Harry released his bladder inside Draco’s bowels, tentatively at first, then full force.
The splatter and stench of stomach acid on Harry’s chest sent the blood rushing to his cock. He pressed Draco’s skinny body into the filthy sheets, preparing to enter it. Diarrhea still leaked out of Draco’s stretched asshole, a neverending slurry of brown filth. It made for good lube. Harry shoved his cock in, moaning as the shit-slick walls squeezed around him. All the diarrhea had given both of them tons of anal mucus, making their assholes super slick. Sometimes, if one of them hadn’t eaten in a while, he’d go to shit and all that would come out would be butt snot, looking like someone had emptied their entire sinuses onto wherever he had shit—but it all came out of his butt.
“I like the concept of this one,” said Draco. “The scion of a Pureblood house, debasing himself in unmanly ways until he dies of his excesses, hopefully in a compromising position that makes good tabloid fodder, even with the naughty bits covered by black boxes.” He sipped his coffee again. “So yeah, I’ve got AIDS. Also syphilis, herpes, the clap, warts…gotta catch’em all.”
The next morning, Harry found Draco at the breakfast table. He looked bad—almost like a different person from last night. He was alarmingly skinny, and he had huge circles under his eyes. Harry realized that he must have been using spells to make himself look healthier.
Draco was also horny beyond belief, even in his weakened state. Sometimes in end stage HIV, the sufferer becomes constantly aroused—perhaps controlled, in part, by the virus’s biological drive to spread itself. Draco was lucky enough to experience this, giving him a respite from the increasing weakness and pain as his body was ravaged by diseases and cancers. Even though he was taking heroin for the pain most of the time, his sex drive still ended up about where it had been before—which had been pretty high, since he’d been in his late twenties and had the Malfoy genetic bent to hedonism. So the shit-soaked sheets he lay in were also liberally smeared with cum, as the disease and the knowledge of his situation kept stoking the fire in his infected cock.
“Why wouldn’t I—Oh. You really think Purebloods all live in un-updated mansions with no tech later than the nineteenth century? Oh, Potter. We make a show of tradition, for the masses, and Hogwarts has its own peculiarities, but we’ve all got electricity and hot water—why have to maintain a bunch of spells when you can throw money at the electric company to do the same things—and we certainly have TVs and videogames. I had two Gameboys so I could get all the trade evolutions.”
It took Harry a couple tries to get the doorknob to interface with his hand, but he managed eventually. Down a dingy hall, third door on the left. He thought he was prepared for what he’d find inside.
Harry stared at a spot on the table for a long moment. “Yeah,” he said at last. “If this is life, fuck living.”
“Whatever. Point is they don’t let me do anything. Give me promotions for nothing. I wanted to be an Auror, but not like this. I’m sick of it.”
“It’s rare, but not a myth. You just have to be suicidal and a hedonist at the same time, and not end up on heroin first. I’m surprised you haven’t asked why.”
His belly felt so full. He’d swallowed so much piss and cum, had so much pumped into him, and now Harry was making it all move inside him. As someone else shoved a cock down his throat, Draco vomited piss and cum and the remains of pills all over that cock and the floor. A few people left when they saw Draco puke—puke was a harder kink than piss, and smelled worse—but Harry was even more turned on, panting and slamming against Draco’s ass until he spilled a second cumload inside him.
“Harry, fuck me,” he begged. His voice was hoarse with thrush. Then, seized with a sudden wave of nausea, he vomited onto Harry’s chest.
Harry couldn’t just leave him there. He got him down from the sex swing and Apparated the both of them back to his apartment. He put Draco on the couch and covered him with an afghan.
“I don’t want to be better.” Draco sipped his coffee, wrapping his skinny fingers around the mug to absorb its warmth.
“Malfoy,” Granger greeted him with a nod, seemingly completely unsurprised to see him there.  “How is he?”
When Malfoy’s fingers trailed down to stroke his inner thigh, Harry stopped trying to resist. “My cock,” he begged. “Please.”
shook his head with a smile, as if he couldn’t believe could be so lucky, and climbed onto the bed, positioning himself between Draco’s legs and leaning
Draco tapped his pen against the desk. His Latin professor droned on in the background - something about subjunctives, Draco thought – but his mind was miles away from the dusty, old classroom. It was swirling around bright lights, loud noises and endless crowds of people who didn’t know his name, didn’t know his family, didn’t expect anything of him.
Well, he supposed it was only proper to use the Slytherin’s first name now that Harry had an article of his clothing hidden in his bed.  Harry’s cheeks turned red as he determinedly halted that train of thought.
If you had told Harry that one day he’d be attending a wizarding funfair with Hermione, Ron and Draco Malfoy, he would have laughed in your face, given you a pat on the head and suggested you take a trip to St Mungo’s. Because it was ridiculous. Only apparently, according to Hermione and Ron, it wasn’t. Apparently it was completely normal to invite your ex-Hogwarts rival out for an evening at the fair and only tell your best friend about it right at the last second.
But every movement only served to bring them closer together until Harry was pressed against Malfoy from knee to shoulder. The fresh, fruity scent of Malfoy’s hair wafted into his face and Harry closed his eyes, praying to the four founders that Hermione and Ron would hurry the fuck up before things got even more awkward. He was only human, after all, and he wouldn’t be able to help it if his body decided that it was rather interested in being this close to someone, and a rather nice smelling someone at that, after such a long time.
Nearly paralysed by shock, Draco didn’t notice the arrival of the on-site Mediwitch and jumped as she placed a cool hand on his arm.
As expected, his friends did not share Harry’s enthusiasm for finally making Malfoy smile, and when Ron asked why he even cared Harry had no answer for him.  He wasn’t sure quite when helping Draco Malfoy had become so important to him.  Maybe it was around the same time that Harry realised that they weren’t so different.  Yes, they had been on different sides of the war, but both of them had been used, had been pushed and pulled around like chess pieces, and both of them now seemed unsure of how to move on.
As Draco packed up his bag for the day and went to meet Pansy for breakfast, the last traces of pen on paper trickled away; the words “
voice was cut off as the ward doors slammed behind him. Draco ran, his jumbled thoughts coalescing into one terrifying, stomach churning, heart palpitating
“I don’t know, Hermione,” Harry sighed, resigned to his friend’s well-meant probing.  “That’s what I’m doing now, trying to keep busy until I figure out exactly what it is that I do want to do.”
“Urg, sorry it took me so long. There was no cheese and tomato so I hope you’re okay with…” she trailed off as she took in the sight in front of her.

hips were pulled back, leaving Draco with his arse up in the air. Hot breath grazed his lower back and he felt a flush spread up his neck as he realised
“Maybe he just likes the reminder of playing Quidditch in school and you happened to be in the shot” she suggested unconvincingly.
more difficult to reverse and Draco rolled his eyes in irritation as another loud quack echoed down the corridor from the direction of the public ward.
“Harry,” Hermione started in a placating tone, “you do realise that this whole idea is insane, don’t you?”
A deafening noise startled Draco awake. His pale hand automatically shot out from under the duvet to snooze the alarm, pausing in confusion when it failed to find his clock and instead encountered a battered mobile phone. Draco’s brow furrowed, still sluggish from sleep. He opened his eyes warily and blinked, startled, around him. This wasn’t his bedroom.
Harry shook his head, laughing. “I guess not. You must have been a little shit though; if you were this nice in school I can’t imagine why we wouldn’t have
He twisted round to see Malfoy walking over, the entrance doors swinging shut behind him.  “Malfoy?  What are you doing out here?”
Draco was working hard to clear the rubble and debris in the Great Hall when he heard the shouts and screams coming from down the corridor.  He paused in confusion and poked his head out of the door to see what the commotion was.
“Oh, Harry! We were so worried when we got the call this morning. Thank Merlin you’re alright,” she babbled, her face buried in Harry’s neck. Harry looked
Draco breathed a small sigh of relief as Harry’s attention shifted to Maddie; faced with that smile and those green eyes he felt helpless, like he couldn’t
Draco laughed as they climbed the stone staircase up to the entrance hall.  “Yeah, right.  Like you don’t know how cute your messy hair is.”
Harry’s face split into a wide grin. “And they’re coming in to see me?” At the Healer’s nod he bounced lit up in excitement and Draco felt a stab of

Draco’s eyes widened as he hastened to obey. He settled on his front, cock rubbing uncomfortably against the covers, and called out in surprise when his
After the awkward introductions, he found it surprisingly easy to talk to the wizard.  Harry found out that his name was Jonathan and that he worked in the children’s ward at St Mungo’s as a Mediwizard.  He found out that Jonathan loved cats and the Holyhead Harpies but hated jazz and spiders.  In fact, he was just starting to think that he maybe could have been interested when a familiar posh drawl tore his gaze away and further down the room.
Form-fitting grey trousers hugged his slender legs and a deep blue jumper that looked so soft it had probably cost more than Harry’s entire wardrobe curved around his shoulders.  Draco laughed and Harry realised with a jolt that he had been caught staring.
Draco smiled at him. “Me too, Harry.” He leaned down to place a gentle kiss on Harry’s lips. “And plenty more like it to come.”
As they compared dates from hell, Harry realised that they were actually having a civil conversation.  More than civil, even.  In fact, Harry found that he was enjoying Malfoy’s company so much that when the horn sounded to signify that five minutes was up he jumped an inch off his seat, banging his knee painfully against the table leg in the process.
Harry panicked as he realised that he had almost strayed onto the subject of the war and quickly tried to change the subject.
Draco swallowed the lump in his throat as his hand was slowly released. He drank in the sight of Harry sitting before him, smile directed at him because
“Wonderful,” Harry said. “They’re really great. Hermione said that she’s going to bring in some photographs for me to look at later.”
He was rewarded with a deep chuckle as the hand on his shoulder moved down to rest lightly on his lower back.  “Seems fair enough,” Malfoy agreed.
His bedroom at Avebury Academy was gaudy in a way most people would have found impressive, but which made Draco’s skin crawl. With its wood-panelled walls, four poster bed, and opulence dripping from every nook and cranny, it represented all the tradition and heritage he wanted to escape.

"Alright, but you know you can talk to me, yeah?  I mean, my own brother is gay so I know how hard it can be."
If possible, Malfoy looked even more confused at Harry’s greeting.  A moment of tense silence passed until Malfoy slowly nodded his head at Harry.  Harry breathed out a sigh of relief and took Malfoy’s nod as permission to carry on talking.

As they piled out of the booth, Ron handed them each a copy of the photo. Harry distractedly pocketed his and took a deep breath, grateful to be out of the confined tent and taking advantage of the fresh air to regain his composure. He followed as Ron and Hermione strolled off and listened as they excitedly discussed what they wanted to do next. He glanced over at Malfoy and frowned in confusion. The blond was staring in horror down at the photo in his hand, his face flushed red with embarrassment. What’s got him so upset, Harry wondered as he pulled out the photo that had been hurriedly stuffed into his pocket. Before he could examine it, however, he heard a rasping voice call out.

“Erm, yeah, okay,” Harry said, shooting Draco a concerned look before standing up and following Maddie out of the ward.
Draco shook his head. “I still need to read up on the research and practice the spell so perhaps in a day or two.”
“Draco,” he said, trying out the name.  It felt strange, all rolling r’s and vowels, but the more he said it the more he began to like the sound of it.  “Draco.  Draco.  Dra-“
“I thought that would be pretty obvious, weasel,” Malfoy drawled, not bothering to turn around.  “I’m taking Potter to Madam Pomfrey.”
He tried and failed not to stare as Harry hurriedly removed his boxers and promptly forgot all about his manners as his brain short circuited. Of course
Malfoy and Ron filed in behind and only then did Harry realise just how small the tent was. It was no larger than a broomstick cupboard and, as Hermione and Ron fussed around with knuts and sickles, Harry was pushed up against the side wall, a head full of hair in his face and his arms full of a very pointy Malfoy.
Draco opened the door and peered out into the hallway, gesturing at Weasley and Granger to come in. He barely made it out of the way as a teary Granger

Weasley and Granger occupied the two chairs in the room and in between them sat Harry, cross-legged on the covers and practically buzzing with excitement.
Draco grinned - it had worked, he had cured Harry - before the sinking realisation hit him and he deflated. He should be happy; Harry was free to go out
“Hello, Harry,” he greeted. “Hermione Granger and Ronald Weasley have just arrived to see you,” he said, reaching out and touching the brunet’s shoulder
The smile was still in place hours later when Draco finally arrived home. Harry had once again joined them for the night and Draco had regaled him with his

was supposed to remain scowling once Harry turned that brilliant smile on him again he had no idea.
He jumped as the discarded mobile phone came to life again from the side table. He picked it up and, cancelling the alarm with a flick of his finger, turned the mobile over in his hand. It was a far cry from the newest model smart phone Draco’s parents had bought him for his seventeenth birthday, he thought, but might be his best chance of figuring out where the hell he was.
“I think we need a new plan,” she replied.  “I mean, insults were all good and well when we were eleven but if you really want Potter we’re going to have to try something else.”
So, what else did he know about Draco? Well he was around Harry’s age, was obviously posh enough to go to school here and this girl was apparently his friend. Girlfriend? Oh God, Harry thought. What if this girl was Draco’s girlfriend and she expected him to hold her hand and kiss her and then she realised something was wrong because Harry wasn’t acting right?
By the time he made it back to the dishevelled bedroom he had woken up in what felt like days ago, Draco had just enough energy to pull back the duvet before crashing on the threadbare sheets and falling asleep.
He heard Ron’s hesitation as concern for his best friend battled against his hatred of Malfoy.  “Sure.  We’ll be right behind you.”
“Maybe it could have been perfect for you, but you’re the Boy Who Lived,” Malfoy pressed on, and Harry noticed the lack of sneer that usually accompanied these words.  “You’ve been fighting dark wizards since you were a baby, Potter.  Don’t you think you’ve done enough fighting for a lifetime?”
Harry joined in, rather weakly, and wondered why the thought of Malfoy holding his hand made his stomach break out into butterflies.
Harry was in full-blown panic mode. His arm was currently trapped in a vice-like grip, courtesy of the slightly scary girl who had swept into his room this morning and then swept out again with Harry in tow, declaring imperiously that they would be late for breakfast if he didn’t get a move on.

“I’m going to head home, Maddie,” Draco said. “Healer Chapman is on call tonight so Floo her if anything happens. You’ll let me know how it goes with
“Tell me about it,” Ron agreed. “I swear her skirt is getting shorter every week! If it wasn’t for Hermione, I’d have asked her out ages ago.”
“I can’t, Harry,” Draco shook his head, sadly. “I’m your Healer. No matter how much I might want to, I just can’t.”
The heat hit Harry’s face as they left the chilling night air behind them, his skin tingling as the numbness that had settled in started to recede.  He looked at Malfoy, unsure of himself now that they were back in the castle, but the Slytherin simply smiled at him.
patient and that this was wrong. Yes, all of Harry’s memories would come back to him; going to Hogwarts, playing Quidditch, Christmas with the Weasleys,
When he got home that evening, Harry decided that he needed a plan.  A plan that relied on subtlety and cunning rather than giving into his Gryffindor-ness and charging headfirst into the situation like he usually did.   And for that, he needed Hermione.
“Likewise,” Harry's tentative smile morphed into a grin and Draco thought that maybe London wasn't so bad after all.
Draco’s stomach dropped as Potter closed his eyes and buried his face in his hands, tears now unleashed and streaming down his cheeks. He could just make
Draco! He now had a name to match the pale, slightly pointed face he had seen in the mirror earlier. Bit of a weird name, if you asked Harry, but probably not that out of the ordinary in a place like this. Harry’s only experience of school had been the grey, concrete comprehensive in Little Whinging that he’d left as soon as he was sixteen. But this was something else.
Harry suddenly deflated as he pondered this.  Malfoy was right.  He’d been fighting Voldemort for as long as he could remember and the bastard had taken so many things away from him - his parents, his friends, his childhood - that it was no surprise really that all he wanted now was to be as far away from dark wizards as he possibly could.  Harry let out a sob of a laugh as the doubts and worries that had plagued him all summer began to clear.
And with a gummy grin and a “Four years or so should do it. Good luck, Harry” she disappeared in a poof of smoke.
Harry glanced around helplessly as he realised that now he actually had to try and make conversation with the wizard opposite him.
As they left the Hogwarts ground, Harry’s nerves that they wouldn’t have anything to talk about, that they’d walk in awkward silence until they reached Hogsmeade, dissipated.  He had never noticed how animated Draco was before but now, in this new light, Harry found himself captivated by the Slytherin; by the hands that flailed around wildly as he talked, by the face that lit up when he told a particularly funny story and by the smile, crinkling the corners of his eyes, that seemed only for Harry.
Harry turned to find Malfoy smiling down at him, and had he always been so tall?  In his hand he held a card identical to the one that Harry had been clutching anxiously only seconds before, the only difference was the number.  Printed on Malfoy’s card, in the same delicate black script, was #17.
“That’s brilliant, Harry,” Draco said smiling – the Gryffindor’s excitement was contagious. “Anyway, I just wanted to say goodbye before I left.” Harry
Something fun had turned out to be making the short walk to the local town and spending the day shopping. Never something he had particularly enjoyed – as a child all of his clothes had been hand-me-downs and shopping had been a painful affair of Harry trying not to comment as Dudley attempted to squeeze into clothes three sizes too small for him – Harry actually found himself having a nice time.
Draco scowled at her. “What do you mean by that?” he demanded, damning the uncontrollable blush that spread up his neck.
After a slightly awkward start in which he forgot all words in his vocabulary except “erm” and “um”, Harry found himself having a nice time with Cho. He picked at the generous slice of treacle tart in front of him as she moaned about her room mate (drinks milk from the carton). She sipped her drink and listened, chin resting in her hand, as Harry talked about living with Ron and Hermione (great so long as you didn't catch Hermione just before an exam). This is no big deal, Harry thought. It's just like hanging out with the guys at work or with Hermione.
“Ron,” Harry croaked.  “Just drop it.”  He needed a pain potion and he needed one now.  “And get my broom would you?”
“Draco,” Pansy whined, her best puppy dog eyes in place.  “We’ve been waiting here for ages.  Can’t we get some food and try again later?”
Harry chuckled, grateful for a distraction from the pain.  “Yeah, well, it won the match didn’t it?”
himself, and cleared his throat to cover his embarrassment. He looked up uncertainly at the man in question, fully expecting Harry to be confused or even
He nearly stumbled over his own feet in the hurry to get to the safety of the bathroom and slammed the door behind him in relief.  His pyjamas were soaked through with sweat so Harry discarded them on the floor, confident that the house elves would have them clean and returned to him in no time, and stepped into the shower.  As water cascaded down his back, he leaned his head against the hard tiles and tried to calm down his breathing, urging away the glimpses flying through his head and the hardness in his crotch.
Unable to stay still, Draco paced around his living room and thought about how happy Harry would be when he told him the good news. He could imagine the
“Hey,” Harry said, noticing that something was wrong. Draco jumped as Harry placed a hand on his arm, fingers brushing the disfigured skin of his inner
Harry ignored the loaded look that Hermione and Ron sent each other and smiled at Draco. “Great. Now, did someone say something about treacle tart?”
She turned to face him, concern in her brown eyes as she placed a delicate, manicured hand on his arm. “Draco, you know you can talk to me if there’s something wrong.”

After declaring stage one of the Operation a roaring success, the next day Harry pressed onto stage two: smiling.  Much the same as the day before, Harry apparated into the designated zone in the Hogwarts grounds, walked to the front of the castle, and greeted his fellow volunteers.  Only today, when Malfoy glanced up at Harry’s arrival, Harry sent the man a small but friendly smile.  Harry held Malfoy’s gaze long enough to see the return of the puzzled frown before he headed inside the castle.  From then on Harry smiled at Malfoy at every chance he got - when they passed each other in the ruined corridors of the castle, when took their lunch break in the Great Hall, and when they went home at the end of a hard day’s work – but for three days all Harry received in response was a look of total befuddlement before the blond would hastily look away.
Draco gasped. No! He needed those to remember... remember someone. Who? His heart ached even as his thoughts drifted towards the homework due next week. He'd have to spend all weekend working on his World History essay after he'd somehow failed the test earlier that term. Draco sighed and ran his hand across his face, pushing aside the nagging thought that he was forgetting something.
“Oh yes, Draco, I’m sure your intentions were very noble,” Maddie said sardonically. “Now shush so Harry can carry on with the story.”
Yes, Harry thought, as he closed his eyes. Because now he knew what he wanted and he was damned if he was going to let it slip away.
“Thank Merlin. I thought I was going to have to read another of the books Hermione gave me. Don’t get me wrong, she’s great, but these books are just so
“You don’t want to do that,” Draco said, reaching out and stopping Harry’s hand, “because then my queen can move in. What you want to do is move your
“Come on, mate,” Ron added, chucking on his coat and winding a bright orange Chudley Cannons scarf around his neck. “He’s actually a pretty decent guy once you get over the creepy tattoo and long history of mutual hatred.” Ron grinned but Harry was in no mood for jokes.

“That’s nothing.  Thanks to my mother, I once had to endure an entire evening with a date who ate nothing but raw squid,” Malfoy raised.  “Put me off the stuff for life.”
It was nearing the end of his shift and Draco was once again lost in thought about a certain dark-haired Auror. On his return from Harry’s room Maddie had
At the gesture, Harry was transported back to a dark September night over a decade ago. I think I can tell the wrong sort for myself. Malfoy’s fragile smile trembled and Harry wondered if he was reliving the same memory. To hell with it, Harry thought, before gripping Malfoy’s surprisingly warm hand in his own and being rewarded with a grateful look from the blond.
Draco smiled back at him, confidence building as his eyes roamed the man's face and felt an overwhelming surge of familiarity. “I'm Draco,” he said, holding out his hand.
“Oh,” Harry said, the smile falling from his face as his lips quirked down in worry. “I’m sorry if I was too forward. I just… I guess I thought that you
Harry thought. He remembered going to bed, dreading being woken up again by countless nightmares, remembered being at Ron and Hermione’s getting ready to go out. Where were they going? Somewhere outside – he remembered wrapping up warm and travelling by floo to a small village. He remembered lights and noise and smells and a giant flashing wheel.
“Yeah, well it bloody works.  Stupid Malfoy,” Harry grumbled.  “What was he even doing hanging around so late?  He always eats early.” His friends each raised an eyebrow.  “What?  He does!”
“Urgh,” Malfoy groaned, slamming another kitchen cupboard shut. “I can’t be bothered to cook tonight. Shall we just get a takeaway?” He looked at Harry pleadingly.
The remaining dates sped past but Harry hardly noticed.  His feet jittered uncontrollably beneath his seat resulting in more than a few odd looks and, before he knew it, the sound of the horn echoed through the room accompanied by a shout.
Draco hesitated, unsure about how much to tell them about Harry’s condition over Floo. “He woke up not too long ago and is sleeping at the moment. Why
“Now don’t hesitate to come back in if you experience any problems,” Draco explained to an elderly witch as he escorted her into the reception area of St
Hermione appeared in the staircase behind Ron looking out of breath.  “Ronald!” she scolded.  “Don’t just run off and barge in on Harry like that.”
Pansy raised an eyebrow sceptically. “Oh, nothing much. You danced around in your underwear, declared your love for Professor Sprout in front of the entire school and then jumped in the lake.”
Looking down at his message to Harry, Draco blinked, his grey eyes losing focus. What was he doing? Putting some last touches to his homework? He thumbed through the notes scattered over his desk. The handwriting on them appeared to be a mixture of his own cursive and another, all pointy and scratchy. Draco frowned as he tried to remember who it belonged to but the memory was elusive, lurking just out of reach. As he chased after it, the writing in front of him began to melt, dripping down the page until it was completely illegible and disappearing off the edge of the paper.
“Okay, so first I’m going to put you into an enchanted sleep which should keep you under until morning. Then I’m going to cast the spell and, if all goes

Harry sighed as a warm arm wrapped around him and a mouth pressed to the back of his neck in a kiss.  “Morning,” mumbled a sleepy Draco.  A hand trailed lazily across Harry’s stomach and paused when it brushed his boxer shorts that, thanks to his morning’s reminiscence, were tented in arousal.  “My my,” Draco teased, suddenly sounding much more awake, “what have we here?”
Draco sighed. Just another way he was going to let his parents down. He thought they might get over him not wanting to follow in his father’s footsteps, and
He took a seat at the Gryffindor table after many more prods from Hermione and glanced surreptitiously over to the Slytherin table, both relieved and terrified to see that Draco was still eating breakfast.  The blond, as if feeling Harry’s eyes on him, glanced up curiously.  His lips twitched in a small smile and Harry smiled back shakily, fighting against the nausea that was threatening to overwhelm him.  Draco tilted his head in the direction of the entrance hall and stood up confidently from the bench, leaving Harry to scramble up and follow him, ignoring Hermione’s whisper of “Good luck, Harry” as he left the hall.
“Sorry,” Draco muttered, still half asleep but ever polite – he was his mother’s son, after all. “Can I get you anything to eat?”
“Huh,” Ron grunted, wandering over to the tent. “Reckon it takes proper photos or just those weird standy-still ones Muggles have?”
“Harry,” the redhead shouted.  “What’s all this rubbish about you coming into the common room wearing a Slytherin scarf?”
Harry stared at his mobile phone in panic. It seemed that Draco had been busy the previous day if the countless unread messages were anything to go by. His group chat with Ron, Seamus and Dean had exploded with everyone demanding to know how Harry had managed to get a date with Cho. Then he had a text from Cho herself asking if he was free later to grab some lunch. And finally, Harry spotted a note that had obviously been left by the posh boy himself.
realised that he was still holding Harry’s hand over the chess board. Draco’s lips parted in astonishment as Harry slowly rotated his hand, the Auror’s
“Bloody hell,” Ron exclaimed, slumping down onto an abandoned booth. “What a night. I think my blisters have blisters.”
“That’s it!” Harry shouted, making Hermione jump. “The fortune teller! She told me my future and said that maybe I just needed a push in the right direction. She said that to help me she’d show me a glimpse of my future…”
Harry smiled, still not used to seeing Malfoy do anything but scowl and sneer. “Sure, whatever you want.”
“I mean,” Draco tried to rescue the situation, “that sounds great Hermione. Er, do you know if I have work today?”
At this point, all the other men had called it quits. They’d signed up to piss on someone, not watch him shit. Harry, though, remained. If anything, he was even more turned on the grosser everything got. Besides, this was Draco. He wanted to make sure he was still breathing. He slapped Draco’s face, lightly, trying to wake him up.
Harry pulled out. Without Draco being conscious, there was now nothing holding all that piss and cum in. It leaked and then sprayed from Draco’s ass, splattering on the plastic sheeting, white and yellow liquid, then brown, what had been in there long enough to mix with his shit. A trickle of vomit and spit still clung to Draco’s lips.
“You know there’s drugs for that now, right? Hell, I bet St. Mungo’s can probably cure it.” Harry was considering going there, himself. He’d fucked Draco bare, last night.
So what Harry did now wasn’t particularly extreme, for the two of them. He scooped up some of his own diarrhea and smeared it into Draco’s hair. The brown sludge mushed into the fine gold strands, staining them dark brown and matting them together. Draco shivered with arousal at the degrading act (or it might have been fever, who knew) and angled his ass to meet Harry’s thrusts.
. Draco craved to be dominated, humiliated, ego destroyed and obliterated—indeed, he ultimately desired his own death, his drives of eros and thanatos inseparably linked. Harry kept asking unthinkably extreme things, each time expecting Draco to say no, but he never did; and Harry discovered a streak of limitless cruel depravity within himself. He wanted to blame it on the piece of Voldemort’s soul that had inhabited his body for so long, but he knew it was not so. No, this was all him. So far, the only thing he had not dared to ask of Draco was irreversible genital mutilation, and even that was selfishly motivated—he liked being fucked just as much as Draco did, and if Draco were incapacitated, he’d have to buy a fucking machine, and then he’d have to clean the shit off himself to go sign for the package, and it seemed silly to buy such an expensive sex toy when he’d probably be dead in a few months anyway.
