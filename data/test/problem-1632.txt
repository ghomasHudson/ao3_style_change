felt a twinge of guilt at the idea that all the hard work Malfoy had done to rehabilitate his image would be destroyed, but he hardened himself against it. It was all a game Malfoy played anyway, what did it matter if it blew up in his face?
Rudolph Avery had been tried earlier in the month. The evidence against him was overwhelming. They had Muggle video footage of him entering the Sky Gardens and interacting with one of the Muggle victims. He had tested positive for polyjuice residue and the owners of the warehouse the bomb had been made in had positively identified him. He'd been given life in Azkaban. No parole.
He shook his head to get rid of the thought. 'That's bull,' he objected. 'You shouldn't be allowed to hide -'
'So, scared, then?' Harry says, leaning forward with a smirk. 'I have no power with the Ministry anymore.' He doesn't bother to hold back his bitterness as he thinks for a second just how true that is now. Every bridge he might have had is burned. The way they made him leave… he'd be damned if he ever went crawling back to them. He would come back at the head of one of the biggest cases in a decade, with Malfoy in chains, or he wouldn't go back at all.
'Will you tell me?' he asked instead. 'Some day.'
Harry flinched away and shook his head mutely. He needed her to go away. He needed it to be quiet and dark so he could find a skin to wrap around himself and hold everything in.
Potter turned up to his sixth appointment drunk. It was apparent the minute he stepped through the door. He stumbled into Draco and he reeked of the sharpness of Firewhiskey. Draco held him up as he considered for a moment, what to do. If it was any other client, he would've turned them away, made them come back when they were sober. But it had been three days since Draco had last seen Potter, and he was finding it harder and harder to wait between the visits. He couldn't go another three days. Besides, he thought as Potter nuzzled into him, now would be the perfect time to push for the secret Potter was holding onto so tightly.
He turned his gaze to the two pieces of paper that glowed with the strongest diagnostic results. They were membership forms by the looks of them, covering basic personal details before going into medical and criminal histories. Harry cocked an eyebrow at that. The vetting process was thorough. When he saw the membership fee at the bottom of the page his eyes widened. This was not something that just any Muggle off the street could walk into. If he didn't have his vault he'd be struggling to afford it, even on his Head Auror's salary. Harry shook his head, reminding himself he had no intention of paying the fee, so the value of it was irrelevant.
Harry nodded absently, pushing her gently away. 'You want a hand with him?'
He was headed home after a long day at work - a long week, really. He'd been working hard on a case all month and he had a feeling they'd finally cracked it. Ron had come in with the final piece of the puzzle and all they had left to do was put it together and draw out the arrests.
Malfoy raises an eyebrow at him. 'Is this Senior Auror Potter asking, or my bodyguard?'
Only Rothwell looks over, surprise clear in his face. Draco gives him a smile that is positively predatory before he turns away, collecting a drink from the bar and beginning to circulate the room. Harry's surprised by how many faces he recognises from Draco's surveillance pictures and the Pensieve memories. There are seventeen men in the room, most accompanied by one or more bodyguards, observant, hulking presences trailing silently behind them.
'Another Catalyst,' Mac said, not slowing her stride. 'One is not enough when we're going to be up against two forces simultaneously.'
He sighed, pressing a kiss to her hair, wondering when his need for that light had changed. 'I guess we're just not who we were back then,' he said softly.
Everything looked different in the daylight. The street was quieter, though the building looked just as impressive and imposing as Harry approached it. He realized with a twinge that, it being a Sunday morning, they may not be open and, being a Muggle establishment, he had no legal basis to push his way in. He ignored the small voice whispering in the back of his mind, that even if it had been a wizarding business, he would still require proper justification … if he was even allowed to perform the visit himself.
'I—I didn't mean it,' Ginny said after a long pause. 'It wasn't your fault. I know that.'
Malfoy's eyes are closed and the lights are out when Harry comes back out of the bathroom, but he knows Malfoy isn't sleeping. His heart is beating too quickly, for one, and there's a strange tension in the air.
Harry gives him a slightly pained smile. 'Is that alright? It's bloody weird coming in here and asking for it.' He sits back with a sigh as he looks around. 'Everything about being here is bloody weird actually.' He's being completely genuine now. Seeing Ron sitting opposite him, in his familiar Auror robes, talking about a case the way they had a million times before is bringing up more of his old feelings of anger and loss. He fucking
'I'm sorry,' Harry said, dragging his eyes away from the child, needing Draco to hear the regret layered through him. 'For the part I played in making that happen.'
The relief he felt at seeing Ladon's face was overwhelming and he felt his magic flicker and subside for a moment. The air no longer felt as heavy and charged as it had.
He tries not to think about how the idea of Malfoy disappearing makes something inside him feel empty.
Harry nodded, remembering Aoife's emphasis on the fact that killing the hosts would only set the force inside them free. He knew the truth of that down to his bones. He would never forget the spectral figure he'd seen wheeling above the crowded square.
He kicked his stand down and disillusioned his bike with a wave of his wand. He set repellent charms and a nasty hex over the saddlebags on the back of his bike which held all of his things and then moved towards the gates.
Harry frowned, trying to think. Malfoy hadn't reached for his wand, though Harry had had his out. 'No, I think it just started happening as we were talking. It only got really bad when I tried to stun him.'
Harry thought about being completely alone. He thought about being confined to the same place, day in, day out for over a decade. He looked at Lucius Malfoy and wondered if he were still sane.
Blaise started to hum quietly. Draco didn't register it immediately, but when he did, it made the pain twist higher inside him.
The thought of being around someone so much made Harry feel a little uneasy. He'd tried being partnered in the beginning of his career, but he'd found the constant contact difficult and after the third time he'd been brought before Jefferson for rudeness, anger or just plain inability to keep his partner up to date, they'd agreed he would do better if he worked solo.
'Talk,' Harry says, not taking his hand away from Malfoy's throat. He doesn't know if he believes Malfoy, or if he thinks this is just some crazy ploy to get Harry to let him go so he can go for his wand. 'You have two minutes to convince me why you shouldn't end up dead or in Azkaban.'
Harry sips his tea before putting it on his dresser and collecting a clean set of clothes. A part of him doesn't want to shower. Even after the wipe down and a night of sleep without Draco beside him, all he can smell is Draco and he loves it. But he knows he needs to. He sighs and is about to collect a towel when he thinks more fully about what's about to happen.
'Where's my wand?' Harry said, his voice hard.
Lucius frowned. 'Avery, again. That was when I started to realise he may not be as … stable as I'd hoped. He was to procure a small device, localised damage, low risk of fatality. The idea was fear - fear and anti-Muggle sentiment. Instead, what does he do? Stupid boy builds a faulty Muggle device large enough to level the building.' Lucius shuddered at the words and Draco felt a faint hope that his father had some remorse in him for those deaths at least.
Harry was watching him be bred by a Giant Squid and loving it. It was this thought that tipped him over the edge. Draco cried out as he came, the blunt club continuing to move in and out of his arse, prolonging his orgasm to the point of pain. He felt dizzy with it, wrung out, empty.
He imbued the memory with his terror, his sense of hopelessness. The cruelty and suffering that the house run by Lord Voldemort founded. He bottled his weakness, at not choosing the right side to fight on. He bottled the way it felt to look into those green eyes and realise that seven years of petty rivalry had overshadowed the fact that Harry Potter could complete Draco in ways he was only just realising.
Harry had stopped offering to touch the door after that.
He listens to Malfoy's heartbeat to distract himself from the pain. It's fast, but steady. Strong. Harry will be okay. They both will.
Harry scowls at the reminder that he's not what he used to be—as if he could ever forget it. 'I'm not an Auror anymore. I just want to know what the hell I've gotten myself into.'
Pheo hissed her displeasure at him, clearly disagreeing, but a moment later she was sliding down his arm and spilling onto the table in her eagerness. Harry felt something warm inside him when he saw what Malfoy was laying out on the table.
'What are you doing about it?' Malfoy demanded, dropping into a chair and waving his hand at the paper. 'This kind of rhetoric is dangerous. It has the potential to break down all the education, tolerance-building and reforms we've been working on for years.'
'That's it, love,' he groaned.
Harry lets his familiar bitterness go as he watches Markwell's gaze flick over him. His eyes linger for a fraction of a second on the bulge of Harry's arms, the broadness of his chest, the stubble he hadn't bothered to shave that morning. Harry uses a Glamour to do his job. Not a lot. Just enough to hide his scar, to change his eyes from green to a more common brown and to modify his features so that he isn't him anymore. Merlin forbid anyone find out just how low their Chosen One has sunk.
'Tease?' he asked, pushing at Draco's hips. 'Flip over and I'll show you a tease.' He swallowed heavily, licking at his lips. 'I still haven't forgotten what it felt like that time you did it to me.'
'Hmmm?' Harry murmured, not quite able to place what Ladon was referring to.
Malfoy makes a soft sound of surprise and Harry looks up.
Thank you for reading.
Draco felt heat flow through him at the touch - at Harry touching him, voluntarily. He felt the faintest tingle of Harry's magic against his skin, as though it was reaching out to him … curious about him. He remembered his own stolen touches from the weekend before - Harry had been blindfolded and Draco hadn't been able to help himself. Had
Harry woke with a start, groaning as consciousness came flooding back. He shifted, blinking groggily and looking around the room, disoriented. It took him a moment to realise he was in Sirius' room. And when he did he felt even worse. The sobering charm he'd used the night before left him feeling wrung out and sore, and he'd slept strangely, sprawled out across the unfamiliar bed. He groaned and rubbed at his eyes and then shifted again, suddenly aware of the friction against his hard cock. He'd been dreaming, he remembered … about flying.
'Nothing,' Harry said, then shook his head. 'Just -' he glanced at Scorpius. 'I didn't feel like being alone tonight and wondered if you wanted some company.'
Harry groaned as he skated a finger over his rim, feeling the furl of his hole. He concentrated and his fingers were suddenly wet. He arched his back to give himself a better reach and then groaned again, as he pushed lightly at his rim, before moving his finger away. He did it again and again, a light pressure, barely entering, barely giving him what he wanted.
, it whispers. Harry tells it to fuck off. He still has a day.
'I can't do this,' Harry blurted out, turning away from the grave. He pushed back through the crowd, shaking off Ron's hand as he reached roughly for him, and then others, pushing them away blindly. He had to get away. He had to get out. He couldn't watch them put his son in the ground. It would be real then. It would be real if that happened.
Harry left instructions with Mac about where Scorpius needed to be sent, then he sat, eyes closed as she Obliviated him, taking the directions from his memory. If he was going up against War, he couldn't be the reason that it found Scorpius again. He had no idea what sort of powers the thing inside Malfoy had. If it could draw on all of Malfoy's magic, there was a good chance it could use
'Authorities have identified the deceased as Eliška Nepovím, a well known local figure who had been involved in a number of peace-building projects promoting cross-regional security. It is unknown why she rose to become the figurehead of the Preservation movement. Her killer is also unknown at this moment. What is clear is that her death and the way she was killed has sparked anger among followers of the Preservation movement across a range of countries.'
He moves forward. There's a chamber up ahead. He can hear the way the air responds differently to the faint movement of their passing. He wonders if it contains anything that could be used as evidence. There had to be things stored down here, especially if they were coming down ahead of time to prepare for a drop.
He looks older now, of course, but older in a way that means he's grown into his angles and sharp edges. His hair is buzzed short at the sides and left loose and tousled on top. Harry lets his eyes flick down, noting that Malfoy's body hadn't changed when he'd dropped the glamour. He's still slim and tall, lean and strong under his designer clothes. He looks good. Harry feels a particular kind of disgust at himself for that thought.
Malfoy's eyes flick across his body for an instant and Harry smells a hint of arousal. It surprises him enough that he breathes deeper, almost unconsciously, but when he meets Malfoy's eyes, there's no hint of his reaction to the words. He wonders if he's mistaken. There's no way Malfoy could be interested in him, especially not after the conversation they'd just had.
Harry nodded. He could imagine the scenario. He'd played a similar game against Ravenclaw in third year. But he'd long ago learned that comparing pro-league Holyhead Harpies games to Hogwarts Quidditch days glory didn't go down well.
Then he dropped his gaze, looking at the puffy, raised welts shining red against his dark skin. They wrapped around his ribs and reached towards his chest. He shifted his arm, looking at the names tattooed across his ribs, and the way each had a line struck through it … almost as though each had been marked as paid. He shook his head to clear it, not ready to think about that.
reveal to Draco Malfoy. He knew what he was doing was wrong. It went against everything he knew and valued about the trusting relationship he built as a dom … but somehow he couldn't stop himself.
-----
Malfoy hesitated, 'I already told Granger and Weasley, sorry, I just - I needed someone to know. The Healers wouldn't let me in and -' he cut himself off abruptly and took a breath, sitting back in his chair.
Harry seemed to contemplate that for a moment and then he gave a minute shrug.
Malfoy grimaced, not looking at him. 'Every day,' he said, so quietly that Harry almost missed it. Then louder, 'Unfortunately the likes of me don't get to just "take off", Potter,' he said, gesturing to his robed arm in what Harry recognised was a reference to the post-war travel restrictions on war criminals. Harry cursed himself again - he wasn't going to get Malfoy to trust him by bringing up the fact that he'd been a Death Eater, let alone by blundering into things that clearly annoyed the man. He'd known Malfoy had been sentenced after Hogwarts, but he'd forgotten that some of the restrictions put in place had been long-lasting.
No, it was the loss of the Manor's contents that bothered him. He'd been denied access to the Malfoy libraries while his father had lived there, and now the Ministry was blocking him too. Harry had tried to inquire, but he'd been told Draco couldn't look at the books until they'd all been catalogued and verified to ensure none contained dark or dangerous magic. Harry had been ready to take the matter further, but Draco had told him to save his energy.
'Justin said you've been in and out of the Ministry all week. The Auror floor, no less.' Draco couldn't see her face, but he knew she'd be sporting a look of fake surprise. 'I wonder whatever could have drawn you there?'
Draco sagged with relief at his presence. He nodded and Blaise guided him to the bed, scooping up Pansy's thick woolen comforter and wrapping it over Draco's shoulders before pushing him gently down.
Draco nodded, slower this time at the reminder that he'd brought his son into this mess.
'That sounds great,' Hermione said. 'We're fine. Same old, apart from me not being home much, Ron has everything in hand, you know how he is.'
'Great, Potter,' Malfoy says, dropping his glamour as well. Something in Harry rumbles in pleasure to see his face and his voice matching his scent. 'Such a mature response.' Malfoy pauses, putting on an exaggerated face, as though he's thinking. 'All night, your reactions have been so exemplary. Really. An absolute paragon of Ministry pride you've been.'
Ron looked across at him and his cheeks flushed with what Harry knew was anger.
Harry looks at him for a moment, waiting for the words to make sense, then he nods, closing his eyes again as the dappled light of the forest swirls into movement around him. He feels like he wants to be sick, all of a sudden, and licks his lips, trying to swallow the sensation. His mouth is dry, parched, and he becomes aware suddenly that he's hot. His whole body feels like it's burning up.
for the last hour because you're too stupidly pigheaded to heal yourself?'
, Harry replied.
He looks at the paper in front of him, registering after a moment that it's blank. He tries again, frowning and gritting his teeth. A moment passes and the paper is still blank. It's like he'd faded for a second and lost the instant in time where he'd thought about betraying Malfoy.
'Right,' Draco said, voice ragged. 'Right. I love you.' He kissed Harry once more and then turned back to the squid.
Draco twisted again, his back arching fiercely and then he retched, a harsh guttural sound.
'To combat your enemies, you need to bring every possible force at your disposal to bear. You and I both know this. What harm is there, in gaining something you want, to help confirm that choice in your mind?'
'True,' Malfoy said, crossing his arms and leaning against the bench while he waited for the microwave to count down. 'But I like it. It's clever.' He shrugged. 'And when he's a bit older Scorpius can use it without me needing to cast for him.'
Malfoy laughed quietly, then smiled. 'He's wonderful.' His whole demeanor softened when he thought about his child, Harry realised, ignoring the twinge in his chest this thought gave him.
'Take a step forward. I want you to bend over the arm of the couch.'
Marchbanks watched him a moment, then looked back down at the papers in front of her. 'Your evidence consists of traces of magical residue found on the body of the second Muggle attacker and a series of letters between Lucius Malfoy and an unknown correspondent known as 'The Heir'?'
'What do you mean, the first person?' Harry asks, struggling to take that in. Surely not? He hasn't been hiding himself so absolutely this whole time, has he? 'What about your parents? Your friends?'
Harry ignored Hermione's small whimper of devastation next to him as she undoubtedly contemplated the loss of knowledge. His mind was racing ahead. 'Do you think it's malicious?' Harry asked. 'Can you just do a call out, asking for the new PRAT to come forward so you can figure it out?'
sitting on a side table, where Ginny had left it almost two months before. She'd liked to read to James, Harry remembered, but the memory felt old somehow. Faded.
'Impossible,' one of the men in the circle said.
Then he stops and takes a deep breath, looking at Harry. 'Right,' he says. 'What's the play. It's a trap, obviously. Davies, I assume?'
Harry's eyes flicked back to the ropes. He watched them swaying slowly. He watched them and he imagined them wrapped around his wrists. Imagined being helpless. Imagined
He could feel Draco smile into the kiss, then he stepped back, just as Harry managed to get his shirt untucked.
'I used to lie in bed at night and flash coloured lights into the water, to see what I could attract.' He toed off his shoes and opened his trousers, pulling them down and taking his pants with them. Harry made a soft noise of appreciation behind him.
Draco smiles and on Markwell's face, it's a vicious thing. 'My dear friend, John Davies, invited me. Of course, I hear he's not with us any longer, but I would be happy to take his place.'
'Your friends?' Harry asks softly. He's almost afraid to ask, but there's something about the quietness of the night and the whisky burning through his body that makes him continue.
Harry narrowed his eyes, impressed, despite himself. 'Okay. Him, in the corner. The one with the mustache who looks like he has a bear on his face.'
'If I'm in, I'm all in,' he said. 'It's not just about the scene.'
Harry shook his head. 'No, I do,' he said. 'I think you're all terribly inbred and your traditions are bloody ridiculous. I'm just surprised to hear
'I'd like to talk terms today,' Malfoy says, leaning back as well as he spreads his legs just a touch more. 'I'd also like to verify the product.'
Harry cupped his face in both hands and bent to kiss him, hard and deep. Draco moaned into the kiss, the feeling of Harry here with him combining with the sensations wrapping around every part of his body.
'Yeah, I - ah - got caught up in a - a case,' he said, a little sheepishly.
'Hi Scorpius,' he said. 'I've missed you. Sorry I haven't been around for a while. Your dad told me you're getting good at flying that Slipstream of yours?'
Potter froze for a moment at Draco's touch, and then he dropped his own hand, covering Draco's and squeezing it slightly. Potter closed his eyes again, tilting his head back as his hand tightened on Draco's. Draco could tell he was fighting his emotions again.
The sandy-haired man speaks. 'What do you think you're playing at?' His voice has none of the refined politeness of Rothwell's clipped tones. He looks angry, defensive.
'I've fucked everything up,' Draco whispered, anguish rocking through him. 'I always fuck everything up.'
before that. All the people he hadn't been able to save, starting with his parents.
He can feel the healing burning through him, as his wounds knit and close. They're hot and itchy and the process saps his strength. He wants to run, but he needs to rest.
As he got closer to the huge old oak at the edge of the lake, Harry's steps slowed. He glanced around himself. The slightly creepy feel to the forest in the semi-darkness had shifted into something more sinister. Around him the trees were silent. Not even the leaves were rustling. He hadn't registered the calls of the birds as they woke up for the day, but now, with that sound stopping too, its absence blared in his ears like a siren.
Malfoy's eyes dropped to Harry's neck for a second, and Harry realised he was rubbing at the leather strip he wore there.
'Fine,' he says, putting the plates in the sink and heading to the bathroom.
Harry wants to snap at him to just bloody open it, but he forces himself to bite his cheek until he can taste the hot tang of blood in his mouth. Too late he realises his mistake, as the wolf tastes the blood too and shifts in him, pushing its way closer to the front of Harry's mind. It wants out. It wants to fight and fuck. It wants to hunt and to mate.
The woman smiled at him and now there was a predatory nature to her gaze. He felt something in him stir in response. Something unfamiliar.
Harry smiled and gestured with two fingers for Draco to fall in behind him as he made his way to the entrance. They crossed the large, empty atrium together, Harry's booted footsteps loud and echoing, Draco's lost beneath them. It was dim at this time of night and it gave the place a slightly eerie feeling. Harry nodded to the receptionist, dozing at their post, as they scanned his wand, checking him in.
Draco shrugged. 'So we just figure out how. What do you know so far?'
He held his hand out and Harry deposited the pouch of coin in it. Malfoy hefted it for a moment before gesturing him to the same alcove he'd been in the day before. Harry breathed a sigh of relief to see it was empty, despite the other alcoves being taken. He looked around as he went, not sure why he felt driven to, but wanting somehow to focus on taking in the information around himself, and not just on his yearning to be thinking something that wasn't pain and fear and loneliness.
'I believe the upcoming campaigns are around Extension of Wizarding Law Protections to Sentient Magical Creatures and Muggle-Magical Educational Reform. But I would certainly be happy to put you in touch with the Board if you wanted to discuss other causes with them.'
Ladon drew back, licking at him again. Harry could feel how wet it was, how messy he was, spread open for Ladon to see. The thought turned him on even more. Ladon's grip on him had loosened slightly and he ground against the couch, the friction and the pressure sending his hips jerking, chasing release.
'Fuck you,' Harry says instead, running his hands through his hair in frustration. He can't get the nervous tension out of his body. The full moon is tomorrow night and he can feel it surging in his blood, pulling at him, trying to draw him into the change already.
But Malfoy is already shaking his head. 'No,' he murmurs, almost to himself. 'We'd need a third person to cast it, and we'd both need to be wearing our own faces, which would rather defeat the purpose.'
Harry felt her words prick at him - happy? Sure, neither of them had been happy lately, but was this a reason to - he felt his shock and incredulity turn slowly into anger as he focused instead on this 'other man'. This was his fault. He recalled late nights, notes about friends, last minute trainings.
Draco shook his head. 'No, we're going home soon. Why don't you go find Justin while I have a cup of tea with Aunt Panny and then we'll go, alright?'
'There's something very nice on the main stage soon,' Ladon continued. 'I want to watch it with you. You will wear your collar and you will follow me to our seat. Everyone will see you. Everyone will know who you are with.'
'You will also sleep afterwards.' Malfoy continued. 'Proper sleep, for the rest of the day.'
Malfoy nods confirmation of his words and swallows with a wince.
'Do you have any idea how strange it is to look in the mirror and see my own face every day?' his tone is light but his scent is layered with sadness and uncertainty.
'What do you want, Potter?' Malfoy said, wrapping his arms around himself as though trying to soak in some of the meagre sunlight above them.
'And what exactly do you need?' Harry says, trying to keep the anger out of his voice at the thought of Malfoy whoring himself out to Davies. He doesn't think he succeeds, from the way Malfoy's eyes narrow.
Blaise's hand resumed its gentle carding through Draco's hair and Draco let his tears fall. He didn't realise Pansy had entered the room until he felt the bed dip behind him, and then she was curled around his back, a warm and solid presence as she wrapped an arm around his middle.
Draco watched as Samael Ladon's face disappeared and his own emerged. He reached out to touch the mirror, tracing his fingers over a visage that looked so familiar and yet so alien. Sometimes he wondered whose face was the real one - whose life was the real one. He felt his body shift slightly, rearranging itself under his clothes. And as he settled back into the skin of Draco Malfoy, he felt the last of Ladon's confidence slip away, and all of the thoughts he'd been trying to suppress came screaming back, louder than ever. He winced and rubbed at his temples.
'So it was a good game yesterday?' he asked between mouthfuls.
'Do you mean to work for good, for evil, or for balance?'
The moment Ladon led him into one of the smaller side rooms and the door closed behind them, Harry pushed Ladon up against the wall, glaring into his face.
Did Malfoy deserve his suspicion? Harry had barely spoken to him in the last eight years, after all. Maybe he'd changed?
Then the adrenaline floods through him and he turns, grabbing his attacker by the throat and lifting him from the ground, throwing him back against the wall. He hits it, eyes wide and panicked for a moment before he slumps to the ground.
Draco's cheeks reddened a little further but he spoke anyway. 'Could eat here, more often, if you like.' He looked back at the telly and Harry got the idea Draco was avoiding his eyes.
'This is our public space. Patrons can choose to exhibit or to voyeur, based on their preferences.'
'Chicken carbonara okay?' he asked, looking at Harry. 'It's leftovers but it was a decent batch.'
The boy nodded eagerly. 'Aunt Panny made biscuits. Chocolate ones, made like dragons. I had
He stared at her, the words cutting into him.
Harry has to force himself not to let out the snarl building in his chest. Like fuck Malfoy will be going anywhere with this arsehole.
He went straight home, locked his Floo, warded his house and Accoied a bottle of Firewhiskey and the rest of his Gillyweed. He then proceeded to get blindingly drunk while he killed things on his Playstation. He considered at one point, early on, asking someone to come over. Considered maybe he shouldn't be alone with his thoughts right now. But then he thought of the response he'd get from anyone he knew if he tried to explain this, and he gave it up for a bad joke, taking another deep swallow from the bottle.
None of the men in the image were important. None except the one in the far left corner, almost hidden behind two others. Harry took another step closer to the image projected onto the wall, steadying himself with one outstretched hand, and frowned as he saw a small, satisfied smirk on a very familiar face.
Harry opened his mouth to argue, then shut it after a moment as he realised all an argument would do would be to delay the moment he could get inside the right room.
'Don't you?' Harry asked, looking Malfoy right in the eyes for the first time in weeks. Somehow in the face of the missing child, everything else sank into the background. No less real, no less important, but not what they needed to focus on now.
He feels the truth of it hit him like a punch in the gut. The wolf has lived three times, since Harry was bitten. He has had a choice about where he goes and what he does exactly three times in the last year. Every second of every other day, Harry has spent suppressing him, using his senses when he wants them, all the while despising them.
Harry opened his mouth to point him out and then paused, something in him cautioning him against making that connection public. He took a deep breath in, hand shaking as his heart started to beat faster. He could feel tension running through his body, and suddenly, he desperately wanted a smoke. He crossed his arms over his chest to hide the tremor in his hands.
As they got closer to the focus of the group, all he could see was the tiny mound of dirt, covered by a green cloth, made to look like grass. The idea was absurd, that this hole in the ground could be anything natural. Could be anything but the most obscene travesty.
Harry wants to shepherd Draco into bed once he finally recovers, letting Draco down to the floor and slipping out of him. Every part of his body is covered in Draco's scent and touch and he doesn't think he's ever felt this utterly
To his surprise, Malfoy laughs. It's loud and hard and there's no humour in it. 'It's been almost fifteen years, Potter,' Malfoy says. 'I've changed. I've come so, so far from that arrogant, misguided little prick.' He looks Harry up and down and his eyes are full of judgement. 'You know what's fucking sad, though?' he says, and he continues before Harry has a chance to say anything in response.
his head in a moment.
He unclips the bracelet as quickly as he can and drops it to the table. The moment it loses contact with Harry's skin, Malfoy jerks as though stung. He nods and then indicates Harry should put it back on. Harry eyes the thing, thinking about what he'd just discovered.
After a long moment he straightens, knees slightly shaky as he washes the evidence of what he's just done down the drain.
'The Ball is the perfect opportunity to set social policy trends among the elite of the wizarding world - Ministers, Voting Members of the Wizengamot, Education Board Heads, Business Leaders … and I'll be damned if we net less than twenty million on top of that.'
Draco shook his head, dropping his gaze from hers and running one finger around the edge of his teacup. 'You know it's not as easy as that, Pans. You know I don't do casual hook-ups.'
'And you don't?' Harry asked, picking up on her tone. He reached into the pocket of his jacket and pulled out his smokes, lighting one up with a flick of his wand.
, Harry told her.
Fucking
When Harry woke the next day, his mouth felt like a toilet and a headache thumped through his skull. He opened his rucksack and fished out the potions kit he used in the field. Hangover potion wasn't a standard item, but he'd been sure to make it one in his own kit.
He sighed and picked up a leaf, shredding it through his fingers. 'Sometimes I feel like I should be happier by now … and sometimes I feel like I don't have any right to complain.' He reached out to touch the familiar words carved into the base of the stone.
Draco seemed to sense that hesitation. 'I'm not a virgin, Harry,' he said, something in his face telling Harry that he wasn't quite as confident as he was claiming to be either.
Harry frowned. 'So the Hallows aren't the problem?'
'We'll glamour you,' he says. 'I'll go as me. That should be good enough to get us most of the way in. You just pick one of your identities and we'll think of a good reason for you to be with me.'
There was a pause and shuffling of papers as Javier stood and moved to the front of the room. Harry scanned down his agenda and at the first item on the page, he felt anger stir through him.
The voice calls again, and Harry recognises it. It's Teddy. He sounds terrified.
'Hello, Joseph, can I offer you a drink?' Malfoy gestured to the liquor cabinet off to one side, through a doorway into a room hosting a dining table that seated ten.
'That's lovely,' Harry said, putting his drink down on the bench beside himself harder than necessary. He sucked down the last of his smoke and dropped it in the dregs of the liquid. 'I'm glad you're getting help. Really, I am. But I'm fine, and I'm not interested in someone telling me what is or isn't real, so I'll give it a pass.'
Malfoy seems to be busying himself picking amongst the range of fabrics like a kid at a birthday party, so Harry turns his attention to Jonathan as the curtain swishes closed.
Harry jerked awake to the sound of a fire alarm blaring through the hotel. He sat bolt upright, pulling his hood back on with a curse and then rushed out of the room and downstairs. The foyer was chaos, as people poured down from the rooms above. Harry was buffeted as people moved into the space he was occupying, and he pushed through the panic, heading for the door.
Pansy raised a perfectly groomed eyebrow and said nothing.
He rode at first without conscious thought. He just let himself feel the simple pleasure of the wind flipping strands of his hair behind him and the roar of his bike between his legs. Eventually, though, he found himself steering west. It wasn't until he saw the sign reading 'Welcome to Wiltshire' that he realised where he was going.
'I try to be less of a prat than I may have been in the past,' he says with a shrug.
'The ropes,' Harry said. 'That first night, I saw you on the stage, with the ropes. I want that. Please.'
'What are you doing here?' Harry said, voice rough as he stepped forward to face Ron and Hermione for the first time in over a year.
'Are you home tonight?' he asked.
'I'll just be a second,' he promised, moving past Jeffries with confidence. 'I remember all the protocols from training. I won't contaminate any evidence. Promise.' Jeffries opened his mouth one more time and Harry touched his wand, sending a non-verbal Confundus his way. He hated spelling people, but he needed to know what the hell was happening. Right now.
Harry steps forward but Malfoy holds out a hand. 'That was only the first part, Potter,' he says. 'I would highly advise against touching.'
On the third day he woke up dreaming of Draco. Dreaming of their place together, of waking up beside him and lazy Sunday breakfasts and apologies made of kisses and coffee. He dreamed of the laughter of children downstairs and it made something hurt deep inside him.
'My wolf,' he says. 'I think he's a bit in love with you.'
'I didn't even know what BDSM was until I left England after the war,' Draco said and Harry leaned forward, crossing his arms on the table. 'I had a friend, a witch - Elise - and she was always making fun of me - how uptight I was. How on edge. I was a mess after the war,' Draco said, looking beyond Harry, as though reliving his memories. His face clouded and Harry wondered if Draco still had nightmares too, the way he did sometimes.
'Accessory to abduction of a minor: Guilty.'
Towards the end of his mid-week shift, Hermione appeared in his office doorway. Harry looked up, surprised. She almost never came to see him.
.' Harry felt the burn of tears in his throat again and this time he couldn't hold them back. He felt the sob rip through him and he fisted his hands in Ron's robes as he felt himself crack open again.
Harry tilts his head slightly to focus on the noise. It comes again and Harry debates for just a second before he closes his eyes, allowing a picture to bloom in his mind; an image of what is going on in the bed on the other side of the bathroom. He doesn't stop to consider whether he should listen. He still feels vulnerable, the tug of pack, family, connection, pulling at him. The strange, one-sided intimacy of listening to Malfoy pleasure himself soothes something inside Harry that doesn't want to be alone.
'You usually sleep naked?' Harry says, gaze flicking over Malfoy's attire. He phrases it like a question, although he knows the answer, has pictured Malfoy stretched out in his bed in the next room more than once.
Potter smiles and I feel the nudge of his foot against mine under the table.
'Sorry mate, clumsy me.'
'Everything about me screams safety,' Harry says, spreading his arms. He smiles, letting just a hint of tooth show.
Three hours later Harry was waiting at the park. He'd taken the collar off when he left Draco's and he could feel his magic dancing over his skin, wanting to play in the wind. He tamped it down, wishing he could find a way to lower the strength of it, instead of cutting it off altogether, the way the collar did.
'You are central to it,' Aoife said, looking at him with eyes that held a hint of sadness. 'You are a source of change. You can affect the balance. You can push it to life, or to death, or you can help us hold it steady. You have more power than you can imagine.' Her voice turned bitter and Harry remembered her accusation about him causing the first rising.
Harry groaned at the feeling of Draco's hands on him and he reached up to tug at the clasp of his robes.
'You want him to be interested in you, don't you?' Harry asks, looking up to meet Malfoy's eyes. There's a trace of heat in them and Harry ignores his reaction to that. 'He's a werewolf. They're incredibly possessive. It will make the wolf in him jealous. He won't be able to resist the idea that you've been claimed by another male.'
Draco cried out as his orgasm ripped through him, the pleasure overcoming him in waves. He slumped forward, disrupting Harry's image completely, but he could still hear the sound as Harry gave voice to his own release.
'I do,
'What is the meaning of this?' he asked, looking directly at a tall woman with the gold bands of a team leader at her shoulders.
Harry nodded. Of course he knew the Black Plague. He'd learned about it in primary school as well as in History of Magic. Twenty-five million people had died.
Ladon's mouth had been hot and demanding. His hands had fisted in Harry's hair - gripped his arm hard enough to bruise. He closed his eyes and ran his fingers over his neck, remembering Ladon's mouth on it, the scrape of his teeth. He felt a flood of arousal run through him and his cock jerked. He imagined Ladon behind him in the shower, teeth on his neck, biting him, hands in his hair - strong, hard body hot against his. His cock jerked again and Harry gritted his teeth, leaning forward so his head rested on the slick tiles.
Draco's wearing his glamour again when they return to Grimmauld Place. They'd agreed it would be best if his return to society could be managed alongside the press announcements about the case, to give it the best possible spin. Harry has assurances from Robards that they will have copies of an official clearing of Draco's record by the end of the week. He knows Robards isn't happy with him throwing his weight around, and it's insane to ask for someone's name to be cleared based on an Auror asking for trust, but fuck it. He's Harry Potter and if he can't use that just once in his life, what's the point of it?
The museum opened into a street across from Central Park. It took Harry about fifteen minutes to find what must be the Wizarding entrance. It was a small courtyard in a part of the building that looked much older. The crumbling bricks and stonework reminded him of Hogwarts. There were no Muggles moving around this area, and when Harry concentrated, he could feel the charms wrapped around the space. Instead of pushing him away, they seemed to be doing the opposite, calling him closer. There was something seductive about them, as though they were speaking just to him.
'- I thought I'd lost you. I was so scared. Draco, I'm so sorry. I can't lose -'
He knows his tone is sharp, and there's judgement running through it. To his surprise, Draco doesn't snap back at him, instead he smiles, and there's something dark and satisfied about it.
'Sometimes I think about ripping it all out and starting again,' Malfoy continued, still watching Harry in that queer way. 'But it was hers. It's what's left of her. Do you know how it is, Mr. Potter, to hold something as a monument to someone who has passed?'
'I want to be wanted,' Harry said, quietly. He closed his eyes and sucked in a deep breath. His last words were barely a whisper. 'I want to be loved.'
Harry shook off those thoughts and looked to Luna for some indication of what they should do next.
'I want to come,' Harry says, the subtext running through his mind.
'So, what,' Pansy said. 'You're just going to give up?'
Sue cocked her head to one side, gesturing at the case board, where a picture of Lucius Malfoy sat, glaring down at them. 'Yes,' she said. 'We've established that.'
'Here, if that's okay. The bullpen is crazy right now. We've called in teams from across the country and it's two to a desk. We've taken over half the bloody meeting rooms in the building, too.'
'You've been unable to locate the source of the issue?' Hermione asked one of the maybe Magical Reversal people and Harry turned to look at them, forcing himself to pay attention.
'Okay?' Harry called again, his voice cracking.
'I'm going to have a shower too,' he says, sliding his legs off the bed. He stands and stretches gingerly, though he feels infinitely better than he did the day before.
Harry gritted his teeth and forced his focus back towards the woman opposite him. She was still speaking and he wondered what he'd missed.
I freeze, my own toastie half way to my mouth. I have no idea what he means by that, no idea if it's bad or good.
Harry feels a small glow of satisfaction at the flow of words. Malfoy will undoubtedly take a while to trust him, but he's clearly passed the first test. He thinks about the information he was just given. The approach makes sense. He wonders again what Malfoy has been doing all these years, how he's managed to hide himself so successfully all this time.
He felt his heart sink at the same time that relief slid through him. He slumped against the bench and looked at the note, letting the whirlwind of the night catch up with him. Everything had happened so quickly - so intensely. He remembered the look in Ladon's eyes - pupils blown wide as he'd murmured Harry's name, pulling him closer and kissing him hard and fast. Harry closed his eyes, feeling a tingle of arousal slip over his body. Ladon had wanted him
'Strange. I think he's written me off, but the way he looks at Scorpius sometimes …' Draco shivered slightly, a haunted look coming into his eyes. 'He treats him like …  like Scorpius is this tiny version of himself to be moulded and shaped into what he needs. It's the same way he used to treat me, when I was a boy, before the whole world went to hell. It's not normal.'
'Draco?' Harry called, caution in his voice.
He stops walking and closes his eyes, feeling for the magic, mapping it out in his mind. The path from the gate to the room is strong. Most of the guests had Apparated through. Only a few, too new to the inner circle to be trusted, had been forced to walk like Muggles to the door.
He shakes his head and finishes his drink, leaning his head back and blowing the smoke up into the air in a smooth stream. Harry looks at the pale column of his throat, shining in the dim light from the kitchen on the other side of the room. He imagines crawling forward and rubbing his cheek there, rubbing it over the place Davies had touched. He imagines, just for a moment, burying his face in Malfoy's neck, right where it meets his shoulder, and breathing him in, licking along his skin, biting lightly. Not enough to break the skin, just enough to leave a mark.
'No, just going out. With a friend.' He realised his mistake as soon as he'd said it. Hermione's eyes brightened and she opened her mouth.
Instead he sighed and let the charm drop. As Harry flickered into view, Teddy's face lit up and he pulled out from Malfoy's arm, moving forward, towards Harry. But Harry's eyes were glued to Malfoy's face. A flicker of emotions passed over it - surprise, happiness, pain, chagrin, uncertainty. Then his expression smoothed. He didn't move from where he was, instead watching Harry, as though waiting to see what his first move might be.
Clearly they've been made, and Harry can't help but feel a trace of guilt that this is his fault—that Davies has sent someone after them because of the way Harry reacted at the meeting the day before. But he doesn't have time for those sorts of thoughts.
'What are you doing here, Potter?'
'Harry,' she looked hesitant, sad, her face showing none of the shock and anger he'd expected. 'I've ... well, for a while now I've been ... seeing someone.'
Harry sits back, watching the doorway Malfoy had disappeared into. He concentrates and he can hear Malfoy rifling around in something before there's the snap of a container closing. A moment later Malfoy strides back across the living area to him.
. Malfoy might smell better than that bloody club, but that doesn't mean Harry should be smelling him. He drops his glamour. It makes him feel more grounded.
Harry is full of nervous tension the day of the auction, pacing through his almost empty house. Ron has stationed Banks in the house for the duration—it's her job to coordinate the reports and ensure the plan unfolds the way it should. Harry wants to speak to Draco, but he'd gone to his room to dress for the auction and re-emerged only to move straight down into the room Banks has set as her command point.
kissing, Malfoy's tongue sliding against his, his mouth slightly bitter with the taste of firewhisky.
Harry felt the warmth spread lower and all of a sudden he remembered the dream from the night before - he remembered having Ladon's body hard up against his. Remembered the hard mouth on his. He flushed, dropping his eyes.
A moment later, the tentacle wormed its way against his hole again. This time, Draco relaxed, gasping as the tip probed inside him, slipping past the ring of muscle. It withdrew, suckers rippling against his inner thigh, popping and releasing, before it pulled itself back up, re-entering more firmly this time, drawing a grunt from him as it pushed its way inside.
'I see dad's got the boys ready for bed,' Harry said with a wry smile as there was another particularly shrill scream from upstairs.
'I feel good,' he said with a grin. 'I think it worked.'
The gates are closed, and Harry follows Malfoy's lead as he brings them into the shadow of an oak, its branches spreading out over the path. The fence is an easy thing to climb, thick stone with handholds everywhere. Harry glances back down to see the incongruous sight of Malfoy glamoured as an overweight, middle-aged Muggle in tweed, climbing lithely up a wall as though he'd trained for it.
'Or it can sting like an ant.'
Draco was wearing crisp black formal robes and his hair was slicked back, almost like he'd used to wear it at school. The look on his face was cold and impassive but Harry knew he would be a riot of emotions inside. They'd been exchanging owls all week, going over Draco's testimony - what he should say, what he should leave out. Harry knew that despite everything, speaking against his father was going to be hard for him.
As soon as he's done he reaches for Draco's arm. A crack of movement and they blink into a huge, dimly lit room. It's lavishly appointed, all glittering gold, silk, and brocade. There are chaise lounges dotted throughout, a raised dais in one corner and a well-appointed bar in another. Harry glances around, senses on high alert for any immediate threat, but none of the room's occupants pay them any attention.
'Oh, I get sufficient stimulation, child,' Lucius said, a half-smile on his face. 'You need not worry about your dear old papa's mental faculties. I have many things to occupy my day.'
There were only four words on it, but reading them set something on fire in his mind.
It was another hour before Harry decided the flock had fed sufficiently and they'd herded them back into the containment field. An hour of watching Draco fly more than he watched the birds. Every time their eyes met, Harry felt heat tingle through him. He could still feel the impression of Draco's lips against his, still taste him. He wanted it again, at the same time as he wondered what it meant, and if it was a good idea, and just what else Draco might want to do with him. Draco looked like he was similarly conflicted. There were all sorts of emotions playing over his face whenever Harry caught his gaze. Very clear among them was a sort of yearning need that kept Harry's tension simmering for the rest of the flight.
'Can you finish the shift for me?' Harry asked Jones, his eyes on Draco, who was looking a little lost, as though he couldn't believe what he'd just heard. He barely waited for her affirmative before he was across the room, pulling Draco from his seat. Draco stepped over the rail, his movements slow, and Harry put an arm around his waist, guiding him from the courtroom before the crowd had a chance to filter down from the stands.
Lucius was in dress robes, hair long and flowing over his shoulders. He looked around the court with his nose slightly in the air, as though he was bored by the proceedings. His eyes narrowed infinitesimally as they passed over Draco, but he didn't pause. Harry saw Draco's jaw clench, and he sent him silent strength.
The mix of smells is disorienting. He doesn't want to be smelling any of this from Malfoy, but no matter how bad it is, it's still far better than the same smells from strangers at the club. He throws a Locking Charm at the door that leads to Malfoy's room and then pulls his clothes off quickly, throwing them into the washing basket. He sees some of Malfoy's clothes already in the bottom and the thought—the
Ron grimaced. 'I think it all happened when you and Gin were in Greece a few years ago.'
'Would you like a hand with that?' Draco asks, arching an eyebrow but smiling to take the sting out of it.
Malfoy had done what he had. Another part of him wanted to smash the case to the floor - to let the fragments of the past shatter and let the specter of Malfoy's presence in his mind shatter with them.
'The same day and the same time each month,' Harry observed.
Harry strove to head her off before she drew who knew what conclusions.
Marchbanks rose from her seat and the courtroom rose with her.
Harry looked into Draco Malfoy's eyes, then he screwed up his courage, uncorked the bottle and swallowed its contents down. He felt the milky taste wash over his tongue and the effects spread through his body almost instantly. His head sagged forward and Malfoy caught him, murmuring quiet words as he laid Harry back on the stretcher, arranging his arms and legs comfortably. Harry spared another thought for how strange it was to have Malfoy touching him with something that wasn't a fist, or a boot.
Malfoy looks at the bed and away again.
'Draco,' he said, shaking him, cupping his face. 'Draco,
His eyes move over Malfoy and he forces himself to take in the details, to catalogue them, letting his training take over, making sure the Pensieve memory will be sharp, if he ever has to provide it.
Draco's hand came up to cover his arm, where the Dark Mark was on show. He rubbed over it, a look of sadness coming over his face. 'It's a way of trying. I know I can't, not really.'
He didn't expect to find anyone from this department who could actually tell him anything interesting - the techs in the ASS had been annoyingly tight-lipped - but he figured that if he lingered long enough, he might catch sight of some clue, some slip of the tongue, that told him where to look.
Molly gave him a soft push on the back and he took a step forward, stepping up beside Ginny, leaning towards her. She didn't blink; didn't show any acknowledgement of his presence.
'I don't think I've ever met someone with as many issues as you, Potter,' he said, as he handed over the bottle of Dreamless.
. Harry pulled Draco closer to himself, wrapping his arms about Draco's still form and holding him tight. He felt his magic rushing back towards him, eager to do his will.
'You wouldn't dare,' Harry said, trying to call his bluff.
'I've tried to talk to you about it. So many times. But you were always too tired or too busy or just watching something on that damned television and not even listening. I'm sorry, Harry. I'd planned to bring it up … to make some changes, after Christmas and all that is done. I didn’t want to - to ruin things.'
'Where's the boy?' he asked.
He felt as though he were moving in slow motion, while his mind raced at lightning speed, trying to process what he had just seen, trying to understand the awful majesty of it, the power that had radiated from it like a sun.
That same anger simmers inside of him, filled with resentment and pain. All of a sudden Harry wants to throw up. He throws the bottle over the edge, hurling it into the night so that it smashes on the road far below.
The laughter sounded again - it had a harder edge this time, colder - and then came the quiet words. 'Oh, Potter.' Harry recognised Malfoy's voice and he tried to make out some sort of detail in the absolute darkness surrounding him.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco nodded again, taking a few steps forward and sitting into one of the patterned armchairs.
'Not just fucking though, Pans,' he said. 'We're friends, outside the club. We - we went to the aquarium today. With Scorpius and Harry's friends and -'
The aeroplane didn't seem to be full, which meant there was a spare seat in the front section he could tuck himself into as he entered behind the last of the crew. The seat was roomier and more comfortable than he expected, and he made sure the cloak was covering his whole body before he put the same Muggle repellent charms up, stronger this time, as well as a Notice-Me-Not. He couldn't chance someone deciding to swap seats mid-flight, or to use this spare one for storage.
She hung up after a few moments. 'Mr. Ladon will be here shortly. He asked that I show you through to the blue room while you wait.'
'Big night?' Ginny asked, not looking up from the paper.
. He was wearing Charlie's body. Potter didn't want
'I don't think so, Potter,' Malfoy said, and his voice was cold again. 'Let's have a little look at why you're here, shall we?'
'Thank you, sir,' Harry says, feeling the spark of his hope catch alight.
Harry looked across at Draco, who was examining what looked like a mobile phone and pointing out its various features to Arthur. He smiled, slow and deep.
Harry grits his teeth, but he keeps his smile in place as he straightens. He has to work not to show that he's favouring his hip. Something in Markwell's posture makes Harry think of a predator sizing up prey. He has a feeling this is not a man to show weakness to. He pushes aside the grinding agony. If only that wound would heal the same miraculous way all his others do now.
He rubs a hand over his face and all of a sudden he looks tired, and the sadness is back, draping across him like a mantle.
'That's where you come in,' Maggie said, stepping forward, a wide grin on her face.
They landed side by side and Draco dismounted with a groan, dropping to his knees and then laying flat amongst the wildflowers. He put an arm over his eyes, not saying anything.
'Mr Markwell has become aware that some of his associates have been involved in illegal actions,' Harry begins.
Draco's cheeks pinkened slightly and he looked down.
Potter rejected him, he reminded himself with a grimace, time and again. Potter could have spoken for him at his trial. Potter could have given him a hand out of the darkness when he was finally released from the hell pit known as Azkaban. Potter could have done
Malfoy lets out a huff, so soft most people wouldn't have caught it. Harry's surprised to realise he's made Malfoy laugh. He narrows his eyes at the thought. Malfoy doesn't
He put that from his mind. He put it all from his mind. He needed to be Ladon. He needed to take control, to be strong, for Harry. So he could give him what he needed. Harry was the only one who mattered.
The men both nodded and Malfoy Apparated away.
Draco let his triumphs and his tears and his weaknesses flow from him, laying himself bare before Harry, showing his all.
Ladon met his eyes and then looked away.
Draco groans again, his body tense as he seems to be wrestling with something, and then he speaks. 'Can you hear any of the others yet, or is it still just Banks?'
him. The concept still seemed to big to encompass.
Rick's eyes snapped to Harry's at that. They were a pale blue and there was nothing warm in them as he smiled in greeting and reached out his hand.
Harry watches him go, feeling a mixture of confusion and desire. He sits in bed in just his pants and tries to think about what had happened the night before. The last thing he remembers is Malfoy talking him back into bed after he'd dreamed of Teddy, and then the touch of Malfoy's hand on his hair.
'I'll transfigure the table,' he says, standing up and gathering his notes to himself, shrinking them down.
Harry watched as the image of himself reached across to cup Malfoy's face, drawing him into a kiss, before tilting his head to whisper in Malfoy's ear.
Harry shook himself, trying to focus. He'd been all over the place since he'd seen Malfoy's head shot the day before. Something about Malfoy's eyes just wouldn't leave his mind. He wished for a moment he'd dug a joint out before he took the taxi, just to settle his nerves. It had been a long time since he'd been in the field, since the early days where active cases had been destroyed by rushing fans wanting a piece of the Saviour - since he'd misjudged his Polyjuice and transformed part way through a raid, leaving Jeffries undefended to take a hex that had him in Mungo's for months. Harry took a deep breath, shaking his head and focussing on what he could see, trying to ground himself.
Harry shrugged. 'If there is, we haven’t found it yet. We're not ruling anything out, but …' He spread his hands as if to say it was unlikely.
done.
'Do I look like I'm joking?' Malfoy deadpans, voice just as hard. 'You've known my identity for the last forty eight hours. I need to know, before this begins, if I have an ambush waiting for me when I leave this room. Now take the fucking Veritaserum and answer a few questions for me.'
He moved through into the Obliviators' wing, as though he hadn't noticed anything, and began the whole process of poking around again. This time he started to ask specific questions, just casual ones, as though he was after gossip. He hated gossip, but it had to be done. Tracking people wasn't so different from tracking creatures. You just needed to look for a different kind of trail. 'Have you seen someone around lately? Black robes? From a different division?'
But Hermione just gritted her teeth and pushed to her knees. Parkinson's eyes widened for a fraction of a moment and Malfoy snorted softly. That seemed to be enough to jolt her into action. She moved forward as well, opening her mouth to say something.
His wolf whines inside him at the thought of being trapped during the moon.
He wraps a towel around his waist and leaves his room, walking down the hallway to knock on Draco's door. He can feel the wards on the room, and knows they will alert Draco to his presence if he doesn't wake to the knock.
'Scorp' nodded his head eagerly, and then leaned forward, 'Are you Harry Potter? Teddy told me heaps about you. Did you really beat my papa at Quidditch?'
Harry was gone. Harry had left and he was never coming back. That thought seemed too big to comprehend, and Draco felt himself shrink away from the reality of it.
Malfoy crosses his arms and leans back in his seat, as though daring Harry to argue with him. 'I use arousal because it's an easy scent to fake and it tends to mask most others. If the wolf is into you and you play it right—use the right poses and gestures to trigger his instincts—you can have him begging at your feet and ignoring every other reading he gets from you.'
in his presence. He sneers and taunts and provokes. What the hell is he playing at?
a voice whispers in his mind, and Harry knows it's not the wolf, but it is the truth. Draco would have taken this case with or without Harry. Any other bodyguard would have been slaughtered by the rampaging silver wolf the night before.
Harry couldn't help the grin that spread across his face at those words and he snuck a glance across at Malfoy as he said, 'He looks very special indeed. You're a lucky boy to have such a wonderful friend.'
'Be that as it may, Head Auror, the Court must make decisions within the laws. You are granted a warrant to search the warehouse, the factory, and the Avery residence, based on evidence gathered.'
He tries to ignore the immediate spike of anxiety that thought gives him. The longest job he's taken so far is three weeks and he'd timed the dates carefully for that one.
'Harry Potter is probably the last person I would have expected to see here tonight,' Zabini said with another smile, releasing Harry's hand.
He stood in front of it for a moment, mind racing. Jeffries had been here. He would have checked all the rooms. Man blundered like no other. So what was behind the door?
'Yes, dear,' Harry said, a hint of familiarity creeping into the words before he flushed and looked down at his food. That familiarity belonged to the Draco he lived with in the dream, the one who bossed him around and looked after him and always thought he knew what was best. It didn't belong to Malfoy.
Ladon leaned across, his grip shifting from Harry's shoulder to the side of his jaw, as he urged him closer to murmur in his ear. 'The man who's just pulled out a paintbrush is Jonathan. He's an incredible artist. His canvas for tonight is Matthias.'
The mental image made heat burn through him and he caught his breath.
premiere event of the year. Anyone who's anyone wants to be at the Malfoy Solstice Ball. I'll have six hundred guests there - including internationals. And the cheapest ticket is ten thousand Galleons. I'm having a Phoenix-level entry this year - one hundred thousand Galleons.' His smile widened at Harry's dumbfounded look.
The Ministry came to life in front of him. Harry looked down to see himself dressed in a pair of ripped jeans, his scuffed trainers and his Matrix t-shirt. His Auror robes were unbuttoned and hanging loose and he got a few odd looks as guests came to and fro across the Atrium floor, checking into various areas for the day.
He let himself feel the movement for a moment longer, let himself imagine James before him, smiling up at him as he reached out, hands grasping, begging to be lifted into the air.
'Hey, Gin,' he said, voice hoarse. She didn't respond to his words. Didn't look up from her intense staring at the hole in front of them. Harry wondered, as he watched her, whether she imagined as well that if she stared hard enough, she could will James back to life.
Aunt Burke turned to him, shaking her head. 'Such a beautiful girl. It's a shame she's already snapped up.'
Jones' eyes widened and she looked faintly ill. 'You think another wizard is behind this? You think one of our own is attacking us?'
Then Ladon was in him, sliding in, hot and deep, filling him up. Harry cried out, clutching at him, pulling at him. Needing it. Needing it not to stop. It couldn't stop. Ladon's hand was on his cock. Too much and not enough all at the same time. Ladon's movements were fast and hard as he panted above Harry, words tumbling from his lips, praise and love and pleasure. All Harry could feel was Ladon, on him, in him. He felt himself losing touch with everything else - felt like Ladon was becoming a part of him, like he was all that mattered.
Malfoy looks like he's just woken up and his hair is a dishevelled mess. A voice in the back of Harry's mind whispers that this is strange—this is not normal. But the rest of him murmurs of care and safety and protection. The wolf inside him presses forward and Harry doesn't try to prevent it.
'Down,' he says when Harry raises his head, bleary eyed, lost in the taste and scent and feel of him. 'Put me down,' Draco says and his voice is raw, wrecked. There's such naked wanting and longing in his eyes that Harry bends to take his mouth in another hard kiss. He thrusts up against Draco again, rutting against him, unable to help himself.
'You stupid, stubborn man,' she said into his neck, her voice muffled. He felt the wetness of her tears against his skin and brought up his arms to hold her close, resting his cheek on her hair.
Harry felt warmth flow through him at Draco's casual assumption that he was planning to tell Harry about this part of his life, and it had only been a matter of timing and circumstance that had stopped him.
'Darius Markwell,' Draco says, stepping forward, and Harry returns his attention to the men in front of them. 'I'm here to purchase some Peonies.'
'I need you to take a break, love,' Conor said, reaching out again and gently pulling her headphones off, to sit around her neck. 'Get Cara in here for an hour. Harry,' Conor tilted his head and Aoife turned to him, seeming to notice him for the first time, 'Harry is a Catalyst.'
Malfoy is shaking his head before Harry has finished speaking. 'You're wrong, Potter. I told you I know weres. I've met a number in my line of work—there are so many now, it's hard not to. The reason they go feral is because of how they're treated, nothing more.'
Harry shook himself. That was a distraction. It was all a distraction. He'd only kept going back because he wanted information about the case. Because he wanted to be the one to solve it. Thinking about the case made Harry think about work. Had Jeffries had any new leads in the last few days? Harry hadn't noticed any surveillance around the bar. Had there been any more disappearances?
With that thought he looked up, looked past the woman and the child, to see a figure on a horse.
The Muggles hadn't stopped travel between borders yet and it only took him a few minutes to invade the minds of a few dock workers, locate a ship that was headed to Liverpool, and stow himself on board.
He took another deep swallow of the whisky as he felt the pain rise inside him again, the emptiness so all-consuming he knew he could drown in it if he ever stopped moving forward. He closed his eyes, swaying slightly as he sat on the edge of the cliff. He thought about James' unsteady steps, wobbling across the bedroom floor to him. He remembered his pride at that milestone. His breathing was coming faster and faster now, heart beating hard in his chest.
Tedah, you're a champion. I'm so glad I get to be a part of your writing journey now and shower you with some of the love you've showed me.
Does what he's feeling come from him? Or is it just the bracelet—the bond? He thinks about Malfoy's reaction to waking up with Harry wrapped around him. Is that why Malfoy was so uncomfortable with the whole thing? Does he know it's fake? Does he feel guilty for the way Harry is being manipulated?
Draco rolled his eyes. 'I'm doing all the work, Potter, and you're just sitting here.'
Draco held out his hand and Harry took it, with just a hint of hesitation, as though he were telling himself he shouldn't.
Potter hesitated a moment longer, but Draco could see how torn he was. Every line of his body was filled with a yearning desperation. A part of Draco wanted to laugh, wanted to shout at Potter,
at least, had drains in the corner. He'd had them put in the last time he had to hose out the office after he'd had a Hippogriff in it for a week, pending trial. He'd refused to let them house the beast in the Auror cells, instead he'd conjured a huge nest for it and had enjoyed talking to it each day as he filled reports and catalogued sightings.
Harry ignored her raised eyebrows. 'Where's Ladon?'
'Are you fucking kidding me?' he demanded, voice cold with rage. 'You just kidnapped my son and you want to reminisce about old times?'
Harry moved in her, focusing on the trails of almost-pain down his back. He moved faster and faster, the image of the spiked wheel he'd seen at the club flashing into his mind. He wondered what it would be like to have that dragged down his back, pinpricks of sharp, hot pain, lines of red marks against his dark skin.
Harry swayed slightly on his feet and Draco felt his heart lurch at the sudden uncertainty on Harry's face as their eyes met.
Malfoy paused for a moment, his finger moving to hold his place on the page. Harry noticed his cheeks were slightly flushed and he wondered, for the first time, just how Malfoy experienced the dreams. Had he just come too? The thought sent a curl of heat through Harry and he caught his breath.
'Should we try and contact Davies again?' Harry asks as they're packing everything up. He doesn't want to. The idea of going anywhere near Davies again makes a possessive anger stir deep in Harry's chest, but he could still be useful as a lead.
Harry flips him a two-fingered V and refills his glass, moving over to the couch and slumping into it with a groan. The whisky burns through his system faster now that he's a were, but it's still left him feeling pleasantly tipsy.
The words were spilling from Harry's lips before he could think about it. 'Please, Draco,' he groaned. 'Please. Fuck. Please touch me.'
'I am happy,' Draco said immediately, a knee-jerk reaction to the words.
Malfoy opens the door and rummages in his suitcase for a moment before he brings out a pale blue cotton shirt and a rolled up undershirt. He touches Harry's arm to turn him so he's facing the car.
But ever since the incident, those feelings have intensified. He loves Rose now with a fierce protectiveness that means he would lay down his life for her. It's built into his very DNA. Pack. Cubs. Protect. He'd struggled against it when he was first bitten, convinced that he was wrong, that he was sick and that he shouldn't be anywhere near any of them, but Rose especially. She was too young, too weak. He was dangerous. A monster.
'You think this is the right choice?' he asked Hermione and she nodded, her eyes clear and certain.
'Perfect,' Draco said, leaning in to kiss him again. It went on a second. Two. Lips and then tongue entwining. Harry moaned into Draco's mouth and then Draco pulled away, picking up the end of the rope and beginning to wrap it around Harry's right bicep, wrapping it in loops a few finger-widths apart, each one tied with its own knot, working their way progressively down his arm. When his arm was wrapped to the wrist in circles of rope, Draco moved to Harry's left side and started again.
He looked back when he heard her throaty chuckle and she handed the package to him.
There's no way he'll push it though. He's not what those kids need. Safety and comfort and reassurance and some way to begin to understand what they've been through is far more important.
Malfoy turns that way immediately, picking his way back through the room as Harry follows behind him, looking at the audience, as though searching for some sort of threat. He doesn't know why he bothers. They're all clearly captivated by the sights in front of them.
Harry felt the words flow over him. Felt that same restlessness rise in him again. He wanted that. Wanted it more than he'd realised. Maybe it was just the time of year - the anniversary of his parents death approaching. Maybe it was the fact that he would be thirty next birthday, and he couldn’t stop thinking that his life wasn't what he had thought it would be by now. Maybe it was the night he'd just had. The same night he'd had every few weeks for the past ten years.
. In Muggle religion, they name them Conquest, War, Plague, and Death. I think over time the forces have come to like those concepts.' Conor gave a smile that was almost wry. 'We've certainly seen them choosing to confine themselves to those forms more regularly in the past few hundred years.'
Malfoy shrugged. 'You wanted Hogwarts and you didn't want the girl Weasel.'
, his wolf rumbles happily.
Malfoy shrugged again. 'Nothing. It's just a dream.'
This sense of limbo - of not knowing - was wearing on him. He wanted to do something about it, but knew that if he did, if he wanted to make something between them, he would first have to close off another thing. He couldn't continue seeing Ladon. He would have to go and see him again - one last time - to tell him that. He couldn't continue to chase a man who had made it clear they could have no future together. It wouldn't be fair on Draco to have Harry come to him like that - his wanting split two ways.
Harry looked over the spread in front of him, and wondered what to do next. People had reasons for wanting to start again - all sorts of reasons. His gut - what he'd experienced at the club - told him Ladon was not a criminal. He was not using the club for dark purposes … should Harry just look the other way?
Luna smiled back at him. 'Hello, Conor. I'm not visiting for myself. I've brought a friend.'
One of the tentacles moved closer, pushing through the magical barrier without letting any water seep through. It was easily as thick as his thigh at the place it joined the squid's body, but the end reaching towards him was delicate, three fingers wide at the point, and almost gentle as it twined its way through the air.
Ginny looked sad, but she nodded.
Harry waved at her to continue, uncomfortable with the admiration on her face. And she didn’t even know what he'd
'Why not?' Malfoy says, and there's such casual, unshakable confidence in those words that Harry can't help but hear the truth of them. Connections start to form in his mind, things falling into place the same way they had when he was an Auror.
Harry groans and Malfoy brings both hands up to grip his arms and balance him. Harry's head comes to rest on Malfoy's shoulder and he hears the tiny catch in Malfoy's breathing at the movement.
-----
The sun was starting to set when Harry walked over to where Ginny was sitting on the swing, kicking idly back and forth as she watched the children playing and waited for Aiden to get back with her drink.
'The resurrection stone is gone,' he said. 'It's lost in the forest and that's where it needs to stay.'
When he saw Geraldine Shafiq making her way over to him, his great-Aunt Belvina Burke trailing behind her, he hid another smile. People were so predictable. Push the right buttons and you could make them do whatever you wanted.
Harry cracks it and tilts the beer to his mouth, letting the cool taste of it wash over his tongue as he tries to come to grips with this new realisation.
'I wrote to your Mind Healer,' Draco said, and then he could have kicked himself. There were a million more appropriate times to have that conversation than right now while they were naked and wrapped around each other.
'To the inheritance,' Avery said, as though it were obvious. 'To the true order. To the replacement of what was and what should be. To the glory days that will come again.'
. He never had been any good at tracking Apparition. He stared at the place Malfoy had disappeared from a moment longer, before he cursed to himself again and turned away. There was no point trying to guess where he'd gone to now. Harry would just have to track him that night. Nine o'clock, he'd said. At the Plaza.
'Where are we going, anyway?' Harry asks after he climbs in.
Draco shrugged, uncomfortable under her scrutiny. 'He - well, he knows Samael is a front … but he never really asked who I actually was …' He trailed off, aware that the excuse was flimsy. Harry hadn’t asked because the man he'd had all his dealings with - Samael Ladon - had given no indication that he knew Harry personally. That he, in fact, was the last person Harry Potter should ever trust, or be vulnerable in front of or reveal every single one of his deepest darkest fears and pains to.
'Drop yours too,' Harry says, letting some of his former authority bleed into his voice. He'd been a legend in the Ministry. There is nothing he won't do to get back there.
Malfoy laughs and the sound is surprisingly happy. 'Your face, Potter. It's like I kicked your crup. You can ask me one of the questions. Will that wipe the pout off your face?'
He rolls to his side, as though he's done and is just moving into the next exercise, and catches Malfoy's eyes on him from across the room. His look is filled with heat and Harry realises, belatedly, that he can smell Malfoy's interest in the air. Malfoy looks away, busying himself with his papers.
Hermione laughed too. 'Yes, well, be that as it may, I couldn't have done it without you.' She looked at him seriously again. 'And don't worry about Javier. The man couldn't see sense if it stepped in front of him and slapped him in the face.'
watching the two of them.
Draco showed Harry his first experience with BDSM and his knowledge that he could heal himself and help others reach that same healing.
He took another step back from the room, from that melancholy voice.
Draco's fingers clenched into fists. 'Yes,' he gritted out after a moment. Harry willed him to go on, to explain himself, but he stayed silent.
'I have to eat,' I say, my standard response when someone asks me why I can't just come out, just as friends, nothing more.
'We were friends, once,' Malfoy said and Harry laughed bitterly, turning back to him.
Pansy continued as though he wasn't still speaking. 'That's not the same as having someone - a partner. I don't think you've been truly happy since she passed - before that even, before she got sick.' Pansy raised a hand as Draco opened his mouth to object. 'And that's okay. You loved her. We
'Say it,' Malfoy said, his voice hoarse with need.
He strode straight though the doors of
'Are you still flying?' Draco asked, though he knew the answer, had seen it in Healer Jeffries' report. Potter hadn't been doing anything for months now, anything but existing.
'How are you feeling? Have you eaten?' Malfoy asked. Harry nodded his head with a murmured 'Fine,' in answer to both questions, but the mere thought of food set his stomach growling. He hadn't eaten since he'd grabbed a pie at the Ministry cafeteria at lunch time.
They eat in silence when it arrives. Malfoy raises his eyebrows at Harry's heaped plate, but doesn't comment. He's got two pieces of toast in front of him, a thin layer of blackberry jam on each one. His mouth will taste sweet when he's finished, Harry muses, as he piles his fork high. Then he pulls himself up, wondering where the hell that thought came from. He glances down at his bracelet and grits his teeth.
'Do you—' he hesitated, unsure how to phrase it and not wanting to do anything to cause Harry to want to move away. 'Have you had much contact with your friends? Spending time with other people could make you happy, too?'
Harry looks at Malfoy's reflection and sees Malfoy's eyes moving slowly up his body as Jonathan speaks about cuts and fits. Malfoy doesn't
'Yes, sir,' he whispered.
Then there's everything Malfoy had told him; his treatment at the hands of Aurors Harry had worked alongside, had considered his friends—good guys. Was it little wonder Malfoy had done what he'd done? Had he really been given any choice?
and other Catalysts like you, can challenge them.'
Harry turned back to the photos, his eye catching on the one of Malfoy again. He'd only met little Scorpius once, but the idea of something happening to the boy … he turned away, resolving to owl Malfoy on his next break. He'd inform him of the danger himself.
Luna looked across at him, eyes not focusing in the right place. 'Oh yes,' she said. 'Many times. My father consulted with them often on his journey for the truth of the Hallows.'
No, this was not Astoria in the bed he'd shared with her for the entirety of their marriage, but that was okay. Somehow he thought she'd be happy that he'd finally found someone to share himself with.
'Do you think Weasley will buy it?' Malfoy asks and Harry has to think back over the last few minutes of conversation he'd been half taking in.
They'd had to let him turn, that first time, had to see if he was full wolf, or only just affected, like Bill. If only he could have been like Bill.
Harry shook his head. 'No, bread is no good for them. It's corn and lettuce and seeds. Things they could find if they were walking around looking for their own food.'
Draco sat on the bed, pulling his legs up and bundling himself inside the blanket. Blaise sat down beside him, putting an arm around Draco's shoulders and bringing him close.
Malfoy raised one shoulder in a half-shrug. 'You can have it back when we've … talked.'
'Wha—' Draco caught himself, setting his cup of tea down with fingers that trembled. 'How would that even be possible?'
Harry nodded, feeling relief flow through him. He'd been lied to a million times over his career. He knew what lies looked like. Ladon, looking into his face and speaking those words, was not lying.
'It will be fine,' Harry says again, dropping his head between his arms and focusing on his breathing. 'Wrap me up. We need to get out of here.'
The snow had spread through the entire Ministry, just like the other weather patterns had. Harry saw people everywhere he went, scrambling for coats and warming charms, putting files inside drawers and sweeping small drifts of snow off their desks. Harry went back to his office first and pulled on a woollen jumper then picked up his heavy black oilskin. He slipped it on and pulled the collar up, then cast the warming charm again.
'Are you alright?' Bill asks, speaking softly into his ear.
He played until the sun came up - resolutely keeping thoughts of Malfoy and his resulting anger out of his mind - then showered and went in to work. Ron didn't visit his office, but then Harry hadn't been expecting him to. There were probably all sorts of Important Tasks Ron had to do.
Ladon's eyes widened briefly, and then he composed himself.
'There is absolutely nothing funny about you luring me here under false pretences,' I say, as though he's the whore and I'm some innocent he's trying to lead astray.
'Since she passed, he's been different. He's been … secretive. There are layers to everything he does. There always have been, but sometimes he says things, things that worry me. About the future, and the need for change.'
'I know mate,' Ron said softly, in a voice that was wet with tears. 'I know.'
'This is yours?' he asked, tossing the lid onto the bed and reaching inside.
Harry felt his mind racing. What day was it? That was supposed to be on Sunday. Wasn't it?
Malfoy took a step closer, teeth bared as he looked Harry in the eye. He let out a hollow laugh that was filled with a pain that tore at Harry, bringing his own dormant grief to life. The air filled with a static charge that made Harry's skin crawl.
It's been far too long since he got laid, clearly. Twelve months, maybe longer. But since the incident he hasn't even tried to pull. Hasn't touched anyone intimately. Has barely even touched himself that way.
Harry hears the clanking of pots in the kitchen and turns his mind to Malfoy. He'd been out of it last night, absolutely vulnerable. Malfoy could have done anything—could have ensured he wouldn't wake up—but here Harry is, shaving in a bathroom that smells like Malfoy's come while Malfoy makes him breakfast. Harry shakes his head at the thought and finishes, clicking his shaver off.
Malfoy rolled his eyes, going back to the fridge and pulling out a bowl of pasta.
He couldn't stop thinking about Draco - about
'I won't beat around the bush,' he says, giving Harry a smile that reminds him just how long he's known Kingsley and how well the man knows him.
, as they were known here, walking down the middle of the road in daylight, but it didn't hurt to be vigilant.
'Fine,' Harry said. 'The only threat you've had against him has been the photos from the Muggle Killings cases, yes?'
-----
Harry didn't even have to think. He shook his head and pulled Draco's mouth to his.
'We support balance,' Daniela said. 'Unfettered life is no less dangerous than unfettered death. We filter the life of this site through the death that surrounds it. We keep both safe.'
Draco closed his eyes and leaned his forehead against Harry's. He took a deep, unsteady breath, feeling his heart racing in his chest as he made his decision.
Harry steps up to the podium and takes a deep breath as he looks out at the assembled crowd. His nerves are buzzing and he feels his wolf pacing restlessly. He can hear the other crowd outside the Ministry doors, the protestors, the families of those taken by the wolves. Their mood is ugly. Angry. He tries to block them out. Draco had known, when he'd written the article so long ago, that it wouldn't be an easy road. To be here at all was a miracle.
A feeling was squeezing his lungs, making it harder and harder to keep breathing. It was like every part of the pain and grief and rage he'd suppressed over the last year was rising up inside him, bursting out from where he'd forced it and ignored it, just so that he could keep living.
Harry ran a hand through his hair, dislodging flakes of snow. 'We've been trying to figure out how it happened for weeks. Now we know. Malfoy is linked to the weather and he makes it change whenever he wants.'
Harry's eyes dropped to the case as he considered it, intrigued despite himself.
'Fucking,
Then the low buzz came again. He could feel himself getting lost in it - lost in the cycle of pleasure without release. Ladon teased at him, the pleasure building again and again, the sensation never quite enough - never long enough to let it break. He felt as though he were cresting one wave after another, desperate to let it finally break on him, drown him. He could think of nothing but the bliss rushing through his body. Then Ladon moved the vibrator, trailing it up to his balls and letting it sit there, against the ring, the vibrations shuddering through his cock as well. It was a steady speed and Harry cried out again at the intensity of it, his stomach muscles clenching and his hips jerking involuntarily. He wanted - he couldn't -
'I assume the kitchen is through here?' I ask as I make my way towards it. I don't need Potter's confirmation as I enter the room. It's small and pokey, like the rest of the apartment. There's no sign of any care or life in any part of the room. I move to the refrigerator and open it, curling my lip at the sour smell of off-food that floats from it. I pick gingerly through the contents for a moment before pulling a few things out. The ham at least smells fresh.
'Yes.'
Draco raises a hand and runs it down the side of Harry's face, pushing some of his hair back. Harry shudders out a breath and tugs Draco close again. He needs to feel him. Needs the warmth of his body, the beat of his heart.
Potter leaned in. His eyes dropped to Draco's mouth again. Draco knew he should stop him. He couldn't do this. It was madness.
'Yes, sir,' he whispered.
He puts his things on one bed and Malfoy's on another and tries to ignore the memory of waking up with Malfoy wrapped around him.
He opened his eyes and pushed off from the wall, making his way towards Buswells. He slipped in the door behind a couple who looked like they were entering for dinner. A quick trip through the kitchen and he'd filched a meat pie and then a bottle of whiskey from the bar. He made his way upstairs, listening at the doors before casting Alohomora at a vacant room. A few moments later and it was warded and silenced and he felt like he could rest for a minute.
'I did,' Draco confirms and his voice is steady, determined. 'We need to see our shame. We need to name it and face it.'
All of the details were there, laid out before him. It would be so easy to take what he knew to Robards.
Draco is nervous before they leave, fidgeting in his very expensive-looking trousers and light blue shirt, clearly wanting to put a tie and jacket on.
Draco was watching him when Harry turned back to him. His expression had changed again. It was back to that same yearning
, he thought to himself.
Harry leaned against the building, the street dark around him. He slid his hand into his pocket and gripped his wand, casting a disillusionment charm on himself.
Harry considers that, mind working around it.
'Harry,' Hermione cut him off, 'I am almost positive Malfoy is not "up to something". But let's not worry about that,' she continued as Harry looked up to object. 'How's Ginny? We missed you at the game last weekend. The kids were looking forward to seeing you.'
He moved to the edge of the stone balcony and looked down over the softly lit gardens below as he loosened the stiff collar of his formal robes. It didn't matter how often he wore the damned things, they always felt like they were choking him. At least he didn't have to wear full formal dress underneath. He took a deep breath of the cool night air and felt himself relax slightly as he looked at the quiet, still scene beneath him.
Harry nodded, trying to draw his professionalism back around him. He and Malfoy had a shared past, a bad one. Fine. It wasn't pertinent to why the man was here today and making veiled references to it did neither of them any good. 'Like I said, at the moment, there's nothing pointing to a magical connection, but we need to follow every possible lead. Can you get me a list of names of anyone you think might be against the aims of the Society?'
He thought maybe he was a freak after all, like Aunt Petunia had always said.
'There's someone you need to meet,' Luna said at last. 'If you finish your tea quickly, we can Floo there before they close the borders.'
'She's in the fucking hospital because she thinks she's going round the twist and she's finally asking for help, and all you can say is, "oh, the potions I abuse on the regular as well are getting low"?' Ron's eyes narrowed in anger.
Harry looked at him, surprised by the admission. But then he remembered Ladon telling him he wasn't generally attracted to people sexually, and that the feeling could be very overwhelming.
Draco rolled his eyes at her. 'Yes, well, I was a very close second to you in school, remember.'
'Right,' Harry said, taking the list and the summary notes Draco had handed him. 'I need to pass this stuff on. Can we arrange for you to join the morning debrief tomorrow? I want you to update the whole team on what you just told me.'
'I thought the op was supposed to be Sunday?' Harry asked, aware his voice was rising but unable to stop it.
the wolf?—is growling steadily, as though confronting a threat. Harry tenses at the feeling of it. He wants to shove it down again. But he remembers the darkness, remembers losing all sense of who he was and where he was. He remembers the helplessness.
He looked past Malfoy, into the smoke-filled room. 'Has that happened before?' he asked, trying to keep his tone light. 'Have people died, from dreaming?'
Harry shrugs, mind sifting through the techniques he'd learned that allow him to couch his words just so. An Unbreakable was dangerous, the magic had its own way of identifying people's intent, but it could still be worked around with the right wording.
He reached for his wand and sent a cleaning charm over himself and then slid his legs over the edge of the bed, a languid satisfaction to his body. He didn't bother putting his shoes back on, walking back through the door and into the small living room. Malfoy, to his surprise, was sitting on the couch, reading a book. He didn't look up as Harry entered, but there was a stiffness about his body that told Harry that Malfoy knew he was there, knew exactly what had just occurred and was trying to pretend nothing had happened.
'Yes,
He made his way up familiar stairs and through familiar hallways, pausing before the door to his father's study – the room he'd once ruled the house from. Now, from what Draco could ascertain on his mandated monthly visits, his father basically lived in this room. He squared his shoulders again and knocked sharply before opening the door.
'Does the parent let the children rule the house?'
She gazed at him, her face still, her posture unconcerned. 'This is a sacred place. It is a temple dedicated to life.'
'I'm going use this on you, Harry. Is that alright?'
'Corner booth, nearest the door.'
Harry widened his eyes too, putting on his best innocent expression as he looked at Malfoy, 'The best flyer? Really?'
, Pheo hissed in contentment. She slithered so she was stretched out across his shoulders and down his arm. Harry looked at her, nonplussed by her strange reaction, and it was then that he realised the rain had stopped. He looked up at the ceiling to see bright sun rays beaming down at him. In fact, the room was very quickly becoming steamy, as the temperature increased rapidly.
he did this,' Ron said grimly. 'We have his magical signature on file from his trial. It matches every single one of the deaths.'
The camera pulled back to show the group of advisors again as they applauded the words. This was it, Harry knew. The Statute of Secrecy was broken, shattered beyond repair. This was the start of World War Three, and they would all be lucky to survive it. He felt the horror of it rising in him like a wave, ready to pull him down into the depths and drown him.
'We were so happy then,' Potter said as he looked down at his bottle again. His voice was quiet, and much of the defeat he'd worn when he walked in was back.
'I want you to undress, leave your clothes there-' He pointed to where he'd been sitting on the velvet covered couch. 'And go and get the collar from the table.'
Davies smiles and the grin is full of teeth. They stare at each other for a long moment, neither making the first move.
Harry remembered the file he'd read and wondered if Malfoy even had a pet to keep him company.
And then he was at the door to the Auror Wing. He took a breath and straightened his shoulders, pulling on the mantle of confidence he normally wore like a second skin, but which felt contrived these last few weeks. The doors opened before him and a handful of Aurors looked up. Most glanced away, but one or two gazes lingered, eyes narrowing. Draco didn’t let anything show on his face as he strode towards the door marked 'Head Auror.' Nowadays, most of the looks he got when out in public weren't hostile. He'd done a lot of work to make it so that when most people thought Malfoy, they thought parties and donations and reformation. It helped, as well, that his father was confined to the Manor and hadn't been seen publicly in years.
say that.'
But he was alone and he could have whatever fantasies he wanted. He dropped his hands from his chest, scraping his nails down his sides with a hiss at the trails of pain they left. Then he tilted his hips up, slipping his hands underneath himself, cupping his arse cheeks.
Draco cleared his throat, bringing his eyes back up to meet Harry's. 'That's fine. I'll send her an owl. I brought that collar in France, when I realised I wanted to open my own club. They're rare things. Not many wizards need them, once you've taken away their wands.'
Harry snorts softly. 'You would have made a good Auror,' he says as he begins to study the documents in front of him. Three of the photos jump out at him immediately. They're some of the older ones, cases from years ago. He feels a stab of faded guilt as he looks at them.
'The idea of you working that thing into yourself, letting it wrap itself around your cock, suction cups leaving little red circles all over your skin.' Harry released a shuddering breath, scraping his teeth against Draco's neck as he shifted his hips, letting Draco feel that he was hard against his arse.
'I know,' Draco said with another sigh. 'You could add intelligent. He's incredibly good at keeping information about himself hidden.'
Ladon wanted to see him again. Whatever he'd been doing, Ladon had been sorry to have missed him.
He'd been shy. He'd thought it meant something.
Harry debated how much to tell her, then figured the Healers would be passing on their reports anyway.
'Could it be that Harry Potter - big, strong, commanding Head Auror Harry Potter - wants to let go? Is that it, Mr Potter? Have you come to receive, rather than give? Do you want to be tied to these ropes, arms above your head, barely able to touch the ground? At my mercy while I make you count the blows?'
'Get rid of them,' Daniela said, and her voice was furious. Harry wasn't sure whether her anger was over the fact that her own charms had failed or the fact that something had dared to touch her precious bones.
'What about him?' Malfoy asks, tilting his head at the unconscious man.
'It shows remarkably poor judgement, Mr. Potter, to bring in a consultant on a case that directly implicates a close family member and to then give free access to significant evidence.'
Harry turned and hurried after Draco, who was pushing open the door to his father's drawing room and looking around wildly. There was no one inside and the light had disappeared. Harry saw Draco growl in frustration and lift his wand. He realised a moment too late just what Draco was planning as he pointed the tip at his own throat, his voice booming out a moment later.
She bustled off and Harry followed her, sinking into the chair at the kitchen table with a sigh. Molly busied herself for a moment at the kettle and then floated a cup of tea over to him, followed by a slice of what Harry realised must have been the cake from last night. He felt the sting of guilt run through him again - he was a right shit.
'Sometimes,' he said, his voice quiet.
Harry looked down at the small, blond figure clutching Draco's hand, peering out shyly from behind his leg. The boy looked to be about Archie's age and was the spitting image of his dad.
Ron followed him down and then hesitated in the doorway to the kitchen. 'About work. Robards has been looking for you too. I think he'll want to see you.'
She brought her hands up around his neck, scratching lightly through his hair as he thrust into her. The sensation stirred the restlessness higher and he moved his face to her neck, hesitating an agonizing moment before whispering, 'Could you  - could you scratch me? Down my back?'
And Draco has. The article is perfect. There's not a letter of it that's not respectful to the victims—to the dead that each new moon brings. Instead, the article shows again and again the humans behind the wolves, and the things—so many simple, simple things, that could stop the carnage. If only there was a will.
Draco grunted sourly. 'Please don't tell me you're fucking Finch-Fletchley again?' he said. 'The last round got your crup named after him, what this time?'
He put the coffee cup down, hard, on the bench, heedless of the way it splashed over his hand.
Harry considered for a second trying to follow him again, but the whole situation was making a sick sort of sense. He turned back to the door, his heart beating loudly, as he hoped he was wrong.
'Spread him open,' fantasy Draco said. 'Let me see.'
He woke to the Room of Requirement. It had been set up just how Dean had planned it. Harry looked around in excitement. The monthly inter-house parties for the seventh years had been getting more and more interesting. It was one of Dumbledore's more inspired ideas, Harry thought. It made sense that as they came of age and started to prepare to enter the real world, they needed to let those prejudices start to break down - to start to see each other as people first and houses second. Plus, seventh year was bloody stressful with the amount of classes they had piled on top of them. They deserved a chance to unwind every now and again.
'Once or twice a year my son hosts a ball,' Malfoy said in his drawling voice. The contempt he had for the idea was clear.
Malfoy shook his head with a look that made Harry feel like he knew absolutely nothing, then he motioned Harry to his bed. It was empty again. It was always empty. Harry was starting to wonder if Malfoy was keeping it clear for him. There was a bottle of Dreamless sitting on the pillow. Harry picked it up and downed it as he slid onto the bed.
Ladon pulled back and looked at Harry, his other hand tightening momentarily on his hips, fingers digging in.
to be helpless. Imagined the lick of the lash. He shivered and felt his heart beat faster.
Before Harry has really consciously thought about it, his hand is on his cock and he's pulling it, thoughts of Malfoy and all the reasons he's a terrible person and Harry should just stop thinking of him, filling his mind.
Harry took a step back, shaking his head.
He blinked again and the trees were on fire, the flames reaching towards the sky.
'It's nothing,' he muttered. 'Dahlia's a Muggle - she doesn't understand, and she's taking it out of context.'
charms on Muggle shopkeepers after a few flagrant breeches of the Statute of Secrecy - some idiot had started requesting dragon steaks and doxie eggs. But apart from regular misunderstandings over the money, the group had settled in well to the outing.
'Will you let me do that, Harry?'
Harry makes an impatient move forward. He wonders if he can
Harry makes his way to the Land Rover and behind him he hears Malfoy cast the Cleaning Charm he'd used in the apartment, removing all traces of Harry's blood from the Jeep. He's a quick study, Harry thinks, unable to help the admiration that comes with that thought.
He pushes himself to his hind legs as he steps into the cavern, lit up by the light of a stick. The one he hunts stands in the middle, stick by his side. He doesn't smell of rank fear the way he should. His gaze is steady, silver eyes shining in the darkness. He is wary, ready to fight, but he holds still. He watches.
'I - ah - no. I can't make it,' he said, rubbing a hand through his hair, still damp from the shower, before twisting it up into a messy bun.
'One of your horde of screaming witches finally proved too tempting?' I'm making it up, I'm so out of touch with the Wizarding World. Potter is the first non-Muggle I've talked to in at least two years. But it's Potter, I highly doubt the hype of "Our Saviour" has died an inch.
Malfoy nodded, watching the path of his fingers.
'Hi mum,' he murmured. 'Hi dad.'
He knew he was pushing his luck. He'd been surprised when Malfoy had answered his first question. But they'd had such a great time together. They'd been
Harry grimaced, remembering his earlier conversation with Robert Javier, Head of the DMLE and technically his superior, though he dodged the man as often as he could.
He muttered something under his breath, which Harry couldn't catch, but which sounded like '
'Gods, you look amazing,' he said, tangling his fingers in Harry's hair and feeling the way he was working back and forth.
'Trousers too, please, sir,' Jonathan says. 'Mr Markwell was quite insistent that I take correct measurements and that's far too difficult while one is wearing jeans.' Harry can almost hear the curl of Jonathan's lip as he says the last word, though not a hint of it shows on his face. He sighs, figuring the sooner he gets the measurement over with, the sooner he can get dressed again.
James hadn't been taken in his place.
Malfoy quirked an eyebrow and Harry realised, suddenly, how his words had sounded, and what they could infer. He flushed but refused to take them back. He
It wasn't until they stopped for lunch that things changed.
Draco mumbled something and Harry stepped closer.
for the violence fills him with a sick fury. He won't have it.
Harry screamed, trying to gather them all, trying to bring them to safety, to the surface, already knowing he would fail, knowing he would watch them die again.
Harry put his hands on her to try to give her what shelter he could. He cast a warming charm over himself and wasn't surprised when it barely took the chill off the air. Whatever magic Malfoy had managed to harness and twist to his will, it was powerful.
Draco snapped back to full wakefulness, tension flooding his body. 'You're about as subtle as a
'Technically I didn't kidnap him at all,' Lucius continued. 'Avery did that all by himself. I can see the merit, I suppose, force the Aurors to come inside and to drop the wards, so I can leave at last, but the methods,' Lucius clucked his tongue in disapproval.
Markwell likes what he sees. It's incredibly subtle—if Harry's senses weren't so razor sharp, he would have completely missed it—but the way he's wired now, Markwell may as well have asked him for a fuck. Harry wants to curl his lip at the man, deride him for being into the help.
'Thank you, Mrs. Norris,' Harry said, eyeing the woman a moment longer and knowing he was going to pay for being so flippant.
Draco sniggered and then looked contrite, as though he shouldn't be laughing at Harry's friend in front of him. Harry laughed too. It
Malfoy steps up beside him on the sidewalk and touches his arm lightly to allow him to pass through the wards. Once they're through he strides to the door as fast as Walter's body will let him, unlocking it and walking inside. Harry follows him, looking around, breathing in deeply as he tries to catch a hint of anything out of the ordinary.
'No, Dray, you're not,' Pansy said, looking up at him as he stood leaning against the counter-top, teacup clutched in front of him. 'You - you're not made to be alone. I know you -'
Malfoy's eyes widened in shock. Harry gritted his teeth. He wasn't going to take it back. It was true, he realised. It was the way he'd felt for a long time.
'What is this place?' he asked, looking up at the stone roof above him, almost lost in the gloom.
Harry opens the file. It's the fifth he's received since he started at PROtego a few months ago. This one is like all the others. A headshot, the particulars of the person he's assigned to, and a description of what they've come to PROtego looking for. Harry scans it quickly.
Malfoy sits, watching quietly, the darkness between them shining with the light from his wand.
As long as he kept his head down, that shouldn't be a problem. In and out. Find the people he needed, get the information he needed and move on. That was how he'd been operating for the last ten months and it hadn't failed him yet.
Harry watched the proceedings with a razor eye, glancing at Draco occasionally to see how he was holding up. Draco's eyes were fixed on the back of his father's head, and Harry had to look away.
'Do you remember that trip to Italy?' Potter asked, as he looked down at the beer in his hands. Draco was lost for a second, until he realised Potter and Charlie must have heard the saying while in Italy. He made an encouraging hum, but stayed quiet. Potter hadn't provided him with any memories related to that trip, and Draco didn't want to shatter the illusion by getting a detail wrong.
Harry let out a bitter laugh. 'Ron does.'
, a voice whispered in his mind.
Ron stepped forward with a frown, reaching out for him and Harry moved faster. 'Not until you tell me why you're here,' he said. 'This is serious Harry. I've never seen anything this bad. Have you been talking to Malfoy? Do you know where he went?'
'Of course the
'I'll light the place in a second. I just need to tell you what this is.' Harry bit his lip, that same nervous look crossing his face.
Harry's thoughts were broken by Malfoy's voice.
'Hey, petal,' he said softly, kissing her bushy curls.
'Normally,' Ladon continued, 'we have all new members complete an assessment so we can understand what it is they want from the Club and can match them to the appropriate partner, or experience. That is what we will begin with today.'
having to petition the courts for warrants. He should have just kept his damned temper. He tried not to think about just why he was finding that so bloody hard.
That was how the next few days went. Draco worked with him in his office, the list of papers he kept aside growing steadily higher as he scribbled down notes and thoughts, muttering to himself occasionally, in French and English. He started bringing in books - classics, histories, musicals, and leaving them in haphazard piles on the desk, flicking them open to check something before snorting and muttering to himself again.
,' Malfoy snarled, hand dropping to his wand. 'This is
Jeffries glared at him for a moment, just long enough to assure Harry, if he didn't already know it, that the grudge hadn’t been forgotten.
'Be safe,' she said, seeming to accept those words. Harry realised she'd heard them from him often enough. They'd been in and out of each other's lives for years. The last eighteen months had been the most time in a row they'd ever spent together.
'That's not relevant to the things we need to ask you, Mr. Malfoy,' Murphy said, leaning forward.
Draco had to close his eyes. He couldn't deal with the intensity of Harry's gaze - with the words that wanted to spring to his lips - the words it was far too early to say. He leaned his head back, groaning as Harry's strong hands dug into his arse, pulling him forward as that wet, perfect heat licked up and down his shaft.
Harry watched as its mouth curved into a cruel smile, its teeth filed into points and stained with blood.
'Come on,' Malfoy says, gripping his arm in turn. 'You need to help me here.'
Harry's trousers are still half-way down his legs and Draco's shed his jacket and waistcoat at some point and is clad only in his shirt, ripped down the front. Harry pulls back from the bruises he's sucking for just a moment to look at him. Draco's mouth is red and his cheeks are flushed, his pulse throbs in his neck and everything about him screams that he wants this, that he wants every part of Harry.
He reached out to clap Harry on the shoulder, but Harry flinched away.
Harry scowls. 'Have you done anything illegal since you broke parole?'
Harry shook his head impatiently. '
. The lash took his breath away.
'Touch him,' Draco said. 'Slowly. I want to hear him beg.'
'Bread?' Scorpius asked, leaning in to take a look in the bag Harry held open.
Harry just hears "bed." He picks Draco up and turns them, ignoring his laugh at the manhandling as he walks the few steps to his bed and lays Draco out on it. He takes just a moment to appreciate the sight of Draco's long, lean, muscled form stretched out on his bed before he covers him, rolling his hips again as their mouths meet.
Molly smiled, cheeks reddening slightly. 'It's nothing,' she said. 'No more than I'd do for any of my other boys.'
'I've messed up,' he mumbled. 'I've done something stupid.' He glanced sideways again to see Hermione looking at his borrowed shirt, then back at his face, a question in her eyes. He nodded slightly and her face fell, as though he'd just confirmed her fears.
Harry's attention was caught as the older man stood, waving at the bathrooms up the back of the pub. His companion made a derisive comment about whether he needed his hand held and was given a rude sign in response.
Harry Apparated to the alley beside Malfoy's bar. The landing made him stagger and he held out a hand, leaning against the brick wall and hanging his head as he focussed on breathing deeply - waiting for everything to stop spinning. He felt nausea rising in him, but he swallowed it down, gritting his teeth. He would get through this. He was stronger than anything Malfoy could throw at him.
Ginny had bought the outfit for him. Hers matched. She was the Muggle Queen, Elizabeth - the original one, not the current one - and she looked amazing. He'd caught a glimpse of her as she'd gone into the bathroom to finish getting ready. She'd told him he looked dashing, but he was pretty sure he looked like a right prat. He was supposed to be some Muggle called Sir Robert Raleigh … Walter Raleigh? He couldn't remember. Some Muggle anyway. Harry took a gulp of his drink and rolled his eyes.
Harry could tell it wasn't a question. 'Ah, that depends what you mean by first rising?' he said, having a sinking, uncomfortable feeling he knew exactly what she meant.
He wondered what Ginny would say if he asked her to tie his wrists to the bed. He felt renewed heat run through him at the idea, but then reality of making that request - of asking for more than that - doused the stir of interest. How could he - and what if she laughed at him … or thought there was something wrong with him?
'Goodnight, Scorp,' he said, smiling at the boy as he pushed to his feet. 'Goodnight 'Braxus,' he said to the dragon with a wink at Scorpius. The boy giggled and lay back in his bed.
Malfoy didn't fight back. Didn't dispute it. He just stood there, shoulders slumped, looking at Harry with an expression of helpless pain.
'You don't want that sort of fun, Potter?' Malfoy asked, his voice a whisper in Harry's ear. Harry spun around again, but there was no one there, only the darkness.
Javier nodded, watching Harry, as though he was a strange puzzle he couldn't quite figure out.
was missing. There were no childhood St Mungos visits, no awards or punishments at Hogwarts, no travel details, no bonding record. He didn't even own a house. The persona was enough to pass a casual inspection if someone were, say, establishing a business, but it wasn't enough to pass an Auror investigation.
Harry feels his jealousy swirling in his chest, rising in his throat until he almost chokes on it. The only thing that allows him to stay silent in his fury is the fact that he now realises the Loyalty Bond is pushing these emotions on him. It's not real. None of it is real. He doesn't care who Malfoy does and doesn't want to fuck. He especially doesn't care if Malfoy wants to fuck an animal.
'When I saw him the other day,' Granger frowned, her eyes speaking plainly of her concern, 'it was like all of that had disappeared. He was back to how he was in the first year or two after the war. Like he was still in the battle. Like he didn’t know how to get out and if he didn't save everyone, no one would.' She shivered slightly, looking into the distance as though remembering. Draco was struck, watching her, by the reminder that she had stood alongside Harry, all those years. She, too, had come up against the Dark Lord again and again.
Harry ignored the teasing and eyed Draco, gauging his certainty and the reasons behind offering the invitation. He was sure there was more to the request than wanting Scorpius to meet new people, but the idea of watching Ron and Draco circle each other like wary cats all day was too good to pass up. Plus, he would get to spend the day with Draco, without the pressures of work around them.
Scorpius climbed into his bed and waved Harry over, handing him the book. Harry looked down at the familiar title,
Malfoy's frown deepened. 'Tomorrow? You almost
He shifted off Draco suddenly and stood, his balance unsteady as he swayed in place.
Harry moved over to the bench, focusing his attention on the thick leather collar he'd worn the last time. He ran his fingers gently over it before picking it up and turning back to Ladon.
Harry looks down at his wrist and runs a finger lightly over the chain. Then he looks back up at Malfoy, a question clear on his face. Malfoy doesn't hesitate. He nods.
'We have a system of colours. It's based on the Muggle traffic lights. Green for go. Yellow for slow down and red for stop. If you need to stop - ever - for any reason - you say red, and I will stop. Okay?'
He'd had another three by the time she came downstairs, and the sight of her almost took his breath away, stirring feelings he'd thought long-forgotten. She wore a full-length gown, gold in colour and decorated all over with intricate beading and embroidery. A white lace ruff framed her shoulders and ran up behind her neck, drawing attention to her hair, which was twisted into delicate spirals of vibrant red. Her mask was simple; delicate gold wiring framing her eyes and sweeping up into her hair.
Malfoy makes a choking sound and Harry feels a stab of satisfaction. Just the thought of what those children must be going through; Harry remembers raised voices, small spaces, sharp blows; he remembers fear and pain and helplessness. Blood. So much blood. No child should
that?' he says, pushing Harry, hard.
He jumped down, moving across the bodies, trying to keep his footing so he didn't have to touch them with his hands.
'Since when has he been out of Azkaban, anyway?' Harry asked, torn between wanting Ron to take up on their argument from the night before and wanting to fill in some gaps. He thought of hard grey eyes and Malfoy's lips twisted into a sneer that extended up his face in a scar now.
From the Atrium, Ron let them into a side corridor Harry had never noticed. There were several numbered doors coming off it.
name instead of Charlie's.
So! We finally get Harry and Draco face to face. We finally get into the world of BDSM ... though Harry hasn't participated yet ...
Mrs. Norris' calm façade didn't change. She held out her hand and a piece of parchment flew into it. 'Their letter of request states clearly that they wish to develop a stronger relationship with Magical Law Enforcement to ensure transparency and positive encounters which will advance cooperation between traditional families and the Ministry as a whole.'
Harry nodded, knowing he wouldn't.
'Teddy is the reason you hate them, isn't he?'
He thought about the things he knew.
He wrote until his hand cramped, then he pushed his half-eaten meal away and downed the rest of his whisky before he reached for the pouch at his side. He pulled the neck of it open and searched for the bundle of papers he kept in there. It was all of his notes and research to date. His fingers nudged against the two newest vials of memory and he pulled those out as well.
Harry barely listened as she spoke. Why had he said that? The only people he'd ever told that were Ron and Hermione. He'd been all over the place all week but to say
Draco knew he should do the right thing. He should let Harry have a life that was free of him. Draco tried to steel himself to that thought, but then a fragment of a memory floated into his mind: Harry sitting in front of him - in front of Ladon - voice a whisper, full of pain, as he said,
Harry felt his fury grow at the idea that all of his friends were spying on him, reporting back. He was suddenly glad that he'd made contact with no one but Ron while he'd been gone. And he'd been able to tell Ron only the things he wanted him to know.
Harry steps up to Ron and lets himself be engulfed in a hug. It's far briefer than the contact he gets at the Burrow, where everyone leans against him, rests their hands on him and makes sure he leaves covered in the mingled scents of his pack.
'It's too much like shitting in your own bed,' Malfoy says, and Harry has to agree. Agreeing with Malfoy doesn't feel as painful as it once would have. It feels right.
Harry felt his anger rise. Why did Malfoy have to be such a fucking shit in real life? In the dreams he was so different. Harry felt his thoughts leap.
'I've come to put the final arrangements in place for the Ball Saturday next,' he said. 'I've spoken to the Ministry and your confinement wards will change on the Friday evening, as usual. You'll need to be in the East wIng before that happens.'
'When they are newly manifested,' Conor said, 'they're easier to defeat. The Muggles have part of it right, those that follow the Christian religion. It's in their Book of Revelation. They place a scroll in God's right hand, sealed with seven seals. Their Jesus, the Lamb of God, opens the first four seals which summons four beings that ride out on horses. They go a bit off track after that. The Christian apocalyptic vision is that the Four Horsemen are to set a divine apocalypse upon the world as harbingers of the Last Judgment from their God. Their role is to give the people of the world a chance to repent before they die. It's quite macabre stuff. But the heart of it is right. There are seals, for each of the forces. The force that responds to the name of Conquest can be sealed back away using the Seal of Triumph.'
'This,' she said, patting the case, 'he tells me is a selection of his memories throughout his life. To even the playing field, whatever that means.'
'You'd just have to trust,' Malfoy continued in that same deep, mesmerising tone. He sounded like he was standing right behind Harry and Harry fought the urge to turn. 'Just shut your eyes, and trust.'
'You're spying on me now?' Harry asked, incredulous. He took a step forward, moving into Ron's space. 'You're coming into my fucking house and poking around without me here?'
Harry latched onto it. Malfoy was wavering, he could feel it. He just had to push it a tiny bit further.
Malfoy thought he would hurt Scorpius? The idea of that was enough - just enough - to take the edge off Harry's anger. It was enough to allow him to rein the power in.
'Never,' Draco says, and his voice has a thousand emotions running through it. 'Never. You're mine now.'
It seems Draco feels the same way. 'The bed, this time,' he says, 'not that I object in the slightest to being fucked against a wall.'
'Hello, Harry,' Luna said, blinking slowly at him. 'How nice to see you. Are you in some sort of trouble?'
'Have you been there before, then?' Harry asked, not reaching for her yet.
'It's not John O'Neill,' Harry said, nodding his head at the swarthy man with a scar across his cheek, listed along the bottom of the board. He made no mention of Malfoy. Malfoy wasn't on Harry's list, after all. Besides, Harry felt no closer to understanding just how he was involved than he had before he came face to face with him.
He pulls his mouth away from Draco's and nudges his head out of the way so he can get to the tender skin of his neck. He sucks at it, hard, before biting down. Draco lets out a cry of pure want and arches against Harry, fingers tightening in his hair and pulling him closer.
'Potter,' Malfoy says, and now there's concern in his voice. 'Stop.'
Now Malfoy raises an eyebrow at him, and it's mocking. 'I'm not sure why you think that's any of your business, Potter,' he says archly, 'but it's not.' With that he returns to his paperwork, leaving Harry very clearly dismissed.
Draco was still huffing occasionally, a smile across his face he couldn't seem to get rid of, when they sat on the grass a few metres back from the edge, watching as Scorpius chatted away to the ducks as he fed them one corn kernel at a time.
'That's the idea Draco had,' Hermione said. 'Quite a good one actually.'
Harry felt his anger spark again in response to Malfoy's dismissive tone and he shook himself mentally. He had a job to do. He was here to find out what the hell Malfoy was up to. Here, if he was honest with himself, to prove he could do this work. And he didn't need a whole team breathing down his neck to prove that to. He could do this by himself. He'd always worked best alone.
He was still pondering the best way to do so without blowing himself up when he heard a sound at the door. He looked up to see Ginny standing there. She was wearing jeans and the yellow cashmere jumper he'd gotten her years ago for her birthday. She seemed tired, and he wondered if she wasn't sleeping well either. She met his eyes hesitantly, as though she was unsure whether he was about to yell again.
Malfoy waved him into a chair at the table, pouring him a glass of white before putting the bottle back in the fridge. Harry resolutely did not watch.
He'd forgotten how much of a rabbit warren the Ministry was, and it was becoming an increasingly windy one. The wind had gone from occasional gusts to a strong, steady blow. Every room Harry entered, it came at him from a different direction. He looked around at the people at their desks and saw increasing looks of frustration, annoyance and outright anger. The baking heat had cooled right off but the wind was unrelenting. Sticking charms didn't seem to be making much difference and the more the day wore on, the more the Ministry was starting to look like the site of a disaster. Paperwork, plants and even furniture in some instances were blown across rooms and into corridors.
Harry looked around, wondering at the strangeness of the weather changing again. He wondered what was setting each of the changes in motion. He couldn't see any link between the fronts that had passed through - rain, followed by heatwave and now growing wind. They'd all been equally disruptive to Ministry business, but that was the only connection he could see.
Harry paused again, thinking back to the times he'd seen Ladon. He remembered tight bonds, sharp pain, being driven right to the edge. And then nothing. Floating numbness and peace. He pushed away the thought of what had come after, lying in Ladon's arms as the man had whispered to him how good he'd been, how perfect, how strong.
Harry cast his again, frowning as the magic flickered, seemingly reluctant to take. He felt the lack of raindrops, but the barrier was nowhere near as strong as he was used to.
'I'll tell him. He -' Draco paused, imagining the moment. 'Maybe if he hears it from me, it will be okay.' He didn't know if he was trying to convince Pansy or himself. He didn't think either of them had bought it.
Malfoy steps up beside him a moment later, directing his attention down to Jonathan, still kneeling on the floor in front of Harry.
The next to be called to the stand was Draco. He didn't look at Harry as he walked past, but he did glance at Lucius as he climbed the step to the stand. Harry could see Lucius' face as he turned to watch Draco. The smile on his face was knowing, and Harry couldn't help the feeling of disquiet it stirred.
'Oh, dear boy. You don't have to replace her, but it's been three years since Astoria passed. At some stage you do need to move on.'
His mind kept returning to the way it had felt to be empty, and free and to not have to think. It was like an itch he couldn't scratch … a desire that he hadn't even realised had wormed its way under his skin until it was something he'd had to do without.
'Oh,' she said, a little too loudly. 'Hello, Conor. Have I forgotten to eat again? It can't be that time already. I feel like I just had breakfast a moment ago, but there's so much happening right now. Perhaps I could just have another coffee and get back into it, what do you think? Only I don't want to miss a moment of it. The change is happening too fast and I think we're on the precipice of the second rising, only I can't quite figure out where it's going to be yet, but if you could just give me a moment more to keep looking.'
means 'That's enough, my darling.'
'It's real?' he said, his voice almost a whisper as he thought back to the spectral demon that had burst from the body of the woman on the spire. It wasn't until he said it out loud that he realised how much he had been worried that he was going insane, was creating some reality inside his own mind to try and explain what was going on around him. To prove to himself that his son's death—all the death that was now occurring—was not his fault.
'Isn't the explosion inside my chapel the more pressing question?' she asked, concern on her face.
'I need to see Ron,' he said instead, hoping like hell Ron was actually rostered on tonight. It seemed he was because Jeffries hesitated.
Harry felt that same flush of heated pleasure at the words.
He sat awake through the night, holding vigil for James, for his memory if not his body, in a way that he had failed to do when he was alive. Harry sat alone on the top of a mountain, thousands of miles from anyone who knew him, and grieved his son anew.
and he shuddered away from the thought. No matter what was between them—what Malfoy had done to him in the past—there was no way Harry could let him die.
Then it hits him and Harry feels his anger slip slightly; his furious certainty falters. He loosens his grip completely and backs up, taking a few steps away from Malfoy.
The tunnel diverges after about thirty paces and Harry follows the scents to the left. He considers telling Malfoy to leave some sort of magical trace on the walls, so that he can find his way back out if something happens to Harry, but he discards the thought immediately. Surprise is their only weapon here. They can't risk leaving something that could so obviously lead someone to them. He tries not to think about what Malfoy will do if something happens to him.
But something in him - his Auror training … his sense of self preservation … urged him to slow down. To stop and think. He tried to remember if he'd heard the term BDSM before. There'd been a case, years ago, involving a Muggle and a wizard who'd had an explosion of involuntary magic in a place like this. He hadn’t been the Auror assigned to the case, but he remembered some of the stories he'd heard back in the office, about the sorts of things that went on inside establishments like this. He couldn't just walk into some place and hand himself over to them. He smiled, apologetically and turned for the door.
'Adrian Hallbrook?' Malfoy says.
Instead he takes a seat beside Malfoy in the small room while Ron sits opposite them.
Draco frowned at that. 'I hadn't noticed it being that bad. When I visit it's … not as nice as it used to be, but it's nowhere near as bad as that. I think the house makes an effort for me, but to think things have gotten that bad …' he trailed off, looking lost in thought.
He stepped outside and turned left, beginning to walk. After a minute, Felix whispered to him again.
There was a
'Potter, what are you—' he pauses and Markwell's dark eyes drop to Harry's chest. 'Are you wearing my shirt?' For a second his glamour shifts and Harry sees Draco's face, heat rising in his eyes as he bites his lip. Then Markwell's image snaps into place again.
'You knew?' he said, his voice a low rasp. He was talking to Malfoy now, not the thing inside him, but it was War who answered again.
They were going to send a mole in. They were going to send a fucking mole, just like Harry had, and think their mole could have a better chance than him.
Harry smiled at him and Draco seemed to shake himself slightly, before making a deliberate effort to change the subject.
'No,' Harry said. 'I want to talk about this.'
Harry opened his mouth to say he wouldn't. He knew what he wanted, but something about the tense hunch to Draco's shoulders made him reconsider. Was Draco talking about himself? Did
Harry's face was red now, but he answered, his voice quiet. He was so good, it made Draco ache. The way he took off his protection, piece by piece, took away the power and the Auror and the Chosen One, and put himself in Draco's hands. No
Fucking Potter. Yes, Draco had been quite drunk, and yes, he had been screaming at Potter about how everything that had gone wrong since the war could be laid at Potter's feet. But he couldn't really be blamed for that. The anniversary of his mother's murder always sent Draco a bit off the rails.
Harry shook himself, focusing back on what he was doing. The moment he was far enough away from the
