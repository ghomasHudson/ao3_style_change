Draco doesn’t return to prior position; he just shuffles his half-lie down to the top of Harry’s legs. His back is stretched out, head pillowed on Harry’s thigh. “That’s why we had the quiet one last year, Potter.” Draco pats at Harry’s calf and Luna’s calf one after the other in an indulgently bad rhythm. “You won the bore of a birthday with the knock to the nose, and now we’re back to everyone getting a chance for a tried-and-true bollocking.”
As no one has bothered to serve themselves, Rolf stands and hand delivers a cup and saucer to everyone else, then pours a clear golden tea into ceramic. Harry is slightly concerned at the small red dots floating in it, but picks up the cup and drinks a sip anyway. His eyes bulge a little when he realises that the small dots are a type of chilli, but it’s honestly quite soothing, so he keeps at it with little aerating sips. Draco looks over at Harry when his sips are getting a little too loud, but Harry just smirks back. Draco kicks out his foot and lightly knocks it against Harry’s in retribution, but turns back around to talk with Luna and Rolf further.
Harry’s wand is pulled for the final pile up, cast iron pans spelled to just a low warmth and then sent flying off to the centre table, already throwing the spatula into the sink, filled with hot water and ready to scrub. He’s turning around without a care to pull out the empty seat next to Draco, when a light voice asks “am I still drunk?”
“Figure out what’s happening here? You-” but Harry’s stopped in the middle of his words, that were pretty much forced out of him without his control, by Draco’s wordless
“Oh,” Neville says, and sounds a little flustered. Harry turns to see the man, imposing shoulders hunched over the wooden tabletop, red in the face. “Hermione’s friend. From Uni.”
"Oh god stop!" And Draco flicks his wrist with a quick scourgify of his own to get at- "Don't mess with me like that, Harry."
“No…” Hermione trails off, and then turns away from Niamh’s hand to look at Draco, who is recovering from his coughing fit. The others are looking confused at the ring: Pansy is paused in her conversation with Neville, Neville is paused in his effort to pay attention to Pansy’s talk about her cursebreaking apprenticeship, Blaise and Ginny have stopped poking at each other in their weird way of flirting, Ron is looking – not at Niamh. Not at the ring. Not at Draco, but at Harry, who is remembering Draco’s manic
The days continue onwards. They work their crap shifts at their crap jobs, buy groceries every other couple of days because they don’t plan far enough in advance. They go out drinking every couple of nights with different combinations of their friends; friends who
"Harry, honestly, you're an idiot if you think people are wandering all the way down here to buy dirty old antiques at lunch time on a Monday. We are well and truly alone."
Draco laughs - Harry frowns, jostling him in admonishment. Draco bumps him back, and then pulls out of his grip. Rounds the kitchen table littered with empty cups and flutes, and then taps a few bricks with Harry’s wand – how does he still have that – and out pops a cabinet. Another dozen unopened bottles of the wine, Bulgarian vodka, and a jug of prune-juice, dressed up in a few cobwebs.
There’s no other word for it, and Harry also expects that in the future when he recounts this tale to others that Draco will get quite angry with this description. But there’s really no other word. The sound trills out unbidden from between Draco’s lips, and he tucks his head under Harry’s jaw, the sounds tickling at the sensitive skin.
Draco doesn’t look away, so Harry has to, turning to face Luna, who’s now standing in the doorway to the hall. He finally notices the significant number of boxes that are splayed across the room, and wonders hoe Draco and he even managed to make their way through unscathed from hitting any.
Harry groans and Draco groans and Luna hops right up without a care to brave the crowded hallway. A sharp call for them to follow leaves her mouth as she exits.
Draco leans in closer, his hot, quick, exhalations cresting over Harry’s face, and his glasses fog up a little. “I’m not scared of marrying you.” Draco says.
A wincing beep screams out from the speaker, and then a thud as the locking mechanism on the door gives way. He pushes it open and is greeted by the rundown entry way, walking through to the stairs, giving the elevator a sceptical pass.
Just in time too, because the next second an owl is tapping at the high window – Ginny is quickest with her wand and sends the window open quickly, to which the owl does a pretty little circle and drops the letter right onto the table.
Harry pulls down the sweatshirt over his head with a flurry of hair, and stares at Draco. “He gave it to you?”
They float back to their bedroom at around 4am, silence in their path. And the conversation is put on hold.
Harry thinks that maybe if he weren’t recovering from pretty severe emotional turmoil, he might not understand what Blaise is talking about here. Fortunately for himself and for Blaise, Harry’s still a little raw, so the meaning flows like salve against a burn.
Another display cabinet of small velvet pedestals holding up slightly large, much more boring, rings. Some have jewels in them, others have small patterns. He frowns.
Harry laughs. Draco has always found immense pleasure in testing Harry’s limits when he’s pulled the other straw. Harry is historically too stubborn to fall for the man’s charms. Most of the time.
Harry smiles, as one is wont to do in situations where they’d rather curl up and not answer. “No promises.”
that Harry has been collecting for years will be shuddering at the force of the howlers that'll just force their way through the wards Draco could put up, so he doesnt bother with them. Will let them come. His feet are resting in Harry's lap, and Harry has a firm grip around an ankle. Teddy is looking back at them from the till in confusion and boredom, annoyed that his sly questioning glances haven't brought forth any answers.
But Harry does. He’s sure he does. It’s why he loves Draco, completely. Why he was ready, Paris willing, to do just what Ron had done.
The ring is very, very bright. Harry sits down hard on the end of the mattress so he doesn’t have to see it turn and glimmer in Draco’s hand.
“Well,” Draco deposits the cups on the kitchen table and takes Harry’s wand out of his hands, quickly vanishing the lot. He seems to have sobered up quite completely, regardless of the amount of Elven wine he’d had – back when there was an engagement and Harry was in good cheer. “I said that the auror’s would show up around 1am. Seeing as it was 12, I lose.”
The house groans again when Draco and Harry get to the bottom of the stairs, before suddenly ceasing, sighing out and settling down. Harry gives the wall nearest him a pat, and Draco immediately leans all of his weight on his own.
Draco’s not even looking at Harry when he starts speaking. “I need you to be sober for this conversation.” His eyes are on the fridge. With the magnets that hang up pictures of their friends. There’s a condom wrapper under a magnet for the greater lakes district; their first-time condom, that they’d kept and displayed. Like 19-year-olds did, and 23-year-olds don’t see a problem with.
“Why,” and she pauses. Thinks for a second, and then leans on the glass, too. “Why are you proposing?”
It’s a similar story here. The bands are simpler, thankfully, but nothing is especially significant.
“Yes. Yes, you need to be sober. So, I’m putting hangover cure in your cup of tea. Then we’re going to sit on the back porch and not stop talking until we figure out what’s happening here.”
Draco stutters. “Ah. Yes. It’s fine, don’t worry about it. It has a tendency to go. To go wandering.”
Luna sits at the head of the table, right underneath a large plaster bust of a boar with huge overflowing antlers. From the mouth of the boar hangs a large forked tongue, that hangs so low that it brushes the back of Luna’s chair, and just slightly above her head. The thick band that rests across the top of her head has small felt figures of people moving across the top – they reach out to smack the lolling tongue away. It swings contentedly, and Luna seems unperturbed.
Maybe… maybe Draco’s telling Luna that he’ll need a place to stay when he inevitably dumps Harry later this evening when they get home. Luna’s probably giving him free reign of her and Rolf’s apartment that they spend absolutely no time in.
Harry’s lips twitch. He leans back against the kitchen table, exhausted, drops his head back between his shoulder blades. Draco hops up and sits on the table next to him, softly presses his lips to Harry’s shoulder.
“I’ll do you one better,” Draco gives, and then releases his hand to reach into Harry’s sleeve. Gripping the Holly wand, Draco seamlessly performs five different freshening charms until Ron looks clean and ready.
birthday really is for other people more than it is for you.” Luna is slowly walking Draco through steps, getting the two of them up to round 6 with more gentle slaps of their hands and Draco’s mumbled counting under his breath. “Take true advantage of it, I would say.”
A levitation charm, and Dracos bag settles back on his shoulder. Teddy mumbles something about getting back to the till, and goes rushing back through the door his godfather is still kind of blocking. Harry has to walk forward - towards Draco - to let the kid around him, and then they're only 2 and a half meters away from each other.
“Sorry.” Harry forces the ring back into her hand, takes a physically step of distance away from the brushed silver ring.
. Because Draco is blanching, eyes wide on the ring, and his haw is clenched. Harry can hear tapping coming from Draco, like he can't control his foot.
Luna’s gaze had wandered out the far window, but meanders back with Draco’s question. “Hmm? Oh, yes, no. Daddy’s fine.”
Draco has his forehead pressed to Luna’s shoulder from behind. Luna is patting his head and murmuring nonsensical words into his ear.
Harry opens his mouth once, looks sideways at Draco, who has his eyes closed and his forehead wrinkled. Concentrating on something, or in pain, Harry’s not sure, but his bravery passes.
“So much. I love you and your shoes all over the entry way, and I love that you make the same meal at least once a week, and I love our routine. I love you.”
“I bought this,” he flashes the box, which is suddenly in his hands, “about two years ago on a whim. Just got my first real paycheck, and should have put it straight into my vault and not looked back, but then you’d just shown up at the door in the middle of a rant because some… professor or something had been rude enough to make you storm out of class.” One of Hermione’s course mates cackles here, probably at the memory.
Blaise nods. Pulls himself taller, towering over Harry. “I’m not… sure.” He seems to be judging his words carefully. “What one is supposed to do.”
But right now Harry has got his lips moulded to Draco’s, who has a hand clenching tightly around his bare hip, and eggs which are definitely cooking too long on the temperamental hob.
Draco deflates. He has a moment to think about whether this is going to help matters or make them worse. But he does know that it'll make Harry laugh.
Draco presses his fingers into his eyes, and Harry looks away because Draco always presses too deep and it looks like it hurts. Harry replies, instead. “It’s tricky, Hermione. It’s the house. It gets grumpy.”
“Yes,” Della agrees, wiping her own hands off. “I have a shift, too. We will be seeing you later this evening, good drinking to come!” And then Della places a big hand on Ron’s head to ruffle, whilst Pansy smacks a posh kiss at Hermione’s cheek, and then they’re off. Harry’s certain he can hear the floo blaze, but no one reacts when Niamh’s head shoots towards the stairs.
Blaise’s chair squeals against the floor as he pushes it back and legs it up the stairs, presumably to force the couple from their acquired bed. The homely smell of frying bacon must have invigorated him, Harry supposes.
Since Draco’s distracted, Harry doesn’t bother to bring up whatever was bothering him earlier. Whatever he’d lost. Instead, Harry walks over and chucks Hermione out of the way of the hob, flicking his own wand instead. The hob gives an uproarious lurch and flames burst from the front two burners.
“D-D-Draco?”  Harry quite literally closed his eyes and shook his head.  He must be going mental, he thought.  But when he opened his eyes again, Draco was still standing there, looking very amused.  Battered and bruised, but amused.
“I’ll not apologize for him, though,” said Draco, catching the look. “I didn’t marry him to hurt you.  I love him.”  He paused. “I will admit to taking some joy in your disgust, however.”
Harry nodded.  “It’s a possibility.  I suggested there may be a connection to your father’s note.”  He didn’t say anything more, as he promised Ron.  But he felt a little dishonest not mentioning the rest of the conversation.  Then he thought of the other news.
Ginny tried to keep herself composed.  “Hermione, he’s free to see anyone he wishes.  Although I’m more than a bit surprised, he hasn’t done anything wrong.  Not to me anyway.”
Shocked at first by Draco’s reprimand, Harry smiled. It was probably the kick in the arse he needed after feeling sorry for himself for so long.
“Yeah, it feels a bit tender still, but my insides feel fine. I need to continue exercises for my right ankle,” Draco told him. “Some of the tendons were damaged along with the break. But I don’t need the cane anymore. Did you notice?”
Draco determined that hate was not a strong enough word. And upon releasing Simon’s hand, he grasped Harry’s in a way that Simon would not miss. It may have been petty, but it was effective as Draco noticed Simon’s gaze drop and the slightest bit of a frown crossed his face.
“Where have you been?  The library closed two hours ago.” Hermione, as usual, was waiting up for her friend.  Ron was in the common room as well, but he was busy reading Dragon Magazine. He really wasn’t concerned about Harry at all.
“If you two are finished, can Harry borrow your houndstooth jacket?” Draco interrupted.  He was glad that Harry and Blaise got on all right, but sometimes their banter made him a tad jealous.
Draco tried to remember who had gotten together as a result of the game.  The game certainly seemed to want him and Harry together.  He recalled the time he and Harry heard Luna and Longbottom in one of the alcoves.  He’d seen the two of them walking about the castle hand in hand since.
“I said similar, not the same,” she clarified. “I had to come out, for lack of a better term, as a witch to my family.”
Ron and Hermione stepped forward.  Pansy smirked as each of them deposited their wands.  She gestured for them to select a slip of parchment from the other pot.  Hermione reached in first and glanced at her number.  Ron followed suit. Twenty-six in all, ended up dropping their wands into the cauldron, and choosing a slip of parchment with a number on it.
“Let’s worry about that later,” Harry suggested.  “Our energy would be better spent doing other things,” he grinned.
Complying, Draco removed his fingers and guided his cock in their place.  Both men grunted and moaned as Draco buried himself to the hilt.  Slowly sliding back out, then in again, the Potions professor leaned forward to kiss his lover.
“Incendio.”  The candle came to life, illuminating the scene and Draco’s face.  Softly revealed by candlelight, Draco was a vision.  Part angel, part libertine.
“Clara,” Draco called.  The house elf popped in front of him. “Do you know where Mr. and Mrs. Weasley’s room is?”
Slowly, Draco tugged Harry on top of him and spread his legs, cradling Harry’s body between them. He ground his hips forward.
Draco’s hand trembled as Harry slid the ring on his finger.  It was a bit too loose, so Harry took out his wand to shrink it to size.
“I wasn’t holding my wand when I made my request.  I wonder if Pansy knew that you have to be holding your wand for it to be binding?”
Momentarily disengaging his mouth, Harry replied. “Then why would I stop?” He continued, without heeding Draco’s warning. On the contrary, he sucked harder.
Draco quickly spoke up, realizing, though he really was angry with Blaise, this was the perfect set up.
The girls left Harry and Draco for the other end of the common room.  The boys didn’t have the privacy Harry wished they did, but no one appeared to be paying too much attention to them.  Draco sat down in Pansy’s previous spot.
Ron himself, couldn’t help but smile.  He enjoyed seeing Harry having fun, even if it was at his expense.
“Most of what you’re talking about happened because of the war.  He was merely trying to survive.  Even McGonagall believes he is remorseful.  That’s why she hired him.”
A moment later, a throat clearing itself urged Harry to open his eyes.  Draco stood before him, freshly showered and impeccably dressed, as usual.
“But . . . “ Harry said, stopping Knox in his tracks.  “I love Draco.  I intend to be with him for a very long time.  I like you, as a friend.  But I can’t be your friend if you persist with your flirting.  And more importantly, you need to stop undermining Draco.  Don’t you dare ever tell him again that he’s not good enough for me.”
Looking down at his deflating penis, Harry shook his head.  “I’m not that flexible.  Besides, that’s what you’re for.”
“Bill is the oldest.  I haven’t seen him since before Victoire was born. Maybe five years ago,” Harry explained. “I think Dominique is about two.”
The anticipation was almost palpable.  Harry leaned in again, this time pushing Draco onto his back.  He kissed the pale, lean neck, and down to the collar bone.  Lingering for a moment or two, Harry sucked until he left a small mark.
It only lasted a few seconds, and Draco had barely parted his lips, but it was one of the sweetest kisses Harry tasted.  They parted and leaned back slightly to assess the other’s reaction.
“I know I will.  No one else has ever loved you the way I do,”  Draco mumbled and moved in for a kiss, but was stopped by Harry’s hand on his chest.
“It’s not that I don’t want to be partners with you so much as I want to be partners with someone else.” Draco bit his lip.
“Ah, Harry,” a voice called from down the hallway. “You’re not beginning your apprenticeship already, are you?” Healer Cummins held out his hand to shake.
“Took you long enough, Potter,” Draco breathed. His hands immediately found the button on Harry’s trousers and undid it, sliding the zipper down at the same time.  Harry groaned when those hands wrapped around his cock inside his pants.
They sat on a bench near the shop and decided where to go next.  Ron wanted to add a charm or two to the bracelet before he gave to Hermione.  To personalize it a bit.  Harry was getting hungry and in need of something to perk him up a bit.  He was still exhausted from lack of sleep the night before.
Draco leaned up a bit and smiled.  “We don’t have to decide anything right now.  We still have several months to figure it out.”
“He isn’t failing, Professor McGonagall,” Harry clarified.  “He never was.  Draco was tutoring him privately, but I think he’s back on track now.”
“Ron,” Harry sat up.  “I haven’t told him and Hermione about us yet.  We should give them a floo call.” He began to get up.
“It is good to see the two of you content,” Minerva explained.  “There were times my heart went out to each of you for the harsh turns life brought you.  I feared neither one of you would find the peace you deserved.”
“Let me see if I can do anything to help you until we get you to a proper Healer.”  Harry looked around for his wand, then remembered that it had fallen into the cellar.  “Shit.  I’m going to need your wand.”
“If you’re not careful, you’ll drive Potter right into that other bloke’s arms.  Sort of like a self-fulfilling prophecy.”
“Look, Weasley.  Can I call you Weasley?” Draco appeared to have a bit more to drink than Ron thought.  “Right, I think if I’m going to be shagging your best friend, maybe we ought to get to know each other better.”
“You looked like you were having plenty of fun without me,” Harry remarked, unable to keep the pettiness out of his voice.
“I’m not,” Harry said.  “We should slow down and really get to know each other better.  See what we have here.  See if it’s something that will last.”
Hermione happily drifted into Gryffindor as Ron was leaving the girls dormitory with Lavender firmly gripping his hand.
Blaise stared at Draco a moment.  “I don’t know how.   Not without hurting him anyway.  This way, he can be brassed for a while, then get over it.”
“Take care Bill.  Lovely to see you Fleur,” Harry called to her as she ushered Victoire out the door.
As Harry walked away, he thought about how frustrating it was to try and keep their relationship a secret.  He longed to be free to show his feelings whenever he wanted.  He decided then and there to contact Ron and Hermione to have them come visit.  Harry had already spent too much time hiding.
As they went through Snape’s personal items, one of them usually had some insight about it.  Mostly Draco, but occasionally Harry had something to add.
“I don’t know.  I’m just trying to figure out why you’ve been drinking alone in ---”  Harry glanced down.  “Are those my papers?  Is that my story all over the floor?  Draco, what the Hell is going on?”
He led Harry to the cushions, then undressed himself while Harry removed the rest of his own clothing.  Harry lay down and waited for Draco to finish.  This moment was almost all Harry could think about through dinner.  As amusing as the evening was, Draco kept him distracted with a subtle hand on his thigh throughout the meal.  Harry wondered how he got to the point of wanting to fuck Draco to the exclusion of all else.  He was completely under Draco’s spell.
Nodding, Draco answered, “My legs are a bit shaky, though.  Maybe we could switch?”  He lifted off completely and lay back on the pillow.  He spread his legs and waited for Harry to dive in.
“I guess it wasn’t quite as newsworthy, seeing as nobody else had to fight you know who.”  They stopped in front of the door to the Great Hall.  “It’s amazing that you did that when you were so young.  You’re a real hero.  I’m sure you’ve heard that a million times.”
“She still gets occasional headaches, but that’s to be expected.  She’ll go back to St. Mungo’s in another week to have herself checked out.  Should be good as new,” Draco said cheerfully.
Standing statue-like, mouth open, Narcissa stared at her son.  She couldn’t possibly have heard correctly.  In her lifetime, she’d never heard of such a thing happening.
It was Hermione’s turn to choose.  She got Daphne Greengrass’ wand.  Most of the remaining boys grumbled.  Many of them were hoping for a chance at who they thought was the prettiest girl in school.  Hermione shrugged.  Unlike Ron, she was certain she would be able to stay faithful.
“I truly never thought I would get married,” Harry said.  “So, I haven’t thought about it much.  But I suppose we ought to do something to celebrate.”
When he arrived back at their quarters, Draco was already busy packing away his teaching materials for the summer. He had set aside a couple of books that he placed on the coffee table.
He smirked to himself as she threw her head back.  He wasn’t sure if she was really that moved or it was simply theatrics, but he didn’t care.  His ego needed the boost.
“Plus, it’ll be fun to have our own secret again for a while,” Harry said.  “Remember how exciting it was before everyone found out about us?”
He must have stood in front of Draco’s door for a full five minutes before gathering up the nerve to knock.  When he did, the sight that greeted him was not at all what he was expecting.
Harry could barely hold back his grin as his foot found the hem of Draco’s trousers and began to slide upward.  He kept his eye on the blond, studying his face for any sign that Harry was breaking his concentration.
The students found two large tables next to one another and sat down, Gryffs at one, Slytherins at the other.  Harry shrugged.  At least they were making somewhat of an effort.
Nudging Draco back to the bedroom, Harry said, “You can help by getting some sleep.  I’m going to put up a silencing charm so you can’t hear them.”
“I thought, at first, to have you try another Hawthorn. But this one has a dragon heart string core.” Ollivander pushed the box toward Draco.
“Oops, I left it on the sideboard,” Harry said, getting back up.  He spotted his own manuscript sitting open.  “Have you been reading this?”
He licked his dry lips. “I asked if you did.  If you had a good time, until you found out it was me.”
Lily gasped.  “She’s even smaller than some of my dolls.  She’s beautiful, Daddy.  Can I play with her?”
“I don’t want to be the hero of the wizarding world, famous for one thing I’ve done.  I want to help people in a real and personal way.  And possibly to heal the Death Eaters the way I did with Draco.  The only way to figure out how, is to work with the Healers.”
Ron glared at Draco, who considered echoing Harry’s sentiments, but thought it best to keep quiet.  Instead, he looked away.
“So, Ron, I was thinking,” Harry began as he dug into scrambled eggs.  “You and Draco should get to know each other a little better.”
“Yeah.  I think I’m getting my appetite back,” Ron replied.  “Mione and I didn’t get a chance to eat.  But I didn’t feel like it before.”
As they hesitated, Ron whispered, “Those feet, wrapped around Harry’s waist . . . they’re awfully big, aren’t they?”
Harry swallowed and blinked away any potential tears.  He smiled.  “It would only be because I’m happy,” he fibbed.
“I don’t want to.  But she’ll really disown me if I don’t.  Believe me, my two older brothers didn’t want to either.  Mum threatened them with cutting off support. And . . . it didn’t turn out so bad for them.  I’ve got a niece or nephew on the way.”
“So, I was wondering,” Harry began a new line of thought.  “Were you planning to go to the Masquerade party tomorrow night?”
“Now I’m really starving,” Harry laughed.  “Let’s go down to the kitchens and get something to eat.”
“It’s not that noticeable on you,” Draco said, then realized how it sounded.  “Um, I mean, on that sort of shirt.”
Pansy, a late arrival, along with her new husband, not Theo, brought with her a gift of an eight-week-old kneazle.  Lily had requested the animal a year prior, but she had very specific ideas about the coloring and it took Pansy several litters to get it just right.  Lily ran to Pansy’s side as soon as she saw her new pet.
Both Harry and Draco appeared slightly uncomfortable at the mention of female matters, though it was all part of the process.
Draco returned from his parents’ home on Saturday afternoon.  He knew Harry would be monitoring detention for another hour or so before supper began, so he took out the latest novel he had been reading and settled on the sofa.
“Better than immediate release?  Better than being home to protect Mother from the danger you’ve put her in?”
“Are you sure you’ll be okay here by yourself?” 	“I’ve been living on my own for three years now,” Draco smirked.
“You can’t really think I would rather have been hanging out with a bunch of young girls.  You have nothing to be insecure about.  I told you, I’m in love with you.  Only you.”
Montague shrugged.  “I don’t know.”  He didn’t want to tell anyone he’d been getting private tutoring.
Harry tentatively lifted a trouser leg.  The Slytherin’s left leg was swollen and bruised.  The other leg was worse.  The ankle had ballooned up beneath his sock.
“It was a little more uncomfortable than I expected,” he finally answered. He winced a bit as he turned his body toward Harry.
Harry opened up the door to let her in.  As she walked in, she glimpsed into Harry’s open bedroom door to see Draco lying in his bed, half covered by the sheet.
“No, I was planning to go back to St. Mungo’s tonight.  Really.  I want to get this foot taken care of as soon as possible.”
“I think we should go to Venice first,” Draco said excitedly. “There are so many lovely places to go along the canals. And gondola rides are very romantic.”
Knox frowned.  “I thought maybe you were feeling some of what I was feeling.  And that you just didn’t want to hurt him.”
“The following Monday, you may begin practicing your potions, if you are ready, or you may continue in the library to finish up.  Please start your potions no later than Wednesday, the ninth of December.  Although, I suggest you begin by Tuesday, the eighth. By December eleventh, all papers will be handed in and there will be a potions challenge.  I won’t reveal the potion in question until class that day.  And it won’t be a potion any of you have researched.  Any questions?”
Thursday following his night out with Ron and Hermione, Harry was beginning to regret his decision to let Hermione set him up on a date.  It had been a long week and the students, particularly the higher years, were getting distracted by a Halloween dance planned at the end of the month.  Halloween had always been one of Harry’s favorite holidays at Hogwarts, so he understood.  But it didn’t make his job any easier.  Worse, the faculty had to chaperone the dance.  Harry always felt awkward at dances, the worst having been the Yule Ball Fourth Year.  He supposed it must have had something to do with being uncomfortable around girls.  And dancing with them was somewhat objectionable.
Sitting up, Harry said, “I was thinking . . . maybe I could give Ron a call.  He doesn’t have to make it an official case.  At least, not until he finds something.”
Leaning slowly to his left, Draco peeked around Harry and locked eyes with Ron.  The redhead’s eyes were as large as saucers.  His mouth hung open, as did Hermione’s.  Draco gave the slightest of waves and leaned back to face Harry.
Ron snickered.  “I bet the next girl you shag is gonna be glad Pansy was your first, then.”  He nudged Neville’s shoulder.
“My son, of course.”  She took another sip.  “Despite his appearance, he is really a very sensitive soul.  He’s not as tough as the image he projects.”
“We don’t have to stay in here.  There are many other bedrooms.  Though, I think this one has the best view.”
Trying to reassure him, she said, “I’ve noticed the way Harry looks at you, and the way he speaks about you.  He’s happy, truly happy.  I believe it’s because of you.”
He lead them to a reception area, with another man sitting behind a desk.  There was a wall of compartments to the rear of the room.
“Yeah, I just wanted her to try one piece. That was all.  And she kept putting me off.  She wanted to shag right there in the Tower.” Ron said it as if it was a ridiculous notion.
Another blast, from behind Harry, sailed over his head.  He looked for the source and saw the overly hairy form of Fenrir Greyback turning a corner.
“No, because they’re having more fun than us,” Ron grinned and drew Hermione closer.  “And I didn’t think of it first.” He tilted his chin and smoothly glided his lips over Hermione’s.  She responded by parting her mouth and allowing him to take whatever liberties he pleased.
“Well, I still had one, you simply couldn’t detect it.”  Draco awkwardly wet his lips. “Forgive me Harry, but I’m having a hard time figuring out if my resurrection is a good thing or not.”
“Oh, there you are,” Molly squealed as she came into the sitting room.  “The birthday boy is finally here.  We can eat.  Everyone else is already in the kitchen.”
“Wait, Mr. Malfoy.” Ms. Singleton glanced at Harry.  “I mean, Mr. Potter-Malfoy. I didn’t say we wouldn’t help you. I only wanted to give you a realistic idea of what you’ll be up against.”
“You’re going to wake her,” Draco said, annoyed.  They’d all been around enough babies to know not to be so loud.  “Lily, dear, give us some room,” he said gently.
“Uh, yeah.  Excuse me.”  Harry nodded to McGonagall and took his usual seat.  He spooned out some oatmeal for himself and began to eat when he saw Draco get up and leave the Great Hall.  For the remainder of breakfast, he wondered why Draco left early.  Harry wanted to follow him, but figured it would look suspicious if he left before he finished eating.  Shoveling the oatmeal in as quickly as possible, Harry finished and left after a couple of other professors had gone.
Harry couldn’t help notice the way Draco’s eyes reflected the color of the shirt.  They appeared brighter and more lively than usual.  As Harry approached, those eyes flashed his way.  Almost quicker than Harry could see, Draco’s right eye winked at him.  He could feel himself blush, wondering if anyone else saw.
The butterflies were churning in Harry’s stomach as he waited by the gate for Malfoy to arrive.  He was scheduled to reach the castle in only a few minutes. Half an hour later, Harry could see him as he approached the gate.
“Harry,” Draco opened his eyes. “I know you well enough to know that you wouldn’t have suggested that.”
“Sorry Dra,” Pansy said.  “He’s right.  If he put the wand in, it’s his.  And he’s your partner for the night.”  She was unable to stifle a giggle.
“Ron’s correct,” Hermione said.  “Besides, I’ve sort of already mentioned to Althea that the pair of you have a lot in common.”
Quietly enjoying his food Harry noticed that Hermione looked like she wanted to make a comment or ask a question.  She kept pausing as she brought her spoon to her mouth, as if to speak, but then continued to eat.
Laughing, Ron replied. “No.  I definitely don’t have anything against them.  Not my hands, not my legs, and especially not my arse.”  He shivered dramatically.  “Why on earth would a bloke want another bloke when he could have a soft, curvy beauty like Hermione.”
“I could get used this,” Harry sighed.  “Waking up with you.  How do you look so damned good first thing in the morning?”
Narcissa laughed. “They’re a matched set,” she observed.  The three boys stood across the yard, each with auburn hair and blue eyes.  Though Teddy’s attributes were more a reflection of his mates than his own.
Harry knew that wasn’t quite what Draco had in mind, but he seemed to understand that Harry needed to take things at his own pace.
“Not too short.  I’ve always had long hair,” she warned him as he began to comb her lengthy black tresses.
“Ron, I’m not telling you anything.”  Harry continued to straighten up their workstation while Ron persisted his search.
“Yes.  And no,” the Healer frowned, wondering why Harry would ask such a question out of the blue.  “We can narrow it down, rule out certain men based on magical signature. But, if it came down to, brothers, say, it wouldn’t be possible to determine absolutely until birth.  I would ask why you want to know, but I suppose it’s none of my business.”
Panting softly, Draco asked him, “Aren’t you tired of wanking alone in the bathroom after our little meetings?  I am.”
“But that’s not the end of the story,” the clerk insisted.  “It turns out, that unlike Romeo and Juliet, they didn’t actually go through with it.  They ran away together and lived out the rest of their lives in a small cottage in the countryside. The rumor is that they’re still alive out there somewhere.  And still together,” she sighed.
Looking down at his parchment, Harry figured it would take him another fifteen minutes or so to copy the rest of the potion procedure.  He heard papers shuffling and watched Draco as he began to pack up.
“This is the happiest I’ve been in a very long time,” he finally said.  “I think, if I let myself, I could fall in love with him.”
“It shouldn’t take too long.  Why don’t I go to Ron and Hermione’s flat afterwards.  I can bring supper.”
“I mean, no, I’m not sorry.  Things just weren’t working.  What’s the point if it’s not fun, right?”
Rolling off to the side, Draco reached across the bed for his wand.  He gave it a flourish and cleaned up the bed, and the two of them, then removed the silver ring that had been restricting his bollocks.  Afterward, they lay tangled up in each other and silky sheets.
Ron shrugged.  “It’s hard to tell.  She’s speaking to me.  Sometimes.  Lavender keeps pestering me, though.  It’s like sixth year all over again. Lavender is there, ready and more than willing.  But all I can think about is Hermione.”
“I wonder what Mione and Mal-- I guess I’d better get used to calling him Draco-- have been doing all this time,” Ron said.  “She’s probably going to have my head.  Merlin!  I hope they haven’t started hexing each other or anything.”
Her eyebrows rose sharply. “Nikki?  On Draco’s lap?  She’ll hardly sit with Ron.  Although, I suppose Ron is so uneasy around children that she senses the fear,” Hermione laughed.
A small, shy smile appeared on Draco’s bedraggled face. “I’m injured, un-showered, helpless in a hospital bed, at the lowest point physically and emotionally I have been in a long time. And you choose now to tell me how much I mean to you?”
“Now don’t be hasty, Harry,” Ron frowned.  “Maybe they have a policy here, a celebrity discount or something.”
During dinner, Draco and Harry told them all of their honeymoon visits.  Arthur was especially fascinated by the amusement park.  He had all sorts of questions about how the rides worked. But everyone else was more interested in the city on the water or the private villa.
“It wasn’t bad. The wandless magic training was probably the most difficult. For me anyway. I think Harry had the hardest time with potions,” Ron stifled a giggle. “Did he tell you about the one that exploded in Shacklebolt’s face?”
“Look, can we just drop it for now?” Harry pleaded.  “I promise Ron, I’ll tell you all about it after I sort it out for myself.”
Harry grinned and kissed Draco.  He grabbed his husband’s hand and pulled him out of the loo, toward the lab.  They submitted their sample and apparated back to Hogwarts, missing the sorting of only two students.
“Besides, Draco and I just got settled into our new place at Hogwarts not long ago. I’m very happy there.”
Hermione and Ron enveloped Harry in a familiar three-way hug.  Sitting in his place on the floor, Draco began to feel more and more awkward, so he stood.  When the trio broke apart, Draco offered his own congratulations.
The first thing Harry heard was the sound of giggling girls.  The second thing was Draco’s voice resonating in his ear. He was yelling something at Harry.  It was an odd sound, until Harry realized why.
“Nonsense,” Draco smiled. “We haven’t ordered yet. Sit with us,” he insisted. “I haven’t properly thanked you for the rescue.”
Draco leaned forward to make eye contact with Knox. Though the man was no longer any sort of threat to him, and perhaps never was, Draco still didn’t like him.  But he appeared to be a shell of a man these days, and Draco wasn’t without sympathy.
“That was a hell of a way to ask him.”  Harry was still upset by Ron’s use of Auror tactics.  Harry was very familiar with Ron’s methods.  Somehow the man could get a confession with a simple look or gesture, or a seemingly benign question.  Harry had always suspected Ron of using wandless magic to make himself more intimidating.
“Druella,” she replied.  “It was my mother’s name. And I liked the idea of all our children’s names beginning with the same letter.”
“No.  I’m sorry.  I could only see your connection to the boy and girl, no other’s.  I don’t know who the mother would be.”
“You’re talking to the man who out poker-faced Voldemort, Ron.  What do you expect?” Hermione chuckled.
“So you’ve said.  And yet, I find you in the arms of my best friend mere hours later.”  Blaise turned on his heel and walked out before either Harper or Draco could respond.  Harper threw himself back onto the bed dramatically.
“You missed a spot,” Draco told him and licked a bit of cum off the corner of Harry’s mouth. “But what about you?”
Anthony approached a girl in a tight spotted outfit with a tail and ears.  She wore a mask that only covered her eyes.
“Thank you.  I swear, it’s only for a little while.”  Harry kissed Draco.  “Salty.  But not unpleasant.”
“I think I will. I need to get away from my family.  Someday, I will be able to forgive them, perhaps.  But not right now.”
As wonderful as snogging was, Harry still wanted a verbal answer.  He pushed Draco’s shoulders back slightly, and the Slytherin took the hint.  Breaking the kiss, he gazed at Harry, breath panting lightly.
“Oh. Yes, I do.” Ginny bit her lip.  As the Chooser, everything was her call.  “Okay, we could go there.”
Not that Knox had really done anything wrong.  He was personable.  Most of the students liked him.  With the exception of Montague, Harry supposed.  And he’d never truly made any overtures toward Harry.  Harry couldn’t point to a specific reason the man shouldn’t take over the Charms classes.
Daphne’s sister, another coveted female, was spoken for when a known homosexual boy, Harper, pulled her wand.  More grumbles from the boys.
“Ron Weasley?” Knox looked him up and down.  “Wow, it’s a pleasure to meet you.”  He held out his hand to shake.  “Harry has told me some amazing stories about you.  About all of you.”
Harry leaned close.  “Thanks for getting me away from Glenda Chittock.  She was going on and on about Ministry politics.”  He rolled his eyes.  “This is supposed to be a party.”
“The game made me say it.  I had to answer his question,” he defended himself.  “Plus, I was completely pissed, which was stupid in and of itself.”
“No sir.  I swear.”  Casper swallowed.  “The first one wasn’t.  But I just . . . well, every time I went to the library before . . . well, I was distracted.”
After gathering what he needed and writing a list for Pince, he wandered into the Restricted Section to find some recreational reading for himself.  He paused when he heard Harry’s voice quietly speaking to someone else.  Turning toward it, he peeked through the shelves to see Harry sitting with Knox.
Draco pointed up.  “The glass keeps it warm in here all year round.  Mother has Clara tend to the plants meticulously.  Perhaps there is some artificial sunlight, but basically, these are muggle flowers.”
“Exactly,” the blonde smiled.  “I’ve never met real celebrities before.”  She continued to stare at Ron, who became increasingly uncomfortable.
Christmas supper was an amazing feast, as it always was in the Weasley household.  Draco had forgotten to give Arthur the wine and excused himself for a moment to retrieve it.  As soon as he was out of earshot, Harry was bombarded with comments and questions.
A few minutes before midnight, Blaise called for everyone’s attention.  As they did previously, guests began retrieving wands in order by lottery.  This time around, it went much quicker.
Hearing those words from Draco at that moment quelled any doubts Harry had.  He was happy.  Happier than he had ever thought possible.
“Well, Harry doesn’t have a partner yet,” Hermione offered. She felt Ron gently kick her under the table, which earned him a glare.
After a long look and a sigh, Draco agreed.  Though sex was forefront on Harry’s mind, he didn’t bring it up again.  The way Draco had glossed over his hints earlier and his melancholy mood made it clear that the pair would not be consummating their relationship that night.  Much to Harry’s disappointment.
“You’re joking, right?  Draco has certainly done plenty in his life to feel guilty about.  Not the least of which his inappropriate behavior with that boy, Montague.”
“Thanks.  I’d like to repay you for all your help.  Perhaps I could treat for supper some time.  Although, it hardly seems a fair trade.”
“I can try,” Ron laughed.  “Just kidding, Mione.  As much as I hate to admit it, Draco, you’re the best thing to happen to Harry in a long time.  He’d be a complete wanker to give that up for someone like Knox.”  He narrowed his eyes at both Hermione and Draco. “Don’t ever tell Harry I said that.”
Lifting his head up, Harry captured Draco’s lips as the pair rubbed against one another until Draco was as hard as Harry. Draco wrapped his legs around Harry’s waist, pulling him even harder against him. They snogged and ground in a frenzy, oblivious to a peculiar soft clicking sound and muffled voices.
Ginny leaned forward.  “What the fuck is your problem, you moron?  She wasn’t seriously asking.  She was making a point.  I’m rethinking trying to talk her into forgiving you.”
“This is a volunteer operation, Harry. I have my doubts about finding one willing to carry a Death Eater’s baby.”
Harry laughed as the two friends made their way down to Harry’s quarters to get the wine Harry had gotten to celebrate.
“Quite funny, Draco,” Horace commented.  “You are rather different from your father.  I don’t recall him having much of a sense of humor.”
Draco leaned closer to the mortified Fourth Year. “It’s all right.  I couldn’t help looking either. It was rather on display, wasn’t it?”
“I’ll manage.  I mainly came by to thank you.  You saved my life.  Again,” Draco chuckled.  “It’s becoming a habit.”
Daphne gently removed the books from Harry’s hand and bent down to put them on the floor.  When she rose back up, her body lightly rubbed against his, her face, only inches from his.
Ten o’clock.  Slytherin House.  Pansy and Theo stood in front of the wand cauldron looking at one another.
“Um, I’m sorry about the way I talked to you last night.  I was tired.  I know you were only trying to help.”
“So much for our idea to get everyone together, Mione.  I’m not going to be able to get all the way up to the Astronomy Tower,” Harry said.
They waited another ten minutes before deciding they were what remained of the Slytherin House wand parties.
While she gently stroked it with the back of her hand, Harry’s cock grew to its full extension, pointing straight out at her and hard.  He pushed her back a few steps and lifted her up slightly to sit on Trelawney’s desk, bringing her snatch to just the right level for him.
“Oh,” Draco said quietly.  They walked the rest of the way up the stairs in silence.  Now that he had calmed down a bit, he was able to fully appreciate the state Harry was in.
He met her gaze. It was clear to her that he had things he needed to get off his chest.  She waited to see if he would.
Expertly sucking and rolling his tongue, Draco delivered on his earlier promise to make Harry feel good.  Though Harry had received oral sex before, Ginny hadn’t known so precisely what would bring him the most pleasure.  He supposed it was knowing first-hand what felt good that made Draco so good at it.
“With those eyebrows?  Definitely not,” Draco said as he waved his wand at his own hair, returning it to its platinum glory.  He removed his mask and was all set to transfigure his clothing back, when Harry stopped him.
Narcissa accepted the cup and cocked her head. “I must say, though you look more and more like your father with every passing year, you are far different.”
A high pitched squeak escaped Harry’s throat.  His fantasy scenario had never gotten past that first kiss, and the thought of moving further, perhaps even all the way, caused an obvious physical reaction.
Draco crossed his arms over his chest and waited for Harry to beg forgiveness so they could make up.  He’d be happy to forgive Harry, if he promised to stay away from Knox for good.  Though he put up a good front, Draco was terrified that Harry was going to tell him that he was leaving him for Knox.  They stared at one another so long, Draco nearly gave in and apologized to Harry for being petty and jealous over such a small incident, when Harry sighed heavily and shook his head.
“You’re not losing your Gryffindor courage now, are you?” Draco said, his face very close to Harry’s.  “It’s not like the Halloween dance.  Every knows now.”
After the meal, Harry congratulated Knox on his appointment.  Rather than continue on to his own second floor temporary quarters, Knox paused at Harry’s door with him.
Still confused, Draco questioned Harry, “Why would she do this for me?  Surely they must all hate me.”  He took off the scarf and set it, with the gloves, aside.
The pair shook hands, and Harry went off to find Draco.  They’d been separated far too long. On his way, he ran into Narcissa.
“Good morning Mr. Potter,” Minerva smiled when he walked past.  “Mr. Malfoy and I were having an interesting conversation about some rather unorthodox practices going on.”
, Malfoy?” Seamus sniggered as he walked through the common room, gesturing air quotes as he said the word chess, bringing the mood right back down.
Chuckling lightly at the events, now that they were past, Harry told him, “Well, everyone expected me to punch you or curse you, or something.  When I didn’t, the gossip started.  I was able to ignore most of it at first.  Ron and Hermione cleaned up for me so I could look for you.”
All at once, Draco’s fingers were out and his cock was in.  His hips thrust forward and backward while Harry countered his movements.  The sound of wet skin slapping skin echoed throughout the room, drowned out occasionally by Harry’s calling out of profanities.
Harry cut him off.  “I know you and Draco don’t like each other.  And as much as I’ve tried not to notice your infatuation, it has still caused problems between me and him.”
Draco laughed out loud. “Ha!  Since when have you ever cared about fair?  I know what you’re thinking.  You’re thinking that Harry only loves me because of the game.  You’re wrong!” He was shouting as if the louder he said it, the truer it would be.  “And I don’t love him because of the game.”
“Because I love you.  I think it’s the Manor in my dreams. And the birds, they’re white peacocks. We’re meant to live in the Manor, I just know it.”
“No one is going to come all the way up here,” she replied, leaning forward to kiss him again. “Let’s live dangerously.”
Harry made a move that wasn’t as bad as his previous one, but Draco easily won the game in the next several moves.  Draco poured another shot for each of them.
Draco nodded, glad to be off the hook, and left the staircase at the sixth floor.  Harry continued up to McGonagall’s office.
Draco left the Manor with a spring in his step.  He hadn’t realized just how much his mother’s approval would matter to him. Ironic, he thought, that he had spent his whole life trying to win his father’s favor, when his mother had been willing to give it freely.  He vowed never to take her for granted again. And he would do whatever necessary to secure her happiness.
Putting his hands up to quiet them, Harry simply said, “Anything you want to say or ask me, you can do in front of Draco.  I’ll not have you talking behind his back.  I do realize that this is an odd situation, but please, it’s bad enough to be the subject of gossip in the papers.”
“Oh, I love Paris,” Horace squealed.  He went on and on about his many trips to Paris.  He and Draco talked about their favorite places in France and even spoke a bit in French.
“Um, he’s really quite open about his experiences with the Dark Lord,” he replied.  “I had him come to a couple of classes to speak about it with the older students.”
“We’re a rather small group this afternoon, Harry.  Why don’t you sit next to Draco so we can all chat together?”
“It’s either that or let you die,” Harry smirked. “Now what kind of hero would I be if I were willing to let you die for fear of getting cooties.”
“Blaise is pretty smart.  He’s good with potions,” Harry told her.  “I wouldn’t have agreed to switch if I thought Ginny couldn’t win with him.  Honestly.  Draco wouldn’t have been his partner if he was no good.”
Feeling a strange twinge at the thought of both their mouths on the bottle of firewhiskey, Harry reached out for it.  And he also didn’t want to appear to be a wuss.  As Draco passed it, their fingers touched briefly.  Harry looked away and quickly took a swig.  He passed the bottle back to Draco, who also took a drink.
“What? Oh, yes.  Um . . .” she looked to Ron. He leaned and whispered in her ear. Hermione simply nodded.
They lay in silence for a while, each thinking about what the other said.  Finally, Harry broke the silence.
“A dream confirmed by Olivia Tifft,” Draco chimed in.  “He’s going to have two children, a boy and a girl. The boy is a ginger.”
“It’s after eight, Lav.  I’m not yours anymore.”  He wrestled his hand away and took a step toward Hermione.  “You look beautiful.”
“You’re talking about Harry, too, aren’t you?  So many people were against him, or doubted him.  But it didn’t stop him from doing what he thought was right.”
“And she jacked you off right there next to the library?  Blimey Harry.  It must be good to be the Chosen One.”
“No.  However, I do get aroused by the sight of you. In fact, I think it’s about to happen right now.”
“I have had prophetic dreams before.  But not since the war.  Once I got rid of the horcrux in me, I lost the skills I got from Voldemort.  I figured prophecy was one of those things.”
The men looked at each other.  Harry felt as though his attraction to Draco was written across his face.
Harry sighed. Draco was right, of course. But Harry was anxious, nervous and excited all at the same time about taking his relationship with Draco further. And the waiting was nearly killing him.
Nodding his head, Draco said, “Of course.”  He got up and hobbled to the door.  Before stepping through, he turned back to Harry.  “Thank you again.  For . . . everything.”
Draco opened the box. It was a dark, chocolate brown, smooth, tapered wand that was intricately carved at the wide end. “It’s beautiful,” Draco commented. He immediately felt a rush as he picked it up.
Harry smiled at his adopted family. He felt as much a Weasley as any of them, even without the ginger hair. Taking a step toward Draco with his plate, he stopped for a moment. Draco hadn’t noticed him, and was tenderly smoothing the hair away from Dominique’s face.  Their positions had changed slightly from when Harry left the room, and the toddler was now siting fully on Draco’s lap with her head cradled in the crook of his arm.
The expression on Harry’s face became more serious.  “You’re right.  I only like you.  And you only like me, right?”
“Draco.”  Harry grabbed his hand and held it up to kiss.  “He loves you. In his own way.  He simply doesn’t know how to react to . . . us.  You, with men.  He doesn’t understand.”
“She didn’t mind at all that we are two men, for one.  And she was sympathetic to Draco. I don’t think she had a problem at all having a child for him.  I don’t know that I could say the same of all the others.”
“No, I was at Alse Young.  We may not have been fighting the Dark Lord personally, the way you did here.  But we had Death Eaters of our own to fight.  There was a coordinated effort in several countries. I lost two friends when the entire facade of the building came down.”
“Hm, that explains why nothing happened to Looney Lovegood.  MacMillan complained to me that she wouldn’t wank him, but she didn’t receive any punishment.  Thanks, luv.  It should get more interesting now.”  She winked and walked out.
They drink. Harry’s nausea passes with gritted teeth. They watch the night around them, hear the swaying in the backyard. At one point Harry summons Hermione’s specialty contained blue flames and has them floating periodically through the backyard, and it makes the shapes in the garden look unearthly.
“Not sure.” Replies a faint voice – Harry’s a bit concerned when he can hear an airy slur accompanying the reply. “Is it fancy dress at the bobbies tonight?”
Saturday ends with dinner made out of their market supplies. Beautiful red tomatoes and fresh basil, stewed to perfection, with pasta.
Draco freezes so fast he almost falls right into Harry, but wrenches himself away to stare wide-eyed and blinking, mouth gaping like a fish. He’s breathing deep, and Harry – completely sober, incredibly turned on, so sad he’s about to break down – waits for something. Draco’s face crumples, and he goes to say something.
mutters Harry under his breath, but they hasten down the hall and out to the foyer. Right there, two red robed aurors stand framed by the front door. The younger looking one is staring in contemplation at the troll foot umbrella stand that’s holding the door open, and the older one has her arms crossed over her chest and is looking laughingly down at a half-dressed muggle who’s swaying on his feet, and is trying to argue for his friends’ release from prison. He’s completely fucked.
Blaise, who is now very sedated, puts down his coffee from where it had taken up permanent residence at his lips. “I feel as though I’ve celebrated enough for you two to get engaged four times.”
Now that Draco’s lips are free he’s placing smackingly hot open mouth kisses to Harry’s jaw, and then behind his ear, and then down his neck, and then Draco is pressing his hips hot and hard right to Harry’s and Harry stops laughing so that he can muffle a moan right into Draco’s feverish skin.
Harry narrows his eyes. “What? By who?” He realises that this sounds like an admission, so clarifies. “There’s nothing. We’re fine.”
Narrowed grey eyes. “Why? Oh, maybe because you’re rushing into it quicker than you rushed out of auror training.”
. Like I can’t stop it. And it doesn’t happen here,” he adds, kind of hastily, looking at Harry to make sure he’s heard that. “I come home and I’m just. Good, again. Fine. Calm. But.” He pauses. Looks into the distance, through the kitchen cabinet and to who knows where.
“Harry.” Draco stretches out his hands. Harry takes them, gets drawn back into Draco’s arms. “Listen to me. For a second.”
Hermione is sitting on the floor with Luna in the living room, both the girls using their wands to syphon off smaller and smaller flows of red wine out of the cream carpets below them. Hermione is very drunk, and in tears, muttering about whether she’ll be getting her deposit back.
God though, if Harry thought he could get away with being selfish about this, he would. He’d split those scars right down the middle and let them bleed out that little bit more, so he can understand this too. But he doesn’t.
Harry could cast a countercurse. But he’s almost thankful. A gift, from Draco, before their imminent destruction.
Ron narrows his eyes and takes a proper look at Harry. It distracts him from his terror for a moment. “What’s wrong?” Ron questions.
Harry can’t answer immediately, so caught up in knowing this has happened that he’s side-tracked in catching up to the present.
Harry is starting to wonder about whether there is a deadly curse on the damn ring because of how Draco is reacting, and he’s itching to snatch the girl’s hand across the table to tear it off just in case, but then Draco clears his throat. “No. Yes. Yes, sorry, I think that one is mine. I was wondering where it’d gone.”
Harry rolls his eyes, goes to hand back the ring, probably a half centimetre of a brushed silver with delicate etchings of vines circling the radius. The shop-keep holds out a hand with an impatient expression. Harry takes another look at it. Hesitates.
Draco and Luna get stuck in a conversation about Rolf and Luna’s new international connections whilst substituting at young witch and wizard summer camps. It continues in just the right way to remind Harry that he’s drunk enough to be extremely tired. The headboard and Hermione’s extra pillows provide a lovely backing to a small nap, especially for the guest of honour…
Harry jumps. There’s Draco, sitting on the bare mattress in one of his day robes. He looks worried about something, staring at his lap, and Harry feels his chest tighten slightly. “Hi?” comes out as a question.
Through Harry’s fuzzy ears, the sound of blood pumping and Draco’s breathing and his alternating whispers of
And then suddenly Draco’s moving Harry away and jumping down off the table to pace the kitchen floor. He gets a little too close to a cabinet near his head every so often and the cabinets move out of his way. He doesn’t even notice; Draco has his eyes closed tightly. Like it hurts.
Harry, who is standing and saying goodbye all on his own, Draco having gone upstairs to shower after a quick goodbye, has a laugh forced out of him.
But Harry pressed the heel of one hand right into an eye and in the spotty darkness of his vision can see Mirrors that show someone’s truest desires, and a ruby Stones that make you immortal; an enchanted Goblet, and a Vanishing cabinet. A wand, a stone, a cloak. He sees six segments of a mad man’s soul and the seventh that marked his own death. What part of his life hasn’t been coloured by powerful magical objects, harmless or not?
He laughs. “Yes,” he says, in answer to whatever question had been muddled through the chipping paint and warped conservation charm over the years, and trundles back up to the attic to bring another down.
He’s not… completely familiar with the area. It’s definitely some commercial district, nowhere close to the Leaky, but he thinks he can recognise a couple of the taller buildings, and knows that he could probably find his way if he needed to. He pats the pockets of his pants and realises that he’s left his brick of a phone back at Grimmauld, which isn’t the end of the world, given that he has his… wand…
Ron whoops, runs quickly around the corner and squeezes Draco’s arms together, kisses his head a few times. “Oh, you legend.”
Draco still hasnt said a word since he stopped muttering foul language at the sight of the wand. This 17 year old seems too quietly confident to be even the requisite amount of mad required for a Black. As Draco thought though, the nose is right, and the chin. It makes him... kind of fond for the kid he hasn't seen since he was 5. Especially when Teddy is looking up at him like hes worried beyond belief for a silent man in the middle of Diagon who's a bit too fragile for his own good.
“I just.” Draco breaths deep. “What if one day I wake up and I don’t love those things anymore? What if I wake up and the sight of your shoes all over the entry way makes me want to
years. He lets a hand drop to Draco’s head, hair curled after a night of humid rooms and the summer rain.
The conversation continues to hang. Ron cardons onto something, when both Draco and Harry start speaking too much and too loudly so that others can’t get an edge in. They’re all at a nicer restaurant when a couple gets engaged in the middle of the room. Harry knows why they’ve both suddenly become absolute clowns, but Ron can’t know. Surely. They just continue to drink for an excuse, and they stumble home drunk and horny just before midnight, and don’t bring it up.
A crash another second later sees Ron running back down the stairs, wine and flutes in the crook of an arm, shirt still off. “Whatever this -” he gestures between Harry and Draco “- was, we’ll talk, okay?”
It’s a similar pattern in a couple of the other bedrooms. Pulled off bed sheets and even more crap spewed across the floors. More sheets are vanished to the laundry.
He looks away from Ron’s red face and meets Draco’s. White face. Like a sheet, all the flush from the alcohol completely drained away. Harry’s concern ratchets up about a thousand notches and he quickly looks back to Ron with a demand on his lips.
Draco’s eyes bulge. Harry looks again at the paper, and looks back at Luna in quick succession. Harry meets Draco’s flustered gaze. “Well,” Draco asks impatiently, “is he
There’s an apartment building ahead, a bit cheerful from the outdoors, and definitely slightly rundown when he gets a look through the plexiglass front door. The intercom has been through the ringer, and only a few buttons are working, but that’s fine. The one he needs definitely is. He buzzes.
, Loony.” Draco says pompously. Harry doesn’t turn to pay them any attention, but he listens in as he continues through the boxes.
“Oh, good!” is suddenly yelled right next to their ears, causing Draco to jump uncoordinatedly and Harry to tense his arms to keep the both of them stable least Draco pull them to the floor.
Draco’s eyebrows narrow into a creased line, and he wobbles the paper, as if he’s expecting the words to magically change. “I don’t understand.”
He leaves his shoes with the rest of the mess. Wanders down the hall. Stops in the alcove at the bottom to the kitchen. Watches Draco where he leans against the counter with his crossed arms and his tapping feet. Gets vertigo when the tapping increases and increases. Harry blanches and looks away.
He’s realising this was a terrible bloody idea. He clicks his tongue, looks over the little plinths beneath him. “They’re a bit awful, aren’t they?”
Harry. Hates them all. All of the terribly obnoxious jewels and their exorbitant price tags. Hates the little velvet boxes too, which all look surprisingly tacky in the light from the street. He walks closer to the window, places his hands up to cup his eyes and looks in ever closer. Maybe it’s the glare of the window, and him getting closer will let him truly appreciate what he’s looking at.
Now curious, Harry snatches it out of his grasp. He can’t make much sense of the jumbled letters either.
“I’ve been offered a research position with a creature-studies non-profit,” Rolf says, “so that will keep me quite busy.”
Harry is wide-eyed. Draco has apparently felt enough concern that he comes out of the bowl so their eyes meet.
Harry winces, thinks of the state of the house if there are people asleep in all the bedrooms over all the floors.
“I just assume it’s a literal thing.” He continues, now holding the ring up in front of his vision to turn it in the light. “We had those conversations, and the ring heard us, and is now trying to get in front of my face whenever it can.”
Harry scoffs. "Leave off. No smoke screens, please. From what I've heard you're out of Level 9 - don't bring it here."
Draco groans, and they slow down to breath, like a clock that’s gently ticking to a stop. They separate, lips shiny, and leans their foreheads together. Harry finds his arms have migrated to sit tightly around Draco’s hips, hands clenched into robes like they won’t be moving for the life of him. Draco’s elbows are resting on Harry’s chest and his hands are right at the bottom of his head, twisted in Harry’s dark hair.
“You’re annoyed that we’re missing Paris?” It’s not getting any clearer in Draco’s mind, from what Harry can see. But Draco doesn’t bother sitting up any more. He puts his palms flat on Harry’s chest and moves them up to first his shoulders, and then around his neck, as Draco’s upper body slowly moves down to rest heavy and comfortable, torso to torso. “We’ve rescheduled, as you well know.”
Harry feels his breathing get quicker, but suddenly Draco’s got his hand grasped right under his chin. Then Draco’s head is resting on his shoulder. Harry drops his head onto Draco’s and feels a little better. Feels all that bubbly love and anxiety and anticipation settle down a little at how close Draco is.
Harry feels something like uncertainty pull in his gut. “What’s wrong, mate?” He’s thinking about any number of things that could have possibly gone wrong in the house. Someone’s accidentally undone the layers and layers of charms that Draco and Harry had spent months configuring around Aunt Walburga; the stairs to the second bathroom have been driven to hostility to keep people away; the muggles have actually started drinking the fire-whisky and are liking it
Draco clarifies. “You know, seeing as the Granger-Weasley contingent is becoming a reality. We’ve had the conversation arise. Once or twice.”
again. “Must’ve been your planning. Triggered the magic, and then there it was, in my pocket right when we turned up at Hermione’s.”
He is unfortunately stopped from falling off the edge of thought and into temporary bliss by the sudden blast of noise and argument on the other side of the bedroom door, followed by an incredibly drunk Hermione and a cacophony of bodies bumping and shouting in the hall behind her.
Ron is distracted at something Draco whispers in his ear. He’s furrowing his eyes in confusion and looking at the both of them like he’s trying to figure something out. “Are you two okay?”
“I rather think,” Luna starts, “that when riddles seem too difficult, such that they plague us, looking back can be the best cause for an answer.”
Draco’s favourite. Harry’s too. They generously douse their plates in the cheese they also picked up from the market just the Saturday before, until the rind is stupidly close to their wands. Draco places the rind in the freezer bag with the others. Harry keeps saying he’ll use them in a sauce or a soup at one point. There are at least 8 parmesan rinds in the freezer now.
“Why did you have to be born today.” It’s not a question. Draco is nuzzling the words into Harry’s jeaned thigh, as comfortable as he usually gets when drinking. He’s not tonight, though. He’s the Designated Disapparator, a mantle and responsibility he engages in with a lot of pride.
me” – and they’re cautioned that they’ll have to dispose of all of the wizarding alcohol at the least. Ginny, who’s been sitting on the first landing and watching the proceedings with Blaise groans loudly at this, and Draco turns round to glare at her.
Ron stands up suddenly, chair creaking at the moment, and then suddenly the air in the room is forced to move enough that the tension left over from Draco’s strange moment breezes on. “Pass those plates over, Niamh?”
Another grind. Harry’s panting as this continues, Draco’s lips everywhere and his hips unceasing and then suddenly he can’t take it.
It’s a mess. Parvati and Seamus, consultants with the department of Muggle and Magical Cooperation are drunkenly keeping the glamours up where needed around the house. They’re – unfortunately - constantly having to fix and correct each other’s work.
“I love you!” is this stupid chant that the four of them just keep yelling while they cry. Ginny’s in there next thing, and then Blaise. Someone’s singing some terrible Wizarding song about
It’s half an hour before they sort out the situation. Parvati and Seamus claw their way to the front to assure the aurors that they actually
But that’s their Saturday. They hunker down on the couch, play the wireless, read their respective books or sports magazines, and they wallow away the night until they find it late enough to justify sex.
Ginny rolls her eyes. “Blaise, you’re such a tattle.” She continues to kick at his leg, now that she can’t reach his chair.
He looks at Draco to find the man looking slightly smug at Harry’s lack of information. “They’re moving back,” he says. “Properly, this time.”
Draco gapes, and then glowers, before slumping back in his seat, seemingly content not to press further.
been more annoyed than normal. You’re not usually this much of a shit.” Draco shuffles forward and grabs Harry’s chin so that Harry can’t look away. Harry feels suddenly very on the spot and very overwhelmed, and looks at Draco’s thin lips so he’s not looking at Draco’s bright grey eyes. He’s very bad at secret keeping when he’s drunk. This is going to become a disaster.
Draco is looking at Harry. Harry sighs in relief. Makes him feel better. That this isn’t one of those moments when Draco doesn’t want to talk about something. It’s good. But Draco’s looking at Harry like he’s confused and concerned and needs to know something. Right now.
So they all get out of his house with promises to see each other that same evening. Blaise is the last one at the front door, Ginny having walked off mere moments earlier. He’s looking at her as she walks away, and then he speaks. “They don’t even live together, you know?”
“Uh,” He thinks again. “Yes.” He’s pretty certain. Would never put it past Draco to want to conduct a meaningful moment.
And that got it, because Harry laughs. Loud and booming, echoing across the cobbles and the stone walls. "And you think he has no Black madness!"
“Who in their right minds would be able to sleep through that?” Blaise groans. It sounds muffled which – ahh. It is. His face is pressed right into the kitchen table. Ginny has a foot out and keeps kicking Blaise’s chair in an un-even tempo.
But he doesn’t. It’s just. Absolutely none of them are interesting in the slightest. There are a couple that stand out just because they’re the brightest, or have the most intricate detailing, but there’s truly nothing… magical about them.
There are clothes articles, so many shirts, a couple of hats, one or two spare shoes that he searches the house for seconds of, and a couple of pairs of pants. It’s a wonder people left the house the previous evening without their hats, or their shirts, a single shoe, or completely trouserless. Thankfully he doesn’t find a single bag or wallet or other concerning item left behind in the halls, and then he gets started on the cleaning.
“Here, here!” comes, slurred and booming, from deep in the room, and a smattering of laughter greets it.
Harry looks at Draco disbelievingly, to see an almost identical look. Draco says: “where have you been?”
“No, no. No!” Draco points a finger at Harry’s face. “This isn’t some sign, Harry. This isn’t some… manifestation of my cold feet, or. Or. It’s not a
He squares his shoulders, rests his weight on a single foot, plants his hands on the glass. She looks at where they make contact, and Harry has to stop himself from rolling his eyes. “I’m, uh, looking for an engagement ring. For my boyfriend.”
Draco turns to look at Harry, and raises an eyebrow. Harry scoffs in his face, as if this has any true bearing on their conversation. It
“Do you,” and she shrugs before she continues with: “do you just want to look at a few? You don’t look like you’ve got anyplace to be.”
Someone shouts, someone else follows, and then there’s a loud wave of everyone’s excitement, before someone – Ginny? – yells “shut up!”
Harry moans again and squeezes his eyes shut. His hands coming around his stomach, and he squeezes hard, finding a small amount of comfort in it. Honestly, it comes to the point where the sounds of Draco’s retching start to sooth Harry into a sort of lucidity.
Impulsively, Harry’s own nostrils flare. Low blow, and Draco’s eyes flash with success - he knows it, too. “How is that you not being
Draco says “seven,” Neville says “eight,” and Blaise says “no, Pansy and Della are still here, it’s ten.”
It’s the third floor where their bedroom is. Harry strips this one too, and at this point decides to shower before he puts the washing machine on. Walking into the bathroom, which was last seen earlier that morning from the downwards direction of the toilet’s porcelain bowl, Harry strips and doesn’t bother thinking further on that.
Harry pats the hob, and it flickers sorrowfully for a second. A wave of Harry’s wand, cast iron pans banging atop the burners, though, and suddenly it’s right back to normal. Eggs and bacon follow at a quick pace too as Harry
Niamh looks a little lost, like she can sense the nuance in the air, but is trying to brush it off. “Okay! Oh, I’m so sorry, I’m not sure how I ended up with it. I barely left the living room last night.”
” His voice is forceful, and Harry thinks there’s something like scorn in those grey eyes. He feels his back straighten, getting ready for a fight, before suddenly Draco just droops. He says, voice so much softer “don’t.”
He squares his shoulders, and shoulders through the door, the security features swinging back with a violence as soon as he’s crossed comfortably over the threshold.
wedding. Just over here.” She walks over to another section. Harry really does just want to leave, but he thinks he kind of has to stick it out now, so he follows her.
Draco’s still white as a sheet, but he manages a smile at his lips and pulls Ron in for a quick, back-slapping hug.
Draco manages to look simultaneously like his heart has broken and also that he’s happy he’s been proven right. “Exactly.”
As they bump down the stairs, Draco has his wand out and is collecting cups and glasses. Harry’s taking a more direct approach and every time he sees something out of place, he’s vanishing it to the sitting room. Easier to just sort the shit out in one room, he thinks.
Harry just stares blankly at the man. Ron gestures again and narrows his eyes, to which Harry nods fast. Draco must have too, because Ron looks satisfied, nods, and climbs back up the stairs without another glance.
"You've named the shop Curiosity's Curios, Harry. You can't blame me for trying to adhere to tradition."
And of course that's the Black nose. Draco's nose. And this is Aunt Andromeda's ward - grandkid - the metamorph. And that's still 12 inches of Cherry directed right at his bleeding nose, and Draco has a split second out of body experience where he remembers that time he broke this kid's godfathers' nose when he was about the same age.
“You’re quite a pessimistic person, Draco,” Rolf ponders heartily as he dumps the tea tray in the middle of the table, atop mountains of tottering piles of paper. “We’ve found plenty of oral evidence that there are horned, pig snouted beasts that wonder in far off parts.”
Ron grins. Apparently, his terror has vanished in the face of Harry’s weirdness. Well. At least Harry’s doing good work as Ron’s best friend. “Tonight! I couldn’t wait. And everyone’s here. She likes a bit of a big deal made about her, I think.”
“You want to be happy? You want to be sure? Fucking fine. We’ll do it.” Harry closes his eyes, presses his palms against them as hard as he can before they start to hurt. “Just don’t leave.”
He blacks out the majority of the memory, but then finds himself blinking his eyes open beside the bottom of the toilet, hearing the sweet sounds of Draco vomiting his guts out above him. Harry moans again from his foetal position.
She nods again. “Right. Well, we’ve got these more understated, classic rings. Quite thick, which is very stylish, and silver really does go with everything.”
“On what grounds!” calls an incredibly drunk girl… who is most definitely a friend of Hermione’s from Uni, holding a steaming glass of fire-whisky. The prune-juice has been breached. Harry sighs, gently takes it from her, and she settles back into a slumber on the couch against Neville, who’s snoring and has missed the whole debacle.
Ron doesn’t seem to be convinced. Draco says “don’t worry about us. Isn’t there something you have to do?” with a big wide smile.
Whilst Harry stands to take it all in slightly longer, Draco finds a seat near immediately, one that boasts a pretty generous backing, with the velvet cushion. He sweeps his arm in a wide arc, and the scrolls in front of him roll haphazard across the tablecloth. “Where’s Rolf?” he asks.
White blond hair flops about a bit as Draco shakes himself out, but then he's pulling the t-shirt on and reaching down to grab the joggers, jumping to get into them fast as Harry backs towards the door. They get out of it one after the other, Draco naked from the waist up, Harry in nothing but pants.
“That was good, Draco! We got to seven!” That’s from Luna, who Draco is not listening to, because he’s too busy adjusting the feather boa with a wordless wave of his wand. Harry glares at him.
She smiles with one half of her mouth, a little sympathetically. “Well, you don’t seem to be too confident with it. Do you think he’d do it? Propose?”
“In here!” comes called from another doorway Harry knows leads to a kitchen. Draco and Luna get caught a quiet little conversation, and Harry does a loop, looks at a couple of new pictures he doesn’t recognise. Luna and Rolf with masses of young wizarding children from across the globe – set on beaches or fields or mountain tops.
Draco glowers, still looking at Harry. “Mind your business, harlot.” He leans away - hand slipping slowly off his hip and turns to face the rest of the kitchen. Harry won’t be turning around unless his life is in danger, but a quick glance over his shoulder shows a table of politely occupied guests. Harry’s face burns quickly, and he flips a bunch of eggs to look busy.
Harry rolls his eyes, and turns away, leaves the store without a final word. He’s sure he can hear her cackle to herself before the heavy security door shuts with a ring behind him.
He trips up on a pair of shoes that are out in the middle of the hallway when he gets to the front door, and swears loudly. The light on the wall flickers at him impatiently, but he ignores it.
Niamh looks sceptical, incredibly hungover, and definitely a little lost. She tilts her head in an ‘
“I won’t drink.” Harry says, memories of the morning stuck in his black behind his eyelids. And his nose. And his stomach. Hangover potion be damned.
She shrugs again. “Well, you don’t really look like you’re all that keen to buy anything. Why waste my time? I’ve afternoon-tea in fifteen minutes. You’d hold me up.”
She pulls out the tray with the etched silver rings. A couple of them remind him of the runes that the Archive uses, sprawling, connecting things that look nothing like Draco’s Ancient Runes books. Weaves and swirls joining back around.
“Yep.” Draco says with a pop around the ‘p’. “Even Kreacher said, he passed it over to me, and said something along the lines of, ‘
“You know what I mean. Anyway, even if you had been blood-related, you’re too good to have ever fallen in with the magic-supremacists.”
Regardless of the blip, everyone sorts themselves out quite quickly. Ron is carrying a bag which is clinking like it’s stuffed full of Elven wine, and Hermione is leaning against his side near the kitchen table as Ron and Draco talk gently about whatever nonsense is happening with the Diagon Alley Business Association.
of July. Harry is in the backroom of Hermione’s flat, sat on her spare bed across from Draco and Luna. The two blondes are trapped in a ridiculous hand game that gets more and more intense every time their hands slap together. Harry still has his eyes on them purely because he’s hiding from the rest of the guests, and he’s quite drunk.
“Nothing.” Harry quickly gets out, and then lets go of Draco to grab Ron and pull him into a rough hug. Ron laughs a little manically and hugs back tightly. It gives Harry a chance to calm down his heart.
” He stands up and runs his hands through his hair in frustration. “This is why I didn’t want to tell you.”
“Not like, yesterday. But a couple of weeks back. I don’t know what we were all doing, but you guys were being weird. She said something like, isn’t it great when loved ones are allowed an opportunity to take care of their own lives. Which I guess meant ‘leave off’. So, I did.” Here she looks at Harry dead on. “But you get trapped up here,” and she knocks at his head a little too hard. Harry shoves her fist away from his forehead and she laughs. “It’s true though, you know? And if it’s about you two and you can’t talk about it, I get it.” She seems to consider her words a little, and then shrugs. “Mostly. But you’ll be okay, you know?”
Harry rolls his eyes at the suggestion that this was the appropriate outcome for their not-just-closest friends, to get black out drunk on firewhisky like a bunch of 5
“That’s not what I meant, and you know it.” Harry scrunches his nose up. “And we’d be more fun if you didn’t smell like you’ve been swimming in undistilled alcohol.”
“Huh?” Draco looks bewildered, face relaxing next when he remembers his earlier words, and then straight back into bewildered when he realises that Harry’s avoiding the question. “I don’t know. We had those plans, didn’t we?”
The noise of the party has basically vanished from his mind; all he can hear is Draco, sober in Hermione’s guest bedroom,
Harry’s hands have clawed their way underneath Draco’s shirt, and his nails are gently dragging their way down his skin, causing Draco to shiver and groan and kiss back so, so hard into Harry.
It’s Ron, and Draco punches the red-head hard on the right shoulder. “Fucking hell, Weasley. How are you so loud?”
“Tea’s ready!” trawls through the living room instead, and Harry sighs, and pushes his forehead harder against Draco’s. He leans back, takes a look at Draco’s pained eyes, and then lets go, his hands loosening on the fabric of Draco’s robes.
. Remember two years ago? My face blown up in the paper the next day because that stray bludger had smacked me in the face at the Harpies match?”
Draco sighs, and then flops back down on the bed. “I found it in the house when we moved in. Kreacher had it in his
Harry gapes. “No, no,” he starts, trying to convince her of something. “No, I don’t need this. It was
They say goodbye to everyone they care about. Pansy is making out with her long-term Bulgarian girlfriend on Hermione’s bed, Neville and Parvati are caught in an inane limbo competition in the (very narrow) kitchen. Blaise and Ron are playing darts in the single toilet; they keep being forced out every few minutes for another emergency. “We keep clearing the air every time someone uses it; it’s not a big deal,” comes from Blaise when Draco frowns in disgust at the awful grunting being expelled from a hasty user when Harry and Draco catch them outside of the door.
And Harry. Pauses. And thinks it through, a little. Why rush? Because there’s a feeling in his chest that tells him he’s worried that it may never happen. That him and Draco may never get engaged in front of all their friends and get drunk off sparkly celebration wine. Or that they’ll never get portraits done to stick in this house for their great grandchildren to mock when they run down the halls, the house moving obstacles as they go.
Thankfully, because as soon as Draco sighs out in violent relief the house reminds them of the urgency of the situation. The mirror rattles dangerously – pipes in the walls groan.
They make it out without any more stalling. The other party guests don’t actually seem to care that it’s Harry’s birthday.
As he walks down the crowded sidewalk, shops all up one side, cars and buses bustling for room up the other, he finally starts to notice some of the stores. Or one in particular, white outdoor finish and a large display window that catches his eye, filled with small little velvet boxes holding up precious stones and metals, all of which are shining too brightly in his eyes.
“I can’t believe I’m doing this.” Ron’s looking down at the little box, maroon velvet, and Harry’s heart squeezes, and it’s not even just for whatever he’s feeling about him and Draco. He’s suddenly feeling so much happiness and love for his best friends that he wants to shout as loud as he can in this noisy fucking house.
“Ye ol’ extravagance gifted yonder hous, ‘morrow!” a curmudgeonly old fool in breeches announces as Harry places him kindly back on the sitting room’s wall.
He wants to give Draco a break. The evening prior, what he can remember of it anyway, was surely like splitting the man open at his scarred chest again, mopping up his heart and his guts with his hands and a bottle of disguised liquor. It’s still sensitive. Whatever the deal with the ring is, Harry will learn it all in good time. Surely.
Rolf looks Harry in the eye with some type of commiseration, but Harry winces. Rolf laughs. “Once or twice? That performance-” he gestures in a round “-was nothing but a
She just looks at him. The door rings, and she flicks her gaze over to another customer quickly, seeing her colleague move to help. Then the bell rings again, and she looks again. Harry watches her face from his periphery, and wonders about how happy she’ll be when he walks out and doesn’t buy a thing. He stares at a ring. It’s silver, thick banded, and it has etchings of vines.
Harry is still gaping like a fish when he remembers himself, and forces the door back open, just in time to see Draco’s form escape into a door right down the end of a magically extended hallway.
customers browsing, some looking up every couple of seconds to see if they can catch the eye of a shop-keeper. His nostrils flare whilst keeping in a huff of laughter.
Hermione doesn’t look fazed. Glares a little harder at the elements. “Next time I’m over I’m bringing a wrench and a manual with me.”
Draco spits out laughing and falls back onto the bed, game abandoned through his cackling. “Oh Merlin, that was excellent.” Luna slaps Draco on the leg hard enough that he lets out a squeal and jerks up to glare at her. Harry leans over to give her a kiss on the cheek in appreciation.
“I think that,” Harry supposes, jumping uncoordinatedly to get the trousers on after his underwear. “That is such a crap thought.”
It allows Harry to wander further in and lean up against the fridge in effortless silence. He gets the milk out when the tea has been brewing for the requisite five minutes. Watches Draco
He’s not going anywhere particular. Trying not to think about what he should be doing, not thinking about what he should have done. Instead, he’s forcing himself to think about the noise of the train, and the muffled chatter from people around him. Think about the announcements as they come over the speaker, and then he’s thinking about whether being on the Tube is still relaxing, or whether it’s becoming slowly claustrophobic, as it tends to when he rides it for too long.
Luna laughs politely. “No.” She doesn’t offer anything further before she turns around and heads down the hall.
Draco moves another time, a quick jerk when a stronger breeze crests the top of the trees at the end of the garden, enough for the sound to echo back down to them. Tickles the flames in its path. Draco stares at Harry, like he’s finally figured out what to say. But then the breeze settles down, and the flames go back to their normal, and Draco seems to deflate.
“Oh, you know” she says, brushing a hand against her opposite shoulder casually. “You’re both acting weird. Have been for a while. I want to get it out of one or both of you, but I’ve been scared off.”
Ron huffs a laugh, rubs his hand against the back of his head. “You didn’t see me get engaged about two hours ago? Living room upstairs… it was pretty loud, I’m sure you couldn’t have missed it.”
He pulls it open. Looks through bottles he normally wouldn’t bother to touch. Hair potions, hangover potions, something for skin, a couple of bottles that looked South Korean that Draco had definitely bought himself.
Harry legs it down too, and is just in time to see Draco throw floo powder into the grate, and then hastens across the obstacle course that is Luna’s living room and grabs Draco’s arm, pulling him away from the green flames.
After the portraits are returned, and the sounds of the muffled chatter scatter once again through the halls, the sitting room with its stacks of left-over objects next on Harry’s list.
The vague memory of the conversations and the gulp upon gulp of the fire-whisky feels poignant now, although Harry is certain if they sat down and properly discussed it that it would feel disjointed and repetitive, like two drunk 23 year olds overstating their own importance.
Harry questions whether he should’ve been selfish and taken the bloody joggers for himself. “Put your pants on so we can figure out what’s wrong with the house!”
Harry kisses Hermione on the head again. Gives Luna one. Gives Hermione another. Misses when Ron and Hermione would be solving his problems right next to him.
He frowns. Thinks of the ring, in all its shining silver pompousness, dropped and the curled right into Draco’s fist.
Harry gets distracted, and hastily flicks a glance over his shoulder to see Luna swing a hand out from the hallway. “Uh, yeah, hi Luna.” He turns back to Draco just as hastily to see the man with an eyebrow raised in his most irritated and insulted expression. Harry short circuits for a second, just enough time for Draco to glare harder.
Harry feels a fresh breeze of peace flush through his system after the horrifying nausea passes; it’s an added benefit of the potions that Draco buys that they flush the outsides too. Harry gets to look in the mirror over the sink and see the two of them together in a pretty reasonable state. Still mostly undressed, but good enough to leave the room.
…” he trails off, staring deeply into Harry’s eyes, and steps forward until the two of them are staring each other down, their chests mere centimetres from each other. Right there in Luna’s living room.
Hermione’s University friends are very drunk, and kind of stoned, and they keep asking difficult questions that the house itself keeps wanting to fight through the glamour to answer irritably. Thankfully Hermione, the devoted love of Harry’s life, is sober as anything and is doing a generally good job at corralling it all.
He closes his fist around it, works his jaw. Meets her knowing eyes. “I’ll, uh. I’ll hold onto it.” She starts to smile. “Just in case I change my mind.” He grabs his wallet and tucks the bit of paper with the bank notes. Just in case.
They make it to bed another hour later, drunk and red eyed. They don’t make it to the market the next morning.
August turns into September, which turns into Hermione’s birthday, which turns into a two-week belated party at their own home. The floo has been deactivated for the evening at risk of one of Hermione’s muggle friends watching someone stumble drunk out of green fire. Instead, the front door is swung right open and being kept that way with the help of a trusty troll’s foot umbrella stand.
Draco tucks his head in against the side of Harry’s, nestling himself in Harry’s curls. Just for that moment, he feels content. He almost asks whether they can just skip the conversation.
Harry sits up straight. “You asked me last night if I even had a ring. And I said ‘no’, right? Which you used as some evidence that I wasn’t ready for marriage.”
He misses the backroom and Luna’s silly hand games most of all. When Draco’s weight was right on top of him and small kisses were being planted on Harry’s face and neck. When Harry thought that this was going to be his life until death. Do they part. Or whatever.
Harry turns his head rapidly, worried that something too magical has happened and she’s about to have a heart-attack, but she’s staring at her hand. A hand that is definitely shining.
“Right,” says Niamh, standing up slowly from here seat. “Thank you very much for breakfast, and for the coffee, and for letting me stay the night on your couch.” She nods politely to Harry and Draco, and then moves off to hug Hermione goodbye. Hermione asks whether she’ll make it to the pub tonight, but a shake of the head answers that. Neville, who has barely talked to Niamh once the entire morning, seems to deflate a little at this, but he’s suddenly up and out of his seat to follow her up the stairs.
Harry thinks on this for a second. What he’d want. Definitely something that wouldn’t get in the way… But. He doesn’t think he’d care what it looked like, at all. As long as it was from Draco.
He’s stopped in his tracks by what he finally notices. Between Ron’s hands is a small box; it doesn’t take a genius to figure out what’s in it.
His nose stings, and he can feel the beginnings of blood dripping atop his cupid's bow and down his chin. He's not hyperventilating now: thank Merlin for small mercy's. He turns to direct his swearing at the person who startled a man in the middle of a panic attack, blood flooding down his face, and sees a wand directed right at his nose.
He looks around the street, at the foot traffic and landmarks, and – thinks he realises where he is. He sets off in the direction toward the sun, and in about fifteen minutes, knows he’s right.
Ron straightens his back, and looks up at her. “Hermione. You’ve been.” Ron’s face seems to crumple, but then he composes himself. “You’ve been everything to me for so bloody long.” A big echoing breath.
think Harry. Freezes just the slightest amount, but Draco doesn’t miss it. The leg grip loosens, and suddenly Draco has launched himself up into a sitting position to stare right in Harry’s face, eyes narrowed in question. Harry avoids his gaze.
“That’s not true.” Neville says, eyes lost on something in the distance. “I remember feeling pretty content with Ron’s 21
Harry answers in the manner of one who is profoundly irritated with the situation he has found himself in. “Divine prophecy, I guess.”
Harry is sure he’s looking back in the same way. But there’s cake, and all of his closest and not-so friends crowding around Hermione’s tiny little apartment living room, crowding out onto the balcony where possible to escape the overwhelming heat of the apartment in mid-summer.
Draco looks manic. Still. Harry opens his mouth to press him, but then the door is jerking open again.
“We’ve not given up!” yells Rolf joyously. Harry’s head jerks up from a suspended three-legged spider to see Rolf’s large grin bless their presence, tea tray floating unsteadily behind him. “We’ve just delayed our inevitable discovery!”
“Well,” Ron thinks, “I think I saw Neville asleep on the couch with Hermione’s friend from legal-method. And there was someone sleeping on the stairs, but I accidentally kicked them on the way down and they kind of ran… Maybe there’s people asleep in some of the rooms?”
’ kind of movement, and sits down in the empty seat between a red and sheepish Neville and worried looking Ron, but accepts the easy slide of the mug across the table. Harry’s concerned as she picks it up, wonders whether she’ll question the apparent lack of friction on the wood, but doesn’t. Good sport.
When he opens the door to the hallway, it’s a similar story. Paintings line the walls and the ceiling is printed with intricate designs of the moon’s phases. He walks down and stops under a waxing crescent, where Luna and Rolf’s front door is. He knocks.
work crap shifts at their crap jobs, or are studying until the early hours to make up for being on a 7pm to 10pm bender on a Wednesday.
Blaise says “that was weird.” Ginny kicks him under the table, but then kind of just looks at Draco with narrow eyes like she agrees with her victim.
He climbs the flights, which get a little bit more vibrant in colour scheme as he goes up. Just before the right floor he’s gifted with a look at a few smaller paintings, some of which he recognises as runes that probably
Draco laughs, squeezes the arm around Harry. “Ron. Aurors came about an hour back and told us to vanish it all.”
The grey eyes that meet his look menacing, and Harry rolls his eyes and paces out of the bathroom and into the bedroom to look for something to cover his arse. He grabs a shirt and tugs it on over his mess of hair, and picks another up of the floor.
s, the vibrations travelling through his lips and down Harry’s arm. “I lose my right to bypass hard conversations.”
They’ve made their way through pleasant conversation with their friends and sometimes their co-workers and so many people they don’t know because Harry didn’t care if people bought people.
I really love stopping characters from talking by being interrupted. It's sexy. Like UST, but more unresolved communicated tension. UCT.
That right there is a ring. Ostentatious, silver, and definitely not Hermione’s engagement ring which is sitting pretty and delicate on her hand.
When Harry's eyes meet Dracos, all 3 meters of space and a 17 year old kid between them, Draco feels like hes 24 again. When Harry's eyes go wide with shock, that must be 20. When his eyes narrow, then that's 18 (post trial). And then when Harry pulls his wand and points it at Draco, well, that's years 11 all the way through to 17.
Hermione loses whatever battle she’d been facing, and she starts crying, no holds barred. Ron follows. Draco’s been crying for the last five minutes right on Harry’s shoulder.
Draco reaches it, surely expecting it to be for Harry or him, when suddenly the small little letter starts to shake itself off, and then up it gets, rising right into the air. A howler.
?” Harry exclaims. “What you told me last night was that you’re worried that you’re going to stop loving me one day, because that’s how marriages
He grips harder, and Harry hasn’t even asked a question, but it feels like he has an answer already. Harry’s arms wrap swiftly around Draco’s waist, tightens until the giggles peter off and what’s left is Draco’s lips pressed firmly against Harry’s soft skin. Is Draco mumbling words? Harry isn’t sure. He doesn’t care, really, unless it’s “no”.
“Maybe we can design some sort of signal, or a flare of sparks, if one feels the need to ruin their youth.”
He doesn’t get far into the crouch before his arm is wrenched around and there stands Draco with a somewhat manic expression.
Harry looks at their front door as Draco opens it with the muggle key they insisted on installing, and feels nothing but loss. Hatred at the thought that he’ll have to deal with this place without Draco.
"Fuck- fuck, Sir I'm really sorry. Let me. Can I just fix- oh. Wait," and then there's a hand on Dracos shoulder, and the picture in front of his face clears a little now that theres an anchoring to his woozy drifting: he sees a young man, bright pink hair, yellow amber eyes, and looking scared to shit. Alarm bells ring momentarily, before the kid says: "... Mr. Malfoy?"
, Draco?” Harry leans further in, until Draco’s crossed arms are pressed right up to his chest between them. “You tell me you’re worried that times can change and that you’ll stop
Hermione yells “I need a drink! I’m fucking engaged!” and then Draco and Harry get their ass into gear, stumbling down to the kitchen and throwing a few spells around to get conjured flutes of the sparkling Elven wine stacked on top of each other, and then everyone in the house is downing glass after glass of the stuff. One of the muggles yells out “holy hell!” when they see the stack, and Harry has to quickly grab onto the floating trays.
Draco, whom Harry assumes isn’t paying much attention to his hunched over figure, continues onward. “Then, the next morning I found it in my pocket and put it back in the cupboard before we went out. And then it showed up a couple of days after. I’m surprised you hadn’t seen it. But I guess I was keeping an eye on it.” He sighs. “You know, we weren’t having the conversations we needed to have, and then the ring was getting impatient. And we talked last night! We discussed this! We don’t want to be married! We cried, for Merlin’s sake. Got drunk off our rockers, and then in the bathroom this morning I checked and it just. Wasn’t there.”
of August is early. Saturdays are a vibrant addendum to their monotonous weeks, and Harry pushes Draco out of bed come 8am. Draco barely complains. They’re used to these early Saturday mornings, regardless of whatever excellent nonsense occurred the night before.
Ron’s smile doesn’t waver and he leans his head in agreement. “Just give me a couple of minutes, alright?”
Draco seems to have the same thought. “You’re incredible, Hermione,” Draco says from his continued sprawl. “Ten firewhiskies down and still giving out pitch perfect lectures.”
, Granger?” Ron just grins at her in response. Hermione must be pretending she’d not paying attention.
“I can’t believe you silencio’d the door! We’ve been calling for you three for the last 10 minutes.” She looks halfway to collapse, but nary a slur has coloured her words.
Della clears her throat and looks at where Niamh is playing conversation tennis, whilst chewing slowly around a mouthful. “I am told time and again when they are all drunk about their hatred towards each other in school. It is quite funny, most of the time.”
“Well,” she says, and then gestures at his entire person. “You come in here looking like you’d rather be anywhere else, and then you
Surely Draco will look at it and say: “oh, an old family ring. I wonder how that got there.” Surely, not all of his decorum has disappeared, and he will laugh this off.
Their friends have spewed across Grimmauld, doing their part to have the evening run smoothly. Pansy is making out with her long-term Bulgarian girlfriend on Harry and Draco’s bed a whole floor above. The more things change, etcetera.
She smiles. “Wonderful.” Then she seems to run her eyes over Harry’s clothes and his unruly hair, still slightly wet at the ends. “What’re you looking for?”
Harry glares in mock annoyance. He takes the piece of paper out of her hands – it has what must be her writing. Large, bubbly numbers and letters, in an order that has no meaning to him.
In the attic were the portraits that were too risky to leave out for a party with muggle attendees, no matter how high those muggle attendees had risen. He had to carry each one out individually, either the frames being unresponsive to any charms, or the occupants being too sensitive, and causing tantrums from a slight
Harry pauses. The man looks horrified that he’s lost – something. “What?” He’s kinder with his words this time, at risk of escalating the horror.
Is there supposed to be some grand conclusion for doing this? He doesn’t know. He wants to know. He thinks that at least he knows what he doesn’t like, but then there are around 400 rings in display cabinets through the shop, and they all seem like a last-minute decision to prove a point.
,” he says sarcastically, “that I reacted strongly to it after our discussion last night where you basically told me you didn’t want to marry me because you were
Harry thinks he’s going to cry. Maybe throw up; better to put it to good use and join whatever stupid competition is happening on the balcony. He hates being 23.
She sighs out thankfully, and Harry half expects her to wipe her brow comically. He’s horrified. He shouldn’t be allowed out in public by himself.
They sit on the spare bed, legs splayed out like they own the place, and listen to the sounds of the invitees get plastered. Harry is able to subtly vanish the enchanted feather boa in the quiet of the noise, and Draco - indulgently - let's him. Draco hums a little, in thought. “Why
“What’s the point, then?” Harry asks, coming to stand over where Draco is stretched out across the bare mattress.
Ron rolls his eyes. He looks sweaty, more so than is probably normal for a pumping house party, and Harry’s certain that Ron wasn’t even drinking tonight.
"Come on, get up. Just because theres no one here now doesnt mean someone wont turn up and see you debasing yourself on the street."
Draco continues. “I thought we came to some conclusion last night. Then your stupid little crow brain latched onto the shiny ring and
Blaise looks pensive for a second, and then turns to face Harry a little easier. “I think you two should do the honourable thing and tell us if you ever have plans to do such spontaneity. I expect I will not want to go through the same drinking without warning, thank you very much.”
The joggers land on the ground from where Draco didn’t catch them – too busy squeezing his face into the t-shirt in his hands.
Harry feels a sob crest through the body in his arms. A couple. But not too many, because suddenly Draco is wrenching himself from Harry’s comfortable grip, and has sat himself astride Harry’s hips, hands on his cheeks now, staring right into his eyes.
Hermione’s still holding court in the living room, surrounded by her course mates and their own friends from Hogwarts. Without Harry noticing it’s as if all of the most important people have gravitated into this sitting room. It’s bursting at the seams.
“Is anyone even still here?” Harry asks. Draco has walked over and dropped his head back on Harry’s shoulder, wrapped an arm around his waist.
“Hermione! Ronald!” the little letter spins around a little, and then seems to find the right direction, facing the happy couple. “Rolf and I are so happy to hear about your news! We’ve sent a bouquet to Hermione’s, and a little something extra. We’re in Siberia at the moment, so I’m sure you can guess as to what it could be.” Her voice sounds very suggestive, but both Hermione and Ron just look confused and horrified as to what it could possibly be.
“No.” Draco grabs Harry’s shoulder and makes him turn around so they face each other. “No, what it is, is some crap left over from centuries of terrible Black marriages. Why put stake in that?” He’s staring at Harry beseechingly.
He closes the door on his way out, not even a slam, and walks right out of the cast-iron gate and down the grey street.
Ginny says “can’t wait for your three divorce parties,” which gets a mean laugh out of Draco, and a grumpy look from Ron.
“I’m disappointed in you, Mr. Potter.” The auror looks at Harry like Harry is her underling or something, and Draco loudly coughs, glaring, drawing her attention back to him. Harry would get angry, if he didn’t expect her to completely shut down the whole party at any more ‘subordination’.
Harry winces. Thankfully, Paul just says “Jeremy, you’re a fuckin’ tosser. You need to quit the coke, you mad fucker.”
"He doesn't," Draco counters, rising up on his knees. "What he does have is the strange Potter-nurtured ability to turn up when is most inconvenient!"
“And it’s still true! You want to get married because four years ago we said that would be the earliest we’d get engaged? Why are we rushing into it!”
Harry releases Draco’s lips softly, slowly. Takes a second to look at closed eyes and fanned, light, eyelashes, with that little line right in between the eyebrows – a wrinkle in his skin. Before Draco can open those eyes, Harry leans in and pecks his lips again; they’re too shiny. Too red. Too present for him to ignore.
,” Draco starts, slinking around to Harry’s front, “would be more fun if you’d just have a little tipple!”
They’re both sober, are Hermione and Ron, so that’s why it’s not surprising when suddenly Hermione quietly slaps a hand to her mouth, eyes bulging up at Ron. Ron looks at her, unable to keep in a grin, and nods.
Harry has an elbow resting on a pillow to his right and he uses the tips of his fingers to gently move Draco’s curled fringe out of his eyes. Draco’s fingers are playing with the soft hairs at Harry’s neck, carding slightly through the hair there as much as he can without getting caught in tangles.
Draco scoffs, and a leg flings out and hit Harry’s shin. Harry kicks back and ignores Draco’s prompt to involve himself. “That’s basically the
Thank Merlin he has his wallet, tucked within his coat pocket, bank card and a good pinch of Muggle bank notes stuffed in. At least he can hail a taxi at the end of all this to make it to the pub. But there’s not a hell of a lot he can think to do right now before that point.
Neville, apparently, has no qualms. There’s a smile in his voice when he affirms “yep! Niamh. From Legal Method.” Harry hears Ginny snort.
Harry shuts his eyes and breathes once or twice. Draco lands his lips gently on his face, navigating the glasses just so, and then Harry can’t say no. Because he definitely loves this man an awful lot, and will definitely attend a pub event where his two closest friends are celebrating getting married, and the rest of the bunch are going to stare daggers at Harry and/or Draco the entire night if they don’t bring the correct amount of cheer.
Draco hums and seems content for the moment to let Harry sift too-hard, drunk fingers across his sensitive scalp. He’s barely grimacing; very indulgent. “Lovegood, great show this year with the entertainment.”
The conversation is easy, these two so comfortable in their skin that they move with efficiency. With ease.
Is that his heart breaking in half in his chest? Or is it all of the evening’s emotions finally catching up to him? Is he even breathing? Who fucking cares?
“Well,” Luna starts. “Daddy hasn’t been all that well, recently.” She ruffles through a mass of loose paper, all letters. “He sent us some weird correspondence,” she grabs up a piece of parchment, “and it seemed so out of character that almost immediately we started preparing our goodbyes.”
There’s not a single other word exchanged, but then they’re kissing, Ron’s arms tight around her waist as she leans her whole body against his kneeling figure. People start screaming.
The door to the right floor is also covered in some interesting looking paintings: a bird with horns protruding at the skull greats Harry with a small wave of its wings; a drawing of a beetle skuttles across the handle, and Harry has to prod at it a bit to get it moving.
“Fuck.” Harry mutters when Draco drops his forehead to his shoulder; their hips are very far apart now, every thought of sex fluttering out the door behind a couple of the jumpier guests who are running to the back garden.
. Harry’s actually cooing into Draco’s hair, where it curls up against his lips, words with no meaning but that are unbearable to stop right into the white blonde, interchanging with small, delicate kisses right into waves.
Harry’s eyebrows shoot up. “They’re moving… back home?” He’s… kind of ecstatic about that, actually. Draco nods, smiles a little, and then the two are moving into the hall and following where Luna has gone.
know.” Draco is mumbling. Harry’s heart skips a beat for a second, and then starts racing. His palms are starting to sweat.
Harry hears “sir,” and looks up from the cabinet. “Would it help to think about what you’d want? In a ring?”
(Blaise) “Hermione, I’m serious. This house is about 500 years old, I seriously doubt they’ll be happy when it falls to pieces because you couldn’t keep your wand out of it!”
Harry tidies his plate as the rest of them talk and plan. Sounds of eating and scraping at plates continue under the noise of conversation. Ron groans “bloody good, Harry.” He leans back in his chair and out his torso presses – just enough for his stomach to make a loud hollow noise when he slaps at it.
Harry whimpers. And then he can’t take it anymore and stumbles through to the bathroom, grabbing onto the chest of drawers and the clothes chair as he goes. He stumbles blindly into the open closet door – “
Turning around he sees the shop-keep staring at him challengingly, holding out a piece of paper with writing.
“No, nothing,” Harry says, shaking his head. “I said the same thing to Ron last night before he did it.”
The box and the ring are tight in one of his hands, but she suddenly leans back to grab at it, rip the ring out of the box and forces it into Ron’s hand. “Sorry, sorry. Yes. Hermione.” Their faces are close together, and neither can stop themselves from grinning. Hermione’s talking, but it’s impossible to make out over the noise of the room. “Hermione, will you marry me.” Thank Merlin Ron’s
And then Draco says: “fucking fuck shit hell bollocks.” He has, apparently, decided to rummage through the potion cabinet looking for something - whilst in an emergency.
It’s not hard. Grimmauld, thankfully, now that time has passed and the halls of the house have decided that Harry and Draco are good owners and deserving of respect, refuses to allow stains on the carpets or scuffs to the walls. But, a house can only do so much, so Harry walks through the house vanishing bottles that were missed, and streamers from someone or other. Remnants of a cake Harry hadn’t even realised had been present seem to have been splattered over a couple of walls in one of the upper-floor living rooms, but that’s gone with an easy charm too. The whole house seems to have been a little frustrated being coated in the sediment of the party, and it breathes easier once the trash and the miscellaneous goop has been cleaned off.
Harry tries to school his face to make it look like he’s not incredibly interested, but he doesn’t know how to. “Right.”
Draco gets up eventually, with Harry's hand in his own helping him. They walk into Harry's shop, and they settle down so that Draco can write a few letters of greeting to his loved ones. Hes sure that within the hour the stacks of cups and saucers and clocks and trinkets and
, but by God right at this point Harry thinks he can taste it all, their future, their tentative little chance at the future right on the tips of their tongues, right where he’s wrapping his around Draco’s, right where Draco’s is pushing further and further into Harry’s.
Down the hall, across an intricately designed and woven carpet complete with moving figurines – some of which represent their teachers – the two of them walk through another doorway and to the dining room that definitely turned out to be more of a study.
, and a wide-eyed look on his face when he stares at Harry. Harry moves. The two of them wander up then down the hall, and they sit once they reach that back step.
Draco murmurs “Harry…” and leans down to place a chaste kiss at Harry’s lips, before pulling back and repeating. “How long?”
Hermione forgets about Harry when she sees Draco and she leans forward to ruffle his admittedly fluffy looking hair from its Luna-adjacent position. Draco looks up and sends her a sweet smile.
Harry opens his mouth, but Draco leans in gently for a hot second of a press. He pulls back. “Why is it
Harry swallows. Looks back at the piece of paper he’s got grasped between his thumb and forefinger. Thinks about the brushed metal and the vine etchings. Thinks of the ivy that grows up the front of Grimmauld in Spring, the same stuff that’s just starting to show some yellowing as Autumn comes upon London.
Hermione’s face twists up in further apology, but Harry just shrugs and walks into the kitchen proper.
Harry groans and swings away from the table, from Draco’s comforting hands. He runs his hands through his unruly hair. Tries to get himself back on track. “I
it…” he seems to consider that. “Well, that’s a lie.” He looks at Harry dead on. “I did try to hide it. It’s an heirloom. My grandmother’s old ring.”
“Potion.” They both say in synchronisation, and stumble up awkwardly to the shelf over the sink. They grab a candy red bottle each and down them with gazes locked.
By the time the two leave, with a wave from the younger Auror to… one of his mates down the back… almost half of the party has gone. The Elven wine and the fire-whisky, whatever Bulgarian vodka that Pansy’s girlfriend bought with her, and the rest of the drink across the house is rounded up and quickly vanished under Harry’s watchful eyes. He has to grab a couple of glasses directly out of the hands of some people.
representatives from the Muggle and Magical Cooperation Department, and that they’ve been keeping any magical objects glamoured. They grab a few of Hermione’s mates, ask them a couple of questions about what’s been happening in the house – “I’ve never smoked weed in my
, is what he’s also thinking. But every time it smacks into his mind, he has to shake his head and remember the stupid
The train has just closed its doors on another station when another movement churns his gut in an upset, and he stands and grabs a hold of a pole, ready to hop off as soon as possible. The young guy a couple of seats down from where Harry stands looks appealingly at Harry, and Harry sends him a polite and uninterested smile back, his stomach starting to feel worse.
Harry looks away, removes a hand from Draco’s waist to rub at his eyes. “Yeah, I guess. We were going there anyway, it felt. I don’t know. Right?”
It’s after he’s washed off the remaining detritus from the evening that wasn’t covered by the hangover potion, and especially the lingering smells of the fry-up, that he takes a good look at himself in the mirror, and then is immediately distracted by the potion’s cabinet.
“You had said you’d come straight to mine. Couldn’t think of anywhere else to go.” He smiles down at the box, and opens it. Understated, gold. “That’s me. I can’t think of anywhere else to go, but straight to you.”
Harry’s fed up. He grabs a large hand around Draco’s slender neck and pulls the mans face down and kisses him.
from behind him, but he grabs his coat hanging over the hook in the open closet door, and storms out of the bedroom, down the stairs.
Ron hums in agreement. Harry is pretty sure that Ron just likes showing that he knows a lot about Hermione’s life to everyone else. He can’t help the smile that tugs at his lips, so he just looks back to the hob instead of having Hermione look at him weird.
” Harry mocks, and Draco just tightens that soft and tender grip around his leg until Harry cries Uncle.
Draco’s eyes are still closed, and his arms are still crossed, but he kisses back like he’s mad for it. The warmth of both of their faces and their breath and the wet of their lips and their mouths and then Draco’s wrenches their mouths open and then that’s
Draco stares hard. “After today? I won’t hear the end of it all evening if you don’t come. I can sense an interrogation on the horizon, and the imbeciles will just be terrible if you don’t join me.” Harry is still sitting, but Draco comes closer, knee pressing gently against Harry’s arm. Draco leans over a little and shrouds Harry in his body. “It won’t be long. We’ll stay for a couple of hours, just until they get their mothering off their chest.”
The bacon is crisping up nicely, red and blistered, so Harry summons some bread to toast quickly, before stowing it behind his ear for the final hurdles. Draco had resumed setting out coffee for new guests after his verbal altercation with Pansy and the kitchen is now bustling with noise and conversation, plates and cutlery pulled from cupboards and drawers to knock with hollow thuds against the wood.
At one point when almost everyone has scraped their plates clean and are on their second and third and fourth cups of a seemingly never-ending supply, Della stands up to help clear the plates and the cutlery (the great initiative of a muggleborn), to which Niamh straightens up fast to help. It’s when Ron is handing over a stack of plates from his end of the table that Niamh suddenly shouts “oh!”
Harry and Draco are both 34 year old men who have been very content for the last 10 years to just accept whatever is happening. The last owl flies off announcing Draco's return to the surface, and then Harry is pushing off from his chair and announcing that if Draco really is going to be sticking around, he better make himself useful. Draco counters by saying that his nose has only just been broken, and he can feel the remnants of his panic attack in the depths of his bones. Harry laughs loudly, and Teddy seems to snort -
A sweep of fingers across a sensitive part of Harry’s neck has him sighing softly and closing his eyes as a shiver wrests itself down his spine.
So he can't see the proprietor. He can't see whether theres anyone else inside. Shit. He wants to turn back, give up. Take the bag hanging at his side and toss it into the Thames right fucking now.
He hurries off the train, tags off at the turnstiles when he can, and rushes up the steps and to street-level, navigating his way through the throngs of the inner London crowd.
Luna smiles gently. “Well, if Daddy were to pass on, then I’m sure you’d come out on top of that bet Draco.”
. It’s when you start snogging at the stove, and then your boyfriend getting nuts over a ring that alarm bells start to go off.”
He moves to walk away, and then stops himself. “Oh. Um. If this goes well, there’s a bunch of Elven wine I hid in Kreacher’s old cubby. Could you…?”
"I've seen the error of my ways. Truly. Your godson all but pushed my head into your dirty glass windows and broke my nose. It's almost poetic, really."
familiar, when suddenly the door is swung open and there’s Draco, glaring right down at Harry. His mouth drops open.
, no. No! I meant.” He hangs his head over the ring with a groan. “I meant, like, reverse psychology.”
Harry opens his eyes, looks at the stairs leading up away from the kitchen and can’t believe this. He turns in his spot – looks at Draco straight in the eye. “Are you serious?”
“Yes,” is another simultaneous reply. Draco grabs Harry’s hand hard. They’re not looking at each other, both trained right on Ron, but Harry squeezes back tightly.
Draco grins a little bit, moving his eyes across Harry’s face. Harry’s right hand is now cupping Draco’s cheek, and he brings the left up to do the same on the other side, resting Draco’s face right between his palms. Harry feels his heart go a bit nuts in his chest, which is quite stupid, considering the long years he’s spent following this man. It must be the moment, the tentative energy that’s spiralling through his body.
Why is it this that’s testing them? Because it’s this about their lives they’re unable to pretend they agree on. Harry opens his mouth.
He realises as he’s walking that he didn’t put all of that washing on he’d sent to the laundry. He groans, and gets a look from a woman sat opposite him on the Tube, which he ignores.
Luna continues. “Sending you both all of our love; we can’t wait to celebrate. We’ll be back later this evening just in time to meet you all at the pub, but we just couldn’t wait to send this through!” and with that, the howler violently rips itself into pieces with a puff of smoke.
Harry grimaces again. “Well. I guess I wasn’t really thinking about it until the trip was cancelled. Then I realised that was exactly when and where I wanted to do it.”
“Yes, quite. I’ll be joining you with that one.” Draco straightens up, a click in his bones, and groans in a stretch. “Come on, darling. Let’s get this over with.”
Harry must be a little hysteric now with how close the laughter is to the surface. He lets it bubble over a little again.
He's hyperventilating. He can't believe he's actually standing in front of this stupid store with a bag filled with. Curios. And he's actually hyperventilating.
A voice cuts through the gentle hum on the room, and forces Draco’s wide open again. Pansy. “What the fuck are you two doing?”
Harry’s flipping over the eggs in the pan and tuning out the conversation behind him when a hand lands firm at the bottom of his back. Draco sets a coffee down next to Harry, and places a little kiss right on Harry’s cheek, to which Harry blushes and survives fumbling the handle of the spatula. Just. Draco kisses him again, corner of his mouth this time.
