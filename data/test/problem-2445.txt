"Malfoy..." Potter softly pressed his fingers to Draco’s spine, and Draco jolted toward the door as if he had just been burned by an Incendio spell. Something about all of this felt far too vulnerable. Being touched--especially being touched by Harry Potter--he didn’t trust it. He didn’t trust it at all. He threw open the closet door, squinted against the light, and stormed down the hall.
? I don’t want to, and I don’t think
Spending too much time in one place made him nervous anyway.
. He never thought he would so greatly prefer Granger’s presence to Potter’s. To be eager to see her, even. Well, then again, look who he had to deal with
“If this is Hagrid’s work, it’s likely warded and covered in disillusionment spells. Unless someone happens to fall in too, I don’t think they’ll even realize we’re here.”
Potter’s hand wrapped around Draco's wrist over his robes, holding him in place. Quietly, so quietly that Draco wasn’t entirely sure Potter had said anything at all, Potter whispered, “I don’t hate you, if that’s what you think.”
“Bye Ferret,” Weasley said absently, not looking up from his parchment.
. Granger's words:
us. Enemies turned lovers. Their love as a magical healing light." Draco tapped his chin thoughtfully. "Somehow they must have been able to harness it and bottle it as a healing potion.”
“ThankyouOUT!” Draco yelled. The door slammed shut.
“Seven o’clock. The faculty are meeting several minutes early to parade in as part of the opening ceremony. Meet us by the gargoyle?”
Harry swallowed. “Are you catching another portkey?”
"No!" Potter said in a rush. "Er. I mean. You look great. It's just..." He cleared his throat awkwardly. “How did it go?”
mercy, hmm? I've read about this mind-blowing thing you can do with magic during sex that may or may not be illegal in several countries."
, and he was being ridiculous. He took a deep breath, straightened his shoulders, and sat down, fanning out his cloth serviette with a forceful flick of his wrists and smoothing it over his lap. He sat upright in his chair, the perfect image of pureblood etiquette, and didn’t look at Potter for the rest of the meal.
“You wait for the beat, and step here. And here. And here,” Draco said, his voice cold and distant and tactical. Avoid and deflect, that was the goal here.
with Harry Potter. Hopelessly, terrifyingly in love--like he had loved no one else before or since. Harry was as much a part of Draco as his own beating heart, and he feared that if Harry was ever ripped from his life, he would lose a core part of himself.
Potter looked down at his feet, shoving his hands into his pockets. “Silk
It was time to take his father’s place. It was time to reintroduce the Malfoy name into high society.
Merlin, it was actually working. Four Death Eaters were moving in the direction of the hallway, and the other four were moving in the direction of the Throne Room. Draco saw Longbottom and his partner begin to move in behind the group that was seeking the Minister, and the other four were bound to run into some Aurors by the time they reached the Throne Room. That left three.
“Potter,” Draco nipped again, sucking Harry’s earlobe into his mouth and delighting at the throaty sounds he made. “There’s
Harry made a soft noise, a little high-pitched and in the back of his throat. “Draco,” he whimpered again.

“This is going to require a lot of Bertie Botts."
"He'll cool off, just give him some time," Weasley patted Draco firmly on the shoulder before letting go. "Ever since Ginny, he gets a little oversensitive when it comes to the thought of losing anyone else. We're
Or rather, it was right, because if Weasley
Harry was still halfway across the fucking room, hadn’t even touched him yet, and was stripping Draco’s clothing off. Of course. Wasn’t that typical Potter? He'd had been struggling to cast a basic Patronus earlier that night, and yet throw him into the heat of things and he could wandlessly strip a person from across a room. Draco was instantly hard, and then Harry’s mouth was crashing into his, Harry’s hands were in his hair, ripping the ribbon out and letting his hair free, coiling it up in his fingers and pressing it tight to the back of Draco’s head.
Draco fell completely still and felt his cock softening as he flushed from head to toe. The last thing he needed was for Harry to catch him
? Goodness, I’ve never heard of such a thing. A potion shouldn’t be able to affect anyone but the person consuming it, with the rare exception of love potions and the like. But even so, they certainly don’t utilize this kind of magic. Or...so I thought.” Granger blinked confoundedly at the door in the ceiling, and then brightened. “It
“I agree. Now give me back my bed.”
“When I opened my wardrobe I was thinking about all of the things I had to accomplish today. What were you thinking about, Harry? When you fell in here?”
Potter just kept right on going. “I disliked you, yes, because you were a complete arse—” Draco began to push open the closet door. “but that was years ago, and I’m--” Potter pulled him back, groaning in frustration, “What I
“I think I can make my dad’s Sleeping Draught a little stronger if I only use the dried lavender flowers instead of the whole sprig.”
“What?” Potter stepped back.
“It’s perfect,” Potter said, turning his head to watch it so that his cheek was pressed against into Draco’s shoulder.
“Have I ever?” Potter skipped ahead to keep up the pace.
Draco groaned, weaving his fingers into Harry's hair.
“Is there anything you need me to do first?”
“Allow me to show you to your office,” Granger said, waving him down the stairs after her.
Draco simply held up a hand and walked over to James’ bed. James was awake, trying to persuade a healer to move him to a different bed so that the early morning sunlight wasn’t pouring into his sleepy eyes. “Professor Malfoy!” he exclaimed, wriggling upright. Draco felt some of his bitterness easing away. He couldn't
explored the dungeons, quite thoroughly in fact, and had found nothing promising.
Potter himself had been completely ignoring him since the incident in the closet, and luckily no gossip had spread around the school. If they passed each other in the halls, Potter didn’t even make the effort to give him a wary glance anymore. He just kept walking, refusing to even acknowledge Draco’s presence. In their faculty meeting, Potter had ignored him until they were obligated to team up together to brainstorm new classroom layouts for the following term. Potter had conversed with him minimally, only for the purpose of the exercise, and then went back to completely ignoring him. Draco found that he didn’t like it at all. He far preferred the first couple of weeks, during which Potter had at least bothered to engage in playful banter or lecture him. Now it was as if Draco didn’t exist. Potter was determined to give him the silent treatment. Like a child. No, this was far worse than when they were children. Draco didn’t like it at all.
Draco pressed his thumb to Potter’s lips. Merlin, the feeling of Potter’s

to that?" Draco repeated a little more forcefully.
“Shut it, Malfoy, let me have this! It was hot as hell!”
Thus, Draco purposely arranged his schedule to interact with Cornelius as little as possible. Draco would wake up before dawn just so he could mull about the caravan’s kitchen in solitude before marching into the forest alone to collect specimens. He would come back long after Cornelius had gone to sleep or, if Draco was feeling particularly exhausted, he would slip back to the caravan when Cornelius was at the research base in the evenings.

Nononono.
“Yes?” Harry was running his tongue along the valleys between his knuckles.

Draco smiled into his neck. Potter looked down and over his shoulder until he saw Draco holding him, then relaxed a little. Harry eased back into Draco's arms, his hands still on Draco’s knees, his shirt bunched down around his wrists. They sat like that for a long time, not saying anything as the hot shower water fell around them.  Draco began drifting to sleep.
The scars of Potter’s Sectumsempra were still there, of course--three pale, puckered lines like a long, disconnected backward Z from the spell that had brutally sliced Draco open. The first line slanted from the ball of his left shoulder across the span of his chest. The second, at a sharper angle, began near his right armpit, crossed through the first scar and spanned down to his lower left ribs. The third, separate from the other two, began an inch to the right of his naval and curved around to his side and into the top of his pelvis. Potter gingerly lifted a hand and pressed his fingers to the thick puckered edge of the first scar at his shoulder. “Draco,” he whispered, his voice all pity and regret. Draco rolled his eyes and tried to squirm away again, but Potter pushed him forcefully back against the wall and straddled him, sitting his weight on Draco’s legs so that Draco was now the one pressed between

” James said, pushing Potter further into the doorway.
Potter looked at Draco’s mouth incredulously and stepped closer, his hands coming to either side of Draco’s collar and gripping it tight. “Potter,” Draco warned, pressing his hands to Potter’s ribs as he tried pushing him away, clinging to his last vestiges of sanity. "If you--" But Potter was pulling Draco down to his height, pressing their mouths together more firmly. Draco's stomach flew into his throat. “Mmm,” Draco groaned hopelessly against Potter's lips, instantly forgetting whatever logical thing he had been about to say as his arms slid from Potter’s ribs to wrap around his back, pressing their chests tightly together.
Draco opened his eyes and held Harry tighter.
He thought of his father in the drawing room, sipping brandy with his legs tightly crossed, opening a hand to Draco and smiling as he came into the room, fresh out of school from his first year at Hogwarts. “Expecto patronum,” he repeated, jabbing his wand into the air. Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
It wasn’t like there was anything keeping him at Hogwarts anyway.

Now Draco was wondering if Potion Four had somehow leaked onto his clothes or fingers that night at the pub and made its way into his system; it was far more rational than believing that he and Potter had some sort of golden magical connection, yet

Draco dared a glance over his shoulder and was relieved to find that Weasley, Granger, and Potter were nowhere to be seen.

Harry wore a traditional Muggle black tuxedo with a starched white shirt underneath. Instead of a waistcoat, he wore a scarlet sash and crisp bow tie--not a bright, clownish scarlet, but a much richer, deeper colour. And over that, he wore a matching scarlet satin robe that exquisitely captured the light and shadow of the room as it rolled around him; the robe was perfectly fitted at Harry's arms and shoulders, yet the remaining floorlength fabric billowed so openly behind him as he walked that it was more reminiscent of a lightweight cloak or cape. Harry’s dark hair was slicked back and slightly to the side, and by some miracle it was actually
, Harry pulled completely out.
“Well...er...yes, but I...um…” Draco had been leaning back in his chair far enough to see that Harry’s knees began banging together uneasily beneath the table. Harry's feet were squirming back and forth as he nervously ran his palms up and down his thighs. He was clearly uncomfortbale, and had no desire to talk about the Elder Wand.
“I was so angry,” Harry whispered, pressing his thumb against the skull of his Mark. “When you let him do this to you.”
Was Potter purposely avoiding him?

Draco nodded, resisting an angry urge to swipe all of the test vials off of the table and let them smash to the floor.
“Looking good, Potter,” Draco drawled, eyeing Potter from head to toe. “Evening, Weasel.”
The torches and floating candles in the ballroom were suddenly extinguished; the magical stars in the ceiling blinked out, leaving the room in absolute darkness.
“Honestly, I don’t really want to talk about it.”

“Now wait just a blimey minute! First: you should have two fingers out because those are scissors, but nevermind. Second: rock beats scissors. I win.”

Draco lifted a finger to pull the dark hair out of Harry’s eyes before he remembered that it wouldn't do any good. He wished he could console this younger version of Harry. He wished he could tell Harry that, despite everything that was ahead and all of the people he would lose, he would be okay. It would never be easy, but it would be okay. He wanted to tell this Harry that Draco wouldn’t always be young and stupid and cruel. Someday, Draco would be there to hold him, and they would… they would what? Be together? They weren’t together. Draco had left, even though Harry had asked him to stay.
“What did you tell him, Potter?” Draco was tempted to cast a silent Lumos, just so he could read Potter’s face.
“I guess I was thinking that when I got back to my room I should probably cast a silencing charm on my snoring roommate.”
“Firewhiskey!” Weasley exclaimed as the bartender slid three shots across the bar. Weasley pushed one down to Draco and set one in front of Potter. “Cheers, mates.”

Eventually he got up, crossed the room, and opened the door, not even bothering to button up his shirt. Instantly, two female professors who had been walking by turned and looked at him. They walked toward him clumsily, and then leaned forward. Each one planted a kiss on his cheeks. There was no golden light from their touches, no sparks exploding through his core. They continued walking down the hall again, as if nothing had happened. Then a male professor did the same, kissing his forehead this time. There was nothing golden or magical about it. An owl flew by with mail in its beak and, thankfully, didn’t give Draco a second glance.
at one corner--into the tiniest little arrogant smirk. And Draco felt his breath hitch. Why was that so fucking sexy? Usually he hated that smirk. It was abhorrent. It drove him crazy.
“Did she just come on to you, Harry?” Ron asked.
Then, with his mouth against Harry’s hair, an arm nestled around Harry’s back, and the water still running, Draco drifted to sleep.
! Bartender!” Ron yelled. “Can we get three shots of firewhiskey please?”
When Draco turned, he saw two old friends standing behind him arm in arm. It was such a welcome sight that he wanted to

Draco sat on the floor, took a deep breath, and allowed three clear drops to fall onto his tongue. He waited a few silent minutes for something to take effect.
Draco abruptly sat upright. “Potter, please say you did
Potter just shook his head as if Draco were a complete idiot.
It was a crisp September morning at Hogwarts, and Draco was sitting upright beneath his silk sheets, still naked. The Fountain of Vermouth was trickling by his transfigured desk and sunlight was pouring through his window. Draco absently pulled his lower lip between his fingers as he ran his eyes over the photographs sprawled over the emerald sheets around him. The photographs depicted walls and hieroglyphs from the Tomb of Hannu. He

Granger stayed with Draco for a few more hours, until she was certain that he had stabilized. Once he was actually capable of speaking, he reviewed his exact symptoms with her. They concluded that it was probably some kind of fossilization or mummification potion, probably used as a preservation spray and not intended for human consumption. Granger completed Draco's research notes before she left, giving him explicit instructions to wake her in case of an emergency.
He'd spent fifteen years running from the past, and now he was stuck in it. Bloody fantastic.
me, and you are making it nearly impossible.” Potter heaved a sigh. “But I’ve never hated you, Draco.”
He had been running ever since.
Nothing happened.
Draco had been in the middle of the forest one morning, crouched low and peacefully scraping frosted flora from the dirt floor in order to test its similarities to an ancient specimen of dried Frost Root, when a new and terrifying thought suddenly slammed into his brain. His thoughts often wandered while out doing fieldwork; there was always lots of contemplating and soul searching, that much was normal. But this particular thought? This was something else entirely. He had been reflecting on his feelings toward Cornelius, trying to make sense of the attraction, the anger, the insults. And, to his horror, it dawned on him that he had always felt that way about Harry Potter. Multiplied by one hundred.
Potter would come and foil his plans, just like always. Why was he even surprised?
"Are you--" Harry gasped. "I'm--"

Witches and wizards had been whispering about a Fountain of Youth for hundreds of years. It wasn’t some mythological fountain like existed in Muggle folklore. No, it was real. It

The plan had been made before his heart had wrapped itself fully and completely around one man.
“You certainly can. But if you do, be sure to add extra lavender flowers roughly equivalent to the mass of what you are losing in stems and leaves. If you don’t try to compensate for the difference, the Flobberworm Mucus won’t react properly, resulting in a weaker Draught.”
“If you believed him to be dead, it means you are not yet worthy of knowing he’s alive.” Draco pressed his wand to his Dark Mark, casting a silent ancient illusion spell. It had been very convenient for turning lifeless magical hieroglyphs and cave paintings into a moving Wizarding story, but he had never actually tried it on

“Er...this… this isn’t for a test or anything, is it, Professor?” Albus asked nervously.
Draco glanced behind Potter to see Lily and James, small and distant, hovering at the far end of the pitch. Hadn’t he wanted to be a part of that joy, only moments ago? And then his eyes dropped to the bright patch of red hair on the green. “I won’t have Weasley ordering me around,” Draco said defiantly, and even
“Yes,” Draco drawled. “The thing about

For what you did at the Manor.”
Granger patted him on the arm and sighed. “I really thought we had it. You were so close.”
Harry pulled Draco from the crowd until they were walking onto the dance floor together, hand in hand. There were several gasps from the crowd, which only made Draco grin wider as Harry led him to the center of the dance floor.
Then James spoke.
Draco woke up choking on shower water. He sat up, gasping and coughing as he looked around the cubicle. Harry was gone. Harry’s clothes were gone. Draco’s skin was a wet, puckered mess, and he had apparently depleted the shower water’s heating charm because he was

proving a point. He had a theory and he was proving it. Luckily, Cornelius didn’t seem to mind. A few minutes later, flushed and feeling rather drunk as Draco returned to the forest, he realized that he still had dirt on his palms.
Harry looked up at him, his eyes going a little wide. “I miss you,” he blurted on a breath.
“Fine. Laugh. That’s what you always do in the face of sincerity, isn’t it? Turn cynical. Make it into a joke. Avoid it altogether.” Potter bristled and backed against the opposite side of the pit. He leaned against the wall, digging his fingers into the dirt as if it could restrain him from marching forward and punching Draco into the ground.

Draco needed air. Immediately. “Well, that’s nice, Potter, but I’ve despised you my entire life.” Because what could this sickly feeling in his gut possibly be, if not hatred? He knew exactly what else it could be, and he refused (refused!) to consider it. He wrenched his wrist free of Potter’s grip and forced the closet door open. A student walking by the door shrieked and stared at him in alarm. Wonderful. That was just what he needed. Students gossiping about Draco Malfoy, former Death Eater, jumping out of closets at unsuspecting first-years. At least that was better than--no, no,
He had a portkey to catch.

“What time did you say dinner was?”

that his mouth had opened, but it was enough. The drops slid into his mouth and onto his tongue. Draco tried to swallow, but his tongue wouldn’t work.
and now he was completely losing his nerve. "That I might try staying around for a while, if that's alright with you. Rebuild the Malfoy name the old-fashioned way. You know...lots of fancy dress parties, political intrigue, that sort of thing. Or maybe I’ll stay at Hogwarts for another year.” He smiled, and then frowned. “No, that’s not what I was going to say. I mean, I was going to say it, but there's...” Draco sighed defeatedly. There was no avoiding it now. “I was going to say that I--” Draco took a deep breath. “I love you." Draco nearly swallowed his tongue. He could say this. "I

together, that they could even share the same wand."
Draco decided it may be best to listen to this voice before he could change his mind. He abruptly turned around and ran into his room, but in his haste he didn’t put enough force behind it, and the door banged back open instead of latching. Potter was walking right into his room behind him. “Did you take another potion? Are you sure you’re alright?”
Perfect.

“Obviously.” Bloody hell, what
There was an abrupt knock on the door and Draco fell away, cheeks flushed and breathing hard. Harry cleared his throat and opened the door. Draco crossed the room and began pacing by the window, his black robes still clinging tightly to him, hanging in pieces at his left arm.
Granger stood and gave the welcoming speech. The students were in complete awe of her, and even Draco had to concede that she held herself with enough grace and poise to seem superhuman. Ron Weasley sat at her right side. Judging by the way that Weasley, who was apparently the Quidditch coach--nevermind the nepotism there--beamed at Granger, Draco guessed that they were still happily married. A flash of their wedding bands in the candlelight confirmed it. Clearly Weasley was not as content with Draco’s presence as Granger was, if his furrowed orange eyebrows were any indication. Weasley had already attempted to murder Draco with his eyes several times, and dinner hadn’t even appeared yet. Weasley leaned forward to look disgustedly down the table at Malfoy for the upteenth time, as if he couldn’t even believe what he was seeing was real.
The wands flew from both Death Eaters’ hands as Draco and James cast their spells simultaneously. Draco cast some additional binding and disillusionment spells to nullify the Death Eaters until the Aurors could arrive. “Nice work, James. Have you seen your dad?”
“Maybe if I…” Draco cast his Patronus again, but the dragon regained its golden hue and went scampering back toward the ballroom like an eager puppy. “Well, hell.” Maybe it had something to do with the fact that they had cast two Patronuses simultaneously with the same wand.
Draco nodded so violently that he thought his head might fly off of his neck. Granger was giving him permission to be impatient and irrational! This filled him with glee.
"Brilliant!" Draco gasped. "You're fucking brilliant, alright? Now fuck me already, you egomaniac."
kill you."
There was nothing left for him to do. He had failed. He hadn’t found it. He could go back to the museum, or maybe Carter’s estate, or maybe review the ancient texts again, or keep hunting through Egyptian tombs near Hannu's.

Healer Victoria sat in a small wooden chair by the fireplace with her hands politely folded over one knee. She gave a few judgmental glances toward the fountain of vermouth, still bubbling with full strength on the floor beside her.
Harry blinked.
Potter nearly jumped out of his skin and immediately zipped up his trousers. “Merlin, Malfoy, what the bloody hell are you doing in my wardrobe?”
The dementor turned to Draco, its hollow black face hiding beneath the tattered dark cloak. He could feel its malicious pull on him already. The cold, empty chill. It was so different, Draco realized, from that golden heat consuming him last night. It was the complete opposite, in fact. Draco allowed himself to think of it. He allowed himself to curl the memories of Potter and that golden heat around him, to not deny, but
you can be a creepy fucker when you want to be. One. Two. Three.”
“You should leave, Potter.”
Harry was on the ground in the center of the ballroom. His body was sprawled in an almost unnatural position, and he was squirming and gasping for breath on the floor, barely capable of gurgling his cries of pain. His glasses had been knocked from his face, and his red robes were stretched behind him on the tiled floor.
wanted to say.
“What do you need, Draco?”
And then it happened.
“That’s just brilliant, Potter,” Draco said, gesturing toward the fleeing student and glaring. “Do you have any idea what you just did? Of course not, you complete and utter--” Draco roared in frustration, not even bothering to look at Potter again as he marched toward his quarters to wash up for tea.
But most importantly, it was time to find Harry.
...Oh. Apparently
“They have some fancy teas over here if you want a cuppa.”
“Oi!” Weasley said, busy jotting plays on a piece of parchment. Without even looking up, he threw a golden snitch into the air and kept on writing.

"What if I want you to repeat yourself?" Harry dragged his tongue along Draco's neck.
To his surprise, James Potter was standing on the other side of the door, looking panicked. “You’re a Death Eater. You know Death Eater stuff?”
and his mother had once embraced him
Weaslette, anyway? When was she coming
Draco smirked, reaching for Harry's wrists and pressing them to the mountain of silk pillows above his head. "Scared, Potter?"
“Where is he?” Draco was already slamming his door behind him.
him. He had never felt so elated and terrified in his bloody life. In one swift movement Draco pulled Harry’s mouth to his and rolled Harry onto his back.
Draco still hadn't told him; he hadn't told Harry how he felt, and Harry had to know. He had to.
“Mmm. Where is he?”
But the plan had been made before Harry Potter reentered his life.
. Draco wove his hands through Potter’s dark hair as he pulled him closer. He pushed his tongue into Potter’s mouth and Potter whimpered as their tongues met, clutching his hands around the sides of Draco’s head as though Draco were the only thing keeping him from floating to the ceiling. As their tongues rolled together, Draco could almost see the sparks through his closed eyes, coursing over his tongue and through his blood, throbbing in his cock and back up again. It was in his lungs, in his heartbeat, in every pulsing cell of him. Their mouths grew more frantic, their movement more fierce. Draco was yanking up on Potter’s robes, practically ripping through the endless tangle of fabric until he found the hem of Potter’s t-shirt and slid underneath to press his hand against the skin of Potter’s back. And the heat was
He was such a fucking idiot.
“Would you say...brilliant?” Harry asked teasingly.
In the treasure chest containing Hannu’s jewels for the afterlife, there had also been a vial of the Fountain of Youth. An actual, surviving vial.

The curtain was angled in such a way that Draco could see the left side of Potter’s chest down to the outer slope of his pelvis, shimmering wet. Potter shifted the weight of his hips. Just slightly. But it was enough to draw Malfoy’s attention. As Draco's eyes traced the glimpse he could see of Harry, from the taut curves of his arms down to the curve of his pelvic bone and the edge of his thigh, something in him ached with longing. He was painfully reminded of the
“Er...thanks?” Potter shrugged.
“But the Dark Lord
“Absolutely not.”
Then he clenched his hands into fists, folded them onto the desk in front of him, and allowed his forehead to collapse against the wood.
James violently shook his head. “I can’t believe my dad wants me to be nice to an evil bastard like you.”
Before the war, Draco decided, studying the Potter-Weasel boy as Lily Luna walked over to the Gryffindor table and gave him a high five. Definitely before. Oh, what a scandal. Draco almost regretted not picking up a newspaper to read all about Potter’s teenage lovechild and, most likely, consequent overhasty marriage.

in the morning. He and Potter were
“Well, you’re rubbish then, aren’t you? You could have killed him in the woods. Not even a proper Death Eater.”
He cringed when Rose and Lily suddenly began scream-squealing because Granger, Weasley, and Potter had allowed all of their children to share their own suite, which absolutely thrilled them. Draco couldn't help but smile; their energy was practically contagious.
of all people. He swallowed the bitter taste in his mouth. He wanted to disappear. He wanted to crawl out of this stupid hole, find his wand, go walk through the woods in the rain, and disappear. He wanted to go anywhere.
“Shall I help you back to your bedroom?” Draco stood, his robe cascading down to his knees. Now Potter was staring at Draco’s bare knees. Running his eyes from Draco’s knees, down to his feet, and back again. “Potter?”
He could survive one bloody night with Harry Potter.
“I would be happy to assist you, Mr. Malfoy, sir.”
"Perfect," Harry said, his eyes darting to the fireworks display.
Curiously, Potion Nine had gone completely missing, which left only Potions Seven and Eight.
Draco froze. He had almost forgotten what it was like to be touched, even if it

was the one that you gave me," Draco felt his frustration creeping into his voice. "Apparently you thought that the potions tucked away by the books on the back of my desk took priority over the ones prominently near the front of my desk. Potion Four was tucked away, because in my tests it was exhibiting love-potion-like tendencies.”
her because he could barely move.
“That was...” Potter was panting, his chest rising and falling as he loosely gripped Draco’s legs. When Harry finally caught his breath after a few minutes, he turned around, still a little dazed as he looked into Draco’s face. Harry was drinking him in, and Draco let him. Harry’s eyes traced the lines of his jaw, lingering on his mouth before moving toward the base of his neck, his shoulders, his chest.
“There! You! Go!” James was slapping Potter on the back encouragingly. “Good job, Dad. That wasn’t so hard, was it? Now let’s go eat.” James pulled his father out of the room and then turned back inside to grab the door handle. “See you around, Professor,” he winked and shut the door, leaving Draco to wonder what the hell kind of potion he could have possibly taken to trigger such a thing.
“Salazar’s bollocks, Potter, that is the most hideous thing I have ever seen.”
at those robes!”
Silence again.
And then there was Potter himself. His entire face was flushed crimson as he blinked awkwardly, breathing hot on Draco’s face with atrocious morning breath in his hideous pyjamas. He had crust at the edges of his eyes and hair that defied gravity, and he was undoubtedly the most beautiful thing Draco had ever seen.
Potter. Yet, inevitably, he sometimes thought about how desperately he had wanted Potter to take his hand on the train when they first met. He thought about the way Potter adamantly defended his family at the trials, saying things like, “The Malfoys are innocent, and were simply swept up in events beyond their control.” Or when the prosecutor was questioning Potter about the murder of Albus Dumbledore with sly words, and Potter had interrupted him in a fury, saying, “You’re twisting the question, sir. Draco didn’t do anything wrong, nor was he going to. I know because I was there.” And the way Potter had looked at Draco--right at him--when he added, “Draco has a good heart. If he did anything that night, it was change the course of history and allow me to win the war.” And how it had made something in Draco melt a little.
“Is James...?” Draco swallowed. He couldn’t bring himself to say
Draco pointed to it again. His eyes were getting so dry that his vision was blurring.

Draco swallowed, suddenly feeling very warm. He had somehow managed to start sweating within the span of five seconds. “I’m not the one who ran away, Potter.” His voice was quiet, but he didn’t bother to whisper.
Which meant that he had reached the limits of his testable knowledge.
Oh Merlin, he was in a

but he bit his tongue. He needed to find the Fountain of Youth, and he certainly wouldn’t find it by turning the headmistress of Hogwarts against him. He didn’t give a damn about blood purity, besides. He never really had; he'd just been an idiot. He'd thought it was just something you
of love to him. Draco felt something warm and aching tightening in his chest. Merlin, this was what it felt like. This is what it had always felt like. This was love. Love for his father. Love for his mother. It was so very different from the cold emptiness he felt toward his Aunt Bella. Because, as the dementors had proved to him, that’s what hate really was. It was cold, and it was empty.
Draco scooted his chair out more violently and loudly than he had anticipated, jumping shakily to his feet. “I should get some rest. I have a portkey to catch tomorrow.”
Draco began striding across the ballroom toward the line of Death Eaters, who still hadn't noticed him amidst the chaos. He pressed his wand against his glittering robe and muttered an inking spell that dyed all of the white fabric black. The only colours untouched were the golden embroidery thread and his buttons. He then cast a spell that ripped open the fabric of his robes and shirt from his forearm to his wrist and extended his arm, openly baring his Dark Mark.
Harry slipped into the bathroom without so much as a word.

He served on committee after committee wherever he traveled, abandoning traditional aristocracy for new forms of power and influence. Whenever he made a new discovery, he published his findings in prestigious journals like

much at Potter while he sat across the table from him. He didn’t know what had happened, but something had shifted between them when they had been down in that stupid muddy pit, and Draco wasn’t sure he liked it at all. He found himself studying Potter during faculty meetings, newly fascinated by the way he gripped his quill and scrawled words along the parchment. The way the dark ink stained his skin, rushing into the gullies of his fingerprints. The way his nailbeds met the backs of his fingers. The way his fingers curved, strong and square yet surprisingly elegant, around the base of his quill. Potter stopped writing. Draco glanced up, realizing Potter was watching him. Draco looked away, his ears going a little red, and didn’t look back.
“I didn't know if you still wanted to... Er..." Potter cleared his throat. "Do you still need help with your potions? I mean. I can leave. If you want.”
not there a moment ago.
“Well,” Draco pushed himself to his feet. “At least tonight you had adult supervision, and I’m not about to let you fall over the battlements.”
to return to Hogwarts at all. The only reason he was sitting on the Hogwarts Express was because Hogwarts was the last possible place that contained it: The Fountain of Youth. And he had to find it. Because if he found it, it would be such a monumental discovery that it would make his career. It would undoubtedly wash away his past. He would no longer be known as Draco Malfoy, Death Eater. He would be known as the man who discovered The Fountain of Youth. And then, he would go abroad again to make some other brilliant discovery and find respect all over again.
of doing it with Harry. He intended to relish every moment as much as possible.
“In a minute!” Potter called, not taking his eyes off of Draco. Potter’s hand was still pressed warmly to his chest, and Potter’s thumb was doing that rubbing thing again. Draco felt like he had swallowed a snitch. Potter blinked at him, his eyes dripping with affection and concern. Draco couldn’t breathe. “I should really call a Healer.”
"Yeah," Harry said. "He was my partner for a while. One of the best. Who'd have thought, hmm?"
,” Potter intervened, his knuckles tightening a little around his pint, “neither of you can flirt with me and we can take another shot just because we feel like it, like normal people. Win, win. No one has to go blind.”
“Ha, ha, Potter,” Draco said flatly, slamming the trapdoor closed with his foot. “It’s good to see you’ve matured.”
. Growing frustrated with his own unstoppable thoughts, Draco marched over to the bed, pulled off the spare blanket, and dropped it to the floor behind the sofa. “The fact of the matter is, the Saviour of the Wizarding World is not sleeping on the floor, especially the night before the grand celebration in his honour. What would everyone say?"
“You’re...okay then?” Potter’s hand twitched against his back beneath his shoulder blade. "You're not hurt?"
Draco allowed the drop to slide down his throat.
Deep, stabilizing breaths of that cold night air. Bloody hell. He was smiling. His face was smiling of its own accord. Potter had merely waved a few nice, mildly suggestive words around and Draco’s face was flattered enough to start smiling without his permission. Draco sighed and kicked at a drowning stone by his foot. “You have nothing to thank me for.”
sorry for...that night. I just...I’m scared, honestly. I’ve never really been with a man before, and I don’t have the slightest idea what I’m doing."
Voldemort’s power still was. The worst of it was, Harry was probably their primary target.
Potter snorted into his pint. “Malfoy. She only wants me for my fame. I’ve told you. To most people I am a conquest. They only see my scar, not
The two Death Eaters entered another small room and Draco clutched his wand behind them, trying to determine how best to proceed. He could stupefy them, but as they were standing side by side one would very likely notice before Draco had the chance to fire a second spell. Then again, Draco would undoubtedly be catching them off their guard. He decided to take the risk.
Potters? Well, Potter had married a Weasley, hadn’t he? They were known for their tendency to reproduce. He really hoped that there weren’t any more. It was just his luck, anyway, having all of Potter’s hatchlings in his Potions classes. It was far more Potter-Weasels than anyone should rightfully have to encounter in a lifetime, and he had to see them all in a single day.
“This is not a bed. It's a

there weren’t detailed lists. Draco was only left with a single lead. The people at Carter’s estate had explained that in his lifetime, Carter had donated all of his discoveries to two major organizations: the National Museum of Wizarding Artifacts in London, and Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, his alma mater. And Draco had already been to London.
James shook his head. "I don't know. We got separated."
“Yes, now.” The coldness was back in his voice, and Potter pulled his glasses sharply from the bedside table, forced them onto his face and sat back, blinking at him.
James marched right past Draco with his wand drawn, but Draco curled his fist into the back of James' robes and pulled him back. "Oh,

Draco felt like someone had just stabbed him in the chest. He looked over to Potter’s silhouette, zooming around the Quidditch pitch. Ginny Weasley was
Everyone stared at Draco.
Each stretch of James' pacing grew closer and closer to where Draco was positioned, until Draco wondered if James was intending to shove him over the battlements. Finally, James stopped near Draco, stomping a foot as if he wasn't happy about his own decision. “What was it like? The war? Dad never talks about it.
Was that it then?
, yes, but he didn’t want to witness Harry dancing in front of the Wizarding World with a member of the Ministry, or even with Granger or Lily or any other person in this city of a crowd. The only person who should be dancing with Harry was
“Well then. Ten points from Gryffindor. And Mr. Potter,” Draco paused, looking at the slimy mess of overflowed Antidote Potion oozing over the lab table. There was a rush of noise in the hall. Class was over. “Clean that up before you leave.”
Which is why I don’t go home with people I meet in pubs.”
Draco opened the door wider and Potter walked in, looking uncharacteristically unsure of himself.
Draco slept through the night without any problems and spent Saturday in bed, drinking water like a fish. He spent most of Sunday with Granger in his classroom, running more tests on the potions he had consumed Friday night. Weasley would occasionally pop his head into the room and make light conversation when Draco and Granger weren't too deep in focus.
Potter protested as Draco pulled away, but it was only to rip Potter’s eyeglasses off of his face and toss them on the bedside table before pulling Potter closer, tighter, and then backward onto his bed. They landed diagonally, angled up on Draco’s mountain of silk pillows, and their mouths met again in a ferocious rush. Draco was eagerly exploring Potter’s taste, the edges of Potter’s mouth, the limits of this wondrous, mysterious
Harry arced up and bit Draco's lower lip, pulling Draco down on top of him and running his tongue along Draco’s lips before pushing between them. Draco groaned as the heat of Harry’s center met his--the tickling of hair against his bare flesh, the way their hardened cocks pressed together. Draco thought he would lose himself in it--in mouths and skin and the way they were grinding together in a way that made Draco’s head spin. Just as Draco feared he would lose himself right then and there, Harry rolled them over until Draco was beneath him, then bent down and took one of Draco’s nipples in his mouth, running it beneath his tongue. The sensation of golden heat was overwhelming.

No. It was definitely

Potter hurled himself upright on his elbows, gasping, his eyes wide and his face barely a foot from Draco’s. Draco saw that Potter was having this same realization. And saw Potter realize that Draco was realizing it. Potter’s attempt to lift his face had only served to put more weight in the lower half of his body, pressing their erect cocks even tighter together, adding friction as Potter shifted. The heat, the friction--it felt so

of Voldemort and his Death Eaters.
“I need to catch a portkey to Cairo on the morning of May Second in London, but it just so happens that all of the hotels are completely booked for the celebration. I overheard Weasley say that you had reserved a section of rooms specifically for Hogwarts staff. Do you have anything left for the night of May First?”
“During my time in Siberia--and at several other dig sites, in fact--I found reference to an ancient potion that I would like to learn more about. My studies finally pointed me toward ancient Egyptian ruins, but the ruins had already been explored by wizard and archaeologist Havartus Carter. Carter, as it turns out, donated most of his findings to two locations. I believe the potion, as well as additional texts about it, are now stored here at Hogwarts somewhere. I was hoping to obtain your permission to search the grounds for them.”

James shrugged. “I’ll say I read it in the newspapers. Can I see it?” James asked, nodding toward Draco’s forearm.

“Well, nearly,” Weasley shrugged. Then he noticed Potter sitting on Draco’s bed. “Harry, mate, you

Harry ran his hands from Draco’s bare shoulders down his arms and to his hands. As Harry tangled their fingers together, Draco felt himself unraveling. He pulled his hands from Harry's and instead slid them along either side of the familiar green silk tie. “Remember, Potter,” he said as he began to knot Harry's tie, “to relax. Smile through dinner. The guests will be thrilled to simply be in a room with you; you don’t even need to open your mouth. In fact,” Draco smiled, catching Harry’s eyes, “if dinner last night was any indication of how you act in social settings, I’d recommend opening your mouth as little as possible.”
Lily gasped, her face filling with animated, exaggerated horror.
“Professor Malfoy,” Granger was saying, and he forced himself to pay attention, “has been doing some very brave and brilliant potions work, as you may have seen in the parchment I posted this week. He needs an assistant, however, before he can be allowed to continue. Kindly, Healer Ruby Victoria has volunteered. Thank you, Healer Victoria.”
sleeping with rats, then?” Potter asked, jamming his hands into his pockets, peeling himself from the wall, and taking a few hopeful steps forward. He was grinning like an idiot, and it was making Draco nervous.
it’s...why didn’t you mention that at the trials? God, if I’d known, I—” Potter dug his hands into the mud at his sides, clenching dripping soil in his fists.
When Draco stepped back into the room, he found Potter sleeping on the floor, curled in the blanket Draco had left there. “Potter. What are you doing?”
Couldn’t he?
Draco sighed and leaned his temple against the window. It was early September and still warm yet, so the window felt comfortable against his skin. The trolley witch was in the hall, shouting, “It’s time!” and a couple of students ran toward her in the hall to make their final payments for sweets. As he listened to the

Now that his life was in real danger, he couldn’t believe he had actually entrusted a house elf with this task. Or anyone else, really. Potter was useless at potions; there was no way he would have been able to whip up any sort of antidote even if he'd wanted to.
Draco relayed stories about his research and his travels. The duchess lamented the passing of Lucius and Narcissa and discussed her plans in Paris. Eventually, Draco’s eagerness to find Harry overpowered everything else, and he politely excused himself to resume his battle through the crowds.
“Dad was touching it last! That means we win, right?”
Internally, Draco laughed. Outwardly, he frowned. “Because your son refused to follow simple instructions. He misbehaved in class. I requested that he clean his mess before he left, and he didn’t. Thus,” Draco waved his hand through the air, as if the conclusion should be obvious.

.” With the hand not holding the broom, Draco slowly reached down and began unfastening his waistcoat, one silver button at a time. He slid it off of his shoulders and sent it floating over to his robes. Potter’s eyes were glued to the silver shirt fitted tightly against Draco’s lean chest. Then Draco unfastened the cufflinks of his shirt sleeves, taking his time. He rolled his left sleeve up first, revealing the black leather gauntlet he kept around his Dark Mark. And then rolled up his right, slowly baring the pale skin of his forearm. When Draco had finished, Potter’s eyes darted back to Draco’s face as though he was trying not to get caught looking. “You name the teams,” Draco said, wriggling his fingers into a pair of thin black gloves.
there were two people who could each cast a full Patronus.
On New Year’s Eve, he didn’t even bother to join the miserable students in the Great Hall. He was perfectly capable of being miserable all by himself, thankyouverymuch, with his piles of morbid newspapers and his ever-flowing fountain of vermouth.
? To the point of physical distress? And then he found himself disliking the fact that Potter was in distress. Draco found himself wanting to lean over, and pull him back down to the earth, and cradle himself back against Potter’s chest and...No. No that wasn’t right at all. He just wished he had brought a calming drought. That was a far more reasonable thought to have. “He

“Lox!”
, because that was the
Draco traced his fingers across the gentle rolling muscles of Harry’s chest, over his shoulders and down his arms, afraid to close his eyes in fear that this would be his only chance to see Harry this way--wet, naked, and dripping. He was afraid that if he closed his eyes, Harry would remember all of the reasons for his anger and disappointment the night before, and disappear.
Despite the apology, he and Harry still avoided each other as the weeks progressed. For his part, Draco avoided Harry because he suspected that they would inevitably fall into old habits and Harry would hate him again. Avoidance was a far more reliable tactic than opening himself to be hurt, was it not? It was certainly safer. Besides, when Draco had boarded the Hogwarts Express, he had no idea that Harry would be waiting for him at the other end of it. He was only here for his research, and then he would gone. He'd already made his decision. He'd made it before he had even arrived. He would finish his potions research, and then he would leave. There was no point in brooding over a man that had never really been his in the first place.
“I’ll stop by a cafe on my way to the station.”
Potter safe. Three to go.
Really, Potter was an absolute slob--what did Draco see in him? Nothing. Obviously. He couldn’t see anything in someone who was such a slob, even if it
When Draco had finished all the work he could possibly do, he took long walks alone across the grounds, trying not to think about Potter. Trying not to think about that delightful golden light of his touch. Trying not to think about Potter’s face after he had punched him to the floor.
“Not to
“A fucking trap. Didn’t I tell you so, Potter?” Draco said, reaching for his wand. But it was no longer on him. It had flung away in the fall, and as he frantically began searching the dirt floor, he realized that it was not in the pit with him.
“Go jump in the lake,” Malfoy mumbled, stepping out of the dungeon alcove and into the hallway. So much for  professionalism. There was something notably miraculous about Potter’s ability to transform him into a teen-aged boy. Maybe the Fountain of Youth was right under his nose. Maybe the Fountain of Youth was really Harry Potter, and all he had to do was jab a dozen needles into his neck to extract it. Gladly. Maybe then Potter wouldn’t look so bloody pleased with himself. Or maybe he would.
"No you won't," Harry said with a sly smile, bending to trace his tongue along the top of Draco's thigh. "You like me too much." To prove his point,
Draco nearly kicked the air in exasperation. "Fuck you, Potter." If he'd learned anything over the last few months, it was that Harry was a fucking
“Come on, Dad. Let’s get this over with.”
“S.O.S.? Don’t be so dramatic. You’ll be fine.” But she sounded less sure. As she waited for the cauldron to heat up, she paced nervously back and forth in front of him, running more diagnostic spells.
Once most of his students had come around to either fearing him or respecting his authority, his classes went fairly smoothly. The Potter-Weasels somehow managed to bring him the most fun. He greatly enjoyed finding excuses to trim points from Gryffindor on James’ behalf, or add points to Slytherin on account of Albus’ astounding potions knowledge. Lily was a more neutral party; he didn’t give her points, but he didn’t take them away either.
As Draco stood in the dungeon alcove, it dawned on him that Potter had known. Potter had
Fuck all, maybe Potter was right. Maybe, in some bizarre twist of fate, after a lifetime of contempt and rivalry between them, Potter was now the last person he had left in the entire world. The last person who wouldn’t abandon him for his Mark, because he already

“I--”
Draco began pacing on the battlements, watching Potter below. He fully expected to see James run out to his father and tell him everything, but the moment never came.
Instead, he studied all of the things that both had and hadn’t changed since Dumbledore’s time. McGonagall’s portrait was right next to Dumbledore’s and Snape’s on the wall closest to Granger’s desk. Granger had to be one of the youngest leaders of Hogwarts in history, but it suited her. She had always been an excellent scholar; Draco had never, at least internally, denied that much.
Draco had never been particularly skilled at casting silent, wandless spells, but too many lives depended on him; he couldn't fail. Draco summoned every bit of Harry's arrogant luck as he could and cast a silent, wandless screaming spell. The Death Eater who had spoken the words began screaming. Draco had briefly considered a Cruciatus Curse, but knew he wouldn’t actually be able to cast it effectively because he didn’t
He and Potter had hated each other for most of their lives. Why should he care if Potter hated him now? His own words from the truth potion echoed back into his ears.
“It’s ridiculous. You may as well have a giant target painted on your arse.”
“Don’t! Just don’t.” Harry slammed his door closed in both of their faces.
Granger smiled a little awkwardly, as though she had already asked herself the same question. “What’s the old saying? Keep your friends close and your enemies closer?”
“Abroad-ish.”
was a very large place, after all. Certainly they could each find someone else. ...Maybe not someone else that filled them with light, but that was fine. That was normal. Who needed golden magical sensations anyway? They were horribly distracting.
? Why can’t we have an alcohol fountain in our room?” Weasley was staring at the Fountain of Vermouth, which was still going strong.
“The cane you gave Lily!
why the girl from the train looked familiar. Draco watched her walk toward the Sorting Hat. The Weasley hair, the Potter bone structure. It suddenly made sense. She was Potter-Weasel heathen spawn.
“Mmm!” Draco hummed as Harry pressed forward until he was halfway inside of Draco, fucking
in him for some inexplicable reason. He was interested in Draco, even when Draco had been at his worst. This whole bloody time, through the war and all of it, Harry had
Suddenly a small object clattered near his feet and Draco felt his limbs being pulled tightly together.
Then they were snogging wildly in the middle of the ballroom floor.
Draco swallowed his heart, which had inconveniently decided to lodge itself in his throat.
Draco closed his eyes and groaned. Harry was going to
“Thank you, Mr. Potter, for your enthusiastic vote of confidence.” Draco's tone was apathetic, but inwardly, he was smiling.
"Tell me, Draco," Harry said huskily, taunting Draco by just barely pressing the tip of his cock inside and then retreating.
James shook his head. "Haven't seen them."
?" Harry mock-laughed. "You knew exactly who we were when they captured us."
his clothes on. Draco was so thoroughly, completely fucked.
Potter disappeared into the bathroom and Draco heard running water shortly thereafter. Draco stood in the room, feeling a little strange. He was leaving for Cairo in the morning. He used to love Cairo. There were some unknowns surrounding Egypt’s Revolution, yes, but that wasn't enough to stop him from going. Why wasn’t he looking forward to it as much as he had been expecting?
. Albus Potter--he might just have to ignore the Potter part--was proving to be his favourite student thus far.
. He certainly knew how
intended for his wife, as a warning for Potter. It wasn’t clear. Either way, Ginny was dead, and they hadn’t caught who did it. Draco stared at the small photo of the suspected Death Eater, but didn’t recognize him. Then he looked at the larger photo of Potter standing in a cafe with a shattered window and toppled tables and chairs. Draco couldn’t actually see Ginny’s body in the photo, but a rivulet of red hair near the bottom of the frame made the photo gruesome enough. And that look on Potter’s face--Draco had seen it before. That look of complete and utter shock. Of undiluted grief. He had seen that look on Potter’s face more times than he wanted to admit. He'd seen it after the astronomy tower. He'd seen it in Malfoy Manor. He'd seen it after the war. Draco watched the photo until Potter buried his face in his hands and his shoulders shook with the force of his sobs.
“Potter?” Draco tapped his knuckles against the bathroom door. “What time is dinner?”
“Why do you have to be such a brainless egotistical peacock?”
Draco’s mouth tightened into a smile. “If you insist, Potter.” He really shouldn’t, but he couldn’t help himself. He slowly reached up to the top button of his robes and undid one. Button. After. Another. Potter’s eyes followed Draco’s hand, and as Draco slid his hand smoothly down the middle of his robes to part them open, Potter’s eyes flicked back to Draco’s face. “I’ll need a broom,” Draco said, floating his robes over to a bench with a flick of his wand. Potter didn’t say anything, didn’t even appear to be holding a wand, but a sleek broom flew from somewhere in the pitch and smacked into Potter’s open palm. Potter extended his arm, pointing the tip of the broom toward Draco without even breaking eye contact. Draco took the broom cautiously, suddenly aware of the fact that he hadn’t flown in fifteen years, and painfully aware of how much he wanted to impress Potter, rather than fall flat on his face. This may have been a bad idea. He looked at Potter nervously. Or...maybe it hadn’t been a bad idea? Potter was
to you, Draco, that I will never,
“I’d like that.” He still wasn’t quite comfortable with the fact that Granger was treating him—well, mostly—as if nothing negative had ever transpired between them. It was hard for him to believe that she wasn’t bitter. Instead, he actually found himself impressed. If she

next to him, because the bed was enormous, but it was the principle of the thing.
“Thanks, Ron,” Harry said flatly.
“That was different.”
get what you want?” Draco murmured fondly into Potter's neck, taking the wand. He focused on the golden light between them and barely needed to whisper before his Patronus was shimmering before them.
! While we...while I let you--”
Potter blinked. “Draco, you really don’t have to do this if you don’t—mmm"
if he had to, he just needed to find
The force of Potter's fist stole Draco's vision as he stumbled backward and fell against the floor, the pastry toppling from his hand and the pumpkin juice spilling down his silk shirt and splashing across the stones. The silver mug hit the hall floor with a loud

“No, I don’t think so. I think...I think this is one of Hagrid’s old holding pens for magical creatures. I don’t know if we can--where’s my wand?” They looked up and saw the distant silhouette of a wand against a glimpse of moonlight, teetering high, on the edge of the dirt wall. The moon disappeared behind a cloud, and they were plunged back into darkness. Potter reached up, clearly trying to cast a silent, wandless Accio, but the wand didn’t budge. He tried again, this time vocalizing the spell, but the wand still didn’t move. Potter kicked the side of the wall. “Urgh! This must be a pen that limits magic.”
Soon there was a commotion toward the front of the room and he saw the crowd widening to form a circle. Draco pushed and pushed and pushed. He rocked on his toes, trying to see between one head and the next, continuing to force his way through the crowd.
with Flora over there.”
"Okay..."
He stupefied one Death Eater and, just as the other began to turn around, he stupefied her as well. Draco cast an Incarcerous and a disillusionment charm over them and ran through the halls toward the throne room. There were still nine Death Eaters left, possibly more.
“After breakfast we’ll come back with wizard’s chess, won’t we Albus?" Lily said. "Then you’ll be out of here in no time.”
that way. Not just with a smile here or there, but with joy. Pure, unsullied
James nodded reluctantly.
It was the phrasing. Draco knew perfectly well what Harry meant, but his mind drifted to places he knew it shouldn’t. Back in the ballroom at Hogwarts, Harry had already confessed to never being with a man before, hadn't he?
. Draco pushed Harry onto that giant bed and remained standing, if only to take a moment to
“There's nothing to be overly concerned about. Potter and I are capable of being professional. We’ll be fine.”
“Oh and,” Draco added, looking toward the Quidditch pitch. “If you ever change your mind about flying and want a Slytherin to show you how it’s done, I can help with that too. I was the Slytherin seeker for four years running.”
Harry’s brows drew together, his face all severity and tight lines, any lingering dreaminess gone. Draco instantly realized his mistake.
Granger’s mouth curved into a smile around her teacup. “Go to the library and tell Ms. Lingenhopper your name. By the time you get there, I will make sure you have been authorized to view everything we have on file.”
Draco felt as if he had just caught a golden snitch. Wasn’t this exactly what he had always
to keep talking. Draco clenched his fists at his sides and felt himself begin to sweat. He felt like a bottle of champagne under growing pressure, but he was fighting it--Merlin, it was taking every ounce of energy he had to fight it, but it was bordering on physical pain and he didn’t think he could resist it much longer. He could feel himself growing pale as a droplet of sweat eased down the side of his face. His whole body began trembling.
“Does anyone else wish to blaspheme? No? I
Draco was growing aware of Potter’s precarious position. On top of him. With the inability to move. When Potter had fallen, Potter’s hands, hiding deep within his too-long pyjama sleeves, had been on either side of Malfoy’s head, and now they were pressed tightly together behind Draco’s neck, bound at the wrists. Potter’s legs were also bound tightly together from thigh to ankle, and….
“Oh dear. Well. He is currently away on business at the moment, but he is expected back in a few days. You have time to...prepare. Or...whatever it is you need to do.” She shifted uncomfortably and then let out an explosive sigh. "I'm sorry, Malfoy, but as it pertains to the welfare of this school I really must ask. Will you be...capable? Of working professionally in such close proximity to Harry?”
Draco spent the next hour just trying to get Potter’s arms and stance right. It was torture. Every exhale of Harry's breath, every accidental brush of skin reminded Draco what he had lost. He tried to touch Harry over their clothing as much as possible, but inevitably they were still required to join
“Scouth, Potter.” Draco rolled his eyes. “
Potter looked up. “What? Bed?”
tried to apologize for what he'd said that night he took the Potion of Truth, but he wasn't entirely sure she'd forgiven him.
He had never stayed in the same place for very long, and he certainly wouldn’t be staying at Hogwarts for very long either.
“I suppose that’s something for tomorrow," Draco said. "Find out why a dementor was stalking you across school grounds.”
. He hated it when Harry could see right through him.
Draco couldn’t really sit; he was sort of floating. He was standing next to Potter, in the middle of Potter’s bed, with the bed coming up to his thighs as though he were standing in water. Draco watched Potter breathe until he was convinced he was asleep.
Death Eaters, or how the man you once dragged through the mud just saved my life? Or perhaps you’d be more interested in how he saved the lives of my children?” Harry was suddenly speaking with such suave confidence that Draco didn’t even know where it had come from.
She nodded.
“Say it.”
“How did you know where to find--?”
to stupefy these Death Eaters like he had stupefied the others, but they had already seen him in the doorway. He lacked the element of surprise.
find my dad, Professor," James said desperately. "Don't let them--" James swallowed nervously. "He can't--"
He groaned again.
It was never particularly obvious; it was in a supportive hand against a back. A gentle word. A softening of the eyes.
“Yes, Mr. Malfoy, sir,” the house elf said, looking a little nervous.
...But there was nothing Draco could say that this Snape would hear. Draco left the room before his regret could overwhelm him.
Nothing happened.
Potter pulled his son into an embrace. “I’ll be fine. I’ve been doing this for a long time. I need you to go find Aunt Hermione and tell her what’s happened, alright? If there’s any sign of trouble here, send up a flare with your wand. You remember how to do that?”
, one went and burned to death before his very eyes, and most of the others ended up in Azkaban. He couldn't deal with any more of that now; he was focusing on his career.
Bloody hell, he needed to go back
the money, it was true, but in the early days being paid kept him away from his father. After the war, he swore would never ask anything of his father ever again. He had asked for love and protection, and look where that had gotten him. He would not be caught dead on his knees begging his father for a single knut. So he worked. He traveled, he researched, and he worked. It was a most un-Malfoyan lifestyle, which meant that he trusted it.
If he weren’t gay, he'd probably consider asking Hermione Granger to marry him. She was brilliant.
Saliva wasn’t nearly enough, especially not for Harry’s first time, so Draco cast a quiet spell to properly lube up his second finger before he slowly inched it alongside the first. Harry moaned and his cock throbbed in Draco’s mouth. Draco pulled away, worried that Harry was going to come before he wanted him to. Draco began to scissor his fingers apart, and Harry gripped the sheets tightly in his fists.
He would come back after he had composed himself. He would find Harry when he was alone and accessible, and tell Harry everything he wanted to say. If Harry rejected him, he would go to Cairo like he had originally planned. He would retreat into his work and keep himself so busy that he would never have time to think about Harry Potter again.
my dad, so...I guess. I dunno. Maybe you’re alright. For now.”
Well, at least they
“What was it? Whatwasit! Whatwasit! Whatwasit!” Lily bounced up and down on the edge of the bed.
. Fidgeting, toe-scuffing students trying to conjure predatory fucking frogs in his fucking bedroom. Bastards, the lot of them. Draco stumbled across the room and practically ripped the door off of its hinges with his wand at the ready, then wobbled until he regained his balance. “I said--!” he yelled angrily into the dark hallway. He blinked. He looked left and right down the hallway and saw no one. But he could have sworn he heard a swishing of robes, followed by footsteps hastening away from his room and down the hall. “And stay out!” he yelled and returned to his room, mumbling something so incoherent that even
“What!” was all he could manage to say.
Draco and Potter lifted their shotglasses to clink against Weasley’s and they all swallowed the shot.
Draco found the trapdoor that led into the dungeons and pulled the heavy iron coil attached to the wood. He eased the door back against the wooden floor as quietly as he could. He looked down into the dark square in the floor, trying to ignore the horrid smell and clammy air that now encircled him. There was really no telling what he would find, so he decided it would be best if he held his wand at the ready. Two laughably narrow stone steps were visible in the torchlight, but what lurked below them was anyone’s guess.
“I was Head Auror for--” Potter cut himself off. “Wait, you actually think that I--” But Potter never had a chance to finish, because the green light of the Dark Mark flickered out, and they were surrounded by darkness. The only light was from the moon, which kept fading in and out behind thick grey clouds.
Well, the war made everyone a little crazy. Everyone was convinced they were going to die anyway, probably Potter most of all. Frankly, Draco was surprised they hadn’t
his misery and regret.
. And because it was wandless, there was no pink line of light from his wand to betray him. The Death Eaters had no way of knowing that Draco had cast anything other than an Unforgivable Curse.
“That depends,” Potter said, licking water from his lips.
“Well, in that case, I believe
no matter how impossible a situation seemed. Draco swallowed tightly. This Dumbledore was chatting with Professor McGonagall about the welfare of the students with dementors floating about.
And why was the absent-minded Potter spending so much time thinking in great detail about the room that contained his
“I’m tempted to cast an Incendio and put it out of its misery. It’s not even worth sitting on. There is not a single place to sit on this sofa that doesn’t bring about physical pain. Believe me, I’ve tried.” Potter lightly bounced up and down on another area of the sofa and grimaced. “I would’ve expected better from a place that looks this posh.”
And then Potter punched him square in the jaw.
Bloody hell, was he really
“Well, if you find it, let me know and I’ll be happy to help. You're welcome to continue exploring the dungeons. Maybe it’s down there somewhere, and was just misplaced?”
Malfoy groaned. Was Potter imagining what it would be like to have Draco cradling his sacks right now? To have Draco stroking his cock?
“I--” Potter cleared his throat. “I suppose it would make the most sense to have us on opposite teams. To make things more even. And since James...well maybe it would be better if you teamed with Lily.”
if they had even been anything at all. But apparently his dick hadn’t gotten the message. Draco was relieved he had decided to keep his lower half outside of the bathroom. "I said," Draco tried very hard to keep his voice steady, "are you going to be long?"
Merlin, had that question actually come out of
Malfoy, I’m so sorry. When you said you hadn’t picked up a single British newspaper, I didn’t think you meant
Draco nodded.
“I thought the Malfoys were dead.”
Harry slowly pulled back out again and paused with the head of his cock just barely in Draco's arse, his eyes glinting darkly with desire and mischief.

“Opportunity,” Granger was clarifying. “The people who likely end up in this room are thinking with some kind of purpose in mind. Pursuing some kind of opportunity. And the magic is somehow linked not to you, Malfoy, but to where the potion was consumed. Like that,” Granger pointed at the Fountain of Vermouth. “I would bet that came directly from a potion, didn’t it?”
“You remember most of this from your school days, I expect? Some areas were rebuilt after the war, but on the whole it should be the same.” Granger opened the door wide to the Potions classroom. “I trust I can skip the grand tour of the castle?”
“Fine, but then why not use

daydreaming about Potter in his arms, Potter in his bed, Potter in the shower, Potter, Potter, Potter.
“No,” Draco said shakily, and then took a breath and straightened his shoulders, pushing down the feelings of rejection and vulnerability welling up inside of him and shielding himself in the cold familiarity of the old Draco Malfoy. “No, Weasley,” he sighed, smoothing back his hair. “I’ve lost my appetite.” He spun down the hall, casting a cleaning charm over his shoulder at the food on the floor and flung the bloodied handkerchief over his shoulder.
. “You sent my son.
Draco nearly tripped over the rug.
“Yes, and once the potion reacted with the down in his pillow--goose feathers, Malfoy, like all Hogwarts pillows, you know this--the entire pillow incinerated, the bed caught fire,” (this was the part where Draco was trying very, very hard to not burst out laughing) “and the entire room became an inferno in the middle of the night before a group of sixth and seventh years were able to extinguish the fire with some water spells. One of James’ roommates had to go to the Hospital Wing.”

Draco sighed and began to roll down his sleeve, blocking the Mark from view.
as Potter began grinding their erections together. Draco gasped into Potter's mouth, suddenly worried he might come in his trousers. When Potter abruptly sat up, removing his mouth and cock from Draco’s body long enough to unbutton more of Draco’s shirt, reality came crashing back into Draco's head.
Potter swallowed a little too quickly and coughed before bumping his fist against his chest a couple of times. "Yes?" He choked, and Draco was genuinely tempted to

. As if this was a thought Potter had all the time: Malfoy and Potter saving the world.
Draco threw the covers over their heads as they pressed their mouths together, giggling like schoolboys.
"Draco," Harry's breath hitched and he moaned softly, thrusting his hips upward against the sheet.
Now their erect cocks were separated only by a thin layer of cotton and a thin layer of silk. Draco could feel
When Draco had overheard someone in London say that Slughorn was retiring, it was all too perfect. He applied for the position of Potions Master, doubtful that he would even be considered for the position. With his history at Hogwarts and his associations with a certain Dark Lord, he suspected they wouldn’t exactly welcome him back with open arms.
For quite possibly the first time in their entire lives, Harry was offering his hand. To
“Oh, after the waltz! You were going to say something and I completely forgot.”
When he had a surplus of ingredients, he began browsing the library for newspapers, trying to see if there was any news about Death Eaters on the rise and what they might want with Hogwarts. He didn’t find anything. He didn’t even flinch when he saw Harry’s face on a page with the heading:

“Draco,” Harry whined, his voice breathy and hoarse and something like a desperate cry. Draco froze, afraid that he had hurt him. Harry blinked up at him dazedly, looking flushed and already thoroughly fucked. “Don’t you dare stop,” Harry whispered as he reached desperately for Draco’s hips, looking up with a fiery intensity that caused Draco to groan and lean down, pressing his forehead against Harry’s as he readjusted his weight onto his elbows. Harry lifted his chin and slid his tongue into Draco’s mouth. The sensation of being so consumed by Harry--filling and being filled--caused Draco to thrust again, harder this time. Feeling Harry around his cock was unbelievable--almost painfully hot and tight. Harry cried out--that desperate, aching moan of a sound—as Draco reached down to wrap one hand around Harry’s cock. They parted mouths and gazed at each other, desperate for breath, as Draco began to stroke.
He had to get this under control.
He was doomed.
. Or so Draco imagined. No one had said any of those things to him in his life, so he wouldn’t really know. Still, Draco could feel himself unraveling. He could feel himself coming completely undone beneath Potter’s gaze.
“Well,” Weasley sighed, helping Draco to his feet. “That went well," he said sarcastically.
a mansion, technically, but that was another matter entirely. It was far easier to keep his life simple, since he was constantly packing it away.
Draco playfully nudged Potter with his knee.
. Any lingering doubt in Draco’s mind bloomed fully into joy. He could feel tears, obnoxiously pesky things, threatening to well up in his eyes as he smiled. Draco willed them away. He would not
“Why? How?”
“Not really. I’m on patrol.”
“Oh, just
Out of the corner of his eye, Draco saw Potter dive and then Draco was diving too, catching up, diving right beside him, and then behind the stands. They were neck and neck, both reaching forward, shoulders pressed tightly together.
“I do
...But how? He was stuck in the past until the potion wore off. Until then, he had absolutely no control. Did time work the same between this vision and reality? Was he still in the station at this very moment? How long would he be trapped in this ghostly past, far away from the man he so desperately wanted to pull into his arms?
“Sure. Fine.” Potter was watching Draco, and Draco was watching him back. Draco cleared his throat. “Well, I suppose I’ll be going. Where do you want the broom, Potter?”
"I didn't realize that spell worked on people.” Draco slid his thumb along the fabric at Harry’s wrist and then dipped beneath it just long enough to
“Lilly,” Harry muttered, “this really isn’t--” Lily lovingly smacked his ribs and he stopped talking.
"Hold on, Malfoy," Longbottom said. "My partner's hit, and we may be outnumbered. We need to wait for backup."
“You hear me, Potter?” Draco called. There wasn’t an answer, but Harry emerged a few minutes later wearing Draco’s favourite hideous pyjamas and a pair of plaid cotton boxer shorts.
Draco hadn't the slightest idea that his father's walking stick was warded, but he was grateful for it. Fortunate, that. "How many Death Eaters left?" Draco asked.
“I’m so sorry,” Harry whispered against his mouth. “I didn’t know...” Harry traced his tongue along Draco’s lower lip and then pulled away.
Draco began pushing his way forward, determined to find Harry. His father’s cane was particularly helpful in this task, as he could gently press it into the crowd ahead of him and make a path if he was unable to push himself through directly.
Leave it to Potter to turn into a stammering imbecile. Draco flicked open the bedcurtains with his wand and blinked against the light, so that the whole situation looked...well...
Back in his quarters, Draco transformed the overstuffed green leather armchair into a large wooden desk that fit nicely against the wall by the fireplace. Much better. He would do most of his work in his quarters, and use the office only sparingly for student meetings.
Draco walked across the room and moved Potter’s arm into the correct position. Having a legitimate excuse to actually

. Draco both loved it and hated it. Granted, he was also quite content to tease Harry right back whenever possible. Draco rocked his hips, trying to push Harry deeper inside of himself, but Harry pulled his cock just out of reach. Draco felt himself pouting.
“But words are just words, aren’t they? They’re not...
“I seem to be having a little potions problem.” Potter blinked dumbly at him. Merlin, his face was close. Why was his face so close? Why was his chest pressed so tightly against his? Potter lifted his chin and arced his neck, trying to push against Draco’s mattress with his elbows as he blinked even more dumbly at the ceiling. “A potions problem involving doors,” Draco clarified. Potter, growing tired of awkwardly straining to see the roof of Draco’s bedcurtains, allowed his face to fall against the mattress in the space between Draco’s neck and shoulder. Draco tried very hard to ignore Potter’s hot, heavy breaths against his neck, but they were threatening to give him a terrible case of gooseflesh. The feeling of Potter’s hideous pyjamas against his bare shoulders. Potter’s warm chest and shoulders, pressed so tightly against his own.
Harry snorted.
to understand what loneliness means.” Draco looked at the ground again, rubbing his sore chest. “You want to know what happened to me? After the war, my family was completely ostracized. No invitations, no social ties, no way to start a new life. We were completely cut off. Unable to distract themselves or recover from the horrors of the war, my parents’ health suffered until I made them leave the country. Any remaining friends I had who
“I’d appreciate if you didn’t refer to my children as hatchlings, Malfoy.”
“I can still work with the Ministry from afar. I can even make the occasional appearance. Maybe I’ll bring my very famous date,” Draco nudged Harry. “We’ll be the talk of the country.”
Draco slumped forward. He was Draco

Granger was nodding slowly, clearly thinking this through. “It could be a significant discovery, yes. However, since you do not know its exact effects, I do have some concerns. There is too much that we don’t know. We do not know exactly what this potion might do. I agree that this may have the power to be revolutionary, but in the wrong hands it could also be a disaster. Could you imagine a world in which Voldemort had access to a Fountain of Youth, on top of everything else?” Granger took another sip of her tea. And another. “However, I think this is important work.” Granger lifted her teacup to her lips, but set it back down again. “Professor Malfoy, if I give you unrestricted access to donation records and the freedom to explore Hogwarts grounds for this Fountain of Youth, can I trust you to provide me with regular updates about your findings?”
Draco's facade, break down his shields, and somehow turn Draco into a joyful blubbering fool. Still. Maybe they would never be what the other really needed; maybe they would never truly be enough. What Potter had said about them in the pit--that maybe they were the last people in the world for each other--that had made sense at the time. But they had tried and failed. Worse things happened every day. The

that all Draco wanted to do was pull Harry into his arms, kiss his forehead, and hold him tight. In this stage of Potter’s life, Draco had been nothing but cruel and insensitive, delighting in every opportunity to get under Harry's skin by bullying him and his friends. Yet despite everything, Harry was still

. First thing on a Saturday morning. Like it was the most normal thing in the world. Draco kind of liked it.
“My name is Draco Malfoy. I’m the new Potions Master, and I--” He started to look across the table at Granger, but his eyes drifted to the person at her right side. Potter was sitting across the table, leaning back in his chair with his arms crossed over his chest, watching him with open, grudging curiosity. A lock of dark hair had fallen over his forehead and he had gotten rid of his beard.  He was freshly shaven and looked far cleaner than the night he had first arrived. His robes were a little unbuttoned at the top, revealing that same black t-shirt he had been wearing that first night. Draco wondered if he was wearing those same jeans, too, the ones with that perfect three-inch tear in the thigh, just perfect enough for a finger to slide through and--
“Merlin, Harry!”
“I really wish you wouldn’t--”
something. Without moving off of the floor, Draco lazily summoned a mug from his bedside table and stuck it into the falling vermouth between the second and third tier. He took a sip. It wasn’t terrible, as far as vermouth went. Still, he felt a little unnerved by Potion 1. Sure, he had felt like absolute shite for a few minutes, but was that it? It didn’t

it even. The crowd had parted enough for Draco to see a dozen Death Eaters near the entrance of the Grand Ballroom. Draco's stomach curled in on itself when he saw several bodies sprawled across the floor near the entrance. The poor witches and wizards had probably been caught too off-guard or shocked to even think to defend themselves. Draco could only hope they were still alive.
“And with any luck, I won’t be for much longer.”
“Oh!” she said, sounding a little surprised as she batted her smiling eyes. “Oh, of course, Mr. Malfoy. I had the pleasure of working with your father.” The...
“I felt it too,” Draco said a little miserably. “Although I think we'd best forget it."
“There could be.”
Unenlightened fools, the lot of them. It took a certain level of willful ignorance, a blindness to the real meaning of justice, and a lack of empathy for anyone to believe that supporting Voldemort and his supremacist ideals was a worthy cause. Draco knew, because
Draco swallowed and reached for the door handle. He hesitated. Took a breath. He pushed the door open ever so slightly. He poked his head into the bathroom. There was a large mirror over a beautiful white sink. The shower happened to be in a large white jacuzzi tub; Draco could just make out the details through the small gap not hidden by the shower curtain. ...The shower curtain that undoubtedly concealed a very naked Harry Potter. Draco swallowed nervously. “Are you going to be long?” he mumbled as if something had suddenly gotten stuck in his throat.

Draco lifted Harry's black robe from the back of a chair, and Harry turned to slip his arms into the sleeves. “Politicians are scarier.”
“I think I’m going to be sick,” Draco murmured, and he did feel a little nauseous after Weasley and Granger’s hideous display. Merlin, what would it be like to have someone like that in his life? To be so comfortable with someone? To swoop someone up and kiss their neck and...he blinked over at Potter. Potter blinked back.
it to life, and hoping that these Death Eaters wouldn't question it. The dead, unmoving Mark shivered into motion, writhing beneath the tip of his wand.
“Can you tell me what happened when you opened the door the first time? Were you casting a spell, anything like that?”
When the first years had left his room, he had an hour to make some tea and prepare for the next class. Fifth years. Very angsty fifth years. He gave them a similar opening lecture about what to expect from the year, and then assigned them the task of making a poison antidote, to confirm that everyone had successfully retained information from their previous year and also to give himself a moment of peace.
"Potter, get up! Cast!"
. If he found something he liked, what was the harm in buying some new robes before he left London? He stepped inside. The tailor was measuring someone new, and barely looked up as Draco entered. “Do you have any robes that could be ready within the hour?” Draco asked. He may as well travel to Cairo in style. Because that’s all this was for. Cairo.
...Sometimes Draco even thought about the way Potter used to peel his sweat-soaked uniform over his head in the changing room after a Quidditch match. ...The way his muscles would roll so beautifully along his shoulder blades and... Draco shook the thought from his head. Back to focusing on the hatred. The hatred of Potter.
He could do this.

“What’d that one say?” Draco asked.
“Daaaaad,” James said impatiently.
Albus nodded eagerly and followed Draco’s suggestions. He didn’t smirk. He didn’t talk back.
Eventually Harry grew more confident as they danced, widening the steps until they were spiraling around the crowded edges of the circle, their robes flying out in wide, graceful circles behind them. Harry led Draco into a hold that allowed Draco to lean back, posing in their perfect form, thighs and hips nearly pressed together--Draco could feel Harry’s tantalizing heat against his legs, against his abdomen, and then they were spinning again. As the dance progressed, Harry dared even the most complicated steps they had practiced; he led Draco into steps that even Draco wouldn’t have attempted at such an important event, had he been the one leading. Despite Harry’s nervousness, he was perfect. He was far better now, dancing in front of all these people, than he had ever been in practice. Typical Potter.
Draco reached up and touched his lips, which were rapidly growing cold in the absence of that tingling golden heat.
. People will follow your lead. You can set whatever trend you wish.  If you make a mistake, don’t panic, because even your mistakes will be seen as fashionable. There,” Draco said, wiggling the knot of the tie back and forth. “Your royal subjects await.”

Draco and Harry were the last to arrive; Granger, Weasley, and the gaggle of children were already seated and waiting for them. There were several additional Hogwarts faculty members sitting toward one end of the table and two members of the Ministry of Magic sitting toward the middle, across from the only two remaining seats. Draco reflexively pulled his arm away from Harry as they approached the two chairs between Granger and Albus. The last thing he wanted was to make Harry appear less respectable to Ministry members by being on Draco's arm.
“M-- Professor Malfoy?”
As contagious as her enthusiasm was, Draco preferred not to have anyone jumping on his perfectly soft bed. Draco grunted. When she didn’t stop, he put forth a little extra effort to form words. “Off the bed, Granger,” he managed.

. He could feel Potter’s nervous breath on his thumb, chest rising and falling against his hand. Draco wanted this. How could he have thought for an instant he hadn’t wanted this? He had wanted this for a fucking lifetime. There was no possible way that some muscled stranger who didn’t even know the first thing about Potter was going to be the last person whispering provocative things into his ear and making him flush tonight. Absolutely not. If he had his way, the muscled stranger would be completely forgotten, replaced only with thoughts of Draco Malfoy.
Draco’s eyes lifted to Potter, who was still hovering in the air in his Quidditch gear and looking very much like sex on a broomstick. “I’ll dirty my robes,” was all he could think of saying.
Draco tried to speak, but couldn’t form words. He couldn’t even
Draco sat forward in his seat. “The Elder Wand no longer has a master,” he offered. “Potter came to the conclusion that it was far too dangerous a weapon for any Witch or Wizard, and he didn’t want its power to fall into the wrong hands.”
He found his younger self studying in the Slytherin common room. He tried touching his younger self. He tried standing in the same space as his younger self. That didn’t work either. Nothing worked. He tried test after test, and nothing changed.

Draco finally gave up on anything in the north dungeons, deciding that east was the most reliable direction. So he began exploring east, and the balls of light followed him down whichever corridor he chose. He poked his head into dungeon rooms as he passed them, allowing the balls of light to swirl into each room and circle the ceiling like flighty insects so that he could see. Many of the rooms were empty, or contained old furniture: moldy mattresses, crumbling barrels, and rusty chests. Just when Draco was considering turning back to get lunch, he opened a large wooden door and allowed the balls of light to flutter inside. The room wasn’t very wide compared to the first main dungeons room, but it was long. It appeared to keep going endlessly. The room was filled with worn wooden shelves, and the shelves were packed full with--
Draco stepped outside of Harry's bed curtains, internally debating how long it would take for a hormonal teenager to finish a wank and where else he should wander in the meantime. All of his thoughts abruptly stopped when he heard Potter softly moan a single word behind him.
Everyone was staring at him.
“Language. And you most certainly are not.”
Draco felt Potter’s thumb moving almost imperceptibly along the back of his neck beneath his pyjama sleeves, and it sent a jolt of electricity rushing through every inch of his body. He felt his cock throb, and he knew Potter felt it too, because Potter’s mouth twitched--just
Draco didn’t bother to let him finish before he pulled him into another breathtaking kiss. They were on a tight schedule, after all. Best not waste a second of it.
? He, on the other hand, felt like he was going mad. He took a stabilizing breath. He was working. He had to keep his wits about him.
Draco spun around, extending his wand in the direction of whomever had spoken and bringing his voice to a deep, rumbling shout. “Who
“Out!” The three students skittered back to the door, opened it, and were gone. The door seemed to melt into the wall, and then he was staring at his normal wall. With minimal movement, he slid his mug off of his desk, stuck it under the Fountain of Vermouth, brought it to his lips, and took several cringingly large gulps. A door opened in his ceiling. “OUT!” he yelled. It slammed closed immediately.
“Nah. They’re making me stay for the rest of the morning, even though I’m perfectly fine. Dad showed up after we got here and had a bloody

Granger asked each person to state their name, department, and what first drew them to their chosen field. Draco’s first instinct was to say something along the lines of
the same way on rats as they do on humans.”
Draco must have drifted to sleep, because the urgent knocking on his door sounded distant at first. And there it was again, loud and impatient against his door. “Come in!” he shouted, sitting up and trying to will himself awake. He looked up at the clock. The doorknob wiggled, and then the knocking resumed.
Oh bollocks, he
He had already considered the far more simple option of asking Hogwarts what they knew about the potion, if they knew anything at all, just like he had asked the Carter Estate. After all, most donations to Hogwarts ended up in a dungeon or a secret room somewhere never to be seen again. It wasn’t like they would
. Draco collapsed onto his soft bed, rolling in a mountain of silken green pillows as he admired the the dark wooden bed posts carved into the shapes of coiling serpents and thick green bed curtains.
“Fine, Hermione. Go to sleep.” Harry closed and locked the door. He pulled out his wand and cast silencing charms around the room before setting his wand on a table.
“No.”
"Let's try this again, Potter," Draco sighed, trying to bring Harry's focus back to the waltz. If Harry stopped looking at him like that, Draco would be less tempted to fall to his knees at Harry's feet and pour his entire heart out. "One, two, and --"

Her eyes shone. “Can we take some back to our common room if we promise not to tell?”

“I think you’re still missing the point about magical strength here, Potter.”
“Oh, Malfoy, c’mon,” Potter tugged at Draco’s sleeve. “Say it. Just once. You know you missed me.” Draco decided that either he also brought out the inner teen-aged boy in Potter, or Potter was perpetually a teen-aged boy. It was too early to tell.
. “Either we share the floor or we share the bed, and the bed is going to be far more comfortable.”

“Because we’re shagging, obviously.” Draco couldn’t resist an opportunity to poke Weasley with a stick, and was rewarded when Weasley looked up at him with a murderous glare. Draco glanced at Potter to make sure he hadn’t crossed a line, but Potter was trying too hard not to laugh to notice.
“To...waltz.” Waltzing would be very counterintuitive to his whole Harry Potter avoidance plan. It would be impossible to avoid Potter if they were
In the morning Draco faced the greatest challenge of his entire career: a classroom of overly energetic eleven year olds. He had taught plenty of Potions courses, to be sure. He had taught at colleges around the world as a way to fulfill grants or make additional income while working on research projects or at dig sites. He had taught children before too; he hardly thought they would have hired him otherwise. But he felt far more at home doing research. His first class had barely started, and he already found himself growing irritated, his energy wearing thin. Had he really been so energetic once? So juvenile?
Harry moved onto the ballroom floor, his hands clenching into nervous fists at his sides as his eyes darted unsteadily around the room. Since Harry wasn’t looking toward the Ministers at the front of the room, it meant that he was probably looking for Lily or Granger. Draco glanced around the edge of the wide circle and found Lily; she was only about a dozen people away from Draco. She was wearing beautiful Gryffindor coloured robes, which would match her father's perfectly if they danced. Draco began pushing his way through the crowd to reach her.
Draco was instantly hard again. With a trembling breath he cautiously resumed sliding his hand up and down his own cock, staring at the outline of Potter’s gliding hand beneath the sheet. He couldn’t help himself; he tried to match Potter’s rhythm. When he saw Potter’s hand increase speed, Draco’s hand increased speed. Then Draco reached a second hand into his pyjamas and began stroking his balls, no longer even trying to control his breathing. Harry followed Draco's lead, pushing a second hand beneath the sheet as well.
“I thought it might.” Lily offered Draco a glimpse inside of the bag she had been carrying. It was
"Look at me, Harry," Draco demanded.
Potter had an erection.
“You didn’t know?” Granger asked, her mouth narrowing into a concerned frown. He simply shook his head. The last he had heard, Potter had made Auror before going off and marrying the Weaslette. Head Auror, possibly. He purposely tried to avoid reading the papers whenever Potter was concerned.
“James!” Potter yelled harshly, flying over to them. “I’ll see no more of

James stepped through the door and into the night. Before Draco could close the door, James reached for his arm. "
“Told you so.”
The first thing Draco had done, when the grant for the Egyptian archaeological dig had ended, was visit Carter’s estate and attempt to track down the vial that Carter had ransacked from the tomb. Even if the vial wasn’t at the estate, and he had doubted it would be, he had at least hoped to acquire more detailed lists of his archaeological discoveries and donations. But this was Havartus E. Carter. Of
“You’re such a Slytherin, Malfoy, honestly.” Weasley rolled his eyes. “Does there have to be a reason for everything?”
“What do you mean?” Draco asked, brushing off his sleeves and picking up his wand.
Draco shook the man’s hand, smiling warmly despite feeling a little stupefied. “Perhaps in time, Mr. Wilson. I’ve a portkey to Cairo in the morning," at this he nodded at Ms. Randhawa. "I need to finish my research, you understand.”

“Professor Malfoy,” she said, coming around her desk. “Welcome back.” He wasn’t sure what he had expected, exactly, but it wasn’t this. It wasn’t warmth. It wasn’t kindness. Apprehensive warmth and kindness, perhaps. Cautious warmth and kindness, to be sure. But everything in her stance implied that she was going to be professional and give him the opportunity to prove himself. He and Granger had never been on good terms, ever, and yet she was welcoming him better than he felt he deserved. “I’m so glad you’ve decided to join us.”

“You actually have someone in your midst who has a great deal of knowledge about Death Eater culture and dark magic, and you would still rather march alone into what is most assuredly a trap.

Granger bit her lip and nodded a little nervously.

“You weren’t here.”

Reluctantly, Draco trailed behind the two other Death Eaters through the palace, supposedly hunting for Potters. They moved through door after door, exploring room after room. Many of the guests had already abandoned the palace interior, and those who remained were either hiding or in the process of fleeing. If Harry had actually

The look in James’ eyes, that bitterness, was vaguely familiar. It reminded him of...well, it reminded him of himself. “Excellent speed, Mr. Potter. Had you actually been focusing on the snitch instead of a chance to send me tumbling to my death, I suspect you would have won the game. Shall we continue?”

Harry smiled weakly as he loosened the tie at his neck. “You take the bed.”
“Well, I-- sort of had assistance. From a house elf.” Draco pulled a strand of long blonde hair over his ear and smiled a little sheepishly at Potter, who smiled back. Potter was sitting in his
Draco sighed.
And then he saw Potter.
When Draco entered the Grand Ballroom, he could barely see the other side of it. The ballroom felt like it was nearly a kilometre long, and it was filled with people. Everyone wore their finest robes. The room shimmered with glamourous fashions and warm smiles. At the far end of the room there were steps leading up to a platform where members of the Ministry sat like kings and queens. Even with all of his practice identifying Harry from a distance on the battlements, he couldn't quite tell if Harry was among them.

“Angelica Randhawa," said the other Ministry member, extending a hand to Harry. "Thank you, Mr. Potter,” she said, “for agreeing to this. Everyone is so
Harry stepped forward, leaning toward Draco’s ear so that Lily couldn’t hear what he was about to say. Feeling Harry's soft, warm breath against his ear and the slightest graze of fabric grazing against his legs was enough to make Draco's toes curl. “The trouble with all of this is, I want
“Then you’d best get to it.” Draco said.
Draco had bristled then, tightening his black leather cuff around his arm. Well, it was more of a gauntlet, really, since it covered his arm from his wrist to just below his elbow. He always wore it over his Dark Mark, ever since the end of the war. He thought that, if he kept it covered, people would forget. He thought that maybe he could start a new life. What a fool he had been. There was no way to escape the past. He had been a Death Eater. He had been a servant of the Dark Lord. He would never truly belong at Hogwarts--not after the terrible things he had done on these same grounds. He would never truly belong anywhere. And he would certainly never capture the attentions of one Harry Potter. Not that he wanted to, of course. Because he despised Potter. Definitely despised him. And how could he have imagined that Potter had been staring at

“My wand.”

“Shut up, Malfoy.” But the words lacked edge. Potter spoke them in the same tone that someone might say:

Finally, Draco looked straight into Potter’s eyes, and then rolled his eyes purposefully toward Granger. Potter bit back another smile as he looked over at Granger, pressing his glasses back up his nose as he re-adjusted his grip on his quill.
had he ever been this happy? Harry was smiling at Draco with that flame back in his eyes, and Draco desperately wanted to lean forward and kiss him. In fact, he decided he would. Draco leaned closer, only to feel Harry panting against his mouth again, moving forward to meet him.
Harry stepped back, his eyes unabashedly gliding from Draco’s face, down his form, to his boots and back up again. There was a glimmer of heat in Harry’s eyes, and then he was

time he had seen Potter dripping with shower water, and it felt like a lifetime ago.
“Is there anything else, Mr. Malfoy, sir?” the house elf asked as Draco surveyed his new home. The room was much larger than he had expected, with a wide bed to the left and a fireplace and sitting area to the right. Toward the back of the room there was a narrow hallway with doors to a small storage room and the bathroom. It was more space than he'd had to himself in over a decade. It was entirely possible, Draco realized with a rush of emotion, that these could have been Snape’s quarters once. ...Except someone had made them extra posh. Draco had become so accustomed to a narrow room or tent shared with one to three other people, that this looked like Malfoy Mansion. And that bed. Silk. So much silk. He had spent the latter half of his life sleeping on some version of a stiff bunk with rough linen sheets, and now that bed looked like actual heaven. Draco waited until the elf disappeared with a
And Draco did. He told Granger all about Siberia. He told her about the research facility in the mountains, about the digsite near Lake Baikal, about their significant discovery of ancient potions ingredients. He was genuinely surprised by how easy she was to talk to. She listened openly, and asked questions that encouraged him to talk further. Talking with Granger brought a surprising level of relief. He knew, now, that this was as good a time as any. It was better to have Granger in on his plan, more or less, than to have Potter discover him snooping around the castle again.
And he was just, oh, you know, openly eye-fucking Potter. At a faculty meeting. Nothing to see there. He swallowed, ripping his eyes from Potter as he looked nervously at Granger, who was silently looking back and forth between them. “Please, continue,” Draco said, his voice far too high-pitched as he folded his hands on the table.
“Good.” Potter kissed James’ forehead. “I’ll be back in a little while.”
James Potter gripped his wand and faced the Death Eaters, grinding his teeth.
James just rolled his eyes. “Why are you even watching him anyway?”

time.” Potter pressed his cheekbone against Malfoy’s jaw and breathed a short little exhale, as if all of the breath was being squeezed from his lungs, and then inhaled deeply. Draco gently nipped Potter’s earlobe and leaned back, taking in the hazy look in Potter’s eyes, the slight part of his mouth. Draco found that he wanted to kiss that mouth. He
Harry cleared his throat and stepped forward, taking one of Draco’s hands in his while tucking the other around Draco's waist. And there was that stupid golden heat, burning between their hands. It was maddeningly distracting. The last time Draco had felt that heat, he had been naked on a tile floor with the man who was now so busy
"Er...well," Harry's eyes locked onto Draco's, and it did terrible things to his insides. "Not

As Halloween approached, the students were noticeably gleeful, which meant even more botched potions than usual. Draco found himself detracting points from Houses left and right. ...Except for Slytherin, of course. Slytherin students were always the height of academic excellence. And Lily Luna. She was always smiling brightly, and saying, “Yes Professor Malfoy,” and “No, Professor Malfoy,” and he found that he hadn’t the heart to detract points from her even when she spilled her cauldron while attempting a Cure for Boils. This, of course, turned out to be a mistake, because when she smilingly asked for help on her next potion, two of her Gryffindor friends placed a croaking pinecone on Draco’s chair. She was sneaky. Smiley and sneaky and just as adventurously mischievous as every Gryffindor in existence. ...Except worse, because she hid perfectly under the guise of innocence until it was too late. And even then, he hadn’t detracted any points, because her cunning was so...well,
“Anything you’d like to talk about?”

that broke the morning stillness. Draco looked up at the ceiling, trying to regain his vision. His equilibrium. Trying to figure out what the fuck he had done wrong. It was practically Cornelius all over again. Last night, Harry had been purring and warm and curled on top of him. Now, he looked like something else entirely. Something almost frightening.
“I’d rather not.”
. Draco stared at his Mark, willing it to life.
“Well then,” she said, sliding Draco’s tea toward him and folding her hands around her teacup. Draco tensed, waiting for her to begin lecturing him about why we don’t apparate failed potions onto students’ pillows, but was pleasantly surprised when she simply said, “Tell me about Siberia.”
Draco repeated the question, a little louder this time.
“One of you had to have touched it first.”
with the express intention of avoiding Potter’s stupid face.
He wasn’t sure why, but something possessed him to drop everything he was doing in that instant and run back to the caravan. When he threw open the door, he saw Cornelius sitting at the kitchen table, blinking up at him in the sunlight. “Morning, Draco,” he said without looking up. “Forget something?”
Then the door creaked open behind him and Potter crept in. Granger stopped talking, allowing Potter to walk around the entire room to sit in his usual seat across from Draco.

Draco arrived a little early for the meeting on Friday and found the usual cliques of chatting colleagues standing outside of the door. Granger and Weasley were already seated inside, talking quietly.
After they had crossed the moat and were well outside of hearing range from anyone near the castle, Potter muttered, “I can handle this myself, Malfoy.”
Potter apparently lacked this skill.

to lift Potter through the door and float him gently back to his bedroom floor, trying desperately not to stare at Potter’s shapely bum in the process.

“I’ll handle it.”
“My, this
“Yes.”
Draco stared at the bed. He stared out the window. They were fairly high up, and had a beautiful view of London. He had spent a lot of time in London when he was younger. There had been so many parties, so many social events, so many opportunities for political intrigue. He almost missed it, he realized. He'd been running for so long that he had never stopped to think about how much he actually missed certain elements of his past.
After James’ initial reaction to Draco's supposed love for Harry on the battlements, Draco never thought James would actually
family.”
“This is ridiculous, Malfoy.”
Draco retreated from the bathroom and closed the door. Loudly. He had intended to wait until he was at least in the privacy of the shower before he began wanking, but the second sight of Potter had pushed him too far. He leaned against the bathroom door and could practically hear Potter soaping himself. He dug his hand into his trousers and pulled himself off right there in their hotel room. When he finished, he cast a shameful cleaning charm and stared hopelessly at the ceiling.
hands this time, and pulled them back into that tiny, dark broom closet. “Do you have any idea what your female hatchling said to me today? She strongly implied, or may as well have said...”
“I don’t even remember who started it, if it was Neville or Ginny or--”
“There's something I need to say.”

was enough. And Draco found himself wanting to be pulled into it.
Eventually though, Cornelius discovered that Draco was a former Death Eater and it had all gone up in smoke. He didn’t even give Draco the courtesy of a break-up note. When Draco woke up after their first night together, the caravan was empty. Cornelius had taken his things and apparated to who-knows-where. Draco never saw him again.
“No, really, you actually wear that to sleep?” Malfoy said, leaning through the wardrobe for a better look.
...Then why was this so hard? Why was there such a tightness swelling up in his throat? Why did he feel like he was being ripped open and
Draco heard himself take a breath as he felt his chest tighten. He stumbled back, turned away from Potter, and faced the wall. There was only one person who could have possibly done such a thing, because there was only one person with whom he'd shared a night since he left the country. There was only one person he knew (besides Rita Skeeter, of course) who was notorious for writing gossipy freelance articles for the
“Good. I’ll send one along.”
Potter's breathing changed.
Longbottom crouched near Draco's face. "You'll find all the time you need in Azkaban."
He feared that the Potter compartment of his brain was completely, irreparably destroyed, threatening to never pack itself away again.
Draco groaned and walked over to the door. “It’s nearly midnight,” he muttered to whoever was on the other side. “Do you have any idea--”
Potter stood in his doorway, attached to Lily this time instead of James. His robes weren't fastened, revealing a navy t-shirt and jeans that were, thankfully, lacking holes. Draco swallowed. He had successfully avoided close proximity with Harry for
His time at Hogwarts was over.
“Oh. Er--I guess you drew the short straw then?” Potter glanced nervously sideways. Draco followed Potter’s gaze to see Weasley, who was waiting for their shots and grinning like this was the funniest fucking thing he had ever seen in his life.
Flora flushed a bright pink, and stared down at her desk.
“Just open the door!” Potter yelled.
and no one is around to help?”
"Draco," Harry whined. His dark brows furrowed as he breathed heavily and unevenly through his nose.
Draco dropped to Harry’s side and pulled Harry into his lap. “Harry,” he whispered. "I'm here." Harry’s tidy hair had come loose, and Draco brushed the wild strands away. “Harry? Look at me.” Harry wearily looked up at Draco. “Hi,” Draco smiled, and Harry returned it weakly. "You just couldn't resist running
Maybe Draco should say something. He could get up, and leave, and go find Potter, and make sure that everything was okay.
“Is she alright?”
He wasn’t sure what he had expected, but he certainly hadn’t expected
Draco turned around to see that Potter had gotten distracted by a poster on the wall, and was now walking back toward the bar, seemingly oblivious to what had just transpired, the charming, brainless twit. It was probably just the alcohol imitating the feeling of anticipation and desire in his gut. And his mind was only pretending that Potter was the most gorgeous creature he had ever seen in his fucking life, in preparation for what he was about to do. His stomach clenched as he watched Harry approach, pushing a wild lock of dark hair out of his eyes.
Draco was in the midst of running past a room when he heard cackling voices coming from inside. He abruptly stopped, his fancy boots sliding a little along the smooth palace floors, and then doubled back into the room.
When Draco arrived at the Muggle station, he sidled his way down a hall and, when no Muggles were looking, he stepped through the wall into the portkey station. Gripping his ticket in his hand, he walked into the station's main waiting room. The room contained rows of long, red cushioned benches and a large desk in the center. Two sides of the room opened into two long hallways, where objects of every variety lined the walls. Draco walked down one of the halls until he found his portkey. He touched it.
Draco shook his head. “You arsehole. You beautiful, brilliant arsehole.” Draco swallowed. “You know, I realized something. Earlier tonight.”
“I--” James pouted and looked across the lawn, as though Potter were still out there, patrolling the grounds.
Draco tried to loosen his fingers on Harry’s head, but they wouldn’t move. He hadn’t the willpower. “Close,” he managed to say, not recognizing his own voice. Harry pulled his hand from Draco’s arse and began massaging the sensitive sacks of flesh at the base of Draco’s cock, as if encouraging Draco to continue. Draco whined with pleasure as he continued to thrust. “Harry, I'm--

“How about you, Weasley?”
The crowd was already thinning, and those who remained were cowering near the edges of the room until they could flee through the doors. Something must have happened to the Aurors that were guarding the ballroom; that was the only explanation as to why no one was rushing in to protect Harry.
The room was spinning, and Draco just closed his eyes and laid down in the middle of the floor. Why had he thought this was a good idea? Why had he decided to do something so reckless and irresponsible? It was so...well, it was so
Harry hummed and adjusted, digging his fingers into Draco's thighs as he dragged them over his shoulders until Draco was arching sharply off the bed, supported by his silk pillows. “Draco Malfoy thinks I’m brilliant?” Harry pressed his nose against Draco's scrotum and then explored further, flicking his tongue teasingly down Draco's crack. "Hmm?" Harry hummed, parting Draco's cheeks enough to circle his tongue lightly around Draco's arsehole.
“Lucky me,” Draco said, smoothing the robe over his scars before anyone could see and fastening the belt just as Weasley stumbled into his bedroom.  “The gang’s all here.”
About halfway through the task, a scuffle was developing in the back corner of the room. Draco wandered toward the noise to investigate.
“Thanks, Granger,” Draco said, offering his hand. "I really appreciate it."
. For them, love was enough. For them,
“If you heard
“Never,” Draco agreed, kissing Harry’s temple.
Draco gripped his father’s bedpost to support himself. He saw the portrait of his father as a young man hanging on the wall, and then glanced away only to see himself in his father’s mirror. A small sob escaped him, and he finally stopped trying to fight his emotions. He curled up on his father’s bed and allowed himself to
“Oh, you know. The one. ‘My Night with a Death Eater’ or some nonsense.”

“Potter,” Draco whispered, wrapping his other hand around the fabric at Potter’s wrist, squeezing his fingers tightly against Potter’s shirt as he felt the pressure building up again. He looked Potter straight in the eyes, hoping his own eyes looked as desperate as he felt. “
. Draco stopped, clenching his teeth and fighting the growing tension in his throat. He suddenly missed his parents so much he couldn't breathe.
Well that sounded promising. A door to youth, perhaps?
In fact, Draco was still guzzling his pumpkin juice, staring blissfully at the starry ceiling, when the doors to the Great Hall slammed open. Malfoy nearly choked, and as he looked toward the door it took all of his good breeding to not spit pumpkin juice all over the table. There, standing silhouetted against the light of the hallway and looking more disheveled than ever, was Harry James Potter.
“Er.” Potter scratched the side of his jaw. “Right.” Potter looked up at the open door in the ceiling above them. “So!” Potter breathed, his voice high-pitched. “...I didn’t know potions could cast magic like this.”
. That had always been the plan.
Draco continued reading and discovered that Ginny had met Potter for lunch one afternoon while Potter was at work. A Dark Curse presumably intended for Potter hit his wife instead. Or maybe it
“Yeah?”
“Hmm.” Granger bit her lip. “What did you say the ingredients were?”

Draco nodded. He still remembered the castle as clearly as if he had only left it yesterday. When he stepped inside the Potions classroom, Draco inhaled and was instantly filled with nostalgia. It was a smell he didn’t even realize he had missed--half-burned potions and misfired spells, layered with that distinctly unique Hogwarts scent of pumpkin spice and woodsmoke against cool stone.

All of a sudden, a woman he had never seen before in his life walked right up to Potter and leaned her head over his left shoulder.
a Dark Mark--not a real one, anyway. The other half, however, was older. Draco vaguely recognized some of them. During the war they had been amateurs, but that didn’t mean they weren’t incredibly dangerous
