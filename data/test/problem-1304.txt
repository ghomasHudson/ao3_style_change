“I have no idea Harry. But don’t worry after everything is cleared up today we will be sending all of this to Ministry so they can start an investigation in everything that is going on” Mdm. Longbottom said reassuringly. It was illegal to ignore a parent’s will. She is so glad now that she is still alive to give Neville the life he deserved. Just imagining someone ignoring Franks and Alice’s will is a horrifying thought. And it turned out that Peter Pettigrew was the secret keeper and not Sirius Black? This would mean that an innocent man spend 14 years in Azkaban, the horror! She would make sure a trial was organized as soon as possible to clear this all up.
Seeing as Ryan and Ethan had already started opening their presents with excitement, Harry started opening his presents that he had gotten from the Snapes. Opening several packages, Harry received some additional books on his heirships, a new wandholdster, several beautiful dress robes, some candy and quidditch tickets for this summer.
“This unicorn is the only female in the group. She is also the mother of the 2 little ones.” Said Professor Moonlight pointing to the unicorn closes to the smaller ones.
Giving a small laugh, Harry replied, “I can admit you were correct, but not all the Weasleys are bad. Some are still my friends. But if you mean the two youngest, then yes. After what they did to me they should be happy I am not sewing them yet,” fumed Harry, the anger he was feeling bleeding through in his last words.
If Harry was really honest with himself, he never gave sexuality a real thought. Besides the Cho and the Triwizard ball last year he never had the time to think about these things. He was always so busy with Voldemort and all the trouble that seemed to find him. And now thinking about it, Harry was not sure if he liked girls that much. Even last year with Cho, it felt more like an obligation or an expectation of him than something he really wanted to do.
I know it has been some time, but life gets sometimes in the way. I will be continuing, but the time between updates can sometimes be long. Sorry for this! I am graduating university and starting my first actual job in a couple of weeks, so it has difficult finding the time to write.
"He also mentioned that he never told us about you because he wanted to keep you out of the war. So why are you making yourself known now?"
Walking forward was a boy looking almost like a copy of professor Snape, except the nose and eyes. He had silky black hair and brown eyes.
“Lord and Lady Malfoy,” replied Harry, shaking Lord Malfoy’s hand and kissing Lady Malfoy’s as Serena had taught him.
“I was mainly put in my cupboard without food, but one-time Aunt Petunia hit me with a cooking pan.”
“Before looking into this further I want Dumbledore removed as his magical guardian and a new one appointed. I am almost certain that Lily and James Potter didn’t appoint Dumbledore as his guardian. But besides that, Dumbledore has shown himself unfit to be mister Potter's magical guardian since he is unaware of his status and he has been denied the appropriate education.” stated Mdm. Longbottom taking charge in this mess. So many things were coming out that Harry had no idea anymore about what was going on. Looking at Neville it was clear that even he had no idea anymore what was happening.
In other words, Harry now understood that he was at a huge disadvantage, by not being aware that these meetings were being held. Even worse Neville told him it was a great offense when you did not attend. This only made sorting everything out as fast as possible more important.
Turning around Severus Snape approach Harry, “We are leaving now” he stated while turning around and walking towards the apparition point. “Please hold on to my arm and don’t let go. I will be apparating us home” Harry did as he was told and with a “pop” they were both gone.
There is also a section on shares and investments. This will state the number of shares you have in a particular business and how much money you are either earning or losing based on that share. In case you sell or buy new shares, or if there is a big change in your earnings or losses this will be mentioned in the beginning of the bank statements under “changes”,” explained Severus.
Looking at Ethan, Harry replied, “To be honest I never hated Severus. But from the moment I entered Hogwarts he hated my guts, would give me detentions whenever he could. But this past semester I think for the first time he is giving me a chance. Being here for Christmas, it is the first time I know how it feels to be part of a family and I am not sure if I will be able to go back to how things were before.”
Finally decided he went to Professor McGonagall and asked to take the class. He was given his ordering form and was told that the first class was tomorrow morning.
“Watch your tone, and we can and we will. If we do it or not is up to you, Quidditch is a privilege and not a right.” Stated Severus clearly.
“Well, he would get presents for holidays and birthdays. I also only got his cast downs, clothes, toys, They would also take him on holidays and leave me with Mrs. Figg.”
“Yeah, I have known him my whole life. I personally think that after you apologize and act like you are supposed to he will at least be civil with you. He told me about your rejection in first year, and Harry, that was extremely rude. No wonder he doesn’t like you.”
The next day Harry woke up refreshed. He must have been very tired since for once he didn’t have any nightmares, not that he was complaining. Making is way down to the dining room he greeted everyone before starting his breakfast.
“Miss Lovegood, do you maybe know why Ryan has no friends? I mean you are in the same house?” asked Snape and he really looked desperate to know the answer of what was wrong with his son.
“Today I will be going over the basic knowledge of what your status is and all the duties you will hold when you become a full Lord. We will also go through any basic questions you have today. Tomorrow Serena has volunteered to give you etiquette lessons so you have at least one more week to get used to it before you are attending the balls. The day after tomorrow we will start going over your account statements. You will also start to receive your account statements from Gringotts. I expect you to read them at breakfast and at certain points in time I will be asking you questions about what is happening. This means Harry that if you do not understand something you immediately ask me so that I can explain it to you.”
“Wait for a second, there was never a will reading of Lily and James Potter. We all thought that there was no will,” proclaimed Mdm. Longbottom.
“I have no idea. I don’t see him anywhere, do you think maybe Malfoy was right and Hagrid was fired?” said Ron, also looking to the staff table.
“A block on his magic? Compulsion charms?” Mdm. Longbottom almost shouted in anger. “Yes madam, we sadly enough do not know who has placed these charms on him, but we assure you that each one of them has been removed. I do have to tell you mister Potter, that it is ill advised to use your magic for the next three days. Your magic and body have to get used to functioning without these spells and potions in your system.” Ripclaw stated, leaving no room for argument.
When Hermione and Ron started talking again, Harry quickly dismissed the thought. The rest of the train ride went without a hitch.
The rest of the evening went smoothly. One hour before curfew the Snapes decided to send the kids back to their common rooms.
“We understand that Harry, but you might try explaining that to Draco and see what happens. Who knows, maybe you will become the best of friends.”
“Good to know you have come to your senses. Now, are you not supposed to direct me somewhere?” Trying to remind Harry of the proper protocol.
“If any of these rules are broken this can result in privileges being taken away. If we see that your studies are not receiving enough of your attention you will be banned from playing Quidditch.”
Seeing that Harry really did not know, Draco decided to inform him, “Harry, I am gay. Which means most likely my mate will not be female.
“Mr. Potter I have heard that you and your friend, Miss. Lovegood, are friends with my son Ethan. Because of that my husband and I would like to invite you two to have dinner with us next week Saturday. Would you want to come?” asked Professor Moonlight.
At the end of the hallway, a lady was sitting doing a huge amount of paperwork with one of the magical quills. She was medium build with blue eyes and dirty blond hair that curled over her back. She was probably somewhere in her twenties and Harry assumed she was trying to work her way up by starting in the front office.
Looking at the time Severus decided to call it a day. “It is almost time for dinner, so we will stop here for today. Don’t forget to start reading your books when you have time.” Taking out a book from another shelf Severus handed it to Harry saying. “As a Lord, it is also necessary for you to learn occlumency, or mind arts. This is very hard, so I want you to read the entire book and start with meditating every night to try to clear your mind.” Said Severus before leaving.
“Do not speak to me and keep your mouth shut about things that do not concern you, blood traitor. And Potter, keep this up and you will not know what hit you when you leave Hogwarts. Your ‘Boy Who Lived’ fame won’t last forever.” said Malfoy.
"You mean the silent girl from Ravenclaw? I thought she moved away after graduating?" asked Filius Flitwick.
“Were you able to read through some of your bank statements?” asked Severus, while grabbing the original bank statements and laying them in front of him.
“Don’t tell me that the Malfoys are coming over for Christmas? Please don’t tell me Draco Malfoy will be here,” said Harry, already fearing the answer.
“It is quite simple, you need to place one drop of your blood on this paper and then tap it once with your wand,” Ripclaw explained handing over the paper. Taking it Harry did what was asked. This time it took almost 5 minutes before something started to appear on the paper.
“Well Sir” said Luna, almost afraid of answering the question, “some of the older students warned the new kids about you. Others have siblings who talked about you and well. Nobody wants to be friends with someone whose father is seen as evil.”
“This is the best way to do that,” replied Severus while taking out a parchment and quill to start writing a notification to the goblins. After finishing he folded it up and looked at Harry. “I am not entirely sure, but there is a chance that the Weasleys will be notified that the marriage contract will be broken.”
“Severus mentioned the horrible things they had done to you. If you need help bringing them to justice, feel free to ask. Maybe Severus did not mention this, but I am also a qualified magical attorney.”
“Who knows, maybe you do end up with Pansy,” teased Harry. He could already imagine the new ‘Mrs. Malfoy’. What Harry did not expect was the whole room to start laughing at him.
“You can see that she is female because her horn is smaller than the horn of the male unicorns. The little ones are almost four years old; you can see that there horn starts to peak out. Until a unicorn reaches the age of seven the parents and male family members never leave them alone. Because unicorns life that long there are not many born. Until the age of seven, they are vulnerable to be captured. Now all of you can come closer and touch the older unicorns. Another big misunderstanding about unicorns is, that only young girls can touch them. This was seen as a common rule, when a few unicorns preferred the touch of the girls present. This happened because unicorns are attracted to the purest person present at a time, which in most cases are girls. One more rule before you can go near them is only touching the young ones if you have gotten permission. You get permission by bowing to the mother if she then touches your forehead with her horn you can go and touch them. If she does not, do not go near them.” Said Professor Moonlight.
While sitting there, Harry’s mind easily wondered to what had happened in the past few days. The day after they arrived home from the Ministry, an owl had come carrying a letter with the Ministry seal. Opening the letter, it informed them that the Dursleys were deemed unfit. As a result, he would now be placed under the temporary guardianship of Severus and Serena until a decision was made concerning a permanent guardian.
While awaiting the answer of his grandmother, Neville had taken it upon himself to introduce Harry to some basic ‘pureblood’ knowledge. One thing that had really surprised Harry was when Neville mentioned that most purebloods actually have some creature blood in them. This apparently results in many purebloods receiving a creature inheritance when they reach the age of 16. This would mean that everyone of their year, who has enough creature blood, would receive their inheritance this year. Neville told him that next semester many students would receive some extra days off around their birthday to accommodate this. Annoyingly Neville could not tell Harry if he would be receiving anything, as most families did not share this information with just anyone.
“Since we are limited in time, we will only be going through the Potter accounts today. Tomorrow you can test how much you understand, by going through the Black accounts by yourself. You should have enough knowledge after today to at least understand the majority of the information. I will be expecting a report tomorrow night of the Black accounts so I can review how much you understand and what areas we will need to go over again,” said Severus.
But even after this Harry still had quite a pile of presents and letters left. Deciding just to go for it, Harry saw that the next present had a letter attached, so decided to start with that.
After their wands were registered Severus led Harry to one of the elevators. The funny thing is that in the wizarding world the elevators don’t only go up and down but also sideways and diagonally. The elevator ride didn’t take that long as soon “Department of wizarding children” was called out and they exited into a nicely lit hallway.
Seeing the cake attached Harry threw it away not trusting there not to be any potions and opened the next letter.
Time had flown by and it was 3 weeks until Christmas break. As always, Harry was staying at Hogwarts. This year though he was the only one. Ron was going home, because his brother Bill was returning home and Hermione was going on a holiday with her parents.
While there is of course a lot more information Harry needs to know about this, Neville said it could wait. Currently, there is other information that should take precedent. He finally got his explanation concerning what these summer heir meetings were all about. At the age of 14, each person with an inheritance is invited to Gringotts to do the so-called ‘heir test’. This test will determine which houses someone is heir to and if there are any lordship positions available. While as a minor you are not yet qualified to be lord, you will still get the name. Officially they call them lord apparent. Since Neville’s parents are not available he became lord apparent to the most Ancient and Noble house of Longbottom.
“Uhm, no…” Harry sighed, sitting down. He was feeling really depressed now. After almost 5 years in the wizarding world, he had hoped that he knew most general things. But here again, he was feeling like the small eleven year old that heard about magic for the first time.
There are of course several cases of child abuse, but those were often in families were one of the parents were muggles. Not all muggles are bad of course, but many don’t understand the magic and don’t know how to deal with a child who has it. This often leads to cases of neglect and sometimes to severe abuse, where parents try to beat the magic out of them.
As usual, the Great Hall was nicely lit and people could see the stars through the roof. Harry and his friends quickly seated themselves at the Gryffindor table.
“Wait a minute do I not get any say in this. Not to be disrespectful, but why can I not stay with Neville?” Harry said sounding really confused. So much had happened in such a short time that he did not know what to do anymore.
“Uhm, yeah. Uncle Lucius is Lucius Malfoy,” said Ethan, looking like he didn’t understand what was the problem.
Looking at Mdm. Hawks and then at Severus, Harry decided “I will give you my memories if Severus is the one to extract them. I only trust him.”
“No, no, I mean your magical guardian, muggles cannot sole guardians of wizards. For muggle-borns, their head of house is their temporary guardian. And what do you mean you have never received owls?” Neville asked surprised. How could Harry not know about all of this? Of course, Harry had a magical guardian. It would have been impossible to attend Hogwarts otherwise since they needed someone to contact in case something happened. Since muggles could not enter Hogwarts, this created the absolute need for a magical one.
“Well, I think that was everything important for today. I would advise you to read all the details in your bank statements to get a better idea of everything that is yours. If something is unclear feel free to come to ask me about it. You now also know enough information to go through the Black bank statements. As you are still just an heir there is very little you can change about them. Even so, I would advise you to at least look into the parts concerning active contracts and shares and investments.”
After classes, Harry decided to go to the lake to relax a bit. Hermione was with Ron in the library explaining some homework.
“You and Severus will also be going to the ministry by the end of the week to look into your home situation and to see if your relatives are fit to keep custody over you.” Said Serena. “If you have no more questions, you can go and start on your holiday homework. After lunch, Severus will start your first lessons.”
“That is true” Mdm. Longbottom said thinking about a possible solution. If no one appropriate was assigned, they would need to go to the Ministry. The ministry would then be allowed to appoint anyone that they found would qualify.
“You said before that all the Wizengamot seats are decided based on the lordships. Does this mean that muggle-borns and some half-bloods are never able to be seated there?” asked Harry, no wonder a lot of people looked down on muggle-borns if they never had any say to begin with.
“Yeah, just extremely confused. Malfoy mentioned something about me being a lord and something about not showing up this summer. Any idea what he is talking about?” Harry asked nervously. During his walk-up it went through Harry’s thoughts that maybe Malfoy had made the whole thing up, just to confuse him more. But then again, thinking about the way Malfoy said it, it sounded too real. For one minute he thought about just asking Ron, but he could already imagine his reaction. He would probably go on a tirade about how awful Malfoy is and never get an answer. Plus Neville is a pureblood even though Harry often forgets this.
“My problem is that you seem not to care about our world at all. You didn’t even bother to show up this summer. You might be a lord, but you are no better than us. Even Longbottom had the decency to show up.” Malfoy told him off. Really Potter needs it spelled out why every pureblood is offended? And it's not just the Slytherins, all the purebloods from every house were shocked this summer when they noticed Potter did not take the time to show up. At the first meeting we all thought that maybe there was an issue, but after not showing up for the other four meetings everyone realized he was not going to come. It is really insulting that everyone else takes the time to come, but Potter does not even notify the ministry that he would not attend.
“It only happened when they were really angry. They mostly locked me up inside my cupboard without food. They tried not touching me, my freakiness my be contagious.”
“Thank you, Mal..Draco. Please call me Harry. I hope we can start over again?” hesitated Harry, often looking at the flour. He was not quite sure how to handle this situation. Everything was going a lot better than he had anticipated. There had been no insults or fights, so Harry took this as a bonus.
“Yes, my aunt and uncle on my mother’s side, but I am currently staying with Severus for Christmas,” answered Harry.
The second reason is that to create a child a part of parents' magic is used and provided for the child while it grows. This makes it very hard for most to produce more than three to four children. Most couples have to already stop after two. By spreading out the lordships it provides more chances of one lordship going to one child and as such preventing the merging of lordships.
“I am calling them what they are, Potter. Maybe you should look it up if you don’t understand.” Malfoy sighed. Did Potter really not know that they had officially been declared blood traitors by the ministry after they were convicted a few generations ago? I mean everyone in the wizarding world knows what it means when someone is declared a blood traitor. He did have to acknowledge that the oldest Weasley siblings had distanced themselves from the disgrace that was brought on their families before. There were even rumors that the oldest Weasley was being courted by a veela. Maybe they are on the road to redemption.
After saying goodbye to everyone, Harry also walked back towards his common room. He couldn’t stop thinking about what Snape, now Severus had said. He did understand. The Golden Boy everyone saw him as was not really who he was. He did not like having the pressure on him and people dying around him. Could it truly be that there were others who also wore a mask? Could it be people he knew? Could it be is friend and enemies? These were the questions that kept going around in his head while trying to fall asleep.
“Yes, thank you for coming and I wish you all the best in life, Mr. Potter. Happy holidays,” Mdm Hawks replied before both Harry and Severus stood up and left.
Going through the Gringotts file on her desk, “If, as I believe, your current guardians are deemed unfit you will have till May to decide who you would prefer as your new guardian. This Department would prefer someone that was appointed by your parents' will, which is Lord Snape-Prince, Mdm. Tonks, Mdm. Bones or Lord Malfoy. As Lord Prince is already your magical guardian we would probably prefer that option.
Taking a seat at the table, Harry made sure to take the one furthest away from Snape, placing him in-between Luna and Ethan. During dinner they talked about random stuff between each other. In the meanwhile, Snape and Professor Moonlight talked between themselves.
He was glad that Luna and professor Moonlight would be there. That would probably ease some of the tension. Still, every time the words “dinner with Snape” went through his head, he wanted to run back to the Gryffindor common room.
“We would like to speak with the Potter account manager, have a full investigation in the Potter vault, and an heir test for mister Harry Potter here” Mdm. Longbottom replied clearly.
“As I understand everyone of you has dropped Care of Magical Creatures for this year. Since the school board has decided that this is mainly because of Hagrid, some new rules apply. Since there is a new teacher it was decided that it would be allowed to sign up even though the due date has passed. The ones that want to make use of this option will be given an order paper to be sent by owl for Flourish and Blotts so that they are able to order their book for the course.” announced Professor McGonagall.
“You have to see it differently. When a female marries, she comes under the house of her husband. There are three reasons why women cannot inherit. The first is that you cannot split up most houses. For example, the Black lordship can only go to one person. While there are some trust vaults for the other members-only one can hold the lordship. In the case that females could also inherit you could get cases of the oldest, being female, and her husband having to deal with 2 lordships. Furthermore, they would also have to have two children to pass it on to. On the other hand, you could have her younger brother and his wife not having any lordships to pass on.
The next step happens when they reach the age of 15. They all are assigned a current lord or proxy to their house. In most cases this is a parent or grandparent. In case no one in the immediate family is available their magical guardian steps in. This also means that future lords have to have a lord as their magical guardian. During their training they are invited to observe the Wizengamot meetings whenever possible. More crucial are the 5 mandatory group sessions during the summer. These meetings will provide the standard knowledge about being a lord. More importantly this provides the perfect opportunity for youngsters to create business connections with each other away from the prejudices of Hogwarts. These meetings are also open to anyone who is to become lord of a British house, which means attendance of students not attending Hogwarts. These meetings are spread across a total of 3 years. While the ‘classes’ are separate, the interactions are not, allowing students to make acquaintances with 5 different age categories (including their own).
With a ‘pop’ both Harry and professor Snape arrived at the outskirts of a huge manor. Without saying anything professor Snape started walking towards the entrance of the manor. With no other choice, Harry followed a few steps behind.
Seeing he would not get any answers, Sirius decided to leave but not before threatening Dumbledore, “If I find out you had anything to do with this, you can find yourself a new Headquarters and don’t forget that I am a Black. We always get our revenge.”
Arriving at Diagon Alley, Harry, Neville, and Mdm. Longbottom quickly made their way towards Gringotts. Mdm. Longbottom had made an appointment ahead of time, so they were directly led to one of the meeting rooms.
Seeing that Ethan was about to protest, Severus quickly gave him a look daring him to interrupt before continuing, “Harry will be spending most of his time learning about his new status and catching up with the classes he missed during the summer. He will need to learn a lot more than you will need to learn Ethan because Harry did not grow up in this world. That means that things that might seem obvious to you might be completely new for Harry.”
“Lord Snape-Prince has told us that there are reasons why your current guardians are unfit to care for you. As you understand we cannot just believe his word, which is why you are here today. I will be asking you several questions about your current living conditions and your guardians. All you need to do is answer truthfully, nothing more.” Mdm. Hawks started explaining the procedure.
“Well, that would be all, for now, mister Potter. We will be sending your previous bank statements to your guardian as soon as possible and after that, they will be sent out monthly.” Ripclaw said. Looking towards Severus Snape he asked, “would you also want us to send the heir copies to misted Potter?” Nodding his head Severus Snape replied, “that would be preferable, yes.” After nodding his head and writing something down Ripclaw turned towards Harry. “Would you want us to charge all fees of today to the Potter vault?” After looking at Severus Snape, Harry nodded his head replying, “Yes good idea”.
“We will begin today with the more practical skills and leave this afternoon for the rest. As you have already been informed you will be attending the Yule ball next week, which means you don’t have that much time to hone your skills.” She started leading Harry to the now empty dining room.
Looking up Severus was surprised by Harry’s exclamation. “Harry, it is not abnormal for pure-blood families to have a marriage contract for their children, especially the heir.”
Ethan was dressed in silver dress robes with a black trimming, which was the opposite of the dress robes that Severus was wearing for tonight. On his left chest side, Harry recognized the Prince emblem, showing that he was the Prince heir. The same emblem could be found on Severus’ dress robes, but then on the right side.
“With your permission mister Potter, we can do a preliminary hearing of the will. After this is all completed all receiving parties will then be invited for the official reading later this week” said Ripclaw looking expectantly at Harry.
“Harry, I will probably not have enough time today to teach you everything, so I expect you to improve and work on this in your own time. I understand that you have a lot of work, but your first appearance will be scrutinized since you already offended most people.” Started Serena, going into lecture mode.
But then the impossible happened. While he was talking Snape actually smiled! Snape had just smiled at someone.
Having gotten the confirmation of Harry, Severus attached both his letter and a copy of the marriage contract to the leg of his owl and sends it off. Seeing the big and completely black owl flying to its destination Harry turned back to his bank statements.
“Wait but I am not related to Sirius,” Harry said, suddenly realizing that fact. “How did I then receive the Black lordship?”
“Sirius, my boy, it is probably the Daily Prophet writing rubbish again,” said Dumbledore calmly while picking up the paper. While reading the first few paragraphs Dumbledore’s expressions turned to shock then anger, before he was able to cover it up. While most Order members in attendance did not see anything, Sirius was another matter. Having focused on Dumbledore he saw the emotion change and wondered how much of the information in the paper was correct.
Turning the page to the next file, Harry noticed it was a personal contract between James Potter and Remus Lupin, Sirius Black, and Peter Pettigrew. Since his father was no longer alive the contract had turned a light blue, but weirdly it had not gone dark like the other no longer valid contracts.
“I’m fine. I even made a new friend. Harry, I want to introduce you to my friend Ethan Snape. Ethan this is Harry Potter.” said Luna.
“It is planned for tomorrow, I want you to be on your best behavior,” replied Severus, “We will first look into your guardian situation. Once that is handled we will have to check if no contracts have been made in your name that you need to honor.”
Not long after the Malfoys decided to go home as it was already some time past midnight. Overall Harry was surprised the evening went better than expected. The Malfoys were not so bad ones they accepted you and Harry got to know them more. Harry never expected to say this but he was actually relieved that Draco would be at the Greengrass Christmas Ball tomorrow. Harry felt quite confident that Draco had accepted him, and at least would not create any trouble for him tomorrow. Saying Draco had his back, well Harry first had to see that before he believed it.
Unfortunately for Harry the discussion about the Yule ball also led to dance classes. Once Serena noticed that Harry was absolutely horrible at dancing she immediately tried to rectify this issue. Harry would not be able to go to a Yule ball without the bare minimum of dancing skills.
Getting upset the longer he read the letter, Harry stood up and threw it in the fireplace. Seeing it burn gave him some satisfaction. Deciding why not, he went back and picked up the letters from Ron, Mrs Weasley and Ginny and also threw them in.
Due to several requests, I have decided that the next chapters will be longer. This also means that it will take a longer time for me to update. Let me know what you think.
“Yes, I read that here. You staying with Lord Snape-Prince is no issue as he is your magical guardian. Since we did not place you, we were wondering if you had any idea how you ended up at their home?”
“That is why we are here, my grandson discovered that mister Potter is not aware of anything he should be aware of as the lord apparent of the House of Potter. And for some reason the owls from the Ministry for the summer heir classes also did not reach him.” added Mdm. Longbottom.
“Well, the Prince name comes from my mother's side of the family. During my Hogwarts years and my potions mastery, I was known as Severus Snape and as such most of my potion mastery achievements are documented under that name. Since my grandfather did not have any other heirs when he died, and my father did not have a lordship, the Prince lordship was given to me. While I was allowed to change the name when I took the lordship, I never felt the need to. Since I don’t carry the name Ethan and Ryan also don’t carry it. When Ethan takes over as Lord Prince he will have the choice to either keep the name Snape or to change it to Prince.” Severus explained.
After what had happened with Mr. Potter the Department started an investigation in every orphaned child that was placed in the last 30 years. They were working alongside Gringotts to make sure that they were not missing anyone. The reason here for was that until recently de Department did not even have a file for Mr. Potter. This meant that even if someone had done a regular check-up they wouldn’t have found anything, as Mr. Potter had not existed. Besides the investigation in other orphaned wizards and witches, there was also a special investigation happening concerning Mr. Potter’s case. The Department was desperately hoping that it was just an oversight that had happened in the highs of the war. Because the other option was either someone in the Department had hid Mr. Potter illegally or that they had been spelled to forget about his case. In that case, one had to wonder what other Departments had illegal activities going on. And even worse, that would mean that someone had been able to influence someone illegally and undetectable for more than 15 years. If that would come out the trust in the Ministry would completely disappear.
After the meeting, Harry made his way to his room to start making his homework. Normally he would be doing this at Hogwarts in the crowded Gryffindor common room. Some years he had been lucky that most of the students had left for the holidays, so he could concentrate. Other years he wasn’t as lucky. While he did love Gryffindor and the connection it provided him with his parents, he often wondered if it was the right choice. Was the sorting hat may be correct that placing him in Slytherin would have been good for him? Looking at everything now, he would have probably known about his inheritance earlier being surrounded by pureblooded roommates that are heirs themselves.
“Of course mister Potter, now based on what you have told me for some reason you have not been receiving our owls. We would propose to have an enchantment test done to see if someone or something is blocking your mail.” Ripclaw proposed.
“Why do people here think that you are so bad? I mean, they keep asking questions about how it is to live with you and when I tell them you are just like any other dad they don’t believe it.” said Ethan.
Knowing Ethan was not a Quidditch fan, Harry had bought him a range of Zonko’s products and some wizarding candy.
The days awaiting the reply were very stressful for Harry. It had already been 2 days and he was getting more and more nervous as time went on. He had a hard time concentrating in class since his mind constantly wandered to what had happened. Even Ron and Hermione had noticed that something was up. While Harry noticed that Hermione was mainly just curious about what had taken his attention away, Ron was more persistent. He constantly kept asking Harry what was going on and was very offended when he saw Harry spending more time with Neville.
Seeing only encouraging looks from Neville and his grandmother, Harry decided to trust them. Cutting his finger with the knife offered he placed one drop of blood on the paper. Without warning the name “
Letting Harry and Neville say goodbye to each other, Mdm. Longbottom turned towards Severus “Harry was staying at our place normally during the holidays, but it will be better for him to spend the rest of the holidays with you. This will allow him to get used to your dynamics. If for some reason you need to be away for a moment Harry is always welcome to stay at our place. I will be sending his trunk over with a house-elf the moment I arrive home. Do you already have an idea about what you are going to do about his guardians?” Shaking his head he replied, “That would be fine. Concerning his guardians that will be up to the Ministry and I will also first need to discuss everything with my family”
Looking directly at Harry, Severus reminded him, “don’t forget that as you are a minor you can sue them when they write damaging and untrue things about you.”
Immediately shooting out of bed Severus made his way to the hallway. Running while following the screaming he was led to the room that Harry was sleeping in. Throwing open the door he could see that Harry was having an awful nightmare. Deciding that the only thing to do was to wake Harry up, Severus slowly made his way towards Harry’s bed.
“No, I don’t know. And you should have received monthly bank statements from Gringotts” Neville stated, this was getting more horrifying every minute. How could Harry not have received his Gringotts statements? He knew for a fact that the Potters owned quite a few shared in many companies. While the bank statements are sent to the guardian (magical person) of a minor, once someone turns 14 they receive copies of the bank statements. His grandmother said that this was done as preparation for the summer classes before 5th year. It would ensure that everyone already had an idea of their funds and how official documents looked like so they could do more work with the real documents instead of some made-up ones.
“What did Ripclaw mean yesterday when he called you Lord Prince-Snape? And why do you not use it.” wondered Harry. He had never heard of the name Prince before and wondered why Severus did not use it.
“Wait, Uncle Lucius? Don’t tell me as in Lucius Malfoy?” stated Harry, just realizing what might have been said.
“So females really are second to sons. I never thought that equality was so far to be sought.” Exclaimed Harry, feeling quite disturbed by the treatment he thought women received in the wizarding world.
Seeing as it was almost 8 o’clock, Harry decided to go to breakfast and start the day. Walking downstairs still in his nightclothes, Harry made his way towards the dining room. While normally you would expect the high up purebloods to always be impeccably dressed, the nightclothes Harry wore were better than any clothes he had ever owned, even his Hogwarts cloaks. Serena had ordered him an entire new wardrobe that included new nightclothes as well. By the feel and look of them Harry knew they must have cost a fortune and he would not be surprised if they were made out of silk.
When Harry calmed down once more Severus asked “It is still quite late, do you think you can fall asleep again? Do you maybe want a dreamless sleeping draught?” said Severus trying to keep Harry calm.
Seeing where Severus was going, Mdm. Hawks assured Harry, “Lord Snape-Prince is correct Mr. Potter. You don’t have to fear anything becoming public. The worst that can happen is that they will know that your guardians were deemed unfit, the details of why are confidential. This is also the reason that we are in this office instead of in a courtroom. When the case concerns minors we always have the utmost privacy.”
“I will see how it goes if it is nothing I can just drop it next year.” said Harry standing to go to his next class.
After replying to Neville’s letter Harry made his way to Ethan rooms. Entering the room, he saw both him and Ryan sitting together playing a game of Exploding-Snap.
Besides worrying about Dumbledore and his followers, Harry was also nervous about meeting the Malfoys for the first time tonight. He had, after all, Malfoy to thank for his current situation. While he did not have a pleasant experience with both Draco Malfoy and Mr. Malfoy, he had never met Malfoy’s mother. In his classes, he had learned that she was originally from the house of Black, more specifically a cousin of Sirius. He hoped she would be something similar.
“Oh, ok.” Harry replied feeling overwhelmed. Today had been so overwhelming. He went from having a quite normal argument with Malfoy to discovering that everything he knew was a lie. Well no, it wasn’t a lie, he was just never informed of anything. This was what he hated most, feeling left in the dark. It made him feel like he was back in his cupboard, not knowing anything, feeling completely powerless.
“You heard that from your Death Eater father, did you not ferret? He’s probably lying, after all, he is a slimy snake” said Ron angrily, his face still red.
While he still did not believe it, Harry decided to drop the subject for now. For the rest of the afternoon, the three of them just talked about everything.
“Of course they will be here, my godfather, Aunt Narcissa, and Draco join us for Christmas each year,” said Ethan.
“You have to understand that the seats in the Wizengamot correspond with all the different houses of wizarding Britain. If houses are absorbed in each other or just die out that means that there are fewer seats in total. This means that there are fewer votes. If houses are merged that means that one person holds more votes than the rest. People will try to do everything to keep their lordship alive.”
Seeing as Serena was not going to answer Albus and he really needed a replacement, he decided to get on with the interview. Maybe he could get more information when she was working in Hogwarts. As the saying goes: keep your friends close, and your enemies closer.
It was unbelievable that people had been receiving money from the Potter accounts without any reason. Harry was wondering how he never noticed that they were never his friends. They were paid to be his friends. To be honest he was glad that Hermione was not part of this, at least that meant that some friends of him had been real. Thinking about it this might explain Ron’s behavior last year during the Tournament. He did drop Harry from one day to another. But this, no he never thought this was possible.
Not wanting to raise to the bait, Harry noticed that it was just him and Draco still standing in the receiving room. The others had probably already made their way to the informal sitting room. Turning around he quickly made his way there as well. Entering the sitting room everyone was already seated and looked up when they entered.
“You keep saying male children and sons, does that mean that females don’t get anything?” asked Harry.
“That is unusual,” stated Ripclaw while going through the documents. “I have here the confirmation that shortly after the elder Potters past away Albus Dumbledore read the wills. But, for some reason, I cannot find any documents stating that the wills were publically read. Since it is almost impossible we would have misplaced it, it seems we need to conclude that it was really never read” Ripclaw stated in shock. How could no one have noticed this before?
“First of all half-bloods can sometimes inherit lordships through their wizarding parent. Muggle-borns are sometimes descendent from squib lines and can as such revive or receive lordships. But besides the lordship seats, every ministry department head also has a seat in the Wizengamot. That means that in that way both females and males from any decent can be part of the process.”
“As there were some issues with your vaults and the standing orders, we will go through those first and make our way through all the sections. Today is for you to learn how to be able to read the files and we can also see if there are any irregularities. After today you will be able to propose changes, such as investments, but you will need my approval before they will be applied. For the Black account, you are only the heir, so you cannot make any adjustments yet, you can only review the statements,” continued Severus.
They spend quite some time after that discussing what had happened to Harry, before moving on to some more political subjects, before dinner was called. After dinner the adults retreated to have a drink, leaving the children alone again in the sitting room. Harry was actually surprised by how well the evening was going. He discovered that the Malfoys were very enjoyable without their masks on. Narcissa was extremely doting and had, together with Serena, already roped him in for another shopping trip over the Easter holidays. Lucius on the other hand was more serious, but someone he felt he could count on. Lucius did have a very confident air around him, and now Harry knew where Draco must have learned it.
Sooner then Harry wanted he was standing right before the door of the Snape quarters. Taking a deep, deep breath he knocked on the door. Before Harry could run, the door was opened and standing there was professor Snape.
Opening the file they both skipped the new changes section, as this information will also be in the specific sections. It would not be productive to go over things twice in the short amount of time they have. Both opened the first section labeled “vault statements”.
“The house-elves have set up the table to learn you the perfect table manners and what utensils to use for what dish.”
“If you think that is best?” Harry said, still not completely comfortable. “If you would follow the goblin here, he will bring you to our testing room. The test itself will take around 10 minutes. Once it is finished you will be escorted back here.” Ripclaw explained pointing at the goblin who had just entered the room. Looking back at Neville Harry only saw encouragement and decided to go along with everything for now.
“Excuse me Ripclaw, but that must be wrong. I have only been aware of the wizarding world for the past 5 years. I know for a fact that I never entered my vault before that.” Harry exclaimed getting angry.
Leading Harry to the right side of the library he pointed at a few shelves “These are the books that can be interesting and can help you with your heir studies. The books in this section cover politics, contracts, laws, history, and traditions. To give you an idea of where to start I have here a list of books that you are expected to have read by the end of the holidays. They are in order of what you are supposed to be reading first.” Explained Severus handing Harry a parchment with a list of books. Looking down at the parchment Harry had trouble keeping his expression from going to desperate. The list was filled with books covering all kinds of subjects. Doing a quick count Harry saw that there was a total of 28 books he had to read.
It continued on to list the year they needed to get married, the number of children they needed to have, the fact that while Ginny was allowed to have lovers on the side Harry was not allowed that luxury, the allowance that needed to be provided for Ginny, even were the Potter fortune was to go after he died, and of course the fact that the contract could never be broken.
"Yes, she did. She was always so good with plants. She could keep them so calm. A bit like Mr. Longbottom today." said Mdm. Sprout.
Seeing that Harry had no idea how to respond Severus stated, “Harry, you don’t have to make a decision right now. The Ministry first has to declare your guardians unfit and then Selena and I are your temporary guardians until the end of the holidays. You have then till summer to make a decision about what you would like to do. We just wanted to make sure that you knew the offer was there.”
The third reason is that they want to avoid the idea that a married couple has 2 lordships at the same time with 2 different people. This would bring opposing interests together and can create extra pressures on the marriage. It sometimes happens of course with male-couples, which is why in those cases it is advice to appoint one partner as a proxy to the others lordship.”
“It is no problem at all Harry, I hope you will have a great time here” Serena replied encouraging before dinner appeared on the table.
“This is very concerning” stated Ripclaw looking very worried. “Let's start from the beginning and make our way through everything as much as we can today. I hope you have no other appointments today as this will take some time.” Seeing no objections Ripclaw continued. “First of all mister Potter. Since you have no key on you, we will need to confirm who you are. Please place a drop of your blood on this paper.”
'Hagrid fired?' went through everyone’s mind. Well, it is not like we were not expecting this. There had been so many complaints and never had so many students ended up in the hospital. Plus there were no students continuing in the subject for the NEWT's, which is very unusual.
“That would be in order.” Stated Ripclaw writing something down and sending it of. Not one minute later a new Gringotts key appeared on his desk. Handing it over to Harry he said “Here is your new key, it will give you access to your trust vault until you are old enough to receive access to your other vaults.” “Wait I have more than one vault?” said Harry astonished. He was always very careful with how much money he spend so it would last him for some time after Hogwarts. Well to be honest he also never saw the point of spending lots of money when he had to return to the Dursleys who would have probably taken everything away or even destroyed it.
“Watch were you are going” exclaimed Draco Malfoy. Studying full time for his OWLs and his heir training had taken a lot out of him. And now Potter could not look were he was walking. He almost caused all of his homework to fly around, imagine having to start all over again.
Seeing she had his full attention she continued, “The house-elves have already taken them and put them in your closet. Feel free to choose which one you will be wearing tonight; all three are appropriate.”
“Mr Thomas the ministry adds creatures to the care of magical creature curriculum when a new species is discovered. It only rarely erases a species, this only happens when a certain magical creature has not been seen for at least 500 years. The reason herefore is that most rare magical creatures have gone into hiding because of poachers. That is why certain creatures are considered extinct. The only reason why all of you have seen a phoenix is that fawkes is heavily protected by Headmaster Dumbledore. Others of its kind are in hiding because the feathers and tears of a phoenix are worth lots of galleons.” answered professor Moonlight.
“Now there are a few rules you will have to follow. If you do not I will throw you out. Some of the animals we will study could be very dangerous if you take the wrong approach. You will be expected to have read the chapter in your book about the magical creature we will be studying before coming to the practical class. When doing this spend extra attention on the part pertaining what not to do around the magical creature. At the beginning of a practical class I will first make you aware of what you are going to do and how to do it. For the people who want to take this course next year you will have to get at least an E for your O.W.L’s, but I would advice only people with an O to take the N.E.W.T’s class. If you want to do something with Magical Creatures after graduating Hogwarts you will need an O on you N.E.W.T’s.” said Professor Moonlight.
By lunch, Harry was sure he wanted to try Care of Magical Creatures. After what happened last year in the tournament, he realized how important it was to have basic knowledge of magical creatures. He sadly enough only now realized that he made the wrong choices in third year. Divination was completely useless. Without Care of Magical Creatures, the only classes remaining were his core courses.
Helping Harry bring down the Weasleys would be the trial of the century, thought Lucius. Well not counting if Harry was also willing to take on Dumbledore. No matter, Lucius had already decided to help Harry if he needed it.
“Now that you are all fed and watered I have a few announcements to make. I would like all of you to welcome back professor Remus Lupin. Due to a change in the law he has returned as Defence Against the Dark Arts professor. Also due to circumstances, we had to say goodbye to Hagrid as your professor of Care of Magical Creatures. No worries you will still see him around as the groundkeeper.” said Professor Dumbledore in a very sad tone.
“Before we leave for the Ministry there were some things that I wanted to discuss with you. As you know, today the Ministry will look into your current guardians and they will then decide if they are unfit for you to stay with or if you need to go back.”
Looking up Severus Snape saw them entering. To be honest, when he had received the letter from Gringotts not even an hour ago he was surprised. He was called upon because of an issue with the magical guardian of Harry Potter? Deciding he could not ignore the letter he said goodbye to his wife and children before apparating to Diagon Alley. Once he arrived he received a small update on what had happened. Apparently Mdm. Longbottom had found out that Potter was not disrespectful but ignorant. No one had informed him of his legal duties. During the meeting, it was also discovered that Potter did not possess his Gringotts key, had several enchantments placed on him and that Dumbledore as legal guardian had been taking money. The funny thing is that Dumbledore was not even legally allowed to be his guardian, to begin with. If the will had been read, like it was supposed to, he would have been the one that would have raised Harry Potter.
“I can do that,” answered Harry, still unsure about telling his home situation to a random stranger.
“Well that was interesting.” said Harry standing up. “I will see you soon Luna, need to go drop my bags off before dinner.”
“What the hell is your problem?” Harry exclaimed. He really wanted to know why Malfoy could not act normal. Why did he always feel the need to insult Harry’s friends? Well to tell you the truth he had not heard any insult towards Hermione these past years, so that’s that. Did no one realize that he is not the golden boy everyone thinks? He hated his fame and would give it all away if it would mean he got his parents back.
“Ah hear they are!” Albus exclaimed softly as he pulled two letters and a small golden key for the drawer he was searching. Righting himself Dumbledore gave Hagrid the best “I’m a proud grandfather” smile he could muster. “Under normal circumstances you would be correct, only a professor my visit a student. Young Harrys case however, is as special as he is sure to be.” Dumbledore took a moment to allow this to allow this idea to take hold in the half giants mind before continuing. “As I intended to have you visit Gringotts tomorrow on a matter of great importance,” he watched as Hagrid continued to swell with pride at the thought of being so trusted, “I see no reason not to send you for Harry as well.” Dumbledore watches as Hagrid places the letters and key inside one of the many large pockets of his coat. Ever cautious Dumbledore played one final card to insure Hagrid didn’t try to pass his job on to another.“Now Hagrid you’ll be able to some magic to retrieve young Harry, but none after.” He knew had been correct when Hagrid’s eyes shined with unrestrained excitement at the prospect of doing magic, even for a short time. “Do try to be sure he knows everything necessary to thrive here at Hogwarts and keep an eye on him in Diagon Ally. We wouldn’t want anyone Dark trying to influence him, would we?”
Albus Dumbledore, Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, did NOT make mistakes. This was an irrefutable fact in his mind and a point on which he prided himself. He would never brag of such a thing of course; he didn’t feel he needed to. Dumbledore had in fact denied his infallibility on several occasions. Those who could say they knew him well saw him as a paragon of Light and Justice, a steadfast defender of the weak and oppressed. His closest confidants would tell all who asked that Albus Dumbledore was a good friend and to many a kindly grandfather.
High up in Ravenclaw tower, Filius Flitwick was preparing for the coming year. Setting aside his many lesson plans, Filius imagined what the coming year might have instore for Ravenclaw House. He pictured the students with eager young minds, ready to prove and expand their knowledge. He even allowed himself a moment of hope they might win the House Cup. Sighing fondly Filius gathered his papers with precision owed to years of practice. Stepping into the corridor, thoughts fixed solely on his bed, Filius nearly toppled his paperwork and himself at the sight of Fawkes speeding towards him. What in the world could Dumbledore need at this late hour? Bending ever so slightly at the waist Filius placed his armful of parchment on the corridor floor before extending his arm to the phoenix. Fawkes landed gently on the proffered arm of the diminutive professor and extended the newly changed letter. With a word of thanks Filius took the letter, flicked it open with one hand, skimmed its contents and raised disbelieving eyes to briefly only to drop them again. Filius read the letter in its intertie three times before turning excitedly to Fawkes. It was at this moment that Fawkes knew he had chosen correctly.
Dumbledore chuckled softly at the silliness of muggles while he rummaged through paperwork in a side drawer. Hagrid watched with eager beetle black eyes for several heartbeats before he could no longer contain his curiosity.
Harry stood with his hand outstretched for several heart beats as the Professor simply stared at him, his dark dark eyes conveying equal parts confusion and anger. As the seconds seemed to slip into minutes without the Professor moving or speaking Harry slowly started to move his hand back to his side. Had he done something wrong? Harrys’ mind whorled with anxiety and confusion. He had been as polite as he knew to be. Was it considered rude for a child to address an adult in the wizarding world? Harrys’ heart thudded painfully as an anxiety fueled though flitted through his mind. Could it..could it just be him? “Of course it’s you.” a cold voice that sounded suspiciously like Uncle Vernon snarled in his mind. “He can tell you're a no good, worthless FREAK just by looking at you! He can tell you’ll never amount to anything, that you don’t belong! You’ll be back in your cupboard in no time!” A warm long fingered hand firmly gripping his drew him from his dark spiraling thoughts.
Dumbledore took a few moments to survey the man in front of him. Standing over 8feet tall and being wide enough to have to squeeze through most doors sideways, Hagrid was quite the impressive figure. His long dark tangles hair and beard coupled with his small dark eyes gave him a wild dangerous look that belied his softer that kitten fur nature. Dumbledore was certain Hagrid was the perfect choice to seen after young Harry as not many were brave enough to hassle the giant man.
“Hagrid my boy, I have a very important job for you.” Dumbledore smiled softly, blue eyes twinkling behind his half-moon spectacles as he watched Hagrid’s eyes widen and his back straighten with pride. “We seem to be having some trouble getting young Mr. Potter his Hogwarts letter. His family seems to have decided to try out running our magic.”
Professor Flitwick ended the handshake with a small nod and a warm smile. A smile that dimmed when Hagrid asked what had brought the Professor to Diagon Alley. Had Harry been slightly observant he might have missed the way the Professor seemed surprised that Hagrid was surprised to see him. He might have missed the way the Professors head tilted slightly and his eyes narrowed minutely. It was clear to Harry that the Professor believed their meeting was prearranged. Harry couldn’t understand why Hagrid would be acting surprised to see the Professor if it had been arranged that they would meet. Why were Hagrid and Professor Flitwick surprised by the others' reaction to this meeting? Most importantly why did Harry still see confusion and anger in the Professors’ eyes whenever they landed on him?
“No,” Draco muttered, eyes defiantly squeezed shut, hands glued tight to his luggage. “I shan’t. You can’t make me.”
Millicent sighed, somewhat sympathetically, and flicked the other’s forehead, forcing his eyes open.
Oh. Draco felt his face reddening. He had forgotten that many of his classmates had been here more recently than him, even staying for weeks at a time to help mend the castle’s lacerations.
Etched into the leather-bound cover was a portrait of a hummingbird in flight. Inscribed below were the words ‘mea navis aëricumbens anguillis abundant’. On the inside cover, Granger had inked in gold a list of instructions. Essentially, the book was to be used to share information on classes, job openings and events. How awfully boring.
“ Well best be off. Lots ter buy.” Hagrid chuckled lightly and all but carried Harry out of a side door and into a small alleyway.
“Yeh were wantin’ to see me Professor Dumbledore sir?” Hagrid’s voice was as soft as it can get and rather nervous sounding at that. It was quite unusual for the headmaster to call on him before the start of the school year, particularly as he had already made his report on the herds of the Forbidden Forest.
Harry rubbed the back of his head gently, hoping to dispel the lingering pain, while he watched Hagrid. He couldn’t really be famous could he? He had never, to his knowledge, done anything noteworthy. There had to be some kind of mistake, he was no one special. Just as Harry was going to ask why he was famous Hagrid tapped a single brick on the wall three times. The question died on Harrys’ lips as the bricks began to wiggle and move; revealing an elegant archway. Hagrid smiled at Harrys’ stunned expression and with an all encompassing sweep of his arm said “Welcome Harry to Diagon Alley!”
After receiving a heartfelt “Course not professor!” Albus sends Hagrid about his task with a fond smile. Returning to his chair Albus sits down heavily, with a weary sigh and closes his eyes. Several minutes pass with the only sound in the office coming from the many strange whirling devices that line the walls and the crackle of the fire. From his perch atop the headmasters’ chair Fawkes contemplates all he has heard and considers what he might do next. As a creature of pure, unending magic he can break his bond to Dumbledore whenever he should choose to do so. Breaking the bond however would leave him with no reason to stay within Hogwarts. Just as Fawkes decides he’ll stay for the time being to keep an eye on the manipulative old wizard, Dumbledore straightens suddenly. Flapping his wings indignantly as the chair rocks with Albus’s movement, Fawkes watches as he reaches across the desk for parchment and a self-inking quill. Dumbledore sets about writing several short notes and once again speaks quietly to himself.
“Lily.” Snape whispers her name like a prayer. His dark smooth voice filled with such longing, pain, and regret it would break the heart of any who heard it. But there is no one about to hear his pain filled voice, nor to see the single tear that falls from his eyes, as he morns the life, love, and family they might have had.
Panic fueled instinct had Harry turning to run as the mob of people reached for him, only to find himself held fast by Hagrids’ giant hands. Harrys’ heart raced as the crowd converged on him; hands grasping, groping, prodding. His oversized hand-me downs were torn as several over excited patrons tried to turn him towards them at the same time. Harrys’ eyes swam with unshed tears, his breaths coming in rapid and shallow as his buttocs and groin were harshly fondled by unseen assalents. He couldn’t help the whimper of pain that escaped him as a clump of his hair was ripped out by the roots. For the first time in years Harry found himself wishing he was back in his cupboard and sagged in relief when Hagrids’ voice broke over the crowd.

Fawkes knew he would get to see young Harry again if they could get his letter to him. Something along the lines of a thousand letters had be sent to the young boy with no reply to be he had. It was most curious and was the reason behind Dumbledore’s pacing. Just as Fawkes was beginning to think he might take that nap after all, Albus began muttering to himself. This was not a habit Albus had ever indulged in in the may long years that Fawkes had known him and thus shocked him into true wakefulness.
“Dumbledore’s Smarmy little arsewipes, more like,” Blaise whispered from his right. He shushed him, but secretly he was grateful for the attempt to lower the tone to the level they were used to. He needed a degree of spitefulness to combat the ugly, hot feeling of envy he felt when Hermione spoke about Transfiguration; even though no one credited him for it, in Draco's mind it was his talent.
“Not like I had any choice; your Prime Minister still believes in original sin,” Draco retorted, a sneer in his voice that he knew debased him, yet he still couldn’t shed.
Conversations dipped in and out of focus like an old radio: “…can you believe what Trevor…”, “…not a chance mate!”, “…I told you we wouldn’t be late…” and Draco winced every time a voice sounded familiar. The suitcase clipping at his heels felt a little like karma.
“…you’d think that in eight years we’d turn up early at least once.” came the sudden voice of Harry Potter, somewhere down the train. Draco head snapped around, tension rising up his spine in an instant. Glances at the others echoed his silent prayer: please pick any other carriage but this one, you absolute buffoon.
“Ow!” Draco yelled, indignant, but he was soon distracted by the reality he had been unsuccessfully trying to forget.
Milly’s face was a mirror when she caught his eye, stumbling down to the Hufflepuff’s as if in a daze. The only comfort was the terror etched onto the face of Earnest Macmillan.
“Must we mention the boggart in the closet?” Draco sighs. “Surely people must understand that we were children?” It sounds weak even to his ears.
“You interrupted my tirade,” said Blaise in lieu of an introduction as Millicent hefted their luggage into the overhead carriers. “Don’t you want to know the gossip?”
The wait with bated breath went on for a long time. Almost long enough that Draco expected Millicent to roll her eyes, declare herself Slytherin and be done with it, but then—
“No song this year,” croaked the Hat apologetically. “Simply wasn’t time to write two. Took enough convincing for me to go along with this façade—.” A look from McGonagall stopped it mid-sentence.
Returning for eighth year had never been the plan. Ever since fifth year, he’d had a cushy St Mungo’s apprenticeship lined up for post-graduation; despite what everyone thought, Draco was
“The snakes, more like,” she whispered back darkly. The furtive looks cast at them by other returning students concurred with her statement.
Such fickle friends Maude and Victoria were; not long ago they were clinging to Draco’s robetails like lost little lambs. Daphne, by contrast, had always been something that scared Draco; her own person. As the only muggleborn Slytherin in their year, one might assume her blood status was the reason she never moulded to Pansy’s clique but honestly, Pansy had never given a shit about all that until Draco began to. No, truthfully, Daphne was resistant to their beguiling charms. Suppose it all came good for her in the end, Draco thought bitterly.
Headmistress McGonagall chose that moment to walk primly into the entrance hall, taking her place on the tall stone steps in front of the students. She wore the same emerald green robes Draco had seen her in so many times as a Professor, but they were accentuated by a new cool shroud of authority. “Students,” she spoke, voice as thin as ever.
Feeling like Anne Boleyn on the way to the chopping block, Draco took his seat as his name was called. From this vantage point, he could see Blaise giving him an ironic thumbs-up and Millicent looking more out of place than a Basilisk in a barnyard. He tried not to meet the disapproving stares of anyone else.
“I feel like we’re the lions on Noah’s Ark,” he whispered to her, giggling at the absurdity of it all.
Draco and Pansy shared a rare kind of mutual understanding that ran beyond friendship. That’s not to say it always involved tolerating the other’s presence, but Draco knew that she’d be there for life regardless. Since his grandmother’s death last year, the pool of those who truly knew him had been halved to one. Which was, he supposed, a little bit sad.
A painting depicting a young girl in Tudor dress was crowded full of girls painted in similar styles, giggling together as they looked beyond the frame. He watched as a Renaissance redhead’s face lit up at the words of another girl sporting a Victorian petticoat.
The hat pronounced Dean Thomas an assertive “GRYFFINDOR” and pondered for a moment before condemning Seamus Finnegan to Hufflepuff. Greengrass, too, was placed back into Slytherin.
“And Theo?” he asked, purely to see Millicent reach new levels of fascination with the Scottish countryside.
“…as I’m going to end up a Hufflepuff, I don’t care if I was friends with people who worked for Osama Bin Laden, it’s not my fault that your dad…”
“Our old friend has switched ranks,” Blaise intoned, crossing his legs disdainfully like some kind of peeved cat. “He’s being fraternising with Antony Goldstein and Michael Corner. That lot.”
That earned her a serious nod from Millicent: “why, I always knew you saw through my hard exterior to the cuddliness within.”
A reflective tranquillity fell across the group as their boats bobbed gently along the water. Draco knew everyone’s mind was on the last time they’d been here; he just hoped no one lingered on his particular role.
Slowly, Potter re-joined his friends, avoiding all eye contact with his new housemates. Draco snorted. “Practice what you preach.”
Before Draco could interject and say something disgustingly soppy, McGonagall saved him: “Bulstrode, Millicent”. Milly grinned at them, hiding her nervousness, before taking the hat to her head.
Bouncing on the balls of her feet nervously, Draco watched Fay Dunbar join Millicent, Terry Boot and Susan Bones become Gryffindor’s and Maude Davis return to Slytherin, much to Pansy’s chagrin. Potter was up next, an obvious one, Pansy thought decidedly. No way could their glorious saviour, the Boy Who Lived himself, be from any house but Gryffindor.
Humiliation coiled in Draco’s stomach. Potter took one last impenetrable glance into the carriage before taking off after his friends.
“Dunno what to tell you mate, I could’ve sworn I set the alarm,” grunted someone who sounded a lot like Weasley. They were getting closer.
The evening September air was something of a tonic. Piling out of the train in freshly changed robes with his fellow students, or ‘the great unwashed’, as the clipped tones of Blaise described them, felt familiar if not quite comfortable.
“Lucky you, then,” muttered Pansy. Silence fell over the carriage like a cloak. Blaise’s bewitching mother, hailed as the closest a human has come to enchanting as many men as a siren, had whisked him away to muggle Rome for much of the war. Jealousy threatened to rise up Draco’s throat but the thought that Blaise didn’t have to be sitting here with them right then forced it back down into his lungs.
The mood continued as they began the walk up to the castle, with little waves of quiet conversation punctuating the calm. In the entrance way, as the doors clanged shut behind them, Draco fought his sudden anxiety and pushed his pointy chin up high. He was going to face this with a modicum of dignity. He noticed the first years being led into a different chamber than usual and hoped to god that there would be no special attention drawn to the eighth years; there was only so much public reckoning he could endure.
God, Draco just wanted to go home. But the wheels of the Hogwarts Express had begun to turn and he rolled out of the station with it. Watching the hills blur, his own words were stuck on rotation in his mind.
“Although your place of learning was desecrated, I would like to ensure that the following year is as fulfilling for you as possible,” the headmistress continued. “It is my belief that healing would be better achieved through unity and as such I have elected to create a space exclusively for Eighth Years. You will be sharing a common room.”
“Don’t pretend you know what it was like for them,” Blaise interjects sharply. Draco is grateful that Potter’s gaze settles elsewhere.
“So much for house unity,” Blaise remarked icily, relaxing his posture despite barely appearing tense during the interaction.
“Oh, one more thing before I forget!” Granger laughs a little nervously. “Those of you in Dumbledore’s Army remember the fake galleons I made using a Protean Charm.”
The remainder of the Sorting was relatively uneventful. Granger and Weasley, of course, remained Gryffindor’s. A surprise, although not an unwelcome one, came when his old friend Parvarti joined him in Slytherin.
“Well, well, well, look what the cat dragged in,” Pansy Parkinson drawled, albeit with just a shadow of her former bite. Draco flipped her off begrudgingly before flopping down next to her and resting his head on her shoulder. Her formerly gaunt cheekbones had filled out a little since he last visited, Draco noted approvingly. Maybe the pride in her that seemed as fragile as a wounded bird in the weeks following the battle was somewhat reanimated.
“Hush,” McGonagall commanded the chaos. “I do not mean to separate friendships. The common room with ensure time can be spent with those closest to you. But you will room with and wear the colours of your new house.”
Blaise snorts. “You’d better be nicer Pansy. You’re going to be doing a lot of kissing arse this year. Even to the Hufflepuffs.”
Granger seemed to have found herself in the speech, taking on a confidence that Draco had never seen in her before. Perhaps it had been there all along and he had never thought to look. Again, he was struck by the sense that he was losing his breath just trying to keep pace. Maybe he should have listened; Granger finished to enthusiastic applause from an audience that seemed to have forgotten the impending re-Sorting.
“Eighth years! Callin’ all you eighth years!” bellowed the gamekeeper. “Eighth years, don’t get on them carriages, mind!”
“Go on then Rita Skeeter,” Draco indulged sardonically. He knew Blaise would tell him regardless of his teasing. He so adored being the gatekeeper of information; knowledge is power, as he was fond of saying with dramatic intonation.
“That’s enough,” McGonagall’s lips couldn’t help but twitch into a smile. “While I am sure you all expected to be elsewhere by now, these are unprecedented times. I want to begin by thanking you for returning despite the horrific conditions many of you endured here last year.”
“Parvarti told me you weren’t coming back,” he said simply. It took a beat for Draco to realised it was directed his way. There was no bite to it, but he shifted in his seat regardless.
“You can do better anyway,” he smirked at Millicent. Blaise tittered. “Just the four of us then, I suppose”.
“Information is power. That’s what you always say,” he spoke, raising his voice slightly as a first year was loudly welcomed into Gryffindor. “What if we controlled the spread of information? If we were the spiders in the web?”
Ignoring them, Draco set his sights ahead on the castle where his formative years had played out. Even Hogwarts seemed smaller, as if it had been bent backwards into the wind; another remind that this was the year he was supposed to have graduated to bigger stages. Yet even Draco had to admit, there was a whimsical beauty to it, the reason that first boat trip brimmed with excitement. Orange candlelight flickered from turrets against the midnight sky, sending cascading reflections down onto the resting lake before him.
Chatter about potential resorting was abuzz as they boarded the waiting boats. “I, for one, wouldn’t mind at all,” Daphne Greengrass, a fellow Slytherin with an outspoken orange fringe, loudly remarked. Maude Davis and Victoria Nettlebed were quick to hum to agreement.
“Protect him from the nasty Death Eaters, I suppose,” Pansy helpfully supplied, lowering her tone as she uttered the dirty phrase.
“Hey,” Parvarti nudged him as she joined their house. “This is your fault – you wouldn’t believe the Slytherin jokes I used to get for hanging around you.” Draco grinned back, feeling suddenly lighter. Only when Blaise was proclaimed a Slytherin did he fully begin to relax.
McGonagall raised a finger to quell the frenzied chatter that broke out at this. “It is fitting that you will be housed in the Astronomy Tower that many of you worked so hard to repair this summer.”
“Like we all had a chance,” Millicent hissed back. Pansy’s head, previously impassive and downturned, shot up, as if she meant to spew venom like they did when back they thought there was nothing they were capable of losing.
By ‘that lot’ he meant the Ravenclaw’s with decent bloodlines. So that’s why Nott had stopped returning their owls. Shrewd of him, Draco noted. He’d picked friends who erred on the right side, both of history and his family’s approval.
