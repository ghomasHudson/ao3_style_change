Looking in the mirror, Draco assessed their outfit. The blue heels lengthened their legs, and the tight black dress emphasized the padding on their arse and the perfect sinch of their waist. Satisfied, they turned and were startled a little by a knock at the door.
Draco woke with a start, his heart pounding. Sweat had gathered on his forehead and chest. He blinked, eyes adjusting to the darkness as he realized that he was not in his dorm. He sat up quickly in alarm, only to feel a searing pain in his abdomen that had him lying back down, biting his lip to keep from hissing loudly.
It was, of course, at the great expense of my parents, but it was the least they could do, considering it was their choice to put me in harm's way.
here! Wherever 'here' is."
“Shut up.”
Third-year Charms, Harry decided, wasn't any more interesting than it had been the first two years.
Reluctantly, Draco moved further up onto the bed, letting himself be wrapped in Potter’s strong arms.
Cool wind kissed his skin as he and Potter flew out of the Room and into the outside air. They landed on the ground with a thud, tumbling off of the broom, followed shortly thereafter by Greg and Weasley. Potter managed to stand first, dusting off his clothes and
I really can't quite express how much this song means to me. Part of me wishes I'd heard it a few years ago, when I needed to hear this message more than ever. But it was at that time that I turned to Drarry for an escape. So it feels fitting, now, to get to try to do it justice.
He ignored Hermione’s knowing gaze and Ron’s eye roll as he unabashedly stared daggers at the bloke practically groping Draco at the bar. Harry saw Draco’s eyes widen imperceptibly, noticed his smile falter and his cheekbone twitch.
Harry wanted nothing more than to shoot across the sky, cut through the smog of the big city and drag Draco with him, numbering every star they passed along the way.
"Seriously?"
The potion had seemed like a good idea. It had been advertised as a surefire way to force your brain to be happy.
Harry placed a firm hand on Malfoy's shoulder, making direct eye contact but saying nothing as he gave the other man a chance to back out, to step away before they went any further. Nerves filled his stomach for the first time since he’d spotted Malfoy across the club, and the sight of his hand boldly clasping Malfoy’s shoulder in a silent request brought the gravity of the moment to the forefront of his mind.
Harry had his cloak, and she had her own in bright, burning red. Both were invisible.
The other students in the circle started snickering and whispering to one another. Potter’s face had taken a tomato-like hue, but he didn’t protest or deny the accusation. Draco sat, stunned, as he took in the scene.
“Draco?”
He snarls and tosses the parchment to the floor. I bend and pick it up, and my heart drops at the familiar handwriting.
"Draco, I still need an explanation."
It was the night before Draco was to be wed, and just a week ago had been their agreed-upon final meeting.
Buckle up for this one!
"Harry," Hermione's voice was gentle. "You might as well get it over with."
"Don't be."
“We’re here for you. Whenever you’re ready. But this Mind Healer can help with what your friends can’t.” Draco looked at Harry steadily, his stare searching.
The Nargles told her to do it.
Draco wiped the tears that spilled down his cheeks, his suitcase levitating behind him. The angry snarls from his father still rang in his ears, cruel and sharp.
"Well, your mother was a big help."
A few minutes later, the other customer had handed the woman some coins and walked out of the stop. Harry hadn't noticed; he was preoccupied with staring at the self-playing harp in the corner of the room.
You've given up on the pretense of not staring at him. The sun is setting, and that means he'll soon be yours.
Now was the fun part. And from the moment a makeup brush touched Draco’s face, they became Tarasque.
Some days, Narcissa glanced longingly at the fireplace, replaying in her mind the sight of Draco, with tear-streaked cheeks and shaking hands laced with hers.
“I want you to show me around, Malfoy.”
Harry'd held himself together the entire time, plastering a small smile on his as Draco stepped into the Floo for the last time. As Draco had disappeared from Harry's life like the smoke surrounding him from the green flames, Harry'd wondered if he'd seen pleading in those gray eyes. As if he'd been willing Harry to say something to make him stay.
It was quiet, simple. He went to work as a potions master and came home to his flat, where he made dinner and read a book while he ate. Then he was in bed by 10 p.m. and asleep by 11.
Or from the wriggling bundle currently lodged underneath Harry's shirt.
"Why'd you bring me here?" Potter's face is adorably confused.
But with Draco's lifeless, bloodied body crumpled on the floor, Harry knew he had no choice.
He didn’t glare or scowl. He didn’t pick his words like heat-seeking missiles designed to target what he knew were Potter’s weak spots. He didn’t let his pride swell into defensiveness.
“Maines and Strayer are questioning him now. Maguire is taking care of the son. No leads yet.”
Malfoy cocked his head. "But that's what Hogwarts was going to do, right? Send you here to look around and then have you scurry right back to report your findings before claiming it for your own?"
Draco raised an eyebrow. “Go on.”
“Luna, are you…?”
His body felt heavy and sluggish, which wasn't helped by the stiff, unfamiliar mattress beneath him.
Harry moved his lips against Draco's still, shocked ones; he started to pull away, an apology at the ready, when Draco finally responded, moving against Harry's mouth with passion.
"I won't let it happen, Draco. I promise."
Harry hadn't thought to bring anything else when he'd left England three years ago; well, not the car, that'd been a new addition when he'd arrived in America with his other belongings.
“Fine, Tom. Go ahead.”
2. He loves Quidditch, but not just because it’s competitive. He loves the feeling of flying, the wind in his hair. He loves the freedom, the chase of looking for the snitch. He loves having a single-minded mission and focus to find this little fluttering ball that’s meant to fool him.
The only warning Draco had was the split second when He reached up and flicked open the locket doors to reveal a living eye with a green pupil, a ring of silver wrapped around it.
Draco let out a shuddering breath. "No," he said, his voice tight. "I'm not who he wants me to be. I'm not his son."
There are few things in this world I love more than New York and Drarry (as you all will know in due time *wink*). I’ve written two short fics (in the same universe—goodness it’s weird to think of myself as having created a story universe???) on Tumblr for which people have asked for a sequel: Fog and Wish. (And by people, I especially mean @apr1cots who threatened to write it herself if I didn't)
but we just got back and I feel terrible and so I came here and--"
Tarasque walked up the steps to the stage, basking in the spotlight once more.
I've gone somewhere too small and nameless for a map, yet just big enough for me to carve out my own little corner of the world, in the shadows where I belong. Anonymity is my friend, finally, after shouldering the burden of my surname.
She wondered whether her lipstick looked cracked on her chapped lips as she gave her son a soft smile, gathering every ounce of love still left in her heart with the effort.
You turn your gaze away, and you try to look as enticing as possible when you sip your drink, knowing his eyes will soon risk glancing over at you.
Draco sighed. "It's fine, Harry, let's just order takeaway."
I feel you constantly, your eyes on me. I yearn to touch you, to let myself fall into you, easily and with abandon. Every step I take away from you sends me further into withdrawal, an emotional purge from a Harry Potter addiction.
His mother touched his arm tenderly, causing him to look into her soft gray eyes. A tear was rolling down her cheek as she smiled at him.
Harry quickly closed out the tab and walked out of the restaurant, feeling
Lucius's voice was rough from lack of use. "Boyfriend?" He spat, his tone impressively derisive for a man with no reason for pride. "No son of mine is bent."
Sure enough, Potter remained. Very much real, and very possibly naked, though the bedding covering his lower half left that fact a mystery.
Harry chuckled. "You won't be needing those any longer."
"No, I used it to pick up my crup's shite."
“Sorry, Draco.”
Harry blinked. He felt his mind shift, the artificial haze fading to leave a dull ache; still, he felt the relief of clarity and reality settle in his chest.
Draco closes his eyes. "I can't love him, you know. And he can't love me. And I can't pretend for him. I refuse to pretend any longer to be something I'm not."
(If anyone cares about why I wrote this chapter, I was prompted summer, day in the life, and NYC, on Tumblr, and those three were practically made for this universe because Fog literally takes place in the summer in NYC.)
. One minute left. It wasn't much time, but it would be enough.
*blush* "Potter, focus. Now, look into my eyes the whole time."
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go. I'm going to fold this parchment and seal it with a spell and tuck it into a drawer within this desk. And then I will walk into the living room of the flat I share with Harry and I will snog him senseless. And I'm going to do those things because I can—because we can.
Harry’s eyes widened. “W-what?”
"I do. I care. Is that not enough?"
"Well, you do."
Draco took a deep breath, willing his heart to freeze over, to be numb.
—" Malfoy started before he choked on the rest of the word. His face paled as he looked at Harry, who was peeking at Malfoy through slits between his fingers.
Potter snorted. “There’s no way you have a dog.”
I'm not the sort of ghost you can see. And yet I haunt you, don't I? My sobs and whimpers echo in your ears. My magic is in the wand you stole from me, the one you claimed was lost but we both know is stowed away in your trunk. My lifeless eyes stare at you when you try in vain to sleep without thinking of my eternal rest.
Draco let himself take one more moment to wonder whether his Father had experienced happiness that couldn't be bought. Because the pounding of his heart, the flutter of his stomach, the sound of Harry's laugh--that was free, and priceless.
“Wait, Malfoy. I have something for you.”
The old grandfather clock in the living room of Grimmauld Place struck 2am. Harry paused as he was bringing the glass of firewhiskey to his lips to acknowledge the time, allowing a voice in his head that sounded far too much like Hermione to say its piece.
Harry gulped the last of his firewhiskey, letting the burn run down his throat and trying to elongate the length of his neck as he swallowed. He nearly smirked at the feel of gray eyes following the movement, but he knew outward cockiness wasn't what he needed--what they both needed--tonight.
"Happy Birthday!" Draco said, plopping down on the bed and jostling Harry from his sleep.
“Fine, are you?”
Find me on Tumblr. @PhoebeDelia
“O-of course only if you’re comfortable. I trust you and I love you and I get it if it’s too much and—”
I want to spend every season with you. I want to dance together in the April rain, tuck May flowers into your wild curls, feel the sand between our toes, light the fireplace, and drink warm spiked cocoa. I want your hand in mine to be the constant in a world that still never knows how it wants to feel.
"But why?"
Father, I’m trying, I’m dying
Draco raised his eyebrows. "Really?"
"Oh, er, sure." Harry pulled out the wand and handed it to him.
So there Draco was, trudging through Knockturn Alley and avoiding the curious stares of those passing by him. It was getting dark, the western sun setting in the distance. He shivered against the biting, frigid air. He felt a rush of gratitude toward Pansy for letting him stay in her flat while he got back on his feet. He knew his mother, who'd come to her senses and left his father for a townhouse in France, would gladly take him in, but he knew if he left London he'd never gather the strength to return.
“Mate,” Harry rubbed over his eyes. “Let’s think about what we have here. This ‘Little Red’ person is obviously not someone we’ve encountered before. They keep using different methods of killing people, only targeting former Death Eaters, so it’s probably someone badly hurt by the war or who lost a loved one.”
Still, the area had its charms, but to find them you had to go beyond the merry-go-round and the restaurants, and stroll through the suburban haven that was Brooklyn Heights.
Draco stood in front of the class, surveying the room and trying his best to affect the holier-than-thou air he'd perfected over the years. Green eyes stared sharply as if trying to penetrate the facade, but he ignored them.
When Lucius had kicked Draco out, he'd felt helpless and terrified of his own shadow, much like he had during the war. Now, the fear still lingered in the back of his mind, but Draco knew there was more to the world than he'd once known.
Harry blushed. "I, er. I mean I––"
"Why can't we just be friends?"
Satisfaction twisted in Draco's chest, hot and sharp; he looked at the man who used to be Father but who would now and forever be Lucius. The man's hair was thinning and becoming more silver than blond. Draco rubbed a hand over his own clean-shaven face, relishing the jealousy the flared in Lucius's eyes. Father had always liked his face free of stubble.
"C'mon! It's coming!" Harry called behind him as he ran up the steps of the Ministry building. The crowd was screaming in terror as it swarmed in its escape out of the building, but he pushed through the mob to make his way up to the top.
“It’s one of my statements. My name is Harry. I hate treacle tart. And…”

The boy swallowed. "I'm not trying to disturb you. I simply wanted to ask if I might have my wand back."
Prompt: Dear Diary
"You do?"
"No, you don't!"
Draco sighed. "Where're we going tomorrow?"
Draco let the thought linger for a moment. He considered Pansy and Blaise the siblings he never had, and it wasn't as if his Father had really raised him.
And Harry’d let him slip through his fingers like sand. He thought they’d have time, that the right moment would eventually arise to tell Draco that he made him glow inside. But then Draco announced he was leaving and the light went with him.
Ron nodded. “Can’t hurt, mate.”
After the last six years, he was no stranger to waking up in the middle of the night from strange dreams, but his subconscious--or rather Voldemort--usually tortured him with disturbing images and nightmare scenarios.
"Thank you," he whispered, tightening his arms around the thin, yet muscled torso against him.
Draco suppressed an eye roll. “Of course you are.”

On each other in halls
Harry, I do hope you respond when you read this, but--
I wish I could offer a stroll or a shopping trip through Diagon the next day, but we both know I can't, I won't. The kind ones stare, the bolder ones glare or hiss accusingly, and the angry ones waggle their fingers and shout and slap.
"You're Potter when you're not paying attention to me."
Draco pulled away in shock, and Harry's stomach dropped.
"No no! I just--I like you too."
"Harry wh--" His eyes widened as he felt the pull of a portkey, the sound of Harry's amused laughter echoing behind him.
He stood, his hand shaking slightly. He raised his wand and Apparated away with a
"I don't want to! The only people in my life I want to love are Mother, Pansy, Blaise, and you, and he doesn't deserve it!"
Father smirks then, cruel and knowing. “You sound just like your mother.”
The Cause of Draco’s Early Demise was dressed in a forest green button-down shirt that stretched across a broad, muscled chest and was tucked into fitted black trousers.
Tell me, so I know what not to do.
And with that, Draco shut down.
The lack of wind in Midtown makes the heat worse, but the sleeping sun provides relief from the summer’s sweltering blaze. Draco usually swallows down his longing for England’s cleansing rain, but on these nights, when he feels crushed like Atlas under the weight of the world, he lets the bitter melancholy rise in his throat.
"Did I ever tell you the Sorting Hat almost put me in Slytherin?"
It wasn’t like a flower sprouting through the earth, or the sun peering through the clouds; it couldn’t be compared to a bullet piercing the air and rupturing its target, or jumping from a waterfall into a crystal blue lake.
Draco nodded. “Thank you, Lyssa.”
"You're welcome, Potter."
Harry smiled softly. "No, I'm--just looking for something."
The steps outside of The Lambs Club seemed a little steeper after two glasses of wine, but Draco still managed to cross the threshold with some dignity. The same could not be said for Potter, however, who nearly tripped in his haste to follow him out the door of the restaurant. Draco was congenial enough not to openly mock him.
Draco smiled. Lyssa and Geoffrey had been two of the early supporters of his hunger program at WDKMUS, a business partnership that had grown into friendship over the last few years. “No, I’m afraid not. My...dinner companion made the reservation, but I’d love to  sit at my usual table, if possible.”
Then the boys parted ways
“So?”
“I’m just as sane as you are, Harry.”
Draco gave him a wide, sharp grin. "I have my ways," he said darkly.
For our wonder brunette.
And they see me as my parents’ son.
Suddenly, he felt a warm hand gently take his own. "Come with me, kid, I think I can help."
A hand clasped his wrist and spun him around. Luckily, Draco was able to keep his features impassive against Potter’s wild, desperate expression. Draco stood there, letting Potter hold his wrist and hold his gaze with beseeching green eyes.
Potter grinned. “Do you want to go first, or shall I demonstrate?”
"I know you can. But you didn't tell me where you went."
"Because you don't have a subtle bone in your body!"
"You're in St. Mungos."
It was easy to get lost staring into the fire.
"Harry, are you even listening?"
Songfic prompt: "Daylight" by Taylor Swift
"We won't let him get that far."
“Of course I was,” Draco smirked. “But what about, specifically?”
He’d successfully avoided these gatherings thus far, wanting to avoid the possible pitfalls of being drunk in front of Gryffindors who didn’t owe him anything. And while it was perfectly fine for Pansy and Blaise and Millicent to rub intoxicated elbows with war heroes, Draco preferred for his interactions with other houses to be carefully orchestrated and without error.
he said, hands shaking as he held the
Already, he was running late. He still had to Apparate to the Ministry to retrieve the portkey. How did he manage to cock up his new life in America before he even left England? This had to be some kind of record.
Draco once thought he would forever be defined by his name, or the mark on his arm, or the wealth in his family’s vaults. He thought that his value came from power, influence, and self-determination.
Draco was silent for a moment. He nodded. “Okay.”
Terror shot up Draco's spine and his eyes snapped open. "Potter, what are you doing!"
It's the least I can do, really.
Harry walked into the robes shop, a bit overwhelmed at the sight of all of Madam Malkin's displayed wares, robes of different colors, lengths, and varieties.
Speaking of being an Auror, Harry was pretty sure this prick was breaking some sort of public indecency laws by the way he was sliding his hand further and further up Draco’s leg. Draco gently pried the man’s hand from his thigh, only for the stranger to laugh and reach over again, gripping it even more firmly.
Teddy had a family, though; Draco and Harry were going to make sure of that. Even if their now year-long relationship failed at any point, Merlin forbid, there was a solid unspoken agreement that they'd both care for Teddy, no matter what.
Draco let his lips quirk up at the corners, a thrill rolling through him as he noticed Potter’s eyes following the movement. He waited until the man’s green eyes latched onto his, letting the charged moment linger, static and palpable.
Luna nodded. “Fine. Deal.”
Harry shook his head. “Your feelings are valid—and understandable. But I promise, I’ll do everything in my power to protect you, and I always will.”
They spent the rest of the afternoon eating the cookies from Hermione and watching every comedy movie that didn't fill Harry with apathy, which was basically the ones he'd seen a million times over.
Ron and Hermione were two of the first people to call him "Harry." He made friends over the years at Hogwarts who called him by his first name, informally and friendly.
And with the way Granger was currently penetrating his very soul with just a look, he felt compelled to acquiesce.
Of course, she shouldn’t have expected her father’s killer to be so kind as to hand his body over to the proper channels.
Harry’s nostrils flared, just because he could. “What sort of game?”
'Oh, he's so devoted to you, Harry,' their voices saccharine, practically dripping with it. 'He just speaks so highly of you, so very smitten. You must be so happy together.'
"As if," Malfoy scoffed. "I'm graceful and dignified. You, however, have the gait and balance of a drunk erumpent."
Prompt: chemistry
Draco glared and Harry snickered.
Tell me how to do my best
Narcissa didn't cry when, many years later, when Lucius's breathing grew labored, his heart probably shriveled from Dark magic's aging qualities. She was stroking his hair for the first time in decades as he took his last breath, his pale eyes glassy and fearful.
I step away from my place in the middle.
No, for Draco, falling in love was like boiling a pot of water; no matter how many times he impulsively lifted the lid to check for bubbles, it appeared undisturbed until his back was turned, and then it was nearly overflowing.
What am I supposed to do?
"Do you want to watch?"
This is my favorite thing I've written, I think. So here's a sequel because I couldn't resist. It's based on a different Anna Nalick song called "Scars." Enjoy.
And one of them sat next to him on a barstool, looking at him like he'd lost the plot.
Hero from birth
He's done it before; he can do it again.
"ID?"
“Wait—you were pining for me?”
Blonde hair fell fanned out against the blanket and glittering gray eyes looked up at Harry. "Minerva let me into the wards just for the night."
"Do you really think the Aurors would ignore your disappearance? It's a priority—albeit low, considering they passed it off to the Death Eater."
“Do you have another one in mind?”
He scrambled around the room, opening every drawer, checking every carry-on, and scanning the area for the tiny velvet box. It wasn't in his trousers from yesterday, it wasn't in the sock drawer, it wasn't in the bathroom, it wasn't--
But they say
"Well spotted. Now you should probably get going; you wouldn't want to sully your reputation by being seen with me," Draco couldn't help the bitterness that laced his voice.
Harry pressed his lips together, nodding. "We do, if we're going to make it to the flat in Chicago."
Draco nodded. "Well, thank you for your help last night, Potter. I very much appreciate it."
"How?"
Draco flushed. "I, er, you didn't Owl me, and the letters I sent just got returned so I thought..."
“Okay, fine...I have a pet snake. I’m a really good cook. And Ginny’s the only Weasley I’ve dated.”
I laugh a little, and sit next to him on the bench, our thighs pressed together.
"Harry, you're not. I invited you to. I want you to come over if you'd like that. You can have the guest room if you want. Or we can share my bed if you'd rather not be alone."
The potion’s effect was hazier than a Pensieve, but this way he could see the memories from his own point of view; could relive it in his own skin. Still, his mind couldn't do justice to Harry's eyes, the bright sound of his laughter, the warmth of his skin.
"MALFOY?!" Ron clapped a hand over his mouth at his outburst, blushing almost as red as Harry as every eye in the Common Room turned to face them.
"Thanks, Malfoy."
Harry raced back to his ship. As he turned the keys and felt the engine growl back to life, a surge of adrenaline coursed through his body. He firmly steered the ship into the air and broke through Kuragin's atmosphere with a pop, racing through the sky.
All he knew was the steady grip of his hand around his wand while the other grasped at the newspaper, crinkling it in his palm. All he knew was raising it, closing his eyes, and breaking through layers of ancient magical wards to Apparate within the Ministry of Magic.
Draco scooted closer to Harry, tucking his hair into the crook of his neck. Harry wrapped his arm around Draco, not caring that it would eventually get tingly and numb.
"You don't know that. You don't know her."
The black-haired head nodded from its face-down position. "Gimme a second."
Draco clicked his tongue. "Not quite, darling. I know you can do better for me. Now, care to try again before I find someone else to fulfill me for the evening?"
As the night drew to a close, Harry's stomach twisted with nerves even as the rest of him yearned for sleep. He couldn't back to that bed--where she'd slept with him almost every night since he'd taken her home. It used to smell a little like her, no matter how many times Harry'd changed the sheets, she'd inevitably get her hair everywhere.
And every night, once his tears were dry and his throat was raw from screaming, Harry would conjure him water and whisper calming, grounding words. Harry would tell him he understood, that he knew nightmares like an old friend. And Harry would help him lie back, help his pillow seem less daunting.
And they both only counted the days.
here, and not her? Why’d you take this trip?”
Harry stared at the letter, brow furrowed.
Draco slumped against the sink, the tears now racking his body in convulsive sobs. He shook with the effort not to hyperventilate, but the dam broke within him, releasing months' worth of fear, desperation, and self-hatred.
Finally, the door opened. Pansy walked out, her smug smirk as wide as Draco had ever seen it, and her brown eyes sparkling as they bore into his like they wanted to extract all his secrets. Draco gulped.
He stood over Potter and saw green eyes grow wet. He wondered if Potter's tears were a sweet relief.
Potter stirred, then, and Draco froze.
"I'm sorry, Harry."
There, that's better.
The smell of lemongrass faded. Narcissa didn't reach across the bed anymore.
“Perhaps spending a little time in the cellar would jog your memory, hm? Don’t worry; there aren’t too many rats down there. I should know,” Luna thrilled at Lucius’s grimace.
“I’ll tell you what—”
Snow continued to fall in the clearing, covering up a trail of fresh paw prints that disappeared into the thick forest.
"Couples don't call each other by their surnames," Mal--Draco rolled his eyes. "We've got to be believable."
"Don't you have friends you'd consider to be your family? That you might even like better than your blood relatives?"
Harry chuckled but didn't respond. It was just getting to the baseball scene, and he didn't want to miss a moment.
"You really missed the whole point of the first movie, didn't you?"
Draco clutched the bathroom sink, resenting the sight of his tears dropping onto the porcelain. He scowled when they didn't erode the porcelain, that they weren't acidic after burning in his eyes. How unfair that only he should be the only one to feel this pain.
It occurred to him that, even after all this time, he still sought Potter’s approval. But he was hard-pressed to deny the 11-year-old boy inside him what he’d wanted since that fateful rejected handshake: the chance to prove himself.
One of the best parts of living in Godric’s Hollow was the stars.
“So—let me get this straight. In the, what, twelve hours since we’ve had this case, Little Red has not only murdered another neo Death Eater, but they’ve wrapped him in a red cloak and dumped him into a river? And he was found by a father and son who’d gone fishing?”
"Shhh," Harry leaned forward, rubbing a soothing hand over Draco's. "We'll make it okay. We'll figure this out together, alright?"
Dazed, Harry nodded. "Sounds good Malfoy."
“I like to make an entrance.”
Harry shakes his head. "No, ma'am, thank you. I'm sorry to bother you."
"And you call me Potter."
Father smiles. He walks leisurely toward the window, looking around the room. He stops at the glass pane, running his free hand over the curtains. “You know, Draco, this house has been passed down through generations of Malfoys.”
He flew around for most of the game, dodging Bludgers and Quaffles that crossed his path. No luck yet. He leaned down to increase his speed and hardly noticed that he passed another player, his counterpart on the opposite team, the other boy's white-blonde hair shining in the sun.
“I want to.”
It wasn't a smile; it was a grin.
Based on "New Years Day" by Taylor Swift, and for the drarry microfic prompt "when the party's over"
My throat dries as the image of my mother, alone and heartbroken, plays in my mind. “When did this start?” My voice is raspy, weak and foreign to my ears.
"I waited three hours. I figured that would be enough time for you to come to your senses, but you didn't come back, so I got worried."
Malfoy let out a laugh. "I don't think anyone would question that. Most people claim you're either dead or you've fucked off to the Muggle world—which is true enough, I suppose, they just think you're still on the continent."
Not for the first time that class, Harry regretted not sitting toward the back of the room. Malfoy was sat next to Parkinson at the table just behind them, and Harry knew it was unwise to turn one's back to one's enemy. It was much more prudent to stare at one's nemesis for as long as possible, using subtlety and stealth to make sure one's observations went undetected.
Draco rolled his eyes. “It’s not too hard when you realize the city’s on a grid system, Potter.”
Malfoy, who'd just lied to his own family to save Harry and his friends
“Of course not! You’re one of the strongest people I know, Draco, but asking you to relive that time in your life more than you already do…” Harry’s throat tightened.
Lucius narrowed his eyes. “Why are you here? To kill me?”
And all your too-wide grins.
I'm in the back of your mind.
Draco blushed. "Oh."
"I gathered that, Potter."
Summer in Manhattan was far hotter than outsiders would expect for a city in the Northeast; the air was sticky, making Draco’s hair curl at the bottom and Harry’s even messier than normal. The skyscrapers blocked the relief that locals would feel from the breeze.
Draco set down his fork, swallowing his bite of duck confit hash. “We’re currently in SoHo. I was thinking we’d walk around a bit, have lunch, and then go to the MoMa.”
Draco looked away. “I–I suppose I thought you wouldn’t want to stay,” he said, his voice quiet.
"Oh, I
He let his eyes drop to Potter’s lips.
The boy nodded. "Thank you, Potter." He turned to walk away.
, which tells him it's 6 in the afternoon.
With our blonde trapped in rooms
The person shook their head. "You're not who they wanted you to be, are you?"
It didn't matter, because even before the first bite, the first kiss, Harry's heart and his blood had belonged to Draco from the first time their eyes had met across the crowded Muggle bar.
"I'd say the issue is I'm paying too much attention to you, and not to what you're saying."
.....
I think you know what it’s like, to be underestimated. Overlooked. Even mocked. I can relate. Perhaps we are more alike than we think, Little Red.
Silver smiled. "Cori's been a good teacher, I see. And I use any pronouns. Claire uses she/her."
"It's just a few steps, Harry, honestly you are so impatient."
were drowned, muffled by the profound emotions that overwhelmed him.
Draco studied him for a moment. "You've had trouble sleeping?"
Draco let out a short, humorless chuckle. “You were in a coma for two days, Harry. The only reason they’re discharging you is that you’re going home with a Healer.”
"You do, I guess," Harry said quietly. "Just never...hear you say it, around me."
“Whose fault is that?”
I saw you today; you're not nearly as subtle as you think you are.
But the brunette rejected the shake
The other person, who had short blonde hair and blue eyes smiled at him. "Good to meet you, I'm Claire."
Draco nods. "Correct."
Now, exploration and expansion was still an accepted practice, but taking populated land from another group was strictly outlawed.
"Malfoy!!"
I imagine this vision sounds rather familiar; it's one with which you like to comfort yourself when you find yourself on the verge of a panic attack. You give yourself the respite of delusion, imagining a future in which you're not only alive, but you're thriving with everything you've ever wanted: true friends, stability, and
. He lets it wash away everything. He lets his heart fill with loneliness, familiar and cold.
Draco drops Potter's hand, whispers, "Please, don't forget me." He turns and runs.
So here I still am, in the middle, somewhere, watching everyone else as they work out where they were and where they are.
"Why?"
"I'll show you staring," Harry said, his eyes on Malfoy's lips. Quickly, he grabbed the front of Malfoy's robes and smashed their mouths together. Malfoy adapted quickly, wrapping his arms around Harry's neck to deepen the kiss.
“He’s come to end it, more like,” Pansy crossed her arms. “It’s time for you to go home, love.”
"You don't think being the in-laws of Harry Potter would give your parents some status," Harry spat. Draco's eyes widened.
I wish you could meet Draco, could know him. I think you'd get along; you're both written in the sky, but he's here, with me, in person. He holds my hand instead of my shoulder, and it's nice to feel him like an extension of myself.
Or from the wriggling bundle currently lodged underneath Harry's shirt.
Draco closed his eyes. "No, he didn't--he couldn't. It was so gratifying and even fun to flaunt my happiness in front of him, but at the same time he's..." Draco swallowed. "He's still my..." He resented the tears the welled up in his eyes, and the way his voice cracked.
I have signed this 1 May 1998.
Malfoy sighed. "Call it what you want, Potter, but you can't go around aimlessly your whole life. Well, you can, but I imagine even that gets awfully boring."
Draco's lips were perfectly parted, and Harry saw his chance. He stood abruptly from his knees and pulled Draco into a kiss.
"It's the Floo address of a Mind Healer. They'll be able to help you find...well, some other way to help your mental health."
Suddenly, he was startled by the crack of Apparation, his heart rate slowing when he saw Draco.
“Okay, Draco,” Harry whispered as they made their way out of the flat. “I’ve got you.”
Draco folded the note and tucked it back into his pocket. He looked up at the sky with a soft smile. He wondered if London had as much smog as New York. He thought about Pansy and Blaise, and their flat he hadn’t seen. He remembered the rainy weather and mild summers, compared to the sweltering heat of Midtown in July.
“What about your friends? Surely you’ve kept up with Parkinson and Zabini.”
Despite his disbelief, he jogs toward the bench to confirm his hopes, his worries. His breath catches in his throat when the figure stands and turns piercing, stormy grey eyes at him.
Draco's breath caught as he stared at Potter, who held out his hand invitingly. It was everything Draco'd wanted since he was 11—the chance to take Potter's willingly offered hand in friendship, or more if he were ever so lucky.
“What part of ‘I’ll monitor you from there’ don’t you understand?”
Draco'd furrowed his eyebrows but nodded in understanding. He'd stepped into the fireplace with a pinch of powder and was gone, wrapped in green flames.
I don’t know how to take this quest
say a word."
Draco started on makeup, having already washed and prepped his face. He’d shaved his eyebrows soon after starting drag, and he’d always been hairless on his face, so it only took a quick cursory glance over his face to make sure he hadn’t any hair to take care of.
This is the only place, the only way, I can think of you. When I'm out there, outside this door, I'm constantly fighting mental images of you. And when it becomes too much to bear, I remember our fights, the ones where I saw genuine sadness flash in your eyes instead of just irritation. It's painful to remember, every time, but if the Dark Lord decides to look into my mind at any given moment, I need him to see your hurt instead of my regret. Because if he knew the way I think about you, he'd make sure I never think again.
Dear Diary
Draco laughed. “Potter, unless I had the entire Malfoy vault at my disposal, it wouldn’t be practical to live by myself in a flat in Washington Square Park just after moving to the city. No, I had roommates for five years and have lived alone the last two.”
"She'll be in soon. I thought you might be a little less overwhelmed with just me here."
Harry flexes his fingers, watching the words that are etched into his skin stretch with the movement.
Harry burst out laughing, and Draco frowned. “As if that’s anything new! Draco, I want us to fight, I want us to make up, I want us to have good days and shitty days and days in between. Besides, there isn’t much either of us can do in a fight that we haven’t already done, is there?”
“Beats paperwork at the desk,” Ron said with a shrug. “C’mon, let’s face the music. The meeting starts soon.” They walked away, the newspaper left open on the desk.
"No, wait, tell me," guilt curled in Harry's stomach. "I want to hear. I'm listening now, I promise."
Draco smiled softly. "Of course. Why don't you gather your things? I'll wait here."
Still, Draco's words sparked a twinge of jealousy and even more heat to pool in Harry's groin. "Please Draco," his moan was breathier than he'd intended but if Draco's growl was any indication, it did the trick.
"Oh, lay off him, Pans," Ginny interjected, flicking her long red hair over her shoulder. "Harry, we're all here. What do you want to do?"
He considered his options. This was Lovegood, after all. She wasn’t the type to make him do anything that would put him in physical danger. More likely, she’d make him go look for nargles in the morning, or something. But if he chose truth...who knew the kind of question she’d ask him to reveal?
Draco grinned, bringing his lips down to Harry's for another kiss. The grandfather clock ticked away, counting the seconds until forever.
“Why not?”
He tried not to take too much offense to the way Potter stared at him in disbelief. He reached for his own water, just for something to do, letting the refreshing liquid calm his nerves.
His face was plastered on the cover of the newspaper, grinning from the cards of chocolate frogs, painted solemn and heroic in a painting in the Ministry.
I laugh and toss my cigarette to the ground, crushing the ash under my new dress shoes. "When have I ever?"
"Because I'm not a gourd!"
Ron glared. “Shut up, Malfoy. We didn’t see you, or we wouldn’t have come any closer in case being a prat is contagious.”
Draco valiantly ignored the twist in his chest when he looked across the room and saw Pot-Harry stumbling in his slow dance with Ginevra Weasley. They were laughing, their eyes crinkling in amusement as they found their rhythm.
When Taygete finally righted them and began to fly smoothly, Draco let himself look down, and his stomach dropped as Hogwarts got smaller and further behind them.
“It’s my turn, Riddle.”
I never chose
Draco sat, frozen, as shock rolled throughout his body, tingling his fingers and making his head feel fuzzy.
Draco nodded dumbly. "O-okay."
Finally, Cori looked at him with a satisfied smile. "There. Are you ready?"
A soft smile ghosted on Draco’s face. “Okay. I’ll see you later.”
Harry had a choice, at King’s Cross.
Harry was speechless for a moment, unable to do anything other than look at Draco, before he saw Draco brace himself and start to give Harry a resigned look.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes.”
Harry clenched his jaw, ignoring the worried expression on Hermione's face and the stormy one on Ron's, turning to Malfoy with a dark glare. "You bumped into me, and you know it."
Harry cast several detective charms on the enormous box. The words “Handle with Care” were stamped on it in large red letters. There wasn’t a return address, making the package all the more suspicious.
Did Granger write that speech for you? She must've, the little do-gooder. I'd wager she was torn between helping you save face and the cruel irony of eulogizing her schoolyard bully.
The stars at Hogwarts had been breathtaking, too. Harry would never forget the nights he had dragged Draco outside to talk and watch the sky without the constant hum of other students chattering in the Great Hall or even their respective friends’ interruptions and knowing looks.
Draco could only nod, but it was enough. Potter reached down and gave Taygete a pat on her side. "Let's go, Tay!"
“Ah, Lucius. You’ve come to tend to your old friend, eh?”
“Father, what are you—”
For example, I know you were in Diagon Alley sometime before you left. You sat at that bench outside Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes and you probably cast a cushioning charm. The people who go and sit on that bench and cast their own spells have no idea that they’re sitting on the last known traces of the Boy Who Lived’s magic in all of London. That spell you cast five years ago still lingers.
Harry let out a laugh “I’d love to see Luna write about a murderer; can you imagine?”
Harry looked at him with a raised eyebrow. “Feel better?”
“I dare you to give Harry a scalp massage.”
"First of all, are you alright? From your mission--I wouldn't put it past you to forego St. Mungo's in your haste to get here."
"I didn't get a response."
Harry clenched his jaw, his just-shed invisibility cloak dirtied on the forest floor. He ignored the Death Eaters surrounding Voldemort, instead staring at the man head-on.
set aside her textbooks to play these games each Saturday night.
Being bitten was unlike any pleasure Harry'd ever known; teetering on the knife's edge of life and death and knowing he was safe in Draco's arms, under his teeth, no matter which side he ended up on, whether his heart was still beating afterward.
. Draco couldn't go there, wouldn't. Harry promised and he always kept his promises.
"You didn't answer my question."
"You mean you'll be beautiful. I'm going to be a stumbling mess."
"You've just had surgery, you've got to take it easy. No more snogging until you're recovered."
headlines will fade; statues lose their shine.
You said nine months. I said ten. We bickered, then we argued, then we shouted. I showed you the calendar with our first date blocked out ten months ago. You threw up your hands. You said,
Because I'm not there, am I? I'm tucked away in the shadows, right? I should be ineffectual, emasculated, soul sucked from my body by Dementors that ravage me.
It used to bother Draco; it used to make him long for home, for his old life, for change.
Harry glared at them. "Nuh-uh. Uh cuh tuk."
Draco laughed and laced their fingers together. “Alright, Harry. Let’s go home.”
"It's not pity!" Harry's voice rose defensively, his blood boiling. "I didn't fight a war just so that everyone would go back to hating each other."
"No I--" Harry hesitates. "Actually, if you see him soon, just--tell him to Owl me."
Luna snorted. “
When guilt and depression and sadness had Draco in their clutches, Harry’s arms were an anchor to reality, the whispers in Draco’s ear were a soothing balm to his scarred and wounded mind, the optimism a relief to his tender heart.
"I know your job has its risks, Harry, but the least you can do is not create them for yourself. You said the Sorting Hat nearly put you in Slytherin; some self-preservation would be good for you."
Ron snorted. “Yeah, ‘m not sure why the Prophet finds out about these murders before the Aurors; it’s embarrassing. Anything in the Quibbler?”
"No, Harry,
And every morning when I woke up next to you, I'd walk into the kitchen and look at the clock to make sure that time had passed.
To the untrained, unknowing ear, Parseltongue sounded like hissing.
, trying to let the
“I’m sorry—come again?”
"Oh? What is it?"
Taygete shot into the air; the wind whipped back Draco's hair and was almost sharp against his bare skin, but as they moved further up to the starry sky, he focused on Potter's steady breathing against him and his heart pounding in his own chest.
Malfoy looked at him in confusion as Harry reached into his pocket and handed him his wand, stifling a chuckle when Malfoy’s eye widened.
here."
Malfoy's lips were soft, warm. His hands squeezed lean hips. Nimble fingers gripped his hair.
Malfoy took a step closer. "I
Later, Draco revealed a treacle tart, "courtesy of the Hogwarts house-elves," with a lit candle stuck in the center. "Make a wish, Harry!"
Harry was startled out of his reverie by the sudden announcement, as well as by Ron, who nudged him and gestured to Hermione, whose head was still bent over her desk as she wrote furiously.
Harry watched as Malfoy froze, his hands gripping the wood; the other boy let out a low, deep chuckle as he drew his wand and turned around to face Harry.
Draco spun around and turned his scowl on Potter, wiping the wetness from his tender cheeks.
Draco felt the tears welling in his eyes as he glanced around the room. He could feel Potter staring at him in shock, lips parted as if about to speak.
Anger rose sharply in Harry’s chest, twisting and ruthless.
Harry’d insisted on keeping plenty of pictures, both magical and Muggle, around the house. There were moving pictures of all their friends and family–Ron, Hermione, the entire Weasley clan, Andromeda, Teddy, and Harry’s parents. For Draco’s part, there was Narcissa and his found family, Cori, Claire, Silver, Pansy, and Blaise.
“Potter! Stop your incessant snowball throwing! You’ll break the windows!”
Still, even Harry's brilliant smile wasn't enough to distract from the obvious slight anticipation in Harry's deep green eyes.
Sometimes, when it’s been a particularly long and stressful day of searching for you, I go and sit on that bench, just to feel your magic, to remember that you exist. The
“Another murder?” Harry took the newspaper and read over the headline: LITTLE RED STRIKES AGAIN: NEO DEATH EATER FOUND DEAD, WRAPPED IN RED CLOAK
He chuckled darkly. “Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice and, well…I really shouldn’t be surprised.”
And so remember when it’s done and said
I hate you 'cause it hurts.
Draco sat up with a start. "If one of us is undeserving of this relationship, it isn't you. I never, for one moment, want you to doubt that."
"Packing already?"
Harry pushed Malfoy against the tile wall and locked the bathroom door with a casual flick of his fingers, watching with satisfaction as Malfoy's eyes went wide and dark.
“But I’m fi-!” The last word was cut off as Harry hissed through another spark of pain.
“Dad?”
"Tuhs eehehn fenheh!"
"Yes. Can we go to your bedroom?"
“I don’t know my way around here.”
"D'you, uh, want some tea?"
Draco had to admit, the redesign was an improvement. The jade green of the S inlay stood out against the silver doors of the locket.
"Nothing, I just...Me too."
Draco pressed into Harry, kissing him gently to stop his ranting. “It’s alright love. We’ll keep her. I’m sure we can figure out how to train her, seeing as neither of us has ever owned a cat.”
"Tarasque," Draco said, not glancing away. "Call me Tarasque."
"Now, now, Potter, that wasn't very polite of you. I was rather enjoying my dance partner."
"POTTER!!"
Harry shook his head. “What happened to not wanting to talk?”
Harry's gut twisted—with guilt, with bitterness. "How do you know that?" He spat, more angrily than he'd mean to.
Finally, the hospital wing came into focus, and Draco remembered.
A knock at the door disrupted Draco's thoughts just as he was picking up his book. He frowned, a little miffed. He'd just been getting to the good part, where the two boys were about to drive off into the sunset together. He couldn't be arsed to take off his reading glasses when he answered the door.
“Hey, enough!” Harry snapped. “Draco, why don’t you take your father and go home.”
Draco jumped, turning to see a half-naked man in his bed. Said man was sleeping on his stomach, but Draco only needed to see the messy black hair, tanned skin and the curve of his spine to know who it was.
Malfoy licked his lips and looked up at Harry through his lashes before wrapping his mouth around his cock.
I used to think that you adored the attention of the press. But then again, I used to believe a lot of things; you convinced me I was wrong about nearly every one of them.
“Merlin, you were right.”
There was a pause. Then,
Pansy was as close to a biological sister as they'd ever had. Cori, like Draco, used they/them pronouns, but while Draco was he/him out of drag, Cori identified as nonbinary in their real life, too. Silver was nonbinary, too, but they used all pronouns.
Outside, the sun rose over the horizon, its rays illuminating a lush green forest and bringing the dawn of a new day.
Harry woke to the sound of muffled voices shouting at each other and the constant beep of a monitor.
When he didn’t answer, Draco came up and put a hand on his shoulder.
Harry's hands shook, whether from rage or the shock of his heart breaking in real time, he didn't know.
“I’ll admit it. I didn’t know you had it in you, Lovegood. You and your father were always…”
Draco sighed. "No, no I'm sorry. In my exaggerated teasing, I see how I might've struck a nerve."
When the show ended, Draco and Cori sat at their mirror while Cori applied powders and liquids he'd looked at with curiosity on his mother's vanity. While Cori didn't let him look in the mirror until they were finished, he loved the sensation of the brush against his skin and felt himself transform into something new, yet familiar. As if something had been living dormant in his skin, just waiting to be revealed.
He shook his head. "No, Draco,
Draco was grateful for the chatter that filled the room with some sense of normalcy, but his chest clenched when he noticed the conspicuous silence at his own table. The first years were clearly terrified, huddled together at the end of the table, while the older students ate dutifully, their expressions blank, emotionless. He swallowed the guilt that rose in his throat like bile.
"No, no Malfoy wait it's not safe. Clearly someone has it out for you and I can help you figure it out--"
Draco rolled his eyes. “Oh don’t be such a baby. You should’ve answered faster.” He cast a quick
“Sure, you weren’t,” she said, rolling her eyes.
Suddenly, the door was opened and then promptly slammed shut. “Honestly, the nerve of these people. If he needs bed rest, then where is better than his own bed? Is my Healer degree rendered meaningless the moment I’m off the clock?” Draco muttered, running a hand through his hair as he paced the room angrily.
"So what would this mean, exactly?"
Harry didn't care about the grass ticking his skin, or the tiny bugs flying above his head as he lay on the ground in front of the Black Lake. He didn't mind the humidity or the fact that his left leg was falling asleep. He didn't care about his cheek getting dirty or his neck straining from turning so long in the same direction.
He reached into his frayed pocket, retrieving his wand. He smiled when the magic still responded to his lifeless form, the force just as supple and bright as the day he tasted power for the first time.
“Is anyone blackmailing you into this? Or forcing you?” Harry’s tone was guarded, professional.
Draco bowed his head slightly. “Thank you, Potter.”
After the war, Narcissa knelt before the fireplace, scraping up the ashes there with a shovel the way she'd seen the house-elves do before many times. She could use her wand; she wasn't the one with limited magic. But she wanted to see it, the remnants of chaos.
"Why are you so surprised?"
A hand wrapped around Harry's wrist. "Don't."
“Excuse me, I’ll not be mistaken for someone with such atrocious romantic taste, no matter how good Weasley is at Wizard’s Chess.” Draco brushed a small piece of wood from his robes and ran a hand through his hair to shake out the dust.
With a sigh, he swung his legs over the side of the bed and planted his feet on the ground.
This is Harry's POV. Enjoy.
The night Harry Potter died, a single set of footprints lead into the ocean. By the next day, the tide had washed it away.
Kudos and comments make my heart sing!
Harry grinned. "Can we continue this discussion over the breakfast table?" He wriggled out of Draco's embrace and jumped out of bed before offering his hand to Draco.
Potter raised an eyebrow. “Do you actually care about the answer to that question?”
away, hoping Draco could forgive him.
Harry, you made a rebel out of me. I never thought I'd be making love proclamations and ending wedding contracts and willingly standing in the middle of the rain but nothing with you has ever made sense but it's always felt right. You're mine. You're the best thing that's ever happened to me and I refuse to do anything but love you, forever."
I never chose
Scorpius gazed up at them with wide, curious blue eyes. His blonde curls were so soft against Draco's palm as he supported the baby's head. His smile was as infectious and heart-wrenching as Harry's, and Draco grinned as he blinked back the tears forming in his eyes.
Harry tightened his grip. “Conversation’s over. If I catch you trying to ‘talk’ to him again, I’ll make sure you have a nice chat with the Wizengamot about sexual assault. Now, apologize.”
And how it always seems to work
You put your hand on my shoulder. You squeezed it gently and you said, "No matter where I am, I'll always be with you, right here," and you patted that spot on my shoulder with your warm, calloused hand.
I sincerely hope you are; existing, that is. Others have given up hope. I’ve read every theory printed in the
Draco lifted his nose in the air. "That's because I excelled at everything."
Hands shaking, Harry poured the vial into the basin, the cloudy substance stirring with the addition. Once it settled, he took a breath, closed his eyes, and let himself fall.
It's incredibly stupid to imagine such things. Because even in a world of magic, the most fantastical vision I can conjure is one in which I'm worthy of being saved by you.
I glance and see the piece of paper with Potter's Floo address written in his scrawl. That one hastily torn scrap gives me more joy, more excitement than one word I've painstakingly written here.
Prompt: mirror, mirror
"Stil...I hated it. I don't believe those things anymore, Potter, you have to know that."
Harry, I love you; I've been in love with you since the day we met, but I think I realized it around fourth year.
Potter’s eyebrows furrowed in deep confusion. “I’m sorry—what is
Finally, to Draco Malfoy, I leave your wand (thanks for that by the way), and this snitch. It's not too late.
Prompts: unsent letter; cheater
And how you take your tea.
"C'mon mate," Ron said, tugging at Harry's sleeve. "Let's take the long way."
He and Ron ventured outside, through the courtyard and into the open area beside the lake. Harry felt a surge of victory and relief at the sight of Malfoy sitting on the bench, his head tilted back with a soft smile as if enjoying the warmth on his face. His hair glittered golden in the sun.
You still look like me.
Or maybe it was jealousy that he was confined to the Manor awaiting the end of his trial while Draco and his Mother had been acquitted due to Harry's testimony.
But for the first time since being trapped in the dark dungeons of Malfoy Manor, Luna was running out of faith.
Two people came up to them, both with friendly smiles and expectant looks at Cori.
The potter’s field was just as she’d left it; the graves were still identical and neatly spaced. She walked through the gate and surveyed the scene before sitting on the ground, not caring about dirtying her cloak.
Harry huffed. “You need to work on your bedside manner, Healer Malfoy.”
Prompt: 2am
"Potter! Pay attention."
"Watch where you're going, Scarhead." Malfoy sneered at Harry, bumping their shoulders together as they passed by.
Harry jumped, his head jerking up to see Draco looking at him blankly, which made Harry's stomach twist with guilt. Draco made his face unreadable when he was internally panicked.
Being a Ministry-hired Explorer meant a life of solitude, but Harry wouldn't have it any other way. There was nothing quite like the rush of finding a completely uninhabited planet, imagining all the ways his country could improve the lives of its citizens.
There was that scowl again. "Don't be a git about it."
I float to the door, turning to look at you once more, to remember you like this.
But who is this person?
"Every time I tell people the foods I don't like, they get all indignant and huffy," Harry waved a hand. "It's so weird. Like I've offended them by disliking meringue."
“I’m not your enemy here, Harry. Your friends are worried about you. I’m worried about you.”
I want to keep surprising you. I want to see how many times I can bring unexpected joy into your life, whether I'm bringing you coffee at that bookshop you want to open, or whisking you off to Paris for a weekend getaway.
I hate it how you balk
The other boy nodded. "Yes. It's a strange story, actually. My Father fought for...the other side, so I was required to take the Dark Mark. But, let's just say that I realized soon after that my Father had signed me up for something I had no business belonging to. So then I kept out of it as much as possible--until I saw you were still alive, and I knew I had to help." He shrugged. "So, might I have it back?"
Pansy gave him a knowing look. “You were staring at him again.”
"What–what are you—no! Malfoy, I'm going to get help—"
For the fearfest prompt: "they've killed before, they'll kill again!" Warning below, so ignore if you don't want spoilers:
Draco leaned in to sniff at Harry's neck and Harry smirked as he felt the telltale bulge of Draco's thickening cock; Harry knew that the smell of Harry's blood through his skin was enough to make Draco half-hard.
A burst of light zoomed through the night sky. Harry closed his eyes and wished.
“Where are you staying?”
Draco's heart sank. "Potter, I sincerely apologize if, in my inebriated state, I was, er, less than--"
“I dare you to let me give you a haircut.”
They stared and they spied
The pounding at Harry’s door was incessant to the point that he knew he could no longer ignore it. With a sigh, he threw the covers off his body, resenting the chill that hit his legs and vowing to return to his cocoon as soon as the interloper had fled his wrath.
It used to be biting, cruel, and full of insults. But now, when it was just the two of them on the couch, his head on Draco’s lap with long fingers carding through his hair, Harry loved when Draco would just talk endlessly. He’d go on and on about his job, the latest gossip courtesy of Pansy, his mother—any and everything, and Harry couldn’t get enough.
He glanced up at the full moon shining in approval, letting the wind blow back his hair. He looked at Harry's messy head with fondness; the high-speed winds certainly wouldn't do that hair any favors.
"Hey! Hey, Draco, I want to. We're a team, babe. Let me be there for you."
“Ron, he’s not worth it. C’mon.” Harry said, eyes narrowed at Malfoy in a clear warning.
And I'm far from it--perfect--but you still inspire me to be better every day. I know I'm not the most...forthcoming with my more vulnerable emotions; you've always worn your heart on your sleeve while I tried convincing myself and the world that I didn't have one.
“You’re awake, thank Merlin,” Draco approached the side of the bed, relief replacing the shock on his face.
A small smile took over Draco's face. "Oh, that's alright then."
I've no plans to leave, Draco, but I'm here for however long this lasts. For as long as you'll have me.
He let the light of the glowing neon sign draw him inside. He suppressed a bubble of relieved laughter that rose in his chest when the bouncer gave him a bored look and matter of factly asked for his ID.
Harry’s face fell. “You can’t be serious.”
Draco liked his men with both shoes on right, thanks ever so.
Cori smiled. "Then there you are." They leaned back in their chair and looked past Draco. "Silver! Claire! C'mere, I wanna introduce you to someone."
. Some say you’re off living as a Muggle, and some believe you’re still here and walking around under your Invisibility Cloak. Others have presumed you to be dead. Granger and Weasley tell me you’d enjoy the way the media is largely ignoring you now, aside from publishing any random claim of having spotted you somewhere.
Harry grinned. "I'd love to."
"How'd you find me?"
"Draco, it's okay. That's normal. It's okay to love and hate him."
And, when paired with Malfoy's mischievous gray eyes and taunting sneer, it made Harry's blood boil.
He squeezed his eyes shut tight before he opened them, blinking as the unfamiliar room came into focus. He could feel his pulse pounding in his head as his mind raced in a heady mix of confusion and anxiety. What happened? Why wasn't he in his flat?
I walk and when I bump into another rushing figure, I am filled with dread, with anticipation. An apology is on my lips, first for the jostle, and then probably for crimes I didn't commit but witnessed and was too powerless to stop. Not that that matters, to them. And with the actor not available to repent, an accomplice is the next best thing.
It is a testament to my respect for Healer Rostova that I'm writing this letter. Honestly, years ago—when I was you, I suppose—I'd have thought that this exercise was for mentally ill people who were stuck ruminating on the past.
Potter's hand is warm on Draco's arm as they make their way outside. The stars watch over them, greedy and protective.
“Luna, you can’t—”
And yet, Harry didn't have any complaints.
wants to print, it wasn’t some dramatic falling out. We just realized we liked being friends more than we liked being a couple. We love each other, but not like a married couple is supposed to.”
Harry's smile faltered, but it jumped into place. "What do you want, Malfoy?"
No, Harry knew all too well that Parseltongue was like the wind created by a dagger flying past his ears, whispered threats and atrocities that kept him wide awake at night. The words spoken so softly echoed endlessly in his ears.
"Draco?"
"But--" Ron's protests were cut off by a now embarrassed and frustrated Hermione, who pulled Ron over to the Gryffindor table as Malfoy pulled Harry outside.
Harry felt pained, a lump rising in his throat. "I was...Just, give me a second." He felt around in the suitcase once more, checking the only pocket he hadn't opened. He was filled with relief once his hand clasped the box. He pocketed it quickly.
"Is it real?"
In a way, this was almost better; as much as Luna itched to alert the Aurors to her father’s murder, it could lead them to Little Red. And she couldn’t stop now—especially not now.
Harry rushed to his bathroom, pointedly ignoring his bed as he passed through his bedroom. He shoved his toiletries into a bag Hermione'd given him before the Horcrux hunt and then met Draco in the living room.
, beats my traitorous heart.
When Harry approached them when they were still dressed as Tarasque, Draco'd hoped he wouldn't recognize his old school rival. But he just chuckled.
One is on his forehead, the rejection of Death.
Seamus let out a giggle. "Ginny. She—" he hiccupped. "She cast
"WHERE'S 'HERE'?"
Potter’s smile shook him from his thoughts. “Prat. I meant that you were right—Ginny’d have been shocked. I think she’d have liked it, in the end, but that is not what I thought it was.”
Harry grabbed him by his sopping shirt and pulled him in for a kiss that warmed them both to their cores.
A little prequel to Chapter 1!
But Kuragin would be a prize; Harry was lucky to have reached it before a rival Explorer from another planet got his greedy, posh little hands on it.
"Why should I, Potter? You've interrupted a perfectly peaceful afternoon."
Harry huffed in exasperation. “I’m bloody depressed, Draco! Can’t you see that?”
Draco turned to look at Harry and squeezed his hand. Harry squeezed back, twisted around to turn off the lamp, and returned to pull Draco into his arms.
“Draco? Can I come in?” Draco smiled softly. After all this time together, Harry was still so respectful of Draco’s space when getting in and out of drag.
But it wasn't.
at all.”
Draco, who might--just might--love Harry.
Draco was still awake, listening to the slow, steady breathing of his new roommates as they slept peacefully. He studied the drapes that hung around him, taking in the view from what would be his bed for the next year. With a pang, he remembered his bedroom in the Manor, with its light blue walls and dignified antique furniture that had been passed down from both the Malfoy and Black families for generations.
Father taught him that no one achieves great power without selfishness; he’d learned that the only way to reach new heights was to put one’s interests first and foremost, and that success was found only by those who were willing to let others fear them.
“Draco. Truth or dare?”
"Then why am I here."
He sincerely hoped the next generation of wizards wouldn't fall in love with someone who was engaged to be married.
She sat for a moment more and then stood, wiping her cheeks. She turned and walked out of the graveyard, wrapping her cloak tight around her shoulders.
“You ‘just’ what, Potter?”
"Do you even like me?" Harry blurted that night once they'd stepped inside their flat.
"Good," Harry said with a grin.
Draco jerked his arms up and down, keeping them in the air. “Up! Help me up, you great oaf!”
She sighed. “Yes, Harry,” she said quietly. “I’m Little Red.”
“She’ll still be tried for those as planned, but Little Red’s have been expunged from her record. Besides, we have bigger problems now.”
“Harry, it’s alright. I’m glad to help.” Draco’s jaw was clenched.
By the time the server left, Draco had made his decision.
After all, as long as he had a pulse, sperm for insemination, and a sound enough mind to sign over half his vaults, he'd have done his duty as her future husband as far as she was concerned.
He is Potter.
nods my head.
And maybe for a while I had some fun
Well, in
Harry waggled his eyebrows. “I can think of a few ways to pass the time.”
away.
"Something I don't already know about you."
Potter just shrugged and took a sip of wine. “Your turn.”
He knew that the red and gold curtains that hung around his bed meant that he was in Gryffindor, and he mentally thanked the magical hat for not sorting him into Slytherin with that Malfoy git.
8. He’s the biggest dork I know. He’s constantly making strange jokes and puns, and he always has some odd new activity he wants to try. He roped me into making a hybrid of a cake and a tart and I’d never admit it but I’ve kept the recipe all these years.
before the world had faded to black.
"Harry, have you been sleeping on the couch?" His voice was even and calm.
Nor are you all that good at picking up on social cues—that is, of course, assuming you're not blatantly ignoring them in favor of stalking me.
"Yes, I do."
Draco gave him a tight smile. “Sure, of course.”
Draco's eyes roamed the crowd until they found Cori, Claire, Silver and Pansy chatting at a back table, laughing as if they'd known each other for ages. Draco felt a swell of pride. They'd been relieved, when Draco'd introduced Pansy to their drag family, that the family Draco had chosen got on well after just a few weeks of knowing one another.
The other boy hesitated for a moment. His face shifted to one of determination as he stepped toward Harry and clasped their hands together, their arms now connected to form a single line between them.
"Yes, I think it rather does."
Another fic based on "Gravity" by Sara Bareilles bc I was dissatisfied with the first one lol

"Ow!"
Okay, so! I never planned on adding to this series, but my friend submitted the @drarrymicrofic prompt "discord," and her support for this series is so sweet and wonderful that when I thought of this idea, I knew I had to write it.
Malfoy gestured around them. "I'm here, aren't I?"
Harry entered the room, eyes widening when he saw Draco. “Merlin,” he said breathily. “No matter how many times I see you as Tarasque, I don’t know if I’ll get over how incredibly sexy you look.”
But now, as he stared up at the ceiling, his new roommates sleeping soundly around him, he found himself able to calm his exhilarated mind enough to rest.
Voldemort smirked. “Only trying to give you the childhood memories you never had, Potter. It’s the least I can do, really.”
Harry scowled. “They couldn’t check on me themselves, so they sent you? The cowards.”
He raised an eyebrow “So...are you going to tell me what you want? Or am I going to go back to my flat?”
Luckily, their server approached them with two glasses of ice water and pretended not to notice the way Potter drank it greedily. While Potter recovered, Draco flashed the server a charming grin and ordered a bottle of wine. The waiter nodded quickly and disappeared into the kitchen.
"Watch where you're going, Scarhead." Malfoy sneered at Harry, bumping their shoulders together as they passed by.
Potter lifted his head, stirring from his sleep and blinking blearily. Draco braced himself for the impending wide eyes and scream of shock and disgust, but it never came.
Harry glanced in the mirror once more, this time seeing Draco standing next to him. He pulled Draco close to him and pressed a kiss to his forehead before Draco nuzzled wordlessly into his neck, eyes closed.
Draco smiled at a picture of their friends, reminding them to continue their makeup process.
“Harry it’s been six months since you left the Aurors. Can you say you’re any happier now than you were then?”
Malfoy lifted an eyebrow. "I'll show you the day after tomorrow."
Draco reached into the bag and cast a few charms on a small object, enlarging it to its regular size; Harry recognized it as a wicker basket.
Harry let his gaze fall to Malfoy's groin, where his cock pressed an obvious bulge in his tight trousers. Harry's mouth watered.
“Harry Potter. We meet again.”
“Malfoy?”
Not mollified but still compliant, Potter sits on the bench. I watch recognition take over his features. Then he looks at me in surprise. "So, you..."
For example, I once thought I’d be an up-and-coming political figure; the youngest Wizengamot member in a century, heading several charitable organizations and waving off speculation of a campaign for Minister.
Finally, after yet another night of hearing about how 'clearly besotted he is with you Harry, you're so lucky,' he'd had enough.
Potter wrinkled his nose. “I’m not really much for museums.”
Malfoy huffed. "It's not as if I can force you to come back, Potter. I've done my job, which was to make sure you were still alive and not being held captive somewhere against your will. I've done that. I can go back to the Auror department and tell them that you're not in any danger."
"No, but today is July 1st, and we're celebrating your birth month."
Harry didn’t turn around, let another plate fall and break.
thinks my curious mind.
"Oh yeah? Like who?"
Harry's eyes were shining. Draco hardly heard him when he whispered, "To the ends of the earth."
"Malfoy--Draco, what feelings?"
Prompt from @bubble-gumhead: "I'm pretty fond of you when you're not around."
Draco stood near the hostess stand, smiling indulgently at the woman behind it. She grinned in response.
Draco needn’t look further than the man next to him, tangible and real, for what he used to seek beyond the clouds.
Harry brought the glass to his lips and tipped his head back, letting the liquid burn a trail down his throat and settle in his stomach, already calming his nerves. He blinked and looked back at the dancing pair when finally the blonde man turned his head to kiss his dance partner.
"So I'm in a Muggle hospital?"
"I suppose there really is only one way to get through to cheaters like you.
“Marry, shag, or kill Flitwick, Slughorn, and Filch.”

Draco tried not to grimace as he climbed into a pathetic excuse for a bed. The comforter was more of a sheet than anything else, and the linens were like sandpaper against his delicate skin. He lay his head against the scratchy pillow and stared at a blank, foreign ceiling for the 60th night.
There was a knock on Draco's bedroom door.
But no, not quite.
Harry watched with a small smile as Malfoy and his mother sat together, their cool masks wavering with emotion for just a second before shifting back into place.
"We're not dead, are we?" Pansy asked, wiping away slime from her cheeks. "Potter, you're the death expert, is this the afterlife? Or am I actually covered in ghost guts?"
That's when Potter had leaned down from the beast and presented his hand and said, "Do you trust me?"
.....
Draco felt something foreign unfold in his chest; it was desperate, unstoppable.
"It's alright, you were trying to help."
The door to Draco's room swung open. He jumped from his position at his desk, his heart dropping to his stomach when he saw Bellatrix's looming figure, her face twisted in her signature cross between a devilish grin and a sneer. He cast a quick Vanishing spell and his letter, his salvation, his one chance, disappeared into thin air.
The glass shattered against the wall with a satisfying crack. Adrenaline coursed through Harry’s veins as he picked up a china plate and let it slip through his fingers and clatter to the floor, breaking into pieces. The rush was almost intoxicating, thrilling him to destroy it all. Make the cupboard empty, make it not crowded, not cramped, not full of things more breakable than him, things more precious and valuable, things more important than him—
Sighing with relief at his solitude, he approached the railing and leaned against it, looking out over the city. It was busy tonight, the classical music from inside the ballroom contrasting with the symphony of traffic below. He resisted the urge to cast a
Anyway, Granger has been rather helpful. One of the facts I was able to absorb from her ranting was that, according to Muggle science, energy can neither be created nor destroyed. It can change forms, can be converted and shaped into something other than what it once was, but it is constant.
Harry glared a little. "I can teach you to cook, I just can't explain why everything works the way it does. Here, let's make something simple, like pasta."
She waved a hand dismissively. “He’s your problem, now. Just get him out of my flat and back home intact, will you?” She didn’t wait for him to respond, walking away into another room.
“Dare.”
"Draco, do stop staring. It is unbecoming."
He sat next to Ron, who was watching Hermione take notes with machine-like speed and precision. While the sight of Hermione in action was entertaining for a minute or so, Harry didn't understand why Ron stared at her all the time.
That night, I dream of standing in the middle of a tunnel. Potter is on one side, extending a hand and beckoning me to his side. On the other side, there is familiar darkness waiting to fold me into its cool, misty arms.
They tell me I’m the Chosen One
He glares at me but continues. “You were going to live here with Astoria, one day. You were to be the next generation to carry on this proud Malfoy tradition. But I suppose,” his free hand grasps the curtain. “Everything has its end.”
"Ihh me, ahee."
He doesn't have to wait as long as Hermione to unwrap the bandage. It's red and tender, and he's almost tempted to use a healing spell to speed up the process, but he doesn't. He can wait.
A bright light came into view, making Harry squint as he opened his eyes.
Let the seasons change as they may, as long as we face them together.
“Now, Potter, it’s not a competition. I think we’re too old and too tired for that, don’t you?” Draco said, his tone light but still chastising. He signaled the bartender for a drink, and he downed the neat Firewhiskey in one gulp the moment the glass slid into his palm.
I’m not sure whether Xeno was a good man or not, but he sure was fun to kill.
Harry rose from his chair and dashed out of the room. He barely heard Draco calling, "The bathroom's the other way, Harry!"
He nodded his thanks at Lyssa, who turned to look in the main dining room. Relieved to have a moment to himself, he ran a hand over his face and closed his eyes. He could do this. He could have dinner with Potter. He would not let himself be flustered.
"At least Dumbledore isn't trying to commit genocide! Voldemort has killed and will kill again, and you know it."
"Did you really expect me to go with you? To leave my mother by herself after my father was carted off to Azkaban for the rest of his life? Leave the job I'd had to work my arse off to get? Leave what few friends I had and made after the war?"
So. Firewhiskey it was.
The other boy winced. "I was going to walk away, but you sounded so...I couldn't just...I'm sorry, Draco. I didn't give you a chance to explain."
His mouth twisted into a wry grin; gone was the goofy, easy smile Draco'd resented from their youth. In its place was this amused grimace that filled its targets with dread.
“What are you saying, Harry?” Draco asked, his voice low and even.
As Granger cast the incantation, Draco looked at Potter, who was fidgeting in his spot, clearly anxious. He then glanced at Pansy, who, refreshed by the sobering charm, had that glint in her eye that made Draco’s blood thrum with anxiety.
Draco blushed. “It's New Year’s.”
“I, er, just figured you’d be living off your inheritance.”
“Really? It doesn’t really seem like her...taste.”
"Finally, I was starting to think Granger was wrong."
Or until Harry couldn't take it anymore and finally kissed him.
Harry turned onto his side to stare out the window, marveling at the novelty of sleeping somewhere with a view other than cramped, blank walls.
Harry laughed humorlessly. "A bit late for that, I'd say."
“You’re mental.”
I hope that someone shares your heart
Just to make their opponent irate.
The rest of that sentence, they both knew, was
Harry shook himself. "Wait, back up--what did you say?"
“Bloody Gryffindor,” Draco muttered. “But as established, you’re not on the force any longer.”
My moment in the spotlight came and went, the luminous beam generally ignoring me in favor of making the dark hiss and cower, and letting the heroes bask in it, their skin shining. I neither cowered nor shone. I was lit by the brightness until I was not; it swung to another target.
"Are you?"
All four of them switched on their proton streams. Ginny merged hers with Harry's first, followed by Pansy, and then finally Draco until they had made one bright stream of protons. Harry grunted as he aimed the stream toward the ghost, catching it in its path.
Draco waved a hand. “Go ahead.”
Malfoy merely cocked his head and looked at Harry with the same irritating little knowing smirk.
"What about love? Can I call you love?"
The earth was dry beneath his dirt-caked fingertips as he clawed his way through the soil, pulling himself up and out of the grave he'd known for longer than he could remember.
"Nothing good ever happens after 2am"
Malfoy barged in, smirking in a way that sent a familiar jolt down Harry's spine. "Just here to see how the Savior's holding up. Honestly, Potter, this is a bit sacrilegious, isn't it? Living in the house that should belong to a proper Pureblood?"
Draco sighed. “I think about it every time I glance down at my forearm. At least this way, some good might come of it. I want to help.”
Harry grinned and turned back to Draco. “They’ll be alright without me. C’mon, let’s go home. I’ll make us some tea, yeah?”
Draco hoped the flames would be kind enough to swallow him quickly, but with the way that the lifeless furniture and dusty baubles around him seemed to cry out in pain, he felt his skin prickle in anticipation.
Draco focused on the champagne that slid easily down his throat. Next to him, Astoria quirked an eyebrow, her small smile both amused and questioning. He set down the glass and reached over to squeeze her hand once, allowing her to return the gesture before pulling back.
Instead, Potter smiled. “Morning, Draco. Happy New Year.”
Harry closed his eyes and took a deep breath. He held his wand firmly in his hands, letting the magic course through his body one last time.
He wondered what Astoria would say if she could see him now. If their current level of communication as soon-to-be-weds was any indication, their marriage contract was more of a business venture than a romantic one.
But right now, watching Potter be with someone—conspicuous and unashamed—Draco could only feel the icy grip of regret around his heart.
Potter dropped to the cold tile floor with a scream. Draco tasted acid as he watched the other boy writhe in pain as the spell wracked his body, an agony Draco knew well.
"You don't think I understand that? Of course I do! I can't fault you for being a loyal partner, Harry, but running into a hostage situation without calling for backup is the absolute dumbest thing you could've done! You nearly died!"
He turns on a heel and walks away. The rain is cleansing. He doesn't use a drying charm, doesn't cast an
Be less clear
But your magic cannot be created or destroyed, it simply is.
It would be easy to send Potter away. It would preserve his pride, that's for certain. And perhaps Draco of 18 hours ago would've done just that.
"Er...you're angry?"
"I'll show you a subtle bone..."
“Yes, Ron gave Robards the full briefing. You’re not expected in the office until a Healer permits it.”
Draco scoffed. "You don't know that, You kept me out of Azkaban, but even you can't save me if I get into trouble again."
See? I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt; I think you've done the same, seeing as I'm able to write this from my eighth-year dorm and not an Azkaban cell.
As they walked along the corridor, Ron and Hermione continued to squabble over whether or not they needed to go to the library during their free period.
Harry would endure almost any physical discomfort if it meant Draco would keep talking until he was out of breath. Until he ran out of words.
“Dad, I don’t know where you are,” she whispered as her eyes filled with tears. “But I hope you’re proud.”
“I am sorry, ma’am, but we’ve not received any new bodies in the last few days.” The owner had wrung his hands during his anxious apology. “Perhaps you might check the potter’s field? I’m very sorry for your loss.”
it's not enough, it never is. He babbles empty promises of a bed and staying for breakfast, but it's always when harry's had Him on the edge for ages and His cock is heavy and leaking profusely on harry's tongue and He'd probably say anything to come. harry looks into desperate, blown gray eyes and thinks that he might see flickering emotion behind the lust.
The beach house has been on the market for over a year.
Draco presses his lips together. "No, you've been here for the last ten years."
Harry closed his eyes.
"Hi, love! Welcome home!" Harry grinned at Draco, revealing his adorable dimples. Harry's smile always did him in, making his knees a little weak. Even after all this time, seeing Harry's joy and love directed at him still took his breath away after years of scowls and sneers and cruel smirks. Draco collected those smiles in a little corner of his mind, bringing them to consciousness when he needed to remember that he was loved.
The other Aurors around the room nodded and murmured in agreement. Harry’s lips twisted slightly, still bewildered. Why would Bellatrix just turn herself in to the authorities? She’d been missing for so long, most of the Wizarding World had forgotten about her. Either way, Harry supposed, it was only right she serve time for her crimes during the war. He didn't give it another thought once Kingsley slanted him a look for not paying attention to instructions. Harry smiled sheepishly before pushing Bellatrix and Little Red out of his mind.
Thank you, past Draco, for sticking around so that we can have the present, and the future.
He ran toward it, fury rising in his chest at the sight of the torn fabric. Desperately, he cast every detection spell he knew at the scraps, but no traces of magic remained.
"Weasley, you bellowed?" Malfoy said as he walked over, Parkinson in tow. Harry buried his head in his hands; Ron didn't blame him.
Malfoy grit his teeth. "I think this is Pansy's idea of a prank. As my memory returns to me, I remember her getting that gleam in her eye after I brought you up in conversation and she said 'You just need a push, Draco, tell him how you fee--" Malfoy's eyes widened.
"Yeah."
"Well, I'm gay. We've both been harassed by other students this year--you for being the Savior and me for...my past. It might make people at least physically stay away from us both if we pretend to be romantically attached."
"Better..." Malfoy wheezed, his voice strained. "Better you than him."
"Harry."
Draco smiled. Reached for another plate.
Harry knelt down to see where Draco'd indicated and nearly fell back with a gasp. 'James & Lily 4ever' was carved into the trunk of the tree surrounded by a heart.
He hadn't meant to run into Potter. He was taking his nightly stroll around the Hogwarts grounds, brooding, as one does when one's entire worldview was shattered whilst barely avoiding Azkaban due to the mercy of one's former enemy.
He shook himself. There was no need for sentimentality. He wasn’t a Hufflepuff—the Sorting ceremony had confirmed that just hours ago.
"Back to Potter? Really?"
Still, you’ll never be irrelevant enough to be forgotten. That gaudy statue of you still stands in the middle of the Ministry atrium for all to see, your 17-year-old self immortalized in the very pose you had when you saved the world.
Draco allowed themself a small smile at their friends before Tarasque continued their sweeping search of the crowd when their eyes fell on two piercing green ones already staring at them.
Harry blinked. Nodded. Draco reached up and took a plate off the top shelf, handing it to Harry, who threw it away forcefully, relishing the noise it made as it joined its fallen comrades on the floor.
He looked over to see Draco sprawled across the couch, an empty glass in one hand and the other nearly touching the floor, his leather-clad legs spread wide.
Harry turns back onto his side, willing himself not to vomit and not knowing whether it was from the firewhiskey or the poison of heartache.
"Well, at least they're done with insults now," Ron said resignedly.
There, that's better.
"Wait, you didn't know it was me?"
Ron nodded. “Apparently the body was found at the base of a steep cliff.”
“What happened!?”
"Having a Mark doesn't mean you're a Death Eater."
Potter grinned. “Knew it. So, you moved here after eighth year. Have you lived alone ever since?”
"Mr. Malfoy, how do you feel?" She asked after he handed the cup back to her.
“So what do you do?”
He felt a shift in his chest; something dormant, now active.
soil my silk sheets with your street clothes, you heathen! Sleep in your pants or borrow something of mine!' And none of your clothes fit me, so," Potter shrugged.
"Your birth month. We're going to celebrate your birthday a little bit every day this month until the 31st, when--well...that's a surprise."
"You alright mate?" Ron's eyebrows furrowed in confusion as he took a spot on the Common Room couch next to Seamus, who was biting his lip even as he grinned.
that she can convince to reveal their source.”
“But…”
Draco softened. He pulled Harry into his arms, pulling them both down to relax on the bed. "I know, love, but now that we've been together for almost a year, and we live together for Merlin's sake, I hope you'll start letting me give you at least some of what you deserve. I can't buy you the world, though I would if I could, but I can give you treacle tart for breakfast, for starters.
I hate you 'cause you lied.
It was all too satisfying to watch the ropes wrap around Malfoy Sr., seeing him struggle against the binds and scowl.
Harry raised an eyebrow. “Leave. Now.”
!" He was "a bloody waste of time."
Outside, the winter snow is melting into budding spring flowers, the grass crinkling and browning in the summer sun, and the trees shedding orange and red leaves in the crisp fall air.
Maybe I should keep you waiting if you're going to be so rude...
, in that way that can only come from your best friend.
Harry feels a sudden jolt, causing him to stumble back. He is still in his normal body, but this time he's at King's Cross. He waits for the eerie sense of dread to wash over him, but all he feels is peace, contentment. He sees a figure sitting on an otherwise empty bench, and the calm feeling dissolves and is replaced by anticipation twisting in his stomach. He clenches his fists and walks toward the figure, ready to have the confrontation with Albus Dumbledore he'd always craved, but his heart starts pounding as he starts to make out a lithe figure and white=blonde hair.
Suddenly, the door burst open from its hinges. From the smoke and debris, a dragon hide boot stepped through the threshold.
Still, the game wasn’t enough of a distraction to keep him from glancing at the door every five seconds to see if Potter and Pansy had emerged from the bathroom to give Draco yet another reason to pine for the sodding git.
"I can't believe you'd betray me like this." Draco shook his head mournfully, bits of snow falling from the top of his warm hat. "I trusted you."
Harry blinked. "I'd say that's less passive and more aggressive."
"Can I help you find it?"
Harry raised an eyebrow. “I wasn’t expecting company. Sorry to be indecorous.”
Harry pouted halfheartedly. “Apparently I won’t be
Find me on Tumblr!
He looked around at the other eighth years in the circle. He supposed the tension and awkward feelings had dissipated since his apology and conspicuous personality change. He even played chess with Weasley, which was as close to best mates that the two of them would ever reach.
"So, last night. We ran into each other at the Leaky, and--"
Harry matched him, glaring. "I recognize it, Malfoy. I see it all the time staring at you from across the field. But clearly not enough to catch the Snitch when I'm too distracted by you!"
Harry stepped forward toward where Malfoy was perched on his stool at the bar, sliding in next to him and flagging down the bartender to ask for a finger of firewhiskey.
"Call me Harry. Please?"
"Uh guh uh guhh," Harry stood from the chair, moving quickly away from the group. But Malfoy was faster, catching Harry by the wrist before he was able to escape.
You said you forgave me years ago. I'm sure I didn't deserve it back then, and I hope I've come a bit closer to earning it now.
Voldemort had spent years whispering in Harry's ear, telling him lies, showing him visions of disturbing torture and murder to the point that whispering made Harry frantic, defensive.
"Nothing?"
Draco's eyes flashed. "That was for a
"Sorry, Potter, but I'm afraid Truiepets has this planet all, well...tied up."

Songfic prompt: "I'm Only Me When I'm With You" by Taylor Swift
It was Draco’s turn to cough, though he liked to believe he had much more dignity as he sipped his water. Still, Potter looked unsettlingly smug.
Draco reached into his pocket. The note was still legible, despite the messy scrawl and its journey since being folded and carried around with him all day. He knew what it said, had read and reread since he’d woken up to find it taped to his door.
The last thing he remembered was Potter holding the door for him as they left the bar.
Harry scowled. "Seeing as I had more to forgive than almost anyone, it's pretty self-righteous of them to think they're above it all."
He’s lying, I never shall kill
Draco let the statement linger between them for a moment, his throat tight with something he couldn’t identify. They continued walking long enough for it to loosen, for him to gather his courage.
“Remember, class, your homework for tomorrow is seven inches on the history of the Summoning Charm. You are dismissed.”
“But, mate, if it’s not some bitter former Death Eater, do you think it’s just someone who wants justice?”
Draco let out a shaky breath. "Okay, I'll be there soon. I love you."
Tell me, so my future child knows how to distinguish love and fear. So I don't become a real ghost. So my feet and body can take up space without shame or terror or consequences.
she'd said.
Draco closed his eyes to stop the room from spinning. "My head is killing me and I'm dizzy, but I'm okay. What happened?"
Potter's eyes flashed. "Try me, ferret. You're pathetic."
"Baby?"
Harry shook his head. “It's the only way. This ghost is too powerful. But I think if we can combine the powers of our proton streams, it’ll be enough to blast it." He looked at Draco expectantly. "Are you all with me?"
The covers are pushed down to your waist, revealing the pale, scarred torso that you let me worship tonight. You let me kiss and lick a hundred apologies into the raised skin.
"Darling?"
Harry nodded. “I find that alcohol is more of a temporary fix than anything else.”
Two boys, to be exact.
When he lept down from Hagrid's arms, he heard a brief shout of "Potter!!" before a wand was tossed in his direction. He plucked the Hawthorne wand from the air, sparing only a passing thought to regret that he hadn't seen the mysterious helper. The thought left his mind as he faced Voldemort, exhilaration rushing through him as he taunted Riddle by revealing how he'd been helped by Snape all along and had won control of the Elder Wand from a nameless, faceless Death Eater. Riddle cast, he cast, and after the lights from the two wands intersected, it was over.
She was tired of waiting. She never should’ve made her father wait in Azkaban. She should’ve rescued him, gotten him out somehow. Perhaps she should’ve asked for help from the moon frogs, but she’d been too cowardly at the time. Too frightened to hatch a plan to escape from Malfoy Manor. Even when she’d been rescued, she’d followed Harry and the DA into victory, offering comfort and wisdom and defense when called upon.
"She said you've been under the influence of a potion--that's why you've been forced into smiling. So she asked me to, er, snap you out of it."
"So, when do you apply?"
The enemy's gone
"But 'Mione, it's called a free period. A period of freedom. Don't you want to be free?"
He raised a hand to the scar on his forehead and wondered when he'd changed.
“Have a good show, love,” Harry said as Draco stepped into the Floo.
