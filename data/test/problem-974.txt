Ginny shook her head and told her, “you didn’t know those things would happen. That’s like asking if I’m mad at you for how the second tournament turned out.”
Many of the others paced or tightened bracers on their arms. Arlene grabbed a pair of the pieces of armor for her arms. They were leather pads that covered the outside of her forearms. They were flexible to move her wrist but would protect her from bruises and scrapes. Then she sat back on her bench and waited for the inevitable.
Ginny could do nothing but watch and be led around in awe at his incredibleness on the floor. She was amazed and astounded. The whole time he stuck by her side as well. He always wanted to dance with her, even when she was having trouble keeping up. Some other girls would come up to ask for dances but he would say no and that he was there with Ginny.
Ginny lay awake for a while. She kept thinking about how Neville had looked in his dress robes. He had definitely lost weight since last year, in a good way. When he went on the dance floor he had become so confident and happy. It was odd seeing him in this light. He was so different from his usual timid self. Ginny didn’t mind either. She liked both versions of Neville. Eventually, she did fall asleep.
Dumbledore looked him in the eyes and said, “see that you don’t.” He lifted the Goblet of Fire to his lips and drank the flames from it. The fire disappeared behind his lips. He grimaced. A change came over Dumbledore.
Madam Pomfrey approached them saying, “all my patients need immediate attention.” Then she saw Bastion’s condition. Her face paled but she went into action. He pulled the stretcher to a bed and set him down on it.
She smiled but shook her head. “No, I meant just the two of us. As in just us being with each other.”
“For all we know it was Dumbledore that started the war. What if Voldemort was just another pawn to him?” Adrian didn’t really know what to think anymore. They needed more information to act on. That was why they were doing this.
Resuming her cooking, she said, “I know. They’re going to keep him there all day. I don’t know why. He runs the department that deals with muggle artifacts that have been enchanted. I don’t know what that has to do with what happened at the world cup.” She shook her head with a tired sigh.
Skeeter got up with a bloody lip. She ran from the room. Adrian began following her out. McGonagall, not holding Joan back anymore, asked him in a whisper, “where are you going?”
Arlene commended him, “you’re brave for doing this.” She looked down and saw Professor Flitwick beginning the process of drawing her blood. Her stomach lurched but once she looked away the feeling passed.
Luna gave her half smile and asked, “can you still be careful in the maze? Please? Something gives me an odd feeling about it.”
Her hands betrayed her, as they fidgeted away. He glanced at them and raised an eyebrow. She asked, “Professor, does my partner have to be a…” if she finished her sentence then he would know but Flitwick had been nothing but nice to her. He didn’t seem like the judgmental type. She took a risk and asked, “does my partner need to be a boy?”
In her mind there should be concern over what happened at the game last night. On the outside everything was calm and peaceful. It was a strange combination. At least if someone else was awake then there would be someone to talk to.
“You almost got me, Professor.” He turned to her and said, “tell you what, she writes anything bad about one of my kids and I’ll ask you about that private meeting.”
As she closed the book she began to realize what she wanted to see. All these books held information on world events that involved her family. The words would help a student doing a report or a historian learn more. There was something specific that she was searching for that she would never find in the pages of a book. She wanted to know her blood parents. She wanted to know who they were as people. Unless someone had taken the time to write a story about them then she would never get the chance to know them as people.
He shook his head and responded, “I need to get my family to safety. My department has nothing to do with this incident.” He carried on walking.
Lee Jordan yelled, “unbelievable! In a turn of events no one saw coming, literally, Weasley snuck past the dragon without incident! Amazing!”
They showed up just in time to hear Charlie say, “you heard right. I don’t know why but they wanted nesting mothers.”
He scowled and snatched Ginny’s pastry away. He walked away and took a bite from it. A bang went off and it exploded in his face. The plate fell and shattered to the floor as he squealed in surprise. He ran out of the Great Hall.
Remus asked, “how did you convince them to let you adopt all of them with your…” he didn’t want to finish the sentence.
He led her out of the ballroom, through the Great Hall and into the entrance hall. From there they went outside. They found themselves surrounded on all sides by hedges with a fountain in the middle. The fountain was ten feet of unicorn with a continuous jet of water coming from the horn.
They walked along the shore and she occasionally kicked rocks into the water. They didn’t speak many words until Luna asked, “who are you planning on going with?”
Adrian stood up. “Yes, I do.” Severus grumbled something but he didn’t care. “If anyone has any knowledge of anything that might lead to me or anyone at this school getting stabbed or bitten or having their ribcage crushed again please let us know now. I am really looking forward to a normal, boring school year. Can we please focus on education this time?”
No one laughed. The rest of the meeting was spent discussing scheduling of the school year around the three tasks that would occur. No details about the Tournament were discussed, the only thing they knew was that the first would involve dragons somehow. Adrian did not like this.
The students excitedly ran out of the courtyard. The smart ones, like Luna and Arlene, stuck to the sides to avoid the rush. They saw the twins holding Ginny over their heads while they rushed down with the rest.
“No, I don’t mind looking around. It’ll be good to stretch my legs.” The old man left him with a wave. Adrian returned the wave and began walking towards the house. As he approached it he noticed the paint peeling and the wild foliage around the house. It appeared as if no one had tended to the house in months.
Skeeter huffed and began walking out while saying, “this is ridiculous. Dumbledore is of course to blame for this whole disaster. I can’t believe you would look to blame an innocent reporter.” She smirked at Joan, “perhaps you’re just looking for an outlet for all your crazy. Since you can’t kill children for fun anymore.”
“I’ve decided that I will break the marriage contract. I don’t want to marry Harry. Ron was also being used by Dumbledore to keep an eye on Harry. In the summer before this year we both agreed to break free from him.” She stood tall and proud. The confidence radiating from her was inspiring to Arlene. “Ron was going to use the money from the winnings to break away from Dumbledore. In the time he had known Harry he had grown to like him as a person and not a job. I’m not going to let his death be in vain.” Her voice trembled but she stood tall as an ancient oak tree. “I won’t be used like a whore to pay off a debt. I will be my own person. We both should’ve been. He was denied that by Dumbledore but he won’t get me.”
The Durmstrang girl stood up and cracked her knuckles. Krum told her, “stop. There is no point in fighting here. If you think you are better than prove it in the tournament.” He nodded to Arlene. She decided he wasn’t too bad.
Rusu, the girl who had sat behind her last night sneered at her and said, “not much to compete against there.”
She moved down the path until she saw a blue light. Excitement filling her, she jogged down until she saw the source. On a pedestal sat the Triwizard cup. She had found it.
The magic of that moment ended when they got home and found half the kids throwing potatoes at each other from homemade forts across the room. Now the potatoes where locked up.
She shrugged and presented her wand. She told him, “this is ridiculous. The last spell I did was to clean off my shoes.”
Arlene didn’t know what to believe now. If she had to point a finger then she would point it at the ministry. She didn’t have any hard evidence. All she had was a weak suspicion.
It didn’t help that students were lining up to put their names in it for a deadly tournament. Why would he be upset that students were lining up to give their name to something that might be a monster so they could participate in a deadly tournament?
Arlene was still happy with this. Just the fact that her answers could exist was more information than she had before. Finding someone who had been there before wouldn’t be too hard. Between her adoptive parents it was likely one of them had been. They hadn’t let her down yet. “This is great. Thank you professor.”
Dobby announced, “we will prepare a boar for her!” All the other house elves ran off to continue their work. Dobby stayed and told her, “we are happy at the return of the Connery family. Ever since Sarah Connery passed we house elves have had more and more harshness and restrictions put on us. Your family was the only one that stood up for us.”
“Simple,” Adrian told them, “the ministry loves records. They’ll have kept records of his whereabouts in the orphans department.” He stretched and said, “I had to deal with them a bunch when I was getting all the orphaned kids at Hogwarts.”
She knocked on the door to his office. There was silence. She was about to walk away when she felt something brush against her consciousness. It was hard to describe what she was feeling but it felt like someone was trying to get inside her mind. In reflex she pushed against it and it went away. She also heard a crash inside the office. After a few seconds she heard, “come in.”
As she sat down to rest Professor Snape told her the nicest thing he had ever said. Not just her but the nicest thing he had ever said to anyone. Even Lily Evans Potter. “Congratulations on passing your final. That was a sixth year level potion and you did it perfect.” She just smiled at him. He added, “don’t get cocky. I can still make you take the real final. You better keep up your grades in my class.”
All the students exited the Hall except for those that Adrian had adopted and their close friends. Two of them had graduated and move out last year. Harry now lived with Remus and Sirius so it was just four now. They gathered in a circle around him and Joan and he asked, “do any of you have any desire to participate in this thing?” Arlene kept her hand down. Only one of them raised their hand. Adrian responded, “if I give you ten thousand galleons will you not put your name in the Goblet?”
She kissed his chest and told him, “Don’t be too hard on yourself. We both are. Unlearning the things we went through isn’t easy. We may never get fully over it.” She propped herself up on her elbow. “I don’t think that means we shouldn’t try to lead normal lives. Neither of us want to be killers anymore.” She smiled at him. “Besides, would the monsters we used to be take care of all those kids and relieve stress by having sex secretly?”
Adrian would never understand why wizards didn’t embrace the internet. It was so fast and useful. Instead of spending months looking through cemeteries he had a town already to search. “Thank you. You have a nice day.” He went behind a bookshelf and apparated back to the gate of Hogwarts.
He stepped out and pointed his wand at the death eaters. He cast the explosion spell. Then he did it again. And again.
Especially to Arlene, she had seen one of her closest friends in the muggle world beaten for something similar. The woman from the foster home had seen her friend hanging out with another girl and had gone crazy and started hitting her. Arlene had been the only one able to stop her.
They ate lunch and Luna went to Defense against the dark arts class. She had mixed feelings about Professor Moody. He was too paranoid for her to be fully comfortable in the class but she understood why he was that way and didn’t judge him.
“Has that Skeeter woman talked to you yet?” Joan didn’t see Skeeter anywhere so the lying reporter got to live for a few more minutes.
After picking up a steak, Luna told her, “I haven’t seen anything about tonight.” They both started eating at a normal pace while they could. Just a few bites in though and screams rent the air. Bangs and flashes came from the direction Adrian had gone. This was followed by gunfire.
She went to the backroom and saw the other champions there. The room was mostly empty now. In the Great Hall she could hear another speech being made but not the words. A fireplace was blazing away on the other side of the room. The other champions were milling about. Harry and Ron were talking. They seemed oddly calm. Harry even laughed about something.
He turned to her with a surprised look on his face. Luna had a similar look on hers. It was rare when Luna was that surprised. He turned red in the face and asked in a soft voice, “r-really?”
They were hauled up unceremoniously by Joan who was saying, “we need to leave now!” They looked back to see smoke and fires rising from several tents and it was spreading fast. “we need to get back to the portkey!”
The two of them walked down to the village. The two of them weren’t in a hurry. It wasn’t like the village was going anywhere. About half an hour later they were at the village. It was then that Luna asked, “where should we go first?”
The colors were those of the house they belonged to. These were more protective yet more breathable. Arlene knew as soon as she put her outfit on that it was meant for a fight.
She nodded and followed her out the door. Once they were outside and away from everyone Luna immediately asked, “Can we hang out during the next Hogsmeade visit?”
Ginny rolled her eyes and said, “We need to get lined up guys. McGonagall is throwing a fit about us being presentable.”
He said, “you know what, if no one joins I’ll give you all ten thousand Galleons. I’m bribing you all to not join in on this bullshit.”
He put the bag away and said, “very well. Very exciting.” He waited for a response but none of them were excited enough to respond. “Alright, Mr. Potter you are first.” His heart dropped down to his feet.
Professor Flitwick smiled and commented, “pretty cool right? My own little creation. It only works in this office and it won’t show people or animals. Excellent for showing the world as it is currently.” He tapped the map over Egypt and told it, “Library of Alexandria.” The map zoomed in on the northern coast of Egypt.
He saw it in her face that they both became aware of the position they were in at the same time. Him lying on his back. She straddling him while pinning him down. She let him up. He coughed and said, “I need to plan my first few lessons.”
Arlene put a hand to her chin and wondered aloud, “why would the ministry want to put a stop to someone trying to free house elves?”
He pulled away only to reappear in a different location. This one seemed peaceful. It was a dark forest. He walked forward until he found a clearing. In this clearing was a beautiful pond with a doe sitting by it. Petting the doe was Lily.
She stopped when both Ginny and Luna grabbed her. Ginny told her, “Arlene. Your power is freaking out.”
Ministry workers dragged Harry in through the tent. His back was scorched and he could see second degree burns in the holes in his clothes. They took him right out the other side. Hopefully to the hospital wing. One of the workers carried his egg and his damaged broom with him.
He pushed at it with two fingers. It wiggled just like a normal flower. He felt the stem and leaves. When satisfied he pulled at a petal. It popped off just like with a normal flower.
She got up and put the potion into a bottle. She had six bottles in all. Four of them were filled with the standard sleeping potion. She took the bottles to the Ravenclaw common room. She put two of the bottles in her trunk.
It was a flower. A simple blue flower that to the naked eye had nothing odd or abnormal about it. It grew from a brown pot. The only use it had would be as a gift. Even then it would die soon. Unless someone subjected it to alchemy.
He smiled back at her sweetly. “No, I guess not. I have a lot of room for improvement still.” She got an idea and sat on his hips. He raised his hands and pleaded, “a few more minutes. I need a little rest down there.”
He flinched and scurried away to the other side of the room to leer at Fleur. Ludo Bagman approached her next. He timidly told her, “you can’t be here. This room is for champions only.”
Arlene made no comment on that but told her, “I’m going to Egypt today to check out that library.” She opened her suitcase and started putting clothes in. Then a thought crossed her mind. “If I’m only going for the library then why did he want me to pack?”
Arlene reached a hand out for a scepter. Pain shot from the roots of her hair. Her head was jerked back as someone pulled on her hair. Anger filled her as she turned and saw Rusu trying to pull her back. The Durmstrang girl snarled at her, “I won’t you steal my victory.”
Adrian leaned against the doorframe. He said, “I now know Dumbledore is my enemy but I need evidence. Voldemort was supposed to be our evidence. He’s vanished. I need hard evidence to justify to the ministry why I’m going to kill Dumbledore.” That was if he could do it.
As young and athletic as she was, running up and down stairs was taking a toll on her. She soon found herself panting and sweating. She stopped to lean against the wall when she remembered the bathroom that no one ever used. The girl’s bathroom on the second floor. Because of moaning Myrtle.
Arlene went up the stairs and grabbed her suitcase. Luna was on her bed reading a copy of the Quibbler. She looked up and said, “my dad has found new evidence on the minister’s war on goblins. He says the minister ate another pie the other day and no one knows what was in it. That means he wants it secret which means it’ll be goblins in his pie.”
They ate then went back. As they walked Luna explained, “when you said couple stuff I thought you meant something very different.”
Adrian played the calm role, “we don’t know all the details of the trial yet. It may not be a direct fight.” He remained leaning back in his chair. After a moment he added, “If it is a direct fight then you will have to use your magic. No dragon will give you time to draw an alchemic circle.”
Mr. Bagman snatched up Harry and shook him roughly as he barked in his face, “what the hell happened?”
“Hagrid you can’t spend your whole life hiding from the world. You have to get out and live life. Trust me I know that.” He let out an exasperated breath. “The people who matter to you have actively tried to reach out to you. They want to be your friends and still care about you. Please open up to them.”
They glanced at each other. Fred told his twin, “she’s clever. More clever than we give her credit for.”
They walked into the hedgerows. It was like a maze but they weren’t worried about finding the other side. They just wandered it while enjoying each other’s company.
The alchemist lowered his wand with a sigh. “Full marks, Miss Connery.” He sat down and added, “class dismissed.” He gave a subtle thumbs up to her from behind the desk.
Along the way up they ran into Lucius Malfoy and his son. “Author! A little family outing. I hope you didn’t have to sell your house for the money.” He remarked to the Weasley family from a level above them.
When they arrived back there were two people standing on the path outside. Arlene recognized Adrian and Joan instantly and rushed out to see them. Joan saw her first and elbowed Adrian to get him to look. “Ow.” Then he saw her. They met her in the middle and hugged.
Her and Luna spent even more time with each other. She would go out of her way just to meet Luna in between classes that she couldn’t attend. Luna was always happy to see her.
Arlene scanned the table and saw that she was right. There was an empty chair where the Defense against the dark arts professor sat. Arlene frowned. “You’re right. What if they couldn’t find anyone?” She couldn’t take the class but she still wanted it to be available for Luna and Ginny.
Snape lowered his wand and snarled, “put your arms down. How dare you? I thought you were a noble member of the Malfoy household. Not some kind of…Potter lover.” He crossed his arms. His tone turned condescending. “I could tolerate you being gay. To think you went and fell in love with Potter. So distasteful.”
The dragon was saying, “if you take the fake egg will my real ones be safe? I know it is fake. I need the real ones. They are my children. The mean humans are crafty and captured us. Please help us.”
All three of them recoiled from the ferocity of her statement. Not even Fred and George made a joke from that. The rest of the family came down one or two at a time. Harry and Hermione came down with them. Luna was the last to come down and she sat next to Arlene. Breakfast of bacon and eggs was served as they came down. Conversation was light and halfhearted.
Ginny turned to look at Luna who said, “congratulations on getting a date. What inspired you to ask him?”
“Everyone’s got parents.” Adrian rubbed his temples. “I just have no idea who they were. I do know that at one point he went to Hogwarts. That he was a normal student before he went all dark lord or got framed for being a dark lord or whatever. I just have to figure out who he was.”
She felt another pair of arms grab her and pale blonde hair fell on her. Luna had joined the group hug. Arlene said, “I’m glad you two are safe. I heard you ended up in the hospital.”
Adrian looked at him. “Sirius, I know it hurts. The wrongs that have happened and are happening will be brought to light. Either through legal means or not legal means.”
He answered her, “three nights. One for the journey and two for research. Then I’ll bring us back here.”
Weeks passed for Arlene with contentment. Her third elective, Gobblygook, was going well. As always she excelled at her classes. Impressing all the Professors. Even Professor Snape seemed to be nicer to her. Although the rumor was that he was being a little nicer to everyone, especially Draco and Harry.
Mr. Crouch raised a calming hand and said, “there’s no evidence. You have no proof.” He raised his wand. “Unless.” He walked up to Skeeter and demanded, “present your wand. We shall see what spell you cast last.”
Cheers rained on him as stunning spells rained on the dragon. He felt bad about stealing one of the dragons eggs. Even if it was fake. The whole trial was cruel to the poor animals. He left the stadium. He didn’t want to see any more of it. He just wanted to win and make his family richer.
Her expression never changed as she went on petting the doe. “I’ll never change my mind. I know you’ll never understand but I chose James. Trust me, it’s for the best of the world.” Her eyes shifted down as if she were sad. “Or it may not matter.”
“That tells me you enjoyed it,” Joan reassured him. They held each other for a while. Adrian napped for an hour then they got up and got dressed. It was almost noon now. They went to the Great Hall for lunch. Professor McGonagall commented to him, “I didn’t see you at breakfast.”
Draco and his partner came by. He told them, “congratulations. I didn’t think anyone was that brave.” His partner made a smile but it was obvious it was fake. She didn’t say anything mean though.
His back still felt like it was one fire but his robes had gone out when he was rolling. Ministry workers pulled him back into the tent as stunning spells rained on the angry dragon. The whole first row of the stadium was filled with Dragon handlers.
She nodded and they made their way outside. Sometime after the first trial a snow had fallen on the grounds. The sun was out now and it was the middle of the day. They were bundled up enough to keep the cold off. The lake hadn’t even frozen over yet. The Durmstrang ship sitting in the middle made for a change in scenery.
The obstacle course was a massive pit of rocks and dirt. There was a climbing section all the way across the middle that stretched about twenty feet high. There were several gaps and mud pits. The formations were so high that she couldn’t see what was at the other end. Although, she had a feeling it was something to do with the troll.
Draco relaxed and answered, “I’m sorry Professor. I was in the library studying. I’ve been trying to catch up from the summer break. I need to keep ahead after all.” He delivered his lie calm and well. Years of lying to his family made him great at it.
Arlene told them, “thank you for helping me. I’m going to go find him now.” She waved bye to them and left for the dungeons. The last class of the day had passed but she hoped Professor Snape would still be in his office. She also hoped that he felt like being nice today. She had a feeling he would tell her to just go away but she had to try.
As cheers went up his hearing faded. There was no way he heard that right. His heart fell to one of his feet. He watched her stand up. A strong sense of disappointment and heartbreak filled him. Then she said to the whole hall, “but I didn’t put my name in. I don’t want to be a champion.”
She looked at her and told her, “I hope you’re right. I can’t see anything there.” A furrow formed in her brow and she asked, “you’re not mad about our first year here are you? When I couldn’t see anything that would happen with the chamber?”
Professor Flitwick nodded in agreement then said, “so on a lighter subject, how are your classes going?” He leaned back in his chair to relax.
Krum and Fleur went and faced their dragons. Both of them got their eggs. The rules didn’t have a minimum or maximum number of contestants that could move on. If they all got the egg then they all made it to next trial.
Arlene giggled. “Hopefully normal. Adrian has been complaining about it all summer. He keeps saying he just wants one year that doesn’t involve him getting stabbed or bitten.”
She looked just as she had in life. Beautiful and happy. Warmth and hope flooded him as he rushed forward. He fell to his knees at her side and exclaimed, “Lily! You’re here.”
He stood back up and bolstered himself. There was only one way this could end. With him holding that egg.
The professor told her, “I’m glad things are turning out well for you. Are you ready to learn some new magic?” Arlene nodded and Joan went on, “So now we got some new ideas for you to try.” She looked her in the eyes. “Read my mind.”
“The muggle one did,” he explained, “the wizarding one survived and has remained hidden.” The map focused on a cleared area right on the coast. “You might be able to visit over Christmas break. I do recommend that you go with someone who has been before. The library is quite massive but hard to find.” He pointed to a light house that was sitting on a spit of land stretching into the Mediterranean sea. “The entrance is near here. I’ve never actually been inside it. I’m not sure of anyone here who has.”
She looked ahead and saw no one was getting past the trolls anytime soon. She still had to act fast though. She ran over to the rock and drew an alchemic circle of separation around it. She drew some symbols in the dirt and activated the circle.
Arlene gave Luna a box and Luna handed one to her. The box given to Arlene was wrapped in light blue paper. She pulled off the paper and opened the box. Inside she found a necklace. From first sight she could tell it had been homemade. Arlene didn’t know anything about jewelry but it was almost impossible for this to have come from a store.
Harry found his chest and sat on the chair by it. He tried to calm his nerves as he put on his gear. There were fingerless gloves, leather bracers, leather shin guards, and a leather cap with a string to tie it on your head. It all seemed pathetically frail against a dragon.
Then Dumbledore stood up and announced, “it has been twenty four hours since the Goblet of Fire has been lit. Now it is time to choose the champions.” He walked around the table and approached the goblet. He held a hand out to it and seemed to will it to do something. He squinted at it. Was it possible that Dumbledore knew what was in there?
She stroked some his scars unconsciously and remarked, “we both compare things to fighting. We’re both pretty fucked up I guess.”
Severus shook his head. It was a trick. It had to have been a trick. It had to have been. People didn’t change. No one ever changed.
They reached the next set of portkeys. Before they could find the right one the world was bathed in a green light. Looking up and behind them they saw the cause. Several people gasped and some screamed at the sight. A set of green stars had arrayed themselves in the sky to form a skull with a snake crawling out the mouth. The image sent a shiver up Arlene’s spine. Her hands found themselves entwined with Luna’s but neither of them cared. She didn’t know what the image meant. She was smart enough to know it was evil.
In ten years the monks had taught him plenty and expunged a spirit demon from him. They forced him to retain the knowledge of languages he had gained from the camp. They taught him what felt like every meditation in existence. They did plenty of healing to him. He would be forever grateful to them.
Arlene figured that she didn’t even have to try for this one. She had done her part and gotten Ron to the final task. There was still competition to their plan. If someone not from Hogwarts reached the end of the maze first then all her effort would be for nothing. She would have to try to win unless Ron got close enough to beat her to it.
Ginny was the one to knock but Hagrid didn’t respond. She knocked again. No sounds came from the inside of the hut. Not even the booming barks of Fang. Luna peeked into the window and informed them, “just as I suspected, he isn’t here.” She pulled away from the window and suggested, “maybe the Quidditch field?”
Author clarified, “Veela!” The figures began dancing. At least that’s what it looked like from this distance. Then she felt something in her. It was a similar feeling to when she had looked at Madam Rosmerta for the first time except this was worse. She felt an instant attraction to the figures below. A desire to be closer to them rose in her.
Too much had gone wrong. He pulled the detonator from his pocket. He was going to waste months of work but it was too dangerous now. He flipped up the cover for the switch. “Cover!” A spell hit the detonator in his hand. It burst apart and cut his hand. He hissed and threw up a shield spell. Cloaked figures were approaching them from the manor on the hill.
Ron shook his head. “I can’t now. We all worked too hard to get here. We should all win. What will they say if we all grab it at once?”
Mrs. Weasley told them, “I’ll take you all to Diagon alley so we can get your school supplies. As soon as everyone’s finished their breakfast we’ll head out.” By that time most of them were finished so they headed towards the fireplace. Within minutes they were all in Diagon alley and began shopping for their supplies. The effects of the attack on the World Cup were obvious.
It was a wide area with seats surrounding him. Rocky outcrops and hills made for natural cover. Cheers and jeers rained on him from the seats but only one thing had his attention.
He couldn’t see her expression but Joan did sit next to him and hold him. He would’ve understood if she was angry with him. She probably should’ve been.
Arlene pressed her head against Joan and held her close. She loved her adoptive parents but in that moment she wanted to know her blood family.
Adrian entered the beach house where Remus and Sirius were living and announced, “I have the last ingredient.” He held up a vial of Harry’s blood he had taken from his donation bag. “We perform the ritual on the night of the 24th. It’s the only night it’ll work.”
Luna smiled. She took a hold of Arlene’s hands and hopped as she said, “Thank you so much! I’m looking forward to it now. Let’s go eat.”
He didn’t do anything though. He didn’t cast the curse. He didn’t tell Voldemort and Dumbledore where she was hiding. Pettigrew did, of course it would’ve been better if Sirius had been the one to do it. Sirius had been more involved in his bullying. More involved in his pain. He wished Sirius had remained the betrayer, he hated him more than Pettigrew.
He stopped finger brushing his beard with wide eyes. That was not what he had been expecting. “Aren’t there some steps in between starting dating and sex? I’ve been out for a while but I don’t remember it that way.”
Arlene grabbed an apple and left the tent. It was still early enough for there to be a chill in the air but now the smell of smoke from wood fires was filling the camp. She took a bite from her apple and reached into her pocket for some warmth. Her hand met something unexpected. It was the wand she had gotten from Ollivander’s years ago.
Then he kneeled in the snow. He placed both his hands on her shoulders. The tired Professor explained, “I know what you want to say. Ever since I first saw you standing on those stairs in your normal clothes you’ve reminded me of someone who I never got to know properly. Someone I hold very close to my heart. You now lie next to that spot.” Tears filled his eyes but they didn’t fall. “Arlene Connery, we’re not related by blood, but after everything we’ve been through together I would consider it an honor for you to let me call you daughter.”
Adrian felt his bloodlust rise. He held it down for now. It did no good now. Later it would be put to great use.
He shook his head. “It wouldn’t matter. There’s not much she could do that wouldn’t kill everyone in the stadium as well.”
She answered, “as much as I can.” She grabbed some pudding. If she was going to get hurt tomorrow then she wanted to enjoy some food before then. Her nerves did get in the way of that though. She tried her best to eat but she only got halfway through her plate before giving up.
Skeeter fumbled for her wand but he easily disarmed her. He walked to her as he said, “I thought you’d be smarter than this Rita. After all I’m a psychotic baby killer aren’t I?” He shot ropes the photographer to keep him out of the way. “I mean according to you I murdered my own wife and daughter.” He raised his wand at her. His voice dropped to a growl. “How did you word it? A crazed animal that needs to be locked up? A monster?” Tears were running down her face now. He pressed the wand into her neck and told her, “Rita, you wanted a monster so bad, you got one right in front of you.”
She flinched back as Harry explained, “that means more students from the other schools will move ahead with us. That lowers our chances of success.” He leaned forward and almost seemed to be pleading. “Please, I know you didn’t want this but you don’t have to win. You just have to make it to the third trial. Or at least the second so we have a better chance to help Ron win. It’ll help Ginny too.”
Arlene told him the truth, “we don’t know. We’re just making it up as we go.” Luna nodded in agreement.
Joan responded, “I don’t know how many dragons you’ve fought but I want all the support I can get.” She held up a hand and finished, “support I know I can count on.” She leaned in and whispered, “she thinks you’re useless because you’re a man.”
“I can’t help that it’s so delicious,” she explained. They both liked that idea and headed for the Three Broomsticks to get some butterbeer and food. Many of the other students had made their way there too but the majority were at the joke or candy shops. They managed to find a table with one of the least expected people.
A crash jolted Arlene from her reverie. A weak hoot came from the window as an old owl flapped in and landed on the table. A cluster of letters that resembled a novel were tied to its leg.
He smirked. The grave was here and there was little chance of losing this construction. He turned back to the house to see a flash of light in one of the windows. He removed his sunglasses and squinted at it. He wasn’t sure if he had seen that right. There was another flash in the window.
He was on a bench with room for four people. He gestured to the seats next to him and said, “help yourself. No one’s here with me.”
“Mr. Creevey, just call her my d… wait,” his words sank in. Especially the name he said. “Rita Skeeter?! Where?” She turned on the poor boy as he answered her question. She ran off without another word.
Bliss radiated from her lips. She went gently and caressed her lips with care. Their bodies pressed against each other as they embraced. Their contact was still soft and loving. No need for urgency, no rush to get anywhere. It lasted for what felt like hours. Then it ended so soon. They broke apart for air then rejoined for a shorter kiss.
He recovered enough to reply, “you want to put an adult dragon to sleep?” She nodded. He nodded than told her, “take a seat. We’ll look at your options.” He went over the potions that would give her a chance.
The next largest one was a history on the early days of the ministry. It covered the formation of the ministry and the eventual joining of her family. This was mostly information that she already knew. This book held more specifics and information on major events.
Arlene felt adrenaline pump into her body and she used it to fuel her next bout of magic. She was afraid. She was terrified. She poured it into her magic. She reached out and mystically grabbed the spider. She lifted it into the air until the legs were scrabbling at nothing.
Adrian was already drawing his wand and running towards the chaos. A terrified scream rent the air. Gasps and screams followed. He glimpsed Skeeter urging her photographer to take all the pictures he could. He had bigger problems than her right now.
Luna blushed. She actually stammered before speaking. Luna was never this flustered. “I thought you meant…uh…you know…”
Adrian patted her on the shoulder and said, “don’t worry about it. Me and Hagrid will look for environmental advantages.” He walked over to Hagrid and said, “let’s look around for cover and high places. Things that will help us if one of the dragons get out of control.”
“I am going to high five her multiple times in the face with extreme force,” He said as he directed her towards the exit of the Great Hall. Ginny loved that idea but knew it was important to find Arlene right now. “Professor Winters is searching for her as well.” They left the Great Hall.
He got up and went into the tent. He came out a second later while racking the slide on one of his guns. Luna asked, “why do you have a muggle weapon?”
They slow moved from each other. Arlene had to lean against the post again. He knees had gone weak from the beautiful kiss. She opened her eyes to see Luna leaning against the fence as well. A weak laugh escaped her. She laughed too.
The six of them left the library and headed for Hagrid’s hut. When they got outside they saw ministry workers levitating loads of lumber, stone, and metal bars down into the forbidden forest. They had even cut a path into the trees that was visible from the door to the entrance hall.
He swooped towards her then backed off. She shot a jet of flame at him. He moved to the side but was still covered in a sheen of sweat from it. It was so hot.
It was sweet, smooth and fizzy all at the same time. She didn’t know how something like that could even exist but it did and she had it in her hands. She couldn’t help but drink it fast. Her bottle was empty far too fast. She set it down with a loud sigh of satisfaction.
Even Weasley and Potter were still getting along. Through all this they were still hanging out with each other. Weasley would often been seen trying to get people to stop harassing Potter. It didn’t seem to be working.
They walked to the Ravenclaw common room and faced the knocker that was proof that Rowena Ravenclaw hated the idea of students getting to bed on time. It spotted Arlene and spat, “oh, the smart one. How about this riddle? I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body but come alive with the wind. What am I?”
Draco smiled. One of the biggest smiles he had ever had. Warmth blossomed from his heart and filled every corner of his being. He squeezed Harry’s hand gently and responded, “thank you. Thank you so much for taking a chance with me. I’ll do my best to make you happy.”
He stared at it for a minute. His face remained unimpressed. He drew his wand and sent a jet of flame over the flower. The flame dissipated as soon as it appeared. The flower was unharmed. He swiped his wand at it in an attempt to cut it in half. The flower swayed but remained unharmed.
They reached greenhouse three for Herbology a few minutes before it began. None of the other students made eye contact with them. Professor Sprout entered and announced, “good morning students. Welcome back for an exciting year. Who’s ready to get started?” There was mixed response. She carried on unhampered, “let’s get started with today’s lesson.”
All his life he had been the brunt of bullying and jokes. The only light that he had left was her. Then that snake faced bastard killed her. He had begged him not to. Begged Dumbledore to protect her. Of course James Potter was incompetent enough to let her die. In the end none of it changed anything. Lily Evans was dead. Died protecting the spawn of James who now tormented him every day with the memory of what he did.
Joan blinked in surprise and responded, “Adrian Barnes was able to read a girl. Stop the presses.” The she furrowed her brows at him and went on, “that has to be the worst pick up line I’ve ever heard.” She smacked the door frame and said, “you know what a real pick up line is? Hey, want to have sex?”
Ginny was liking where this was going. She said, “we just have to show the whole school that you can do magic with a wand.”
He answered, “after my first paycheck! I had been trapped in one place my whole life so I wanted to go see the world. Of course the pyramids were on the list.” They reached the gate and passed outside of Hogwarts grounds. He took her hand and said, “hold on to me tightly.” He caught the broom he had summoned.
Dejected and not getting anywhere they turned around. Harry reassured them, “we can try again later.” They went and sat in the Great Hall until after dinner. Then they went back to the hut after eating.
Arlene patted his hand and told him, “You don’t have to. I know why. You don’t like me being in danger. I understand that.” She didn’t say that she knew that he was afraid of having to look at her dead body.
So all that worrying didn’t matter? Great. Next time she was going to put on whatever she wanted. Professor McGonagall got everyone’s attention by saying, “attention students. After we go over the rules then you can go down to the village.” She went over the rules. All of them. At the end she told them, “go out and have fun but be safe. Now, nice and orderly, go on.”
The three of them managed to make small talk and laughed. Ginny even sat with them at the Ravenclaw table through dinner. Many Gryffindors and Ravenclaws looked on them oddly for this. Then Fred and George came over.
All they got in return was silence. Ron yelled, “it’s about dragons!” Still nothing. They were forced to leave. Hagrid was still not ready to talk to them. They still had no way to fight the dragons.
“Thank you Miss Lovegood,” said Hagrid as they came to a clearing at the edge of the forest. A fence stood between them and the creatures beyond. They were similar to pictures of cows Arlene had seen before. The only major difference was they had four horns on their heads. Still in the same general area and shape.
She nodded and said, “we will. I’ll stick by but don’t bring any attention to yourself. Especially not around Skeeter.” Joan squeezed her shoulder reassuringly then moved to the other side of the room for a better vantage.
No one expected the Raven to respond. It did. “Oh okay, This year is going to be real fun for you then. You’ll get my best work. I hope you like sleeping on the floor.”
They turned to Hagrid who said, “Arlene, I didn’t know you knew Madam Rosmerta. How did you two meet?”
She held onto him as they apparated away. After a few seconds of the unpleasant experience they reappeared in a bright, dry, and hot environment. The sun blinded her for a second. Her eyes adjusted but she still had to squint. Something plastic tapped her hand. She looked down to see a pair of sunglasses being handed to her. “I should’ve given you these before we left. I apologize for that.”
Behind them stretched a massive city. Most of the buildings were short but they never seemed to end. It was a sea of stone buildings. Adrian said, “whenever you’re ready, I’ll make us invisible and we’ll start flying towards the library.”
She continued down the paths. The goal posts didn’t peek over the walls again. She needed to find her bearings. Leaning against the wall, she closed her eyes and spread her consciousness around her. It was more controlled than before and the thoughts she encountered were less intrusive than before.
Jordan was talking about them, “I’m being told that the dragon is exhibiting behaviors seen when a dragon is surrendering. This has never been seen in nesting mothers. Ever. We are witnessing history people.”
Hermione slapped the table again and exclaimed, “you’ve been to the Library of Alexandria?” Her jaw dropped then snapped back up so she could say, “I’ve been wanting to go ever since I heard about it. Is it as great as the one here at Hogwarts?”
They walked down towards the hut. None of the ministry workers even glanced in their direction. Luna was the first one to ask, “what are you up to?”
“Thank you,” Adrian took a nearby seat and closed his eyes. He looked resting but he was actually practicing one of the mental exercises he had learned at the monastery. It was supposed to clear the mind of minor distractions so he could focus on the major task at hand. He had been good at it so he figured it was a good one to get restarted with.
Mr. Crouch tested her wand and confirmed what she said. He was able to tell them, “she did as she said. This was recent. Recent enough to have been done on the walk over here. I don’t have the ability to tell if a spell was performed before that.” He gave her an empty look and commented, “how very lucky for you.”
Arlene was sitting at lunch when Madam Pomfrey burst through the doors to the Great Hall. She marched up to Dumbledore and screamed, “CANCEL THE TOURNAMENT! I JUST STAYED UP ALL NIGHT REATTACHING SOMEONE’S  LEG!” Her tone lowered but the same amount of rage burst from it. “Half the hospital wing is filled with injured people from your little games! I’m not having this again!” She walked away from the table and left the room. Dumbledore never even stopped eating.
A jolt of exactment shot through her and she said, “I would love that. Please Hagrid, I’ll pay for them.”
Joan’s gift to her was a pair of dragonhide boots. She had a strong suspicion that Joan and Adrian had worked together on their gifts. She told her, “thank you. These are just my size too. How did you know?”
He lay on the floor and thought about how he used to be a professional assassin. Someone skilled enough in combat to confidently say he could fight Dumbledore or Voldemort and have a chance at winning. He used to hunt Death Eaters for money. Yet here he was lying on the floor after being outsmarted by a fourteen year old over a woman in a jar.
Arlene closed her eyes and placed her hands on the back of her head. There was nothing she could do about it now. There was no solution at hand. It was impossible for now to figure out who did it and why. She shook her head and said, “Let’s go to lunch. I can’t do anything about it now.”
The furrow in his eyebrows deepened. Everyone else had already gone up. Most flowers survived but blackened with fire contact. Others went limp from the cutting attempt. A few didn’t feel like real flowers or didn’t come apart like normal ones.
The rest of the hall had. Everyone’s attention had been diverted to Madam Pomfrey. After she told Dumbledore off the clatter of dropping silverware could be heard. Not a sound pervaded the room as she screamed her frustration on the headmaster. For the first time in Hogwarts’ history someone besides the headmaster had silenced the Great Hall.
Luna gave her a sweet look as the girl from Durmstrang behind her huffed and said, “the tournament isn’t about treasure or money. It’s about eternal glory. That is worth dying for.”
Blue flames shot out at the ribbon as it bounced off the troll’s face. Arlene had produced one of the hottest flames ever seen at Hogwarts and the metal caught fire instantly. She already had her arm in place to block the light but was still blinded by the sheer amount of it coming from the burning metal.
She sat down and he explained, “On Christmas day there will be a ball taking place which is traditionally part of the Triwizard tournament. As a champion you are required to attend in dress robes or a dress.” He rolled his eyes, “this should’ve been explained to you at the beginning of the year. Before someone put your name in.” She nodded but didn’t say anything. Professor Flitwick went on, “you only have to be here for Christmas but you will need a partner.”
A door opened on the massive carriage and a thin boy in blue robes jumped out. He reached under the carriage and pulled out a set of golden stairs. Then stepped down a massive woman. Not massive in an insulting manner. She was tall. Taller than any human could be. She was at least as tall as Hagrid if not taller.
Luna nodded and went around saying bye to the Weasleys. Arlene did the same. Saying bye to Ginny was the hardest. They hugged for nearly a full minute before breaking apart with Ginny saying, “I’ll see you on the train platform. Don’t do anything dangerous while I’m not around to save you either.”
Hagrid was impressed. Luna had the serene look that she maintained at most times. Hagrid said, “I see you really like butterbeer. I can get you some for my house so you have a better supply closer.”
The day Christmas break began Adrian tracked her down to outside the Ravenclaw common room and told her, “pack your bags, we’re going to Egypt.”
Ginny backed her up, “she’s right. Most boys are just walking around staring at the girls they want to ask.” He nodded in agreement. His face lightened up some. Ginny didn’t think that bad of Neville. He wasn’t the most handsome or the best talker but he was a good person at heart. Really he wasn’t ugly either. “Neville, you want to go to the ball with me instead?” Wait, what?
She couldn’t help but return her smile. No matter what was happening Luna always had a positive attitude. This made her relax and feel warm inside.
Adrian interrupted their argument, “Dumbledore,” he looked the old man in the eye, “if any students die during this tournament then their blood will be on your hands. That includes any permanent injuries or emotional trauma.” Dumbledore met his gaze. “If you see it fit to put their lives at risk then if they die it will be on you. Not them, not the families, on you. I will make the entire world know that when the reporters come.”
She made her way through the maze, doing her best to keep going towards the center. At one point she rounded a corner and saw the edges of the Quidditch goal posts over the hedges. From those she could determine she was near the center but still closer to the side she started from.
The fire changed purple. A smoldering scrap of parchment shot out. He snatched it from the air and read out, “the first champion from Beauxbatons is Fleur Delacour.” All the students in blue robes clapped and cheered as a blonde girl stood up. She approached the headmaster and shook his hand. He directed her to the backroom where the champions would wait for further instruction.
Hagrid nodded. “Oh yes, many beasts and whatnot.” He caught her look and amended, “but nothing that will be too dangerous. I can’t say what will be in there but it won’t be anything too exciting.” They all knew what Hagrid’s idea of exciting was. Arlene was actually happy to hear that nothing exciting would be in the maze. There had been enough excitement in the past two and half years for a lifetime.
The sun was out. Just enough cloud cover to keep it from being uncomfortable. Not a rain cloud in sight. Birds flew and chirped in the air. The world around them had cooled just enough for someone who wasn’t nervous to be comfortable. A gentle breeze pushed small ripples across the surface of the lake. As they neared it a single tentacle from the giant squid could be seen as it dived.
The door opened but Arlene felt she might’ve gone too far. A hand gripped one of hers. She glanced over to see Luna was holding her hand. She reassured her, “don’t worry, I’ll help you get into the tower.” In that moment she looked really beautiful.
He knew he was a muggle and that meant his burial was a muggle affair. So he would have to check the muggle records. He apparated to the closest to that office he had ever been. It was a short walk to the office. He went in and went to the first desk he saw.
She looked to the snow. She didn’t know how to verbalize what she was thinking. The words began to pour from her mouth, “so, you’re legally my guardian. We’ve been living together for over a year now. You’re the best father figure I’ve had to look up to.” Her words stopped coming. He waited patiently for her to figure things out. She forced herself to say, “I’ve started calling Joan mom and I know you two aren’t married but I want to call you something. It’s not your name.” She wanted to say the words but they wouldn’t come to her. She couldn’t get them past her teeth.
He threw down his copy of the Daily Prophet and answered, “I have not. I would certainly like to know where they are as well.” He took a swig from his personal flask. That was when Ginny noticed the article he had been reading.
Malfoy immediately marched in front of him and demanded, “excuse me? Did you just insult me? My father will hear about this.”
For the next week she would go down to Hagrid’s at least once a day and knock on his door. She didn’t get a response any of those times. After another week of researching she felt like she had read every book in the library on dragons. She still had no way of defeating one without using her own magic.
He drew his wand and moved towards the house. It probably didn’t concern him. If someone had seen him at the grave then he wanted to know who it was. Besides the house was supposed to be abandoned.
George held a hand out to Harry and said, “now you promised. Didn’t he Freddie?” Harry handed him a small stack of Galleons. He stood up straighter and said, “pleasure doing business with you.” Him and George left the room and closed the door after them.
The doors slammed shut after her and chatter returned to the room. Arlene picked up her spoon from where she dropped it on the plate. She resumed eating her lunch as Luna commented, “I like her. She has the right idea.”
“Thank you,” she put them on and informed him, “these fit perfect. The amulet I gave you will protect you from small dangers.”
Her gaze hardened. She turned to him and glared into his eyes, “I’ll never be your lover, Severus. I’m dead. You were supposed to be my best friend but you could never accept that.” She leaned forward. “Now, start moving on and living your life because Dumbledore is going to kill everyone on the planet in a few years.”
They sat down but almost immediately an Egyptian woman approached them and asked in English, “Mrs. Connery? Please follow me to the magical families histories section.” They stood up and followed her to a different elevator. This one was part of one of the marble pillars and it took them up. She explained to her as they traveled, “this is the largest magical library in the world. It boasts over ten billion books from all ages and all places. Some places that don’t even exist anymore. We serve magical peoples from all over the world on a daily basis.”
Arlene shrugged. “To be honest, after the second one I think they’ll tone things down. It’s just a maze. I don’t even have to win this one.” She smiled. “I’m not worried about it at all.”
Professor Flitwick, who was great at cheering people up, told her, “this isn’t right and we’ll get it fixed.” He took her hand in a caring way.
Before they left the jerk Ravenclaw boy, who I refuse to name, came by and coughed, “losers,” into his hand.
Arlene flinched as an image burned itself into her mind. A floating skull with horns and it was on fire.
The hospital wing was flooded with staff and ministry workers then. Three more stretchers came in with Charlie holding his arm but standing. Four had been injured when the dragon’s tail raked the front row. None of them were as bad as Bastion so Madam Pomfrey focused on him.
Fred backed him up, “you seem to be right. Our sister is here and where else do we belong but by her side?”
Sirius and Remus nodded. They had everything covered. Their plan was foolproof. So why did Adrian still feel like something was going to go wrong?
“Your help in making a potion that will put a dragon to sleep.” She delivered it well enough that he was stunned into silence for a few seconds.
She stopped to help her up. The masked figures began advancing on the two of them. Luna got to her feet but the tent next to them exploded in flames. Arlene readied her magic to fight. Then a figure leaped from the burning fight and began to fight all five of the men in front of her. Adrian Barnes held off the attackers long enough for her and Luna to escape.
Remus urged them on, “Go on all of you. The train won’t wait for you.” The children waved bye to him. He waved back. “Good luck. I’ll be here if you still need help.”
He responded with a little disappointment in his heart, “I will not murder Rita Skeeter without your permission.” He took a deep breath and asked, “you ever read the article she wrote on me after my family was killed?”
It was a few seconds before they passed the tops of the pyramids. He took them higher in the air and then leveled out. She was behind him and had her arms wrapped around his waist. “Hold on,” he told her. She tightened her arms around him and he sped off.
Life at Hogwarts had changed. Life in general had changed. After the night that Ron Weasley died the world would never be the same.
Bastion and Arlene sat down. Time passed as the usual sounds came from the stadium. Fleur was gone longer than the others had been but she came back unharmed with her egg. She told them, “I made it sleep. I got by just fine.”
She looked at her with a raised eyebrow and said, “this was your idea.” Luna didn’t respond to that so she said, “We should see the sights first. I don’t want to carry stuff around all day.” After a moment she added, “maybe grab a butter beer at the Three Broomsticks.”
A pained expression appeared on Mr. Weasley’s face. Then he said, “Fred, George. Get the others to the backup portkeys. That’s where everyone is heading. They’ll take us to the same place the old one did. Get everyone back to the burrow.” Before anyone could argue against him he and the stranger left.
Adrian was wearing a cheap suit so when the muggle clerk saw him he instantly trusted him. Not so rich as to be an aristocratic asshole and not some poor crazy person. He acted tired and asked, “hi, I’m sorry to disturb you but can you help me find the grave of a friend of my father’s?”
The two seconds that Harry took to look at his friends’ shrugs stretched on for an eternity. They all shared a glance. Their expressions and shrugs told him they didn’t mind. This did little to ease his nerves. Harry said, “sure.” He stood up.
He didn’t summon an extra log for the fire. He didn’t go get another from the pile in the corner. He did nothing to stave off the coming cold.
Mr. Bagman excitedly announced, “the first trial will begin shortly my champions. First we need to lay down the ground rules. Gather around.” He waved them all closer. Arlene got up and got as close as she could with the eight others pressing in around her. Mr. Bagman began explaining, “at the end of this trial only six of you will remain in this tournament. It is an easy task. A race through an obstacle course.”
Care of magical creatures was fun. Hagrid kept things simple by having them study the bicorns. He kept saying that things would get more exciting if nothing went wrong. He was being cautious after last year and no one blamed him.
Seconds later ministry workers levitated a stretcher through the tent. Krum lay on it with his face clenched in a grimace of pain. He held his egg in the crook of his arm. His left leg had three massive gashes in it.
sorry about the late chapter. This chapter is to help Snape grow and not to hate on him. I just wanted to clarify that.
“Like Hell you are.” Sirius wasn’t having any of it. He told him, “this is who killed our friends. We want answers. We can fight too. We knew it was dangerous.”
In this moment she had an idea. The idea that the ministry had assassinated her family and left her in a muggle orphanage.
The sorting finished and the feast began. Instantly the plates in front of them filled withs mounds of foods. The wide range included roast chicken, mashed potatoes, scones, roast beef, and all sorts of foods that you can imagine. Having eaten little that day knowing the feast was to come, they dug in and ate to their fill.
Adrian answered, “I added sound dampening to the list of spells.” He drank some water from a canteen. “Small sounds like snores and bugs chirping wouldn’t get through.”
She wouldn’t tell him. Since he was so smart then he could figure it out on his own. Her family didn’t need to know yet either. They could piece it together like she had. She wouldn’t be forced to marry someone she didn’t want to. She could pursue her own love, her own dreams. She didn’t even have to get married if she didn’t want to. Ginny could do whatever the fuck she wanted to.
She ran forward towards the scepters. The troll was too blind to even notice. Lee was screaming, “Connery made a flare from a rock! She’s blinded the troll! What a genius! The other troll is on her now!”
Adrian took cover as the spot he had been standing in was filled with hostile spells. A hand touched him. He swung his wand towards whoever touched him to find himself looking at Arlene and Ron. He put his wand down and said, “I told you to get out of here! What are you two doing?”
Arlene didn’t want to brag but five thousand wasn’t a lot to her. Especially to learn more about her family’s history. She told him, “I can pay.” She pulled out her check book and wrote one for five thousand and one hundred Galleons to copy the three books.
She shook her head in a no. She said, “I’m happy for you two. I hope he looks good for you too.” Arlene realized that getting ready seemed like a good idea. The trio told her bye and headed back to the Great Hall to hang out for a few more hours.
The world around them stayed beautiful and serene. The sun setting over the mountains. Birds gliding into the forests to return to their nests. Under the surface of the lake the giant squid swam lazily around. The world around them kept going, devoid of the notion that something beautiful had occurred between two young boys growing into men. The world carried on as normal. Except for those two. For them everything had become more wonderful and beautiful than ever before.
They headed back to the camp buzzing with conversation about the game. Thousands of witches and wizards poured from the stadium. They went back to their tents and Adrian began cooking up some steaks on the fire.
The gaggle of Ravenclaws reached Hagrid’s hut. He was already waiting outside. He waved them along and said, “this way please.” They followed him along the tree line at the edge of the forest. “Thought about going easy this year but there’s no fun in that. So we’re caring for Bicorns this year.”
Joan pointed to a scorched hole in her jacket and said, “that looks recent too. Funny how she can clean her shoes but not fix her jacket.”
Mr. Bagman went on, “with some creatures along the way.” He lifted a bag and pulled from it a golden scepter. It was about two feet long with an orb at the top of it. “There are six of these at the end of the obstacle course. All you have to do to move on to the next stage is to grab one of these.” He put the scepter away and added, “good luck, we will be back once the course is ready.”
The rest of the professors came running down. In the lead was Professor Barnes. He scooped her up in a hug and exclaimed, “that was one of the best uses of field alchemy I have ever seen!” This was immediately followed by him glaring at her and asking, “now why did you come in first when you were planning on flopping?”
The crowds were smaller than normal. People were walking fast in groups. They made their way to Gringotts to get their money. Wizard guards flanked the entrance to the bank. The goblins hadn’t changed much. They still loved Arlene and treated her with respect. Over the summer she had learned some Gobbleygook but was only able to say some sentences to them. They were still more than happy to hear their native language.
McGonagall backed him up, “good idea Diggory.” She looked to Dumbledore but he was already shaking his head.
“Mr. Weasley did I hear you right? I thought I heard you say nesting mother dragons?” Adrian was growing more nervous about this scenario by the second. Grubbly-Plank and Joan arrived by them.
Once she got there she found Ginny and Luna sitting at a table in a corner. She sat with them and told them, “I’m going to make it to the third trial.”
“I hate this fucking place,” she muttered under her breath as she marched yet another student who had gotten in a duel with Potter. Ever since the champions had been announced a week ago it felt like every student who put their name in but didn’t get chosen wanted to harass or duel him over it. Weasley didn’t have this problem. Everyone seemed to hate Potter for it because he was already famous.
“No,” the knocker responded. It still had that smug attitude. “You can’t answer the riddle then you can’t enter. Rules are rules.” It stopped moving and became still as metal.
Grubbly-Plank pointed to Hagrid and Adrian to tell them, “you two stay back.” She lowered her hands and said, “Winters, we’ll talk strategy.”
His lips went tight and he walked away while levitating his metal rods. That almost confirmed that it was about the dragons. Arlene said, “they must be getting the holding areas ready for them early.” A flutter of fear floated through her as she thought of all the steps necessary to hold such powerful beasts. She knew she was going to have to face those monsters.
Lee Jordan was doing the announcements just like during Quidditch and he said, “welcome to the first trial of the Triwizard tournament! Our champions are ready to begin! First some words from Mr. Ludo Bagman himself!” The stadium exploded in cheers.
McGonagall led them right to the dance floor and left them there. Luna and Arlene faced each other, then the music started. There was a second where neither of them moved before Luna took the lead. The music was something operatic but there seemed to be no source for it.
The rest of lunch went uneventfully but by the end of it almost everyone felt much better. Conversation had picked back up. Fred and George were cracking jokes again. Everyone was laughing and for a few hours they forgot about the World Cup.
Her heart pounded in her chest as she walked between the hedgerows. As the last contestant to enter the hedgerows closed behind her. She was trapped in. There was only one way to go now: forward.
Arlene stayed with Professors McGonagall and Flitwick. Joan stayed in the room with them. When all the others had left Joan asked, “Arlene how are you feeling?”
He walked back up to the castle and into the entrance hall to find Professor McGonagall examining the house points. She greeted him, “how was your trip?”
Adrian began walking down the hall saying, “I’ll see you later, Professor.” He knew she was trying to convince him to deal with Skeeter. He only had only one fight planned. The last he wanted to do. He just had to put an end to the threat to his kids and he could live in peace like he wanted.
Voldemort patted at his mouth and shook his head. Adrian pieced it together and said, “you can’t speak right now. Fine, I will restore you.” He kept glancing at the snake to make sure it wasn’t getting any ideas. “I will ask and you will answer. One question before we go any further: Did you kill James and Lily Potter?” Voldemort shook his head in a ‘no’. Adrian lowered his wand. “You will have much explaining to do when you can speak. Your answers will decide if you live or die.”
The stranger grabbed his arm and insisted, “this isn’t a joke. We need everyone in the ministry we can get.” He glanced at the children before leaning in a whispering in a quieter tone, “the minister is considering this an act of terrorism.”
I do have bad news: I'm taking two weeks off. The first chapter of book 4, Truth, will be dropped on Feb. 8th. I'm taking this time to advance write book 4 to keep ahead of myself. Stay safe and enjoy yourselves!
It sort of worked. He summoned something but it wasn’t Death. It called itself Abaddon, and claimed to be a spirit demon. Adrian made a deal with it. In exchange for his animal spirit the demon would give him the power to kill Michael. So he returned to the camp and demanded a rematch. This time he won and that was how he freed himself and the others from the camp.
There had to be a bigger resource of information out there. There had to be a larger library somewhere. Somewhere that hadn’t been tampered with. She went to the only Professor who didn’t have a class right now or in the case of Joan, sleeping in preparation for her night class.
Still some of the magic remained. Just knowing that someone was there who wanted to be with him. Someone who accepted and cared for him. It was nice. More than nice but that was the best word he could think of to describe it. After all this time he had finally confessed to Harry. A great weight had left his shoulders. A constant warmth filled him.
Luna made a scrunched up face and said, “it was nice but I prefer my own dances. Some of them drive Nargles away.” She reached towards the table and grabbed a slice of pudding.
In that moment he was truly impressed by her intelligence. He had known she was book smart and talented. Being able to deduce something that he had found out by accident was quite the feat. He smiled at her and pulled a jar from his pocket. Inside of it was Rita Skeeter in her beetle form. He commented, “I think this will suffice as evidence. You really are one of the brightest students here to figure out something I found out by accident.”
A pair of arms wrapped around his neck. One of the death eaters had jumped on him. The enemy’s wand poked him in the cheek. Adrian didn’t wait for him to cast a spell. He jerked his head enough that he could bite the wand. He threw multiple elbows into the death eater’s sides.
She went down towards the Great Hall but found the two people she was looking for before she got there. Fred and George were hiding something behind a suit of armor when she found them.
All too soon and far too late they reached the doors. They exited the castle. The weather was perfect for what Draco had planned. This also dashed any hopes of postponing it due to weather.
Author handed the lighter back to Adrian who pocketed it. Luna came out of the tent then and sat beside Arlene. “Good morning, any Wrackspurts trouble your sleep?”
Adrian responded, “I’m not sure.” He moved the steaks off the fire and told them, “We should eat up. Probably some idiot with his wand.” This was followed by another loud bang and some screams. It could’ve been screams of joy or screams of terror. She couldn’t tell. Adrian squinted in the direction of the noises. He picked up a steak and took a bite of it. He swallowed and said, “Mine.”
She looked at the boy and answered, “fight with Potter? I’ll see to it then.” Joan didn’t miss the tired look in her eyes. Regardless, she took the student from her and let her leave the office.
They had to go then. Several students came by them and congratulated them on their bravery. Students from all houses. Some of the staff too: Flitwick, McGonagall, Hagrid and others. Even Filch came by and congratulated them. Almost all of the ghosts did as well, a few told them it was a sign of the times progressing to a brighter future.
Lee Jordan was doing the commentary and he called out, “Harry Potter has just performed a summoning charm! He wants his broom. Perhaps he wants to outmaneuver the dragon.”
In the seconds after Ron’s death Arlene had put her hands on Ron and her dad, Adrian. Harry had put his hands on Ron and summoned the cup to them so they could get out of there. Remus and Sirius apparated away. Tom Riddle, Voldemort, or whatever his name was, was nowhere to be seen.
Rita begged, “I’m sorry. Please don’t hurt me.” She looked truly pathetic now. Her fingers took on a black shell like quality before returning to human quickly. That made him hesitate but not for long. He began to suspect something.
The explosion spell takes a heavy toll on the user’s magical reserve. The fifth time Adrian cast it the spell failed and he fell to his knees. He felt a hand on his shoulder then a second later he was whisked away by a portkey.
After she finished with her classes she headed for her dormitories and got out her books. In the hours of searching she had found three books from the billions in the Library of Alexandria. These three were the only ones that held any mention of her family history. This was from either the table of contents or the index as they did not have time to actually even skim through all the books that held information on families named Connery from Ireland.
Near the end of it Arlene started looking out the window more. She waited to see her favorite view in the world. This time it was obstructed. The castle and the mountains were there. Those two alone made for a spectacular view. The backdrop of stars were obstructed by clouds and rain. She found it beautiful still but in a different way. She enjoyed the view just as much as normal.
“About one to two hours I think. Don’t travel by broom much. Won’t be much longer than that. We’ll stop for a break if we need to.” He seemed calm about the whole thing.
The now young looking Dumbledore told him, “it’s a shame that I’ll have to hide this improvement. You may go now. Find Voldemort.”
George added, “great thing about being us is that most people will listen to us. And so, we have influenced the public to our favor.”
She closed the book and put it away with the others. She lay down with the intent to go to bed but wasn’t able to for several hours. Only when she heard Luna pass by was she able to relax enough to fall asleep.
Her eyes darted away and she said, “I wanted to hear it for myself. Sometimes my visions are wrong.” Her smile had shrunk to a smug little grin.
The troll got the full brunt of it. She heard the footsteps moving away as the troll yelled in pain. Looking away from the fire made the light far less intense. It was only intense when staring right at it. Like the troll had been when it bounced off its face.
Hagrid’s eyes filled with tears but he wiped them away before they fell. He nodded and said, “I’m scared. I’ve been scared they might hate me. The howlers haven’t helped. Angry parents keep sending me howlers telling me horrible things.”
After the three of them stopped laughing Arlene told them, “I have to go give my parents their gifts.”
Luna blushed but didn’t deny her hard work. She did say, “I love your gift. It was so thoughtful and sweet of you. I’m glad you want me to be safe.” She narrowed her eyes at Arlene. “You need to look out for your safety as well. I hope you got one for yourself.” She didn’t need to say out loud that she was referring to the tournament.
Hermione brought her head up and suggested, “you can bring in an element though. You can just bring one to the trial. What do you think could hurt a dragon?” She looked at the others for ideas.
They were soft and gentle. Luna smelled great. The light scent of butterbeer and hazelnut. Luna didn’t push too hard. Her hands were gentle on hers. Her skin was soft. It was over after a few seconds. As Luna pulled away she felt her knees wobble. Her hand shot out to catch herself on the fence.
Harry lay draped across Ron’s body crying loudly. It was then that an even worse sound ripped through the ears and hearts of everyone present, Molly Weasley’s scream at the sight of Ron’s body.
He pushed gently, “He’s dead now if that helps. I just need the father’s name. The blood father. If I can get that then I’ll be satisfied.” He smiled at her.
“As much as I could,” she answered and sat with him. He pushed a cup of coffee towards her. “Thanks,” she told him. It was still warm but she could tell it had been sitting out for a while.
Draco nodded. He had heard a rumor of a room that only appeared during certain times or when someone had a need for it. He didn’t know where this room was or how to locate it or if it was even real. They had to get to bed soon. Already they would be attacked with questions about where they had been after dinner. “I’ll let you know if I find anything. See you soon, Harry.”
He walked outside while responding to their goodbyes. Then he saw it. A flash of light that looked like a reflection. The paranoid part of his brain told him to check it out. The not-paranoid part told him it was just his imagination. He had just finished a conversation discussing resurrecting the worst dark wizard ever in plans to possibly kill one of the most beloved wizards alive.
He went into the woods to his side and took the long way around. Every lesson on sneaking returned to him. He was silent when he approached. He didn’t make a sound. Using magic he checked for detection spells as he got closer to his target location. So, he was really disappointed when he arrived and found nothing. Nothing except a pair of boot prints in the dirt. They faced downhill and in the direction of the house.
“No,” he shook his head, “you don’t need to do that. It’s my gift.” His mouth hung open slightly as if he was appalled at the idea of making someone pay for something he offered.
He now had two wands. He couldn’t cast two spells at once, no one could, but he could double the power of his attacks now. He cast the killing curse against two more death eaters. They dropped to the ground.
Professor McGonagall came in and shouted, “that was the worst display of behavior I have seen in my entire career here.” She turned to the adults, “you are grown men and women fighting like toddlers in front of students who look up to you for guidance. Yet you ignore the desires of the only person who handled things well in my opinion.” She turned to Arlene and told her, “for someone who got thrown into this without consent you handled yourself well. Some of the adults in this room could learn from your example.”
He fought to pull his hand away but pitch black tendrils were coming off of Dumbledore and into his skin. He screamed, “NO, NO, NO! PLEASE!”
Harry screamed, “YOU LIAR! Expelliarmis!” Voldemort turned to block the spell but didn’t launch any hostile spells at him. Adrian moved to intercept them but the death eaters had arrived.
A new light shone in Harry’s eyes. Before they had been filled with despair and misery. Now hope and wonder shone as he gazed over the beautiful landscape. “I’m living the best life I could’ve hoped for with them. I’m treated like an actual person instead of a burden. My new parents love me. They knew I was gay from the start and accepted me for it.”
The dragon roared as he moved away from the chaos. The dragon was confused by all the noise and sights. She didn’t notice Ron moving the golden egg under the cloak and making a break for it.
He walked over to the cage and went in a door to the cauldron. The liquid inside was at a boil. All the other ingredients had been added. He dropped Voldemort in. The next two seconds were a rush. He left the cage, locked it with a bolt, used his magic to melt the lock so it could not be reopened manually. The door was sealed to the cage magically and physically. The cauldron’s contents began to glow as he backed away.
She told her, “Arlene, if you’re in danger and the only way out is to use your magic, then use it. You have every right to live and fight for your life. Don’t worry about anything else. No matter what you do I’ll be by your side.” Her voice held up a little. Then she fought passed it to say, “cause you’re the daughter that I never knew I wanted.” Her eyes went wide. Joan had let it out. There was no going back. They were a family and that was that. “No matter what you do I’ll be by your side. So do whatever you have to do to survive.” She gave a weak smile. “If you can, do try to avoid using your magic. Or at least hide it. Hold your wand and try to make it look like you’re casting normal spells.”
Arlene waited until everyone was turned away and began drying her with her own magic. It felt good to literally let off some heat as she was still angry at the bully. She pushed a breeze of heated air at Luna’s hair and clothes to get the water out of them. Within minutes she was dry and Arlene only felt a little drained from it. They walked to their next class.
Ron walked over to Arlene and whispered to her, “you sure you’re ready?” She nodded even though she wasn’t sure she was ready. Ron only nodded back then walked away to do some pacing.
Adrian sat back down on his spot in the stadium. There was one more champion to face their dragon. He couldn’t get him mind off what had just happened. Arlene had somehow shown dominance over the dragon and convinced it to give up the golden egg. Of all the weird and strange things he had seen in his time that was strangest. He couldn’t rationalize it no matter what angle he thought about it from.
They stood in London but it was on fire. He could hear hostile spells being cast. Muggle gunfire was going off somewhere he couldn’t see. He looked down and screamed again. He was standing on skulls. Hundreds of them. He looked back to Dumbledore and then he knew what fear was. Dumbledore had aged ten years and his eyes had gone black. A mad smile split his face as he said, “look what we made Severus. The world will be cleansed of all the dirty ones. We will rule as we were always meant to.”
They both stood there with arms crossed. In the back of her mind she realized this was the first time she ever had parental figures team up on her. It was also the first time she didn’t have a good answer for them. “Uh…” was all that came out.
Arlene felt herself tense up. Adrian didn’t hesitate, “I held off the jerks long enough for everyone to escape.” She knew what he likely did to hold them off but he didn’t want to make it public knowledge. She understood why he did it. He had no choice in a battle of life or death against people who loved to kill. She knew he hated it but was one of the best at it.
On her way out, Joan pushed against Skeeter hard enough to make her stumble and told her, “watch it.” It was a mean thing to do but after all the lives Skeeter has ruined she deserved far worse. Skeeter scowled at her then recognized her. She smiled a gross smile as her green quill flew out on its own. She opened her mouth to speak until Joan snatched the quill and broke it in half with one hand. Skeeter faltered and looked down to the ground.
This one was strong. He was good at choking at least. He was having a hard time breathing. Adrian flipped his wand around in his hand and jabbed it backwards. He felt it dig into the death eater’s side. Doing the wand motion backwards was hard and something he hadn’t practiced in years. He still pulled it off. “Stupefy!”
She was greeted by the sight of dozens of house elves. None of them stopped working except for one. The only one with any semblance of clothes ran up to her and said, “welcome to the kitchens, my name is Dobby. May I ask your name perchance?”
Both of the Beauxbatons champions looked to Arlene and Luna and immediately gasped in surprise. They both left their partners to rush forward. Jules Bastion told them, “how wonderful, I didn’t know that the school was allowing for same-sex partners. That’s cool.”
She sat up and stretched. Luna shifted beside her but did not wake. She had the most dream-like expression on her face. Arlene stared at her for a minute then realized what she was doing. Her face got warm and she got up to get dressed.
Professor Snape took it and his face went pale. “T-this is far more than is needed. How can you afford this?” He put the check in his desk. Arlene only smiled in a smug manner. As someone who had never had a thing in life before she now loved being obscenely rich. Professor Snape said, “I’ll return what isn’t used. I’ll get the ingredients set aside for you. When they are ready I will send for you.”
That night she and Luna talked it over. They never reached a conclusion. They loved each other and wanted to go together. The idea of seeing two girls dancing together might be too much for some of the more narrow minded students and staff. The idea of taking a stand was bold but to actually do it was dangerous.
They began walking around the clearing looking for anything. It was obvious that there was nothing that would stop a rampaging dragon. Only trees surrounded them. Thick and old trees but not thick enough to stop a multi-ton beast. They would be enough to stop fire blasts though. He could jump up to the higher branches to get off spell from up high. Jumping high and falls weren’t a concern as long as he could cast the right spell.
The two ladies glanced at each other and they both understood that Hagrid fancied Madame Maxine. The two of them left Hagrid to his date and went back to the castle.
He threw himself in the open, shielded himself from a spell. He fired a disintegration spell at a death eater’s head and removed it. “Diffindo!” He slashed at a death eater’s neck and slit it. He blocked more spells coming at him.
They reached the right level and got off the elevator. Their guide led them past tall shelves in neat rows. Every shelf was well maintained. She stopped and gestured to a row of shelves. “This is the history of all families named Connery.”
Arlene saw Adrian taking some of Harry’s blood. After he finished he took the bag to a side room of the Great Hall that had a low hanging mist coming from it. As if the room had been magically chilled.
It wasn’t a dragon but Arlene could understand the confusion. It was a house sized carriage pulled by multiple massive winged horses. It pulled up and landed with the thunder of hooves and wheels slamming into the ground. It pulled up too close and many of the front row students retreated. Professor McGonagall demanded, “stay in line!”
He went back and barged in saying, “we’re being watched. You two no longer have a hand in this.” He grabbed the vial of his blood and told them, “I’m performing the ritual in a remote location far from here.”
Minutes later they were inside and walking towards the great hall. Arlene and Luna had to part from Ginny to go to Ravenclaw table. As they went through the sorting of the first years Luna noticed something. “There’s no Defense against the dark arts teacher.”
She could see a good path of rocks to jump along to get to the climbing wall. Only three more jumps  and she would be on it. Another gasp followed by a cheer and Lee announced, “Delacour avoids a fire jet and is the first to reach the rock wall. Delacour had indeed reached the wall and was climbing up it.
“Our hotel, we need a place to spend the nights.” He spun the broom around while searching. “It caters to traveling wizards so they’ll be able to tell us about the library as well.” He moved to the left and mumbled something. He moved to the left more and exclaimed, “ha! Found it.” He moved towards it and landed on the roof.
Ginny sat at the Gryffindor table with Luna across from her. She tapped the table with a spoon as she listened to Luna whisper to her about the problem of the Yule ball. She wanted to go with Arlene but didn’t want the homophobes of Hogwarts to target them.
Arlene smiled at her. They made their way to Ravenclaw tower. When they got there the raven asked, “Can you name three consecutive days without using the days of the week?”
Hagrid spoke up next. He stood up and asked, “Professor, I think we should be extra careful.” He held his hands up in an innocent gesture. “Not to criticize the school but the last few years we seem have had more than our fair share of bad luck.”
“Hey,” Charlie started happily then winced. He clutched at his ribs. After a second he said, “I’m glad my sister is making friends here. How is she? I rarely get to see her because of work.”
He nodded. All he had to do was make it past this trial then Ron had a straight shot to the top. All he knew was that it had something to do with dragons. Other than that he didn’t know what to do.
The dragon handlers moved the last dragon into position. A minute later the last champion walked into the arena. Jules Bastion held his head and wand high. He walked to the middle of the arena. He pointed the wand at himself and mouthed a spell he couldn’t hear.
The reality was that Neville was great at dancing. Somehow, whenever he began to dance his balance and foot placement became extraordinary. He had incredible rhythm. He lead Ginny across the floor effortlessly. The normally awkward boy took control and ruled the dance floor.
Joan asked her, “why don’t you tell us what happened there? Why did you cast a spell from under your jacket? Why did your photographer cast a spell from under his jacket?”
Cheers turned to confusion. Mutters filled the hall. A Hufflepuff named Cedric Diggory stood up and suggested, “headmaster if I may, perhaps someone else should take her spot. Her name might have been put in without her knowledge. Maybe we could do another drawing?”
Ginny only had to read a few lines to see what it was about. Somehow that bitch from the Daily Prophet had found out that Arlene couldn’t use her wand. She didn’t say anything about her unique magic though. Ginny’s vision went red for a second before she felt a gentle hand on her shoulder. He told her, “I know you’re angry. I am too. We need to find Arlene and tell her before she finds out this way. Right now she needs the support of her friends more than revenge.”
The crowd focused on her. Pure magnesium separated from the rest of the rock in the form she had wanted: long ribbons. She grabbed her ribbons and ran at the nearest troll. No one had managed to get past them yet. Arlene fueled her arm with magical strength and threw half her magnesium at the nearest troll. She raised the hand with her wand and shot the hottest fire she could summon at it.
For a second his eyes remained on the paper. He sat up and pulled one of his desk drawers open. He pulled out the things she was least expecting. He pulled a muggle handheld radio from it and told it, “Joan, I need you in my classroom. Family emergency.”
“What?” Severus said. The wind picked up. Leaves blew through the forest. He felt himself being pushed away.
They left all left the tent except for Rita Skeeter who leaned out and dragged her photographer in. She sauntered over to Harry and began harassing him. The photographer leered at Fleur like he had during the weighing of the wands.
The professors walked in. The headmaster seemed ecstatic about it and opened up with, “congratulations champions. I’m sure you’re all excited about the tournament.
“Fuckin’,” he breathed. In a bundle of blankets sat a wrinkly baby. Except baby wasn’t a good way to describe the horror of what he was looking at. It had snakelike features and seemed even more feeble than a human infant.
She held up a hand and raised a finger, “we’ve been on a stupid expensive date.” She raised another. “I’ve been living in your house for over a year now.” She raised a third finger. “You left me with seven kids in your house for a whole summer and didn’t even call.” She raised a forth. “I haven’t been laid in damn near three years and I want some good dick.”
It was almost time to go down. The champions were meeting early to make sure they could start the dance. Arlene asked Luna one more time, “are you sure about this?”
Remus smiled and said, “Dumbledore told us his real name was Tom Riddle. He came from a muggle orphanage but we don’t know the name of the orphanage.”
He was giving gentle applause for the champions but he didn’t feel any true joy for them. Only a hope they would get to go back to their normal lives after this. The fire flared again as another name shot out. This one was read out as, “the first champion from Hogwarts is Harry Potter.” Loud cheers came up from the Hogwarts students as he stood up and moved up to give his handshake.
Arlene levitated her boar and pushed it out into the stadium. Her heart beat fast in her chest but the Felix was kicking in. It gave her a sense of confidence. Then a voice in her head told her to read the dragon’s mind. She decided to. It would do nothing but give her an edge over her. Maybe a warning if she decided to strike at Arlene.
They spotted Victor Krum running around the lake. He passed them but gave a friendly wave. They waved back and Luna asked, “I thought you were a fan of him? Why don’t you ask for an autograph?”
Roars and cheers from the crowd could be heard from outside. Ron had come back with his egg unscathed. Krum was next.
Arlene felt a tug at her sleeve. She looked over to see Luna pointing out the door of the Great Hall. “Can we talk for a second?”
When she woke up the next morning the first thing she did was go down to breakfast to find Arlene and Luna. She didn’t find them there but she had gotten up later than usual. She went up to the staff table and asked Professor Barnes, “Professor, have you seen Arlene or Luna?”
They left and found all the other stores to be the same. Arlene realized quickly that it had to be because of the attack on the World Cup. They all did their shopping and left much faster than normal. Once they finished they went straight back to the burrow.
Luna’s eyes opened wide. “you used fire in the first trial. How can a squib use fire if the rest of the world doesn’t know she has a special magic?” She gained a mischievous smirk that was un-Luna-like.
Arlene was too in shock to think of a good comeback. She saw Joan throw the woman a glare. Then she approached her and tried to reassure her, “it’ll be okay. We’ll figure this out.”
She opened her eyes and sat up. Adrian was standing up already while holding out a hand for her. She grabbed it and pulled herself up. They got the three, thick books. Their guide led them back to the front desk and Adrian asked in Arabic to get them copied. He said something to him that made Adrian’s eyes widen up.
Joan smirked, “There, you’ve been injured for the year. Now it won’t happen again.” She giggled at him while he glared at her.
Arlene did have things to add. She nodded. Luna prepped another sheet of parchment and readied her quill. Arlene told her, “my adoptive dad takes in house elves and pays them. He also provides food, comfortable living spaces, and clothing for them. They are technically free but choose to work for him because he is good to them. His wealth is not much compared to the wealth of most families that have house elves. This shows that the abuse of house elves is a choice and not something they have to resort to.
“Sir?” Adrian opened his eyes and looked over at the clerk. “I found your friend.” He stood up and walked over to the desk. “The only cemetery in a village in Little Hangleton.”
Him and Joan exchanged a fearful glance. The one dragon they had fought in the past had been a nesting mother. Them and two others had been forced to fight one during their time in the camp. Adrian and Joan had been the only survivors and that was because they were smart enough to know when they had lost and to run away.
She spotted Joan and Adrian. Joan was talking with Professor Sprout while Adrian looked like he was fighting a headache.
Arlene told her, “hold on.” She ran back into class and grabbed the professor’s notes. A few seconds of reading told her the only thing she was wondering. The notes had been altered.
Professor Flitwick patted her shoulder and told her, “you’re brave too.” After she was done the charms professor put a cookie in her hand and told her, “take it easy. You might be lightheaded for a few minutes.”
Perfect copies of himself split from his body and spread out. Ten of them with the real Bastion making eleven. Adrian knew the spell. They were just illusions. They couldn’t cast spells or interact with the physical world. The copies could distract a dragon though.
Arlene sent her a message, “Yes, I just want the golden egg. It is a fake. No children are in it.” She was talking to a dragon. Then she realized that this was how it was done.
Hermione slammed her book shut and growled at it. Ginny asked them, “do we have idea where it’ll be? Maybe Arlene can do something with alchemy again?”
McGonagall said, “each of you has a chest with your name on it. Inside is gear set up for you.” She left out the door that they had entered.
Adrian answered as he picked up a bundle of blankets from the ground, “might not be the right thing but it is the necessary thing.” He pulled some cloth away to reveal the face of Voldemort. “You’re going to play nice. Don’t try anything. I have prepared for every scenario,” he lied. “Tell us what we want to know and you just might leave this graveyard alive.”
To say it was unexpected would be an understatement. Her mind shot out in all directions like tendrils. One latched onto Joan’s mind. Some reached out to the nearest ghosts. The birds and owls on top of the astronomy tower were caught up. In an instant she knew all the thoughts of those around her. Joan was wondering about her progress. An owl was about to take off to go hunting. The ghosts were anticipating someone’s deathday party.
Ron stood up and exclaimed, “yes!” while pumping a fist into the air. “Thank you so much.” He sat down but had a massive smile on his face. Hermione shook her head. She seemed disappointed but she didn’t say anything to them.
The next day Draco Malfoy was making his way towards the Great Hall for dinner. He spotted Harry and the others at Gryffindor table. He made his way over to them. His heart beat rapidly in his chest. He rubbed the sweat from his palms as he walked between tables. Remembering the words he had practiced was becoming harder as he got closer. Then he was there.
It might not be. It probably wasn’t her. Arlene didn’t think of herself as having many attractive qualities. She liked butterbeer too much. She didn’t have any cool skills. She didn’t even have a family. Who could ever love her?
She slapped a hand to the table making Arlene flinch. “That’s the thing. I can’t find anything on it. Not a single reference to house elves in Hogwarts, A History.”
Joan told her, “go ask Professor Snape about that sleeping potion. Then find us later and we’ll talk more strategy.”
The knocker responded, “a woman shoots her husband, then holds him underwater for five minutes. Next, she hangs him. At the end of all that, they enjoy a lovely dinner. How could they do this?”
Arlene walked up to his bed. He bore a resemblance to Mr. Weasley. She said, “yes. My name’s Arlene.”
Ron told them, “I don’t care. We all grab it at once. We all risked our lives for this. They can say there was more than one winner. That’s up to them.” He raised his hand but didn’t grab it. Arlene raised her hand. Harry raised his. Ron began a count down, “on three. One, two, three!” They all grabbed it at once and were whisked away via a portkey.
Voldemort kept having to stop fighting the death eaters to shield himself from Harry’s spells. Harry continued to attack Voldemort while screaming at him. He only stopped the spells and didn’t say anything to him. He would take cover from Harry to attack the death eaters.
The worry and fear that had rooted him in place stayed on the ground. He rose in the air far above the highest seats of the stadium. Once there he surveyed the scene before him. The dragon was right over her eggs. He was going to have to get her to move.
Arlene kept her self under better control than last time but still found her attractive. “I’m doing well. Nothing dangerous has happened since then.” Arlene leaned back and went on, “I know a butterbeer would help me relax though.”
Harry told him, “I know but it shouldn’t be like this.” His eyebrows softened as if in defeat. “I don’t want to put you in danger though. It is bad if your dad finds out.” His eyes closed and he rubbed his temples as if trying to stave off a headache. “I’ll just find a girl to go with. Maybe I can take Hermione as a friend. Nothing says the partners have to like each other romantically.”
Luna had already opened her gift. It was not homemade and it was definitely store bought. She had received another necklace. This one had a silver coated chain with a sapphire the size of the pad of Luna’s thumb. It was obviously magical just from the touch of it. As she pulled it from the box Luna’s eyes went wide with happiness.
All over the pages about wars between goblins and wizards lay black ink covering entire paragraphs at a time. Over half of the history was hidden. She had a strong feeling that it was her history hidden. Of course sloppy work like this could be done with Professor Binns because he wouldn’t notice if Hogwarts exploded.
Both Cairo and Alexandria were near the Nile river so the land below them was sprawling farmland that took advantage of the nearby water. Off to her left she could see the desert proper but mostly it was farmland. The city of Alexandria is right on the coast of the Mediterranean sea. A little under an hour after they set off it appeared on the horizon.
Dumbledore resumed speaking as the room became quiet, “the winner of the tournament will receive ten thousand Galleons and the Triwizard cup.” Behind him a crystal trophy had been set on the staff table. It seemed to glow from within. It had a handle on either side with a “W” on the cup part.
The knocker seemed almost smug as it asked, “I have no houses but I have cities. I have no trees but I have mountains. I have no fish but I have water. What am I?”
He actually blushed and stammered some. He managed to say, “sometimes I just feel like cleaning up the place.” He looked out the window.
Jules Bastion would live. Thanks to the excellent work of Madam Pomfrey he would also retain the full use of his leg. It had been reattached with no complications. Madam Pomfrey had worked through the night to make it happen. After all the other patients had been stabilized she went to scream at Dumbledore.
She responded, “we’re needed down in the forest. Hagrid and Grubbly-Plank need help. This is from McGonagall.”
The relief of years of pent up stress finally being freed was too much for him. Tears flowed openly from his eyes. He held himself as he wept. Years of repressing his true self. Every hour of every day pretending to be something he wasn’t. Living with a family who would hate him if they knew who he really was. It had been so hard living this way. To finally be able to express himself. Even in this small moment. It was such a relief to his mind.
He shook his head. Draco informed her, “as a champion, he’s required to bring a partner too.” He looked at Harry and told him, “I understand if you want to go with a girl. I’m honestly afraid of my dad finding out about my preference.”
Harry offered, “likely Professor Karkaroff will cry to Professor Dumbledore about it.” He smirked at his small attempt at humor.
Arlene shook her head. “No, she really wanted to talk to Harry. I’m hoping she ignores me.” Arlene seemed bored. As if she would be almost anywhere but here. “Joan, I really need to talk to you after this.”
In this moment Joan Winters understood how Adrian felt when Arlene got chosen by the goblet. She knew because she was going to commit a crime when she got to Skeeter. If all she saw was a monster then that’s what she’ll get. There was no way she was going to let that bitch near her daughter.
It had been a long time since Adrian had felt true fear. He did now. All he could say was, “no, please no. Please no.” He was powerless. Arlene would face the dragon in two days.
The headmaster stood up and said, “welcome, students, teachers, and guests. Let us start things right with a grand feast. I’m sure our guests are hungry after such a long journey.” With that the platters filled with food. New foods were included in the selection though. Foods Arlene didn’t recognize. They must’ve been from wherever the other students were from. The girl beside her smiled and dug into one of the new dishes. Arlene just grabbed some food she was used to and ate normally. Luna on the other hand was eager to try the new foods. She grabbed all the new foods within reach and began sampling them all. Her face made weird shapes between foods she liked or hated.
Ginny knocked on the door and Hagrid opened it. Once he saw them he said, “come on in. Where’s Arlene?”
At that moment Victor Krum ran by and said, “excuse me, have either of you Hermione Granger.” Except he mispronounced Hermione’s name. He was still close enough for them to know what he meant.
Joan told him, “I don’t think you should challenge the person who signs my paychecks to a deathmatch.” She had a half smile when she said it though.
Professor McGonagall nodded and said, “I accept your apology. Thank you for being mature about your mistake.” She raised her eyebrows. “Believe me, I understand your emotions, I feel them too.”
Hagrid looked away at that point. Adrian knew he was having an effect. “They needed your help a few weeks ago. With this particular thing that we’re dealing with now.” He still didn’t speak. Adrian stopped walking and grabbed his sleeve. He finally looked at him as he told him, “no one gives a fuck about you being half-giant. You are still the same person. Mr. Potter sees you as a fatherly figure and it hurts him to see you this way.” He waved his arms around in frustration, “of all people I know what it’s like to have that Skeeter bitch write something about you and people judge you for it. She called me and my only friends at the time crazed baby killers. Then a few years later she accused me of murdering my family.
Ginny found herself being asked more questions about Arlene. She didn’t answer any except to tell people how much of a great friend she was. For once Rita Skeeter hadn’t ruined things as she had planned. Even Professor Barnes got over his anger and found it all hilarious.
Normally he didn’t dream much. Tonight he did and they started strange and got weirder as the night went on. He was dreaming of a home in a field. The only thing around was two children playing in the dirt in front of the house. He walked toward them and scolded, “get out of the dirt you’ll get dirty.”
After they talked with the kids they had both gone to his bedroom and gotten drunk. They figured might as well start easing the stress off now before they had to be sober to deal with whatever crap this tournament threw at them. In the privacy of his room they weren’t worried about being bad influences or getting caught. As long as no students found out then it wasn’t a problem.
Arlene held up a hand to calm him. “It’s fine Hagrid. I wasn’t trying to get the news spread out all that well. I really wanted to forget about it.” The butterbeers arrived. Madam Rosmerta had to leave to see to another table so they couldn’t talk to her. Arlene took a drink and fell in love with it all over again.
She went on with the story, “we did what we could to slow down the fires. The ministry came in and told us we had to leave. They pretty much forced us to go to the hospital.” She gestured to her friend, “he spent most of the time there insisting he was fine until one of the healers put him to sleep. The he woke up and tried to drink Phoenix tears.”
She still wanted to know who had betrayed her family but she didn’t think that anyone knew now. It was over a decade old now. A cold case for sure. She wasn’t sure if the information even existed anymore.
She shook her head. “exploding desserts.” Before he could respond she said, “Professor, promise me you won’t murder that Skeeter woman.”
They left the common room to meet up with Ginny. She was waiting in the Great Hall for them with a single custard on a dish in front of her. As soon as they walked up she warned them, “don’t eat that custard. That was my gift from Fred and George and I don’t trust it.”
Joan rubbed her shoulder and said, “let’s take a break for the rest of the day. You seem to have gotten the hang of it well.”
He smiled and waved down her thanks. “Not a problem. I enjoyed being able to come back to London for a bit. I’m glad to keep you safe as well.” He gestured out to the crowd, “now go find your friends. You’ll need to find a compartment together.”
He walked in the house to find Sirius and Remus holding each other. Sirius barked at him, “what was that!”
Adrian looked at her. “Maybe. I’d say it is worth a shot.” Then he told her, “Joan and I have fought exactly one dragon before. That was the worst fight I have ever been in even with all our skills and training. I do not recommend fighting this thing head on. Focus on moving. Use the terrain and the environment to your advantage. Take cover when you can.”
He answered, “the dirt on Dumbledore. He set up that dragon freak out right? I’ll tell you how he did it. I’ll tell you the why too.” His face betrayed nothing.
Adrian didn’t hear Arlene scream in terror. He didn’t hear Harry’s cry of anguish. He didn’t hear Remus calling for them to retreat. Adrian only heard the voices in his head telling him one word, “kill, kill, kill.”
Ginny still didn’t know why she had asked him to go to the ball with her. It had just popped out of her mouth. It had been a surprise to both of them. They had ended up going together. She didn’t expect much to happen that night. She didn’t expect to have much of a good time.
With her magic she was learning how to temporarily boost her physical abilities. Her strength and speed she could almost double. She was getting better at improving her eyesight and hearing. She could even improve her sense of smell.  Joan was ecstatic with her progress.
In her first year she had received a book on her family. It had given a light history but it talked about her family being able to talk to dragons. She was now doing just that.
His broom lost control and he rolled into the ground. His back hit the far wall of the stadium and pain roared through his body. He ripped off his robes to reveal his jeans and t-shirt underneath.
Ginny narrowed her eyes at her and said, “am I the one who needs protection right now?” Arlene showed her the amulet that she had gotten herself. Ginny nodded in approval. Then she opened Luna’s gift. Luna had gotten her a jersey from the Hollyhead Harpies. She smiled and told Luna, “thank you. This is great.” She looked at Arlene and reassured her, “I love your gift too Arlene. It is very nice of you.”
He had already put it on. “Thank you. It looks nice too.” He told Luna and Ginny, “sorry, I don’t have gifts for you guys. I’ve had a lot on my plate lately.”
Arlene gave a fierce smile and said, “I’m in full support of you Ginny. I never liked that creepy old man anyway. Let’s get your freedom.”
On the other hand there were plenty of madmen and women in politics. Assassinations had been done before for trivial things. Politicians had been killing each other over small problems for centuries. The corrupt and inept found it favorable to actually doing their jobs.
A second that time didn’t move in held her. Then she threw herself into his chest. He held her as she sobbed, “yes, please. Please call me that. I’ll call you dad.”
She saw Adrian blink in confusion and mouth the word she just used before shaking his head and focusing on the fire. She told her, “No. I slept good. How about you?”
Luna told her, “I agree with her. Their thinking is clearly been warped by wrackspurts.” She shook her head as if it was a tragedy.
The smile returned but it seemed more awkward than before. Luna patted her hand and told her, “After dinner we can come back and check it out. I appreciate the thought. I’m hungry.” She led her down to the Great Hall for dinner.
“I know. I think she and I are going to have a private conversation about that article before she leaves.” Adrian maintained a straight face.
“Nice one dad.” Fred said from inside the tent. The twins came out and greeted everyone together, “Good morning everyone.” Everyone greeted them back but Joan went inside the tent. She still didn’t like their synchronization.
She kept that face and said, “they showed me that you close your eyes and something magical happens.”
He knocked on the door to their house. Sirius answered the door in an open shirt and surf shorts. He opened the door and said, “come in. How’s the school?”
Luna nodded and got up to hug her. She returned it. They kept hugging as the others passed but none of them said anything. Arlene didn’t know what to say. She felt like she had failed Luna somehow. Luna patted her back and whispered to her, “I still love you. Whatever you do please be safe and remember those who love you.”
Adrian couldn’t deny them this. James and Lily had been their friends after all. He set the vial back down and said, “alright but humor me about the remote location. Please. I’ll tell you when I find a good location.”
An explosion of noise entered the clearing as six massive cages and dozens of wizards entered the clearing at the same time. Charlie charged forward to help the others wrangle the dragons. Roars of anger and rage shook the forest.
She turned around and walked over to him. She asked him, “how are you holding up? Do you need anything?”
That gave Arlene hope for her idea. Her method of putting it to sleep was different though. She didn’t know how long the potion would take to put an effect on the dragon.
The fire was slowly dying, the coals and last few flames only giving off a small heat. He needed that heat. The dungeons were easily the coldest place in the school. He would get sick without the extra heat.
Of course he could always be persuaded to do another with a well written article about the wrong person.
Barty told him, “Tom got free of Dumbledore’s control. We need to find him before Lucius does. Dumbledore still doesn’t know that we’re working against him. We know the truth of Tom Riddle but not many others do. He’ll be hiding. He might try to find Harry Potter to get the truth to him.”
Adrian looked out at the cage. A naked Voldemort pulled his wand from the robes he had been wrapped up in as a baby. There hadn’t been a wand in them before. Adrian checked three times. He was fully adult now and human looking. He donned the robe and tied it to cover himself up.
She put them on and the sunlight was far less intense on her eyes. The sight that greeted her was spectacular. They had apparated not far from the pyramids. She spent several minutes while Adrian cast charms on them to protect their skin from the sand and sun. He also cast spells to protect them during the flight to Alexandria.
He cocked his head to the side in confusion then understanding dawned on his face. “Oh,” he said then a smile showed. Arlene knew that he wasn’t going to hate her for her preferences. “The rules don’t say anything about that. It is legal in the magical community.” He put a hand to his chest. “I have nothing against it.” He lowered his hand and leaned forward. “I’ll support you but I can’t guarantee others will. Give it some thought. It is a bold statement in times like this.” He sat back and said, “I wish it wasn’t like this. I don’t want others to hate you over something that you can’t choose but it is the world we live in for the time being.”
Two days later Adrian Barnes sat in the staff room of Hogwarts along with all the other professors. This was the pre-school year talk. Where they would discuss schedules, new rules, major events, and anything else that needed to be figured out before the students arrived.
She told him, “I’m enjoying them. I chose Gobblygook, Care of magical creatures, and Alchemy as my elective classes this year. I’m passing them all.”
In a massive coincidence that I made since I’m a lazy ass writer, Hermione was walking towards them from the other direction. They pointed that way and he said, “oh, thank you.” Then he ran towards Hermione.
Harry and Ron woke up and went to the entrance hall where the champions were meeting up. Professor McGonagall was waiting for them. All the other champions were there so Professor McGonagall led them out as she said, “the second trial will take place in an arena near the forbidden forest. The rest of the students will begin arriving in half an hour. You champions will be set up in a tent the will lead into the arena. In the tent you will don your gear and set up whatever you need.”
The old man responded, “Daniel. The last family that lived in that house got murdered. No one knows how it was done. Most don’t even think of it as a murder but I know one when I hear it.”
He could still hear Lily as she told him, “be nicer to my son. He’s not James. Don’t trust Dumbledore. Life your life Severus, don’t let me hold you back.”
He and Joan sat next to each other. Dumbledore walked in and announced, “welcome everyone to the start of an exciting new year. Does anyone have anything to say before we get started?”
“Just hoping I don’t get injured this year,” he said in a tired voice. “First year here I got almost bit in half and loaded with poison. Second year I got stabbed twice and fell over two hundred meters. I was hoping this year would be normal. Or at least I wouldn’t get injured.”
The rocks looked harder to run and jump on leaving only the dirt to move on. The mud pits were more frequent as well as the gaps and pitfalls. Then at the end, flanking the row of scepters, were two enormous trolls with muzzles over their mouths. “Shit,” she breathed but continued.
At the end of that week she braved her parents. She stayed back after an Alchemy class to talk to Adrian. She walked up to his desk. There was no way he would handle this well. There was no way to put it gently. She asked, “dad, how do I fight a dragon?”
She returned to the table and told them, “the knocker wouldn’t let me in. I was going to grab a book I got from the Library of Alexandria.”
They both looked at her before Hermione explained, “It’s a cease and desist letter from the ministry. They’re ordering me to stop all anti-slavery actions or face legal repercussions.” She wrung her hands.
Only he didn’t go about planning his next lessons. He went down to the edge of the grounds and apparated to where Remus and Sirius were living with Harry Potter.
In the distance she heard Adrian yelling, “that’s my daughter!” she heard Joan join in and smiled as she walked back into the tent.
Then he woke up in his bed covered in sweat and panting deeply. He didn’t know how he knew but he knew that he had actually talked to Lily. He also knew she wasn’t happy with him. She wanted him to be nicer to Harry and move on from her. This event is what got to him. This is what moved him to become the man that he was needed to be.
Arlene let them lead her down the new corridor. Then another. They were leading her someone in particular but they wouldn’t tell. “Just tell me,” she demanded.
Arlene left the hospital wing unaware of her surroundings. It hadn’t been until now that she thought about the others’ motivations for the tournament. Everyone who had entered had a reason to do so.
The paper crumpled in her iron grip. She threw it at the desk and stormed out. There was no point talking to the ghost about it. He probably didn’t even know that his notes had been altered.
Joan told Adrian in between breaths, “it was Skeeter. She shot something at the dragon while her photographer made the copies vanish. I saw them.”
They laughed and sat down with them. They received less odd looks with the twins there. All the students liked them so it was hard to judge them for doing the same thing. They laughed and made jokes. It sent most of the gloom away but not all of it. In the back of her mind Arlene knew the first trial was looming over her like storm clouds. Soon the thunder would be on them.
On the other hand she couldn’t help but notice how pretty Luna was. She loved her beautiful hair. The look in her eyes when she was happy. The way she smiled at the smallest things.
Hermione huffed but didn’t argue with her logic. The biggest question was: why was the ministry getting involved at all?
Now invisible, he passed right by a lighthouse that looked ancient. He pointed to it and said, “based on what my research says that’s where the entrance to the library is.”
A week later Arlene still hated this tournament. No matter where she went she received sneers and glares. Some people even made badges that read, “Weasley is our king,” or, “Potter you rotter.” There were less of them but Arlene saw some about her. “Connery the dummy,” was a popular one. She hated it of course. It didn’t even rhyme like it wanted to.
“You could get expelled!” He couldn’t believe that someone he had just admired the intelligence of thought it was a good idea to keep a person in a jar. He held it up over his head as she reached for it again. “What are you doing? I’m not letting you keep a human around.” He turned to walk away. Then he felt a spell hit him in the back.
Her face lit up and her hands went to her mouth. Not even that could hide her smile though. Then a thought occurred to her. Arlene asked, “Luna, did you know my answer?”
He turned to see an old man standing next to him. He remained where he was and asked, “what makes you say that?” He nodded towards him and introduced himself with a fake name, “Evan.”
Mr. Crouch said, “what may have started as a prank is now a chance for destiny. The rules are final. Whatever names come out of the Goblet of Fire will participate in the tournament.”
They got their money and left. They went to the robes store first to get new robes. Something was off from the moment they walked in. Madam Malkin wasn’t as talkative as normal. She was faster with the measurements and once they had the robes she urged them to pay fast. She was polite but she seemed to be urging them to leave.
He nodded. “You two are brave indeed. I am glad to see people standing up for themselves like you.” He smiled at them and then raised an arm towards the entrance hall and said, “the champions from Beauxbatons have arrived.” He walked back to Hermione then.
She started with the smallest one, which was a gathering of information on beasts’ rights in the past few centuries. After a few chapters she didn’t find anything that she didn’t already know. Her family helped beasts’ have more rights. Right now she wasn’t in a prime position to do that. She set that one aside and moved to the next book.
They went to Care of magical creatures. This was the first elective class they would have. It would be different than what they were used to but based on what happened last year it might be less exciting than they were expecting. Arlene asked Luna, “do you think Hagrid will try to keep things simple because of Draco’s accident last year?”
Arlene’s heart rate spiked up. A cold sweat broke on her hands. She had to fight to keep her breathing steady. Either something absolutely fantastic was about to happen or something terribly horrible. She had no clues to either one. Her mouth went dry as she forced out, “do you feel like telling?”
She looked behind her to see the other monster following her. She still had the other half of her magnesium. She threw it with her magically strengthened arm and followed it with a jet of blue flames. The bundle of ribbons bounced off the troll’s face and ignited. Arlene turned just in time to avoid being blinded.
Joan met with Arlene down the corridor and away from the crowd. The two of them ducked into a different classroom. Joan closed the door behind them. They pulled two chairs out and sat in them. Arlene asked, “Joan, since I can’t use my wand what am I supposed to do about the first task. I’ll fail it sure but what if I’m in danger? What if someone else is in danger? I can’t risk exposing my magic but I can’t just not act in a situation like that.”
An old, ragged, boot took them back to the forest by the Weasley’s home. The hike to the burrow was still long and silent. George was the first to show any sort of cheeriness. As they left the forest and found themselves in the clearing across from Ginny’s home, he told them, “look lively guys. Mom will have our heads if me and Fred bring home some sad blokes.”
Mr. Weasley’s eyes shifted away. He muttered out, “St. Mungo’s wizard hospital.” Before she could ask he chugged his coffee and stood up. “I have to go to work.” He pinched some Floo powder. He threw it in the fire, stepped in, and said, “Ministry of Magic,” all in one smooth motion.
Draco slapped his hand down on the table and asked, “then why can’t we do that?” He leaned against the table and answered his own question, “I know how two boys dancing at a ball looks. I know.”
As they stood there Luna began talking to her. “Arlene, can I ask you an odd question?” Arlene was confused and simply nodded. “If you care about it all would you prefer a boyfriend or girlfriend? I won’t judge you either way.”
Ginny only realized now what this meant for her. If Harry Potter was gay then she would never ever be able to seduce him. No matter how much money or power or fear Dumbledore used Harry would never love her in a romantic way. This was good since she didn’t love Harry that way either.
They had this class with Gryffindor. Ginny sat next to her and heard her say something. She leaned in and asked, “Did you say something?”
The day of the first trial arrived. All the champions were gathered in a large tent next to the Quidditch field. They angle they had approached from made the field hidden from them by the tent. Professor McGonagall had been the one to lead them to the field. This was done intentionally to prevent them from seeing what the trial would be ahead of time. Inside the tent were special robes for them.
Adrian had no patience left. He came out from behind the grave and flung two explosion spells at the approaching figures. They were close enough for him to see they were wearing masks.
She was distracted by the beauty of the room. The ceiling was as tall as the one in the Great Hall with snowflakes falling from it. The tree that had been in the Great Hall now presided over the center of the room. Garland strings ran from it to the walls and wound downward towards the floor. A grand stage had been set up on her left. Two buffet tales loaded with food sat on her right and in the middle was the dance floor.
Arlene laughed and said, “Yes, I ask for trouble to just come rushing at me.” Her and Luna left through the fireplace. Luna went right back to her home. Then Arlene and her adoptive parents went back to the beach house.
To say that Arlene was shocked was a large understatement. Her eyes were wide. She leaned back in the chair and said, “uh.”
Thunder clapped and the doors to the hall burst open. A scarred and limping man walking using a large staff. Every other step he took a loud clomp of wood sounded throughout the room. One of his eyes was clearly a fake as it was large and had a harness holding it in place. He scanned the room as if searching for enemies.
Joan smiled at them but flicked her wand at their own wood pile. It caught fire instantly. A full two minutes later, Author got the lighter to ignite but was so excited he dropped it. He picked it back and started over. Ginny gave Arlene a pleading look but she couldn’t do anything to help her. A minute later the man got the lighter working again and this time managed to light the fire. He raised his hands and cheered, “Completely muggle-like!”
“NO!” Professor Karkaroff yelled. “Only one Durmstrang student moves on while all three of the ones from Hogwarts move on? I smell a scam, Dumbledore.” He was glaring at the headmaster.
Her heart dropped a little but she knew it was the truth. Arlene nodded and peeked out of the curtains to make sure the coast was clear. They left the bed and got ready for sleep. They went to bed in their own beds. Arlene slept fitfully as she didn’t know what to expect from the next few days.
The trolls loomed over the contestants. Unchained but with no clubs they stood between them and the scepters. Champions kept moving forward only to be pushed back by a charging troll. The troll stopped charging once the champion backed off. They were intent on keeping them from the scepters.
This was one of the harder ones. Arlene’s mind went blank. She had no idea what the answer to this could be. Even thinking about it non-literally was too hard. There were too many options when thinking from one perspective that didn’t match up with the others. No answer came to her. The knocker even giggled at her and teased, “am I off my game now?”
He spat water everywhere with panic controlling him. He burst out, “after we what?!” He calmed down when he saw Joan laughing so hard she had to lean against the doorway. He wiped the water from his bare chest and commented, “hilarious. I was afraid I had gotten laid for the first time in two and a half years and not remembered.”
She fought to keep her breath steady. It had already been dark out even with the full moon tonight. The towering walls only made that worse. She could barely make out the walls of the maze. She focused her magic to her eyes and the world in front of her became clearer.
They led her to the same empty classroom that the weighing of the wands had taken place in. This time Harry, Ron, and Hermione were waiting for them. Six chairs were already set up with three of them taken up by the aforementioned people. Fred and George announced, “Arlene Connery as requested!”
Arlene’s flower had grown in the years she had kept it. She had to trim a few times already but she plucked one of the extra heads from it and stuck it in her hair.
Adrian walked in and answered, “the Triwizard tournament is a nightmare. Arlene was supposed to fail because she didn’t want to be in it. Then she goes and gets first place.” He waved to Remus who was wearing clothing similar to Sirius. “Harry is healthy and fine. He’s moving on to the second trial. Not bad in his studies but I do wish he had taken alchemy. Great art, not sure why he didn’t want to study it.” He pulled out the vial of his blood and put it on the table. “How are you two doing? Is the relationship good?” They looked panicked before he said, “I don’t care if you’re gay. Just don’t try to convert me. It is obvious though.”
He looked several years older as he explained, “this tournament isn’t the joke they’re making it out to be. It’s dangerous. People have died in it before. I can’t sit by and watch any of you die over a,” he spat the next words, “fucking game.”
Charlie laughed then winced in pain. He got his breathing under control and said, “that’s good to hear.” He rubbed his bandages, “I thought it was just a broken arm. Madam Pomfrey found a few broken ribs too. Hard to tell when most of the body is hurting. She won’t let me go until tonight.” He shook his head. “It’s strange being here again. I never thought I would end up back in Madam Pomfrey’s infirmary.”
A thought entered his mind. Do you ever care about Lily’s happiness? He shook it off. She would’ve been much happier with him over Potter.
Ginny was telling them, “a dragon’s eyes are the weakest spot on it. The underbelly is also quite weak.” She turned a page. “Unless the species they get has a chest plate of scales for protection.” She ran a hand through her hair.
They sat in the Ravenclaw common room. Others were scattered around them but most were off preparing for the ball. A tree had been set up in the corner by the fireplace. Garland and lights decorated the walls. Someone had set up a radio to play muggle Christmas music.
He nodded and answered, “Professor Flitwick told me you wanted to go. I’ve never been but I can figure it out.” He looked at the knocker and ordered it, “open up. She needs her things.”
Author got an excited look on his face and reached for the little device. He stared at it while trying to figure it out. He spun the striker but nothing happened except for sparks.
About half an hour later the train lurched and the trip to Hogwarts began. They chatted on the way there and discussed theories about the next Defense against the dark arts professor. Arlene got them some candy from the trolley as it passed.
Arlene began the long climb up the stairs. She reached the top of the astronomy tower and found Joan waiting at the top. Professor Winters waved at her and said, “hey, how was your first day back?”
The house elf shook his head sadly. “No one knows. We do wish we did though. We do know that the ministry has used your absence to put more and more harsh restrictions on house elves and other beasts.”
Luna smiled and explained, “I think I’m different.” Arlene’s heart cracked until she went on. “I don’t have a preference either way. I do know there is someone I want to be romantically involved with.”
By this point the Great Hall was empty except for two people: Ginny and Luna. They had stayed to wait for her. Ginny was the first one to speak, “are they forcing you to compete?” Arlene shrugged and told them everything that happened as they walked towards the Gryffindor common room. Ginny led the way and when Arlene finished she said, “that’s thick. You clearly don’t want to be a part of it. They’re trying to force you into just because your name came from a burning cup? Thickheads.” She was obviously disgusted by Arlene’s treatment.
He answered, “I’m going to ask for a private interview.” He emphasized, “she won’t be a problem when I’m done.” McGonagall hesitated for a moment. Then she nodded solemnly. He added, “I’ll resign after if you want me to.” He didn’t wait for her to answer after that.
Dumbledore entered the room and pulled Harry Potter from the clutches of Skeeter. Then began the weighing of the wands ceremony. She felt a thrill of panic but it vanished when she saw Arlene had her wand. That might be what she wanted to talk about later. Arlene couldn’t use her wand. She would have to find a way to hide her magic or solve the trials without using magic. Then again if she wanted to flop out of the tournament anyway failing the first trial would be a good way to do it.
After seeing Harry’s condition his fear was in full alert. He focused on his plan and walked out into the stadium. He walked out and immediately saw the massive green dragon guarding her eggs.
George jerked the box away as Fred said, “tut, tut, not polite to ask business men how they’re profits are when considering buying from them.”
Luna explained, “we’re scared for you. This is different. Out there you’ll be alone. You won’t have anyone to help you. No one to watch your back.” She hesitated before finishing, “we’re scared for you, that’s all. We want you to be safe. The tournament isn’t safe.” She had an uncomfortable look on her face.

Hagrid shook his head. After another drink he said, “I know too many things happened at the end of last year. Things that didn’t need to happen. I think I did hear about someone taking a student off grounds and Professor Barnes going after them. I didn’t know that it was you Arlene. I’m sorry.” He took another drink from his mug.

Regulus Black was waiting for him in his sitting room. They were in Grimmauld place, the former home of the family Black. Regulus asked, “what’s the news?”
This was the normal testing. The homework had been to combine a flower with an inorganic material to make it nearly indestructible without detracting from the qualities of a flower. Everyone had passed but at least one of the tests had effected it in some way. Until Arlene’s that was.
