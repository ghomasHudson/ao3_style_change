He was cold, his fingers like ice rubbing themselves to get feeling back but all he felt were the prickling static beneath his skin. Sensation of touch gone.
“You won’t.” Malfoy said plainly, and cut off any argument after, “I’m not going to St. Mugos.”
And what if he did end of getting involved? Huh? What then?’
“Exscribo Sensus.”
Harry was silent for a while after that, still refusing to look anywhere but the line of distant homes. They came, eventually, to the tree line and Ron checked the rear view for anyone else on the road. It was growing dark, and the shadows of the trees cut slices of overcast sun like the slats of window blinds. He activated the invisibility as they moved from one dark sliver to the next.
He’d caught only the barest of impressions as Malfoy in the memory focused on what had sent him spiraling, another visit to his childhood home, to see how Potter had actually escaped when captured.
But out here, alone, with endless open ocean around him, even the smell of fish and salt seemed foreign and dangerous.
“Leave it to you, ferret. Of course you’d never accept a time limit.”
Ron had asked Ginny, just the morning before he had gone and stolen the time turner out of Hermione’s desk. It was their anniversary, and Ron had begged several people to call her away so he could infiltrate her office and surprise her. It had been a moment of bright cheer in Grimmauld Place that morning as Harry and Ginny had set aside the strained grief that smothered them and helped him plan. He had felt a touch guilty for deceiving them, but the only way to access the time turner would be for Hermione to hastily store it in her office after she had removed it to study, and it wasn’t like he hadn’t planned to fill her office with so many flowers it was hard to walk in anyway. It would only be a moment out of time, and though Ron wasn’t certain it was a good cause he was certain it was a necessary one. Still, he had taken a moment in the kitchen with Ginny as Harry had run back upstairs to fetch Hermione’s gift, Ron was currently wearing his, a fancy timepiece he didn’t want to know the price of. He had asked her about Harry, and Malfoy, and how it was all holding together.
He stopped himself from adding more, the last book was already full of his questions just like these. He didn’t even had Malfoy’s supposed identity, he couldn’t imagine him still going by Draco.
“Go back.”
“Because it’s a curse?”
He had to get up.
He had thought they were headed for a portkey location, or a safe house hidden behind some muggle tourist shop, he hadn’t paid much attention to where they were headed or what the plan was for after they got there, not after his mother had let go of his hand to dig into her bag for something, speaking quietly, hurriedly, head bent sideways towards his father.
“Weas-”
Neither one of them took the time to just… feel. Wallow, Hermione had called it once, wallowing in the feelings instead of fixing the issue and moving on, but being parents, being the caregivers of small bodies with too many emotions to fit inside them and not enough mental capacity or experience to explain them away, it had forced them to reevaluate how they handled things. Family Counseling had helped too.
“I didn’t mean to look,” he said, and a bead of a tear touched his lower lashes, a sensation that felt like a single too tight strand of hair in a ponytail painfully tugging at him. He could still hear her screams.
So somewhere in the mess of theoretical magic Malfoy had used to capture the memory containing the entire magically copied journal, putting it in a pensieve, and turning THAT pensieve into the pretty coloring gel capsules, some of his short term memories had come with.
“Last-?” Draco’s eyes crawled down to his chest where the time turner swung on its chain, “How did you?!” He surged up, grabbing at the device and pulling it hard, and Ron along with in.
The case had a weight to it that he had only felt when handling the cursed items in his home, something that did not feel physical, not a heaviness that pulled at his arms, but a weight that settled in the very core of him.
He’d gone back in time, used Malfoy’s secret time turner and gone back to save him, because what else was he supposed to do after reading that damn… what had Malfoy thought he’d accomplish anyway? Messing with time travel? His stupid plans to change everything, to fix everything, wasn’t it enough that they had won the war? Malfoy hadn’t even really lost anyone important. His parents were still alive, none of them had gone to Azkaban, he’d even seemed to have been getting somewhere with this mental auto repair shop he’d set up.
Ron had never found out what Harry would do when Ginny next had to travel for her game, she’d been allowed home a short week for the funeral but even world shattering revelations did not stop Quidditch. Harry was Ron’s partner, and had returned to work as soon as they hit London, but his obsession with the case had been obvious from the start and Ron had almost gotten into a row with him several times over the slow progress. Harry just couldn’t accept the declaration that Draco Malfoy had died from time travel related splinching, an injury previously unheard of. The only thing the Ministry was interested in about the investigation was if anyone besides Nott and Malfoy were involved, if any research could be uncovered, and in the interest of preserving Harry’s own hard fought image of the Malfoy family as war spies, if Draco was using time travel to assist the dark Lord.
His wand continued to roll between his fingers but he was struggling to actually sit up and cast the spell. He should, he had to, obviously the answer would be in the journal, and obviously the journal wasn’t for first year so he should probably get a different book if he didn’t want to ruin the one on his stomach, but the actual action of stoping his fingers, getting up, getting a book, and casting the spell seemed beyond him.
Malfoy family fled to port (where they were apprehended) Draco Malfoy disguised with black hair. Small case full of wands, 11 in total, cursed? Malfoy uses wand to confuse muggles on ship and flee Britain.
Still Draco remained hidden.
He blinked.
“If you could…” he swallowed. “If you could go back. To before, the war, or Hogwarts, or even just before he.. died.” He parked in front of the townhome and faced Harry fully, who for the first time in the whole drive faced him back. “Would you? Go back and change things, if you could?”
Her screams, as real and present as it had been ten years ago, and him just as helpless to save her. He hadn’t meant to look, hadn’t wanted to look.
“No,” The denial came like a gust from Draco and he grabbed Ron’s shoulder, bloodshot eyes wild, “No.”
It was one hell of a mess, Ron had thought himself prepared, he’d seen the evidence when he had first walked the crime scene with his father to collect the illegally modified muggle equipment, but there was a very big difference between dry black bloodstains and an actively growing pool beneath a still living body.
He’d laid the whole thing out in his head, and wondered if he should be a detective novelist on the side. He knew his story back and forth, knew his lines and Draco’s, but he didn’t bother to plan what he wasn’t supposed to know, and he wasn’t supposed to know it was Nott. Hermione knew, she was still on Nott’s case, and Harry probably knew because he never stopped badgering her and Kingsley and had suddenly stopped complaining about being forced to extend his leave, the excuse used to pull them off when the tie had been established.
Ron Weasley’s Guide to Time Travel Page 0 points 1-3
Ron stared down at him, at the vacant blue eyes and the slack face, and swore. Fuck you Malfoy.” He said bitterly, because that was really all he could say. He’d thought, he had really thought, but it hadn’t made a difference after all.
“What are you talking about?”
He shook the thought off and decided he probably needed to get some sleep. He was, after all, freshly eleven. Even if his mind was a trained and hardened Auror his body was still developing, plus he had chores in the morning.
“You always stay here, day and night, that’s not good for you cher.” She settled into his chair, bare feet with their flaking painted nails going up onto the battered and chipped marble desk. There were no preservation charms on his desk, no polish either, the pale marble had long since been stained by any number of colored inks and drinks that spilled onto its porous surface. One of the students had traced a faded pink stain with black marker to make an unattractive cartoon creature. “Piti-cilayé yé bon wé, and they adore you, it won’t kill you to be seen outside.” She watched him power off the short row of computers, old and clunky in their anti-magic casings, and another reason he restricted spells here.
Andromeda returned to her side, steering her away with a supportive arm, and leaving Ron with Harry.
“Malfoy?” Speaking out loud, the jarring sound of a voice in the quiet, made him very aware that he had not been
He didn’t look like himself. Maybe it was the stress, the lost weight, the way his bones were so sharp against his pale face, maybe it was the ink he had dumped all over his hair in blind panic as he had spotted his reflection in that dingy muggle loo his parents had ushered him into to change out of his school clothes. His mother had been so alarmed when he had come out, hair stiff and black, face smudged where he had tried to rub at his eyebrows. He had tried to explain, that they were too noticeable, that they hadn’t a wand between the three of them for glamours or charms, his father could pass for a graying man but his hair was too noticeable and he was going to get them caught before they’d even reached whatever location they’d set up to escape.
“You sound like tire brakes,” Malfoy scowled at him, “bad ones. Kindly stop doing so in my ear.” Then he sighed and stared back up at the ceiling. “I told you, I was careless, I kept meticulous track of every jump I made, and only jumped to times where I knew my own location. Except, apparently, one, because I had already changed it.” He lifted his hand, flexed his fingers in front of his face, staring at his own blood, or perhaps the lines in his palm. “I locked Myrtle’s bathroom that night, so that Potter wouldn’t catch me in a… delicate moment, and altered my own locations for the following days, as I was no longer hospitalized. Running into myself… Time Travel is not a well developed field, because any changes we make would alter the future, making the need to make such changes unnecessary. Even now your memories of your future-past will be trickling away, until all you have is a vague recollection of some strange feeling, an urgency, to act in the manner you did. The consequences of missteps are… not often recorded.”
‘Hello Weasel, been a long time.’
Draco’s memories will still come over from the penny pills but from her on out they will be filtered through the area of Ron’s mind that Draco will inhabit, like a book to be opened and closed. He is not an alter created by Rons mind, but an imprint of himself left over from his own memories, he has no control over Rons actions or movements no acts more like a backseat driver in Rons ear.
He hadn’t seen the end of the memory, had he forced himself out of it? Obviously Draco put in in the book if it was the last thought he had, but Ron hadn’t seen the journal anywhere near them.
year when his past self was in hiding at Blaise’s home and did something that Ron saw no point to but he was sure tied to an event happening while they had all been unaware. He’d glamored himself like Lucius and ordered the elves to send the peacocks to some other location, before he could leave though he’d run into his mother, standing rigid and alone overlooking her wilted garden beds. It was such a bleak image, and Draco had stopped short to stare at her.
He had to rip the plain white shirt, saying “Why couldn’t you have worn one of those stupid button-up ones you always liked,” as he set to trying to stay the blood flow. It wasn’t natural, a white shirt and trousers, scuffed steel-toe boots, a muggle billfold had been among his personal effects for merlin’s sake. He’d almost pulled a Harry and assumed Malfoy had faked the whole thing.
“Bonswa. Don’t suppose I can pull you away from your little project tonight?” A voice, low and melodic, spoke from the doorway and Draco greeted her with a smile. Bernadette’s wild hair was somehow more of a disaster, reminding Draco uncomfortably of Granger in small painful moments, like stepping on a thumbtack or stubbing a toe in the dark. “We’re celebrating our victory in Shaonàxën, and Jorge wants to recount his winning shot for the millionth time to someone who hasn’t heard it the entire 3 hour bus ride.”
And then he died.
With the distant thrum of drum and voice from the world outside Draco carefully shelved books, checked preservation charms, and accounted for each and every item on display as he had done every night since he had taken the position, sliding the curtains protecting delicate painted hides from light damage back into place. He did this al by hand, too many of the displayed items were old and delicate, with only the barest traces of magic left upon them. Too long spent away from those who knew them, too vulnerable to the erosion of the ambient magic any spells might leave.
Point 1: Don’t be a jealous ass to Harry
Yet while the ministry had been appeased, Harry Potter had not. Harry Potter had near exploded in a fit of questions and demands and accusations. Ron had thought he was prepared for it, thought he knew how obsessively Harry had searched for Draco, but the raw betrayal in his friend’s face when he learned that Ron had found Draco Malfoy and kept it secret. It had cut him, probably as painfully as Draco’s own wounds.
“Ron?”
He just needed the book for first year, and the accompanying reference books, and if book 4 covered 8-10 then that left him 7 additional books he may or may not need. Plus the little mentions he kept seeing crop up, as he skimmed through the first few ‘notable dates’ in Hogwarts. “If jumped previously see page-” “if previously jumps have altered see page-” “Skip if previous jump made not applicable”.
“Not in my experience.”
“Useless,” Draco hissed, “A prototype, Nott was to destroy it,” he said with an anger unfitting someone who had double crossed his partner himself. “Do you remember the note copying spell your brother’s made?” Ron nodded, “Take the 7 pills, not at once, in the blue jar, they are my other journals. You’ll need them. When you remove your time turner your memories will begin to unravel, you’ll need them.”
“The, but this is-” Ron reached for the one beside them and Draco knocked it away.
Hermione, Ron smiled and felt warm just thinking of her. He should probably feel guilty, leaving her and their two children in the distant future, she’d been the main thing keeping him from traveling back that very day Malfoy had died at his feet. How his decisions would change them, their lives, their love. Ron picked up the behemoth of a book and hugged it to his chest, tucking it under his chin and smiling. Yes, this was what he was going to use.
It made his eyes cross. These were nothing in comparison the the journal he had read, which had been more like a private diary detailing his many incremental changes and how the present time reacted to them, or noting down who did what and where and at what time. He realized, as he skimmed through yet another list of points including ‘positions and timeframes’ that those jumps were primarily so that Malfoy could observe these incidents from all angles.
They haunted him, dogged his sleep and tugged at his mind as he visited Azkaban, the sounds scrapping like long nailed fingers over every nerve in his body even through his patronus. His worst memories, his deepest fears.
Side Effects of swallowing a pensieve include, shockingly, someone else’s trauma.
The Malfoy in his head sniffed haughtily, a nasally little breath through his stupid pointed nose. ‘That’s point 2, kill it with fire’
‘You have to cast the spell before you go to sleep.’
It should have been funny, Draco fainting, Ron had made the story to be funny, and if Draco was alive it probably would be. Now it just seemed sad.
Ron sat crossed legged on his bed, fourth book in his hand now, and let what he’d just seen settle into his thoughts as he watched Draco’s careful fluid handwriting overtake a battered 2
Well, no offense to he wife, but she had never been splinched, and this particular car had saved his life on two, TWO occasions. It felt so solid around him, he grinned as he gripped the steering wheel, so safe.
“I just need all the books.” He reassured himself. “I don’t have to follow Malfoy’s plans, I know what happened best of us anyway.” He hadn’t expected the memories to come with them, so it shouldn’t matter that they were unpredictable.
“Yeees?” Ron drew out, uncertain. “You told me to?” That got a reaction, a panicked one.
Draco closed the case of an ancient roll of wampum and climbed his ladder to store it in the shelves high above the windows. They both knew he wouldn’t go, he never did, but she asked anyway because she knew he never liked to answer. “He’ll tell me tomorrow,” was all he could say, as the box slid into place, “and everyone else in the Library while he’s at it.”
Just when you think a guy had changed, grown some decency, and penned an endearing book about going back and saving others, he turns around and breaks down the pros and cons of not calling Hermione Granger by a fucking slur their first day back to school. Book 8 page 53 points 1-32.
“Why is it not healing?” He growled and keeping his weight on one forearm, both to keep Malfoy still as to keep pressure on the wounds, grabbed another bottle of dittany from the bag he’d brought with him, uncorking it with his mouth and applying it across the huge open gashes.
“If you’re sure.”
“That’s enough.”
He just needed Book 1, to get an idea of Malfoy’s plans, he’d get the rest sorted eventually. After all, he didn’t plan on using hand-me-downs for long.
Wiping his hands on his trousers he carefully opened the door and slid inside, he could do this, he could go back again and save Malfoy, and then he could go forward, and live the rest of his life with Draco Malfoy in his debt, because if the Ministry had been upset enough to confiscate the modified muggle objects they’d found the first time they would implode over this. A time turner car. Blimey they’d throw him in Azkaban for certain.
Point 3: Profit
it had read,
The strain on her face came back in an instant and she had shoved a hand through her hair and looked like she wanted to cry. “He used to go on trips, chasing down leads.” She confessed after a moment. “He’s hired so many private investigators over the years I swear he could start his own firm. I used to try to understand, he’s the type who needs to do what’s right or he can’t justify existing, but its been ten years Ron. This obsession, I thought it would go away, that it was like in school and eventually he’d move on. Narcissa has, she’s accepted it, even though she never says, she accepted that he might be dead a long time ago. Harry bringing it up, it hurts her, and I try… tried to make him understand that she needed to be allowed to move on but he just never gave up. Ever time, EVERY TIME Ron,” she raised her voice with such bitterness, “he would get some tip from his little network and spend days searching it gave them hope, and every time it led to nothing it was like she was realizing he was dead all over again.”
I wanted to use this chapter to illustrate that Ron and co are not in any way desperate for time travel, and neither should Draco have been. That the choices Ron makes going forward are not egged on by some great tragedy or loss any more than any other tragedy and loss they’ve encountered. Everyone has been grieving Draco for years.
“He did, once.” The lies didn’t even matter anymore. “Not directly. We were just… talking. I was talking. About Hermione and the kids, and it just died out, like it does when you’re the only one talking.” Like it had just then, in the car, and like Harry had just done Ron pictured Malfoy standing over the car, bonnet removed and all the guts on display as Ron waited to be told to rev the engine, and quietly, casually asking. “He asked “How’s Potter then? Drowned in a pool of his own ego yet? Must be hard to stay afloat, given his waves of adoring fans.”
The cover of the next book, 4
But the memory of it all forced them both to watch.
“Back?” Malfoy rasped, grunting as Ron used the torn shirt to mop off the blood and expose yet another freshly opened slice. “You go back in five minutes.”
A call for help. Draco had no wand in his possession but that meant little when an assailant could disarm and keep it. Harry also disapparated through Ministry wards so often that he and Ron by virtue of being his partner were cleared for it, and there was a record of Ron disapparating within the timeframe of his call for medical aid and auror backup. His first aid kit was also the one from his office, with an array of supplies obviously dumped with no knowledge of what he might need. It looked just as Ron said it was, a message from Draco that he was hurt, a rush to grab supplies and apparate, a call for backup when he realized he was in over his head.
That got him another suspicious squint. “How many times?” He demanded, and Ron must have given him an obviously confused look because he clarified, “How many times have you jumped?”
“I don’t like boats.” Draco said and his serviceable smile seemed to bite deeper in the corners as he pressed his lips harder together to keep from adding ‘I lost my parents on a boat.’
Yeah, that had always been there,
He couldn’t resist-
Draco needed answers.
Draco gritted his teeth. Something about seeing Potter lying vulnerable and alone made him snappish and brittle. It unsettled him, and he didn’t like it.
. Draco.” Or, “Draco Malfoy, if you think for one minute I’m going to lend you my Charms notes you have a second think coming. At least get out your quill and try to look like you’re listening. No, I don’t care if Crabbe’s not paying attention. If he fails, that isn’t my problem.”
Pansy grinned suddenly, a pixie- like smile that exposed her small, pearly teeth and lit up her fine- boned face. “Yeah.” She blushed, then, and dimly Draco wanted to roll his eyes but he just couldn’t because it was so fucking pure.
Theo looked down, and then up, gaze roving over their beds as if searching for an answer amongst the rumpled bedsheets.
They turned together to see the Headmistress standing with her arms folded, looking both faintly amused and terribly severe.
Saviour.
to use Alohomora. Everything should work by itself, without me needing to break out OWL- level spells, and it doesn’t, and I will not fucking just sit down and accept sub- standardness in my house.”
But he hadn’t said anything. And she’d gone, whisked away in a little whirlwind of grief and fear and, he now recognised, selfishness.
There was a pause.
“Have at it, baby."
He began to walk down the corridor, not looking behind him to see Malfoy was following. The brush of cool air against his back told him that, in any case, the door had been closed. He couldn’t hear anything… but then his own footsteps were silent too. He’d never met anybody as quiet as him on foot, especially as the wood in this place had to be decades old.
Pansy looked like a rabbit caught in headlights.
Something in Draco’s chest tightened and leaped- the ball of excitement was now thrashing like a caged bird, throwing itself against his ribs until he was dizzy and grinning under the warm water of the shower. The smile didn’t fade from his face, not even when his muscles began to ache, not when the cool air from the changing rooms struck him, not when he reached up to dry his face with a towel. The reaction was so visceral it was as though he'd been spelled to react so strongly- but Draco couldn’t say he’d ever been more pleased about having a curse put on him.
Pansy brushed her dark hair out of her eyes, apparently fascinated by her cereal. She stuffed another spoonful of cornflakes in her mouth and chased it down with a deep gulp of milk from the large flagon-- originally intended for Butterbeer—by her bowl. Pansy liked to have her cereal and milk separately-- she said she hated it when the cornflakes got prematurely mushy. Now, she busied herself by trying to clear the mound of cereal from her bowl as fast as humanly possible, cheeks furiously working like a gerbil on Pepper- Up Potion. The deep swills of milk she was gulping down left a smattering of faint, pale droplets on her upper lip.
Draco wiped the sweat from his forehead, pulling his robes over his head and using them to mop his brow. Still breathing harshly from practice, he bent, removed his shoes and socks, and walked over to the showers with his wand in hand, shutting himself in a cubicle. Just as he closed the door, he remembered what he had done the last time he’d been in the Quidditch showers. A slow grin spread over his face; still holding his wand, he switched stalls and locked the door, turning the shower on. Draco ducked under the warm water, soaking his hair so it clung to his face and trailed in his eyes. He swept it back with an impatient hand, and turned to the wall where he had inscribed the lines of the song. At first glance, he was sure something was wrong. Three lines, scrawled down on the shining white tiles, stared back at him. Draco frowned, reading them through, a feeling akin to being set on fire spreading through his body before he even realized what was different.
Ginny cocked her head. “Can’t go wrong with a nice black blazer. Here.
That had been the worst of it, the first day. A couple more weeks of figuring it out, testing the waters, and the routine was set. Harry was fine in Auror training, interacting with the same group of trainees, and sticking close to Ron. He could go out now he knew what to expect, but he liked people with him. On days after he had nightmares, he couldn’t be in close quarters with strangers. It was better if they travelled alone, and better still if they all just stayed at home those mornings.
—” he pointed an accusatory finger at Harry, who widened his eyes innocently “—I don’t need to know that you’ve seen my sister on the toilet.”
It felt weird, calling it that, but it had not felt like any pensieve he’d ever been in, and as an Investigative Auror he’d been inside enough. No, he’d not been walking inside as an observer, he’d BEEN Draco Malfoy, felt his contentment organizing and locking up for the night, the irritation of being disrupted even by someone he was fond of, the prickle of pain that was recognizing the pieces of others inside someone you cared for. Memory within memory. Ron did not know who Clavel was, but within that memory he knew he was someone important, a co-conspirator and close friend, who carried a grief and rage Draco could never hope to soothe.
“You never want to catch up with yourself.” Draco told him seriously, and reached for the dittany in his hand, “Especially not with the car.” Ron watched, disturbed, as Malfoy drank what was left in the vial. “Did you have any more?”
Ron scribbled a little note in the binding of the book he’d just used for Book 4, a little mockery of Malfoy’s deranged notation system.
“Dittany,” Ron said, uncorking the next vial and reapplying it as the first slice reopened, “I carry it since I got splinched, it worked last time, so I grabbed more.”
Oh how Ron wanted to grab them all for his own right here right now, as he had when he had been in school, though then he had wanted to use them to cheat, and later to set on fire.
year history of magic, barely held on by a few stubborn threads of the binding. He knew his mother had repaired them as much as she could, but there was only so much she could do year after year until they finally reached him. He knew his sister, at least, would get a few in better condition which had infuriated him as a child but was reassuring him now as he wiggled the cover and watched one of those threads give up the ghost and leave the top corner fully free.
“Its not-nngh-,” Malfoy clenched his teeth against a wave of agony. “It’s a curse.”
Was it a side effect of the spell? He didn’t remember his brothers ever mentioning the note copying spell could hold memories, but it made sense in a way. The spell copied entire books, though much to his wife’s frustration it did not share the knowledge, but somewhere in the mind the copied text was stored. He’d never imagined trying to tract it down and capture it in a pensieve, just imagining how much WORK that would take made his head hurt, and he’d never even heard of anyone SWALLOWING someone else’s pensieve the way Ron had just done.
As soon as Harry’s face disappeared in the embers Ron was throwing open their cabinet and stuffing their first aid supplies into his bag, how long had it been? What time was Draco’s experiment? Ron had only been able to roughly estimate its failure based on the estimated time of death, was he dying now? While Ron had stood here chatting with Harry, had he died?

the benefactor, seeing as the Zabini vaults’ll be the ones shelling out for this lavish meal,” Blaise said acerbically, sitting back with a sated expression.
Code for magical folk.
Stepping back to admire his work, Draco smiled to himself. Small joys like defacing school property- it was nice to feel like a schoolboy again. If Draco concentrated hard enough, he could feel Pansy’s sharp elbow against his ribs, jabbing him-
But he was stressed, and there was no getting around that fact. His palms were slick with sweat, nails making crescent moons on their skin. His hair was stuck irritatingly to the back of his neck, and he was itching to move it, but he just
he added bitterly. Because, yeah, Draco knew better than anyone how hard it was to start afresh. Hell- even now, he still wasn’t completely clean, was he? He still had jerks like Zabini accusing him of being deep in the dirty workings of the Ministry. He still had a fucking
Harry exchanged a dubious look with Ron.
Potter nodded vigorously, the cutest blush staining his cheekbones, and Draco wanted to giggle, but then realised what McGonagall was alluding to.
There was a muffled shout from upstairs, and both Ginny and Harry craned their necks to see Harry’s blazer zooming down the stairs towards them. As they looked, Ron staggered out from the landing, face beetroot red. Hermione’s cackles echoed all the way from the far corner of Harry’s bedroom.
“I’m fucking COMING!” Draco shouted. He panicked, slicking the strand back in a fit of indecision.
His pale eyes were fixed on Potter, and Draco hated the expression in them. He looked like he was just about restraining himself from holding Harry away from Draco, stroking his hair back and hiding him from the room. It was possessive, was what it was. Fuck, Draco despised it. He wanted to slap the look off the Irish boy’s face, wanted to jinx him until he got it into his thick skull that Potter didn’t belong to him, he couldn’t. Ever. Because obviously he belonged to—
The Headmistress’s expression was slightly softened as she spoke to Draco. He felt the change in her tone like a shock down his spine; unexpected and not altogether dislikeable.
Draco grinned. “You’re on.”
He would’ve told Pansy. Pansy would have understood. But Pansy… was sleeping somewhere in a Swiss dormitory with eleven other girls, in Swiss bedsheets that weren’t Slytherin green and Swiss hangings that probably didn’t depict snakes coiled in various different artistic positions.
The fire crackled behind them as though laughing, and McGonagall waited patiently, grey-black eyebrows raised with an austere sort of archness.
Harry cut him off by dropping to his knees.
“Hey, man, want to play a drinking game?”
Draco’s gaze landed on the shower area, and his fists tightened against his robes, the lyrics of that fated song twisting back to the fore of his mind in a feline, inescapably elegant sort of way. God, he loved that song. It had kept him alive, alive in a sort of visceral, speaks- to- my- soul sort of sense.
Pansy quirked an eyebrow. “What d’you mean? D’you guys seriously not know what Ginny Weasley does for a job?”
The staircase opened up onto a slightly smaller space decorated the same way as upstairs, but this time with a clear feeling of magic about the place. Goblins, vampires, and one pale man with red- rimmed eyes who looked rather like a werewolf sat at darkly-lacquered tables, eating with an assortment of chopsticks and custom cutlery to accommodate the variety of claws and fur adorning their bodies. However, there were also dozens of tables with wizards sat around them, drinking from goblets, joking and laughing with their friends. Wands flashed and twirled in fingers, casually handled as though there weren’t Muggles just upstairs. It made Draco nervous.
Potter whimpered, hand reaching helplessly for Draco’s, and Draco soothed him with a graze of the fingers, already drawing his wand from his pocket to slash a cheque into the air. He sent it flying over to the waiter with a flick; that was Potter’s bill dealt with, and Blaise would handle their own. His hand was sure and possessive on Harry’s back, wide over the muscles he’d admired from his own seat, and their tension made something primal and boiling start to churn inside him. He pressed Harry even closer to him and began to walk swiftly towards the exist. Potter was completely gone, only sweet murmurs and whimpers falling from his lips, and one glance at him was nearly too much for Draco. He had to content himself with sliding his arm fully around Potter’s waist as soon as he could; God, it was tiny, deceptively slim, and he could feel- Salazar help him- the tiniest, most luxurious softness at his hips and stomach, lean back muscles giving way to… love handles?
“Did you engage in a duel with anyone today, Mr Malfoy?” Flitwick looked uncharacteristically stern, small hands steepled to his furrowed brow.
So green. Draco had always thought they were the brightest, most alive eyes he’d ever seen. He could read them like a book, he thought, and it wasn’t a boast. It was just fact. He’d see so many of Potter’s emotions just play out in his eyes, shifting and mercurial and bloody mesmerising. A green the equal of which he’d probably never seen in his life. And, God, had he tried.
Draco cleared his throat, and Potter threw a half- glance at him. It was enough to make his stomach tighten, hopelessly, foolishly. Draco narrowly avoided hiding his face in his hands, stifling the Lucius Voice before it could comment.
“That’s so exciting, Ginny!” Hermione squealed. “Who is it?”
Hope everyone likes this one- it's not too action- filled, but it's a build up I guess. I don't know. There's so much emotion I can't really tell what it is to be honest. Draco likes his secrets and I'm not the invasive type.
Like, what in Salazar’s evil fucking name is a Segway? Why would anyone voluntarily put themselves on a contraption that has wheels and speeds along at a breakneck pace but
“You wish, Parkinson,” Draco muttered into the rim of his glass.
“Okay, then,” he said, and his voice was finally laced with something like confidence. Suddenly, didn’t feel like he had to prove anything, and he smirked at Malfoy, waiting for the reaction as he brought his hands up behind his head and tipped his gaze back languidly, mirroring what the other man had done earlier.
Weasley, at least, seemed to be having as miserable a time as Draco. He was sitting at the far back of the class--
Instead, there was an extremely loud silence.
he thought slowly.
“No,” she replied calmly, eyes sharp and alive with something Draco couldn’t place. It wasn’t—mischief?
Draco thought, trying to quash the butterflies swarming madly over the lining of his stomach.
“Want to come in?”
A dark frown from Malfoy, which was entirely predictable and…
He didn’t know if he’d ever be able to listen to that song again if this went wrong.
, was the shrill refrain of his subconscious, shrieking a little hysterically over a bass rumble Draco could identify as,
"I know."
And then she’d soften, and say, “Look, I didn’t play Sphinxes and Riddles with him when we were six, did I? I don’t want you to fail, Draco. Come on, I’ll let you look at my notes for the first part of the lesson. Just try and follow what he’s saying now.”
She jerked her head in assent, pen flying across the page. “And for you, sir?”
tight.”
He broke off, looking away hotly as though trying to curb his temper.
There hadn’t been anything on the wall.
“Weasley? Have you anything to say to your partner?” Slughorn probed.
(Pansy’s Plan, mainly, but he’d annexed it because as far as he could tell it was the best shot he had.)
“Yeah,” he said, and his voice was a little gravelly. “It’s just…”
“And, for the record, I don’t credit you for that shit in the War. You just kept your own nose clean. You let people call you Saviour, and did nothing. Fucking loser.”
********************************************************************************************************************************************************
Draco’s eyes narrowed. Was that- he blinked. It seemed to defy even Longbottom’s usual level of magical bumbling. But yes- instead of two largeish, slightly pigeon- toed feet sticking out from beneath Longbottom’s robes, there sat, like a great mushroom, what could only be described as a voluminous flipper. Longbottom attempted to stand independently, but his flipper curled unsteadily on the floor, one webbed edge teetering as though weighing up its decision, and then he crashed back into Potter, cheeks pressing together in breathless, thoughtless schoolboy familiarity. Potter’s green eyes were bright behind his glasses, hair untidily rumpled and unapologetically black, so very black that it made his already fair skin seem like snow. He was all clear lines and colours and tangled eyelashes pressing into the lenses of his glasses, one long- fingered hand splayed over the small of Longbottom’s fucking undeserving back, and-
“I made that expression at them.”
“Da- da dum, dum, dum, dum, da- da dum.”
Ron gave him a pitying look from three floors up. “We may be two floors down, but the walls are pretty thin, mate. Either you use it or you get off on some serious pain.”
Potter sat up quickly, reaching for his glasses on his bedside table and putting them on hastily. As his vision must have sharpened, Draco saw his brain click into gear and start obfuscating, although rather sleepily.
When Malfoy’s shirt popped open, Harry slid it off his shoulders, feeling the planes of skin beneath brush his knuckles as he cast the material on the floor. His burst of confidence receded somewhat, presented with the overwhelming sight of Malfoy before him, shirtless and panting, hair mussed beautifully. Malfoy seemed to sense Harry’s uncertainty; he grinned down at him slowly, and the pure desire of it was softened with just enough sweetness that Harry went completely slack, syrupy want loosening him until he was utterly pliant. Malfoy caught his face up in his hands and kissed him hard, full of teeth and the filthy slide of tongue, and the sharper spike of
He gave a hum of agreement, squeezing his eyes even tighter shut. Trying to block out the reality that was hounding him now, cornering him into all these fucking realisations that just maybe he didn’t want to have.
Breasts.
“It’s not about that! Of course it occurred to me to use fucking Alohomora, but it goes against my principles! I shouldn’t
The writing in the Quidditch showers continues to haunt Draco, and Charms class yields about three mysteries, none of which are academic.
“Wonderful. After all, it’s an essential for the exam- almost certainly, it’ll come up.”
Ron gaped at her. “Wha—
“Pansy,” Draco interrupted. “Are you talking about an
“Lucky for you,” the ginger growled, shoving his textbook in next to his potions kit. “I was holding back.”
“Okay.”
They stood together before the great gargoyle as Potter cleared his throat, sliding a small piece of parchment from his pocket and peering at the words inscribed upon it in a curling hand.
A spike of anger, something hopeless, pierced him for a second. He clenched his jaw irrationally, for no reason that was explainable, except, just—
Harry glanced down at himself musingly. “Uh, maroon?”
“Alriiiight,” Harry groaned, propping his head on his hand. “But you cannot laugh. Merlin, I can’t believe I’m telling you this. Fucking Firewhisky making me just say everything.”
“Bit the dust, yeah,” Zabini said, and rolled his eyes. “God, I’m tearing up, Malfoy. You and your fucking sob story.”
“I turned around to the Slytherin table, and there was this cluster of girls in your year, sniggering together and kind of looking at me? Immediately, I knew they were, like, making fun because I was alone. I don’t reckon you ever had this, Hermione, because you were always with these two—”
“Well,” Harry said dryly, “I reckon Malfoy was a little strung out from trying to, you know, kill Dumbledore, so his emotions were running kind of high. He hit me with the full force of his magical core, concentrated into this one bloody Confundus Charm. So aside from acting like an idiot, I went right up to him—mind you, my brain was completely unaffected. I knew exactly what I was doing on the inside, I was still me internally, but my body was just doing its own thing.—So I was screaming at myself mentally, you know, but I couldn’t stop myself from just walking right up to him, brushing his hair out of his face, and saying ‘you’re pretty. Your hair is all messy. I want to touch it.’ I hadn’t even realised I thought he was fucking hot, but when he took the Confundus Charm off, it hit me like a train. Credit to Malfoy- and I never thought I’d say that- when the Charm was lifted he just looked at me for a minute, and then literally did not mention it once. Just carried on. But I couldn’t look him in the eye for the rest of the day, and when I got to be alone after the lesson, I was so fucking overwhelmed with how he smelled and how he looked. I sometimes wonder if, without that Confundus Charm, I ever would’ve figured it out. But yeah, I was completely gay after that lesson, and much as I kidded myself I loved you, Gin, I figured it out for certain when we went away in seventh year.”
He knew those screams.
Besides, he had work to do.
The doors had been replaced, and all the shattered windows too, the bonnet was removed, but there was a new one in the corner, unpainted, ready to be put in place.
The car revved its engine.
Later the assessment of Draco’s body would confirm the time looping nature of the cutting curse, and rule that the disparity of time between Ron apparating and calling for help did align with Ron’s insistence that the treatment worked at first and the injury seemed non fatal on first arrival. He had, therefore, not been made to give a pensieve of the encounter.
“Then how did you… how do you remember?” Ron indicated the room, and then to the desk, where the journal lay. “Is that why you keep the diary?”
Ron also knew, from the second and third journal he’d made, that Malfoy had the habit of going back and double checking his work. The second journal had given Ron even less of a glimpse into Malfoy’s mind then the third, not even adding anything. Malfoy had only flipped open the book, tapped his finger against Harry’s trial date, then flipped it all closed and cast his spell. Nothing but vague frustration that he even had to look it up, then Ron was back to his room.
’ the journal had read.
His room was smaller, he’d shoved too many boxes of supplies into the space, but he’d use it all up eventually, once he got around to unpacking it all into the new potions cabinet Demaurius had made for him in class.
If attempt to acquire Winky fails review page 18 points 3 & 9.
“I’m a Slytherin, I’ll use what leverage I have.” Draco closed his eyes, and neither he nor Ron really bothered with the blood that grew on the floor around him. “Do you remember the summer before first year?” he asked, and his voice was soft now, almost dreamy. “It really felt like anything was possible then, if only I hadn’t made such a mess of it.”
“Go on then Weasel,” Draco dismissed him. “Go save the world. Since I obviously can’t anymore.”
And he highly doubted Draco Malfoy had a contingency plan drawn up for THAT childhood trauma. Though, if he was stalking them all through their Hogwarts years to plot out their positions and timeframes he probably knew more than enough.
Now here they were, sitting in the old unpainted Ford Anglia that Ron had only just finished the repairs on. He’d somehow managed to clean the auto shop of evidence before the Aurors had arrived, had gathered Draco and Theo’s pensieve pills, copied and erased the journal, and in what he thought of as a moment of temporary madness had doctored Draco’s books to include Ron as the owner of the car.
The air wasn’t helping, his room felt like a prison and the deck felt too vulnerable, too exposed. He had never been on any wizarding ship, his family had never seen the need. If they wanted to travel they did so by portkey, spending days or weeks packed into the confines of a ship with other families, even rich families, was not something a Malfoy would do.
First encounter with Harry Potter in stands no important actions need change possible conversation points page 5 points 1-12 ref book 8, insults and responses page 7-12.
What a mind fuck.
Not that Ashuwixën’s library had ever been quiet, unlike Hogwarts’ library which had been ruled over by the terrifying and tyrannical Pince it had always reminded Draco more of a common room then a place of study, and had been used by the students to meet and gather and share their stories in ways he’d never known a library could be used for.
Instead Ron gripped the wheel of his car, still unpainted and still dented but returned to him by the ministry, his father had helped him reattach the bonnet and the windshield wipers just that morning, and he tried not to think about the time turner Draco had said was in the gear shift.
Only this time, this time he wasn’t going to fuck it up with his stupid hurt feelings and shit like some snotty spoiled Slytherin.
Was this how Potter gathered his little cult? Draco wondered as he looked into the dark eyes, so black he couldn’t tell the iris from the pupil, of a student who seemed so invested in a simple, unimportant librarian.
Oh he knew what came next, had seen the evidence of it, and felt the scar with his fingers and kissed the words with his lips, each one nothing more than a raised line on her skin if he just got close enough that he couldn’t make out the words anymore. Like he could black them out with his love if he just poured enough of it like ink onto the page.
Threats + Chaos allows for possible change in established relationship, if jumped in previous years can disregard as needed, must break from Death Eater role before DARK Lord returns.
Ron recognized those screams.
“We, ah..” he hadn’t even though of it yet, deciding felt like he was stealing it from Draco, which he absolutely was doing. “We hadn’t settled on one.” He looked back at the car, and counted up his lies figuring one more wouldn’t hurt. “It was something we argued about, friendly arguing, easier to argue about paint then… other stuff.”
“I couldn’t save him,” Ron had told Hermione when she asked why he’d done it, “I’ll save his reputation, at least.” They didn’t speak about how that reputation was a lie, one that Ron had been against from the start. Now he was taking the first step.
They passed him by without incident, and he went back to staring out onto the unbroken line of water, far far far away from any location he could conceivably apparate to.
Then he’d… remembered.
‘Is it finally hitting home Weasley?’ He thought and rubbed his eyes, sitting back up. He’d been excited as he’d snuck through his parents’ home to collect his books and decipher Malfoy’s journals, but as he’d sat with the patchwork of research slowly appearing in front of him, so very different from the Diary that had led him to trust Draco Malfoy in the first place, with two out of four of the books giving him memories he didn’t understand and the other two nothing at all, he found that maybe there were a few doubts.
“I’m what?”
“Curse?” Ron stared at him, eyes huge.
He needed first year, and so he needed luck.
Unfortunately Draco’s journals only changed the inside writing of the books, the battered and tattered appearance did not improve and Ron was doubting the more he switched over if he should trust something so important to the dubious stability of his brothers’ castoffs.
“I don’t get much time to work on it.” Was all he could say to her, and she just tilted her pretty round face to the side and pursued her lips into a loud raspberry. Her tiny studded nose piercing winking from white to green. Her hair styled in loose ringlets were coiling like agitated serpents as the stress and excitement of the day frizzed them back to their tight curls and they  bounced as she stood and swung around the desk, many ringed hands flapping at the air about her head like she was shooing at birds trying to nest in it. Though he had often compared her to a strange combination of the worst of Pansy and Granger, neither would have the complete lack of dignity to stomp out of the room attempting to make fart noises to the beat of distant drums. “Pttttb Ptttbt Pttttthhhhhbbbbtttt” she stuck her head back in one last time to jut her tongue directly at him, cross her eyes, and bast one long line at him until all her air was gone.
One talkative rat.
Plans to save THEM.
Objective: change of perspective; Winky.
“Bloody hell Malfoy.”
“Crossing yourself,” Malfoy supplied, and that answered the question of what that term meant, “You would have, if you still had the prototype on, but once you took it off time caught up with you, instead of the other way around.” He circled a finger in the air, “This is your time now, congratulations, welcome to the present.”
year, hopefully.
‘I think its better’ Ginny had whispered, wracked in guilt as the great looming threat she had faced every time Draco Malfoy’s memory had sent Harry off on an obsessive chase had finally been laid in the ground forever.
They rode in silence after that, until Ron was setting back down on the road and sliding out of the shadows between streetlights as if from thin air just a few buildings over from Grimmauld Place.
And experience was all he needed to send back.
Ron blinked.
the voice with his ears.
He wasn’t upset at Malfoy. He was upset because he was back here, again, when he should have been home, and the person who could tell him why had died too fast to help him. Why had he died so fast?
“Did he say anything?” Harry’s voice was breathless, as though afraid to ask at all and wanting it over quickly. “About me?”
“I told him you were my partner and a damn good one, that you made a living taking down Dark Lords every month and if there were none to be found we fashioned them from scarecrows. Then on the weekends you did naked cartwheels on tropical beaches with the entire Harpies Quidditch Team.”
He could picture Malfoy getting all agitated at the very thought that he had to investigate and plan for Wormtail of all creatures. ‘Book 7 page 53 points 1 and 2,’ he imagined Malfoy saying nastily to him, ‘don’t get involved.’
Disappearing into time.
“Hey!” Ron gripped Draco’s hand in his own, barely managing to keep from being strangled by the chain.
‘He’d notice and raise hell though,’ Ron reminded himself, ‘if Wormtail didn’t out you through the door.’
Like a book being closed in his face the memory cut out.
“They can’t help me.” Malfoy went lax on the ground, as if he was giving up.
Ron ran his hand along the side, feeling all the little imperfections where the dents had been popped back out and sanded down. The journal had spoken about Malfoy’s ‘project car’, he just hadn’t connected it to the battered vehicle his father and he had shaken their heads over as they gathered evidence.
It was hard to think that, once upon a time, the school’s entire collection fit into this one small room, an esteemed institution dedicated to preserving magic and culture, shuffled off by the government to be the dumping ground for delinquents none of the other schools would take. Though, it had been that disparaging attitude that had let Draco slip in under the radar and a fake name, and a box of illegal wands.
But it had only taken that moment, an instant of separation, just a meter or two of space. When he looked back up at his mother’s sharp cry it was to see his parents surrounded by Aurors.
“How do you think?” Ron snapped, putting more force than he really needed to in shoving the other back down and keeping him there as he worked. “Stay still you bastard, its hard enough keeping you alive without you thrashing.”
‘How insightful’ his internal little Malfoy drawled.
Another yawn cracked his jaw and this time he let it, his scratchy eyes watering.
He lifted his wand, rolled it between his fingers and focused on the feel on it as he thought, tried to think, beyond the echo of pain and panic, Malfoy’s and his own. There were three very distinct memories there all mashed together, Draco white faced and so very young being pulled from the room by his parents, Draco rushing the door in a confusing, thoughtless, adrenaline fueled decision, and Ron throwing himself bodily against his captors.
Final jump. It wasn’t the first or last time Malfoy had mentioned that, which had never sat well with him knowing the five minute limit on the Time Turner. Before the Ministry had assumed the two were planning on saving Voldemort, but the investigation hadn’t found evidence of that. Hermione had theorized that Malfoy and Nott had intended to make many small changes, and that the final jump would simply be their last, Ron hadn’t really agreed.
It wouldn’t be a bad thing to fail, it wasn’t a bad place he ended up, but it also wasn’t his place to be.
Impressions: feels aversion to boats, uncomfortable during memory of boat as well as prom invitation, feels fond of students, feels loss as they graduate, isolated from rest of wizarding world, does he never leave the school? Where is school location? What is school name?
“I thought he was making a big deal out of it, I thought ‘Merlin Malfoy if you don’t want to do it just come out of hiding yourself,’. I was so fucking frustrated with him.” He felt that frustration now, as he shifted gears leaving the rural roads behind them and heading towards London. Soon they’d be away from view of any homes or cars and he’d activate the cloaking before taking to the air, for now he just enjoyed the hum of tires over asphalt. “I never thought they’d kill him. I’d never have agreed to wait if I did.” It was astounding how easily he lied.
He apparated into the auto shop at the exact moment Draco collapsed to the ground, and caught him before he hit.
Until it suddenly turned on.
(See the end of the chapter for
Skipping over the very ruined history of magic he stifled a yawn that made his ears pop and browsed the rest of his hoard. He really should have risked any alarm Pettigrew would have raised to sneak into Percy’s room, though the knowledge of the rat still being with his family sat like lead in his stomach, to try for Percy’s greedy little stash of notebooks. He remembered even in his school years how Percy never let go of any of his past notes, not to let them read or be reused. Even his first year journals had sat dust free in their own little place on his bookshelf.
“You used the car,” Draco waved a hand in that direction, “The car doesn’t send you back like a time turner, it sends you BACK, all of your memories, your experiences, your…” Draco glanced meaningfully at the prototype time turner, “specifically charmed items. They all go back to a previous you.”
~*~*~
Her screams, he could still hear her screams, chasing him through time.
That wasn’t good.
Pointing he wand at the notebook he still had in his lap he cast the second part of the copying spell, “Transcripo Sensus”.
Step one, which he had already completed, was collect Draco’s research and make sure the time traveling car would fall in his possession. The prototype had vanished after Ron had removed it, he could only hope it had returned to wherever it was supposed to be in this time period. Step two would be to cover his tracks. Luckily the answer came easily, it was after all Harry’s favorite mode of communication. Draco sent him a patronus.
But at least through this he understood something of Malfoy’s mentality. He was fucking bat shit is what he was.
He was already running on his only reserves of charity for the git.
Five minutes.
Ron blinked, and then gaped, and then made a high frustrated sound in the back of his throat. “What?”
Then he shifted into gear and drove off, disappearing into the shadows.
His sister deserved nice things and he wondered if he could sneak a bit of his planned blackmail over in her direction as easily as he had once scraped his peas onto her plate as a child.
Ron made a frustrated noise as the wounds opened again, grabbing his third vial, he had somehow managed to keep the git from bleeding to death. “Well if you’re just giving up then, at least tell me how to get back.”
He lifted a half destroyed sixth year advanced potions, definitely not a good luck book and clearly should not have been saved from the fireplace after all given how many pages had been ripped from it, and there it was, Hogwarts A History. Possibly the best condition of all the books considering no one cracked the thing but Percy back in his first year.
Ron rolled onto his back, lungs straining from his pillow, and stared at the shadowed planks of his ceiling. An attic room, with exposed beams that he had hit his head on too often after 5
He snapped his bag closed and concentrated, as he had done every time he had returned to the crime scene to study Draco’s place of work, to try to get inside the head of the man the journal told him was so very different from the boy he had grown up with.
“This is my third
Even just that glimpse and he knew what they were, recognized their evil.
“Shit shit shit, don’t talk.” Ron hit his knees beside him and opened his bag for the vials of dittany, but even as he uncorked it and reached for Draco’s shirt he knew he was too late. Malfoy coughed, once, and then breathed no more. “No, Malfoy don’t you-” Ron spread the vial over the lacerations, but no new skin grew. “Fuck.” Ron fisted his hands in the bloodstained shirt and shook him, “Malfoy come ON!”
There was pain in Harry’s eyes, and guilt. Ron had always suspected, and Ginny had probably too, that their time tables and careers weren’t the only things keeping them from tying the knot, starting a family.
“I’m dying Weasel,” Draco spat, and a bit of blood bubbled to his lips to punctuate that, “if you spoke with me you are running out of time, take it off.”
Behind him there were squealing children, smelling strongly of the sun lotion he had come to know the past week as they barreled down the walkway towards the pool area. He had visited it once before, when the boredom and anxiety had sent him circling the ship at night, but had found the smell of the water only did worse for his headache. When he had complained to an attendant about it she had put on a tight fake smile and apologized, saying that the ‘chlorine levels are company standard’ and circled a section of the brochure with random sequence of numbers and an address to express his concerns. He had not attempted to question muggle practices again.
“Go.” Malfoy’s voice was bubbling, and there was blood on his lips now.
He’d already gone back farther than anyone was supposed to, that damn time turner he’d stolen from Hermione’s desk.
So it had been difficult to break the news to Harry the last time, of Draco’s unfortunate end and his ties to Theodore Nott and their illicit activities. It had tore open old wounds that Ron had never even knew were there as he had to question the Malfoys about Draco and learn that they had never even known if he was still alive. He had been forced to witness just how close Harry and Narcissa had become without him ever knowing, the quiet respectful devotion he showed in his eyes so similar to the way he looked at Ron’s own mum, or Andromeda, or McGonagall. Harry had held Narcissa’s hand as she had wept over Draco’s grave, thin and aged and supported by her sister. Ron’s heart had ached for them.
It had been like this since Harry and Ginny had come back two weeks ago, a sudden and disorienting change from the month of near daily firecalls once Harry had learned of Draco’s death. It had been similar to the last time with Ron and Hermione carefully omitting any mention during the first few days then too; uncertain as how Harry would react to it. Now even though Ron knew: denial, anger, frustration, demanding answers and short on patience for how slow the investigation was going, he had still hesitated.
“Take it off.”
It wasn’t like he was ever going to crack open Hogwarts A History.
The final piece would be even more so, he was certain he’d pinned down where he’d gone wrong last time. The block that was preventing him from true, permanent time travel. It had been in something Clavel had said, as they stood in this exact spot and watched the stars, 2000 years before the school had ever been built, to prove that they could, stood where glacial ice crept and cracked and carved its way across the world and ancient humans painted murals of their lives on stone for their far distant children to find, and they were not even the oldest. The fires and homes along the river below them were not new to the area, for all that they were not old. The people had been there for generations already, as far back as could be remembered, and were likely lamenting the folly of the youth among them.
Because he hadn’t really realized it would be the first time. To him it was the last time. The only time. His only chance to save Malfoy, and when it had failed… he’d been frustrated and angry but he had expected it.
“Yeah, its fine,” he said distractedly, glad he was out of view of the fireplace, “just bumped into the desk.” He tried to be casual as he searched the office for an answer to just where he had ended up, eyes alighting on the files spread about.
With a sigh Ron rubbed at his eyes, scratchy from lack of sleep, and cast a tempus. It was early enough in the morning to still be considered middle of the night, but barely, and Ron still had a dauntingly large amount of blue pills to work through and a towering pile of textbooks.
His hand, fingernails chewed down, traced the grain of the wood beside his head, where Sirius would shriek at him from the front page of the Prophet in 2 years time, and really let himself register how small and smooth his hand was. No scars nicked his knuckles or wound up his arms in faded memory of tentacles, no callouses along his palms, no sore on his thumb from rubbing the car key like a worry stone in his pocket all through the funeral.
Harry huffed, staring up at Malfoy and shoving his melting stomach further down.
“You don’t own any maroon shirts,” Hermione said confusedly.
“So?”
****************************************************************************************************
“Hmph! Not many young people have taste like you,” Mrs Finchman said decidedly, voice tremulous. “Anytime you want a book,” she stuck her bony finger out and jabbed at him, “you just ask me, duck, alright?”
“I don’t need your damn pity, Scarhead,” Malfoy spat, and had Harry really ever seen anyone but the boy he’d been at school with? There he was, in the venomous tone and the haunted eyes and the sick pallor.
“It doesn’t work!” He yelled through the glass. “Go-- round-- the-- house!”
. It was Malfoy he was doing this with, Malfoy he was breathing hotly into. The supercilious, posh, bigoted blond boy from school with peevish, beautiful eyes. But, God, there was too much to think about from their school days, and he didn’t want to consider any of it. The place where Malfoy’s grip had been burned like a brand on his left arm, strong and insistent.
He sat at his desk, a little thing under a loft bed he rarely used, and carefully pried open the old ford truck carburetor he kept mounted on the shelf, where the time turner lay hidden.
Sorry its short, this was actually supposed to be the ending to the last chapter but it really didn’t want to be written. Originally all these scenes were supposed to overwhelm Ron with the first penny pill he swallowed, tugging him back and forth among Draco’s memories like the flipping of a page in a book until something like an alternate personality manifested to close it up and put it on a shelf, but through the outlining process and the fleshing out of the penny pills and how Draco exists in Ron’s head and how the memories are moments attached to the place within the mind the spell stores the journal I had to completely rewrite chapter 3 from what I had as an outline. I primarily did not like the way I wrote it originally because I felt it was too close to how many fiction stories portray DID.
Draco had been fixing it.
Draco still Librarian at school, works on the automotives? Large yellow buses. Room had very large shipment boxes, contents unknown, mention of new shelf created by student.
Like Ron he’d been pulled, beyond reason, towards that room. Invisible, impossibly small, flying fast as he could to make the closing door.
Harry rarely was the target of his sibling’s anger back then, always careful of his feelings, excepting Percy of course who had bore the brunt of enough of their antics at school.
Point 2: Blackmail

Quidditch World Cup
“A…” and he remembered, of course he remembered, “In the bathroom, with Harry. How did I-”
“This was vacation,” she had told him sternly.
And this was one day, in one book, in one year.
Then there was the ship, a charter boat? A cruise ship? Was that how Draco had escaped Britain? And where had it been heading, where was Draco’s school located? Ron almost reached for his phone to look up the information before remembering he was years from such things even being within muggle means, let alone wizards, and scrubbed his face with his hands in frustration.
“You’re going back Weasley,” Draco informed him, and smiled, “or did you think you wouldn’t jump again?” He scoffed at the clueless face but it became a bubbling wet coughing fit halfway through and Ron was too stunned by watching Draco die, again, and the dawning knowledge of what the madman planned, to react. “Don’t tell me there isn’t something you want to change,” Malfoy mocked him, tempted him, “someone you want to save? Some hole in your life you want to refill?”
‘Keep telling yourself that Weasel’
~*~*~
So he had cut them a deal while they were still in the dark, and Harry had agreed to table the article until after they had gone to trial and been granted leniency. The Malfoys would pay dearly for their crimes, it would just happen to be in a large sum of money and information about Death Eater activities. In exchange they would not see Azkaban and Draco, wherever he may be, would be fully pardoned.
“Change everything?” This was too much, far too much. “In five minute jumps?”
Ron grinned up at his roof, thinking of how much fun it was going to be to be kids again, running wild, terrorizing his family, showing Harry the world of magic.
“Of course you didn’t.” Malfoy mocked, then closed his eyes and breathed. “For serious injuries you really should put it directly on the wound, as you were doing, however this is not a normal injury.” Draco ran a hand from his chin to his navel, where the lines were… still weeping blood but they looked more like cat scratches now, very large cat scratches. “It shouldn’t exist.”
The title of the chapter is because the first stages of Draco’s formation in Ron’s mind feels like intrusive thoughts, some so minor you can’t really tell they aren’t yours until you have a very jarring reaction to them. How Draco talks to Ron is a lot like how my own intrusive thoughts talked to me. Once I started imagining my Intrusive thoughts with a shape they started becoming easier to deal with, especially the more uncomfortable ones.
Hermione had not spoken a word, her finger tracing over the carving along her wrist. Mudblood. She had opened her mouth several times when Harry had asked her thoughts, but seemed at a loss of what to say. It had fueled Ron’s resentment back then, but as the days passed and Harry had won his battle she had curled against Ron on the couch as she read the paper, then she folded in up and sighed, sagging against him.
The aftermath was a vague blur that he still didn’t know how he pulled off. Lying to the Aurors and the ministry, to Kingsley, to his WIFE, about how he had stumbled upon Draco in an online forum for wizards interested in cars. The wizarding community was still behind in the ways of the internet and it had been no great hardship to fabricate and backdate an email correspondence between the two of them under the usernames of Redkingreckoning and greyeyesoffwhitewyvern, which Ron thought was a great use of wit and pretension for a username that displayed Draco’s knowledge of muggle pop-culture since the git had been living as one,  but few in the ministry got the reference and it made him want to pull his hair out. The email conversations began in an eagerly chaotic back and forth, like the honeymoon stage of all internet friendships that moved from public forums to private messaging. They spoke of Quidditch and chess and cars and eventually their personal lives without naming real names. Ron had been up through the night worrying about how Draco should sound, matching his image of the man in the journal to the one bleeding out under his hands to the boy he knew in school until finally deciding that Nott was the only person they knew who could actually call him on his bullshit and created a Frankenstein character in Draco’s place that somewhat resembled all three.
Sorry I took ages! I needed to sort out some key plot points, because this chapter lays the groundwork for a lot of stuff, and I wanted it to be all there and good. Also, like, it's been One Direction's ten year anniversary, soooo... that's definitely an excuse I'm going to use. Anyway, have fun! It's actually just a little longer than usual, so I guess that's good. Um, also, the last sentence is cheesy as fuck, so sorry about that.
It spilled from his lips like water, and Harry could feel his cock thickening, twitching, his stomach muscles rippling under Harry’s fingers. With one last sharp breath, tears pooling and streaming from his eyes at the stretch, he sucked deep, mouth straining across Malfoy’s cock, tongue gliding across the slit, and Malfoy fucking roared as he came, his hands finally moving from behind his head to tangle in Harry’s hair, unconsciously fucking his hips forward so Harry gagged.
“Is that what we’ve come to, Potter? Tea?”
Obvious, obvious, obvious. Obviously, stupid Draco Malfoy would somehow carry with him the entirely impossible idea that Potter would be behind this whole Muggle song extravaganza.
He looked at Malfoy.
Which Draco thought was disproportionately aggressive. And therefore replied in kind.
Large hands spread across his back, warm and a little clumsy. Shocked, maybe. They pressed Harry to him, one sliding up to tangle in his hair. Malfoy breathed out gently, and his head came down to nuzzle Harry’s head, lips opening to press warmly against his hair. It was completely bizarre, and completely beautiful, and Malfoy smelled like nighttime and smoke and skin. Without meaning to, Harry opened his mouth slightly just as Malfoy shifted unconsciously, pressing him closer, and then Harry was kissing the curve of Malfoy’s shoulder, open- mouthed and languid.
“Forget it, Malfoy. Just… whatever. Go ahead.” Potter went around Draco, leaving a deliberately wide berth between them that stung Draco more than he cared to admit. He was too proud to go after the Gryffindor-
It wasn’t in too bad a state, shockingly. The coppery shine of the pots and pans hanging from the ceiling wasn’t dulled, just thickened by faint tangles of cobwebs, downy- soft and catching the light slightly. The table was thick with dust, though, and Harry didn’t want to even breathe near it. A layer like that would be enough to give anyone asthma.
Pansy answered for him, her love of getting questions right overpowering her need to talk solely about the Quidditch girl.
“Hermione.” He turned pleading eyes on her. “You’re my only hope.”
From then on, the day was a catastrophe. In Charms, Draco massaged his aching temples futilely as Professor Flitwick split up them up again—same trios as last time.
The owl cooed.
Chapter 3 coming.... when school and luck and creativity align, I guess
He was trapped, he knew, but he fought anyway, because nobody would fucking say he just stood there and longed to wreck Potter and be wrecked in turn. At the very least, they’d add that he struggled. A bit.
And then Theo Nott began to transform.
“Oh, Ron, don’t be such a prude,” Hermione waved him away. “It’s a
Together, they ascended the set of stone steps to the entrance of the restaurant, pushing open the glass door and stepping into a large, darkly lit space divided up by jagged wooden walls set at crazy intervals throughout, creating little divots and spaces for tables to go. The effect was similar to that of a high- fashion maze, confusing but beautiful. A woman dressed in traditional Japanese garb stepped up to them, eyes thickly lined with kohl and face palely made up. A Squib. They tended to work in these kinds of jobs, where Muggles and wizards mixed in society, guiding each of them to where others of their kind were.
Now, Draco didn’t want to seem fixated on one bloody annoying Saviour, so he thought it important to note that the Patil twins were also doing a fair bit to irritate him. They kept giggling, high, shrill shrieks echoing forwards and piercing Draco’s ears down to the very tissue of his brain. His peace of mind was so severely perturbed by the time they decided to shut up and work that he had to keep reading sentences over and over as their meaning steadily diminished, until he had no idea what he was learning about.

“S’pose it runs in the family, doesn’t it?” Zabini needled. “You Malfoys like to play the game, but you don’t fucking know when to stop. You just fall right over the line. And the worst part? You drag everybody else down with you.”
Pansy looked annoyed by now. “No, I’m not talking about an escort. And stop interrupting. This ad was for more like a… therapist. A positivity person. But in a resort? You book a stay at this resort, and you spent three days being rehabilitated and given wellness support. So I booked this thing, but when I got there…” she pouted suddenly.
, Malfoy, for fuck’s sake,” Zabini said, gaze raking over the airy classroom. He was clearly looking for something. Draco stared at him for a long moment, before stepping in front of him and waving his arms obnoxiously, bag clunking against his thigh.
“I don’t… who do I…?” He trailed off, brain moving thickly and disjointedly. Zabini stared at him as though he was the thickest person is the world. Draco bristled, and drew himself up, wracking his brains.
“When?” Draco asked, trying to contain the jealousy needling at him. “When did you two become confidantes?” He was aware he was acting like a possessive boyfriend. He didn’t care.
It was, however, futile. While Professor Mancie had her curly head down, writing something on a student’s work, Draco felt something light hit the back of his head. He turned; a hastily scrunched paper ball lay on the floor behind his chair. He looked up, and there was the ginger wonder, looking at him like a spoilt toddler about to poke a snail with a stick. Weasley had no idea what he was doing- Draco was tired, bored, and frustrated. The Weasel would be lucky if he escaped a Furnunculus Curse to the left eye.
But soon Theo’s hair started to grow out, darkening at the roots of its original pale brown and sloughing down around his shoulders in a cascade of thick, rich curls that glistened in the evening firelight. Draco gaped, motionless, as his hips widened and curved, his stomach gaining softness, his waist slimming and chest swelling outwards into two unmistakeable-
Barely.
Potter.
“Don’t think so, sir.” He tried to sound gruff, or at the very least disaffected, and heard Potter snort behind him.
“Up, baby, up. We’re going, we’re going,” he murmured, bending to whisper into Harry’s ear. His hands grazed suddenly over his shoulders, and then with a finality that slammed into Draco like a fist he was curling his hands round Potter’s broad shoulders, helping him up, leading him from his chair.
Draco didn’t want anyone. He couldn’t; it wasn’t in him anymore. His desire, his infatuation, his capacity for want, had all been channelled hopelessly towards one place he was never getting it back from.
Hermione shifted upwards on the sofa, brown eyes soft and intent on Ginny. Ron, on the other hand, was watching Hermione’s face with a tenderness mirrored in his gentle grip on her hand, the way their fingers twined together easily, thoughtlessly.
There was a pause, where neither of them said anything to the other. Draco could feel Potter’s warmth emanating from him, their arms so close they were nearly bumping together.
Zabini smirked, clearly not Confunded in the slightest.
Finnigan looked like he wanted to reply, but then Potter lunged, completely out of the blue, and Finnigan was holding him back, and
Mrs Finchman squinted up at him through her maroon lorgnettes. “Draco?”
Ginny’s tongue slipped out to lick gingerly at the oatmeal, the feline gesture making her eyes cross as she looked up at Hermione.
Pansy flicked her wand; the plates arranged themselves neatly on their table, spooning out portions onto each of their plates, and the silver platters meandered back behind the bar, stacking with a smart clack.
Ron sat up. “The moment you realised you were gay.” He sounded as though he were suppressing a smile, and Harry stuck his tongue out wonkily at his best friend.
“Really?” Draco sat forward. “What house was she in?”
“Yes?” He said politely.
“Fuck off, Blasius. No, I sort of…” she trailed off again, and Draco resisted the urge to throttle her.
with him. I- I don’t even fancy him!” It was a weak admission at best. “I just want to fucking get out of here.”
“You met her once.” Draco said flatly.
She nodded.
And then there was that awful sucking, drilling sensation that pressed relentlessly inwards, squeezing Draco until his skull felt as though it were on the verge of splintering; his eardrums would surely burst from the pressure, and he wanted nothing more than to be free from the feeling—
,” he thought furiously. “
Sorry it ends pretty abruptly- I’m working on the continuation right now! Hope you all enjoyed it :)) (also by the way some errors in the formatting have been pointed out so if anyone spots any more please feel free to tell me as I think my software is glitching)
“Well, if you’re sure…”
But Harry was continuing, cringing as though reliving an especially embarrassing moment.
*************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
“I hadn't noticed.”
“Yeah,” Ginny nodded. “He said it was great at really organic healing, and I should go there because it was like a little holiday, and it was at this nice resort place as well.”
Draco’s hand tightened on his forearm angrily, and with an immediacy that slackened Draco’s mouth, Potter’s lashes fluttered down. The movement looked almost reflexive, his lips parting on a sharp inhale. His body, wrapped around the seat, went utterly pliant and his legs spread unconsciously to shift his pelvis even closer to the back of the chair, pressing up against it obscenely.
“As far as I’ve heard, you’re the furthest thing from a disappointment there is,” he replied lightly, and matched Potter’s smirk.
“Time as we know it was created by humans.” Clavel had said, watching the smoke curl from a wigwam up into the brilliant sky, so bright were the stars that even with no moon they could see much of the world around them. “We track the sun and the seasons and the stars, but we cannot track time, only how it shapes and moves us.”
Ron opened his mouth to reply, closed it, opened it again, then repeated his whine. “I can’t go back?”
He just needed to wait, five minutes wasn’t so long, then he could go back and save Malfoy. Or at least buy him the time to call someone to save him. If he could keep Malfoy alive long enough for someone to arrive.
Narcissa closed her eyes as if in pain, and she must be, as a father Ron didn’t think there was any pain so severe then the loss of a child. Then she nodded, swallowed, and blinked her eyes of tears. They rolled down her cheek and into the corner of her mouth so that she tasted them when she wet her lips and tried to thank him again, but her voice was choked by emotion and came out in a weak croak.
His eyes felt hot and scratchy, his lids heavy. They opened with the same clinging force as the time his brothers had coated his floor in glue and he’s spent several horrible minutes trying to undo every charm he could think of before he realized it was not magical, and at that point he’d had to leave his shoes behind and make his way barefoot to his door, lurching all the way.
He’d barely cracked the door when he’d looked Peter Pettigrew in his beady little eyes and the vile little man did what he had done countless times before, he squealed.
The last memory had been much more straight forward, just Draco amending a few file numbers he had apparently come across in another jump, about Buckbeak’s case, if he decided to follow along with that whole incident. Take out the book, update the case numbers, put the book back, nothing much else in Draco’s mind except the long scrawl of legalities.
He jerked forward, there was no way that had been five minutes already, and opened his eyes. He stumbled against a desk, knocking his thigh into the corner and hissing a swear.
Harry laughed, not loudly, but his eyes scrunched up and his mouth went wide and his shoulders started to shake as he breathed brokenly through his nose in little huffs. Ron was happy to see it, in the sky with no one to hit he could turn and watch as some fragment of cheer came to life in his best friend.
The wand in his pocket felt vile, he loathed to use it even as he shoved his hands into his stolen jumper and cast his usual array of spells to ensure the nosy parents of the wildly screaming children did not pay too close attention to him, having well learned his lesson about being an unaccompanied teenager on this deck.
He did not squeal, at least, but even at more than 30 years of age he did not do creepy or crawly.
He was running out of time, the five minute countdown was sure to be running low, and then he’d be back in his own time and having to face his wife and eventually Harry when he came back from Ginny’s tournament. Tell them he broke the law and risked getting fired, or Azkaban, to save the ferret.
He felt the pull, not unlike apperating, and knew the time turner was bringing him back, but the car roared to life at the same instant, the door slammed shut and the dials on the dash flinched, jumping up then stabilizing. He could feel the time turner pulling him and he understood why Malfoy had referred to them as ‘jumps’, only instead of the feel of moving forward he could swear it was like sinking. Like the moment he leaned too far back in a chair and it tipped. He gripped the wheel of the car tighter and screwed his eyes shut. “Bloody-“
Before, before what? “You didn’t get splinched because of some time-travel experiment?” Draco carefully, barely, shook his head. “Bloody- well that’s brilliant isn’t it?” He tossed the now empty bottle away and struggled through the rest of his rudimentary first aid knowledge from Auror training. “Lets hope this keeps you alive long enough then, they’ll sort you out at St. Mugo’s.”
He did know, at least, that Malfoy was working on tracking everyone through the war, based on his understanding of the journal he had removed from the auto shop. That meant at least that he had finished up through 6
“Don’t talk,” Ron ordered, laying Malfoy out and fisting his shirt, tearing it open to expose the wounds. “Don’t talk, don’t move, just concentrate on staying alive Malfoy and you just might do that.”
