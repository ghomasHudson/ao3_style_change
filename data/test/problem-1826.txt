“An employee of the Auror department?” Robards asked, thunderously, his fists still planted stoutly in front of him. “Someone who is required, required, Potter, to follow orders? To do what is asked of him, according to the oath he took when he accepted this position? Pull your head out of your arse for a minute, and listen to why you’ve been assigned to watch him.”
"Come with me." He said, turning around and heading out the door. His drink and food were left to be forgotten. Harry caught sight of Emilia who was behind the till and glaring at him. The Auror shrugged and smiled apologetically before following the other wizard out the door.
"We're not ruling anything out until the investigation is complete," Hermione interjected. "However, there is no doubt that Malfoy was the one who set the Manor on fire. I'll hand you the file later but we have examined almost everything in the property. Dark magic was definitely used, that's for certain but not in the way that one would expect."
For years, he has managed to not come in contact with anyone except for one. The letters he sent are all clean and void of any magical signatures, having the ability to both remove and mask them. However, a few weeks ago, he slipped. The gift that he sent wasn't entirely untraceable. He left the tiniest bit of his magic in there. Did he become reckless? Negligent? Complacent? Or did his subconscious finally caught up to him, letting him know what he truly wants and needs?
Harry couldn't keep calling him by his last name when he has done so much to erase and go against the Malfoy legacy. He knows that part of the reason why Draco left is to finally start a new life for himself.
"I'm sorry…" He said as he started to step away from him but before he can move back any further, hands gripped his wrists and pulled him back until he's flushed against Draco's firm torso.
"Well, there's a lot of things. Most of them  make no sense but it's the flowers that helped me." Harry continued after he downed the contents of the potion vial. While he spoke, he stared straight ahead. He found the sigh of the fallen leaves calming and not looking at Draco helped both his headache and his reasoning. His brain isn't as torn between believing that Draco is Adhil and not believing that they're the same person. "You seem to like daffodils a lot. It's everywhere. Your shop's logo has them. Your tea cups have them. Your letters have them."
In time, the French Ministry of Magic decided to work together with its Muggle counterpart for the improvement of both Muggle and Magical healing. At first, magic was only used to improve a patient's recovery time and only during the most dire of circumstances. However, just a few years back, they were approached by a man who introduced himself as Adhil Blanchet. He presented them with the idea of using the Cell Cleansing Potion on Muggles along with an experimental formula that reduced the recovery time by 10% at first. Blanchett is still working with them in an effort to improve the potion to the best of their abilities without sacrificing its safety and effectiveness. The Potions Master is also coming up with new discoveries on a daily basis but Auclair refused to tell Harry what exactly those discoveries are.
"Hi, yes. Um…" Harry started to say. He was having a hard time figuring out what to say. Should he go direct to the point again or should he approach from a different angle? He decided to just wing it. "I was at the main building inquiring about your cancer treatment program? I…I was given forms and it said that I should head here for further assistance. You see, my aunt has cancer…breast cancer. She's a Muggle and my family heard about this place and how you're the leading facility for cancer treatment."
"I didn't know that you were such a lightweight, Potter." There it was again. The way Harry's name was said was all too familiar yet different at the same time. He pushed that thought to the back of his brain. He's going to have a lot of time to think about things later. If he attempts to do so now, he might lose his mind. "But, yes. For this potion atleast. I wouldn't tell you the exact alcohol volume that I used though. You might run off and sell the formula to some little creature named Plankton."
Deep down, Harry feels like it's his fault that Draco felt the need to burn down his family home and leave the country. Call it his "hero complex" but he couldn't stop the guilty feeling from eating him up. At the very least, he wanted to thank Draco for everything he did and to return his wand.
At the end of the day, since Malfoy had a clean record all throughout his probation and had already paid all of the war reparations, his case took a backseat to the new illegal potions ring that was reported later in the evening. Harry already assigned some of his best Aurors to work on the potions ring case since Robards gave him the leeway to work on the Malfoy Manor Case as he sees fit.
One day, she snapped but not in the way that one would expect her to. She snapped and realized that she needed to give these men what they deserve. And so she planned her next actions. She was careful and deliberate from the first wizard to the last Muggle.
"Adhil!" A spritely female voice called out. The two wizards turned around to see a petite woman with a pixie cut standing by the entrance while holding a small paper bag. She stopped in her tracks as she realized that there was another person in the shop. "Oh! Bonjour, monsieur! Puis-je vous aider?"
Harry finally lifted his head from the desk to glare at Malfoy. It no longer held any heat though. His glares have lost the hate and malice that they held years ago. It's been 10 years since the war. Harry and Draco became the most unlikely of friends during the 8th year program that Professor McGonagall has opened for everyone who has missed their 7th year during the war. Their relationship was largely influenced by the fact that Harry testified in Draco and Narcissa Malfoy's defense during their trials. Thus, they were kept out of Azkaban. At first, they clashed like they usually did but the both of them figured that their energy was better spent on studying for their N.E.W.T.S rather than keeping their old rivalry alive. They became study mates but after a while they started to hang out beyond the confines of the library. Weekends found the duo traipzing Hogsmeade, looking for things to do. They were sometimes joined by Ron, Hermione, Neville, and Luna but most of the time, it was just the two of them. Their friendship lasted long after they graduated from Hogwarts. Harry decided that being an auror didn't suit him and that he always liked stories. Malfoy was the one who suggested that he become an author. Fast forward to the present time and here he is, faced with the wrath of one Draco Malfoy who always comes barelling like a hurricane whenever Harry misses his deadlines even by a hairstrand.
"Uhm, hello?" An awfully familiar voice said from behind him, making Adhil snap his head towards the direction of the door. There, standing awkwardly at the entrance of his shop was none other than Harry Potter. How he knew that Adhil had a shop at all was a mystery… or maybe it wasn't. He would have to talk to a certain acquaintance later this evening.
That evening, as Harry and Draco lay down next to each other, Harry also expressed something that he's been thinking of for a long time now.
"It's me..." Draco murmured and his voice sent a jolt throughout Harry's body. He now recognized the blond's voice too. It was so familiar but so different for it lacked the acid that it usually possessed whenever the two of them spoke to each other in the past. It was softer and calmer although it did have a hint of nervousness that Harry just wants to melt away.
"Is that…" Hermione began, cheeks flushed. She coughed as Luna held up the item to inspect it before drinking deeply from her wine glass.
Pansy jumped slightly, startled at suddenly being addressed. She then smiled at Luna and placed the note on her lap before putting the necklace on her spouse's neck. Luna returned the favor by doing the same for Pansy.
The entire discovery was peculiar because it's the first head that they found. The others were just limbs. It wasn't even transfigured into a different object in the first place. It was just stuck onto a spear and made to be a part of a scarecrow, replacing its original head that was made out of stuffed canvas cloth. It seemed like it was left there for quite some time judging by the maggots that were wriggling their way out of his eyeballs. It was only discovered because an eyeball fell on top of the daughter's head while she and her brother were playing around it.
"We don't know. Both Ilvermorny and MACUSA officials are kind of…stingy, to say the least. They require permission from the Minister of Magic himself before they give us all the information we need."
The voice was calm, formal, and polite. Both familiar and unfamiliar to Harry at the same time. However, now is not the time for fruitless contemplations that only gave him circle reasonings.
And while it's true that he has no plans of returning to Britain, he thinks that maybe now is the time to let people from his past back into his life.
Ron and Hermione gave Pansy and Luna a wizarding clock for their home, similar to what the Weasleys have. They could add more people there in the future if they want. For now, there are only two hands on it, both pointing at "home".
A sudden crack of apparition from behind them disrupted their conversation. The four of them turned to see Pansy Parkinson with her hands slightly held up as Aurors pointed their wands at her. Parkinson did not say a word, instead she resorted to challengingly look at the people apprehending her with a single raised brow. Harry told the Aurors to lower their wands and continue to investigate the house. Parkinson spared them a single haughty look before walking over to where the Malfoy family's peacocks are. Naturally, the trio followed her while Perkins was put in-charge of extinguishing the everlasting fire.
She handed the letter to Harry before putting the other two back in the box and sealing it. She then walked away from the rubble and back onto firm ground.
It's understandable why Belinda Turnstile, The Quibbler's front desk secretary, would assume that he's here for Luna. Harry usually visits her once every two weeks for tea or to just hang out. Sometimes, he stops by The Quibbler where they would have afternoon tea while chatting about Harry's latest case. They would often be joined by Parkinson who seems to enjoy Luna's company more than she would care to admit. There are also times when  Harry would visit Luna's home where she would go on and on about her newest discoveries, whether it be a new colony of Crumple-Horned Snorkacks or a baby Blibbering Humdinger.
And he was beautiful. The jet black of the Magpie’s uniform set off his pale skin superbly, so that his skin and his bright blond hair seemed to glow. The topknot on his head (which Harry realized was fairly large - Malfoy must have grown out his hair a considerable length) had come loose around his temples, framing his angular face with wisps of hair that blew about in the strong wind.
They were white this time. Malfoy reached down with a free hand, pulling up his jersey as they both gazed downward, almost like he wanted Harry to see them, and that plus the sight of his cock straining against the fabric, wetting it a bit on the front with precum, was all Harry needed to close the distance again and press his cock against whatever was in front of it.
Honesty was always the best policy in these situations. “I’ve chucked the person I’m dating, and I want a quick shag to forget about it.”
“Er,” he managed, staring hard at Robards and trying not to notice his partner stifling laughter beside him. “Is there any particular reason you’ve picked me for this…” he searched for the most diplomatic way to say what he had in mind, and failed. “This… er, total bloody disaster of an assignment?”
“Shit,” he said, standing up; realizing he was barefoot, he pulled on a pair of trainers and made his way to the door.
Harry was gobsmacked. Malfoy was into. He was into. Harry didn’t know the word for what Malfoy was into. Seamus would know the word. He would ask him later. “Why are you asking me to do this?”
Harry sat at the bar, but only ordered drinks for Seamus and Dean. He gave his best impression of looking entirely bored while his friends went out and chatted up girls for him. After about fifteen minutes, they brought one over.
While she was speaking, Harry hastily chugged the rest of his beer and downed the shot Neville had put in front of him. He set ten galleons on the table to cover their tab. “I’m going,” he said. “Dean, Seamus, are you coming?”
Ron would tell him to do nothing. For now. To keep the information to himself until he needed it later, an ace up his sleeve, in case Malfoy ever fucked with him or stood in his way, as he undoubtedly would. Sometime. But Ron was gifted at strategy in a way that Harry lacked the self control to ever act upon.
Draco came quickly, grunting and sighing like a small animal. When he had finished, Harry cleaned him up with a tissue on the bedside. When they played like this, Harry never came, even though he felt like he wanted to hump himself furiously into Draco’s leg until he spilled into his trousers, or whatever else he was wearing.
Harry spent the next day in a hung-over haze. He was aware that his first duty in his assignment was to make contact with Malfoy - Draco, rather, since he was no longer Malfoy, apparently-  and arrange to meet him, so the first thing he did when he finally staggered out of bed was bite the bullet and send an owl off to the Manor.
Harry waited until the rest of the department filed out, the door snicking shut behind the secretary as he left. He and the head Auror were finally alone.
Harry leaned across the table and plucked it out of the fading green flames.  It was proper parchment paper, so soft it felt like linen, and sealed with unimprinted black wax. Harry opened the letter and frowned.
Ron and Cho left pleased as punch, clutching a file full of dossiers on actual dark wizards selling potions that promised their purchaser a very good time indeed. And since Harry’s new assignment was so very trivial that he didn’t even need a partner to carry out his duties, Neville had the good fortune of joining them as a Herbology consultant.
Harry smiled at them as they left. As soon as their backs were through the door, Harry turned around and made eye contact with the three girls who had been watching him while they thought he wasn’t paying attention. A man had been watching him too, which Harry found newly interesting. He considered for a moment going home with him instead. He was tall and had a nice body, but Harry realized that the likelihood of him wearing the kind of attire he was hoping to see tonight was slim to none.
Robards sighed and leaned forward, his closed fists planted on the table. “You’re the only one suited to this, Potter.”
If Malfoy was offended at Harry’s advances, he had no recourse. If he complained to Harry, Harry might threaten to reveal his secret.  If he took it to the team manager and complained, he would know that Harry was of greater value to the team, and he might not be listened to. If he took it to the press, he would be pilloried.
Harry felt his anger burning his fingertips, prickling behind his eyes. “You don’t seem to see this from my perspective, Malfoy, so let me spell it out for you. I went to meet your mother, and when she asked me what I wanted with you, I as good as told her I’d be alright if we - if we got married, if we had a family, that I thought you were-”
“That - that work must suit you,” Harry said. Draco looked vaguely offended. “Because you’re so - particular. Artistic work must - you’re good at it, I bet.”
She was tall, and had long, brown hair, but it was shaved on one side and thrown over her shoulder on the other. She was wearing black boots and a flowing olive green robe that stopped mid thigh.
Seamus shook his head, and Harry chuckled. They spent the rest of the evening companionably, Ron and Seamus tucking into the chips with gleeful abandon and getting more and more tired from their pints. Harry asked after Hermione, and Ron told him there was nothing much to say except that she was chronically exhausted. She was looking after her parents, who were recovering from the not inconsiderable spell damage she’d left them with in her attempts to protect them from Voldemort, and attending law school part time while she clerked for the Wizengamot.  After four rounds, it was late evening and they were ready to take off.
Above the tunic, Draco had draped himself with a sleeveless black robe in the same linen as the tunic, only it had been embellished with panels and black embroidery. The tiny thousand stitches appeared to shift and turn with the fabric, sometimes looking like constellations, sometimes resolving into a single dragon. The weighty hood on the back fell in a great cascade halfway down Draco’s back.
I'm taking a break writing this to participate in three fests. However, I already have the next three chapters written and ready to publish.
It was a home game, so the announcer called each of them by name to come onto the pitch; the fans cheered them individually as they did a signature trick on their brooms. One by one, the other players were called out, until it was Harry and Draco left alone in the tunnel.
Neville nodded sagely, but Hermione rolled her eyes. “A vampire, Ron, honestly. The Creature Department would have heard - I would have seen some documentation, with all the time I spend in the department files.”
Malfoy had just left his probationary period. His membership on the team was precarious. If he played in matches, would the fans accept him? Harry’s approval or disapproval of his presence could make or break his position.
Malfoy’s muscles all relaxed and lit up at the same time. He slid down the lockers a bit, like he was weak in the knees, and let out a soft “oh”. Somehow Harry hadn’t expected him to sound like that; he expected Malfoy to sound sharp and arrogant, but instead he sounded a bit helpless, like Harry’s mouth was too much for him, like Harry’s hand…
“No. Yes. I mean, it doesn’t matter if we have sex. It’s not important. Well, it is. But not as important as the other stuff.”
Narcissa ran her fingers gingerly over the cover. There was a man in a muggle picture with a newborn in his arms. Her lips parted, and the breath she took was heavy and breathless all at once.
“See you soon, Harry,” Ron said as he slapped him on the back in a friendly hug. “Unless you want to stay in the guest room? Hermione won’t mind, she was asleep before I left. Law school is really taking it out of her. She’d love to see you at breakfast though.”
Thanks for reading. Your comments have meant the world to me - I've been too shy to respond to them, but I've resolved to respond to the comments on the last chapter, every one of them.
“Ah, that will be your frappuccino,” said Harry. Narcissa looked quietly horrified. “Don’t worry, it’s not been poisoned. Pick mine up too, while you’re there.” Harry made a shooing motion with his hands, and Narcissa walked to the counter, looking entirely mystified.
“If you are not an Auror anymore, Potter” Robarts seemed to have found his voice again “you are not allowed to use a wand in the DMLE. As per
“But you were scared, you are still scared, of his power, of his fame and influence, you could never look past those to see what a true gem you had in your hands, and now he’s gone.
Draco wasn’t sure if Harry meant that the dinner would burn or that they should eat it first, either way “It can wait.”
I’m not usually picky about my one-nights, but today I somehow find myself rejecting each and every offer on the base that they don’t reach some standard I wasn’t even aware I had in the first place. I’ve had my fair share of lovers in the years after the war, all of them muggles, of course, and I’ve never had a problem with choosing which fortunate lad to take home.
He placed himself on his hands and knees, this way Draco would have clear view of what Harry could offer.
“Bur Sir, what about the anti-apparition wards?” a rookie, Carter asked. Draco liked her, she was not afraid to ask questions if something wasn’t clear, even if the question sounded stupid. Typical Gryffindor behaviour, although Draco had to admit he had grown quite fond of some particular Gryffindors during the years.
The smile didn’t leave his face as he walked his way from the living room to the kitchen and it only brightened as he caught sight of a shirtless Harry working with pots and pans around the stove and humming out of tune, water still dripping from his perpetually messy hair, from the shower he must have taken while Draco was giving the dressing down of his life to Robards.
“Harry stop, I was teasing. You didn’t do anything that I didn’t approve of, on the contrary, you gave me the chance to finally tell Robards what I think of his leadership and his treatment of us. It was quite amusing to see him pale dramatically when he understood that he’d lost both Deputy Heads and you should have seen his face when I took out the ring. Just priceless.”
“Yes! Because those are the rules! How can you administer justice if you’re the first one to break the rules?! So yes, the next time, you will wait, as per protocol, or there won’t be any more second chances left.”
Harry scrambled to find an answer that wouldn’t sound completely stupid and at the same time calm the blond man.
When they had reached the site though, they had been met with a large warehouse full of activity, much more than expected for a simple brewing station. They had observed for a while, noticing some of their known suspects enter and exit the warehouse at regular intervals, carrying heavy-looking crates inside and then leaving the property.
It had taken the rest of the afternoon to clean up everything and take all the evidence and criminals to the Ministry. Harry and Draco had been checked by a healer and deemed healthy enough not to have to go to the hospital, for which they had been grateful, since they both dreaded the place.
Which was both a lie and the truth. Draco knew why they wanted to keep him, but it was true that Harry was a much better Auror than he was. He worked better in a lab, analysing and researching than out in the field, which had been the reason behind the success of their partnership, both Draco and Harry were exceptional in some areas and lacking in others.
So no, sleeping with fans was out of the picture, which greatly decreased his options, since he couldn’t tell if a random men he met at a club was feigning his disinterest in his fame.
“Thank you.” He says gratefully, I guess that giving Granger an outlet for her obsession will ease the pressure on Potter, who definitely doesn’t know shit about makeup.
Then he went back to Harry’s crack, leaving a wet trail of saliva and massaging Harry’s perineum with his tongue.
Though the road to reach that point hadn’t been without bumps and stops, the first time they had been partnered together, straight out of training, had ended with both noses broken and bruises that lasted weeks. They’d had to learn how to work together eventually, since neither of their requests for a change of partner had been approved. Later they had discovered that everything had been one big plot to get rid of both of them, since the Heads didn’t believe in Harry’s real abilities they had partnered him with someone they thought he would never get along with, thus leading to an unstable work on the field. And although Draco had been acquitted of all crimes, the distrust against the former Death Eater had been clear as day during training and had progressed into active duty, the Heads had probably been hoping that one of his eventual missteps would either bring Harry to file a report on him, in which case they would be able to cling to Draco’s past and milk it enough to put together an excuse for kicking him out, or would lead to something really bad happening to Harry or another Auror, thus giving them the opportunity to chuck him in Azkaban and throw away the key.
He didn’t wait for a response from Draco before wrapping his arms around the blond and apparating them directly on their bed. Draco yelped at the squeezing sensation but any complaint got lost in the moans he let out as Harry worked his magic on him.
“Imagine all the things we could do in this month you just gifted us.” He said huskily and felt Harry shiver and swallow.
Draco stepped away from the door and walked up to Harry, who had turned back to cutting vegetables or whatever he was making for dinner, which, judging from the smells coming from the pots on the stove, was going to be exquisite. Placing his chin on Harry’s shoulder and his arms around the shorter man’s waist, he smelled the clean fresh smell of his lover and nuzzled his neck, feeling a shiver run down Harry’s body.
When he came around, maybe seconds, maybe minutes later, Harry had rearranged them on the bed so that they were lying, spooned and cocooned by the soft blankets and the mountain of pillows Draco always insisted were necessary, and although Harry always put up a fight, Draco knew that he too enjoyed the feeling of being hugged by soft feather-filled companions, after years of touch-starvation, one sought comfort where one could. Obviously now that they were together, they were each other’s support, but like Harry always said, ‘just like tea, love is never too much’.
“What exactly is going on here Harry?” she asked in a polite tone, though the command behind her question was clear.
He doesn’t expect it when I roughly grab his hair and tilt his head backwards, crushing my lips on his, but he recovers from the shock quickly and responds to my kiss with fervent passion, matching me bite for bite, sliding his tongue against mine and tasting himself in my mouth.
He felt Draco’s tongue leave his ass as a third finger replaced it, adding to the stretching sensation that Harry loved so much.
Once his heart didn’t seem to be on the verge of jumping out of his body anymore, Harry was able to take stock of the situation, the wet puddle of cum under his stomach and the sweat on his whole body were quite uncomfortable, but he was too tired to even consider getting up to get cleaned up. He concentrated very hard on what he wanted and waved his hand, his wand was still in his apartment since he hadn’t foreseen the need for it when he’d decided to bother his neighbour. His wandless cleaning charms weren’t perfect, but they sufficed. He did one for Draco too, because the man didn’t seem to be eager to get up either.
Harry yanked him upwards and crushed their lips together, slipping his tongue in the other man’s mouth and tasting himself.
because of their habit of disappearing right before an Auror raid leaving behind only smoking empty cauldrons, had grown in the last years from a small circle of light drugs dealers, to a major organization with multiple bases and a long chain of command spread throughout the British islands.
He was aware that he should probably get a start on his report of the raid, but at the moment paperwork was the last thing he wanted to think about, he didn’t feel like coming up with a credible excuse as to why they had broken protocol, again, though he knew that waiting for Harry to start working on paperwork would be like waiting for the Minister to come to him and declare him a war hero, it was simply not going to happen. He grudgingly took out some parchment, but was interrupted by the loud knock on the door.
“Of course my name is nowhere near Pansy’s company, if it was, she would never sell anything. Who would buy something created by a Death Eater?”
He arches an eyebrow in a way that I definitely don’t find attractive, absolutely not. Ok maybe a bit.
“Do I smell good?” Harry murmured while he toyed with Draco’s fingers, interlacing them with his own.
Harry traced the line of Draco’s cock with his mouth a couple of times before moving away. Draco made a sound of protest and Harry chuckled.
“Holy fucking shit!” Potter grips my hair with both of his hands and I moan at the burning sensation, the vibrations run through Potter’s prick and I feel him shudder beneath me.
Harry stopped humming and glanced at Draco with a sweet smile. He took notice of the absence of burgundy red robes and the box Draco had unshrunk and placed on the table.
I don’t know if tomorrow I’ll be able to go back to work and find the solution to my problem, but I know one thing, this night will stay with me for a very long time. The feeling of Potter inside me, his lips on mine and now, his arms protectively holding me as he sleeps, it’s all I’ve ever longed for and, even if tomorrow we’ll part, never to meet again, I’ll keep the memories printed in my brain forever.
Harry keened and his knees almost buckled from the pleasure, forcing him to lean on the counter behind his back, while Draco put his other hand on his hips to try and keep him upright.
“Are you sure?” Draco asked, but his tone was clearly relieved, as if he too couldn’t wait any longer.
“So you see,” he said looking directly at Robards and Marchbanks “since everyone always believed that the wards being there meant that it was illegal to go through them, and no one ever thought to check if it was actually true, there isn’t a law that forbids someone strong enough to try.
Harry groaned and his hips moved forward, trying to get more friction on the now fully erected cock. Draco smirked.
Their relationship had started in much the same way almost three years prior, one night Harry had taken a curse meant for Draco, but had stubbornly refused to go to the hospital and Draco, being just as stubborn, had insisted on heling his wounds himself, which had resulted in Harry sprawled on the couch with newly healed patches of skin and Draco collapsed beside him, exhausted from both their previous work and the healing. Harry had turned to Draco with a soft smile and Draco had lost himself in the green orbs that had seemed to look directly into his soul. Their first kiss had started gentle and caring, both men careful of the other’s delicate condition, but had quickly become heated and passionate as the men got to know each other all over again by taste and touch.
I deepthroat him for as long as I can, the spasms of my throat massaging Potter’s cock as his pubes tickle my nose, I use one hand to fondle his balls, earning a curse from Potter. When I feel almost light-headed from lack of oxygen and tears start to appear at the corners of my eyes, I look up at Potter and swallow one last time around his member, it’s enough to undo him completely and he comes down my throat with a yell.
“Happy now?” he asked Robards in a tone that clearly said he didn’t care one bit about the other man’s happiness.
And despite all your meddling, Potter still came out victorious, he earned every bit of fame he has, he deserved to be
Potter still doesn’t answer, which is unnerving, I haven’t seen the git in years and out of all places, I find him in a muggle gay club.
“I guess you’ll find out with time the consequences of your actions, won’t you? I’m curious to know what you’ll tell the Wizarding World when they’ll ask you why Harry Potter has quit the corps so abruptly. Are you going to lie and cover your ass? Or will you be honest?
Draco silenced him by placing a finger on his lips, Harry seemed to want to go on for a while more and Draco sighed at his cute and flustered fiancé.
I fix him with a flat stare. He can’t possibly be that dumb. I slowly turn my left arm, displaying the faded scar forever etched into my skin, hoping he gets the message without me having to spell it out for him.
I sit up, ending all contacts between our bodies, but just long enough to position my ass directly above Potter’s erection, which I take in my hand and point at my hole. Potter’s hand on my waist stops me and I look at him in silent question, a wave of his hand and my insides shudder after a well placed lubricating charm. I shiver at the slightly cold feeling, but I smile at him gratefully, trying not to blush too much and drool at the casual display of wandless magic.
—Well you know, when they first found you— she waved the words away—. So I was thinking maybe you could go on Christmas, after the baby is born, visit Regulus maybe—Bellatrix kept on talking but Harry could not hear it.
—Yeah, a nearby school had some sort of scandal last year and a lot of students transferred here, it was a huge deal, there were not that used to beasts and some of them are kind of nasty
He leaned back into his chair taking a deep breath and wondered if he was being manipulated, dogs were good at that, the were emphatic and as such able to fake emotions very well.
—With Malfoy? You must be joking— Ron said after he finished telling him how it had gone with Snape—. But you got a 70 on that test
Tom took a deep breath and looked around. Gone were the toys and crib, the evidence that there was ever going to be another child had been erased.
—I did, how embarrassing is that? Blaise was beyond upset, I’m actually leaving the country just to avoid the whole affair— she joked.
—Audrina—she greeted —. I hope I’m not catching you at a bad time, I know your leaving the country again
—Just beast parents dealing with their teenage sons, I’m sure you will get to know the struggle one day— He taunted, pretending not to notice how sensitive the subject was, given that Karkaroff as many other old snakes, had not been able to have children.
—Ignore them — Tom told him in a way that seemed light, but Harry knew it was the end of that conversation—. Eat the meat at least, the doctor said it would help.
—The paperwork is in order and record shows you were even enrolled in a school while living with them in London for a while, is that right? — The woman looked at him expectantly
He went through the group chat he had been added to and looked for Draco´s phone number, he hadn’t gotten around saving everyone’s contacts yet. He quickly founded it and typed a quick message,
Ron was feeling hungry, so he hurried his steps to the house. The little cobble road that lead to the door was a bit muddy after yesterday´s rain and the plants on the garden were starting to look neglected, giving the usually bright house a runed down appearance.
Harry took a deep breath. This lack of focus before a match was never a good sign. He had to get his head in the game, or he wouldn’t catch the snitch.
It was written in the most beautiful script he had ever seen. The black ink was stark against the flawless paper, and every letter curled precisely into the next, the ends of words caressing the empty space beside them with sweeping curlicues. But Harry had sent his letter not fifteen minutes before, which meant Malfoy had produced this script in less than a quarter of an hour.
Saturday was bonfire night, and the whole team gathered on the Quidditch pitch, with all the employees from the office, the coaching staff, and the kitchens, to build a giant bonfire in the middle of the grass and roast potatoes and light fireworks. All the quidditch players were given a strict limit of a beer apiece by the head coach, but Harry was wound up so tight that he spelled his bottle to refill a couple of times just to take the edge off. By ten o’clock, most people were filtering off the field and back home, and a few of the players and staff had spread out on the field on blankets, watching the bonfire light up the crisp November evening.
Evidently, it did not suit Draco fine, even as a place to visit. “Potter, this is - this is where you live?”
He turned back to Draco. He was still sitting on the couch, watching Harry, and one tear dropped off his chin.
None of this was at all interesting to any of the other team members either, except for Malfoy, who was taking notes on a pad of legal paper in a languid script.
Malfoy’s eyes flew to Harry’s, and he looked for a moment as if he couldn’t speak, couldn’t get the words out, couldn’t possibly tell Harry all the things he wanted. “I want to suck your cock, sir,” he finally managed.
“I am,” Draco said confidently, though with more resignation than pride. He reached into his pocket and drew out a calling card. “For my file. If you’d like.”
“You’ve got to be joking. Out of the whole department, you pick me, given our - given our history with each other? Literally anyone is better suited to do this.”
At least, it wasn’t a part of himself that he’d previously acknowledged. And now he had to acknowledge it, and think back to all the times that he’d really, really wanted to dominate Malfoy in the past. Maybe that was more than hating him. Maybe he took pleasure in it, and he’d been so caught up fighting evil he hadn’t noticed.
He grabbed Lauren and arranged their limbs until Harry was fucking her from behind. Her cunt was wet, and he was so desperately hard it felt like he was melting ice cream with a hot poker as he pushed into her. Katherine lay beneath them, and Lauren licked her clit messily.
Because if Malfoy wanted anything more from Harry, Harry wanted to see him crawl. To have to ask for it. If Harry was honest with himself, he wouldn’t mind seeing Malfoy have to beg for it.
The sun cut a clear shaft through the window slats onto Harry’s face, and he blinked as he came back into consciousness. Last night had been. Well.
Draco hummed testily. “I’m sure you’ve been very busy.” His hands were folded patiently in his lap. Harry spared second to notice the excellent black wool robes he wore. For all their darkness, they fell around him as if they weighed not an ounce. A white shirt peaked above their austere buttons, and met the sturdy column of Draco’s neck in a ruffle.
I'm also looking for a beta. This work was unbeta'd, which I think was important as it gave me some space to write, but the next fic will for sure have a beta.
They all hoisted their brooms onto their shoulders and made their way into the tunnel underneath the stands. Harry marched along in stony silence.
Draco made a conciliatory motion with his chin and walked through to the sitting room, at which point Harry could see he barely repressed a shudder of revulsion at the dusty sofas. He spent a solid minute - actually spent sixty full seconds - taking in each option for sitting, finally selecting a rigid wooden chair Harry had shoved into a corner. He plucked it up by an arm and hauled it to the center of the room, across from the chaise lounge.
Harry was stunned into silence; however, given the elaborate nature of the script on the letter he’d received last week from Draco, he shouldn’t have been quite so surprised.
I am absolutely thrilled to have finished this in a way that pleases me. I've been terrified to complete it, and I hope if you've read it as I've been posting that it's not disappointing, too little or too much. This was my first fic to be published. The others were aborted - I did the digital version of ripping them up and throwing them away in someone else's trash can, as William S Burroughs said of his early writing. I have so many more planned - the next will be a bit of fluff on the topic of calligraphy and wedding planning, and I've got a few outlines of novels, so please, if you liked my work, subscribe to me as an author, and there will be more shortly.
Pucey asked, disbelievingly. “You wear… right, what’s Potter doing with your pink knickers in his locker?”
“Don’t look so horrified, Potter. If a muggle takes the card, the letters don’t dance on it. It’s only enchanted for wizards.”
“Or maybe he’s heard something, but he’s not telling Harry,” said Neville. “It wouldn’t be the first time an Auror wasn’t told everything about the case they were working on. He could be keeping Harry in the dark for a reason.”
Malfoy complied, and shut his eyes. Harry pulled his hair again. “No. Eyes open.” He pushed his cock past Malfoy’s open lips, and into the hot wet chasm of his mouth. Malfoy hummed with delight and humiliation as Harry pulled his hair again to get his head into the right position. It was so warm, and Malfoy’s tongue was fast against the underside of him, and Malfoy was sucking on him so hard that Harry wanted to shove the rest of himself right down his throat, and so he did.
Please. Harry could hardly manage to process how delicious that sounded. He filed it away for later examination. “Are you going to take the whole thing?”
Harry had never paid much attention to the form of Malfoy’s flying before. In their past games at school he’d been trying to best him, or goad him, or thinking hard about whether it was worth it to beat the piss out of him. At the scrimmages these few months, Harry had ignored him. But now.
Harry sighed. At least he’d get his locker sorted now; it had been a mess for some time. He was just about done stripping off the last of his pads. He scooped them into a pile and turned around.
Harry knew, just knew, the morning meeting was going to be shit, and he was going to get stuck with some useless case. But if someone had told him it was going to go this far sideways, he would have spent five minutes longer wanking in bed this morning instead of showing up on time.
Underneath the tunic, Draco wore a white shirt, not frilly so much as it was billowing, like a pirate might have worn, only with fewer embellishments. Simpler. It was gathered in a bunch at his wrists, and the fabric beyond the bunches fell down to the first knuckles of his hands, each of which sported a single golden ring on the middle fingers.
But underneath that was a voice whispering that he wasn’t ignoring Malfoy because it was the noble course of action.
It was the worst match of his professional life. He got whacked in the thigh by a bludger and fell headlong over the opposing team’s chaser trying to get at the snitch, plummeted fifty feet through the air and only halfway caught the ref’s cushioning charm before slamming into the grass.
Harry nodded at him. “Draco,” he said, the given name unfamiliar in his mouth. He realized he was standing in the doorway, and shifted backward, awkwardly. “Come in. Just through here - the sitting room.”
The reality was, he did find it interesting. And his first plan of action, finding a girl to roll around with, didn’t solve anything for him. He was going to have to find something else to do.
I'm participating in several fests, so if you'd like to see the other things claiming my attention for the last few months, please follow me to see updates!
“Go to the bedroom and lie down.” Harry said. The note of command was still in his voice, but it was softer now.
on him just in time to see the other seeker catch the snitch, and Harry snatched off his gloves right there and headed in.
“And then -” Neville was nearly helpless with laughter, bent over the table and struggling to get enough air in to finish his sentence, “he called it a ‘total bloody disaster of an assignment’, right to his face. And Kingsley was standing in the back of the room, Hermione, it was beautiful.”
Draco looked shell-shocked. Distantly, the announcer was calling his name, but Draco was rooted to the spot. “So. So that’s how you’re - you’re ending this.”
“Shouldn’t be too hard,” said Ron. “He’s probably plotting to smuggle dark artifacts into the country. Or maybe he’s a vampire. Ooh, Harry, I bet that’s what it is, mate. He’s pale enough.”
Harry looked down at Draco, who had edged closer to his chest and was fiddling with the knotted cravat. His forearms rested on him gently. Harry cupped his elbows and moved him just a bit closer.
Harry had set up a blanket and a warming charm on the edge of the field, by the goal posts, and was just about to doze off from the influence of the beers, when someone spoke from behind him.
Finishing his smoothie, Harry headed there now, peeling off his clothes and leaving them trailing behind him. He turned the water up to the highest pressure setting and stood dumbly in the spray, staring at the floor.
Draco shook his head. “No, thank you. I have food at home,” and with a switch of his long black robes, he walked past Harry out of the office.
“Listen, I know you got caught by the photographers last time,” started Dean, hesitantly, “but that club just down Knockturn Alley, Seamus and I went to it last week and it’s… well, you’ll be spoilt for choice, Harry, if you’d like, we could take you looking.”
Katherine and Lauren were evidently in some kind of previous relationship, somewhere between friends and partners. They kissed each other and touched each other just as much as they touched Harry, just as much as he touched them. They ran their fingers through each other's hair; Katherine liked tugging on Lauren’s blonde ponytail, and the sight of that made something pang hard and lonely in Harry’s chest.
Harry slammed his empty pint onto the table. “Yes, and that’s exactly why we’re all trying to get him demoted, and me appointed,” he said. “The Auror office is full of corruption, and those practices give people a place to hide their intentions. We’re a team. We have enough of a job fighting dark wizards and evil people without keeping secrets and -”
“We need to think productively about this,” said Ron. “Harry’s just chucked his - whatever Malfoy was - “
Robards looked at him, his countenance as severe as Harry had ever seen it. “Let’s discuss this in private after the meeting, Mr. Potter.”
Harry realized Malfoy wasn’t going to help him. He was going to have to do…. whatever it was he was doing. This. On his own.
Tuesday morning, Harry walked into the mess hall, and he could see Malfoy’s shoulders perk up a bit, like he was hopeful, and Harry stared right through him and went to sit at Oliver Wood’s table. Harry made a point of laughing loud at Oliver’s jokes, as if nothing untoward had happened. He hoped that would set Malfoy at ease, like things were back to normal, but instead Malfoy coolly left his own table, where he had been eating alone, and walked out the door with a straight back.
Smiling to himself at the thought of Hermione trying to wrangle an erumpent, he shot off an owl to Malfoy Manor explaining that their appointment would now take place at Number 12, Grimmauld Place, at the time they had originally planned.
And that insight into his psyche, that he might like to dominate Malfoy, sexually. That was disturbing. That was something Voldemort wanted. Lucius. Bellatrix. Dudley. That will to power. That wasn’t a part of Harry.
Harry was starving. “Look, there’s a kebab stand just outside the ministry. Can I buy you one? By way of… of apology?”
It was almost time for breakfast, and Harry ought to eat before he went to his weekend conditioning session, but he lay in bed for a few minutes more. Last night had been his attempt to get what he now thought of as
Back in the changing rooms, Harry savagely ripped off his gear, savoring his blessed solitude, until Pucey came in, the rest of the team behind him, and made a snide comment about the two girls being too much for Harry to handle the same week as a match, and Harry snapped. He grabbed a stray Quaffle off the bench and turned and chucked it in the general direction of Pucey’s head, intending to hit the wall behind him, but it banged square into the open door of Harry’s locker instead, clattering loudly and sending his clothes flying out.
Harry took several steps towards him, pulling off his rugby shirt as he moved. Once it was over his head, he caught Draco staring at his well-muscled stomach.
At this, Malfoy looked so craven with want that his eyes nearly rolled back in his head. “Yes, sir.”
Malfoy complied immediately,  methodically undoing every button on his robes, starting from the neck and working his way downward. By the time he got down to his groin, Harry could see that the black lace had made a reappearance, and he watched as Malfoy slowly revealed himself to him, inch by inch. Malfoy shuddered as he shrugged off the robes, folded them neatly on the circular table in the entryway, and walked over to the couch, his erect penis straining at the fabric, his testicles falling out the sides of it.
When Harry arrived home, an intimidating looking owl was waiting for him. It didn't look like a Barn owl, it was too gray to be a Snowy owl, and it lacked the horns of a Great Horned owl. He wasn't that well-versed when it comes to owl species so he just shrugged and took the large, thick-looking envelope that the owl brought him. It did't seem to expect a reply seeing as it flew right out the window, which Harry understood since he has an idea about who the owl is from.
The young Auror is currently standing in front of Adhil's house. It was the early morning and the sun was shining brightly. He raised his hand to knock on the door when something caught his eye. When Harry first visited the blond's residence, he failed to look closer at the details of the brass knocker but now that the sun is shining directly on it, he couldn't help but notice the imprinted patterns on the metal.
"I now pronounce you bonded!" The Ministry official waved his wand over the newlyweds. A shower of golden shimmer and what looked to be little twinkling stars fell over the top of their heads and disappeared as if absorbed by their skin. In an act that surprised everyone and no one at the same time, Luna flung herself into the arms of her wife and kissed her. Luckily, Pansy seemed to anticipate it because her firm footing didn't falter as she wrapped her arms around Luna and kissed her back. Everyone rose from their seats and gave the newlyweds an enthusiastic round of applause. Wolf whistles were heard from Blaise, George, and Seamus. Harry clapped his hands in genuine happiness, not just for the lovely  couple standing by the wedding arch but also for the air of camaraderie between their groups of friends that seemed to have flourished from their relationship.
Harry doesn't know what this means. Well, maybe he does know what it meant but for some reason his mind is refusing to process things. Its refusing to connect them and make sense of everything that he's known so far. He's the Head of the Investigation Department, for goodness' sake. It's his job to connect evidences and solve crimes.
"Glad to see that you have managed to get dressed properly and on time, dear." Andy made a teasing remark, moving to re-do Harry's necktie.
"Now," Adhil spoke, as he set down his cup on the coffee table. He leaned back and crossed one leg over the other before looking at Harry with a perfectly schooled expression of neutrality. Something about this man's entire stature is nagging at Harry's brain. He feels like he already had the answer at the tip of his tongue but his tongue seems to be miles and miles long. "I'm sure that we're not here to talk about tea preferences. What brings you to France, Auror Potter?"
"An extremely difficult potion to experiment with, yes." Adhil interrupted, turning his back to Harry to once again take inventory of the potions that he's got. "I admit, I spent years researching each and every ingredient as well as the effect of each step in the brewing process. In the end, it was a matter of decreasing its recovery time bit by bit, a few hours to a day at a time. It's like the potion is sentient. It can detect if any alterations are attempted on it. If it does, it just becomes as useless as mud water. You have to trick it into becoming more effective."
Harry was looking at himself in the mirror, trying out his new jacket when a pair of hands fell heavily on his shoulder, startling him.
After the death of his Grandmother the Nott family had taken Neville under their wing a few months ago, and apparently a lot of pressure had been put into Theo to look after him. He had finally exploded yelling at Neville on how he was such a helpless omega weakling that could not even take care of himself.
—He is neither one thing nor the other, what are we going to do if this thing of his becomes noticeable
—Just because you are despicable doesn’t mean we all are — he spat —. I wouldn’t have done that to Morfin, I’m not like you.
Harry frowned, feeling conflicted with the idea, he would get to just move on, nothing about this fuck up left to haunt him later in life.
—There I sent it — he said putting the cell on is ear again—. So what´s this about? I thought you guys were separated.
—It wasn’t my intention, it just got confirmed last minute and… well I guess part of me expected him not to come, it puts me in an uncomfortable position in a way
—You need to google what ghosting means—she said playing with at strand of here own hair—. Oh I know! What if we make a group chat? Now that your friend is here, wouldn’t that be amazing? Hermione you can join, human girls have to stick together, right? — she said all very quickly and smiling, like it was a done deal
—What …—he was starting to ask when he felt a strong presence behind him. Then two hands were softly covering his ears.
—. You guys said you wanted to see more of Draco… — Pansy said  mischievously, giving him the side eye.
Harry felt a bit disgusted by it, everything about Frank made him squirm, and he was annoyed at the bastard, he would probably get a cut of the money, meanwhile Harry would only get and already fixed payment... it was a lot of money still.... if this went well and more pickups came maybe he would be able to afford his own place, a room on his own, to live a different life…
—That Morfin´s death hadn’t been an accident — He said, just skipping the weirdness of it all and going for what had shocked him the most.
The images changed to a studio where a man in a shiny outfit and a woman with a pointy nose were presenting
—Interesting— he barely managed leaving the mocking out of his voice —. you think all parents feel burdened by their children?
—I talked to agent Remus, he is willing to speak in your behalf,  he is… aware that juvie is very often not a solution and would rather work with me in getting you a place to live…and if there is a family that could provide that for you…
—I’m so sorry my lord, we thought master Sirius would have called you— she began explaining in a hurry—. We were not expecting them so early and you said to never call the mistress…
—Didn’t you resent him? didn’t you ran because you thought you were being casted aside because of him? — Harry tried to think really hard, to look for that feeling, to see if it was there.
—Here you go, a hot latte— Bellatrix announced reaching the table and putting the paper cup in front of him.
Remus pursed his lips but complied going to get the money, at some other part of the store he supposed.
Harry tried his hardest to stop bouncing his legs while the noise of the pyramid clock on Professor Snape´s  desk kept ticking. He looked around trying to distract himself as Snape kept reviewing his last test, but the dark walls and sober decoration did nothing to soothe his mind.
—I didn´t, it just became that way, your father gives so little that the people around him end up fighting for the scraps.
—Yes, he said this Riddle guy insisted he should stay here — his aunt was saying, right in front of him at the dinner table.
Tom looked at him strangely and Harry knew he wanted to stress the importance of the trip, but they had company.
—It can be hard to build the emotional bond a parent should have with a child after being absent from his life for so long
—Morfin, it wasn’t an accident, you know that— she repeated louder this time, making a few people on the coffee shop turn to look at them.
Harry had never been particularly on board with this in the first place, back when Tom first got married, but he always took it as something that didn´t concern him, now however he was completely opposed to the idea.
Victor went to take his hand but as they made contact something weird happen. Victor got suddenly tense and squeezed his hand in a strong grip.
—Yes, he just woke up—Harry couldn’t hear the other side of the conversation but he didn’t have to wonder long before Sirius handed him the phone.
—Way to make an impression — Regulus muttered deadpan —. Victor don´t be weird, I’m trying to get you invited to parties here — he said getting in between, making them let go of the hold of their hands.
—You must be joking — Harry scowled at recognizing what it was. The design of the yearly calendar had changed a little since the last time he was here, but the Hogwarts shield was still big, bright, and obvious.
—I haven’t lied — he offered calmy. He really wanted to flash forward this session. It couldn’t be helped however, psychiatrists just loved to play games.
—Does it have to be Malfoy? —Harry rushed to ask, making Snape raised his eyebrows —. I mean…we don´t really get along
—There must be something that will make you feel more centered, you were doing well before all this mess
Harry knocked on the door twice before entering as he was used to. There in the middle of the office, Tom was seating behind his desk signing documents, an assistant standing at his side.
Those thoughts haunt him everyday, reminding him to continue looking for Draco even if there are no leads for him to follow, no evidences for him to examine, and no witnesses for him to interrogate.
"Exactly but when has the usual or the normal ever applied to you?" He said in an exasperated tone. He then gestured to the Masidec still hanging from Harry's neck. "I figured that it has something to do with that trinket of yours."
"What's that?" She asked, nodding in his direction and pointing to her own chest. She had a pair of goggles on. Its lenses were similar to camera lenses that could zoom in and out.
"So, you believe he did this?" Harry asked as Parkinson rounded up the peacocks by conjuring an enclosure. The birds seem to calm down a bit at Parkinson's familiar presence.
His bestfriend physically deflated but then perked up again as a thought seemed to have cross his mind.
"Ah, I see you've met my sister." The witch in front of him commented before tapping the name tag on her uniform. "I'm Claudette. How can I help you today?"
"Agkras, Mr. Potter. Pleased to make your acquaintance." The goblin, Agkras, greeted with a smile. Well, it was less of a smile and more of a grimace. Harry has nothing against goblins but they really don't have the kindest of expressions. "I'm the goblin in charge of the Malfoy vaults. Brunnar told me that you need to view the Malfoy bank statements, correct?"
It was a bit awkward letting people know that Adhil Blanchet doesn't really exist and that he's been Draco Malfoy all along. However, they still value his talent and expertise above all else. Healer Vartan has even admired his decision to turn over a new leaf.
"Yes, indeed!" She exclaimed. "We have received several recognitions in the past year alone, both Muggle and Magical might I add. The usual cancer treatment potions usually take around two months at the earliest to take full effect, correct?"
Potter was panting lightly by the end of his tirade. His face was painted with frustration and his hand reached up to lightly rub his temples. Draco's locket must still be working but only barely.
"I'm only going out to eat breakfast. There's really no need for you to…" The blond trailed off then sighed. "Fine, you can join me. But you're paying for your meal, Potter. Knowing your stubbornness, I wouldn't be able to get you off my trail if I say otherwise."
The man that Geneva hit with the Entrail-Expelling Curse is the boyfriend of the girl who squealed. They were genuinely just joking around but Geneva saw it differently and thought it necessary to attack.
"That's fine," Harry assured her, rubbing sleep from his eyes. "Give me fifteen minutes and I'll let you through."
Draco was clearly in a better place now. He has moved on from the war and has made a life for himself. He found his calling and purpose.
The scent of coffee beans and pastries hit both of their nose the moment they stepped inside. Draco couldn't help but take a deep breath to inhale the delicious aroma of the shop. He rarely comes here – perhaps only twice a week at most and only if he's really craving for chocolate biscuits – and he wishes he had the time to stop by more often.
Potter thinks about it and I take the time to admire him some more, he really is gorgeous. He had been good-looking in school, with the impossible hair that I was sure had to be magical with the way it defied the laws of physics, the expressive green eyes and the seeker build that I had too, but his somehow looked better. I looked skinny, he looked lithe, similar, but different.
Draco took his time, slowly opening Harry, first licking gently, then progressively applying pressure, enough to make Harry squirm, not enough to breach the tight ring of muscles. Finally, when Harry was vibrating with need, Draco pushed past the now relaxed muscles and Harry gave an involuntary jolt at the awesome feeling of Draco’s warm wet tongue moving inside his walls, alternating between deep slow thrusts and rapid shallow licks. Harry’s cock was now fully erected and begging for attention, but he resisted the urge to grab and tug, knowing that it would be over far too soon that way.
Everyone seemed to have stopped breathing, the silence in the room was deafening. Most stared gobsmacked as Robards threatened to fire the best Auror in the corps, others, like Marchbanks, were smiling, but no one cared about them.
Harry tried not to let his gaze linger too much on the man’s Adam’s apple as he swallowed another sip of his beer, but it was like he wasn’t in control of his body anymore. His eyes remained glued to the sight, no matter how hard he tried to look away, there was always something new they discovered. A small scar on the chin, a freckle on the nose, a thin line around his mouth that indicated that these days Malfoy smiled a lot more than he used to in school. It was mesmerizing.
He had to forcibly stop himself from staring any more than he had already done and concentrate on the now pissed off man in front of him.
Potter’s shoulders relax and he even smiles a bit. I try not to stare too long at his lips, I’m not sure I manage.
His nipples weren’t particularly sensitive, but Draco’s ministrations felt amazing anyway. He slid his tongue in the valley between his abs, making Harry shiver and finally reached Harry’s neglected cock, which was so hard it stood flat against his stomach.
It’s my turn to scrunch my eyebrows in confusion. “No. I thought it a reasonable punishment, just like everyone else.”
Draco, on the other hand, had a beaming smile stretched across his face throughout his way out of the Ministry, which shocked quite a few people who’d never seen his so much as politely smile, let alone grin like a loon.
Harry wasn’t a fan of pain, not in any other situation, but this, this he craved. He revelled in the burning, in the stretch, the feeling of being impaled on a long hard cock. His muscles quivered trying to oppose the intrusion, but Harry willed himself to relax and accept it, pushing against it instead of away, encouraging Draco to go faster, deeper, harder. Harry wanted the feel of Draco inside him to stay for days, as a beautifully painful reminder of this amazing night.
Draco saw the conflicted look on Robards face and wondered, not for the first time, how that man had reached such an important position if he didn’t even know how to conceal his emotions, not that it was difficult to follow Robards’ train of thought.
—No I’m saying like full on rage, and erratic behavior, she was convinced she had been poisoned and people were after her… — Draco explained
— And…You are not one of those girls, right?...that thinks boys and girls can´t be friends and worry about every single female around their boyfriends?
He had numbly explained the situation. That there was an accident, that his stepmother was having a baby and it was considered a high-risk pregnancy, that she had just been hospitalized would have to stay there until his brother was born.
Harry scratched his neck and stole a look out of the shop´s window. Tom was still there talking on the phone.
—uhjj I don’t know,   look why don´t you email him or something if you are worried, he probably just wanted to know how you were …uh?
—I know, I was just teasing— he said giving him a playful push—. So what are you doing after? I need hiding from my mother
Ron saw something moving out of the corner of his eye and turned to find Ginny sitting on the stairs, doing the same as him, trying to listen in their parent conversation. He sighed shaking his head, this was the reason he had chosen going to school no matter what, otherwise he would be driving himself crazy like Ginny.
They really wanted to make an example out of them this time, being from an elite, beast…no matter if they weren’t really wealthy or elite at all, the beast part couldn’t be denied, and nothing was satisfying the court. The twins were already doing community service on top of everything and now the civil lawsuit…it was just out of control.
Harry was honestly hurt at the suggestion for a second, before remembering that Tom didn’t really know what he was talking about, as he had never been able to openly say how adverse he was at the idea of going there.
—So Milo — Lavender said interrupting his train of thought—. I have a friend that thinks you are cute.
—Hmm…apparently, we can´t got to Norway— Tom laughed, probably thinking it was a joke. When Harry didn’t answer Tom looked at him again, questioning.
Harry nodded along. Who knew what went on between Bellatrix and Tom, coming to that agreement could not have been pretty and he was happy staying out of it.
—Yes, They say to pay attention to his diet, he is a little on the light side on his weight — Tom lied.
He looked around thinking maybe he ought to wait outside after all, this clearly hadn’t been one of his best ideas.
—I wouldn’t rule out the possibility…if she is going around saying things like that — Draco muttered crossing his arms.
Harry pondered on that little piece of information, did that mean Bellatrix wasn’t living here anymore? With that in mind he made himself comfortable, and just then Tom, as if summoned, appeared.
Narcissa gave her best fake smile as Bellatrix went on complaining about the pregnancy. Her parlor room at Malfoy manor had never seen so much negative energy.
In the dining room the food was already served, but not signs of anybody else yet, he wondered if he should expect to see Bellatrix.
She lost it completely after the baby, full on rage, and erratic behavior, she was convinced she had been poisoned and people were after her
Ron turned his head quickly to find his mother standing at the door leading to the living room. She looked exhausted
The world of this fics is inspired by the manga sex pistols. It is not a retelling of the manga story, is an AU created based on the animal society that exist on it, using the elements on Harry Potter, and as such you don´t need any previous knowledge of the manga to enjoy ( i recommend it though :))
the heir, Tom has made that perfectly clear— she answered, inclining her head ever so slightly, feigning thar supportive understanding that suit her so well.
Thank you so much for the comments and support, today we celebrate the first 100 kudos of this fic n.n, im really happy
—Well once you are back you should come stay with us — he heard Draco grunting in the background, probably not happy with that idea.
—ahhh…Almost, my…dad is outside—he explained and could tell she was disappointed somehow at his response —. But he is you know…compensating, taking me places and all —he added lamely.
—So, Harry…—the man pronounced his name as if it was a bother —. Here I have your father listed as a James Potter right? —
—Alright…—he snorted at the idea —. Anyway, I’m kind of grounded so I will have to see if I can swing it
—Do you need more money? — he offered, bracing himself to another allowance financing his cousin’s defiance.
