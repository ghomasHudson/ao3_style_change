“An Unspeakable will be here to interrogate you”, Harry’s brow furrowed but said nothing and allowed Robards to continue.
He gestured for Severus to hand them something and the surly man took out a slightly big box and placed it on top of the table. He pushed it towards Hermione’s direction and he spoke, “I am sure you know what this is.”
“Young Clarke we bid you the best of luck”, then Griphook bowed and apparated away after handing Marius with a watering can portkey.
Marius was about to say something, but Hermione’s voice stopped him from doing so.
Soon they found themselves surrounded as Fred pushed away from the two wolves and stood in front of the barrier Ginny made. His hackles rose as he growled a warning to the wolves, but the injury on his neck that he got from the two wolves was beginning to bleed.
“Okay, I think Hermione would need to know about this”, Ron said.
Theo merely yawned as he stretched. He shook his head. “It’s perfect actually. I was supposed to meet Marius and the others at Hufflepuff…” He then took out his pocket watch only to have his eyes widening and he replied. “…10 minutes ago.” He released a sigh as he tucked the book under his arm. He was about to run to Hufflepuff dorm when Hermione’s question stopped him from his tracks.
“Marius, take your beast away from me,” the vampire said, wiping his face with a handkerchief as he was slobbered upon by the dog.
A maniacal laugh was emitted by Bellatrix at the sight.
“Yeah mate, don’t worry about it besides we’re with you even if you decided that your mate is a flobberworm we will still be your friends”, Harry said forcing a smile and Ron looked okay now and he punched Harry’s arm lightly.
Suddenly, Marius looked up, a smile on his face. He caught Harry's gaze. There were sparks in his gray eyes that Harry could not seem to decipher. The longer they stared at each other, Harry found his heart began to beat erratically.
"We would have to evacuate the castle. The Room of Requirement would have to do. No one could open it if there are occupants inside." He stood up straighter as he thought of other measures to prepare.
“Oh, come on, Weasley. I was taught that if ever I make a deal, you shake hands to ensure that both parties agree. Don’t you think so?”
The werewolves now all took a step back farther from her, thus releasing all of the Centaurs who were now frenzied to kill Bellatrix. Though, before they all reached her, they all turned into husk as if their life was stolen from them. Bellatrix looked more radiant and appear to be younger than ever.
The Headmaster’s words were final and even if Minerva wanted to ask more questions, she knew she had to ask them some other time. “Of course, Headmaster.”
“Why would he have to erase the whole history of the Malfoy Family?”
“Yes Andromeda”
Draco took a deep breath before he pushed Harry to look up straight at his eyes that look upon him as if he was the world itself.
Orion released a huge sigh and nodded his head in approval, though he was not sure whether Marius saw that affirmation or not because he seemed to be so lost in thought. He stayed quiet and let the blond think instead.
“Avada Kedavra,” he said, with a tilt of his head and a touch of bored tone, “didn’t see you there.”
Finally reaching the end of the hallway, she was then faced with a huge wooden door. With a sudden wave of her hand, the double door opened to reveal a wide room. The lights flickered and threatened to be distinguished when the wind she brought in came through the door.
“Do you think we would back off?” the higher year said smugly.
Silence. It wasn't a deafening one, nor was it like the previous one. Marius couldn't help but bit the inside of his cheeks again.
to Authlene you have my undying gratitude for editing my story
Luna's eyebrow rose at this in question. "Why use that? There is no Blood Ward in Hogwarts."
Marius gave her a small smile. “Well, I don’t really know why, but when I was thinking about what would happen, I felt the need to do something, anything to stop what is to come,” he reasoned out as he placed a book on the shelf.
"The Dark Lord was born out of his mother's hate. He is an abomination that nature herself rejects. But these objects—those trapped souls are what allows him to stay rooted in this world."
“Here?”
“Shall we set up surveillance?”, Harry nodded.
Orion huffed out a breath and gave the three a grin. “Couldn’t be any gladder.”
As soon as the spell hit Luna’s form and she fell back into the stone floor, Ginny felt a pain within her unlike anything she had ever felt before. She screamed for the loss as her tears flowed as she kneeled onto the floor both of her hands were the only ones that is holding her up from slumping to the ground.
. As soon as the rune was written, it glowed and then dissipated as the spell was then casted.
“Now shall we begin our summon?” Nymphadora raised her hands along with Luna’s wand as she felt the magic swirl around her.
“Mother wanted my first kill to be you, but they would not care what method I have to use to do it. Besides, with my incomplete mark, they could ask me to go to places where there are barriers that prevent those who bear the mark from entering.”
Potions class was over and Marius grinned evilly at the thought of watching Blaise and Neville dance around each other for a while. It will be an amusing thing to see. He was about to walk in the direction of Theo, but a hand on his shoulder stopped him.
“Harry I know the new guy is hot and all but please help me with this potion then after you can oogle at him”
A blink and two, then a tilt of the head.
“Narcissa's must've made it in order to protect her child, Bellatrix can easily know who it is if she did not do this”, James nodded to Sirius as the all stared at the name written below, where the picture should be.
“Damn right we are and we will face all of it. I want to face it all with you by my side.”
“Is there really no other way?” Draco’s eyes were downcast as he asked the old vampire, hand held in his. His lips were quivering, but his mind was sharp as he thought about what Dumbledore told him.
"What was that for?" he voiced out. His voice, higher than it usually was to match his girl form, was convincing enough as not to shake from what he was currently feeling on the inside. The damned werewolf only smiled at him lovingly and raised his hand to his cheek and brushing it as if memorizing the feel of his face in his hand. Draco, always wanting Harry to do this to him in his true form, almost leaned into the touch.
“It has been a while, Luna.” He gave a bow and smiled at them, all eyes twinkling.
“I heard from Harry that you and Marius are not mates. You have no right to stop him with who he wants to be with.”
“I wondered what was taking so long.” Her soft smooth voice rang in the silence and Blaise offered his hand for the woman to take then guided the woman to face James and Lily. Hermione noticed the similarities of Blaise and the woman only to realize that they are Mother and Son.
"No i can't", he said and Marius noticed that he lacked confidence in himself so he hummed and an idea popped in his head then he held out his hand in front of him making Longbottom stare at him.
Harry's mind began to whirl. "Are you telling me that in some way they influenced Draco?"
"What?"
“Hey Mari”, he smirked at him and Marius raised one eyebrow at him.
"Yes thank you. And I apologize for bumping to you", those green eyes widened and he stuttered a reply.
Harry and Hermione’s eyebrows rose as they have never seen Ron brainstorm this much other than when he was playing chess.
Marius smiled at her reaction before he began to explain what was written. The girl seemed amazed at his knowledge before Luna spoke again.
Ginny gave him a small smile. “Don’t worry about Hermione. You opened the door for her. I’m sure she will explore the truth soon. She will thank you for that,” she added.
Draco nodded his head at that. There was never a case of a child having both vampire and werewolf capacities or any other hybrid beings. Nature was sure to instill the meaning of balance in her after all. He was the first to break that rule, however. He was born with magic despite being born male. He and Orion stared at one another before the vampire continued his explanation.
“What are you doing? You know very well the danger of what awaits anyone who is with me—“ He tried to push Harry away but his hold on him was tighter than before but was not hurtful in any way.
Sirius’ curious gaze landed heavy on Hermione. He shook his head, forgetting for a while who he was currently talking to. He took a swig from one of the cups in the table and wrinkled his nose when it was just nothing but water. “The Familiars of the Four Houses are loyal to their Masters of blood. Their power and capabilities were gifts given upon them by their Masters. Not much is known about them since the last people who had ever gazed upon them had been long dead.”
She felt her magic weaved all throughout the building as she closed her eyes to have a better feel of it. She searched for her target. She was not worried about being caught as the school reeked with magic from all the witches, her spell casting would go unnoticed.
Marius hummed at that as he stared at the wolf who fidgeted at his scrutiny. He couldn’t have said the werewolf actually did a magnificent job at calming him down so bluntly now, could he? He had more than enough embarrassment of the day.
' Marius thought as he spun around so he could come face to face with Ron, smug and all.
“Damn you, Narcissa!”, she knew this spell very well, one that her sister once told her about.
It took Ron some time to realize what Harry meant to say. But when he did, his breath hitched.
Marius grabbed his school robes after that and went out. It was past curfew, he knew, but he couldn’t care less. He blew air to his fringe to keep it away from his eyes as he headed to the Astronomy Tower to calm himself.
Blaise, who realized that Neville and Marius were still in the greenhouse, began to rush there, leaving Theo and Pansy to deal with the other lower years who seemed afraid. Every one of them knew what Wolfsbane could do to a werewolf. Either they die or they lost control and kill everything in sight until the Wolfsbane was out of their system.
"Yeah, there is. You're a human. Vampires treat your kind as food and Neville, well, he is a werewolf."
Narcissa gave the old woman a small smile.
Not knowing where the ingredients cabinet is he slowly poked the boy that was sitting near him, he could’ve poked the Gryffindor boy from a while ago but he was busy stirring so he thought not to.
“It seems like his darkness has grown. I no longer even have to lift a finger.” She placed her hand on her back as she hummed away to Ravenclaw Tower.
Bellatrix’s eyes gleamed and her smile turned wicked. “To continue on being a Null, one has to maintain a balance of Light and Darkness within them.” She conjured a wisp of her magic which took the form of werewolves. One was a pure white and the other was midnight black. They danced together in a circle, as if in harmony. “But, if one were to tip the balance…” She used more magic on the black one and in a cruel way, it devoured the white meek one, leaving no trace. This demonstration made her daughter understand and she smiled wickedly as well as her Mother.
“You have nothing to be jealous of, my dear Nymphadora.”
Grey met brown and it looked as if they had a silent understanding.
“I meant why doesn’t he smell like fear or anything at all?”, then it suddenly registered to Harry that even he could not smell anything from the human. He knew that every being has their own scents that make them unique but that human has no scent at all.
Albus went on and told them about what the children had planned for him and for Hogwarts, about Orion, about the Dark Lord, about Narcissa. When he finished, the room was fully silent. The shock was an understatement from the faces of the adults in the room. He tried his best to never once mention about Draco's or Marius' involvement on the matter.
“Is this really how twisted the world is?” he asked as he watched the way the wounds on Lovegood’s back healed slowly.
“I found one.”
“Mr. Weasley, are you mocking me?” Professor Snape’s booming voice made Ron snap out of his trance at the same time he toppled over to the floor due to his surprise. The whole class burst into laughter and the Professor looked like he was preparing something devious for Ron.
Bellatrix looked around her at the barrier casted around her and the Dementors she had summoned. She cackled in delight as her dark aura puffed out of her like smoke, she could feel the panic of all the professors and it fuelled up her glee.
"You don't have to hide anything from me Orion,” the human said. His voice soft. “I am sorry, I viewed your memories in order to determine whether I can trust you or not. I only saw bits and pieces of it, though, but that was more than enough."
The coldness that seeped through the Centaur’s bones and froze her blood was something she felt like she could not bear, but as she peeked to see her son, she would take it. The woman swallowed, she knew it was an empty promise. She knew they would all die but still, she could not help it. Her love for her child was so great that she had to try and save at least his life. However, she did not realize that in her moment of weakness, Bellatrix had already seen what she needed.
The ghost merely glared at him but as soon as she saw Harry, she squealed.
Pansy grinned at Sirius’ forwardness and her fang gleamed in amusement. “Of course not, Sirius Black.”
“I apologize if I startled you and for bumping into you,” Hermione said sincerely that something within those eyes of the blonde-haired woman changed. She then reached up Hermione’s hand and Hermione helped her up, their contact a bit closer since Hermione tugged on her slightly too much.
“I know that you are truly loyal. But you and I both know that if Harry did complete his transformation, he would not recognize any of us until the Wolfsbane is out of his system.”
i dunno when my next update will be cuz real life is dragging me away but hopefully i will able to update again this month once again thank you guys!!
Harry let out another sigh, completely ignoring his professor before he pondered for a moment just how many sighs he had already done in such a short span of time. He didn't dwell on the thought for long enough as it was soon filled again with things he would rather forget about but for the life of him, he couldn't do so. For example,
“Harrykins!”A voice from Harry’s side was heard and his head was then ruffled, a familiar gesture one that George does.
Harry sighed, knowing that the vampire would not explain more. So he stood up and opted to leave when the vampire's voice stopped him in his tracks.
With that, Harry was able to step out relieved.
Severus nodded in understanding.
hopefully i will be able to update again by tom since i have no classes Xd
But his eyes snapped open when he heard the snap of a twig behind him. He looked back as quickly as he could and drew his wand as he now stood on the branch. Green and icy blue met and Draco's grip on his wand tightened as he thought,
“My Father would be alright. However, I’d rather have him back by my side.” And for the first time since they had met the new Sire of Vampires, they saw a hint of emotion within his features. The mood was now sombre and the adults were feeling sympathetic towards the boy.
Ginny’s lips didn’t immediately curve upwards at the answer, but the slight twitch at the corner was as close as she could be to a smile at the moment. She then darted her eyes towards Orion who was playing with his food, faking uninterested gesture which kind of failed horribly.
"Go on, Neville, continue," Blaise said, finding the trying-hard-to-explain Neville adorable.
"Your eyes, it has the same color with the spell Avada Kedavra", and Harry was rooted on his spot, he had heard a lot of different compliments about his eyes, about them same as his mother's, that they look like emeralds and that they were beautiful. But never this, then he stared at those cold grey eyes watching him blankly.
i wont be updating by next week since i need to focus on my finals which is coming up, wish me luck!
The dog whimpered and tilted his head while Marius rolled his eyes. He ruffled Beau’s fur before he went to the bathroom and decided to take a bath.
Tears fell from Draco’s eyes as he clutched Harry’s shirt tighter and closed his eyes. “Promise me something.”
“I’m sorry. It’s just that Marius was supposed to meet up with me for the ingredients of a potion he wanted to brew and I—“
“Do we kill the unconscious ones?” Barty voiced out, his claws already out. He hissed when the snow touched him.
"This means that I am in the presence of my old friends." A small smile was shown on the lips of the hologram, her eyes kinder for a while before she continued. "Forgive me for suddenly disappearing, but I had to." Her hand unconsciously went to hold her stomach and a fond smile appeared on her lips as if remembering something.
It was three days later and Harry still found himself feeling extremely stressful because, for the life of him, he couldn't stray his eyes from Marius whenever the human came into the vicinity. He was so pissed off too and very much in need to calm down a bit. So, the young alpha tried to think of a place he could spend some time to loosen up a bit. He chose the Whomping Willow as his destination to go and clear his mind off by sleeping there, but the sight he saw when he arrived made him stop in his tracks.
“Go on. Ron,” Hermione said and they all waited with baited breath on what the red-head was about to say.
“That anyone would be very lucky to have you.”
“Hey if you guys need help in Potions I will gladly help you along with Neville, and Neville can help you with Herbology and you can help me in both Vampire and Werewolf Studies along with History. How about it, I mean it’s not that bad if we study together, right?”, he waited for their responses and Blaise nodded along with Theo.
“I wonder what dear sweet Andromeda will do.”
cousin. It pains me to know you think that low of me,” he said, voice dripping with fake hurt. “I don’t know
“I see you guys were holding a small party here.” A smile bloomed on his face as he saw a bunch of food at one side and his fellow pack mates all grinning up at him.
"Why can't I smell your scent?"
Dumbledore was impressed. It seemed like the two had already planned this all so carefully as to assure if ever some things might not go according to their plan. He felt proud and yet sad, as they were just but mere children but their innocence, their happiness, were robbed from them at a very young age.
“Beau, stay here, okay?”
Draco looked up to Severus, not understanding, but before he could explain, Regulus spoke up to answer the puzzled expression on his face. “We never had any names. I was called Vessel and—“ He looked warily toward his brother and he answered for Regulus.
“Her memories,” the ghost that looked like Narcissa Black spoke.
"Astronomy Tower," answered Hermione quickly.
Seamus’ voice echoed in Harry’s head. His heart sank and an erratic beating of his heart was felt and heard by no one but him. He felt Ron’s hand tugging him, but all he could hear was the voice inside of his head shouting in denial.
"Works like a charm as Mother said."
Dumbledore's eyes widened. "Does he know who you…" Dumbledore did not think of continuing as Draco shook his head. Then his eyes regarded Orion and he asked, "Young Orion has been…"
"Did you know?" Dumbledore watched as Draco patted the young Alpha's fur with such care that he had never seen Draco show on anyone and he knew exactly what he was referring to.
He opened his eyes and looked towards the one who called him and all he saw was
Hey guys sudden update for today since i might get busy again the following weeks, though i will try my best to finish up another chapter on monday and if sempai will not be busy, she can beta it and i will be able to update again!
He huffed and headed to the ingredients cabinet. He precisely picked what they needed. He was about to leave when he felt someone held his arm. His eyes trailed on the arm and saw Potter holding him back. He glared murderously and Potter looked at him with equal distaste.
“Hey, wh—what?”
Draco began to think about what it meant as well. It first showed Ginny of her mate, but then her mate faded into a child. Most interpretations would be that it showed Ginny of their future child with her mate, but then the words left to her were what sounded wrong to him. Though the future had dozens of interpretations and they were ever changing.
Marius wished he could cast a Warming Spell but that would be a huge no for him. He needed to be more careful with his magic. But then, he felt someone rested a warm cloak on his shoulders. He looked back, only to see Harry without his black cloak in his form. The werewolf only wore his school robes now and he did not even look cold a bit. The human was about to protest but Harry spoke before he could.
Neville’s expression could be described as horror. “Marius! That is dangerous! Do Theo, Blaise and Pansy know?”
“Excellent, now Mr. Clarke. After your exam with Professor Snape he will kindly escort you to Professor McGonagall, won’t you Professor Snape?”, then he turned to look at Professor Snape who looked about to snap but was holding it in.
?" asked the vampire, now wary of what might happen next or what this cousin of him would do later.
Lestrange scoffed at this before he began walking away. This time, though, he was the one who was stopped by the other.
“Don’t call me that.” The other’s voice was sharp as he slowly approached him. He tried to take a step back but sadly there was no way to do that as the ledge was already stopping him to do so. He shrugged at the werewolf and looked back into the sky once more.
“It really doesn’t involve you two so why don’t you leave now that you are done with your business here?”
“Y-you are just a human! You know nothing of the spell that allows you to do that!” she said in desperation.
“Get out of Luna’s body”, she snarled at Luna whose smile only widened.
"Ab—“
Hermione arched up her head to look at her. She seemed even younger and her face expressed no emotion as she began to watch her surroundings.
“Why you!”
Harry quickly turned to Hermione. “Uh, see you later,” he said and turned to Myrtle, mumbling the same thing, but he did not even spare Marius a glance before leaving the room altogether.
Also thank you all who have left me kudos, comments I like hearing your thoughts, those who subscribed, bookmarked and gave this story a read thank you all so very much!!!!XD
enjoy~
“Wait.” Marius stopped in his tracks and looked back, tilting his head in question. Then, with a wave of hand and a mumble of spell from Ginny, the blood stains in his clothes were gone.
the human mentally chided himself. He almost forgot about that. In this world, unlike the Muggle realm, they had mates. How could he not remember something so vital? But well, once again, it wasn’t like he liked Harry that way. Or so he told himself.
“Don’t mind Pansy, Longbottom.” Orion’s blank voice almost made Neville jumped and significantly made him even more nervous than before. He looked behind him to see blue eyes watching him. “She just loves spiking reaction from people.”
“That is actually the problem. We need Luna’s help in opening the Chamber,” Hermione said as Ron and Harry leaned on the walls, looking queasy.
“You never mentioned about the familiars.”
Harry, Hermione, Ron, and Orion looked at Marius with eyes full of worry as they could not comprehend what was currently going on within his head.
Harry heard Lestrange’s sigh before he crouched in front of Marius, giving him his back. Marius' eyes widened for a bit and a grin was beginning to form on his lips. Harry felt a sudden urge inside of him, fury and jealousy, even though he didn’t know why.
“Three years ago. You may have been called the Leader of Ravenclaw, but Chang controls everything behind your shadow. We have watched as she bid her time, waiting for the day to challenge you. But that day never came as she seemed to have been amused in watching you act as a Leader in name only.”
“What is it to you?” Lestrange smirked.
"Where are you two going?", Blaise smirked at her while Theo merely looked bored slinging his bag on his shoulder.
“She would never do that!”, she looked towards her brother and Hermione only to see pain in their eyes.
“I’m here,” Orion whispered continuously as he rocked them both, drawing circles on his back. The boy’s cries stopped as he seemed to have slept, the exhaustion seeping into him.
. His mind supplied he knew he was just making reasons for himself right now, to run away from the horror of what he had done.
When none of them moved, too stunned, Madam Pomfrey took this as her cue to enforce her rules. “I think it is best if you all leave.”
Orion's mouth sealed shut at that. Marius words were final and, he thought, such certainty definitely came from an absolute belief that left no room for argument unless otherwise, one hundred percent proven wrong. And, well, every legend had the tiniest of truths in them after all.
this chapter has been edited by Authlene and i am really grateful and happy i got to meet her, she is a very awesome person. thank you again *bows*
Marius took a letter that went along with it. The writing was impeccable, but the ink was not black. It was red. Blood, Marius deduced. He ignored that fact in order to read the letter.
Thanks for the kudos and comments, i appreciate it. makes me more motivated in writing
Draco huffed out a wet laugh. He finally began to circle his arms around the other, closing his eyes and seeping in all the warmth that Harry’s arms were providing him.
Harry sat with Ron and his other pack mates in Gryffindor table. He was physically there, but his mind was elsewhere. Until now, he could not help but feel bad at the way he had been avoiding Marius these past few days. He was sure as hell Hermione noticed him and he was about to hear a very long monologue from her again. He grunted at the thought of that, but he was sure she was going to understand why he did it. Though, the guilt that ripped through him as he saw Marius’ eyes dimmed whenever Harry avoided him made his heart clench in the worst way possible.
“Soon, Cissy I will destroy your barrier, and not to worry I will hunt down my dear nephew and he will follow you soon enough in the land of the dead”
Gasps were heard from all around. Harry, Hermione, and Ron could not comprehend what just happened. Before they could ask her – the huge creature, a basilisk – began to petrify people around them. Harry could only grit his teeth as he barked orders and began to help the other students escape.
“This crest.” Draco’s hand trembled as he slowly lifted up a bracelet. Hung upon it was a shield-shaped metal with the crest of a snake with emerald eyes eating its tail.
Then, his mind came to a halt. ‘
“Find wh—“
Neville released a long sigh he was holding.
“Aren’t you going to burn it?” he asked the woman once more.
“Mother, what did you do?”
It took a long time for the child to finally open up to the boisterous Lucius, but had indeed saved that child from his self-destruction and now once again Severus was headed down that road again. Many of them blamed the Dark Lord for what he made Severus do. Just the thought of it made his blood boil in hate for the Dark Lord. Severus who swore loyalty, who was saved by the Malfoy Family, was forced to kill the same family that he only ever loved.
“Their souls are almost bonded together by another, trying to sever that bond could result to your friend dying”,
The vampire let out a sigh.
“Ah and Mr. Clarke since you are the only human attending do be careful of the Slytherin House”, Marius’ eyes perked up at this then he retorted.
"Hm?"
So she took a gamble, a gamble that she hoped would reach her scattered allies. She raised her sword up tip pointing the ground. The wraith and the woman looked up at her and with all her remaining strength struck it to the ground and broke the barrier of the house.
“What’s wrong?” Marius spoke.
“I won’t do that to him!” Harry replied with rage.
“At such dire times, you dare to interrupt me.” Her voice was icy as she spat the words.
"I have things I need to tell you and I want to ask a favor from you."
Meanwhile, the others opted to silently watch. They were still not relieved from the shock. This was not the first time they heard of Draco Black. Dumbledore had told them before about him, but the knowledge that Marius personally knew the most wanted child of their time was an entirely different thing altogether. If any of the marked vampires in Hogwarts were to find out about this, they were sure to torture him for his location.
“Even if you tried, this snow will continually heal them,” Bellatrix voiced out as she played with the snow that kept on falling from the sky.
“But Master not ate yet”
“Amazing,” she murmured. Marius soon joined her, tracing the same marks as well.
"I need to see Orion to discuss our potion. Bye!" he shouted his farewell as he ran down the stairs. Theo tried stopping him but was too late. The vampire merely sighed. If he went away, the door wouldn't open and God-forbid if Blaise ever tried something like marking Neville. Orion would behead him before he even stepped foot into their common room, so he opted to stay and count the time.
Ginny sucked in a deep breath as she sat up, breathing heavily. She looked around her to see that there was nothing, just plainly darkness.
“Thank you. Seeing the present gave me something to think about.”
“No just tell me what is inside it”
Marius’ eyes almost popped out of their sockets when he could register who exactly the woman is. He almost spoke it out loud in his shock, but Hermione beat him to it which made him pull himself together.
Sighing and feeling defeated as he found none since he only brought his books with him he then asked for Theo's palm. At first, Theo looked at him weirdly but then obliged. Marius drew the pattern on his palm.
Neville’s eyes lit up once more at the revelation. Blaise placed a hand on his back to give his own support. “Thank you, Marius.”
Marius was seething with fed up energy. He wanted to blow off some steam. However, he could not do just that. His cousin, as soon as he had calmed himself and assured Marius a dozen of times that he was okay, headed off to the dungeons. He couldn’t do anything after that.
Marius’ eyes widened. He had never heard of it before nor he ever bore such a mark despite being born a Black.
The others, as if on cue, raised an eyebrow at that statement. They had never heard Orion mention anything about his mother. The identity of Mrs. Lestrange was a huge mystery to all of them.
“And these killing started up once again when he disappeared is that it?”, Ron nodded, he took out a small box from his pocket and enlarged them showing dozen case files all with the same victims.
“Tsk tsk tsk. Theo, Theo, Theo. You could just tell me clearly that you liked Marius”
“He would be tortured for information.”
Authelene-sempai thank you once again for the editing of this chapter!
"I could understand if Hermione was able to plan this all out but how—how was any of them able to get the Lestrange boy to side with them?" and that was the question that Albus was dreading about. But he only has one answer to it all as he was sure that his allies would question him without a doubt from keeping such a crucial information.
Hermione closed her eyes before nodding in understanding. “We cannot allow them to find Draco before we do. Because if they do, Draco Black will be instantly killed and the Blood Ward of Gryffindor Lands will fall.”
Draco stood still, composing himself. His beating heart and the traitorous tears that are trying to spill from his eyes as his resolve began to shake as soon as he saw those green eyes stare straight back at him.
The Potion's Professor rolled his eyes as if it was obvious to him. "As soon as he cast the circle that blocked my path from leaving," he drawled as he sat at one of the chairs in the Headmaster's office, placing both of his hands to its respective armrest.
“I will”
“It is possible. She said ‘the monster would live in another vessel and return once again’, so I think the Dark Lord was able to transfer his soul.”
Then, Blaise began to sing. “Ron and Pansy, sitting on a tree. K-I—“
“You agreed to this Harry?” the werewolf asked and Harry nodded.
Draco could not help by the way that Dumbledore’s eyes lingered on Orion and the vampire seemed to have noticed this too, so he only drawled. “No one has been capable of reading my mind even with torture ever since I was ten.”
“Please, don’t cry. I want you to smile, G, like you always did. Remember, you will face a lot of things in this life but despite it all, you have to live. Know that we will meet again at the end of all of this. I love you, G. Always remember that.”
Hermione smiled at Marius’ explanation. She no longer needed to add anything anymore as the human already gave it all. She could understand now why Harry seemed so fixated on the human. His intelligence astounded her that she found him interesting.
Marius noticed that she was fiddling with her hands and so he released a sigh. "What is it that you want to ask me?"
“Ah and I have heard from Severus that you were able to perfect all of your brews yesterday, he also wishes you to enter his Sixth year class and not the Fifth”, Albus said as he opened one of his candy from the table and gestured for Marius to pick one but he shook his head. Then the words sunk in to Marius’ brain then he stared at the Headmaster.
“Something on your mind?” Ginny then voiced out.
"I'm glad you are all safe."
“I should be mad at you,” said Draco weakly.
Her face looked happy as she closed her eyes as if reminiscing those days. Once she opened them, they were now full of nothing but sadness.
Theo looked so hurt when he said that, almost as if the memory itself harmed him physically. Marius sighed before putting a hand on the vampire’s shoulder in a calm reassurance.
“Okay then, here we go.”
Theo came from behind them to place a huge map of the Castle on the coffee table and it showed some red x marks on it, showing where they have tried to search for the Chamber.
"Well, after I saw you collapsed at one of the alcoves, I rushed out to help you. I levitated you to the Hospital Wing. Madam Pomphey was shocked."
“When did this happen?” Hermione who sat next to Ron asked them suddenly.
Harry put his hand down and looked at Ron straight in the eyes. His mouth twitched in an amused manner, but his gaze was rueful. When he answered, his voice was just as soft if not strained. “I can’t do that.”
"Dumbledore is back from his business trip and Harry had already asked to speak with him into Room of Requirement after curfew.”
"Why are you guys here anyway? Don't you have Vampire training?"
“Tell me what?”
“Neville is right.” The others nodded, remembering things that happened in the past where Potter’s impulsiveness worked before words or hell—thinking. They all shook their heads in resignation. They wanted this plan to work and they will not let Potter’s annoying impulses to get them into trouble to make them fail.
Theo hummed, clearly not satisfied but also not wanting to cause Marius discomfort. So he waved his hand as if telling an alright. He then took a step back. His mind was reeling with questions as he crossed his arms. He knew Marius obviously didn’t want any pity or him blindly charging the other vampire to take revenge, but he just couldn’t help himself. He was in the middle of calculating how many rules he would break if he somehow catches sight of Flint when suddenly Marius spoke.
Slightly, his eyes widened as he remembered himself coughing up black blood—rotten black blood that would soon happen to him often as the change and battle for his magic would begin within him. He felt pathetic letting a single word from Harry break him.
Theo gave a grin and nodded before he left the room. This made Marius curious as to why the witch would want to spend time with him, but he waited until the witch would ask as he began to carry books back to their original bookshelves.
“Wait. What do you mean by that?
“Kill me”
He just had to apologize to Ron later then, the werewolf thought, as he also tilted his head and decided to watch over the sleeping human. His thumb brushing on the side of Marius' hand now and then. He closed his eyes, releasing a sigh he did not know he was holding.
“Could you bring me to Gryffindor Lands?” Dumbledore's eyes widened and Orion was worried.
“You said the same thing as Theo,” answered Marius.
Hermione spoke again. “She was preparing you for this day, wasn’t she?”
The following chapters are the events that occurred during the 2 year gap before chapter 34.
“Will you accept my oath as your own and fulfil it no matter what the cost?”, Ron swallowed and looking at Harry whose barriers are breaking every now and then and the wounds he was sustaining getting bigger by the second. He could not lose him again; never lose a brother ever again.
As soon as they turned her on her stomach, she hissed in pain. There were four huge lashes on her back that were caused by magic, her clothes were now in tatters. Madam Pomfrey gasped at this. Out of curiosity, the other three looked as well and they were all equally shocked.
, the way she tried to apprehend him in his mischievous ways, in trying to sneak up on her or brewing potions he was not supposed to.
Andromeda’s lips thinned as she pursed them. Her aura of anger slipping from her form.
The werewolves, other than Lily, were glaring openly at Severus. The tension in the air was thick and heavy. Hermione could not help but turn to stare at the vampire who still hadn’t revealed himself. She was unsure on how the he was feeling, but she noticed that the he did not shy away from their glares and seem to glare back at them.
"Brat! You better run off to your dorms now and not get caught," he huffed and a giggle erupted from Draco's feminine lips as he began to step back.
As soon as Luna was about to run past the right corridor, Ginny caught a glimpse of her and began to chase them. She casted a spell to prevent others from feeling her presence, but as soon as she followed Luna through the Hallways she realized where they were headed.
Sitting alone on the corridor of the dungeons just outside of the Potions classroom was Marius. His white-blonde hair was seen easily in the dark corridors of the night only lighted by the torches. He was already reading through their book in potions the only subject he has with the Sixth years, when he heard footsteps getting near his location. Thinking that it was already Neville and the others he dusted his clothes and picked up his book.
Draco pointed his forefinger to the bracelet on his wrist and Orion immediately hid it.
away along with the coffin.
Draco cradled his wrist. He then casted a spell to find out what was the origin of the Dark Mark. As soon as he touched it, he drew his hands away at the extreme malice and darkness the Mark had.
Orion shook his head. “You don’t understand. Mother… She did something to Corvus. He would never be able to leave her side. You and I both know Draco would not be able to bear to leave one of his children here.”
Severus turned to them, huffing out a tired breath. “Why don’t we ask him on what he intends after learning all this?”
Hey guys! I apologize for the long wait, this chap was supposed to be posted a few weeks ago but RL has been a pain and I have been on a downward spiral lately. Anyway I hope you guys are doing well. I hope you enjoy and I would love to hear your thoughts about it.
“You will regret renouncing your claim, Miss Chang,” she said before she could floo away.
“Yes. The previous Elder, Lucius, ordered Dumbledore to assist the werewolves in the First Mystic War and that was the reason why we followed. But now, almost all of the Order is scattered and fled this country. Only the Notts and Parkinsons are left by Dumbledore’s side.” Blaise did his best to explain it to Marius who was a very inquisitive person.
Their eyes found the three still hunched together, making sure every moment and second count.
"Marius, despite not being the Elder of the Slytherins, I know what happens around here."
Bellatrix’s eyes glanced at his son and Orion shook his head. “Now, come along, my darling. We have to present these children for our Lord.” She began to walk away, followed by Severus who remained quiet and Orion after giving Draco a final glance, as he was now unconscious. The door was closed and locked by several witches to prevent Draco form ever attempting to escape.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Granger, the reason why you thought that Chang suddenly disappeared was this.” Theo then began to press his finger to the wall and as soon as it touched the wall, it rippled like water disturbed. That was then that Hermione realized Chang placed a charm to make the passageway look like a wall, but it was only covered up by a Mirror-Water Charm.
Without him noticing, his eyes began to wander toward the Slytherin table, but the usual platinum blonde hair next to Nott and the others was nowhere in sight. He also noticed that Lestrange was not present though they all knew the reason for that. The Dark Mark had been bugging him like hell and it was draining his energy fast due to the pain that it brought forth.
Draco's lips trembled as he could not believe what Harry just told him. Without him knowing it, a single tear escaped his eye and Harry looked like he was stricken. His face once full of happiness now full of worry and as if he was hurt.
“When?” Bellatrix demanded.
“Headmaster”
Dumbledore could not help himself from feeling faint. Remus had to hold the old vampire and allow him to sit at one of the chairs as he sagged. Sirius looked at Lily as if she knows something that could help piece together what Narcissa had said to him.
to himself.
There was teasing tone on the way Orion said his name that made Marius easily obliged him and so, he walked side-by-side with Orion to the Slytherin table. Some spluttered their drink. The Vampires were all gaping and eyes huge, meanwhile Orion ignored all of them.
They soon reached the Slytherin Table and as always, no one sat at the usual seat of Orion and the others; a huge space was left open for them. Orion took his seat. Next to him was Marius and in front of them sat Theo, Blaise, and Pansy.
"It will be faster if I came along,” Blaise replied.
“I want him, Bella. I give you my permission to do whatever it takes and bring him to me. Alive.” His voice was commanding.
Wordlessly he casted another spell from his wand and the rubbles that were atop of all of them were raised and removed from their person’s. Shock was an understatement from what she had just witnessed. The child wielded the wand flawlessly and his control of magic would put her to shame as he wasted no effort.
“Now this is where we will know if you are a fake or not, for only those of Black Blood can open this vault”, Ragnok explained to Draco and he merely nodded then Griphook handed him a small silver knife.
Harry froze. "What?" He could barely whisper. Orion was back to pacing the floor, his teeth gritting. "What do you mean by that?"
“Shall we proceed inside?” Albus began to voice out.
hey guys! wow 880 kudos?? i just cant believe it! thank you guys, really this means a lot to me... i know i said i was gonna go on a hiatus, but due to some circumstances, here i am giving you guys an update! im not sure when the next update will be since i write as i go and when i find time to write..i hope you guys are all doing well :)

Orion’s eyes sharpened at that. It looked like he needed to fully warn Potter to stay away from Marius. He wouldn’t allow his cousin to get hurt when the bastard finally found his mate.
Narcissa closed her eyes. They looked heavy as she nodded her head. The old woman then helped her to walk back to her room.
“How were you able to sway from complete submission to the Dark Lord?” Minerva began to ask her voice unwavering and Severus scowled at her.
Ron nodded before heading out to inform the others.
“It’s fine, Weasley. You would do the same had you been the one to see her, right?”
Her eyes then returned back to their original shade of brown. She bowed her head in apology and
Theo nodded. His eyes looking at Marius pointedly before he peeked at Orion who remained quiet the whole time. "Yes, and because of that, he cannot force nor order any Vampires other than those who are marked by him to join him in his cause."
Marius looked up at that. Driven by pure shock, probably, but Harry’s hand remained on his cheek as they both stared at each other, stunned.
Harry just chuckled, clearly amused. “So, who is currently winning in your tug of war?” Harry patted Ron as he grumbled under his breath.
Every pair of eyes snapped to Cho’s direction as she stood up and the High Witch now began to glare at her.
"I need blood. I-I can't stop it,” he said.
"Because I saw the Malfoy Family Tree. His date of birth and death was written there before the Dark Lord asked my Mother to burn the Malfoy Family tree in the old Malfoy Manor.”
Harry looked a bit taken aback, expecting Ron to protest. Ron seemed to have understood this and so he began to explain. “Look, I can understand him a bit. His mate, his life, and the Headmaster's life are on the line. Besides if he were to try to kill the Headmaster for real, we have the highest possibility that we can stop him before he could execute it. So, it’s like killing two birds with one stone because whether we agree or not, we still gained something from it.”
Hermione thought hard on what Chang has said.
“The Grimoire, no longer lies here”, Nymphadora’s eyes flared and she swirled her wand and a vibration like aura smoothed through the whole Chamber.
"Is that—" James began and Dumbledore could only nod.
see you again next time:))
Orion shook his head in apology. “The Dark Lord got them all. Every single one of the Malfoys.”
He had never seen the ever poised and gifted witch of Ravenclaw that vulnerable but then again, he was not looking so cool either. He heaved in a deep breath and it became slightly hard to exhale as he could feel the wound he had a while ago. He was sporting a huge blue bruise just below his ribs.
When Professor Snape shouted at them he turned back to his potion, he was already so distracted for the day that he did not notice that he was about to place more than the said amount of Valerian root. A hand stopped him from putting the Valerian root to his cauldron and he snapped his head only to see the human doing so.
“Fawkes,” he called.
“No. The house was burned by magic,” Penelope Clearwater said and Andromeda’s eyes glared at the girl.
“No. I, Cho Chang, renounce my right as Heir to the High Witch’s throne of Ravenclaw.” A magical binding contract broke and dissipated into thin air as the mark on her shoulder disappeared.
I hope everyone is doing well during these days, i apologize for being gone for quite a long time, i hope you enjoy this chapter as i did writing it.
“I can’t just trust your word about Lestrange, Marius. Despite me seeing that he has changed, it still does not erase the past that I have with him.”
“I see. Well, I think you should apologize, Harry,” Fred stated after he heard the entirety of Harry’s story which earned him a confused look.
Hermione respected that so she pulled Ron and Harry. She could not pull Orion away as she felt like the Vampire would not like that.
Inside the room, Neville and Blaise were, finally, alone now. The tension was thick and the werewolf could hear his own beating heart. When he tried to look up at Blaise, he noticed that Blaise's heartbeat was normal and this made him even more anxious.
"What?" he said calmly and chanting ‘
He looked down in fear that that blood might be Harry's, but then when he looked down the corpse was no longer there. The other him smiled at him. He was offered a hand to stand up. Shaking, Draco tentatively took it.
“Yes, it truly is beautiful,” Harry voiced out even though his eyes never once strayed away from Marius. No one of them wanted to break the trance that they were in. But then, something screamed at the back of Marius’ head reminding him of the reason why he was there to speak with Harry in the first place. He opted to look away once again.
“Why don’t you tell him?” he asked softly.
At a dark alcove a few rooms from the kitchen, a witch stood in front of an elf that looked to have been under a curse. The elf’s body was seemingly swaying, losing its balance bit by bit. As soon as the witch waved her wand, the elf stiffened and began to shakily open her hand palm up as if she was about to receive something. A vial of clear liquid inside was put upon it soon after.
Harry was cautious at first, but when the stranger smiled, it was as if all the tension that he was feeling all faded away as he grinned back.
“Severus,” Lily’s soft voice rang as the surly man merely nodded at them. As soon as he took a step forward, he was swiftly surrounded by five wolves and witches directing their wands right at him.
Draco nodded before he continued on with their previous conversation. "Anyway, he tried to absorb everything. But my magic is sealed, so the only magic he took was what I released. He drained it all like a sponge and it dissipated in the air."
“Now shall we begin?”, and when Theo and Blaise sat together, Marius made a tutting noise.
Harry clasped a hand on his shoulder. "I will try and help you, mate." He comforted the other and then they began to try and make the potion that Snape told them to do.
"I cannot ask him nor force him to fight a war that his mother never wanted him to participate in. Just by the way that Narcissa hid her pregnancy from all of us I could understand why she would not want his son to be born to fight a war she could not win. He has his own choice and whatever it is, I am willing to accept it", Remus and Molly nodded at this. They understood as Narcissa had given up too much for them to win the previous war.
“Pansy.” Her eyes snapped to him before he then spoke to Hermione once again. “I have already given Potter enough time with Marius. In that state of his, even if the Dark Lord were to attack Hogwarts, he would not wake up.”
His sneer turned even more deadly. “Ah, but I do know the spell. Legilimency, isn’t it? And if Professor would wish to view my memories on a Pensive, the spell would be—“
“Oh, I see.” He waved his hand at Moaning Myrtle’s direction.
“This is like the Room of Requirement.”
It was later, after ensuring Theo watched over the sleeping couple in the Requirement Room, that Marius found himself heading towards Professor McGonagall’s office to pass his essay on Vampire and Werewolf studies. Since that was the only subject he did not have with his classmates, Dumbledore decided that Professor McGonagall would be the one to teach him.
“Well, I leave you to whatever it is that you plan to do,” he turned back but before he could walk away a line of light appeared in front of him. His eyes followed this to see that it was a circle surrounding all four of them. Severus’ eyes found those icy blue eyes that seem to understand his whole being and asked.
“I am not. I’m what the Chamber conjured from what you desire to take from this Chamber.” She smiled at the four of them but then her eyes landed upon Marius and her eyes narrowed.
"Ah, Avada Kedavra", this made Harry look back at him when he was about to leave, trying to confirm what he heard he took a step closer.
“You don’t know how huge this honour is Nephew. I am so proud of you,” she said with a smile and Draco could almost puke.
Their eyes met and Lovegood gave him a weird look that Marius did not understand. Her eyes looked around before settling on Ginny. The Weasley came forward and with a small smile on her face, greeted her.
"Will you be there?" Harry asked between sniffles.
“What? It seemed like the right thing to do”, Ginny ignored the idiot not after she rolled her eyes and directed a glare to Luna, no, the one possessing her body.
Orion’s eyes widened. Having his hunger gone, now he realized what had happened. His face turned deadly and when he was about to strangle the human, a huge wave of pain shot to his hand.
As Draco’s tears fell down his cheek, Harry’s control broke out and he lost control. A roar was reverberated within the Great Hall as Harry’s body transformed into a huge black wolf, his eyes red with rage as swatted the other witches and werewolves out of his way to charge towards the barrier dome to get to his mate.
They all knew they had to do it soon. The mark on Orion’s hand had begun to hurt him more and more as the days passed. The Dark Lord was getting impatient and he was demanding results. They had to do it before Christmas break.
“Indeed. If Bellatrix were to find this out, she would not kill Draco. No. She would turn him to their side and you know how she will do it.” Sirius was standing up from his seat now. His fists were clenched.
“Until they were lately awakened—“ Hermione then abruptly stood up and began to take out a few parchments with notes in them and opened up books about the Familiars.
“I have never seen him back down, never. He always fought with Gryffs, but one word from Mari and he stopped”, he then stared at Theo who was as puzzled as him.
Dumbledore ruefully smiled. “I hope—“
"Looking for you." The stranger then began to sit on his swing and that was then that Harry noticed his bleeding hand. Without him thinking, he rushed to the stranger's side and held his hand on his small ones.
Before Blaise could go, a voice echoed in the silence of the Hall.
“Leave wounded animals to me,” he grinned.
he thought as he heaved in a breath to cover it all up.
Ragnok and Griphook looked at one another in silent conversation they both knew of what will happen should they succeed, but when the boy looked at them with tired pleading eyes they both nodded and accepted.
At this, his fangs flashing and the thought of Lestrange sinking his fangs into the pale neck of Marius made Harry’s blood boil. Without any warning, he pinned Lestrange to the wall. Lestrange seemed unfazed by this and he even looked like he was expecting it.
Hermione was also experiencing a mixture of feelings from what she saw before in the Chamber. It showed her things about the Dark Lord that they had never known about even though she still couldn’t understand what the spirit meant by telling her about the Dark Lord’s ‘chains of power’ that they had to break somehow.
Draco shook his head.
Harry who chose him not because he was a Black, but because he was his mate,
“But I am sure as hell he somehow borrowed my Mother’s power to create something. I don’t know what, but when the Dark Lord was sealed, my mother and the others who scattered did their hardest to search where he was sealed.”
Of course Ron was shocked. His eyes darted back and forth from Marius to his alpha. He sighed. He could understand why they had to do it; they could gain a lot from this plan and lose nothing at all.
He turned back at Orion who was now opening the chess board and fixing up the pieces for him to play.
“Unfortunately, Mr. Potter you just woke up, after you are cleared by the Head Healer. You cannot leave.”, after that she left him alone in the room with not knowing where, or what happened to Ron.
“Come on, cousin. Close off this wound, will you?”
Charlie then plucked a vial containing soil from his pocket and handed it to Penelope who gave it to Andromeda.
Marius shook his head and Orion released a very heavy sigh as he slumped on the couch. “You could have just said so instead of wording it to something so insane,” he grumbled, eyes closing tiredly.
"Wait. Where are you going?"
“She gave me a mission,” he said and with that, the tension was back again. With baited breath, he blurted out, “I have to kill Dumbledore.”
Lily turned to Dumbledore with worried eyes. "Albus, what about the Order? Would they be willing to help us this time?"
Her voice was soft and hold a tinge of concern as her eyes tell it all. Harry could do nothing but remain in his seat and look down, guiltily. “Do you remember the night after I went berserk?” Hermione nodded her head and he continued. “He was there Hermione, that night I attacked him, and god knows what would have happened if Orion or the Headmaster was not there.”
“What happened?” Harry asked as soon as they were in another less crowded hallway, but Marius ignored his question. He opted to turn to Ron and began handing Lovegood to him.
He heaved a huge sigh as he sat down on his chair and fixed the curtains. Done with making sure everything was in place like before, he then began humming a tune his mother did when he was young, all the while picking his book once again and continued reading.
“What do you think Andromeda?” James asked and she looked in thought.
“What about Draco?” Orion asked.
“Shit.” Orion closed his hand like a fist. He felt his powerlessness overwhelming him as blood dripped from his hand. He felt the child stir. While making sure he wouldn’t wake, Orion carried the boy to his quarters.
Breakfast was in full swing the following morning.
“You swear?”
"What's wrong?" Theo asked worriedly.
“Thank you, Blaise.” Neville hugged the Vampire so closely and snuggled his head at the nape of his neck where Blaise’s scent was so prominent. They stayed that way until the sun went down and Neville needed to lock up the place.
“Now, Potter, answer me. Why are you looking for Draco?”
“And if I were to save him, I have to keep my promise to Father.”
“You were probably thinking that if you left the Dark witches alone the others would also do the same. But have you seen it? Most witches being brought to the hospital wing are Dark witches. I have only been here for a few days and I have already noticed. Just how blind are you?” he hissed venomously.
"Do you like Parkinson?"
“So, why is the son of Narcissa Black roaming the world as a human?” Rowena sipped on her tea as if it was the most natural thing to do.
The voice died in Draco's throat once he heard those words. He was left stunned, his eyes wide and unbelieving.
The tone was sarcastic and Bella showed no fear as she stared back at her Lord, sealed by the blood of her enemies and her sister’s magic.
“You’re right, Potter. Don’t you think so, Weasley?” Pansy said as she smirked. She wallowed in a win as Ron swallowed and looked away, blushing yet again. Then Marius saw the way Harry looked at Blaise and Neville and he could see the longing he had—
Orion glanced out of the corner his eyes at Marius. He was sure that wherever this led to, Marius had to reveal himself to them to clear everything up.
He didn’t wait for them to answer as he ran at his own pace as well to the hospital, again, leaving the Granger and the werewolf standing behind for exactly two seconds before the both of them quickly caught up to him.
Her daughter’s eyes widened at this. Merlin was said to be the most powerful witch in the ancient times, second to none. Though her Aunt Narcissa was said to be stronger than her knowing this, makes her think that Merlin was stronger than Narcissa.
“What is it?”, his voice was laced with concern.
Harry stopped pacing and Ron turned towards her.
"Narcissa Black, born from the First Witch’s bloodline and hailed as the most powerful witch ever to be born. Her sister Lady Andromeda Tonks nee Black is currently the High witch while Bellatrix Black sided with the Vampires and began the war. She remained neutral never siding with any faction. She was feared, but as soon as the war ended she disappeared, never to be found."
Hermione understood his silent words and instead gestured to the other seating around her. “Take a seat you two. You will need it.”
Marius' eyes snapped back to meet his and they were now different than the one Harry saw a while ago. Those silver eyes turned more steel-like and serious.
“Meaning as long as her child lives the barrier of those damned wolves will still be on effect as it is a Blood Ward”, then she smirked looking at the blood once more.
Theo tutted at him. His index finger waving in front of Marius. "You don't know Blaise like I do."
He then stopped laughing and he placed his hand on Theo’s shoulder. When the Vampire looked up at him confusedly, he replied, “Of course you will soon. I’m sure of that, Theo.”
Ginny raised her wand, about to cast a spell towards her brother, but then Draco stood in front of her.
His silver eyes found blue ones and the woman gave a smile that Marius was so familiar with, the smile that brought dagger’s to his heart because of how much he missed it.
Ron followed after him, saying, “You like him.”
he replied as he then began to act normally as he ate his meal. His stomach churned as he felt like ditching the plan and instead head on to Draco’s side.
about you, true. I don’t know much either, but I do know I am not wrong about what I’ve told you before and that is why I think I should tell you I want to create a place for you to belong.” He then stood up before dusting himself. All the while, Orion stared at him as if he was giving him the biggest joke he had ever heard and so, the vampire laughed whole-heartedly.
“I just hope that we will be safe wherever we end up”, he gave a grim smile and picked up his luggage and began to walk away. Remembering his Mother’s last words he looked back at the small hut where he and his mother lived together.
“Yes, my lady” Ginny could not stop herself from spluttering and Theo turned his head back to her, his index finger held up in his lips, signalling her to be quiet his eyes twinkling with mirth.
He was cut off when he felt his cold body engulfed with such warmness that his eyes widened, a gasp released from his mouth. Harry held him so tightly his head tucked on the crook of his neck as one arm around his waist whilst the other one caressing his head.
He kissed their forehead and continued to whisper the broken protection spell he wasn’t able to cast on them when they took them away from him. The magic settled to them and he whispered to them both as many times as he can to remind them, to assure them, to make them never forget just how much he loved them.
“Gin”, Theo began to voice out and Ginny was about to snap at him for ruining her concentration but when she looked toward him, his eyes wide as he stared at Luna. Luna who looked like she was struggling and Nymphadora’s voice strained as she struggled.
"Sorry about that. Are you alright?" she gave a small smile and Marius nodded his head, still catching his breath.
Blaise then leaned in.
“I never wanted to be a leader who will only be in that position because of power. I want to be a leader that one can get along with and help those in need. One who will protect her fellow witches despite their differences in magic. That is who I wanted to be. The reason why I left the dark witches alone was because I thought it would be good for them.” She once again shook her head as she remembered the human’s words that day at the Infirmary. “I was wrong though, and because of that, I have failed you. All of you.”
He turned his head towards Harry. He could see him growling at Remus and his brothers who were trying to stop him from continually hurting himself while trying to break Bellatrix’s hella tough barrier.
“What is it?”
"We are your light and darkness, the manifestation of your power. You are just the one that stands in between. One that balances your light and dark sides, the one that commands us. But that day, you made us all—one."
Maybe it was the stone-hard confidence Marius showed with those words, or maybe, secretly, Orion was grateful for the boy. Either way, the vampire decided on what to do. He took a deep breath, inhaling the smell of Marius’ non-existent scent, before he sank his teeth.
Harry realized that the figure was using the mind-link to their comrades to speak for them, and he gritted his teeth at this. “What too cowardly to even speak to us?”
Orion turned around. There he saw
Harry grunted and before Marius could say any more, Harry blurted out. "I'm sorry."
“Tears do not fit you, Marius.” Even his voice sounded so soothing, so calming. Only his mother ever managed to sound that caring of him before. “Try smiling again, will you? That works better.”
James looked uneasy. He turned to Lily for her opinion but she looked as if in conflict with herself. He then turned to Sirius who looked pained but he nodded his head. "Remus, order Charlie to bring Narcissa's body here and properly please," he said. Remus bowed before he left along with Percy and his mate Penelope.
Belated Happy Halloween? hope you guys enjoyed your evening!
“Forgive me, Luna. I could not protect you,” he voiced out to his daughter and the blonde shook her head in his chest as she slowly eased herself to look at her Father’s face.
“That still did not change the fact that you are as dark as me. Your hands are soaked in blood the same as mine.” Bellatrix cast a spell that Draco easily felled away with a flick of his hand.
"We could win this war," Sirius said. All eyes fell on him, questioning but he looked up with a grin on his lips, "with Narcissa's grimoire or I should call it
“Then I will do whatever it is in my power to never let him go”
“For what?”
“Ginny will not be pleased if she was not informed of this.” Hermione looked toward Marius before she gave the final order to her Patronus.
She noticed that her barrier had small cracks in them.
“Dra—“ He was easily cut off by Draco’s voice.
“Lucifer?”, Luna nodded at this, Lucifer only bows to Black blood. Ginny’s eyes widened at this, with two familiars by their side they could easily launch attacks at them without any reserves and the main army of the Dark Lord would not even have to move for that to happen.
He realized how vulnerable he had been in the past circumstances, not being able to do anything else as a human. But being human for the time being is better than being hunted like an animal everywhere he goes.
Molly then gestured for Albus to follow her as they both walked towards the office of James Potter. She knocked on the door and soon they both heard a voice telling them to enter. The door opened to reveal Lily sitting at one of the couches near the bookshelves, her hands folded on top of a book. Sirius seated next to her while Beta Remus stood near the large mahogany table where James' hands were clasped.
“Luna?”, Hermione voiced out in the silence of the previously glorious Great Hall. All were waiting on what the blonde girl was about to say, but she just looked up her expression blank and there was a twinkle of mischievousness within her eyes that Hermione could not place. Suddenly the blonde girl held her head with both of her hands and her face scrunched up as she grunted in pain. Her body was shivering then when she looked up, her eyes were full of utter despair and regret.
“Leviathan.” Luna’s voice rang strong and clear and the basilisk looked down at her and with a wave of her hand, the snake then began to lower its head. “Good boy.” She smiled as she patted the snake, his eyes then close as the power of his petrification now seemingly sealed.
“Bellatrix?”, Hermione’s eyes widened, long-distance spells are dangerous and it could cause damage to the witch’s body. She was one of the other allies of the Dark Lord that suddenly disappeared, some Aurors have been hunting her for years but still she was good at hiding.
“Sneaky attacks are no fair, Potter Jr.”, a flash of teeth appeared from the lips of one Barty Crouch Jr. Behind him were cloaked figures, composed of witches and wolves.
“Answer me livestock!”, his voice boomed in the empty corridors and Marius croaked out.
Her thoughts then drifted to Orion, at how similar their positions were but then she shook her head. Marius. She knew when she was in the infirmary. She felt the power, the magic of the human male. So similar to Nymphadora yet so kind, so gentle. Unlike hers. Something she had never felt before. It was powerful like a heartbeat.
to my Beta Authlene thank you for everything!XD
“Izzy why are you here?”
"Impossible." Lily's voice breathed out. All eyes in the room fell to her as she eased away from the arms of her husband and slowly approached the hologram of Narcissa that stood as if waiting. But before she could explain, the hologram slowly dissipated and her last words were heard.
“What did you do to me?”
“No it says here that she was a squib who decided to live in the muggle realm”, Hermione looked up at the photo and the statement of the woman who last saw Regulus Black.
Orion’s eyes landed on the center of attention before they met Marius unwavering gaze. Within second, he was already standing feet away from the human. He closed his eyes as he savored the smell of blood in the air and when he opened his eyes, it was swirling blue with a hint of it turning red.
Orion nodded, eyes closed as those horrible memories clouded up his whole being. He clutched on his cousin’s hand who acted as his only anchor now when his head was trying to rip him apart once again.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Are you telling me that seven of them were killed by this black thing in their veins?”, Hermione nodded and she exhaled.
He was walking along the corridors outside of Hogwarts when he saw it, a scene that he was sure will haunt his mind even after he found sleep.
“I’m sorry Izzy, you startled me”
Ginny only smiled at him and took the seat that he occupied a while ago.
She was about to ask something, but Ron cut her off as if indirectly telling her if her question was about Harry, the other werewolf would be fine in some time. They had to discuss other things. “So, what exactly did you see in the Chamber, Mione?”
Before he could land an attack towards Bellatrix he saw a flash of grin from the woman and he was thrown across to hit one of the columns. His body ached at the impact but his wounds were already healing, Hermione was in front of her as she pointed her wand.
Harry’s eyes widened when he saw the small and brief smile that the human gave to Neville and he finally saw the human’s eyes for the first time. They were liquid silver, but when he blinked it hardened to that of a stormy grey. It was fascinating how easily it changed along with his demeanor, and the way he manipulated Snape to let him borrow five cauldrons for him to use.
“This Mark is our proof that we are Heirs to the throne of Ravenclaw,” she said then.
“Besides this is near the Vampire’s lair, wouldn’t want the Human loving blood traitor of a Headmaster to be saddened by your loss would we?”, as he hissed and bared his fangs, but the human Clarke merely looked at him with eyes that pierced him, Marius looked at him like he was seeing the real him underneath.
“—the two—“ and George continued.
It was now Hermione’s turn to be confused and seeing this, the younger Narcissa who looked like a ghost began to explain. “The Chamber can see through your memories as soon as you entered this room, all in order to ascertain that if you ever were to be able to take a book from this place, it would not be used to evil. The Room also takes the form of anyone you ever desire.”
Marius’ ears perked up at this. “I have read things about rare Vampires who can view memories when drinking blood, but I never thought you are one.” When he offered Orion his blood, Draco could only guess his cover would be blown up because the vampire would recognize the similarity of their blood, being family and all that. He definitely didn’t think his memories were being read too.
As if having its own mind, his hand found Harry’s cheek. The wolf’s expression changed again after that. Surprise made Harry’s eyes widened slightly before he leaned his head to Marius’ hand.
When he looked up, it was to see Harry who had an odd expression on his face, like a bit of mixed worry and confusion. It made Marius wondered why he looked like that.
"I think it was because Rowena Ravenclaw thought it would be wise for us to learn from past mistakes and not to redo them in our time. And because the Black Family was instructed to assure that none of these Grimoires to ever be awakened or used, and look where that brought us." Sirius scoffed as if mocking but there was sadness in his eyes.
Marius was then suddenly tugged toward the bed. His face, hands, arms, and body subjected to the inspection of one Harry Potter.
“There is none. I hate to part with it, but I am sure my Mother would’ve wanted it to protect others than to stay with me as a mere reminder of her.” Dumbledore wanted to protest at that, but Draco did not allow him to say anything any longer as he continued to speak. “The Barrier will never fall for as long as I live unless there would be someone who would be more powerful than me to break it.” Draco sounded as if he was joking, but Dumbledore knew that Draco had no par when it comes to his magic.
Luna wanted to shiver at the thought, her mind reeling to reject that idea but showing it to her would only make it worse, so she buried it all underneath the deepest depths of her mind.
Luna swallowed. She knew the consequences of that portal. In order to accomplish it, one witch must be within the blood ward and the one outside must perform the same ritual at the same time. It had the same concept as summoning a demon but her mother changed its properties to become a portal instead. However, the Portal was never a success because those who entered the portal reach the inside of the Blood Ward as a corpse. The only person who was able to live through it was her mother and she was sufficient to take down this castle.
The werewolf’s eyes widened. He looked around him to see if there were anyone injured in the incident.
The four moved closer to each other, their wands were drawn except for Marius, as they wait for whomever was that spoke to come out.
“Please, call me Lily. We all had been comrades in the past war.”
“Swear to me that no one else will know.”
was the question Dumbledore soon answered as if it was the real question Draco asked.
Ginny then relaxed as if understanding. Her hands were lowered to her side from their previous crossed position over her chest and she felt a sense of happiness knowing that she would get to find him soon.
Luna stopped her body from shivering to the cold touch of the woman as she swallowed and let her face remain blank and emotionless. Nymphadora regarded her with eyes proud and truly happy that left Luna's blood to run cold. She knew her Master was planning something when she asked her to summon her in Hogwarts.
Harry seemed to have noticed his mistake as he then he unconsciously growled at the vampire, causing Marius to stir. Harry looked like he was about to panic, but Orion took pity on him and began to crouch down in front of them and he began to pick Marius up.
“Yes”
“Then that just makes him more of my enemy, Marius! That witch was the one who destroyed countless lives, Marius, and you are asking me to trust Orion.”
Marius smiled. His fingers unconsciously tracing the blank space. “We have to tell this to the others.”
Harry finally reached the Hufflepuff’s Common Room. He rushed to Draco’s quarters only to see what looked like runes at one side of the room engraved on the floor. He felt Draco clutching his robes and so he looked down at him to hear his soft voice.
Harry released a huge sigh of relief. Before Marius knew it, he was engulfed in warmth. Harry was nuzzling his hair as his palm ruffled it up.
Orion's face seemed to spark with amusement at that, his previous hostility gone.
"But after that, I will be gone."
As he opened his eyes  all he saw was a large and beautiful circular room, full of funny little noises. The walls were covered with portraits of old headmasters and headmistresses, all of whom were snoozing gently in their frames. There was also an enormous, claw-footed desk, and, sitting on a shelf behind it, a shabby, tainted wizard's hat. On the table was a bowl full of what seemed to be sweets, he was looking around when he saw what he thought to be a bird but when he looked closely, his eyebrows raised and he saw a phoenix.
He was in the Hospital Wing. The curtains were drawn to his bed and he could not hear anything as he figured a silencing spell was put up. But as he paid attention to the inside of his curtains, he could hear some one’s soft breathing. He lifted his head for a bit, only to see platinum hair just near his hip. Marius was sleeping soundly, his head resting on his side of the bed and his face facing his direction.
Luna looked up at him, eyes worried. He just clutched her hand in reassurance. Soon he yawned, feeling the tiredness all of a sudden. Luna tucked him in as she voiced out softly. "Don't worry, Marius. Your secret is safe with me." She gave him a smile and he could not help but see the tiny glint of something in her eyes but he could not place what it was as he once again fell into a deep slumber.
Hermione decided to seat herself beside Ron which made Parkinson’s eye twitched a bit. The female vampire then began to move. She sat right next to Marius, crossing her legs along with her hands as she leaned on the back of the couch.
Marius released a weary sigh as soon as Madame Pomphrey was already inside the confines of her office. Thinking about the events before, Marius almost lost his cool when he knew his magic almost ran amok in order to protect him. Good thing the necklace was too strong enough to stop it from happening. Had a large amount of magic been released, they could all easily found him and he would need to flee someplace else.
Marius looked back at Hermione. “Ready?”
Dumbledore nodded. “I will do what I can to find out more. But for now, you all need to rest." He then looked straight at Marius. “Mr. Clarke would you please stay behind.” At this, Orion, who was about to stand up, stayed in his seat instead along with the others. Dumbledore noticed this so he continued. “Alone.”
He tried to remember the feel of the magic, but it made him shiver. His good mood in showering was disrupted, so he turned off the faucet took his bathrobe and towel.
“Thank me later. For now, deal with Blaise. After class, I already signaled Theo to not let you slip away,” he ended his sentence with a wink before skipping a step to the seat next to Orion as if he was rightfully seated there.
Orion sat on the bed facing him and with a serious face he said, "Tell me."
"That he was struggling and having fears upon fighting the Dark Lord?" His eyes glanced Harry who was asleep.
“Is there something the matter?” Dumbledore began to ask.
“It is the rose that only blooms once every thousand years. I had my mother encase it in a stasis spell so it won’t ever wilt.”
“You do not want the world to know of your existence?”, Draco nodded.
"Tsk! No wonder that bastard needs to place the Dark Mark on his followers."
“You are?”, Elmore voiced out as she then began to grab at one of the umbrella’s in the stand where they were placed and the woman that Elmore knew as one of her close friends smiled at her.
Hermione resisted the urge to face palm herself and Harry looked at Ron, startled.
“Help me sit up”, when Ron did not move she glared at him and hissed. “Now!”
“When that time comes—“
“I will come back for that wizard!”, the monster shrieked at Ron before disappearing from thin air and Harry could not help the sigh that escaped his lips. He then turned back to look at Penny Elmore whose now slumped on the ground and rushed to her side.
They left Hermione to have a few minutes of sleep since they both knew she hasn’t had any decent sleep since the other day. Harry casted a charm to the living room where Hermione was passed out and waved a blanket to her tired form.
"Didn't you eat?" Clarke said lightly and Orion chuckled at this, bitterly.
Only Harry, Ron, Hermione and Orion were present. They were the representatives since they did not want to hound the Headmaster with their whole group.
“No one knows what Young Draco looks like”
Morning came and the bright rays of the sunlight were the first thing that awakened Marius from his deep slumber. The Dreamless sleep he took worked perfectly fine as he felt his body well rested despite of what just occurred to him last night. He abruptly woke up when a sudden pop echoed in the room, making him alert and grap the dagger he kept under his pillow and pointed it to the creature’s throat.
The Dark Lord grinned at this. His red eyes shining with mirth. “I leave them in your care Severus.”
“Can you just give up and show us the information? Do you know how hard it is to hold back and not break your frail sword?”, The woman who Agravain no longer knew played with her as she parried on her blows as much as she can.
“Wait, what?” Hermione was then confused.
Luna's eyes flashed darkly before she stood up, flicking her hand to erase the evidence of the spell that was cast along with some dust on her clothes. She tested the body by closing and opening her palm and a wicked grin appeared on her features.
“Who would’ve thought that after looking for you all this time, you would wound up straight to my arms.” A wicked smile graced Nymphadora within Luna’s body as she cradled the fallen blond in her arms.
“I am not your goddamn blood hound.”
“Stay here Beau I will be right back”, the dog whimpered but followed his order. They all rode the cart and it took them a while before they reached their destination. The cart came to a halt in front of a huge stony wall that seemed to be the entrance of the vault.
To Authlene my beta thank you again for everything!XD
“Wha-what!?”, then grey eyes stared at him as if he said something wrong.
“Indeed, maybe we can arrange for you to stay in Ravenclaw land? I have heard your mate is a witch you might find her there?”, she beamed at him then Harry thought hard then replied.
“—before I change my mind and rip you to shreds.”, then he leaned back and stared at those grey eyes that seem to be showing nothing.
“In doing that, Slytherin will not touch a hair on him unless they wish to answer to me," Lestrange explained as if talking to a child.
Hermione could not help the quirk of her lips.
—and Draco woke up with a start.
hope you enjoy!
Andromeda was about to begin speaking once again when Albus stepped in.
Ginny was still avoiding her and kept to herself. She had to see what was happening inside the walls of Ravenclaw without anyone knowing. Some of the Dark Witches seem to have raised their eyebrows at her sudden care towards one of them and the Light Witches found her actions unusual. She decided to keep a closer and keen eye from now on and if she truly wanted to know the truth, she had to act normal in order not to spook anyone of them.
“What is it then?” he yielded. Those eyes, he cannot refuse.
“This concerns the matter that you owe me.”
“Thanks”
Ron watched as the figure seemingly cracking his neck. His body posture was looking as if he was preparing for something. He then decided to stand in front of his path. He unclenched his palms and elongated his claws, crouched ready to face the figure. There was a still calmness between the two of them watching to see if who among them would make the first move to attack. As he blinked, he saw that the figure was no longer in front of him. When he turned his face in search, he suddenly felt a stab on his stomach.
“Since our High Witch lost her daughter, there was no one to inherit the throne after her. That’s why she chose amongst all of us. I was one along with Cho Chang but since she renounced her claim, I am the only Heir other than her daughter.”
He closed his eyes as he relished this moment that he knew he would never have with Marius as the human was still mad at him. And at that moment, Harry wished that time would stop and allow this to last for as long as he wants. That Marius would be by his side, to smile at him with his innocence and watch him with those silver eyes that are full of life. And so Harry wished.
Marius nodded. Hermione was then scouring her thoughts for any information about the Chamber.
Harry's blood ran cold. His body shook as he felt everything they had planned is about to fall. He combed his hair as he began to pace. When he stopped, he looked at Orion straight in the eyes. "Do we have the time to execute the plan to prevent her from arriving?"
“We refuse to serve a Lord who will bring about the doom of everything,” a Centaur bravely voiced out.
Harry watched his movements and as soon as he noticed that his enemy preferred using his left leg to move around he pounced on him quickly. This caught Barty off guard and he was slashed by his thighs and his cloak torn from him backing away his neck saved from being sliced from his body.
She looked back at her daughter, by her side was the coffin of her sister floating. White, how befitting of Narcissa. She touched the coffin slowly, the dirt banished and where she touched turned black. Her eyes gleaming with excitement, her smile malicious.
“Okay.” Then he began relieving the not-so-joyful experience.
"Then you should make sure that he knows his place and stay away from me," he bumped his shoulder with Potter and went away, heading back to his desk.
Severus walked briskly and quietly as he then opened the door to the Witch Tree’s Chamber. The bright lush green leaves of the tree shone in the dim light. At the bark of the tree, was a seemingly clear cocoon where two children slumbers. Draco was standing still in front of it, watching them for a longer time than necessary.
“Come off it Ron, I mean its not that bad right?”, then Ron grunted so loud.
“What do you mean by that?”
Marius’ ears perked up at this.
“Andromeda, I know of your hate to Dark witches but please, this is not the matter that we currently need to discuss. We need to find Draco.”
Draco looked up at those obsidian eyes and saw nothing but sadness in them despite the smile in their face.
Minerva was cut off from her staring. She coughed to hide her surprise. She, along with the child, followed Dumbledore inside the Great Hall. As soon as they were inside, the door closed and the magic weaved in it assuring that no one would be able to enter.
enjoy~!
“Your little sister is not that little any longer, she is now far stronger that you think she is.”, At that moment Ron saw just how small his sister’s back was, but despite it he could see just how strong she was, her unwavering belief and trust, her loyalty to her friend, that is her brilliance.  It was then that he realized how much his little sister grew, and so he let go and placed his faith in her.
"Don't worry, Longbottom. Blaise won't be the one searching for Marius," drawled someone from behind them. They turned around, only to see Orion walking towards them.
“Avada Kedavra”
all my love
The boy did the mistake to look away from her and Bellatrix clamped her fist and directed it at him. Invisible chains run up throughout his body to constrict his airways and to show just who he belongs to.
Draco just gave him a serene smile and he shook his head. “I am always told of that by Mrs. Clarke whenever I took this form. I understand Professor.”
The old woman seemed to understand and left her alone in the house.
That took the headmaster by surprise. "What do you mean by that?"
“Headmaster this room was not even present in that book my—“, Albus noticed the sudden paused and he watched as Marius easily schooled his features to that of indifference.
“Every Malfoy returns to this place no matter what. This is your legacy. Your blood is tied here and with you, it can rise again.”
"Hi, is something up?" he tilted his head, to look up more properly to the taller werewolf. He stayed indifferent.
Luna—Nymphadora knew never to question her mother.
“Yes. Someone who bears both Light and Dark magic. The Great Witch, Merlin, was one.”
hope you all like it as i did writing every part of it!
Marius nodded as he watched them walk away. He turned back to the rest soon after. “Then, shall we go?”
“Thank you, Lovegood,” he said gratefully as he then began to write a rune for a Blood Protection Ward for himself. Again, as if he was writing on a wall, the runes were written with blood in thin air. It formed a circle. When it was done, it glowed and was then sucked to his necklace, engraved there as if it was there in the first place. Now it would look as if Lovegood was the one who placed the protective charm on him.
Draco’s stomach fell ash he felt like his heart just stopped beating. “Harry!”
“What is wrong?”, asked Rabastan frantic.
Without him thinking of ever knowing what he was doing, he began to run back to the castle Beau following him. This made Ginny and Fred snap back to reality and chase after him.
Soon, the scene was changing as a bright light appeared. Hermione was pulled back to where she first woke up.
“Thank you, Professor,” Chang replied as she bowed her head, facing her two friends and hugging them both.
"My sweet Luna, you have done so well. I am so proud and so happy." Her smile was wide as she stood up and pulled on Luna's hands along with her to make them both standing.
He shook his thoughts away. No, he could not fall at this rate. Harry, his Alpha still needed him. Then a peal of laughter rang within his head. Soon, he released a breath that he did not know he was holding. He gritted his teeth. He held onto his wound. His mind now alerted as a tear began to fall.
“Headmaster is this the Room of Requirement?”, his eyes widened slightly and a grin was beginning to form in his lips.
He could not help but take one last peek to the castle before they are covered by the huge and dark trees of the Forbidden Forest. Fred was whistling as he walked and Ginny remained calm in deep thought, then she began to ask Draco.
“Yeah, why?”
This stunned the Asian girl for some time that Marius almost laughed at her misery.
James tilted his head up. He could not believe that the children have planned this far and they even got the offering of Lestrange's son to be a spy for their side. They were all having mixed feelings about the matter. They were the adults in this case and yet their children were also doing their best to prepare for the upcoming war.
Harry could not deny it as he was about to jump to drag Draco to safety, but a witch’s battle is something he cannot interfere in. He fisted his fist now bleeding at his incapability of not being able to help. His instincts then screamed at him and without him knowing his claws were out and he was set on to attack Bellatrix.
Most of the Dementors were trapped within the barrier but some has escaped and Hermione and the rest of the higher years who were present casted their Patronuses to chase the rest away. McGonagall locked eyes with her signalling them to escape, she nodded her head as she then began to lead the students to safety.
