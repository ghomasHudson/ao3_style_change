‘Pistachio?’ he asks when he reaches Potter at the cart. ‘You’re not serious?’
Ron rolls his eyes again and shakes his head. ‘Bonkers,’ he mutters.
‘There’s no way it was working,’ says Potter. ‘As awesome as that would be, Hermione has told me a thousand times that Muggle technology doesn’t work at Hogwarts.’
‘Sorry chap,’ says Archie, turning to Potter. ‘Best not to get too familiar with Pod. He doesn’t much like it.’
‘Hm. It’s a very good book,’ says Luna. ‘It was my mother’s favourite. She believed every muggleborn should read it. You see, most potions books assume a general knowledge of the wizarding world. This one doesn’t. Hence the erumpents.’
‘Why should I?’
Blaise sighs. Stupid Draco.
When she turns back around, two drinks in hand, she sees that Harry has once again been cornered, this time by a tall, busty brunette Ginny recognises. She sighs and rolls her eyes. Romilda Vane. As vain as her last name implies and as equally vapid. Harry is leaning away from her, looking far more terrified than he has any right to be.
‘Malfoy, for fucks sake you’re paler than a ghost, what
Pansy smirks. ‘I’m whatever you want me to be,’ she says, turning around to lean back on the window, giving him her patented sideways look. ‘Alright, look, I’m not your enemy. I just want you to stop pretending your unconventional relationship with Potter doesn’t affect anyone else. Least of all your closest friends.’
He blinks. ’I’m going to bed,’ he says in a rush and practically disappears before Blaise’s eyes.
His hands tremble, and he clutches at the sheets to keep himself still. His blood is rushing.
Not to mention putting Potter in the mix. The boy attracted trouble no matter where he went. Sending him into the midst of some of the more dangerous (and, yes okay Newt,
Snape’s spell flashes toward him and Harry is frozen.

He sounds like himself again, but Ginny frowns at him as he brushes himself off. He offers her a weak smile.
Green eyes meet his over Malfoy’s shoulder and Harry freezes.
Three months
Well, as okay as he can be when his whole world has done a 180 on him.
‘Alright,’ says Madam Pomfrey, startling them all as she bustles back into the room. ‘That’s long enough. You can all come back tomorrow. Potter needs to rest.’

Draco. Think of Draco.
Bella, of course, doesn’t notice Draco’s mood. After all, she barely knows him—or he her—and besides, Bella has never held that appreciation for the softer side of men and Narcissa is almost grateful that Draco’s own child-like wonder has all but disappeared beneath the surface of his adult self.
‘Merlin Potter, you can’t just go storming up to a bloody

She sighs and rubs at her eyes. Minerva was right. It should have been impossible. Even she had thought the illness a fairy tale. A myth. Something you told children who were misbehaving. And even if it weren’t, it was a malady that only afflicted the strong. The exceptional.
She pats him on the shoulder. ‘I’ll see you in the morning.’
There within lay a jewelled silver necklace. It’s large, and yet finely intricate, each opal set within detailed silver bands, all linked together to form something his mother would love to wear. Not that he’d ever want his mother to wear it.
‘Nymphadora Tonks?’ asks Severus in disbelief. ‘You want to send two of the most volatile students we have, into a volatile,
It’s not working. He can’t do it on his own. He can’t make it work. He needs help. He needs…help…
‘Yes,’ she says. ‘I do. You seem perfectly happy to choose and pick which details of Potter’s schooling Potter’s relatives need to know about. Not that I blame you, mind. They’re the most
After a long moment, in which Malfoy continues to frown at Potter, he finally says, ‘Sure. I’ll have—‘
Draco peers up at him, his arms crossed tight across his wool-clad chest in an apparent attempt to stave off the cold. The beanie and scarf (wrapped twice around his neck) do nothing to reduce the flush of pink across his nose and cheeks that Harry can see even from his second-floor window.
The boy jerks, head snapping around to look at her, grey eyes going wide in shock. ‘Professor,’ he says, as if he hadn’t expected to see her.
She wants to talk it over with Parvati—has, in fact, discussed it at length late at night—but now Parvati, at a table across from her, might as well be in another country, and well, there’s no chance she’s even
She frowns and, trying not to feel hurt by his brusk attitude, follows. ‘Are you okay?’ she asks. ‘Because I can help if—’
He looks at Harry as he says this, the warning clear in his tone. Then he turns, and without even a single glance at Lavender, he storms up the stairs.
She raises her eyebrows at him and gestures to Harry. ‘Didn’t you want to
The boy cries out, spinning to face Harry and trying to get his arm free. Harry clamps down and punches him in the face. Hard.
Malfoy, on the other hand, just looks at him, all quiet and calm. He glances at his so called friends, at Ginny, and then at Ron. He sighs and rolls his eyes.
Severus is too busy glowering at Harry to notice their conversation. His face is set in it's usual disapproval, but Albus can see the underlying bewilderment as the man tries to reconcile the childish tantrum Harry is throwing, with the ridiculous display of furious magic being unleashed upon the school walls.
?’ Harry sputters. ‘Are you fucking kidding me?’
They all look at him.
Potter shrugs, craning his head to look for the coffee cart. ‘Yeah, I know. But I was never allowed in the shop. So the map was the only evidence that I’d actually been allowed out of the house.’
‘Well, I…I was setting up and…’
As she heads on out to the pitch she spies a figure standing out in the snow and grins, glad that Ginny is already waiting for her.
Hermione keeps her voice low and calm. ‘Lost it how?’ she asks, as gently as she can.
‘You might as well be!’ Potter exclaims, cutting her off in sudden burst and his expression is so frustrated and imploring and stubborn, so
Relief washes over Harry. He smiles down at his hands. ‘Thanks, guys,’ he says.
Malfoy grabs at his arm, trying to pull him back, but Potter just throws him a sly smile and takes another half step.
‘Much better since the phoenix tears,’ she says. ‘His core is stable. I’m…fairly confident he’ll still have use of his magic.’
An affliction with no cure. No remedy. No potion. Nothing that will make the disease currently riddling it’s way through Potter’s magic any better. Slowly but surely his condition will worsen.
an idiot.’
‘Well, are you going to sit down or do you plan to make us wait all day?’ Mad-Eye barks.
greenhouse!
Hermione bites the inside of her mouth. She doesn’t tell Ron what she’s thinking. She certainly doesn’t admit that he’s right; that Harry
‘Try not to loose us anymore house points, yeah?’
Her teeth clench, and Poppy has to keep from sighing yet again. ‘As I said, Potter,’ she says briskly. ‘Give it more than a few days. Now, I believe you have a dorm to return to?’
Draco glances back at him, eyebrows raised. ‘What, you’ve never seen an ice-rink before?’
? What were you looking for?’
‘Ron!’
Draco’s shoulders tense. His brows furrow and his eyes have stopped moving and Blaise just
People stared up at the thing in varying degrees of discomfort or even fear, though Tonks noted that Potter was one of the few people gazing up at it in awe.
‘Goodness,’ Molly murmurs as the kitchen door swings shut again.
‘At least someone does. I’ve no fucking idea what it does.’
for me to be a normal teenager and I swear I won’t ask for anything else but please,
Theo had retrieved the necklace from. Draco who had snuck the thing into Hogwarts to begin with. If all else failed, Theo could easily pin the situation on him. No one would doubt him. Not with Draco’s track record. Not when the mission was Draco’s to begin with.
Draco presses a soft kiss to the corner of his mouth. ‘That’s the idea,’ he murmurs, and sucks softly on Harry’s collarbone.
Harry groans and Draco almost drowns in the sound. He presses closer, but Harry shifts suddenly, rolling them sideways so that he’s the one in control. Draco doesn’t care. Not when Harry’s leaning back down spread fire along his skin.
‘You don’t have to like me,’ says Malfoy in a calm, quiet voice, as though he were talking about nothing more than the weather. ‘But don’t make the mistake of thinking you know me. You don’t know what I’ve done. The choices I’ve had to make. Maybe I’m not like you lot with your morals and your good intentions, but Harry trusts me and if you can’t see the sense in having someone like me around to watch his back then you’re stupider than I thought.’
Harry growls. ‘Well, fine then,’ he says. ‘I’m not going to kiss you until you show it to me.’
‘I hope you don’t mind a detour first, little book,’ she says, her footsteps light as she heads out of the library. ‘But I have a feeling that you’re important to more than
‘Yes,’ Neville whimpers. ‘It hurts.’
‘Honestly, Ron,’ says Hermione, slinging her bag over her shoulder and coming to stand with them. ‘You can’t talk about a teacher like that.’
‘I said I don’t hate you,’ he says.
Ginny laughs. She shifts her focus back to Colin. ‘But in all seriousness, I’d love to see them.’
‘What about Remus?’ Pomona suggests, brightening. ‘He had such a way with Harry that year he taught here, didn’t he?’
‘This is because I told you to stop acting like my mother, isn’t it?’ he says, dropping his gaze to pick sulkily at the sheets.
‘I take it detention didn’t go well, either,’ remarks Blaise.
‘And I’m not helpless.’
‘Thought you said that analogy was stupid?’ Theo mutters, shaking his head.
‘You don’t think—‘
Across from him, Ginny shrugs. ‘Well let me know, yeah? I’d love to see what you have.’
Deep inside him, the wolf whines it’s agreement. Though the full moon is still weeks away, the wolf tugs him toward Dora. He can feel it’s pull, her easy nature quelling the fury of the beast, making him want to curl up beside her by a warm fire.
‘Oh, er, yeah,’ he says, his tone sheepish, and half cringes at Harry. ‘I, uh, I didn’t mean to— I mean I know I was...look I’m sorry, okay? I didn’t know how big a deal this was in the muggle world.’ To emphasise this rather ineloquent statement, Ron gestures vaguely in Harry’s direction.
‘There’s something wrong with me,’ he whispers, ‘isn’t there?’
Draco,’ snaps Blaise, shooting a glare back at him. ‘It’s different for you. You know that your parents will never abandon you. They
Pansy and Weasley slouch further in their seats, scowling at each other.
The chorus of cheers turns into groans of displeasure and Professor Sprout smiles indulgently as she waves them off.
‘Well that’s different!’ Harry objects, pouting and crossing his arms.
Potter is quiet. He opens his mouth several times, but closes it without saying anything.
‘Well, that shouldn’t be too hard,’ says Poppy. ‘After all, how much trouble can they get into in two days?’
‘…this sucks. If I could
Weasley and Granger stand near the entrance hall. Weasley has a baffled look on his face, staring at Potter as if he’s lost his marbles. Granger just looks amused. Blaise catches her eye and smirks. She arches a brow and rolls her eyes.
‘Do you ever—oh wow.’
Ron raises his eyebrows and waits for the Slytherin captain to reply, expecting Malfoy to get torn a new one, but instead the voice he hears is
As always thank you to everyone who is still out there waiting for the next chapter. I desperately want to be able to finish this story, but finding the time and energy lately just to squeeze writing into my currently very busy schedule has proved more difficult than when I started. Thank you for your patience and your perseverance in sticking with me as I make my slow way through to the end of this story.
‘Be right back,’ she mutters, and hurries off into the shelves.
Vince shrugs. ‘Don’t know what’s so interesting about a book?’ he turns to Millicent—who is sitting on his other side—and asks, ‘You don’t like reading, do you?’
Unfortunately, Severus distracts her. ‘Surely even
‘There’s no need to be rude,’ Hermione says before she can help herself.
He sighs again, and places her gently into the new home he has built for her. ‘Merlin knows it would be useful if I
Somewhere outside thunder rumbles and Draco scowls out the next window into the pouring rain. He can just make out the blurry outline of the pitch in the distance and wishes that the rain would let up. At least then he could clear his head with a quick spin.
He’s careful.
—again, hands tightening around Draco’s waist and never before has Draco wanted to ditch out on anything more than he wants to ditch out on Quidditch practice right now.
‘But they’re here,’ he says, his breath coming quicker. ‘They’re here so they weren’t…they weren’t okay…’
The stag fades away, leaving the corridor looking darker than it had before it arrives. Ginny’s heart is in her throat, frozen in the shock of seeing the stag.
‘A dog?’
‘Yes,’ says Brown, her voice a little too flat—and Theo can only hope that Patil doesn’t notice. ‘I have something I need to do. A present to deliver.’
She pauses, her gaze shifting, growing distant. ‘No,’ she says. ‘I don’t think so. At least not yet.’
‘Oh, I didn’t…I mean,’ he glances around, frowns at the scattered muggles walking passed. ‘I didn’t realise we were in Muggle London.’ He blushes again, and adds, ‘probably something I should’ve noticed.’
Draco frowns. Potter is already slipping back into the depths of his exhaustion. Worry niggles at Draco, but he brushes it away. This is not the “waking up” that the headmaster was looking for. He’s not ready yet. He’s
‘Well I’m sure Draco will go fetch it,’ says Blaise gaily, grinning brightly at Draco. ‘Won’t you?’
Instead of the usual pristine uniform that Draco normally wears, he’s in a loose fitted, untucked t-shirt and a pair of wrinkled slacks. His hair, which is normally perfectly coiffed, falls around his face in messy strands. Despite all this, it’s the look of complete and utter panic flashing across his face that has Harry abandoning the armour completely and standing up.
Anyways, I'm back and determined to finish this. This story is by no means over - I plan to go all the way through to the end of 7th year and considering 6th year has 46 chapters so far and isn't even finished...that's still a lot of story to cover.
‘Not sure,’ says Blaise. ‘Probably off terrorising some poor firstie. Say, did you finish the homework?’
‘Yeah, I guess,’ he says though he doesn’t sound convinced.
Malfoy sits on the bed next to him, making himself comfortable. He reaches over and takes one of Harry’s hands that are clenched in the sheets. Harry lets him. Malfoy turns it this way and that with a frown and, with Harry’s hand lifted up into the light, Hermione sees why.
the familiar Gryffindor fire.
‘Wait, Gin—!’
He clenches his jaw, irritated at himself almost as soon as the words are out. Still, Potter’s face barely twitches at his tone and Draco can’t stop the unbidden memory of him laying in the Hospital bed from flashing across his mind. He clenches his fist, seized by the sudden desire to grab Potter by the shoulders and shake him.
Harry grinned and waved his hand, summoning a bottle of sunscreen from the carefully packed beach bag he hadn’t let Draco look in. ‘That’s why you use protection.’
Potter is shaking his head. ‘No, I can’t do that. I can’t just pretend that none of this ever happened and still make nice. It’s not fair. You can’t expect me to do that.’
‘Very well,’ she says. ‘I will refrain from speaking to Mr Potter, provided this doesn’t happen again. You’re in detention together for a reason, if you recall.’
‘That’s alright,’ says Daphne. ‘I think the fewer eyes involved the better. I wouldn’t want my judgement to get clouded.’
Tonks knows that he’s faced dragons before (twice, if the stories are correct) and yet she still can’t help but admire the way he charges forward, eyes gleaming as he drags his rather more anxious looking companion.
Romilda huffs, crossing her arms and glaring at the back of Malfoy’s head.
Draco chuckles. ‘Come on then,’ he says, reaching out to forcibly pull Harry to his feet. ‘Let’s get you out of the cold.’
‘Hm.’
Chapter Thirty-Nine
‘Are you sure? I can get you your bag—’
‘They clearly need to talk,’ says Hermione. ‘Let’s go find Harry.'
Ron scoffs and continues on, shaking his head and seeming unbothered by the complete lack of response from Malfoy. Hermione glances back at the blonde once more, seeing the tautness to his shoulders, the shadows under his eyes. Eyes that meet hers in the reflection of the window. His gaze narrows, then flickers and drops.
fancy him?’
With that said, the blond boy stalks out of the room.
Draco doesn’t react. He simply takes a deep breath and lets go of Luna’s hand. He steps down onto the stairs, bypassing Ron without a word, without a single look, and heads back down into the castle. He pauses on the last stair, turning back to frown up at them.
Draco arrives at the breakfast table, breaking Greg out of his thoughts.
Malfoy straightens up.
? God, I think I’m gonna throw up.’
Malfoy nods, but his focus is still pinpointed on Colin.
Draco flushes. ‘Yes. A bloody gesture. And a great, fat lot of good it’s done me, too.’ He shakes his head, turning away to run a hand through his hair.
‘Oh,’ says Luna in a soft voice. ‘Oh Draco. I’m so sorry.’
Casting a quick tempus, Tonks is just debating whether or not to send a patronus to Kingsley asking where the hell they’ve gotten to when she sees Hagrid’s bulk push his way out of one of the small telephone booths. Relief fills her and, after a quick check of metamorphmagus disguise, steps back into the side of the building to watch them.
Severus rolls his eyes. ‘You mean Potter came begging and you caved, as usual.’
‘You didn’t think what?’
Theo knows that Potter can’t possibly know about the necklace, can’t know—no matter what look Draco gave him—what danger they were just in, and yet the boy is obviously covering for Draco. Theo knows it. Granger knows it. Blaise knows it. Yet no one says anything.
‘It is?’ he asks.
Potter’s eyes go wide, and he leans up on his tip-toes to get a better look. Pod, as if sensing the attention, shakes his head, snorts, and lowers himself a little—offering Potter a better vantage point. Potter, grinning widely, takes a step closer.
Draco
They all head up to the front of the room to see a small, sprawling model display of what can only be described as lights and colour.
‘I…I don’t…’
He nods.
She shakes her head, a pitying look on her face. ‘I’m afraid you’ll have to redo the assignment.’
Malfoy’s gaze narrows. ‘Guess you got your way then,’ he says, his voice thick and hoarse.
She turns back to look at him. He’s still dressed the same, fastidiously neat. His hair, no longer slicked back, falls just short of his chin, perfectly cut and straight. His expression is still cool and superior, comanding the respect of his family and position.
Ron scowls. ‘It was an accident,’ he says sullenly.
Greg frowns. ‘We wouldn’t go through your stuff, Draco.’
She turned the corner, quickening her stride. ‘I’ve already told you, no.’
She raises her eyebrows. ‘Yes, that is correct.’
‘Merlin, do you
Romilda finally senses that her scheme to talk to Harry has come to a fruitless end and stomps away, muttering about Slytherins and Malfoy’s. Malfoy watches her go, amusement lighting up his face and making him look far less menacing than usual.
Colin knows that Harry doesn’t like all the attention he gets. He has learned, through trial and error, that Harry prefers solitude to the endless stares and whispers that follows him. Yet, despite that, the urge to photograph Harry has always itched in Colin’s hands because Harry’s face is one of the most expressive of all the people he’s ever met. Now, though, Harry’s face is carefully blank as he watches Malfoy leave the Great Hall.
Of course, it weren’t the first time that were the case. Not a single sixth or seventh year class has come through since Hagrid began teaching. Still, he had thought this year would be different.
‘Well that was odd,’ says Blaise, staring after Potter’s retreating back. ‘What’s got him so wound up you think?’
And why, exactly, has Potter taken the time to memorise the obnoxious coffee order of someone he supposedly hates?
The faintest of smirks twitches at Draco’s lips. ‘Relax, Potter,’ he says, digging through the pockets of his coat. ‘It’s just for a moment.’
He pushes himself up out of the chair, running a hand through his hair.
‘Deep breaths,’ she instructs, and casts another diagnostic spell.
is it?’
. Who is capable of dealing with the complexities of Malfoy and Potter’s past?’
A smile stretches across Harry’s face. Somehow, Draco never tires of seeing it. Bloody great big sap that he’s become. Well, at least when he’s around Harry.
‘…no. Surprise me. I don’t like being caught off guard. And you’ve been catching me off guard quite a bit.’
Her tone is such a stark contrast to the tiredness clinging to her, that he’s momentarily thrown. ‘Like I just got hit in the head by a bludger,’ he says, voice deadpan.
‘I saw the way you looked at me when I was caught under the mistletoe with Luna,’ says Harry. ‘You were jealous.’
Archie shakes his head.
Poppy purses her lips. She’s about to go in there and berate him about overexerting himself but without waiting for a response he turns and crawls back into his bed.
Blue taps her horn against the glass, sending a pulse of magic through the glass.
Greg shrugs. ‘Okay,’ he says complacently, the bag of marshmallows crinkling as he digs back through it.
Lavender glares, fury surging up her spine. ‘I’m not
your father, Theo,’ says Blaise.
Draco sighs and runs a hand over his face. ‘Yes. I know that too. But you said yourself, on Christmas day you’ll be at the Weasleys and I didn’t think…’
Considering how jumpy Harry’s been this morning, Hermione doesn’t blame him. Setting her cauldron to stir twenty more times on it’s own, she slips from her chair and ducks down to help Harry.
Blaise shrugs. ‘Who knows,’ he says, affecting an air of uninteresting that is about as convincing as a Blast Ended Screwt wearing a hat.
‘Oh, that’s right,’ says Dennis, turning to Colin. ‘You were shooting the quidditch teams today, how’d it go?’
Dean pauses. ‘No,’ he says. ‘But I can’t just sit here while Potter’s off having secret conversations with
‘Alright, Harry?’
‘Your favourite,’ says Molly, setting the dishes to wash.
Severus hadn’t planned on spending the last day of the Christmas break at Spinner’s End. In fact, he hadn’t planned on stepping foot in the place until the end of the school year.
I don’t know what the curse of the fairy queen is.’
Potter cocks his head. He reaches into his pocket, pulls out the little golden ball and considers it.
’Sh! Myrtle, will you please come out?’
Lavender takes half a step back, pulling her arm back as if he burnt her. Conversations around them go quiet and Lavender feels her shoulders turning in again, she swallows, and tries to squash the uncomfortable feeling.
‘No, I mean, we can’t because she already has one.’
‘Well,’ says Colin, careful to keep his voice low, ‘it seemed…’ he searches for the right word. ‘Personal.’
‘The table at the back,’ says Luna, gesturing over her shoulder toward the restricted section.
not Ron or Hermione. Can you imagine what would happen if they found that I
‘At any rate you seem to enjoy kissing him,’ Ginny teases.
‘I thought you approved of my plan?’ Minerva counters, heading over toward the fireplace to avoid the awful combination of scents coming from the cauldron.
Luna looks up from the page, staring straight into the blue eyes of the white wolf she cannot unsee.
He trudges into the room, his hands buried within the folds of his too-big robes (honestly, would
‘Exactly.’
‘Get back here Potter,’ Draco growls.
‘I didn’t even
‘He will certainly have his chance,’ agrees Minerva. ‘But as Mr Malfoy is not yet quite up to talking and
He turns away from Ginny and swings hard. The bat connects and the sound that echoes out across the pitch is concussive. The bludger explodes. Katie flinches even though she’s standing several feet away.
‘I won’t say it twice. Now, pour me another of those peppermint cocktail things and
‘Expecto Patronum!’
She sighs, and buries her hurt, hoping that—when he’s ready—he’ll come to her too.
He glances toward her, flushing. ‘That’s not…’ his
‘But now she does?’ asks Draco, leaning forward.
Hermione grits her teeth, but nods. ‘Alright,’ she says, and lays a hand on his arm. ‘You sure you’re okay?’
‘Er,’ he says. ‘I’m actually not sure why I’m here.’
‘Oh?’ she presses, but he’s too distracted.
Harry glances up, green eyes peeking up over his hands behind his glasses. He nods.
‘Oh for the love of Merlin would you forget about that blasted task for one minute?’ she bursts out, and a painting falls from the wall, landing with a heavy thud on the floor. Narcissa doesn’t pause. ‘It’s not about that. Yes he’s worried about the task but not because he doesn’t know how to complete it, but because he doesn’t
‘You mean…at the Alley?’ she asks.
Zabini scoffs. ‘He hasn’t switched. Trust me.’
‘I know that!’
The door to the second floor out-of-order bathroom creaks open and Myrtle sighs, wondering who has come wandering into her domain to torture her this time.
Harry reaches out.
No. This is about something else.
As Blaise talks, he swipes the book, tucking it into the depths of his robes as if the exchange had never happened. Greg keeps his face impassive in case either of them look back at him again.
Malfoy frowns, a scowl flitting into place, and Neville swears he sees a hint of disappointment in the expression. ‘Damn,’ he says, and he’s looking back down the hallway again, as if Harry will just magically appear there. ‘If you see him, tell him I’m looking for him.’
‘That’s what snow-spells are for,’ says Narcissa tightly. ‘We
He looks up, face flushed pink in the cold, and grins at Harry. ‘You coming or what?’
The Boy sighs and stands up. ‘Sure.’
). ‘Oh, that. Never mind.' He runs a hand distractedly through his already messy hair. 'Look, can we talk? Please?’
Harry’s emotions war across his face. Indignation, hope, annoyance, pleasure. ‘It’d hardly call a bit of flour a “disastrous mess”,’ he grumbles.
Ron seethes quietly, but Malfoy just arches an eyebrow and turns back around.
Ron blinks. ‘Your fault?’
Shock radiates up through his spine and he stiffens, unable to help the stunned expression working onto his face.
(See the end of the chapter for
Ron grimaces. Great. The Slytherin team was here. Ron sighs and contemplates coming back later, but the only thing worse than dealing with the Slytherins was having one of them find his wand.
The erumpent trots into view.
‘You know that isn’t the
Poppy chuckles. ‘True,’ she says. ‘Still, the quicker things get back to normal in here, the better.’
‘So,’ says Draco, settling into a cross-legged position, ‘you’re just all talk then?’
Colin blinks, pulling his mind out of photographing mode. ‘Uh, yeah I think so,’ says Colin, smiling.
‘Alright,’ she relents, holding up her hands.
Harry flushes. ‘Shut up,’ he mutters, looking back down at the photos. ‘I wonder what was on the one he took.’
‘Oh forget Ron,’ says Ginny, dismissively. ‘He’ll come around.’
Potter sighs, shrugs, and runs a hand through his hair. ‘I said “someone had to do something.”’
Harry shrugs. ‘Weren’t we?’
Dean shakes his head. He feels momentarily bad for Harry and whatever hell he’s just unleashed on him, but then he remembers that the alternative was two gossips spreading rumours about
He flinches, waiting for the inevitable hex or stinging insult, but Malfoy just blinks at him. ‘Longbottom,’ he says, and his gaze flickers over Neville’s shoulders. ‘Where are you coming from?’
‘And of course you’d be the
Hermione blinks. Neville
‘Hey,’ says Draco, nudging Harry’s hip with his toe. ‘You better not be leaving me to finish this thing by myself.’
Malfoy, the stupid sodding git, glances back between them but seems to know better than to say anything. Ron almost wishes he does. He’d give anything to have an excuse to hex the bastard. He hates him. He fucking
Draco raises one eyebrow and uses a thumb to clean away the smear of lemon curd. Harry swallows, red swarming up his neck into his hairline. ‘That’s because no one ever taught you how to be clean,’ Draco says dryly. ‘Well, that is, until you got here.’
‘My dorm,’ says Draco, and his gaze flicks over to Potter’s fist, still surrounded in the soft glow of angry red magic. ‘I know you hate me at the moment, but it would be really great if you could not hit me with that.’
He ignores it and flicks his wand out from its hiding place in his sleeve, sending up a flare out of the way but where he’s sure Potter will see it. That is, if he’s paying attention to anything other than the reckless flying he’s doing.
‘Right! No, no I won’t. That was an accident. With Hermione I mean. I won’t do it again I swear.’
‘That’s pretty good. Enough to get you an O on the spell at any rate,’ he says, suddenly wanting this little lesson to be over with. ‘If you keep practicing you’ll have it in no time.’
Malfoy crouches and mutters something Ginny can’t hear. She reaches the door, flinging it open, her wand pointed straight down into Malfoy’s surprised face.
Everyone looks at Malfoy.
He winks, and slips out the door.
Goyle taps her arm and points toward a shower of sparks on the other side of three bookcases, stacked with cages. ‘There.’
‘Yes I heard,’ she snaps. ‘What on earth were you thinking?’
Harry tilts his head. He pushes off from the sink, closing the distance between them in two short—if wobbly—strides. ‘Hot?’ he says into the other boy’s ear. ‘Snoggable?’
‘That happened at Diagon Alley,’ says Ron, comprehension washing over him.
‘These creatures,’ says the keeper with a smile. ‘They’re so misunderstood. People associate them with the dark arts because of creatures like Basilisks but most of them are beautiful and intelligent and well, quite simply wonderful. I’d love to be able to speak to them. To be a voice for them. I thought maybe…when I heard that Harry Potter was a parselmouth, maybe…’
She heads over to the table, and as she sits down Harry glances up offering her a smile.

‘You know a lot about flying,’ says a voice above him.
to me. Not anyone. Ever. I…I was surprised. I didn’t mean to offend you.’
‘Easy Draco,’ says Blaise in a low voice.
Ron drops into the seat next to Harry, nodding at Luna and Neville, leaving Hermione to sit across from them.
sort of Christmas magic. Whoever gave Draco the books, is a
Harry flushes and hurriedly takes a bite. Only, in his embarrassment, he shoves too much of the pastry in his mouth at once. Heat floods his face as he attempts to chew through the too-large portion of sticky pastry.
‘If anyone wants to listen to Potter’s love letter to me,’ says Malfoy with a smirk as he dumps the walkman back on the table. ‘Feel free.’
Two thestrals stand at the edge of the clearing, tearing into a hunk of meat. The flock is growing and Hagrid is proud to show them off to the students, but he’s missing the usual glow of warmth that comes with showing off these misunderstood creatures to his students.
‘If you’re going to be this dense then we’re never going to survive working together long enough to do anything useful,’ Draco mutters, rolling his eyes.
Insanity. Yeah. Like talking to yourself in the rain at the top of the astronomy tower.
Light swims just beyond the darkness clouding his mind. Harry rises out of unconsciousness in pieces, slowly, like crawling through mud. The first thing he feels is heavy, followed by the bitter tang of smoke.
Good to know that trick still works.
Ron’s gaze flickers to her, annoyance flashing through his still furious expression. ‘Nothing,’ he snaps, yanking his arm free. ‘I’m going upstairs. I swear to Merlin, if any of you follow me, you’ll regret it.’
‘Again?’ Harry asks, and tries (and fails) to keep the smirk out of his voice.
McGonagall is waiting for them when they enter, watching impassively as they all fumble around the room, trying to decide where to sit. Blaise eyes her.
hands through Draco’s hair (and yes, Harry is aware that fantasising about dishevelling a man while he’s fretting about his son is an all new low but, hey, it’s been a while).
Harry shrugs. ‘Like I said, just evening the score.’
‘Oh c’mon, it was a tiny drop. Barely even hurt.’
‘Although I did contemplate having the gardner switch them out for something with a little more colour. A bit of contrast to all this white,’ she says, gesturing around at the garden.
Chapter Twenty-Four
?’ Pansy asks.
‘Okay,’ says Harry.
Hermione does let it go, but only because they’ve arrived at the compartment. Instead she observes. And she notices.
Ginny pushes herself up, gasping in pain.
There’s another splash to her left. Zabini’s head breaks the water, shaking his hair out of his face as he gets his bearings.
She turns away before either of them can reply. Whatever is going on between Harry and Ron is—clearly—none of her concern. Ron’s stupid friends have made it perfectly clear that they don’t like her, and frankly, she’s had enough of worrying about what they think.
Ron gulped and shook his head. ‘No way. Not a fucking chance.’
A heavy sigh. ‘We could try walking down?’
But I don’t have to accept it. I will never accept it.’
‘If you ask me that one more time, I’m going to stuff the rest of that burger down your throat until you choke,’ says Malfoy in a huff, dropping his fork on the plate and sitting back. ‘Merlin, can’t you just say “thank you” like a normal person and move on?’
‘How did he even get in there?’
‘With being gay?’ asks Ginny, raising her eyebrows.
Potter tilts his head, and the gesture is so idiotically innocent that it instantly eases the tension in the room. Theo feels his shoulders relaxing. Immediately, irritation shoots up his spine. What does he care if Potter is relaxed or not? In fact, what does he care about any of them?
After everything that’s happened in the last week: agreeing to commit to this relationship, making the deal with Dumbledore, trying to find a way out of his mission and how to deal with his dorm mates questions, stupid Weasley and bloody
Ron straightens. ‘What is it?’ he asks.
Harry’s gaze drops to the floor and he shrugs, twisting the wooden spoon between his hands. ‘I guess,’ he mutters. ‘Like you need any other reasons to hate Muggles.’
She’s almost passable as attractive like this. If she made more of an effort, she might even manage to keep a guy around. Though—Pansy looks down at the secret notebook—she doubts that boys are a priority of Daphne’s.
Harry glances sideways. He grins, and, unable to help himself, nudges Draco’s elbow. ‘What? Wander around in the dark to go ice-skating?’
He flinches. ‘I am stronger than my trials,’ he mutters under his breath. ‘I am stronger…’
‘I don’t believe I gave you permission to use
‘Fuck,’ Harry whispers, the pit of his stomach clenching. ‘
‘Nothing is going on,’ he says.
Potter’s eyes go wide, the blood draining away from his face.
He sighs and runs a hand through his hair, mussing it up into disarray. ‘Why does it have to be so fucking complicated?’
He gives her a wave and trudges out the portrait hole.
Draco surges forward and plants a solid kiss on Harry’s lips. He slides a hand into Harry’s hair, holding him there. He flicks his tongue out, asking a question that Harry readily answers.
He has to make sure that whatever Draco tells him is a version of the truth that Theo can live with. After all, it was
But before he can, before he can make this impossible choice, Draco (who hasn’t seen Severus enter the street) reaches out, his face contorting with pain as he grasps hold of the front of Potter’s robes and, with what is clearly a monumental effort, apparatus them away with a loud pop; leaving only two large smears of blood where the two of them had lain.
Chapter Thirty-Seven
Draco snorts. ‘No, I said you
‘So do you,’ he mutters, dropping his gaze.
She turns, and Draco expects her to clack away back to her office, but instead she only takes three steps, stopping at the next bed over.
His voice cracks over the word, but it’s enough to bring him back to himself, just a little bit. His breathing evens out on it’s own. Malfoy raises an eyebrow, studying him.
He realises that Malfoy is feeling self-conscious. He’s never seen Malfoy look self-conscious before. Somehow that makes him feel a little better, and the tightening in his chest eases somewhat.
it’s hard not to notice), Draco doesn’t look away from Theo. Theo keeps his breathing even, his expression carefully neutral but for the slow, deliberate smirk he gives Draco.
Harry jerks, but doesn’t turn around. ‘Hey,’ he murmurs.
He’s funny in a self-deprecating, somewhat moody kind of way. He certainly never tires of riling Malfoy up, goading the boy until he explodes into a series of insults and reprimands that instead of making Harry angry, make him grin in amusement—as if daring Malfoy to do better.
Chapter Forty-Eight
For a moment, Ron thinks he can see actual
‘He knows,’ says Harry in a low, subdued voice, staring at the floor.
A/N: Okay you get an extra this week because I got excited by all the fluffiness. More to come next chapter with a full day at the Zoo (likely to be a long chapter!)
Neville glances down and flushes. ‘Oh, that,’ he chuckles. ‘Nope. I lost. Soundly.’
A glint enters Harry’s eye. His hand slips, and Draco jerks in surprise, his whole body tensing as Harry’s hand cups him.
She tilts her head. Keeping her voice neutral and equable (
of what he needs to do.
‘Just…if we could, take it easy for a bit? Just while I…try not to panic. I feel so stupid.’
It’s spotless, but that doesn’t stop the suspicion from whirring in her mind. Malfoy’s behaviour is just too odd. Something else has happened here tonight.
Greg glances at Draco’s prone form and sighs. ‘Er, Draco?’ he asks. ‘You okay?’
Draco looks up again, a scowl firmly in place and no doubt a scathing retort of epic proportions prepared and ready to be delivered but Potter is already gone, hands in his pockets as he joins his fellow Gryffindors.
about that obnoxious, self-important, self-righteous,
‘What can I do?’ Minerva asks again, her voice soft.
As she suspects, she finds him in the Owlery, leaning out the window with a decidedly pathetic expression clouding those aristocratic features.
A grunt of pain breaks through the momentary panic, and Harry focus’s just in time to see Malfoy get punched in the face.
‘Oh no,’ says Luna. ‘Nargles are
Malfoy and Potter both look surprised. They glance at each other, baffled, but the minute their eyes meet they look away again.
. You want to see him cry?’ Harry flicks off a mild stinging hex with a casual wave of his hand. Scorpius, naturally, starts to wail. ‘There. Now he’s crying’
Without meaning to, his gaze flicks over her shoulder to Harry. He’s watching them, an oddly unreadable expression on his face. He meets Draco’s gaze and blinks, seeming to shake himself from wherever his mind had wandered. He offers him a wan smile and gestures his head toward the castle, lifting his hand in a slight wave. Draco frowns, but doesn’t get a chance to try and keep him from leaving.
—sighs and rests his chin on Draco’s shoulder. ‘Stay a bit longer,’ he murmurs, and kisses Draco’s neck. ‘Please.’
He grins at her and it almost seems genuine. ‘You’re welcome,’ he says, and then turns to Ginny. ‘Where are you sitting?’
Blaise tilts his head in surprise.
Harry narrows his eyes at him. He sighs and runs a hand through his wet hair. ‘Tell me you didn’t.’
‘Er, no,’ says Lisa. ‘Are you sick?’
Draco crosses his arms. ‘You are an idiot.’
,’ Draco says hotly, fists clenched again.
‘Fae?’ asks Zabini raising his eyebrows. ‘I hope you’re not suggesting that this is a Fae curse. Because that would be bad.’
Draco,
‘Hmph. What’s so good about Ginny Weasley anyway? She’s a
A second shiver of cold creeps along Tonks skin, raising all the hairs on her arm as she watches.
He takes another deep breath, unclenches his hands from the sheets and straightens his back. ‘Tell me.’
He props his broom against the inside of the door, stuffs his numb fingers into the shallow pockets of his quidditch trousers and goes in search of the idiotic Gryffindor.
Draco swallows. ‘He’s never going to forgive me.’
Harry shifts, and something catches at Ron’s attention. He frowns, leaning out from his spot just beyond the doorway, staring at the unfamiliar markings on Harry’s back in confusion. His brain takes a moment too long to recognise what they are. They criss-cross their way across his back in varying shades of pink and red, some thick and some needle thin, leaving Harry’s back a disorganised mess of…of…scars.
‘What do you think about?’ asks Harry, his voice so quiet that Draco—lost in the motion of scouring the cauldron—almost doesn’t hear him.
Harry is staring at him in a mixture of disbelief and betrayal. Why does
Harry is lounging on the couches by the fire. He chews on the end of his quill, trying to think of a witty reply to a note Draco left in his potions book, but seeing as wit is not his strong suit, he’s not having much luck.
feel betrayed? Ron’s the one who has been kept in the dark. Again.
‘Oh, right,’ says Eric, and smiles again.
‘No, I—’
‘What the…?’ says Goyle, gaping at it.
Light bursts through the hallway, blinding all of them. Ron cries out. He grabs at Ginny, pulling her behind him and throwing up a shield to protect them from whatever attack Malfoy has made.
‘No, but I’m his mother, this is something that I know,’ she says, and she turns back to him again. ‘Draco’s priorities have shifted, Severus. He’s
Potter.
Greg shakes himself and gives Blaise a brief nod. ‘Yeah,’ he says. ‘Just thinking.’
fight. They’re in the hospital wing.’
‘Isn’t being a spy a good thing?’ he asks. ‘I mean, Malfoy’s a git, sure, but it could be good, you know? Having someone like him on our side.’
was a Werewolf. You can’t just lump them all under the same banner.’
She glances around the room and sighs. Apparently her own organised chaos has begun. She shakes her head and sweeps her wand around the room, sending everything back to it’s rightful place.
He huffs and reaches for his wand, intending on drying off, only to remember that Professor McGonagall took it to ensure he didn’t cheat his detention.
With a start, she realises he’s watching her. Waiting for her to pick up his gift from her own pile. Though she’d told Thistle to skip their tradition of “giving” (knowing that it would not be the same with Bella there, and Lucius gone), Draco still wants to watch her open her gift, as he’s always done.
‘But...no, no it
Mediocris Malum.
The room beyond is ablaze, fire spewing everywhere, and a shadow moves within the flames. Ron and Malfoy emerge from the orange glow, dragging Harry between them. They stagger from the room and Ginny darts forward to help with Harry.
‘I guess I was just worried about how well you’d take it.’
Streetlights and the glow of the moon cast conflicting shadows over Draco’s face, making him seem like a shadowy ghost rather than a real person.
‘But we don’t know where he went,’ says Greg, frowning.
Draco, breathing heavily, glowers at Theo. Theo doesn’t dare take his eyes off him. Even as Blaise moves into their line of sight, turning to face Draco.
‘I usually see you there during study break,’ she says, turning to hand him the book. ‘The Magical Creatures section is back there, and there’s a few lounge chairs near your table that are rather comfortable to read in. Besides, it’s quieter back there. Easier to think.’
Greg frowns. ‘What d’you mean?’
‘No.’
‘Because,’ she says instead, arching one brow. ‘I said so.’
Draco says nothing and Blaise knows he’s not going to get anything further out of him. Whatever is on his mind, flying has—at the very least—helped him regain his composure. His thoughts are back under lock and key and there’s not even a hint of the elusive blush Blaise had seen the night before; nor the baffled confusion.
?’ she asks.
‘Er, sure.’
So, Greg closes his mouth and pretends not to notice.
As he trudges down to Slytherin dorms, Theo feels the panic subsiding. He isn’t out of danger yet, but at the very least he hasn’t been discovered. Not by anyone significant anyway.
Ginny grins. ‘None taken. He’s an idiot,’ she says. She glances sideways at Harry and slings an arm around his shoulders. ‘Cheer up,’ she says. ‘He’ll come around.’
Luna’s mind, as it is want to do in such situations, reads the moment and translates it for Luna.
to rescue him from the conversation he clearly doesn’t want to be having.
girl?’
in there? With everyones papers just there for you to rifle through?’
‘I…yeah,’ says Harry, and licks his lips. ‘Was that…okay?’
‘—just have to try harder,’ one of the girls is saying.
Perhaps he should speak to Professor Dumbledore about getting some foals?
‘Because he’s...’ Dean glances back and forth between Harry and Ginny, and swallows. ‘Oh.’
Harry nods, coughs and steps forward. ‘Er, right,’ he says, and scrubs a hand through his hair (another nervous tic of his). ‘So, uh, Draco—er, Malfoy and I got this Walkman. It’s, uh, kind of like a radio, I guess. Muggles use it to play music. They insert one of these—a CD—and it plays music through these little things here called headphones. Since I know how they’re supposed to work, Malfoy was able to make it work using Rune work. Um…’
Then Minerva straightens, strength surging back through her eyes. ‘Alright,’ she says. ‘What do you need me to do?’
Someone mutters something and the Speaker tenses.
, Severus.’
‘Merlin, Potter, would you—mpff!’
‘Well,’ she says. ‘I still have to administer the morning potions, if you’d like to help with that?’
Realisation hits Neville like a stampeding hippogriff. ‘Of course we’re still friends,’ he says, dumbfounded that Harry could think otherwise. ‘Why wouldn’t we be?’
‘Then you’ll know that water doesn’t touch it. It’s not a normal fire. It’s magic. Powerful magic.’
It should be impossible for his face to get any redder, and yet, it does. ‘I, uh, kinda ran away,’ he says, rubbing the back of his neck.
‘Yes.’
‘Staying over,’ says Harry, nonplussed. ‘What’re you doing here? How do you know where I live?’
Chapter Eight
Silence. He keeps his eyes screwed shut, bracing himself for the laughter or the scathing insults. Except they don’t come.
Harry.
Harry frowns. He looks at Draco. He looks back at the painting. Squints. The little boy in the painting crawls forward, squinting right back at him.
a girlfriend.’
‘You’ve made a big mistake, Potter.’
‘Malfoy seemed quite distressed by his conflicting loyalties,’ says Phineas, finishing his tale.
idea, all he can think about is how surprisingly comfortable he is.
Draco swallows against the sudden lump in his throat, trying to shake off the unsettled feeling that’s crept over him. ‘Who bloody knows,’ he mutters and tries to resist the urge to stuff his hands under his armpits. ‘Are we having practice or not?’
‘Draco,’ says Luna. ‘I finished that book you lent me. It was quite interesting. I certainly enjoyed all the little notes in the margins. It was certainly quite different from Scamander’s book.
Hermione can practically feel Ron bristle beside her, but she squeezes his hand and he stays quiet. Though he shoots her an irritated glare that she pretends not to see.
?’ asks Ginny, rolling her eyes. ‘I hardly think
The click of the camera shutter had almost surprised Colin, he hadn’t even realised he had his finger on the shutter. The soft glow of the setting sun, casting shadows of light over the two of them, seeming to amplify their laughter. The natural, easy way they sat together in the grass, the snitch fluttering between them. The composition of it had called to Colin and he’d snapped the shot on instinct.
Hermione purses her lips. If she’s honest, she doesn’t really
‘So…Harry’s still free, then? I mean, he’s
‘That doesn’t matter,’ she says. ‘Look, you’ve said it yourself before. Harry hasn’t had much luck when it comes to adults, right?’
‘Oh. Why didn’t I think of that?’
Hermione frowns, biting her lip again. She wants to offer some word of encouragement or comfort, but since Ron’s awkward and rather public breakup with Lavender, she finds herself hesitating whenever she wishes to speak with him. Her voice betrays her, stuttering and catching in her throat so that she is suddenly unsure of how to act around him.
Potter laughs, surprise making his voice carry, and Blaise sees several students from other houses turn to stare.
‘We’ll go in together,’ said Harry, and indicated the space beside him.
‘The boy came to me, Severus,’ says Albus. ‘What would you have me do, turn him away?’
He chuckles. ‘Next time? Will I be that lucky?’
‘Now, now, Severus,’ says Albus. ‘You of all people should know how hard it can be to break out of old rivalries. What they’ve achieved this year is admirable, and I’ll admit they should be rewarded, but perhaps we should think of an alternative to the Zoo—‘
Potter’s eyes go wide, his face paling as he realises that Dean knows.
He glances at her, eyebrows raised.
‘Oh please,’ says Poppy, turning and flicking her wand and Potter’s chart. ‘Don’t pretend you didn’t notice. I know you better than that.’
Harry frowns. He opens his mouth, pauses, and snaps it shut again, the frown remaining in place. Hermione narrows her gaze at him, an idea niggling at her mind.
Also, there's a high chance of some major smut coming up so I may have to up the rating on this soon. There won't be any sex scenes, but there will be mentions of other activities. None of it will be overly explicit, but I'm going to add a warning at the top of the chapter anyway, just so everyone is forewarned. If this is an issue for anyone please let me know and I can also add a few bold asterisks (***) within the story before and after the scenes in question. Rest assured these scenes will not be overly frequent, and will only occur when the story requires it.
Suddenly, she understands. She understand’s Ron’s anger, and Harry’s misery, and Malfoy’s worry. She understands why Ginny wanted to buy 12 dozen roses for Harry to make some grand gesture to someone he’s “not” seeing and why the idea of doing so would embarrass him so much.
to do? I can’t fucking help it!’
clue of what you’re dealing with—’
Yet, all of that comes to naught in the face of one Harry James Potter.
‘Maybe…maybe you should write to him?’ suggests Potter. ‘Maybe it’ll help him to know that not everyone will think he’s dangerous because of something he can’t control. Maybe…maybe he can help change people’s minds about magical snakes?’
Ginny’s hands tremble. A touch startles her, and she looks up at Zabini, tears stinging her eyes as he takes her hand and squeezes.
‘So you
The groundskeepers hut is lit up, with smoke billowing out to be smothered by the downpour, but Harry, of course, isn’t sensible enough to at least take refuge there. No, he’s sitting up against a tree, with some flimsy excuse of a rain shield up, twining Blue between his hands.
They converge on Zabini. Ginny and Goyle from one direction, Ron from a second and Malfoy from a third, all of them coming to a stop at the sight of the large pink dome shrouding around a prone Harry on the floor.
She scoffs. ‘Please, you can’t lie to me, Harry Potter. You fancy someone, you just don’t want to admit it.’
‘Why shouldn’t I?’ Draco growls.
going on with me and Harry. Like I
Harry shakes himself out of his thoughts. Puzzling over the conundrum that is Draco Malfoy has never gotten Harry anywhere (except maybe flustered and wishing to be alone).
Theo, too, when he isn’t so self-occupied, has a mind sharper and brighter than anyone Greg has met. Not to mention Daphne, with her studious nature.
When the conversation devolved from the friendly (if heated) debate to insults, Smith—apparently at his wits end—threw down his quill and exploded up out of his seat. ‘Would you two just shut the fuck up and kiss already?’
Narcissa laughs. ‘Well, a flat, more like. It was mine when I was younger, given to me by my father when I left school. It’s not big, mind. Only two rooms with a little kitchenette and a reasonably sized bathroom. But it’s something of your own, to get you started when you finish school.’
‘No,’ says Luna, her mouth turning down. ‘Not sick. But…I think I might go for a walk.’
putting down his quill and regarding her fully. ‘That is interesting.’
‘I must say,’ says Lavender, eyeing Hermione with interest. 'I had heard about the bet among the Slytherins, but I'm surprised
His voice is even. Calm. There’s no jibe. No taunting. Just a truthful question that quiets Eric in an instant. His face goes pale. His breath catches. His eyes go wide and dilated. He might not have been afraid before, but he is now.
‘Yeah,’ she says.
Draco’s smirk widens. So, Potter is a prude?
boy talking to Harry. Draco growls.
‘Of course you do,’ says Ginny, grinning at him.
Potter blinks at him. ‘There’s not really much I can do about it. Besides, it’s not so bad. Tonks is alright. She’s your cousin.’
She smirks, pleased at the look of dawning realisation blossoming on each of their faces. She had noticed something they—the top of their class—had not. She had connected the dots where they couldn’t. Besides, Zabini and Hermione might be book smart, but relationships are were Lavender shines.
Glass shatters into the quiet hum of the potions room as ingredients and tools go scattering across the table and floor, drawing the attention of every head in the room, including Hermione’s.
Insects buzzed a steady, thrumming backdrop as the heat began to build, drowning out even the sound of the crashing waves.
‘You realise the world doesn’t
him?’
‘Gin,’ he says, and he’s looking out over the lake that now encompasses the entire pitch. ‘What the hell happened out there? What happened to the pitch?’
‘He’s gone again?’ Blaise asks as they gather up their things for the day ahead.
He stiffens and she knows she’s hit close to home. Oh yes. She knows the difference between a public interaction and a private one. She knows the importance of snarky insults in front of their classmates and sultry whispers when there’s no one else around.
‘What? No way.’
He laughs and she bridges the gap between them. In the background she can hear some sort of commotion, and assumes that one of the younger years has set of another explosion. Or Seamus, she supposes.
Blaise Zabini swallows, opens his mouth and swallows again, not saying a word.
‘Oh, this is going to be good,’ Zabini says.
‘Whoa,’ says Goyle, gaping at the mark.
‘I couldn’t care less what Potter and Malfoy have done now, frankly I’m more concerned about my Defence assignment. Snape assigned us
Without missing a beat, Malfoy leans back, turning in his chair to drawl, ‘even if there were, we all know you’d be too stupid to realise it’s worth and wind up loosing it anyway.’
fine.’
Poppy can feel another headache coming on. Minerva is watching her, gaze sharp and curious, no doubt surprised by Poppy’s lack of surprise. Curious about what she knows. Suddenly Poppy regrets inviting the woman along.
. I don’t even have to listen and I’m still passing.’
At the soft, gentle way she’s watching him. Without any surprise. Without any confusion. Like she really does know that he couldn’t make it stop. He swallows.
Light, blinding and white, erupts in front of her and Ginny cries out, pulling up to a stop. In the absence of the wind there’s a sudden quiet. So she hears the splash that follows the blinding flash.
, okay? McGonagall said I could come and look at the greenhouse if I told you your detention was over so I wasn’t trying to, to, to interrupt…or anything. I wasn’t spying.’
I debated with myself at length about whether or not to do a chapter in between the last one and this one; but in the end this felt right. I promise there will be more about what happened in the last chapter - just not yet :)
Myrtle is riveted to the spot. She can’t move. If she could blush, her face would be redder than ripened radish. Despite embarrassment, she can’t but imagine it’s
‘I have a strong suspicion that the feeling is mutual,’ she adds. ‘I won’t be surprised if Potter bags a boyfriend by Christmas.’
Professor Burbage turns around and Earnie cuts off. She stalks over to Potter and Malfoy’s shared desk, and drops two books in front of Malfoy (who jerks back rather comically).
Draco smirks and turns to Harry to find him already watching him. ‘What?’ he asks defensively.
‘Word from the Owls is that you’ve been taking photographs of all the quidditch teams,’ says Malfoy.
Harry glances around the busy common room and grimaces. ‘Yeah, I suppose you’re right,’ he says, and pushes up from the couch. ‘Gin, I’ll be back in a bit.’
Harry rolls his eyes and looks away. ‘Oh, fuck off.’
Parvati lines up a sash of red over a bright swath of pink fabric. ‘Is this too much?’ she asks, tilting her head at the colour scheme. ‘It’s very…pink.’
Draco pauses, gaze flickering down to the cover as uncertainty flashes through his gaze. He shakes his head, fists clenching as he glowers, as if his glare alone will pierce a hole in Potter’s head.
The blond glances over his shoulder at the door again, and it’s so quiet in the room Myrtle can here the familiar comforting gurgle of the broken toilet in the second last stall.
He blinks up at the ceiling, his glasses pushed up on the top of his head. ‘Hi,’ he says, and doesn’t even look at them.

‘You should.’
‘I’m sure.’
‘Let me guess, all girls?’
many options for me to guess from.’
Potter’s shoulders slump and he stares at Malfoy helplessly. ‘I…I mean I want to. I’m not sure how they’ll react but…don’t
He feels his heart wedge itself up in his throat.
He rolls his eyes and sinks down further in the chair. ‘I’m fine, thanks,’ he says and pokes his tongue out at her.
‘Um, what?’ asks Draco.
‘No,’ he whispers, shaking his head.
‘Watch it, Nott,’ growls Vince, finally looking up from his magazine. ‘I’m no follower.’
‘Yeah, and why do you think that is? It’s been like this all year, and Potter has to be the reason.’
Chapter Ten
‘Though generally speaking I prefer to date first. There’s a cosy looking cafe at the bottom of the mountain. Would be a nice place to warm up, I’m sure. Unless you’re not up for it?’
Severus smirks in victory. ‘You can protect,
‘Yeah, yeah, I know all about Harry and Romilda. There’s no need to rub my face in it.’
She places her knife and fork down on the plate. ‘I see,’ she says.
‘It’s not for me,’ says Potter. ‘I can’t stand that flavour. But Tonks likes it.’
Harry considers him for a long moment before a wry smile stretches across his face, he looks away, but his gaze flicks sideways, back at Colin. ‘You saw, didn’t you?’ he says.
‘And yet,’ says Blaise, and gestures at Colin. ‘You somehow managed to con Camera-Boy here into following them around for a whole night. Tell me, how
, okay?’
Draco’s body goes cold and still, the pounding in his head dying away to nothing (whether due to the potion or his shock, he doesn’t know). Without thinking, he swings his legs off the bed and follows Pomfrey, eyes fixed to the prone body on the other bed.
He can’t help it. For six years he’s watched Potter—hell for two months they’ve spent more time together than Draco has ever spent with anyone else—yet Draco has never seen him like this; and he reacts on instinct, pulling his guard up before realising he’s even done it, unsure of this new version of Potter.
‘I don’t,’ Malfoy drawls lazily. ‘If you recall, this some ridiculous form of
‘Something’s at the window,’ says Harry, still refusing to open his eyes.
‘What do you mean?’ says Potter, looking back and forth between Ginny and Dean. ‘You’re not, you’re not breaking up, are you?’
A/N: Please read!
‘You can’t just use that as a bargaining chip for everything, you know.’
changed him. All week I have watched him grow more distant and ill at ease. I tried to advise him, but all I did was push him further away. He’s has
Pansy sneers at him. ‘People don’t give me the flick,’ she says with a sniff. ‘He was too dull. Come on Draco, be a dear, take a walk with me?’
‘I’m not a mediwitch, Potter. I can’t heal broken bones.’
‘Did...did you just hex me?’ Harry asked, still dizzy from being woken so sharply from the nightmare he’d been having.
‘Mm. You still smell good.’
Draco yanks open the bed covers, kneels up on the end of his bed and glares across at Blaise imperiously. ‘Zabini,’ he says, his voice surprisingly matter of fact despite the irritated look on his face. ‘Do you know as much about sex as you claim you do or is this all show?’
He’s going rip Weasley from nose to naval, he’ll eviscerate his entire being until—
Hermione considers the mess around Harry’s spot at the table.
She turns. ‘Take out your books and continue where we left off,’ she says. ‘Mr Potter—’
‘What?’ Harry asks.
‘And now? You’re sure?’
Harry’s telling him it’s over?
‘Uh, what?’ asks Ron, leaning up on his pillow to frown over at them, confusion on his face.
‘Alright!’ called Professor Sutton (the new Muggle Studies teacher), clapping her hands together and surveying them all with a bright smile. ‘Have we all gotten food? Excellent. Now, you have three hours the first check in. Have you all got enough tickets? Back up money? Sunscreen? Yes? Excellent. Remember, stay in groups of at least two and if anyone gets lost, I’ll be right over there by the coffee cart grading your mid-year papers—’ here she shot them a cheeky grin and a wink. ‘—Alright, off you go!’
The table at the front of the room is filled with over a dozen different Muggle items, each varying in size, weight and colour. Hannah has seen them before, when the class first had to pick their assignments. They each got to choose one—except, of course, for Harry and Malfoy who had to share—and were tasked with finding out it’s purpose.
‘You might not feel tired now, but you will. Mr Potter will be fine without you to…pat his hair,’ says the woman dryly, eyeing Ginny’s hand.
‘He’s…okay. Isn’t he?’ he asks.
Blue eyes flick up at her, distracted. The boy frowns, and then pulls a small, rounded object from one of his ears, letting it drop from his hand to dangle from a thin wire.
Pansy smiles and lounges back in her seat. ‘Hm. Yes, and he was delightful.’
‘Going to jump, Potter?’
Draco sits up, throwing the pillow aside and glowering at Theo. ‘If I wanted an expert opinion on how to off myself I’d ask you,’ he snarls in a particularly cutting voice. ‘But for now I’d prefer if you’d kindly mind your own fucking business.’
‘Give me my shirt, would you?’ says Harry, his voice quiet as he glances back over at Malfoy.
‘No,’ says Draco. ‘I need you. Now.’
After a moment, a livid orange head pokes out of the green foliage. Then a second, and then a third.
Myrtle pouts. ‘I suppose that’s okay,’ she says.
. A girl he’s seeing.
His hands drop away and he says—in a particularly whiney voice—‘I don’t know!’
have forgotten that but I bloody well haven’t. He’s all but a death eater and we all know it!’
Blaise narrows his eyes at her, wondering what exactly she would want from his mother’s grimoire. Deciding that there wasn’t much in there that could cause any harm (unless one were married and needed to get rid of their spouse, which Daphne wasn’t), he sighs and gives her a slight nod.
‘Or patients,’ he adds.
Vince throws his magazine at Blaise. ‘Not that you twat,’ Vince growls. ‘I mean the end idiot. Finishing. She doesn’t like that part.’
Kingsley raises an eyebrow at her, before shaking his head and continuing to mark up the report (she wonders briefly whose it is, and hopes it’s not one of hers).
‘Hey,’ he says, and gestures to his parchment. ‘Think I actually did a good job. You might be proud of me.’
‘I’ve reconsidered,’ she says primly.
‘How do you accidentally kiss someone?’
of the matter is a much easier question to ask. Books are not usually the sort of gift that draws a person out the kind of slump that Draco has been well and truly entrenched in. The only reason they
‘Oh god,’ he whispers.
‘Tomorrow,’ says Poppy, somehow managing to keep the exasperation out of her voice. ‘Now, you’re to stay in your own beds and absolutely no magic. Especially you, Potter.’
‘Then we’re in serious trouble,’ says Potter. ‘Because neither can I.’
‘Yes, idiot,’ says the other boy,
‘I know,’ he gasps, his chest heaving, his too-wide eyes fixed on the woman in front of him. ‘I—‘
Aware that the mood is swiftly slipping into something a little too serious, Narcissa shakes herself off and gestures to Thistle. ‘Alright, then,’ she says with a smile. ‘How about the rest of the presents?’
‘Ginny!’
The surprising truth is that Draco doesn’t
There’s another, much more comfortable, silence as they stroll along. Theo shifts, glancing sideways as an amused (for him, anyway) glint enters his eye.
Urquhart sighs and stands up, eyeing Draco critically. ‘Zabini’s got a point. We can start practice without you, but there’s no point you being here if we don’t have the snitch.’
‘Mistress called?’ she says, and then (noticing the room they are in) jerks in surprise. ‘Are we’s preparing the presents already Mistress? Oh, should I call for dessert?’
question. What exactly
Two boys crash around the corner, landing at Harry’s feet in a tangle of flying limbs and grunts of pain, scaring the absolute shit out of him. His heart pounds and it takes a moment for his vision to clear—flashes of a different kind assault him. Red and grey and a rubble strewn street obscuring his vision.
He groans. ‘God, don’t remind me. Him and me and Hagrid for a whole day. I can’t think of anything worse.’
keep accusing Mr Nott then right now we will be hearing from him.’
‘That would be cheating,’ Blaise remarks, but, the minute Slughorn’s back is turned, he vanishes the failed potion.
Parvati makes a face, and turns back to their work, leaving Lavender to go after Ron on her own. Lavender can feel her shoulders hunching. She takes a steadying breath and straightens up, flicking her hair back over her shoulder. She hears her mother’s voice in her head,
‘Then…what’re we doing?’ asks Ron.
Chapter Fifty-Five
She freezes.
He produces his wand with a flourish and flicks it at the bag. It shrinks and zips into one of his pockets, hidden from view. Potter mutters something Tonks can’t hear under his breath—something derogatory from the sounds of it—and Malfoy flicks him in the back of the head.
‘Just ignore him,’ Draco mutters, already absorbed back into his book. ‘It’s what I do.’
‘Oh, that’s easy,’ says Luna, tilting her head back to look at him (Ginny—and interestingly enough, Malfoy—grab the sides of her chair to keep her from toppling backwards). ‘That’s because you’re good with plants.’
‘Honestly, Potter,’ says Draco with a roll of his eyes, stepping over to Harry and brushing flour out of his hair. ‘Is there
Hermione crosses her arms. ‘We don’t know that I’m wrong.’
Harry shoots her a desperate, and yet silencing glare. ‘Don’t,’ he whispers to her. ‘I’ve got it.’
Blaise’s eyebrows shoot up. Considering this is probably the longest conversation the two of them have ever had without it coming to insults, Blaise has to agree with that statement.
‘So?’ Ron asks, bewildered and still half asleep.
‘What,’ he said with bright eyes (all traces of long-suffering indignation vanishing from his face), ‘is
‘McGonagall was furious,’ says Draco, exaggerating.
‘Wow,’ breathes Eric, reaching out a hand to trail reverently along the glowing form of Harry’s stag. ‘It’s amazing.’
‘I do hope you don’t leave
Maybe he is. Yet, Blaise suspects that Draco’s continued odd behaviour is going to be in his favour this time.
‘They’re are four colours,’ she says, running a finger down the spines of the books. ‘Red, green, yellow and blue.’
going to the apothecary, and, in fact, he does. Yet, that doesn’t stop him from seeing the truth. There’s only one reason he wanted Severus to do the task, and that is the fact that he doesn’t trust Slughorn. Not that Severus blames him. He doesn’t trust Slughorn either. After all, if it weren’t for
Ron’s footsteps falter. ‘You’re not serious?’ he says and shudders. ‘What does that even mean? No, you know what, I don’t want to know.’
‘Potter!’
Hesitation has never been either boy’s preference. In fact, they’re almost always too eager to blame each other for whatever scrape they’ve managed to get themselves into.
Tonks finds herself silently thanking her mother for driving her out of the house. She slows her steps, no longer eager to get inside out of the snow—hoping instead to prolong their conversation.
‘Sick?’ Minerva asks, voice sharp. ‘What happened?’
know this? Surely it’s not something they go around advertising or every student in Ravenclaw would be there clawing their way in to find their marks. Not to mention Hermione.’
‘I like peppermint.’

of his very own) had barely made a dent in his morose mood.
A gesture.
Including, sitting down there end.
His face is bright red, and he stares fixedly at his hands as he talks, his whole body a lesson in being uncomfortable.
The hunger is still there in Potter’s eyes, but there’s something else, something that makes Potter tense as a coiled spring. Something that makes Draco wary.
She wants to tell him not to worry—at least, not about their fight. This apathy clinging to Harry like a shield is not about Ron.
Malfoy and Ron glare at opposite sides of the room, mirrors of each other.
Mostly, though, he hates him for taking Harry.
. The shield. Who cast the shield?
In which there is smut. Lots and lots of Smut.
Harry’s shoulders turn inward. ‘I don’t, um, I’ve never…god this is humiliating.’ He drops his face into his hands and blurts. ‘I don’t wank.’
‘Morning Potter,’ he says. ‘Haven’t seen Draco lurking around anywhere have you? We seem to have misplaced him.’
and the next thing I know he’s gone! Merlin, this is a nightmare. I’m supposed to be on vacation. This is supposed to be
Ron stares at them, unable to think of any words to say. He’s so angry his entire body is hot. He simultaneously wants to yell at Harry and punch Malfoy. His chest heaves and it physically hurts to try and keep his breathing under control.
‘Please,’ says the boy, leaning forward again. ‘Even if you could just take a look at my wand work and give me some advice.’
Potter turns sharply, pulling out of Malfoy’s grip with a scowl, his fists clenched. Phineas sighs, and gets ready to alert a teacher to an impending fight.
Colin lowers his voice and says, ‘I didn’t mean to spy, it’s just,’ he shrugs, hoping Harry won’t be angry with him. ’It was just kind of instinct. You know?’
they’re curious. She’s not the only one who realises that she’s never been late to class before. She crosses to her desk, ignoring Potter as he trails her, and flicks her wand at the board. Instructions for the lesson weave themselves across the surface, but Potter is still stubbornly at her back.
go to the Malfoy’s. That was clear enough.
They sit for a moment in silence. Harry shifts closer to her, their shoulders pressing just close enough to draw comfort, but not enough for Harry to be leaning on her.
Minerva’s interest pique’s but she lets none of it show on her face. Her gaze flicks around, scrutinising the room.
Tonks frowns. Her Auror eye flicks over the group. She notes the tension that’s built. The unhappy (if unsurprised) frown on Hagrid’s face. The bemused crease of Malfoy’s brow, the way his shoulder’s tense as he takes in Potter’s nonchalant words.
‘Oh really?’
. How can this just
‘Of course,’ he says.
As they pulled back into the station, Harry glanced across at Draco’s windswept face and saw those bright silvery eyes gazing back at him alight with fire and excitement, and suddenly wanted nothing more than to sit right where he was all day long.
‘Ron—’
Harry’s weight vanishes from Ginny’s shoulder, and she startles as he’s magicked away from them and placed on a stretcher that Ginny didn’t notice. McGonagall leans over Harry, waving her wand distractedly as she inspects Harry. The smoke vanishes from the hallway.
, Pomfrey’s already given me her approval. I’ll have an extra potion in the morning and I’ll be right for the day. It’s all sorted.’
‘No. It’s not. It’s yours. Malfoy hasn’t done
‘Oh please,’ says Ron, flushing red in his indignation. ‘Malfoy deserves everything he gets. The guy is an absolute prick! It’d be just like him to start something and then get Harry in trouble for it! I wouldn’t be surprised if the whole thing was some nasty plan to make Harry get stuck with him so he can do something even worse.’
Potter shudders, groans and runs his hands over his face.
Harry’s gaze shifts to him. ‘For what?’
They head out together. Tracey and Pansy take the lead, their irritation quickening their pace as they walk—their heels clacking against the marble floors.
Kingsley pauses and frowns up at her. ‘Crush?’ he asks.
Harry’s shoulders slump. Lavender glares at him. The urge to slap him surges through her arm, and she clenches her fist. Her relationship is about to end and
He sets the box of books aside, placing it carefully on top of the pile of presents beside him, his hand lingering along the top of the box.
Potter groans and pulls back, dropping his forehead against Malfoy’s. ‘We can’t keep doing this,’ he whispers. ‘You said it yourself, all we’re doing is going around in circles. If this is what you really want, I’m all in. But I can’t keep thinking this is happening only to have you pull away again.’
Irritation spikes. Along with determination. In response, she braces her arms on his shoulders and uses him to push up out of the water. Surprise lights his face. Right before he’s dunked under the water.
is keeping secrets from me. Again! How long have you known about this?’
Malfoy drags Potter to the exit without answering. He’s shaking his head, clearly exasperated. Hagrid, with a quick, nervous smile to the Keeper, follows.
‘Do you have to do that?’ asks Harry.
Harry goes still. Oh, if only Draco knew.
we here?’
Kingsley chuckles. ‘You need to be faster than that, Nymphie’
They start filtering off, back toward the castle, and for the most part no one takes any notice of the fact that Harry and Draco are still standing together. Draco keeps his face carefully neutral, being sure to sneer in the direction of anyone whose gaze lingers too long, but inside he feels oddly satisfied by the way their gazes glaze over them. Well, mostly everyone.
‘I never said—ugh you are
‘You’re brother is staring,’ Dean mutters, pulling away from her lips just long enough to get the words out.
Harry laughs. It’s an abrupt laugh. Dry and humourless, and—Hermione’s chest tightens—full of bitterness.
Theo turns away in disgust. Though who he’s more disgusted with (Draco, or himself) he doesn’t know. He heads for the door.
‘No.’
him!’
The air is thick and hot—even through the bubble charm around her head—and a thin layer of perspiration coats Ginny’s skin, making her clothes stick to her back. In the distance something fizzles and pops and the acrid smell of something metallic tickles at her nose.
‘Yeah,’ he says in a low voice. ‘Different.’
‘Oh yes,’ says Molly, spelling ingredients out of the cupboard as Harry speaks. ‘That will pair quite nicely.’
Weasley, of course, entirely misses the amused disbelief on Blaise’s face and turns on him. ‘What’ve you been doing to Hermione?’
‘Malfoy,’ he says, stopping at their section of the table and thrusting a sheet of parchment at Draco. ‘Here’s your new timetable. Your new books will be sent to you.’
‘Now, now Severus,’ says Albus amiably, ‘give the boy a chance to speak, as Minerva promised. Mr Nott, I gather you understand the gravity of your actions?’
‘He won’t tell anyone, either,’ says Hermione, pointedly glaring at Ron. ‘Will you?’
She starts to hum, closing her eyes, but she stops, eyes flying open again when she hears a mewling, anguished cry, followed by a muffled thump. Images flash through her mind—a crying kitten, a hungry child, a wolf howling it’s despair at the moon, a lovesick man waiting for…what?—and before she can reel her imagination back in someone is brushing past her, storming off through the aisles with barely a muffled apology.
Harry didn’t cast that shield.
He’s left to stalk about the house in this manner for another hour before he hears the knock on the front door.
‘You can fix it, can’t you? Here—‘ he goes to lift his wand again but Malfoy grabs his arm.
‘You, arguing with the Headmaster,’ he says, frowning as he glances around the room and sees no sign of the man. ‘But before that, I was playing quidditch. Is it…what day is it?’
Harry frowns. He swallows and shuffles his weight from foot to foot. ‘But I…I didn’t say it back. He said…he said…’
He does the only thing he can think to do under the circumstances. Right as Malfoy is opening his mouth to speak—no doubt to rightfully ask what the
They befall Ron Weasley—who starts a relationship with Lavender Brown though anyone with any sense can see that partnership is doomed for failure.
He’s trying to think. Draco is smart. Severus would like to think he’s smart enough to have gotten the hell out of Diagon Alley the minute the attack started. He knows Lucius has been training Draco to apparate but he has no idea whether or not the boy has mastered the ability.
Poppy doesn’t berate him.
‘Oh,’ he says, calling out to the class as he remembers that he’s supposed to assign homework. ‘Er, I expect an essay from each of you on how Thestrals are misunderstood by next lesson.’
A hand closes around Neville’s arm and pulls him free of the flowers (which weren’t really trying to eat him, they were just curious). Neville sighs as the offending bulbous flower releases his arm without hassle. His robes are soaked through with a pungent smelling slime, but that’s nothing to the discomfort he knows he’s about to face.
Harry takes a long breath. ‘About what?’
Short and sweet; major fluff and goofiness warning. Hope you love it as much as I do ;)
‘I know that but—,’
‘What just happened?’ asks Harry, uncrossing his arms and staring after Mr Nott and Severus. ‘Did you … did you just let him go? Without even punishing him at all? You are going to punish him, right?’
Her mind whirls at the implications.
‘Ginny?’ says Harry, ‘Can I talk to you?’
He surges forward and before Harry has a chance to comprehend what’s happening, Eric’s lips are on his.
‘I think what Potter is trying to say,’ says Malfoy in that clipped, sarcastic tone. ‘Is that Potter and I snogging in the dirt isn’t exactly going to please most people.’
(See the end of the chapter for
Potter just frowns.
‘I hate parties,’ he mutters.
Harry’s chest heaves, his emotions warring over his face plain for all to see. Worry, fear, relief, guilt, and a fierce desperate wanting that has him leaning forward, as if on the verge of rushing to the young Malfoy’s side, only held in check, it seems, by the fear and guilt warring for control of his emotions.
‘Yeah, that’s what I just said.’
Mr Zabini raises an eyebrow, opens his mouth
Minerva raises her eyebrows. Her gaze flicks almost subconsciously to Poppy’s desk, drawn—no doubt—by Potter’s file. It’s there that she catches sight of the large book on the edge of Poppy’s desk.
Granted, he’s never
‘You coming in?’
? If anyone can change his mind, it’s you. Tell him what Pomfrey said, that it’ll be good for me. Tell him…tell him he can sick whatever bodyguard he wants on us!’
Malfoy stared at him, bewilderment flashing across his face. Though after a moment of hesitation he pushed himself away from the wall and stood next to Harry.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘But—‘
‘The Potter estate has to have at least one family home in it, aside from Godric’s Hollow of course,’ says Draco. ‘And I know for a

come two simultaneous shouts and Minerva lifts her head, eyes glittering in satisfaction.
Taking another deep breath, Ginny braces herself and pushes up, pulling Harry as far up out of the water as she can manage, shoving herself down beneath the surface in the process.
‘If you recall, you kissed me first. I was merely screwing with you’re already screwed up head.’
She contemplates explaining. Telling him how, of all the branches of magic, transfiguration is the most logical. The least bound to emotion and therefore the best form to help him manage his control.
Ginny’s face falls. She closes her eyes and presses her face into her hands.
I want to thank everyone for being so patient with me and for checking in on me. I appreciate it so much.
she understands why he’s avoiding Ron. It’s one thing for Harry to admit that he’s gay, but there is no way Ron wouldn’t struggle with the idea that Harry might already have a boyfriend.
He’s attractive, in a tall, dark and arrogant sort of way, and thinks that she wouldn’t mind being stuck next to
He can almost picture Dumbledore’s non-too-subtle smug smile. ‘You need to get to know your students, Severus. To be a teacher you cannot merely teach. You must
Draco frowns. He looks back toward Smith, who is watching Potter leave with a smug expression that Draco wants to slam into a wall. Except then Harry is passing him.
She hears the Infirmary door burst open from two rooms away. Marking her place in the book she’s researching, she tucks it and her notes safely away in a draw before casting a soft, but strong locking charm and heading out into the infirmary.
‘This little jaunt.’
Books and notes and soil samples spill everywhere, cascading down the steps and scattering across the floor. He curses. He curses again. Then he blushes at his own use of the rather colourful language.
Pansy groans and rolls her eyes. ‘Ten galleons says those two—’ she points at Blaise and Ginny, ‘—are snogging before the end of the day,’ she says in disgust.
‘You don’t seem to mean much of anything lately,’ she remarks dryly.
Tonks shuffles along the aisles, careful to keep her arms firmly by her side whilst also pretending to study the various knick knacks on the shelves—not an easy feat mind you. She spies them in the back corner, looking over the shirts on offer, most of which boasting some claim at having visited Scamander Emporium.
The water shuts off. Draco pulls on his shirt, turning away so as not to cause Potter any anxiety (although the temptation to stand on the other side of the curtain and tease the Gryffindor is hard to resist).
Potter casts Malfoy one last doubtful look, shakes his head and follows Hagrid through the small gate and the thin, imperceptible layer of magic shielding the Zoo from the prying eyes of Muggles.
Draco nods.
‘Goodness,’ McGonagall says. ‘Miss Weasley if you’d kindly refrain from—’
Blaise flushes. ‘I’ve…caught the snitch,’ he admits begrudgingly. ‘Why, do you need a demonstration?’
get rather cosy with her.’
‘You’re pretty good,’ says Malfoy, gesturing at the photos that Colin places carefully on the table (away from any of the nearby goblets).
Draco doesn’t answer. His throat works, his lips mouthing the words as he reads.
‘I know that this might seem…strange,’ says Harry, glancing up at Neville and then across at Malfoy. ‘But, I’d really appreciate it if you didn’t say anything. I know you don’t have any reason not to. Especially with how Draco can…er, but um, you know, if you could maybe just keep it to yourself…that is, if we’re…if we’re still friends?’
‘Yes you can,’ says Poppy.
anyone’s help, Potter, least of all
Malfoy jumps and swears. Disapproval swarms in Hagrid’s gut like angry bees, but before he can step in, Malfoy surprises him by actually smiling.
who cast the shield in class. Meaning that he’d known perfectly well that Harry hadn’t been able to cast it at all.
Harry shrugs. ‘Erm, you know…’
‘Did you hear?’
‘You’re a real jerk, you know that?’
‘Alright Miss Weasley,’ says Madam Pomfrey stalking back out from her offices, ‘into your own bed now.’
came to
Ron pauses, turning sideways to look at her. ‘Worried? Why?’
she approves them.
‘Like,’ says Draco, as if explaining something to a small child. ‘What kind of action? Are you a Chaser or a Seeker? Do you bother with quaffle at all or are you all about catching the snitch?’
Draco looks away. ‘I don’t know what you mean.’
He grins at her. ‘I hear there’s a bet going around. Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas are taking guesses on when they irritate a Professor into expelling them.’
With all the people it’d be impossible to use an eavesdropping spell, and so Tonks digs around in her pocket and withdraws the thin strip of flesh she’d confiscated from Fred and George Weasley earlier that year. She grins, marvelling at their genius. Really, Mad-Eye should consider hiring them to make Auror products.
Draco sits back in his chair. ‘No, I don’t think I will.’
Ginny grins and gives him a wink. ‘I’m not sure
I thought about waiting to post this until I had a few more pre-written chapters under my belt...but I thought that might be a bit cruel haha. So, I hope you enjoy, and hopefully I can keep up this posting pace.
‘Er, no, sorry.’
He frowns. ‘I am talking to…oh. You mean…’ he sighs again, heavy and miserable.
‘But—’
‘Well,’ he says, his voice more shy than condescending. ‘Took you long enough to figure it out. And here I thought I’d—mph.’
‘So,’ he says, and his voice hitches an octave too high. Clearly his throat, he tries again. ‘So, what’s next?’
Harry shrugs. ‘The Weasleys invited me for Christmas.’
‘I’m a little busy, Malfoy,’ he says, squinting as he lays yet another spell over the maroon fabric—honestly, couldn’t they get a better colour for this stuff?
‘Go on then,’ he mutters, and Draco’s gaze flashes over to him, somewhat sheepishly. ‘I’ll be in the apothecary when you’re done. Linger too long and you’ll be on your own.’
‘Uh, yeah, but that’s new,’ he says. ‘And it’s kinda hard not to notice Colin.’
think they’re friends?’ asks Daphne, turning her head to look at Blaise, staring at him with those serious blue eyes.
‘I call cheating,’ says Ginny, folding her arms across her chest. ‘Ron clearly had inside information.’
. We have to think of something.’
‘Riddikulus!’
Chapter Fourteen
‘Oh,’ says Harry.
Pansy, of course, ignores Weasley. ‘I’m talking about Blaise’s little trysts with little miss goody two shoes,’ says Pansy in her most haughtiest tone.
‘You…’ Harry’s eyes go wide. ‘Please tell me you didn’t do anything stupid.’
Minerva frowns. ‘You said yourself that he needs to get back into routine.’
Harry blinks. ‘Uh, I don’t really know any other seventh year spells. Sorry,’ he says, and makes to pull his arm away, but Eric tightens his hold.
Then he is gone, disappearing out the door and leaving Mr Malfoy to slump back into his bed, looking just as miserable as Harry had sounded.
Bloody hell that was close.’
? You’re
enjoying it). ‘I better get back to practice before they come looking for me.’
He traces the scars back down Harry’s back and settles his hands on Harry’s hips, pulling him closer.

Carefully, as if he’s worried the whole thing might disappear, he unties the clumsily tied bow, edges a finger beneath the edge poorly wrapped paper and pries it loose. Paper crinkles away to the floor to reveal a brightly coloured box, illustrated with various depictions of stick figure people on the front.
He clenches his jaw, staring hard at her, wondering if she’s really asking
Harry seems to hesitate. He looks down at the vial in his hands as if he’s unsure what to do with it.
‘If you want to know, just ask,’ she says.
She nods. ‘Yes,’ she says. ‘I want Draco to tell him about his task, to help him find a way out of it.’
Draco leans up on his elbow. Harry’s gaze flickers over to him, squinting in an attempt to make him out without his glasses. Draco sits up. He pulls on his tie, tugging it loose and undoing it completely.
‘Er…right,’ says Harry, and glances down at the book. ‘Do…do you really think I need this book?’
‘Did you see the
she hisses, darting out and capturing the mouse, crushing it between her jaws.
‘Draco,’ says Severus again.
Draco rolls his eyes, tucking his wand back up his sleeve. He flicks Harry a scowl.
Ron startles. ‘Oh, your—? Right, yes, okay.’
Swallowing, her gaze darting to Harry and back to Ron, she nods. ‘Alright,’ she says feeling tears sting her eyes. ‘Alright.’
it. Not with the paper all scrunched up like that and—
‘Wait are you—? Ah shit, look Harry, mate, don’t…don’t get upset, yeah? I’ll try. Really I will.’
‘No! No I can’t. Because that’s what everyone else does!’
Draco glances back. Luna can see the snide comment on the tip of his tongue and in the arch of his brow, but before the biting words pass his lips, his expression changes. A glint of amusement enters his eyes and with the casual air of someone up to no good he says, ‘She caught Potter and I snogging one night and blackmailed us into a weekly date-night with her.’
Theo rolls his eyes and resumes getting ready for class, deciding that the best course of action is to pretend that none of them are there. After all, that’s how Draco has been treating
Hagrid glances back at the other students, still hanging back from the disappearing meat, and chuckles. ‘No fear o’ that I think.’
‘I’ll deal with him,’ Malfoy says over his shoulder, hauling Harry by the back of his robes and pulling the door shut behind him. He turns his head and mutters, ‘Don’t you dare throw up on me, Potter.’

‘Actually Longbottom’s over there,’ says Draco. ‘You unobservant nit.’
‘Harry!’ Ron gasps, and darts forward, his wand in his hand.
‘Oh,’ she says. ‘So…things really have changed, then?’
Hannah takes a deep breath and nods. ‘Alright,’ she says in a small voice.
that Harry did it.’
‘If you respected
Potter glances at the small, low, innocent looking fence and the parklands beyond with a dubious expression. Malfoy sees it and smirks but doesn’t say anything to further his point.
Draco stares at him. ‘You
‘Ginny?’ calls Ron, ‘Are you okay?’
Severus sneers. ‘Well, if you’re going to be stupid enough to lie to me—‘
Worry.
! Bloody hell, Potter, you really do have a death wish, don’t you?’
‘Git?’
Draco hummed. ‘I hope it’s more kissing.’
Potter shrugs, closes the book and hands it back. ‘Sure,’ he says. ‘I prefer the movie anyway.’
‘What is this?’ she asks, a frown wrinkling her brow. ‘Are you making fun of me?’
‘No,’ says Urquhart. ‘But, well, you
‘You want to brew a potion, don’t you?’ she asks.
‘Well…uh, this thing with Malfoy,’ Ron breaks off and runs a hand through his hair. ‘Look I’m not gonna pretend that I understand, okay? Maybe you can forgive everything he’s done and all the shit he’s pulled—’
Weariness digs into Minerva. She looks around the room, at all the books and papers and ingredients scattered over the various surfaces of the usually neat and tidy room. Poppy is an intensely organised woman until there is a remedy she can’t quite crack, then organisation turns into chaos. Minerva knows better than to try and tidy up or help. When Poppy goes into research mode she’s like a dragon building a nest. It may seem messy to an outsider, but there is a method to her chaos, and—like all mother dragons—if her territory is encroached she tends to get a little…enraged.
‘What is it, darling?’ asks Narcissa, leaning over to get a better look.
The boy glances around. ‘Here?’ he flushes. ‘It’s just, I thought we could go somewhere less…crowded.’
but I don’t care. You’re the one constantly telling me to stand up for what I want and what I want is you. I can’t explain it. I can’t justify it. I just want you
‘Well,’ says Potter, and scrubs a hand through his hair. ‘That explains that. I just…I never thought I could be both. Hell I never thought I was gay until…until…’
Harry straightens from the books he’s looking at and leans one shoulder against the shelves. ‘Wait,’ he says, eyeing Malfoy with raised eyebrows. ‘You actually go to study break?’
‘Just hurry,’ he says.
Harry grins. ‘You’re keeping track of what I eat?’
‘Not,’ he says. ‘You know at least four different people I’ve never met before have come spoken to me tonight?’
revolve around Potter and Malfoy.’
Harry blinks. Well, he’s never heard
Draco shrugs one shoulder. Without looking at Harry, he holds out a pastry. Harry takes it without thinking. It’s sticky and crumbly and Harry’s mouth waters just looking at it.
Malfoy raises a dubious eyebrow, until Tonks says, ‘Pinky, actually.’
‘Would that I could, Potter,’ laughs Draco. ‘Would that I could.’
He looks around, watching Malfoy’s retreating back, his expression unreadable for once.
‘Well, okay, but I still don’t see how that leads you to think that he’s in a relationship with a Slytherin girl.’
‘Why would I notice how close they were sitting?’
She waits for him to speak, to break the quite scratch of her quill with whatever is bothering him. She knows better than to push him. He’s like a thestral. Quiet, mistrusting and easily spooked. He has to come to her. Just like with the panic attacks, and the crush on Malfoy.
. And you don’t even
Draco sighs. He pushes up onto his knees and knocks the scrubbing brush out of Harry’s hand. Harry glances up at him, that sad little smile playing on his lips, and Draco suddenly wants nothing more than to make that expression go away.
‘You know,’ says Draco, shutting his book and standing up. ‘Think I’ll go to bed.’
‘Compatibility?’
Harry chuckles and shakes his head. ‘He’s never going to let me live this down,’ he says, and runs a hand through his hair. ‘Hell, he’s never going to let me see that bloody photo. Stupid git.’
Not really.
Potter falters. ‘Oh.’
She shrugs. ‘Look, the way I figure it,
Just like that, she has her boy back, and though she’s relieved, she can’t help but look back at the small box of books sitting on the couch, and feel a lingering tinge of jealousy.
When she looks back at him, he flushes crimson and concentrates on his coffee, taking a sip with far more concentration than is required.
Her dark eyes gleam with excitement and madness, her manic smile turning her face from a beauty to someone dark and twisted. She steps forward, her eyes fixated on Potter, her wand raising.
The boy beams. ‘Great! Thank you, really. I really appreciate it.’
‘Zach,’ interrupts Professor Burbage, and gives him a rueful smile. ‘Potter is right. It’s not a gun.’
seeing the Medi-Witch look tired before. Her hair falls in wisps out of it’s customary bun, her shoulders are tense, and she holds herself with a strained kind of exhaustion.
‘Nothing important,’ he says.
She draws level with him and keeps her voice low. ‘Actually, it’s about the attack…and how Harry went missing.’
‘Yeah,’ he says, getting supremely annoyed—especially as he’s just noticed these girls are from his own house. ‘Ginny Weasley?

Blaise raises an eyebrow and nudges Theo pointedly in the ribs. ‘Theo,’ he hisses, nudging him more when the sullen boy doesn’t look up. ‘Do you
‘Won Won!’ she calls, waving a hand at him.
‘Good,’ she says and, despite his attitude, feels as if she’s made some small modicum of progress.
. Especially considering neither of them had ever taken the course before.
Draco drops his bag by the end of the bed and then collapses face first into his pillow without even bothering to pull shut his curtains.
An older boy stands there, a friendly smile on his face. He’s a seventh year, though Harry’s not sure they’ve ever spoken before.
‘Malfoy’s don’t “puke”
Potter sighs and looks down. He glances over at Malfoy and, with a reluctant smile, pulls his hand free and steps away from the wall.
seeing as we must continue working together. I hope am sure you understand.
A soft sob rocks through Harry’s body. He turns and leans against the wall, looking back up at the ceiling, looking desperately like he’s trying to hold back a flood of tears.
‘You don’t expect me to bring this to you, do you?’ Malfoy asks, cocking an eyebrow and glancing across at Harry’s back.
Draco shrugged. ‘Maybe we should shut the fuck up and kiss already?’
Theo snorts. ‘Fat chance in hell.’
,’ he says, mumbling now, his eyes wide and his breathing growing rapid. ‘How could I not
With a strangled groan, Gregory Goyle drops down onto the bed opposite Malfoy and buries his face in his hands, muttering into his hands. ‘Too close, that was too close. Way too close.’
Malfoy’s hair is in disarray, there’s a gash on his temple, he has two black eyes and a swollen lip.
Harry leans back against the sinks, arms crossed and pouting. ‘Then why’d you follow me?’
Harry flushes. ‘We don’t have skates,’ he insists.
Shaking hands with a Slytherin over a bet she’s just placed on her best friend feels more than a little surreal, but Hermione takes it in stride. She’s sure that, with Zabini and Nott’s insights, that she can figure out this mystery.
Blaise gives him a thumbs up. Greg flips him off. They both wait for the inevitable explosion of Malfoy temper. Except…instead of bursting up out of bed to rant and rave about whatever injustice has befallen him, Draco merely rolls over to stare up at the canopy of his bed.
Neville, sensing that this argument might go on for some time, tries to creep backwards a step.
Ginny gives herself a little shake. ‘Alright,’ she says. ‘What do we do?’
Draco raises an eyebrow. ‘Those relatives of yours really did a number on you didn’t they?’
‘Milly and Ginny,’ says Ginny, her eyes going faraway, even as she squeezes Romilda’s hand. ‘Oh that has a nice ring to it, don’t you think?’
‘Yes, you are! You’re the most infuriating, obnoxious, irritating person I’ve ever met!’
Draco raises one eyebrow, glaring and Potter—turning a rather amusing shade of bright pink, hastily ducks down to pick them up and place them back on the bench. He shifts his weight from foot to foot, eyes flashing over to Draco and away again, cheeks so red Draco’s surprised they don’t melt right off him.
‘Don’t patronise me!’ she snaps, turning away. ‘I know what this was. Lucius’ punishment for failing to get the prophecy. Well I won’t sit idly by and watch my son become someone else’s pawn in this
‘You…are you still here?’
He pulls Ginny up the staircase and shoves into the boys dorm. Neville—sitting on the floor with a few odd looking plants Ginny hasn’t seen before—startles.
‘Don’t get so embarrassed,’ Draco chides. ‘I like the way you taste.’
‘You don’t know anything,’ he says evenly. ‘You have no evidence.’
what this is about?’ asks Ginny, and she laughs harshly. ‘You’re jealous?’
He whimpers and rolls onto his side. His senses try to orient themselves. Voices echo, but the relentless rush of blood in his ears makes it hard to focus.

‘But…of course we are,’ says Ginny, her eyes going wide, her face paling.
go to his table. He goes instead to Gryffindor.
enjoyable, but, then again, they’re both smiling.
Her breath catches and for the barest moment her mind goes blank. She forgets her irritation. She forgets Ron and Ginny teasing her. She stares into those vivd green eyes, gazes at the soft curve of his lips, is overwhelmed by the smell of fresh earth and coffee and treacle.
Harry frowns at the floor and shrugs half heartedly. ‘A mistake?’ he offers. ‘I dunno. I dunno what to say. I’m just…things are…different.’
A few people chuckle, Malfoy rolls his eyes and Hermione frowns.
‘Like that walkman for one,’ laughs Potter.
want is for you to do anything your not comfortable doing. I can take care of myself. Frankly it wouldn’t be any fun if I knew you weren’t enjoying it.’
‘No, Madam Pomfrey,’ Potter says quickly, glaring pointedly at his friends.
‘No,’ scowls Malfoy, kicking at the cauldron. ‘It wasn’t your bloody fault. Fuck’s sake.’
At the moment, however, the boy is busy yelling at Potter.
‘I…okay,’ he says, trying not to let his feelings show in his voice. ‘Sorry, I…I didn’t mean to…’ he trails off, not exactly sure what he’s done wrong.
She shifts, the very image of
Potter doesn’t respond, though there’s a rustle of clothing and Tonks has the distinct impression that he’s shrugged. Eventually he says, ‘that was the first time I ever spoke to a snake.’
He yanks the sleeve of his school shirt up. Cold shivers up Luna’s spine, her shoulders tensing at the sight of the tangled knot of scars splayed across a dull, inky black tattoo.
Draco flushes, but his shoulders stay stubbornly straight, his jaw set in determination as he peers up at Harry. ‘I found a way for us to fix the issue with our potions experiment, but I need your help.’
Draco vanishes the thin blades of ice as they step over onto the grass, and Harry sighs with relief as his feet meet sturdy ground. He hangs onto Draco’s hand a moment longer than necessary, reluctant to let go. Draco’s grip is firm and oddly comforting, fitting neatly into Harry’s own hand. Harry swallows and releases the other man.
‘You mean dark magic?’ Draco clarifies. ‘You’d resort to that, to save him?’
Surprise shoots up her spine like an electric shock, rattling her down to her bones. ‘No,’ she says. ‘What happened?’
‘M’not awake. Sleep. Dreams. ‘Sides, you’re closest.’

Draco closes his eyes, trying not to sigh. He’d come here to get

‘So?’
Theo leans back in his chair and without turning around says, ’How bad is it?’
The second one happens in Potions. He’s trying to ask Malfoy
‘Hey, did you see what happened this morning?’
Malfoy, taking this far too seriously, smirked and gave Harry’s fingers a brief squeeze. ‘Scared, Potter?’
The window display where he’d left Draco is already empty, the mass of people having bolted. Severus scans the fleeing people for a flash of that white hair, but his godson is nowhere to be seen.
,’ Ron grumbles. ‘So I no, I guess I don’t.’
Blaise frowns. He looks at Greg. ‘You were up early this morning, did you see him?’
‘Prat,’ Malfoy retorts.
‘Alright, alright,’ he says with a chuckle. ‘Never mind the weather, aye? You’re as bad as he is.’
‘Oh? Just fine?’ she asks, and a faint smirk twitches at the edges of her lips. ‘Not sure I’d be satisfied with just fine if I were you.’
‘Well then whose are they?’
A wicked smile spreads across the other woman’s face, her eyes glittering behind her glasses. She merely offers Poppy a wink before throwing the floo powder and disappearing back to her own offices.
Except, as she nears the figure, she realises that it’s
Malfoy scoffs, then winces as Poppy’s spell closes two of the gashes.
I don’t see how it can.
She glowers at him, her fists clenched at her sides. ‘Did you just call me stupid?’ she snarls.
Katie shakes her head and rubs her hands together. ‘Nothing,’ she says. ‘It doesn’t matter. Let’s get up in the air before we freeze.’
‘Admit it,’ says Theo, not looking away from Draco. ‘Admit that you’re in love with him.’
‘Oh, they’ve been everywhere in the castle,’ she says. ‘But I wouldn’t worry. They’re definitely on the move now.’
‘Of course it is,’ says Draco, shooting him a sideways look.
‘Where’s Mr Potter?’ she asks.
The problem begins, as it most usually does, with Just Harry. Luna detects a hint of Wrackspurts lurking around him at the start of the year. However, by the third week, that hint has become a full blown infestation.
A bang echoes through the room and both wands go flying out of Harry and Ron’s hands. Everyone in the room goes still, including the two fighting boys, who turn to stare at whoever has intervened.
To his surprise, Malfoy smiles back. It's small and uncertain and...kind of endearing. His eyes crinkle at the edges, the steel grey softening into something warmer and he's almost attractive, like this.
Malfoy quickly follows suit, standing up and stepping away from Potter.
Hope you enjoyed finally getting an insight into our Slytherin Prince - though, I'm not totally satisfied with the way it came out, hope you guys enjoyed it anyways.
She blinks.
She sighs and turns away, but just before she leaves she turns back and says, ‘You know, it’s kind of funny. Potter and Malfoy…they’re almost like opposites. Funny what can happen when two people put aside their differences, isn’t it?’
Draco raises a brow and then winces. Along with the split lip, he has a cut across his brow and the start of a black eye. Harry leans forward to inspect it, frowning.
Cold slams into her, and it’s all she can do to keep hold of the breath in her chest. She can taste salt on her lips, but she braces herself and opens her eyes. They burn instantly, but she squints against the salt water and sees Harry floating in the water just feet from her, his heavy quidditch gear dragging him down.
‘Of course I did,’ says Malfoy without batting an eyelash, ‘Why do you think I lent it to you?’
Harry shrugs it off, rolling his ankle around in a circular motion to ease away the remainder of the already-fading pain. He tests his weight on it and only feels a minor twinge. He grins at Draco.
Tonks tunes out the show. She’s never been overly interested in magical creatures (aside from watching Charlie Weasley’s antics during class) and if she’s honest, snakes just creep her out.
Draco takes a sip and—to Blaise’s immense amusement—doesn’t even notice.
Harry glances up and shrugs. ‘Actually, it wasn’t that bad,’ he says. ‘I mean, I was feeling kinda bad anyway, about skipping out on Hagrid’s class.’
‘It is if you consider who he has the crush
Draco narrows his eyes. ‘Barely? What do you mean
sex before. But describing every detail? Every feeling?
‘Can I have Blue, too?’
Hermione frowns at him. ‘Harry, where’s your bag?’
‘What?’ Draco blinks, his attention refocusing on Blaise with a tad of irritation and more than a little distraction. ‘What do you want?’
‘You just need to relax a little, here, I’ll go get you a drink. I’m sure someone’s spiked it by now. Maybe
Poppy leans her elbow on the desk. ‘I’m not sure what you mean,’ she says slyly. ‘I simply want a little peace and quiet in here. Do you know how many arguments I’ve had to listen to the last few days?’
Tonks snags his arm, ‘No, it’s alright,’ she says, pulling him to a stop. ‘Look, I’m not gonna lie, some days it’s hard. But you gotta push through it, do your job.’
Ron stares after him. What the hell?
‘Er, right,’ says Harry. ‘Well, uh…like Malfoy said we, uh, got it working. And, well, I kinda thought we had to be more detailed with what Muggles use stuff for so, uh,’ he flushes, and runs a hand through his hair again. ‘Well, I brought this CD I made. See, Muggles have this custom to make what they call mixtapes. They put all these specific songs on a CD, and give it to someone they like, and the idea is to make the person to listening to the songs think of the person who gave them the CD.’
She examines her nails. ‘I see. Well, I guess you won’t be interested in the rumours about some boy snogging him the other night.’
‘Yeah, if you’re an idiot,’ Harry scowls.
‘I thought you said you
‘Well, I mean it’s
Ron, who had been staring at Luna and Draco’s clasped hands with a perplexed frown, shakes himself, looking up with wide brown eyes. ‘Er, yeah. Like I said, I figure Pomfrey keeps pretty detailed notes, right? I thought, if we could look at his file, maybe we could see something she’s missed? I mean, the curse is rare, right? So maybe she doesn’t know everything…maybe…maybe we can find a way to help him. We have to, right? There has to be
‘Bloody hell, I wish I could fly like that,’ says Blaise from next to Draco, staring up at Potter.
Colin nods quickly. ‘Uh, yeah. Yes!’
As soon as she turns around to face Harry, she blurts it out. ‘
He’s almost at the door to the greenhouse when Harry calls out after him. Panic overwhelms Neville and before he has a chance to think about what he’s doing he dives between a couple of large, bulbous purple blossoms by the greenhouse door. He squeezes his eyes shut and prays that they won’t see him.
‘Hey!’ Harry yells.
The potion beside him begins to bubble, but Draco doesn’t take his eyes of Severus. With a start, Severus realises that he doesn’t trust him. Not even to deal with an unstable potion.
Potter grumbles something incoherent and vaguely distressed.
Draco rolls his eyes, but takes a sip. ‘Me drinking this does not mean I forgive you,’ he sniffs.
He pushes up from the bed and steps between them, almost tripping in his too-big pyjama pants—as if no one has ever bought him clothes that fit properly—and, though Theo’s parents have always been meticulous of his presentation, the knowledge behind that…the fact that there was no one in Potter’s life that cared enough to dress him appropriately. It sends a simultaneous surge of pity and irritation up Theo’s spine.
‘Jesus,’ Potter says and scrubs a hand through his hair. ‘Dean, trust me, there is
‘Nothing,’ he says, slouching down in his seat and dropping his gaze. ‘Can’t sleep.’
