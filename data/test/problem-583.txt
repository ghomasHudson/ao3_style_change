“I did.” He responded. He took another gulp of his coffee, pushing it away. “We know each other, in passing obviously, on and off the pitch. Ran into each other more than once. Apparently, you texted me, after our last match.”
Harry put on Shrek, which Draco had passed twice. He apparently wasn’t as picky as Draco seemingly was. The food was from a restaurant Draco didn’t recognise, and Harry had gotten him a chicken burger, fries, and a milkshake, which was the same as what he’d gotten himself.
He was still watching Harry when his eyes began to flutter open, and he began blinking as he adjusted to the lower light in the room. Draco didn’t bother looking away or loosening his grip on him. It was almost comforting to just hold him in his arms.
Draco rolled his eyes, sinking slightly, He threw a leg over Harry’s, leaning into him ever so slightly. The flash went off, brightening the room for a split second before it fell into darkness again. He tapped away for a second, before holding the phone out to Draco.
They bid their farewells very quickly, the screen reverting back to his desktop. Harry shut the screen, looking at Draco. “Easy.”
Draco replayed the event in his mind. He hadn’t seen Cedric move. It had taken him completely by surprise. “Well, I never want to see him again.”
“You came all the way my fucking training to ask me this? Fucking hell!” Draco ran a hand through his hair, twisting away from the boy in exasperation. “Blaise and Theo fucking saw you, and they know I came out to talk to you, so what the fuck will I tell them now? Christ Potter, you never use your fucking head. Do you not have a phone?”
“Harry, you were a fabulous guest!” She draped her arms around him, pulling him into her for a hug, and a kiss on the cheek. “You come by anytime! You must need breaks from the miserable git that is your ‘
It was a short kiss, Draco pulling away within a few seconds, smirking at the surprised look on Harry’s face. “Must dash. I was meant to meet Pansy an hour ago.”
“Thank you.” Draco sighed. He wandered into her kitchen, Harry awkwardly following. He dropped the shopping bag on the counter, taking everything out of it, and loading up Pansy’s fridge.
“Mhm, I do.” Harry decided. He nudged Draco’s arm, slightly, drawing his attention. “Act happy. You can go home and mope later, but you know as well as I do that Minerva will kill you if you look so unhappy in pictures.”
“I don’t know. I mean.. I don’t know how long this thing is meant to last. I don’t know what’s meant to happen. I feel like it would be awkward if we start sleeping together regularly.” He sighed. He picked up the coffee. He hated trying to clutch his phone between his shoulder and his ear as he held his basket in one hand and grabbed groceries with the other. But he couldn’t end their conversation. He felt desperate to talk to his best friend who was possibly at a party if he could hear the background noise correctly.
Minerva felt very set on the matter, really. She had apparently already discussed it with his publicist, extensively. It was all set in motion unless Draco was to object. But the glare she supplied told him that he wasn’t meant to object. “Draco, your playing is good, and so is your attitude towards the game. But this party-boy attitude you have is ruining your reputation. You won’t get sponsors, you won’t get team offers. Man City could want you next season, but with the social attitude you’ve gone with, no one will want you. Even Slytherin will drop you! You need this relationship, if not to distract from the partying, but to give you some actual status. Draco Malfoy the slut won’t sell many tickets, but Draco Malfoy, who dates his rival, and seems to actually care for the game… He’ll sell tickets, and ad deals, left, right and centre. Trust me.”
“Yeah, you do. You just pretend you don’t,” his voice was full of honesty, and his eyes seemed to look right through Draco.
Draco dished up the food, handing each of them a bowl, and moving towards the small dining room table, which they all sat around. The pasta was perfectly made, and they all dug in happily, Pansy and Harry seeming to enjoy it.
They made it to bed in the early hours of the morning, silent goodnights being nodded at each other as they disappeared into their rooms.
“I order my shopping online. Comes once a week. Pansy forgets to buy her food, and will starve if I don’t buy it for her.” He swung the fridge shut, looking back at Harry. “Coffee?” He nodded, mechanically. “Pansy, coffee?” Draco called.
Draco rolled his eyes. He wasn’t really in the mood for a childish fight, even though he had started it with name-calling. Harry was watching him, on one side, while Cho stared from the other. But he couldn’t back down now. He shrugged, easily, eyebrows raising ever so slightly. “I called you Dickory because you’re acting like a real fucking
When they emerged to the street, a few flickers of recognition appeared on passerby’s faces. Draco ignored them, though. He removed his hand when they were around the corner, back on the main road where he could hail a taxi. “I have early training today, but here.” Draco handed over one of the bags.
“Well, you don’t have to. Knowing how someone thinks, and what someone thinks are different things. If you know what his instincts are, you’ll know his next move with a ball.” She reached for a carton of Draco’s fries, shovelling a few into her mouth. “This could be career-changing if it’s not life-changing.”
He fell onto the armchair he usually occupied at her place, while Harry awkwardly stood just beside the couch. Pansy finally looked up, flinching slightly with the shock of Harry. “Fuck me, you brought Potter?”
She looked unsure as to what to say, so she nodded, looking away. Cedric made small talk with her, which Draco couldn’t hear, and didn’t care about. He leaned his arm on the back of Harry’s chair, raising an eyebrow as he looked at him. “Okay?” He mouthed, once he had Harry’s attention.
“I have a proposition for you, Draco,” Minerva smiled. Draco felt his heart sink, but he couldn’t move. “Harry Potter is getting his name in the papers against you, but for no other reason. His publicist, and I, have been in discussions for a while, and we think we’ve come up with a plan.”
Draco probably could have slept till dinner, but his phone ringing stirred him from his rest. He flinched at the initial noise, his hand shooting out to grab it from his bedside table. It wasn’t there though. It was in the pocket of his trousers, across the room. Harry was beginning to stir from his side, but Draco couldn’t wait for him to fully wake up before he pulled his arm away from him, almost tripping up as he flew towards his phone.
Draco sucked in a breath, looking at his hand and then back at Harry. “Okay. Let’s talk about Percy Jackson.”
“Perfect got it!” Pansy turned back to them, beaming. Draco frowned at her, while Harry gave her a small smile, moving back to his glass.
“Very,” Draco shrugged. He finally ate a spoonful of his cereal, almost wincing at how bland it tasted.
He straightened, slowly, running a hand through his hair, and adjusting his t-shirt. He was only in sweatpants, nothing exciting. If it were someone he cared about, he’d be desperate to change. But as it was only Harry, he disregarded opinion on his outfit and swung the door open again.
“What are you doing here?” Draco found himself asking, attempting to sound affectionate, rather than horribly frustrated with everything.
“What’s this for?” Draco asked, moving slightly. His couch was an L shape, and he awkwardly threw his legs beside Harry’s.
“They say you never know until you try it.” He repeated his action, eating another fry. Draco gingerly pulled the lid off his own drink, plucking a fry from its box. He swiped the fry into his drink, eating it slowly, and frowned. “What?”
“Did you do drama at school?” Harry’s question surprised him. They were out on the street, Soho waking up to start their days of drinking and partying.
“Indeed,” Cedric looked over their shoulder, momentarily losing interest. Draco felt like shifting from foot to foot but stopped himself. “Apologies, gentlemen. My date requires my attention.” He rose his hand, slightly, sidestepping around them. Draco rolled his eyes in his absence, while Harry turned his head to watch him leave.
The plan, in Draco’s opinion, was fucking terrible. To fake date Potter, who was a complete twat to him, to create better press for both of them. As long as neither of them compared game plans for the games they were meant to actually play, they were meant to be fine. Harry would get good press by being ‘out and proud', and dating a rival, while Draco would get good press just for dating one bloke at a time, and keeping off the coke.
“Well, I suggest you get rid of them before Harry arrives. He’ll spend the night in your guest room, so he can get pictured leaving tomorrow. And during your dates, this week, try to touch more. Maybe hold hands. Something.”
Draco rolled his eyes, instantly. Of course, he did. Slytherin and Gryffindor had been in competition with each other for years. The top two teams in London, constantly in a battle for the Champions League. It was between them, most of the time. And Harry, their striker, the same position as Draco, was just as good as him. Everyone on Twitter buzzed about them, and articles had been written about them thousands of times. They were set against each other almost every week in the press, no matter how they played. “Yes,” he answered.
Harry let go of his hand as they walked inside, looking around. An usher herded them towards the main ballroom, where the dinner was usually held. Draco shuffled alongside Harry, still unsure what to say, or do. The ballroom was lavish, and huge, with tables everywhere. Team managers, board members, players, and their partners, all wandered around the room. Dinner wasn’t being served for a while yet, apparently, but Draco still checked the board by the door, scanning for his name. There was meant to be a sort of socialisation that went into these things, different teams mingling with each other. It meant that each table had a very random mix.
“Lupin and I have decided that you’ve laid down enough groundwork. We need more. Obviously, still don’t talk to the press, but we need more. Harry’s on his way over-“
They watched Fantastic Mr Fox in silence and then started Flushed Away. Pansy claimed her week had been stressful, so she needed to fill her brain with animation to make herself feel better. Harry and she made occasional small talk, commenting on the films, and the weather, and the city, and what sort of mood Draco was in as he glared at the tv.
“They dropped by a bit earlier,” she innocently shrugged. She lifted her coffee cup to her lips, taking a sip, as she gestured with her other hand for him to sit. He sat slowly, keeping his eyes low. He felt embarrassed by his outburst, but not embarrassed enough to apologise. “Draco, this is Remus Lupin.”
“Cho really liked going for Indian food, and playing Wii bowling,” Harry admitted. “And Cedric liked to watch French films, and go on jogs.”
“Exactly. We’ve known each other for almost three years and never shared a kind word. I figured it would be easier to get to know you like this.” His honesty surprised Draco, but he tried not to let that show. “It’s worked so far.”
“No!” He said it too quickly, and the sleepy tipsy eyes of his friends were on him now. “Promised the room to Pansy tonight, sorry. She’s got something on this side of town. She’ll let herself in when I’m asleep.”
“Of course, yes, of course. That’s £40, please.” Draco slid him the money, watching as he slipped a jacket into each bag, which he handed across the counter to him. Draco didn’t wait for him to speak again, instead turning back to find Harry, who was still perusing.
He turned more, lying on his side fully as he stared at Harry. “I had a nice time, okay? I don’t usually enjoy those things, but last night was fun. Being punched was just a side effect of having fun, okay? Stop blaming yourself for this.”
“Don’t.” Draco had woken up with a missed call from Pansy, and an irritated feeling bubbling beneath the surface. He felt as if he hadn’t slept, even though he had. His shower hadn’t woken him as he’d hoped, and his hair was still damp, and slowly drying in a wavy way that he despised. His Uber had been late, his mother had called when he was on the way, and now Harry was trying to make conversation. He wanted to scream.
“You couldn’t spare five minutes to call me, and tell me about your boyfriend?” She said the word with hesitation. He winced.
“That’s where you’re wrong, Potter,” Draco murmured, almost breathing it against his lips. Harry’s eyes darted between his eyes and his lips, before he leaned closer, his mouth brushing against the side of Draco’s. A small kiss, tiny, and over in seconds, as he pulled away.
The small stage at the top of the room had Lee Jordan standing atop it. He had volunteered to MC, as he had done before. The nominees all stood, beginning to get ready to be auctioned off. Cedric, Blaise, Theo, and the Ravenclaw all wandered up, along with other familiar faces. Ron, Neville, and several others that Draco recognised stood onstage. Lee began the banter, drawing the audience in, as waiters dropped off paddles.
“No! He was.. There. And so was I. And we had nice dinner, and ended up at my place,” he tried to explain.
“Probably. Most boyfriends do that sort of thing when they’re adults..” Harry shrugged. Draco sighed, the situation making him uneasy in a way, while the boy beside him joined in. “Look, it’s not ideal. But sooner rumours spread, sooner papers pick it up, sooner we get good press, and then we can go back to hating each other. Simple.”
He pulled some bacon from the fridge and some butter. “Well, I’m kind of… I’m learning more about him!” He defended.
Minerva nodded, scribbling the name down. She looked at Harry, her pen hovering. “Hermione Granger,” he supplied. Draco knew of her. She was a student, and close with him and his friend Ron. Apparently, she was studying to be a teacher, although Draco wasn’t sure. He didn’t care to know either way.
“Are you two holding hands under the fucking table?” Ron looked disgusted, yet amused. As if he were happy for his friend, yet disgusted by his choice of relationship. That was the reaction Draco expected from his own friends. But he didn’t get that.
He got out of the car, shuffling into the players' entrance, following the hallway until he ended up in the dressing rooms. His teammates were already getting changed, their jerseys. He dropped his bag in front of his cubby, already pulling his jacket off, and his t-shirt along with it. Blaise walked in with Theo, both of them laughing to themselves, jointing Draco on either side, as he pulled on his jersey.
Draco woke up with a headache and a dull throb behind his eye. He blinked a few times, looking around the spare bedroom that Harry had stuck him in the night before. The curtains hadn’t been drawn, and the light almost blinded him. He twisted around a few times, digging himself further into the duvet, groaning in pain with his head. The soft knock on the door sounded like a hammer to his head.
“It’s not!” He began plucking things from the shelves, attempting to think of what to make for dinner. He had no real plans. Dinner for one was usually just noodles. He needed general groceries too.
“And, I don’t know, the other week when you asked about what I liked to do, it was a slight wake up call. Like, we didn’t do a lot of what I wanted to do, and he didn’t ask much about me.. It’s taken a while for me to say, so it’s getting slightly
Draco leaned in, quicker than anticipated, his lips pecking the side of Harry’s cheek. “You’re disgusting.” Harry threw his head back, laughing. Draco watched, with amusement, something twisting in his stomach. He ignored it.
Pansy was beginning a string of protests, but Draco silenced her by hanging up, pocketing his phone as he walked towards the counter, putting down the shopping bag. “Good training?” Harry questioned.
It’s big news.” She clapped her hands on the other end of the line. “You’re good, Draco, I’ll have to admit. I’m very impressed. And Pansy’s Instagram was certainly a nice touch. I assume she came up with that one.”
“You’re welcome.” Harry leaned in, ever so slightly. His lips brushed over Draco’s cheek, before he pulled away, opening his own door, while Draco walked around the car, opening his own. Harry stuffed the bag on the back seat, and Draco bid his friends farewell with a small wave, which they returned, as the couple slammed the doors, and Harry took off.
“Definitely,” Draco confirmed. His eyes flickered from Harry’s gaze to his lips, a temptation coming over him.
“Charmed, I’m sure.” Remus flashed him a grin. They shook hands, quickly, Draco leaning forward to do so, and quickly leaning back.
“Mhm. You haven’t tried to kill me yet, and I know you a lot better than before.” An ambulance passed, loud sirens blaring as it went.
“What do you want from me?” Draco huffed too, stopping tapping his torso. “We can go out clubbing if you want. Or to the fair? Maybe fly to Disney land!”
“Maybe,” Draco smirked, as a boyfriend would if he were teasing. Harry rolled his eyes, amusement playing over his features.
“Better ones than before,” Harry spoke as if it were obvious. Draco supposed it was, but he hadn’t taken enough notice, obviously. He rose an eyebrow at Draco, waiting for a response.
“I was just saying, maybe, you should be in charge of this whole... Act.” His voice dropped with the final word, his eyebrows raising. “You tell me what to do, I’ll do it. I’m a fast learner.”
“Then we better have a good story, won’t we.” He groaned. He regretted answering without thinking it over more, but it was too late. He would have to face it.
Harry, he realised, was silently observing too. The illogical part of his brain said that they didn’t need to join in on the conversation. But the logical part of his brain said they did, or at least they needed to speak to each other. They looked very non-couply, just sat beside one another, not speaking. He nudged his knee against Harry’s, eyebrows raising as the boy looked at him, a curious look on his face too.
“Don’t be a dick, Malfoy.” He pulled away fully, then, sitting back into his seat properly in time for the waiters to drop off soup starters at their table. Draco didn’t even notice Cedric’s eyes on them.
“Cmon, Harry,” George nudged him. Harry slowly lifted his head, blinking a few times as if he had been dozing. Maybe he had. Draco wasn’t sure.
Draco forced himself not to roll his eyes at the made-up sounding names of Harry’s supposed friends. Longbottom, Lovegood, and the Gryffindor defenders entire family. It was quite ridiculous. Oliver was the Gryffindor goalie, so Draco could tick him off the list of people he knew from the list, but apart from Ron and him, and Harry’s ex, Draco drew a blank on the rest. He imagined the Weasleys to look like Ron, but he tried not to think of that.
Harry waited for him outside the diner. He was on the phone when Draco got out of his Uber, taking no notice of his surroundings as he spoke. Draco slowly approached, finally catching the boys eye, as he continued speaking. “Look, seriously, I have a meeting. I’ll see you at training.” He pocketed his phone, raising his eyebrows in a greeting.
Pansy squinted for a second, the frown on her lips seeming a sure sign Draco should push him out of the apartment. But her face finally split into a smile, throwing her legs off the side of the couch, and patting it. “Sit! Sit! It’s so nice to meet you, properly.”
It was almost easy to forget that they had hated each other up until a few weeks ago. Their conversation flowed easily as if they were old friends. Or even partners in a relationship. It felt nice to sit across from one another and just talk as if they’d done so for years. And when they walked out together, it felt natural to keep the conversation going as Draco flagged a cab, and they both tumbled into it, ignoring the photographer that was snapping low-quality pictures of them. It didn’t even phase Draco that he was letting himself into his apartment with Harry following him, still laughing over some joke. It almost felt natural to shut his front door, and push Harry against it, his leg in-between Harry’s as he cupped the side of his face.
“Well, decide. Order it. Eat.” Draco huffed, stepping around him, falling onto the other side of the couch. He picked up the remote, putting more match highlights on. He had watched his own after the small celebrations his team had partaken in the night before and hated the critic's opinions on his perfectly good goals. He enjoyed watching the critics break down other players, though. Harry fiddled with his phone next to him, typing away at something while Draco felt glee at a critic praising him.
to actually do it, Potter.” Draco muttered. An ambulance sped down the street past him, the noise making him jump.
Camera’s went off, flashes blinding him as paparazzi shouted his name, desperate for some sort of answer to their questions of his relationship. He ignored them all, keeping his head high as he walked past them, already spotting his Uber, which he let himself into. The driver said a quiet hello, and was on his way, speeding past the building, and away from the paparazzi.
“Kind of,” Harry shrugged, adjusting to the topic. “I mean, it got kind of uncivil towards the end. We were too similar, but in a bad way, so we ended up snapping away at each other to the point of no return…”
The living space was empty, Harry nowhere in sight. If he was less tired, he probably would have attempted to snoop. He probably should be using his relationship to find out more about how Potter thinks and plays. But he didn’t bother with all that. He sat himself down by the counter and picked up the book that was lying there. He almost jumped when he realised it was his favourite book, The Secret History.
Draco subtlety looked over his shoulder, his eyes falling upon Cedric standing over the famous model ex of Harry Potter. She looked stunning, of course, in a blue cocktail dress. She seemed to be completely unaware of Draco’s eyes on her, so he quickly turned, his eyes back on Harry. “Okay, well. That’s not ideal.”
, why the fuck did he bring her?!” He sounded tired all of a sudden, and almost pained. Draco reflexly pulled his arm from his waist, bringing it up to cup his neck, directing him to look at him.
“I heard of that,” Blaise nodded, pointing a finger at his friend. “My cousin always reads those books. She says the best romances are based on that trope, you know?”
“Text me during the morning. I need to seem like my boyfriend likes me enough to want to speak to me in the mornings,” Draco requested.
“This,” Draco shrugged. “This whole thing. I’m sitting in your fucking kitchen, pretending we’re on some sort of date, when a month ago I’d have hit you with my car if it meant winning a game.”
Harry ordered the Uber, and they ended up in the backseat of it ten minutes later, travelling to whatever restaurant Harry had chosen. Draco scrolled through his phone, surprised there was still a bit of battery left as he read through texts from Pansy asking if he was okay, emails from random companies, and a few Instagram messages. He gave Pansy a short reply, forwarded some emails to Minerva, and ignored the rest.
“What?” Harry almost jumped. The car was on its way, according to his phone, so they were both waiting in the kitchen, Harry leaning against the counter, while Draco leaned against the one opposite.
The dressing room was practically empty by the time he staggered back in. The last of the lads were tying their boots, rushing to get onto the pitch. Draco threw himself onto the bench, pulling off his ankle socks, and pulling on his shin guards, football socks, and boots, which he tied as quickly, and as tightly as he could. He quickly jogged out the door, jogging towards the pitch entrance, which was cleared. His coach glared at him as he arrived, raising an eyebrow in demand of where he had been. Draco simply promised it wouldn’t happen again, and joined the team for warm-up drills.
“Hello?” He finally answered, standing up properly. He could see his reflection in his wardrobe mirror. He looked a wreck, in just a pair of boxers with his hair a wreck, and hickeys on his collarbones. He glared at his reflection momentarily.
“Holy shit, man.” The boy behind repeated, shaking his head. “You’re amazing, man, proper good.” The other boy glanced at Draco, almost as if he hadn’t seen him before, jumping. “Oh my god, and you’re Draco Malfoy?”
“Draco,” Blaise started, and Draco began mentally preparing himself for a Harry Potter related lecture. But Blaise didn’t appear to know about the fan pictures that had appeared when you typed his name into Twitter. “Did you see that fucking tosser outside?”
The entire meal passed pleasantly. They had roast beef as their main, with all the classic sides, and they had a brownie with ice cream for dessert. Wine flowed throughout, along with whatever other drinks the table ordered. Draco was buzzed by the end of the meal, his head feeling a bit lighter than usual. He decided he wouldn’t get drunk, though. He needed his wits about him around Harry.
Eventually, Harry left the apartment, after pulling on yesterdays clothes, deeming them more appropriate. Draco watched him exit the apartment, unsure if he was meant to approach him at all. He decided against it, regretting it as the door closed behind him.
“You think of things, and I’ll show up and look pretty. Maybe kiss you along the way.” Draco crossed his arms, leaning them on the counter.
Reluctantly, they both stood up, stretching again. As they collected their things, Draco dragged his phone out texting Harry a request to wait for his word to come up, as he didn’t want any run-ins. “Will see you at training,” Draco promised.
Draco stopped reading, sliding his phone into his pocket. Harry Potter didn’t have these articles written about him. He was perfect. Golden child, chosen one. The names had been thrown towards him when he had just started out. He had shown no talent until suddenly he had. He had been scouted for Gryffindor at the same age as Draco had been scouted for Slytherin. It made sense that the 19-year-olds got pitted against each other. At 21, it wasn’t any better. Harry was still getting called glowing names, every goal scored boosting his standing. Draco was getting coined as a party boy, though, and it didn’t matter how many goals he scored, he was living in the shadow of the golden boy.
.” Harry retorted, crossing his arms on the table. His eyes were narrowed towards Draco, who rolled his. “You’re of a dick than usual.”
Draco glared at him, his head whipping back to the publicists. “See. They know how he is as well as I do. They won’t believe we suddenly became pals.”
Harry was waiting outside, arms folded, a hoodie on instead of the jumper he wore that morning. He straightened when he saw Draco, apparently finding who he was looking for, without really looking. “Hi."
“Come here! Sit beside me.” Harry slapped the cushion beside him. Draco awkwardly shuffled across, sitting next to him, a few inches between them. “Closer.”
Draco felt that was fair enough. He was usually bad at interviewing. One journalist had called him a pompous prick, while another labelled him a spoiled child. As easy as it was to discuss his plays on a field, it was painful to discuss his own everyday life. Fans were much easier to deal with.
“This is amazing,” Harry murmured his mouthful of food a few minutes later. He sat beside Draco, their elbows almost touching. “I can’t poach eggs.”
Harry looked up, shutting off his phone which he slipped into his pocket. “I’m telepathic. Didn’t I tell you?”
“Yes, I did. Now don’t drink too much, don’t do drugs, and remember we have lunch on Monday afternoon.” He reminded.
date…” Draco led off, still disgusted at the idea himself. He finally stopped pacing, grabbing a few fries from the table. He shoved them into his mouth with a reckless motion, chewing them quickly, not stopping to savour the taste. He grabbed the cardboard container of them, holding them in one hand as he continued to pace.
“You were page 13 of the Sun today. Coked and Cocked, Malfoy on the Rocks.” Pansy recited, shaking her head.
Theo and Blaise stared at Draco, waiting for him to say something, as he looked between his ‘boyfriend’ and his friends. “Uhm, would you like to sit?”
The t-shirt Draco pulled on was slightly wrinkled, and he winced as he noticed. He had no time to find another, though. He had drunk half a bottle of vodka with Pansy after they’d ordered more McDonald’s to the apartment. He still couldn’t leave, so the vodka and take away were the best he could do to distract himself from the horrible meeting he was getting ready for while hungover. Pansy was still asleep in the spare room when his alarm went off, his phone blaring a tone that he felt was unbearable and forced him out of his own bed. He shoved his feet into his shoes, glad that he didn’t have to stumble with tying the laces, and grabbed his phone from his bedside table.
“I can leave, though.. Anytime. You say the word and I’m gone, I swear it. I don’t want to be one of those people who just.. lingers when they’re unwanted. I get that we’re
“And kissing,” Harry added. Draco whipped his head towards him, trying not to be alarmed. “What? You said I know more about relationships than you, and I do. Same way as I know there’s a photographer across the road. He’s been following us for ages.”
Draco rolled his eyes, finally letting go of Harry. Pansy was eyeing Cedric from afar, a small frown on her perfectly lined lips. She seemed pained by the situation, but upon noticing Draco watching her, she smiled. “We should sit, I’m sure.”
Harry frowned, his eyebrows knitting together. “I didn’t ask your tactics. I’m making conversation.”
“If he was a better player, he could probably get into our league, and be on just as good a team as we are. But he’s not. I hate him.”
But Harry was already there, sitting in a chair next to his publicist, across from Minerva. He had an amused look on his face, apparently already entertained by their situation. Draco stopped, glared at him for a second before he looked back at Minerva. “You said 9 on the dot in that message last night!”
Harry narrowed his eyes, badly folding his sheet of paper without looking at it. “Sorry, we can’t all be pretentious dicks who list Christopher Nolan films as our favourite. Everyone knows Batman is his best work, not that shitshow.”
“Someone’s impatient,” Draco rolled his eyes, tugging him along. “Shopping first, you can kiss me later.”
Draco slowly rose his hand, gently pushing a strand of hair away from his forehead. “And let him miss us in all our committed glory? Where’s the fun in that?” He offered a small smile.
“That’s mad, I thought it was still impossible for humans to survive up there.” Draco rolled his eyes, huffing. “Do you not enjoy jokes in the morning, Malfoy?”
Draco went to training that afternoon, his teammates giving him strange looked, disbelieving. They were obviously shocked about the headlines. But Theo and Blaise, who constantly talked about homophobia amongst teams, glared at everyone who tried to broach the subject. His coach didn’t say a word on the matter, obviously not caring either way.
“Where are we going?” Harry questioned. He was fiddling with the sleeve of his jumper, staring at his own arm. Draco eyed him with a side glance.
“God, you’re adorable, aren’t you!” She pinched his cheek as a grandmother would. “This is so cute! Draco you brought your
“It’s not hurting anyone,” Draco muttered. He knew, instantly, that that was the wrong answer. Minerva, his publicist, narrowed her eyes. He opened his mouth to say more, but she shook his head.
“God, your last fight was tragic. The lads were taking bets on if you were going to punch him or fuck him,” Blaise explained.
“I think you two might be geniuses.” Minerva looked small on Harry’s laptop screen. His godfather also looked small. Harry and Draco looked tiny, though, the small box in the corner showing them sat at the kitchen counter. Lupin had been the one to call the meeting, claiming they needed to go over things, but it was safer to do on a call. Harry had agreed, and Draco had nodded along, watching him open his computer.
“What was that about?” Blaise questioned, eyebrow quirking when they were close enough to hear one another.
Harry followed him without question. They stood, facing each other, Harry seeming reluctant to speak, and Draco too stubborn to repeat his question. Harry finally gave in, shoving his hands in his pockets. “When did you last sleep with someone?”
“It’s boring. I read the Olympians series, and it was just… Fine. It was okay. I didn’t see it as anything special. It was simply a series of books. I finished them because I felt I had to, but they were just… Adequate.”
He was draining the noodles when Harry came back, knocking on the door three times. Draco called for him to come in, which he hesitantly did, looking at Draco instantly. He had a bag over his shoulder, and his glasses falling down his nose.
“We’ll be fine, remember?” He dropped his voice lower, almost whispering. “Put on an act for one, put on an act for all. We’ll be fine.” His thumb gently stroked his jaw.
Harry sipped the last of his coffee, while Draco began working on his second. “We’re going out after this.”
“What are your plans today, then?” Harry was clutching his cup of tea, looking at him. His glasses were still on, and slightly smudged. Draco felt the urge to pull them off and clean them. But he didn’t.
“God, Pansy. Stop reading those stupid fucking self-help books! You sound like a greeting card!” She burst into laughter at that, shaking her head. “I just don’t know what I’ve agreed to. This could be the biggest mistake of my life.”
Draco always liked playing the first game of the weekend, because it meant he could watch all the remaining matches in peace. Blaise and Theo usually came round to watch them, and sure enough, on Saturday morning, after their winning game the night before, they all ended up on his couch, the tv playing the next game while they drank and ate.
“Fine. But it cannot be anyone on the team. Football players have loudmouths, Draco, and we can’t let this get out. Once it starts, it will be a secret you take to the grave. The contract assures that.” She seemed to be writing something, the sound of her pen dragging across a page. “We’ll have a meeting, tomorrow morning, okay?”
They didn’t share niceties. They weren’t the type to wave at each other at events. They usually avoided each other or glared from a distance. They had had a few on pitch tackles that had gotten nasty, a few yellow cards being slapped towards them by referees. His coach had claimed him to be a ‘childish messer’ for his shouting matches that had occurred between them, while yellow cards were waved around. They were tragically typical finger pointers, jabbing their hands towards each other. Smug twat.
“Okay then.” Draco pulled his bag from his arm, holding it out to Harry, who gingerly took it, a fake smile on his face. “Thank you.”
Harry looked over, already out of his chair. Draco got up, cautiously following him. “It’s not like you’re poor, Cho. You could’ve afforded to bid a bit more. I think I’m worth more than 2 grand!”
Something twisted in Draco’s gut at the words, but he didn’t say anything. He simply walked out of the kitchen, deciding he needed a shower instead of thinking about Harry baking in his kitchen all day. His bed was made, and the clothes he’d dropped the night before had disappeared.
He looked over at him, a smirk on his face. “I meant the genre is mystery, bellend.” Harry's cheeks flamed for a second, his eyes dropping back to the sheet. “It’s good. Better than Percy Jackson, anyway.”
Draco racked his brain, trying to think of something smart to say. “I wanted to be sure because I had to put up with your slagging,” he shrugged.
He led the way, walking through the glass door that had a neon ‘Open’ sign glowing through. A young waitress silently led them to a booth, in the middle of the diner, and they each took their seats, across from one another. She left after the menus were dropped off, eager to meet the next duo of customers that lingered by the door.
“Rita Skeeter has her trolls on high alert for us,” Draco handed Harry his phone, watching the frown form on the boy's face. His cheeks were darker than usual, and his green eyes slightly widened as he scrolled through replies.
He rolled his eyes at the statement, slipping his phone into his jacket pocket. He stared out the window for the rest of the ride, ignoring the casual music that flowed through the speakers. Finally, the car pulled up, and he got out, smiling goodbye to the driver, and walking into the cafe where his friends were already waiting, seated in a booth down the back with their breakfast already in front of them, and pancakes for Draco.
Draco nodded, looking down. “I have to date Harry Potter.” The words hung between them for a few seconds, the plastic toy dropping from Pansy’s left hand, and her meal getting completely forgotten.
“Oh heavens, yes, it’s this week,” Minerva frowned, flipping a page of her diary. She sighed to herself, scribbling something before looking back at her screen. “Anyway, there’s a red carpet on the way in, so we need couples poses at that. And obviously, inside, appear as perfect as you can.”
“I got a dm yesterday, on Instagram, from someone who said Harry Potter is dating Draco.” Theo was immediately laughing, and after a split second delay, so was Draco.
Draco let them bicker, finishing off his pancakes as he half-listened to their argument. They were still snapping when his phone vibrated again. He tugged it from his pocket.
Paparazzi was the obvious choice, of course. But he apparently wasn’t in the clear, as Blaise shook his head, apparently still disbelieving. “Harry Potter,” he said, peeling his shirt off.
It was a man from the table that had been seated a few minutes ago. His friend was behind him, and their two other friends seemed to be watching from their seats. “Yes?” Harry replied, looking up.
“Thank you for having me, Pansy. It was lovely to see you.” Harry grinned at her, as he stood in the doorway. He had decided he best get an early night, for his training tomorrow. Draco didn’t argue.
Within two minutes, there was a location message popping up on Draco’s phone. He flagged a taxi, reeling off the address, which began to drive him towards Borough Market. The area was busy when he arrived, and he could see Harry waiting at the side of the road, his hair seeming slightly unruly as he ran a hand through it. A girl was talking to him, grinning, obviously a fan of his work. Draco got out of his taxi, slowly, trying to catch Harry’s eye without the girls attention falling towards him.
The shop was bigger inside and didn’t seem to stock clothes that weren’t second hand. Everything seemed to be vintage, and the shop was fluttering with customers who prowled the rails. Harry looked around, unsure of where to start. Draco was tugging his arm, though, pulling his sleeve towards a rack full of hoodies with varying patterns. “This what you’re looking for?”
“I have to go and meet my friends. I wanted to run our story again.” He put his phone on speaker again, leaving it on the shelf of his wardrobe as he pulled fresh clothes out, beginning to get dressed. “So, can we run it?”
Draco groaned, loudly. “Okay, I’ll be there in twenty minutes!” He hung up, dropping his phone onto a shelf of his wardrobe. He ignored the yawns of Harry from his bed, rushing towards the bathroom.
Harry moved quickly, as she held her phone up. Draco tried not to cringe as Harry slipped his arm around his waist, his chin arriving on Draco’s shoulder. He could feel his breath on his neck, which almost made him shiver. He managed to stop himself, though, taking a breath as he continued to stir the food. “Smells nice,” Harry murmured.
He laughed, lightly, his eyes falling towards Draco, who stood back, slightly, arms crossed. “I’ll see you around?”
“Why would I want to do that?” Harry tilted his head, his hand landing on Draco’s, which he picked up, lightly.
“I’ll have a word,” Draco decided. He pulled on his shorts, quickly, leaving his socks for when he returned, padding back down the hall. He knew his friends were probably looking after him, probably already raising the question as to why he had decided to go out. But he didn’t care.
He finally walked into his building, wandering towards the elevator. She sighed again, and Draco could picture her pinching the bridge of her nose. “Look, you like him. I know you like him. You know you like him. Maybe, just
“So, we’d be like.. Friends with benefits?” Harry questioned, eyebrows raising slightly, peaking over his glasses.
“You and Pansy are close, then?” Harry was shuffling towards the next aisle, his hand hovering over 2-minute noodles.
He felt pain before he even realised what had happened. Cedric was swearing, while he shook his hand. Someone had their hands on him, pulling him back. Draco could barely see them, as his eye throbbed. His hand flew up to feel it, blood on the side of his cheek. He rolled his eyes, best he could, more irritated than pained. “Draco! Draco!”
“She saw it in the papers. She wants to come to dinner with us this week, meet you formally.” He tried to keep his voice even.
“Okay.” Draco wandered towards the counter. Harry followed, unloading the basket as Draco pulled a bag from the rack at the counter. They both packed the bag, lazily, as the cashier scanned through each item. It occurred to Draco that it was all very domestic. He had been food shopping with Pansy once, but that was about it. His heartbeat was slightly faster at the idea before he could help it.
Most of the replies were from his supporters, telling her to fuck off, and that she was wrong. But there were still a lot of replies from older fans, siding with her. He always knew that there were a lot of older fans who hated him. Sure, he scored their goals, but he also scored with men. They hated that, even if they claimed not to. Being openly gay had earned him the support of many, but the hatred of just the same.
“Shut up,” Draco snapped. Cho rushed over with ice, wrapped in a cloth napkin. Harry took it, pushing it against Draco’s eye.
“But you hate Harry Potter.” She said it as if it were obvious, which it was. Draco tried not to roll his eyes, shoving more fries into his mouth. They were salty, and rapidly cooling. He chewed them, quickly, shoving more into his mouth as he finished.
On Saturday evening, Harry and Draco got ready at Draco’s place. Draco had carefully selected a black suit, with a metallic green tie, while Harry wore a dark grey suit, with a maroon tie. Harry needed help with his tie, which Draco adjusted for him, quickly, trying not to breathe in Harry’s cologne. Blaise and Theo had called twice to ensure they were actually going and talked about it all week. Draco was nervous more than anything, while Harry had had a permanent frown on his face all day.
She shook him what felt like seconds later. It wasn’t, though. “Cmon. I’ll drive you.” Pansy had apparently left his apartment between his meeting, and breakfast, because her car was downstairs in the underground car park, which they rode the lift down to after he had gathered his gear bag.
Harry smiled back, slightly, leaning into his touch. “Not too over the top, though. He’ll be able to tell.”
He was pretty, almost, when he slept. His cheeks were flushed, ever so slightly, and his lips looked a perfect shade of pink. His hair was messy, and his arms looked strong as they circled Draco’s waist, which he seemed to cling to. He looked peaceful and pretty, and Draco didn’t want to wake him, so he stayed as still as possible, barely breathing.
It was all very relaxing. But come half six, Pansy clapped her hands together. “I’m starved. Draco?”
Harry was standing in front of him, one hand grabbing his chin while his other hand pushed his hand away. “Let me see!” He scolded. Draco dropped his hand by his side, flinching slightly as Harry dabbed the blood on his cheek with his pocket square. “You’re an idiot."
The real main event of the evening was the bachelor's auction. Along with the footballers that were all socialising in the ballroom, and the people involved with football, there were also the single women whose ex’s were involved, or who had bought in out of boredom. The money they put on the table, for a chance to get a date with one of the eligible bachelors that were on offer. Draco had participated twice but was off the cards this year. So was Harry. That had been Minerva’s discreet way of confirming their relationship. People like Fred didn’t partake either, because it was known he was in a committed relationship. Just like Harry and Draco.
“Cedric,” Harry said, voice tight. No one else noticed, but Draco tightened his grip on him, his fingers tapping his hip gently. He was unsure how else to be comforting. “Nice to see you.”
“Yes. I want to sleep, and if either of you sleeps on my couch, I won’t get any. You both have a tendency to snore louder than trains. Do it in your own apartments.”
Harry’s thumb swiped the side of Draco’s jaw, trying to be comforting. It almost worked. But the ice was cold, and not nearly numbing enough for the bruise that was pushing through his skin. He sucked in a breath, his eyes wandering towards the ceiling. “Let’s get some air, yeah?”
They hugged at his door, his reluctant friends finally leaving, a laugh still on their minds about the idea of Harry and Draco. Draco let the door shut behind them, rushing back to the living room. He gathered empty bottles, glasses, wrappers and containers, throwing some in the bin, and others in the dishwasher. He fixed the couch cushions and swept crumbs from the coffee table into his hand, which he threw down the sink. He was still rushing around, desperate to clear the mess of his friends when the knock sounded on his door.
Harry rolled his eyes, moving past the shelf. “Right.” He shuffled, his pace slow as Draco followed him, his eyes still scanning the shelves. “How come you moved out so young?”
“Wake them up this early, and they fucking won’t.” Harry huffed the words, hanging up. Draco frowned to himself, pocketing the phone, trying to shake his nerves.
Twenty minutes later, Draco laid two plates at the kitchen counter, along with salt and pepper, and cutlery. He had made poached eggs, which he had managed to lay on top of a slice of bacon, which was on top of a piece of bread. He sat down on one of the stools, still nursing the coffee Harry had made him, which was cold.
“They’ve both played shit all season. It’ll be 0-0, I’m calling it.” Theo decided. And he called the scores for the next game. And by 9 o’clock, they were all drunk, and laughing over the matches they had spent all day analysing.
He remained frozen for a few more moments before his feet finally got him into the cab, and he dumbly reeled off Pansy’s address. “She’s going to hate this.”
The pictures were already circulating on Twitter when he arrived home. Pansy was lying on his couch, a packet of crisps open on her chest, as she stared at the tv on the wall. Toddlers & Tiaras sounded in his empty living room, but the volume was immediately turned down as the door shut with a thud. “How was it?”
“Even better. If the lie looks bad on purpose, they’ll buy it even less, and the secrecy of the relationship will seem more real,” Draco was basically brainstorming, and Pansy huffed.
“Fabulous.” She sighed, and then returned her cup to the coaster on her desk. She stood up, slowly, and grabbed two sheets of paper from the cupboard behind her. She handed a sheet to each of the boys and returned to her seat. “I assume you’ve both signed your contracts, and entrusted a friend each with the information. I’ll need you to each disclose the names, of course, and then we’ll move onto the sheets.”
He looked away after a second, looking back at Pansy, who rose her eyebrows. She had obviously noticed his watching of Harry. He averted his eyes, instantly, trying not to let the colour rush to his cheeks.
They really were the basics, and Draco barely had to think as he scribbled each answer. He finished Theo's name and planted the paper onto the desk, done with it. Harry did the same, moments later, swapping his own for Draco’s, which he was immediately reading. Draco snatched up the boys, his own eyes shifting over the page.
“After our last game, I kind of texted to apologise about the whole thing, and we just got to chatting a bit.” He said it easily, shrugging at the casual beginning to their story.
“Late,” Draco responded, getting up. He collected the rubbish, walking into the kitchen. He dropped them all into the bin, returning to the living room. “The spare room is the first door on the right. There’s a bathroom beside it, and my room is next to that, but unless you’ve set the place on fire, don’t wake me.”
They ended up on the couch after dinner, Harry flipping through movies, while Draco sat on the other side of the couch. Draco pointed out options every few minutes, while Harry ignored his suggestions. Finally, he put on Iron Man, leaning back.
“Couldn’t have bribed them to seat Cedric across the room?” He finally looked at him, a dejected look on his face.
He remained silent until the car pulled up outside the hotel. He finally looked over at Harry, raising an eyebrow. “Ready?”
The taxi took a few turns, Harry twisting his hands in his lap as if he were nervous, while Draco stared out the window. Pansy had been to a lot of football events, but Draco was unsure if she’d actually met Harry. Their discussions about him had been quite short, and he had no real idea how she’d react to him landing on her doorstep. But the cab was pulling up at her apartment building, and he didn’t have time to figure out what to do if she hated him, as he pushed out of the taxi.
“I’ll consider it,” Draco hummed, walking towards the car. Harry didn’t look up as he approached, but his teammates who shuffled out of the dressing room all seemed to watch with anticipation. “I don’t remember ordering a car service.”
“Well,” Draco started. But he got a sudden sense of stage fright. All eyes were on him, as he looked between his friends, and Harry’s. He knew their story well enough, but he couldn’t find any words. There was an unbearably long silence as the anticipation grew. Harry squeezed his hand, easily taking over as he smiled his golden boy smile.
Draco didn’t look at the menu, having eaten in the place several times. But Harry studied it, eyes trailing over the large plastic page. The place seemed cheap, but in the midst of Soho, it was the best American style food Draco could muster. A waitress appeared beside them, bored-looking on her face, a notepad in her hand. “Are you both ready to order?”
Harry turned at his voice, eyebrows raising. He was wearing an old jersey of Draco’s and seemed to be freshly showered with damp hair. The jersey was tucked into a pair of gym shorts, and he wore a pair of mismatched socks. He offered a small smile to Draco, turning back to the icing which he was seemingly working on. “I have to go,” Draco mumbled into his phone.
He perched on the corner of the couch, still looking uncertain, while Draco pulled his phone out again. Harry looked about the speak, but Draco was busy, dialling Pansy’s number. It rang through 6 times before she finally picked up, sounding already distracted. “Hello?”
“More than generous.” He sat up properly, again, tapping the side of Harry’s hand. “Would you bid on me?”
Draco sighed to himself. His eye hurt, and now he had everyone's eyes on him. He felt sick. “Nothing, I’m fine.”
a star football player,” he looked up at Draco, shuffling slightly for him to rest his chin on his shoulder instead.
“It’s satire. She took inspiration from idiots she went to school with and created the characters off of them.”
“You might be right,” Draco mulled it over. He took a few fries from her. “Blaise will be pissed though.”
“Did you see it?” Harry asked, as soon as he answered Draco’s call. “I thought it would be a nice touch.”
“We’ll all help. It’s my plan.” Pansy announced, standing up. “I’ll take pictures. Draco cooking for me, as he does for my Instagram on occasion. But Harry can subtlety appear in the back!”
“I’ll post them now, don’t worry.” She smiled at him, reassuring before her face turned back to being angry. “Go!”
Theo muttered his thanks, and his goodbyes, jumping out of the car. Blaise pulled away from the pavement, driving off towards Draco’s. “Weird of him to come by though, isn’t it?”
Harry rose an eyebrow, looking at his feet, and back at Draco. “I did,” he told him, nodding. “I thought it might be handy to have some.. things here. As a just in case, know?”
“Well, I’m stepping in any way. Take a walk, Dickory.” Harry was the only one to notice the clench of Cedric’s fist by his side.
“Soothing boyfriend. Protective, almost,” Harry leaned into the touch, his hand smoothing Draco’s tie.
Minerva had texted him the address an hour before he woke up, which meant that she was overly prepared, while he was not at all. Pansy had slept over a thousand times before, so he didn’t bother leaving a note. He pulled his dark green jacket from the hook by the door, slipping it over his shoulders, and dashed out the door. His Uber had been ordered as soon as he opened his eyes, and was waiting downstairs for him. He hopped in before he could be seen, keeping his head down in the back of the car. The driver seemed to glance at him through the mirror a few times but didn’t say anything. Draco was silently thankful for that.
“Good.” Draco nodded to himself, as Harry snuggled into bed more. Draco watched him, feeling more tired by the second as he slowly settled more.
Draco felt pity, suddenly, as he shrugged as casually as he could. “He’s a prick, Potter. You don’t have to thank me for having common sense.”
Draco frowned slightly, without meaning to. “Well, go and get them.” Now Harry frowned, looking slightly disappointed that Draco was so willing to get rid of him. It made Draco feel bad, instantly. “Go, and I’ll have dinner ready for when you come back.”
“I didn’t come back cause Dickory was still around! But I didn’t sleep with him!” He made sure to keep his voice low, just in case anyone lurking could hear.
They both watched him, expectantly, as he slipped into the booth across from them. They had forkfuls of food, that they abandoned to watch him, as he picked up the coffee they’d ordered for him, and took a swig. It was tepid.
Harry ended up giving Draco a pair of plaid trousers, that was too short on him and rode up to his ankles, and a black t-shirt, that seemed too tight on his frame. Harry dressed in a pair of skinny jeans, and a white t-shirt, which looked equally fitted.
Harry dropped his forehead onto his shoulder, huffing as he breathed against his arm. “You’re boring after sex.”
“There’s a charity event next week, as you both know.” Hogwarts Dinner, a yearly event that took place in a posh hotel in the city. Before Draco and Harry were even born, Slytherin and Gryffindor had been ambassadors for a large charity that donated to poverty-stricken school children. The other two London teams, Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw, which weren’t quite as good as the others, were also representatives. But as they played a league down, Draco knew virtually no one on the teams, apart from Harry’s ex-boyfriend, Cedric.
“The goal from Malfoy yesterday was better than any on the pitch today. Liverpool seemed asleep, and Man City wasn’t any better,” a commentator shrugged, his arms crossed. He had been a player once, years ago. Now he was someone people looked to for analytics.
He felt better in a fresh pair of clothes, and more relaxed as he towelled off his hair. This should have been how his day started, instead of falling out of bed and hopping around half-dressed as Harry watched him. But obviously, that hadn’t happened.
“Sleep, I’ll wake you, and you can tell me all about Potter later.” Draco was already nodding along, letting his eyes shut. She ran a hand through his hair, as she had a thousand times before, relaxing him until he was sleepy enough to doze off.
“I’m fine,” Draco pulled on a shoe, tying his laces as quickly as possible. “I just don’t like being late.”
They ate in somewhat stilted silence. Harry didn’t seem in the mood to say anything, and Draco was too tired to. It was blander than anticipated, which Draco regretted, but didn’t point out. They each stabbed at the bowls, the only sound in the kitchen being cutlery hitting glass.
“Yeah, like... We better watch out, because they’ve been training hard, and stuff.” Draco kept his voice even. He was good at lying, and always had been. Usually, he could say whatever he wanted, and if he sounded convincing enough, everyone believed him. “He probably just wanted to use scare tactics, y’know?”
“Great,” she sighed. “Look, Draco, you either like him and sleep with him again and have something serious. Or you don’t sleep with him again, you wait out your ‘relationship’, and you remain amicable. You cannot sleep with him again and expect no consequences, though.”
He nodded, hoisting himself up. The Flushed Away credits rolled, as he fixed his t-shirt. “Food, Potter?”
If he was completely honest, if Harry wasn’t such a prick, he’d probably find him attractive. He often caught a hint of red colouring his olive skin, and his full lips seemed permanently plump. His emerald eyes twinkled, and the stupid lightning bolt of a scar that staggered, and faded over his forehead, made him look unique and incredible. No one could deny that he was attractive, but his cocky prickness made Draco hesitant, as he looked at him in the street, now. “I suppose.”
“Well, not friends, but friendly, I suppose. They still chat to him on occasion. I hear he talks about me to everyone but them, though.” Harry said it flippantly.
It was raining when they arrived back on the street, and Harry frowned, looking at the sky. Draco’s eyes scanned their surroundings, pretending he couldn’t see the paparazzi that had been following them. Draco looked back at Harry, who walked a few feet ahead, still glaring at the sky. “Potter?”
“We should go home.” Draco nodded, no part of him wanting to go back into that room. Harry gave him a small smile, grabbing his hand again as he pulled him back down the alley, back to the street. A few flashes went off behind them, but they ignored them, as Draco flagged a taxi.
“What the fuck are they doing? Jesus,” Theo snapped, dragging them both from their trance. Draco looked away from Harry, glaring at his friends. “Disgusting behaviour, honestly.”
In the kitchen, Draco got to work on preparing dinner. He half-listened to Pansy and Harry’s conversation, as he went. She was asking about his interview with Rita Skeeter, which she’d told Draco about. “It was just stupid. I don’t like that woman, honestly. She’s been chasing me for an interview since, but I keep refusing her. She got a bit of bad press for that one, and she’s trying to make up for it.”
“They’re still friends with him? I thought they’d have taken your side in the divorce,” Draco said, honestly.
The car was nice and fast. Harry didn’t speak as he drove, tapping his finger off the side of the wheel, and occasionally looking out his side window. Draco felt too exhausted to even attempt small talk, so he was happy enough staring out the window as the buildings passed by.
He turned it over in his hands, opening it to where the bookmark had stopped. He was over halfway through, and Draco couldn’t help but flip through. There were notes on some pages, with some lines highlighted with a pen, which Draco found next to it. He read as many as he could, slightly amused by the observations made by Harry.
about?” Harry's voice broke through. He sounded casual as he asked, and Draco was almost startled. He had never really heard him in a setting like this.
“Breakfast.” He ignored the exasperated sigh from beside him, instead of focusing on pulling the final folded sheet of paper from his pocket, overlooking it. He slowly read the words that were scribbled on the sheet, obviously by Minerva. The story was simple but effective, and he was already halfway through memorising it as if it were a script when the car pulled up in front of his favourite breakfast spot. It was a small diner, made to seem American and vintage. “Cheers,” Draco mumbled as he pulled himself out of the car, waiting for Harry on the pavement.
Eventually, he closed his eyes, hoping sleep would return. But all he could concentrate on with his eyes closed was his sore eye. So, he took to watching Harry. It was far more interesting and much less painful.
“I need bread, and milk,” he shrugged. He dropped some money onto the table, standing up. The couple at the table beside them was still listening intently, desperate for something. “Come shopping with me.”
“Oh my god?!” Her voice was high-pitched and annoying, and Draco decided he didn’t like her. “Oh my god!”
“That makes sense,” Harry agreed. They were silent for a few minutes. The only sound was cars driving past on the road down the alley. Draco finally lifted the cloth from his eye, shaking the ice out of it. It wasn’t really doing anything. He held it in his hand, not wanting to put it in his pocket.
, you should give it a chance. You could find a stable relationship here! Everyone likes him, you like him! This could be great for you!”
“It’s fine,” Draco decided, the logical part of his brain justifying that he couldn’t keep getting angry at Harry if he was meant to play the boyfriend role. “They’re still getting dressed. I’ll stay a minute more.”
“Yes, but I’ve read it. And you like it. So, let’s discuss it.” Draco shrugged again, tapping his fingers against his arm.
They didn’t get stopped as they walked outside, but it was lightly drizzling which made both of them cringe. Harry led the way, apparently knowing where he was going, even though he’d seemed somewhat lost the day before. Draco walked just behind him, his head ducked slightly. “Where are we going?” He finally asked.
Harry dipped another fry into the milkshake, eating it as he looked at Draco, who was watching him, and not the movie. “Eating?”
“She’ll say anything to sell a paper, dear. She’s a bitch.” Pansy handed him a glass, grinning. She left Draco’s beside him. “Okay, pictures to make her scream. Draco, raise your glass, and use your left hand to hold the spatula.”
Draco leaned back against the couch cushions, staring at the screen as the analytics ended, and the news came on. He wasn’t much interested in that, as he switched between several channels, desperate for something good to appear on his screen. He was still looking when the food arrived, and he ended up handing the remote to Harry so he could actually eat, sick of his own indecisiveness.
“Your ex-boyfriend is a dick,” he sounded exhausted, the reassuring voice he’d used inside disappearing into the evening air.
“Don’t be a dick about it, Malfoy. Tell me what the stupid book is about!” Harry sounded annoyed, and Draco almost laughed but held it back.
“His godfather is his publicist. Luper, or something? He’s gay too, I hear. It caused quite the stir when Potter came out. People were asking if being raised by gay men made him a gay man. I read an article about it.” She reeled off, apparently knowledgable on the subject.
“I read a book about it last week! They called it something,” Theo clicked his fingers a few times, before nodding. “
The car ride was silent, Harry frowning out the window, while Draco checked his phone. He read through a few emails and scrolled through Twitter. The driver had stuck the separation glass up, and the silence between them seemed to stifle them. Draco felt slightly queasy, as they turned down many London streets. He wanted to find something to say.
“I’ll work on it, I promise.” It was their third meeting of the month. Minerva had called him in twice before to discuss his behaviour, and he was once again repeating the words he had in previous meetings. It was easier for him. He didn’t really care if he was honest.
“Uhm, after our last match, you texted to apologise, and we ended up chatting from there, and falling in love, or whatever.”
He rushed back to the living room, his mind scrambling for answers to give his friends who he was about to kick out. They both looked tired, stretched out on his couch, Theo with his legs thrown over Blaise’s lap. “I’m wrecked, guys. You wanna call it a night?”
Harry blew out a breath, rolling onto his side to look at Draco. “It’s okay. But this is excessive. I’m surprised you don’t have black walls.”
“It was fine. We got breakfast, talked, kind of. It was fine.” Draco wiped some sleep from his eye, trying to sound disinterested. He fidgeted in his seat for a second, keeping his eyes forward. “He’s a twat, though.”
“God only knows.” He ate in silence for a few minutes, finishing off the carton of fries, which he then crushed, dropping it onto his coffee table. The Roomba would clear up any crumbs or salt granules that he had dropped. “I hate him, Pans. I really fucking hate him. And now, I have to what? Make out with him in public? Take him on dates? Pretend I love him, when I don’t even fucking
They’d had breakfast together the day after he’d left their sleepover, and on Saturday morning. He was cheery enough the first day, but miserable on Saturday. Draco assumed that it had something to do with seeing his ex, but he didn’t bother to clarify. He simply frowned back and sighed. “My mother wants to meet you.”
“If we must.” Draco huffed. They rode the rest of the way down in silence, exiting together. No one paid them much mind as they kept their heads down. The car was waiting outside for them, the driver checking his phone, barely noticing the two boys step out of the building, and walk across the path to the car. They both slipped into the back, and the car took off.
“Hi,” he greeted, hungry suddenly, as he cut a slice off the pancake. Neither of them said a word, watching him as he ate, their food still abandoned. He rose an eyebrow, swallowing. “Hello?”
“You know he isn’t!” Draco huffed, tearing the nugget in half. He fed her half, taking the other for himself, laughing slightly at the joking bites she snapped at the air before he dropped the food into her mouth. She handed him a tissue, and her toy, patting his knee. “This will be awful.”
“And you can be tolerable.” He offered back. He nodded to the door. “I’m gonna head, though. I’ll see you tomorrow.” His bag was already waiting beside the counter for him, and he hoisted it onto his arm as Harry muttered a goodbye.
Harry shuffled down the rail, going through each hanger in search for something good. Draco abandoned him, slightly, figuring he had enough hoodies. He was looking at the jackets, which all seemed to be varying in style, length, and size. He almost burst out laughing when he found a windbreaker with the Gryffindor lion on the breast of it. He tucked it under his arm, continuing his hunt. A few feet down was a Slytherin one, in a matching style. He pulled that out too, already disappearing to the counter while Harry continued his search, oblivious to Draco’s whereabouts.
A quick Twitter search of ‘Draco Malfoy’ would bring up fresh pictures of Draco wandering around a thrift store with Harry Potter. The pictures were blurry, obviously, the counterman trying to get his 15 minutes, while the pictures of them walking from the diner were even worse. He scrolled through all of them. They were speculating, really. ‘Are these guys friends?’ ‘I thought they hated one another ?????’ ‘Lmao, could you imagine they were dating :0’
“Ridiculous,” Draco laughed. His phone rang, thankfully, and he quickly answered it, standing up from the couch. “Hello.”
“Sure, sure.” Draco dismissed him, not bothered enough to fight before he’d finished his coffee. “Anyway. You apologise, we call a truce of sorts, and in the weeks since, we’ve been chatting, I suppose. And now, we’re meeting, again. In public this time, because we’ve apparently met in private before this.”
“No, it tastes like cardboard. I hate it.” Draco teased a pout, which made Harry roll his eyes. “Don’t do that.”
When he emerged from his room, Harry was lying on the couch. He was rubbing his eye, continuously, obviously agitated. Draco ignored him, tottering towards the kitchen. “Are we ordering food, or making it?” Harry grunted in reply, not really answering. It was irritating. All he needed to do was pick one, but he was still fidgeting with his eye, ignoring the importance of Draco’s question. “Potter, pick one!”
“They’re in my bedroom, in my apartment,” Harry sighed now, sitting up. “I need to go and get them.”
“Because I just kicked them out on the condition that you needed the spare room, which could well be true on it’s own, but Harry is using it, so you can’t. And you’re the .. secret keeper. So, you have to lie to them for me, and when it all comes out, we’ll say you covered for us.” He rushed the words. Harry watched him, but he ignored the boy as best he could.
They left the empty packaging on the coffee table, both paying attention to the movie. It was boring to Draco, but Harry laughed at random bits and frowned when the credits rolled. “I’m going to bed.”
Theo snorted, shaking his head from the back seat. “You’re telling me Potter came all the way over for ‘not much’?”
Minerva McGonagall, his publicist, was the most accepting person he knew. But she was fed up with him, of course. She was even probably right in her saying he needed a fake relationship. But he pretended she wasn’t, as he walked home, agitated with his every step. His apartment was only a short walk from her office, and he stalked home, really, trying not to fume. The idea of spending time with smug little Harry Potter was bad enough, but the idea of romantically spending time with him… Well, that was fucking disgusting. The chap had a stupid scar on his head that made him seem cool, and a great bunch of friends that were always pictured having PG fun. He spent the weekend babysitting his Godson and playing matches with his teammate, and best mate, Ron Weasley. He was apparently a great bloke to have a drink with, according to anyone who drank in his local. And he was funny, according to the girls that followed him around, and his ex’s, which included the famous model Cho Chang, and the ex-football player Cedric Diggory. Everyone seemingly loved him.
“I have to know!” Harry demanded, his voice stronger now. “I meant to ask earlier, but I forgot. We need a proper time frame! It won’t do if we say we’ve been together four weeks, and you’ve been whoring yourself out yesterday!”
“Just keep it up for the week. Get occasionally pictured through the week, if you can. And on Saturday, get ready together, leave together, arrive together, get pictured, and put on the best act of your lives. And keep the subtle posts, Harry. They’re great. The internet loves them.” Minerva smiled.
“What are you doing here?” Draco kept his voice low, walking around the corner. Behind a wall was probably better for whatever interaction they were about to have. Draco didn’t terribly mind seeing Harry if he knew it would happen, but he didn’t like being caught off guard.
As soon as he was out of the car, he was dialing Pansy’s number. The street was almost empty, and he wasn’t seen as he walked into the Tesco’s, waving over his shoulder at his friends. She picked up on the seventh ring. “I slept with him,” Draco said before she could form a greeting.
“What about the teams?” Harry questioned, eyeing his godfather who had remained silent through their meeting.
“I don’t do that,” Draco shrugged to himself. “You do that, then you seem like the bad guy. No one’s questioning the first punch if there’s a second.”
And due to the fact, no one from his team was as obsessed with him as he was, none of them thought to check his name into Twitter. They were all none-the-wiser. It was almost a complete secret. And he didn’t mind it being like that. It was easier to train when it was a secret, and easier to think. No one even mentions Harry. He was an opposer, an issue, but not for a few weeks, at least. Their upcoming match was against Newcastle, and that was more important. The locker room chat was recollecting about the last game they’d played against them, and training was filled with jabs about the hopeful success of the Friday night game.
Draco didn’t really have a reply, so he chugged the rest of his coffee, signalling to a passing waitress that he needed another, as he pushed his mug to the side. “Are we having breakfast again tomorrow?”
“Tell them the story you concocted with Harry. I’m sure you’ve talked about this.” She sounded distracted for a second, as he finished brushing his teeth. Finally, she spoke again. “Look, it’s up to you and Harry to tell your stories, and tell them to your friends. I’m turning down press interviews, for now, so avoid answering any questions, or involving yourself in anything related. But tell your friends what you like. As long as you don’t let it slip that it’s all fake, you’re fine.”
Harry rolled his eyes, strutting back to the stove again. “Sure, Malfoy.” Harry spent the next few minutes cooking, while Draco watched the back of his head in silence. Finally, he dished it up, sitting beside Draco, pushing a plate towards him.
“Did they never ask what you wanted to do?” Draco asked. Part of him felt bad, which was a strange feeling when directed towards Harry.
“I like my girls smart,” he shrugged again, throwing his arm over the back of her chair. “Angie is the smartest girl I know.”
“They probably did,” he sounded unsure. Draco wanted to ask more, feeling indescribably curious about the relationships that the media had classed as perfect when they found out about them. But Harry was turning towards a shop door, which he had seemingly figured was the place he wanted to shop. “Cmon.”
Ron managed to flag down a waitress, who cleared away the empty plates and then took orders for fresh coffees, and teas. Draco ordered a vanilla latte, which Harry copied, which earned a slight glance from the group.
“You’ve been in relationships before,” Draco shrugged, his hands slipping into his pockets. “I haven’t.” Harry's eyes widened, but Draco was already stepping off the pavement. “I’ll see you tomorrow, lover.” The name sounded cold on his tongue, and he didn’t wait for a response.
“Siding with me over Cedric. Everyone else thinks he’s lonely, and I seem delusional.” He shrugged, timidly.
Draco sighed, wiping a hand over his face. He had a quick shower, rubbing his head with a towel as he called Minerva. She picked up on the second ring. “Draco Malfoy, a cover star! How are we?”
He kept his movements slow, still not really looking forward to putting on his terrible act of boyfriend to his enemy. Harry was still oblivious to him, as Draco snuck towards him, his fingers reaching out to grab Harry by the waist, making him jump. “Wha- Malfoy?” He turned, slightly, and Draco grinned. “Malfoy.” His voice was softer now, almost affectionate. “That was quick.”
“I swear,” she mumbled, mouth full of a chicken nugget. Pansy was tall and striking. She had been a model since she was 9, strutting runways by age 14. Unlike a lot of the football players he played with, and against, Draco had been privately educated and had horrendously wealthy parents, which had led him to know Pansy his entire life. He remembered the Pansy before she had grown into her big green eyes, and the Pansy who had sliced her hair off in an art class they shared when she was 12. Her dark hair was cut into a bob, now,
“Fine.” Draco lied, dropping his keys onto the counter, pulling his jacket off. He left it next to his keys, collapsing onto the couch. “I have training in an hour.”
He was right, but Draco was still semi-offended by the question. He thought it over, sighing to himself. “A week.” Harry rose an eyebrow. “Last Saturday! And before that, it was a month since I’d even locked lips with someone, okay?”
“You have to make us all dinner, this evening. I have ideas for it.” She was already planning any number of things, as she smirked.
As the final plates were cleared, he drained his wine glass, rubbing his thumb over his lip to catch a droplet before it fell onto his white shirt. Harry watched him as he did it, his eyes following each of his actions. Draco ignored him.
Blaise and Theo shared a look, smirking at him. Theo raised a hand, flagging a waiter who was rushing past with a tray of champagne glasses. Blaise passed them out, leaving the tray with a single glass as the man walked away. Draco slowly snaked his hand around Harry’s waist, pulling him closer to him. Harry fell into place, easily, slotting beside Draco in a casual way as he took a sip of his drink. Draco admired him, for a second, watching the curve of his lips, and the way his Adam’s apple bob as he swallowed his mouthful of champagne.
The Uber dropped him outside the building he had been in just a day before. He stepped out, and into the building, riding up the elevator until he arrived at the floor he desired. He shuffled down the hall, past the reception desk, and straight towards Minerva’s office. The contract was signed and folded in his back pocket, but he was ready to tell her he couldn’t do it. He was pushing open her office door to say he was giving up before he tried. He was standing in front of her desk ready to rip the paper to shreds. He was already speaking the words, “I’ve thought it over, and I just can’t date that smarmy prick, fake or not!”
Harry’s apartment building had paparazzi outside, all ready to snap pictures of whoever walked in or out. But Harry drove past them all, easily, turning the corner of his block, and driving into an underground carpark that Draco wouldn’t have even noticed. Part of him wondered why Harry had even invited him for dinner, if not for the photo opportunity of walking into the building together. But he didn’t say anything. He simply grabbed his bag from the back and followed Harry to the lift.
She sighed on the other end, probably shaking her head. “Your father is very proud of you, you know that.”
Blaise raised a hand, silencing the laughter over Lee Jordan’s comments on a players defence. “You know what's funnier than this?”
“Which is why you have a backstory.” Minerva fetched another two sheets from the desk, dropping them into each boys lap. “Go over it at breakfast. I have another meeting.”
He explained to himself that not only was handholding a boyfriendy thing to do, but also because the market was teeming with people, and it would be embarrassing to lose him in the crowd. “Food?”
“I know, Malfoy, I have caller ID. I live in the twenty-first century.” There was rustling on the other end of the line, and then a sigh as Harry fixed a pillow or something. “What do you want? I was asleep.”
Draco gave Harry a look, desperate to convey wanting to be away from this girl, which he immediately understood. He beamed at the girl, carefully skirting away from Draco’s hand, as he looked at her. “Was a pleasure to meet you, but I must get going.” She looked ready to say something else, but Draco grabbed Harry’s hand, pulling him slightly.
They ended up in a small bistro that didn’t seem to mind their casual outfits and had a free table. Harry had apparently been there before, due to their enthusiastic waiter knowing his name and his usual drink order. The menu was French and fancy, and Draco ended up ordering a chicken dish, which he’d had before, while Harry ordered steak.
Draco posed as she requested, and she snapped a picture with her phone. She took another shot of the pan full of food that Draco was in the midst of mixing, and a picture of their three wine glasses lined up. She had a habit of taking pictures of mundane things and making them interesting to her fans. Finally, she wandered away, her phone still in hand. “Okay, Harry, stand just beside Draco, and wrap your arm around his waist, and put your chin on his shoulder. If I take the selfie from here, I can just make out
Draco pulled him forward, almost, his arm around his waist guiding Harry towards Cedric, who eyed them with an unreadable look. “Draco Malfoy with Harry Potter on his arm… an unexpected sight.” He grinned, but it felt forced to Draco.
He left her office with a contract and a feeling of emptiness. Draco wasn’t really interested in relationships if he was honest. Especially not fake ones. He had done well in his 2-year career for Slytherin and had no real interest in doing better. He had fans wearing his name on jerseys, and calling his name in stadiums. He didn’t really need more. He knew his father wanted him to be a Beckham or Messi sort of name, but he also knew he would never get to that level. He had been openly gay since he was 16, and that lost a lot of interest from sponsors, and his father, really. He tried not to let it bother him, but it did, of course.
“Dates are any sort of quality time spent together.” Harry shrugged, watching Draco. “Watching a movie, doing some shopping, getting some breakfast, going on a run, having sex. Anything.”
Sleep was blissful and nice. He fell asleep as soon as his head hit the pillow, and didn’t stir until the sun was well up, and shining outside his bedroom window. The alarm on his phone blared, set to a later time considering he had no training or matches to attend to. He pulled himself from his bed, reluctantly, getting into the shower, and pulling on a fresh pair of sweatpants, and a random t-shirt. He brushed his teeth, towel-dried his hair, sprayed his cologne, and felt ready to lie around on his couch all day, doing nothing.
“People who don’t like Inception are simply too stupid to understand Inception.” He said it casually, but it lit something inside of Harry who opened his mouth, ready to snap.
The main focus of the picture was the tv, where Tony Stark was grinning. But if you looked closer, you could see the tangled legs of the couple. It looked like something off Pinterest. “Tony Stark, I luv u<3” was the small caption, positioned just under the tv. It looked good.
He threw himself onto the couch beside her, huffing. Pansy offered the small box of nuggets, smiling sadly. “Maybe he’s nice.”
“Right,” Harry nodded, slowly. It was quiet for a few seconds, and Draco was beginning to regret his decision.
Blaise watched him with curiosity, finally frowning. “You okay, mate? We thought you’d be happy that you didn’t have to, like, hide from us or anything anymore.”
“Do you want to do that now, then?” Harry enquired. Draco looked him up and down, for a split second, before nodding.
“Because you had leftover eggs,” Harry shrugged, looking at him over his shoulder. He squeezed more icing from a DIY piping bag made from a sandwich bag.
He got out, expecting a lift from Blaise. But Harry was standing by a sports car, one hand in his pocket, and the other clutching his phone, which he bent his head over. “God, you should give him an award.”
His mentions were flooded with questions and desperate pleas for interactions. He read a few, appreciating the support from some, and ignoring the rude comments from others. Finally, his eyes fell upon a tweet that made his skin crawl. ‘
“Yes.” The coffees arrived, both of them dragging theirs closer. Draco took a few long gulps, desperate to feel better. Harry took a calm sip of his, pushing it to the side.
“Slagging? Mate, we’re happy for you!” Theo reached forward, slapping him on the shoulder. He tried not to jump in surprise. “It’s about times you settled down!”
They rode in the elevator silently, Draco relaxing into a lean against the wall as Harry kept his hands in his pockets. The elevator binged every floor they passed, deafening them both in the silence that had overcome them. Draco was uncomfortable with the last-minute plans, while Harry didn’t really seem bothered either way.
“Won’t be if you continue this cocky streak,” Draco teased back. It felt suddenly easy to joke back and forth. It almost knocked the wind out of him. He reached forward, slightly, tapping the side of Harry’s thigh. A boyfriendy thing to do. “Strange that you ended up in the same place as me.”
He finally spied his name, towards the end of the board. He was beside Harry, thankfully. He scanned the names for a moment, trying to recognise more. He didn’t pay much attention to the lower leagues. Cedric Diggory’s name jumped off the board, making the queasy feeling return. Fred Weasley was also on the table, with his girlfriend Angelina's name scribbled beside his. Cedric’s name simply had ‘partner’ written beside it, an unknown person bound to show up on his arm. Theo’s name was also scribbled, along with Blaise and Pansy. He always managed to bribe someone to let them sit together. Pansy usually came as all their dates. She was part of their team, kind of. The other names were unknown Ravenclaws, that Draco didn’t care about.
Draco drummed his fingers against Harry’s hand, feeling almost at ease as he ignored the conversation occurring at the table, while his other hand clutched his coffee cup. It felt almost soothing. Draco almost felt annoyed when Ron stood up, grinning at the table as he clapped his hands. “Should be going, gents.”
“That’s cheesy,” Draco murmured. He felt almost lost as he looked at Harry, their eyes completely locked.
“Sure.” Draco shrugged. Harry moved to pull the sheet out, but Draco quickly stopped him, raising his hand slightly. “Don’t. We get caught with that, it’s over before it’s begun.”
There was silence until she returned, carrying a large tray of coffees which she doled out. Draco’s was already perfect to drink, but he watched, with disgust, as Ron, who had ordered a black coffee, emptied 6 sugar packets into the cup.
Pansy rolled her eyes, driving the route she had memorised years before. Just outside the city, the football grounds that Draco trained and played on, stood proudly, a sign at the entrance picturing the green snake logo. Pansy pulled into the car park, tilting her head. “Need a lift home?”
“So, boys, how’s married life?” Pansy seemed amused at the subject. Harry and Draco sat across from each other, while she remained at the head of the table.
They both snickered, while Ron made his way about slapping each of them on the arm. They laughed through it, Theo and Blaise joining in. Harry didn’t seem bothered either way, as he took a long sip of his coffee, slightly moving closer to Draco, who still had a hold of his hand.
“Get closer to the club, homophobic father,” Draco said it casually, plucking some oregano from the shelf. “Pansy and I lived together for a bit. It was nice.”
“Well, I couldn’t exactly wear it to Gryffindor training, can I?” The waiter delivered their drinks, scurrying back inside.
His options were slim to none. He knew he had been a bit off the rails as of recent, but he hated the idea of admitting that to Harry fucking Potter. He stared at the ceiling for a bit, milling things over. He was being stupid really. He knew he’d say yes. He would have to. He needed to. He took a breath, and dialled Minerva’s number, slipping his eyes shut.
“It certainly is!” She snapped. “Draco, do you know what the sponsors look for? They look for a good team player and someone who has a
“I had a late-night,” he said, honestly. His friends smirked at each other in the mirror. “Can you drop me at the Tesco round the corner, actually?”
The table all made small talk as they ate the mushroom soup that had been dropped off. Draco learned that Angelina was a fashion journalist, who had a cat, and liked to travel. He also learned that Fred liked travelling just as much, but training kept that to a minimum. Pansy talked to Harry, introducing him into a conversation with Blaise, while Theo managed to wrangle the Ravenclaw and his date into a chat, while Cho listened along. Cedric seemed silent and brooding.
happy! Apparently, they managed to keep it out one paper, but another is picking it up,” Theo informed.
Draco could have slept for a year, or at least he felt like that. He was wrecked. But his, phone was ringing its shrill tone, disturbing him as he tried to catch a few more minutes. He blindly hit his hand towards his bedside table, feeling around with his eyes closed until he finally landed on his phone, which he pulled towards him. “Hello?” His voice sounded groggy and hoarse, and he hadn’t bothered to look at the caller ID, which meant the shouts from the other end shocked him.
Draco knew he was right, which made him sigh, quietly. He finally nudged Harry back, letting himself relax slightly. “What are we shopping for, then?”
He looked over at Harry, who was staring straight ahead. He seemed in a trance, almost. Draco bit his cheek, a question on the tip of his tongue, unsure of whether or not to ask it. “Before we started all this, I had to be persuaded.. But Minerva said you’d already agreed to it… Why?"
“Unbelievable. I mean, you were late to practice for it. Must have been good,” Blaise tapped the side of his steering wheel, casting a glance across to Draco. “Tell us.”
Harry looked back at him, eyebrows raised as Draco moved towards him. He closed the distance within seconds, his head dipping to meet Harry, whose lips fell open slightly in shock, as Draco kissed him. He had kissed people before, but he was hyper-aware of the fact that Harry was unlike the others.
He boiled noodles as he went, leaving them all on the hob as he fished for his phone. He snapped a picture of the cake left on the counter, uploading it to his Instagram story. The icing was mainly small flowers, all white in colour. Draco was entirely unaware he had any ingredients to make a cake, and he hadn’t even noticed that he owned a cake tin. Pansy had probably bought it, he figured.
“I’m not,” Draco lied. He knew he was, though. And Harry knew too. He stared at him for a few seconds until finally, Draco sighed. “I’m tired.”
“Surprise.” Harry kept his back to him, and Draco wasn’t interested enough to sneak a glance at what he began to make. He instead pulled his phone from his pocket, scrolling through Twitter for a few minutes.
“And Potter’s nice. I know you always ‘hated him’, but he’s a good chap.” Draco tried not to wince at the air quotes around his words. “I always thought it was strange how you couldn’t seem to leave the drama on the pitch. I mean, I’ve had beers with Weasley, yet you were so against it all. Was always quite suspicious.”
“You should have told me that!” Harry shatter Draco’s chest, and he laughed, unable to help himself.
His bowl of cereal was going soggy, but he didn’t bother touching it as he stared at the screen. “Quite smart, indeed,” Lupin nodded. Draco couldn’t remember his first name.
“Maybe,” Draco murmured into his shoulder. He traced the lines of Harry’s palm with his thumb. “If you were up there, I’d bid on you.”
Finally, the doors opened, both of them stepping out. Draco didn’t bother knocking, instead just pushing the door open. She usually left it unlocked. “Took your fucking time, Dray. You were meant to make me lunch, and now it’s gonna have to be dinner. And you’ve missed half of Fantastic Mr Fox.”
But they were random people with barely any followers tweeting complete nonsense. No news outlets had picked up on anything. Buzzfeed, which had once boasted it knew everything about Draco, was silent on the matter. His name only came up once, in a quiz to tell you who your blonde hair heartthrob boyfriend would
Draco didn’t say a word, walking past, and into the diner. The same waitress as before showed them to their booth, the same as the day before. She vanished as soon as they were seated, the menus dropping onto the table between them. Harry glanced at the menu again, but when a waitress returned, he ordered the same as Draco, the same as yesterday.
That was how she had often ended meeting with Draco, who rose, already folding the paper into his pocket. Remus seemed to be chatting with Harry, making small talk almost, as Draco escaped the room. He knew Minerva wasn’t one for small talk when she had upcoming meetings.
Draco took away their empty plates when they were done, dropping them into the sink. He kept his back to Harry for a few moments, his mind in overdrive that he couldn’t seem to stop. He turned, slightly, his eyes wandering over his shoulder to find Harry watching him. He pretended he wasn’t when Draco caught him, his eyes drifting to the other side of the room. “You brought a bag,” he decided to say.
Harry sighed, handing the phone back. He studied Draco for a moment. “We’ll just have to be more convincing, then.” He leaned against the counter, his elbows resting on it, and his head resting on his hand. “We need plans.”
image! Currently, you seem like a selfish player, who hogs the ball, and a complete man whore who seems to spend all his free time doing coke in Soho.”
“That. Apologise. I’m fine. I’ll survive a black eye. I won’t survive you looking at me like it’s your fault,” he sighed. He curled around the duvet more, pulling some of it closer to him as he buried his head further into his pillow. Harry curled closer too, gravitating towards the duvet which he seemed so desperate to clutch. Draco let up on it a bit, letting Harry fully get under the cover, wriggling closer to him.
Harry nodded, and Draco did too. She uncorked the bottle, pouring generous glasses. “She won’t get a word from me again. She wrote 3 articles about me dating Hermione after I turned down her last interview, which is ridiculous.”
“We’re going to prepare a statement,” Minerva nodded. “And release it before the weekend. But so far you’ve been on the right track.”
“So, we could say we’ve been taking things almost seriously, maybe a month, but I wouldn’t commit properly, so you got revenge by sleeping with someone last Saturday, and it made me come to my senses, and we became official, in private.” Harry rushed, his mind working quicker than his mouth. Draco watched, amazement and irritation clouding his mind.
“I don’t know, I just know he does it. A few people avert their eyes to me when they see me coming, and I know it’s him. I don’t want to sound cocky, but he did always seem to be a bit jealous that I was on the Gryffindor team and he wasn’t. He didn’t make the cut, and I don’t know… I think he always resented me for it.” Harry looked down, slightly, as if ashamed of the words.
Draco nudged him, ever so slightly, making him look at him. Draco awkwardly offered his shoulder, smiling as kindly as he could in front of their friends. Harry leaned his head against him, as Draco took another sip of his drink. It was surprisingly comforting to have him there. Nice, almost.
She rolled her eyes, patting her boyfriend's thigh. “And I like it when he buys me things. Footballers get paid a lot of money, Pansy.” Draco smirked at her joke, while Pansy almost choked on her laughter. “How did you two end up together? Fred says you two hate each other.”
Harry stood up, fixing the shirt he had on, tilting his head. He looked small, all of a sudden. “You can kick me out if you want to, Draco. You don’t have to keep me around because we slept together.”
“Because he’s bought into your propaganda.” Pansy shot a glare across the car at him, shaking her head. “I’m sure you have your reasons, but everyone else loves him. I saw Cho just the other day, and she said he sent her a bouquet of flowers for her recent cover shoot, just as a congratulation.”
“I’d be amazed if City wins this,” Blaise announced. He had a beer bottle between his knees, as he pulled his hoodie off carefully.
“Open it later, and let me know if it fits.” He raised his hand further, a taxi pulling over immediately.
He was still paging through it when Harry arrived into the kitchen, standing on the other side of the counter. He was wearing an outfit similar to Draco. His hair was in a similar state of waviness, while his hair tried to dry itself atop his head. He also wore large, rounded glasses which shocked Draco. “I didn’t know you were blind, Potter.”
“Hello,” he replied, steadying his leg. He had been having a nice evening alone, reading a book, when his mother decided to phone. He could already assume what the conversation would be about, but he didn’t much want to own up to the information that easily.
“You call, I come running,” Draco shrugged, his fingers lingering on Harry’s hip. The girl beside them was having breathing problems, her blonde head-shaking as she stared
“The jacket,” Harry mouthed. Draco laughed slightly, becoming acutely aware of the tables that were much closer to them than the diner had supplied. The couple just behind Harry had seemingly moved their chairs out, slightly, and were not-so subtlety eavesdropping, desperate to hear something good.
“I’ll come to Pansy’s.” A taxi pulled in, Harry already pulling the door open. He got in, his face turning back to Draco, who remained on the pavement. “Cmon.”
“Really? I heard you were raised in a house full of servants, and chefs.” He sounded like he was digging for information, but Draco was bored, so he answered.
“Explains why I go for you then, doesn’t it?” Harry tilted his head. Draco frowned, and he laughed lightly. “Contacts every day, mostly. No one gets to see me in glasses.”
“Not necessarily!” He argued. He unloaded his basket, dropping it with the rest of the used ones under the counter. He also dropped a bag onto the counter, walking to the other side as the cashier began scanning his items. He clutched the phone between his ear and shoulder again. “You’re not saying anything.”
It was Theo and Blaise, their voices raised, and slight irritation in them. “We’re getting breakfast, get the fuck up. We’ll meet you at ‘Bens’, okay? Hurry up!” The line went dead.
When he woke up again, Harry was lying on his chest. Their legs were tangled up, and Draco’s arms were lazily wrapped around Harry’s shoulders. He was still fast asleep, his eyes closed, and his lips parted slightly as he breathed in and out. Draco watched him for a few seconds, doing his best not to disturb him.
“Think of something for our next date, right?” Draco disappeared into the cab before he could get a response. He was only a street away when he got a text from an unknown number, which he quickly added to his contacts.
He finally looked at the stage, watching George Weasley bound forward, a cheeky grin on his face. Lee Jordan called out his name, enthusiastically, and paddles began rising. The most Draco made was £17,000, but George was over that after a few seconds. “Do you really have to sleep with them if they bid over 20?” Pansy questioned, twisting to look at them.
“Let’s go.” Draco decided, slipping out of the booth. He pulled a fifty-pound note out of his jacket, dropping it onto the table, Harry slid out of the booth too, fixing his jumper. Draco let him walk first, his fingers brushing against the small of his back as they wandered out of the diner beside one another. The tiny touch would be seen by their watchers, no doubt, which was the intent.
Harry poked his head around the door, his hair a mess, and his glasses falling down his nose. Draco watched him through narrowed eyes, eyebrows raising at the timid look on the boy's face. He had two cups in his hands, steam rising from them. He placed one of the cups on the bedside table next to Draco, and circled the bed, placing the other on the opposite side, and falling onto the bed. “Hi.”
