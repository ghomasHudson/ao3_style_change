Feet shuffled. Eventually Avery spoke. “I’ll go first,” he said, stealing glances at Charlie and Alice. “I’m sorry.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry said, realising his hands were all over Draco’s neck and hair and face. “You’re very warm.” He also realised that Draco’s hands were not on him; he was holding his floury hands away from Harry’s soaked self. “Uh, do you want to go finish those scones while I change?”
“I don’t know, but I’m bloody well going to find out! I want to be!” Harry’s heart jumped into his throat. “Don’t you want to be my happy ending too?”
“Of course!” She rang him up and Harry gave her his last twenty-pound note. “I love your costume, by the way. It looks really cool.”
After that things happened fast, and the game was in the air, players speeding after one another and dropping balls and bats left and right.
There was a letter on the floor by the door. Harry’s heart jumped into his throat before he picked it up and then dropped into his stomach when he realised it wasn’t from Draco. It was a Muggle letter, delivered by Muggle post, and it was from Peony. Harry stared at the letter, disappointed it wasn’t from Draco and confused it was from Peony, and angry, and upset, and tired.
Harry had never realised Malfoy was left-handed before. “Like a friend,” he eventually said. His heart dropped, hope with it, making Harry think maybe he should’ve picked the other option. Though really—Harry had wanted to be
“Were you?” Draco shifted, moving onto his side to face Harry. He had crease lines on his face. “What were you thinking about me?”
“I don’t know that there’s anything wrong,” Draco said, hysteria creeping into his voice. “I’m—this was deliberate, wasn’t it? You said you’d—and you collected
Harry faceplanted onto the sofa. He wasn’t going to cry, he told himself. He wasn’t going to cry at all. He
He stood there for so long that an employee had to politely tell him that they were closing soon, Mr Potter, and would he like to make a purchase, or…?
“Oi, lovebirds,” Seamus said, cutting through Harry’s thoughts. “Any chance you can help me talk sense into this fool?”
Malfoy sniffed the bath bomb, then looked at the label again. “That’s remarkable. None of these ingredients have magical properties, but what you’re describing sounds very similar to the effects of the Calming Draught.”
Charlie held his hand over the broom, which was no longer hovering a foot above the ground, but lying flat on the grass. “Up!”
Harry didn’t have any further interactions with Malfoy that day; Malfoy slipped out before closing while Harry was busy helping one of the other researchers: an elderly witch who was looking into her family tree to try to locate some cousins that’d gone to the Continent during the First War. He wasn’t certain how he felt about it—Malfoy and the botched attempt at socialising with him, that was, not the witch—but had no opportunity to try again, or say something different, or just lay eyes on Malfoy and reassure himself that everything was probably fine.
“You stay on the playground where I can see you,” Harry said, pointing at the large windows and the swing-seats and sandbox beyond. “We’ll all go together to the field with our brooms as soon as I’ve dealt with this.”
“That sounds very nice, put like that.” Harry finished his soup. “And I guess that it’s true, to some extent. But when the War was over, all that went away and I just wanted to sleep and do normal people things.”
“Come on, Draco,” Harry muttered to himself. “Please write back.” He was, slowly and surely, getting soaked. His weather charm had worn off, and while he’d made sure the kids were comfortable, he hadn’t afforded himself the same care.
“Yeah! We don’t have any in print, unfortunately, though I could order some in if you’re interested? But there are digital books if your boyfriend has an e-reader.”
When he finished and was about to order food and maybe write Ginny another owl, Mrs Weasley’s owl arrived with a letter from Ginny.
Lisa showed Harry the types of e-readers they had in stock and explained how they all worked, what his options were, where to find the books and how to get them onto the device. It was all very exciting and Harry thought Draco might enjoy the e-reader—if nothing else, he might have an academic interest in it, as this small piece of technology seemed magical all on its own—but he was going to need a credit card and a computer and an internet connection to load books onto the device, none of which he had. He didn’t know how to use a computer either, though he’d seen them at the Muggle library he’d visited to look up Peony. Maybe he would go there and ask for help. Later.
Some of the articles he only skimmed, deciding they weren’t relevant to him, but there was one about asexuality that he read all of, and some about sexual dysfunction—one interesting article surmised that in men orgasms and ejaculation wasn’t one and the same—and then there was one that stopped him in his tracks entirely. It was about Post-Coital Dysphoria and came with a note attached from Gladys.
“Yes, damn it. I didn’t suffer for most of my life only to continue to suffer. I don’t care about what I deserve or don’t deserve, I care about what I want. Right now, that’s you, us.”
Harry gestured at their naked selves, hoping it’d be enough. They hadn’t cleaned up yet, so they were both still sticky and starting to get gross.
teach the kids the Finbourgh Flick,” Harry said, automatically. Ginny was good at demonstrating, but absolutely no good at teaching—especially little ones. She had little idea of how to talk to them and even less patience, so she was usually content watching, taking notes, and planning ahead, while Harry rolled his sleeves up and got dirty with the kids. He stepped aside, letting her into the flat.
They ate in silence for a bit, until Harry started feeling too awkward about the silence. The weather bubble Malfoy had conjured held really well; it didn’t keep the cold out completely, but it took the bite out of the wind.
Harry’s robes looked almost shabby in comparison—they were clean, and on his body, and they were his favourite set (bought last fall), with loose sleeves and hidden buttons at the front, but at some point the collar had got a bit bendy and Harry had never managed to bend it back.
. How long had he been isolating himself if he hadn’t seen that all around him there were people just like him?
“I’m good,” Harry said as he rejoined Malfoy in the foyer. He noticed now that Malfoy wasn’t wearing his own cloak and hadn’t actually been wearing it, which meant that he’d…what, been at the archive for a while already? Lying in wait for Harry? In the middle of the foyer? How early had Malfoy come in today? “Were you waiting for me?”
“Harry. You’re overthinking this,” Ginny said. She’d put the Snitch back into the box and locked it and was now sitting atop it. She patted the space next to her.
“That is entirely up to you.” Malfoy finished his food. “And I’m not going to lie and tell you that it doesn’t hurt to try. It might. But if you want to fix…things, it’s a start.”
“That’s the best time to eat outside,” Malfoy said. “Outside is textured differently when it rains. It smells different than when it’s dry out, or the sun is shining. I find it greatly enhances the eating experience.”
“I, of course, always wanted to be a Quidditch player,” Oliver said, stepping in. He gave Harry a wink and a nudge to go. “Got my first broom at age three, this fantastic little toy Cleansweep modelled after the 2, that my mother charmed to go a little faster.”
“Exactly! That’s what good winners do. Let’s go. Everyone, shake hands.” Harry ushered the kids up and back to the field.
“Yeah?” Draco lifted the Stasis Charm on the dishes and suddenly the smell of food permeated the air. Roast potatoes and something beefy and spicy and smokey. “I—I hoped to turn the hayloft into bedrooms,” he said, pointing upwards. “A large one for us and then smaller ones for…little ones.”
“I’m sorry,” Draco said. “I didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable. I’ve just never seen anyone do wandless magic before.”
“No pressure, right?” Ginny said, having come up to stand beside him. “Imagine how it feels when you’re the one on the pitch and not standing on the sidelines.”
“Do people give you grief about…you know.” In the first years after the War, it’d been near intolerable. Grief and anger had run rampant, and those who’d allied themselves with Voldemort had taken a lot of abuse, even as they waited for their trials. It’d been miserable, and they hadn’t even had their own government and judiciaries to sort it all out; the dust had barely settled in Hogwarts before a delegation from Europe had shown up to clean up the mess.
But the last person he wanted to see right now was Ginny. Harry didn’t think he could look at her, let alone talk with her, without…feeling guilty. Guilty that he hadn’t felt like this when Ginny had left, like something important had been taken from him, and guilty that he was struggling to even get through the day. It felt…unfair, somehow, that breaking with the person he’d been with for seven years had been relatively smooth, while now…Harry hadn’t been with Draco more than six weeks, Harry realised, though it felt like it’d been longer.
Let’s move in together.” Draco had turned strangely intense and speculative. “How do you feel about living in a barn?”
A few minutes before closing time, Malfoy dutifully brought the trolley of documents back to the front desk, and Harry sorted him out a new request form.
“He went to the school in Cornwall, I think,” Harry whispered back. “I don’t know. I didn’t know there were other schools than Hogwarts until recently.”
The pamphlet had said something about touch, hadn’t it? Only Harry couldn’t remember if it was about not touching or touching. His daycare kids usually calmed down when offered physical contact if they were upset or anxious: a hug, a pat on the knee, holding hands on excursions, that sort of thing. But Draco wasn’t a five-year-old, and Harry didn’t want to think about managing him like a child, either—but physical touch was physical touch, wasn’t it? People are people? It could be worth a shot—he could make the offer at least.
Harry was late. He was so late he was running through the Ministry to Hermione’s office because he was late—not just
The rain continued pouring. It was cold, but dry, under Malfoy’s umbrella. Harry didn’t really know what he was doing, here, with Malfoy. He was falling in love with a person who had just reminded him, bluntly at that, that he’d been on the other side in the War, a person whose family was tied up with centuries’ worth of human and magical supremacy politics and blood politics, somebody who’d been directly responsible for a lot of harm.
“Good things.” Harry touched his legs to Draco’s under the covers. “I was wondering how you sleep like that.”
Harry thought about it. Scary, he thought. Nerve-wracking. “Exhilarating,” he said, his mouth turning up into a smile.
Malfoy had been reaching for the new request slip, but his hand hung frozen in the air. “Oh,” he said, finally taking the slip. He folded it carefully and put it in his pocket. His face was carefully neutral; that was to say, a different kind of disinterested, neutral face, void of emotion.
With this seemingly age-old argument playing out, Harry could afford Draco some attention. “Are you okay?” he asked in a low voice.
, I could spin and dye my own wool for a fibre art project,” Dean argued. “And I could train them to run in formation—”
“Ginny,” Draco said suddenly and Ginny turned her attention back to them. “I didn’t get you a badge because I didn’t know what to put on it. Do you want one? I’ll personalise it any way you like.”
“Sickle for your thoughts,” Draco said, coming up from behind and surprising Harry. They joined the line at the café.
“You don’t get bored? I mean when you’re by yourself and all.” Draco had a hand on Harry’s knee, his fingers going over the knobbly bits as if trying to memorise them.
“Yeah, yeah, I’m good. Is this…?” Harry extended his hand to the woman by Ginny’s side. Her…new person? Or just a teammate?
Harry lingered for just a moment, soaking in Draco’s joy, and then strode over to the kids and Ginny. He tried to channel confidence and positive spirit, or whatever would get his team to believe that today would be a great day. “Who’s ready to win this game?” he yelled.
Malfoy stopped short, cheeks red. “They’re not all murders,” he said, softly. “Most are natural deaths and accidents.”
Not really. Malfoy must’ve seen that uncertainty on Harry’s face because suddenly he smiled like he’d seen something really funny.
It would be wrong to say that Malfoy made a distressed sound, for he didn’t make a sound at all, yet Harry could
“Oh you know, just the usual.” Harry stole a sip from her drink, then leaned over to say hi to Padma. “How’re you two? It’s been a while. Nobody else here yet?”
They were interrupted, then, by the waiter who’d come to take their order. Harry had no appetite at all. He gave his friends quick glances, then ordered a small starter and nothing else.
“Curious?” Malfoy rubbed his face. “To answer your question. One thing. Well. It taught me that I’m a coward, and that there’s no excuse for making the wrong choices.”
“The, uh, I picked three charities, three-way split so everyone gets an equal share,” Harry said. He was going to have to work on this for the inevitable press interviews. “The Janus Thickey Trust, The Children of War Charity, and The Lupin Trust for Werewolves in Need.”
Malfoy came back the following day as soon as the Archive opened. Harry politely processed his request form and Malfoy took his place below the painting once again.
Ten minutes before the game would be called, nobody had caught the Snitch yet, and the scores were even at 130-130. Instead of swapping Alice out with Anthony, Harry decided to keep her as Seeker until the end of the game and sent Anthony in as a Beater instead, taking Love out of play before she caused a major incident—Harry could deal with her frothing on the sidelines—and also rotated Denise and Dorcas back in as Chasers.
Gilliam rolled his eyes, but he shook Draco’s hand politely and when Blaise went to fetch them drinks, inquired about what he did for a living.
“Thanks.” Harry looked back over the pitch. Oliver was refereeing today, and he was making his way to the middle of the pitch with the chest of balls. “All right. Time to get cracking.”
He paired them off two and two and gave each pair a Quaffle. “What I want you to do is race from this line here,” Harry drew a line in the snow with the toe of his boot, “to that line there,” he pointed at the line he’d marked out earlier. “You start on opposite sides. The one with the Quaffle has to pass it to their partner when they pass each other, make it to the other line, turn around, and then receive the Quaffle when their partner passes it back to them….do you know what I mean?”
“No.” She shook her head. Her voice had taken on a sharp, angry tone. “It’s the same bullshit every time,” she snapped. “What’s the problem? What the fuck is the problem? Why is it you never fucking want to fuck me?”
“I guess,” Harry repeated. The exhaustion was creeping into his bones. He glanced at Draco, who was no longer pretending to be reading his book but was openly looking over at their table. He raised an eyebrow and Harry nodded. Yes, he thought. Let’s leave soon. He hoped Draco got the message.
“Hey.” Harry couldn’t stop the delighted grin as Draco approached. The cape was heavy enough that it didn’t flutter much as he walked, though it draped beautifully, the whole thing giving him an air of…elegance and stability. “You look amazing.”
“You have two modes, Harry,” Ginny said. “Either you decide you’re going to do something and nothing on earth can change your mind about it, or,” she lifted a finger and drew circles in the air, “you waffle about for half an eternity until somebody makes a decision for you. Lately, it’s more of that and not so much the first.”
“I don’t know.” Percy frowned. He clearly looked like he wanted to. “I’ll ask Oliver—oh, sod it, I’ll come alone if I have to—”
that idea,” Lisa said. “I can think of a few romance novels like that, but they’re all about straight people. Do you want gay ones, or will the straight ones do?”
Draco enclosed them in a weather bubble, to shield them from the wind. “Have you finished the book yet?”
Everything was heavy. A black stone settled in his gut, a heavy weight of fear and anxiety and other things he couldn’t name. What if this was the end?
The cashier tried to hide a smile. “Your costumes are excellent,” she commented. “Where’s the party at?”
“I would’ve preferred it if you’d asked me to stop,” Draco continued, making a noticeable effort to stay calm. “Instead of—what were you
There were several pamphlets about addiction, a few about stress, one about depression (Harry took one of those), a few about divorce, some about PTSD (Harry took one of those too), several about various mental illnesses, some about sexuality… Harry pocketed a pamphlet about anxiety as well, and then he saw one that gave him pause. ASEXUALITY, it said, in large letters, underneath which was a cloud of quotes, such as
The pub was uncharacteristically quiet, a fact that could largely be attributed to the fact Ginny wasn’t there. She had a rule of not drinking or going out the night before a game, a rule Harry was not beholden to. He’d show up to her game with a hangover more often than not.
“Yeah,” Harry confirmed. “They call it a triad, though. Two kids so far, Fred and Roxanne. Fred is…three, and Roxanne is the little one. They’re great kids; when I babysit I let Fred win at gobstones. I think he knows I’m letting him win, but he’s pretending he doesn’t know so he won’t hurt my feelings.”
Harry stared at him. Draco had transfigured a tea towel into a makeshift apron, the apple and elderflower pattern stretched oddly as the tea towel had distorted itself into the new shape. Draco had also fastened the cut sleeves on his robes above his elbows and rolled up the thin sleeves underneath, but there was a smudge of flour on the left sleeve anyway.
“I don’t know yet.” Draco had his eyes closed, breathing slowly. Harry squeezed his hand. “I’ll…tell her today, I suppose.”
“No, that would be me,” said Draco, evenly. “I don’t trust people, on a fundamental level. When I read that book for the first time…as soon as I realised that her narrative was unreliable, I decided she couldn’t be trusted. She had to be lying about everything. It was…” He tilted his head, thoughtful look in his eyes. “A surreal experience. By the end of the book I was certain it was all a lie. Then I read it again and saw all these little details that didn’t add up. One moment she was wearing a white jacket, the next a grey jacket? A fault of the author’s, or a liar’s slip up?”
“Let’s make a deal,” Harry then said, switching to a different tactic. “How about you just get it up? You don’t have to fly on it today if you don’t want to, just get it up.”
Harry had been distracted throughout Thursday’s Little League training, the distraction only getting worse once Ginny had shown up, as Harry’s brain replayed his session with Gladys over and over and over. The kids were distracted because Harry was distracted, and training turned out a complete disaster.
Ron was elbowing him, commenting something or other, and Percy had pulled out his wand—probably to fix his throat—but Harry didn’t pay attention to either of them, so focused was he on Ginny and the blush in her cheeks. The other team had come down as well, and they were shaking hands. He spotted Oliver, who—despite having lost—was grinning at Ginny as she shook his hand.
see Malfoy again, he told himself; Malfoy would come back to the Archive, continue his research. He’d get another chance to make friends with him.
Harry had homework to do today after Little League practice, but maybe…maybe Draco would like to come? He could ask. He was hell bent on finding time for a tea break with Draco at the Archive today, he’d ask then.
“Thank you,” he told Lisa. “I, uh, that’s a bit out of my price range at the moment, but he’s got a birthday coming up in June…” he trailed off, apologetically. He’d done the conversion to Galleons in his head, and the e-reader alone was more than he’d want to shell out without careful budgeting. But Draco had mentioned audiobooks once—maybe Lisa would know about those. “What about audiobooks?”
But still—Harry had wanted a normal life. After everything, he just wanted to feel like a person, somebody capable of building a family and loving them, making a good life, something untarnished by war and dreadful relatives and other bullshit. He didn’t want to be The Boy Who Lived, he wanted to just be Harry. Dad, husband, friend. What was so wrong with wanting that?
“I’m afraid everything has been mixed up,” Draco said, standing in the middle of the room. “I did use that Charm you showed me, but I think my thoughts were all jumbled, so…”
“I thought the rule was one charity,” Hermione commented with an eyebrow raised. Beside her, Ron shook his head, grinning.
Harry had been looking forward to Little League practice, especially since they wouldn’t be playing a game this weekend (they had three game-free weekends in a row, actually, and then two games after that, and then they’d know if they’d make the semi-finals), and could relax a little, have some fun, maybe learn some new techniques that were somewhat more advanced in time for their next game.
Hugh and Betty whooped, and soon enough the kids were racing each other off the field. Harry followed at a more sedate pace, taking a moment to himself. Being a childminder could be tough sometimes, and never tougher than when he had to deal with his kids’ emotional well-being.
“Ugh.” Harry stared into the container. It looked like Chinese soup of some kind, with dumplings in it. “Half my daycare kids are on my Little League team, the other half aren’t, and since yesterday we played our first game and won, the half that’s on the team has been, quite literally, gremlins this morning, and the other half has, naturally, been upset. And of course, as kids get hungrier and hungrier…” Harry trailed off. “Things were on
“You didn’t tell me you’d met someone! Hello there,” Pansy shook hands with the newcomer sweetly, then turned back on Blaise. “Honestly!”
“Okay. All right.” Harry hadn’t touched his tea, which had no doubt gone cold. He didn’t want it. The biscuits had turned into dust—he hadn’t touched them, but nevertheless there was a pile of yellowish crumbs on the plate in place of biscuits. If Peony had noticed, she’d not mentioned it. “You seem more chill about magic than you used to be.”
“Hey!” Harry called out, letting the door fall shut behind him. He was regretting having sent Draco here, to have made plans with him in the first place, because all he really wanted was to mope and wallow and let the bad mood run its course.
“Sorry,” Harry said, already retreating. It’d been a stupid question. Stupid to think he could talk to Malfoy, of all people. “Forget I asked.” He fled the reading hall.
(As for which treatments Harry sorted out with his therapist...I’ll leave that up to reader interpretation.)
The barn was quiet, except for the tittering of birds from the hayloft. Harry could smell fresh wood and dirt through the scent of food still sitting on the stove, but he could see what Draco was talking about. He could see how the space could become theirs—where the bookshelves would go, how the light from the proposed solarium and the knocked down wall that would make space for it would brighten up the barn, how he could spend his days here with Draco knowing it would be forever. And it was doable—Harry would be happy to sink the remainder of his inheritance into building  this with Draco, and helping him, even if all he would be able to do was fetch things while Draco did all the difficult expert stuff.
“I met someone,” Ginny then said. “It’s a girl, if you’ll believe it. I don’t know if I like her because I’m not as straight as I thought I was, or if it’s because she looks at me like—like I’m the hottest woman in the entire world, but she makes me feel wanted. And I want that. I
The bath bomb had fizzed out completely a long time ago, and the water was a dark purple. It should’ve started cooling, but Harry had surreptitiously charmed it to stay hot. If Draco noticed, he didn’t comment on it.
“You brought me lunch?” Nothing was happening the way Harry had expected—though what exactly he’d expected he didn’t quite know. Grovelling, definitely, pleading, probably, and several moments of terror until Draco deigned to forgive him. Not
“I wasn’t going to comment,” said Malfoy, with a smile. “But since you brought it up, why don’t you?”
“That’d be nice.” Draco frowned. “In romance novels it’s about earning a happy ending. I’m not so sure we—I mean, I’m not sure
Excellent. Harry helped Charlie towards the other children and got him joining the little Quaffle circle almost seamlessly.
“Those are some books I’ve enjoyed,” Malfoy said. If possible, his cheeks were even redder. “You asked, the other day. I thought maybe you’d like to try them.”
Betty assessed his cards. She had only just turned four, but she was smart. “I think you need more glitter.”
“You had freedom,” Harry said, voice tight as he tried to keep his emotions under control. “You had any toy you wanted, parents who loved you, friends—I had none of that. It was abuse, plain and simple. You don’t get to tell me you didn’t have a ‘great’ upbringing when you were literally treated like a king, and I was treated like the dirt the cat dragged in.”
“I can hear you thinking,” Draco mumbled from inside the pillow. He barely stirred. “Go back to sleep.”
“You don’t think that’s physical?” Malfoy asked. “They did have to connect some wires in a way that scanned as incredibly physical to me. Slotting plugs into sockets.” The way he pronounced the technical terms was very careful and precise, as if he’d practiced enunciating the unfamiliar words out loud multiple times.
Harry stared. Was that a joke? Was Malfoy trying to joke with him? “Well, let me know when you’ve figured it out,” he said. “Can’t have people just disappear on me, you know, I need to check people out of the reading hall properly.”
“No, on Wednesday, it’s just, waiting is awful. One isn’t supposed to kiss until the first date? Right? But I really want to. But it wouldn’t be appropriate? Merlin’s mouldy socks,” Harry cursed, rubbing his face. He wasn’t sure whether it was good that he wouldn’t be seeing Malfoy at all tomorrow because on Tuesdays he wasn’t at the Archive at all, or whether it was worse because he would be seeing Malfoy on Wednesday at the Archive before their date, and he’d have to…somehow pretend they weren’t going on a date later when he saw him? Pretend like it was any other Wednesday, fetch Malfoy coroner reports, maybe entice him to join him for a tea break, talk about normal things and somehow not combust over the fact that they’d be leaving together, maybe holding hands—would Malfoy even
“Have you always been funny and into me or do you just have no filter right now?” Harry asks, looking, if Draco isn’t mistaken, both a little flustered and a little smug.
“Fair point,” Anthony conceded, toasting her cider with his soda. “Okay, ask me again in the morning and we’ll pick a color for our coordinating outfits.”
He was in the same foul mood when he made his way to the forest, after fielding conversations with Pansy and Blaise that involved pointed questions about Harry’s forays into hallway heroics.
“Do you need a blanket?” Harry asks, and goes to get the big aubergine colored one down from the closet when Draco shrugs.
67. The red handkerchief lays folded like a spray of blood. The red handkerchief is always reminding Harry of blood. It could have reminded him of other things, like sunsets or flowers, but it never did. It occurs to him, when he finally picks it up, holding it in his hands for long that it becomes the same warmth of the body, that it could remind him of flame.
“Keep up, Potter,” Draco says, which Harry doesn’t think is strictly necessary, considering that they’re on the same team. “No one knows I’m a werewolf. I wasn’t being targeted, my clients are. I brew for sixty four werewolves, and if I hadn’t taken the potion early, I wouldn’t know there was anything wrong with it. If we can’t figure out what’s going on soon, then there’s no guaranteeing they’ll have their potion ready by next month.”
She searched his face, maybe for clues and maybe for a crack, something she could dig her fingernails into looking for secrets. “Will you ever tell me?”
“Certainly something more debaucherous than this,” Draco replies offhandedly. “Although I think I get points for fraternizing with the enemy.”
“I just want to lay here, if that’s okay,” Harry said, trying to let his mind settle. He wasn’t hopeless, he could talk to Draco, the real one and the forest one. He’d done more impossible things than making things right with his ex enemy. He didn’t think they could start over, didn’t think their history would dilute like that, but they had so many shared foundations that they might be able to build something new.
“Connie, the nosy neighbor. Rob does all his deliveries remotely, so if someone met him at the house to Imperius him, there’s a decent chance that she might have seen it.”
“If you want,” Draco said, pretending it didn’t feel so important. He just wanted to know about Harry, wanted to steal all the small mundane pieces of him while he could. They’d never been friends like he’d wanted, he’d never been able to go to the ice cream shop with him and watch him order or laugh at him as he dripped ice cream down his fingers. He wanted to know everything, every small thing about him so maybe when they left the forever he’d have something left to hold on to.
“What did you read?” Harry asked, feeling an uncomfortable twist at Draco’s words even though he suspected that he was trying.
“Those look nice,” Blaise said, sitting down next to Hermione on the pretty blue couch, curling his long legs underneath him. “Are they for you?”
The connection ends with a snap, and they lock eyes again in the sunlit gym. Draco’s face is as white as his shirt, his mouth vaguely slack. Harry feels bile rising, rising in his throat and he swallows and swallows until he doesn’t think he’ll be sick on the mat.
“Are you uh-” Harry trailed off, unsure how to ask if they were going to do it again, if Draco was going to kiss him and make it easy this time or if they’d have to fight their way into it.
“Yeah, I definitely didn’t know that,” Harry says, looking both perplexed and charmed. “I thought you were like. I don’t know. Just weird and bad at talking.”
“And on that note, may you all have a safe and wonderful night,” McGonagall finished, the quartet restarting their music with the soft lilt of the violin. Harry opened her eyes slowly, exchanging warm glances with her tablemates that somehow spoke of the strange horrors they’d all seen, seen and walked through, scarred but not broken.
were a werewolf!” Harry protests. He would be a little embarrassed about how much confidential case information he shares with Ron if Ron didn’t share just as much with him. “Just that there was a werewolf case with an unspecified werewolf, who could really have been anyone.”
“You were nothing but lovely to me when I came in to the store the first time,” Harry replies stubbornly, remembering the way Draco talked like he was afraid to disturb the dust that had settled between them, how he never snapped or told him off. He remembers the look in his eyes when he’d told Pansy she’d done enough and how after that he couldn’t begin to stay away.
“I can give you one, if you want,” she says, reaching up her arm and pulling off a flower. Draco gives her a quiet smile as she hands him the flower.
When he woke up the next morning, he could still smell it on himself, foreign and strange in his bed.
Draco glares at him for ten seconds, then delicately starts in on a piece of toast. “Well, aren’t you going to eat something?”
It’s four thousand and Draco gets a victorious little smile on his face, and Harry thinks that he might just need more practice at this. Draco crawls across the couch and tucks himself stiffly against Harry a few minutes later. Harry loops an arm around him and feels him slowly relax, the tension falling from his shoulders as their bodies curl together, letting the afternoon slip into evening.
“Glad you’re enjoying yourself,” Harry says, even though he can still feel the remnants of Draco’s revulsion and knows Draco is thinking of the same thing.
“Merlin, the company,” Draco says. “Oh, do you know who is lousy at apologies? My beloved friend Blaise. He ruined some of my favorite brogues on one of his slutty excursions and I ended up apologizing to him. It all happened so fast.”
“Draco. Please. You can’t kill me the first time we fuck,” Harry says. Draco had let go of the hand he’d had pinned behind Harry’s back, which was his first mistake. “You have to allow me use of my hands,” he says, running them over Draco’s hips. “They’re good hands. I think you’ll like them a lot.”
They both register the shock of his first name and one of them breaks the connection, Harry isn’t sure which, and they’re left sitting silently in the small flickering room.
His stomach turned at the earnestness in Harry’s eyes when he’d asked if Draco was okay, as if he knew something Draco didn’t want him to. He must have spent an hour thinking up scenarios in which he had something witty to say back that left Potter stuttering and skittering away. He also thought of a couple where they ended up kissing, but that was neither here nor there.
Harry thanks her and starts down the winding staircase just behind the reference desk, the wooden stairs curling down the center of the library like the spine of a conch shell. When he finally makes it to the third floor down, he spots Draco, flipping through a file cabinet near the front. He has on a pair of wire-framed reading glasses that he pushes up intermittently, dark green trousers and a button down, the sleeves rolled up so Harry can see his elbows. There’s a bit of pale green fabric done up in a bow where a tie should be, which Harry thinks is maybe wizard fashion but makes him look like a wrapped gift. Harry is planning on teasing him that he looks the part of amateur detective, but when Draco glances up from his work he feels his words die in his throat. In the low light, he looks just like Harry remembers him looking after wine had clouded his vision: like he was so clean and vaguely glowing.
“I wouldn’t have told you then.” She turned back to the window, her hair falling into her face. “I was thinking about Vince. He was a horrible dancer. Worse than Greg, and something about how you turned and laughed even though you hadn’t done it right at all made me think about him.”
25. Ginny shot with her right hand because she cast with her left. A wand has a lot of purposes, but a gun is a gun. Harry wondered why everyone he ever loved insisted on being so dangerous, but didn’t really wonder, the kind of wondering that’s knowing, but not wanting to admit that you know.
“Malfoy’s a good teacher,” Harry said, mostly because she knew it would make Draco stumble, which it did. Draco stepped on her foot in retaliation, nearly sending Harry into a fit of giggles.
“I know,” Draco said, in a clipped tone. Harry couldn’t remember the last time she’d seemed quite so closed off. Draco Malfoy was a lot of things, but quiet and restrained was not her usual. It was probably good, but it just made Harry want to prod at her.
Rob nods amicably enough. Harry watches him carefully for any tells of nervousness and finds none. Harry feels that perhaps it would have been more polite to offer them tea, but then hears a tinny ribbit from inside the kettle and thinks that perhaps its for the best that they haven’t been. Harry takes the list, and begins at the top. “Your last delivery to Puddlenik Alquick, can you recount the details? When you arrived, what you delivered?”
Harry feels nervousness swoop deep in his stomach. If he asks about Malfoy, he can’t pretend it’s just a chance encounter, and if he doesn’t, he might convince himself that none of it was real. They’re both awful choices.
“How thrilling,” Harry replied with a laugh, pushing open the doors and striding out onto the lawn. The snow had mostly melted but nearly an inch still coated the ground. Half the school was out taking advantage of it, whether by wandering around in the sunny winter day or hurling snowballs at the back of each other’s heads.
Draco smiles at her as he detaches from the wall, pausing to give Harry a quick glance. “Do you think you- If you don’t, you know, have any plans, I mean other than pasta- You’re definitely welcome?” He grimaces, sweeping his hair out of his eyes, and Harry can’t remember ever being so transfixed by anything. Draco has a funny pleading look in his eyes and it reminds him of the bathroom in sixth year and of the first time they locked eyes and Harry’s nodding desperately.
“No way,” Harry says, remembering the conviction in Draco’s eyes when he’d said he was trying to be a better person. He remembers the night they’d found him after he’d turned, how before he’d gotten his bearings he’d looked so afraid. “He wouldn’t.”
Draco is silent for the rest of the car ride, his face pressed to the window as London flashes by. They arrive at Harry’s apartment a few minutes later and Harry pays the cabbie, helping Draco up to his flat with a hand on his back that he probably doesn’t need.
“You hand grip is better now,” Draco said clinically, like it wasn’t technically praise, as she fell effortlessly into dance position. It looked natural on Draco even when it felt gawky and ridiculous on Harry.
The room is quiet, late morning light falling through the single window. Draco is wearing one of his shirts, Harry is sure, and the sheet is pulled up just past his torso. His hair is messy around his face and Harry almost can’t bear to wake him up. He’s still beautiful, Harry was almost hoping he’d forget that, or that in the morning the words would stop holding such weight. They haven’t, they still crush heavy on his chest.
Draco begins to collect the newspapers. “Do you think we have a chance of solving it before the next full moon?”
“You look like candy floss,” Harry said delightedly, noting Draco’s lipstick, which was a shimmery rose nearly the same shade of her dress. “I think you might glow faintly pink.”
“After she challenged me!” Harry asked. “Do you remember the time she sent me a howler telling me that my clothes fit badly? Like, sorry we can’t all afford ten tailors!”
I think the thing I feel most guilty about is Katie Bell. You got tangled up in that, too. When I thought she was really going to die I almost turned myself in. Truly almost marched up to the headmaster’s office to ask for help. I wonder what would have happened if I had, if I could have been saved. Any what-ifs I contemplate still seem to end in death. Mine, others’, yours. My life never seemed too fragile, but looking back I don’t know how I made it out alive. To die now is a bit anti-climactic, isn’t it?
“I’ll try my best,” Harry assured him before rushing back her table, victorious at the thought of Draco in pink.
“I’ll be at the Burrow, it’s become quite an event. They’re going to have to put an addition on the house just for Christmas,” Harry says ruefully, thinking of last time, when they’d used engorgio on the table and still ended up having another group eat on the sofas in the living room.
“Are you going to stay?” Harry asked, looking up at the trees so he wouldn’t have to look at the boy next to him. He dug his fingers into the soft earth, pleading with the forest to let him stay, to let him have one more thing.
He couldn’t stop thinking about Draco’s book comment, over breakfast and class and homework. About destroyed things and worn things only being well loved. It felt overdramatic in the light of day but it had been so genuine when Draco had said it, eyes wide like he’d been making a mistake by divulging something so personal.
“Personally, I suspect Calypso,” Draco says, pointing to a picture of a brown haired witch blithely cuddling what appears to be a full sized wolf. “She supplies the lupine saliva. I’ve been working with her since I opened the shop, but she’s from a weird old pureblood family and I wouldn’t be at all shocked if she was behind something like this.”
“Poor boy?” Harry asks indignantly, breaking a biscotti in half like it personally wronged him. “You punched him in the face!”
“Sorry,” Draco says. “I’m not good at being quiet. My bedroom was in a very secluded part of the house. It taught me bad habits. I was not suited to dormitory living,” he says all of this in a rushed, strangled kind of voice that devolves very quickly into a moan when Harry switches up his rhythm.
Harry wants to comfort him and doesn’t know how. Everything about the last hour and a half has been completely untenable, nothing has made sense since he found Draco lying in that petunia patch and they picked right back off where they left off. Even though Draco has said that he loves him (kind of), he can’t understand it as true. Draco is saying that Harry doesn’t love him, but that doesn’t seem true either. He’s staring again, at Draco, who he has always believed to be beautiful. Harry reaches out to brush his fingers across Draco’s cheek, finding the skin soft and cold and nearly damp.
Two months after school had started - after Harry meeting Draco’s eyes over the tables became a habit instead of just a coincidence - Draco wandered the halls at night for the first time, and that was how the discovering began.
“Very true,” Ron replied, tying his tie into a very sloppy knot that Harry knew Hermione would straighten before breakfast was over. “Not sure who Hermione will fret over if you get it all turned around, she’ll probably start on the firsties.”
“Right,” Draco says. If he thinks about this for a single moment longer he’s going to bolt, so he rests both knees on the carpet and leans in to kiss Harry, coming in too fast and knocking their mouths against each other.
“Gordon and Potter: freaks in the streets, but not in the sheets. Sheets as in paper. Paperwork.” She slides off his desk, returning to hers and placing both of her boots on its scuffed surface.
Luna stood, drifting over to them and taking one of Draco’s hands in theirs. “I’m so glad you decided to come, I told Harry to invite you. Do you knit?”
Ron groaned, sliding out of bed with all the drama he could summon, his hair sticking up every which way. “Although I don’t have to pry you out of bed now so I guess that’s an improvement.”
It was for that reason that Draco stayed in bed all day and finished the strange book about underwater boats and endless descriptions of fish and had the house elves bring him dinner so he wouldn’t have to leave.
When he woke the next morning it was with a persistent shiver, and he made Blaise come over and feel his forehead, only for him to report that Draco was ‘normal temperature’ and ‘probably just being a baby.’
Harry laughed like it was an inside joke of theirs, reaching down to pick one of the flowers and turning the stem in his hands. “I thought about not coming back tonight,” he said, lightly like he wasn’t dropping a bomb. “It freaked me out that people might know. It’s a bit crazy, the whole thing.”
When he walked out to the forest that night, he did so with high hopes. The weather had taken a chilly turn, and he wrapped himself up in his cloak as he crossed the grounds. The forest loomed grand and sprawling in the distance, and it wasn’t until he stepped under the first tree that he felt that emptiness again.
“So what?” Harry replies stubbornly, jabbing the elevator button. He’s always hated the way everyone acted like they knew everything after the war ended and her nerves only made him angrier. He knows the story was sensationalized, painted in black and white, but it still makes him angry.
“That would have been more refined,” Draco says, even as he pulls the orange blanket up to cover his chest.
“Eavesdropping on me, what else is new,” Draco replies, but it feels like they’re sharing an inside joke more than anything else. “Claudia, you know Harry Potter right?”
Harry sighs from somewhere deep inside his chest. Harry wonders how many of their charming friends have assumed that they’re sleeping together and how exactly he feels about it. If he’s honest, the emotion is closest to blind panic. “We’re honestly not, and you and everyone else can fuck off with it.”
“I’d like to see you yell,” Hermione snapped, and Neville looked like she’d hit him, wilting under it. She turned her gaze to the rest of the table. “Sometimes I feel like I’m the only one who actually gives a fucking shit what happens. What are we even doing? Every god damn day nothing changes. It’s not your arses on the line if the Death Eaters really come back, is it? If muggle borns lose their rights? It’s mine.” She was clutching her arm, her arm with the word scarred across the skin. “Fuck all of you, honestly. Fuck!”
“Okay?” Harry asked, patting Draco on the back awkwardly, which turned into stroking her hair, which was just as soft as it looked.
Draco blinked at him, his lips growing whiter and whiter as he pressed them together, his breath coming fast through his nose. “I
Seamus choked on a laugh at the bruise mottling Harry’s neck, trying to smooth his face into something supportive. “Good luck t’ya, mate.”
Draco guesses three more items and gets two of them right, and Harry tries not to stare at him. He finally speaks as the episode goes to commercial. “Are you upset with me?”
“What do you want your options to be?” Harry asked evasively instead of ‘just love me’, because everything was too embarrassing and too personal.
“See you tomorrow,” Draco says dully before he steps into the Floo, and Harry cringes as he watches him depart. They can’t put any of it off forever and he knows that. He can’t quit because this is all he knows how to do. Draco won’t quit because he’s trying to prove himself to the world. Harry doesn’t need to read his mind to know that.
Harry groans. “And the picture, Merlin. It looked like we were...” Harry trails off, taking a bite so he doesn’t have to finish the sentence.
“That’s lovely, you two,” Hermione says, punctuating it with a yawn. She flicks on the kettle and leans heavily against Ron’s shoulder, holding her kitschy ‘Pan and Proud’ mug against her chest.
“I work in a muggle shop,” Draco replies, refusing to meet his eyes. His eyelashes aren’t long but they curl just a bit at the end, soft and dark blonde. “Do you really think I’m out for anything?” He pauses and Harry waits for him to speak again. “I’m just trying to be like, myself or something.”
“What are you working on?” Harry asks, gesturing to the black grease smeared across the tips of Draco’s fingers.
Draco cackled, a laugh that sounded like something coming unhinged, and Harry felt uneasy about the way he kept edging closer, gray eyes bright. “Yes, please.”
“Pansy will lose it, I haven’t suggested a proper party since fifth year,” Draco says, smiling fondly. “She’ll have your whole flat decked out in streamers and glitter bombs before you can properly invite her in.”
Harry gives him a look that says he very much doesn’t believe that. “I think you’re very weird and very bad at talking,” Harry says. “I think you’re also funny? Also very hot. Obviously. Everyone knows that.”
The forest seemed to laugh, low and deep in her roots. “It’s not funny, you know. He probably hates me now. He’s not a poof and you can’t just go around kissing boys who aren’t poofs, they’re terribly sensitive about it.”
“Of course you were,” Harry replies, keeping his hand around Draco’s forearm as he leads him into the living room. He can pretend it’s for convenience and not because they’re holding hands if he keeps his fingers wrapped loosely around Draco’s wrist.
“You’ve really made a mess,” Draco says, and Harry reaches for him, draping himself over Draco’s back as he stands in front of the mirror, notching his chin over Draco’s shoulder. “Really?”
“I know how it’s supposed to work,” Draco says, his hands looking for a place to be still. His next words come out harsh. “I thought you were going to stop me. I didn’t want to see.”
“You still think I’m charming?” Draco had asked, looking down at the visible veins in his wrist: three, if you counted only the biggest.
“Ye-no, actually, please don’t. Be as wizardly as possible. If you have a pointy hat, wear it.” Harry was already mentally going over his robe and cloak options. The petty part of him that was still angry with Dudley (
He’d read it soon. Maybe as soon as he finished the robots one. Or maybe he’d put the robot book aside for now and just dive headfirst into this one. Or maybe he’d just put it in his bookshelf where he could look at it and where it would wait for him until he was ready to read it.
Almost everything in that article touched a nerve somewhere deep in Harry; everything about expectations and pressure and the emotional crash afterwards—
It was raining, which suited Harry’s mood just fine. Draco hadn’t responded to this note. Hilde had returned after a few hours with nothing but a dead mouse, and Harry had kept the window open after that just in case Draco’s owl was going to make an appearance. But Draco hadn’t sent so much as a single word, and Harry had slept badly, and now it was raining, just further cementing what a colossal idiot he was for believing a single note would make any difference. It was all over. Draco had left, Harry had missed his shot at something remotely resembling happiness and, well, that was that.
Not the whole family, though. Just Dudley. The Dursleys as a whole could still shove it as far as Harry was concerned; the last time Harry had seen them had been a few days before his seventeenth birthday and he’d fully intended it to stay that way. They’d gone into hiding and Harry had never cared to find out what happened to them, if they’d come out the other side alive, or if Death Eaters had found them, or…anything, really. (He’d been surprised to discover he did actually still have a lot of anger aimed that way.)
The meadow in the painting was flattened by wind and dark clouds filled the sky. The bunnies that lived in the painting didn’t show themselves.
Could’ve been me, is what Harry should’ve said, because if that novel had been about him, then he would’ve been leading the rebellion against the technocratic government, and Draco would’ve been one of the people under its thumb.
And now it was Sunday, and the game was starting in just under five minutes. Harry’s stomach was in knots; the first League game had been Saturday, DragonTamers versus Hawkins’ Hawks. The Hawks had secured a narrow victory over DragonTamers, and Hawkins had wasted no time blathering to the press about how his team was going to take the Chocolate Cup home. Harry had read the play-by, which hadn’t made him feel any better, as it seemed both teams had not just worked well together, but had ‘several aspiring talents’ on their rosters.
“Not at all.” Harry looked at the cover of the science fiction novel again. “Thank you.” He opened the cover to look inside and found a neat little piece of ornate parchment stuck to the reverse. The decorative band along the edge looked drawn by hand, depicting rows of planets and space ships and little people in space suits tethered to them. In the centre it had two lines,
“You wanted a no,” Harry said, the frustration coming back. She couldn’t have it both ways. “This is it. I’m sorry if that’s not what you wanted, but no. No, no, no, no,
“I’m not a paragon of virtue,” Harry said, knot forming in his chest. “You can’t hold my life up as some kind of beacon of justice, some kind of goal to strive for or measure yourself against. I’m just me. And it’s…it has
“I am one hundred percent free this weekend, Draco, and I am very close to begging you to spend all of it with me.”
“Avery took it,” she said, mulishly. “He says it’s the best one and he has to have the best one because he’s a professional Quidditch player and only professional Quidditch players are allowed to use the best bats.”
“All right.” Ginny leaned against him. She watched him finish building the bookcase. She watched him test its stability and move it to the wall. She watched him shuffle it a few inches to the right and then just a half inch to the left, until it was perfect. “Come to bed,” she said when it was all done, “and let’s break in this home of ours.”
Still, Harry had expected Malfoy to come in. Was he ill? He hadn’t looked chronically sleep deprived of late, but anyone could be felled by illness unexpectedly…
.” Padma glanced between the two of them, but apparently decided not to comment. “By the way, we are engaged.”
“Do they do anything?” Harry asked. The badges were nice, but they weren’t changing colours or flashing different text or doing anything interesting.
Harry used the Archive’s owl to inquire with Gladys about another appointment. He received a prompt response that there was a slot open that same evening, so he sent back a confirmation. He’d talk to her about maybe setting up a schedule of a kind—he hadn’t thought he would, but after that first appointment Harry found there were a lot of things he wanted to talk about. Unburden himself. Have someone smarter than him who used words like
“I don’t doubt that you love me,” she said, after a while. “But you don’t want me. You…having sex with me, it’s like a chore, for you. And I deserve better, you know? I want more than…that.” Her lip was wobbling, now, but she wasn’t crying.
“Honestly? Because there’s the honest answer, which is not very nice, and there’s the generic answer, which isn’t entirely honest.”
“Yes, of course—that’s fine, that’s brilliant. Thank you.” Harry squeezed his hand. Malfoy hadn’t removed it yet, even if they were on the steps of the College. “I’ll…see you after? I’ll get you a pass that’ll let you into our section if you’d like? Or we can meet—”
Harry shook it off. If Malfoy had no more properties left to restore, he was more than welcome at the archive to study coroner reports.
The poetry wasn’t his thing at all. He’d just have to take Malfoy’s word for its supposed cleverness.
“Don’t be dim. That boy will be back at five to pick you up. Walk you home or sweep you off your feet. Probably both.”
Maybe it was sheer force of will. Maybe she’d just already done the crying, so she wouldn’t have to do it again in front of him.
Harry took the ex libris list and quickly sorted Malfoy out. As soon as the new form was in Malfoy’s hand, he shoved it in his pocket and walked out.
, Malfoy had said. Did that mean another time in a friend way, or was he turning the friend date down because he wanted a
“All right.” Harry tried not to frown at him; he’d been told it was unprofessional. “Did you want a new request form for the reports you haven’t looked at yet?”
. The article didn’t mention what kind of therapy, what it’d been about or how long it’d gone on for, but maybe Gladys would know.
“I do wonder why Muggles keep writing books about the evils of technology,” Draco said, eyebrow quirked. “It’d be like…if we wrote books about the evils of magic. It’s…unthinkable.”
Gilliam turned out to be a Quidditch player, a reserve Chaser for Puddlemere United, which explained why Harry had seen him before. He and Blaise did seem rather taken with one another and Harry became conscious of the fact he was the only one at the table who hadn’t brought anyone with him.
No, that wasn’t true. It hadn’t been a week. It had been almost two weeks, because the truth was this: Harry had already started detaching himself from the relationship, from Ginny, the day she went to the Burrow.
He hadn’t come this clinic to talk about the Dursleys, he’d come here to get the sex thing fixed. Un-kill that void inside of him—that Gladys had said wasn’t there, explaining that he in no way was partially dead, or just a little bit dead, or damaged. He’d come back whole, she’d said.
my boyfriend is fit.” He put emphasis on that last part. Peony hadn’t reacted to Harry presenting Draco as his boyfriend, possibly because she was apparently queer in so many ways, too (now that was something Harry had never seen coming), but that didn’t mean Harry was going to give her a pass. He hadn’t forgotten the slurs and the violence towards him that she’d been responsible for in the past.
“Both,” Malfoy replied. He was smiling too, now, though his cheeks seemed to be a stronger shade of pink. “What’s the status?”
“Kind of.” Harry had five little players, if one could call them players. That seemed a mite generous. And it wasn’t a team, it was a daycare. “I don’t have a full team.”
That was the original plan, anyway. But Harry had a list of possibilities tacked to the fridge, and now the idea of turning the daycare from part time into full time, of taking on a new crop of kids, was exciting instead of depressing. Yeah, he’d gotten attached to these kids, but they weren’t really
Harry didn’t respond to that. He could understand that this was shitty, he just wasn’t in a place where he could—or wanted to—acknowledge it.
Ginny was shaking out her hair and Harry’s attention snapped to her. She was drying her hair with magic, and soon it fell about her face in a soft cloud.
“Yes, thank you.” Malfoy waited patiently while Harry sorted him a new request form. “When will you be in tomorrow?”
Draco could’ve suggested eating dirt and it would’ve sounded marvellous. “Yes! Perfect. Tea sounds fantastic. Can I kiss you again?”
Harry had been in the mood for the black bomb, actually. It was an annoying little thing, turned the water a gross dark brownish purple, but it had pepper and cinnamon and something else in it that was spicy and jabbed and prickled at him—it was a cleanser, of a sort, or so Harry felt; when he used it on bad days, it always felt like the negative energies washed off him and down the drain along with the water. However, most of Harry’s awful mood had evaporated when he’d seen Draco in a transfigured tea towel for an apron. (Draco had taken it off already.) “Whatever you want.”
“I finished repairs on the property, but I still have my workshop. So I’ve been alternating between researching my book, improving my woodworking skills, and planning the rest of my degree. Now that I’ve finished my research, I have more time for the rest.” Draco hesitated. “I’m serious about the woodworking business. I want to set up a part time thing.”
“I don’t have a girlfriend,” Harry said. The words came just as easily as they’d done the day before. “People don’t give their exes Valentines, do they?”
He had homework to do, as most of Saturday had gone into last minute prep and he hadn’t had the time—or state of mind—to get it done, but he couldn’t honestly say he had either today. Right now, Draco was more important than the reading for Tuesday’s class in Managing Services, Access and Preservation. He’d do it tomorrow after Little League practice.
“How do you listen to books? The only books I’ve heard speaking are the ones in the restricted section in the library at Hogwarts. They scream if you try to read them without permission.”
Harry rubbed his eyes. When he’d gone into this year with the hope of a new beginning, he hadn’t envisioned…all
“Bisexual isn’t bad at all,” Dean agreed. He was making eyes at Seamus, and now Harry didn’t want to sit here anymore either.
“I need fresh air,” Draco said, abruptly, and extricated himself from Harry and the table. “Come with me, please.”
“Yeah.” Harry didn’t really know what to say about it. He sort of got what Malfoy had meant about it being a commentary, but felt he lacked context. “It would’ve been great with some annotations,” he confessed.
She gave him a moment to breathe. “Harry, I’m going to say something I don’t think you’ll want to hear, but that I think is important for you to consider,” she said, gentle but with a touch of authority.
They looked at each other, a lot of unspoken things hanging in the air between them. Rhosyn was waiting behind Ginny, and Harry…he wanted to go home and continue reading about gay robots having mind-meld sex in space. And then talk to Malfoy about it.
“Thank you,” she said, levelling an adoring look at her husband. They couldn’t stop grinning, and Harry couldn’t honestly fault them, even as he battled with his own mixed feelings.
“Hah.” Harry smiled wryly. “I’m just…” Tired. He rubbed his face, trying to articulate what he was feeling, through the swamp of alcohol and unease. “Tired of straight people,” he eventually said, gesturing at the group. “You know.”
“The main character is a detective,” Malfoy said. “The other guy is a magician. They, uhm, work together to save England from war with the fairy realm. Of course there’s no fairy realm, but it’s a great story. There’s going to be a sequel I think because there’s a number on the spine, but I don’t know when it’s coming. I hope in the sequel—” he abruptly shut up, looking away.
“Oi, girl,” Harry said to her. “Stick to the rules, yeah?” He signalled for Jamie to take Love’s place.
“I’ve been wondering,” she said, picking at a loose thread in her jeans, “if…if the reason you don’t want me is because you’re gay. Because I think I could live with that. Because…then it’s not me.”
“Apologising,” Harry replied, heart in his mouth. He held up the paper bag with the book. “I brought a conciliatory gift?”
!” he burst out. “I read about it in class. Some Muggles believe that scents can have therapeutic effects. You said this helps you sleep?”
“Yeah.” Harry shrugged. It wasn’t a complete lie. He was feeling okay. Comfortable, even. It was always a bit strange, like there was this great physical relief and bliss, but there was also the part that was just okay.  It was the after that was usually a mess, that was the part he couldn’t control, that sometimes hated everything, and sometimes didn’t. What he’d tried to explain to Gladys last week, and that he wasn’t sure he’d really managed to get across, or understand himself. Maybe it’d be okay this time. It felt like it could be.
Harry considered what to say. Would Malfoy judge him for staying up until two to read it? The tiredness was really making itself known by now, and soon he had to leave for the first Little League practice. “I almost dropped it in the bath,” slipped out. “I didn’t, though! I just—I was reading it in the bath and it got late and, uhm, well I didn’t drop it.”
“I tried a soft coming out first,” she went on. “I told my parents I was bi because I hoped it wasn’t as bad as being trans, and that they could accept that—I had this idea that I could live with just being bi if it meant I could keep my parents. But Dad freaked out and nearly disowned me, Mum—well, she came around, and talked Dad around too. About a year later I couldn’t deal with that anymore and came out to them properly. Dad really did disown me then, and Mum looked at me like—well, you know how she gets. So that was that. I cut ties.”
The Montrose Magpies’ home pitch was the home for the Little League Quidditch Charity Series, and therefore also the venue for the press conference that started the Series off. The press weren’t the only ones who had shown up, however, as the Magpies were playing the Holyhead Harpies later in the day. The small crowd that had gathered on the stands was undeniably there for peeks at the Little League captains; Harry felt their eyes on him, in addition to the unforgiving glares of the cameras.
“I’m not—” Harry bit down on his tongue. “I just wanted to have a couple of pints first,” he said, pushing down the niggling fear and sense of wrongness, to somewhere deep enough that it couldn’t, wouldn’t, come back and bother him.
“All right. I’ll bring those up for you. The reading hall is down that way; grab a vacant desk and make yourself comfortable, and I’ll come to you. It shouldn’t take more than a few minutes.”
“Your delightful murder boy came by just before,” Mildred said, tutting. “I told him you were home sick, of course.”
“I don’t think people should have to earn their happy ending,” Harry said. “I didn’t want them to break up first. It was unnecessary. They could’ve just sat down and talked about their problems instead of being all dramatic and breaking up. I hate breakups. They tend to be pretty final.”
“No! I don’t know—maybe? I don’t mind!” Harry’s neck was burning. “I mean, I don’t know—I’m trying to make friends with you.”
“Yeah, I see how those are very different things,” Harry said, amused. Malfoy had delivered the explanation as succinctly as if he’d been giving a lesson, but far more excitedly. “It sounds like a fun class.”
The way Draco had phrased it reminded Harry of the way Gladys spoke sometimes. “I’m sorry, too,” Harry said. “I…” The speech he’d semi-prepared had flown out of his brain and now it was all scrambled six ways to Sunday. The book he’d gotten Draco was quite forgotten, the bag left sitting by the front door. “I
Malfoy saw something in Harry’s face, because his cheeks were pink enough to match the bomb he was holding. He put it back. “Maybe another time?” he asked, brushing pink dust off his fingertips. “I don’t mean to…give the wrong impression.”
“Don’t fucking touch me.” Harry kept himself out of reach, but finally took the kettle off the heat. He filled the mugs, dumping in the teabags with little care, and thrust one mug at her.
“Thank you.” Dean looked at the business card like it was made of gold, which for Dean it probably was.
An owl pecked at a window in the living room and Harry rushed to let it in, swallowing his bite of toast hurriedly. His heart was thumping. The owl dropped a thick envelope and took off again, and when Harry looked at it he realised it wasn’t from Draco. It was from Gladys.
He quickly cleared the rest of the table, dumping it all in the sink. Draco was filling it with hot water and soap, having taken to Harry’s Muggle methods of dishwashing (Harry reckoned the novelty would soon wear off), but Harry didn’t want to do the dishes now.
Harry paused his eating. “Ruined it? But…it was a happy ending. They won. Did you want them to lose?”
“Harry!” Both girls stood up. Harry’s cousin—Peony, and it was so much easier to think of her as Peony now that Harry was face to face with her—stepped forwards. “I’m glad you came.”
“Thank you,” he said to George with a grateful smile. His fingers were dusty. “Did you want to stay for dinner? We’re ordering in.”
“Yeah, okay,” Dean said, and Harry nodded along. He’d never afforded this much thought; he’d thought—like Dean—that magic could fix anything.
“The kids will be fine,” Draco was now saying. “They’ll play a good game.” He stood shoulder to shoulder with Harry at the edge of the pitch. The game would start soon, but Harry had a minute. Ginny was with the kids, just a short distance away, helping them with their equipment checks. “You’re a good captain. You’ve trained them well.”
“Everyone, grab a broom. Let’s start by having some fun—we’ll do two teams, six players on each, and just go. Are you ready?”
“Come here,” he said to Hugh and Betty, setting the kit down on one of the kid-sized tables in the middle of the room. His voice came out too brusque, and Harry bit his tongue.
“I finished the book,” Harry said, fetching Draco from his study for their usual Friday Lunch. “I brought them all, so you can take them back home.”
Harry rolled over, putting his back to the book, and was faced with the empty half of the bed that had used to be Ginny’s. It still smelled like her. He turned onto his stomach and drew his pillow over his head, where neither Malfoy nor Ginny could reach him, and fell asleep.
Ms Baxter ruffled Charlie’s hair. Whispering to Harry she said: “I’ve been teaching him what good sportsmanship is about.”
Lee ended up taking orders of refills for everyone (a pot of tea for Harry and Draco to share) and returned swiftly with an entire bottle of wine for Angelina, sparkly fairy brews for him and George, and several pints of Flaming Flurries. Draco had tensed up again and was keeping quiet.
“Oh, yeah, definitely, we can do the dishes first,” Harry replied, so relieved he could’ve laughed. He went to find a dishtowel, so he could help Draco, and came up with the one he’d transfigured. A quick tap and it was itself again.
“Your gremlins are going to win and you know it,” Draco said and when Harry was going to protest, he planted a kiss on his lips. “Shh.”
“Pointy hat? Those are kind of unfashionable,” Draco said, with a frown. “Only old people wear them, and people in uniforms, you know, like school or ministry.”
Charlie was on goal, and he blocked one of three shots, all performed by the same Chaser. Harry let Avery, Denise and Dorcas split the shots between them so they had two each, and each managed to make one goal. That set the score at 30-20 seven minutes into the game, all through penalties.
cry, which had been in Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom in sixth year. It was a terrible memory, and one that now seemed like it had happened to a different person in a different past.
Harry could’ve been drowning, but it didn’t matter. He would drown again, and again, and again, if it meant he could have Draco like this: a soft kiss at the edge of a Quidditch pitch, bathed in victory and happiness.
Instead of dwelling on it, Harry resolved to buy a book as soon as the opportunity arose. Which kind of book it would be he hadn’t really figured out yet. Maybe it would be a book about Quidditch. Maybe non-fiction of a different kind; Neville was putting out a revised and updated book of some kind about herbs in some context or other. Maybe he’d read it. Maybe he would pick fiction, if only he knew what kind of fiction he’d like to read.
The yelling wasn’t subsiding at all. The kids were unstoppable. Their families had poured onto the field to hug and kiss them and dance—Ginny was twirling Jamie and Love simultaneously, both girls shrieking with joy.
Little League Quidditch didn’t ban players, but the referees often sent the rowdy ones off-pitch to cool down for a bit and assigned penalty shots instead. Three shots per penalty, which meant that the Butterfly Bumpkins had six shots and Candy Cranes three (Harry did briefly wonder if Candy Cranes should’ve had another three, for Alice’s impressively violent butterflies, but Oliver seemed to believe they didn’t count as a foul).
“The short version? Therapy,” she said. “Years of it. I’ve been reaching out to people to make amends, or try to. Own up to all my bullshit so I can move on. You were the only one I hadn’t talked to yet, you’re…hard to find.”
“I’ll think about it,” Harry said, frowning. He couldn’t envision them ever becoming friends. But then again, he was friends with Pansy now, and she’d literally tried to give him up to Voldemort. He was friends with Draco—he was
Harry was at a loss for words. It hadn’t occurred to him that Draco would have such a different outlook on life than him, that he wouldn’t know—wouldn’t
“Can we talk about it?” she asked, inspecting the Snitch. It looked fine. “If me being here is going to be a problem—”
“YEAH!” the kids yelled, punching the air with him. Even Ginny joined in, though she was looking at him like he’d gone round the bend.
Parents still stuck around for practice, watching from the stands—not out of distrust of Harry, or worry for their children, but because they were as excited as the kids were. Harry suspected they also liked socialising with each other, which was a novel concept to him.
Harry thought the curve of Malfoy’s ear might’ve held the secrets to unlock the universe. “In the sequel what?”
They finished eating in silence, each of them seemingly deep in thought about some matter or other. Harry found his thoughts straying to Malfoy and his odd choice in reading materials. What would one want to read three thousand coroner reports for? He resolved to ask Malfoy about it if he were to see him again.
“Right, of course. Can’t have that.” Malfoy cracked the tiniest smile Harry had ever seen, and then very pointedly turned to the reports.
“I just mean,” he continued, looking at the drinks on the table, “that I want him to know it’s okay.”
The light from Flourish and Blotts spilled onto the street, catching on flecks of mica in the cobblestones. Harry stared at the sparkles, recalling that he only knew it was called mica because the countertop in his and Ginny’s apartment was stone, and had those flecks, and it was called mica because Ginny had told him so.
Maybe he could even…move in with Draco? Somewhere else, somewhere new. He looked at Draco, who had gone all pink again. Could he ask now? Or was it better to wait?
“He does, eventually. But until then there’s all kinds of bullshit,” Malfoy agreed. “I never said it was a good novel, just that it was a classic.”
Harry didn’t know. “…No,” he said. No house-elves? “I don’t get it. What have house-elves got to do with anything?”
“I think it does matter.” There was emotion in Ginny’s voice, something thick and heavy like regret. “I think we could’ve been happier.”
“Absolutely inspired, Harry,” Dara says, procuring her flamingo feather quill and pulling a horrible stack of paper from inside her desk. “Merlin, I love the Pizza Party Jar. The jewel of all Gryffindor-Hufflepuff collaborations.”
“I don’t think we’re going to fuck it up,” Harry says, even though all the odds are against them. He can’t imagine a universe where he wouldn’t want this, even though Draco is a prat sometimes and his arm is still dark with the mark. Those parts don’t really matter. “I really like you. So much.”
“That’s literally not even funny,” Draco replies, reaching up to fuss with his hair and streaking it black in process.
Malfoy laughs, and it’s derisive but Harry isn’t completely sure it’s directed at him. “I’m not an idiot. What do you want out of this?”
She giggles, waving back at him, and Harry is trying to process the situation. Draco is pink cheeked like he gets when he’s embarrassed, his hair a little mussed like someone’s put their hands in it. He keeps smiling, a soft genuine thing that’s becoming more and more familiar.
Draco didn’t respond right away, just let Harry’s lips hold against his just like the first time and then Harry knew that he had him. Draco moved ever so slightly, balling his fist in the fabric of Harry’s sleep shirt. He hitched one broken breath into Harry’s mouth, his eyes fluttering shut as their foreheads met.
“How come even Longbottom has kissed Harry but I haven’t!” Draco announces. None of this, absolutely
“Only like ten minutes,” she says. “Enough time to realize that we have been extremely got. Wands gone, no windows, haven’t a clue where we are… Worried sick about Jess. Rachel’s watching her today, but if she’s been kidnapped too, I don’t know what I’ll do.”
“Didn’t think you’d be back,” Harry said, his voice floating up from behind him, no footsteps forewarning his presence.
“No, it was nice,” Harry informs him. “You’re better at kissing than your friends, though. Blaise doesn’t try hard enough because he knows how hot he is.”
It begins to rain, one droplet after another landing on his glasses. He casts a shield charm over both of them just as it picks up, rain tapping unevenly on the upper barrier of the magic.
Millicient raises her hand to receive a kiwi, which Ginny tosses over to her. She also tosses one to Hermione, who drops it, and Neville, who doesn’t even attempt to catch it and has to go rescue it from under a chair. In this minor kerfuffle, Draco finds a way to return to his eavesdropping armchair and places his emotional support boner cushion firmly back in his lap, where it is sorely needed. Firmly planted in his chair, he leans very far over to nick an entire bottle of liquor from the floor. He brings it to his mouth, taking a long swallow before cradling it gently in his arms. He’s going to have wank material for the next year, possibly next year and a half, he thinks mournfully. It is pathetic that sharing an extended kiss with Harry Potter while all their friends watch is the sexiest thing that’s happened to him in months, but in his defense, it was fairly sexy.
“I was just-” Harry frowns, grimaces, then pinches his lips together. He knows he’s staring but he can’t stop, not with all the memories playing in his head, not with Draco’s lips lined in red. “What are you doing?”
Harry thinks that it’s probably a good sign that Draco’s feeling enough like himself to be properly difficult. “It was that or leaving you arse naked.”
Harry sighs, scrubbing his hand across his face. He can picture Hermione telling him he needs to talk about his ‘issues,’ which makes all of this even more acutely torturous. “I was really embarrassed,” Harry says reluctantly, more honest about it than he ever was with anyone else. In fact, he’d taken two weeks off and refused to talk about it with such vehemence that everyone mostly backed off. In retrospect, his inability to play it cool probably just made the whole thing worse. “The Prophet made it sound like more than it was.”
“For someone who has been very keen on being in my business, you seem awfully ready for me to leave,” Draco replies, looking thoroughly unimpressed. He redirects his attention to Antiques Roadshow, frowning at the rug the experts are examining. “They’re far overpricing that. The manor had one in the drawing room that we bought for half.” He seems to be making an effort at being extra-belligerent this morning, and if he weren’t camped out in Harry’s living room, he’d be worried that Draco was truly upset with him.
“He asked to switch dance partners with me and I told him no,” Harry replied, unpacking her stuff. “Apparently he’s been bugging all the Hufflepuffs and they all told him no too.”
Harry shrugs, trying to play it cool, like they didn’t go to a school for kids with magic, like he and Draco were anything like friends. “We learned mostly.”
Harry’s cheeks are flushed and he’s breathing very quickly through his open mouth, his chin tilted up. Draco leans in to kiss his neck, up near his ear and then down to his collar bones. Harry has his eyes squeezed shut and that means Draco can really look at him, at the way his curls splay across the pillow, at the muscular line of his shoulders. He is too beautiful, and it’s not fair. He’s too beautiful and he’s clutching Draco’s hip very hard and making quiet, breathy noises that are driving Draco insane. Draco has been on the lip of orgasm for at least a minute and every single second that he stares at the furrow in Harry’s brow brings him closer to the edge.
It was a little pathetic, he thought, with no lack of bitterness, as he took a shower so hot it burned a little. It wasn’t that he wanted to be real Harry’s friend or anything stupid like that, but he liked the way Harry was confident and still unsure, liked how his eyes sparkled when he got frustrated and how he was kind sometimes, unexpectedly.
“I told you she owled me, Harry. We were both very worried,” Hermione responds, taking a motherly tone with him. “We talked and Pansy managed to convince me that Draco had gotten his life together and I convinced her that you weren’t trying destroy Draco in some petty act of schoolboy vengeance. Which you aren’t doing, correct?”
“You do,” the snake said. “But you want to follow me, I can feet it in your footsteps. You’re very familiar with how darkness works, you know that if it was going to hurt you it would have started already.”
“So we’re really doing this then?” Harry asked, flipping the sandwich over and leaning against the counter to look at Draco.
Luna smiles at him, their almond shaped eyes crinkling with amusement. “You’ll have to try a lot harder. Try asking Ron if you want someone’s eyes to bug out.” They reach into a bundle of photos and begin sorting through them, the flip of paper distinct in the quiet room. “I don’t know if he’d put it like that.”
Your son whimpers in his sleep, he tells her, and I wish I didn’t know that. I wish I knew what song he played when he tapped his fingers like that on my stomach.
“Of course it makes sense,” Draco said, then shut his mouth tight and scowled like he wasn’t interested in saying any more.
“I think that what you do is much more important than being a fucking auror,” Draco replies. “But whatever.”
“Anthony, have you found a date to the Yule Ball?” Harry asked, swerving the conversation out of Draco territory.
“Just wake him up?” Draco asked uncertainly, sneaking another glance at Harry. His skin was illuminated by the lazy flickering of the lightning bugs, candy colors ghosting across his skin.
“Rumor was that you hated him too,” Harry replies, and it’s more callous than he intends. Draco just shrugs.
18. They all sat at the circular table. Harry had made dinner. Luna was braiding Ginny’s hair again, their hands moving as swiftly as birds, rings glinting in the orange firelight. Draco and Hermione were arguing and Neville was trying to peace-keep. Ron had already said something stupid and reckless and been shouted down by Ginny and they should have called it off then.
“I don’t think its funny,” Hermione replied curtly, and Harry tried to subdue her laughter. “And I didn’t ask about her, I asked about you.”
“Noted,” Harry says, just as a bright green frog and/or toad comes ribbiting across the path. He absolutely should have checked the particulars of this before they came. “No problem with that. Totally fine. May we come in and ask you a few questions? We’re part of the potion regulation division and know that you supply ingredients to a few different potioneers, is that right?”
In front of them, they had bridges bigger than themselves left to build, holes left to fill and secrets left to tell. They had friends who they knew would laugh and scream when they found out and lives to re-arrange around each other. They had healing to do and love to navigate. They had time to temper their barbs and learn to be better, time to learn to step softly and be careful with each other. They had afternoons in each other’s common rooms with warm tea and homework, evenings in each other’s beds and mornings the same. They had time to become real.
“I don’t think the plebeian lexicon has provided an adequate label for our situation,” Draco replied dryly. “Not enemies, not friends.”
He pushes through the curtain as a balding man pushes a tv onto the counter, Draco scrawling something on a sticky note.
“Thanks,” Harry said, awkward all over again. In the aftermath, all his half-dreamed thoughts of affection seemed so childish and improbable, since it was Draco and they didn’t get along, since it wasn’t Draco and it was just the forest.
Harry catches Draco’s eye and realizes that there’s absolutely no way they can do this casually. He opens his mouth to suggest something extremely incriminating, and then gapes like a fish for a few seconds. “My house?”
“I’m just awful at reading people,” he says, unable to resist the urge to mope. He feels wretched, trapped, and stupid and he doesn’t want to go back to Auror training, doesn’t want to go anywhere that isn’t the yellow warmth of Grimmauld place. “I don’t know how much longer I can keep doing this. It feels bloody awful. I feel like he’s trying to torture me. I’d call him a sadist but he doesn’t even seem to enjoy it.”
“May I?” he asks, and there’s a giggled yes. Harry peers inside, watching as Draco raises her hand and smells the pink bloom like a gentleman would kiss a lady’s hand. “It’s lovely. You don’t even need to wear perfume.”
“Coming!” a voice yells from the back, and Harry looks up at the rows of faded pictures that line the back wall as he waits. They’re all yellowed and curling at the edges, photos from the shop’s opening and of fancy looking refrigerators behind smiling people in clothes long out of style. A song Harry doesn’t recognize seeps from the back room and thunder rumbles outside. Harry runs a hand through his hair, letting himself feel washed out.
“I wanted to show you that despite your best efforts, I’m great,” Harry said, still looking at Draco, trying to draw some comfort from the fact he was there. Draco was there for him. He was undeniable proof there was at least one person who actually cared about him and his well-being. “That no matter how hard you tried, you couldn’t squash my magic or my will to live, or, or, my person. I still exist. I’m me. And I made it happen.”
“Same thing,” Lee announced cheerfully, shaking Draco’s hand across the table. “I’ll get us drinks, loves. Anyone else want a refill?”
Charlie was still having problems with his broomstick, and now the malaise had spread to Alice’s broomstick as well. Which was odd, because there’d been no problem in the morning, but now that the kids had had lunch and an hour indoors with colouring pencils, two broomsticks refused to comply.
Until then he wanted a few hours at least with the purple cloud bath bomb. It had cedar wood and cypress oils and violets, a seasonal thing that usually came out in February and retired again come summer, and that Harry loved—it was perfect for de-stressing. He’d gone and picked up a few after lunch with Hermione. Maybe he’d finish his coursework early, so he could read Malfoy’s book in the bath instead; it was about a robot war in space. Malfoy had said the robots had unconventional gender structures but were probably pretty gay.
“I gave most of them away. Donated them to the local communities. The ones that had had Muggle tenants often had historical value to the Muggles in the area. The rest, well. I sold some. All the land, most of it arable, some of it forest, I also sold or gave away. Some went to Muggles, some to wizards. And before you ask, all the proceeds went to charity.” Malfoy finished his tart. “Isn’t your break over?”
Harry had packed them off with their parents pretty quickly and set about collecting and packing up the equipment with Ginny. She hadn’t said much during the game that wasn’t Quidditch related, and the work went by quietly and amicably.
“I remember,” said Harry. “You told me that before.” He also remembered how Draco had looked those first few weeks at the archive. Tired, oddly void of emotion.
“About time you figured that out,” Padma commented. “You and Ginny were starting to get really painful to watch.”
“Sort of. They’re shaped like balls and when you drop in the water they fizz, so I guess that’s why they call them bombs? They don’t explode, but they move around and all. It’s fun to watch. And they smell great and make your skin all soft and they have different colours and sometimes glitter.”
Harry shuffled his chair closer. Draco was a bit taller than him, but it wasn’t a noticeable difference like this, so Harry put his arm around Draco’s shoulders, resting it on the back of Draco’s chair. “This good?”
Ron picked up the Prophet, which was open to a specific page, and showed him. There were two headlines on that page, one to do with Butterfly Bumpkins’ first win, with a quote by Harry highlighted directly underneath it. There was a photo of Harry and Ginny jumping and punching the air as Alice caught the Snitch. The other headline came with a photo of Harry and Draco on the Quidditch pitch. It was taken from a distance, but it was clear they were smiling at each other and kissing, the loop unmistakeable.
Harry picked up the Quaffle. This afternoon he was playing pretend Keeper, which really only meant levitating the Quaffle back into the air for somebody to try to grab it, because so far all they were good at was dropping it.
The kids were doing drills with a Golden Snitch and a bunch of distracting glittery or shiny objects. It was a drill he’d done with his Little League Seekers, who’d loved it, but it was a good task for the daycare, too—it was just difficult enough to keep them all focused, but not dangerous enough that Harry couldn’t afford to let his mind wander.
“No, no, it’s fine, it’s fine…” Harry’s throat tightened again. He didn’t know what ‘dissociating’ was, though it was obviously some therapy term, and he could guess at what panic attacks were. Malfoy was trying to be considerate. That was a whole other reason for his throat to go all thick. “It wasn’t that. It’s fine. I’ll tell you about it sometime.”
Scrolls and folders were stacked, some less neatly than others, all over the shelves and the desk, giving off the impression that this was the lair of an eccentric scholar rather than an orderly and finicky person.
“Yeah, I…have had other worries. I didn’t see or hear anything about…any of that, since those Order people told us the war was over. They said you’d won it. And. That was it, they left, and Mum and Dad went back to normal, and I tried to, and…well, here I am. More worried about the Gender Recognition Act than I am about wizards.” She shrugged. “It’ll come into effect next month, April, but there’s a transition period—funny that—and I won’t be able to get my new certificate until I’ve been living as a woman for six years, which I haven’t yet. That’s…my concern, these days.”
The selection in Flourish and Blotts was overwhelming. Harry only vaguely recalled it having been so in general; he hadn’t stepped foot in there since last time he’d had to get textbooks and that had always been during the back-to-school rush, so it’d been overwhelming for different reasons. Now the school season was in full swing, so the store wasn’t actually chock full of students and parents trying to get copies of
“That’s very good of you.” Harry was impressed; his knowledge of children didn’t reach far, but he was certain none of his own childhood bullies would’ve done this. Perhaps that was the difference—he’d had bullies, not friends who occasionally messed up. “Is that all, do you think?”
Harry wasn’t entirely certain he knew the difference between a butt dial and a booty call, having never had a mobile phone and also little interaction with the Muggle world since he left the Dursleys. He had the creeping sensation that Malfoy might actually know more about Muggle culture than he did. “What’s the difference?” he prompted.
“Well?” Harry grinned at them. “It’s a beautiful day to play some Quidditch and beat the DragonTAMERS to smithereens, don’t you think? Say YEAH!”
“It is also an anxiety thing,” Malfoy added, with a wry smile. “At least the first few times. I didn’t like sitting in here with strangers nearby.”
Falling in love was a strange feeling: a pain that couldn’t be classified or quantified or described. Sometimes it didn’t even feel like pain at all, but like a kind of bliss, bubbly and perky and boiling hot.
“I gave you the benefit of the doubt,” Harry eventually said. “I gave your mother the benefit of the doubt. I—” He swallowed. “I won’t say that it made all the difference. Just that it made a difference for me.”
All this was going through Harry’s head as he looked over the Quidditch pitch. Either this would be their last game, or they would get to go to the finals next weekend. The kids were clearly full of the same nervous energy Harry felt, getting into small fights with one another over silly things like standing too close, or leaning their broom over another’s, or having accidentally picked up a wrong pair of gloves. He and Ginny had had their hands full getting the kids ready, and now they were standing at the edge of the pitch elbowing each other and hissing.
Harry stared at her, but Mildred just smiled sweetly. “Ugh, whatever,” he said and pushed the trolley onto the levitating platform.
Malfoy blinked. “Oh! Sorry. There’s no party. This is for LARPing,” he said, enunciating carefully. “We’re both wizards.”
. Harry was struggling to remember the last time he’d had a civil conversation with Malfoy…that was to say, before he started coming to the Archive. Was it at the trials? Harry recalled sharing a few words with an exhausted Draco Malfoy in the halls at the ministry—Harry had been utterly wrung out at the time as well, testifying for and against so many people, standing trial himself, testifying, testifying, watching friends and enemies and everyone in between go from court room to holding cells to court rooms to freedom, or to jail.
Harry focused on what was happening in front of him. Charlie was having problems with his broom, it looked like. He had a lisp, which sometimes made it difficult for the broom to understand his commands.
get it,” she declared, getting to her feet as soon as the Mediwitch allowed, broom in hand. Harry thought she probably would—in the heat of the game, she seemed to have forgotten the last time she’d gotten knocked off her broom, and the fire she’d caused. Good. The last thing Harry needed was more fires.
Embarrassingly, Draco turned out to be such a fast reader that Harry realised that when they’d read that dystopian novel together, Draco must’ve been pacing himself so Harry could keep up with him. He could read an entire book in the course of a few hours, so while Harry would finish an assignment for Record-keeping Theory and Practice in an evening, Draco would read an entire novel.
“Did we win?” Harry asked, breathless, as he watched the Candy Cranes Chasers drop the Quaffle a short distance from the goalposts. Lee was yelling, the kids were running onto the pitch to meet their teammates, and Ginny was laughing.
Mildred made a sound somewhere between assent and dissent. “We’ll probably need that help more than ever with Geoffrey and two trainees gone.” She levelled a look at him. “You know, you could take the course and get certified, become a proper trainee and full-time archivist down the line.”
Not for the first time Harry wondered if he should get rid of the bed, or maybe transfigure it into a new one, since he’d shared this one with Ginny for years. He’d slept on her side tonight, and while it hadn’t really bothered him before to think of the bed like his and Ginny’s, having Draco in it now was…incongruous with that line of thought.
“Gather round,” he said, beckoning the kids to come over. They did, forming a tight half circle. “When you’re very, very little, like you are—” Avery protested, and Harry smiled, “—like you are now, before you grow big like me, sometimes emotions can be so big they don’t fit inside of you,” he said. “All kinds of emotions can become very big. And big emotions turn into magic sometimes.”
Harry blinked, his gut twisting. “No! Why’d you think—I’m not going to break up with you! I just like to talk on the train,” he tried to explain.
“Actually—yes, thank you—but actually, I have something for you,” he said, reaching inside his cloak. He drew out the little black notebook, and then also four books of differing sizes, all with brightly decorated covers. “Here.” He kept the notebook, but handed the books to Harry.
romance novels?” Draco had never mentioned them. He’d only introduced Harry to romance novels about straight people—was it possible that Draco just didn’t
, with that frown on her face, and Harry didn’t want their first night in the flat to end with a fight. That wasn’t how new beginnings should start, and it wasn’t what he wanted for their future.
“Someone needs to take this back,” Ginny said. “And to be honest with you, Harry, I’m not ready to meet him.”
“Is this okay?” Draco would say before he touched Harry, before he did anything, and Harry would say yeah, and it was okay. It was nice.
“Hmm.” Harry nudged the broom with his foot. The problem was obviously not the lisp. “I think it’s frightened. It’s playing dead, see?” He nudged the broom again.
“Avoiding…? I haven’t been avoiding you!” Harry sputtered. “I’ve just—I’ve been having lunch with Draco. And,” he added, “I’m in school now, and coaching a Quidditch team, so you’ll forgive me if I’m a little busy these days.”
“No, natural ingredients. That one is good for sleeping, it has lavender, ylang ylang and…tonka? I think it was tonka. I like it. It turns the water purple and it makes you really calm.”
“Just for us,” Harry said. “Could you put these here together in one bag, they’re for him, but put it all on one tab?”
“Do you want to take a letter to Draco for me?” he asked, even as he wondered what use it would be to write him. What could he possibly say that would make this evening less catastrophic and make Draco forgive him and set everything right?
Malfoy hadn’t come to the Archive that morning, which was both a disappointment and a relief. They didn’t really speak to one another—that communicative mishap Harry had committed on Monday had rather put a dampener on whatever friendship there might’ve been growing between them—but Harry had grown accustomed to Malfoy’s presence in the Archive and had been looking forward to seeing how he’d progress with his research today.
“I’m gay. And everyone in that epilogue, all those happy couples? They were straight. The one character I thought I could identify with was killed off. And maybe it’s stupid, but there’s no place for me in the real world, so when there’s no place for me in the books I read, it just—” Draco shrugged.
“Sounds like a lot of fun.” She goes back to her work, humming along to the music. Draco and Harry walk out into the December chill, careful not to slip on the ice just outside the door. It’s a clear night and they take their time out on the street, watching the cars and the lights of the stores.
41. At one point or another, Draco could have chosen to be safe. It might have been safer to quietly collude with the Death Eaters with the knowledge that the institutions would always protect them, that no one would ever face consequences, that Malfoys would always be able to pay their way back into the world’s good graces, as easy as pushing a body into a lake, weighing it down again and again no matter how many times it bloated and rose to the surface.
“Don’t you go to charity balls, Potter?” Draco had asked incredulously as he surveyed Harry’s closet, a mish mash of skinny jeans and faded tee shirts, and the dress robes he wore to Ron and Hermione’s wedding. “These robes are awful. Simply abysmal.”
It’s quiet when they enter, Draco clipping in and nearly letting the door smack Harry in the face behind him. Sunlight filters in through the long wall of windows, illuminating dust motes hovering above the burgundy training mats.
“Well, I’m eating it,” Draco responded as he sucked on the pit, which really wasn’t all that comforting since he was part of the forest too.
“No I can’t,” Harry says. “And I like it. I like the training and stuff. I want to like, help people.” He knows he’s speaking in cliches and he hates doing this in front of Luna. It’s worse than with Hermione, because Hermione at least wants to believe him.
Draco takes another sip of tea, dabbing at his forehead with his sleeve. “You just can’t think anything except for ‘out.’ That has to be the only thing you feel. Your mind has to be empty.”
Pansy looks like she’s trying very hard not to be charmed by Blaise and not succeeding. This is fair, Blaise is very winning. “Alright, Millie, what’s your excuse?”
“Not sure,” Anthony replied with a cheery shrug. “Hannah said that if no one asks her we’d go as friends, which sounds alright to me.”
“So, what,” Draco hisses, something wild in his eyes. “You had a crush on him so you tried to get with his girlfriend? So you could fuck her and feel close to him? That’s sick, that’s fucking sick, Potter.”
Draco sighs, holding eye contact and looking uncomfortable. Harry sits and waits, feeling the weight in his chest and the tiredness creep in behind his eyelids. Knowing this is all training, that he could walk out at any moment, only makes the fact that he’s going to stay even worse.
“Most people I know don’t do any of it,” Potter replies. The silence hangs heavy again and Draco breathes in for seven and out for seven three times.
“I don’t think Anthony was doing the box thing,” Harry says uncertainly, nearly stumbling over her feet when she tried to talk.
I don’t like your new haircut. It’s foul. I don’t know if you’re trying to be a new person or whatever, but you never should have cut your hair off. It was beautiful. I wanted to touch it. Not that your ego needs to know. Whatever. Tell anyone I told you that and I’ll kill you. As if you’ll ever know.
Draco nods stiffly, letting Harry grab him and keep him close, apparating to just outside the hospital. They stumble away from each other, their proximity making nerves crawl up Harry’s spine. Draco is warmth and soft cotton and he smells like mint and spice and he tries not to attach intimacy to the moment. He leads Draco inside, realizing belatedly that he doesn’t have any idea about whether or not he’s actually to be trusted.
Harry pressed against him, rubbing his cock against Draco’s thigh as he jerked him off. He was vaguely worried they’d tumble over, neither of them in possession of enough of their faculties to stand.
Harry nods, staring at the nondescript lettering like he’s waiting for it to change or at least mean something different to him.
Draco didn’t move, just stared down at her like she was trying to find something to say but didn’t have any of the right words.
“What are you daydreamin’ about, HP?” Dara asks, perching like a bird in one of the chairs he has arranged in front of his desk, her strappy boots squeaking against the leather.
Harry remembers his conversation with Dara, and knows the answer is only ‘maybe’ as he begins to nod. “The leads you found are really good, hopefully one of them pans out.” Draco doesn’t respond at first, and Harry realizes that the emotion lurking in his expression is fear. It’s why he says the next bit, even though he doesn’t know it for sure and shouldn’t be promising anything. “We’ll solve it, it’ll be alright.”
“I don’t smell like a lake to you, do I?” Draco asked Pansy during Potions the next day as he gave his arm an irritated sniff and then shoved it under her nose.
“Be careful,” Ron said as he left, reopening his Quidditch magazine and flipping to where he’d left off.
“Then I won’t tell.” It looked like it was paining her, the secret already tugging at the frizzy ends of her hair but he trusted her because he could see she felt the weight. “He’s been better since he started coming here. That’s what matters to me.” She smiled at him, fragile like night blooms. “Goodnight, Draco.”
Dara salutes and goes to find the bathroom, leaving the rest of them sprawled out in the living room, quite exhausted and fairly trampled.
“Yes,” Draco replies quickly, then seems to shrink back into himself. Harry glances over at Hermione, who he can’t remember ever looking less impressed with anything in her life.
“We need some way to figure out if the rest of the potioneers brewing the lycanthropy potion have been affected, but we can’t do that without some way to test their batches,” Harry explains. “I don’t know what that test looks like, since I’ve never listened to any of our potions consultants in my entire life, but I’m sure you know. The faster you can do that, the faster we can figure out the scope of what we’re dealing with and hopefully help us figure out who’s behind this.”
“Yes, Headmistress, Hannah and I have been working in the common room every night and I have been getting better,” Ernie said, looking miserable.
Harry almost mockingly makes the sound back to him out of habit, but at the last moment reminds himself that he’s trying to be civil. Instead, he gives the menu a perfunctory examination, folding it back up almost immediately. He’s come here after shifts often enough that he practically knows it by heart.
“How would you feel if I did want that?” Draco replied, stopping near the window with an imperiousness that Harry knew she’d never be able to achieve.
Real life prowled with beady eyes in the darkness between the trees but Harry squeezed his eyes shut and tried to let himself just be, gave himself this moment and the feel of another body. Draco pressed him back against the ground, crawling on top of him with calculated insistence and there was nothing but that, only Draco pouring back into him.
Harry didn’t consider himself unscarred, but he’d wandered out of the forest into a world that wanted him to be okay again, into a world that was healing alongside him. There were some mornings he couldn’t leave his bed and face any of it, but much more often he could bring himself to put one foot in front of the other for the whole day.
Draco squeezed his eyes shut, feeling guilt and desire pool in stomach until he couldn’t tell the difference between the two. “No, I expect not.”
The second one is from Ron, it reads: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. just kidding. but haha. Hermione is telling me this is mean to send but look at your FACE. Anyway I’m mostly just writing to you at the breakfast table because Hermione is and I wanted to be included. Snogs Galore, Ronald
“Well,” Ginny says after a few moments of very alarming silence. “That just felt like watching the first thirty seconds of amateur porn. I don’t know why I thought that was going to be a normal thing for us to do. Who wants a kiwi?”
“Are you curious about where I go at night?” Harry asked after a small silence, Ron’s earlier words tugging at him.
“She probably hoped that you two would end your ridiculous feud and actually work together,” Hermione said sagely. “Which you could do. That would be quite good.”
They circled each other like cats or water around a drain until finally, finally, Harry opened his parched mouth and yelled truce. He waited until Draco’s head dipped in a feverish nod before Harry allowed himself to collapse, his knees hitting the mat with an uneven thud.
Harry looked at Hermione in surprise, amused by the strong set of her shoulders. She looked like she did when she was championing a new cause, a light in her eyes like she was trying to fix something that wasn’t quite right.
After brunch - which is delightful actually, Ron was correct about his scrambled eggs hypothesis - Harry does his grocery shopping and tries to put off coming home. He’s hoping Draco won’t be there, is hoping he is, and knows there’s no way he will be after Harry snapped at him.
“I was fixing a cup of coffee, he sidled up to ask me my opinion on ethical polyamory, I pretended I had food poisoning and needed to vomit, and then I ran,” Ron says. “A harrowing experience. When will that man learn basic conversational boundaries. Or hygiene.”
Ginny is holding her hand to her heart, looking somewhere between genuinely moved and nearly hysterical. She’s still kind of sitting on Harry, which is bringing Draco’s ambient jealousy up to a persistent hum. “And are you queer, Neville?”
“Oh, you mean messy and ridiculous?” He replies, petulantly ruffling his hair to try and ruin it further.
“You could maybe orchestrate an injury?” Anthony suggested, earning himself points in Harry’s book for audacity.
Draco nodded, the arm he’d slung around Harry’s waist resting there like something poisonous. Harry found himself running his eyes over the imperfections on Draco’s body, all the places his veins ran blue under his pale skin, the messy bits of scar tissue and the cruel whorl of the dark mark.
“You really want to know, don’t you?” Draco asked, pausing with his tie half tied. “Why do you want to know so much?”
Draco gave her the most perfunctory of goodbyes, made sure Harry remembered to collect his hat, and then they left.
Harry almost stumbled over his own feet as his heart skipped a beat. “Feel dead? How?” The same way Harry felt? Like there was a…something missing? An emptiness inside?
“That’s precisely what’s so interesting!” Malfoy gestured with his fork. “Muggles don’t think magic is really
Draco just gestured at all of Harry. “This,” he said. “Here, I made badges.” He pinned one to Harry’s front that said
“Oh, that—I haven’t got any…I’m still looking into that.” Harry shrugged, trying not to look as awkward as he felt. He hadn’t technically decided he wanted to do this—he’d only been aware it was a thing for about twelve hours—but it was nagging at his brain and his gut, and Charlie’s enthusiasm was only stoking that fire, even as he balked at the paperwork. Harry had no idea where to even start with this thing. “I’ll owl you once I know more about it?” he offered.
“That’s rich coming from someone who couldn’t get out of bed for six months,” Harry snapped, and instantly regretted it.
Charlie, Avery, and Alice were standing together, in the middle, Charlie already wearing Keeper gear. The rest of the kids Harry didn’t know as well. “Hi,” he said.
“Nothing caught fire,” Harry reassured them. “She cut all the hair off. I was bald as a baby, except for a bit in front to cover this little scar here because she didn’t like that either. And all night I was so scared I couldn’t sleep because I was worried the other kids would make fun of me.” He paused for a dramatic effect, giving the kids the opportunity to gasp in the right places. “Do you know what had happened in the morning?”
Ginny just nodded and waved them off, so Harry went to the changing rooms. His own robes were less flashy than Draco’s, being simply cut and black (though the fabric felt much more luxurious than what he usually wore), but the tailor had wanted to put him in a short robe with tightly fitted trousers instead of the more common long robes, muttering something about the shape of his legs that Draco had very vocally agreed with. Draco had also, upon learning that Harry didn’t own a single pair of boots, splurged on a pair to go with the outfit. These new boots were nearly knee height, shiny black with silver fastenings, and matched his new (also short) cloak, which had a single silver clasp holding it closed in front.
“Yes and yes. And no, you don’t have to wear Muggle clothes.” Harry racked his brain for his schedule for the next week. “I can do…Wednesday next week, after my shift? I have to go to my Archive Studies course afterwards, but it doesn’t start until seven, so we have some time.”
Then he went to sort out all the documents Draco had piled up over time in the borrowed study. The painting on the wall was chipper, the hummingbird in it flitting about, the painted sunlight glittering off its iridescent feathers. Unless somebody else wanted to use the room, Harry probably wouldn’t see that hummingbird for a while.
“Yeah,” Harry replied. This was more in line with what he’d wanted when Draco had suggested a bath. It wasn’t comfortable exactly, Harry was still too unsure of what Draco wanted to truly relax, but he was warm now, and he had tea and scones and Draco so close he could smell his hair and feel the heat of his body.
“Oh.” Harry, suddenly feeling small, decided to take interest in his food. This meant staring at it, since he was still feeling queasy, and now his insides were turning into hard rocks, grinding against one another. “Was it anything I said?” he eventually asked, unable to bear the strange silence anymore, or the odd way he was feeling.
books that Sirius and Remus had given him. Harry placed the books in the bookcase: they all fit neatly into the topmost shelf, with room to spare.
“No, listen. I’m not going anywhere. You don’t need to put yourself through…all that, to keep me around. You don’t have to. Do you understand? You don’t have to.” There was an intensity in Draco’s eyes that Harry hadn’t seen in a long time.
The owl gave him such a deprecating look that Harry snarked back. “I don’t care what hour it is.” Deciding on writing Draco anyway, he tore a page from his notebook.
“I noticed,” Harry said. Draco had pressed Harry’s hand to his cheek, and that simple act was enough to make Harry’s heart expand to bursting. “Can I ask you about something spontaneous?”
Pansy showed up then, with Padma. “What’s up boys? Anything exciting happen?” They took the other side of the booth, small glasses of fizzy whiskey floating in after them. Harry listened to Dean and Seamus fill them in on the horse farm, making good work of his ale all the while.
Harry tried to locate a spark of desire within him and came up empty. All he found was love, burning bright and strong in his heart. He’d have to use that. Make do. “I love you.”
“Yeah—no—doesn’t matter, I guess. I’m going anyway.” He took Draco’s hand and squeezed it. “Let’s go. Now. No point in dawdling.”
“Read it and find out.” Malfoy took out his notebook and pencil, and Harry understood the conversation was over.
Hilde was hooting in her cage when Harry entered the living room, so he went over to let her out for a night hunt. She rubbed her beak against his hand, but didn’t show any signs of wanting to go out.
. Much as Harry doubted that Dudley truly had any positive emotions towards him—an entire childhood of torment was evidence counter to that—Dudley had nevertheless shown Harry a spark of common decency on that one, single day.
“I went to your house, but your mum said you'd gone to the Archive, and Mildred said you'd come here—”
Harry never wanted to see them again, but the idea of looking in their eyes and saying, unequivocally,
Harry couldn’t help smiling. “There’s also one shaped like a robot. And there’s a galaxy one. You might like those too.”
“Yes, exactly!” Harry’s gut flooded hot and bright. “It was—there were several aspects to it, and it took almost the entire book until the mechas could reach that point of, of, vulnerability, that point of no return, and after, they were both changed. In the literal, physical, sense, I guess, because the data sharing meant some code got rewritten and they were different, but also—they finally understood each other. That’s when the war stopped.”
“Communication is key,” she continued. “Breaking patterns is difficult, but it can be done. You will be essentially reconfiguring a lifetime of behavioural patterns, Harry.”
“I know I’ll be fine. Can’t help being anxious anyway. That’s just how it is.” Draco adjusted his robes, though there wasn’t a thing to adjust; his collar was straight, the brocade lapels flush against his chest, and the light cape over his shoulders draped just right.
If she was surprised, she didn’t show it. “Of course.” She folded it open carefully and turned it so that it was facing him. “Do you see yourself in this?”
Harry frowned. “The what?” He had almost finished his pint and was considering getting another round for the table, or maybe something to eat.
“You babysit?” Draco asked. He was speaking softly, softly enough that Harry might not have heard him over the noise of the pub if it weren’t for the fact he’d felt Draco speak. Harry squeezed him gently.
“I guess, but…I mean, they’re robots, not…people, or animals. It wasn’t about…well, you know. Genitals. Carnal pleasure.” He wasn’t sure Malfoy would understand, and he wasn’t sure he wanted to talk about the whole thing in the first place. But he’d been burning up inside since reading that book, with the feeling that maybe the author understood—because the author had written a book about a cast of characters for whom sex had nothing to do with the body, inasmuch as the body could be separated from the mind, when one was a robot. “It was about vulnerability and trust.”
Or maybe the kids were just getting bigger and as a result having bigger emotions. He’d had Charlie, Avery and Alice in his care since they were two, Betty had joined six months later, and Hugh a few months after that. He’d have the lot until the end of spring, and then Charlie, Avery, and Alice would be off to school full time and Harry would have to take on three new kids, or…let them all go and find another line of work.
It would be at least three weeks before anyone had games to play, as the schedule wouldn’t be drawn up and revealed until the press conference the following week. Until then, Harry had to register the team name, so they could join the pool, get the uniform specs to the sponsor, and then…well, he had to make sure the kids could play a halfway decent game of Quidditch.
“Yes. Have you seen Draco?” Harry was getting impatient. “He, uh, was supposed to come meet me here.”
“Why not? Everybody deserves a happy ending.” Harry pushed his bowl away and got up to fetch the book he’d gotten for Draco earlier that day. Draco followed him.
At the front desk, Harry tapped the ex libris list with his wand and flagged the documents that’d been taken out of the trolley during the day and saw that Malfoy had made his way through three hundred and sixty-four of the reports. Impressive. Harry then transferred the information to a new request form, deleted the flagged items, and gave Malfoy the form.
“I didn’t!” Hugh sniffled. “It’s my favourite bat and I always use it but you took it anyway even though I always, always—”
“Yeah, Rhosyn. I’ve met her, she seems nice.” Harry shrugged, then patted down his pockets. He’d stuffed his change of clothes and shoes into a pocket in his robes—not an ideal place, but Draco’s tailor was a genius with pocket charms, so it all fit comfortably and weightlessly—but he needed his Muggle wallet for the trip, and for the café.
“There’s nothing wrong,” Harry protested. “I’m just tired. Daycare was a mess today because Hugh and Betty were feeling left out, Avery and Alice were acting like royalty and Charlie wouldn’t shut up for one second about that goal he saved—”
The documents didn’t take long to sort, and Malfoy had settled beneath the meadow painting in less time than it took to prepare a cup of tea. The meadow was sunny, snowdrops and purple crocuses peeking out of the grass, and a few birds were flittering about the tree. As usual, Malfoy didn’t notice.
Then he collected his things and went home, where he knew Draco would be waiting with dinner, probably wearing another dish towel as an apron. He hadn’t said what he’d make, but Harry wanted nothing more than to find out, and kiss him, and tell him everything about his list.
Julie, clearly uncomfortable with this awkward meeting, spoke up. “Call me if you need me? I’ll be just around the corner.”
A blizzard, not entirely unexpected, forced Harry to cancel the second Little League training and reschedule for Saturday. He was also forced to keep the Quidditch Daycare indoors, so he pulled out the box of art supplies and let the kids have at it; Valentine’s Day was coming up soon, and he’d thought letting them make cards would be a nice activity. As it turned out, they all wanted to make Valentines for their family members.
“Really?” Ginny raised an eyebrow. “You mean to tell me you haven’t actually been running a non-profit daycare for the past three years? I happen to know that Betty isn’t the only one whose parents aren’t paying for you minding her.”
“There—” Harry paused, staring at the ledger. One and a half pages of it were dedicated to coroner reports, with several dozen cross references listed. “Were you looking for anything specific? We have a lot of those things. Sorry—a substantial collection, is what I should say.”
They agreed on a time and place, and Peony took down Harry’s address. “Looking forward to it, Harry,” she said, and Harry awkwardly stammered a reply and hung up.
Mildred gave him a pat on the back and some kind words, and then Harry left, Apparating straight home instead of walking.
“Yes! You’re getting it. Of course there’s approximately four times as many house-elves living in the castle than are captured and in service, I’d say maybe even seven times as many.”
“A real team?” She frowned, then glanced at her son. Charlie was watching the pitch; the players had started filing out. “What do you mean?”
“I see you haven’t lost your way with words.” Malfoy smiled. “Therapy helps. It’s not just about treating my anxiety. It’s also…depression, PTSD—Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,” he clarified, “relating to, well, a lot of things. Accepting responsibility. Learning to live. To forgive. To fix the parts of me that are…that need fixing.”
“Okay.” Harry regarded her. She looked the same as she always did, if a little jittery. Probably not having second thoughts, then. “Are you okay?”
Befuddled, Harry made some hasty excuses—“Be right back, we’ll be just a moment…”—and followed Draco outside. “What’s wrong?”
These old doubts were really starting to get tiresome. Harry tried to clear his mind and focus on the game instead, on Ginny’s flying—she really was a phenomenal player—but he couldn’t get rid of the coil of anxiety in his belly.
“Yes,” Draco confirmed. “I can replace the broken leg with a new one just the same, stained to be identical to the rest of the piece. Depending on the type of wood the repaired part might look different from the rest of the piece, which is where the staining comes in—what I’d recommend in that situation is actually sanding down the entire piece to remove the previous stain, and then stain the repaired piece at once, to give it a uniform look. If the piece is unstained, untreated wood, say—pine, which is a bright wood that turns darker with age, sanding the older parts or in other ways bleaching or lightening the wood might not be advisable in which case aging the new part might be a better option.” He stopped, turning crimson. “I apologise, I did not mean to go on. Did you have a chest of drawers you want looked at?”
Harry laughed. “Thank you, Charlie, but I think I’ll give these cards to my friends, because I love them very much,” he said. “Have you finished your card? Do you want me to help you write a message?”
Oh. Harry couldn’t help but stare; the answer was so…unexpected. And odd. “I thought…never mind. I just don’t think I’ve ever known anyone who genuinely enjoys rain.”
“There aren’t any shoes dropping,” Harry said, though he couldn’t help but wonder—what if sex was a shoe?
Harry’s chest tightened. “I’m not,” he said, “I don’t think so, anyway. But it’s not you, I swear. I love you. I just…” he trailed off, trying to find the words.
“I wish!” Malfoy laughed, then cleared his throat, as if he was embarrassed he’d laughed at all. “I first read it at too young an age and it left quite the impression on me.”
“No, no more naked kissing in an extremely romantic setting until we are definitely no longer talking about my mother.” Draco withdrew his hand, crossing his arms. “Which is it?”
“What is going on with you?” Ginny asked him, as she sent the Bludger back into circulation. They were training the kids on formations today—that is to say, just the one formation—in anticipation for the first game, which was going to take place that Sunday.
“You’re saying Ginny was a…” Harry couldn’t bring himself to say it. He’d loved her. He still loved her. And he knew she loved him. She wasn’t like the Dursleys, and he hated even thinking the thought that she could be. “She didn’t
He looked like a wizard—he looked like he belonged on the cover of a Muggle novel, while also looking like the smartest wizard Harry had ever met. He dropped whatever he was holding and went to meet him.
“Geoffrey just got handed a massive collection, an entire estate’s worth, down in Kent, so he’ll be doing that for the foreseeable future,” she said. “It’s months of work, and he’s taking two trainees with him. We need somebody to cover the private research. That’s your murder boy friend here, and three other rooms. I can get Annie to cover the mornings and Tuesdays, but we need the extra help.”
“That’d be my second choice…actually I was kind of thinking of getting a nice chair to read in. It seems like it would be a good thing, right? A corner with a comfy chair and a bookcase and a lamp.”
“Did I like it? I fucking loved it,” Harry grinned and drew him into a kiss. Draco squeaked, but melted into the kiss anyway.
“I don’t know.” Ginny sighed. “Maybe. Hindsight isn’t always clear. I don’t think either of us were ready then, even if…”
“Go on, try it.” Harry nodded at Alice, who’d been poking her broomstick with the tip of her shoe. Charlie, he knew, didn’t like an audience, so if he could get Alice up and running, the bunch of them would disperse and remove all attention from Charlie.
, but they keep writing stories about magic—wildly inaccurate but nonetheless amazingly imaginative stories—and many of them are superstitious, which is a certain kind of belief in magic, and they have folklore and mythologies that clearly stem from a much older time, from before the Statue of Secrecy, that they still adhere to to a degree, and there’s the entire alternative medicine thing, which closely resembles magic but isn’t, and—” He flushed red.
you know and put them in that pub—Big Gay Pub Night, all right—” he cut himself off, wide-eyed and wild.
“They've got this,” Draco said, coming up on his right side and gently bumping their shoulders together. “Stop worrying.”
, or anything else off the Hogwarts curriculum. This time around, Harry could actually see the store’s contents for what they were.
“I’d say!” This was Ron. “Bloody hell, mate, I was expecting to have to wipe you up from the floor.” He slapped a hand over his face, rubbing his chin. “You all right, then?”
Dean’s eyes lit up and Seamus looked ready to cry. “Yes! Thank you!” Dean said triumphantly, thumping the table. He gestured at Draco. “
“I’m not sure I’m enjoying it so much as I’m baffled by it,” Harry answered. He came out from behind the desk and walked with Malfoy to his study. “You said it was a coming-of-age story, right, so I thought it was about growing up, or something like that, but…”
And if Harry had to be completely honest with himself, he missed Draco’s presence at the Archive as well.
“You’re not staying,” Harry said. He looked at her. “I—” What was there to say? What he wanted, she wouldn’t—couldn’t?—give him, and what she wanted…Harry couldn’t give her either.
“Manual will do it,” Harry replied, inexplicably charmed. “Sorting by hand,” he clarified at Malfoy’s uncomprehending look. “Just leave everything where it is, and it’ll still be where you left it when you come back. You can get creative with it all later. Build piles and stacks and that kind of thing. Small forts.”
There was also the fact that he wouldn’t actually be able to get a full team, even if he somehow had kids lined up to join; he ran a Quidditch-themed part-time daycare, not a sports team or a Quidditch class. As a registered childminder he could only be responsible for the care of up to five children. If he wanted to enter the daycare into the league, he’d have to sort out what could only be a terrifying load of paperwork, and then find two more players. Maybe even extras, to rotate… it wasn’t impossible, but it was a change, and a challenge, and Harry had been walking in the same groove for a long time now.
“I had a few minutes so I thought I’d say hi,” Harry says, even though it’s not enough to explain this. Draco already knows he’s ridiculous and that’s beginning to be okay with him.
Harry tilts his head back, thinking about the way Draco moves, how everything he does is careful. “You’re so different, now.”
“That’s right,” Rob says. “You can come in, but I have some very important tadpoles I need to babysit later today, so I can’t be long.” Rob jimmies open the door to his cottage, holding it to reveal a cozy interior that feels like the slightly damper version of Hagrid’s hut. Rob gestures to a set of bright green wooden chairs, settling into one of his own.
“Which it is,” Ron offers. “So I’m minding my business, eating a sandwich, when Malfoy comes running into my office. Which, frankly, is a surprise.”
“As touching as that is—and it was kind of touching actually, very nice, Neville—” Pansy turns her attention away from Neville, who looks markedly less nervous once everyone stops looking at him. “I have a few remaining questions. Blaise, what the fuck?”
“He’s still testy about the moon thing,” Jasmine says, and Draco gives her a stern look, which sends her into a fit of giggles.
“It’s not just that,” Harry replies, because liking a man wouldn’t be the end of the world, but Draco is more than just some guy. “You know him.”
Harry tries to fashion his expression into something resembling composure. He is quickly becoming concerned about this whole enterprise, particularly as Connie pours tea rather aggressively into tiny pink tea cups.
“Don’t stop on my account,” Harry teases, liking the way Draco’s cheeks go a little pink. Harry remembers vaguely that he’s always been like that, going rose tinted whenever he felt anything too strongly. Ron’s the same way - tomato colored at the slightest bit of embarrassment - and it’s always amused him endlessly.
“We should both be so unlucky,” Draco said tiredly, letting Harry’s fingers drop with a sigh. Something in the forest swept up around them, warm and comforting, and Draco looked around wildly, feeling the ground shift between his feet as everything grew dark. He tried to reach out for Harry again, almost said his name as the world shifted around him, before he was deposited back at the entrance to the forest, tired and heavy hearted.
“What’s he done now?” Dara asks. Their daily run ins with Millence Filbin, the most irritating and horrible secretary known to Wizardkind, would be untenable if they weren’t so ridiculous they crossed over into hilarity.
“You’re ridiculous,” Draco says, though there’s no heat behind it as he leans back into Harry’s arms, his breath shuddering only a little. “I’m going to class.”
“It’s not boring,” Harry replies, letting Draco lean on him as they walk down the stairs and along the empty sidewalk. It’s chilly, but Draco seems too drunk to be bothered even as Harry shivers.
“We know, boys,” Pansy clarifies, smiling even wider when she registers their shocked expressions. “Or at least suspected.”
“You don’t think I offended him did I?” Harry asks as soon as Jay makes a graceful exit into the kitchen, and Draco does that snort laugh again.
He knows that it would be idiotic to say something like ‘I wonder what you’d have been like as an Auror,’ though he does wonder if Draco would have had a knack for it. Not a can-do, no-fear partner like Dara, but careful, keen. Even in the years where they’d been at each other’s throats, no one would have said that Draco wasn’t a worthy adversary.
First, was the darkness. The kind that sucked all the air out of a space and laced his lungs with something heavy. Then, was the noise, and there were three: hissing, biting, and sliding. Then there was the snake, creeping up up behind him, or in front of him, or onto someone he loved.
Draco pauses, looking up at Harry with raised eyebrows. Harry feels idiotic but tries to power through it. Feeling conflicted and ridiculous seems to be a large part of maintaining this relationship, and if it means he can keep Draco close he’s just going to have to be okay with it. “Which one?”
“I see,” Draco replies, a shiver running through him. Harry almost offers him his scarf, but he can’t imagine that Draco would accept it. “Any grand plans for you tonight?”
Harry tries to think if he’s ever seen Draco be this gentle. He keeps noticing it, the gentleness, blooming behind the sharp way he speaks and the deliberate way he moves. It’s not like how he used to be, but it suits him, seems natural to the way he is now.
“How could you let anyone else do it,” Harry babbles, angry and incoherent. “Anyone who wasn’t you.”
Harry sighed, watching him slump off as she entered Advanced DADA and sat with a thump next to Hermione. “I think I just crushed the last of Ernie Macmillan’s will to go on.”
“What kind of answer is that?” Draco asked testily, crossing his arms over his chest and shivering in the chilly air. Harry cast a warming charm over both of them, the swirl of it ruffling Draco’s hair. Draco fussed with the few loose strands, looking pensive and perturbed. “That’s how I found out, you know.”
Draco snorted at that, smiling as the snake slowly crawled back up his arm and found a home around his shoulders. “Of course it does, only you would be so stupid as to say something like that.”
“I seem to remember you owning a lot of pink,” Harry said, recalling Draco flouncing around in a bright pink cloak in the winter of their first year. She’d been a bit jealous of it at the time, but in retrospect it was quite hilarious.
Harry reaches for Draco’s arm, meeting his eyes as he raises it to his mouth. The Dark Mark, faded and gray, is stark against Draco’s skin and Harry presses his mouth to it, Draco’s breath catching in his throat as he does.
The forest welcomed him back in when he appeared at her edge, the sharp swell of his magic reminding her of the history he’d left in her depths, both blood and youth and the sticky scent of fear.
“Sorry,” Harry mumbled insolently, sticking her elbow back up, only to have Draco shove it level to the ground. “Can you not fucking manhandle me?”
“Cool,” Harry replied with a nod of his own and Draco felt the word ‘truce’ grow like crocuses in his lungs.
Harry nodded, unable to find sense in any of it, in Draco or in the mirage, in the forest or what she gave him. Maybe it was the truth because the forest told him, maybe it was the truth because Draco did, or maybe it was a lie meant to patch him up and make him a little less sad.
As Harry runs his preliminary survey of the wards, he’s pleasantly impressed to find that Draco had been right about their quality. The spellwork is clever and layered, filled with evil little traps and switchbacks, and their threads indicate to him everyone who’s passed through them over the course of the month in a slow trickle of detailed information. Harry is particularly impressed by a trap door charm that sends any wood-be burglar down into a crevice where they’ll be very stuck until rescued.
Harry was waiting for the sudden movement, for Draco to break and kiss him quick like he always did, but he just held Harry’s wrist, that strange look on his face. When he finally did move it was slow like he was trying not to spook him, his mouth finding Harry’s neck and pressing a careful kiss there.
Even if some horrible chain of events ever allows you to read this, I expect that by then I will have been kissed by another. By that I mean I will be dead. Dementors make terrible lovers, you know. See? I’m capable of humor, there’s another thing you never knew about me.
“Why does it matter so much to you?” Draco bit out, and it barely scraped on the way out because he didn’t even know why he’d done it, just that Harry had seemed so alarmed and the forest wanted him to. He was beginning to think that the forest hadn’t finished unfolding her plans, and was just as nervous as he was curious.
Very few things are known about the Forbidden Forest. From above, the forest measures approximately ten by thirteen miles, however, no one in recorded history has ever walked from one side to the other. The flora and fauna of the Forbidden Forest remain largely undocumented for a variety of reasons. 1. The forest possesses multiple climate zones and swiftly changing seasons. 2. Many plants present in the depths of the Forbidden Forest are documented nowhere else in the world and seem to resist both name and categorization on a primal level. 3.Those who attempt to document the secrets of the forest find themselves with wiped muggle technology and blank sheets of paper, wandering out years later with only a vague feeling of unease. It is better, most likely, just to observe such a strange, savage thing. Or, better yet, to stay far away from this wild magic altogether.
Harry and Jasmine slide off their stools to watch as Draco runs a demonstration, combining the test potion with the compromised lycanthropy potion. When the two combine, they turn a sickly, sludgy green. “If there’s nothing wrong with the potion, it’ll turn blue. Any tampering or faulty potion making, and it’ll turn green like this. Even you couldn’t mess it up, Potter.”
“You forgot,” Draco prompts, and he’s starting to look almost angry. “You just let me. You let me. I thought Severus had taught you, I thought you knew what to do.”
Draco leans down to wash his face and Harry watches him keep his eyes closed after he finishes, the water dripping from his nose and eyelashes back into the sink as he breathes.
“After all we’ve been through, Potter? Truly, I’m offended,” Draco drawled from behind him, making him jump and turn around.
“And for the things I said about you,” Draco added, even though she was something foreign and beyond him. She was still a better witch than he’d been a wizard, still more worthy of Harry. He thought maybe that had been some of why he’d always found it so easy to hate her. “And to you.”
“You don’t happen to know how Luna got those beads on there, do you?” Hermione asked Neville, tapping the beadwork on his gloves. “I’ve been thinking about trying to do something like that but I can’t imagine how.”
—into something practical and beautiful. Things like decorative trimmings, furniture, ceilings, staircase banisters…”
Harry whistled. “That’s impressive.” His head was starting to hurt, what with the noise levels rising; people were pouring into the stadium. All the same, Lee’s suggestion dropped into his head unbidden, and for the moment, unwelcome. “Do you think he’d like to play on a real team?” He asked Ms Baxter.
There were things he could say, but Harry wasn’t entirely sure he wanted to share them. Things he’d learned in private conversation, through observation, from reading the novels that Draco had lent him.
“What is it with the house thing?” Gilliam asked, exasperated. “Blaise tried to explain it to me, but honestly—”
“Yeah, there’s a box with some things.” Harry hesitated for just a second—he did treasure her friendship and her professional qualifications, even if he didn’t want any trace of her in the flat anymore. “I also wanted to talk about the assistant coach thing. I’ve thought about looking for someone else, but I’d much rather have you—”
earned it already,” Harry argued, and thrust the book at Draco. “I got this for you. When I thought I needed to grovel and all to get you back I thought I’d do it like in the romance novels you like and make a grand statement and everything, and give you a gift because—because that’s what the love interest does, right, which makes
“Hey hey hey, if you can’t be nice then nobody gets the blue paper,” Harry said, going over to break up the fight before Alice accidentally set something on fire. (It’d only happened once before, but once was one time too many and it’d frightened them all.) “What’s the problem?”
