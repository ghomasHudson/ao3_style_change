Harry went up to the two winners, fighting his way through the crowd of well-wishers and slung his arms around the two of them. "Well, I never knew you two could coordinate yourself in such a beautiful display of teamwork huh, Malfoy and Weasley?" He grinned.
Harry then mentally used the lubricating spell on his own hard-on and withdrew his fingers, while lining his cock up at the hole. Draco moaned when he realized that Harry was finally going to enter him, and relaxed himself, lifting his knees to his chest as much as possible, so as to make it easier for Harry to enter him. Harry slowly pushed the head of his cock into Draco's ass, and then found himself sinking into Draco's warmth, as his cock was being gripped by Draco's muscle. When he was fully in Draco, he paused, staring down into Draco's eyes, with love twinkling down at Draco from his eyes. Draco never felt more complete and content as in that moment, and he pulled Harry down to kiss him again. Harry then started to move within Draco, stroking Draco's desire as both of them moaned from the pleasure of the action. Tanned and pale skin became slick with the perspiration from their actions as both of them became more and more frenzied for the peak of the pleasure.
Draco lifted one of his eyebrows but the envy was still in his eyes. "Harry, let me ask you something. Did every Gryffindor get a prep talk when they were sorted into the house? Did the students of your house have the obligation to take note of where you are at all times? When you walk from class to class, did your friends have to surround you so that you are protected from attack? Why did they surround you when having meals? Did they let you choose the bed you want in the new dorm room or did they do what they just exhibited in front of us just now by stationing themselves near the door? Did they do it subconsciously or was the 'protection' deliberately set up by Dumbledore?" It was then that Draco saw the look of astonishment on Harry's face when he finally understood what was Draco was talking about and had been in front of him for the past six years. Looking around at all the others in the room, Draco saw similar astonished looks on the others' faces. He mockingly sighed at himself and realized that it really was subconscious on the part of Harry's friends to protect him. He turned to walk towards the boys' room to take care of his luggage, saying softly, "Now you know why I have to be taken out of Slytherin."
"Why did you not mention it to me for so long? Oh God. And last year I…" Dean sighed as he remembered the previous year's events. He must have hurt Seamus so much.
Ron's eyes were wide. "Day, why ever would you do that? Are you mad?" Ron exclaimed as the Gryffindors were all staring at Day with horror.
"Somehow I think today's game will be quite brutal, even if it is on our side. Even though the Slytherin team found totally unsuitable beaters after those two left. For Merlin's sake, that little squid they found couldn't even beat the bludgers during the first few practices that I watched. The seeker can't even catch golf balls well. I felt sorry for the team." Draco scowled with disgust when he remembered the recent practices that he spied on hiding under Harry's invisibility cloak. It was a complete waste of his time to watch a team suffering from the loss of their two beaters and trying to recover from the loss of their seeker as well.
"You could have been a slytherin you know, with that neat little trick." Draco commented, taking a sip of the pumpkin juice.
So he smiled up at Dean and said softly, "I love you Dean."
He suddenly realized that the sorting was almost over. Looking at the other end of the long table, he realized that there seemed to be less new Gryffindors this year. However there were even less new Slytherins this year, with there being only four of them, in compared to about twelve Ravenclaws and fourteen Hufflepuffs. There are at least eight Gryffindors. Then Professor Dumbledore stood up from his seat to make his speech.
"Detention. Working in the greenhouses till nine o'clock. She told me that she should be back before curfew, as I told her that I wanted to talk to her." Draco said, looking into the emerald eyes of Harry.
"Don't be silly. We thought that… you may not want us near as… we are guys and… Merlin, I'm so sorry. It's our entire fault that they went after you…" Harry leant his forehead against her forehead and let the tears fall.
"Well… um… that was…" Harry tried to make the silence in the room more comfortable.
By then the group had reached the two of them and Harry sat down on the other side of Draco. The whole group was treated to the sight of Draco Malfoy opening and closing his mouth like a goldfish and a pair of doe-like eyes staring unblinking up at him. The whole group, in fact the whole table, heard the question and were all waiting with anticipation for his answer. After another five seconds of silence from Draco, Day decided to shift to Plan B. She started to blink a few times and the sides of her mouth turned downwards. She whimpered softly like an injured puppy and looked at Draco with eyes that looked like that of a kicked puppy. She then looked down at her lap and said softly in a hurt tone, "You don't want to tell me huh?" and sighed. She then shifted to face the table and looked at her plate, like she was going to cry. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw a panicked look appear on Draco's face.
His uncle went to the door and frowned at the empty owl cage as he opened the door. "Where's that damned thing that is supposed to be in the cage?"
"Don't think I didn't notice you checking him out in the Great Hall. For your information, I saw him check you out too. And I do think that it's time YOU settle down. And don't give me that crap about not wanting to endanger anyone. And if Draco Malfoy is anymore endangered, he'll be dead. But the main thing is… what do you feel about him?" Ron asked, crossing his legs and placing his hands in front of him. He had been in this position of a 'psychiatrist' for Harry before, waiting patiently while Harry sort out his thoughts and bounce ideas off him.
"Let's put it this way. Their fathers tagged behind my father when they were at school. Their fathers were just as horrible as them. My father told their fathers on the way to Hogwarts in their first year to keep thinking in their head how they love to be in Slytherin. It obviously worked. Their sons told me that their father told them to do the exact same thing. They did it, so… there they are. Seems that the sorting hat decided that they were so pathetic, it is pitiful to send them elsewhere. Told that two fools that as well, and they actually used it to boast to me, thinking that it was praise."
Harry looked at Draco's hopeful eyes and sighed. He didn't want to tell Draco about that till… he didn't know when.
"Can't sleep much without Dean, thanks to your big mouth." Seamus growled, with his toothbrush in his mouth, glaring into the mirror at Draco, as he saw Draco grin insolently.
The whole group settled down to have their lunch. Hermione was reading a book as usual as she chewed away at her food. Draco was sitting right opposite her and was quite irritated by the fact that the book was right in front of him.
"You two had really spent too much time together. You don't even need to talk. And I swear you know what each other are thinking all the time." Ron said softly, adjusting his position so that Hermione was more comfortable.
"Well, he IS hot." Dean commented.
She stared at her own reflection in the mirror again. Seeing her short black hair, and her face, she knew from experience that she was not pretty among Chinese, and not many people go for her type. She never had a boyfriend, as she once heard boys commented that they prefer pretty girls who were not as smart as them. Somehow the fact that she seemed to ace all her classes scared guys away. Not that she really wanted guys who were so shallow, but it would be good for her morale if someone would just send a small card to her during Valentine's Day. She sighed again.
"It's a he." Dean said, finally bringing his eyes to look at Seamus.
Both stared at each other till Draco motioned for Harry to sit on his bed. When Harry settled himself on Draco's bed, Draco pulled the curtains of the bed closed and cast a silencing spell.
"Herm, why didn't you put up your hand just now?" Ron hesitantly asked.
George then went on, whipping out a notebook and a quill, looking very serious, "Yes, and pray tell us the brand of the fertilizers your stupid and disgusting muggle relatives bought so that we can sell it in our shop as 'the fertilizer which made Harry Potter grow tall'! Bet that can bring in lots of galleons!"
"If you didn't throw that remembrall back in the first year, then I wouldn't be playing seeker now." Harry smiled at Draco. "Got the book?"
"Now, this I got to hear. Last night. You left us to go to your room with Draco. I assumed something happened?" Sirius commented, laughing when Harry blushed.
Harry looked at him in surprise. "Where did she go?"
Forty-five minutes later, Ron was perspiring, while Draco looked calm and collected. By the fifteen-minute mark, when the whole common room had not heard Ron say 'Checkmate', they had realized that there was a very interesting chess game going on. By the half-hour mark, Harry came to sit down beside Draco and Hermione sat down beside Ron. Sirius was looking at the two players with big eyes. Ron was actually frowning. The atmosphere of the whole common room seemed to be so tense, as everyone wanted to know the victor of the game. Ron was staring intently at the chess board, while Draco was staring at Ron's face. The clock on the wall chimed ten, as Sirius got up, to go for his rounds around the castle. Harry silently got up and let Sirius out, whispering "six-thirty tomorrow" to remind Sirius for the run. Everyone continued waiting for another five minutes, until, Draco cleared his throat, making many in the common room jump. Ron looked at Draco.
There was an empty seat beside Dean. Harry motioned Dean to pass the empty plate in that seat to him. He then piled some more chicken wings, some potatoes and pastries onto the plate and lowered it for Sirius to eat. Sirius wagged his tail furiously, barked once in gratitude and started gobbling the food on the plate.
Draco marveled to himself.
Draco leant in and whispered. "He's my godfather."
Everyone turned to stare at Draco, who looked stunned with the news. "What? Me? But… my father never said anything. How could it be me?" He started to panicked.
Draco whispered, "Don't tell people yet, we don't want to confirm anything to the general public." Day quickly nodded, as she straightened her body.
"Down, Snuffles. Ron, after all, Snuffles did belong to me for three weeks before school started. Who did you think was my bodyguard when I was at Hogwarts?" Draco grinned back at Ron, throwing two more chicken wings behind him to Sirius. Sirius settled down to finish the chicken.
"But I didn't do anything. I was just staring at you." Harry frowned.
Looking up at the Gryffindor players in the skies, he caught sight of Day, going through the strategies. Draco had come to realize that he was quite protective of this 'little sister', after getting to know her better when he was spending time with her in the common room as well as other times when she joined the group for meals. True to her word, she didn't tell anyone about the relationship between Harry and he, and the school only knew about the relationship a month ago, when the two of them strolled into dinner hand-in-hand. Harry even gave Draco a chaste kiss in front of the whole school so as to make sure that everyone knew. He however realized that in the recent one week, she didn't seem as cheerful as before. She had also been quieter in the mornings and when doing her homework in the common room, Draco had caught her staring into space. He didn't want to invade her personal space, so he left it alone.
"Day, for Merlin's sake, just tell us. Something is bothering you. What's wrong?" Harry sighed.
Finally his uncle looked up from the newspaper and moved to get up. He glared at Harry, saying "Well, I'm glad that this is the last time that I'm bringing you to that dreaded station and the last day that I'll be seeing you. You aren't coming back next summer, are you?" Harry shook his head, as he got up from his chair. Dudley grinned maliciously and Harry knew that they all couldn't wait for him to leave.
When Harry reached the infirmary with Day in his arms, he found the nurse Madam Promfrey worriedly waiting at the door for them. She hurried him to place Day on a bed and asked Harry to leave the room, so that she could do a documentation of the injuries. From the descriptions that Ron gave, seeing that Day was found naked and injured, it was likely that there was rape and assault involved, so it was now a criminal case. She brought an automatic-writing quill out on a parchment, as she started to give descriptions of the injuries Day had, while she healed her cuts on the body. The quill wrote down every single word she dictated. She then collected bodily fluid as evidence of the rape, as well as for analysis.
"Um… Due to the fact that we didn't have access to the ingredients, when we tried it back then, we didn't use the potion. We just took things as we transformed. It's harder, but the only resources we had then were ourselves. But, even if we took the potion, together, the animagus forms that the potion allows us to see would NOT have interacted with each other." Sirius said.
"So how did you guys find me?" Day asked.
"Well, umm… sorry for calling you out here like this. Just wondering, what happens if I keep… um… dreaming about… someone? What does that mean?" Dean finally asked.
"So was that the hint you were looking for? How are you going to thank me?" Harry mischievously nudged Dean who was beside him. Dean just couldn't stop grinning as he felt so relieved. It was quite obvious that Seamus did feel an attraction towards him. So all he had to do now was to make sure that he had to approach Seamus carefully.
"Albus, it's true that everyone can do some wandless magic. But shielding spells! They are so advanced and even normal Aurors had trouble casting it with their wands sometimes. I myself have never heard of a shield in the bubble form." McGonagall asked.
"What's so secretive?" Seamus asked, grinning to hide the fact that being in enclosed space with Dean alone was affecting him.
"You were attacked by Parkinson, Crabbe and Goyle."
"What… happened?"
"Seam, Dean was just trying to help you with YOUR argument, why are you trying to bite his head off? Unless… you want Dean to check YOU out? Is there something you should tell Dean?" Harry cheekily asked, trying to help Dean test the waters. Seamus refused to meet Harry's eyes and to the amazement of everyone present in the room, he blushed.
He walked out of the bathroom and saw that Dean was up, as he dropped a kiss on Seamus' forehead when he passed him to go to the bathroom. Seamus shot him a quick grin to tell him wordlessly that he was forgiven for kicking him out of bed the night before. As he changed into his Quidditch robes, his eyes went to his drawer. He opened it and placed the ring pouch into his pocket as well, without wondering why. He just felt that there would be a perfect moment coming up on that day.
Draco shot Harry a glance, lifting his right eyebrow. "You think I don't know? She is so predictable." He went on eating as if it did not bother him in the least.
"So tell me, you prefer girls or guys?" Day asked Draco boldly.
"You mean Dumbledore get warning before Voldemort actually reach the Great Hall? Wow, that's useful." Harry gushed.
"Can we do that?" Draco suddenly asked.
"Yah, we do that. But we had been together longer." Hermione argued.
Ron laughed, "Scold her, my foot. Snog her to death is more like it. But at least Nev is a really nice guy, unlike that disgusting Malfoy type…"
Harry soon finished his run and rushed up with Sirius to take a quick shower. Going into the bathroom, he realized that Dean and Seamus were sharing a shower cubicle, due to the groans and moans he heard. He quickly cast a silencing spell on that cubicle, showered, and before he left the bathroom, he discreetly removed the silencing spell. He breathed in relief when he removed it that the groans and moans had stopped.
The whole group made their way out, all of them stopping to run their thumbs on the movement chart. The panel then closed behind them, with the movement chart showing 'breakfast and class' under everyone's columns.
"Bonded? How?" Draco finally asked.
"I am." Harry continued grinning, not moving his finger at all, as it was just lightly touching Draco's skin, so near to where Draco wanted desperately to be touched by his love.
"I'll run ahead to the infirmary." Ron shouted, as he left.
Finally one of the boys in the group against Ron said "No one is winning. Six of us against him. By right, he won." The six boys slumped in defeat, as Ron relaxed in his seat, grinning.
The rest of the DADA lesson was more discussion on the Dark Arts, and they even evaluated the different reasons that might push Gryffindors, Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs towards using Dark Arts. No homework was given when Professor Lupin dismissed the class.
Draco breathed in shallowly and licked his lips. His mouth had suddenly gone dry as he felt Harry's warm presence lean in close to him, nearly embracing him. He shot a glance at Harry and realized that he merely wanted to copy his notes. He then tried to pull his attention back to the professor who despite having gone on for an hour, seemed to still have relentless energy in the way he talked. Draco hurriedly scribbled the new point that was being brought up by the professor so as to not let Harry know how his presence had affected him. When Harry finished, he leant back into his own seat, catching Draco's grey eyes staring at him. He gave Draco a quick grin and turned to face the professor. Draco, upon seeing his grin, realized that Harry merely leant close to him to copy notes and had no ulterior motives, breathed in deeply before turning his eyes back to Flitwick.
"Hermione Granger"
They started the game with the Ravenclaws making the first move. The students of the whole hall were silently staring at the big screen as the pieces on the both chess boards got less and less. Instead of paying attention on the screen or the players, Harry used the chance to look around the hall, observing the spectators. When he sneaked a peek at the wager-book just now, he noticed that the Slytherins had the tendency to bet on Ravenclaws, due to the house rivalry against Gryffindors and Draco Malfoy. Hufflepuffs decided to bet on the Ravenclaws too. The Gryffindors and the Ravenclaws of course each supported their own house. Only one Slytherin betted on Gryffindor to win, and that was Blaise Zabini. The only reasoning was that Blaise must have known about Draco's expertise in chess through experience. And Draco did mention before that Blaise had no inclination to serve the dark lord. Looking around, he also realized that at each house tables, there were a few students who had a piece of parchment in front of them and every time each player made a chess move, they immediately scribbled something.
All a sudden, two figures blocked the sunlight that had been shinning on Draco. "Hey, aren't you supposed to be helping Ron do the torturing sequence?" Dean said, sitting down a step below Draco, looking up at the players, especially at Seamus.
Remus looked at Harry. "Just dropped by to say hi. And you are feeding my ungrateful dog. Any problems with your rooms?"
Nobody saw a discreet nod from a male Slytherin seventh year to a female Gryffindor Qudditch chaser and the answering nod back with a small smile.
"Draco?" Harry asked questioning.
"Then who IS the Heir of Slytherin?" Hermione asked.
Seamus: Advanced DADA, Advanced Charms, Intermediate Transfiguration, Intermediate History of Magic, Intermediate Herbology
Draco smiled back at Ron. "You didn't grow up playing chess with opponents in which their aim was to make you show emotions. I learnt since young to play chess not showing ANY emotion. Slytherin chess games had very high stakes as well. I had to be the best to survive. And I was the best at Slytherin."
Harry looked over at that bed. "Morning, Draco."
"Ten minutes for me to get up, wash up and dressed to face Snape for double Potions. Our schedule had always been sadistic over the years. Or have you forgotten?" Harry grinned at Draco. Draco was already dressed in his school robe, his hair neatly combed and his bag ready to go. He picked up his bag and looked at his mirror one last time.
Harry stood behind Draco, looked at Draco in the mirror as he slowly bent to drop a kiss at the back of his neck. "Hmm… is it working? Anyway, see you later." He said, slipping out of the restroom. Draco shook his head as he chuckled, making his way to the shower cubicles, to take a cold shower.
Harry answered defensively.
"Teach you what?" Draco asked, turning to Harry.
Harry was now used to being with Draco for almost every hour of the day. On days in which they were separated for Draco's Advanced Potions lesson and Harry's Advanced Charms lesson, very often they would meet each other outside the Great Hall and their hands would search out for each other's to grasp together. If it wasn't for the fact that they were soul mates, they themselves would find the behavior unhealthy. After telling the whole school about their relationship, they were hardly seen without each other around the school. Both of them could feel their magic bonding, as Professor Dumbledore had suggested that it may be easier for them to draw magic from the magical pool between them instead of themselves the week after they were told that they were soul mates. In adapting to that change, they found themselves improving in almost all areas of their magic, and were able to learn their animagus transformation faster as well.
"Why isn't it one-on-one?" Draco asked Day, as he continued to scratch Sirius who was turning himself around, directing Draco where he wanted to be scratched.
"It means that should Hogwarts really fall into Voldemort's hands, the eight of us will most likely be the only people who will survive the attack?" Harry asked in an emotionless voice that Draco had never heard before.
"But… isn't Malfoy blacklisted, so Pansy won't even go near him? Unless Pansy wants to be blacklisted too." Hermione frowned, thinking about the issue.
No one else said anything. Everyone just settled down to wait for Madam Promfrey to finish doing her magic on Day, or for the professors to bring back news on the three Slytherins who were behind the atrocious crime that occurred that night.
This comment took a while to sink into the two boys' minds.
Seamus' jaw dropped, as his mind scrambled to process this new piece of information. Then he remembered that on the Hogwarts Express, Dean left with Harry for a 'walk'.
"Harry… Harry… come back to me… why… Harry… it's Dray… come back to me… and tell me why you are sobbing… Harry…" Draco mumbled into Harry's neck, as Harry snuggled into his body, seemingly wanting to hide from the whole world out there. Draco didn't know what to do but to hold on to Harry and hope for the best. Harry seemed to come back to himself, realizing that he was sobbing into Draco's robes and tried to stifle his sobbing. "It's okay to cry. Cry all you want. Just tell me why later." So Harry went on sobbing to his heart's content. All Draco did was to hold on to Harry, caressing the back of Harry's neck with one hand.
"You don't have to be gay to rape a guy."
Draco grinned, as Harry looked very cute and vulnerable when he was fumbling with words. He pulled Harry back into his embrace. "Relax. Harry, I still think it's too fast. Not that I don't want you. I think when we are both ready for the next step, we'll know. Right now, let's just get to know each other, okay?" Harry nodded, melting himself into Draco's body.
"Dray, what's wrong?" Harry, feeling worry through the mind link, looked up at Draco.
Remus and Sirius looked at each other and sighed. They had been expecting this question. They knew that this question had been bothering Harry since a few years ago, but Dumbledore kept avoiding the issue. However, over the summer, he had finally given his consent to tell Harry why he was so important to the cause. They were just waiting for Harry to ask the question again.
Harry sighed and leant back into Draco's arms and relaxed. "I wish we were back in our dorms."
"No… not nightmares. Definitely not nightmares like yours. Um… those TYPE of dreams." Harry finally found out that Dean could blush as red as Ron, because of the color that Dean's cheeks were presently.
"Six Thirty." Harry replied.
He smiled to himself, just as Professor Flitwick dismissed the class and reminded them to hand in their summer assignments.
She landed in front of the locker rooms and made her way to the sink. Splashing water onto her face, she looked up to the mirror, as she caught sight of her own reflections, tilting her head, thinking. She had found that in the past week, with all the couples forming around her, she had been having difficulty being cheerful in front of others. Some mornings she just wanted to lie in bed and not get up. It could be due to the furious Quidditch training, tiring her out. When doing her homework in the common room, she often found herself losing the concentration, and many a times just gave up doing, favoring going in search of Snuffles and hugging the big black dog. Something told her that the dog was special, because when she talked to him, it was as if he understood everything she said, and the dog never got sick of her, always sitting silently next to her even when she was not talking. Her own friends sometimes found her to be annoying and would shoo her away, thinking that she would never be hurt by that shooing. She sighed when she remembered that no matter how annoying she had been, both Harry and Draco had never shooed her away. She was thankful for that small gesture on their part, but even she knew that you don't take up too much time of people who were currently in a relationship.
All a sudden they were back and they both opened their eyes, staring into each other's eyes. Harry realized that he was lying on Draco and was still in Draco. He withdrew and mentally summoned a warm washcloth as he lovingly cleaned Draco, making sure that his beloved soul mate was not hurt during the love-making. When he was finally assured of Draco's well-being, he finally laid down on the pillow and pulled Draco close to him. Pulling the blanket over their bodies to prevent them from getting a chill, Harry gave Draco a small and chaste kiss on the lips and both boys drifted again into blissful sleep.
Harry reached the other two and did some short cooling-down exercises. Then he took his wand back and the three silently made their way back to his dorm room. Harry took his toiletries to take a shower. As he stepped under the hot water with his eyes closed, he couldn't help seeing the image of Draco's mercury eyes staring at him. He reached out his hand and turned the water to cold water as he finished showering using cold water.
He thought to himself, as he tried to keep his emotions in control but failing.
"So are you going to spend my lesson out here glaring at each other? Or do you all actually want to learn something that is beyond all your intelligence?" Both groups heard a sarcastic voice from the doorway of the classroom. Professor Snape was standing there glowering at the two groups of students. He then turned and strode back to the blackboard, with Pansy leading her band of Slytherins into the classroom in a hurry. Without Draco on her side, she did not want to anger Professor Snape unnecessarily. The whole group of Gryffindors also settled into their seats as they knew that Professor Snape had never favored them and they did not want to invite unwanted detentions.
Ron frowned. "Harry, what do you mean?"
Her eyes closed as blackness greeted her.
"So… do you just want to… you know… I don't mind… it's just that… I'm making a mess out of this." Harry sighed.
But all in all that was impossible. Malfoy was acting similarly, laughing in front of him in Potions when he made a snide remark about the professor to Ron, or belting out histerically when Harry had gotten dirt rained on him in Herbology by an out of control plant, or just smirking at him from across whatever room they found themselves in together.
Draco could barely understand Harry and how basically easy it had been to attain such a friendship.
Harry chortled himself, shaking his head just like in the photo.
"Why don't you admit to yourself that Malfoy might not be a bad guy?" Harry gave a swift glance to Malfoy then focused back on Hermione.
H: I use my brain for important things. Not betting on who is going to win the Quidditch World Cup, or which broom is mathematically more efficient. I swear I heard you two using high level mathematic equations to determine the angle and velocity needed to preform some complicated twist and dive.
Malfoy flew closer to him, which he was pleading against, and held out his hand.
Harry didn't know what to make of the sudden tinge of hurt in his chest. Sure Malfoy probably had a lot of good reasons to be mad at him, like getting his farther thrown into Azkaban, or even for speaking in favour for Malloy's mom and him.
Harry smirked as Hermione gave Pansy a sweet smile.
The door closed behind them, as they made it into the hall once more.
His focus was broken once more, but this time by a yelling Pansy and Hermione standing on the couch, calling for everyone's attention. As the room was shushed Pansy began speaking.
"Are you sure mate? Was Draco's performance better than you thought it would be?"
One last fleeting imaginary glimpse at Harry's laughing, mirth filled gaze, sent him careening into his orgasm.
Harry reached the corner of the corridor of the dorm, forcefully bumping into someone as he took rounded it.
Draco chuckled, he didnt need to lie to himself, of course he'd miss the occasional traded insult between them, even if each slur had a deeper meaning, it wouldn't have been the same without a pair of green eyes and messy hair walking the halls of Hogwarts, walking into class, smiling at Draco.
They crashed together, but their lips were unmoving, simply pressed together. Draco wouldn't move, not until Harry made that choice.
Harry sighed, letting his eyes linger on Pansy's for a second, before flicking to Malfoy's. Finally the other was looking up, and they locked gazes, even while Harry asked Malfoy the question, "Truth or Dare, Draco?" He watched as a flicker of somekind washed over Malfoy's expression. The use of the others first name was proving to rattle a nerve within Malfoy and Harry himself.
Harry, still straddling Malloy's lap, slumped against him, his arms thrown over the blond's shoulders. Malfoy clung to Harry, his arms wrapped around Harry's chest and his face nuzzled into Harry's neck.
"Ya know I can't help but love McGonagall," Harry pulled Draco against him with their clasped hands. "Because she wouldn't make us serve more than a month."
"I dare you to wank in front of the person you want to fuck the most."
Harry was gay.
Like making him smile.
Harry slipped passed many people he didn't even care to acknowledge, to get the other side of the room.
"As funny as it would be to walk into class virtually unscathed and rather happy to see Slughorns troubled face, Id like to be alone with you for a while longer and preferably someplace more private. Unless we risk getting another week of detention?" Draco answered, circling his hips against Harry's.
Harry stayed to thinking about his two friends.
a choice in?" Ron spat mashed potatoes all over the place while he ranted.
A lot of the guys couldnt tear their eyes away, actually including Dean and Seamus, even though he was sure they were strictly gay.
Draco could feel the curve of Harry's smile when their lips touched.
How did Malfoy get past him? He couldn’t have been too far behind. Or he might have been caught too.
Harry wasnt the one to indulge in his wishes.
Harry had made it very clear when he asked Draco to accompany him, that Granger and Weasley were not going to tag along.
Harrys focus swerved back to his cup in his hand calmly.
"What?"
"Now I can make them suffer with kissing you in front of them."
After a couple minutes of observing from some kind of astral plane, he consciously got up, but his body remained asleep on the ground with a small smile resting on his lips.
He seemed completely unfazed, his hand in front of him in his lap like he was inspecting his nails. His legs were sprawled out and he held himself up by the hand behind him.
After Harry refocused, forgetting Ron was there Harry noted the slight bitterness that etched its way into Ron's voice, but knew it was lighthearted.
Draco eased back into his own space and waited for Harry to answer.
Harry nodded at Draco after reading it. With a small smirk gracing Harry's lips, he passed it back after a quick squiggle.
So naturally, his escape was to flying.
The giggling stopped and Slughorn stared confused at his students.
Again he was greeted with a smirk and Harry's eyebrow raised questioningly.
"I'm just going to run around the Quidditch pitch. Nothing is going to happen to me." Harry took his wand from the pocket of his discarded robe and wondered where to tuck it so that it would not disrupt his running. When he was running during the summer, he did not have to bring his wand around as he was prohibited from using magic in the summer.
"Draco, one thing that you have to learn when you are eating at the Gryffindor table is that, we don't pass the food bowls. The best course of the table will always appear in front of Ron because the house elves know that he is the biggest eater in our whole group. What we want, we just pass the fork or spoon to others to ask them to take for us if we are too far away. We share all the food like a family. The only rule is that we don't talk with our mouth full. Herm says it's disgusting. Oh. And goodies will be shared within the house in the common room as well. Ok?" Dean just lightly patted Draco on his left shoulder. Draco then noticed that Hermione had given her spoon to Harry and without a sound from the girl Harry scooped some mashed potato onto the spoon and dumped everything back onto Hermione's plate. It was obvious to him that after sitting together for all meals for six years had taught Harry the ways of Hermione's mind that she no longer had to instruct him. The whole group surrounding him was also doing the same thing and it seemed that he was the only outsider. Draco then started cutting and eating his chicken chop.
Day looked up. "Nope. There's nothing to do. I finished my homework for the next two weeks, so I thought maybe I'll just flip through this. I was thinking of specializing in Arithmancy next year so I'll just see if it's okay or not." She went back to the book. All this while Hermione did not look up from the huge book in her lap, lost in the wonders of Arithmancy.
As the time neared for the team to go down to the pitch to assemble, the Quidditch players got up from their seat at the house table. Harry had purposely brought two of his Gryffindor scarves, his daily and Quidditch scarves. He stood up and in full view of everyone in the hall, took his daily scarf and placed it around Draco's neck, publicly announcing his claim on the blond. Draco gave him a grin and pulled him down for a fast peck on his lips and a whispered 'good luck, although you don't need it' into his ear.
Day laid beside her ripped off clothes with her blood all over her naked body. Her left hand was twisted in the way that indicated that it was likely to be broken. Where her body was not covered with blood they could see bruises forming. Harry pulled off his robe and flung it on top of Day, as he gently picked Day up, trying to ignore the large amount of blood on the floor under his shoes.
"You mean me." Draco smirked. Everyone in the class chuckled. "Anyone want to hear sob stories? Here goes nothing. Very little Muggle-borns were sorted into Slytherin. It could be because they were thankful of their newly gained magic that they aren't that ambitious. Most of us there are pure blood witches and wizards. From the time that we were able to understand our surroundings till we were ten, it was drilled into our heads that we were superior and we were taught the basic hexes, for self protection. I guess it can be a brainwashing procedure. Then we come here, where everyone accuses us to be arrogant, sneaky and evil, we will have the tendency to be just that, for the sake of reputation. Our family cares about that. Above everything. The pureblood families are just like the aristocratic families back in the Victorian times. We do things for show." Draco explained.
"Madam Promfrey, what time will Day wake up? I want to be here when she does." Harry asked.
"Yup, Herm, anyone is better than that idiot who took us last year. He kept assigning us essays because he is afraid of talking in front of people and I think at the end of the year I knew more about DADA than he did." Ron laughed, as it was a recognized fact that he hated writing essays and doing research, totally opposite to his girlfriend.
"I told Sirius about us." Harry softly said, bringing his hand up to touch Draco's cheek. Draco leant his face into the palm's caress.
Harry saw that he was back in control, so he let go of his wrist and leant back in his couch. "You really need to teach me that."
All the seventh years of each house sat all the way at the end of the hall, thus Malfoy would have to walk almost the whole stretch of the long table to get to where Harry was standing, waiting. As Malfoy was walking towards him, Harry took the chance to take a really good look at him. Malfoy's hands were both in the side pockets of his school robe, as he arrogantly strolled towards Harry. Even after what happened, he did not cower under the stare of everyone and walked as if he owned the world and it was his right to make Harry wait for him to reach there. His face was devoid of any expression but his grey eyes burned defiantly as he neared Harry, staring straight at Harry's emerald orbs. It was at that sudden moment that Harry realized that Draco Malfoy was really stunning in the looks compartment. Being the Slytherin seeker made him fit like an athlete and his silvery blond hair is so neat that Harry was tempted to run his fingers through the silky strands just to mess them up. His features were such that it was obvious he had aristocratic blood and all his beautiful features along with that body were enough to drive anyone crazy. However, what made Harry suck in a quick breath were Malfoy's eyes. That defiant look was making his blood flow faster and it was obvious that Malfoy himself knew how good he looked.
Everyone sat back thinking about what Draco said. Then Hermione put up her hand, frowning.
"I accept your apology." Blaise's eyes went wide as he suddenly understood the implication behind the statement.
Both the Slytherins and Gryffindors arrived at the same time outside the classroom. Ron was leading the Gryffindors and Pansy was leading Slytherins. Both stopped at the door and glared at each other.
"Are my ears kidding me? Did I just hear Ron Weasley suggest that?"
Harry nodded. "I'll just have to find a hole to dump you in I guess." He teasingly answered.
"Too bad we can't fool around." Harry sighed. Ron had asked Draco how the Slytherin team kept their energy up so as to be so aggressively 'assaulting' their rival teams. Draco had stupidly replied that the rule was a two-day sex abstain enforced before each match so that the players will work their frustrations off during the match itself. Ron, with wide eyes, nodded and called a team meeting, and had a team glaring at him with that announcement. Draco smiled when he remembered how frustrated Seamus was the night before when Dean pushed him out of his bed and made him sleep in his own bed.
Dean: Advanced DADA, Advanced Charms, Intermediate Transfiguration, Intermediate History of Magic, Intermediate Herbology
"Oh. THOSE dreams. Well, I can quite safely say that at our age, it should be normal. And if you keep dreaming about a particular someone, then maybe, you know, you like that person." Harry was starting to see where this was coming from, as well as understanding why Dean was behaving that way just now. And he had just the idea who the other person in the dream was. He was trying hard not to smile and waiting for Dean to confirm his suspicions.
"I should think that after everything, Snuffles deserved to eat." Ron commented. "What's up?"
All of a sudden, Draco could feel all sorts of feelings sweep across him. Anger, frustration, fear, love and comfort. When the last two emotions swept across his whole body, he tightened his embrace around Harry because he realized that the emotions were coming from Harry. He wondered why he could suddenly feel Harry's emotions. He then realized that Harry seemed to be calming down, as his sobbing became sniffling.
Harry turned back to Dean. "You can wait. Or just be a Gryffindor and you know, step in… but seriously, with this kind of situation out there, you do know that this is likely going to be the only year of peace left. And who knows what will happen tomorrow. If you give me a choice, I would want someone I like beside me too." Harry said, looking a little depressed. Now Dean felt really bad about bringing this problem to Harry.
Draco grinned, still looking at the stars. "Yes, but it's cute."
"Hey Harry, Draco, back from your extra lessons?" Ron greeted them as the portrait of the Fat Lady flew open. Both the exhausted boys collapsed on the couch next to the red-headed boy and sighed. "That bad huh?"
"I'll join you." Ron seconded.
"Harry! Didn't get to talk to you last night. You should have heard the speech that Prof. gave to the whole house. And great show last night. All the lower years were awed by the performance that you and Malfoy gave in the Great Hall. Hey Malfoy!" she cheerfully exclaimed, while pulling Harry out of the common room by his hand.
"Did anyone notice that they didn't choose a head girl or boy this year? No one seemed to know anything." Seamus asked.
When the majority of them had finished the dessert, Harry noticed Professor Lupin heading towards their group with Snuffles in front of him. Snuffles stopped to allow some fourth and Fifth year girls to pet and scratch him, with Remus waiting for him patiently. Finally they reached Harry.
"I carried you to the infirmary. Madam Promfrey said that if it was ten minutes more we would have lost you due to blood loss. Draco found the dagger they used and recognized it belonging to Parkinson. Then Professor Dumbledore took those three and made them confess using truth potion. They are too young for Azkaban, but they are going to be stripped of their magic and sent to muggle prison. You won't ever see them again. They are going to be announcing it during dinner later, not mentioning the victim's name." Harry continued.
Seamus felt like he was in heaven. He had been in love with Dean for almost two years. It was like a dream come true for him. He could feel his eyes go wet again, as he blinked to get rid of the tears.
Professor Dumbledore then held up his hands and the whole hall silenced. "I know that you all are hungry but there is a certain matter that needs to be settled before everybody eats. As many of you have come to know, a very strange thing happened during the summer. The whole Malfoy clan have been slaughtered by Voldemort and the only living heir of the family is Draco Malfoy, a current seventh year Slytherin. The reason for the horrible slaughter was due to the fact that Mr Draco Malfoy refused to be recruited by Voldemort. Due to his action, he had been blacklisted by all the Death eaters. Since we have another student here, Mr. Harry Potter from Gryffindor, who is under the same case here, we decided that it is easier to protect both students in the same place. Mr Malfoy is taken out of Slytherin and will spend the last year under no house. However, he will be residing in the Seventh year Gryffindor Dorm together with Mr Potter, and I sincerely hope that all Gryffindor students will allow him the same kind of respect and protection you have offered to Mr Potter all these years." Draco Malfoy stepped out from a side door and sneered at Snuffles in front of him. The dog seemed to narrow his eyes and got up from his spot to sit at Remus' feet, holding his head high as if he could not stand the sight of Malfoy.
"Good, Professor Lupin came back. Finally. Some teacher who does know what he is teaching. The only year that I actually had a good full year of education in that class was the year he taught." Hermione beamed at Ron, who nodded in delight.
Draco finally realized that Harry was staring at him. He then stared back at Harry, returning his stare.
Hermione smiled. "Normal people only take them at the end of fifth year. But remember that last year was the first year in which they implemented Mock O.W.L.s for the fourth years. Fourth Years who would like to try the fifth year exams together with the fifth years in order to gauge their own standards are allowed to take the exams. Day took it for fun. They were so surprised that Day could do so well that they asked Day whether she wanted to leave the results of the Mock as that of the real thing."
"The reason why the bond had taken so long to surface was probably due to the fact that you two started off on the wrong foot back when you were first years. You were always quarrelling. That kind of outbursts from the two of you must have been very passionate, seeing that you two are supposed to be soul mates. You two had been practically inseparable for the past three days, allowing the bond to strengthen a little bit. As time goes by, you will realize that some other powers might surface." Sirius explained.
They looked at each other and laughed. "Well, Remus and I are together. Harry, you don't mind, do you?" Sirius looked worriedly at Harry.
"Morning." Day whispered. "I woke up. It's six. You two continue to sleep. I'll make sure no one disturb you." Day knew that the two boys normally spent Sunday mornings together in bed. She gave Harry a grin and scuttled off to her room.
"Was I that obvious? I thought I hid it well. Flirt with everyone, every ten people I flirt with, I flirt once with Dean. That once was all I asked for. Sometimes I wonder why I torture myself. There are quite a few guys who don't mind having me in their bed, not that I'm boasting. But every night I go and lie in my empty bed just to hear the snores coming from the next bed. Just to be near to him. Because that seems to be all I can get. A roommate. Oh God, I'm being sappy. Again." Seamus sighed, lying back, looking up into the sky which was going to darken soon. "I think Harry knows. I never told him, but he always caught me staring at Dean. Last year was horrible. Remember Dean had a girlfriend? The two of them were always snogging in front of me. I wanted to slap that bitch. Then she cheated on him. Dean really liked her. He came to me crying. That night I had to put a silencing spell on my curtains and I cried the whole night. Why must I fall for Dean?" Seamus closed his eyes, trying to control his emotions. He was afraid that he was going to start crying. He didn't understand why he was telling all these to Draco Malfoy all a sudden. Maybe it was because that Draco, being houseless and having no family, wouldn't really tell the other Slytherins and make them tease him. Maybe it was because he was starting to trust Draco. He turned to face Draco who was staring at him. "Don't tell Harry huh?"
With these words, her tears fell as she twisted her aching body till she was lying on her side facing them and curled her body up. Harry's eyes filled with tears as he looked at her. Even Draco's eyes seemed a little wet. Both were silently blaming themselves for causing her pain.
Harry bristled at first that his precious owl had been referred to as a 'thing' and calmed himself to endure the last half hour that he had to endure with this horrible being in front of him and answered plainly "At school" and his uncle asked not a single word more as Harry loaded his trunk and cage into the car and they set off for the station.
"What do you mean?"
"At the end of last year, we made a deal with the house elves down in the kitchens. Gryffindors always have weekend parties, and we got so tired of sneaking down to the kitchens to carry the food up. So that bell will summon their head elf and we'll order the things we need from up in the common room. They will help clean up too. In exchange, we give them our old clothing or socks. That way they would be protected against the cold in the winter. It's so much more convenient for us." Harry explained.
"Did you know that Pansy asked Goyle and Crabbe to beat you up tonight? I was going to find you to warn you. Thank Merlin that you are joining our dorm tonight." Harry commented lightly, in a soft tone so that people from outside this group would not overhear the conversation.
Draco nodded. "I have to admit, I do find myself attracted to Harry. But like him, I don't play around. The only person you could hear who was linked to me was Pansy. But that's because she was always latched to me. Not by my choice. But Harry and I… it's too fast. He's grown a lot in the last summer. He looks really good now. Yesterday morning we were still enemies. Yesterday night he accepted me as a friend because of Dumbledore. I think we should go slower. Until I realize that I really like him a lot and that it IS going to last, I think we should try our hand at friendship first." Draco sighed. "After all, I don't want to start something with him now and regret it when I realized that it was because I'm feeling lonely now. And I personally think that we can become very good friends if we want. We are quite similar you know." Draco looked out at the pitch, and spotted Harry slowing down to make his way back to them.
Dumbledore nodded, looking like he had aged ten years in the past ten minutes and turned back to Sirius. "Sirius, get Severus and Minerva to meet me at the entrance of the Slytherin dorm. Ask Severus to bring some Veritaserum." The dog ran out of the infirmary as Dumbledore left behind it.
Everyone was staring at the doorway again.
He pulled open his curtains. "Morning." He greeted everyone.
"Morning." Draco huskily smiled down at Harry. Harry stuck out his tongue and lazily traced patterns on his neck, making him breathe in deeply at the sensation. Harry then single-handedly unbuttoned the shirt of Draco's black silk pajamas, teasingly brushing his hand on Draco's skin at times, as he continued to lick Draco's neck. Finally when the shirt was open, he pulled back and looked at Draco, while still leaning his lower body on Draco. No matter how often he saw Draco's shirt off, he was always struck by the fact that Draco looked beautiful. Especially early in the morning when Draco's hair was messy and he was smiling sleepily up at him. Draco often felt that his body had been damaged, due to the fact that the beatings he had gotten from his father left scars on his back. Harry could remember the first time he saw those scars, after finally persuading Draco to take off his shirt, and how he had nearly wept from seeing them. They were ugly, as line scars showed that his father not only beat him, he whipped him. However, in Harry's mind, those scars were beautiful, because he had survived them. After he saw them that first time, he had kissed the scars and used his tongue to lick them, cherishing them as a part of Draco. Draco had broken down in tears from Harry's actions. Now, as he looked at Draco, he was amazed that both of them had survived till they were so old.
"Everything's happening so fast. We were enemies. We became friends. I… I think I like you." Harry blurted out.
"Seam? What's going to happen tomorrow?" Dean asked, tilting his head so that it rested on Seamus' head.
"Morning, Harry. For a moment I thought that you were never going to wake up. Looks like I'm never going to sleep in for the rest of the year. You should have seen how Herm looked this morning when she stormed into our room, went to my bed and pulled me up by my ear. She and my mum can compete." Ron sighed, stuffing his books into his bag.
Dean thought about it and shook his head. "Flirting with people is part of what I adore so much about you. And it IS part of you. Just like you never stop talking. I don't really mind the flirting, so long as at the end of the flirting, you come back to me." Dean answered, tightening the embrace.
"Had a good run?" Draco leant his back against his own table, which happened to be beside Harry's table.
"Ask Harry. I said the same words to him two years ago. I got to go. Need to check out a book at the library before my lesson with the lovely werewolf. I hope I don't drool in class." Day winked at Harry as she got up to leave.
"Professor Lupin brought Snuffles! I didn't even see him just now." Harry exclaimed to Ron who was grinning at him.
Harry grinned; his whole body was filled with elation for finding such a wonderful person.
Draco looked at Ron, who was still frowning at the chess board. His chess pieces shrank back from him. "Hey Ron, it really was a good game. I wasn't kidding."
What were troubling them more were the nightmares that Day was having. Ginny came into the boys' room in the middle of Thursday night in a hurry, waking both Draco and Harry, telling them that Day was in the middle of a nightmare and the two girls could not wake her up. The two boys rushed into the girls' room, and saw Day writhing on the bed in agony, trying to curl herself up to protect her body from pain. Both boys held her down and tried to calm her as they tried to make her open her eyes. When she finally opened her eyes, her eyes were glazed from the pain of her nightmare and she blinked when she realized that she was on a bed, not back in that room where she was being tortured. Her tears fell as she nuzzled into Draco's neck. Draco sighed as he scoped Day up in his arms and made his way back to his bed. Day spent the rest of that night in Draco's bed. The next night was no different, but this time it was Harry who brought her back to his bed. Draco wondered what would happen tonight.
Remus thought to himself.
Draco breathed in deeply as he seemingly absorbed Harry's presence. After learning about his true heritage, all he wanted was a little bit of comfort. And Harry seemed to be a suitable choice because both seemed to be in the same predicament. And the added fact that Draco was deeply attracted to Harry. He then realized that the attraction did not start the day before. The attraction started way back before the first year when he met Harry in the robe shop. He wanted to attract the attention of Harry, but Harry seemed unmoved then. The only one whom Harry seemed so attached to back then was Hagrid, which was the reason why Draco treated Hagrid so horribly in all the years he was attending the classes Hagrid taught. All these past six years was Draco searching for attention from Harry. And he was now lying on Harry's chest.
"Harry, that's nonsense. Don't make me beat you up. We are here because you are our friend and we are willing to do anything for you. That's why we are in Gryffindor. Friends and family matter a lot to us. After six years in the same dorm room, YOU matter to us. So don't let me hear this nonsense coming out from your mouth again." Seamus cut Harry off in a very serious and annoyed tone. Everyone in the room was very surprised as they had never seen Seamus so serious before. Harry looked at Seamus, knowing at that precise moment that Seamus had just pledged his loyalty to do anything to protect him. Looking around the room, he saw similar looks on everyone's faces. Until he came to Draco's face, whose emotionless face showed nothing, but his eyes blazed with a tint of… envy?
"Can I play?" Draco asked. Sirius got up from his lap and looked at Draco, while the other six boys all turned to stare at Draco as well. All Ron did was to indicate Draco to sit, as he used his wand to resurrect the broken pieces. They started the chess game two minutes later.
"How is it your fault?" Neville asked. Ginny had finally stopped crying.
Draco breathed in deeply, trying to control himself when he heard the words that Day said. His eyes had went wide, at the thought that the girl thought that… she thought that they didn't want to be near her! All Harry did was kneel down next to her face, took her fingers in his palm and give her a soft kiss on her forehead.
"Albus came here one month ago telling us that our heirs are actually soul mates so we were kind of waiting for you two to show up. You really took your time progressing in your relationship huh?" Salazar smirked, as the two boys blushed.
"They are being locked up in different rooms at the moment and had been given potions to sleep till tomorrow morning. We would arrange for a Ministry worker to be here in the morning. However, because they are under-aged, it is unlikely that they will end up in Azkaban. The recently implemented punishment was that they serve in the muggle prison after they had their magical powers stripped from them. They don't know about that yet. They were told by Voldemort that we could not do anything to them because they are too young. We'll have to make other sleeping arrangements for her. Remus, can you go up to their dorm and add one more bed? I think it's better for her to be protected now, better late than never." Dumbledore sighed.
"Useful little spell." Harry muttered admirably.
Hermione grinned at them. "Since he didn't call me for the past six years, I don't see why I should waste my energy putting my hands up and waving it in front of him. Draco gave me the idea. Did you see Snape's expression just now? I could barely keep from laughing." Draco grinned back at Hermione.
Looking fondly at the good-looking blond beside him, he noticed a light reddish bruise on his neck, which was not completely covered by the collar of the shirt under the robe. He blushed, remembering how Draco got that bruise. The two of them was kissing each other in the washroom before dinner. Slipping his mouth from Draco's mouth, he had trailed his mouth down Draco's pale neck to his collarbone. Concentrating on nibbling the patch of skin had made Draco moan with pleasure as Draco clenched his fingers in Harry's hair, arching his neck for Harry's mouth. In the times when they were fooling around, Harry found out that Draco was very sensitive around the neck area, and they would often emerge from their free periods with patches of pale bruises on Draco's neck. Shaking his head now, he glanced back at the parchment before him and hurriedly scanned his Potions textbook to quickly complete the assignment.
"Of course." Draco murmured as he brought his lips to touch Harry's lips.
"My bed today huh?" Harry asked, amused as he also sat down on his bed. The next moment, Draco pushed him down onto his back, rearranging him and then placed the book on Harry's chest and balanced himself on his elbows beside him. He then flipped the book open and started reading, ignoring the astonished look that Harry had on his face with the prospect of finding himself being the table. Harry sighed and settled down, letting Draco read on him, while he enjoyed the view of staring at Draco's face.
Dumbledore smiled. "Miss Granger, calm yourself. It's not that hard to understand, given who they were. And all wizards can perform some wandless magic. It's not impossible."
Draco knew that both their emotions were disrupting the shared magical pool and if they actually let the magic lose, they might actually blow up the place. He was trying to send comfort waves to Harry, but because his emotions were also very much on the surface, it seemed to be unable to do anything for Harry. He could sense Harry attempting to control his emotions and the magic, and reached his hand out to tug Harry into his arms, as Harry looked at him for help. Looking at the rest of the people standing staring at them, Harry decided that the main thing was to protect them from any magical outburst. He looked back at Draco's eyes and realized that Draco was thinking the same thing. It was as if they knew what each other was thinking. He then used his mind to conjure a protective bubble around Draco and himself. It was like a protective shield spell, but the difference was that Harry did not use his wand to conjure it. He didn't even know the words for the spell. He simply imagined it being there, surrounding Draco and himself, even if they moved about, and both boys slowly sat down on the floor, still holding on to each other's hands. Harry then rested his head on Draco's shoulders and both breathed in deeply, closing their eyes and trying to control their tempers and their magic.
"Why don't you all go back to your dorm to sleep? It's quite late already." McGonagall commented.
Ginny helped to introduce the two of them since they were from her Arithmancy classes. "This is Jon Breeks and Joseph Malloy." Jon was black-haired and Joseph had sandy-blond hair. Both looked very studious, with their spectacles and seemed to be afraid that Ron or Draco would scold them for being so daring.
Dean smiled. "Love you too." He replied as he also closed his eyes.
"That's because he's there all the time! Hi, brothers." Day dropped herself into the seat, looking exhausted even though it was lunch.
"Stalemate?" Draco drawled. "Draw?" Draco struck out his hand.
"I have triple potions with him later." Draco affectionately grinned at Day. All three Gryffindors turned to him with astonishment.
Day stared at Blaise's eyes, trying to determine if he was sincere in his apology. It was true that Blaise did not really do his prefect duty by reporting it, but as a Slytherin, and what Draco had told her about being a Slytherin, she could hardly blame him for his actions. Especially if you knew that those two have connections with the dark lord, then all the more you have to take care in what you report. Finally seeing the sincerity in his eyes and that Draco actually mentioned before that Blaise was actually quite a nice chap, she decided to tell him.
Draco sighed to himself.
"But that's what you two did all the time." Draco answered, not even looking at them, even though he saw what Ron did from the corner of his eye.
Draco never knew that Day Lee was so smart. After all, she was two years below his that he didn't even pay much attention to her. And she just 'adopted' him? "You Gryffindors really trust a person very easily huh?"
"You do know that they will be misunderstanding what we are doing in here." Harry smiled.
On the whole, the lesson went very well. Each pair was given a small hamster, which each partner took turns to change it into a mouse, a rabbit, a turtle and back to a hamster. The cycle went on as the requirement was that you need to change the color of the animal at each transfiguration. It amounted to quite a bit of laughter as Neville was seen chasing after a blue rabbit which hopped off after the change. Finally when the animals were changed back into the original hamsters and placed back into their cage, the class was dismissed.
"The lure of power. The use of dark spells keep giving the power to the caster. It gets addictive." Neville said. Professor Lupin nodded.
Draco stared back at Blaise. "What makes you think it's a girl?"
"Wow, you did this?" Draco had the habit of enchanting the canopy of his bed at the beginning of every school year to show the outside at different times of the day. In the morning, it would show an outside scene of sunrise. In the evening, it would show the sunset. At the current moment, as Harry looked up with an entranced expression, the canopy was showing the night sky with all the stars and the moon. It was like lying outdoors.
"I want to apologize to that person. I saw those two come back into the dorm room with blood on their robes. I asked them about it but all they did was laughed and got ready for bed. I couldn't sleep, and lay awake wondering what they did. About forty-five minutes later, Dumbledore and Snape came into the room and stunned the two of them. When I heard what they did the next day, I realized that if I reported them earlier then the person would be found earlier." Blaise replied.
"You nice? They must be mad for all I know. Come on. We still have History of Magic. Don't want to be late." Harry playfully answered and hurried Draco out of the Dungeons.
"Um… we … haven't… you know…" Harry answered, blushing even redder as he looked down at the floor.
Harry nodded. "Who do you know in Slytherin is definitely not wanting to serve Voldie?"
Looking at Ron, he could tell that his best friend also came to the same conclusion as him, when Ron turned from staring at the door of their room to him and gave a small smile. Harry returned the smile. At that moment, Harry felt very content, as he looked around at all his good friends beaming at him.
Sirius sighed. He recalled that night when Draco was going to hyperventilate at the news that he was the heir of Slytherin, and all Harry did was touch and talk to him, and Draco calmed down immediately.
Harry was woken up by a buzzing sound. He sleepily reached his hand towards his pillow to grasp his wand, muttering 'silencio' as the buzzing stopped. He sat up in bed and rubbed his eyes, pushing his bed curtains aside and snatching his glasses up from the bedside drawers. Putting on his glasses, he looked around the room noticing from the snores around him that all his roommates were still asleep. Till a buzzing from Draco's bed and a whispered 'silencio' indicated that Draco had also chosen to get up at that ungodly hour. Harry hurried to wash up as he only had fifteen minutes before meeting Sirius for his run, he gathered his clothing and went towards the bathroom, seeing out of the corner of his eyes that Dean's bed was empty.
"No fair. No wonder you like his lessons so much. Is the Advanced Potions that bad? Heard that you are the only one taking that. I may be considering that specialization next year too." Day nonchalantly reached out her hand to snatch a chicken drumstick from the food bowls that just appeared. By then the rest of the seventh year Gryffindors had drifted in and Ron sat down opposite Day, hearing her last comment.
"We don't know. Not many soul mates were recorded in history. The theory was that powers given to soul mates were not fixed. We don't want to tell you much as it is better that your bodies developed your own set of powers. But one thing is for sure. The powers that will surface will greatly depend on the magical powers you both hold.  As soul mates, you are actually functioning as a whole unit. That means that when you do magic, you use magic from a pool of magical powers shared between the two of you. And seeing that you are both heirs, you have a greater pool than the normal pairs of soul mates." Dumbledore explained.
Harry looked at Draco, who shook his head slightly. "Seam, nothing, we are just discussing about Voldemort and staring at this." He pointed up at the canopy. Seamus looked up and gasped.
"Why do you want to know?" A voice came from the side. Both of them turned to face Day who was hovering near the two on her broomstick. "I ask again, why do you want to know?" Day asked, staring at Blaise, as she landed on the stands and got off her broomstick, sitting down beside Draco. Draco passed her a towel and a water tumbler. He then stared at her, noticing from the corner of his eye that Blaise was staring at her too. She just drank from the tumbler in cool composure as she waited for his answer. She finally turned back to stare at Blaise.
"Harry, you don't know how difficult it is for them. They see each other EVERY day in school last year. Then Herm went HOME for summer and Ron missed HER like mad. Then after SO long they finally get to see each other, BUT Mum watched them like a hawk! The rule in the house is that they are only allowed to hold hands! And Fred and George keep telling on them to tease Ron that they don't have any privacy in the two weeks she was there. Just let them snog for Merlin's sake!" Ginny explained the situation with an impish smile. Ron blushed even redder. Then Ginny turned to Harry. "If you are jealous, we can snog too, you know!" Ginny's grin got even bigger.
"Yup. If not for her restlessness she'll be likely to be teacher's pet for every class. And the number of O.W.L.S. she got was amazing. Without studying, she came a close second with the record set by my dear Hermione. And the pranks she played. Even Peeves leaves her alone." Ron added. Peeves was a resident poltergeist of Hogwarts and was famous for destroying classrooms and loitering the hallways playing pranks on professors and students.
Draco nodded. "Two of them. Defense spells. Want to go back to the dorm to read?" Draco looked back at Harry hopefully.
"What? That bitch!" Ron muttered the later part of the comment to himself. Harry smiled softly to himself as Draco turned to look at Ron in astonishment after hearing that. Ron's personality was such that his temper was very fiery, but once you gained his trust, he would defend you with his life. This was the reason why Harry felt that he was so lucky to get a friend he could depend on for protection. Draco then gave Harry a glance and saw that he seemed to expect that reaction from Ron as Harry went on eating without pause.
"As usual. You are THE Harry Patter. But maybe it's time you get someone. Everyone seemed to be pairing up. And… Malfoy didn't seem that bad now."
"I see attraction." Seamus commented, before turning to look at Harry.
"Yeah, it helps me relax. At night when I can't sleep, I'll just stare up at it and look at the stars. It's quite peaceful." Draco whispered.
"What ARE we doing in here?"
"Will this be in our N.E.W.T.s?" Hermione asked. Everyone was trying to control their laughter, but a few sniggers escaped from some of the students.
Draco stared up at the Quidditch players practicing the Quidditch moves that Ron and he had planned. This was a common scene where Draco would be watching while the others practiced. Ron said that it was to prevent the other Quidditch teams from knowing that Draco had a hand in planning some of the more devious plays, as Gryffindors were supposed to not be devious, according to their reputation. Draco smirked upon recalling the occasion when Ron said this, as Draco had turned disbelieving eyes on Ron for having such a Slytherin suggestion. It seemed that everyone had a little bit of Slytherin in them after all.
"Me three." Seamus exclaimed.
"If Seam knows, everyone knows. And Ron will blow if he knew that you are helping Malfoy. He really doesn't like that guy."
Within ten minutes, Harry was dressed and ready to go. They exited through the panel, greeted Marcus by introducing themselves to Marcus so that he knew exactly who reside in the room. They then went down the stairs to the Gryffindor common room, which had some Gryffindors sitting around waiting for their friends to go for breakfast. Then they saw a short-haired Chinese girl rushing up from the girls' dorm and heading towards them.
Dean breathed in deeply, wondering how to tell Seamus that he is in love with him. He decided to try the same method he used with Harry on the Hogwarts Express. "Seam, during the summer, I kept having dreams. Dreams about a certain someone." Dean said, refusing to look at Seamus.
Along the way, Harry snatched the map back from Hermione and being more used to running, he ran ahead, with Ron at his heels. Reaching the almost unlit passageway, he glanced at the map before turning around frantically trying to find Day. "Day! Where are you? The damned map said she's here." By then Draco, Hermione, Neville, Ginny, Seamus and Dean had reached there too, followed by Sirius, who saw them running along the passageway and joined the group, wondering what had happened. Sirius changed back to human form and snatched the map from Harry's hands. Looking at the passageway, then at the map, he motioned Harry to step aside as he moved to stand next to the wall. He stretched his right hand in front of him and pushed his hand firmly against the wall. To the surprise of everyone, his hand went through the wall. The next moment, Harry rushed at the wall, with Draco behind him, but both froze at the sight of Day lying on the floor.
