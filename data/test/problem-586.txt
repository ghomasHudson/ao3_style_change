"I had a feeling that I should be looking for replacement teachers. Just in case." McGonagall tipped her head in a sarcastic nod. "May I introduce you?"
Shadow glanced over to the Gryffindor table. Now he knew why Ron and Hermione looked less enthusiastic than the rest of the table. He was about to say something else when something caught his eye. There, on the ground, a carpet or something was slowly creeping further into the room. His eyes got large as he realized what he was seeing.
. Uncle bangs on the door to shut the Boy up." Seraphim's breathing quickened and his eyes began to glow as he looked over his crossed arms, propped on his knees. "But I shut him up. He'll never hurt Boy again. Never! I killed him! Killed him dead!"
Lucius scrambled to his feet, eager to examine the spells that recorded the events at his home. He would destroy Potter if it was the last thing he ever did. He was just stepping into his Lord's private study when the tall form of the Dark Lord staggered and then collapsed. Lucius raced forward, casting diagnostic spells as he moved, but he could find nothing wrong with his Lord.
Shadow looked to his father who stood silently at the foot of the bed. "Guess I can control the change back. I think I would have stayed Harry Potter for as long as I wanted, but I don't think I can go back on my own now that I look like Shadow again. I'll need the potion."
Shadow shook his head, helpless to explain. He felt boneless and relaxed and like something inside of him had given way just a little bit. For a few moments all his problems and all the world's problems had disappeared and it was all about physical needs and satisfaction. It felt good. It felt dirty, too, but for the moment he didn't even care
"They murdered her and it wasn't pretty. She was head of MLE. Susan Bones, a Fifth-year Hufflepuff, her niece and adopted daughter, is pretty upset about it," Neville answered. "She came back to the DA after the funeral pretty bloody-minded and determined to fight. Ginny says her attitude is beginning to infect the rest of the group. It's definitely not a game anymore."
"Maybe I could do that to make my eyes match.” Shadow took the papers and scanned them thoughtfully.
The piano was gone, back around his friend's neck. Shadow was sitting on the side of the bed in his pajamas, just staring out at the water scene beyond the window. Draco crouched in front of him and handed him the wet cloth.
"About that…" Hermione said tentatively. "What do you recommend we should do? Should we just leave him alone and act like nothing's changed?"
"It's just… If that connection is still there, it's kind of useful. It helped a lot last year. Severus will try to find a way to shut it down permanently."
Draco ran low to the ground over into the opposite tunnel so that he could guard that entrance into this section of the caves. Neville stayed with Shadow. He was trembling and felt sick. Moody's wound made his mind flash back to the Dursleys and the scent of dark spell residue and the battle screams were nerve wracking. He forced himself to stay calm, focusing on protecting Shadow's back.
"Perhaps he did try. We are well hidden.” Lucius grinned. "The wand should tell us. We should find a Killing Curse somewhere in it's recent history. If not, then…" He shrugged, but his meaning was clear. Severus and Shadow would be killed.
"So the Ministry is using the non-magical families of wizards and witches as bait?" Shadow demanded, eyes dark with fury. "You think that's going to work? What kind of statement is that, anyway? It's like the Ministry agrees with Voldemort that Purebloods matter more."
, Monday’s headline had read), Draco and Sirius had been released from interrogation and were now working with the Order, and Severus and he were still stalking the shadier areas of the Wizarding World keeping their eyes and ears open for anything useful.
"The trouble is Moody's eye, right?" Shadow asked. "It would sense any magical monitoring device. I bet not even your Extendable Ears pass when he's in the room."
"If I recall, that wasn't entirely my fault," Shadow said stiffly, sitting rigidly and clenching his fists under the table. "You were suspicious of me at first because of my last name and my eyes."
He darted forward and used one of his father's spells. The Death Eater fell back, screaming as blood erupted from his face, a deep cut had opened up one cheek from forehead to jaw. Shadow pulled Fred's still weakly twitching body deeper behind their defenses; George reached forward with his good arm and helped.
"I turned to Albus in April of 1980, eight months after I joined the Death Eaters," Severus began. "Then I immediately began spying for the Headmaster. It was… difficult."
"And you think a memory of you being pandered to and having elves grovel at your feet bringing you sweets when you caught the Dragon pox will help him?" Neville yelled, eyes finally flashing.
"Do you think we are so stupid not to know who guards our backs, goblin?" Draco asked coldly. "Their appearances were at my order." The sudden shift to first person singular only made the statement that much sharper. "Had you asked, we would have explained. Now our guards are compromised. You've endangered the Black heir."
Hermione moaned, her hands covering her mouth and tears already springing to her eyes. Ron looked confused but like he knew something bad was about to be said.
"Are you ready to be introduced to the Order? I'll issue a call for a full meeting for tomorrow afternoon."
"I look at you and…" Severus lowered his face, throwing it completely in shadow. "I think you are beautiful. I am incredibly proud to have you as my son… I never thought that I would have this chance again."
Shadow arched, his mouth breaking away as he cried out, hoarse and breathless. Draco buried his face into his exposed throat, tasting the salty sweat beaded there as his own orgasm rocked him to his knees. They sank down together, both shaking and desperately trying to breathe. As the high dissipated, Shadow closed his empathy and tried to bring the world back into focus. His whole body throbbed and he just wanted to melt away.
The two Malfoys disappeared. Shadow waited until even his lynx hearing couldn't catch their footsteps before he transformed back into this human form. Helpless rage and fear churned through his chest and head. He couldn't abandon Draco. Especially since they would blame him for the escape, but if he stayed, what could he possibly do? He had no idea about the layout or how many Death Eaters were here. If he went after Draco, he'd most likely be caught and thrown back into that small dark room to die slowly of thirst. That terrified him. He didn't want to die pointlessly. He couldn't face that room so soon.
Halfway through breakfast, Severus strode down the aisle, his robes billowing as he passed out schedules. Being Thursday, they would only have two days of classes before the weekend. That was going to be nice. Draco accepted his schedule and Shadow took his own, eagerly opening it.
"I gathered you did from what you wrote last night.” Shadow frowned. "I have a lot to tell you, too. Is anything wrong?"
"Of course." Remus smiled and pulled the book closer to him, feeling content to have his cub with him and safe. Despite the full moon being so close, his wolf was calm and quiet now that he had one of his pack with him.
Shadow noticed the black strap around her neck, but at the end was a pale pink conch shell. "All right," he  said, giving in after a moment. His head was feeling better after sitting in the dim kitchen eating cold ice cream. He could stand to walk around for a bit. Besides he kind of felt bad that he hadn't had a chance to talk to Luna since the Hogwarts Express.
"People are dead, Nev. I killed them! I can't fucking control myself," Shadow yelled, crying openly now. "I'm a monster!"
Severus scowled at that and immediately stood. Draco hid a smile behind his hand as the man strode from the room to go after his son.
"I don't know." He fell back on the bed, covering his eyes with his arm. "I don't know anything anymore. I feel like my life is suddenly out of my control, but now that I look back I think it was out of control the second my name came out of that godforsaken cup."
Draco took a face full of puke-yellow spell-light and fell. Shadow watched, almost like his friend went down in slow motion. He couldn't move. His shields were already sputtering and about to crumble. Severus yelled something dark and sinister and for a second Shadow felt the pressure on his shields ease as the Death Eaters did all the could to block the Potion Master's attack.
Sirius smiled roguishly up at him. "Sorry, godson, but I can't make you the Black Heir like I planned."
The mood was far less playfully disdainful at the other tables. There were some heated arguments starting up and down the hall about the veracity of the Minister's statements. Shadow smiled when he noticed familiar faces from DA remaining relatively calm. His message that they needed to know defense whether they were fighting the Dark Lord or just Death Eaters seemed to have sunk in. Hopefully, it would spread.
"That wasn't so bad," Hermione said supportively, but Ron didn't look any happier about his form. "It's rare to be a wasp Animagus. It says you have very clear ethics; a person with honor. And that you're fearless when it comes to a fight."
"On the contrary." Neville crossed his arms, staring darkly at his fellow year mates. "They did keep his secret. It was Ginny who couldn't."
Burning heat throbbed through Shadow’s body; he laid back, sweating and languid. Warm hands slid up his thighs, warm and leaving goosebumps. They caressed his twitching stomach, slid over his chest, and kneaded his shoulders. Shadow arched into the touch, warmth pooling in his groin, pleasure radiating from his core. A moan, slow and sensual, resonated from deep in his chest, the sound low and rough, a counterpart to his breathy pants. Long fingers tweaked his nipples and he cried out, grasping at the desk underneath him. The heat was spiraling higher, burning him.
The twins nodded. Fred leaned forward to explain their plans. Draco and Shadow listened with wide eyes and soon were laughing. Tomorrow was going to be explosive, that was certain.
Living in an ancient, decrepit castle was tedious, but she comforted herself with the thought of convincing the Minister that it needed to be torn down and rebuilt. The fire flared green just as she sat at her kitchen table for her nightly cup of chamomile tea.
"And I've thought of a great way to find it if she does have it," Shadow smiled darkly. "But before that… Nev, we need to get you caught up with the developments concerning Seraphim. And… I wanted to talk to you about what I said at your house the other day…"
Severus didn't say anything at first. They just watched each other. Then the older man sighed and crossed his legs, his hands linking over his knee. "I want you to realize that I spent almost a decade creating this house. I've sacrificed many things to ensure this place is safe from detection. No one can find me here or break in. Only I knew of its existence… Until you… I gladly share my home with you. I opened it to Longbottom, Lupin, and Black. That's three more people who can potentially betray this location, who make this place less safe."
Fog moved slowly over the ground and Draco shivered, surreptitiously casting a warming charm on his chest. They walked only a few blocks before they reached a commercial street. Most of the stores and restaurants were closed, but Draco caught sight of a gas station still lit up. He headed that way with Seraphim a few steps behind him, his green eyes bright and watchful. The convenience store was empty except for the young man standing behind the counter, reading a magazine. Draco hurried down the food aisle and grabbed a loaf of bread, chips, and other such things. He quickly had more than he could carry.
"Hmmm," Shadow hummed in response, his eyes slipping closed. Draco moved toward the door, but Shadow stopped him. "Sleep with me?"
Shadow didn't let go of the blond's arm as they hurried from the room. As soon as Draco saw everyone huddled in the center around a severely injured Ron, he realized that they all had fallen prey to the things in the Department of Mysteries. He felt a bit better about his own weakness, but it still made him feel humiliated.
"To what do I owe your company, Minister?" Minerva asked, her hands folded as she sat behind her desk.
Sirius, filthy and wounded, didn't even hesitate. He grabbed the nearest students and yelled into their dazed faces to move.
"It's not like him to be so determinedly busy, especially when his family needs him," Draco argued. "I'm starting to suspect something may be wrong."
"I never told anyone about Tabitha either," Severus pointed out. "They were mine. We were happy together. I didn't want anyone to intrude on that. I wanted them separate from all the world. I would have stayed with them always if it weren't for Dumbledore insisting I join the Hogwart's staff."
"Boys!" Severus finally cut in. He glared at them both. "Try to be more mature, please. Let's discuss this." He stared at them thoughtfully for a moment before realizing neither intended to speak. Sighing, Severus looked at Salazar. "What exactly would you be doing to Boy while within Shadow's mind?"
Severus knew the Wizarding world would go mad after seeing this. Potter was back; they were saved. He snorted, tucking his hands more securely into his water-proof, heat-retaining magical jacket. It was absurd for the world to expect a single teenager, no matter how blasted lucky he was, to save them from an army of Dark warriors led by an insane Dark Lord. And it was infuriating that the Brat-Who-Lived played up to this madness, attention-seeking worm that he was.
Harry's head lifted as cool air brushed across his grimy, sticky face. Eyes widening, he jerked forward, utterly desperate. He was so anxious to escape, he forgot about his father and crashed into his back. They fell together in a tangle of limbs. Harry cried out and fought viciously to be free. He shot forward, losing half his shirt as it was ripped from Severus's grip.
Seraphim screeched at seeing the creature and attacked it with his bare hands. Omi screamed and disappeared, leaving Seraphim to fall to the floor.
"All in favor of the D.A.?" Hermione called and there was a yell to the affirmative. "Okay. That's a majority - motion passed!"
"We should have told you," Severus cut off whatever Remus and Sirius were about to say. The two ex-Gryffindors looked over at him with exasperated expressions. "We have to be more careful. What happened at the Dursley's cannot be allowed to happen again."
Her first act as a member of the Wizengamot had been to lead the discussion of what was to be done to protect the Wizarding World, and to a lesser extent, the Muggles. After nearly eighteen hours, in which there had been few breaks and many Pepper-Up Potions, they had finally worked out security measures for flooing and Apparating, as well as stricter policies regarding dangerous magical items and potions ingredients. Of course, many people were going to be displeased with the activation of martial law, but they'll be more upset about the magical drain required of them.
Shadow frowned. He had been so caught up in his thoughts that he had forgotten what they were waiting for. He looked at the clock on the mantle. Fifteen minutes had gone by. "Maybe he's held up with the Order," he offered thoughtfully. "Disappearing suddenly could be suspicious."
"Whoa, stop!" Charlie raised his hands. “So the prophecy just rolled off on its own? You summoned it, George? Ginny, you saw someone throw a rock at it and tip it off?"
Harry felt the change come almost instantly. He shivered and squeezed his eyes shut as his skin shifted and his body changed - Severus's blood absorbed into him, became a part of him. It didn't hurt exactly, but it wasn't pleasant either. He focused desperately on outside stimuli, trying to distract himself from what was happening to his body. He could hear the fire crackling, could even hear the quick anxious breathing of Sirius. He could smell blood and sweat, but also a hint of the sage that was burning in the hearth.
Shaking his head, Charlie made his way toward Neville's room. Bill fell into step beside him. Charlie knew he couldn't put him off, so he led his older brother to his office and activated the strong privacy wards that surrounded the room.
Severus flung open the door and cursed loudly. New snow had fallen and Seraphim's tracks were long gone.
"So let them know that." Shadow shrugged. "I don't care as long as they don't find out that Harry Potter and Shadow Snape are one and the same. And they won't know that because no one will be there to see me and I'll go in as a lynx."
Lucius had witnessed allies being shredded and struck down as if they were mere insects. He had seen his newly reborn - and probably fragile Lord - crushed with pure malevolent magic. Lucius had
"What else did Salazar tell you?" Severus asked with mock sweetness, his hands bloodless around the blanket they gripped.
"Now that we know Voldemort is really a threat, the Wizarding world is in more danger," Shadow began. "Neville told me that the Gryffindors believe Hermione and Ron and are really scared. The Order isn't doing well either. Now that I know the prophecy, too, I realize how hard it must be for them not to know where Harry Potter is. They think they're literally doomed no matter what they do without him."
That was certain. He remembered Draco when they were shopping and the time it took for him to get ready for anything. Vain was definitely a quality Draco possessed, as well as pride. Shadow thought Draco needed to work on the humility and "resist displaying his tail". The imagery that thought evoked made him blush. He quickly read on.
Severus frowned, but he could understand Seraphim's point of view. Draco and he had stayed here several times and had been safe each time. He didn't understand that this was only because they hadn't stayed for a long period. He didn't understand how hard it would be to live in such an empty house. They couldn't keep stealing food. It would get them into trouble, not to mention the Wizarding world would find them eventually by following their trail. He had no idea how to make this damaged side of his son understand these complications, either.
"Really?" Shadow felt his legs almost give out on him he was so relieved. "He really said all that?"
Umbridge stared at them, then turned her eyes on Shadow once more. "Detention, Mr. Snape. Five thirty tomorrow night. If you have complaints, speak them for yourself. Don't have others speak for you."
"There are other things to open in any case," Severus drawled and sat back down. "There are several letters addressed to Harry, I believe."
"I'll be there, of course," Draco drawled, flicking his fingers. "This war's already at my doorstep."
Shadow watched, silent, arms crossed and glaring. Now that his anger was fading, he realized that most of his ire was due to fear. He didn't think he could survive another confrontation like what happened in the graveyard. The mere thought made him break out in a cold sweat. Roughly running his hands through his curls, he bit his lip. He had thought he was past this finally. That Voldemort was gone from his life forever and wouldn't be able to hurt him again. He left that all behind when he abandoned the name Harry Potter and became Shadow Snape.
The only thing he left out was the shocking kiss he had shared with his best friend. Remembering made his stomach flutter pleasantly and an unavoidable smile touch his lips even now. It was something he wanted to keep to himself for a little longer and cherish. He had never thought Shadow would make the first move, let alone in such a stunning manner. Closing his eyes, Draco could still feel the weight of Shadow's tongue in his mouth, the texture and taste of it…
Severus spun around, his cloak flaring up behind him. "Don't blame you, Draco?" he purred threateningly, stalking forward. "Who else am I to blame for the utterly imbecilic plan to rush headlong into the abandoned Ministry
Shadow, looking like Harry Potter, knelt in the center of a blackened circle of earth. Neville winced and had to force his eyes away from the dead ground. Devastated bodies of Death Eaters lay scattered about his brother. Voldemort's body was nowhere to be seen, but Neville suspected the ravaged pile of meat and bone to the right had once been the Dark Lord in question.
"Draco?" Shadow rasped. He was deeply confused and very cold. He huddled into Draco's tight embrace, absorbing the blond's warmth and using the few minutes to gather his wits.
"No." Neville quickly shook his head. He was surprised to find himself looking down a few inches to meet his brother's gaze and felt a strong surge of protectiveness. "I'm going with you."
"Basically that the Dark Lord cast a spell on Shadow and forced him to attack St Mungo's, but that Severus was able to remove it. The rest he wasn't informed about and didn't push since he was trying to prove his loyalty."
He made a dismissive gesture with his fingers and shook himself, as if getting back on point. "The night I proposed to her, she revealed a secret she had kept from me. She had a son. A son born February 24th, 1981."
Suddenly, Shadow's view of the rest of the pub was obscured as a figure in a dark purple robe stepped in front of him. His hand tightened around his wand as the figure pulled back their hood to reveal a woman in her forties with tight pink skin and pinched, thin lips. Her eyes were a faded hazel and they filled her face.
"Like the toy that made colors," Draco reminded coaxingly. When the alter merely stared at him, he sighed in exasperation. "It's better than doing nothing."
"If you back away, I'm reasonably sure that he will retreat to a safe place. The closest being the Chamber of Secrets," Draco answered her, relieved that he was being deferred to.
Shadow stood silent and pale, listening to the men and women plan the battle. They studied the landscape and were already making portkeys to the area and second portkeys to bring them back. Three witches and one wizard nodded and slipped out of the room to start preparing all the sitting rooms and parlors as temporary medical rooms to care for the injured.
Shadow opened his eyes and studied the thirteen Slytherins in front of him. He watched carefully, his own breath even and controlled. He waited for each one of them to reach that still place. Now all he had to do was turn on the light, so to speak.
"Okay, this way," Shadow said and led them forward. There were gasps of awe as a door materialized in front of them. Shadow turned the handle and gestured for everyone to go inside.
"I do not know for sure," Severus admitted regretfully, staring into the fire. "We were busy facing other issues until now, and there is no one left to ask."
"I'm sure he's fine," Draco answered casually. He brushed black bangs from his eyes and surreptitiously studied Sirius's face. The man looked very ill. "Maybe he needs to lie down for a moment. I'll help him to his room."
Shadow became more and more dumbfounded as they rode the lifts and he heard department names like: the Official Gobstone Club, Ludicrous Patents Office, Pest Advisory Bureau, and the Muggle-Worthy Excuse Committee. At least there were sane offices as well. Things like: the Portkey Office and Apperation Test Center, the Department of International Cooperation, the Department of Magical Law, and the International Confederation of Wizards. So the government wasn't completely loony, but it was a near thing from what Shadow could tell.
It was the most wonderful thing she had ever seen . Ginny stepped forward and stared at the phenomenon, entranced. She didn't know how long she stood there, but eventually she tore her eyes away, understanding dawning.
"He'd be a spy for the Broken One, at the mercy of the Soulless Lord. And your young mate? Where would he be had you not touched him?" the centaur pressed. "He'd feel like he had to try and do what his father wanted. It would have taken him longer to realize he didn't want to be an agent of Darkness. Maybe it would have even been too late."
Charlie nodded, understanding the seriousness of his brother's statement. They would be making a mistake thinking about the Chosen One as the Gryffindor Harry Potter. That was obviously not who they were dealing with. He was a Snape through and through. Severus must have officially adopted him and now Harry was gone for good. They had to accept Shadow as he was or they'd fail whenever they tried to deal with him.
"I'm afraid I have bad news. Death Eaters attacked Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade last night," she said gently.
.” Shadow took and aggressive step forward, standing toe to toe with his godfather. "You can't change what I've been through. You can't protect me from the past or protect me from consequences in the future. All you can do is be my friend, watch my back, and support me. I'm sorry the world isn't as it should be, but that's how it
Shadow gasped and finally retreated back into his own mind. He felt heavy and his mind oversaturated with things that didn't belong there. He had no idea how Severus, or anyone for that matter, could stand it. But he had what he needed to know, among a wealth of stuff he didn't, like the man's favorite color and his pet's name.
Severus stood quickly and grabbed his arm as the teen wobbled, lightheaded. "It's okay," he soothed. "Just sit down." He guided Shadow to the bed. For the first time since he began this conversation, Severus began to understand that it was going to be difficult for him as well. In order to show Shadow that it really was okay, he'd have to reveal more than he felt comfortable, but if Shadow could bear the things he had, Severus could do this.
Draco glanced at Severus and the man nodded. Moving quickly, he stepped up to Seraphim's side. The alter grabbed his arm in a painfully hard grip and gestured with the knife that Severus should back off. The Potion Master did so, his eyes never leaving the alter's. Seraphim led Draco back to the room and shoved the dresser in front of it once more.
"Damn right!" Sirius growled, getting to his feet. "I'm going to research glamours, so don't you agree to anything just yet," he told his godson before pushing past both Remus and Severus.
The teen sighed and slouched into the couch. "Yeah. I know." He closed his eyes for a minute and just enjoyed being in Severus's soothing presence.
Opening his empathy a crack, Shadow observed them. It was sweet and bright. It was a playful love, not yet the devotion that longtime lovers develop, but it was a step above infatuation. It didn't disgust him. He recognized that it granted Neville great happiness and that made him appreciate it, but he still didn't desperately want it for himself. It was nice for Neville. That was all.
Luna wandered off to look at some of the books that appeared on a large shelf in the corner while Neville and Ginny conversed quietly up front.
Draco shivered as Lockhart began to scream again. He was beginning to come out of shock. He had to get these people out of here, but what could he do? If he showed himself to be an enemy, Demon would attack him as well, and Draco didn't want to die so horribly. Not at Shadow's hands, even if Demon was behind his eyes. Alarms began to blare. Draco's heart began to race even faster. The Aurors would be coming in minutes.
Seraphim cooed in pleasure, proud of his clever little soon-mate. His wing brushed along the male's cheek and down his back. He could smell the happiness coming off the smaller male in waves and it made Seraphim chirp at him, sharing in his pleasure. Then he was moving forward. His fledgling was right inside, the female waiting for him. She was alone.
"I can't believe we're talking about this stuff now." Harry laughed and covered his face. "We're hiding from goblins, miles under the earth. We may not even escape and we're sitting here in the dark having a therapy session."
Shadow felt a bit better that he shared his feelings but still felt very uncomfortable. He shifted his gaze away toward Marissa who was oblivious and bouncing on a battered red couch happily.
He didn't get any visitors. The three boys in his year kept their doors firmly shut. Draco wasn't as lucky. Students from Fifth-year and up dropped by the blond's room, asking subtle questions about why he turned to the Light side and also wondering what the relationship was between Severus and Shadow. Were they father and son? Uncle and nephew? Was he adopted?
Hermione rose uncertainly. Shadow met her eyes neutrally, not giving her anything, just waiting. Still crying, she offered him a trembling smile. "We'll talk later…"
Shadow rolled the parchment and handed it over, not daring to look up at her face. He knew he was shaking, knew his eyes were practically iced over with hate. His hands felt dirty from touching those books. His lungs felt grimy just from breathing her air.
"I hope so," Remus answered. "The oak tree is Neville's Animagus form, but he's been known to get lost in the Earth magic. Let's hope that isn't what just happened."
Umbridge waited until Alecto left the room before continuing. "They constantly rebel against authority and their disrespect for authority is astonishing!"
Neville stepped up behind her and crouched down, putting a hand on her shoulder. "He'll be okay. Professor Snape is on his way and he'll know what to do."
Neville stared after her. He had no idea what she was talking about. Shaking his head, he returned his attention to his brother. "Seraphim, I'm going to sit over there, far away from you, but you have to promise not to leave. Professor Snape is coming. He'll help you."
Shadow winced. "Relationships seem to grant a type of happiness that is more fulfilling than others, but… It's not necessary to have that kind of happiness to have a good life is what I mean."
"No one has asked," Flitwick responded. He folded his hands before him thoughtfully. "I believe no one really considers doing so. You like to stay with your year mates, after all. Plus, you can study independently and still enjoy the classes. Mr. Snape had no such bonds of friendship to consider."
Another voice agreed. "We had no need for your continual service as a spy. It would have been better had you brought down the murderer or died for the Light, not again find an excuse to return to the Dark that once ensnared you.”
Neville pulled him into a tight hug. “We are going to do all we can to make up for it, Shadow. We are going to stop the Dark Lord. We are going to save people who would have died without us protecting them. It’s going to be okay.”
It was pitch black; the curtains on the underwater window were firmly closed, but he didn't need light to know where Shadow was. In fact, he didn't even need to see him to know what Shadow was feeling. Absently, Draco wondered if this was what having empathy was like. He had passed a Silencing Barrier and the sound of aimless piano notes surrounded him.
Neville nodded a bit. His round cheeks pale and his eyes a bit wide. His right hand had come up to scratch softly at his left forearm. Shadow saw this and quickly moved his attention to Draco, hoping it would make his brother more at ease.
They sat silently for several minutes. The only sound the click of the pieces. Shadow squirmed internally. His response seemed clever and solid, but as his words hung in the air they seemed childish and ignorant. He thought of the joy Severus felt with Amalia. The happiness that Neville felt around Ginny. Being empathetic, it was kind of ridiculous to claim that that kind of happiness equaled the lesser everyday brand of happiness.
He came within touching distance of Seraphim and stopped. He recognized the tense shoulders, arched wings, and deceptively still shadow-hair for the warnings that they were. Seraphim was still on edge and moving past him, out from behind his protection, would only drive Seraphim to protect them by removing the threat. It helped that the other two had left and Seraphim no longer felt outnumbered. For now, he was content to snarl warnings and keep his distance from the unknown witch.
"I think it will be fine.” Remus smiled gently at his charge. "He still needs to recover and any food we can get into him is a good thing."
Shadow followed him down to the kitchen where Tonks, Cory Fenwick, and Stephan Pritchard were sitting having a late lunch. They looked strained. Shadow almost greeted Cory with friendly enthusiasm, but he caught himself at the last minute.
Shadow ran his hands through his hair raggedly. He really didn't want to get into this. "Just drop it, okay. It was between me and Neville. It's over now." Determined to change the subject, he narrowed his own eyes. "We have other things to talk about."
"All those unwilling to participate in this mission may leave now," Charlie said firmly, his eyes cutting across the room.
"What happened after Demon went back In? And why did he do that? Why not stay Out on a rampage?" Harry questioned, tilting his head curiously.
Suddenly, he was disconnected from his body. He was completely unaware of it convulsing, of the sound of his bones grating and shifting shape underneath his skin. He couldn't feel anything; not even his slow rough breathing. It was as if he were floating or heavily drugged. Nothing mattered. He was safe and at peace. He was home. He was held by Severus's calm voice telling him to be calm, that it was almost over. He let himself drift for time on end.
"This can't happen again, Draco!" Shadow pulled away and turned his back. "I can't stand here, afraid of what he'll do next. I can't stand here feeling like I have no control over him coming Out."
"Good. Are you hungry?" Shadow called for Omi and they all asked for something to snack on. He glanced at the silent Draco curiously, but he merely looked back at him passively. Turning his attention back to Neville he asked, "Tell me about Umbridge's registration. How is everyone reacting?"
"He suffers the aftermath of an unfamiliar curse. His healing is not yet complete," he answered easily.
"Fine. I detect nothing abnormal. He is merely sleeping," Gladys replied, straightening. "I recommend letting him rest."
at him! Totally freaked out, Ron turned to leave when he saw something flash from the brain. He froze, watching with wide eyes as thought pictures flashed before the brain. It was
Shadow instinctively reached out with his empathy; he had to know if he had hurt - maybe even raped - Draco. He was shocked at what he sensed. Draco was afraid, but not of what had happened. It was an immediate fear, fear of Shadow thinking poorly of him. He also sensed remembered pleasure, contentment, and excitement. Confusion coated all this, as well as a bit of shame. Shadow shut his empathy and staggered backward a few steps. God, he didn't think he could handle many more surprises.
"None." Charlie shook his head tiredly. The only boy who could save them from darkness was still utterly and frustratingly missing, and one of their most valuable agents was AWOL with him.
. I care about you. I want to help, but you won't let me in!" She covered her face with her hands and sighed. "I'm crazy. Talking to myself.”
Without further delay, Charlie concentrated and put both hands on the crystal orb. He left nothing out. By the time he was finished, sweat was dripping down his face and he felt utterly exhausted. He had no idea what they were going to do with Neville or Harry at this point. Neither of the teens were really controllable. Harry, especially, couldn't flake out in the middle of battle.
For four days, he had locked himself in his room, refusing to see his mother, refusing to eat or sleep. He was thinking; he was trying not to think. Draco didn't really know for sure which he was doing. He felt lost and he was grieving. He was only fifteen for Merlin's sake. His father was a psychotic murderer, worshiping a monster of a Dark Lord. His best friend was going to be hunted down as some evil creature…
"Please…" he whispered, arching to rub his bare chest against Draco's. When had that come open? He didn't remember, didn't care, "…
Ginny hugged him, making her brothers catcall and tease her. She ignored them, but Neville turned red again. "Come back some time?"
"The waterfall removes all glamours and concealing magic, my lord," Bogrod said conciliatory. "It is just another security measure set up to protect your vault, my lord. Did you know your guards were not who they appeared to be?" The goblin's eyes almost glowed as they turned toward a now normal and wet looking Severus and Remus.
Draco flushed with pleasure. "Yes, well…" Shaking his head, his bright expression dimmed a bit as he regarded his friend seriously. "Now that we have this all figured out, do you think you can tell me what's been bothering you?"
"Very well.” Augusta gestured for the boys to follow her into the living room. "You may now use the floo. I hope the Order can get your father back, young man. Now be gone."
"Better than I expected, actually," she said and smiled at him. "I'm now a member of the Wizengamot, Severus's potion granting temporary immunity to Veritaserum still worked, and the Order is unofficially being accepted. Fudge is still being difficult, but fortunately he is losing power. Any news about Severus or Shadow?" Minerva asked after taking a sip of her deliciously hot tea.
Shadow bit his lip and wondered if he would have to leave the room. His hands were shaking so badly, he had to clench them into fists.
Shadow shook his head and grabbed some toilet paper. Draco looked horrified, but at least it was softer. They returned to the others in the salon. The stylist looked very nervous.
There were shocked murmurs to this answer. Shadow was pleased when he sensed some shame among the other emotions. Good.
"We promised to help him!" Hermione pleaded. "If we can't help, we'll stay here, but if he's doing something heroically stupid again, he's going to need us!"
"You have no idea what I'm capable of," Shadow told them, meeting their eyes. "I'll be fine. If I get into trouble, I'll get out. I'm going after my father. I don't exactly trust the Order. They could kill him and say it was an accident or something."
McGonagall's hands clenched, her fingers turning white. She had suspected Severus would not return, but she had not found a suitable replacement. She intended to teach the class herself, but the Minister refused, saying her job of Headmistress needed all her time. Conveniently, the Minister did not inform her of this decision until the first day had past and she had no choice but to accept his replacement.
"For the first, even if you were dead, there was still Draco to think of.” Shadow glared back. "The Order would never have even conceived of the notion that he may need help. So my presence was necessary. For the second, maybe I want your cover blown! I don't want you spying! It's too dangerous!"
The walls were wallpapered, royal blue with cobalt diamonds. Hanging on the wall opposite the bed was a ten inch picture of Amalia sitting on the couch in the sitting room and holding a giggling and waving baby. To the right of it was a picture of Shadow opening birthday presents in the parlor. It was his thirteenth birthday and he looked like Harry Potter, but to the left of Amalia's picture there was a second one of him dueling Draco and he looked as he did now with curly hair and heterochromatic eyes.
Ginny strode over to Ron and her beautiful dark eyes took in his mangled from. "Is he okay?" she asked worriedly, her voice now deeper and throaty.
Remus felt his muscles relax and reached up to brush her hair away from her cheeks, feeling heat pool in his stomach. "Thank you, Dora."
The blond stopped and laughed. "I don't know about you, Black, but we should take this to the dueling room. Severus will skin us alive if we damage his precious books."
Draco glanced to the side at the urgency of that voice, but then back at the locket. He couldn't look away. Darkness swelled in him and pulled him in. He took a step forward, his arm lowering slowly. He needed the locket. But… There was something wrong. Something pounded at the back of his mind. Suddenly, a snap-shot of feeling, sight, and thought broke through the spell ensnaring him.
Unable to cast offensive spells while holding shields, Fred was left with his backpack. A swamp steamed and gurgled along the top benches above him, protecting him from Death Eaters sneaking up on him, trying to get the higher ground. Smoke bombs and impenetrable pink fog screened his half of the amphitheater, making him an even more difficult target, but that was thinning and it looked like he was about out of tricks. Neville, the two girls, and Shadow ran for him.
Draco ran after him. Neville had already gone past and turned down a hall that led to the front of the manor. Screams began shortly after. Running after him, they peered around the corner to see a woman in leather tearing at her clothes, revealing the cotton undergarments coming to life. Beyond her, Remus, Bill, and Tonks were there dueling three Death Eaters. The Death Eaters heard the horrific screams coming from the woman and turned. They took one look at Neville and Rodolphus and Apparated away.
"I can't. I'm too angry." Ron shook his head. "I mean, he's a git, yeah, but he's our brother! How can he just side with the Ministry against his own family, especially when the Ministry is being so blind and stupid? You-Know-Who is back and Percy is worried about the Order, as if they're the criminals! And he knows Hermione! He loved her, thought she had a good head on her shoulders. You'd think that would give him a reason to reconsider if she's barking or not! Argh! I'm going for a walk."
Severus accepted it. "The potion is in my room in the Chamber. The second shelf in the potions cabinet. It's clearly labeled."
"We're going to finish this conversation later, Nev," Ginny told him firmly, her brown eyes capturing his. "Okay?"
! - A black feather, identical to his soon-mate's but smaller, was drawn on the skin right below her delicate left collarbone. He could feel the two feather-marks, sense them on a deep level surpassing even scent. It connected them, and no matter how far they were, he'd be able to find them and know if they were ever hurt or afraid.
Panting, Harry tried to understand what was going on. This was happening so fast, so fast and he couldn't breathe or think, and he still needed more. Draco was staring down at him with that consuming gaze. He felt oh so good and hot, burning hot, and then a second finger pushed in, the dull pain bringing him back from the fog that scared him.
"The only way to destroy one is to use something so destructive there is no conceivable way to reconstruct the object through magic or any other means."
But if he waited too long, he wouldn't be able to attack anyway. He would have passively let his enemies kill him without a decent fight.
Anthony Goldstein and Michael Corner cried out as Draco's Numbing spell struck them and their arms went completely limp. In retaliation, Orlando Moran and Terry Boot threw Blasting curses at the blond. Draco dodged, almost into the path of Shadow's Muting Hex. The two boys cried out, however, when Shadow's Jelly-Legs Jinx hit them in the back.
Severus's dark eyes were neutral and his emotions were like a still pool, giving out nothing. He was the only person Harry knew who could become so still and accepting. Everyone else had a constant flow, no matter how small, of emotions escaping them. Only Severus could stop that flow and direct it inward, canceling it out so that he could observe and listen without distraction. It was one of the things Harry admired most about the man, one of the things he was most grateful for, especially since he was such a powerful Empath.
!" Eddie Carmichael, Ravenclaw Prefect, yelled. He had been coming down to the dungeons for Potions class with the rest of his class when they came upon the scuffle. He was honestly frightened about the damage the apoplectic Gryffindor could do. "Smith! Help me!"
Carefully, silently, Severus backed further into the woods. When he was certain he was out of sight, he returned to his make-shift camp as he considered his options. There was no way he could return to the Order. He'd be mistrusted. There was no one there to vouch for his integrity with Dumbledore dead. He had to stay clear of both groups. It was imperative. That meant he had to use someone who would be trusted to impart this critical information, and he had to do it quickly because he didn't know how long the Death Eaters would stay in this location.
Easy to realize, easy to say, but as he began to sink into the mind controlling his body… as he felt sheer unadulterated terror first hand… he knew he was right to fear it. It was the most powerful force he'd ever experienced. It reduced him to a mindless animal. His body wasn't even his to control. His bladder released and coherent thought was impossible.
"They think we're babies or something, I swear!" she growled in annoyance. "I'm fourteen for Merlin's sake! I can handle listening to a simple conversation. It's not like I'm running out to do battle or anything."
Shadow lay on his back, his eyes open, both of them glowing green - Killing Curse green. His face was unnaturally pale and the shadows in the room were alive, writhing around the teen's face and torso like ink-black heat waves. Draco scrambled backward off the bed with a sharp little cry of fear. Shadow's bloodless lips slowly began to smile, quirking in a mad little grin. Hunger and Rage lived in those green, green eyes.
Draco stared into the green eyes of his friend and could almost feel the alter's guilt and sorrow. He'd had no idea just how much Seraphim worried about him. "I'm fine," he promised. He reached to wiped away the teen's tears without thinking and dropped his hand when the alter flinched away. "Really, Seph. I'm not hurt."
"No," Neville interrupted coldly. "It wouldn't make them look for Shadow any harder than they already are. Besides, the oath won't allow it."
Draco captured his mouth and practically stabbed his tongue forward, certain he'd die if he didn't taste him
George broke first and began screaming in minutes. Fred lasted longer, going almost seven minutes, each feeling like a lifetime, before he began to scream. When the blood soaked their robes, Umbridge took great pleasure in stripping them so she could watch the words write over each other in sloppy lines across torn skin and bloody muscle.
The twins shared a glance and shrugged at the same time. George answered, "Night he got to Grimmauld Place."
"Black is looking for it at Grimmauld Place. Should it not be there, we will have to search pawn shops."
"Slow down, please, Hermione," Viktor soothed her. He led her over to his desk and sat in his chair, pulling her sideways into his lap.
Shadow thought about it. That had never been the focus in therapy. After a moment, he answered, "I guess I could. As a friend or family, like I have already. I still can't imagine… lusting after someone."
Shadow didn't know what to think about the bizarre therapy session with his father yesterday. He was pretty confident his secret was still safe - he couldn't even contemplate the alternative - but now he was more confused than ever. It made him feel adrift in a dark sea of confusion and he
The progress everyone was making was thrilling. Shadow felt himself grinning a bloodthirsty grin. Unable to contain the adrenaline, he made a beckoning gesture at Draco and the two of them clashed in a vicious duel. Slowly, the DA stopped their own practice to watch, their mouths falling open. The two Slytherins moved like true warriors. Dodging, distracting, feinting, using the watching students as shields, rolling and ducking and flinging carefully calculated spells.
"You are obviously more in tune to Demon than you are admitting," Severus snarled after one of Shadow's more exasperating silences. "Merging is closer than you think and you need to be careful."
"You go around that side; I'll come in from the left. Distract him and I'll grab him," the big man decided.
Draco followed hot on his heels. "Seph already killed the Dark Lord once. What are you going to do? Carry around a fang and try to stab the bastard?"
"Yeah," Draco answered, still stung by the Pansy remark. Now that he knew Shadow might like him in a more romantic way, he had refrained from engaging in the physical push and shove that the Slytherins used and practiced to influence each other. He'd never gone farther than kissing with anyone in Slytherin, but the art of seduction was something they all had to learn to grasp.
"I don't know, but I think you should owl Madigan. She is the Earth magic specialist." Remus shook his head and drew the still shocked teen into a half embrace. "Don't be so surprised. You have very special magic, Nev. I'm sure you are capable of amazing feats. This is just the beginning, I bet."
"But only…" Ginny was still staring. "No… It couldn't… But now that I think about it… Your friendship with Neville… and,
"What are you two doing?" the blond demanded again, now fully angry. He had done all this to get Shadow away from this place and here he was with Longbottom, of all people!
"How are things?" Remus asked softly. The curly-haired teen was the last in the class, still lingering over packing his bag.
"Which would work for all of two seconds before your Master read your mind," Harry drawled with a sneer. "Are we doing this or not? I'm sure old snake-face won't be pleased you're holding me up."
Sirius said nothing, wondering how things had ended up so twisted. There was Remus, the one man whose ethics couldn't be bent even for a prank, but he wasn't batting an eye at this. Nor was he coming to Sirius's defense as he normally would. Severus left without another word and Sirius fell onto a couch and put his head in his hands. He was so confused.
She came toward him to give him a hug, but Shadow quickly sidestepped her. His skin crawled and cold sweat broke out over his forehead and on his palms. Her eyes went wide and filled with tears. Ron's face turned redder, his fists clenching furiously.
"Someone came into the room I was being held in. The lights had gone out long ago, it was pitch black, so I didn't see who it was. Well, I had been waiting for a chance like that and attacked."
Harry sighed and stared down at his hands, one of them wrapped from wrist to fingers in gauze. "I know it would protect me from getting hurt, but it would also keep me from really living life. I want to live my life, not hide away from it, even though it can be scary and it can hurt me." He shook his head hard and closed his eyes. "God, I want to
Severus stood tall and straight. His lean body pale but strong. Freshly washed, ink black hair hung straight to his shoulders. Thin eyebrows arched over deep set, dark black eyes that watched his son's face for any sign of reluctance. He found none. Thin lips twitched up in a small smile before his hand brought the dagger to his chest, where he cut the length of his sternum as he continued to chant.
Draco read labels quickly, sniffed at ones that weren't labeled, and chose four. He poured them all down Severus's throat. The man didn't fight him, choking and sputtering after each one.
“However, with the death of the Headmaster and my attempt to defend him on the rooftop against assassination, I fear that the threat against your life is worse than ever. A house elf and secrecy is no longer protection enough, so I decided to reinstate your identity with the Ministry and enroll you officially at Hogwarts so that I may watch over you more closely."
Straining, falling twice, he managed to get Tonks, Remus, Sirius, and the Death Eaters over to the makeshift fortress with the frightened and injured teens. He turned to see where Draco was, wondering what was taking the blond so long to get Shadow and Severus up there. The room was empty. They were gone.
Getting to his feet, hissing at the pain in his head, he flung Lucius's limp body away from him. He could hardly see straight he was so furious. Slamming the door open, he strode through the hall and toward the dungeon where Bella was beginning the punishments for the pathetic failures who bumbled so badly at Malfoy Manor.
"Pardon me, good sir. I must excuse myself from this little tea party. I have a school to visit. Come, Theo."
Harry kept one eye on the stairs, just in case. He'd stayed in his Animagus form to prevent total panic and to avoid becoming the main target. He wasn't here for the fight. He was here to free Neville. Harry felt painful disappointment claw up his throat. Now that the adrenaline of the fight was dissipating, he was desperate to find his brother.
the teachers to disguise the fact that Umbridge was the real target. Plus, Severus wanted to examine anything they got out of Carrow's office, hoping it could give him a way to get at the vicious woman. The best part was, no one would suspect that they did anything. Everyone would think the twins had done it so they could have things to sell while they lived on the run.
"Really?" Shadow asked, shocked. He remembered Emmeline well. She was the witch who had pitied him so strongly and whom he suspected of telling the Ministry that she thought he was being abused by Severus. He would never have guessed she was gay and had married another woman.
Faced with true death, he forced himself to breathe, to think past his emotions. He dodged the spell, eyes narrowed. The barrier was allowing magic in. It had to have a weakness. His eyes scanned the ground, adrenaline sizzling through every nerve, making air race through his lungs in an attempt to keep up. He recognized a few of those runes.
The Potions Master had his hair pulled back in a low, short pony-tail. Worn like that, it looked shiny instead of greasy, but it revealed his hard, chiseled face. His father had been through too much to look young and his features were never considered beautiful. His skin was pale in a sallow way, his nose was large and hooked, and his eyes were deep-set and almost as black as his pupils. But he looked respectable and powerful. That mattered more than beauty in most arenas anyway.
Shadow moved to copy him. The lay silently for several minutes, but Draco couldn't sleep. He listened to his friend's even breathing. It was a familiar sound from his time at Grimmauld Place, and it usually put him right to sleep, but not tonight. Draco turned sideways and propped his head up on his hand. He looked down at Shadow's face in the soft green light.
Another side to this playfulness is the strong sensuality common to all feline Animagi. It is not surprising that Freya, the Norse goddess of passion and fertility, was associated with cats. The Lynx isn't an exception and is often very confident sexually and takes great comfort from physical touch. Unique to those with Lynx as their Animagus is that they are famous for expressive eyes, able to seduce with a look and able to sway others by their use of eye contact.
Shadow pulled away from the embrace. "Don't call me Harry. I'm Shadow, remember? And it was an accident really, but I'm glad I could help."
Draco unlocked the door after muttering at it for a few minutes, and they all stepped through to find themselves in a round room. It was completely black: the floor, the walls, and the twelve identical doors spaced evenly around the room. A single candle with a flickering blue flame hung on the walls between each door.
"Draco is not his father. I can't give you details, but we've been conversing for over a year. I trust him. You know I do. His name came out of that damn spell as an equal to Nev." Harry took a deep breath and met his mentor's eyes. "Well? Will you grant him sanctuary?"
Hermione's blush deepened. A few minutes later Seventh-year Brandy Cadwallader, a Hufflepuff Chaser, and Fifth-year Ravenclaw Padma Patil were elected. Shadow handed over the scroll to those who hadn't been chosen and made sure everyone signed. When that was done, he saw that there were twenty-four names, which didn't include the three others who didn't sign. That was more than the number of people who attended the meeting at Hog's Head!
Draco licked the abused spot and pressed a gentle kiss there, knowing it would leave a bruise later. That thought was strangely exhilarating and he bit his lover again, lower. Shadow cried out, excitement and need in the sound. Draco grinned and continued downward, biting and soothing repeatedly. Shadow was squirming under him. The sounds being wrenched from him were utterly delicious. Almost in a trance, Draco unbuttoned his lover's pants as need and pent up desire overwhelmed him.
"You want to be an Auror? You want to be an asset to this Order and not just a tolerated joke? Then you'd better be ready to do what needs to be done."
It looked unassuming, but when the unique charms were activated, the sleeves would lengthen and wrap her arms around herself to prevent her from physically lashing out. The collar would close snugly around her throat and act as a magical suppressant as well. Plus, it was paired with a bracelet that could track the jacket in case his Great Aunt had gotten lost or ran away. Her son, Herbert Lovegood, had owned the bracelet at the time of her death over ten years ago and would have inherited the jacket as well. He was amazed that Luna actually had it.
Draco felt his torn shirt twitch, he felt the fibers growing thicker and twitching against his skin. Horrified, he yanked Harry backward and to the side. They both fell into a small reading room. They rolled across the floor as books jumped and trembled, falling off their shelves. Harry jerked away from him, trying to untangle their limbs.
The centaur stepped out of the glamoured forest with surprising grace and folded his legs in the small clearing that constituted the classroom. He gestured at a spot across from him and Shadow sat carefully.
"Ah, Mr. Snape.” Flitwick came hurrying over as soon as he saw the curly-haired teen. The little man smiled and took Shadow's hand, leading him passed the curious stares of the Sixth-year Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs. "What do you think of Hogwarts so far?"
They hallway branched right and left, rooms opening up on either side with large archways. Art began to decorate the hall; sculptures stood on marble half-pillars. A painting up ahead shook and rattled against the wall before falling completely off, the frame cracking almost in two at the impact on the hard floor.
A picture of a chess board flashed by and Ron gasped, unconsciously moving forward. He would finally be special! The twins were so clever and Percy was perfect. Bill was the oldest and most respectable; a Curse-Breaker working in Egypt and engaged to a beautiful half-Veela! Charlie was the brave one and now he was running the Order of the Phoenix! Ginny was the baby and a girl; that made her automatically special. That left him with nothing.
Fear and hate churned in his stomach and he clenched his fists as sweat broke out across his brow. Panic was threatening to choke off his air supply and bring up bile from his stomach, but he forced himself to calm down. He'd had a similar reaction after finally being released from weeks of being placed under his father's Imperius Curse. He was a Malfoy and fear would not rule him.
Across the room, the blond Slytherin was leaning over a carved pumpkin his lips pressed to Pansy's. He could see clearly how her eyes fluttered shut and how her hand came to rest on Draco's shoulder.
Neville shivered again and easily summoned his own cutting razor. He handed it over wordlessly. He stared as Shadow cut across his opposite thumb and smeared the blood on the silver band. Shadow wrapped his arms around Neville's waist tightly and ground out. "Take me home."
"It is the same creature," Draco agreed calmly. "The Death Eater there cast a spell that transformed him again. We thought it was a one time occurrence, but obviously the transformation can be re-activated. Now that we know this, preventative measures can be taken."
Screaming, he jumped back as a white brain floated to his side of the tank. It was as if the brain was
"I believe you said that last year, as well.” Severus smirked and sat in the chair by the fireplace. "We should work on your judgment skills."
Draco moved quickly, seemingly able to tell what would or wouldn't work with just a glance. Not twenty minutes after they had stepped foot in the store, Shadow and Marissa were shown to the dressing rooms and were quickly trying on the outfits Draco had chosen.
," Shacklebolt almost snarled. "You cannot tell us half-truths and pull these kind of stunts and expect us to shrug it off as if it doesn't matter."
"You know the Prophecy?" Sirius gapped. He glared at Severus accusingly. "You told him? Don't you think he has enough to worry about without adding that crap?"
Neville smiled down at her. He admired her so much. He wanted to help prepare everyone for battle, to keep what his brother had created going, but he wouldn't be able to stand up here taking a leading position if it weren't for her. He turned as he heard the door opened and a few people came trickling in. Hermione came to the front to stand by Ginny and Neville. She stood tall and proud. Within ten minutes, everyone was there and a hush fell, waiting to hear the plan.
Severus shuddered and the pain in his voice turned cold and sharp. "But that was all taken away in September. Death Eaters got word of my family, and on the 15th, when Amalia took Tabitha to Diagon Alley for a Halloween costume, they attacked and killed them…" Old fury roared around him. The grief hadn't lessened, even after all this time. "Tabitha was only five months old…"
"And the influence goes both ways. Seraphim's phobia of touch explains why Shadow avoids physical contact and will only seek out touch from those he trusts completely, but he gains something from Seraphim as well. He can now unconsciously access the dark and light planes of magic. Once his magical channels heal, he'll be just as powerful as Seraphim, though I must admit it will only function in times of desperate need. I don't think he'll ever have conscious control over it. His psychology just doesn't lend itself to the frequency of the two planes as Seraphim's does."
. He knew if he answered the little, innocent questions, he'd soon answer the bigger ones, so he had sworn to himself he'd never answer
Eyes wide, he stared blindly. All the progress he'd made, all the mental stability he'd gained, were washed away and he was again just a scared fifteen-year-old who'd just finished his fourth year of Hogwarts with an insane father lurking behind every corner and a powerless mother. He wasn't even sure if his best friend was still alive. The last image he would have of his one and only friend would be his pulverized and tortured body in a dark cemetery with looming headstones that might as well bear the name Harry Potter.
Shadow pulled away gently and went to the presents and cake. They both needed space from the violent emotions they had evoked. He hesitated over the cake. He knew he was supposed to make a wish, but he had no idea what to wish for. He already had so much more than he ever thought he would… God… Did he really have a father now? It was a terrifying and joyful thought. He blew out the little flames and offered a smile, his own eyes dry again.
Shadow could see the struggle in her eyes. "Do you remember the summer after my Third-year? When I disappeared with Sirius?"
It only got worse when Seph turned into his Animagus form. Seraphim's possessiveness and animalistic desire and intensity toward Draco took his breath away. Draco obviously had some feelings for Seph. They were friends, Draco took care of him, but he was
"No two bodies can fit perfectly; there will always be arms and legs in the way, dissimilar curves, etc. Only the illusion of fitting perfectly can be granted and that is caused by a heightened sense of wellbeing and love for that person."
The twins saw that there was something cold in the depths of their friend's two-colored eyes that truly frightened them. With a quick glance at each other, seeing the agreement there, the twins did the unthinkable. They raised their already welt-covered hands and confessed.
The doors exploded and only Draco's spell kept them from being injured by the force of the debris. Glowing red eyes and fanged mouths filled Draco's vision as vampires stepped sensuously into the hall. Sirius bellowed a spell. Draco had no idea what he'd cast, but one vampire was flung against the wall. One of the girls screamed. More vampires and a few Death Eaters filled the doorway. Draco gritted his teeth and squared his stance. He aimed carefully, killing the farthest Death Eater on the right.
"And he will remain under stress for a long time to come,” Severus spat in frustration. He quickly took a breath, trying to control his temper. “We will see how he is at dinner." Severus countered. He turned his eyes to the blond. Draco regarded him coolly. "Perhaps you would like to work on some potions with me until then?"
Remus looked devastated. "Madam Pomfrey explained all this to us last night. I tried to get Tonks to abort, but she won't. She's certain the baby will not be a carrier of the virus. Pomfrey detected no trace of the virus so far. She said it was too soon to tell, really, but Tonks is stubborn."
"It was immature and I let my emotions take over." Shadow couldn't meet his father's eyes or Draco’s. Instead he stared at Severus's hands where they clasped his. "I wish I could take it back, but I can't. All I can do is promise to try and think more rationally before acting. I'm Slytherin, after all."
A gentle, warm wind curled around the hills. The leaves of his sanctuary whispered and rustled. Suddenly he remembered just who he was perched on and felt like an idiot. He had someone to talk to right here. He allowed himself to return to his freakish human form. Carefully maneuvering his longer limbs, he put his back to the sturdy trunk and allowed his legs to dangle to either side of the branch he sat on.
Augusta sniffed disdainfully, her opinion of his ability to manage the situation obvious, but she did as her grandson requested. She also cast another Stupefy on the unconscious boy just in case. "And just whom are you writing so furiously?" she asked archly.
"Then possibly you simply panicked; you were just overwhelmed," Severus continued. He slid forward and began a slow circle around the slender teen. "I overestimated your competence, perhaps."
She moved back to her desk and poured herself some tea. Usually she drank it black, but this morning she dropped two sugar cubes into the steaming liquid. Sipping it carefully, she jotted down notes to remind her to have all the secret passages examined and the wards strengthened around the school. She had assumed there was no way around their defenses and had been terribly wrong. She wasn't about to let that happen again.
"Severus was the only one I could trust, the only adult who ever really looked after me," Shadow said softly. "And I wanted a family. He offered me his name, his home, his love. I couldn't say no to that, not when I felt the same. And I wasn't ready to face what it meant to be Harry Potter yet. Being Harry Potter had already gotten me hurt so badly, but I didn't want to leave Hogwarts. I have things to do here, so we came up with the story of my childhood so I could come back and still be safe."
"Still…" Shadow felt tears burn his eyes. "You did all this because you knew I'd need to be Harry Potter again?"
"The curl at the top of a capital A is to the right. Look at mine! It's right in front of you! I can hardly tell these two letters are related, let alone the same one! Focus, Neville."
"He's in love, Longbottom, with a young man who has supported him faithfully. They share something you cannot come close to comprehending. It's incomparable to your adolescent infatuation with Miss Weasley. I only tell you this much because, regrettably, your rejection could easily destroy what little hope he has."
"I hope I'm interrupting," the old matriarch said coldly. "Neville is my ward and still a minor. It's illegal to question him without me. If this is an example of the respect you give Order members, I resign from my position."
"She's definitely gone too far," the brunet agreed. "But we still can't do much against her." He sighed and looked again at Draco's battered features. Standing, he crossed the distance between them and knelt next to his Slytherin friend. Gently, Shadow touched the bruised skin and muttered a healing charm.
"Seph? What's wrong?" Draco entreated. His hand reached forward, making Seraphim flinch involuntarily. The hand fell back without making contact. "Hey. It's okay. Talk to me. What's happening?"
Severus smirked at the contradiction. "You admitted love gives a deeper and more fulfilled happiness than one would otherwise experience."
"Wait up," Shadow called, going after him. They walked side-by-side downstairs. Shadow didn't speak until they were almost to the flooing parlor. "Thank you, Nev."
Loud talk broke out over at the Gryffindor and Ravenclaw tables, each discussing Umbridge mostly, but Shadow's name came up a lot, as well. There were speculations that he was so advanced because Snape would torture him if he weren't above average. Others said he must be ill or something for not being around before. Hermione, Ron, Neville, and Ginny were forced to ignore these false remarks and pretend ignorance. Besides, they were more interested in the awful things Umbridge said.
"He gathered his pack and my pack together, to keep them safe. We can't talk in my head to each other, not like I sometimes could with my other alters, but when we sleep, we do communicate a bit. Our dreams sometimes connect, probably because we act as each other's subconscious and dreams occur in the subconscious. I got across the point that if he protects what is mine, I wouldn't force him down so hard."
"Professor Vector?" Professor Gorgon asked softly. The man was almost seventy years old and a scholar through and through. He loved his books and ancient scrolls. Thin because he often forgot meals. Silver hair like a lion's mane because he forgot to brush it. Brown eyes bright with knowledge and enthusiasm for his subject. Only teaching could bring him out of his research.
Shadow's face went blank. She stood there with her chin jutted out and her eyes blazing with challenge, and it made him want to snarl, but a quieter part of his mind thought maybe she was right. He hated letting people get too close to him, but Hermione and Ron had invested themselves in his wellbeing once more as Shadow. That didn't mean he appreciated Ginny's tactics. Instead of trying to convince him or even sounding him out, she gave him an order.
Shadow bowed his head in acknowledgment as his chest expanded with happiness and pride. His father was trusting his ability to protect himself and to handle the situation in Hogwarts. "I'll leave the scroll so we can stay in touch."
Remus laughed. "Sirius hoped getting her interested in cooking would introduce her to a wider variety of food. We've had four days of green eggs and ham and are quite desperate for a change of pace."
A sharp pain speared through his face and he blinked quickly, unknowingly spilling tears down his cheeks. He stared into Sirius's eyes and suddenly he was released from the past and hurdled forward into the present. His mother was murdered. Lucius was no longer his father. Draco was no longer a Malfoy. Shadow wasn't dead.
Remus jerked as if slapped. His eyes bled gold and he roared as he stabbed downward, the fang miraculously piercing the gold metal. A horrid scream pierced the air and he jumped backward as the cup ignited in violet fire. A shriek sounded as the cup exploded.
Harry crumpled the letter in his fist and scowled at the wall. Draco was in trouble and Harry couldn't hardly sit up on his own let alone get to Diagon Alley, but he had to do something! Lucius had forced his friend to watch him torture innocent people when he was only thirteen and he put Draco under the Imperio Curse for almost three months when he was fourteen. Harry couldn't imagine what the man was like after the disaster in the graveyard.
Harry watched him go with a worried frown. Throwing on his Invisibility cloak, he made his way from the Chamber to Slytherin's common room. He found Rogan, Miles, and Lillian sitting by the fire studying silently. Harry shook his head at the sight. Those three silent wasn't natural. They were always talking, making jokes, smirking, even when studying. He crept up to Miles and whispered in his ear that he was there. The small Slytherin jerked as if electrocuted and gasped.
holds no claim on my body or my mind." He reached forward and carefully hooked the round glasses over his son's ears.
Neville shook his head, eyes wide again. No. He couldn't. He remembered terrified green eyes staring unblinking at him from under the couch. Harry had curled up into a ball, rocking and whimpering and broke into loud helpless sobs and almost incoherent pleas if anyone made any move toward him. How could it be worse?
He forced himself to focus and felt it: the vibrations of two animals running along his surface. He touched the nearest trees and they whispered happily, telling him of the creatures passing underneath them: one a scratch and climber, the other a digger. It was Shadow and Padfoot.
"Okay," she answered, hunched within her blanket, her face tear-streaked. "Okay," she repeated and took a deep breath. Shadow watched as the little girl gathered her courage and offered a small, heartbreaking smile.
He looked to see Severus standing several yards ahead, waiting. Shaking himself, he hurried forward and caught up. They moved down the hall, passing the people and fireplaces. Halfway down they came to an ornate fountain. A group of golden figures stood in the middle of small, still pound of crystal clear water. The tallest was a noble-looking wizard at least teen feet tall who stood with his wand pointing straight in the air. Grouped around him were a beautiful witch, a centaur, a goblin, and a house-elf. All looking adoringly up at the witch and wizard.
Draco turned to look at the pouting Marissa. "Don't worry, poppet. We'll be done soon. This will all be over and we can go home."
Without a word, shoulders stiff, Draco took his trunk and left for the twins' room. He carelessly tossed his trunk into a corner of the room. Spinning around, he punched the wall hard.
"Fuck you!" Harry screamed, vision going red. "It's not me who can't make up his mind! Is it me you want to fuck or is it Seraphim? I'm confused!"
Shadow smiled. He'd forgotten that he'd get that reaction. "Yeah. Seems like my father knew how to get in all along. He's hiding us there since not even the Headmistress has access to it."
"We recognized the unhealthy plants in the area might indicate you were being held there and received a good tip saying just that," Remus answered, putting a hand on his shoulder. "I'm sorry we didn't find you sooner."
Although Shadow hadn’t turned into the Dark creature that had attacked St Mungo's, something strange
… and instead launched himself out of his bed in his dorm room. Gasping, clutching at the lightning bolt scar blazing on his chest, he crawled away from the bed, wishing he could crawl out of his own head. He was crying, moaning with pain. Shaking, he gathered all his will and control to cast a wandless, non-verbal spell. A silver stag dove through the floor in search for Draco.
Draco didn't move, but Shadow's empathy showed him the blond was bracing himself for something. "I'll give it to you later."
“Oh." Shadow smiled, relieved. It wasn't so strange. Basically he was in Slytherin, but with Flitwick instead of Snape as his Head. He didn't think he would meet with or need Professor Flitwick, but if he did, he trusted and liked the man, or dwarf, whatever. His sister, Madigan, had saved Neville's life, after all. So he was happy with the choice. "Thank you."
"I mean it, Seraphim. You do not know the way and your ring is useless to you temporarily. Remember how hard it was to survive without help and shelter. You do not want to experience the same again." When Seraphim scowled at this statement that he could not survive independently, Severus pulled out his trump card. "Besides, you don't want to keep Draco waiting."
"That's my friend from school, Gran. He… He has a c-c-condition and whenever he gets like this he flees to safe places. All we can do is let him be until he comes out of it," Neville explained, trying desperately to stop the shaking in his voice and limbs.
"Do you know the specific trouble he is having?" Severus asked carefully, finally relaxing again in his chair. He was certain the unexpected emotional exhibit was finished.
The tension between Shadow and Draco evaporated as they stepped into the magical hospital. At the same time, they stepped toward each other as Neville took a step backward toward them; the three teens closed ranks for protection and support. Hospitals didn't bring back very good memories for any of them.
"Okay. Then let's get this over with." Shadow took a deep breath, feeling very grateful Neville hadn't backed out, and pushed open the door.
Yes. Things were going perfectly indeed. Lucius sighed contentedly and returned his attention back to Severus. His son was resourceful, Lucius would give him that, but he wasn't going to be able to escape. In fact, neither of the Snapes were ever going to leave alive.
Teary-eyed, Harry tore the paper and opened the box. Two small leather bound books sat inside. Harry carefully lifted them clear of the box and opened the first one. His eyes widened. It was Lily's diary! "How?" he gasped, staring at his father.
"Yes… So good. You are so… so good…" Lockhart panted in his ear, rocking against his back and ass for friction.
"You want me to say it, don't you." He tightened his arm and pulled Draco toward him. The movement made his face tip toward him slightly. Shadow pushed their foreheads together again. "… I admit it, okay? … I love you… God, it scares the shit out of me, but it's true. Are you happy now? Is that what you were waiting for?"
"Okay," Draco whispered, honestly afraid that Seraphim would hurt him. "Okay, Seph. I won't leave again."
"Shadow?" Lillian frowned, supporting him as he fell back into his seat, his face pale. "What's wrong?"
That answer had literally taken Shadow's breath away. He hadn't understood then just how deep Draco's loyalty ran. Shadow didn't deserve it then or now, but it made him feel incredibly warm nonetheless. And most of the time it was like that - Shadow leaning on Draco - but sometimes Draco revealed his own vulnerabilities and leaned on Shadow.
Shadow laughed and pulled away. He made sure his bag was tight on his back before activating the portkey. He disappeared, leaving the twins staring at his empty room with unusually worried frowns.
Draco was a panting mess by this point. He leaned forward to keep from collapsing and cried out when his revealed erection brushed against Seraphim's muscled thigh. A low growl resonated through Seraphim's chest into Draco's, and it had him gasping and squirming, every inch of his skin alive.
Shadow was once more walking down the windowless corridor, his bare feet slapping against the cool stone floor. As the door at the end of the passage loomed larger, his pale hands reached out with bloodthirsty lust to throw it open and force Demon into submission, to own the powerful entity… If he could only open it…
The blond opened his eyes and sat up. He rubbed at his face and then met Shadow's gaze, alert. "Is Salazar done?"
Remus was bending over the still form on the rumbled bed. Severus stood at Remus’s back, peering over his shoulder. He was standing so rigidly that Draco thought he'd fall over if anyone pushed on his shoulder. Sirius was standing beside Draco, his presence somehow reminding him of the Pureblood standards of behavior and comforting him at the same time. Reluctantly, his eyes drifted to the last person in the room, dreading what he'd see.
Draco met his eyes, his devastated expression shuttering closed. A hard determination settled over his features like a mask. For the first time, Draco realized that there was more at stake than the personal battle they were waging. They were fighting for more than their private reasons. They were fighting to prevent this from happening to more families. They were protecting the lives of hundreds and those hundreds now had faces. They had loved ones that would grieve. They were real.
They stood still and silent after the desperate proclamation, broken only when Ginny melted and ran to him, throwing her arms around his neck. "Neville Longbottom! Don't be dumb! I wouldn't hate you. I'm not asking you to do anything; I just want you to explain so I understand. I don't mind not doing stuff like that. Really."
Closing his eyes, Draco tried to get himself together. He didn't think he'd have any trouble convincing Marissa to stay. She was rather unhappy with Shadow at the moment. She'd asked earlier if Shadow had made the angel go away. Draco had tried to explain that it wasn't like that, but he didn't think he'd convinced her.
"I'm not sleepy, Sev'rus," Marissa whispered softly so as to not wake the two teens sleeping together in the chair.
The teens agreed and they walked in, the smell of good food wafting over them. Draco hadn't had anything good to eat since Seph had come Out, and Shadow had been camping with Severus for weeks. They barely glanced at the menu before ordering. Marissa took longer to order. She was too excited to choose and bounced on Draco's lap, grinning from ear to ear as Severus read her the children's menu twice. She had never been to a restaurant before, either. Shadow and Draco exchanged a determined glance over the little girl's head. She would never be hurt or deprived again; they'd make sure of it.
Magic crackled around him for a brief moment before fading into his skin. The rite had been activated successfully. It bound Draco to see that justice was done within a year of entering the vow if Shadow was unsuccessful or unable to do so himself. Should the blond fail in his charge, he would be penalized by having the suffering of the victim magically inflicted upon him.
The blond lay next to him. His legs were crushed and blood was pooled alarmingly around them, but he was still breathing, though unconscious. Seraphim scrambled to his side and laid his hands gently on the fragile chest. He summoned the White magic. It filled him completely and he closed his eyes as the warmth spilled over and through him.
"What happened in your detention?" Neville asked softly, perceptive as always. "I thought you were going to leave this up to the twins and not get involved yet, but you wrote me this morning to get them and meet you here. You said you changed your mind and wanted to help."
"No," Draco whispered thickly. He wrapped his arms around his chest; in part to hide their shaking, but also to keep from reaching out to the child. "Not mad."
Draco smiled, seeing Shadow's empathetic expression, and reached out and touched his shoulder. "Hey. We'll make it through this crap. We just have to keep it all in perspective. What matters is that we're in this together. All of us."
"What's up with the Slytherins, mate?" Hufflepuff Seeker Darlene Summerby spoke up. "They've been mighty quiet lately."
"You're right, of course.” Shadow smiled at him lopsidedly. Draco squeezed his shoulders once more and let his arms fall. The brunet laughed. "So you can see Dolores Umbridge is the least of my worries, though."
Draco groaned and opened his eyes. It was a harder task than he ever remembered it being. At first he didn't recognize the room. It was small and round with stone walls like a dungeon. His room at school was square and felt more comfortable, so he couldn't be at Hogwarts. Just as he discounted the school as his location, Severus stepped into his line of sight. His hair was greasier than normal and his face was haggard.
Draco met his eyes as Shadow opened his mouth and put the little snitch inside. Everyone froze and watched unblinking as that mouth closed. No one was prepared when instead of pulling out an open snitch, Shadow's eyes rolled up in his head and he collapsed bonelessly. Draco dove forward just fast enough to cushion his head before it impacted the stone floor.
Severus nodded and carefully turned the pages in the book he was holding as he explained. "I believe the adoption has effected him on an emotional level more than he knows. It brings forward old insecurities and needs. His first family abandoned him by dying. His second family thought him a freak, using that as a reason to inflict physical and emotional torture so strenuous that it shattered his mind. Just as he got free of his second family, he has willingly - something I'm sure he thought he'd never do - accepted a third family. Irrational as it may seem, he is terrified of being viewed as a freak for fear those he loves will either abandon him or abuse him."
"Let me tend your wounds," Remus rasped. He wasn't fairing much better than Draco, but being a werewolf his tolerance for pain gave him advantages the teenager lacked.
… Gritting his teeth, he pushed the thought of his lover away. He had to survive. Had to make sure as many as possible made it through this as he could. For Shadow.
"Fine." He placed the cup on the ground and handed Remus a long fang. "Stab it as hard and quickly as you can. I'll cast Fiendfyre as soon as you do, just to make sure."
"T-Tom really hated him. He read his father's memories and saw that his m-mother had worn a beautiful glamour that taxed her magic and strength. When she found out she was pregnant, she knew she couldn't keep wearing it or she'd k-kill herself and her child. She told her husband she was going to look different, but he promised to l-love her no matter what. She let the glamour go and he was disgusted by her appearance. He l-left her. Tom knew his mother died in childbirth, too weak from poverty and magical exhaustion to survive. He blamed his f-father for his mother's death and for sentencing him to live in the horrible orphanage. He was so
"Is this him, then?" Ron asked and Shadow turned to face him again. The girls were standing at his shoulders staring at Shadow with great curiosity.
Draco's expression hardened and his eyes flashed silver. His grip tightened and he pulled Shadow to the dueling room. Shadow didn't protest. He was having a hard enough time exerting control over his emotions and didn't have the energy to spare arguing or questioning his Slytherin friend.
When Shadow told him about Dumbledore's Pensieve, he hadn't mentioned anything about Horcruxes. Just that the Dark Lord had protections that allowed him to be resurrected, protections that needed to be dismantled. What Shadow was describing… It wasn't human. No human could do that and survive. It was… monstrous. And only a monster would do so. So now the face of the enemy wasn't an insane, powerful wizard. It was the face of an evil, powerful
"I talked to Godric. He helped Neville and I keep our movements about the castle at night away from Dumbledore. He said he could make her want to go to sleep by midnight and keep her that way until morning. As soon as she's out, those who want to come to the Room of Requirement can."
Shadow tried to sit up, but he didn't have the strength. Severus was quick to help him. Together they managed to get him sitting against the headboard. Severus pretended not to notice the gritted teeth and occasional sharp gasps. When Shadow was settled comfortably, Severus reached for his barely touched cup of tea and gave it to him.
"I love you, Nev," she whispered. "You're special. I know you are. I just wish you'd show it more. I wish you trusted me. I just want to be with you and you won't let me. I don't understand why, but I guess I don't have to. If you can't let me in, then… Then I guess we're done here. I can only be your friend and wait until you can trust me."
Severus nodded sharply and regarded the teen before him. "There is another topic I would like to speak to you about."
Since it was Saturday, there were more people out than on their previous walks. A few kids were still playing ball in one yard. A man was washing his car in another. Seraphim walked stiffly beside him, eyeing these people, but he was relatively calm. He was trusting more and more to the power of the jacket to keep people away from him. Draco smiled wryly as the Muggles walking with their dogs crossed to the other side of the street just to avoid the skinny, creepy kid in the straightjacket.
Shaking himself, Remus raised the fang and approached the golden chalice. His eyes caught on the beautiful way the light hit the metal, the way it sparkled. He could imagine the taste of water drunk from the cup. The purest water, of clean woods and sparkling rivers. It would be a shame not to try it first before destroying it. It was a priceless heirloom of their culture, of Hogwarts…
"What is there to explain?" Harry shook his head. "You know why I did it. I couldn't remain defenseless against him."
One night, Tabitha's stomach pained her. She cried and whimpered for hours. Amalia and Severus took turns walking her around the house, patting her back and rubbing her belly. She was too young for strong potions and the mild ones only dimmed the pain, not removed it. Near dawn, Tabby finally fell into exhausted slumber. Severus sat with his back to the couch in front of the fire in the sitting room. Amalia sat between his legs, her back to his chest. Tabby lay across her lap, and both of them slept with small smiles as Severus watched over them.
"It does." Amusement flared up in Severus' aura, though his face remained neutral. Shadow narrowed his eyes suspiciously. "Do you not recognize the date?"
Eventually they reached the courtyard where he'd had his lessons in Earth magic. Panic made his palms sweaty and his heart rocket against his ribs. He
Sirius nodded, but it looked mechanical. He stuttered something and stumbled from the room. Harry looked up at Remus calmly. He wasn't very worried. Sirius would either be okay with the offer or he wouldn't. Remus smiled and pat his shoulder before turning and following his friend.
Severus let him go, watching him as he bustled around the kitchen. Shadow moved with efficiency and grace while preparing their simple meal. It reminded him painfully of Rose when Shadow began to hum under his breath. His son was probably unaware he was even doing it. It was hard to remain strong and not let any of his doubt through - he felt naked without his long, concealing hair - but it didn't look good. The Dark Lord had supposedly made seven Horcruxes.
Lucius snapped his fist out, backhanding his son hard across the cheek. Draco slammed into the wall with a soft cry. Shadow's tail lashed furiously, but he forced himself to hold still and silent. Moving wouldn't help either of them right now. But God. It was so hard not to leap out and scratch that bastard's face off. Rage was beating warmly in his chest like a second heart.
With a trembling hand, Neville wiped away the spit and foam from his brother's mouth. He could hardly feel the soft puff of air as the teen exhaled.
Ginny pulled slightly away from Neville and with great effort was able to suppress her tears. "I want to hear what you both have to say for yourselves," she said firmly. "Let's go, Nev."
"I'm okay," she promised, her cheeks warming with embarrassment and pleasure. "Professor Snape has helped me a lot. Thank you, Viktor."
The cashier quickly rang them up, sweat dewing on his forehead. Draco paid with the little bit of Muggle money he had leftover from when he and Sirius had been searching for the damn locket. He hooked two of the plastic bags on his left arm and grabbed the third with his free hand. Seraphim followed him out happily. Draco stopped as soon as they were out of sight and shrunk the bags.
His nest-sib was making chattering-noise - had been chattering, he realized - and he glanced back at him curiously. The smaller male was still crouched, slight fear and strong anxiety sharpening his scent. Was he worried about the predators, too? He growled. No one would touch
"Let's talk somewhere private," he said and gestured for them to follow him. He was just leading them out of the common room when Ginny ran up to them.
Wide-eyed, he looked around his father's bedchamber and tried desperately to remember how he got there.
The door to the next room opened and Severus stepped into the hall, wrapped in a black sleeping robe. His dark eyes immediately pinned Draco in place and demanded answers. Draco had no doubt that should his professor deem him the cause of Shadow's distress, he would be taken care of.
Shadow's voice held him prisoner. Draco felt tears burn his eyes as the melody filled the room like the sound of the ocean. Shadow bent his whole body into the song, his head hanging, tears glistening on his cheeks. And as the music slowly built again, Shadow's voice lifted in a hum before soaring, loudly proclaiming his pain to an indifferent world.
Shadow felt his hands go cold. The heavy food from the Feast condense into a hard, greasy lump in his gut. He tried to tell himself that this was good. This was how it was supposed to be. This was keeping him safe from his own sick desires, but it didn't help. He still felt cold and angry; worse, he felt alone. Really, truly alone.
"Thanks." Sirius clapped him on the shoulder, making George stagger slightly. "Now about that breakfast you promised me…"
Silently, the two teens crept forward, going deeper into enemy territory. Shadow kept all his senses as open as he could make them, especially his Empathy. He could feel the panic, fear, and affronted rage mixing and swirling in the caves before them. Faint from distance, battle adrenaline and joy, mingled with rage and hate above and to the side. It was exhausting and slightly disorientating, but it was worth it. He knew when a Death Eater approached them long before their ears picked up anything.
Vernon turned and charged the blond, face ugly with murderous rage, but Draco was ready and he calmly incanted, "Riddikulus."
"Partly because at the time I had divided feelings about you," Shadow replied reasonably. He looked up at his father, his new features a subtle reflection of the man before him, his dual-colored eyes reminding Severus painfully of his mother.
The man's dark eyes held those of his son's thoughtfully. After a long moment, he spoke. "I will stay and help the Order strategize."
"You're so fucking annoying!" Shadow grunted furiously, tears burning his eyes. Why did Draco have to pry into everything? Why couldn't he just leave things well enough alone?
Shadow nodded. "The charms I gave Neville and Rogan will only work for adolescent magic. Sirius's will work for anyone, but I'm sure he won't let anything happen to it."
A second shadowed figure moved in the background and came forward. A cup was placed at his mouth and he swallowed cold water. It felt heavenly against his abraded throat. It also seemed to wake him up a bit more. His eyes adjusted to the dimness and he recognized that it was Neville sitting at his bedside, holding his hand. The water-bearer was Severus. Both looked drawn and grim.
And if Death Eaters, the Ministry, and Order politics weren't enough, Shadow had quite a few personal problems as well. Demon was the hot topic of conversation in his therapy sessions over the last two weeks. However, Severus's attempts to discus it was met with a complete lack of response from the teen.
"Often enough," Shadow answered wryly. He leaned away from the warm chest and wiped at his face. "God."
Severus faced his old enemy and Sirius flinched from the cold threat in the dark eyes. "Do you really think my son needs to know that he is indirectly responsible for even more suffering? Are you really so petty as to tell him such a thing just to get at me?"
Shadow shrugged. "I'm going to do it with or without your advice, but I figured I should make use of any resources I can."
Seraphim glanced over at him and smiled before shoving with his magic. Draco was well within ten feet and his swing moved forward quickly. Draco laughed, making a grab for the chains and let Seraphim push him on the swing. It was a very strange sensation. There was nothing like swings in the Wizarding world. It reminded him vaguely of flying, but at the same time it was very different. Every time he came down, his stomach felt light and tickly, and after a while he began to feel almost sleepy despite the speed, which he
Draco forced down his disgust. Instead, he forced his features into a haughty, Purebred expression. "My mother, Narcissa Black, has granted me the high honor of welcome within her bloodline instead of my father’s. Sirius Black has accepted me as his Heir."
Severus stared at him for a moment and the redhead thought for sure he was caught in a lie, but then the man said, "I appreciate you bringing my son to me. You may go."
Shadow scowled at that, but couldn't argue. He did feel tired. It was very annoying, however. It seemed like he was always in bed lately. He turned to Draco. "Wake me for DA, okay? It's at six."
"I've been thinking," Hermione said, adding her voice. "Maybe because Shadow hasn't been here since he's been eleven, he has a clearer perspective about the Houses. I mean, none of us shy away from him even though he's Slytherin, too. We don't really think it counts somehow because he hasn't grown up here. And that's made me realize that if we were Sorted now, it wouldn't work. None of us are simple kids anymore. Think about it. Can you so easily classify your parents' friends into Houses? Adults aren't that easy to categorize. So are we adults or are we still children?"
"She died defying the Dark Lord. She wouldn't bend her will or her magic; a true Black until the very end. Her death will not be in vain. We will remember her example and honor it," Sirius said softly, eyes pinned to the blond Slytherin.
"So he could know what you're doing?" Ron asked faintly, looking a bit sick at the thought of Voldemort watching them all right now.
"We could get into a lot of trouble," the Ravenclaw girl next to Cho said. "We all saw what she did to punish us for not telling on Fred and George. I thought this would be more like a study group. This all seems a little… extreme."
They stood next to the garden for hours, but were unable to leave. Around midnight, Neville stiffened and slowly the force and heat of his Earth magic diminished until he opened his eyes. They were sparkling in a way completely unlike the boy they knew.
"It didn't really help," Draco insisted. "It didn't tell you anything you couldn't figure out on your own. It's too big of a risk. I'm all for short-cuts, but not when it could cost you your life. We'll just have to trust the Order to be able to monitor the Death Eater activities, maybe convert another student who has Death Eater connections and who's willing to pass us information."
"Did he think about how he was invincible?" Shadow questioned, hands clenched on the couch, almost holding his breath for her answer.
"In any case, I think it's a good idea. The Prophet said these new educational decrees have been supported by the parents. If we can get a large group of parents to protest, maybe it will slow the Minister and Umbridge down," Hermione exclaimed. She pushed her hair out of her face and a spark of obsession shinning in her eyes.
"I haven't actually retrieved it yet," Remus-Sirius admitted sheepishly, rubbing the back of his head. "I had only just found it when I had to come here and replace Moony. I did run a few diagnostics, though, and let me tell you, this place is locked up like Azkaban! It's going to be hell getting in, but I'll manage. It just might take me a few days."
Severus appeared beside him and fell to his knees, panting. Dehydrated, starving, he almost followed Shadow into unconsciousness. Head hanging, he regulated his breathing and carefully shifted so that he was sitting up right so that he could fire off a Patronus message toward headquarters. The spell took the last of his energy and he crumpled sideways, his body collapsing protectively over his son.
Shadow nodded. "He's going to be heading there as soon as he gathers his forces. We need to do the same. We have to protect the castle and the students. Voldemort can't be allowed to get inside until the diadem is destroyed."
He looked over at Shadow as the brunet began laughing at something. The Slytherin put his arm playfully around Neville's shoulders. Neville didn't do anything to move Shadow off. In fact, he looked flushed and happy. Ron's eyes narrowed as he began to frown.
"Snape probably just recently figured out a way to suppress the change with his potions," Moody growled, impatient. "Think, woman. Why did Snape bring his son out of hiding
Blaming the massacre on the Dark Lord would accomplish two things. The first being it further protected his son, forcing the authorities to look in the wrong direction for the guilty party. The second thing it did was throw the remaining Death Eaters - who were plotting his son's death - into a panic. They would be frantically trying to figure out which Death Eater committed the crime and why. They might even believe that the Dark Lord was back somehow and coming for them for their disloyalty, just as Harry Potter supposedly was come for them for revenge.
"Yes, Professor Umbridge," Shadow answered calmly, almost smiling. The bitch of a woman was actually doing him a favor. For not only were the twins pissed, but the Slytherins were beginning to look upset as well, and not at him. Their slightly narrowed eyes were directed at Umbridge. She was making him allies without Shadow having to do anything.
"Clever. I am also proud that you discovered the key to the snitch. You've been doing very well here."
He had lived in utter isolation. His view of the world and himself had been so twisted that hurting himself,
Hissing at the pain, Shadow's first thought was of Neville. His brother had DADA yesterday, and if he had to use the quill, Shadow didn't want to think what that had done to him. He had been doing so well with his addiction, this could throw him over the edge. Then he thought about Hermione. His once-friend had been assigned many nights of detention with Umbridge since school started. The Blood-Quill went a long way to explain Hermione's drawn features and withdrawn behavior.
Draco sat up and pulled the furiously panting teen into a tight embrace. Shadow struggled for a moment, but then gave in, going limp against his chest. Draco's mind was racing. He had pictured some violent encounter, a vicious rape of a twelve-year-old child, but slow and pleasurable never crossed his mind. He didn't know what to think or what it meant, but he could feel Shadow trembling in his arms and he hated that he was the one to upset him.
Draco looked up at him, his grey eyes grief-stricken and aged. Severus nodded, silently telling his student how proud he was of him. Draco watched as Severus positioned the bitch just so, made a few final touches, and bent to carry his son in his arms. Shadow was only one hundred and fifteen pounds, so it was easy for Severus to do.
On the way downstairs, Severus stopped and changed his clothes. He considered taking a quick shower, but he was anxious to talk with his son, so he merely washed his face. Brewing all night was hell on his hair, so he quickly tied the greasy locks back in a low ponytail. Ready for the confrontation ahead, he made his way to the parlor and was glad to see Shadow sitting alone. He noticed the slight circles under the teen's eyes and that his face was paler than normal, but Shadow's eyes were also alert and sharp, his posture steady.
"I'll stay with the boys," Remus offered. His own eyes were hard and golden. He looked beat to hell, but he was full of protective strength.
"They're gone." Remus shook his head, amber eyes following the Aurors as they left the house and began casting diagnostic spells around the immediate yard. "Severus must have unraveled the Displacement Enchantment. They're most likely in Italy."
The memory blurred and Shadow watched and listened to his friends explain the lessons they grew up with. Lessons of strategy and simple mathematics. Neville had lessons in ethics. Draco had lessons in business and economics. What really stood out were the story lessons where both Draco and Neville were sat down and told history and magical theory in story form. It definitely made it easier to learn and remember when taught like that.
The elf sat up and placed his wet face between his knees. He began to rock backward and forward. "Master Regulus had proper pride. For years he talked of the Dark Lord, who was going to bring the wizards out of hiding to rule the Muggles and the Muggleborns… and when he was sixteen years old, Master Regulus joined the Dark Lord. A year later Master Regulus came down to the kitchen to see Kreacher. He always liked Kreacher. And Master Regulus said… he said… the Dark Lord required an elf."
Shadow sighed. "This is ridiculous. The Ministry is desperately searching for you and wants to string you up for all the world to see and you're living in the same castle as the Undersecretary and new Hogwart's High Inquisitor. You told me you'd be more careful after that London sighting!"
"It's wonderful, Ron!" Hermione promised, transforming into a mouse quickly and back again. Under Severus's supervision, she had completed the Animagus Transformation that summer. "Go on!"
To imbue the pumpkin with its full power, Lillian went on with a grin, it was best to share a kiss with a friend or lover over the pumpkin just as the candle was lit. Shadow laughed at this, certain he was being teased, and turned to ask Draco.
"What's with the long faces?" Sirius called loudly. He threw his arm around Shadow and Neville's shoulders and almost bent them in half with his full weight. "You promised me an hour to party!"
Neville jumped and spun around. "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to wake you, I just wanted to, I mean, look out the, I just…"
"He has only two instincts to contend with and one of those urges is very submissive. His thought processes are still very childlike, but should he mature and grow, his more serious disorders, tensions, and psychological conflicts would appear in Shadow. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is just one example and possibly dementia since his reality centers would most likely be completely warped."
Draco stepped forward, pulling the door shut behind him. He spelled the door locked and warded it for privacy. "I've let you sulk enough. We're going to talk about this."
"How do you know about that?" Charlie frowned. He had thought the situation was being kept under wraps.
Luna and Ginny - now bleeding from a gash along her hairline - followed closely on his heels. Shadow shook himself and followed after, limping slightly on his burnt pads. They burst into the amphitheater room with the veil. Neville hesitated, but it was impossible to hear whispers over the sound of battle and the clash of spells. It was madness.
"Good," Remus-Sirius nodded, still smug. He crossed his arms over his chest and grinned. "It's only a matter of time, now."
"Nev? You okay? It should be me freaking out over here," Shadow said playfully, but his eyes were tense with nervousness. "You don't have to go in with me."
"Hey. You'll be a big help later, but today is just boring stuff," Draco said softly, stroking her hair.
"Calm down, Draco. There is no evidence of distress. I believe Shadow's mind is controlled and organized enough to at least struggle against an unwanted intrusion."
Seraphim screamed in terrified fury as one of his pack members dropped to the floor and began to convulse. The starry sphere holding the enemy shrunk and disappeared with a pop, summoned to safer ground. Seraphim jerked forward, intent on revenge, but came to a stop as the sound of the dark-eyed man's feet drummed on the creaky floor boards. Terror tipped the balance. He ran forward and grasped the man's arm, already pouring White magic down his hands.
Draco thrust up against him fast and hard, his dick a rigid line cradled in the dip of Shadow’s hip and groin. Shadow mirrored him. His long, pale fingers were pressed on either side of Draco’s head. He was practically eating Draco’s face and every small nip and hard suck, every brush of Draco’s tongue along the soft tissue of his mouth, made him shake and tremble, his cock throbbing hot. Sharp shocks of pleasure zapped up his spine, made his nipple tingle as his shirt rubbed against them. His skin flushed red as he rubbed and thrust against Draco’s hip and groin.
Draco had abandoned his beloved mother for him. He had killed Dumbledore for him. He'd stood by him against Umbridge and guarded his back from Slytherins and Gryffindors alike, putting himself at odds with his beloved House. He'd faced his fear of the Dark Lord for him. What had Shadow ever given him back of equal value? A few laughs and a listening ear?
Ron and Hermione nodded silently, accepting that. Ginny said nothing, her eyes on her lap. She knew personally - in a way that Ron and Hermione didn't understand - that things could leave marks that couldn't be seen. The twins also understood because they had seen the results and experienced it first hand. They had seen Boy. They knew how seriously Shadow had been hurt.
"I'm not confused," Neville spat, fingers fisted in the sheets. The only thing keeping him from attacking her with his bare hands was Remus's strong arms wrapped around him.
Severus saw the withdrawal, the hysteria, and held firm. He had to say something now or the idea of being damaged and at fault would fester deeper. "Listen to me!" he snapped. "You have a mental condition. It's nothing to take lightly. Lockhart manipulated that to indulge his own sick desires. Kit may have borne the abuse because she was best able to handle it, but she never sought attention like that on her own! Never! She was reactive not proactive. She was a coping device that went awry, under no fault of your own!"
Severus inclined his head graciously. He very carefully kept the pang of sadness he felt from his face. The child had wanted, for a split second, to hug him, but she was still afraid that physical contact meant pain. It would be a long while yet before she initiated a touch.
"Haven't been getting much info from that area recently." Fred nodded, excited again. He rubbed his hands together gleefully. "I wonder what juicy stuff we'll overhear now that all the kids are out of the building and they think they're safe from being overheard."
"Nothing's wrong, Gin," Neville maintained, but his hands were beginning to shake. "Don't do this. Everything is going so good. I love you."
Draco smiled and pulled him into a loose hug. "He said he was sorry. That he's glad we're together. He liked how happy you looked when we were dancing. He left because he's still struggling with issues of his own, but they have nothing to do with you. He's coming back down to the Chamber tomorrow night."
Shadow smiled. ”Shadow Harold Lilium Snape.” He looked up at his father and nodded his head. He understood the gift and it wasn't his ring. His gift was Severus's commitment to be his mentor and father. It was the most precious thing he had ever been given.
Shadow smiled to show he didn't mind sharing and they opened the gift together. It was an old photo album of the years their parents had gone to Hogwarts. There were pictures of the Marauders, people they didn't recognize, some of Severus, but what caught their attention were the pictures of Alice and Lily.
The curtains silencing Mrs. Black’s portrait flung open at the redheaded woman's bellow and added her own voice to the mix. "FILTHY HALF-BREEDS, BESMIRCHING THE HOUSE OF MY FATHERS!"
"The man saved Shadow dozens of times and helped us all with the Animagus potions," George added. "Slytherins can be useful."
Shadow was swept up into it all. Gryffindor House did some of these things but individually. It wasn't a House celebration. In Slytherin everyone participated. It was like a miniature festival. Clueless about it all, Rogan and the others had to explain to Shadow the reasoning behind everything.
"I see you are awake," Severus spoke, coming into the room. He was still limping and Harry suspected that it was a permanent injury. The thought made him instantly angry.
"We can't just sit around, either. It'll make us look weak," Draco growled, frustrated. Were they destined to always have their hands tied, unable to strike back at the enemy?
he thought carelessly. He looked up into the now unshaded sky and smiled miserably at his brother who came to stand domineeringly over him. It didn't last long. Neville crouched and put their faces level. Shadow unclenched muscles he didn't know were knotted. God, he was such a mess.
With a snarl, Lucius snapped his wand up. "The Dark Lord is waiting, Potter. Come quietly or I'll be forced to…"
He would never hurt Seraphim again. But the cold was. The cold was hurting him, and he didn't know how to stop it. The magic was gone. Keening, he curled up.
Neville didn't respond. He reached the woods on the edge of their property and made his way under the dark canopy. He was walking blind now, but he knew his place and his steps were confident. Luna slowly fell behind, her footing not as sure. Suddenly Neville was flung up against a tree. His breath whooshed out of him and he gasped as he was painfully leveled up off the ground, his back scraping along the bark. White light burst into existence, casting sharp shadows across his attacker's face.
"Bloody hell, Severus, what's going on?" Draco demanded, shoving his wand back into his robes. He didn't wait for his answer, though. Taking a deep breath, he quickly reported. "Charlie Weasley asked me to tell you that he wants to be allies, all past deeds forgotten. He's desperate to find you and Shadow."
Shadow smiled wryly. They made quite the pair. "Let's talk in that bathroom near here. It should be safe."
"Very well," Severus agreed. He sat with his legs crossed comfortably and linked his long-fingered hands over his stomach casually. It was going to take very delicate maneuvering to get an unguarded answer out of his son about Draco. "I must admit I was doubtful at first, but Salazar has really come through."
Neville clung to him. With his parents ill all his life, he never really had an adult show affection or pride. Remus was the one to come to him and get him to talk about Lockhart. He was the one to help him through the emotional damage he carried and helped him come to terms with his cutting. Remus was the closest thing to a father he had ever had.
Over the next week, Shadow hated to admit it, but he didn't sense Salazar messing around with Boy while he slept. In fact, he slept deeply and without dreams. That might have been due in part to working hard all day and playing the piano at night until he was exhausted. Draco usually sat with him during these late night jam sessions. The blond hovered more than usual, worried about another seizure.
He had no idea what to do and Leanne was only hurting herself trying to contain her friend's thrashing. Luckily, he didn't have to think of something as Severus came running up with the Headmistress at his heels. She took one look at the situation, saw that Severus had Katie, and gathered a sobbing Leanne into her arms.
"Almost five," Shadow answered, his eyes searching the street. Neville and the twins were supposed to floo to the Leaky Cauldron and then take a Muggle taxi to their position. What was taking so long? "We might have to go without them."
Draco grinned, accepting the barb as the challenge it was. He thrust his hips forward playfully, making Shadow gasp. "Careful, little lynx." He pushed away from Shadow and did a turn, his shoulders tilting forward as he did a little gyration that brought attention to his lean chest and abs. He reached out and spun Shadow before pulling him back into his chest, much closer than before.
The expression the alter wore was one Draco knew very well from his Sundays with Boy. The child was still hungry for affection. It made Draco want to give him anything and everything he wanted or needed, made him want to shower the child with toys and hugs. Thankfully he had practice at restraining himself and managed to remain still in response to the beseeching look. He knew to do otherwise would only frighten the child and make him confused and uncomfortable.
"Good." Severus stood and gestured for Shadow to rise. "I've promised the Headmistress that I shall bring you to Headquarters soon. We only have a day or two for you to view all the memories of Amalia and Tabitha that you should have. We will also need to discuss more concretely how you've been occupying your time so we have our stories straight. You'll have to memorize the list of your tutors and their information, as well as memorize my own and Amalia's family history."
Pomfrey had also estimated the girl as being three and a half years old. She hoped whoever had hurt the precious child had been held accountable for their horrific actions. Severus kept his face perfectly neutral as he assured her that they had.
The twins guided him to the bed and fawned over him. Shadow smiled at them and let them fuss. He wanted to have their whole attention, so letting them burn off nervous energy was in his best interest. After a few minutes of them offering to get him a drink and warmer socks, they finally fell silent and looked at him expectantly.
"Did he rape you?" Harry demanded, furiously. "Just tell me the truth!" Sitting, up it was his turn to grab Draco by the shirt.
"Yes, My Lord, yes… I-I used to work in the department after - after all… Bode could never have t-taken it, My Lord… Undoubtedly that is why he fought so h-hard against Malfoy's Imperius Curse."
The lift doors were only halfway open when the pale hand reached for his son. Time slowed and Severus felt like his world was exploding around him. He wasn't prepared. The chance that the Death Eaters would come to the Ministry never occurred to him. They were in hiding, on the defensive. This couldn't be happening!
He had allowed himself to be lulled back to sleep, satisfied with the death and pain he had inflicted in these half-dreams, but not this time. This time he was too
Shadow fought to even his breathing, bracing himself over the bathroom sink. Why? Why wouldn't these dreams stop? He was either stalking Demon's stone door or dreaming of torture at Lockhart's hands. Tonight it had been a new breed of nightmare, a blending of the two.
The thirteen-year-old nodded, tears falling down her pale face. She rose without saying a word and practically fled.
She stood on tip-toe to kiss his lips. Hurrying from the room, she struggled to calm her breathing and cool her raw face. She was almost to Charms class when Ron found her.
Shadow shivered. "It's too much," he insisted weakly. "It's still too much. It wouldn't matter. I couldn't… I still couldn't…"
"Lucius, Bella," he said affectionately, allowing his magic to activate their Dark Marks. The sharp pain only made them smile, their senses by this point so far twisted that it felt like pleasure. "You two will be my generals. It is almost time. Divide those here among yourselves. Lucius, you will handle the attack on Hogwarts. Be very sure the assault unfolds
"All right. I'll see you there.” Shadow stood and made his way out of the room and toward his first class of the day: Charms.
Shadow pulled away from Draco and gave the redhead all his attention. "What do you remember, Ginny?"
The four of them were sitting in the stands - the Slytherin side of course. It was about three in the afternoon. For the first time all week, the sky was cloudless and dry. The cool breeze felt good against Shadow's warm skin, his head had been throbbing ever since last night when Salazar had begun studying his head.
"He needs his father. I'm going to write Professor Snape now." Neville looked up at his grandmother pleadingly. "Let him stay that long, please."
"What are you talking about?" Draco demanded. He put himself in his friend's path and grabbed his shoulders, stopping his frantic movement.
Smiling, Draco quickened his pace, passing the last of the small dilapidated little houses. The dirt lane wound through tall green summer grass, through skinny trees that made up the woods in the area. He couldn't see anything ahead; his view blocked by the gentle hills, but that was okay. He was enjoying his walk. It was a nice change after all the whirling portkey trips.
Getting to his feet, Shadow bowed deeply. "Thank you," he said softly. He was as confused as ever, he hadn't gained a direction, but nevertheless he knew he'd been given a gift. The centaurs words were wise beyond what he could see now. It wasn't Firenze's fault that he couldn't understand.
Fudge looked at the pile of reports stacked on his desk, all of them flagged red as emergencies. It was Thursday, the week almost blessedly over, but it looked like all concepts of normal business hours was about to go out the window. Amelia Bones, Head of Magical Law Enforcement had been killed. No, it was worse than killed. She'd been dismembered and displayed as a deterrent to anyone who went against the Dark Lord.
Dried rivulets of blood stained the wall from the ceiling down to the pictures, giving evidence that fresh blood - fresh emotion siphoned down from the coral reefs - had been there. Wet, warm blood still dripped from the crayoned pictures - the emotion centers - and kept the pictures connected to the pool of blood on the floor. The puddle contained all of Boy's memories. If you looked, you could see them played out on the surface of the red liquid in an endless nightmarish loop.
McGonagall had scheduled the small wedding to start at ten on Saturday, an hour after curfew. Neville had gone to bed right at nine and then snuck out at ten when Shadow had come for him with the invisibility cloak. The ceremony lasted just a little more than half-an-hour and Severus rushing them back to the Chamber had them returning to Hogwarts by eleven.
Sirius looked up at his old enemy with surprise. He had known the answer would be a rejection before he had even asked, but he had spent a lifetime speaking before thinking. Therefore, it took him almost a whole minute and for Severus to lift an eyebrow with cold derision before he realized he had been given what he had asked for.
Bogrod did something and the cart rocketed forward. They rocketed along the track that resembled a rollercoaster more than anything else. Sharp turns to the right and left almost had him flying out if he hadn't such a firm grip on his father's thighs. Slowly, they spiraled their way downward toward the oldest, deepest vaults.
The dog morphed and Remus stepped back. Sirius grinned sheepishly and patted at his bleeding cheek and nose. "Guess he didn't want to talk to me."
It didn't come soon enough. Suddenly spells were exploding all around them. Shadow dropped his brother and cast a powerful shield around him, before turning and facing their enemies. His distraction cost him and pain scrapped along his nerves. Screaming, he collapsed, fighting as Boy slowly began rise to the surface. Severus stepped over him, roaring in fury. As his father passed, the spell disappeared.
Hermione shut her eyes as if she had been shot. Ron stared at him dumbly. Neville had tensed and was prepared to move should either of the two react like Ginny had. Then Hermione lowered her head and began to weep openly, loud, heart-wrenching sobs.
Looking through a small space between the feathers pressed against him, he saw the Aurors closest to them fall, speared cleanly through on long black shadows.
Even Hermione's attitude had surprised her, but the twins surprised her most of all. When had they gotten wise? She felt like a little kid next to them and that was strange. She usually felt so much older than them.
Seraphim's head lifted curiously at the Gryffindor's reaction. Ever since he had woken up here, the Gryffindor had never really shown fear, but he was obviously uncomfortable now. He smirked a little at that. Maybe the girl was right. Maybe the hated jacket would make people stay away from him.
"You were not informed about the adoption?" Severus questioned curiously, lifting an eyebrow at his son.
Lucius continued to smile as nine more Death Eaters appeared out of the darkness, cutting off every avenue of escape. The twins stiffened upon seeing Ginny, Ron, and Luna hanging in the arms of three masked Death Eaters. Wands were pointed firmly at their exposed throats.
Morning sunshine poured down onto his face through a hole in the roof, the sun beams perceptible in all the dust. From far away he could hear groans as the rubble shifted. Neville was terrified that this was a new kind of torture. They were going to come for him. They were going to hurt him so bad. Was this his fault? Had he made this mess? Hyperventilating, whimpering, he began to struggle free of whatever was pinning him down.
"What options?" Shadow rasped, despair in his eyes. "Just… I need a minute. Okay?" He stood and tried to pull away, but Draco held his shoulders firmly. He scowled lightly, too tired for anything else, but was shocked when Draco pulled him in for a kiss.
Severus turned on the blond, the light of his Lumos charm making Draco seem like a bloodless ghost, he was so pale. "Do enlighten me," he grated.
To Seraphim, he was manageable while sitting down, but standing, the Gryffindor became a much stronger threat. "Shut up!" Seraphim lashed out, kicking the teen hard in the stomach.
The barkeep seemed unimpressed with the display and turned his attention to the curly-haired teen. Shadow said nothing, but he continued to stare at the man. He sat on a stool, his school bag at his feet. His wand wasn't in sight. The barkeep was about to bark at them to get out of his bar when Shadow absentmindedly brushed a few curls off his forehead, allowing light to briefly touch his eyes.
"So what does it mean now that the two merged?" Draco asked faintly. He stared at his best friend's stricken face and was hyperaware that he was the reason Boy and Demon were now inseparably one.
And just as quickly he was back. His chest and hips ached horribly. He had the sudden feeling that his arms and legs were too long. He knew with certainty that if he tried to walk, he'd only fall over. Biting his lip, he opened his eyes. Severus was leaning over him, his dark eyes practically radiating worry, but then the man gasped with something like shock.
"I figured you could hold your own," Shadow responded with a smile. To apologize, he offered Neville his cake. The Gryffindor accepted it. Draco scowled at that, but Shadow ignored him. "I can't believe Remus is married."
"Draco, no, it's not safe," he cried out weakly. He got to the hallway and raced for the stairs, only to see that Severus and Draco were already halfway up it. Seraphim held the knife out before them and they froze.
"It's the month of January. There are twelve months in the year and four seasons: Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall. Spring and Summer are warm. The sun shines and it gets hot."
There was a thump and a sizzling sound. Seraphim had jerked out of the way just in time as the man fired his taser gun. His vision was coming back in splotches, and Seraphim saw the electric sparks coming from the pronged weapon now embedded in the kitchen door. He snarled. The man paled and stepped fearfully back, his club held tightly in his hand.
"I wondered that myself." Severus hooked his hair behind his ear and leaned back, crossing his legs thoughtfully. "I spoke to Salazar and we theorize that because Demon was born from Voldemort he felt the Dark Lord's death. The shock of it rendered him unconscious, so to speak."
With a hoarse cry, Draco let his arm fall completely. A horrible scream pierced the air as the fang plunged into the inky darkness within the locket. Draco was flung off his feet. He collapsed onto his side. The Dark magic tattered and evaporated as if it had never been, leaving Draco shaking and horrified at how close he'd come to succumbing to Voldemort and betraying Shadow.
His amusement faded as he realized that wherever Voldemort lingered, his son wouldn't be far behind. Under no circumstances would he allow Shadow to face his destiny alone. Silently, Severus moved quickly across the grounds.
Chewing over all these problems - trying to predict what they meant for the future and weigh all the potential ramifications to himself - Harry settled deep within his Occlumency shields to think. As he did so, he worked to camouflage the deep hole in his mind and set mental boobytraps for anyone who might break in his mind and go looking where they shouldn't. The barriers might even help keep Demon and Boy from rising up out of the darkness.
“Perhaps, but now is not the time to consider such things." Severus reached forward and tugged Shadow's hand until the teenager was sitting again. "We are in too much danger during the war to contemplate a move that may render you vulnerable. How are you and Draco? I am aware that your relationship seems to have deepened. Not to mention the fact I found you curled up in his lap last week when we first arrived at Hogwarts."
"No," Seraphim answered thickly. His belly was full, he was warm, and now he felt very sleepy. He forced his eyes open and took Draco by the wrist.
"Fine. Don't believe me, you ungrateful bastard," Salazar hissed and disappeared without another word.
"Yes! Merlin, yes, just stop!" Neville screamed, covering his ears. "Yes. It bothered me. I'm sorry! I'm sorry!"
"He's been annoyed, disappointed, and worried, but I only ever remember one time when he got angry."
"No. I just need a quick word.” Septima smiled at him. Despite the mystery surrounding the teen, she could see why Minerva was so attached. The boy was needy in an indefinable way. It called to her maternal instincts.
One was used to resurrect the Dark Lord this summer after Demon destroyed him in the cemetery. Severus suspected it was the Gaunt family ring that was used, since the ring was missing from the Gaunt hut and the defenses had been professionally dismantled.
Harry nodded. "I'm ready." The plan was simple. He would bluff his way out of Gringotts. They weren't after Harry Potter, after all. Severus would stick to him like glue, safe under the cloak. Once they were outside, they'd Apparate back to Grimmauld Place. He straightened his spine and studied the large chamber. The ground slopped gently upward to the left, so he turned that way.
Shadow gasped as slight pain flashed through him, grounded him. Then Draco's mouth was soothing his bitten lip, his tongue slipping into the opening he had presented and brushing across his palate. Shivering, Shadow moaned and clutched at Draco's shoulders desperately hard. Draco's free arm slid around his back and down to his waist, yanking their hips together. They shared a groan and Shadow sucked hard on Draco's tongue as the blond's fingers dug into his hip, sparks of pain and pleasure sizzling, making his toes curl.
Mr. Weasley had been moved to the Dai Llewellyn ward up on the first floor. Green-robed Healers hurried about as they walked down the corridor. The clamor of the injured and deformed from the lobby cut off and the sudden silence, punctured by soft murmurs, pain-filled moans, and distant wailing was very disturbing in comparison. They climbed a staircase up to the first floor marked for Creature-Induced Injuries. They walked along until they came to room 109.
"Yes. Well done, indeed," Severus sneered viciously and spun around with a sharp snap of his robes as he regarded the dead basilisk once more.
He had no idea how he got wherever he now was, but his brother was in that house…. Well, Demon was in that house… Neville wrung his hands fearfully but then shook himself. Harry needed him. He had to go over. There wasn't anyone else here. He had no idea how to contact his teachers. It was up to him. Squaring his shoulders, he crossed the street.
"He's not alone." Fred laughed. "Come on, you guys. Take a breath. Things aren't life or death here. Shadow has a father, lives with both Padfoot and Moony, has a brother, and has a very cunning Slytherin best friend in Malfoy. And trust me, Blondie would do anything for Shadow. He'd kill to protect him. That ruthlessness that you look down on, Ronnie-kins, will guard Shadow well, don't ya think?" He winked.
Severus nodded and went upstairs. Black was sleeping beside the Wolf. He looked unharmed, but Lupin was feverish and whimpering even though he was unconscious. Scowling, the Potions Master placed several bottles on the nightstand. Last night marked the last the Wolf would change this month, so he could use the healing draughts that hadn’t been practical before now.
"The seizures affect your mind.” Draco shrugged. He didn't fully understand the concept. "After the first seizure, Boy came Out."
The face morphed into Rowena Ravenclaw's. "Hogwarts is more than bricks and mortar; where is the love of learning?"
"Maybe not, but maybe we can even the field. Give you some options," Shadow returned hotly. He remembered all the instances in his life where he'd been at the mercy of abusers. He knew what that was like. He may not be able to physically stop Carrow, but the emotional and psychological trauma was what caused the real damage not the physical attacks.
Neville jerked awake with a startled scream as something heavy fell on top of him, a sharp crack almost deafening him. He flung his hand out and touched his lamp, making light flare inside his room. Eyes as round as saucers, he stared down at his brother, who lay panting, his strange eyes half-closed.
Draco felt his mind focus, his emotions dull. It was like going cold but not like ice. It was more like cold lightning. His senses were acute, his awareness almost painfully sharp, he was practically vibrating with energy.
Draco stood tall and regal, his face frozen with disdain. "Last I recall, Warrington, you're blood isn't all that pure yourself. Don't you have a Mudblood grandmother?"
"Sex is abhorrent to you. It's not just Lockhart," Severus spoke slowly, clearly. He had to press home his point now or there would be no getting through to his very stubborn son. "In fact, I bet you don't even see Lockhart in these dreams. You merely relate the sensation to him."
"Neither is the Dark Lord.” Salazar smirked. "We are all aware that Shadow has a seascape to represent his mental terrain, right? Well, Shadow's Occlumency shields take the form of opaque/mirrored glass. Like an exhibit at the zoo. I must add that I'm impressed with their strength. I've never seen shields stronger."
"I'll consider the matter," Severus said and waved that issue away. "Seraphim has risen to the surface and is staying in that empty house. I want you to keep your eye on him."
