“Neither did I”, Harry replied, only realizing how stupid he sounded after the words had already left his mouth. They both shared a hearty laughter, still pressing their now half naked bodies together. This was when the mood started changing again and Harry felt heat floating through his body once again. His lips automatically found Draco’s in less than a second, as if they were waiting for him and he felt this unstillable desire growing from his groin again. His hands were all over the now naked upper body, touching every inch, caressing, lightly scratching, being encouraged by the most delicious muffled little groans leaving Draco’s mouth and entering his as they could not break apart for any second.
His weary eyes search for the other man’s gaze and when they lock for a second, Harry wonders if Malfoy had always had grey eyes. There was not a hint of blue in them. Just plain grey with a few darker spots. Currently, those eyes were dominated by the dark brows above them, curved in a mixture of confusion and amusement.
Harry got more and more comfortable while listening to Draco babble about each hair colour, fashion choice and nonsense concerning the photographs. He even stretched a bit on the couch while Astoria was serving some tea. Time seemed to fly by and he noticed that he enjoyed spending time with Draco like this even more than meeting up in a bar. But the other guy would not have been in Slytherin for good if he didn’t somehow sense Harry’s train of thoughts.
Harry blinked. Once. Twice. And then wished he had something like a big heavy iron pan next to him so he could hit himself onto his very stupid head where his malfunctioning brain was sitting. By Merlin, what had he done?
Again, shaking head.
When he thought he fell in love for the first time, he did not even wonder it felt different to the descriptions of his friends. Everything had been different for him so that should be normal right? He was still in love with Cho even though his heart was not racing or he was not constantly thinking about her, right? The relationship with Ginny had to be different as well because all of they had been through, didn’t it?
“If you see him like this you really have to wonder how he ever stood a chance at picking someone up,” Daphne carelessly mentioned, watching Draco from above her sunglasses. He was currently trying to get into a comfortable position without exposing any part of his skin to the sunlight. It was a struggle.
That was a reaction he definitely had not expected. Harry starred at the Howler ripping itself into tiny shreds and still could not believe what had happened. Draco was not happy about the chance. He did not thank Harry for the chance but rather insult him. Draco was so ungrateful!
He could feel the heat and euphoria leaving his body, opening space to a cold, heavy weight in his chest. His eyes were searching for the exit, he had to get some fresh air, to get his head free. Suddenly breathing had become quite hard and he decided to go outside without looking at Draco a second time.
Encouraged by strong fingertips digging into his skin he let his hand continue the exploration until finally, he spotted a bare patch of delicate skin under his touch. Testing, he moved his fingernails across it. Draco reacted in the most beautiful way as he pulled away his face from the kiss, letting out a sinfully pleased moan, opening his eyes once more.
He tried to find the business card Draco had handed him when they had met for the first time. That seemed to have happened such a long time ago. So much had changed first. He finally found it, two rubber band wrapped around it and a paperclip holding it in place. He had decided to keep it after their meeting, just in case.
He really was not an expert when it came to dating but even he knew, he had not made what one would consider a good impression so far therefore he attacked what he was most afraid of head over heels next. Smalltalk.
Dancing on the other hand was Astoria’s domain. As soon as the music started to resemble anything she might like in the slightest way she was already on her way onto the dance floor, happily pulling Harry with her. It seemed to him as if she was more than glad to finally have someone who was willing to dance with her.
Nobody in the whole Weasley tribe had even wondered when after about half a year she had announced to start working again. Nobody in the Ministry even dared to say a word against her returning to work part time or the fact that sometimes she would bring Hugo with her. You did not mess with the second in command in the Department of International Magical Cooporation. At the age of 23 Hermione had already outstripped every expectation the Wizarding World could have of her and she was still going strong. The whispers of her soon becoming the next Minister of Magic grew louder ever day but she had already emphasized she would not commit to such a time-consuming job now. Now it was time to have a family.
He had no intention to proclaim such a thing. He would have never thought his attempt to help Draco could be misunderstood in any way. Of course, Ron had to be joking right. Unfortunately, his best friend looked at him with this one serious expression on his face he had scarcely seen in the 13 years they had known each other by now. Ron was not making jokes at all.
“Well, someday someone had to find out. It is true. When settling for pink hair I was in desperate need for inspiration on how to live up my looks to my hair and this is when I found the incredible fabulous Magnus Bane, a queer character depicted as so comfortable in his skin and so elegant, I decided to copy a few of his defining looks and traits.”
Harry Potter is infamous for being wrong about certain assumptions concerning his private life. One very prominent example was him trying to find his Happily Ever After with Ginny Weasley, which was not her fault at all believe me! He was trying too hard to be something he was not. Another good call would be him really believing he would never fall for someone as extravagant as Draco Malfoy – assuming he was gay at all. But boy was he wrong. If someone had asked Harry why it was the Malfoy heir out of all people (which obviously nobody did because well it was his life in the end, so why question such a personal thing as feelings) he would have struggled to find an answer.
First of all, posters started to appear. They featured a variety of phrases such as: "Draco Malfoy plays for the other team." "The Slytherin prince fancies snakes and not princesses." "Draco Malfoy: from prince to queen." "Instead of skirts Draco Malfoy lifts shirts." Having initially been seen as an attack on the former Death Eater the campaign had not been taken seriously. Then the day came Pansy Parkinson wore
After having said that he took a hearty bite from his falafel and managed to not stain himself to Harry’s utter surprise. Well, not really surprise. Harry knew, he would look different when trying to eat his sandwich. Maybe because he was lacking this utter grace Draco always had, no matter what he was doing.
At first it was only him talking. Soon, he began to brabble and search for words. As always, she helped him out by asking just the right sort of questions. She was so much better at this stuff. After a while he had nothing more to say and starred at the empty space on the kitchen table between them.
Nobody would come to his rescue Harry noticed and gave up. Hoping it would calm him a bit, he finished his drink at once and followed Astoria to the dance floor. He could just stand there for a bit and move his head and then silently go back to his chair. He would not dance.
“I am gay! And I think I am in love.”
He indeed had been frequenting the apartment regularly now instead of meeting up with Draco by himself. Most of the times it still was the latter or his roommate who invited him over but from time to time Harry managed to ask Draco what he was up to on a certain date to find out if he was free. Which he often wasn’t due to self-employment. He however managed to always give our favourite Gryffindor an alternative date - as if he were scared that our dark-haired mess would stop asking to spend time with him.
Astoria took about 10 pictures from different angles. In some they looked serious, in some they pulled faces but in all of them Harry definitely felt good. Today was a good day to take pictures and is was a welcome change to take pictures together with friends instead of having them taken by reporters on formal events, even though he was sure Draco would do an amazing job as well. He had proven that many times for sure. And for a very brief moment pictures of himself at the Ministry Ball flashed before our favourite Gryffindor’s inner eye. He together with Draco, posing for the cameras. Not the real Draco here but the platinum blonde version with the perfect suit designed to impress other people. They would look good together and back at home Draco would put off his glamour and they would look even better, feeling cosy around each other, not needing to pretend they were someone they were not.
That night Harry had a nightmare for the first time in a very long time. He woke up with an aching in his heart he could not explain as the left-over dream pictures started to fade away the minute he awoke. The only thing left was the feeling of missing somebody essential to his life. He vaguely remembered he was dreaming quite a normal dream but seemed to be searching for something, someone. But he could not figure out who it was and the longing for a person that did not exist in his dream reality hurt him so much, he consciously decided to break out of it.
Harry smirked at his godson. Good, he wished dating was this easy, just ask someone if they like your vision of themselves and as soon as they agree they automatically become your significant other. He wondered if Draco would like the idea of himself as Harry saw him. Good looking, charming but a git, something between elegant and absolutely careless, funny and sarcastic, terrifyingly handsome but in a very unique way and quite a mystery. What did he actually know about Draco? About how he really grew up, what changed him so much over the past years, why he went public with being queer but not with his actual looks. The longer he thought about it the clearer it became: Liking Draco Malfoy did not automatically include knowing a lot about him.
What followed after this was a rather cute story of Malfoy trying to kiss Pansy Parkinson and really, really hating it. After that he managed to ‘accidentally’ hold hands with Blaise who after a long winter of sending longing glances across the common room decided it was time to kiss his friend. This time Draco liked it far more. So, they kept kissing until about March when the poor blonde boy caught Zabini holding hands with another girl.
Harry gave him a surprised look and Draco pulled out his phone, showing him the message, he had been reciting almost word by word. Except for the cuss words he had left out and believe me there were plenty of them. Especially in front of Harry’s name.
Currently the gifts wrapped up in black and white fancy wrap were deposed under the wry Christmas tree and looked as much out of place as Draco did in his brand-new clothes helping Molly prepare the drinks while she was wearing her oldest stained apron. Somehow those two seemed to get along just fine. At least this was what Harry assumed when both simultaneously gestured towards him to go away.
Splashing cold water into his face to think about something else than a very handsome pink-haired man between his sheets, Harry critically analysed his own features in the mirror. He had never been a self-observed guy but since he wanted to appear attractive for someone, the time he spent in front of a mirror posing had drastically increased. Draco always looked plain perfect, even if he did not try to (Secretly, Harry was sure that Draco put a rather huge amount of effort into his ‘out-of-bed’ looks – he was quite right but Draco would have never admitted that until much later when Harry finally got the chance to see what a mess his boyfriend really was in the morning and believe me, Draco is not a morning person! And Harry loves him the most when he is a vulnerable, grumpy mess.). He brushed the chaotic bunch of hair out of his face to reveal the famous scar. Retracing the faint lines with his eyes he wondered if he should start hiding it more to ensure it was not a constant reminder for Draco of where they knew each other from.
In the end he thought he had managed the whole asking out thing rather fine. It had taken Harry the whole evening of that day and most of the other day to come up with a breath-taking plan that would surprise even Draco before he admitted to himself that maybe this was not his style at all. This might surprise very few of you but Harry has always been a rather traditional guy. Therefore, he went with what he would like best, meeting at a rather rustic steak house with already pre-ordered menus.
The rumours of Harry actually staying at Hogwarts after they graduation had spread so quickly Headmaster Minerva McGonagall had decided to take matters in her own hands. She decided to go for a tactic which had always worked in the past: tea and a light conversation started, followed by the hard truth directly into someone’s face.
Her hands brushed over his hair and he could hear the smile in her voice. She tried to make it so easy for him, why was he such a coward?
But this was not Malfoy anymore. The guy sitting next to him was Draco, a man who had worked in a gay bar. Who shared a flat with a good friend. Who liked to get take away food and eat it on the couch. Who really tried hard to make Harry feel welcome. The pink-haired, tattooed, freckled and careless Draco of course still was the same person. He was snarling at people, loved to talk about himself and most of the time kept his distance but Harry actually liked that about him.
The letter Lady Imogen - as she referred to herself - had written went on like this quite a while and something so pretentious like an overly excited text about how great he was written with royal blue enchanted ink on what Harry assumed to be hand- made paper would have normally ruin his mood instantly. But this one was different. This one included one of the single best sentences Harry had read this year:
Harry reached for her hand but stopped before they touched. This was were the hard part was starting. He took another deep breath and looked down at their hands almost touching.
A picture of a younger Draco probably taken shortly after their graduation flew by. He had pitch black hair in that one. Even though he did not look bad, the colour made him look even paler than usual. Also, he was skinny in that picture. Not that he was heavy today but the Draco on the picture was scrawny and seemed to be very tired. It was replaced by another one, taken a few months later.
Automatically Harry’s hand reached for the glowing ink, slowly and carefully touching it with his fingerprints. He was surprised it was not hotness he felt but only tender skin and a heart beating so fast, he could almost see it through the skin.
Where Ron and Hermione, Ginny, Molly, the Weasleys were something he shared with the world, his relationship to Andromeda was different. It was somehow more private, something only he had and he treasured it. They had more in common than to be seen at first glance. Both were known with a name to big for them to burden at times of their lives. Both had lost their loved ones and both from time to time fell back in this dark place where grief tried to consume them completely.
“You will know it when you meet someone you are attracted to. It is as simple as that. Do not overthink it. I always thought you Gryffindorks were great at trusting their guts, Potter!”
He moved his head into the direction in which the two witches had been going and Harry’s gaze followed only to discover them a few feet away, dedicatedly chatting about him and Draco as they were constantly looking back at them.
When she had entered the apartment, Astoria was immediately running towards her, babbling and hugging her while she was still getting the buttons of her jacket undone. Draco had been a bit more reserved at first but given her a big smile when she kissed him on the cheek, not staining his skin with her lipstick. And then it had been Harry’s turn. It should have felt awkward to meet someone whom you barely knew at their homecoming party but somehow it did not. She had looked at him for a second and seemed to be puzzled but then had decided to kiss him on the cheek as well and ask if the delicious smelling food was thanks to him as for sure the other two maniacs had never been capable of preparing a dish that needed more skill than opening a can or boiling noodles. After making sure that she and her “guest” were served drinks, she invited Harry to the table and they had a rather wholesome dinner together where she talked about her travel through Europe. Again, there had been moments, Harry was wondering how exactly he had ended up here but he enjoyed the company of those three way to much to really give a second thought. Which was basically how he had ended up here, in front of the most popular LGTB+ club in Soho at the moment, waiting to go on his first “super gay fun time adventure” as Astoria had called it.
The next Saturday afternoon he spent as he often did, watching over his godson Teddy while Andromeda was busy finishing all the left-over stuff she did not manage to do with a quirky and very much attention seeking six-year-old around. Him playing with the boy had become a regular thing as soon as Teddy turned a year. It had always been something he felt confident doing by himself, something where he did not need Ginny or anyone else. He was good with kids. It was only after the break up that his monthly visits had turned into weekly ones and as much as Andromeda seemed to be thankful for his help, Harry could always see her hidden concern if he was alright.
“I hope you did not expect me to take you anywhere fancy. I thought casual clothing fitted casual lunch.”
As soon as it was gone, he gripped the other man’s neck and pulled him closer into a seated position, their erections rubbing against each other in the most delicious and at the same time unsatisfying manner possible while he playfully tugged at the remaining shirt. For a brief moment he was disappointed when the hungry fingers stopped grabbing the skin at his back until he realized Draco had only stopped touching him in order to get rid of his own shirt.
“Kissed?”
“What really makes me curious is why you decided to come out in a whole press conference. I mean you always mentioned you hated giving interviews. What made you go for this option?”
He loves how perfectly their faces fit together. Like they were made for cosy whispered conversations, feeling each other’s breath tingle on your own skin and he wonders how he managed to live one day on this earth without being able to whisper things to Draco.
Confusion was written all over Harry’s face and his brain really tried to work again but it still felt very cloudy and was screaming “more, more, more of this!” instead of following Draco’s train of thoughts. When kissing someone could be this great, why were people doing anything else at all? When kissing Draco made the world stop and then accelerate the speed by at least five hundred percent, why did anyone not do it? Why did he do anything other in the world when this was the single best thing.
Unsecure about himself and already reconsidering the idea of impressing Draco by dressing up he was nervously playing with his choker when he finally rang the door. Luckily for him it was Daphne who got the door, gave him a short look and nodded in agreement.
Half an hour later Harry was back at their table, staring at the dance floor and still wondering about what Daphne had told him before. Did he somehow force Draco to change his habits? Was it because of him the other man did not dare to behave naturally? He saw the other man approaching the table and tried his best to come up with a witty conversation starter but all he managed was: “Where did you leave the guy you were talking to?”
But Ginny deserved better. She deserved love. And this was what he told her.
Offering him an amused and very flirty half smile was Draco Malfoy himself. But not the usual business one with the bleach blonde hair and his formal attire. It was a very pink haired man in a tailored pants and short sleeved button-down combination looking at him. The tattoos were very visible as well as the piercings in his face.
His name covered one third of the parchment already, the first letter of his last name spelled unnecessarily huge in the elegant handwriting. For a moment the smirk left his face as he noticed they seemed to be back at last names but he had to admit Draco had any reason to distance himself. Maybe his goal should be to send presents as long as it took to be ‘Harry’ once again.
He felt the sweat in his palms when he touched the doorknob to let in a fantastic looking Draco. He was in an oversized white tanktopshirtthing, which showed off more of his chest tattoo than Harry was used to, as well as a black denim jacket and matching pants. Completing his outfit was a giant steaming box of pizza in his hands.
“One step after the other, my boy, first do what you must to show him you mean it and when you figured out all of it you can just bring him here and properly introduce my nephew to me – if you feel like you still should.”
I am sorry it took so long, but I have a hard time letting those two go. Suffer with me through this part and I promise the rest of the story will be all fluff and happiness
Harry almost spit out his tea, eyes wide open. But before he could say anything, she read his mind and continued.
While finishing the delicious food he let his gaze wander and looked at the framed pictures on the opposite wall once again. They seemed to show Astoria together with another girl, as well as different man with bright hair colours. Only after a few seconds Harry noticed all of them were the same guy. With a flick of his wand and a whispered “Accio!” Draco, who of course had noticed him starring, summoned the pictures from the wall to fly closely in front of them so Harry could finally have good look at them.
And his heart began melting.
“Well, it seems as if Robert and Daniel are back together once again, let’s celebrate that with drinks”, Daphne announced just loud enough that the other three could hear her. Astoria grabbed Harry’s wrist and dragged him towards the bar at the centre of the dancing area. How in the world were they supposed to get drinks in this crowded place, he kept wondering? But as soon as they reached their destination, Harry noticed that there in fact was an empty table next to the bar which was clearly reserved for them as a huge “Welcome back, Daphne!” sign covered half a giant chair made from red velvet to resemble a throne.
“You see, it is not only the penetration,” Charlie started, “you can also do a lot of things with your hands and your mouth to pleasure each other. I once dated this beautiful guy who totally got turned on when he was licking my toes-”
He stared at the blank chest, admired the faint traces of lean muscles under the skin, clearly showing of how well built the other man was. It was not that Draco had a perfectly defined upper body, he was indeed rather slim but in good shape, maybe a bit skinny but Harry noticed he quite liked that look. Muscles only where they were definitely needed and obviously used. For a long time, he had imagined how Draco would look like underneath the well fitted clothes but this was way better than he could have ever imagined it.
He ended up sending her into the living room where she happily decorated the table, glad to finally be useful. This left Harry alone with a giant mess of burnt vegetables and a lot of time to think about the situation. He was going to prepare dinner for a strange of whom he did not know more that she was Astoria’s elder sister, had attempted Hogwarts at the same time as himself, was a friend of Pansy Parkinson (He had remembered that himself!) and according to the pictures seemed to favour blond hair on herself.
Draco’s expression changed into utter fear when he turned to her.
Shaking his head with a deep sight he continued reading the article.
Harry can tell by the look in his boyfriend’s eyes that he is absolutely sure Harry does not know what Ostara is and therefore has once again a chance to share his wide Wizard traditions knowledge. Draco loves to brag with the endless collection of useless facts he has collected over the years. Also, he very well has learnt that Harry quite enjoys it when he is giving him little lectures. Mainly because all of them are whispered softly into ears, heads sticking so close together everyone outside is sure, they are sharing a secret.
“Fantasies, hm? How interesting,” the other man said, leaning in closer and licking his lips playfully. “Was it about the tall blond one? Is he your type?”
Not the clumsy one, who did not care about a few spiderwebs or old carpets or used furniture but just live with it because it was comfortable as it was. The one from the papers still idealizing him as the perfect hero of the Wizarding World.
“Glue and fabric! And scissors but you have to get them; I am not allowed to. We have to make the dress for Astoria now so everybody knows she is my girlfriend!”, Teddy explained with an earnest expression on his face, the one only five-year-olds could have while explaining absolutely obvious things to adults who were so silly because they did not get it.
Astoria had written on the small sheet of paper marking a page-long feature in Draco, including all of his fast flings.
“Well, I first suggested I was different than the other boys when I was 13. I remember every bloke in the second-year dorms was fancying Astoria Greengrass at that time when all I could think of was how cute Blaise Zabini looked in his pyjamas…”
Harry read out the rest of the messages while raising an eyebrow as he watched Teddy busily browsing through the closest drawers, obviously searching for something.
Harry went back to the table and handed the food to Draco. But instead of immediately taking the first bite, he continued where he had stopped.
“I hope you like it, it is one of Daphne’s favourites, so you will be having quite a lot of them tonight when we go out,” Draco added after a moment as if this information was nothing. Harry stared at him blankly, needing a few seconds to process. Was that supposed to be an invitation?
And suddenly he realized how hard he was, his groin not pressing against Draco’s directly but still rubbing against the fabric of both pants.
It was a rather chill April evening and Hogwarts was buzzing with life, more and more students returning during the year as the school had officially be reopened for the next term and was already accepting former students who wished to give it a try on their finals. Harry was casually lounging in the Great Hall after having finished his dinner quite some time ago when the new headmaster approached him, two steaming cups of tea in her hands.
But unfortunately, Draco decided otherwise, pulling away and looking around.
“Let’s see then, what you have to top my fabulous pizza, self -ordered and picked up by hand!”
Finally, the delicious skin was revealed and for the first time he could see the whole beauty of the tattoo covering Draco’s whole chest, continuing until it melted into the sleeve covering his left arm. For a second, he froze in the motion, his unconsciousness screaming at him that he had not been prepared to be confronted with what he was expecting to see, the memory of a bathroom and blood appearing in front of his inner eye. But what he saw after letting go of those perfect lips he as soon as possible wanted to kiss again, was not what he had expected at all.
The world had indeed stopped spinning but now it was turning, turning, turning, gaining speed and in its centre, he stood, overwhelmed by the single most magnificent feeling ever. His skin was burning and his hands were shaking while he was searching for the other body, wanting to touch it. He could get a grip on the vest and clung to it as if he would be drowning any moment, as if the only way to get air was through Draco’s mouth.
Harry vaguely remembered that the awful article had mentioned Draco’s profession, calling him something like a healing consultant. Why would anybody refuse to work with him? He mindlessly searched through his kitchen cupboards, a mannerism he had picked up somewhat two years ago.
The soft pink hair glittered in the warm afternoon sun as if it was trying to become the star of a hair conditioner commercial. The individual strands were not all evenly coloured but upon a closer look varied from a rose blond to a deep rosé tone. All in all, it was rather pastel than saturated. The dark eyebrows contrasted harmoniously with the extraordinary hair colour and the pale skin tone. Now that Draco had come a bit closer Harry could even see the faint traces of freckles around the pointy nose.
When it turned eleven and he still hadn’t received a text from Draco Harry decided it would be ok to be curious and ask about how the evening went. In return this time he got a voice message as obviously Draco had a lot to tell and was too lazy to type it.
Oh and did I already mention he announced himself as "Draco Malfoy, last of his name, not willing to pretend he was ever going to date a witch, well-educated wizards of old families with the financial means to fulfil his every wishes as well as stunning looks welcome owl him"?
I am sorry, I am sick...I don't really feel well enough to write
Harry understood the signal, detaching himself from the other man even though he would have loved to continue on the spot but maybe it was more important now to talk.
Her grip around his hand grew stronger, as if to reassure him everything was going to be fine.
“Well, I do not think someone with your questionable taste offers the right amount of fashion sense to accompany dear Harry on a journey to a new identity.”
In the split seconds before their lips met, Harry noticed how different it felt this time, a firm body pressing against his own, soft stubbles rubbing on his cheeks. And the smell, by Merlin, the smell! It made him push closer, leaning in with his whole body. He gripped the man’s head and pulled him closer, opening his lips a bit. This was different than anything he had experienced before. Better. If there was one thing Harry Potter was certain of now, he preferred kissing blokes.
He was rewarded with a playful shoulder-knock once again and looked up into dark grey eyes which obviously showed the other man was impressed as well as touched.
Although still being clearly visible, it had been altered. The hollow eyes of the skull had been filled with colourful flowers Harry did not know and the body of the snake seemed to be crackling, brittle stone. Below it the tattoo continued with a banner featuring the words “
He demonstratively turned around on one heel and went to the kitchen only to return back mere seconds later with three plates and cutlery. Harry (who still felt his cheeks burning because of the thought of naked pictures of Draco) noticed the atmosphere had changed once again and relaxed a but while the two former Slytherins sat down on the couch and started placing food on the plates.
button.
In order to see better he reached for his glasses to clean the lenses with his sleeve but there was nothing in his face. He furled his eyebrows. He did not remember putting his glasses down, that was something he never did when he slept somewhere else than his own home or the Burrow. Why would he do it now?
Andromeda’s hand reached for his, gently brushing over the top of his, encouraging him.
“Hey there, I thought I would simply bring the food today,” Draco greeted him with a playful half smile and shoved the box into Harry’s hands in order to untie his shoes and reveal perfectly fine and elegant black socks. While still starring at his guest Harry realized that his socks were no match to Draco and his inborn elegance as well as they should have talked about food prior to both of them simply going for what they thought would be right.
With this he raised his right arm and gave Harry the chance to look at it closely for the first time. It was covered in fine lines, forming a labyrinth kind of structure. The edges were lighter and the walls became darker the closer they were to his inner lower arm. Where the Dark Mark was. Somehow it had lost almost all of its terror and when Draco turned his arm to enable Harry to inspect it closer up, he could see it as it was. An old scar. Compared to the changes Astoria and Daphne had made on their mark, Draco’s had stayed quite the same. The mark itself was untouched and stood in the centre of the dark labyrinth. Below it Harry could read the now familiar banner.
Daphne was the last one to join them and she only did so after they heard the doorbell ring. Grunting, Draco got up again and managed to somehow get the door. Finally, food. Having a ton of cheesy stuff in his stomach helped Harry to think clearly once again. Obviously, it had been Draco who brought him here, put the glass, the potion and his glasses on the table and had his phone plugged in. That was a lot of nice gestures. Was that a common thing Draco did for all of the guys he met in clubs?
The letter arriving via owl the next day was written with dark black ink on what looked like hand-made parchment and sealed with the Malfoy family emblem. Harry smiled when he read the short snub on how this was family business but not his own. Draco had obviously inherited his writing style from his mother.
It definitely did look like Harry Potter was living here.
Another noise grabbed his attention. It was one of the bedroom doors. With an annoyed grunt a very dishevelled Astoria slurped into the room, a giant bottle of water in her hand. Wearing a gigantic shirt and some pink shorts she flung herself onto the side of the couch Harry had just lifted his feet from and gave away a sound of sheer discomfort, eying the potion’s bottle.
And then there was him. Plain old Harry in his plain old orange shirt with his plain old, worn out jeans and plain old dirty sneakers. His hair was as ruffled as always and he could have sworn he had spotted some leftover sauce somewhere on his face. He felt so underdressed. Had it not been for Draco earlier on he for sure had insisted on a fresh set of clothes. But when Astoria had asked him if this was how he planned on going out, Draco had immediately reacted for him, explaining to her that Harry looked just fine as he was. Needless to say, that once again the heart of the Savour of the Wizarding world had skipped a beat when her heard that but his explanation for that reaction had been the simple fact that he had already drunken three of Draco’s tasty but dangerous cocktails.
Which left Daphne, the one Harry had met last. She was all in all not too different to her sister but instead of dancing she obviously preferred doing shots and playing any kind of bar game be it cards, darts or especially table soccer. Fortunately, she was not as talkative as her sister which always gave Harry the possibility to flee towards her when drunk Astoria would not stop talking. Like in the night a few weeks later when the latter would not stop talking about how this and that would look cute on this and that person.
Here he was, standing in front of his bedroom mirror making stupid faces, starring at himself, uncertain of what to think about that weird guy looking back. Harry tried to imitate the half-smile Draco prominently featured whenever he was flirty and failed terribly. He rather looked like a crazy person trying to act normal than anyone actually seducing someone. How did Draco pull this off?
Astoria tugged at his sleeve and nodded towards her cell she was holding above them.
“This whole date is not going very well, one could say. What would you say if we called it a day? I mean, I have to head back home soon anyway as mother is expecting me at the manor in the morning to prepare everything for my introduction to Theodore.”
Luckily, the place had seats inside and even though the atmosphere could neither be described as romantic or really inviting, somehow, they managed to come at ease rather soon. And when Harry reached over the counter to receive the two falafel-sandwiches, they finally were in the middle of a conversation. One of the good ones. One of those where you never have to think about your next words but simply talk about whatever comes to your mind.
Well Astoria was for sure one of a kind, he thought to himself. A bit pushy but some how quite charming. And it had never happened, that someone he just met texted him simply because they were bored and attempted to engage in small talk. Not that he was good at that. In fact, our Golden boy was quite the opposite of a conversation maker. But why not try something new. If befriending Draco Malfoy did not turn out to be a bad idea, why should getting to know his friends then be?
An artificial cough made him look up from his misery and stare right into the face of Draco. A very different Draco than moments before. His hair was as perfect as before but he was missing his socks and wearing – by Merlin, Godric and Salazar – he was wearing Harry’s hideous grey sweatpants.
Interestingly, Harry noticed he was not as scared as he expected. Indeed, he was rather calm when he told her he was gay. She simply nodded and carelessly mentioned that she had expected same as when Sirius had told her. Harry’s raised eyebrow she read as indicator that he indeed did not know. Therefore, she told him a story about his Godfather he indeed had never heard of.
They in fact had a quite amusing time at lunch together in the comfortable little shop where no one was starring at them. His heart stopped racing and his breath slowed down when he noticed it was still the easiest thing in the world to talk to Draco about anything.
“So,” he finally found his words again, “how did you end up with pink then?”
Forgotten was the other man, the loud music, the flickering, bright lights. There was only grey, eyes deep enough for a storm. Curiosity and insecurity fighting with – desire? Draco looked at him as if he wanted this just as much as he did himself, as if the world had stopped spinning for both of them. And Harry knew he had to take this chance right now, he had to take the risk and make it right, crossing borders, entering new territory.
He had pushed his chair out of the sun and away from them under a bunch of trees and refused to even go near the water. His hair was a messy disaster and his whole body seemed to be covered in a thick layer of sunscreen, making it impossible for Harry to find out how the tattoos on both his arms as well as on his left calf and his right thigh looked like. There were only three things Harry was certain of:
Harry gulped hard before replying.
She looked at him critically, taking in a deep breath. Her eyebrows almost met as if she was really having a hard time trying to find the right words.
This time the answer took a while and he could see Draco on the other end staring at his phone and typing furiously, a self-assured grin on his face while launching in an extravagant chair and drinking way to expensive alcohol.
Draco raised an eyebrow and faced him, an unreadable expression in his eyes. A mixture of amusement, disbelieve and something that turned the grey of his eyes into a stormy, liquid sensation.
“How did you know you were gay, Malfoy?”, he finally managed to ask the man sitting at the other hand of the table. Proudly he noticed that his voice was not shaking anymore. He even managed to look the other man straight into his eyes where his gaze was once again met with something best to be described as playful mischief.
Harry honestly simply did not know what to make of that. In the past he had never received a ‘no’, at least not without an alternative date or activity. Somehow, he had assumed Draco would simply tell him to stop acting weird and simply come over. Which he had not.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well, maybe I should leave.”
“I am still impressed by your encyclopaedic knowledge of Sunday morning cartoons; I only know about this one from Teddy.”
Which they actually do.
“It’s getting colder every day isn’t it?”
Ginny somehow always knew how to handle publicity. She was so much better at it than him. She knew when to appear at an event, what to say, when to pose, touch, kiss, leave. It was her who carefully managed the bits and pieces of information they gave to the press. She announced them dating so it was her duty to inform the press about their break up.
But all this was in the past now. The Wizarding world was finally at peace – as much as it could ever be. Harry had finished his Auror training without having to face off another Dark Lord or anyone equally evil, just some rogue dark mages and witches who still practiced the Dark Arts. They were however shattered across all of Great Britain and not connected to Voldemort at all.
He silently stood up and started searching for the other man.
Did Harry just imagine it or had Malfoy referred to meetings in plural as if this would not be a one-time thing? With a seemingly confused frown he skimmed through the parchment in front of him. It mainly contained the basic paragraphs ensuring both parties that the other one would be bound by magic to not let any piece of information spoken, written or even drawn in their meetings be known to a third party. It also had a section about expanding this disclosure to any kind of owling or texting. And a paragraph about not revealing spells such as Glamours. Interesting, he thought to himself. It was a well-known fact in the wizarding community that Harry from time to time used a Glamour to go out in public without being recognized but normally his disclosures did not mention such a thing.
Slowly our favourite Gryffindor got up and walked past the other man towards the kitchen and without stopping grabbed onto the worn-out waistband of his own pants, loosely clinging onto Draco’s prominent hipbones. He tucked a bit and looked straight up into Draco’s very surprised eyes, their faces only a few inches apart. The other man’s face was indeed flushing be it because of the embarrassment of revealing how insecure he was or how close they suddenly were after over 90 minutes of sitting what felt kilometres apart.
“Draco,” he started, looking the pink-haired man straight into the eyes, “I would have never thought to welcome you in my home as much as I do today. I am eternally grateful Harry has found someone to be with and boy let me tell you I am impressed by the bravery it must have taken you to overcome your past and be part of our family today. You indeed have become a great man I would love to one day call my son-in-law.”
“Harry”, the pink-haired man started all over again, avoid eye contact while brushing back the stubborn strands. His voice had taken a softer tone, almost caressing the name his lips formed but wrapping them into a certain sadness.
Instead, Astoria turned towards Draco with an enormous grin and explained: “If that’s so Harry, you should come around more often and keep us company!”
He knew nothing about himself but that he was rather good at defeating evil wizards. That and Ron constantly nagging him about it led to the decision of becoming an Auror.
Harry took a deep breath, his hands still shaking and then looked her in the eyes:
As soon as little Teddy had heard the phone ring, he brought it to his godfather, eager to know what the girl of his dreams had written. It was only logical for the boy to assume it would be her writing. I mean, except for Hermione sometimes checking in on him and Arthur Weasley forwarding strange videos he assumed to be funny Astoria was the only one frequently texting Harry. While listening to the first message Teddy grinned all over his face, the second one however made him pull a face.
“Also hitch up those sleeves, it would be a shame not to show of those beautiful pictures on your arms,” Molly explained with a very distinct but motherly tone in her voice. Draco returned the smile and rolled up the sleeves of his button down as well as the matching dark blue pullover he was wearing instead of his own.
“After finishing your last year here, you will leave Hogwarts and start your own life. This is not your home anymore, Harry dear. For you it unfortunately is nothing more than a reminiscence of the past, a memorial for people you lost.”
Hermione cackled. She needed a long moment to focus again, wildly gesturing with her hands as if she was having trouble breathing before she took the word.
He had to grin again. Of course, Draco would imply there had to be more presents to come in the future.
Is it true she left you for another man?
Draco insisted on bringing him to the door and when they said goodbye our favourite Gryffindor finally managed to make his house proud and stumble an apology for yesterday. The pink haired man came up with his crooked smile and simply said “Everything was perfectly fine, you enjoyed yourself but next time ask before you kiss someone, ok?” while closing the door behind a very confused Harry who tried to not overthink what he had just heard. Is was not that Draco had told him to never do it again but just to ask next time.
Instead of entering a career straight after finishing school or traveling around the world to find himself, Harry Potter did nothing else in the first year of his new life than renovate the rooms at Grimmauld Place, have regular Sunday evening dinners with the Weasleys and try to have a healthy relationship with his childhood sweetheart Ginny. For the press everything sounded just perfect and if you had asked Harry back then if he were happy, he would have certainly been surprised by your question.
“Oh, Harry my dear, whomever it is, it’s whom your heart chose, not mine. I understand if you don’t want to tell me now but be sure I will accept them.”
“I think eyeliner would suit you very well because your eyes are really beautiful. I have never noticed that they are not plainly grey but have a hint of gold in them.”
It was worse than arguing. His boyfriend and his best friend got along very well. They were both eager to find out if they had finally found a match concerning their knowledge on history nobody else ever cared to listen to.
“Well then, you should take him out shopping, Mr. Super-Stylish-Extravaganza! See how you can save that!”
“Oh, come on! Next you want to convince me, his wife was not the witch of Braemar that has been mentioned in muggle urban legends!”
Draco who had already told Harry quite a few times that being seated next to a baby was the worst thing that could ever happen to him at any kind of dinner, shifted closer towards Hermione and Hugo and offered the little boy a piece of his own vegetables. Hermione curiously lifted one eyebrow as Hugo immediately took the offered food and gave Draco his full attention.
As soon as he managed to open his eyes the burning light that came through the dimmed windows stung in his face and he was in panic. This was definitely not his place. His couch did not smell like new furniture or pinewood and his cushions were not white at all. Also, his blankets all were at least twenty years old and more cosy than stylish. The one covering his legs was dark grey and felt as if it was expensive fabric that had to be handwashed only. Furthermore, he could hear the faint sound of a shower. When he was at home, he was alone. There was no one who would use his bathroom.
They ended up settling down in the living room in order to watch something on the telly. Harry of course had discussed a lot of options what to do as soon as he managed to lure Draco into his house but he decided watching a movie or something would be the safest choice. Sitting down to talk always sounded so dead serious and some of you might remember Harry as not being the best at keeping up an interesting conversation. Playing a game like he did with Teddy hadn’t sounded right either. So, there they were now, watching a movie on the telly, Draco casually lounging on the couch whereas Harry was sitting in his favourite reading chair.
He blinked at her surprised and opened his mouth: “You know? But-how?”
For the at least thousandth time our favourite but right now miserable Gryffindor starred at his phone, opened the messages and tried to come up with anything he could tell Draco that would make everything better. But there was nothing. Frustrated he wanted to put the device away once again when a soft vibration showed a new message had arrived.
He was brought back into reality by a soft pull on his sleeve. Astoria was looking at him and then pointing at the dance floor. By Merlin, she could not be serious! He was not a dancer! Looking around, he noticed, they had already gotten their next round of drinks and he was really starting to feel them. His insides felt, well, warm and fuzzy. He had always been a light weight; how did he assume he would manage to keep up with them? Searching for help, he tried to return to the conversation with Draco. Whispering in his ear would still be better as to dance, even though his stomach felt a bit weird when the other man’s lips almost touched his ears. But Draco was not in his seat anymore. Instead, he had already moved to the dance floor and stirred his head following the beats of the music.
Harry was shaking his head quietly but did not answer which led to Malfoy reformulating his question.
he actually even wanted that.
But inside he felt ruthless. Stressed. Lost.
I am sorry, it has been so long, but I will try to update a tiny part every days this week!
Now Draco cackled himself and explained with a very calm tone: “As long as it makes Harry happy, I love to pretend to be one hell of a sappy Gryffindor for Christmas. Even though it is very impolite to overhear other people’s conversations!”
“Mrs. Weasley, really, it is just a piece of clothing, nothing to worry about Ma’am.”
“If I were you, I would use the chance to eat as long as he is occupied,” he cheerfully explained while Hugo had moved from his hair to exploring the tattoos on Draco’s arms, drawing his fingers along the lines and from then to then looking at the man with big bright eyes.
After the kiss, the other man let go of him pretty soon and left the dance floor with a playful wink. Harry definitely needed a drink now. He fought his way back to the table where he found Draco sitting by himself, staring at him. Still feeling the high of the kisses in his chest, he sat next to him and smiled. Draco leaned in again and asked: “Are you enjoying yourself?”
He took another sip, obviously pleased with himself and the fact, that he perfectly knew, Harry had only understood half of the terms he was using to impress him. The cocktail however did actually taste simply amazing, the Gryffindor had to give him that.
Harry starred at his phone blankly, having trouble realizing what this meant. Draco had feelings for him, he liked him, there was a chance this fantasy of them being together could become true. He felt the gigantic grin on his face growing until it hurt the corners of his mouth. Scarcely did he even notice that he was not scared because of the new development. Hermione would have told him by now that this was because he actually, genuinely had fallen for the other man.
He was still sulking when a few minutes later his phone finally vibrated once again. In disbelief he stared at the message on the screen.
“A Singapore Sling, a cocktail made famous by the Raffles Hotel in Singapore”, he explained with an eyebrow raised in excitement as he always had when he got the chance to show off with his knowledge or skills. “The main ingredients are gin, cherry liquor, Bénédictine and Cointreau mixed together with a hit of grenadine, some fresh lime juice and bitters, shaken with approximately three ice cubes, filtered, filled up with soda and served in a high glass with a single cherry. Well, at least this is how I make it.”
“I actually did, I am sorry. This whole thing between you and me somehow took place in my own head so much I started asking her for advice what to do. But actually, today was the first time I listened to it.”
‘Well, at least I wasn’t wrong about the earring’, Harry thought to himself. Although, the “earring” indeed was not a single, tiny piece of jewellery but at least four on the left and three on the right side. Also, there was some sort of larger earpiece at the very front of Draco’s left ear.
“I am most certainly not going to explain to you once again why I am making that distinction. The witches in MacBeth are based on the covenant in Scotland which exclusively trained females and not on the one that invented broom riding!”
“I already paid for all of it and they have some sort of a no refunds, no changes policy.”
“How do I look?”
Harry knew he did not have to work. He knew people did not expect him to do anything else than rest on his fame and fortune, show his face to the press from time to time and pretend to be the grad Saviour of the Wizarding World. He had never felt like that was enough.
He was not entirely sure if he had just imagined the tiny purring noise Draco made just before leaning in and kissing him with all he had. This time it was different. This time there was no hesitance in the movement. It was pure desire and affection he felt when the other man’s body was pressing against his, at the same time pulling him over so he landed on top, their hips grinding against each other until the friction almost got to intense. They were all hands and lips and tongues and teeth, exploring, desiring, wanting to get closer, to get rid of everything in between them. While his fingers slowly moved from Draco’s cheek to his collarbones, he could feel eager hands pushing under his shirt, desperately trying to lift it up. Grinning against the lips that were still kissing his, he reached up his hands in order to help Draco getting rid of the piece of fabric.
Even if it was meant as a joke Harry could do nothing else but imagine Draco as described. Naked, in his bed, the long limbs stretched out, the blanket only covering a few inches of that gorgeous body. Interestingly, he noticed, his mind decided to censor this fantasy, covering up Draco’s most intimate parts. Still, Harry could feel the effect these thoughts had on him very clearly and therefore he forgot to write back for a while.
In most of them Draco looked straight into the camera but one was different. In both his gaze was fixed upon Harry, a soft expression playing around his eyes and mouth. Something so tender, it almost felt inappropriate to see the other man like this. It was a very intimate look he gave picture Harry. The final piece to the puzzle. Draco looked at him lovestruck. It was there clearly.
Then all over sudden.
“Well, the child already fell into the pound. Let’s see what Hermione could accomplish and talk about how mad your boyfriend is,” Ron continued jokingly. Harry felt the heat rising in his cheeks. He had expected a lot of reactions from his best friend if he would have ever outed himself and admitted he was in love with Draco Malfoy but mischievousness was none of them.
He let his elbows rest on the kitchen counter behind him, looking at her provocatively. He very well knew with mentioning family he hit a nerve. On one or two occasions Andromeda had already turned a bit sentimental and admitted missing her one remaining sister.
Draco grabbed the flask from her hand, drank a bit and then answered her with that snarling sound in his voice Harry had almost been missing the whole evening.
“But I will be free in the evening. How does a comfortable evening at your place sound instead of a formal date which we both not seem to be very good at?”
Ron did not share her doubts as usual. For him that was just the
The cute thing about being five years old is that you can fall utterly in love with the concept of somebody you have never actually met. For him Astoria was this perfect girl with long wavy hair and all those colourful clothes who always smiled and would be the perfect playdate for a rainy afternoon at home. He had even told Harry he would share his secret cookie stash with Astoria if she wanted to swing by. Of course, not the chocolate ones but she could have the oatmeal cookies if she wanted too. Even innocent love has its borders and for Teddy Lupin those were sharing anything chocolate!
“I know Draco is your first male partner,” he started what would turn out to be a conversation Harry would have loved to never have. Especially not with Charlie. Not on Christmas. Not about Draco!
“Are you really sure you want to do that?”, Hermione asked him for the hundredths time. Her left eyebrow was twitching as it always did when she gave him
(there it was again, ‘first’)
He grinned at her and nodded while she approvingly pulled on his shirt, checking the fit and assuring him he actually looked great. He also felt great. Dressing good somehow raised his confidence. For once he did not feel lost in a room and knew he would not mind if anyone gave him their full attention. Today he knew he looked fine and not weird or pitiful. He looked like a version of himself that actually knew what he wanted even though he more considered this a test run of this new Harry to see if he liked it.
Applying gentle pressure to his lower back, Draco directs him onto the backseat, whispering “I hope you like the car. It’s a classic Aston Martin, one of the few Muggle things my family grew fond of. And it is hell a lot of fun to drive – if you want to try out later.”
Andromeda was pacing through the kitchen of Grimaud place restlessly, disbelief shining through her eyes while she let her gaze wander from Harry to his surroundings and back again. They had been here for at least fifteen minutes unable to agree on the topic. This was something he somehow had expected. Stubbornness ran in the Black family. Sirius had not been any different and neither was Teddy. Or Draco. Whom indirectly was the topic of their disagreement.
“So, you stayed at the Manor for the last few days?”, he carefully asked, searching Draco’s face for the tiniest bit of a reaction, wondering if he had missed him as much as he did himself. He really hoped to read some sort of mutual feelings from the way Draco moved his lips while answering.
The rest of the night Draco spent drinking an obscene amount of shots, smiling politely but could not be convinced to talk to Harry about any serious matter anymore. It was as if they had hit an invisible barrier, a wall the pink-haired did not dare to cross or even touch again, as if he had already told Harry too much, been too vulnerable, too human. Luckily for Harry, Astoria managed to keep him quite occupied and therefore stopped him from overthinking. This night was definitely too much for him, the kissing, the revelation, the strange wording.
Since his return to the wizarding world at the age of only 11 the press had always been trying to get as much information from Harry Potter as possible. During the first years it was due to Dumbledore’s authority that he was not run over by reporters wanting interviews. Later, his friends and the Order of the Phoenix helped him hiding from the press and after the war it was Ginny who took over most of the public work for him. Normally he would simply kindly refuse to give any interviews or such a thing at all.
Teddy was currently kneeling in front of a table on the floor, a bright green crayon in his hand and a very proud smile lingering on his face. For the last twenty minutes or so he had been trying to paint Astoria, listening to Harry’s description, asking mindful questions on how long exactly her hair was, what colour her eyes had, how her nose looked like and all in order to do a precise composite sketch so he would recognise her when they finally met. Harry had refused to show him any pictures in order to protect their Glamour secret (and because of the binding contract hindering him to reveal Draco’s secret – as if he even had considered such a shameless thing!) therefore young Teddy Lupin had no other chance as to paint the girl of his dreams.
Merry Christmas to all of you. If you like this little story feel free to also read the main story "Ten reasons not to date Draco Malfoy " to find out how the boys got together. And also let me know what you think about the story, it would mean the world to me :)
Unfortunately, Draco behaved just as usual and there was no hint on his face, that would have given any away any of his feelings so Harry decided he had to dig deeper.
For now, Harry actually was happy with how his life was going. He had found a new friend in Astoria and as long as he could talk to Draco about the sex thing, that was enough. He really liked spending time with both of them, but on a different level. Toria was his friend to chat and laugh and feel comfortable around, Draco however, was fascinating, witty and charming. Harry did not feel any desire to meet someone else in his life. He wondered, if he ever met someone who would make him realize his sexual preferences. It would still take our beloved Golden Boy a few more weeks until he realized what Hermione at this point had already found out while quietly listening to him lionizing about how different Draco was. Of course, the confidentiality pact made sure, Harry did not spill out any kind of information on Draco’s actual looks but still he had plenty of reason to talk about his former rival.
Harry had a hard time imagining how Draco would have looked like as a child. Of course, his hair used to be blond back than as his mother’s and father’s but anything else? Had he already been so put together because his parents had taught him to? Did he run around the house annoying Kreacher while cooking or had he always been this mindful person who calculated their steps beforehand and managed to fit into any environment easily as if it was impossible for him to create disturbance?
Nobody was allowed to go anywhere near her when she did her “magic”. The recipe for the sweet but strong liquor drink was a secret better protected than anything inside Gringotts and still there they were, happily discussing the amount of piment and how to improve the taste even more while from time to time looking into his direction and cackling together. Harry was not ready for this! Draco Malfoy dressed in a decent “I hope your mother likes me”-pullover happily chatting with Molly Weasley in her very own kitchen while they were preparing drinks for the annual Weasley Christmas dinner was too much for him. However, he seemed to be the only one who cared, the others were busy preparing the house for the evening.
Suddenly Harry remembered the rumours that had come up right after he left Hogwarts. There had been a time when the wizarding world was absolutely sure Draco Malfoy would marry this girl. And then he disappeared for almost a year, returning with the news he wanted to start his own business.
The shower stopped and Harry’s panic rose to a whole new level. He almost fell on his face while trying to untangle his feet from the soft blanket. Where were his glasses? He was unquestionably not ready to face someone without them! To his very surprise they had been neatly put on the table next to him together with a huge glass of water and something that seemed to be a hangover potion. Eagerly, he grabbed his glasses as well as the water and jugged it down.
”. Harry could not help himself but stare at it. In a strange way it was almost beautiful. Not knowing what to say or how to react he took the tea from her and looked into her face. She carefully observed him with a cautious smile. Astoria had not even attempted to cover it up. Like a giant scar it was omnipresent. He knew the feeling. Also, he realized that if they really wanted to become friends, him her and … Draco they one day had to talk about this. But not today. Other matters seemed to be more important right now.
Draco consciously brushed a single strand of his hair back and looked down. There it was. This tiny gesture, the moment of insecurity that made Harry’s heart melt. This was the one unspoken thing our favourite Gryffindor seemed to have waited for. He reached for Draco’s chin and carefully grabbed it, eliminating the distance between them again and forcing the other man to look into his eyes.
“And then there is you. He behaves like a freaking saint around you and not once did he try to get into your pants. I don’t get him anymore.”
Harry was brought back into reality by Teddy who explained to him that his pants were ringing. Surprised, Harry rose an eyebrow. Of course, he was carrying his mobile phone with him just in case of an emergency. There were some areas like here on a muggle playground where a message delivered by an owl would definitely cause suspicion so three years ago he had given in to Hermione who had bought him a smart phone. Needless to say, Harry still used the same exact model and it was in perfect condition for its age. He always took care of the things he owned, treating them as if they were irreplaceable. Also, he scarcely used his phone.
“That was very nice of you.”
"Malfoy, am I gay?"
The apartment felt so different compared to his own place. This was one reason he actually preferred spending his days off there. The other one obviously was Draco. Well, not only Draco but all three of them. They somehow managed to live their own live on their terms and they seemed to enjoy it quite much. Harry still could not understand how they managed to hide their true selves from the Wizarding World but it seemed to be something along “having learnt what side of yourself to show in which situation, making people see the version of yourself they would expect”. At least this was what Astoria had told him after a few more drinks.
At this point they obviously had to help Arthur towards his comfortable chair as the alcohol had won. Harry’s face turned into a glowing red lantern by the mere thought of him marrying Draco but again, his boyfriend impressed him by softly touching Arthur’s shoulder and declaring it was an honour to be considered a part of this great home.
A guy about her height with light blond hair and glitter all over his face was approaching her right now, trying to get closer. With a laugh on her face and without letting go of Harry’s hand she went for it and started dancing in his direction, eyes locked on the guys lips, she seductively moved her head. Harry saw the kiss coming way before it actually happened. It looked playful and fun, not as heated as the two guys he had watched before.
Unfortunately, not even Hermione Granger was able to stop the mechanisms of press from working and therefore Harry the Boy Who Was Totally Ashamed Of his Gullibility was delivered the Daily Prophet with his own picture on the front page once again. Next to the snapshot of him looking somewhere thoughtlessly the awful headline screamed for attention. “Salvation for Those Who Do Not Deserve It”. His first instinct was to tear the newspaper into tiny shreds before even reading it but if his past with the press had taught him one thing it was: Know your enemy. So, with a deep breath praying for patience he started reading.
“What are you planning?”, he whispers out of breath and is surprised by how rough his own voice sounds. He did not intend to imply anything but his treacherous body decided to betray him.
And then Draco made the most awesome sound Harry was sure he had ever heard. It was a tiny, low moan, one of those that makes your heart jumps out of your ribcage because you can hear all the desire and affection out of it. And the best part was that he could not only hear it but also feel in in his mouth, the soft vibration of Draco’s throat. They were so close.
He once again was met with a look of pure surprise and a bit of confusion.
“Potter, I darn well know how breathtakingly handsome I look. I mean, what would be the point of dying my hair and suffering endless hours of pain if the result did not turn out to be unbelievable stunning,” while holding what sounded like a lecture on his beauty he pointed onto his tattooed arms, “but thank you for appreciating it. If you want to continue staring at me, I am sure my assistant Miss Greengrass would be glad to sell you an autographed photograph of me. But,” and with that comment he turned his head towards his roommate, “not the naughty stuff, that is only for premium fan club members!”
And just like that meeting Malfoy for drinks to mainly listen to him talk about how he found out he was gay, how his mother somehow always had known and from now and then questions directed towards Harry and concerning what he was attracted to became a regular thing our Golden boy actually really was looking forward to during the week, always wondering, what witty comments or funny stories the other guy had to tell the next time they met.
(not gratitude Harry noticed still grinning in amusement over the pretentious choice of words)
Not even Ginny had used to text him. They all knew, he rarely responded. This was why he was in a hurry to check who had messaged him; it could have been an emergency. In her defence, if you later asked Astoria Greengrass, she would have considered her situation as an emergency that required immediate action. Harry’s brows rose higher and higher while reading through the texts.
He was positive, Draco, son of a high-ranking Death Eater was most certainly not allowed to visit his uncle Sirius to meet the Order of the Phoenix.
place. He clearly is into you! What in Salazar’s name is your stupid problem? And stop complaining about your darn pants, those were your idea! This is even more ridiculous than your idea of always having to smell great and therefore taking a shower after every night out even though I know you are incapable of even standing after a night out! So, get your shit together and either leave the poor guy alone or finally be true to yourself. And don’t you dare texting me before you figured out what this whole thing with Potter is!”
Teddy, sitting opposite of him, had found his own way to contribute to the whole drama. He was eagerly drawing a picture of himself as the idea of having a cousin he did not know personally drove him crazy. Cousin Draco had to know how Teddy looked like. Meanwhile Harry let his gaze switch between the boxes of sweets, the perfume, the ridiculously expensive scarf and the dark pullover he had bought. All things he imagined Draco might like them but was insecure if they were to personal.
And then Draco Malfoy did something that shook the Saviour of the Wizarding World to the very grounds. He winked. At Harry. Playfully. A one-sided smile was still playing around his lips when he looked at Harry. Like they were on the same side and he was trying to assure his former enemy everything was going to be just fine. Just to make this clear: everyone one else in the whole world, be it magical or not would clearly have considered this behaviour flirting. Everyone but Harry who still was so not used to anyone making a move at him that he was just simply confused.
Again, that git managed to get him all wrong. Harry helplessly stared at those thin, bright lips, torn between frustration and desire. Did Draco know how sinful he looked right now; lips slightly parted? Was this part of their usual game or an invitation?
Ron breathed in loudly and put his son aside to place his now free hands into his lap and watch Harry with a raised eyebrow. He seemed to be considering what to say next, as he was licking his lips – something he had the habit of always doing when he wanted to say something important but was insecure of how to express himself without offending people.
Charlie looked at him expectantly, a fatherly smile playing on his lips and Harry wanted nothing more than to die before this situation could get any worse if that was even possible. Which turned out to be just moments later.
Before Harry had the chance to inspect said picture any closer Astoria returned from the open kitchen which was connected to the room, carrying two cups of steaming hot tea. She smiled at Harry, obviously feeling content with herself. He noticed that something had changed about her face. Now he could definitely see the small silver metal ring piercing through her nose. She was wearing her hair up in a bun once again but this time he noticed she had shaved the right side of her head so only short stubbles of hair covered her scalp. The arm she held out the teacup towards Harry featured at least three tattoos. One automatically drew in all his attention. It was the one thing he had been afraid to see on Draco. The constant reminder of their past. The Dark Mark.
“Are you in a hurry or why are you not taking of your coat?”, the other man wanted to know and Harry suddenly noticed he was sitting in the restaurant with his coat and scarf still wrapped around him. He must have overlooked the cloakroom. Without displaying any grace he freed himself of the garments without getting up from his chair and carelessly hung (or better say crumpled) them behind himself on the backrest from where his scarf immediately decided to fall on the floor in between two tables. A bit embarrassed he bend down to reach for it and, of course, hit his head while trying to get back up.
For a short moment he felt this tight insecurity again. Maybe he had misread the signals and Draco was still hiding as much as before. Maybe this was not him showing his true self after all but another strategy of meeting anonymous.
“He is not my boyfriend and after today I think even the tiniest bit of a chance to ever change that is gone because I am Harry Potter, the Prick Who Is To Arrogant To See What He Is Doing,” he mumbled, now letting out a deep breath himself which was quitted by a friendly touch on the shoulder and a nod from a grinning Ron, showing him once again that he was obviously an idiot.
“Care for a drink then, Mr. party saver and master cook?”, Draco asked, a faint hint of seductiveness lingering in his voice. He casually leaned against the kitchen counter, offering one drink with his left hand while taking a sip from his own glass. He was not facing Harry when the other man took the beverage. It was rather sour but has a sweet, alcoholic aftertaste, the dark-haired noticed. Nothing he had ever tried before. He softly licked his lips and searched for Draco’s eyes which now were focusing directly on him. For a quarter of a second a shiver ran down Harry’s spine when his eyes found the dark grey ones. Had they always been carrying so many emotions? He could clearly read the mixture of amusement, interest and something else out of it. A challenge. Quickly, Harry took another sip. Whatever it was, it tasted delicious, like fruits and sugar, a soft bitterness to it. Temptation. Would the taste also linger on Draco’s lips he wondered? As quickly as the grey eyes had found his, they gazed away again. Harry blushed. What was he thinking?
Admitting something is very hard. For example, being wrong. Harry hated admitting that he was wrong, especially towards Hermione. To be fair, she was not good at winning arguments either! Admitting you are afraid of something is even harder. But Harry had managed to even do that a dozen times when talking to Draco. Admitting to yourself that you have a crush on someone you would have never expected turned out to be the hardest thing out of the three for him.
When he finally returned home after hours of people talking to him and hundreds of owls directed to him, telling him how grateful young people were he was one of them and willing to come out, how inspirational he was and how much courage this might have taken him, he was glad to be by himself. What he did not expect was a single text message on his phone from a number whose owner he had missed very much over the past days.
