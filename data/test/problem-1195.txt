Harry looks over and sees the smile on her face, “That you are old man.”
Harry realizing what he said stands up straight, “Right, sorry, I will be right back with some comfy clothing for you.”
Draco and Zeke look at him surprised, “You don’t have a family?” Zeke asks innocently.
Harry shuffles for a moment, “I think it would be easier if I just let you read the forms for yourself Draco.”
They all sit down, Harry insisting that they sit on the couch.
“No, just wondering where you disappeared too.”
Harry walked into the action house, more death eaters had been found, and were for sale as slaves. The ministry thought slavery was the best way to deal with the followers for the Dark Lord.
“I’m sure Jack, I want him.”
Lucius pulls back, “I hear I have a Grandson.”
“May I come through?”
“Harry really, if you want to hug me, ask, if I don’t feel up to it I will let you know, if I want it as well, I will let you know that too.”
“I want you to show us what a kind man you are, and maybe, maybe I may fall back in love with you and will be able to share your bed again, if you’ll have me.”
Harry smiles, “Good, thank you.”
Harry finds himself with an arm full of crying Draco, he holds him making sure to be careful of his back, rubbing gentle circles on his back and rocking ever so slightly trying to calm him, hoping he felt safe.
Harry walks over to the bed and sits next to Zeke, “No my sweet boy, you are such a good boy, I was just mad because some people were telling the world about my private life and it’s no ones business but ours.”
Draco hated what he was about to do, but it had to be done, Harry wouldn’t understand it, but it was for the best, the world needed a hero, and that hero was Harry Potter, Boy-Who-Lived. Draco packed his things and left before Harry could return.
He takes the stairs two at a time, hoping against hope that they are still there, still in their now home, he knew that if the ministry found them, with them no longer being slaves they would still be returned, but unharmed. It was a small relief.
Draco and Zeke move to take some boxes up to their room and Harry reaches out and touches Draco’s arm, “May I check your back again, I want to see if the salve I got would be good for your injuries, please.”
Draco’s eyebrows draw together in his confusion and Harry can’t help but think it’s adorable. “Yes, of course.”
They come downstairs together and walk into the living room, the fear on Draco’s face upon seeing them together makes Harry want to hunt down every single trainer out there and make their deaths slow and painful.
Sitting down at the table he looks down at Zeke, “Will you sit on a chair at the table with me Zeke?”
Draco looks at Narcissa and Harry could practically see the gears turning in his head, “Mother? Where is Father?”
“Shut your trap, you ungrateful piece of trash!”  Jack yelled toward the neighboring cage before giving the bars a hard kick.
When Harry finally did arrive home, it was too late, Draco was gone.  Harry had come home to an empty house, and a broken heart. Harry knew that Draco didn’t support Voldemort, and knew it wasn’t possible for Draco to purposely hurt him, but Harry needed some kind of logical explanation in order to move on with his life. So, he chose to believe the life they shared was a lie to protect Draco’s life.
Harry finds his voice, “Yeah, yeah, they are here, do you want me to go get them?” Harry starts to turn but is called back when Narcissa starts to talk again.
“No worries love, I am right here, I have you, nothing is going to harm you if I have any say in it, you have my word.”
The boy looked up at Harry, his new master, with fearful eyes. “Z-Zeke”
Harry leaves the room and comes back after some time, with some new clothing including new underwear. “Well, I will leave you to it, come out when you are done, we still have a lot of things that needs to be brought up to your room.”
Draco looks at him with that look of pure fear again, “I-I mean, yes I mean of course I am, why wouldn’t I be, you’re not mine, you can do whatever you please, I’m sorry if I had attitude back there really I am.”
Harry had to remind himself that this is just their first day here and they don’t know what to expect yet.
“Maybe a little, but I don’t know why, maybe I’m jealous that you have people, if I had people maybe I wouldn’t be like I am now, but if I had people I also wouldn’t be here with you.”
Harry knows he is going to get really tired of answering questions like this, but he knows he is more than willing to answer them until the day he dies if it makes his family happy.
Harry rolls his eyes as he turns around, he hated the hero worship and the way people fell over themselves to please him, he just hoped that it would come in handy the one and only time he wanted it to.
“What happened?”
Draco whips his head up and looks at him, “Did you need something?”
Hesitantly he puts his hand out placing it on Draco’s arm, “Draco, love wake up, common Draco, you need to wake up for me,” giving his arm a little shake, with no success he tries speaking a little louder “Draco!”
Harry lets out a little giggle at the nervous rambling of his son, “Papa is fine my dear sweet boy.” He sits down across from the boy, giving them a few feet distance just in case.
Harry nods, sighing in relief; “Yes.”
Harry takes an involuntary step forward, wanting to wrap his arms around Draco before he remembers how Draco is right now and takes a step back again, “Sorry, I just wanted to hug you, I didn’t mean to crowd you there for a minute.”
Draco nods as his body relaxes with the relief those words brought. “Who is that?”
Blaise smiles, “No fooling you is there mate!”
“Ron, this is Zeke, my son.”
“Whoa, whoa Draco, it’s Harry remember?”
Harry nods standing up, “Lead the way,” giving her what he hoped looked like a charming smile.
The rest of the meal is silent but at least they were eating, together.
“Yes.”
Ron smiles sadly, “Well, in that case, let me introduce myself, Ronald Weasley, pleasure to meet the man who makes my best mate so happy.”
As Harry pulled out the money he could hear a gasp from another cage but ignored it, Harry counted out the amount and handed it over the Jack, who nodded and handed Harry a leash.
Draco looks up and sees Zeke in the doorway, “Oh baby, come here,” Zeke comes over and is wrapped up in his Daddy’s arms, “such a good boy, thank you for getting help when you thought I needed it.”
“My hands falling asleep and I have to go to the loo.”
“Draco, love, wake up for me.”
“Are you sure Draco?”
Harry places his hand under Draco’s chin and lifts his face up to look him in the eyes, “Draco, I promised I would not touch your son, I just wanted to make sure he wasn’t trained in that way.”
Opening the paper, he groans causing Draco and Zeke to look at him and wonder what happened.
Harry bent down to get a better look at his former lover. He looked into the silver eyes to see fear, from being told off by the trainer, and for possibly losing his child. Harry could see the tears welling up in Draco’s eyes.
“Do you want me to go get them?”
“Yes-yes Master?” Draco looks at him with fear.
“Your friend Ron, he seems like a fine man, I trust that if you trust him, he is a good man, you left our son with him after all.”
“Because for almost two years before the end of that War I won for you people, Draco and I were a couple and I want to have my lover back, he may have returned to me if it weren’t for your slavers, he doesn’t even have the mark!”
Harry cuts him off, “Draco! I said I was not going to hurt you, I was suggesting it in case you wanted it; Draco my love, please, I am not going to do anything you don’t want to do, please.”
She pulls back and looks at him, worried, “I love you too, what brought that on?”
“Of course, Harry, be careful of my back though.”
“Are you sure, he is an unruly little bastard.”
After a few hours Harry and Draco are left alone while Zeke plays in his room, the men having left to return home.
Harry kneels down in front of Draco again, “I know you are, which is why I insisted that you be in my care, I didn’t want you out there somewhere terrified, and I didn’t want some slaver seeing you and thinking you were an escaped slave and hurting you before you get back to the ministry and they realize you are not one anymore. Baby, I love you so much, I just want to help you get back on your feet.”
He nods holding out his hand and tensing at the same time. Harry looks at his hand and sees a bruise forming on the back of his hand and wonders what caused it.
“Of course, he is, he must have been worried when he read the paper this morning.”
Zeke looks over at him confused, “I don’t understand.”
Harry leans against the counter in the bathroom, “Well, I do want you to be comfortable, and I am not trying to make you look sexy, but darling, you could be wearing a burlap sack and I would still think you were the most gorgeous creature that ever walked this earth.”
“Don’t be, not your fault, no matter what you may think, those bastards are sick.”
Draco looks up at him, surprised, “You really meant that?”
“Yes Ma’am,” playfully saluting before running to get home.
Ron and Draco nod.
Draco smiles as he sits up in the bed, “I am going to go check on Zeke and make sure he didn’t wake up alone, alright?”
He steps into the room and sees Zeke sitting cross-legged on the rug, looking up at Harry he gives him a shy smile, “Dad and me were talking, and we decided I should call you Papa, if that makes you happy that is, if you would rather something else we can think of something else, I just, I only ever had dad and now I have you… what?”
Blaise walks over to him and kneels in front of Draco, “Draco, we were good friends, I swear on my life, and on Dennis’s life that I will never ever in a million years harm your child.”
Ron steps through the floo, walking across and sitting next to his friend and brother. “Harry, why didn’t you tell us you found him?”
Zeke pulls out of the hug, “I know Papa.”
“Yes, anything Master, I’ll do or answer anything.” Draco seemed extra eager to please and it made Harry sad to see his once proud lover so broken.
Draco and Zeke moved away from him, and he knew it, but Draco hit a nerve, he wasn’t a saint.
Draco steps aside, “Come in Harry, I guess you should officially meet your son.”
Draco nods.
“Oh right, Mother, this is Zeke, he is our son.”
Narcissa moves and crouches down in front of him and takes both of his hands in hers, “Hello Zeke, I’m your Grandmother, I’m so happy to meet you.”
Draco realizing his son wasn’t in any danger removed himself from the position he was in and crawled over toward his master and kissed his hand in thanks.
“Yeah, sounds good, I’ll go tell Zeke to pick out some pajama’s and I will leave you two to get ready for bed.”
“Draco?”
“Draco, love, someone is here to see you.”
“Why?” Draco asks, suspicion in his tone and posture.
“Yeah, of course dear, I will see you in a little bit, and I will contact my assistant to see if they can get me a list of tutors.”
Harry smiles.
“Yes-yes of course, of course you do, you’re a busy man, an important man, have a seat”
“That means so much, really it does, now, let me finish cleaning up so that we can all go to bed, it’s been a long day, and Zeke is only seven, he needs his sleep.”
Zeke looks from him to his father, back and forth a few times until Draco hesitantly nods and he takes a seat at the table, lightly shaking with fear.
Zeke jumps a little but smiles when he sees it’s just his Papa, “Yes, thank you so much for getting them for me, I didn’t need them though, you and Daddy are all I need.”
They spend the rest of the day unpacking the bags and boxes, eating pizza, and just getting to know one another.
“You can’t Mr. Potter, it’s not that easy!” says the woman, speaking up again.
She nods.
“Do you want to meet your Uncle? One of Papa’s closest friends?”
Harry’s heart breaks a little, “Zeke, you’re such a good boy, I’m going to take my wand out to heal your hand is that okay?”
“Oh, Draco, please you don’t have to be so formal, it’s Harry, just Harry.”
“Okay.”
Harry jumps a little, “Right, this is Ron, my best mate, you were kind of friends before the end of the war, I mean it look almost the two years we were together before you warmed up to one another, but everything that happened between you in school was under the bridge.”
“Yes, come on through, but you don’t need to be so formal.” Harry stands up and moves away from the fireplace so that she can come through, she steps through the floo and brushes off her dress.
“Of course, I did, I am not going to abuse you love.”
“Well, may I hug you, please?”
Harry’s smile quickly fades, “I plan on helping you get well, get you a decent education and get your Dad some counselling to deal with the trauma of training, and maybe get you in to see one as well, maybe go together, but I do need to get you a tutor,” he looks them both over and nearly jumps up from where he is sitting, “I need to get you both new clothing, shoes, anything, do you need anything?”
Zeke sits down on the couch next to his Papa and snuggles close, nervous about what is happening.
“Well, if my memory comes back to me, I am sure I will have some stories to share.”
Harry answers before Draco does, “No, it’s okay, just let me know if you are ever comfortable enough for that, I understand, I’m still an authority figure and I know you don’t have the best past with them.”
Lucius turns and takes in Zeke, “No need to be afraid of me Zeke, I’m your Grandpa, and I’ve mellowed out in my old age, becoming quite the pushover, aren’t I ‘Cissa.”
Draco nods, and Harry could see he was a little weary, but he really needed to get out of the room, away from them before he exploded with the anger, he was keeping in. He quickly walks to the study, closes and locks the door, before putting up a silencing charm, letting out a scream he was keeping in, the books falling from the shelves as his magic lashes out in his fit of rage.
Harry gently wraps his arms around him, holding him close but also softly, not wanting to irritate his back or make him feel crowded. “I do care a great deal for you Draco, I have for ten years, since you showed up on my door asking for help getting away from the Death Eaters.”
“I promise that I will do my best to take care of my health, now you have to promise you won’t abuse your power over us.”
“Okay, Narcissa, come on let’s go see them.”
Draco nods, “Zeke take some things up to the room, I will be up shortly.”
The tall man who was still standing by his side looks to the rest of the council, “All those in favor say aye.”
Harry’s eyes go a wide, “Of course, my dear, you won’t be alone with anyone you don’t trust, or anyone Daddy and I don’t trust.”
Harry goes up the stairs and looks into Draco and Zeke’s bedroom, “Zeke?”
“He is your godfather, and one of the people we lost during the war, I used to hate the man, but he proved to be a good man and I really wish I got to know him in the way that you did, as a caring man who protected the people around him.”
“What? Why?” asks an older woman with red hair with whisps of white throughout, “You hated the young Mr. Malfoy in school why do you wish to free him now?”
The owl takes off and Harry smiles sadly thinking about Hedwig and remembering her fondly.
“I just, I, it’s all new Harry, I’m sorry.”
“Take this letter to Dennis, Jinx,” handing her a treat, “that’s my good girl.”
“Well, your other father.” Harry says from his seat across the coffee table.
“But-but I used wandless magic to prevent you from hearing me, I allowed Zeke to witness that, I certainly deserve it.”
“No, nothing like that love, I just thought since we have company you would want to stay down there with us.”
Blaise smiles, “That’s fair.”
Draco blushes deeply, “Yes, a part of me does, but I also feel that you are doing it because you care deeply for me, it feels like you are not trying to dress me up slutty, but with my training, it’s what I expect.”
Draco and Zeke look confused and fearful, but they open their mouths and wait, not knowing if it is a trick or not, Harry could not help but feel sad for them.
Draco turns his eyes toward Harry and looks at him as if not seeing him, “I promise to be a good slut Master Justin, you don’t need to hurt me, I’ll be good I promise.”
It’s Draco’s turn to be amused, “Harry, we don’t want to be a burden.”
“Draco, dear, it’s okay, I know it’s going to take time, slips happen, no worries love.”
Zeke looks from his Daddy and his Papa before turning back to Narcissa, “I am happy to meet you too.”
Harry helps them to their feet and guides Draco over to the bed, laying down and wrapping his arms around Draco again as he lays a gentle kiss on the top of his head, “You are always welcome to come here Draco, just no sex until we are both sure you are ready.”
“I make you happy?” Draco asks as he turns his attention back to Harry.
“I’m not upset with you.”
After Harry calms down he takes Draco’s swab, running a series of spells it comes back with the same result every time, Draco was part Veela.
Harry smiles sadly, “Trust me Zeke, you will have a better life from this day on, your Daddy and I are going to see too it that you are taken care of and you are not lacking anything that you need.”
“Yes Papa.”
Harry smiles, “That I will accept, but Draco? Promise me you won’t work too hard and promise me that you will take care of your health.”
“Monday, so in like three days.” Harry laughs, “but maybe you should meet him now, Ron’s out there too.”
“I-I was- I was cleaning and-and I was- I was looking under the sink and taking things out to reorganize, because it was messy, and, and I placed a heavy bottle on the counter when I was running out of room on the floor beside me, and-and it fell on my hand, I-I tried to be quiet I did, I didn’t mean to make noise, really I didn’t, I’m sorry.”
Zeke looks to his Dad, “Should I Dad? I don’t know if I want too,” he looks away a little fearfully.
Zeke nods and stands up, ready to follow Harry.
“Yeah this is perfect, thank Merlin I have some healing background from the war, that and I called Neville, he’s a healer now, he was helpful,” there was a fond smile on his face and Draco wondered if Neville was just a friend or was he more at one point, was he jealous?
“He did, even though I told him not to, so what if I’ve been out of work for a little over a month, that’s no excuse to try to pawn me off on his boss.”
Harry laughs, “Even like this you are a through and through Slytherin,” at his confused look he adds, “self-preservation is one of the top attributes of Slytherin, that and ambition.”
“Oh, what can I do for you, why are you calling?”
Harry takes a couple bites before noticing that Draco and Zeke are not eating and almost hits himself for his own stupidity, “Oh my dear, I’m sorry, please eat with me.”
Harry turns back and sits down in front of the fireplace. “Yes, it’s true.”
Harry stood up, trying to keep his tone light, but knowing he is talking through clenched teeth, “Draco love, you and Zeke eat breakfast, I’m going to my study.”
“Where is Lucius?”
Draco brings over the food and sits across from Harry, watching him carefully.
“Right, first things first, I am not their Master, I am just trying to keep them safe, secondly, I would have fought for them if I knew where they were.” Harry had no idea where those words came from but sitting there, being watched by Draco’s parents made him suddenly feel defensive.
They pick up their forks and Harry can see the light tremble as they take their first bites, watching him as they chew and swallow.
“No, I don’t know if I am ready, I don’t know if I can take seeing him like that, after 8 years it is going to be hard, isn’t it?”
It doesn’t take long for the young woman to come back, “They are between appointments, the whole council will see you, the next appointment can wait.”
Harry sighs, “It’s okay Draco, you were not told not to do it so you are welcome to it, this is your home as well; did you cook enough for you and Zeke?”
Draco’s eyes flutter open and for a moment upon seeing Harry there is a moment of panic until he remembers the night before, “Yes Harry?”
Again, Harry watches as Draco is wrapped in the arms of one of his parents as they hold each other and sob.
“Oh, so you’re not mad at me?”
Harry looks at Draco with shock, “Zeke is cleaning the bathroom?”
The next morning Harry wakes up with his hand falling asleep, the weight of Draco’s head on his arm, if it weren’t for the tingling in his hand he would have to say this was the best morning he has had in eight years.
“Well, right, I need to go shopping.”
“No, sorry, the name doesn’t sound familiar.”
“I couldn’t, not yet, he was a slave Ron,” he hiccoughs as he feels the tears start again, “he was pregnant, I have a son and I just, I couldn’t, I just couldn’t tell you, anyone.”
Draco nods and smiles, “Yes, Zeke is sitting with Harry.”
Harry and Zeke make their way down the stairs and meet with Ron and Draco who were talking to one another happily. Ron and Draco turn when they hear them come into the room with them.
He reaches out and she hesitantly takes his hand before she is lead out of the study and lead into the living room.
Draco stands up and turns around, when his eyes land on his mother Harry can see the recognition on his face, and he is relieved, but he can’t help the little bit of jealousy from creeping in as well.
Harry looks up and sees the sad expression on everyone’s face and sees how Draco looks like he is feeling like a failure.
Harry smiles at him in the mirror, “You don’t have to thank me, I do this because I love you and I want to see you happy and healthy.”
Harry knew he wasn’t trying to rile him up, but at those words he couldn’t help it, he felt offended, “I was there looking for you! You left me in case you forgot that in the past few minutes! I wanted to find you and make sure you were OKAY!”
Harry nods as he places his head on Ron’s shoulder, “Where is ‘Mione and the kids?”
Draco bites his lip and looks back at his son, “He-he is- he is seven Master, he is only seven.” Harry could see Draco’s eyes water as he looks back at him.
“I am nice to you and your Daddy because I love you both so much, it makes me happy to see you happy so I want to make sure that you are both so happy because it means I am doing my job as your Papa.”
“You can spoil us, but you have to let us do something for you.”
Harry and Draco are interrupted by Jinx tapping at the window, it’s been so long Harry forgot he had even sent her out, standing up he goes to the window and lets her jump onto his arm, taking the letter from her leg. “That’s my good girl, go down to the living room and see if Ron will get you a treat.” Jinx’s leaves the room and Harry laughs knowing Ron will give her a treat thinking he is spoiling her without Harry knowing.
“Thank you, Harry.”
“What’s your name little one?”
Draco turns confused eyes on him, looking him over before recognition crosses his face and he looks around the room, “Harry?”
“Okay, you need to take this stuff and try it on, anything that doesn’t fit we can return it, no worries about that, anything that you don’t like same deal, don’t accept something just because I give it to you, I think I have Draco figured out but wasn’t sure what Zeke would like, so got a lot of everything.” He idly motions toward the pile in front of him.
“So, your family is out there wondering what set you off?”
“Oh, thank goodness you’re here.” When she notices that Harry is not going to respond she continues, “I read in the paper that you have Draco there, and, and that we have a grandchild.”
“Thank you, Papa.”
Walking into the room he sees Zeke playing with some toy cars and smiles, “Do you like your toys?”
Harry stands up and walks out of the room before coming back with a tape measure, “I am going to take some measurements and get some robes for you both, and that will give me an idea of size for you both.”
“Nephew? I thought you were just friends?”
“For you, and for Draco, yes, when do you need me to start?”
Draco sighs, “Harry, I don’t remember what we had, but I assume if I loved you at one point it means you have something in you that was good for me, I don’t know why I left, I wish I did, that scares me a little, I don’t know if there is something dark in you that I’m not seeing, but since my, our, son and I are forced to live here even though we are no longer slaves I am going to have to trust that you will not abuse what power you still have over us.”
“Harry, may I stay here, I-I just want you to hold me, please?”
“I appreciate you not wanting to be formal, but you are still the guardian over my son and keeping you in my good graces is beneficial for everyone involved.”
“No!! Please no, sir, please, not my son, please.”
“I see, you did so well for me Draco, such a good boy for me.” Harry didn’t know where that came from but seeing the tears dry up and be replaced with such joy and pride made his heart sing.
“I hope so too, but I know if the worst happens Zeke has you now and you will not let anything bad happen to him.”
Getting out of bed Harry pads across the room and opens it to see Draco shaking with fear, “I know I’ve done a lot that warrants punishment, please, I’m begging you make it quick before Zeke notices I’m gone.”
Harry walks into the Ministry, walking past everyone, not even acknowledging the people trying to say ‘hello’ to him, he was on a mission and he didn’t have time for this.
“If you are her’s why are you not allowed in London?” Harry didn’t understand how the slavers worked and every day back with his family made that painfully obvious to him.
Harry applied the salve to Draco’s back, while ignoring the tenseness and the flinching that the contact caused, Draco needed it and it wasn’t like he could do it himself. He took his time and made sure never to press down too firm on the welts and bruises.
Draco visibly calms down again, “Sorry, just with everything, he went to his room, I made him eat first, but I think he thinks he did something wrong.”
Zeke turns and looks at Harry, “Papa, I’m sorry, am I supposed to be saying something, I don’t know what to do, I’m scared.”
The next day Harry is sitting in his Study catching up on some mail, while his family are in the living room while Zeke learns his letters with Draco’s help.
Zeke smiles, “That’s good, I think I love you too Papa.”
Harry shakes his head as his anger flares to life in his chest, trying and failing to hide it as he puts his hands up for Draco to stop, causing him to flinch away from his Master. His back hitting the bottom banister of the stairs making him hiss in pain, Harry would have to look at that once they finish speaking.
Harry runs his hand over his face, noticing his hand come back wet, just noticing the tears that still stung his eyes.
Draco nods “Thank you Master,” taking more food out and getting to work.
“I don’t know who that is.”
They all look to one another one last time before they all agree and say “Aye!” in unison.
Ron watches the exchange with a smile on his face, he has never seen Harry this happy, at least not since the war ended.
“You walked away from me the day of the final battle.”
Harry practically runs for the apparition point, desperate to get home when he hears the familiar voice of Hermione calling out to him. He turns around to see his very pregnant best friend, on her third child now with his other best friend Ron Weasley.
Harry takes out his wand and make quick work of healing Zeke’s hand, and is sad to see that Zeke is surprised that it’s actually been healed.
“That is not comforting.”
“Oh, right, of course.”
“Mother?”
Zeke puts the box down that he is carrying, “You do look nice Daddy, I’ve never seen you in anything that nice, you look comfy.”
“Hello?”
“Whoa, love, sit down, Blaise is going to be his tutor, remember schoolwork, we talked about this.”
“Where are your kids?”
Draco nods, “Who left who?”
Reluctantly he gets out of the bed and gets dressed in robes, he has a lot to do today but first he had to go spend some time with his family.
“I think it’s about time to apply the salve.”
Harry goes down to his study and takes Zeke’s swab, taking out a book on wizarding heritage he finds the spell he is looking for. He casts the spell on the swab and on a strand of his hair, Harry falls back into his office chair and lets out a strained sob, the boy was his, he sits there and cries for some time unable to stop himself.
“Good, I will be just upstairs if you need me just yell okay?”
“Thank you, Harry.”
Draco nods, “Thank you Master, I understand that you want to be the only one to punish us.”
“Why?” Zeke looks at Harry in awe.
Zeke looks up, “I don’t have to though, right?”
Draco nods and moves slowly toward the stairs before bolting up the steps, Harry can hear the door shut and he lets out a breath he didn’t know he was holding.
Draco lowers his head, shoulders slumping, as he answers, “He’s been hit Master, beaten even, but no one has used him sexually, they wanted to preserve his virginity, but they made him watch as I was used Master, he is aware how it works.”
Draco looks up at him with confusion, “How are you so patient with me?”
“Yeah, my veela part of me has latched on to you, I am surprised I was even able to leave you at all if my veela side sees you as its mate.”
“Draco, come sit down with us, there is something that I would like to talk to you both about.”
“Goodnight”
“Draco, you’re not going anywhere, you are mine and I am not having you go anywhere without me, or Zeke, go back to bed my dear sweet pet.”
“I do promise not to abuse you, either of you.”
Draco is shaking a little when Harry places his hand on his arm, and Blaise has paled a little, his dark complexion turning ashy.
Harry hates himself but he needs to praise him for the small act of sitting at the table as he was asked, “Good boy Zeke, you are doing so well.”
“If it would please you to see me in it, yes.” Draco suddenly becoming nervous made Harry wonder what he was thinking.
Harry stands up and helps Draco to his feet, leading them to the main level bathroom, Draco stripping and placing his clothing on the sink vanity in front of him again.
Draco looks at Harry for a moment before throwing his arms around his mother.
“Draco, I want things to go slowly, I don’t want to jump into anything too quickly, I just want us to get to know one another again and for us to just take care of Zeke together. I am going to start looking for a tutor for him in the morning.”
What shocked him was Lucius responding to him. “Harry, we know what a good man you are, we really do, you made sure Narcissa was free, and since I am her husband she was given the option to take me home with her, I was in one of those facilities that Draco was in, trust me when I say thank you for being there for our boy and thank you for fighting for my wife’s freedom.”
“Goodnight Harry.”
“Calm down little one, I happen to like the name Zeke, you can answer any question I ask, don’t be afraid of me, I won’t harm you. I promise.” Harry turned his attention to his ex-lover, “I already know your name. We went to school together.”
“Of course, you do, you don’t pine for someone for eight years and not be happy to find them.”
“Harry, I want to love you too, I’m just scared.”
Draco steps out of the hug and looks at Harry with curiosity, “I sought you out?”
She looks up about to argue when she sees the face of the hero of the Wizarding world and could clearly see that he was not happy, “Umm-Yeah, yes, right away, I just, well, I just need to make sure someone is available, please take a seat Mr. Potter, I will be right back with an estimate or to escort you to someone.” The more she talked the more she blushed, clearly aware that she was stammering and tripping over her words.
“But it is that easy to take a man off the street, who is pregnant, not bother running a paternity test on the child and assuming that they supported the dark lord even though they have no mark and have not been seen for two years!”
They go into the bathroom and again Draco strips and turns away from Harry, but this time sees the pure horror in the mirror when he’s turned away.
“Of course, Harry, I think it would be best to get things going as quickly as possible with his education. You truly are a wonderful man Harry.”
“Papa, why are you so nice to us?”
“Yes Harry?”
“Draco, has anyone ever touched Zeke?”
Four years after graduation found Harry and Draco living together secretly, while Harry continued to fight in a war which began before he was born. No one knew of the relationship the two shared, and no one ever could; who would want to follow a hero sleeping with a death eater? The Wizarding world wouldn’t like it one bit, even though Draco no longer supported Voldemort.
‘No point beating around the bush’ he thinks to himself before stating his reason for being here. “I want Draco Malfoy and his son Zeke released from their slavery and into my custody since I know full well that after the training, they are not fit to fend for themselves.”
Draco rolled his eyes. ‘Let's not exaggerate. Portable music is all good and proper but it’s hardly
Harry knew how that felt. ‘Fuck the obligations. Fuck the motherfucking rules.’
‘You know what. You won’t say a word to me. Is it because I touched your precious hair in the morning?’ Draco seemed furious and maybe even a little hurt.
‘Are they Gryffindor?’
Draco set his glass down. ‘Nothing serious. Did you?’
‘This was spectacular,’ Harry whispered, a boneless heap in Draco’s arms. Drops of water from the turned-off shower head punctuated their breathing. Steam curled around the room, wrapping them in warm mist. It could have been a dream.
‘They let something slip, my Lord,’ Dolohov whispered. ‘The Malfoy boy said they were going to France.’
There’s no question of Draco sleeping elsewhere, he needs to keep an eye on him. Heat and touch and salt, and he’ll be as right as rain. Changing into his night clothes and slipping under the covers, Draco hugs him, pressing Potter’s back to his chest.
Harry’s friends made trouble: Neville and Ginny and Seamus, Lavender and Parvati and Colin, Ernie and Terry and Susan; they tried to make a difference, attempted to stand up to the torture, and Harry felt so
Galleons. You don’t understand how priceless this is, Mr Malfoy. Besides its powers, its historical significance is immense. Its origin is lost in time, made in the valleys of Shaanxi by witches that could bring down the sky. Kingdoms fought over it; kingdoms which have since crumbled to dust, their names forgotten. But this still exists, and it was found in an old crone’s home after her death in Chippenham of all places!’
‘That’s not for us.’ Malfoy pulled him away.
‘When all this is over.’ Draco slanted a sideways look at Harry, who gazed back. Harry's heart pounded under Draco’s examining eyes. He’d stupidly sat way too close and now wished he hadn’t. Draco’s proximity made him uneasy.
‘Esther watches the
to another—well, reality I think is the word. As you can understand, the Unspeakables are very intrigued. They will wish to interview you.’
Draco pulled the laces one by one, his eyes on his task. The more Harry watched him, the more he felt desire slush inside him, rising and filling him up until it was brimming from his skin. Draco was beautiful: sharp cheekbones and silver hair, a mouth full and red, eyes that held a surprising depth of sadness as if they had looked at the world for a thousand years and found it lacking. Harry’s throat felt dry, his mouth parched, and he licked his lips while Draco had finished opening his trousers and pulled them down.
Potter steals a quick kiss. ‘You OK?’
‘You can see it.’
‘But you won’t.’
— he didn’t know why. The caravans turned towards the north and all at once disappeared, probably Disillusioned.
On a crisp Saturday afternoon after lunch at Hogsmeade, Draco had expressed a desire to visit the Sanctuary. Weaving through the crowded High Street, hooded as not to attract attention, they left the village for the hills. Cold air blowing from the mountain stung Draco’s cheeks and the sky was laden with heavy clouds, threatening sleet. Draco wished warm, sunny days had been a local’s deepest desire, but judging from the number of couples he noticed, most wished for love.
‘You know Accio doesn’t work on wizards, Augustus.’ Dolohov sighed.
His stomach rumbled and Draco headed to the Great Hall, leaving his investigation for later. On the way, he was even more convinced something extraordinary had happened. The whispers behind his back and the looks he attracted were nothing new, but they were different: instead of glares, Draco received smiles; instead of scowls, students—even Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs—showed admiration.
Harry follows her down the corridor. Nurse Burbage has left the door ajar and Harry pauses, making a show of needing his cane more than he does. Doctor Lupin’s voice drifts to where Harry is pretending not to eavesdrop.
The derelict stone farmhouse smelled of animals and dust, and half of the front wall had collapsed, but it had a roof and the floor was dry. It’d have to do. He sat heavily in a corner as far from Malfoy as he could.
‘We brought information, my lord,’ Dolohov mumbled. ‘We know their destination.’
‘Riddle?’ Ron interrupted. ‘They say his policies are
Buttoning up his shirt and tucking it inside his trousers, he ran over his list.
He tried to imagine setting off for a day’s hard walk now, in the wind and drizzle, and his whole body protested. He wanted to keep going, he truly did. These last months were all about keeping going, all about pushing himself forward again and again, but right now the idea of leaving behind this wonderful cottage and Esther’s generous offer, just for the sake of arriving at Tinworth a day or two early… It wasn’t worth it.

Cam murmured back, but Harry didn’t hear. He was breathing as if his lungs had forgotten how to do it, his return to his body sluggish. Draco hadn’t let his arm go. He whispered now in Harry’s ear. ‘What did you see?’
Nuzzling Draco’s shoulder, his breath trapped in his chest, Harry waited…
‘OK there, Harry?’ Dawn asked.
Draco smiled with satisfaction at whatever torment he read on Harry’s face. He smoothed his white T-shirt and shook his hair out of his eyes. ‘What did you play when you were little? What did you call it? Cops and robbers?’
‘I bet they can’t, there’s loads of them,’ a voice said.
in power, the Death Eaters that are running things now, we’re no better than them Muggles.’
, and you’re mine forever,’ he growled as Draco landed open-mouthed kisses on Harry’s face.
Malfoy must have realised they were about to get caught out, because he said, ‘See this, Pauline? I have been
It is. Harry’s sleepy again and relaxed. His eyes flutter shut. The words come out of his mouth without conscious thought.
‘How can you
‘Merlin, I love it when you fuck me,’ Harry breathed.
Draco nudged him back, Harry retaliated and soon he found himself holding Draco’s arm, his face close to his husband’s. Draco’s breath fell on Harry’s cheek and Harry, heart beating, leaned in to kiss him. To his surprise, Draco kissed back. The kiss was lovely, making Harry’s veins tingle with gentle anticipation, but the taste of cheese and wine on Draco’s lips reminded Harry of Salazar. They broke away and sat back, the ice between them having thawed. Perhaps there was hope for them still.
His eyes surveyed the drawing room again; Lucius, Bellatrix and Narcissa writhing on the floor, their faces contorted in agony, but for Bellatrix’s deranged, ecstatic martyr’s smile.
His father is now dead, and Draco’s fucked. There’s no question about it. He’s seen what happens to the people who don’t pay their debts — they become
‘Well, then.’ Draco stands. ‘Get dressed, chop chop. We’re going.’ Cancelling the night light spell, he leaves Harry to help Nariyoshi get ready, while he goes to argue with the doctors about an early discharge.
‘I’m trying to find an exit… Ah! There’s one here.’
. ‘She sends me postcards from South America.’
, he’d told himself,
‘It’s been some time since I last talked about it. Years actually,’ she said. ‘People don’t want to ask. They think it distresses me. It does, but not in the way they think. I say it’s important for people to know.’
Salazar broke away from their embrace. ‘I’m leaving tomorrow for — for somewhere new.’
‘Would you?’ Draco’s so relieved. He has no idea why this scares him so. What if Nariyoshi decides he hates Draco for not telling him the truth earlier? What if he’s
‘And after all the trouble we got into for his poncy son,’ Ginny sighed. ‘That ship wasn’t easy to take.’ She was wearing a blood-red eye patch today; always a warning sign of danger. Harry decided to keep her as far from Malfoy as possible. She’d roughed him up a little one of the first days when she was meant to be guarding his door. She said he’d tried to escape, but Harry didn’t think the man had the guts to attempt to.
‘What did you see?’ Draco asked.
we will. Here,’ Draco drags Harry along the wall in front of the portrait. ‘I want her to see everything.’ He Banishes their clothing upstairs and presses himself on Harry. ‘I was going to suck you, but now I want to give my aunt a better show. Open your legs.’
Harry tried to return to sleep, but he was unable to tear his eyes from the elegant column of Draco’s neck, the muscle that curved downwards to a sharp shoulder. Soft fuzz covered Draco’s neck, and Harry couldn’t find it in himself to move back. His eyes kept straying to the edge of Draco’s T-shirt, which hid the rest of his skin from Harry.
Harry’s feet couldn’t take him to the back door fast enough. He led the way to the alley where couples in dark corners moved against each other. Heading to a narrow lane on their right, Harry found a quiet spot and turned to speak, but Salazar pushed him against the wall and kissed him hard, rubbing his erection against Harry’s hip.
Captain of the Dread Armada, also known as the D.A.’
Harry had to hand it to him; it was a brilliant idea. A pureblood like Dolohov wouldn’t know what to make of anything Muggle. However, Muggle resources required Muggle money: they had barely any left. Luckily, after considerable search, they’d found a second-hand electronics shop — where Draco possibly Confounded the owner while haggling and Harry pretended he didn’t hear it — and a Boots to visit a photo booth, which delighted Draco in an endearing way.
‘I don’t know.’ Draco peered at the letter and brightened, an almost childlike hope on his face. ‘That’s the Black seal on the letter, though. Not the Malfoy.’
‘First, you come and say goodbye to Esther.’
Dolohov let out a curse and spun around himself like a dog chasing his tail. Fists clenched, he stopped and muttered an Anti-Apparition spell. Then, he stared at the corner where Harry’s voice came from. The walkie-talkie sat unassuming in the shadows, still undetected.
, this is— I had no idea it’d feel so—’
‘Of course.’
to fall back on. We’ve survived out of pure luck so far.’
continued its tirade against all former Death Eaters, mentioning his father almost daily. The Dark Mark haunted his dreams without respite. Draco longed for nothing more than to go back to the Mirror world, but he knew that to wish for it meant wanting death.
And whenever Harry had asked them why they’d come to Mordred’s Mend, then, they’d just… give him a sad little look and change the subject. They never explained it - they never explained anything, really - and so Harry had been forced to just accept the reality as it was, and deal with his curiosities on his own.
And yet, when it happened… Harry didn’t know how to begin describing how
What else? He could say he was a necromancer, but everyone seemed to care about it so much more than he did. He could also say he was a Potter, but not only did Crabbe already know that, but Harry didn’t
For a moment Harry entertained the thought of asking more: had she eaten? Had she slept, or showered, or done anything more than wander around? He almost did, opening his eyes with the question ready to spill out, but stopped because—if he asked, did that mean that there was an answer he wanted to hear? Would asking make him hope foolishly?
Harry stood still, stunned. He had tried– and
“Yes,” Harry replied. “I’m… kind of surprised. He’s really good at what he does. I like the cottage more and more every time I see it. I can’t wait for it to be ready, so I can show you guys the whole place.”

,” Lestrange replied, rolling her eyes. “I’m not afraid of that old bastard. Remember, baby necromancer, don’t trust anyone at Hogwarts. It’s a bad, bad place for people like us.”
“Not before the lessons started,” Harry explained. “But since then I’ve been to Hillcrest many, many times. And then wherever Ellis Nott or Bellatrix Lestrange want to take me.”
“Who else is with you there?” Crabbe asked. Harry wasn’t sure if the man knew the answer, but, well… he

“I’ve been spending a lot of time with Malfoy,” Harry started. “And, you know, we’ve been getting along fairly well, right?”
“Harry acts normal. He does occasionally have nightmares, but who doesn’t?”
impression. He didn’t mind Ellis Nott, and felt pleased when the man approved of anything he did. He wasn’t sure if that counted as liking him, however. “When will we start?”
It stood all by its lonesome deep in the Northern Woods, where the trees were dead, and the roads were alive. Sunlight could never quite reach through the branches to warm the icy creeks and hollow burrows, leaving everything in a permanent state of early winter. The silence that reigned in these woods tapped the windows of the house at night.
– let out a bark of a laugh, before sitting down on Harry’s other side.
“More time to worry about this, you mean,” Harry sighed, and rubbed his eyes. “You’re right. I’ll just… wait and see, for a bit. There’s no rush, is there? Aside from, you know, him moving to France to study at Beauxbatons.”
fine.”
“You’re weird like that,” Malfoy said, though it came across a bit too fond to be an insult. “Everything here creaks, even after the renovation. Hell if I know why, but it’s good that you’re fine with it.”
“Tell me if she leaves,” Harry then said, before turning away from the elf. He would take a shower, and then settle in to read something – anything – to keep his mind occupied. Bella had been right – if only Harry had a wand of some sort, he could keep himself occupied even better by practicing the things she’d told him about. Now all he could do was simply… read and wonder if it was too early to start counting days till he’d get to go to Hogwarts.
”That’s amazing,” Harry said, suddenly feeling wistful.
Uncle Tony let out a sigh, before proceeding to walk through the rooms of the first floor, Harry trailing behind him. They found Lily and James in the kitchen — Lily, digging through the pantry, and James, his remains standing still behind her. The stench was awful, but somehow waved away by a flick of a wand.
”The dementors left, didn’t they?”
“Okay.” What else was there for Harry to say? “They will teach me? Here?”

Malfoy squinted at him, pointy face expressing nothing but suspicion. ”It’s for sale.”
“You speak freely in front of him?” Crabbe asked,
“They don’t have the magic you do,” Uncle Tony had told him once. “Their lullabies do nothing. The darkness around them is empty. They have the peace of peasantry – the ignorant and the fool, lulled into a false sense of safety. You’re free of that, Harry. You’re not asleep.”
A smile – normal in appearance yet somehow terrifying – flashed across Nott’s face, making Harry think of the shadows that ran past open doorways back home sometimes. “Never give more information than what’s asked for,” Nott said then. “Dolohov… I have a son his age at home, and Theodore is a loud, brash child who wouldn’t be able to sit quietly through a lesson even if he were dead – no pun intended.”
Harry nodded, though he had no idea what had given his godfather
“Here we are.”
“You’re not wrong, but do read about them, it’s an interesting case that shows how stupidity blooms in grounds fertilized by greed and ignorance,” Antonin replied. “People are criminally uneducated when it comes to history, not recognizing how important it is to understand how the world we exist in today came to be, and why is it the way it is –
The thought of becoming friends with Malfoy wasn’t something Harry had expected to ever want, but here he was… embarrassingly happy to have his schooltime rival give him a chance to properly reconcile. To give them a chance. A chance to have a second beginning at a friendship that could’ve begun years ago.
”Isn’t that right,” Harry muttered, and shook his head. He then pushed the Daily Prophet aside and looked at Ginny. ”About the funeral—”
“Where’s Lily?” Harry asked, no longer interested in tea.
“I don’t want people to bother me,” Harry finally said, deciding to focus on his anticipated Hogwarts attendance. Crabbe nodded, encouraging the boy to continue. “I don’t know how often people like talking to each other, or what to even talk about. And what about the lessons themselves? What if I fail subjects or something?” What if everyone already knew each other and he’d be left as the odd one out? He liked being alone, but only if it was
Harry thought of James, his breaking body a rotten shell that could barely hobble after Lily anymore. What would his mother do when his father’s corpse had fallen apart too much for it to function? Would she finally snap out of her misery and come back? Or was she going to sink deeper into her delusions and just… forget all about Harry?
not too observant, are you?”
“You’re way ahead of reality now,” Nott told her. “Keep in mind that while
Uncle Tony had led them to a small, beautiful building with white walls and red paint. Harry didn’t know what they were in this particular place for, but it looked more like a teahouse than anything else, with floating teapots and comfortable seating. A handful of cats were lounging around, basking in the sunlight seeping in through the windows.
necromancy.”
Back then Uncle Tony’s visits had been different, too. He’d first spend time with Harry’s parents, discussing some papers and books and things Harry didn’t understand. Back then Harry had wondered why it was that Uncle Tony was his godfather when he didn’t appear to be a close friend of either of Harry’s parents, but… well… the Potters didn’t have many friends. Harry had never met anyone else - he’d met none of the few people his parents had told him they would visit sometimes. In the end there wasn’t much else Harry could do but accept the situation as it was - Uncle Tony was nice to him, and that was good enough.
“You aren’t Hermione, and what works for her doesn’t work for everyone,” Ron said. “It’ll be fine, mate. No matter what happens after you tell the git, eventually everything will be just fine again.”
Merlin, he was tired of having people hate him. He was tired of fights and arguments. He just... he just wanted some peace and a handful of friends and no quarrel with anyone, anymore.
It was the only home Harry Potter had ever known.
Harry let out another annoyed sigh, before climbing out of the bed and heading towards the closed door. From the corner of his eye he saw the house-elf sweating and tearing up, its fear almost tangible. He hated it. How many years had it been? Harry had never hurt anyone -
“If it’s painless and fast—? Surely it’d be better for Li— mum to die like that than be whatever she is right now, right?”
“Vurney,” Harry said, hating how strange he felt to be speaking out loud in the House, and knowing that the house-elf would hear him even if it didn’t dare to appear. “Bring my mother back in. You can leave James out if he’s not fast enough to follow.”
Malfoy startled, before tilting his head and looking at Harry again, quietly, for a while. “You’re serious?”
like a Potter. He didn’t feel like anything resembling his dad.
When Harry opened his eyes, he knew immediately that he was somewhere in the Woods. The air around him was cold and wet, as if he was caught in invisible mist. The ground was wet underneath him, sticks and stones poking at his bare feet like sharp and cold fingertips, making him shift in discomfort. The trees were still and silent - and one would
Harry didn’t know what exactly was being discussed now. He was growing bored and restless, but he didn’t dare to shift in his seat or relax – he didn’t know, after all, what Uncle Tony would think of that after having specifically told Harry to remain focused. What if his godfather wanted to ask him questions about this encounter afterwards? The last thing Harry wanted to do was disappoint him.
And frankly, even if he wasn't-- none of this was Harry's business anyway. He had enough things to worry about without getting involved in things that were clearly complicated. Harry was just going to keep his head down and stay out of the way. That he was absolutely certain of.
“Thank you,” Harry replied, hesitantly then asking: “should I now go to the lesson with Mrs. Goyle even though I’m late?”
”Sure,” Nettlewick responded, now less positive and more judgemental. ”It was good to see you, Mr. Potter, and I look forward to your next visit!”

“Is there a way to kill someone fast?”
“Think he might… feel some sort of a way about me?”
understand what the two were saying, he couldn’t help but feel that there was something in the conversation that he hadn’t grasped. He just… even after all this time, he just wasn’t used to following conversations between other people. He wasn’t used to that.
He was scared.

“He can channel all that into talking,” Uncle Tony said. “Talking to
”We can go to the Burrow for that later on,” Ron said. ”I doubt they left our dorms undamaged, and even if they did... maybe it’s better to shower at home.”
Malfoy’s eyebrows were raised, but he nodded slowly. “Doable.”
“This way,” Uncle Tony said, walking ahead. Harry hurried after the man, almost running to keep up with his long strides and they headed down a hallway. Its walls were painted red, with flashes of gold here and here. Above his head Harry could see figures of strange creatures etched into the ceiling, their little twisted faces looking down at them. “This is my office,” Uncle Tony said, pushing a door open and gesturing for Harry to follow him in. “I don’t expect you to remember it. Sit down and don’t touch anything.”
Harry looked past his godfather, at his mother. The woman had her face pressed against James’s shoulder, and she didn’t respond. Harry wanted her to say something - anything, really - but she didn’t.
”What about you, Harry?” Hermione asked, leaning towards him. ”I think a simple daily routine would do us both some good. We wouldn’t start right away, of course. The school will need to be fixed first. I assume the new semester would start in September again, wouldn’t it?”
Malfoy looked at him again, his expression making Harry’s heart ache for some reason. Briefly, Harry wondered what kind of a friend Malfoy would have been at Hogwarts, before he decided to not dwell on things he couldn’t change. The silence stretched for a few moments longer, before Malfoy scowled, and turned away.
Harry turned away from the allegedly hand-painted cabinet doors to look at Malfoy, who was standing right by one of the windows in the kitchen. “Yes?”
“Yeah,” Harry agreed with a grin. “What did your family call it when you had it?”
When Harry arrived, he found himself in a dark room. It didn’t quite look right for a living room - the chairs were scattered, and there were too many tables. There were papers piled here and there, and a vase of water with some treats on a tray by one of the doors. The walls were lined with tall shelves full of books, and the floor was covered in carpets. There were no portraits.
damage and—
Happiness had never been so reachable.
'Just focus on breathing,' Harry told himself then, trying stop his body from shaking. He still felt cold and sick, and anxious enough to nearly cry. He desperately wished for a solution - anything to get him out of this situation - while thanking his lucky stars for waking up just in time to hide. He didn't want to think of waking up to see Lily looming over him. Could he have called a house-elf? What was the likelihood of them helping him against his mother, anyway, when she was the one who still, being his only surviving parent, had the final say in almost everything concerning Harry and Mordred's Mend.
”Is Malfoy going to actually be there when the house is being fixed?” Ron asked, suddenly curious. ”Make him do the heavy lifting, Harry. Confiscate his wand and make him work like a—”
is why the term ghost is so misleading, though only when someone like
“The boy brought his father back,” Antonin then said. Nott startled, his round eyes becoming even rounder, now gaining a gleam of something unsettling. “Brought him back well enough that his mother thinks the man never died.” Harry noticed that his godfather didn’t mention that Lily wasn’t in any condition to make logical conclusions, and that Harry’s revival of James was truly far from perfect.
“They will teach you,” Uncle Tony confirmed, “but not here. All your lessons will be held in my home, Hillcrest. After your meeting with them today - if they decide to agree to teaching you - we will discuss an upcoming schedule. But that will mean that you must learn how to take care of yourself while you’re here, do you understand? You must shower every day, eat every day, sleep through the night. Otherwise you will not have the energy to learn well.”

tension and nervous energy.”
”I’m not surprised,” Malfoy sniffed. Harry wondered if Malfoy thought his feigned displeasure was somehow convincing, and decided to just leave the matter be. Malfoy had always been a bit quirky in his own way. ”Fine, I’ll take care of the small details, which you will then ruin with whatever decor ideas you decide to implement.”
“My parents didn’t side with him, though. Why?”
”Come in,” Petunia hissed, yanking him inside and shutting the door behind him. ”Before the neighbors see you! What are you doing here?”
“You’ll meet some if they wish to be met. Now – here we are.
“I’m not entirely opposed to that suggestion,” Malfoy finally said. “But I will consider it only after my work here is done.”
”If you ever need another place for any reason,” McGonagall said, ”know that Hogwarts will always welcome you, whether you were students or not.”
“A ghost,” Nott continued, “is an imprint of the soul of a once-living wizard or witch. They’re fleshless spirits that linger having made the

She’d laid there for nearly a day before Harry had told the house-elves to bury James’s remains somewhere too deep for his mother to dig out.

So happy he knew that if he knew how, he would have been able to cast any spell, including the Killing Curse. Maybe soon he’d get to do that, if he could convince Bellatrix to teach him.
that the rows weren’t empty. The walls themselves were listening to him, and he didn’t want to know what this place would do to him if he was left alone.
“I honestly don’t know,” Harry said. The two fell into a silence, focusing on their ice creams, until Harry spoke again: “So, there’s something weird that I want to kind of… tell you about?”
”Of course he is,” Hermione said. ”But we’re no longer eleven, Ron, and there’s no need to keep fighting. Now, Harry, you said you liked the cottage?”
“No,” he said, leaning closer. He was smiling. Harry could feel that smile against his lips, and couldn't help but smile into the kiss right away.
“In all the ways that matter,” Nott replied. “They want to go but never made it to the other side, and remain invisible to both the living and the dead— except to those like you who toe the line.”
It was… scary.
Healer Crabbe’s office was very different from the ones Harry had seen before. Ellis Nott’s office was neat and organized, full of books and odd objects with whispers all around them, while Uncle Tony’s was kind of messy with its various maps and floating devices that he had never explained or introduced. Healer Crabbe’s office was… well, it was also full of books, but it was large and light. The furntiture was white, and so were the couches and the carpets and the curtains. There were two large windows at the opposite ends of the room, each showing a different landscape, as if peeking into different parts of the world somehow.
“Vaguely?”
“Harry, where are you?”
And then: “I don’t know what else to say.”
Harry let out a sigh, cursing quietly. His fingers curled around the handle of a knife he had stolen from the kitchen before. “What time is it?” he then asked.
is to teach him as much as possible before anyone catches on to what’s happening. Because the moment Dumbledore or one of his pesky little lions hear a peep of what Harry here can do, you best believe they will interfere.”
had gotten worse. His mother, too. Where before she had been sadly flitting from room to room, crying and trying to make sure Harry was well, James’s return had done something to her.
However, speaking of souls— “I have a question?”
”They did.”
So focused on his little observations he was, that Harry didn’t notice his godfather watching him. The sharp grey eyes took in the boy’s sickly pale complexion, his clean but clearly barely brushed hair, and robes that were woefully mismatched. It was clear that while the boy hadn’t been left entirely to his own devices - not with the house-elves providing him with some functions of normalcy - there was no one to help him further than that.
”They didn’t go to the same places,” Ginny replied. ”Mum and Dad went with Bill to sort out, um, some things. About the twins. Percy is helping out at Hogwarts, and Charlie is doing some damage control at Diagon Alley. Ron and Hermione wanted to wake you up, but Mum told them not to. They went shopping for school supplies, strangely enough.”
Harry couldn’t imagine himself loving anyone that much.
“They can
”I’ve already bought everything I need,” the witch said, beaming with excitement. ”It is quite odd to think of going back without the two of you, I must say.”
- ever since. Which meant that no matter how quiet she was being, she had to be still there.
”You’ll be fine,” Ron told her, before he continued: ”Bill will stay in England a bit longer, and he’ll help me with the shop. Mum thinks they wouldn’t have wanted to... they wouldn’t have wanted for the shop to disappear.”
“That’s a unique approach by his parents,” Ellis said. “Though I’d like to suggest including regular therapy in his pre-Hogwarts curriculum.”
“I don’t kno— I don’t think so?”
“Necromancers, as you know, are incredibly rare throughout history,” Uncle Tony continued. “There are none alive today who could teach you the secrets that you will have to discover on your own. However, the two people I will introduce you to today have researched the subject in question extensively, and have thus acquired a vast theoretical knowledge of it.”
“Hogwarts will not be able to teach him what he needs to learn,” Uncle Tony said. “They know nothing of how to prepare him for life as someone capable of doing the things he can. In Hogwarts he’ll be doomed to hide that part of himself, suppress it and neglect it. Durmstrang—”

was quite like Harry. It was one of the few things that Lily and Uncle Tony were in agreement of, and they both had told him many, many times that should he ever encounter other people, he’d have to keep the things he could do a secret. Other people would fear him, he’d been told. They’d hate him. And while Harry didn’t know what exactly that entailed, he didn’t think he’d want to experience it.
”Just in case,” she’d say. ”We’re better off avoiding visiting the same place twice too soon.”
There wasn't anything else he could do, was there?
“Vurney,” Harry called, his voice barely above a whisper. He pushed himself up to a sitting position, feeling cold. A shaking house-elf appeared in his room a moment later. He looked at it, once again resenting its fear - why was it scared of
It was a bit before lunch that a house-elf - different from the one in the morning, did they take turns or something? - popped in to tell him of an arriving guest. Harry, eager to see his godfather, hurried towards the fireplace, not caring to be wary of where Lily would be.
The next time Harry was in McGonagall’s office, things were vastly different.
”We fed you and clothed you—”
Harry was startled when Crabbe suddenly gestured at him. “He’s very pale,” the man said. “His posture is
“Do you like it at home?” Crabbe asked instead.
“They all are,” Uncle Tony replied. “Then we have the Cruciatus Curse. It inflicts pain so intense and excruciating, it can - and has - driven its victims insane. Despite popular misconceptions, however, it does not cause physical harm. The only way to identify it is by residual magic which doesn’t linger for a long time.”
Harry didn’t trust things that changed without him knowing why.
”Harry is not going to do that,” Hermione cut in sharply. ”We’re no longer going to be picking fights with Malfoy, or
“Okay,” Ron said, putting his ice cream down and looking at Harry. “Go on.”
Up on the roof, Harry watched as his parents began making their way towards their - his, too - home again. As soon as he heard the front door swing shut, he slid down the tilted roof, dangling his feet over the edge, before taking a hold of a branch nearby and swinging himself safely back onto solid ground. His mother didn’t trust the trees, but Harry knew that the Woods weren’t that simple.
”Now?” Malfoy asked, clearly taken off guard and unsure of what to do with the situation. After a moment of contemplation and another glance at Nettlewick’s sign, he hesitantly nodded. ”Fine, Potter. Let’s go.”
”Not the kind of a cottage that you and the Weaslette would want,” Malfoy replied sharply, a pink tinge appearing on his cheeks. ”It’s too small to fit your enormous ego, Potter, and too removed for your adoring fans to find you.”
“You’ve both taken a vow of secrecy,” Uncle Tony said, and Harry, who didn’t quite understand the exchange between Nott and Lestrange, felt relieved when he knew what that meant, at least. “The longer Harry’s abilities are kept secret, the better. Meanwhile we will make sure all of his practicing will be done here in Russia – consider it a loophole of sorts, if you must. I’ll also need someone to teach him the etiquette his parents never cared much about.”
Merlin, what were other families like?
"That's it?" Ron said, surprised. "It sounds small."
“Plenty since infancy,” Antonin said. “But— his father died a few months ago.”
”Living a sickly life in solitude is amazing to you, Potter?” Malfoy said, too bewildered to come up with an insult. ”Really?”
“I don’t know,” Harry replied eventually. He wanted to leave Mordred’s Mend but also
, and— and Harry didn’t want to risk it. And so he remained there, in that House, in Mordred’s Mend, seeing no one but his parents and his godfather.
she didn’t blame him for what he had pulled her family into.
Eventually, having done nothing but stand still by Harry's empty bed, not attempting to look for him, Lily suddenly turned on her heels and ran out and down the corridor, her bare feet slapping loudly against the polished floors. The door was left open behind her, and Harry wanted so badly to move from his spot to close it at least, but he-- he couldn't. Lily's fast and abrupt movement had left him shaking and afraid, and he didn't dare to move from his hiding spot quite yet.
Luna stops suddenly, blinking at him with a puzzled expression. “You thought we were going to find a random dragon? In the middle of the night? In the castle?”
(The eleven-year-old in Harry wishes it had hit him in the face.)
“Like finding a professor.” At his sceptical look, Draco laughs and ruffles his hair. “You’re small and cute. Just cry and run up to a teacher and I’ll bet they’ll be falling all over themselves to help you.”
But look! Plot! Things are happening! Anton's here for like three lines, even. I keep making all these OCs and falling in love god im sorry. Julius just popped up I didn't even plan him. An accidental baby.
He smiles at her over the body of his violin. “My lady, do you not enjoy my playing? I practiced so hard for you this year.”
Malfoy’s eyes cuts a glance at her slumped figure and sighs, drawing himself up. The look on his face this time as he inspects Harry again through the holey rock is the same as the one he wears in a hard Quidditch match, one where he has to outmanoeuvre and manipulate the other seeker to win the game.
“Thank you, my lady,” says Susan, looking tired but smiling brightly. “It was an honour.”
Harry blinks his eyes open and sees a quarter moon, bright and blinding, hanging low over the Black Lake.
He didn’t expect that. After all, with hair too short to cover his neck, you could see where Malfoy’s prisoner identification numbers were tattooed on his nape. For some reason, Harry had thought that he’d want to hide it.
what couldn’t he? Ministry plans. Auror movements. Hell,
“Oh,” Anton suddenly looks calculating and Draco feels a simultaneous burst of pride and apprehension. “I think I understand, Draco. I just have to think creatively.”
like that?” Luna cuts in, brows furrowed.
(He would have skipped dinner altogether to get more things done but Blaise would have looked at him with his judgemental face and lectured him about setting a good example for the younger children and Draco
The grip on his hand tightens.
That familiar look in this setting stops Harry in his tracks as he’s about to demand answers, and the halted reflex leaves him a little off-balance. Though what part of him isn’t off-balance at this point? So much has happened, and he understands none of it. Maybe he doesn’t
let me SLEEP you fucks
“Hex them quick then run away.”
Malfoy raises an eyebrow. “What
Despite all that, it was nonetheless dangerous to be on the Platform so blatantly. Most Slytherins chose to travel to Hogwarts by floo this year, if they were returning at all. With parents and friends in Azkaban, and a crowd full of victims awaiting a train that takes them right back to the barely cleared battlegrounds, not many were willing to risk having their backs to so many vengeful wands.
“Nah, Nev. Thanks though. I think I’ve slept it off.”
Pansy sits up and gasps, theatrically, with an expression that Draco does not care for at all. “More important things than what Potter’s wearing? Why, Draco! You didn’t tell us you’d finally reached puberty! Our late bloomer, grown up at last!” She caps it all off by dabbing at the corners of her eyes with her sleeves.
But him being there helps. Lots of witnesses are more willing to speak up when they see him in the front row, a reminder that their tormentors are not as untouchable as they had seemed.
It starts with this.
And it pays off. His playing is crisp and haunting, guiding the dancers, both corporeal and ghostly all in white robes, through the proper steps of the ancient ritual, unchanged but for the time and place. The melody of Pansy’s flute flutters high above their heads, a perfect accompaniment to his deeper, darker tones.
“Dragon?”
He lets it all drip into the water. It’s so easy to ignore that other voice then.
He thinks of Pansy trembling in the dark, gripping his hand so tight he could hear his bones creak, of Greg, of
magic to channel this year. They hadn’t had the heart to turn anyone who truly wanted to participate away.
He shoots a glance at Neville, who looks to be thinking the same thing.
It's not the same as before the war, of course. Before, people looked at them with wary awe. Or jealousy. Nowadays if they weren’t hissing or sneering, they ushered their children away, wary and fearful.
What's that face??? I don't know that face?
Luna nods, smiling widely again. She picks up his arm and tugs him along again, moving faster this time. “He’s very gentle. I was quite surprised when I met him. I’m sure he can help us with your problem, Harry. He’s very clever.”
There are less first years this year, and they huddle together in the middle of the Great Hall, moving as one to the front where Professor Sprout stands waiting.
Theodotus Nott is a fool, and Draco hopes he rots in Azkaban.
“Only sometimes.”
But all through their horseplay Harry sees Luna frowning at him from the corner of his eyes. When he turns to ask her if something was wrong with a look, her frown deepens, and she reaches for his hand.
I'm so pleasantly surprised by how well this has been received. Thank you so much for your kind words! As soon as I read them I was so inspired and that's why this chapter came out so quickly.
That’s… well at least that’s something Harry can control, even if he can’t bring himself to fully trust Malfoy’s motives in helping him solve whatever is wrong with Harry this time.
He moves both he and his dance partner effortlessly through the crowd, couples bowing them towards the empty space in the centre of the dance floor. By the time they make it there, his dance partner is taller, a young woman with hair as dark as the space between the stars. She makes a pleased noise at the attention as Draco leads her through the first sequence, the other dancers following along in a slow spiral around them.
“The core was harvested from South Africa,” the witch continued. “It’s an Impundulu feather. I’ve never seen a living one, but an Impundulu – Lightning Bird, as people from overseas call it – is said to be as large as a grown man. It can summon storms and lightning. But we here know it as the protector of witch doctors.”
“No, no,” Crabbe cut in. “In my office, where I have appropriate wards and charms in place to ensure full confidentiality.”
?” Ron croaked, and then suddenly paled, perhaps remembering that though Mr. Weasley had clearly survived, two of his brothers hadn’t. Merlin, Harry wanted to... wanted to just... go. Disappear, or
“They’re looking anyway,” Lestrange sneered in response. “Let them look! Their clocks are ticking and their time is running out whether they know it or not.”
“You don’t need to worry,” Ellis said. “You know him. It’s Caspar Crabbe. If there’s anyone who could handle it, it’ll be him.”
“If… if you weren’t going,” Harry said. “Would you want to get to know me? Because I really… I want to get to know you. You said you didn’t think you understood me, right? Well, you’re not that easy to figure out either, you know. And if there’s something I’ve realized during these past few weeks, it’s that I do want to get to know you.”
, and it was all
“You said that it’d surely be better for Lily to die painlessly and quickly, than live the way she lives now,” Uncle Tony said. “That’s not quite the same as euthanizing someone with a fatal wound, now is it?”
"And who knows when you'll need to sort someone out with your little fists to avoid compromising your wand," the witch then continued, before digging the tip of the knife into the head of the illustration. "Given the option, always go for the head, baby. So many things you can achieve here: aim for the temple or jaw of a knockout, nose and eyes to confuse their senses, and neck to stop them from talking - or breathing, for that matter. Your problem with this will be, of course, will be your reach. A jinx could go through, so don't discount the head even if you can't physically get to it."
- to be found on her face.
Harry thought, climbing up the stairs quietly. Lily was thankfully nowhere to be seen, and so he could simply sink into his thoughts and forget about the strangeness of his life for a moment. When he closed the door of his room, he locked it, briefly wondering if he should take a look into the cupboard or under the bed – just to make sure Lily wasn’t hiding there.
“The illusion of controlling the souls of the dead comes actually from few
“We’re looking for Harry,” she said, voice just barely loud enough for Harry to hear her from his hiding place, even when carried up to his ears by the Woods. “It’s his birthday.”
“You worry too much, Antonin. Harry can practice during the holidays - he studies so well on his own, you know. Everything will be fine. Everything
“Yes?”
Oh. Oh.
”And you... like the place?” Ginny said, lying by the fireplace in the Burrow. Harry, resisting the urge to fall asleep, nodded.
“But where are they now? There’s no one here.”
“If we’re doing this, can’t you just call me Harry?” Harry asked. Malfoy snorted, his thumbs rubbing gently against Harry’s cheeks.
He wasn’t outside. He hadn’t been outside. He’d been dreaming. He’d
”Merlin, I hope not,” Ginny huffed.
“Hello,” Caspar Crabbe said. His voice much deeper than Harry had expected.
He didn’t know how he had ended up there - had he sleepwalked? Crabbe had told him that sleepwalking indicated a heightened risk of schizophrenia, but he’d never sleepwalked before. He didn’t want to be sleepwalking out of the safety of his bedroom with Lily lurking in the corridors - as if the corridors on their own weren’t dangerous enough. Not to mention leaving the House at night had just… he’d never done that before, and Harry was
”Oh, the renovation will start immediately, then?” Hermione asked, sounding pleased. ”That’s very good. I’d offer to come with you, but I’ll be meeting Lisa Turpin to discuss our upcoming study schedule. She’s going back to finish her studies as well.”
And, Harry promised himself, once he went to Hogwarts and got his wand, the first spell he was ever going to learn would be the Killing Curse.
“You needn’t concern yourself with that,” Uncle Tony said. “The boy will be better off kept busy anyway.”
- what would happen there in his absence? What if he went to Hogwarts and everyone was terrible to him there? He didn’t know what to expect but somehow just couldn’t believe that things would turn for the better. “I don’t know what to expect.”
wouldn’t be able to live with. The most common expression he has on his dumb little face is that of confusion. He’s startled too easily, he’s fatigued and has clear signs of exhaustion. His physical health is bad, he’s too thin and too pale and too fragile. He has difficulties concentrating. He’s anxious and afraid, withdrawn to the point of – for fuck’s sake, Dolohov, the boy is a hermit! Does he even talk to anyone but us?”
“Thanks.” The smile on Malfoy’s face was a smug one, but rightfully so, Harry supposed. “You’ll proceed with the purchase as intended, then, I presume?”
“You turn ten today,” Uncle Tony said, as if Harry didn’t know that. “I need you to listen to me carefully, and make sure you understand and remember what I’m about to tell you, can you do that?”
”Ron!” Hermione admonished, before smiling at Harry. ”I, for one, am happy that the two of you are reconciling. Holding on to past grudges isn’t good.”
– his mother had screamed through her own delusions, nearly losing her breath as she chased Harry away.
. The doorways arched and the windows curled and the buildings were painted in white.
Malfoy dropped one of the handles he had been holding in his hand, and spun to look at Harry in disbelief. Of all the things he had expected to hear, this was clearly not it. “…what?”
“You have someone already in mind?”
“And where is James?”
“Would they want to sell me a wand?” Harry asked, curious. “If it’s so… if they’re so secretive? Or are they fine with selling things, so long as the knowledge of how to replicate those things isn’t shared?”
“A ghost in the sense that I explained - a ghost like those you’ll encounter at Hogwarts - is no longer human. It is a creature under the categorization of a spirit. It is a different being. What
“Vurney,” Harry called, taking off his jacket and throwing it carelessly on the bed. He heard the house-elf pop in, and turned to see it shaking by the doorway.
"No one," Bellatrix replied, before pulling out a knife and using its sharp tip to gesture at the illustration. "I'll show you where to aim your little spells to get the best out of them, baby necromancer. You see - it makes a hell of a difference if your little jinxes hit someone in the leg or the neck. And that difference can really safe your life some day."
“A British pureblood and nothing less,” Ellis interrupted. “Someone certified from St. Mungo’s.”
There was rubble all around him. And dust. Clouds of dust, heavier than he had ever seen before. The sky was grey, the ground was wet, and there was taste of blood in his mouth.
Ah. Speak of the devil. Though, to be fair to this particular devil striding towards Lily, it wasn’t unusual for Uncle Tony to come as early as he could on Harry’s birthday. Lily, ankle-deep in a puddle of something, turned to wave at the wizard approaching her.
“Oh, yes. Anything’s fine,” Harry said, unable to stop looking at the details of everything that surrounded him. “Except petunias. And pansies. And I don’t… I don’t really like tulips either. You know, let’s skip flowers altogether. Anything’s fine, except flowers. Is that okay?”
“You told me that was accidental magic, didn’t you? You didn’t say anything in order to bring him back, and so it’ll be impossible to tell what is actually powering him at the moment. Could be you, or could be any other power source you’ve connected him to unwittingly. This is why it’s so difficult to fix damage caused by accidental magic - you never really
“Yes,” Harry said, and did as told. He sat on a beautiful, uncomfortable chair with curled legs and armrests, and tried to will his nervousness away. To distract himself, he looked up and down, and left and right at the room that seemed somehow…
No, he couldn't call for a house-elf. Those things weren't to be trusted.
Harry thought. He didn’t know for how long Lily would keep James around, but didn’t think she’d let go anytime soon. He’d have to figure a way to coexist with the stench, somehow.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry thought, looking at the wand.
“You’re expected to receive your Hogwarts letter soon,” Healer Crabbe said, leaning back on his chair, hands folded on top of the table. Harry wondered if the man ever felt the need to just
”Well, you shouldn’t have bothered to come here at all,” Petunia snapped back. ”We were told that you, their great hero, are alive and well.”
“Whatever, Potter. Come on, now, let’s test the fireplace to make sure everything works as it should, and then I need to ask you a bit about colour schemes.”
“You need to be careful with saying things like that,” Nott told her. “You
“Ah, yes. Potter and the unfortunate accident. How dreadfully tragic, I suppose.”
“Can ghosts tell that I’m a necromancer?” Harry asked then, suddenly curious.
“Well,” Dolohov drawled, “we’re not
Harry wondered, though the thought of giving up on his wand now felt unbearable.
“What about Britain?”
“I’m already imagining a cozy Christmas in there,” Ron sighed. “Your very own place, mate. That’s amazing. Even with Malfoy being involved, it’s still amazing.”
“This is my godson, Harry,” Uncle Tony said in English. “He’s here for his wand.”
Harry almost shook his head, but then stopped to think. He had been so used to Lily ignoring him, he hadn’t realized that she was starting to pay attention to him again. And yet now that he thought about it, she had started just… turning her head towards him more. Walking by his room more often. If he was in the living room or the kitchen, she’d sometimes come to stand by the doorway and just… watch him. And then that stomping run that she had recently started doing— did people just change the way they ran suddenly?
things, but he couldn’t do the things Harry did. Then again… nothing out there was like him. The Woods weren’t like him, the House wasn’t like him. Ellis Nott wasn’t like him, and most probably the other teacher wasn’t like Harry either.
“Potter, you’re lying,” Malfoy snapped, taking a step towards him. “There’s no way— Merlin, is this why your friends think the sun shines out of your arse, you reckless bellend? There’s no way any of that is true!”
Trembling house-elves prepared a bath for Harry, and the boy made sure to brush his hair twice more carefully than before, and wear the clothes his godfather had told the house-elves to set out for him. Nott cared about appearances, Uncle Tony had told him, and Harry didn’t wish to upset his new teacher before the first lesson.
”That will cost you extra,” Malfoy instantly shot back, and then turned to look at Harry with yet another look of suspicion. ”And no refunds if you don’t like it.”
“That slippery fuck,” Ellis said. “He’ll run back when the Dark Lord rises. And we’ll get our pound of flesh out of him then. And in the meanwhile, we simply wait.”
“No, no, if you have a headache it might be best to simply rest for now,” Uncle Tony said. “I’ll make sure Harry has some cake while we’re out.”
Harry thought, forcing himself to bypass the moments of contemplation during which he would’ve thought of any underlying meanings or missions. Instead he simply did what Bellatrix asked of him: describe everything he felt, heard, and smelled. And when he ran out of the obvious things - the cold air, the sounds of her breathing and the wind outside, his own discomfort - he latched onto the stream of thoughts he had lost control of.
– this was his wand, and he wasn’t going to give it up.
he felt fingertips grazing his knees through the floorboards. “Keep your eyes closed. Take deep breaths, and describe everything around you to me.”
“Humanity has been drifting from war to war, conflict to conflict, throughout the times,” Uncle Tony began. “And with that, wizards and witches have developed increasingly efficient ways to attack and defend. Some of those spells were darker than others, and eventually three in particular rose to infamy: Avada Kedavra, Cruciatus, and Imperio. It didn’t take long for the Wizengamot to label these three curses as unforgivable, and it was declared in 1717 that dire consequences would befall anyone who uses them.”
“Decorative greenery.”
‘Us’ couldn’t have meant necromancers, as Lestrange wasn’t one. It left Harry confused as to what other ‘us’ he was being drawn into. “Okay,” was all he said instead.
When Uncle Tony switched back to that other language to continue the discussion, Harry looked down at his wand. His pretty and strange wand, and Merlin he had never been this fond of strangeness before. Because this strangeness was his friend, and— Hadn’t the witch said that the olive tree wood his wand was made of stood for friendship? Not to mention that amid all that talk about lightning and fire and elements, she had said that the creature whose feather was at the core of his wand was also some sort of a protector. It had to mean something, right?
“I also broke into the ministry, interrupted a hearing, knocked out Umbridge – she deserved it, let me tell you – stole a necklace off her neck and escaped while polyjuiced as someone else,” Harry added, hoping to somehow make Malfoy understand that for him to become an Auror wasn’t… as obvious of a choice as some people believed. “And that was just last year.”
”Maybe?” Ron said hesitantly. ”I don’t know if I can return right away... there’s so much for my family to do, and...” Funerals, Harry realized. Ron must have been thinking of Fred and George, and the funeral, and how on earth could he keep going on when Harry, who didn’t have family members dying in the final battle, was barely functioning?
,” Uncle Tony said, as if that explained anything.
“Of course,” Harry replied, cutting a piece of his tvorog and caviar blini, thinking that if keeping secrets was all it took for Uncle Tony to tell him interesting things, then surely it was easiest thing to promise.
She never did, anymore.
is without reason. The Dark Lord - and I hate to sound like Bellatrix - was exceptionally educated when it came to these issues.”
"Is this going to be taught at Hogwarts?" Harry asked then. It seemed like such simple but useful logic, and it was hard to tell if it was something everyone was going to know or if it was something he could just... keep close to his heart and use to his advantage should he ever need to.
”Not really,” Malfoy replied with an awkward shrug. He fell silent for a moment, before he continued: ”It belonged to the aunt of my grandfather Abraxas Malfoy, Lady Madeleine. She was said to be quite sickly and enjoyed a rather solitary lifestyle.”
”Very well,” Malfoy said, still eyeing Harry with a look of suspicion, as if he wasn’t sure of what to expect. He then nodded curtly, before leading Harry to a door right between the two bedrooms. ”The bathroom was recently renovated and doesn’t need touching up, unless you’d like a different look.”
But if his godfather so desired, he could sit through whatever lessons these were going to be. And maybe – just maybe – he would learn something useful after all.
Hesitantly Harry left his room, leaving his slippers behind in an attempt to move as quietly as he possibly could. The knew which floorboards to avoid, though he doubted that Lily could’ve heard their quiet creaking over her cries. Despite this, Harry inched through the corridor carefully, stopping by the top of the stairs. From there he could look at the hall below, where he could now see Lily holding James’s torso to her chest, rocking back and forth while wailing by the fireplace. The man’s legs were in pieces, both feet lying by the bottom of the stairs - a parody of a pair of shoes. Had he tripped? Had he been trying to crawl to the fireplace before he gave up?
way of thinking. You’ll encounter more people like that, but in the end their opinions do not matter. None of the Houses offer something the others don’t, and ultimately how the graduating students differ has nothing to do with which House they used to be in.”
”Hi Dudley,” Harry replied, ignoring Piers entirely, before he turned back to Petunia. When he spoke, his voice was calm and light. ”I didn’t expect much from you and your husband. But I did expect more than to be locked in your cupboard or have bars in my windows and barely any food to eat. I’m grateful to the Weasleys, because they’ve been more of a family and you ever have.”
”Careful, the stairs were caught in a blast, so parts are missing,” Hermione said, still leading Harry forward. As they kept walking, they met more and more people. Some tried to talk to Harry directly, but Ron was there, quick and ready to shield him from them. He was grateful - Harry really didn’t think he could talk right now. He kept thinking of Ron’s brothers, and—
love anyone that much.
“Hmm?” Nott looked at him, though he still maintained his leaning position over the body. “What is it?”
“She can’t enter your room now, even if the door is open,” Uncle Tony said. “No one but you and I can enter this room.”
Harry wasn’t sure what to make of what the woman had told them, and was grateful when Uncle Tony once again took on the task of asking questions.
“You’re absolutely sure that you’re fine with having my taste all over your home?” Malfoy asked, strangely insistent on his point of conflict. “Are you certain?”
And, Merlin, had
Uncle Tony had promised to help, but he had also said that there was quite a bit that Harry would just have to learn on his own. Harry hadn’t discussed the issue further - it was difficult to talk about things his godfather didn’t wish to talk about - but suspected that there was a lot that Uncle Tony wasn’t telling him.
“Y-yes Master Harry.”
“They don’t mind that we enter like this?” Harry asked, warily following his godfather towards and through one of the gates, and into the city. He didn’t know what to expect, but the moment he saw the tangle of alleys narrow corridors and closely huddled buildings, it felt… just
“Right.”
“He’s a necromancer,” Dolohov said. “They experience the world differently.”
He didn't know if Lily would try to look for him - if she was going to do that, then checking under the bed was surely the first thing she'd do. Merlin - he'd really have to figure out a better hiding place for the future, just in case. It couldn't be anything obvious, like the wardrobe or under the bed where he was now.
Harry nodded. He wasn’t sure if he’d be actually able to understand everything, but how could he predict that when he didn’t know what Uncle Tony wanted to tell him in the first place?
, even though
Antonin Dolohov didn’t care for the boy’s parents, but he did have a place in his heart for his strange little godson. And it what that place that flooded with apprehension as he thought of the people he would have to introduce Harry to. It was necessary - allowing the gift of necromancy to remain unharnessed would be a blasphemy - and yet…
"Inner elbows," Bellatrix then continued. "Disable your opponent's arms and prevent them from casting any spells that need finesse of movement. I'd always recommend doing this first, especially with opponents who know more spells that you do."
“I wasn’t aware Nott would be here,” she said, her voice higher than Harry had expected.
”We know, mate,” Ron replied with a grin, and reached to ruffle Harry’s hair. ”We know you’re a bleeding heart, all right?”
“Uncle Tony!”
And though his godfather had clearly meant well with what he’d said, sometimes… sometimes Harry wished he could’ve slept like other people did.
“Lily isn’t good at words anymore,” Harry replied. “But you’re welcome to try.”
necromancy certainly is. Thanks to the fools fascinated by inferi, we’ll need to have those laws repealed first before we go touting the boy around.”
“I was here a week ago.”
“You did,” Harry said. “You still do, I think.”
“It’ll be fine,” Lily cooed, eyes fixed on James again, clearly fading out of the conversation already. “People won’t focus on Harry. They will have the Boy-Who-Lived there. People will focus on that boy, not our Harry.”
already since we all started teaching him. The boy has had virtually no guidance in how to behave around others prior to his lessons, and that’s been the case since long before James Potter died.”
“The Imperius Curse,” Uncle Tony started, his voice low and steady as he spoke, “is unique among the three, as it is that only one that can be defended against. When correctly cast, it places the target completely under the caster’s control, which can last for decades. I could have you eating your own arm and you wouldn’t even hesitate.”
—and he could still hear the wailing. That sound must have been what finally woke him up, right? Someone - Lily,
”No, that’s not what I meant,” Harry hurried to reply. ”But that you’d know of your family from many generations before you - that’s brilliant.”
Harry was still unsure of what was actually being discussed, and felt grateful when Healer Crabbe handed him the small bowl of Floo Powder. He couldn’t get to the fireplace fast enough, wanting nothing more than to leave the tense atmosphere behind.
Harry fell silent, unsure of what to respond to that. He didn’t know what to think. He
What would happen to Harry if someone found out? Would Harry be sent to live somewhere else, with a family that would just be scared of him, wary of him, and make him feel like an intruder? Because at the end of the day Harry knew that there was - at least for now - no better place for him than the House.
”Thanks,” Harry said, and reached to uncover the plate, pleased to see the slice of pie that had been left for him. There was nothing better than Mrs. Weasley’s food, honestly. ”How come you didn’t go with everyone else?”
Vernon,” Petunia said weakly. ”He’s your—”
“Antonin,” she said, the sweetness of her smile twisted by the rest of her appearance. “We’ve missed you! You haven’t been here in so long—”
“What about the deactivation word?” Harry asked, deciding to look up what in the world the Imperius curse was – he had never heard of it before, and it sounded terrible already.
“Don’t look down, baby necromancer,” Bellatrix cooed. “What’s down will look up, and you won’t like that.”
“What… what do you mean?”
“But why is that
“Fine, but I will pick his tutors and arrange for his schooling outside of Hogwarts. You will not interfere with any of it, and will not be hindering our schedules.”
There were footsteps that belonged to nobody that would roam at night, the faint humming of the walker alluring and repulsive all in one. And when the morning would come, Harry would still be awake, expecting the house-elves that would come to wake him up, shaking as they approached, fearing him as much as he feared the House.
Harry thought, looking at his bare feet. They didn’t hurt, which surely was an indication that he hadn’t walked for a long time before reaching this place, right? The ground let out wet squishing sounds as he hesitantly moved a few steps before stopping again. He could barely see clearly two feet in front him, the treetops shielding away the moonlight that perhaps could’ve helped him figure out where to go.
“Well then,” Healer Crabbe said, stepping out of the fireplace behind him. “This is the waiting room. Follow me, I’ll take you to my office instead.”
Maybe the stars were aligned, somewhere in space. Because in that moment, Harry felt happy.
His mum certainly wouldn’t.
Harry missed the days when his parents had been strict with him. Now no one told him when to sleep or eat or wash unless his godfather came to visit, and
with her.
“This is Caspar Crabbe,” Uncle Tony said, gesturing towards the man waiting for them in Uncle Tony’s office. The first thing Harry noticed was a bright orange tie that did no favours to the puke yellow robes of the wizard greeting them. The man put down a cup of tea he had been holding and nodded his head, his gelled greying blond hair not moving and inch with the motion. His droopy brown eyes were fixed on Harry, and a smile appeared on his unsettlingly wide mouth.
. “How does that make you feel?”
”That sounds nice,” Hermione said approvingly. ”Aside from the parts that need fixing, what is it like?”
Harry wondered, remaining quiet as the others continued discussing some sort of a schedule for him.
But what else was he supposed to do, really?
hot and sweaty, becoming increasingly uncomfortable as he continued his way. He had no idea if he was heading towards the right direction, but what else could he do but try?
“Okay.” Harry’s little face was serious, and it was impossible to tell what he really thought of the things he was hearing. “In the letter they listed things I’d need to buy. Probably from Diagon Alley?”
“A sickle for your thoughts?” Dolohov said, appearing out of nowhere. Ellis shrugged.
“All right,” said Harry, hands on his lap, barely able to hold himself back from hunching his shoulders and looking down. He tried to search for the right words to continue with, eventually settling with: “She’s never done that before. The whole… waiting thing.”
“Mud and gypsum,” Uncle Tony said, leading Harry forward as he continued: “the whole town is made of that and reinforced with magic the kind of which even I cannot comprehend. The entrance that we’ll be using is the sixth one, and should be— Ah, there!”
”Very sure,” Harry said. ”I love Hogwarts, but I need some time away.”
”Harry,” Hermione said, her brown eyes bright with tears, reaching him mere seconds after Ron. There was dirt on her face, but she looked unharmed. ”Harry, it’s over. You did it. We all did it. It’s over.” Her voice was shaky and shrill, as if she couldn’t believe the words she was saying.
Malfoy’s shoulders hunched up for a moment, in a clear gesture of discomfort, before he turned to Harry with a sneer on his face. “I suppose Saint Potter would forgive someone who treid to kill him. Repeatedly. You’d forgive… you’d have forgiven him too for what he did, wouldn’t you?”
On that day, Harry didn’t wake up for dinner. He slept until half past eleven the next morning, and woke up feeling disoriented and guilty for the hours he wasted.
Harry startled when he heard Nott’s voice the moment he stepped out of the fireplace. He saw the man standing a few steps away, dressed in robes so dark it was hard to tell their colours. His round eyes were fixed on Harry, before the man gestured for him to follow. And Harry did.
”I’m meeting Malfoy again next week,” Harry said, changing the subject back to his project, in hopes of diffusing another argument between his best friends. ”On Tuesday. At the cottage, that is. He didn’t say if it had a name, so I’ll have to use the portkey he gave me.”
”Your taste is abysmal as always,” Malfoy replied, though it didn’t sound half as mean as some of his insults in the past. ”Any decorative details will be up to you. I dread to see what you’ll come up with.”
“Failing is very unlikely,” Crabbe said soothingly. “Your godfather has told me that you’ve studied quite a bit.”
The thoughts of how his mother walked were pushed aside as Harry could finally crawl out from under his bed. He didn't know where to even begin explaining what had been happening so far in his day, and yet he knew that he'd have to. Uncle Tony wasn’t going to let this slide, that much was clear.
Hopeful, and a fool for it.
turning to look at Uncle Tony. “He understands you, you know.”
”Can I see it?”
“Incredible,” Harry said, picking up another piece of his blini and eating it, wondering if his own little teeth could really chew through the skin of his arm to eat it, even with a curse in place.
“You need much more than a wand,” Antonin replied, wondering if there was a particular reason for the boy’s focus on a wand in particular. Then again, with Lily still roaming around, was it any wonder? “We can do that next Saturday. I’ll come by Mordred’s Mend and have a word with your mother before we go.”
Ellis saw Dolohov’s expression souring, and eventually the man shrugged. Ellis continued: “That boy has been living for almost half a year with his rotting father and his insane mother - whose conduct, let me remind you, is
Ginny fell silent for a few moments, knowing what Harry was referring to. The smile on her face was small, but genuine. ”I don’t think you’re in love with me, Harry.”
Like how far he’d turn his head before moving his body. Or how hard he’d dig his fingers in through an open wound of whatever body they were observing. The passion with which he spoke of the dead and the dying was almost tangible. And he just… never seemed to run out of friends who just happened to be morticians with fresh corpses conveniently and readily available for them to poke at.
”It’s fine, thank you,” Harry cut in, shaking his head. ”I  just came to say goodbye one last time. Good luck with, um, your life, Dudley. Take care.”
“So, you’ve been having brunches with McGonagall lately, eh?” Ron suddenly said, turning to Hermione. “Talk about taking all courses at once again?”
The late morning of his birthday found Harry sitting on the roof of Mordred’s Mend, leaning against the chimney, watching the endless sea of dark treetops. He had sneaked there through a window he had dared to open in the attic, vowing to make sure he’d close it on the way back. He just… he couldn’t remain inside. Not when his mother had somehow remembered what day it was today, and was looking for him.
“I disagree, but go on,” Harry instantly said, causing Malfoy to let out a laugh, strangely enough.
The next time Harry made his way to the cottage, Malfoy was kneeling by the fireplace, talking about some runes with two sullen goblins. Not knowing - not daring to find out, either - if the goblins would resent him from his stunt at Gringotts, Harry decided to wait outside.
What would she see?
”Salmon,” Petunia said sharply. ”The colour was salmon.”
"Okay," Harry said, once again not really liking whatever lifestyle Bellatrix was apparently imagining for him. "Thank you."
Merlin, he didn’t want to make any decisions right now.
Harry shrugged, and thought about Riddle. Voldemort. Thought about all the awful things he had done, and all the things that shaped him into the person he ended up becoming. “I asked him to regret the things he had done. I don’t think I could have forgiven him, however.”
“Perhaps,” Antonin replied. “They’d be fools to do so, but idiocy isn’t uncommon. Therefore, the less you interact with those peers of yours, the better. You and they are made
“We’ll begin starting from next Monday,” Uncle Tony said, now looking at Harry, making the boy straighten up and listen again. “Harry, you’ll be Flooing here on your own for your first lesson.”
“I like this plan,” Harry said, nodding. “I feel like Hermione wouldn’t like it, though. She’d just… deal with all this in some sensible way.”
'I need her to leave,' Harry thought, wondering if there was anything left of James for Harry to use to lure Lily away. He didn't dare to risk it, however - the last thing he wanted was to have James dropping body parts in this room. Circe, just having Lily here felt awful. As if his own safe space was being invaded, and he didn't like that.
Ellis Nott found odd creatures to be infinitely worthier of his time than many others. He didn’t find the boy particularly bright, but at least he was willing to read and learn and keep trying. He asked questions, but didn’t seem to quite grasp his own situation, or the importance of the people who had agreed to teach him. Regardless, he was respectful and quiet, always on time, always with his homework carefully completed.
He doubted that anything could change his mother either.
He wasn't going to leave his hiding place unless he'd absolutely have to, and if that meant that he'd be skipping out on his lesson with Mrs. Goyle, then so be it. With any luck, Uncle Tony would come and fetch him and somehow fix this situation that Harry had found himself in unexpectedly. And if Uncle Tony didn't realize that Harry hadn't attended Mrs. Goyle's lecture, surely Mr. Crabbe would alert him to Harry's absence.
“Yes,” Uncle Tony said, nodding. “Today the use of any of those three will lead to a life sentence in Azkaban. Do you know what they do?”
“Our Lord never wasted time hesitating,” Bellatrix continued. “I expect that of you as well - unrestrained effort, baby necromancer. The moment you hesitate, I’ll drop you into a well so deep and dark you won’t be able to climb your way out of it, and leave you there to rot. Don’t think I won’t. Even Dolohov wouldn’t be able to find you.”
“Speaking of,” Ellis said. “Harry.”
There were no people wandering around, no dirt on the streets, no open vendors or noise. It felt as close to peace as Harry could possibly imagine.
“I mean. Is it— I just… I don’t even know what I’m thinking, and—”
Harry mustered up a smile. He didn’t believe in lifelong anything - his parents hadn’t kept any of the friends they’d met at Hogwarts - but nodded regardless. Crabbe wasn’t a fool, but he just… he didn’t know how things went in Harry’s life. And without that, most of his advice was left aside, discarded as useless. Because despite how long they’d been doing this, Harry still wasn’t convinced that he needed a therapist.
“Partly,” Uncle Tony replied. “But mostly it is about this talent that you have - this talent that you would have regardless of whether or not you’d have chosen to bring your father back. You have a splendid gift, but for it to serve you well in life, you need to learn things ordinary schools cannot teach you. Do you understand me so far?”
The place didn’t look like much from the outside, but on the inside it was nothing like anything Harry had seen. It was large and bright, with round tables and pretty chairs and bright green plants everywhere. It wasn’t full, but even the presence of the few people there was strangely exciting and scary. He didn’t think he’d ever seen this many living people at once, and though Mr. Crabbe had discussed this issue with him, they hadn’t done any actual practice to get Harry used to people.
”Oh,” was all Harry could think of saying. He then looked down at his pie and began eating, feeling... off. He didn’t know why.
“I just…” Harry looked at his melting ice cream with a frown on his face, before blurting out: “I’m just so tired of being anxious all the time, you know? Always something to worry about. Always losing sleep, never being able to focus on things, just because there’s so much to worry about. I want some time to not worry, you know? Not worry about grades, not worry about people, not worry about anything. And I don’t think that that trying anything with Malfoy - if he’s even interested - is going to help with that.”
“Your mother was looking for you,” Uncle Tony said, pulling Harry closer when the boy reached him. “Are you well?”
?” Harry blurted out, frustrated. “What’s so scary about
”Know thy enemy, and all that,” Ginny said. ”Malfoy sure isn’t wasting any time.”
Harry paused at that, caught off guard by the question. “What?”
How was he supposed to explain how any of
Harry frowned.
”Hey, has either one of you had tea yet?” Dudley said, his voice loud in the kitchen. He was nervous, and wasn’t acting at all like the Dudley Harry remembered, but he did know that his cousin had changed for the better. A bit, at least. ”Mum? Harry? Piers can make—”
“Nott,” Antonin said. “Welcome.”
But, overall he was nice. Harry liked him.
Crabbe fell silent then, staring at Uncle Tony with disbelief. Harry hated to admit that while he
Meeting Malfoy again, and on purpose this time, was such an odd experience. Harry wasn’t sure how to feel about it, other than that he felt
seemed to have burrowed deep into his bones. But at least he had had enough time to rest, get cleaned up, eat, and rest some more. He could keep his eyes open and talk, if he needed to.
”What about us?” Harry asked suddenly. ”Will you and I get better?”
“Merlin,” Uncle Tony hissed. “Between you and Ellis— fine, yes. He hasn’t yet, but I’ll look into it. Looks healthy to me, though, so I won’t be in a rush to arrange that.”
“It’ll be good with elemental spellwork,” was the response. “Fire spells and such. Healing, too. It’s not too good for dark curses – especially those meant to control other people in any way.”
He didn’t trust the House. And he knew better than to mistake the Woods for an ally. But at least this place was
”The moment he died, we could all feel it,” Hermione replied, reaching to take his glasses and wipe them clean. ”His followers started apparating away, but some already— Ron, were you in the Great Hall earlier? Bellatrix is dead—”
Uncle Tony would arrive - sometimes the man turned up early, sometimes in the afternoon - but wanted to be ready as soon as he did.
”Thank you,” Hermione said, and when she stood up, Harry and Ron followed suit. ”Thank you, really. For everything.”
that that’s how trees were supposed to be, and yet… their stillness felt temporary, as if they were simply imitating ordinary trees, waiting for Harry to no longer be wary of them.
”That is fine,” McGonagall said. She understood, Harry knew that. And he appreciated her saying what she said, her tone dry and understanding, but not particularly sympathetic. She said it as if there was nothing to be sympathetic about, and for the first time since Voldemort died, Harry felt a spark of satisfaction at something. ”How are the three of you holding up?”
“Then it just goes back to what you want to do,” Ron said. “You could wait until he’s done with the house, before you suggest anything—”
”Nonsense,” Hermione said instantly. ”Malfoy will hardly try to trick Harry now! Not when he has so much to lose! Besides, he owes Harry his life.”
Well, now… that wasn’t something Antonin wanted to get into. “Your parents had no strong political affiliations at all. They chose to simply remain aside throughout the war and focus their energy on raising you and maintaining a peaceful existence.”
“But it matters to Bellatrix so much, and even though Crabbe tried to be neutral about it, he also definitely wants me to end up in Slytherin,” Harry pointed out. Antonin sneered.
“So it’s less about death itself, and more about the things you will lose if you die?” Harry asked, frowning.
”Things will get better,” Ginny said quietly, and Merlin, if that didn’t make Harry feel even more guilty. He hadn’t lost two brothers. ”That’s what we all have to believe.”
. Every moment you can. Every moment you stand still. Close your eyes and open yourself up to that world.”
And yet, he did these
Harry had been visiting a real estate agency in Diagon Alley, looking to buy himself a house of some sort. While he loved the Weasleys and the Burrow, he knew he couldn’t just stay there for much longer. It wasn’t— they hadn’t— Mrs. Weasley had tried to argue and convince Harry to just stay, but he couldn’t. Not after the funeral. Not with Percy’s misplaced guilt and Mrs. Weasley’s valiant effort to not be crushed by her grief. Not when every time he saw Mr. Weasley returning from another long day at the ministry, more exhausted and looking older than the day before, he felt responsible for it. What if he had killed Voldemort sooner? What if he hadn’t won the Triwizard Tournament? What if he hadn’t—
“You son will eventually be leaving to attend school,” Uncle Tony reminded her. “Despite what I suggested last time—”
Harry kept his eyes on the newspaper, and the picture of Draco Malfoy. Why was everyone dealing with their lives after Voldemort better than him? Why wasn’t he good enough to keep himself up and running? ”I wonder if he’s going to go back to Hogwarts.”
"Ah, sorry, mate. I meant it sounds small for Malfoys to have owned in the first place."
Her eyes were wide and dark, pale face framed by wild black curls, red lips pursed into a pout. She walked like his lullabies flowed, and she saw him like no one else had. Harry stared at her, a melody teasing his mind with every step she took closer.
“I still think, though, that none of that was quite as frightening as the time I killed a basilisk,” Harry continued. “Though it worked out in the end, since we needed basilisk venom to get rid of a horcrux.”
She certainly was present enough to argue against Uncle Tony’s constant efforts to convince her to send Harry to Durmstrang instead of Hogwarts. Harry wasn’t sure why Uncle Tony needed Lily’s permission - he certainly never needed it for anything else - but suspected it was just one of those things that would need a guardian’s permission rather than simply a godfather’s.
”It’s a bit odd that he’s there,” Ron said. ”I mean, in person, you know? You’d think he’d have someone else doing the job for him.”
“Of course,” Crabbe replied, eyes still fixed on Harry, making the boy resist the urge to shift nervously or look away. “Has he received a physical health evaluation?”
“You will find that out eventually,” Antonin replied, sounding smug now. “So, interested?”
“Lily!” Uncle Tony snapped, his voice loud enough to startle Harry - especially as the man was still facing him. “Harry will go to Hogwarts, I’ve accepted that. But I will
Footsteps. Shuffling footsteps, familiar footsteps that hadn't come to his room in ages. She was walking in the hallway, slowly but steadily coming closer, and there was something terrifying about that.
Well, no. Not exactly
“All right,” Malfoy said, taking a few steps closer, stopping right in front of Harry. His palms, when her reached up to cradle Harry’s face, were dry and cold. “I expect more attention than you have given me so far, Potter. And I demand responses to my letters within three days.”
“If friends is all you want us to be, then I’ll happily leave it at that.”
“We’re some fifty miles North of Banchory,” Malfoy said. “This area is called Taernsby. Not that many know of it - not many live in this area, as you probably guessed by now.”
“I don’t think he knows there’s something to be waited for.”

was the one who— “What’s going on?”
It wasn’t something Harry was used to - eating out, that was. In fact, he’d never done it before, and wasn’t sure what to expect. And so by the time he had washed up, gotten changed, and then taken by his godfather to some café in Moscow, he was quickly becoming distracted from what had happened with Lily. He couldn’t
! And
”It’s all right,” Ginny replied. ”I suppose I, too, grew out of the need to be in a relationship right now.”
Harry thought, still watching his mother outside, now circling the fireplace Uncle Tony had connected to the Floo. There was no powder for her to use, however, and so Harry didn’t worry about where she’d end up.
The large house built of grey stone did not make for an inviting sight with its small windows and narrow doors and strange runes carved into the ground around it. Inside, the light wooden floors were polished and the frames that hung on the walls were void of paintings. And though the thick curtains covering the numerous small windows did nothing to silence the nightly tapping from outside, they did well enough to be kept up and closed, never to be taken down.
Harry took a deep breath, slowly and quietly, still trying to remain calm despite the fearful chaos inside his head. He resigned himself to staying where he was for the time being, desperately vowing to start keeping a knife near him at all times, just in case. After all in times like these, when he didn't even have a wand yet, all he could do was try and hit where it hurt, just like Bellatrix had taught him. He felt stupid for not having taken that precaution yet, as now he was left only with the option of remaining where he was, waiting to be rescued.
There were some truths he knew about the House, though he had never questioned why they had remained despite it all. It was as clear to him as anything - the sky was empty, the woods were dark, and the Potters lived in Mordred’s Mend. And just like he knew that, he knew that the birds with bent necks were looking at him, and that the house-elves were scared of him, that the portraits were empty because of him, and that the corridors in this House weren’t safe.
a necromancer is not illegal, in dear England
“Lily!”
Harry clenched his eyes shut and shook his head. He led out a quiet little groan, before blinking his eyes open and forcing the grimace that had taken over his face to disappear.
“I know you loathe children, but you do realize that he’s fully capable of comprehending what you’re saying even if you don’t talk to him directly?”
. He didn’t know if the other things – portraits and house-elves fleeing in fear at the sight of him – had anything to do with it.
”Ron, his hair was looking just fine,” Hermione huffed, slapped Ron’s hand away, and tried to comb Harry’s hair back to how it was before with her fingers. Harry couldn’t help but smile, a sudden surge of happiness catching him by surprise. The warmth of Ron’s hand, the gentleness of Hermione’s fingers, this light-filled moment and the food they could enjoy in peace... Merlin, wasn’t
On Saturday Harry found James’s arm outside his bedroom.
”Who knows about their reasons, really,” Harry said. ”I wonder if Malfoy will be going back to Hogwarts to finish his studies.”
That meant - it
“I do. Compared to everywhere else I’ve been, I like home the most.”
“I know what you mean,” Harry agreed, “but honestly, I think I would have regretted it immediately. I just… I don’t think I’m ready for anything too stressful, you know?”
For all he knew, this Dark Lord that Bellatrix kept harping about was dead.
But Uncle Tony was a patient, clever man. He had told Lily that they would continue the discussion next Saturday, and now Harry counted the days because… because what if it happened? What if Uncle Tony convinced Lily to send Harry to a school somewhere away from Mordred’s Mend?
“I do.”
“He’s been keeping busy, hasn’t he?”
“Unfortunately your mother does not quite understand that,” Uncle Tony continued. “And she has decided that when your formal schooling begins next year, you will be attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. They will not teach you anything about necromancy there.”
Harry nodded, unsure if he was expected to say anything. He knew – he wasn’t sure how, but he could tell – that Ellis Nott was not like him. Maybe he
“Is that why you joined him?” Harry asked. Antonin almost smiled, appreciating the question as much as the anti-eavesdropping runes etched onto the tables.
“You’re not going anywhere,” Malfoy agreed with a shrug. “But I am. I’m going to Beauxbatons next week, where I’ll be staying for a year or so. I don’t know if I’ll come back during the holidays.”
strange, she’d been in a daze of some sort, not caring about anything that happened around her. Now she was angry and aware, and more disconnected from reality than ever before. After Harry had seen her crawling on all fours across the living room, he’d told the house-elves to keep her occupied every time he had to make the short trip from his room to the fireplace. And the shaking little creatures had agreed, preferring the company of that— of his
“I broke out of Gringotts riding a dragon. That’s why they have recruitment problems.”
necromancy, its history and theories as much as I myself know,” Nott said. “But that… other thing with the house-elves and portraits? I know nothing of that.”
In Hillcrest, Harry was led to his godfather’s study again. Walking through the dark corridors was now more familiar than it had ever been, and he had become quite good at ignoring the things no one else could see or hear either. It was even easier to ignore the empty portrait frames and the disappearing house-elves.
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Hermione said, before she remembered something and turned to Harry. “You know, I asked her about whether or not Malfoy will be coming back to Hogwarts. He won’t, is what she told me. Apparently he will wrap up his studies in Beauxbatons.”
”Terrible, was it?” Petunia sneered. ”You should be grateful that we even took you in.” He words were harsh, but there was something off in the way she spoke. The contempt that Harry had grown used to, wasn’t there, and he wasn’t sure how to feel about its absence. Or how to respond to his aunt, who followed him as he walked past her towards the cupboard under the stairs. The place hadn’t been used as anything but an actual cupboard for years, but Merlin... he just couldn’t move past it without touching the door and thinking of the times he was trapped on the other side of it. The renovators hadn’t changed the door, and Harry almost hoped that they would’ve.
”You changed the kitchen,” was what Harry responded with, as soon as he saw the tiled floor and light yellow walls. ”It’s no longer pink.”
But not forever.
“Today I will take you to meet two friends of mine,” Uncle Tony said, kneeling in front of Harry to maintain eye-contact. “You cannot tell you mother anything of what will happen today - she would not understand. But allowing you to continue to live like this, with capabilities left unrealized, is a waste of great magic.”
Uncle Tony looked at him then, no signs of his earlier annoyance. On the contrary, the man appeared almost sympathetic - something Harry rarely witnessed. It seemed, however, that despite it being Elli Nott who was obsessed with death, it was Uncle Tony who really understood Harry’s feelings on this matter. Encouraged by the nod, Harry continued:
“I insist, Lily.”
”Considering the situation his mother was in at the time, he couldn’t possibly refuse,” Hermione countered. ”And trust me, I’m not particularly fond of him either. However, we must put conscious effort into moving on from past grievances. I think it’s fantastic that he’s taking such an active role in fixing the house for Harry before handing it over to him.”
Harry nodded, and held back a groan when Nott began piling books in front of him. The man was clearly knowledgeable and eager to teach him about history and the theories relating to necromancy, and the more questions Harry asked, the more pleasant he appeared to become. Harry didn’t
“Very,” Nott admitted, before turning back to Harry. “Tell me, boy, what do you know of necromancy?”
”I...” Harry struggled in coming up with words to say, before he simply sighed deeply. He couldn’t deny her words - not when he couldn’t sort out his feelings towards his
Harry shrugged.
Circe, what a life.
“It’s for the better,” Harry told him. “We should go now. To— where?”
“Good,” Uncle Tony said, before standing up. “Let’s go, then. The sooner we leave, the better.”
He was a fool.
“Dolohov,” a woman behind the counter said, before continuing in a language Harry didn’t recognize. She was an exceptionally tall woman, with dark hair braided on top of her head, wrapped in a fabric that shimmered in the light. Uncle Tony replied in that same language, and after a few minutes of talking, Harry felt his godfather’s grip on his shoulder.
and his mother had been so
”You can do it if you’d like,” Harry offered, suspecting that Malfoy would find some bizarre joy in deciding how pointy the window frames ought to be. ”I don’t really care, to be honest.”
“Every new student is nervous,” Crabbe continued. “Try to look forward to whatever you might experience at Hogwarts. Most of us have found our lifelong friends and partners there.”
“Oh yes, absolutely,” Harry said, touching a cabinet handle made to look like a curled dragon’s tail. Merlin, it was beautiful. “Draco, this is… exactly what I need. It’s perfect. It’s better than anything I had imagined.” The whole cottage was filled with light, rays of sun dancing across wooden surfaces, reflecting off the white walls and adding life to every corner that they reached.
"But with no wand," Bellatrix then said, "we have to improvise." She then let go of him, and with a few steps came to stand right by the picture that, from what Harry could see now, was even taller than her. The man depicted had dark hair and grey eyes, and looked vaguely familiar, somehow.
‘No,’ Malfoy says. He takes advantage of Harry’s momentary surprise and grabs his wrists. With one fluid movement, he swivels them around and pinions Harry against the bricks. ‘This is more what I had in mind,’ he says, his breath hot on Harry’s skin.
‘I love it when you talk dirty,’ Draco teased. He licked again, lapping at the rim and holding Harry’s squirming hips tight. Water ran over the crevice, mixing with Draco’s saliva. Draco pressed his face closer, his tongue insisting and demanding, seeking access to Harry’s most intimate part. Now Draco knew why Harry had said he was obsessed with it; he couldn’t imagine a more profound joy than reaching inside Harry with his tongue, tasting his freshly-soaped skin, smelling his musky scent; a pleasure marred by the persistent question of how Harry would feel if he knew he was with Impostor Draco and not the man he loved, the Silver Hero. Harry bent for Coward Draco, and Death Eater Draco, and Bad-Decisions Draco, and Almost-Killed-Dumbledore-And-Ron-And-Katie Draco, and he wondered how Harry would feel if he knew whose tongue was actually in his arse.

The air inside the compartment feels suddenly tense. Dean’s absence feels heavy, and Seamus looks like he’s suddenly remembering why. Neville’s eyes flick from him to the door, as if measuring the distance.

There’s silence for a long moment as they both take a bite of their sandwiches and chew.

It had made Hermione absolutely livid, but Ron had been oddly pragmatic about it all.
The afternoon light seems somehow muted as it streams through the tower window, the air smelling sharp and biting with the promise of a cold night. Harry slips the stone into a pocket, but can’t seem to help touching it occasionally between the little silences in his and Neville’s conversation. It’s warm on his fingertips, even after so long away from the press of his skin, like it somehow soaked up all the heat he radiated as he slept and stored it like a battery.
“Because it felt like a hallucination. He wasn’t
“Harry,
Draco flips him off. “Eat shit.”
And then, Halloween happens.
Draco spends all of Halloween day practicing his violin playing in between classes. He’s out of practice, but he was in Azkaban for three months. He thinks being in prison is enough of an excuse to not get his hour of practice a day.
Malfoy’s lip twitches and despite how infuriating his pointy face is, the part of Harry holding back in caution settles. It’s still Malfoy, and Harry has been fighting and beating Malfoy since he was eleven years old. There are very few things he can say he is more familiar with than being at Malfoy’s wandpoint.
Not that they couldn’t handle themselves. Greg, broad shouldered and
To make things even worse, there’s just so much
He lays there, safe in the Gryffindor dorms again, staring at the canopy for a long time.)
“Harry? You right, mate?”
Luna frowns thoughtfully, before suddenly lighting up. “Did you take a hagstone with you to the ritual tonight?”
“We love you, Harry. So much. We’ll be thinking of you the entire time.”
And Draco is their only heir.
He gets it, he’s reckless. But to be fair, so are pretty much all of his friends and most of the role models in his life, so he doesn’t know what they really expect from him.
“Blaise,” he asks. “Blaise.”
Harry: I notice EVERYTHING he does.
feeling the effects of the magic drain.
Truly, at this moment Harry hates all his friends. “They think that there’s something wrong with my face,” he sighs.
Ok. Sure.”
“It may sound alarming, but it’s fixable.” Malfoy shrugs.
Harry: what
If it had only been up to Draco, he would have capped it off once the participants numbered twenty-four, twelve Dark, twelve Light. But Susan had protested, and it was too important to have her as the leader of the Light contingent to force the situation. “A statement of outreach,” as Blaise had put it.
But he also doesn’t have to be stupid about it.
When he finally falls into his bed down in the dungeons, he dreams of the Great Hunt, hounds barking and howling into the dark night.
Malfoy lifts the stone to one eye and peers through it.
Harry takes a deep breath.
Luna grins, her face bright and luminous again, and something deep in Harry’s shoulders relaxes at the sight. “Yes! He’s a dear friend of mine and very kind.”
He shakes his head with a smile. “Thanks, ‘mione but I’m sure. I just… want to take a year off. Catch up on all the schoolwork I missed.”
They all straighten their backs and arrange themselves quickly into a star, following the lines laid out on the dance floor beneath their feet. Draco relinquishes his hold on his partner as she pulls away to hobble to the centre.
Blaise lets out a jaw-cracking yawn, wandlessly summoning his sandwich and pelting it at Draco’s face. “I’d rather watch you do it.”
Are Gryffindors incapable of wearing anything other than red?
Only Zabini sits in an armchair in the dark, dressed in white robes for some reason, with his profile dramatically lit up by the warm glow of the fireplace. He looks up at their entrance with narrowed eyes and puts one, regal finger against his mouth in warning. A languid gesture draws their attention to his lap where a small child, also in white, is improbably curled up, asleep.
“Thanks,” Harry nods.
He doesn’t know how long he spends doing that before he hears Seamus sigh heavily.
To be fair, Harry recognises that he holds a lot of responsibility for how combative their relationship had been in the past. Last night, Harry hadn’t had his wand with him, nor tried to pick a fight. But was that all it took to have a near civil interaction with Malfoy? Harry not being immediately antagonistic towards him?
By all rights, that fact alone should make Harry suspicious about the stone, considering his life-experience. The thought of leaving it behind on his nightstand made him feel slightly anxious, and
“Luna?” he splutters, catching a glimpse of wet blond hair through his blurry eyes. “What-“ he chokes as he coughs up more water.
So he shifts his weight to the balls of his feet and lifts his chin to Malfoy’s haughty smirk.
As if Draco could forget. The first time they’d had tea together, he had been delighted that there was someone who wouldn’t be able to judge him for how sweet he has his tea. But now he just winces in sympathy for her teeth.

Neville hums in thought. “Goyle, huh?”

Please let me know what you think about the characterisation so far, esp the gryffs. The snakes are so easy for me but *clenches fist* the lions, man. What do jocks even say???
he thinks.
“Most of them transferred to Durmstrang or Beauxbatons,” explains Neville. “Their reputations aren’t as good as Hogwarts' academically, but I’ll bet anything the atmosphere’s a whole lot friendlier.”
wrong with you. But right now? Nothing that isn’t fixable with a little rest and a little magic.”
He waves goodbye through the window as the train pulls out of the station, watching Ron and Hermione shrink into the distance.
She hovers there as a thousand voices join them, the smell of fresh earth and petrichor rich in the air. She holds out her hands, one to Draco, the other to Susan. They both close their eyes, reach into something that sits between atoms, just underneath the space around them, and
Waiting.
And Draco? Well.
But Theo had asked them to. “I remember how I felt, that first time,” he’d said when Draco visited him in prison, with a look in his eyes that he hadn’t realised was missing in the last three years. “How scared I was. How
, Harry thinks, as he’s tugged through the darkened halls of the castle.
Some of the mess inside his head must show on his face, because Malfoy’s expression turns from calculating to something that could be interpreted as sympathetic. Possibly. Knowing Malfoy, it’s likely closer to pitying.
A grunt comes from the other bed.
“Then we’ll teach you,” Draco says, crouching down. “If you need help hexing your enemies you can come find us, though it’s best that you learn how to yourself so that when we leave, you won’t be defenceless.”
His mind abruptly draws a comparison to the Slytherin common rooms, Zabini in his armchair, the dark leather glossy in the firelight. He’d had his eyes on the entrances too.
“Luna
It drove Theodotus Nott mad, not that the elder Nott needed the catalyst. He had always been a special brand of crazy, even amongst the absolute lunatics that the Dark Lord had attracted to his side, especially towards the end. Lucius had never let him go alone to the Nott estate, always insisting that Theo come stay at the Manor instead if the two boys wanted to see each other.
Draco: Hi scared, I'm dad.
Having said that, Harry finds that his eighth year keeps him too busy to do much more than glance at the Map to figure out Malfoy’s whereabouts. He seems to spend most of his time outside of class either in the dungeons or the library, which was convenient, since Harry finds himself spending more time in the library this year than he ever had in his previous years.
He looks down to check and sees only white porcelain.
He suddenly wishes that Ron was here. His eyes start stinging. Before he knows it, he’s sitting up to pull Luna into his lap and bury his face into her hair. He’s crying too now, hard, and he feels Luna cry a little harder.
Greg aims the other one at the centre of Blaise’s back and it hits with a soft thud, rolling off to land on the floor. “Better eat that up before it gets cold.”
Draco: Because your real dad is trash.
Seamus splutters. “
Harry: He thinks no one would notice but I DID
, like he was a first year stepping onto the Hogwarts Express for the first time.
He follows Neville down to the common room, still thumbing over the stone, and they spend a few hours lounging quietly and playing cards, laughing at the bleary-eyed students who trickle in looking for food and wincing at loud noises. The fireplaces were all lit, with students clustered around all three in an attempt to beat back the cold of the late autumn afternoon. There’s a quiet air around the common rooms today, everyone speaking in hushed tones and huddled close, likely due to how gloomy it looks outside. The light that filters in through the windows is grey with how heavy the clouds hang in the overcast sky.
Malfoy jerks his foot away. “Come back later,” he snarls, voice rough from sleep. “I damn well
“Thank you, Madame Fiore.” Luna curtsies daintily and reaches a hand into her pocket, drawing it out to tuck a small, white blossom into the corner of the painting. “A token from us, in thanks.”
Blaise hums. “Selwyn was out as soon as he hit a flat surface.”
The other boys roar with laughter, and the last of the tension dissipates with it. They take turns making fun of Harry as he kicks them lightly in retaliation.
“Oh that’s silly. There’s nothing wrong with- Oh.” Her smile falls as she looks at his face. “That’s a problem,” she says, head tilted.
Luna frowns. “That early? On Samhain?”
It’s not enough, but he manages. He handles it.
Thus, Draco concludes that:
mouth, on the reflection droops, lips pulling impossibly low like it is melting off his face. Blood drips from the ends like candlewax onto the basin.
Oh, the blond one he knows. Garret Robinson. His little brother’s a Gryffindor too. Thomas, he thinks. Big for a twelve-year-old, with a habit of slouching to make himself look smaller. But his freckles made him look friendly unlike his older brother who’s built like a bear and does little to hide it.
“Pansy’s headed him off, but she said you’d better talk to him before dinner.”
Come to think of it, He’s not sure if the second years are any better. He’d have to ask Astoria and Pansy to watch out for the signs too.
He does his best to not let it show. “A favour.”
He checks, moving his legs sluggishly, trying to remember that they’re a part of him. The effort takes him further into the lake and before he fully realises it, the water is at his shoulders.
percent of businesses across the British Isles are currently entangled within Malfoy affairs and Malfoy money. A not inconsiderable number of French businesses are also still affiliated with the Malfoys, despite them having mostly pulled out of the country several generations ago.
“It always is.” The woman sighs. “Very well then. What message would you like delivered in the middle of the night? I will not tolerate any more love poems, for Merlin’s sake. All of you teenagers seem to think yourselves master wordsmiths, the way you carry on.”
Hufflepuff and Slytherin relations had always been friendly. They two houses were too similar to not get along, really. But after the war reputations had taken a hit and inviting the other houses to take part in a Samhain ritual would go a long way to fix that, at least amongst the purebloods who knows what it means to stand in the same space and breathe in each other’s magic.
“Tired, mostly. The mud-
He bows and says, “of course,” handing his violin over to Blaise with a nod to Susan Bones across the room, who briefly compensates for his exit with a refrain full of flourishes.
All that talk about ushering in a new era of magic supremacy. Draco had realised he probably wouldn’t even live to see it.
Harry sneers. “Fuck you too, Malfoy.” But Malfoy had already buried his head back under the pillows, holding his middle finger up at Harry while pulling his covers up from underneath Luna.
They all blink in unison.
. But there’s really no denying it once Luna takes a turn down a spiralling staircase and into a dimly lit hallway that he vaguely remembers from second year. It looks a lot more run-down than before, but he recognises the stone wall they stop in front of and the stretch of the hallway that leads further down into the dungeons beyond.
“Do you know why he’s all…
Draco blinks, affronted. “What’s wrong with you.”
Harry lets out an amused sound. “Sorry my face is bothering you, I guess.”
Robinson shrugs. “Got plenty. Oh, I think Lovegood was looking for you down by the kitchens. Don’t know where she is now though.”
Harry’s heart goes soft at the earnest expression on Neville’s face. “Thanks, mate,” he says, voice thick. He takes a moment to clear his throat. “I don’t… I don’t have the words yet, but I’ll tell you if I do.” He’s mostly lying, but the way Neville’s face clears at his words makes him unable to regret it one bit.
Harry watches as she peers into each painting, nodding politely at those still awake, moving quickly as she searches for something specific. She stops completely at one with a plain wooden frame, tilting her head. By the time Harry is back at her side, she’d already lifted a fist to knock gently on the frame.
It takes a moment for his eyes to adjust, but the room they enter, (
. Thinking about Malfoy and Luna interacting in a friendly capacity had made him and the rest of their mutual friends’ heads hurt, so they’d simply ignored it, determined to get on with their own Malfoy-free lives.
Harry nudges him hard with a foot and they devolve into kicking each other for a while.
He doesn’t get to linger for long. Luna approaches the far bed and draws the curtains back.
The air shatters, the voices ceasing abruptly only to be replaced by the sound of the phantom wisps that swoop through the room from beneath black robes. The woman, the
Dragon, you said. Not
Which, after some thought, amounts to the same thing, really.
“Dragon. Wake up, Dragon.”
“Sure there is,” says Malfoy, eyes still on Harry and a sneer on his lips. “I’ve been saying that for years.”
She chuckles, voice creaking halfway through. Her hair is streaked with white. “My, you
“It’s still rather improbable,” says Luna, shaking her head. “And you can’t just go up to any old dragon to ask for favours. That’s just silly.”
And most of all, the evenings in the common room. Sitting by the fire, trying hard not to listen to the words in the bitter calls to action from across the room. Trying harder to not think about how the war never really ended for everyone, how he failed them. How he keeps failing them.
, he had thought, watching his father grovel on his hands and knees in front of a barefooted Dark Lord while promising his son’s loyal service as recompense for his failings.
Harry blinks, startled.
It’s almost time.
Anton’s taste in friends was worrying to be sure.
And he takes special care not to glance at his reflection on the glass pane.
“Young wizard’s first Samhain dance.” Draco smiles through a sigh. He’d have to watch Julian closely over the week, make sure he wouldn’t over-extend his magical reserves. The other first years too. It takes time to build it back up from a ritual as big as Samhain. They probably hadn’t yet learnt how to feel out the boundaries of their magic yet and would probably ignore the strain.
He feels a tugging sensation deep in his gut and can’t help but look back to the black water.
He moves her through the next spin with extra vigour in apology, hearing her laugh as he draws her back towards him. The smell of moss intensifies as her black robes swirl around her ankles. When she is in his arms again, she is older, the freshness of childhood having left her face entirely. “You carry my heart when you go, my lady,” he says, and is rewarded with another laugh.
“Luna,” he starts, hoarsely. “Why was I in the lake?”
As one, all the dancers begin to hum in tune with the thrum of magic in the air. The harmony rises and picks up in volume, even as a few people, first and second years mostly, fall to their knees with the weight of it. Draco grits his teeth and widens his stance.
Harry meets his gaze with narrowed eyes, his eyebrow lifted and hip cocked in challenge. It’s mostly habit at this point, and he knows he can’t back it up without his wand or his glasses. But he doesn’t know how else to hold his body here, in Malfoy’s room, looking at his sleep-mussed face as it clears and turns wary.
! You’ll be your entire, moronic, self again.”
He flicks a salute at her and turns to walk onto the train, afraid that if he looks back, he’ll never leave. He rides that feeling of newness as he picks a seat and stows his luggage, helping a few starstruck younger students with their lightening charms along the way.
