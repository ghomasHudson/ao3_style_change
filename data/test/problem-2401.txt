Malfoy traces the rim of his teacup. "I was going to say, after that it really wasn't safe to… The other Death Eaters… Well I'm sure it will come as no surprise to you that they didn't much like my 'kind', pure-blood or not."
"Yes, fine," Malfoy says, folding the sheet a little compulsively now. "Are you saying it's not good enough, apologizing because you wanted me to?"
Draco needn’t have worried, though. As soon as he’d finished hugging Harry, Ron stuck out his hand for Draco to shake.
He wasn’t worried – tiredness was almost synonymous with wizard pregnancy – but he still wanted to mention it to Mediwitch Hayes. It hadn’t helped one Sickle that August was turning into one of the hottest in living memory, and that the streets of London were a hot, sweaty sauna.
“That’s my elf’s doing,” Harry admitted. “Kreacher. He’s a bit of a git, but he’ll love you, Draco. The moment he gets a sniff of your pure-blood heritage he’ll not look twice at me again.”
“I gather this property isn’t to your liking either, Mr Malfoy?” Judith asked.
He likes kissing Malfoy because Malfoy always goes slow. Even when Harry wants to speed up, wants to lick his tongue all the way into Malfoy's mouth and grab at his clothes and pull him closer, Malfoy goes slow. He pulls back and nips at Harry's lips and sucks soft kisses behind Harry's ear, meeting Harry's rushing with thorough patience. Harry's not sure about a lot of things with Malfoy, but the fact that Malfoy is a great kisser is not one of them.
“It’ll be alright,” Draco said, dismissing Harry’s worries. “I haven’t been with anyone since Cormac.” He grimaced at the memory. “We both got tested for STDs – Muggle and magic – so you won’t catch anything, if that’s what you’re panicking about.” Draco sat up a little, all of a sudden feeling a little self-conscious about his nakedness.
will have plenty to say. The Puddlemere fans too. Bloody hell. Even the changing room. Everyone will want to add their two Groats, and we’ll be the talk of the League. All the old headlines… Sectumsempra. The Saviour and the Death Eater… Even Lucius, still rotting in Azkaban. Once we get seen together, there isn’t any going back. There won’t be a wix on Diagon that isn’t talking about us.”
Humming, Draco broke a couple of eggs into a pan, and set them frying with a tap of his wand. Feeling chipper and still rather randy from the night before, he switched on the wireless. Swaying his hips to the latest Weird Sisters’s song, Draco wondered whether Harry would wake soon, and what he’d say once he did.
Harry watches so intently he keeps having to remind himself to breathe. His heart aches in his chest and Harry can’t explain why. Harry watches them eat dinner, clean up after and sit on the sofa — Malfoy doing the crossword, Other Harry reading a small book, cover bent back in a way that the title is impossible to read. Harry watches them get ready for bed — how they brush their teeth side by side, how Malfoy casts Harry’s hair into a neat plait, how they wash and moisturise their faces (why can’t Hermione just be wrong, for once?), and kiss each other.
"You're nineteen, what do you need anti-aging potions for?"
Malfoy slides the kind of calzone into the oven and walks toward Harry like he's about to make the decision for him.
Harry’s face turned a brilliant red with that comment, and Draco knotted his fingers in his dark hair, drawing him down into an ardent kiss. The two of them tussled for a moment, a brilliant push and pull of limbs, and tongues, but Harry emerged the victor, wriggling out of Draco’s clutches with a wide grin on his face.
Draco was only happy to help change the subject. Beside him, Harry looked chagrined, and Draco couldn’t help but wonder at the conversations that had been happening here at the Burrow. Evidently, for all her rejections of the Sacred Twenty-Eight, Molly Weasley’s reverence for the whole ‘wed before bed’ practices cut very deeply. “Harry is exaggerating,” Draco answered. “I’m only seventeen weeks in. In three weeks we’re going to find out what we’re having though.”
He smiled, and then Draco knew for certain. He’d be happy here, at Grimmauld Place. Happy here for a lifetime, alongside Harry and their daughter. This wasn’t the life that he’d imagined, but somewhere along the line, it had become the one that he wanted.
"Hiya Harry," Luna says cheerfully. "Want to help me lead the Thestrals to the forest?"
"Then you're supposed to kiss me on the forehead and pet my hair."
was what Draco had been looking for.
"Alright," Harry says.
would have a field day. Idly, Draco stroked the velvety feathers of the small bird – Elianna, according to her tag – and gave her a couple of treats as a reward.
"Of course not," Harry says again.
He looks at his dirty old kitchen with new eyes, now. He sees possibility. He sees a world in which Draco Malfoy smiles at him as if the sun rises and lies with Harry, a world in which he makes dinners with the Wireless on.
Hermione joins them on Harry's other side, holding his hand, and they take Harry home.
Draco inhaled in a breath. Remembered how he used to come here with Mother, remembered how her soft rose fragrance used to smell, and how she’d never made him feel like a child. Not once. They’d always been a pair, he and his Mother. United against the petty tyrannies of Lucius. Draco wondered briefly if he and his baby might, one day, be as close.
mate, not silver, not duo."
Other Harry turns back to the pan and adds the bay leaf, a shot of port and a dash of Worcestershire sauce. Harry still has no idea what dinner he's making, but he inhales deeply, letting the fragrant scent calm him.
Draco examined their encounters, one by one. They’d also been spending time together – shopping, evenings reading, watching the Muggle television and talking – but that surely was all for the benefit of their baby? It meant they’d know his voice and respond well to Harry’s magic. It was like Hayes had said: whatever you’re doing, it certainly seems to be suiting the pair of you. Surely, even coming here, enjoying a lazy Sunday with the Weasleys, was all about building up positive relationships for after they became parents?
Malfoy starts cutting the grapefruit in a fussy way that removes all the pith and he calls "supreme" while Harry rolls his eyes. Malfoy moves so effortlessly in the kitchen, cutting one thing, flipping another, timing both the potatoes and the fish in the oven so they're both deemed perfectly cooked at the same time.
Hayes nodded her approval. “I think it is for the best,” she said. She handed over a couple of leaflets, reiterating everything that he had been told, and giving him a little information about the three trimesters. Draco stuck them straight into his satchel: he’d look at them when he got back at home, and had the time to concentrate and really take in everything he ought to know.
Malfoy holds Harry's hand in his and that's even more comforting.
Sadly, their special moment didn’t last very long. The seamstress coughed, and Harry hurriedly broke their embrace. As he pulled away Harry kissed his fingers, and pressed them into the side of Draco’s bump.
"Hmm," Luna says, seemingly completely concentrated on her crocheting.
"Well," Malfoy says. "That's well. Thank you, Luna. Good advice, as always."
Escarole is lettuce's bitter cousin, which should be unappetizing, especially because it's been wilted and Harry usually hates hot lettuce—too slimy and rather too lettucey as well—but Malfoy's sprinkled it with parmesan and seasoned it somehow—"that would be salt and pepper, you poor soul"—and Harry is rather enjoying his plate of mashed broad beans and wilted bitter lettuce.
Harry was back at Grimmauld Place, and Draco didn’t want to keep him waiting any longer than he had to. He wanted to go home. It was time for the rest of his and their daughter’s life to begin anew.
They kissed until their lips were parched, and their pricks were hard in their trousers, and it would have been the easiest thing in the whole world to have sex.
to do this. To sit in a gorgeous Italian garden and nap against this wall.
Narcissa’s eyes flicked down to their joined hands. “A mother’s instinct,” she replied. “You’re a powerful wizard Draco; even as a child you threw off Muggle illnesses as easily as a charm. Darling, love: no force would have you out of the sky unless it was something very important. When Adrianne told me that you’d been eating sweet things, and napping in the afternoons, my inkling was confirmed.” She smiled, and gave his hand a squeeze. “My cravings and tiredness were precisely the same when I was carrying you.”
So Harry and Malfoy take the elevator down the innumerable floors and go outside to a small alleyway. Malfoy slips his hand into Harry's and before Harry can even feel surprised he Apparates them. They land in a familiar spot just outside of Hogsmeade, slushy snow soaking into their shoes.
Their captain
Malfoy looks at Harry for a long moment. "I know the Babcock family. From the war. I didn't hurt them directly but I did nothing to stop the people who did."
Harry doesn’t reply. Because — well, what would he say to that? For all he knows, he got hit with a weird curse and is actually lying in St. Mungo’s stuck in a bizarre dream. Other Harry is probably not talking to him and this just happens to be an insane coincidence. Harry doesn’t reply, but after a few minutes of watching Other Harry stir the onions in the pan, he sits.
Harry stands behind Malfoy and winds his arms around his waist, letting his palms lie flat against Malfoy's soft jumper.
Pulling on Harry’s ludicrously red Gryffindor dressing gown, Draco padded down the stairs. The smell of pancakes filled Grimmauld Place and Draco followed his nose to the kitchen.
He was awful.
“We don’t have to-” Harry began, his face earnest, but Draco cut him off with a kiss.
It's a pale blue quilt with slowly shifting patterns of narcissus flowers, the stitches move serenely, as if in a soft breeze, outlining daffodils that shift and reform. It's mesmerizing watching the stitches slowly create new shapes across the fabric. Harry loves it.
The moment didn’t last. Harry must have come to his senses because he shook his head, theatrically breaking their moment. “Merlin,” he said, taking Draco’s hand lightly. “We’re going to be late. Come on, Malfoy. We’ve only got a few minutes and we need to get a wiggle on. We’ll miss our appointment at this rate.”
Neville frowns. "Even if he is different now, that doesn't erase all the pain he caused us for seven years. He hasn't even apologized."
“Alright,” Draco agreed. “Frobisher’s, baby shopping and then dinner. Sounds like a plan.” He gave Harry a grin, and tugged him towards the Floo. “Come on, slow-worm. No time to waste.”
"I made breakfast."
Hagrid's booming laughter startles several of the Thestrals. "Let's get these little ones sorted then."
“Now, I know this has been your main question and I know you want an answer, and you’re not going to like that I’m not giving you a clear one. You need to hear it anyway. The job change? Go with it. Don’t force it. Things will change, and you’ll be lost and confused, but you’ll be happier after.”
Other Harry’s voice is raspy, but he sounds better than Harry’s panic was already imagining.
"I only cook with meat that's not bloody. And only sometimes. Rarely even. I can't stand bloody meat any more. I have suffered from exposure to bloody meats, and now I don't eat them. Besides which, this roast is
far from London,” Draco answered. “I’ve been in Cornwall for less than an hour but I’m already bored.” He shivered, despite the warmth of the day. He wasn’t sure why he disliked the place so much, but he just did. It felt like the facsimile of a home, felt fake. Something was missing, but Draco couldn’t put his wand on what it was. “It’ll be freezing come the winter and the salty air will ruin my hair,” he griped, “and it might as well be on the other side of the planet when our little one goes to Hogwarts. Besides,” he said darkly, “do you want your baby growing up with a Cornish accent? Might as well be born a Weasley.”
For the very first time, Draco felt gratified Harry had Transfigured himself into a walking, talking pregnancy guidebook. He managed a weak smile, glad both that he wasn’t losing his marbles, and secondly that Harry had taken such good care of him.
"Just because you've never asked their names doesn't mean they have none."
Later that evening, with several shots of Firewhisky sitting warm in his belly, Draco felt his run of bad luck begin to unravel.
"I'm trying to be a good friend, Harry. You're setting yourself up to get hurt."
"It’s delicious,” Harry answered, “but your very enthusiastic owl didn’t rouse me out of my bed to talk about coffee. Is everything alright?” Concern washed though Harry’s green eyes. “It isn’t that Muggle virus, is it? There’s been a lot of gossip… Adams said that you’d been sick, and- “
Apart from his clothes, his books and his owl, there was very little that he actually needed to take with him when the day dawned. Even his collection of racing brooms had been sent on ahead. Draco supposed that was the benefit of a boarding school education. It taught you to travel light, and to leave things behind without looking backwards. It taught you that people and loved ones made your home, not the address that you resided in.
, because Draco didn’t believe that he’d be able to stop once he started.
Ron comes home with a pizza just as Harry is lying prone on the sofa, perishing from both hunger and Malfoy related ailments.
"Another travesty we need to correct immediately. I brought it from home."
The loud sound of the Floo chiming stopped Molly before her tongue ran away with her, and the whole party, Draco included, swung around to look at who had arrived. Hemione Granger stepped out of the fireplace. The witch brought with her the scent of smoke as she stepped into the room amid a loud chorus of greetings.
It was only as Mediwitch Hayes left for a second time that Draco dared to finally look up at Harry. The other wizard’s face was open, raw with vulnerable emotion. Profound, protective magic surged through his fingertips, and it didn’t seem at all out of place or awkward when Harry closed the space between them, leaning down to press his lips softly against Draco’s.
Draco frowned at his mum’s mentioning of a granddaughter, but the word was overshadowed by her dire reminiscences. He hadn’t known that his mother still thought about the war in such vivid, graphic terms.
"Sweet? Did you just call yourself sweet?"
"No you can't skip the Goblin Wars of 1642, that's when the modern monetary system became unified and streamlined."
That is exactly what Malfoy is saying, Harry finds out over his third helping of lasagna, listening to Malfoy and Hermione strategize three nonsense votes they can push through at the next board meeting before they bring Professor Binn's employment decision up for a vote.
"But what about Neville? He has every right to be angry."
"Read about young Malfoy in the paper, thought I'd stop by."
"Ron told me about these dishes that wash themselves. Sounds nice."
They eat chocolate and apricot jam sandwich biscuits and then Malfoy tells Harry to bring all the flowers to the table. Harry didn't have the wherewithal at the time of purchase to ask Malfoy why he was buying twenty bouquets of various flowers, leaves and feathery fronds. But he wants to know now because it's a little overwhelming all piled on his kitchen table.
There wasn’t a Thestral in hell’s chance of Harry making it anywhere close to his bedroom –crikey, where had
Harry seemed pleased with Draco’s answer. “Her?” Harry asked, chasing a crumb of carrot cake around his plate. “Something you know that you’re not telling me? I didn’t think you believed in Molly and your mum’s wise-woman act?”
"And? What? You don't want to be seen with me?"
"So you left them out there all weekend?"
Harry nods.
"It's a common dish in Brittany. Usually served with savory toppings. Sometimes with a glass of buttermilk."
"Sit down and have some breakfast, mate."
on the door to their room, and looking at him expectantly. Draco felt his heart sink into his shoes, and he suddenly, quite keenly, wished that he had his mum there to hold his hand. He kicked off his shoes, and padded into the bathroom. He could do this. After all, it wasn’t like he had a whole set of different options.
"So 'ow're you feelin, lad?" Hagrid asks.
“This is scary,” Millie smiled. “First Pans, now you! But
"Kouign amann, Weasel?"
Malfoy is making a lasagna tonight.
The Trainee Healer bustles in after Harry with a tray of potions. Malfoy pouts for a bit when she tells him he can't have coffee with the potions he's on, but brightens when Harry tells him the filling in the kouign amann is lemon curd.
"Just because it's more expensive doesn't mean it's somehow more bread than my bread."
Malfoy ignores him and says, "Do I want the seeded rye with comte and caramelized red onion or the brioche with ricotta and balsamic roasted grapes? What are you getting?"
"They're good, aren't they?"
"The eggs here are divine. Yolks the color of marigolds."
Luna, having obliterated Harry's previous worldview, picks up her crochet again, hooking more stitches and humming softly to herself. They sit by Malfoy's bedside, quietly sharing the space, for most of the afternoon. Luna says goodbye sometime around tea, leaving Harry alone with a still-sleeping Malfoy.
"Grapefruit is for everyone, Potter. It's the fruit of the people."
They Floo to the Leaky Cauldron and duck out the back without incident and Draco tugs Harry over to Flourish and Blotts to look at the cookbook section.
Harry came to a stop in front of a display of cribs. They were beautiful, hand carved items, and each was unique and enchanted. Some were carved with images of magical creatures, others with invocations and spells.
"It may be odd. I'm told rather a lot that I'm odd and it's never stopped me before."
"Er… there's two?" Harry says. They looked like empty rooms to Harry.
"The real question is whether or not he regrets it," Hermione says, that twinkle in her eye working overtime.
Harry doesn’t want soup, though.
Harry reaches out and threads his fingers through Malfoy's belt loops, tugging him that much closer.
Or perhaps,
Malfoy doesn't respond at first because he's flipping the fish in the pan wielding a spatula in each hand. He stands back looking pleased with the flipped fillets. "I mean this in the nicest way possible, but Hermione scares me."
“Then just you, please. No book needed.”
Draco opened the door, and there Harry stood. He was holding a huge bag from The ‘Elfy Bakery – Draco loathed that pun with a passion – and his good-looking face looked entirely too cheerful.
"Alright that's it. If you're going to ignore me then I'll just Floo home."
"You said I could pick."
Harry puts on a jumper and they leave on foot. There's a restaurant not far from Harry's flat that serves sushi, though he's never been.
"Go to the Burrow already," Harry says. "I am begging you to leave."
At night, Harry watches them get into bed and curl into each other again, Draco on Other Harry’s chest first, asking Other Harry questions that he only gets nods for. Once more, Harry gets that weird feeling that this peace they share somehow extends to him, that the safety Other Harry must feel with Draco’s arms around him, his hands gently carding through his hair, can be a little his, too. They twist and turn around each other, never not touching and Harry falls asleep again to the calming sounds of their breathing.
Harry wakes up thinking about Malfoy. About his soft hair and the tender way he touches Harry and his refusal to suffer. If Harry's honest, and he can be within his own head, he finds that refusal a little attractive. Malfoy says he won't prove that he's sorry through suffering. That people don't really want apologies, they want retribution. That he won't bend to other people's expectations of remorse. And something about Malfoy's defiant joy catches Harry. He wants it for himself. Increasingly, he wants it for Malfoy too.
“I’m not giving up flying,” Draco said, picking up the theme of their earlier talk. “Mummy has said that she’ll look after our little one on match days. I doubt that Flint will mind me missing the team hotel, long as I’m able to Floo in for morning training. It’s funny. I thought Mother would encourage me to give up Seeking when I told her I was pregnant, and to stay at home instead. You know, do the whole Lord-of-the-Manor act, but she’s really encouraged me to stay in the sky.” Draco grinned and scooped up ice-cream with his spoon. “Told me that I’ll be glad of the distraction! Truthfully, she’s looking forward to being a grandma. I think she’s planning to spoil her rotten.”
Merlin, but Harry looked splendid in his bed, and Draco shifted onto his side, drinking in the sight of his friend and lover. Somehow or other, Harry managed to look even better asleep than he did awake. Indecision swirled through Draco’s head. Should he kiss Harry, and wake him up that way? Possibly not. That might be a little too relationship-py after only one night together.
"Malfoy, I'm trying to tell you it's nice."
Harry feels a little breathless as he turns his head to kiss Malfoy's neck and then whisper, "Another?" Malfoy obliges, bringing slices of ripe strawberry to Harry's mouth, his thumb caressing Harry's lips and cheek.
Redoubling his focus, Draco made an effort to be present in the moment. The time had come for the scan, and he didn’t want to let his foolish, niggling thoughts sully their special moment.
She disappears under the counter for a moment and returns with a meticulously labeled binder that reads Jan-Jun 1986 and flips directly to the picture she's looking for.
Harry had the audacity not to be embarrassed in the slightest. He followed as Draco led him through into the lounge. “The croissants and the Frogs are for you,” Harry answered, seating himself down on the settee like he hadn’t tried to make love to Draco there, eleven weeks before, “and the fruit is for the baby. Lots of vitamins, according to my baby book. Plus, plenty of fibre. The book also mentioned you might be getting a bit consipa- “
For some reason that makes Malfoy smile and he says, "I'll be mad at you for as many things as I please."
Harry stares down at the floor, throat tight.
"I did try to warn you," Malfoy says, bending to let the little fur ball down and Harry confirms it is in fact a dog when it jumps onto his chest and starts licking his face.
The two of them took the stairs.
"Why is he here then?"
"Don't tell me they offend your manly sensibilities.
The easy answer would be since Café Quendryth. Harry had been so caring, so considerate and nothing had been too much trouble. Harry had brought cakes, tincture and fluffed up his pillow. He’d massaged Draco’s tense shoulders and he’d brought him cups of fizzy pumpkin juice whenever he’d had morning sickness. That’d be the easy answer, but Draco didn’t think it’d be the truthful one.
"Can you kiss me like that again?" Harry gasps.
Malfoy stirs about an hour after that, but only to curl up in a different position. Harry waits all day until the Healer comes back at seventeen with the news. The Healer casts a R
Draco had been expecting the question and he had prepared his answer. “I want to press ahead,” he said, pleased with how steady his voice sounded. “I’ve decided I’m going to have the baby.”
The toast is, unfortunately, worth the seven Sickles and Harry buys a crackly round loaf to bring home.
“I will,” Draco said. His and Harry’s eyes met, and Harry’s face was inscrutable. It was time to leave, and to go home. He thought that he might sleep for a week after this meeting. Cry, and then sleep for a week. “See you when training starts,” Draco said, in lieu of goodbye.
"Who decided a seventeen to one ratio was streamlined?" Harry asks. Malfoy doesn't answer him except for a gentle tug on his hair, which Harry rather likes.
Harry placed his arm on Draco’s waist, a barely-there weight.
Draco did, and Harry was right. What was behind that innocuous pine door was far more impressive than a dozen Mondrians. It was their child’s bedroom, and the sight of it left Draco awed.
"Oh here we go," Malfoy says, setting his spoon down with a loud clatter. He sounds angry which Harry doesn't understand.
Harry snorts.
The very next day, Draco found himself fast asleep once more. The blond wizard prided himself that he’d done his very best to stay awake – reading one of the many baby books that Pansy had lent him after her last visit, and discovering that his baby already had eyelashes, and that the magical centre of their brain was nearly fully formed – but Half-Moon Place was stiflingly hot, and his Cooling Charms seemed to be having very little success.
Harry broke their kiss once more, and Draco made a small, incoherent noise. Harry grinned. Bloody hell, but Draco knew how eager he must look. Luckily Harry looked rather excited himself. Draco saw that his face was red, a blush of colour high in his cheekbones, and his lips were sinfully red. “Do you want-” Harry began, the end of his sentence a blurry mumble as kissed across Draco’s throat.
“Beautiful is a more appropriate word,” Harry answered, moving his palm so that it rested on the roundest part of Draco’s belly. “You’re glowing, Draco, and I promise, you’re not going to be the size of the Moon or any other celestial body. What you’re feeling now is really typical.”
"It's fair to ask. You may not like that we have a violent history together on the opposite sides of a war but we do—"
means right now.
Draco could see the concern in Harry’s face, and he felt some of his iceberg of reserve start to melt. He’d known about their baby for weeks now – and he'd suspected their existence for even longer – and he was already used to the idea. Draco realised that it was all new to Harry, and had all been as much of a shock for the wizard as it’d been for him.
after a few minutes, and Draco crossed his arms, hanging back whilst Harry the celebrity drew all the stares. It was only when they exited, and stepped on to the cobbles of Diagon Alley, that Harry spoke again. He’d obviously decided to change the subject.
later, and then Harry was padding to the bathroom to use the loo and brush his teeth. Draco slid under his sheets.
Enamoured by the cat’s grace, Harry follows it back into the living room
Harry’s lips were on his skin, and his fingertips clutched so hard on his shoulders that Draco knew they’d leave marks. In his shagged-out, post-coital ecstasy Draco wondered whether he’d even had better sex. If he had, he couldn’t remember it. Harry let his weight drop onto Draco and he let out a long, contented sigh.
"Then—"
Very slowly, like a consummate Seeker pursuing his Snitch, Harry moved his arm down until it was wrapped around Draco’s shoulders. Draco closed his eyes, relaxed and somnolent. He felt the calloused edge of Harry’s thumb as it quested beneath the sleeves of his tee-shirt, touching his skin.
"Well, as utterly delightful as it is to stand here basking in your bruteish company, perhaps we could be on our way?"
"Cast the lightest possible warming charm you're able to. It needs to be room temperature."
, all of them written on the front of the paper, where everybody can see them.” Wiping his face with the back of this hand, Draco paused, took a breath, and made the effort to steady his voice. “And you’re right,” Draco said, looking down at his protruding bump while he spoke, “Even though having a child wasn’t anything we had planned or even supposed we wanted, it doesn’t matter. I wouldn’t change anything now. I’m excited for our baby, and sharing fatherhood with you. But Harry, why’ve you done this? Why did you talk to Cuffe? The other day, before we Flooed to Diagon, you said that you’d never put out a statement, or give an interview. Those were your words. Said you didn’t care what fibs they made up about us, that it was our business and nobody else’s.”
"Merlin, yes. I've earned them."
. It was one minute past eleven, and he stood, determined to speedily change, when the doorbell chimed, signifying Harry’s arrival.
"Do you like it?"
Mummy had surprised him once more and hadn’t even been the slightest bit surprised that Harry and he were going to move in together. The witch had only smiled serenely at the news, and said that she hoped to be asked to dine before the next full moon. “I expected nothing less,” she’d said to Draco over lunch in Café Quendryth. “Remember what I said back at the Manor? You’re a striking, clever man, and the other parent to his daughter. Your bonding ceremony is most assuredly on the horizon.”
"Yes, Potter, thank you," Malfoy says with a huff. "Anyway, after that… Well I suppose that's rather heavy."
"Don't sound so surprised."
Harry never wants it to stop. Despite his guilt, despite the fact he desperately wants to whip his cock out and wank to the scene before him and just can’t bring himself to, Harry never wants this to end.
He looked down at his own basket. Unlike Harry, all he’d picked so far were a couple of white vests and some baby socks. It was a pathetic haul. “It's hard to decide what to buy when we don’t know what we’re having,” Draco said, changing the subject.
"No need to cry, there's no persimmon."
"I'm here," Harry says, jumping up and leaning over into Malfoy's line of sight.
knows more about my family than me. And weird that I don't know anything about being Indian."
The food was stodgy, filling and entirely delicious, and conversation ceased entirely while the three of them were eating. Greg
Harry leaving was the last thing that Draco wanted, and he leant back in the pillows, counted to ten, and willed his heart rate to get back to normal. Mediwitch Hayes would be back any moment, and if he was agitated, she’d only ask a dozen questions and worry about his blood pressure.
“Look, just start with the classic shit, it’ll be fine. I’m Harry Potter, I saved you all from the reign of evil, my incredibly fit friend Ron here needs no introduction...”
“You saved my life,” Draco murmured. “And you kept me out of jail. Even though you hate me. I don’t understand it.”
“Harry, I know there’s history between you and Draco Malfoy,” Bill said measuredly. “But you’ve known me for a long time, too. And I hope you know better than to think I would keep anything secret that would put you in danger.”
“You’ve got a lot to answer for,” Harry agreed. He squinted upward at the swath of stars splashed across the sky like a shower of sparks and felt a trickle of calm seep into his body at the knowledge that Draco couldn’t curse him, though he knew better than to ask why. “But I don’t know that hexing your fingers together is going to fix any of it.”
Hermione met Harry and Ron at the Three Broomsticks with pencil shavings on her blouse and a smile on her face. With the sun going down outside, the temperature had plummeted from the mountain air, and her cheeks were bright red as she flopped into the chair next to Ron’s, greeting him with a quick kiss that Harry pretended not to see to save Ron some embarrassment.
Hermione actually rolled her eyes at this, to Harry’s great surprise. “Oh, enough! You’re just saying this because you feel guilty.”
Harry stood awkwardly on the ovular rug beside the fire, now streaked with soot from the imprint of his trainers. McGonagall glanced back at her paperwork then again at Harry, sighed almost inaudibly, and lifted the silt from the rug with a flick of her wand.
“I was just thinking that before tomorrow, I might have a chance to, er...” Harry trailed off, glancing around him as though the word that had eluded him was resting somewhere among the crevices of the office.
“So not by choice, then?” Harry confirmed. Bill said nothing, regarding him with inscrutable blue eyes.
“ “You are really making it difficult to keep my promises,” he warned. “But I have a feeling you’re not going to just let it go, whatever anyone tells you.”
Someone was breathing nearby. There were dozens of stairs to scale to reach the Astronomy Tower, and the listener was fighting to slow their breathing in shallow, ragged huffs. Blood would be roaring in their ears from the climb, no doubt softening the loudness of their breaths to their own perception. Draco considered all of this in the calculated way he considered most things, factoring in the available information, filling in the gaps with conjecture, coming to one glaringly obvious conclusion. He had always been good at assessing a situation and twisting it to his benefit, a talent he had too often wasted on the wrong pursuits.
"As if you, rich, white git extraordinaire with your fancy parmesan and your imported Fiori di Sicilia extract, would know what the proletariat eats. You probably think Marie Antoinette had the right idea."
"To do what?"
He looks back over his shoulder and right through Harry, making him tense up.
"You got another pillow?"
Harry quite likes mushy peas. "You're very high maintenance, you know that?"
The elves kept the place pretty tidy, but Draco decided it was best to hide the fizzy pumpkin juice and the large box of cauldron cakes in his pantry, just to be on the safe side. He didn’t want Harry judging him on his cravings, and quoting from his stupid baby book.
Malfoy's lips thin further. "Weird," he says, unimpressed.
"What curses need breaking?"
"I might. And these—" Malfoy pauses to glare at Harry, "are vegan chocolate cupcakes. For Luna."
He is unsure about how much he should tell Ron and Hermione about the future, so he settles for a, “There’s something I have to make sure I write down. I promise I’ll answer your questions and eat your soup, after.”
Malfoy looks up from tracing one of the flower tiles on the table. "Oh," he says.
"I don't think I can be an Auror anymore," Harry says as Ron approaches the table, a paper cup of tea in each hand.
"No, that's alright. Just, you don't think it's all a bit odd? Coming back to the Manor?"
They make sure all the Thestrals are under the cover of the trees and Hagrid pulls several things out of his great coat that Luna unshrinks—a few water troughs and several giant bags of wet composting leaves. Hagrid makes several nests from the earthy smelling leaves while Luna and Harry fill the troughs with
"Why does everyone say that?" Harry bursts out. "It must be nice to
Harry stepped over to stand beside Draco and met his gaze head on.
Mother was right. What Harry and he had made together was more significant, more momentous than Draco’s yearning heart.
So Harry stems the kale, standing next to Malfoy at the counter while he slices an onion into perfectly thin slivers. He's trying to think of a way to ask,
"What? Everyone saw me kiss Malfoy?"
going on — something Harry is trying very hard to get better at.
"I've noticed. We can get you a few cashmere sweaters since you like mine so much."
"Er—that he shouldn't be angry with me."
"Yes, well," Malfoy says. "Immediate problems first—I'm hungry."
“Oranges need to be peeled and all the pith needs to be removed. Don’t use a spell. He likes the smell on your hands. Nectarines and peaches stain. Be careful. And learn stain removal charms for when you can’t be careful. Learn the spell to cut the tops of strawberries off with the little zigzag shape, too.”
“That’s
“No way! I’m thrilled that you’re not shagging my sister. Best thing you ever did for me was split up.”
“I hardly need to remind you that it’s because of your intervention that Lucius’s kid walks free,” Bill said. “So be careful who you go around accusing. I don’t like it either, but I do what Kingsley asks me to do.”
“Er—right,” Harry said quickly. “Sorry.”
Hermione looked leagues happier than either of the boys put together, and her smile only faltered when she glanced between the two of them and saw that they were not nearly as excited as she was. “Well, you should be pleased, shouldn’t you?” she asked, in the sort of lofty voice that was only a hair away from agitation. “I’d give anything to have a break from work right now, and here you are complaining. Honestly!” Her fluffy hair bounced around her head as she slumped back in her seat, arms folding across her chest.

“Yeah, but you weren’t, were you?” Ron countered. “Besides, you have more right than anyone else to hate them all.”
what happens when the Ministry forces a Trace on you when you’re overage?”
“Couldn’t I?” Harry raised an eyebrow. “Don’t think I’d have been any good?”
magic.” He glanced at Harry then, fully, searching his face for something with calculating eyes. Harry did his best to hold the gaze, but looking Malfoy in the eye for this long without feeling like he was about to be murdered was making his skin crawl.
Harry didn’t argue this, just kept walking in stride with Bill, focusing on stretching his steps to match Bill’s longer legs. “I’m stubborn like that,” he agreed.
“So what’s all this about, then, Hagrid?” Ron finally dared to ask. “You looked upset when we got here.”
“Brilliant,” Harry said, the very idea of having to sweep every room for beetles from now on nauseating at best.
The sorting finished quickly with no stalls to speak of. The boy Harry had been speaking to went to Ravenclaw, though his friend was sorted into Slytherin. Harry hoped silently that they would still be friends afterward, that his words had made some effect on their opinions.
“Am I supposed to be sympathetic to you because he might have killed your parents? He did kill mine, did you forget?”
Harry threw a fortifying arm around Ron’s shoulders, giving it a squeeze, and together they forged onward into the shop, following the sound of raucous laughter and the smell of boiled sweets and burning hair.
“Of course I do!” Harry cried. “Why shouldn’t I?”
“I think you’re stalling,” Harry guessed. Bill actually smiled wanly at that, a quiet breath of a laugh escaping his lips.
“And he succeeded!” Bill supplied unnecessarily. “Now get out of here, you’ve more than done your duty for today. Harry said it was a long first day. Go and have a drink for me.” He saluted them lazily with two fingers to his temple as they parted, Ron and Harry back down the rise, Bill through the enormous oak doors of the castle.
Harry’s mouth flapped uselessly, but even the burning feeling inside of him of betrayal and rage couldn’t spur him to form an answer to a conversation that had been so swiftly and unequivocally put at an end.
“Good on him,” Harry said, smiling so widely that his cheeks began to hurt.
“No!” Ron said defensively, convincing Hermione not at all.
Harry turned.
Ron groaned. “We’re adults, and so is he. Can’t we just tell him he can’t cook and never have to meet him for lunch again?”
“Yes,” Draco said. She looked sad to see him go, but made no move to keep him.
He at last made his way back to the fifth floor hallway. Four doors down, past the section where the twins had unleashed a pervasive swamp into the hall in their sixth year, causing Filch to begin ferrying students back and forth to class. Somewhere across from the statute of Boris the Bewildered, that crotchety old wizard with his gloves on the wrong hands, he slowed his gait. Opposite the carving was a large swath of open wall, which was disrupted only by the decorative raised channels that ran from the floor to the ribbed ceiling. Feeling like a real knob, he glanced around himself to make sure he was alone, then tapped the tip of his outstretched wand to the blank section of wall.
“I hate to say it, but it’s the first full day of term, which means-”
Ron grinned unapologetically. “Hey, mate, just because you aren’t getting any doesn’t mean you can spoil it for the rest of us.”
“Well, I wasn’t worried about you, mate,” Ron lied quickly. “I knew you’d be busy doing brilliant stuff out here, didn’t want to bother you was all.”
Ron slipped back into his seat beside Harry and leaned over to whisper, “wanna bet?”
Bill scoffed. “I grew up with the twins.”
Ron arrived the next day and spent most of the afternoon settling into his room, the mirror image of Harry’s and not much farther along the hall. While he shuffled his belongings through the Floo, Harry ascended the Astronomy Tower and arranged his forearms against the railing to look out over the distant pointed roofs of Hogsmeade Village. The train arrived just as darkness was beginning to gather again, a distant streak of red that slithered into the station and crouched between the rooftops, belching steam. Students began appearing from the carriages in droves and swarmed in packs toward the waiting coaches at the end of the road like a swarm of ants emerging from a mound.
“Oh yeah, sure. Hermione’s fine, by the way. Don’t know if you’ve seen her since your aunt tortured her, or your friend tried to kill her.”
“After she mentions us, we can go,” Neville whispered in their ears. Harry, leaning against the doorjamb, nodded silent assent.
“I’d guessed you wouldn’t leave me alone after yesterday,” he sighed, resigned, as Harry fell into step beside him. Resignation was, at least, better than anger. Harry had never seen Bill angry and was beginning to realise with dread that he never wanted to. “Saw me on your map, did you?”
Harry nodded. “Bill confirmed it.”
“Oh, Merlin, no, none of that ‘sir’ rubbish,” Harry groaned, and was met by a smattering of laughter from the group. “Harry and Ron, okay? We’re not that old, I promise.”
“Then how can we help?” Ron urged.
“I’m sure that’ll help Bill sleep better at night,” Harry muttered darkly. “Remus can rest easy too.”
“Yes, master?” The elf croaked softly, the reverberations of the stairwell only serving to compound the natural warble of his voice. The locket around his neck, much too large for someone of his size, flickered in the low candlelight in the stairway’s sconces.
Ron clapped him on the back, Hermione kissed him on the cheek, and then with a sharp crack, they disappeared into the evening air.
“Remarkably mature of you,” said Draco wryly. “Finally learned how to act your age?”
“No,” Harry breathed in quiet awe, hardly daring to believe it.
“But what if I’m put in Slytherin?” the child moaned, tugging insistently at the sleeve of his friend’s robe. She continued to ignore him, gazing instead at the carved stone sconces on either side of the entryway.
“You really don’t know,” Draco said at last, turning back to the horizon. “I suppose you would’ve lorded it over me if you had.”
The class sat in perfect silence, suspended in disbelief for a moment, before the sound of scraping chairs rent the empty air and students began converging on the centre of the room, elbows flying as they fought to reach the front of the rapidly forming queue. Ron sent Harry an angry look that held no conviction.
“I suppose I should have guessed that,” he conceded. “Then it seems only right that it should have passed to you. Though I would remind you that it could be kept solely for decorative purposes. Sentimentality, if you will.”
“I wouldn’t,” Harry said, without knowing what he was talking about. “I’m not you.”
“Brighter than you look,” Bill teased, earning a light shove from Harry to the shoulder. “Yes, of course. The Ministry can’t keep that family on probation forever. And society tends to prefer wizards who can defend against dark spells, not cast them. And Hogwarts is, as usual, the safest place to monitor someone.”
you going to hex me?” Harry asked, half as a joke, though some part of him was genuinely concerned.
Hagrid answered the door with a booming laugh and a crushing hug that enveloped the both of them easily and squeezed all the air out of their lungs. By the time Harry’s feet hit the floor again he was winded and gasping to suck in air through a windpipe that felt crushed to the capacity of a straw. All the while, Fang the boarhound danced around their ankles, barking in low timbre and startling a flock of starlings from a nearby tree. Hagrid ushered them inside with hands the size of frying pans and closed the door behind them, humming merrily as he went to stoke the hearth where a copper kettle was beginning to whistle. Fang walked circles around Harry’s ankles as he and Ron settled into their usual spots on the window seat, then with an enormous sigh flopped down onto the floorboard and began licking at the toes of Harry’s shoes.
The halls were silent as predicted on the walk to the Defence Against the Dark Arts corridor. Only a handful of prefects were patrolling or escorting students back to their common rooms, punctuated by the occasional silvery whisper of a passing ghost in the distance. It was a strange sensation, walking about the castle without his invisibility cloak tripping up his feet. He would not soon miss the annoyance of holding the cloak up in one hand and the Marauder’s Map in the other, squinting down at it without the use of his wand light and trying not to let his glasses slide off his nose, where they might loudly shatter on the floor. As it was, being a teaching assistant had its perks.
“You always did make friends with the wrong sort,” Harry said at last. “I could help you, if you wanted.” He took a step toward Draco, who tensed and flinched away like a wounded animal. Harry halted, hardly daring to breathe.
What could Draco Malfoy possibly be doing here?
Silence descended, broken only by the whistling of wind through the spires of the castle. Harry briefly regretted making Draco close off like that; this was quite possibly the first occasion where they had managed to have a civil conversation, and he had so many questions about why Draco was back, and why he was in the astronomy tower so late at night. As it stood, he assumed any such line of questioning would have a similar effect to the silencing charm that seemed to have descended over the tower.
“Where have I heard that before?” Harry muttered darkly, too irate to say anything else. Bill offered him a reassuring smile, which only annoyed Harry further.
“Complaining about a war that the rest of us all had to fight in as well, only you were too much a coward to stand for the side you knew was right.”
The applause was thunderous for Neville alone, but by the time McGonagall got to Harry’s name the din of chatter within the hall was deafening, students beginning to rise out of their seats, craning their necks to get a better look at the three figures stood in the entryway. McGonagall abided the unrest for only a moment before the sound of a magically amplified clap jolted every eye in the room back to the forward dais.
Ron shook his head, a look of determination settling into his face. “I want to. He would want me to. He’d tell me to stop fretting and shove me right through the door, and he’d insist I spend all my money on his rubbish.” Ron blinked furiously to dissipate the glaze coming over his eyes. “This is the first time I can afford to spend all my money on this rubbish, Harry, so come on. Let’s make it count.”
“I welcome you all to another year at Hogwarts,” she began grandly, hands outstretched to mimic the wings of the owl, to a hushed ripple of awe and delight from the assembled students.
The students would be arriving at the castle at any moment now, and filing into the Great Hall for their house sorting and arrival feast. Harry skipped down the stairs as quickly as his legs would allow him, and upon rounding the corner at the bottom, nearly crashed into a pair of familiar figures in the next hallway.
“‘s not me!” Ron piped up defensively, which prompted Harry to shoot him a severe look. Ron had agreed with him that morning, out of Hermione’s presence. How quickly he forgot. “Harry’s just not one to leave a job unfinished. You know what he’s like.”
“Alright, then. Be safe.” Her eyes darted in the direction of the front hall, and Draco could tell she was wondering if he had seen the dead peacock. He plastered on a half-smile as though he had not, endured her kiss on the cheek, and returned to the fireplace in the main antechamber. Narcissa stood and watched him from the doorway, a mixture of sadness and concern warring on her features, as Draco stepped into the swirling green flames and vanished from the house, leaving Narcissa to stare around her at their resounding walls and wonder when this room had gotten so large.
Harry pushed the door open slowly, on edge about what might greet him on the other side, but was greeted with an empty room. Only Bill sat there, slouched in the chair behind his desk, looking over a sheet of parchment in silence as Harry entered. He waited a beat, then another, as Bill finished scanning the paper, then turned to Harry with a smile that Harry knew enough to recognise as forced.
“I’ve told you what I’m able to say. I’m sorry Harry,” he said, sighing with what sounded like genuine remorse, “but you’re putting me in an impossible position. I can’t lose this job, I’ve got a family of my own to take care of now. I know you want to help, but I trust Kingsley, and he doesn’t want you getting involved with issues that are already under control. You have to trust the system a little bit, and not take everything on yourself.”
“Can’t we just celebrate?” Hermione implored, reaching across the table with a reassuring hand. After a moment’s consideration, Harry straightened up in his chair and took it, accepting it without complaint when she gently squeezed his fingers. Ron sighed dramatically and threw his hand on the pile as well, inciting Hermione to a quiet giggle.
“I don’t want to hear about the sex life of my two best friends, thank you very much,” Harry cut in sharply, throwing up his hands to block the view of the red mark Ron was now demonstrating on his jugular.
“We’ve seen a lot,” Ron reasoned with a grim sort of smile. “Give us a go.”
“Er...hi,” Harry managed. “I’m Harry, this is Ron. Possibly you’ve heard of us.”
Draco winced, reaching to delicately pinch the bridge of his nose once more, where a dark bruise was just beginning to form under the surface of the skin. “Your pal Longbottom,” he said, grimacing.
Harry’s instinct was to ask more questions that would likely go unanswered, but some fire was burning deep in his chest, and it spurred him on in a rage. “If you have nothing to hide from me, then you can tell me what’s going on!”
“I brought your book back.” Harry walked forward and placed the volume on the edge of the desk, then stepped back. As Bill went to tuck the book back into place on a shelf behind him, Harry took the opportunity to take full stock of the room around him. Two bookcases, one filled with dusty old tomes, one displaying a variety of strange relics. The desk, one office chair, two chairs for students. Two latticed windows on the far wall, peeking out the windows of the tower onto the grounds below. A large folding trunk that had been configured into a stand for a file organiser. On the left wall, a fireplace, lit despite the warmth of the early autumn sunlight filtering in through the windows. Harry paused upon the fire, squinting at it until Bill turned back around and noticed with a quiet, “ah.”
“Yes, sir,” said a snickering Ravenclaw in the front row.
“We’re meeting Hermione tonight!” Ron shouted after him. Harry waved acknowledgement from the door, throwing his coat on as he closed it behind him and left Ron sitting alone in the staff room.
Harry smiled wryly down at the first-years before fixing a look on the young boy. “Nothing wrong with Slytherin,” he said. The child was too stunned to reply, so Harry continued, “I’ve known some excellent Slytherins. I was nearly in Slytherin myself.”
Draco let out a derisive snort as he considered something. “McGonagall worked so hard to ensure we would never cross paths,” he mused, head shaking disbelievingly at his luck. “Probably thought we would kill each other. Or at least throw a few hexes.”
“I’m being monitored within an inch of my life. Of course she knows I’m here.” He gave Harry another quick once-over, decided he wasn’t about to get hexed, and turned his back on him to lean against the railing again. “If no one sent you and I’m not needed anywhere, then shut up or piss off. You’re ruining a perfectly nice night.”
“I’d just feel a lot better if we’d gotten them all by now,” Harry heaved with a sigh, carding his fingers through his hair. By contrast to Hermione’s carefully styled curls and sharp business attire, he would venture that he and Ron looked as though they hadn’t slept in a week, hair ruffled and eyes dark, dressed still like they were preparing to trek across the highlands in search of Horcruxes. But of course, that was all over now. The only remaining trace of Voldemort lay in his followers, a handful of whom were still scattered to the wind despite Harry and Ron’s best efforts.
Ron showed up ten minutes before their class was due to start rumpled and unkept, his mouth dropped open in an enormous yawn and one shoe only halfway on. He was clutching his head. No students had arrived yet, so Harry did another sweep of the room before whacking Ron over the side of the head with the morning’s folded-over Prophet.
“You knew,” he muttered, as Harry grinned apologetically, “you knew that I had a headache and now you’re going to have them blow the place up with me right here.”
“Mum already thinks I get in trouble too much. She’d hate me!” the boy continued in abject horror.
“You weren’t,” the girl said, disbelieving. “You couldn’t be in Slytherin.”
“Do come in,” she said belatedly, raising one severe eyebrow over the rim of her glasses.
Ron returned, pushing the hovering dummy along with his wand. “Alright then,” Harry shouted, raising his voice to be heard over the din of excited chatter. “Let’s start with stunning spells.
Is it broken?” Harry asked hopefully.
“It’s open,” Bill’s muffled voice replied.
“Fair enough.” Harry stuffed his hands into the pockets of his anorak to protect his fingertips from the persistent chill. “What are you teaching him?”
“It’s because you always had shit taste in friends, I thought,” Draco said. Harry bristled and shifted to throw him a murderous glare.
“You realise you’re currently making fun of me because I’m not shagging your sister.”
“I shouldn’t, I’ve got plenty to do here,” Harry said. “But thanks.”
The students nodded vigorously, just as the doors to the hall began to swing open with a great sigh from their enormous hinges. The assembled students began to file into the hall, and Harry waved the pair along until he and his friends were once again alone in the entryway.
“Don’t say that,” Harry chided. “You did just hear me say I was nearly a Slytherin, right?”
“All teachers’ offices are connected to the Floo network, yourself and Mister Weasley’s are no exception,” she said, continuing to rifle through a large stack of hovering papers with a flick of her wand. “Your comings and goings are no business of mine. As I’m sure you are aware, you are a grown adult and I am not your keeper.” She pressed her lips tightly together so they melted into a thin, flat line. “As I said, you are always welcome, but perhaps in future you could consider announcing yourself first.”
“Oh, there was a war. Hadn’t you noticed?” Draco, despite the imminent danger, rolled his eyes and bared his teeth in a sardonic grin. “Do you care, suddenly? You never write.”
Harry ducked from the room, slipping into the hall and shutting the door as quickly as he could. As soon as it swung shut behind him and he was alone on the landing, he allowed himself a full-bodied shudder. A truly terrible decision on his part, to think that McGonagall would be any less intimidating to him now. He hoped it had been worth it for the chance to wander the castle uninterrupted.
Draco raised a light eyebrow. “You’d be doing a shit job. If the Ministry didn’t send you after me, was it McGonagall?”
“May I help you with something?” she continued, a dry smile playing on her thin mouth. Something about the lilt of her Scottish brogue was both sedate and terror-inducing at once. Harry realised with a rush of embarrassment that she was sorting through a large sheaf of parchment papers, sending them to different piles about her desk with languid flicks of her wand. There was a tin of biscuits on the corner of the desk as well; as Harry dithered, her expression softened into something reminiscent and fond, and she indicated it with a nod. Harry shuffled over, careful not to track any ash across the polished wood floor, and took a biscuit from the tin as McGonagall’s eyes turned back to her work.
There was a bowl of fruit on the desk, all red apples, to match the decor. Harry wandered over to them and took one up, methodically weighing it between his hands to make sure it was not made out of wax. The sort of decoration Aunt Petunia used to like, back when he had to be apprised of such things. The apple was real; he collapsed bonelessly onto the couch and sunk his teeth into it, enjoying the satisfying crunch to the bite. He closed his eyes and sunk back into the cushions to listen. Nothing but the sound of his own chewing and the crackling of the fireplace reached his ears, and it was a delight.
“I had to try,” Harry said. “Anyway, it’s a letter. If he doesn’t have time, he just won’t reply.”
What did that mean? Bill was teaching him? Why would the Ministry sanction more education for a former Death Eater? Robards had been furious with Harry for defending Draco and Narcissa Malfoy at court and keeping them out of prison. It was unfathomable to Harry that he would pivot so quickly to encouraging his continued learning. Did the family even have their wands back? Harry had returned Draco’s to the Ministry after the war, but it wasn’t outside the realm of possibility that they were on magical probation. None of it added up, which spurred Harry more quickly down the hill. He hardly realised he hadn’t been checking the Marauder’s Map until he approached the edge of the forest and skidded to an abrupt halt as a red haired figure emerged from the trees.
Again, the class laughed, and Harry felt his heart swell up. He hadn’t allowed himself to miss this, what with the reek of war that surrounded his past teaching ventures, but he was finding, with a wave of reminiscence, that he had missed it more than he could bear. Every spell they learned was another injury avoided, another life saved. Here, in this room, he would create the antithesis of everything Voldemort had ever held dear.
The words held the cadence of a command, not a suggestion, so Harry dithered for only a moment before turning back around and grudgingly following Bill back up the rise.
“You saved my life in the Room of Requirement,” Draco returned. “We were even.”
“Sod it,” he said, squaring his shoulders. “To going back to school.”
“You could go grab that practice dummy out of the storage cupboard,” Harry suggested at his usual volume, nodding to the slanted doorway under the office stairs. “If it’s not there, they’ll have to practice on us, which I don’t particularly fancy on day one.”
Harry had been leaning with one foot propped against the wall behind them — when he lowered it to the ground with a sound of scuffing, the children whirled around in a panic. When they realised who was listening in on their conversation, the girl clapped a small hand over her open mouth to smother a gasp, while the boy simply gawked, his eyes as wide as saucers.
“Sorry, sorry,” he brushed off, waving a hand and getting back to his feet. “I Flooed to Hermione’s last night. Barely slept a wink.”
Draco snorted a dry laugh at this. “Guess I deserved that.” He grimaced. “Do you
“Are you heading out?” She asked in hushed tones, giving him a brisk once-over and smoothing the sleeves of his jacket with small but firm hands.
When Harry returned to Grimmauld Place that evening, it was to find a crisp parchment envelope sitting in the center of the faded old dining table, staring up at him with shining emerald ink that had scarcely had time to dry. No doubt Kreacher had left it out for him. Harry crossed to the table, dusting a bit of glittering Floo Powder off his jacket sleeves along the way, and took up the envelope with delicate fingers. It was almost too perfect to open, its penned address neat and uniform, its stamped wax seal in a perfectly formed circle, a red so startling against the cream of the paper that it looked like a globule of blood had been spattered down onto its center, aside from the elegant lines of the school crest in its centre. Harry had recognised the handwriting immediately upon inspection, but it was still with a feeling of wonderment that he opened the letter and unfolded the single sheet contained within, allowing his eyes to travel along the paper.
Ron snorted. “Reckon any of the kids have that new broomstick they made for you? What’s it called, Light-something...?”
you were never alone. You had friends who supported you. When your parents have bought every connection you’ve ever had, no one comes to help you when you’re out of favour. My father had to learn that the hard way.” He was speaking quieter now, his voice lowering dangerously between ragged breaths as he fought to calm himself down. “Do you really think I had a choice?”
Harry,” Hermione insisted, slapping her palm on the table to punctuate her point. “I can’t believe we’re still having this conversation. You couldn’t fight a war on your own, and you can’t clean up from one on your own either. Let people help!”
“Me own blend,” Hagrid said, sounding a little cheerier, as he shuffled off to grab the kettle. “Been growing it in me garden out back. Mind ya, it’s a bit stronger that wha’ you two are probably used to. Bloke my size needs a bit more kick to wake hisself up in the mornin’.”
“Why one or the other? Somehow you manage to be both.” Harry glanced at Ron as a thought overwhelmed him — one he had been considering most of the way here. “Hey.”
“They’ve got this new thing, George says, that’s like an enchanted beetle; you can sit it anywhere and it will help you listen in on conversations. Inspired by Rita Skeeter, no doubt, but it’s definitely an improvement on the extendable ears.”
He looks at her, and then turns to Ron who steps forward to hug him, too. Harry’s heart is still beating in his ears but his panic is subsiding as understanding slowly dawns on him that he’s just back home, where it all started.
"Hi," Harry says, smiling back a little stupidly.
"Not hard boiled?"
"Perhaps with lillies?" Malfoy says softly.
"Um, no?"
smile.
Harry spends all afternoon holding Malfoy close. Sometimes he dozes a little himself, sometimes he stares at the unicorn painting trying to figure out the bizarre turns his life has taken, where he is somehow no longer the person responsible for catching dark wizards and instead spends all his time snuggling Draco Malfoy.
He fills the caffettiera with water and dutifully grinds the beans in his small hand crank grinder—he'll be happy to do this part with magic once he's allowed. Grounds in the caffettiera, he sets it on the stove and sits at the table, waiting for the telltale gurgle of coffee. Today he pours a measure of cream into the cow creamer first because he feels like being fancy, and uses a slender tea spoon to stir the cream in. Coffee in hand he starts unpacking the basket.
Draco tore off a piece of creamy-coloured parchment from the Daily Specials Menu, and jotted down the name of Mediwitch Hayes, and her department. He pushed the paper over towards Harry, before taking out his wallet. Draco took out a Galleon – it was far too much money, but tipping well was a particular point of pride – and he placed it next to his empty cup.
Draco had rarely felt such relief. He let go of a breath that he hadn’t known he was holding. Hayes
He’d had sex with Harry, and used an old condom and a dodgy spell, and as a result he’d gotten pregnant. They’d only been together once, but that had been enough, and Draco had been left with a memento that he’d have for a lifetime.
These were all valid, rational arguments, and Draco took a thoughtful sip of his tea. While he’d been sensibly trying to convince himself to end his pregnancy, his drink had gone cold. A tap of his wand warmed it back to an agreeable temperature.
Harry mixes and then Malfoy dips a spoon in to taste a bit. He frowns and then hands the spoon to Harry who takes it without thinking and tastes it as well. The gherkins, or maybe the mustard, give the egg salad a tangy lightness. Harry thinks it's delicious but he doesn't say so, handing the spoon back to Malfoy.
thought come from? – but Draco smoothed out the quilt cover anyway. It was ridiculous to feel sentimental about Harry and his night together, but a silly part of Draco couldn’t seem to help it. They’d made a baby, so that made the memory of it sacred, surely? Bloody
"It was already awkward. You are, at your natural resting state, awkward and irritable."
-together. Not like that. We’re-"
That fact seemed to surprise Greg. Draco decided to keep quiet about the fact that Harry had agreed to come alongside on the visits to offer moral support and guidance. He offered Greg his choice of cakes from The ‘Elfy Bakery and the mood between the two wizards quickly revived.
"Ms. Quincy, may we see the pictures of previous quilts? I was wondering if you have one of my narcissus quilt."
"Did you wear your new pajamas last night?"
The wisps of purple gathered together in a small pulsing swirl, just like before, and Draco looked down, giving himself permission to be interested in what he was seeing. Hayes dictated a couple of words, and her Quick-Quotes Quill wrote them into Draco’s notes.
Maybe your fortune wasn't talking about the baby at all. Maybe Harry was predicted, all along.”
"Give them to me or I won't take another sip."
"What is it this time? Did he forget the honey for the crepes?" Ginny asks.
"These are very pink biscuits."
The message that Draco sent with Orpheus was a simple one.
"And you take your assumptions and shove 'em up your arse, Ferret," Ron says cheerfully.
Malfoy chats with Luna easily for a while before his energy leaves him and he starts yawning again. Luna tells him not to worry, that he should nap, and stays in her chair while he turns on his side and lays down to rest. She looks at Harry expectantly.
Malfoy lowers the last egg into the pot and sets a timer, the old fashioned kind that clicks softly. Harry wonders why he doesn't use his wand for any of these tasks and is about to ask when Malfoy leans over one of the cookbooks, crossing his arms on the counter top, his arse sticking out. Just, bending over, in those trousers, right in front of Harry's wheaties. Harry can feel his cheeks warm; he can't believe he's checking out Malfoy's bum.
time," Malfoy says.
"And you think that's how Malfoy felt about blood purity? Just blindly accepted it?"
"I like it."
“-to owl your mum?” Greg finished for him. “Funny how many crappy chefs there are surrounding you at the moment, Draco. Starting to feel like a conspiracy, matey.”
Harry is confused until Luna gestures at the painting of the unicorns grazing in the field. Only they're not grazing anymore, they've all gathered at the edge of the frame as if vying for Luna's attention, which she gives them, running her forefinger over the unicorns' backs, while they flick their ears in pleasure and let out pleased snorts.
Harry discovers he quite likes polenta. The texture put him off a bit at first but it's warm and comforting like porridge and tastes really good with the bloody oranges.
"D'you think you can help me make a bouquet for him? I know I'll be rubbish at it."
Mother and he shared a strong bond, and Draco was entirely secure of her love for him, but they’d neither of them ever been effusive about it. Feelings were a discussion reserved for other people, and that was alright. It didn’t mean their relationship wasn’t a positive one. The world of Draco’s childhood, a pure-blooded, aristocratic existence, might had been blasted into a million pieces by the war, but neither he nor Narcissa had ever been able to unlearn the polite, well-bred customs that were all they’d ever known.
"Filling?"
Harry rolls out of bed, only marginally less confused than he was before his talk with Ron. He doesn't know what he wants from Malfoy. He doesn't know what to do about Neville. All he really knows is that Ron is right, he's been a lot happier since he's been eating porridge at the Manor with Malfoy, and getting dragged all over the wizarding UK in search of beautiful things, quilts, and sourdough bread, and flowers.
"No Potter. That's exactly what this is. Or you regret kissing me and you want some evidence for why it's ok. And I swear to Merlin and Circe both I won't—"
-scary?” She pulled away, and found Draco’s eyes with her own and he saw a flicker of hesitancy across her pretty face.
Harry's not sure why he says it, it's not any of Malfoy's business, and given that Malfoy sold Harry out to Rita Skeeter on more than one occasion it might be quite risky. But Malfoy just sits there looking stunned, a pink biscuit stalled halfway to his open mouth and a little pink himself.
"Let's go to the cafeteria, yeah?"
"No better man on the case," Hagrid says, "An' you too 'Arry."
“I’m- We’re only eleven weeks in,” Draco replied, making an effort to be inclusive. “They’re too little to feel yet, Harry. I might feel a few flutters soon enough but proper movements won’t be for a while.” Harry made a noise of agreement, and the two of them ate companionably for a few minutes.
Baby Malfoy-Potter hadn’t been a
Draco huffed and puffed, but the gap was too wide, and no amount of tugging or pulling helped. Draco stared at his reflection in the mirror, feeling a little horrified by the sight reflected back at him. The trousers – his loosest, roomiest pair - only reached halfway across his bump.
"No," Draco says smiling. "I found it at an antiques shop in the village."
“Bloody hell, matey,” Goyle said, pulling away and looking down at Draco’s resplendent new tummy. “You smuggling a crystal ball underneath that shirt of yours?” Smirking, Greg continued his teasing. “I don’t know. I go away for a couple of months on holiday, and without warning, there’s gotten to be a whole lot more of you.” Greg shook his head good-naturedly. “Suits you though! You’re the only pregnant wizard in the whole of London that seems to have got better looking the bigger you’ve got. Bloody hell, but Millie’s cousin looked a fucking horror when he was in the pudding club. Spotty. Greasy hair. The whole works. You look like you’ve been spared the worst of it.”
Malfoy pours Harry's tea as Harry settles against six of the pillows.
Draco watched as Harry chopped leeks and crushed a bulb of garlic. Harry had told him a little about his childhood, how the Muggles who had raised him had used him as very little more than a serf, and how he’d taken to cooking as a way to reclaim the skill for himself.
"Why do you look so pleased? Did that conversation really get you going?"
"Hiya 'Arry," Hagrid says, a big smile breaking out on his face.
How likely would that be? He wouldn’t be the first Quidditch player to get himself in the family way, but it was still enormously rare. He’d only been with Harry, and that had been one single, solitary time too. The likelihood of conceiving? Surely it had to be small. Microscopic, even.
“Some small part of me has always loved him,” Draco admitted, hearing the tremble in his voice, “even when I was at school. But back then, everything felt tied up with hatred and jealousy. I didn’t understand why Harry featured so often in my thoughts.” He pushed a droplet of tea across the wood, watching it darken, marshalling his thoughts. “I suppose I’ve known since he began to come around to Half-Moon Place, bringing me croissants and promising to look after me and the baby.”
Her smile turned fond as he hastened out the door. “It’s nice to see you again, Potter.”
“You don’t own the castle, Potter,” Draco said, looking just shy of amused, before his tone turned bitter again. “And you don’t get to interrogate me on my movements; I’m a free man.”
The top of the Astronomy Tower was peaceful this late at night, which was what Draco had been counting on when he snuck his way up to its ramparts, feeling foolish as he ducked into alcoves in the stone hallways and avoided contact with any of the students or staff. Strictly speaking, he shouldn’t still be here this late, but after the events of the morning he was reluctant to return home any too soon. The grounds had been busy earlier, which he had discovered the hard way. Now he stood at the balustrade rubbing ruminatively at the sore spot on the bridge of his nose, relishing in the silence. The only sound that carried up here was the low whistling of the wind through the open arches of the tower. It carried the heady smell of pine trees and lake water, stark and blasting and rejuvenating by degrees as it washed over him. Too long he had been confined to his childhood house, breathing in the stale air heavy with dust. Even after all that had happened upon this tower, within these halls, those long years ago, the castle hadn’t lost its familiar quality of home. The people had changed — or perhaps more accurately, he had changed them — but at least the creaking ancient gyroscope seemed not to mind his company, suspended as ever from its enormous chain in the centre of the tower. Just him and the wind and the railings, the sort of profound peace that had been remarkably hard to come by for one so often alone. He closed his eyes to drink in the silence, feeling the hair on his forehead rifled by the wind.
“I know this wasn’t Robards’ idea,” Harry murmured, glaring out at the lake. Again, Bill laughed.
Harry’s blood ran cold as the clipped, icy voice from his childhood reached his ears, his fingers tightening on the grip of his wand.
Harry finally stepped up to the balustrade, keeping a good two meters away from his company and trying his best to hide the tremor in his fingers. It had been over a year since they had exchanged more than a passing glance with one another. Neither seemed to know what terms they were on now.
This thought lit a fire in his chest that provided him some amount of comfort. For the rest of the term, he would never be forced to sleep in the dingy, dark halls of Grimmauld place, where he often awoke to the sensation of the lingering shadows and peeling wallpaper rising over him in a consuming wave, threatening to swallow him whole. The entire house was suffocating and crawling with ghosts — not the kind Hogwarts had, but the sort that often left Harry feeling as though someone was watching him as he moved about the rooms, lingering just out of his line of sight. The kind where he would, on occasion, step into a room and mistake a shadowed chair or a coat on a rack for the figure of his godfather. Not dead at all, just busy about the house, apologising profusely for having been gone. Standing at the top of the stairs, waiting to greet him.
“Where the hell were you?” He hissed, as Ron threw down his satchel on the desk and bent to fix his shoe.
“Charming,” Harry said, grimacing.
“Yeah?” Ron’s voice wavered, like he knew what Harry was going to ask.
“I know you’re trying to be funny,” Harry said, the bitterness colouring his tone however hard he tried to bite it back. “But that’s not where we are right now.”
Harry began the trudge back up to the castle alone, sinking his hands deep into the pockets of his anorak. It was barely September, but he could already see his breath coming in faint clouds as he trekked up the pathway to the school. It would be really nice right about now, he thought bitterly, to still have access to the Room of Requirement, and the passageways within that connected the castle to Hogsmeade. But aside from the cold, it really was a beautiful night. Not a cloud blemished the sky above, painted with millions of stars that matched the warm, flickering lights in the castle windows in the distance. Harry glanced around him to make sure that no one was nearby before dredging up the Marauder’s Map from the depths of his coat pocket and speaking its activation. The clock tower in the courtyard read half past midnight, but when he unfolded the panels of the map, the worn parchment falling open easily in his hands, a handful of names still winked back at him in thin crimson ink. Frowning, Harry changed his course and headed up the stone steps toward the grand staircase.
“I’m not trying to start an argument here,” muttered Ron quickly, his hands up in a pacifying gesture. “I just mean, and I’ve told you this before, but, I think you’re too forgiving.”
“Because it’s always worked so well in the past?” Harry said. He didn’t sound entirely convinced, but there was a resignation starting to colour his tone that said Ron and Hermione were wearing him down.
Harry reacted more quickly than Draco had even expected — and he had expected it, raising his hands in a lazy gesture of surrender as the air in front of his warped like a mirage, the shape taking form as the cloak was cast to the ground, and in two lightning strides there was a wand-tip at his throat, pressing insistently against the pulse point under his jaw, and the resolute arm of Harry Potter connected to it, his green eyes wild with a maelstrom of passing thoughts, most prominently anger and curiosity in remarkably equal measures. The moonlight caught on his glasses as he shifted, and the telltale green eyes vanished behind a wash of Draco’s own face, sneering and unconcerned where it was reflected back to him.
“Don’t you?” Harry asked. A flicker of bitterness had begun to push the elated feeling right out of his chest, filling in the gap with a leaden weight. “Well, I don’t like you, that’s for sure. You had chances to do the wrong thing, and you didn’t. But you never did the right thing either. You did the least amount of work it was possible to do just so you could stay alive. Should I not resent you for that?”
Harry wondered, as he stood at his perch on the highest spire, if he was really cut out for this. Saving the world had been predestined, something he never had time or inclination to question. He was told it was a job only he could do, so he did it, dutifully. But was he truly the best man for this job? Surely real-world experience didn’t translate seamlessly to the classroom. What if he managed to ruin the next generation of Hogwarts students? If they all failed their OWLs, he would be the obvious one to blame. The worries ricocheted about inside his head like bludgers until he felt a palpable ache behind his temples, and groaning turned away from the balustrade.
“I’ll try to contain myself.” Draco finishes his food and puts his napkin on the table, taking a sip of his wine. “Don’t start snooping around our bars, just because I’ve piqued your curiosity. They’re the few places left in the world that wouldn’t welcome Head Auror Potter with a fanfare. If you want to see what it’s like, you can ask me. I’ll take you. I’d suggest you use a Glamour, for your sake as well as mine.”
“Nosy fucker.” Harry slides off the counter, so he and Draco are eye-level again. “What parts?”
Returning to Britain on the cusp of spring reminded Draco of the things he missed during his time abroad. He found himself taking long walks in the countryside to clear his head. He would practice the magical skills he had acquired in Europe in the vast, open spaces of Wiltshire. It was several months later when he spotted a small advertisement in the paper for the higgledy-piggledy little shop in Hogsmeade. All too aware of the crimes committed against Garrick Ollivander at the Manor, Draco was determined not to establish a business that would compete with Ollivander’s in any way. Instead, he set up a shop that focused on wand restoration and repair, rather than making and selling new wands.
“Perhaps I haven’t found someone challenging enough,” Draco says.
“I’ve never been keen on rules.” Harry casts a quick look around and then leans over Draco, kissing him.
Reading Harry’s body language is like holding a rare wand. He’s as expressive in bed as he is in every aspect of his life. He seems to have no qualms about showing his pleasure in a way that makes Draco harder than he’s been in a long time. There is, after all, nothing quite like being wanted. Draco takes his time fingering Harry, the filthy sound of lubricant and the slap of flesh against flesh filling the quiet room. It mingles with the ragged puffs of Harry’s breath and the low, crisp comments that Draco makes intermittently. There are the ones he says out loud:
“I don’t think that,” Harry says, uncertain. “I don’t think that at all.”
“You think there are other things I’m suppressing?” Draco raises his eyebrows at Harry.
“You have two left feet,” Draco points out. “I might not want to dance with you in public.”
witches,” Ginny clarifies, as if Harry doesn’t know a thing about it, which he pretty much doesn’t.
. He’s never been afraid to take risks. Even if he ends up buying another new sofa as Ron pats him awkwardly on the shoulder telling him to
“—I get it.” Harry holds up his hand. He hates the guilty sensation that makes his chest tight and he doesn’t want any more pointed recriminations, even if he deserves them. “I’m listening now.”
Draco laughs. “I’ve already said I’m happy to help with the interior. It might be rather fun watching you paint, shirtless.”
“Not quite,” Harry murmurs. He runs his tongue over the head of Draco’s cock, then pulls back, giving him a cheeky grin. “What I had in mind involves you facing the other way, actually.”
Hermione clucks her tongue. “I’d have liked to see him try.”
“We’re bound to bump into one another.”
It took just shy of a month to restore Harry’s wand to its full glory and for reasons Draco doesn’t fully understand, the significance of that particular phoenix and the use of her tears left Harry in a strange, melancholy place during part of the process. The old Draco would have demanded more information, but whenever he was tempted to push, he bit his tongue. There are things about Harry’s past that Draco is never going to know about, and he understands why. They both make a conscious effort to focus on the future instead of the past, even though some conversations naturally take them back to the events that shaped who they both are today.
wizard to another is an invitation to have sex. Draco sits back in his seat, sipping his drink slowly. If sex with Harry is on the cards, the least he can do is stay sober enough to remember it.
“I’m glad you’re here.” Harry pushes a hand through his hair, a flush of pleasure as he meets Draco’s gaze making his body hot. “All of you. I was going mad by myself.”
Harry doesn’t wait for an answer, bringing their lips together at last. This kiss is different to the first with all its urgent newness. Harry’s lips don’t feel familiar—not yet—but there’s a new ease to kissing him. From the way Harry’s hands wander as the kiss gets more searching, it’s apparent that there’s something about Draco wearing his clothes that gets him off. With an inward smile, Draco breaks the kiss to tug lightly at the lobe of Harry’s ear with his teeth.
“I expect nothing of the sort.” Harry keeps his voice level, despite the fury gathering inside him. Draco Malfoy is the most annoying, pompous prat Harry has ever met. “How did Voldemort feel about two wizards fucking? Just out of curiosity.”
yet?”
“Harassing me?” Harry stares at Robards. “What lines did you read between?”
“This is the good stuff.” Draco studies the bottle with a frown, before moving it to one side. He looks around the room, a strange expression on his face. “You finished the kitchen.”
“Oh.” Harry chokes back a laugh and catches Draco’s lips in a messy, exuberant kiss. “Good to know, Malfoy. Thanks.”
, puts his magical coffee machine to work on grinding fresh beans and reaches for his favourite writing quill with its elegant peacock feather. He ignores the other quill that shivers and flexes beside him, like it’s stretching in preparation for the new day.
Harry responds with an amused chuckle and Draco tries to ignore the pleasant heat that travels down his spine. He clenches his lips together and tries not to study Potter’s large hands too closely or think about how good they always look in Evaporates. It’s bloody typical that Harry would be able to have a wank, fly a Hippogriff and put an end to Magical Creature unrest before nine o’clock. Draco’s barely had time to finish his coffee.
“Because you left without a word and then sent me that stupid, bland note that didn’t say anything at all. What else was I supposed to do?” Harry shakes his head, trying to clear his muddled thoughts. “It’s not like I wanted to.”
“Of course not,” Draco replies, curtly. “Not in the way you mean at least. I imagine you think leaving for Paris wasn’t decent behaviour.”
Based on their earlier disastrous attempt at conversation, Harry wouldn’t have been at all surprised if he never heard from Draco Malfoy again. But then, he wasn’t that surprised to find him sitting on his doorstep either. Things are never simple when it comes to Malfoy.
“How the bloody hell have you decided you took advantage?” Harry snorts. “You didn’t take advantage of anything. I instigated it, you just…turned things around.”
“Two lives,” Harry murmurs. “Like you said in Azkaban.”
“Isn’t it?” Harry looks up and meets Hermione’s gaze.
“Nothing went to plan earlier,” Draco replies, not answering the question. “I thought it would be different.”
Draco rolls his eyes. “Just keep your head down, your cock to yourself and stop being ridiculous. You don’t strike me as somebody who’s particularly interested in fucking anyway.”
“It’s fine.” Harry waves him in, despite knowing the smarter choice would be to tell Draco to Apparate home. “You used to say you’d rather eat flobberworm shit than drink lager.”
“Which it
“You seem very invested in this garden of yours.” Draco moves behind Harry, placing his hands on either side of Harry and brushing his lips to Harry’s neck. “Which is a shame, because I was going to ask you if you wanted to come and not watch a film at my house later.”
“That went well.” Harry’s starting to feel like a right prat, so he gets to his feet and slumps into the chair next to Ginny. He shoves the ring in his pocket and stares gloomily ahead. “I take it that’s a no?”
“I have somewhere to go. It’s fine. I won’t be alone.” Harry swallows and gives Molly and Arthur one last look. “Thank you. For everything. I’ve loved…loved being part of your family. I’m…I’m sorry I’m not the man you wanted me to be.”
They help. So, imagine this old school chum turns up wherever you like. Tell me what you want him to do.
“Circe.” Draco turns his eyes heavenward, before giving everyone a drink and knocking back his shot with a wince. “Pass on my best to him, Jordan. I’m otherwise occupied now.”
“I know.” Harry stands and wraps his arms around Draco, the pub now completely empty. Not for the first time he’s reminded of the countless different ways families can form. “I’m taking you home,” he whispers.
“I can’t stop long.” Harry seems to be making a habit of being Draco’s first customer of the day, blustering into the shop on Tuesday morning shortly after opening. “My owl’s knackered after a round of back and forth with Kingsley yesterday. I thought I’d give her the day off and drop the paperwork across to you myself.”
“Well you’re welcome here.” Roger Davies extends his hand for shaking. “You’re one of us now, Harry Potter.”
“Has it happened before?” Ginny asks, low and dangerous. Harry shakes his head, not trusting himself to speak. The very real possibility that after all this Ginny might turn her back on him leaves him more frightened than he’s been in years. It’s the kind of hollow, desperate fear that makes him want to look at the picture of his parents, curled up in bed with the duvet tightly cocooned around him.
Ron and Hermione won't leave Harry be to admire the sleeping beauty in his living room
Swiftly I went over to start the movie, having already put it in earlier to make sure it worked. Pressing play I heard the ads start playing on the speakings, startling Draco as he jumped, making sure I kept my mouth shut.
Getting dragged out of my thoughts by Ron’s continued banging, I grudgingly walked over to the door. Manually undoing the locks so I could at least try and stop them in seeing Draco. Pulling the door open just enough to see them I smiled with a fake cough, my head sticking out of the crack.
This is going to be one hell of a conversation when he wakes up.
Following behind him I close the door with my free hand. Without looking I almost run into him, seeing as he is just awkwardly standing just in front of the doorway. His hands shoved deep into the pockets of his jacket, shoes close together as he just looks at me.
Having flowers shoved into my face as soon as I opened the door wasn’t what I expected, but it's exactly what happened.
“I’m just going to go up to a bookstore right round the corner then head home, I can manage on my own. Anyway you need to get back before Granger sends the entire ministry after the precious chosen one.” The wind starts picking up again and his hair starts going everywhere. From where it was softly laying on his shoulders, it is now blowing wildly behind him.
Managing to catch my breath, I answer.
So he left, that’s why I never got the chance. Thinking back it makes sense, it didn’t back then. Everyone accused of being a Death Eater got heavily investigated, many now reside in Azkaban. His parents made it out though, now just having limitations on them, at least that’s what Hermione told me.
“I know I’m going a bit overboard okay? I mumble back as I fold the soft fabric over my arm, trying to make it as symmetrical as possible. “Just want everything to be nice is all.” Carefully placing the again folded blanket on the couch end; Ron does his stupid ‘not laughing but totally laughing’ type noise at me.
Sincerely,
“I heard about that, you and Longbottom becoming the new professors. Must say I didn’t expect that from you, him on the other hand, might as well have had it written on his forehead.” He heard? Did he look into me or was it just gossip talk with people? Nobody really expected it from me, supposedly everyone thought I would want to keep fighting against dark forces. Never quite understood why, I spent my whole life fighting, it makes no sense that I would want to continue that path when I can be at peace with the past.
“They’ve been talking recently.”He paused, smiling at me before he continued. “Draco came to him and asked for a second chance, and unlike most of us in the room, Harry is giving him that opportunity.”
He laughed again, only less saddening; but like he just heard the world's best dad joke.
“Always the oblivious one.” Smiling at me again. “I came back to try again with you if you’re willing.”
“No, I don’t.” Reaching down to pick up the glass shards he mumbles a quick incanation, reforming the glass before I could grab it.
I hope this lived up to your guys' expectations! I wrote it over the course of 3 days. I also started a new book of self-insert which I'm not too familiar with. I was going to continue with Hermione freaking out but I like to stop while I have a vague idea of what to write next so I can have a plan for the next chapter. I'll hopefully write it within the next few days and get it out for you. I've also managed to do more words per chapter so I hope I can keep writing 1000+ word chapters!
‘Dear Draco,
“Everyone has someone they want to be like when they’re a child.” I remind him, personally I didn’t have one. The dursleys never really gave me a good thing to imitate, but Ron told me it was true. He wanted to be like Bill, Ginny wanted to be like the twins ect. Apparently this was the norm in most families, I just never really understood it.
Realizing I was lost in thought I look back up at him, his head still looking at the concrete. Nervousness obvious on his face as his hand not gripping the flowers reaches up to his hair once again.
“No!” He yelled soon after, looking startled. “I was thinking maybe we could just go on a walk?” Taking a pause to look around us and then back at me. “It’s rather beautiful out and it’s quiet enough that we could talk” Smiling back at me again, somehow it looks more stunning than the last time I saw him. I nod back at him and move out of the way so he can start walking.
“So I figured we could watch a movie?” Shock went over his face for a moment before he nodded, quickly looking at the muggle television as my eyes locked onto his.
Sighing for what must be the hundredth time this evening, he looks at me for the first time since we sat down. “As I got older, I learned I was on the wrong side. But I spent so long thinking I was stuck on that side.” Taking the book back from me, he continued. “Helping you win proved I wasn’t.  That I could take control over my life, I, well, I didn’t have to be my father.” As soon as he finished his sentence he broke down. He hunched over and started sobbing into his hands.
“Easy.” The words were barely audible through his laugh. I shoot him a glare and he sarcastically throws his hands in the air. “Basically the smaller one didn’t think she needed flowers, while the taller one disagreed, obviously wanting to buy her the flowers. Went on practically the entire time I was there, swear the shorter of the two was planning on hexing her partner by the end of it. The shopkeep told me they were friends of hers, so the flowers were being bought regardless.”
I’ve never been good with owls. Writing to people has never been my strong suite, finding out exactly what to say makes rewriting the same thing over and over unavoidable. Most of the time I tend to avoid owls, just using floo calls or muggle devices.
Even after the patronus was sent, Ron still banged on my door for a few moments. Going from an aggressive yelling to a gentle anger, Hermione joined in with her reasoning of “Well if you feel ill we’ll take you to a healer so you can still make the game” Ron’s agreeance nothing short of excitement still trying to badger me out of my own home.
“I’ve been here for a minute and you already want to talk about that?”
“Haven’t seen you around Malfoy”
“It has to be perfect?”
Draco comes to Harry's to watch a movie, but they mostly talk
“You got caught in the storm?” I ask suspiciously.
After sitting in silence for a bit longer it slowly started getting much colder. I look at my watch and realize it's been 3 hours and I told Hermione I’d be back in 2. Standing up really quickly I look down at him, obviously startled. “I told ‘Mione I’d be back an hour ago so I really need to go before she starts a full blown investigation.” I hold my hand out for him to grab, laughing at me he does.
We continued to stand there in silence, he barely moved past the door obviously aware of his soaked and dripping state. To put it quite simply, I couldn’t seem to take my eyes off of him. He looked so imperfect, which made him look even more perfect.
“Allison’s yes”
It goes back to silence again. After a few minutes his breathing had started to slow as I moved my hand up and down his shoulder. The mumbling stopped and the shaking went back to normal. The wind started to pick up, and that was the only sound to be heard.
“Why wouldn’t you be better than me? Was there something I missed, because last time I checked your marks were much higher than mine.” He was a prat, but he was still better than me. He was better than everyone in that way.
“You fell asleep so I made you tea” We both spoke at the same time, voices coming out rushed and slurred together as we looked at eachother.
Not to mention the lightning strikes boring down onto the ground, the next always brighter than the last and closer then it seemed. The bright white light shined through the windows anyways, causing me to not even be able to see the television. So the pillow not only tried to drown out the sound, but the light strikes as well.
I hope you all enjoyed it. I zoned out when typing this but I feel it's almost exactly how I was planning it to be!
“It’s okay, um, good luck?”
Neville came in shortly after, who surprisingly was only fifteen minutes early as opposed to his usual thirty. He’d walked in apologizing for being late, of course it was only late on his terms.  Ron acted surprised and accused him of forgetting about us, he even did this whole monologue about lost friendship as he was putting his candy into all my clean bowls. He told us matter of factly he’d been late because he’d been on a walk with the Ravenclaw he’d been talking too and he’d simply lost track of time. Next thing I know there's candy on my floor and Ron is standing right infront of him trying to pry the details out of him.
“And you?” Draco leans back into Harry’s arms.
“You might want to reassure them you’re not here to arrest people, Potter. Drink?” Draco makes his way over to the bar, leaving Harry in the middle of the dancefloor with a number of unfamiliar faces staring at him. Some look angry, some scared and others just look sympathetic, or curious.
“Malfoy.” Harry gives Draco a weak smile. “I don’t care. I need a minute and I just want to go upstairs and put some clothes on. If you want to do something useful, you can sort the fire out.”
“Gladly.” Harry props himself up on his elbow and looks down at Draco. “If that’s what you want.”
The fact Draco literally is talking about Harry makes him hot all over. For a fleeting moment he allows himself to imagine that Harry knows too, and this is just part of an elaborate game. The thought fades as quickly as it arises. Draco stopped believing in miracles a long time ago.
“I don’t know.” Draco shrugs. “I’m feeling like switching things up for a change.”
The hum of his voice and the vibrations of his lips against Draco’s sensitive skin already feel impossibly good.
“Getting better.” Draco’s expression softens into the first genuine smile of the evening. He turns to Harry, the flicker of happiness fading. “The irony is I only left because I wanted to make things better and I ending up making such a bloody mess of it all.”
“It doesn’t matter.” Draco looks down at his mug. “Granger told me they offered you a deal. Robards was very put out you didn’t sign off on it, apparently.”
“Busy arresting more deviants, I suppose.” Draco rolls his eyes.
After he’s scrubbed his skin sufficiently to remove the last remnants of Potter-related debauchery, Draco dries off and pulls a face at himself in the mirror before dressing. He looks decent, a bit more flushed than usual admittedly, but otherwise relatively unruffled. He makes sure his shirt is crisp and ironed to perfection and buttons up his waistcoat. He gives himself a last once-over to check there’s nothing in his outer appearance that reflects his inner turmoil. He made the mistake of scheduling a quick meeting with Harry to run a diagnostic spell on his wand, largely to check if his instincts are correct. The last thing he needs is for the ever astute Harry to pick up on the havoc his cock has been causing Draco of late.
“You do that.” Hermione glances at Harry. “I wanted to let you know I’ve applied for a secondment to the Magical Congress. It’s a six-month placement. After that, me and Ron should be able to settle back here for good.”
The witch makes a derisive sound in her throat and ignores the snide comment, making her way back through the crowds to her friends.
You’re very good at trying to weasel out of telling me what you like in bed.
It hits Harry with sudden force that he’s had sex with another man. All those years of pushing his desires down, trying to keep them buried. He’s broken the law by coming out and in the same day he’s done things he barely even allowed himself to fantasise about. The magazines Ron and Neville used to pass around at Hogwarts full of smiling witches, the posters he put up in his late teens and early twenties of the same kind of Hollywood starlets favoured by Sirius. He’s always copied people, gone through the motions and done what’s expected of him when it comes to sex. His long, ostensibly happy relationship with Ginny was just part of that. It suited them both for all the wrong reasons and allowed them to lie to themselves.
“You don’t have a Crup.”
“Rubbish.” Harry grins at her. “It’s not that bad I suppose. Could be worse. People came, although I haven’t seen your mum and dad yet.”
With Draco’s hand twisted in his hair and the hard, hot pulse of Draco in his mouth, Harry chases away all the thoughts and worries spinning around his brain.
“Yeah, ‘course.” Ron shakes Harry’s hand firmly. He looks as though he wants to say something else, but in the end, he leaves with a quick wave.
—the world spins, twists and turns. Harry pulls away when he’s close, so close, forcing himself to turn and drop on his back. He hopes Draco understands what he wants.
“I didn’t know that.” Harry stares at Kingsley.
“You’ve certainly done that.” Ginny gives her teammate a quick smile then drags Harry outside, leading him to a couple of empty seats in the stand overlooking the training pitch. Her face pales. “What’s happened to Ron?”
overwhelming. Perhaps Potter was right about wands being like wizards. He hates feeling like one of the discarded spares.
“I do a lot of things naked and making coffee is the one I’m worst at.” Harry shoves his hand into Draco’s hair, trailing his lips over his throat. “Do you want me to do the stuff I’m good at, first?”
“They just need time.” Harry isn’t sure that’s true, but he wants to reassure Ginny. “Don’t do anything stupid. They probably think you’re avoiding them because I’ve left you broken-hearted. You should speak to your mum and let her know you’re okay. She worries.”
The point is, Draco didn’t need a dating service that promised it could deliver the
“I fancied the walk.” Harry pads after Draco, noticing they take a swift detour into the living room instead of the study. “It’s lucky I didn’t risk Apparating. With those brilliant wards of yours, I might have gone up in flames.”
“Was it expensive?” Harry doesn’t sound like he cares, his mouth pressed against Draco’s neck and his breathing ragged.
“Hermione works on social reform all the time, and you reckon she’s a shoo-in for Minister.” Harry tries to keep his voice level. The last thing he needs is to give Kingsley any doubts. “She asked me to help, she can’t do everything on her own. I don’t believe in the law as it currently stands, should I pretend I do just to keep the peace?”
He gets up, brushes the ash off his trousers and goes to make himself a tea. He hopes the hot, sugary drink will fill the aching loneliness that suddenly overwhelms him.
“Thanks.” Harry laughs.
“I couldn’t agree more.” Even now it surprises Draco when he finds common ground with Harry. A shared opinion about hot chocolate and coffee feels like a small victory.
“Some people do. Including the Ministry.” Draco helps himself to some soup, sipping it off his spoon. “You can’t make a magical house of this age and size compatible with Muggle technology. It would take years. I’ve conducted the necessary filters and spells required to have a functioning television in one of the bedrooms upstairs. That’s where I watch films.”
“It depends what you consider to be dodgy. There’s nothing illegal about serving drinks to queers.” Draco presses his lips in a tight line. “Try not to be hideously judgmental.”
“Not without more information.” Draco points to a pile of forms on his desk. He’s very fond of forms. “It’s rare that wands wilt unless their owners have died and that hasn’t happened to you.”
“Do I?” Ginny gives Harry a broad smile. “Does she talk about lesbians a lot too? My brother should buck up his game. Stranger things have happened.”
“I can believe it.” Draco’s jaw tightens.
“I know.” Draco’s jaw works. He narrows his eyes at Harry. “I hope you’re not going to start poking your nose into my sex life now, too.”
“You’re a fine one to talk,” Draco mutters. He glares at Harry, who finally yanks his eyes upwards again. “Why didn’t you tell me you knew?”
“If you want to sit somewhere more comfortable, we could—?”
“I suppose I could.” Draco gives Harry a salty, filthy kiss that lasts for longer than expected before they finally break apart. “You taste like come. I suggest you shower and brush your teeth because I have plans for later. I’ve had a year of abstinence, after all.”
“I feel like a dickhead wearing this,” Harry says at last. “Particularly when you look so…Parisian.”
“I’m not sending people to Azkaban for kissing,” Hermione replies, tartly. “You are.”
bar.” Draco rubs his forehead. “You…bought Merlin’s Kitchen?”
“I think Malfoy’s changed. I’d say it’s been difficult for him, since the war.”
“I might as well have been, the way your lot treated me,” Draco replies. He stands, holding out his hand to take Harry’s wine from him. “Supper should be ready by now. I tend to eat late. Care to join me?”
“Isn’t it?” Ginny’s cheeks are ruddy, her eyes shining. She looks different to the last time he saw her, her hair cropped close at one side and cut shorter than before. “Even in the rain, it’s beautiful. I don’t understand how you can live somewhere you can’t fly properly.”
“Of course she did, Astoria was an angel.” Draco sighs. He leans back in his chair and meets Harry’s gaze again. “After she died, I started to rebuild bridges with one or two people. Greg, mostly. A few others.” He contemplates Harry, his jaw working.
“Make it sound like we’re—” Harry stops, unable to finish the sentence. “You know what you’re doing. I’m not interested in men and I’m certainly not interested in you.”
Magic. Obviously.
Harry shuffles his papers on his desk, pointedly not looking at Kingsley. He’s in one part grateful that he and Ginny have kept up their masquerade, on the other, the fact that a superior would presume to offer advice on something so personal leaves him shaking with fury. “I’ll see what I can do,” he says tightly.
“Do it,” Draco demands. “Do it, do it.”
Lee looks confused, then he laughs. “Oh Merlin, not
“Grimmauld Place is closer.” Harry gives Draco a quick up and down. “If you like.”
about it, according to father. It’s been around since the eighteen-hundreds, although it went through long periods of closure. It was boarded up at the height of the two wizarding wars. Too risky, I suppose. The Unspeakable is newer. A few years after the second war it sprung up out of nowhere in a spot that used to house an abandoned apothecary.”
“Harvard?” Harry raises an eyebrow, laughing at Ron’s burgundy jumper with
“I’m sure there’ll be other people you can help, I wouldn’t worry.” Hermione stretches her legs out. “I just hope Malfoy manages to keep himself out of trouble for a while.”
“Wilting,” Draco reiterates. He leans back on his desk and contemplates Harry. “It may surprise you to learn I’m not an idle gossip. I’m not about to go running to the
“They were going to knock it down and turn it into swanky flats,” Harry murmurs. “The whole lot. The flat, the club…”
“It sounds like you’ve been doing a lot of thinking,” Harry says.
Harry shakes his head. “That’s a promise you can’t keep. Maybe someone like me will never be allowed to be an Auror in our lifetime. By the time things change, I might not even miss it anymore. I might be too old, too rusty, too out of touch with the way the Ministry works.”
“I’m sure you can.” Draco settles on the sofa next to Harry and blows on his coffee to cool it. The sofa is generous and squishy, a luxurious velvet green that feels expensive to the touch. “Did you choose this?”
“No, I’d reckon not,” Harry said thickly. Hermione reached over and laid a hand meaningfully on Ron’s forearm, as if to say,
“What are you even doing up here?” Harry asked, ignoring Draco’s ultimatum and finally lowering his wand. He took a side-step to put some more distance between himself and Draco; he didn’t feel completely sure Draco wouldn’t pitch him over the railing given the chance.
“Oi, what’s this about then?”
Hagrid shook his head, his watery eyes turning happy. “Havin’ ya here is enough. Go on then, have another rock cake. I’ve never known yeh to have less than three.”
Draco steps back from Harry and reaches for his wand to cast a quick Cleaning Charm over them both. His jaw tightens as he tucks himself back into his trousers, his cheeks pink, his hair perfectly messy and everything about him deliciously rumpled. Harry tries not to stare, tidying himself up and clearing his throat when the silence becomes awkward.
“Thank you for coming so late,” Hermione says. “I think it’s about time you and I had a chat.”
A flicker of surprise crosses Draco’s face. “I’m not interested in Weasley’s sloppy seconds.” He stands to the side, nevertheless, giving Harry a suspicious look as he pulls off his jacket and kicks off his shoes.
“Not that easy to talk to, though.” Harry’s jaw works. The sting of Draco saying he couldn’t talk to Harry has lingered through the night into the morning, like a bruise that won’t fade. “It’s going to be hopeless if we can’t do that.”
“It’s nice.” Harry only manages to get a quick glimpse of the room but it’s bright, clean and tidy. Smart dress robes hang next to an expensive-looking Muggle suit and he can picture Draco in it, striding through the Square Mile or sipping an espresso outside one of the bars at Canary Wharf. “How was work?”
“Ha ha.” Harry rolls his eyes. He lowers his voice, giving it a rich, sultry quality that makes Draco’s fingers curl into a fist in his effort to show how unaffected he is. “If you must know, I’m sort of seeing someone.”
Draco laughs. “First you tell me you’re gay, now you’re trying to pretend
“For the whole weekend?” Harry hopes Ginny can make it back. There’s something so freeing about being with her. She makes him less out of sorts, and he misses when she’s not around to deflect all the attention from Harry being a rubbish boyfriend.
Laughing, Harry gets out of the shower and throws Draco a towel which he catches deftly. They towel themselves off and go back into the bedroom, where Draco moves over Harry on the bed and kisses him soundly. His hair is still damp and his skin smells like Harry’s shampoo. It sends a fierce, possessive kick through Harry’s body and he rolls them over, capturing Draco’s lips in another searing kiss.
I thought I saw you here.” Without being invited, Harry takes a seat. He’s out of breath, as well he might be after dancing like a lunatic to Magic Mildred and the Muggles.
“I know that now,” Draco says, quietly. “When did you come to Paris?”
“With you, apparently.” Harry shrugs. He clears his throat, wondering if it would be rude to ask Draco about his suspicions. “Have you done all of that before?”
“Are you coming to the Quidditch match?” Harry asks.
“Yeah?” Harry sounds delighted, the smug arse. His tone shifts from gleeful to concerned in a heartbeat. “We don’t have to—I don’t expect you to—I’m flexible.”
“No,” Harry replies weakly. “I never knew there were rumours about Dumbledore.”
Ha ha. There’s a lot of that on here. I don’t mind Evaporates, when I ask for them.
Harry brusquely wipes his mouth with the back of his hand and straddles Draco, wanking himself off. Draco is flushed and handsome, the rumple of his still damp hair, the insolent curl of his lips and the hunger in his eyes only serving to make Harry even more turned on.
sound like they’re going to spend Saturday fucking. In truth, he would clear his diary for far less than a wilting wand when it comes to Harry.
“Not that hard up.” Harry doesn’t miss the flash of pink that colours Draco’s pale cheeks. “Just go home, Potter. Go back to your Weasleys and have a nice life. You’re not made for any of this.”
“If I have to.” Harry pulls a face. “I’ve got an appointment with a Boggart at three and I can’t have a wonky wand for that. There’s always a risk someone’s Boggart will be Voldemort. That tends to cause a lot of upset for children who lost family in the war and I need to be able to handle it quickly.”
Harry swallows back a clipped response. He and Draco have been many things, but they’ve never been friends. Draco became isolated after the war, cutting ties with everyone from his past and focusing on building a career as a lawyer. He kept himself to himself for the most part, often spending time in the Ministry library after hours, his head bowed over stacks of books. As Harry began to spend more time with Draco in a professional environment, they developed a good rapport, but there was always a heat between them that never felt particularly platonic. Not to Harry, at least. He was all too aware of the underlying spark of attraction that made his relationship with Draco very different to his relationship with Ron and Hermione.
