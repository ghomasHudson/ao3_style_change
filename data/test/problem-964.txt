Draco's breathing was short as he took in the heady smell of grass, blueberries, cinnamon and something that uniquely fit the wondrous, gorgeous man in his arms. "H-Harry," he gasped quietly, heart pounding. "S-Scorpius needs to be put to bed."
Harry's head fell back after a moment, breaking the kiss. "Tonight," he said, voice low and husky, "after Scorpius goes to sleep, we're going to find out just how much we can handle."
Draco gave a small nod, his right hand shaking slightly. To finally be able to hold a wand after all this time? Draco couldn't even remember how long its been since he was able to do some of the simplest spells... A year? Two? He couldn't wait to feel the magic - his magic - coursing through his hand again.
Draco swallowed, sitting up and turning his body around, ignoring their nakedness he reached out and caressed Harry's face softly. His eyes were warm yet guarded, as if the walls of Azkaban had been knocked down just to be rebuilt as if made from owl feathers. "Y-You love me?" Right now, at this moment, he didn't care if his voice shook. If he finally had a chance, no matter how marginally small, to finally find a love that he just knew would work, he would take it. Pride be damned. It's not like he had much left as a vault-empty, property-stolen, wifeless Malfoy with a sick child. Scorpius was enough for him. But this..
"Of course!" Scorpius smiled, playing on the plush white rug of his floor, moving Perry around animatedly to defend the Hogwarts castle look-alike that Scorpius loved since it was made out of charms that allowed the Whomping Willow and the windows inside to reflect moving people. It was Astoria's final gift to her child.
His own orgasm tearing through him, Harry's teeth sank roughly into Draco's lip, the hand not around his prick stealing into his hair to grip fiercely.
"I don't want my child going anywhere then the best. And seeing as we both attended Hogwarts, I find it fitting that he should follow in our footsteps."
For most members of the Death Eater crowd the Mark burned itself away, leaving nothing but a horrified scar. But for Draco, for some strange reason, only the bottom portion of the snake's tail had burned off, everything else still remained as vile and as... there as they were the day he received the damn thing.
Scorpius peaked in behind Harry's leg, clutching the fabric of his pants between his fingers. "Daddy sleeping?" he stage whispered, the noise loud enough for Harry to hear.
The elder Malfoy's gaze flickered up to lock with emerald green eyes, hidden behind a pair of wire-framed glasses. "W-What? What could Hermione-"
"This you can pay back in all the ways you want," Harry assured him, undoing the button and dragging down the zip. He palmed Draco's stiffened cock through the boxers he wore beneath - of course they'd be silk - and lifted his head to bite into the blonde's neck.
Harry looked down at his hands a moment before hesitantly wrapping an arm around the blonde and giving him a gentle squeeze. "I'll, ah, be back. I just need to go and get a few things from my flat."
Draco nodded, going back to the parchments with a renewed vigour. If there was anyone that could help Scorpius, it was Hermione Weasley. He didn't even look up as Harry floo'd away, the scratching of his quill sounding loud and almost relaxing in the dark flat.
Laughing, Harry rolled up his sleeves and prepared himself to get soaked to the skin. He dipped his fingers in the water, testing it, and flicked it teasingly at the boy. "Shall I tell you all about her, then?"
Draco was shaking violently, his eyes unblinking. He had just set Scorpius to bed, his little blonde child... one year... He couldn't seem to wrap his head around it. "W-We were only able to see a handful of healers... And they just..." tears poured down his cheeks.
Harry was the first through the floo in order to give Malfoy some warning. He looked around the living room of the flat he'd just entered, smiling slightly. It was... very clean, yet somehow managed to remain inviting. A difficult balance. "Malfoy?" he called.
Harry was irritated. Absolutely and completely irritated. After dropping the papers off at Hermione's place, transferring all control of Scorpius's medical well-being to her more than capable hands, he'd come to the Ministry... and had gotten the run-around. Getting Draco Malfoy's wand back was taking hours that Harry didn't want to spend at the bloody Ministry. He was sent from the First Level to the Tenth and back again and now, in the Wizengamot Administration Services on the Second Level, he was resisting the urge to gnash his teeth together.
"All done and sticky." Harry laughed, setting aside his cuppa to clean the boy again. He couldn't resist pressing a light kiss to his cheek. "Go and wake him up, alright? I'll start cleaning up."
Hermione set aside the parchment, vanishing the colors with another flick of her wand. She reached out, offered a smile. "May I see your hand, Scorpius?"
His gaze rested on Harry's face for a few moments before his eyes glazed over with unshed tears. He shook his head, rubbing at his eyes viciously. "W-Why-? I mean- You don't-" He chuckled lowly, shaking his head as if to make himself believe something. "I'm going to owe you a lot of thanks after this, aren't I?"
Scorpius was trying to climb into the bathtub when Harry walked in, his rubber ducky already floating about, charmed with magic to squeak every once in a while and squirt water.
"Ah." Harry prepared it quietly, the tension palpable in his mind as the shield of a child scampered out. Left alone with the object of his attraction, Harry wasn't entirely sure what to do with himself.
Draco rolled his eyes. "Keep it in your pants, Potter. Merlin." He walked off in to the kitchen after (albeit extremely giddily) casting a quick tempus charm with his wand. "It's ten past five so not for another four hours at least." He disappeared behind the warm-toned red wall and into the kitchen.
Draco smiled, leaning forward over the wiggling child to kiss Harry warmly, enjoying entertaining the idea in his head of making this a normality. Scorpius wiggled, giggling warmly and snuggling in Harry's lap. "Daddy, can we go to the park?"
"You're welcome." The shield dropped away and Harry closed his eyes, feeling Draco's magic pulsing and growing beside him. It had been well-worth the irritation at the Ministry.
So after casting a wandless cleaning charm on himself, remembering what Draco had said about his son's immune system, Harry got to mixing ingredients together and chopping up the apples.
The two that had been sneaking up behind him made their attack, jumping at him with terrifying grunts. The little child tumbled from the swing in his haste to try and get away, crying out as he landed. The two children ran off, but the frail looking blonde didn't seem to be moving. Harry focused on him, taking the last few yards and sitting beside him. "Hey," he said quietly, gently lifting the boy into his lap. He weighed almost nothing and Harry felt a pang of sympathy, another one stabbing at him when he saw that the fall had left his nose bleeding. "Hey, there," Harry whispered. "You're alright. Here we are." He lifted his wand and the boy gazed at him with wide, silver eyes that were eerily familiar. "Episkey," he cast and the boy winced as his nose was fixed.
Scorpius nodded enthusiastically. "Yep! We live wif lots of Muggles and witches and stuff! In a big building near the park!" His eyes lit up as he begin chatting about everything in his 'a-part-e-ment'. Everything from the red couch that he liked to jump on, to the cat named Severus (which Draco found Harry's reaction to humorous), and his snitch pajamas with his unicorn plush known as Perry. Draco cut him off there with a warm smile and a little tickle session. "Daaaaddy!" the little blonde cackled with delight.
"I... I hope so. He doesn't have a lot of time, and it's just going to get worse." She lifted her parchment, tapped at the shorthand that Harry couldn't even half-read. "His lungs are already glowing purple, and I can't estimate the exact time he has left until I can establish the rate of decay better. Right now I'd assume a year, perhaps less."
The boy nodded his head, spending the next few minutes listening to Harry's words avidly as the Boy-Who-Lived gently combed his fingers through Scorpius's platinum locks.
The little child blinked his wide, silver eyes. "Visitor?" he questioned, glancing back up at Harry before nodding his head. "O-Okay." Scorpius walked over, wrapping his little arms around Draco's leg and giving a small smile. "I'll take a bath now, daddy! You sleep!"
Astoria had spoken nine words to the room, not addressing her husband, nor her violently sick son. "I will not have a defect as a child." She turned, storming out and back to the bedroom. That night she packed her bags and left, papers filing for divorce appearing on the kitchen table the next morning. Scorpius had only just fallen asleep after the coughing fit had stopped and a Healer helped pour a calming draught as well as a dreamless sleep down the child's throat.
Draco nodded, giving a small chuckle as Scorpius reached down as if to grab the duck before blinking down at his hand, revealing that he did not in fact catch the bright yellow animal. "Come on, Scorp!" He called, a soft smile pulling at his lips as Scorpius ran up and hugged his leg, causing his dad to pause in his walking to pick him up. He heard the rumble of his little stomach before giving a cute laugh, Scorpius blinking up at his father. "Apple time! Apple time!" He chanted happily.
Draco gave a small start at the offer, looking down at Scorpius who gazed back up at his father with wide, pleading eyes, his lower lip quivering. "Please daddy? The nice auro-ro-" Scorpius stuttered over the word, catching his tongue as he tried to pronounce it. "Wizard-man saved me!"
Harry leaned forward, straightening to his full height and glaring daggers at the Hufflepuff he hardly even recognized. "That wand is just as much mine as it is his." His chin angled dangerously. "Unless you've completely forgotten, I killed Voldemort with that wand. And I'm also legal guardian of his cousin, making me family." And even he knew that was stretching it a little, but Hopkins didn't need to know that.
The little boy giggled, clapping his hands and nodding before resting his head against his dad's shoulder. "Yeah..." Draco mumbled, carting his fingers through his son's hair softly.
The blonde's lips parted eagerly, one hand coming up to push through Harry's hair, tangling his fingers in unkempt brown locks.
"Draco, why don't you go lie down? I can get Scorpius ready." Harry glanced Draco's way, then looked at Scorpius with a smile. "You've got a visitor coming over, after all. You don't want to smell bad for her, do you?"
Draco thrusted his hips against Harry's hand, breaths coming in short gasps as moans slipped from between kiss swollen lips. "O-Oh gods... Merlin..."
Draco groaned lightly, turning his body just so to rest his forehead against Harry's, his fingers digging in to sun-kissed shoulders as his hips jerked forward, the sound of skin slapping skin echoing through the kitchen. "Harry," he gasped, chest heaving, sweat trickling lightly against his forehead as his blonde bangs swayed in his face.
Draco kissed back just as warmly, goosebumps rising on his arms at the cold contact of Harry's hands. He pulled away after a few, long moments. "Okay you- go on, shoo. You're not wanted here anymore! Go on!" Draco's grin betrayed him.
Harry only smiled, touching his hand. "I understand. It's fine." He took Draco's hand from his cheek, pressed a kiss to the palm. "It's not like I'll want you less if we wait a bit."
He sat up, his gazing searching around for a shock of blonde hair, dread quickly filling like liquid lead in his stomach when his eyes couldn't seem to pick out the blonde hair from the swarms of children playing around. His mind instantly began running rampant, thoughts filling his head - almost consuming him as he stood to walk around the parameter of the park, a small messenger bag being slung over his shoulder in the process.
Harry lifted a brow. "I've looked at the files that detail why Malfoy's wand was taken. The reasons are lame excuses for your departments lack of work, and I have a letter from Malfoy's son's physician explaining why Malfoy's forcibly repressed magic may be worsening the boy's condition. You have to give me that wand or I can very easily arrest you right now for attempted murder."
Now Draco sat down next to Scorpius, tears pouring from his eyes as Scorpius crawled in his lap, dragging along the few plush toys he was playing with. He wrapped his arm tightly around his son, a few, quiet sobs wracking his chest. Scorpius paused in his playing, looking up at his daddy with wide eyes, innocent and scared. "D-Daddy? What's wrong?"
Shite, was Harry's first thought, and then he just wanted to squirm. He couldn't bloody well act on his attraction, he realized. He was trying to help the pair of them and he was sure Draco would take it the wrong way if he made any... moves. He offered a smile. "I really don't want any repayment. I don't want him, or you, to hurt." Harry sighed, looking passed Draco, listening to Scorpius's muffled voice for a moment. "You're doing an amazing job with him. Truly. And it's really obvious how much you really love him. I can't... I can't just walk away from that."
Grinning, Harry swept Scorpius up into his arms. "I think we've kept Hermione waiting long enough, haven't we?" He lifted his wand, casting a drying spell on them both and then a warming charm on the boy. "Now let's get you into your pajamas."
The blonde placed the plate on the counter. "Hey, Scorpius," the little boy looked up from playing with Perry on the floor. "Go play in your room, will you please?"
Scorpius sniffled softly, a small whimper escaping his lips. "P-Protecting daddy..." His arms locked around Harry's neck tightly, most likely as tight as a little boy as frail as him could grab.
"You aren't pregnant this time," the wizard argued and the look Hermione sent him had him sighing. "Not as pregnant."
Scorpius smiled widely passed his tears. "I-I know!" He wiggled his feet. "H-He's the best!" They reached the bathroom door, the white wood in their faces as it was closed firmly.
Draco let out a low, guttural moan, pressing his hips firmly against Harry's hand and reaching behind him to tug a hand through Harry's hair. "M-Merlin- Potter-" he moaned wantonly.
It was a few minutes later that Harry came in, swallowing hard as he gazed down at the pair. Silent tears still streamed down Draco's face, dripping from his chin to the very confused, very worried boy in his lap. Harry's hand tightened its grip on the doorknob for a fleeting moment while he pulled himself together. They couldn't scare the boy. He wouldn't understand, not really.
Draco thought it over for a moment before nodding his head, sipping at the water the waitress brought and continuing to gaze at his son fondly. "Sounds good, Potter. I'll leave my floo open." He snatched an apple slice off Scorpius' plate and took a bite, laughing warmly and reaching over to tickle his son as Scorpius shrieked with laughter. "D-D-Dadddy!"
Scorpius nodded as he was placed on the floor, his little snitch covered feet taking off with Perry dragging along behind him. Scorpius gently pushed open the door, head poking in before he shuffled to the bed. It took the short boy a few minutes but he eventually climbed on to the bed, grabbing on to the sheets to pull him up after gently placing Perry over the side of the bed with a small toss. He crawled over, plopping down near his daddy's head. With a small push to his shoulder, Scorpius giggled. "Daddy," he whispered loudly. "Daddy, wake up!" He tugged at the covers again, pulling them away from Draco's shoulder and exposing the skin to slightly colder air.
The little boy nodded after an encouraging smile from both Harry and Draco, holding out a little, pale hand. He liked Harry... he thought as Hermione grasped his hand gently. Harry protected him just like Daddy. Maybe Harry would figure out what was wrong with him so he could get all better and so his daddy would be happier. His daddy has been very sad since Scorpius got sick, he just wanted it all to go away. His arm tightened around the unicorn. He wanted to get better, to make his daddy happy.
Draco accepted the mug with a small thanks, both hands coming to clasp at the warmth as he took a small sip, humming in acceptable pleasure. "Look Harry..." he spoke quietly after a few tense moments, Scorpius' chatter echoing from his bedroom. "I can't thank you enough, I really can't. What you're doing for Scorpius..." His voice dropped to a mere whisper, his heart thundering in his chest. "What you're doing for me." He swallowed past the lump in his throat, taking another small sip of tea. "I can never repay you for this."
He rubbed a hand slowly over his face, nodding his head ever so slowly, as if he needed to encourage himself to give a response. "Okay then, Potter..." He went back to gazing at the papers in his lap; his 'thanks' didn't need to be said.
Draco laughed warmly, shaking his head as Scorpius ran off, Draco keeping a warm, silver-hued eye on him. "At this point, I think you're going to break me, Potter."
"Well, she has a five year old. She can handle five year old havoc." And, sure enough, Harry could hear her laughing as they made their way down the hall.
"I will." And, because he couldn't resist, Harry walked over and wrapped his arms around the blonde, dragging him close and pressing their lips together a final time.
As Draco was laid gently on top of the covers of his bed, his hand came to grasp at Harry's hand. "Potter..." he mumbled, eyes cracking open just slightly to reveal swimming pools of silver. "Thank you." The hand fell back to the bed, Draco sleeping soundly for the first time in a long time with reassurance that his child would be taken care of. Maybe everything was finally looking up for the Slytherin.
"You're welcome," Harry murmured, getting the blonde under the covers with as little disturbance as possible before striding out.
Draco rolled his eyes, an expression of warmth, of laughter, taking over his face as he leaned down, pressing his lips to Harry's softly. "Oh shut it, Potter." He murmured.
"Mmhm!" The child hummed in agreement, peels of laughter quickly leaving his lips as Draco reached over and tickled Scorpius's tummy, the little boy wiggling around and laughing, the sound filling the room and making its way down the hall.
Harry's mouth had gone completely dry at the sight of him. He hadn't really thought there was a body underneath all those clothes. He cleared his throat, tearing his gaze away and looking down at Scorpius. And then his breath caught. Merlin, he was tiny. Harry could practically see his bones. "Cor," he whispered, shocked that anyone would refuse to see these two because of a war that was long since in the past. He shook himself out of it, squatted down to the child's level and smiled at him. "Why don't you want a bath?"
Draco nodded, cuddling Scorpius to his chest for a few seconds before he kneeled down, setting the boy on his feet gently. Draco adjusted the little boys scarf and re-zipped his jacket before giving a quick peck to his forehead. 'Nothing happened, it was all okay,' Draco continually told himself as he gathered Scorpius back in to his arms, his heart giving a small lurch as the little boy's fingers curled against his simple, black long-sleeved shirt.
Draco gave a small chuckle as he followed behind the brunette as he made he way to the kitchen. "Did Scorp take his vitamins?"
Hermione blinked back tears, watching them go. She looked at Harry once they'd rounded the corner, voice lowered to a whisper. "Oh, Harry, this isn't good at all."
Draco's heart stopped. "Scorpius!" He instantly rushed inside, kneeling next to his son and lifting his head, swallowing back the bile that rose in his own throat as blood dripped from between his fingers. "Gemma!" he commanded to the House-Elf, acting on instinct. "Get a Healer, immediately!"
There was nothing in this boy to suggest any sort of abuse, Harry decided. Absolutely nothing. He was happy, excitable, and clearly doted on. Harry's next smile was for Draco. "I never expected you to live in a mixed complex," he commented.
Draco reached for the hand that Harry offered after standing up, pulling himself to his feet and lacing their fingers with a small smile. "I guess so. Come on," he nodded his head towards the living room. "Scorpius sounds like he is wreaking little five year old havoc on the pregnant healer."
Draco gave a small sigh from across the room, approaching the youngster slowly and kneeling down. "Scor, you have to. I made the water slightly colder this time, so no dizziness okay?" Draco look at the child with a small, patient smile, but anyone could see there was almost a pleading gesture in his eyes. Draco had gotten no sleep for the past few days, it seemed.
Draco gave another small grin, shaking his head. What was he? A Hufflepuff? The thought had him cringing. "Okay, Scorpius needs his vitamins in the morning. They're already together in a small cup near the sink. He'll probably ask for apple pancakes or something along those lines. That's fine, as long as he has a small glass of milk with them. Nothing too large or he'll get violently sick. Make sure you both wash your hands before then since his immune system is... practically non-existent." He gave a small sigh, his shoulders slumping. "And don't even bother changing him out of his pajamas... Just... let him relax. He'll need to be up before nine am or he won't sleep the next night and..." he paused, slumping back against the couch. "I really should just take care of this; it's too much to remember."
"They've been to a few healers, but none of them have been helpful in the slightest. They say he's a squib with magic, but the magic isn't taking. It's turned on him, it's wearing him down. And no one can say why or how. The father's been to libraries all over the world trying to find something. There's nothing, no explanation."
A sleepy smiled pulled at Draco's face, his eyes warming at the sight of his son. He wrapped an arm around him, pulling him close to his body and kissing his head. "Oh really? Did you thank Mr. Potter?"
"Hermione wants to see him again, later tonight after she's had time to review his files. Is that alright?"
Scorpius gave a squeal of laughter, curling up on himself and clutching his stomach. "H-Harry!" Perry flew to the side of the bed as Scorpius looked up at Harry with wide silver eyes, brightened with laughter and a large smile of pearly white teeth.
"I realize that." Harry threaded his fingers through Draco's hair, smiling slowly since Draco was awake and everything seemed to be alright. "I have something for you."
"Good job," Harry praised, setting a small plate of pancakes before him and whisking the two cups away. He bent over to place a kiss on the top of his head, unable to resist.
Scorpius giggled, hugging Harry tightly around the neck and placing a sloppy kiss on his cheek before reaching down and, using his hands, tore off a piece of a pancake and plopped it in his mouth with the happiest hum he could manage.
"I don't doubt that." Harry stroked his fingers lightly down Draco's back. "We'll get your magic back, alright? It's not fair that they cage it up inside of you. You were definitely never a weak wizard."
“Wait!” Malfoy cried out, a bit louder than necessary, and when Harry turned back to him he looked a little shocked that it had come out like that.
It wasn’t until the beginning of the second week that they finally ran into each other in the dining tent. It had been inevitable that it would happen eventually but Harry was still surprised.
He pressed in, wanting to absorb every part of this experience when he felt something hard and undeniable press against his hip. He just managed to stop himself from leaping backwards, but Malfoy must have noticed his reaction because he put a hand on Harry’s collar and pushed him back again.
Ten minutes later as she was holding the floo powder, she turned back to him. “We’re going to be at the Pickle and Pumpkin on Thursday at seven. I know you’re busy, but it would be lovely for everyone to see you.”
“You’re not really going to duel him are you Harry?” Hermione sounded a bit panicked as Harry relayed the notes to her and Ron.
A noise from behind Malfoy’s shoulder made him swing around. Both boys held their breaths and stared at the entryway; it was the distinctive sound of Filch's shuffling footsteps. Malfoy looked back at Harry in panic, and without seeming to think, reached down and pulled him to his feet by his robes. The footsteps had suddenly stopped and Harry thought in horror he heard the sound of the door opening. Malfoy was still holding onto his robes and shoved him roughly into the cubicle right on the end. Harry blinked at him as he locked the door and climbed up on the toilet seat.
“Good,” he replied unnecessarily, and then because he couldn’t bear the silence: “Did you have a good night, then?”
“They had the America’s Cup here in 2000,” Tamsin Applebee told him as they stood on the deck overlooking the boats.
“Thank you so much for agreeing to this interview, Mr Potter.” Skeeter flicked one taloned finger and her Quick-Quotes Quill began scribbling furiously. Harry was filled with a deep and acute sense of impending doom.
This was proven when, a moment later, they watched as a very shaky looking boy who couldn’t have been a day over seventeen mounted his broom and launched into the game. He looked about the same age as Coote, but he had none of his natural confidence on the broom and looked so nervous Harry was worried he might just fall off.
“Leave some room in there for my stuff,” Harry said, pointing at the wardrobe. Malfoy gave him a look of disbelief.
“...alright? And now off to your accommodation where you can settle! You will notice that it is a more Muggle friendly establishment than you’ll be used to in Britain. Our Statute of Secrecy decrees that we live alongside Muggles so we try to assimilate as much as possible.” Chanel began to direct them towards the exit.
Harry glanced at the clock and decided to shelve further introspection for another time. He had to get to a meeting with the English trainer, after which he practically passed out in his bunk, Davies already snoring in the other one. It was nearly three days before he had a spare moment to sit and consider it all.
“Hello, Lucy. It is a pleasure to meet you.” He held out his hand and she shook it firmly. “What can I help you with?”
He opened his mouth to respond but before he could someone cleared their throat. Harry swivelled around and almost jumped out his skin when he saw Pansy Parkinson standing in the doorway.
“To you. You don’t owe anybody else anything at all but you do owe it to yourself to be happy.” She looked resolute. “And you owe it to the people who love you not to have to worry about you dying for at least a few years.”
Later Harry wouldn’t be able to remember who lent forward first, perhaps it was at the same time, but one minute they were staring into each other’s eyes and the next their lips had met in the middle. It was a small, chaste act but to the two small boys balanced precariously upon the toilet seat, it was the whole world. The bathroom and Hogwarts disappeared around them and Harry could swear he heard thunder and felt lightning. They clutched onto each other, Malfoy’s small, cold hand resting on Harry’s burning cheek, light and dark, like two halves of a whole.
The wizarding part of the building included a courtyard that could only be accessed from the elevator with a password.
Harry stared down at his outstretched hand and instinctively reached out to shake it before he could stop himself. “That sounds pretty fucking similar to gloating.”
“You know,” she said thoughtfully, seeming to notice that he’d gone a bit quiet. “The only reason we don’t invite you to those anymore is that you never came last year. You’re always welcome.”
“You haven’t been getting out of the house much in the past few months. We’re just worried about you,” Hermione said, watching him with wide eyes.
“It’s Draco, actually, but I’ll take it.” Harry didn’t need his glasses to know Malfoy was smirking. He groaned again and pushed his face deeper into the pillow. Malfoy sighed. “As much as I wish that we could stay here all day exchanging witty banter you do actually need to get up.”
The music began to swell, and Harry watched as Hermione and her dad made their way down the aisle. She looked beautiful, as always, but there was something radiant in her smile when she glanced up and made eye contact with Ron.
“What have ya got there?” the wizard asked, peering at the magazine in Harry’s hands. “Ah! Benjy Williams, an excellent Seeker.”
He gripped Harry tightly and surely, moving slowly but with a slight twist that made Harry shiver all the way down to his toes. It was so different to the way Harry would do it to himself. He wondered absently if this was how Malfoy liked it.
Malfoy stood up and stretched his arms above his head as he began his warm down routine. He moved on to stretch his legs and back and Harry realised that he was standing in the corner watching him like a weirdo. He couldn’t quite bring himself to leave.
“Mr Potter, I hear you’re thinking of becoming an Auror. I’m here to tell you that that is a terrible idea,” she had said briskly, with no introduction.
“No, I just want another one.” He tried not to sound too annoyed - now that he’d made his decision he just wanted to get it over with.
Like Bill and Fleur so many years before, Ron and Hermione opted to have their wedding at the Burrow, but theirs was quite a different affair. Harry had been (against his will) roped into a lot of the planning so he had the odd experience of knowing almost everything that was going to happen throughout the day.
“I thought I was supposed to be one being sick,” Hermione laughed, rubbing his back. Ron sent her an apologetic look, and they all fell silent again.
Brisbane was hotter than Sydney, or maybe it just felt that way because it was so bloody humid. Harry could practically hear his hair expanding as soon as he stepped outside.
He was crushing Draco into the mattress, but he wanted to be even closer. He wrapped one arm around the back of Draco’s neck and the other around his waist, burying his head in Draco’s neck, pushing in again and again.
After a few minutes of walking in silence, they spotted a wooden bench and sat down next to each other. When Ginny finally spoke, she sounded more sober than she had at the bar. “I’m really glad you came on this trip.”
Campbell was playing extraordinarily well, but the Snitch was being evasive. Harry watched as he hovered above the players, eyes darting around the pitch. He could tell the exact second that Campbell spotted the little glint of gold next to the Cannon’s second Beater’s foot.
She smiled ruefully and took her hand back, tucking it into her lap. “Yeah, I know what you mean. It’s been weird not being able to talk to you. I don’t want to get back together or anything, though, just to be clear.”
Just then Mrs Weasley came out to announce the last call for seconds on the pudding and Benjy leapt to his feet. “Forgive me but one of the greatest perks of retirement is being able to eat as much dessert as I like, so I’ll have to leave you, but Harry? I hope you take on board what I said.” He pulled Harry into another firm hug. “If you need anything at all don’t hesitate to owl,” he said seriously, squeezing Harry’s shoulder, and then he was gone.
“Arse,” Draco sniffed, and just like that the tension was broken. “I’m not staying at my flat in London, though,” Draco said. “So I hope you’re prepared to come to Scotland with me.”
Draco looked back at him, expressionless. The only thing that gave him away was the white of his knuckles where he clutched his banana. It was funny how Harry could read him like that now. A year ago he would have been pissed off to get that blank look from him.
Lucy — that meant she belonged to the one who had been a prefect when Draco had been at school, Percy. Something about this child who he had never met calling him her uncle made his throat feel rather tight.
Quidditch was the only thing keeping him from fully losing the plot so he threw himself into it completely, and luckily for him there was a lot of it. He had training every day with the England squad.
Malfoy wasn’t bending his legs to reach Harry, he realised with some delay. He was looming over him. Harry's pride decided that that just wouldn’t do. He pushed Malfoy off him and pulled them around so that the taller man’s back was now pressed against the wall instead. Harry really hadn’t thought this through, however, because now the ball was very much in his court.
Almost all Seekers fall into one of two categories, Benjy Williams had told Harry on his first day after being signed with Puddlemere. There are hawks, like Harry and Benjy, powerful players who tend to either stay away from the action or barrel through when they need to. Then you have your falcons - usually smaller, but not always. They’re less powerful but a bit faster and fucking sneaky. They’ll fly rings around the Beaters and they’re usually the ones playing up for the crowd.
“Pick people up, go home with them,” Harry mused, gnawing on the inside of his cheek. “Aren’t you worried that people will find out?”
“G’day, mate!” she yelled in his ear in the worst Australian accent he’d ever heard, grinning widely. He winced at the volume. “Well done on the game. You’re a fucking star.”
“Harry, please just consider it,” Parvati said desperately. “It’s been over a year since your last interview. The public needs to hear from you.”
She beamed at him and pulled him back into a hug. When they finally separated, Harry found that he was half scared to look at Ron, who hadn’t said anything yet.
“It feels like everything is vibrating very, very slightly,” Harry said and then flushed when Malfoy snorted. “What?” He demanded, turning to look at Malfoy defensively.
“A quick word, if you don’t mind.” Her voice was quiet but commanding. He sat back down without a word. She cleared her throat. “I’m going to say two things - the first as Draco’s agent and the second as his friend. Please take both into consideration.”
The bathrooms were huge and covered floor to ceiling in black tile, reminding Harry of the inside of a snake’s stomach - which was a little bit too close to home, if he was honest.
The morning of Scotland versus England was overcast and cold. Harry had to cast a warming charm over his gloves to keep his fingers from going numb. He did his best not to overthink the game but it was hard - the Cup was so close he could practically feel it in his hands.
“Fuck, my head hurts.” His voice was so croaky and sleepy that it made Harry’s heart do a funny little twist. Draco turned his head and his eyes widened a bit when he saw Harry next to him. “What are you doing here?”
Draco took a breath, finding a strange calm in Harry’s sudden anxiety. Harry was an interesting person for Draco to be in a relationship with because he felt everything with such intensity. While Draco’s feelings were a complex knot of threads that needed to be teased out carefully, Harry’s were like fireworks — everyone in a four-kilometre radius could see them. When he was happy it seemed to pour out of him, and when he felt in any way upset he was incapable of hiding it. It had taken a while to get used to, but there was something comforting in knowing that whatever Harry felt, good or bad, Draco would know.
Hermione started to rise, but found herself rather stuck. Harry took the cue of her wordless gesture and rose in her stead, going towards the blonde. "None of the other healers have given you a time frame?" he asked quietly.
"Sweet Merlin, you're gorgeous," Harry managed, closing both hands over Draco's shaft to double his efforts.
He gave a haughty smirk, leaning in to Harry's touch just slightly as he removed his head from the others chest. He paused, trying to form a sentence that was just on the tip of his tongue. "I..." A deep breath later, and Draco mumbled quietly, "Thanks again, Potter."
"You better. Can't have you crushing my son's heart at the prospect of a new father, now can you?" Draco chided lightly, walking down the hallway, his hand clasped firmly in Harry's as he reached Scorpius's door. "Scorp?" He knocked lightly before pushing the white door open, ignoring the signs that said 'Scorpius's Room!' in big blue letters with a small child-drawn unicorn picture below. 'And Perry!'
Malfoy snorted in amusement as he fixed the shoulder strap of his bag, rolling one sleeve up to reveal the smooth, silky pale skin of his right arm. He checked his watch. "It may as a shock to you, Potter. But yes, me and Scorpius do in-fact live in a part Wizarding part Muggle complex." He looked up from the small black device on his slim wrist when Scorpius gave a shriek of laughter and went to chase after a small horde of ducklings a few feet in front of them.
“If he hexes me in my sleep you owe me,” he said finally, vowing to get his revenge next time Wood asked him for a favour.
“Harry…” he breathed into his mouth. With his other hand, he squeezed Harry and then began to jerk him in earnest. Not wanting to be left behind, Harry did the same to him.
“Then what is it?” Malfoy asked, and then his eyes narrowed and he took a small step forward. “Is it because it was with a man?”
“Fuck yes, I am! Why aren’t you?” she asked, jamming her finger into his chest. He shrugged and she immediately pushed her half-full drink into his hand. “Drink up, big boy.”
“Not until you admit that you’re jealous of Cami,” Malfoy was fully smirking now and it made Harry furious and turned on all at once so instead of doing the mature thing and walking away he stepped forward and shoved Malfoy with all his might. Unfortunately, Malfoy must have been expecting that because he captured Harry’s wrists and held them tightly. “Just say you were jealous and I’ll let you go,” he teased.
“Alright, I think that’s quite enough of this conversation for now. I’m going to take you back to your room,” he said gently but firmly.
Harry felt his face heat up. “Oh, god, don’t remind me. I’m sorry about that.” He took a large swig of beer to cover his embarrassment. Krum laughed loudly and clapped him on the shoulder.
Harry shrugged. “I didn’t really want to go out last year, and now it feels like it’s been too long.”
“Sorry, I really don’t.” Harry took a large swig of beer in the vain hope that it would settle his nerves.
“I don’t think I’ve ever seen a house-elf kid before,” Harry observed, shoving in another spoonful of porridge.
With that, he turned on his heel and stalked back down the corridor without so much as a look back. Harry, who could suddenly breathe again, leant back against the door. He couldn’t quite believe how angry he had just become over so little. It seemed that there was still nothing and no one on earth who could piss him off the way Draco Malfoy could.
It had been a few months since the disastrous game against Montrose, and the press was having a field day with the feud between them.
He heard Malfoy move in his bed and turn on his side to face him. “No, I'm not worried about what the press will say. For one, we’re in a foreign country and I think even Rita Skeeter has her limits. But more importantly, I’m not sure there is anything that they could write about me that’s worse than what they’ve already said. If I’m honest, I’d rather they write about my sex life than my family."
Harry made his way first to the cafe for a coffee and then to the apothecary for some hangover potion. All these nights out were burning through his store at a frankly terrifying pace.
Very, to be perfectly honest, but he didn’t want Malfoy to know that. The issue was, the adrenaline from seeing him was wearing off slightly and Harry could feel himself starting to sway.
Some time later, Harry woke up, still on the floor, and was dismayed to see the sky outside lightening from inky black to dark blue. His mouth tasted like an old sock and his head was pounding. He raised his head gingerly and realised that he was alone. Malfoy had left. He’d draped a blanket around Harry before he did, and Harry was grateful for it because it was freezing. With some effort, he managed to stagger to his feet and climb into bed where he lay, trying not to throw up as the world stopped spinning.
“You’d better make a beeline for the kitchen before the children see you,” Arthur said conspiratorially, guiding Harry’s shoulders in that direction.
The pair had barely spoken to each other the night before, just ate dinner downstairs with the team and then crashed in their respective beds, but Harry was pretty sure that Malfoy hadn’t mentioned that he needed to get up at the arse crack of dawn.
He leant back in his bunk and rested his head against the wall behind him. When he and Ginny had broken up it had felt almost like a death. He had been mourning everything that he’d thought they would have: a wedding, children, a life together. He’d felt like his future was empty and vast with nothing anchoring him or guiding him. This was nothing like that, because Harry had never really considered what a future with Draco could look like. Instead, he missed Draco himself, and it hurt even more - which was not something Harry had thought possible.
Harry actually had no idea, but he felt a certain level of satisfaction at knowing something Malfoy didn’t so he decided to play it up a bit. “Yeah, it’s a Muggle thing. You wouldn’t know it.”
“I’m not afraid of criticism. I’m just doing my best to focus on the game,” he said through gritted teeth.
“Alright, my mistake.” It was impossible to miss the amusement in Malfoy’s voice but Harry tried his best to ignore it.
“It certainly does, Murph! They’ve been swapping insults in the press since their last game, and it looks as though it might come to blows now.”
Her smile didn’t waver at all. “On the contrary, I’ve always had a passion for athletics, Mr Potter. Particularly when it involves strapping young men like yourself.”
“After Cup in 2002, I know it was hard for you.” Krum’s accent was thicker than usual and Harry wondered if he was choosing his words carefully.
It wasn’t awkward, exactly. Hermione, Ron and Ginny all did their best to ensure things were as natural as possible, but Harry still felt exposed and uneasy as everyone hugged and kissed him and told him how much they had missed him.
The following day, Harry made even more of an effort to be friendly. He got up at the same time as Malfoy, even though it pained him, because he found that being nice was much easier before Malfoy put on his carefully curated armour for the day. Throughout the day he made an effort to make conversation whenever he could, even if it was a bit stilted on Malfoy’s end. He even sat with him at lunch again, and this time Oliver, Angelina and Ginny joined them, much to Malfoy’s confusion. Harry had half expected a fight or another interrogation, but instead, he just ate his lunch, watching them warily.
Draco was just about to respond but before he could, Harry spoke. “We have nothing to hide but, with all due respect, when we are ready to do that it won’t be with you or any publication you are associated with.”
"Not without removing his entire immune system, and then even a sneeze would kill him within... hours. He'd have to spend years in isolation until we could be sure that his magic wouldn't be treated as a virus and that's no kind of a life. It's up to you, of course." Now her gaze went to Draco. "But if you had us do that, there's a strong chance that you'd never be able to hold your son again." The "he may as well be dead" hung heavy and unspoken.
"E-Eh?" The elder Malfoy mumbled quietly, eyes cracking open, his vision blurry. "S-Scorpius?" His voice was raspy with sleep. "Is everything alright?"
"Listen up, Hopkins, I don't give a bloody damn if I'm not a relative, I filled out the damn papers your bloody secretary gave me. And I have a page to prove that you have his wand and I want it. Now."
The blonde just shook his head, waving a hand with a muttered, "Whatever you wish, Potter." He went back to staring at the parchment in his lap, fingers creasing the tips of the paper in a nervous habit.
Draco shook his head, leaning back against the plain piece of linoleum and gazing at his son, arms coming to cross over his chest. He wouldn't bother telling Potter that he was awoken by a pesky owl with an "urgent" message telling him that Scorpius' Healers appointment for tomorrow had been cancelled as something "urgent" had come up- Which just, in fact, meant that the Healer that would be overseeing Scorpius that day didn't want to deal with the Malfoy name. He gave a small sigh.
Harry glanced up at Parvati in disbelief but she gestured for him to continue so he warily opened the magazine to page twenty-three. He was greeted by another photo of Malfoy - this time thankfully wearing a shirt - on his broom and in his Magpies practice gear. He was midair and the photo looped as he snatched a Snitch out of the air and winked into the camera. Harry quickly turned the page to the actual article, which was peppered with photos of Malfoy from school and his time in France. With another glance at Parvati, Harry began to read.
“You’ve earned it, Potter. I know this hasn’t been the easiest week.” She had to yell directly into his ear to be heard and he winced, hoping no one else at the table had heard her. The bar was much louder than the one in Sydney had been, with the bass almost shaking the tables.
“I can do it,” Harry said quickly and tried not to look too surprised at himself. Draco and the mediwitch  turned to him in astonishment.
“Of course I will.” Harry extracted himself with some difficulty and escaped, vaguely aware of the filthy look Pansy sent after him.
Harry laughed a little at that. “Yeah, I don’t think there would have been anything you could have said. I probably would have decked you with the state I was in.”
“I just wanted to say… Well, the thing is...” Harry knew he sounded like an idiot but he couldn’t stop and was relieved when Malfoy cut him off.
“I’ll give you two some space,” Harry said quickly, getting to his feet before being stopped by Draco’s hand on his arm.
Harry’s stomach did a funny little flip. Despite Draco’s best efforts to teach him he was still absolutely rubbish at flirting.
“Camille, this is Harry Potter,” he said, still holding her hand. Harry smiled at her stiffly and tried not to flinch when she leaned in and kissed him on both of his cheeks.
Ron was rapidly turning a shade of red that, in Harry’s opinion, did not look healthy. “Harry…” he started, sounding choked. ‘What are you… What’s Malfoy doing here?”
He caught up to Draco’s limp body a few feet above the ground and managed to catch him with both arms. Draco was bigger than him and dead weight. Harry felt his broom dip but he managed to fly them haphazardly to the ground with his knees. They landed softly, and Harry staggered from his broom to meet the medical team who had come running towards them. He carefully placed Draco on the ground and stepped away as the medics tended to him.
When he opened his eyes again it was morning and he was in a bed. He sat up and then immediately regretted it when his stomach rolled dangerously.
“Fucking yes.” Malfoy was babbling, head thrown back, one hand resting passively but possessively on the back of Harry’s head.
“It’s all in the hands and the centre of gravity.” He gripped the broom with his knees and flew a bit closer, moving Harry’s hands again, and then his hips. It took Harry another second to realise he was still talking. “...It’s kind of an internal twist.”
“Oh, shut up,” Harry huffed. “If you just called to make fun of me, I’m hanging up.” It was an empty threat but Malfoy didn’t need to know that.
Thankfully Harry was spared the post-match press conference as he hadn’t played, but as he was walking into the changing rooms Wood and Malfoy passed him on their way to the press box. He gave Malfoy a courteous nod, but Malfoy simply looked through him. He found that it bothered him far more than it should have.
He stewed in his rage for nearly an hour, until his pot of tea had grown cold and the patrons coming and going grew more intoxicated. One o’clock in the morning rolled around and he decided that he had given Malfoy more than enough time to find somewhere else to get blown. He made a decision.
which featured Benjy Williams swooping towards the camera in his old-school Puddlemere gear. It must have been from his first year with the club because the headline read:
“I thought that we could go for a fly up the loch a little, there’s a gorgeous view from the top of the…” Draco trailed off as he entered the room fully and saw Harry’s face. “What’s wrong?”
Malfoy made a little noise of pleasure as the man ducked his head even further, and Harry came back to himself. He quickly stepped back and shut the door, but as it was closing he saw Malfoy’s eyes snap open. He met his gaze for a fraction of a second.
“Suit yourself,” Draco replied. He stripped down to his underwear, leaving his Quidditch clothes in a neat pile on the rocks and then made his way into the water.
Malfoy gripped his hand tightly, using it to pull Harry towards him a step. “I never had you pegged for a sore loser, Potter.”
Strangely enough, he sort of did, so he nodded and let her drag him out of the bar. Luckily everyone else was either on the dance floor or too drunk to notice them leaving together.
They had a week until their next game, which Harry would be playing in this time. He wasn’t nervous exactly but he wanted to do well and so he just put his head down and trained. He and Malfoy fell into a regular, if not completely comfortable, routine.
“It’s called masturbation, Potter.” Harry choked slightly on his own spit but Malfoy wasn’t done. “Wanking, polishing your knob, cracking one off, badgering the witness, self pleasure…”
Harry kept that up, bobbing up and then down as far as he could. He wanted to keep going, to keep Malfoy making those noises, but his jaw was getting sore and he was struggling to keep up a rhythm.
With some difficulty, Harry managed to extract his arm from the tangle and lifted it, Snitch clutched in his fist.
“Why do you think?” Harry snapped back, unable to help himself. “Now you’ll have all the privacy that you need to do whatever you want.”
He felt his face flush, and he rubbed his hand through the back of his hair, embarrassed. “For fuck sake, I’m sorry alright? I shouldn’t have made such a big deal out of walking in on you with that guy, it was none of my business. Are you happy?”
When he finally made it to breakfast he was relieved not to see Malfoy, and equally apprehensive to see Angelina. She waved him over cheerfully and slid a purple vial of hangover potion to him as he sat down.
He had expected Wizard’s Way to be like an Australian version of Diagon Alley but it wasn’t at all. To begin with, it was a lot smaller - basically, just a grassy square lined on four sides by a pub, an apothecary, a bookshop and a restaurant.
“I almost lost my job because of you,” he said quietly, with a laugh, reaching out to brush Draco’s hair from his forehead. Knowing that Draco couldn’t hear him made him brave. “It was worth it, though. I couldn’t watch you fall like that and not do anything.” He watched Draco’s chest rise and fall, tracing over the ridges of his face with his thumb, smoothing his eyebrows. “I think I might have given us away, though. Pansy was looking at me like I’d snogged you in the middle of the field.”
“Yeah, of course,” Harry replied and was rewarded with an enormous grin from Ron and another bone-rattling slap on the back.
“Look, if we’re not going to fight then I think I’ll go back to bed,” Harry said a bit desperately, turning to walk back towards the door.
Draco wasn’t waiting in Harry’s hotel room, and he wasn’t in Harry’s bed either, which Harry collapsed onto as soon as he got in. He was so exhausted that he didn’t even bother to take his shoes off.
The hotel in Prague was nice but bare, just a bed and a bathroom. As soon as he walked in Harry felt that familiar loneliness sink into his bones. He could go out, but most of the team were turning in early before they left in the morning so he would be alone in a city where he didn’t speak the language. It wasn’t the most appealing thought.
“No, I suppose not,” Harry replied, lamely. He imagined for a fleeting moment, as he had so many times before, what their wedding would have been like. He’d always pictured something similar to Bill and Fleur’s but that may have been because that was the only wedding he’d ever attended. It suddenly occurred to him that that might not have been Ginny’s style at all. “I didn’t realise that Hermione was so good at this kind of thing.”
Harry squeezed his eyes shut, rubbing his eyebrow and willing the red haze to disappear. “Um, I mean… I think you know the answer to that one.”
Malfoy’s mouth twisted into that smirk that made him look like his twelve-year-old self. “That’s not very sportsmanlike.”
“That’s what I wanted to ask you.” Davies looked stern. “I know things haven’t been easy for you the past few years but we need you on top form this season. How’s that going?”
He got back on his broom and began to lap the stadium. It was dark now and the only lights illuminating the pitch were those coming from the tunnels and the moon. He took long, deep inhales of the crisp night air which still vaguely smelt of pork pies and butterbeer.
The awful icing on the miserable cake of Harry’s day was when Wood handed him and Malfoy matching room keys upon arrival at the team hotel. The realisation dawned that he would be spending the next month sharing a room with Malfoy. Harry wondered if it was too late to get back on the Portkey.
“What do you want?” Malfoy asked, quieter this time. He placed a hand on the wall next to Harry’s head.
“It’s no good you trying to be brave - I’ve been through this and worse so I know you must have a bloody sore head.” Harry watched him carefully.
“I wish I could come with you,” Ron continued. “But if I left for a month at this stage in the wedding planning process I think Hermione might actually maim me.”
The Scottish team’s uniforms were light blue with a white saltire across the front and blue robes over top. They stood out well against the grey day. Harry’s eyes scanned the team until he found the little white-blond head.
Harry didn’t reply. He couldn’t. His chest felt tight and there was a rushing in his ears. Malfoy raised his eyebrows.
“I’m fine,” he insisted, but then he swayed again and this time Malfoy caught his arm, the one with the glass in it.
About six drinks and a few hours later he found himself on the deck again, not completely certain when he’d left the table. Christ, he was pissed. Tamsin was sitting on one side of him, chatting earnestly about Antipodean Opaleyes - or something like that? Harry had lost the thread of conversation almost immediately and hadn’t been able to tune back in since.
The next few hours sped by in a blur of free drinks and easy conversation. Ginny was on top form and he found himself slipping into his old habit of just watching her hold court with the team. She always sparkled under the attention of a group, and as he watched her put Wood in a headlock he felt a familiar swell of affection.
Harry watched the loop over and over, growing increasingly annoyed with each repetition. It wasn’t fair that the
There was another murmur of laughter from the crowd, louder this time, and Draco relaxed back into his seat, relishing the feeling of regaining control of the room.
“Yes, she’s his agent,” Parvati replied absently, sifting through a stack of papers in front of her. “We’re going to have to counter it in some way and I think I have just the ticket.”
Getting back to England was a relief, but not in the way Harry would have thought. He found that, as he walked through his front door, his house felt dark and a bit miserable after the wide and bright open spaces of Australia. It didn’t help that so many of the rooms were still closed up, with the furniture covered in sheets. The sparseness of his life which had felt safe and cosy a month ago now felt a bit claustrophobic.
The next few weeks were so hectic that Harry almost managed to forget about the little slip of paper burning a hole in his wallet. Almost.
” he read and then stepped back when Draco flipped it open and an overpowering stench of old fish filled the room. “Fucking hell!”
“You’re wrong.” Harry felt his eyes burning and he adjusted his glasses to swipe over them with the heel of his hand in frustration.
It took them about twice as long as it should have to get back because they were both too far gone to Apparate without splinching themselves, and they kept stopping every few feet to feel each other up.
It was an unreasonably cold night, even the paintings seemed to be dressed a little more warmly, and Harry prayed that he wouldn’t pass anyone as his breath was turning to steam in front of his eyes. By some miracle he didn’t, he could hear Peeves creating havoc in some faraway classroom and hoped that that was keeping any nearby teachers occupied. He hesitated a few metres away from the door to the bathroom, nibbling unconsciously on the inside of his cheek before steeling himself.
They’d played against each other during the Christmas game and it had gone about as well as expected. Although Harry had managed to scrape a win in the end, he’d had to blow up a few Quaffles in the storage room to get out his frustration afterwards.
All at once, they were incredibly close. Harry wondered if he had ever been this close to another boy, or girl for that matter. He had given Ron a hug on a few occasions but it was more of a slap on the back, they had certainly never held onto each other in this manner. He was very very aware of how close their faces were, noses almost touching. Malfoy’s hand on his mouth was hot and clammy and Harry pulled back a bit, shaking it off. Harry noticed that Malfoy’s hair wasn’t slicked back like it normally was, it was just damp, as though he had just washed it, and it hung more relaxed around his pointy face.
He could feel every inch of Draco’s body against his, shivering and straining. His mouth was pressed up against Harry’s ear, whimpering and babbling into it.
Harry couldn’t help himself: he snorted with laughter. He could hear the crowd chattering behind them and knew they were listening. It felt right, like riding his favourite broom.
“He could take him, Hermione! All you’d need to do is insult his robes and the greasy git would probably have a cry,” Ron snickered at his own joke. “It won’t be a real duel anyway if it’s just the two of you.”
To anyone thinking of doing a fest: I never thought I'd be able to do something like this and I did, so if I can you can too!
“Your breakup with Ms Weasley, to begin with, seemed to have impacted you significantly, both personally and professionally.”
Harry nodded, and she took a deep breath. “He projects this image of not caring what anyone thinks about him, but it isn’t real. He cares more than anyone I’ve ever met. He just uses that facade to protect himself.”
Unable to keep reading, Harry slowly closed the magazine and took a few deep breaths. It was a puff piece, that was for sure. Harry hadn’t expected any less from that publication, but the thing that struck him the most was the casual reference to the war as if it had been a piece of bad publicity. That was just offensive on every level.
and amongst many Quidditch commentators, but, as Davies said, they’d proved them all wrong: they’d won the 2004 British and Irish League Cup and the respect of the Quidditch community.
Harry sighed and leaned back in his chair. “Not particularly,” he grumbled, but she ignored him, pulling a piece of paper out of the stack with a triumphant noise.
Draco’s bed faced the fireplace, and when Harry stepped out and caught sight of the scene on the bed, he almost stumbled back into the green flames.
She wasn’t wrong. It had been, as Oliver Wood would say, a shite week. He knew he was being ungrateful to be this miserable during a once in a lifetime tour, but he couldn't help it. He and Malfoy weren’t getting along any better so he just felt weird and anxious in their room. Part of Harry knew he should make more of an effort to get along with him but Malfoy made it bloody difficult. He had helped Harry today though, in his own strange way. Harry couldn’t wrap his head around why but he had to admit that the words of encouragement had spurred him on, even if it wasn’t in the manner in which they had been intended.
“Right back at you,” Malfoy replied, and promptly hung up, leaving Harry staring at the phone in astonishment.
“Cheers.” Malfoy laughed and turned to roll his eyes at Harry, then paused at the look on Harry’s face. “Oh, you’re serious?”
“Different is good,” Krum grinned at him, uncharacteristically wolfish. “Anyway, not look too different in gym.”
He made himself look back at her, pushing the horrible feeling down with another swig of beer. “Right.” He forced a laugh. “Yeah, of course.”
Harry awoke uncharacteristically early. The sun was breaking over the horizon, and he found himself drawn to the window. He wrapped the quilt around himself - the Scottish morning air was sharp - and sat on the deep stone window seat. The golden light was just reaching the edge of the loch when suddenly it caught and the water lit up, sparkling like it was made of jewels.
Malfoy didn’t reply but he turned around fully and leaned back, bracing his elbows against the rails, still cradling his glass in one hand. The light from the room, which had looked ethereal on his back, made his chest and torso look like they were cut from marble. Harry had the inexplicable urge to reach out and touch the skin, to see if it would be as smooth and cold as it looked.
“No.” Harry scrubbed a hand over his face. “We’ve been hooking up for a while, but it’s not like that.”
He didn’t seem angry which was a good sign but Harry decided to distract him. “I think Krum and Charlie Weasley might be dating.”
“Oh...erm...yeah I did go but we heard Filch coming so we didn’t get to have a proper fight,” It wasn’t
On the morning of the fifth day, Harry woke up in Draco’s bed. He stretched out in the sheets and luxuriated in the warmth of the blankets and the soft pillows. For a moment he couldn’t figure out what had woken him but then it came again, a tap-tap against the glass of the window.
Ginny, who had been in the middle of taking a swig of Firewhisky, choked violently. Alarmed, Harry thumped her on the back, concerned about the logistics of performing the Heimlich manoeuvre on a rooftop.
“If you’re going to be sick, please do it somewhere else,” Malfoy snapped and Harry recoiled, blinking at him.
The rest of the press conference went very smoothly after that and before long it was time to cut the ribbon and officially open the school for business.
With a beep, the door clicked open and they fell through it - literally. Harry only narrowly missed falling on his arse because Malfoy still had his arm around his waist.
Harry eventually dragged himself out of bed and brushed his teeth while Malfoy continued to preen himself in the mirror. Harry watched with morbid interest as he applied a series of expensive-looking potions to his hair.
Without waiting for a response he turned and stalked out of the room, leaving Harry alone to try to work out what had gone so wrong.
Malfoy thankfully didn’t speak again for a while as he unpacked his suitcase. Harry resisted watching but the ceiling wasn’t very interesting and after a few minutes of staring at it he found his gaze wandering inadvertently.
It wasn’t that Harry couldn’t tell when a man was attractive - he wasn’t like Ron who claimed that to him Davies and Filch were practically twins. But there’s a difference between noticing that someone is attractive and being attracted to them, wasn’t there?
Harry all but ran down the corridor away from the room, Malfoy and the man. He didn't slow down until he got to the elevator. Once inside, he smashed the button to make the doors close and then pressed the one for the lobby. He felt lightheaded and furious and had to lean against the wall of the lift to catch his breath.
Once again, thank you to my incredible editor, flatmate, wine review colleague and friend Lucy for everything you do.
The hallway outside his door was wide with a grey stone floor, he followed it back the way they had come up and found that past the stairs there was a long gallery which stretched the entire length of that side of the keep.
The next time they saw each other was for the European Cup playoffs in France. As the two top teams in the United Kingdom and Ireland, Puddlemere and Montrose were invited to participate alongside teams from a dozen other countries.
Harry opened his mouth to argue and then realised what he was doing and shook himself. “You’re right,” he said finally, shaking his head ruefully. “You got me, I was just winding you up.”
For the first time in his life, looking at the picture of Malfoy, he wondered if that was normal. Did Ron and Cormac feel like that? Did they keep their eyes lowered when their mates were walking around naked in the changing room?
“Exactly - but underneath that, he cares so much. That’s why he came back from France. It hurt to know that his home country hated him so much. He wanted to come back and fix things.”
As soon as he staggered to his feet he was mobbed by his team. The noise in the stadium was deafening, and he clutched onto the Snitch for dear life.
“I’m going to demonstrate. I want you to fly towards me like you’re going to start a chase, and then watch what I do very carefully.”
They switched positions with no small amount of difficulty but eventually Harry was situated between Draco’s legs. He watched his face carefully as he licked a long stripe up Draco’s dick, and was rewarded with a moan that gave him the boost of confidence he needed to take the head into his mouth and suck it lightly.
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Harry was so indignant that he forgot his self-control and opened his eyes. Malfoy was facing away from him, folding his trousers, wearing nothing but very tight pants. The magazine cover blazed in his memory. Harry gulped and quickly looked away when Malfoy turned to look at him.
He watched as the photo Malfoy winked at the camera over and over. It wasn’t as if Harry had never seen him with his shirt off - in fact, he’d probably seen him like that every day in the past month - but there was something different about being able to drink his fill of looking without any danger of being caught.
“Merlin, I’m impressed. I didn’t think you had it in you, Potter,” Malfoy laughed breathlessly, infuriatingly not bothered in the slightest by the hit.
“Sorry, ma lad, I didn’t mean to give ya a fright,” he chuckled in an Australian accent which seemed to curl up at the ends.
Harry thought about Charlie playing Quidditch in the backyard with the kids, his face flushed from the wind, his tattoos peeking out from under the sleeve of his t-shirt. He cleared his throat, embarrassed.
“Remember what I say: to win is not most important thing.” Krum gave him one knowing look and stomped off to the changing rooms.
Harry thought about telling him not to treat him like a house-elf but found he didn’t really mind. That's what he signed up for, after all.
“That’s not it,” Harry cut him off. If he was honest with himself, that was a decent part of it, but right now he was happy to delay that particular freakout until later.
Harry flipped briefly through the yellowed pages, but before he could begin reading any of it, there was a cough to his left. Harry nearly him jumped out of his skin. A tiny elderly wizard with dark skin and long grey hair stepped out from behind the front desk.
They were standing almost nose to nose now and in the half-light Malfoy’s face looked sharp and nasty.
Harry perked up at that. “I’ve already explored most of the house but I saw that there was a practice pitch as we were driving in.”
Harry almost jumped out of his skin for the second time that night. “Jesus, Ginny, don’t sneak up on me like that.”
Ginny let out a hysterical bark of laughter, and Harry started to feel properly annoyed. “Oh, I’m not trying to be mean. It's just… You’re terrible at change. Worst I’ve ever known. By a mile.”
“Yeah, I just mean, maybe we shouldn’t hook up or anything. That way we can focus on playing and not get distracted.”
Malfoy’s face was unreadable. He seemed to be holding his breath. Fuck it, Harry thought recklessly and used the hand that was still in Malfoy’s hair to tug his head to the side, giving him access to his throat. Malfoy made another noise that made Harry feel lightheaded, but he concentrated on lavishing the same attention he’d just received onto Malfoy’s neck.
Harry stepped forward jerkily, and Draco didn’t stop. He kept watching Harry with that same intensity. Harry was torn between wanting to join him and not wanting to ruin the picture in front of him.
“Priya Patil, Patil Sports Management.” She had given him a brief and convincing sales pitch and within a week he was considering a contract with Puddlemere.
Ten minutes later, Harry headed home with a lighter wallet, a tiny silver thing that seemed far too small to be a real phone, and a renewed appreciation for magical modes of communication. When did the Muggle world get so confusing?
Harry did as he was told, flying towards him. He watched in amazement as Malfoy repeated the move he’d used in their first game. Never breaking eye contact, he turned his body and broom towards the left. Harry turned with him, but then, still facing left, his whole body and broom moved to the right and Harry found himself in the empty air where Malfoy had been.
“Well no, since you chickened out last year,” Harry couldn’t keep the annoyance out of his tone this time. “Why, have you been in a dual before?”
Harry had to fight with every inch of his might not to blow up. “As I said before, I’m here to talk about Quidditch. If you don’t want to ask me about that, I can leave.”
Draco shuffled over to drape himself across Harry’s chest, resting his chin on his hand so Harry had to almost cross eyed to look at him. “How was the wedding? Any gossip? Did anyone get up and object to the union?”
When they’d recovered themselves a little, Harry looked at them and felt affection swell up in his chest. “I really am happy for you two. This is really, really exciting.”
“Right,” Malfoy said, drawing out the word sarcastically. “So you’ve come to… What? Tell me off for speculating about your sexuality? Or lack thereof.”
After crashing into a side table and almost going into the wrong room, they managed to make it to Harry’s door.
Finally, he made it to the English camp. It was only half full as the players were still arriving. They’d designed it to feel like an English village, Ron had told Harry, with small cottages surrounding a square. There was even a village pub, despite the fact that Davies had explicitly banned them from drinking under any circumstances.
Even though Harry understood - and he truly did - he couldn’t help but wish that Ron would be there. With both Ginny and Malfoy coming, it was shaping up to be the single most uncomfortable month of his life. The only reason that he’d agreed to do it in the first place was that it was something to fill the horrible emptiness that was the off-season. Of course, when he signed up, he’d thought he would be celebrating winning the British and Irish League with a lovely holiday.
“Yes. No. I don’t know.” He felt horribly like he might cry. “We had an argument, I think - I don’t really know what happened. But it was for the best. I need to focus on the World Cup.”
“Alright Crabbe, jokes over can I have that back now please?” Harry tried to keep his tone light, hoping this would be straightforward. The larger boy stopped swinging it but instead of giving it back, leant over to Malfoy and whispered something in his ear.
“Harry Potter!” Harry winced, glancing around for a place to hide but before he could he felt a hand on his arm. He plastered on a smile and turned to see Mrs Patil.
Draco looked very small and pale lying in the hospital bed at St Mungo's in his blue and white pyjamas. There was a bandage wrapped around his head, plastering his hair to his forehead and causing it to stick up at the back.
They trained together all afternoon. Now that he was working through his cloud of resentment, Harry was able to admit that it was pretty fun playing and training with another Seeker, especially one as good as Malfoy. They were relatively evenly matched in most things - Harry was a bit faster but Malfoy played dirty and scrappy, and when they finally landed after an extremely fast-paced Seekers game, the tension between them seemed to have - well, not completely disappeared, but definitely thawed out.
In response, Harry opened his mouth and made loud chewing noises at Draco. “I’ll give you a mouthful,” he leered, earning himself a very hard punch on the arm.
“Nah you’re pulling my leg, you’re not Harry Potter.” The man shook his head, “You almost had me there.”
The next morning Harry poked his head into Draco’s room to find him pulling on his shoes and a coat, looking significantly healthier than he had the day before.
Harry felt incredibly uncomfortable. “I’d imagine that it had more to do with him being a former Death Eater than him being… you know...”
Roger Davies had been good-looking at school, but six years of being a professional Chaser had turned his puppy fat into hard muscles and given him the broadest shoulders Harry had ever seen in real life - not to mention the impressive moustache. He’d amassed a sizable fan club over the years, but since becoming captain of Puddlemere United a year ago there was hardly a young witch or wizard who didn’t have his moustachioed face hung on their wall. He was also annoyingly skilled at Quidditch, tapped to be the youngest English captain ever at the next World Cup.
“Oi, hands off my wife,” Ron said, swatting Harry’s head as he walked into the kitchen, then paused when he saw Hermione’s face. “Everything alright?”
“Erm, right.” Harry could feel the situation rapidly spiralling out of his control. “You want to meet someone else?”
Draco couldn’t help the very undignified snort of laughter that came out of him, which made Harry laugh too. He glanced up and found Skeeter glaring at them, which only made him laugh harder.
“There is…” Harry swallowed. He couldn’t believe he was about to talk to anyone about this, let alone Benjy. The Firewhiskey must have gone to his head. “There is someone. But we have a weird history. And they’re a Quidditch player. And anyway, I don’t even know if I want to be with them.”
Just as he was about to make up his mind there was a noise from the corridor outside and they both jumped away from each other. He glanced over Draco’s shoulder and saw there was no one there, but the moment was broken and Draco was already stepping away. With a mutter, he transfigured his cuffs and fastened them. He glanced back at Harry, running a critical eye over his robes. He did a complicated little movement with his wand and Harry felt his robes lift and then drop, creases gone.
Harry wasn’t sure what he meant by that but he didn’t have time to find out because the Snitch had reappeared less than 100 metres away, hovering above the Magpies' stands. This time he didn’t waste any time trying to be subtle, he just took off, Malfoy hot on his heels.
“People want to hate me - or they did when I first came back, anyway. If I was actually me on the pitch then the less savoury things people write or say about me would be about me - the real me. But if I play into their expectations and give them what they want, which is a good show, then the person they hate isn’t me - it's Draco Malfoy: Quidditch Player. Do you see?”
“You could have renewed it though, or gone somewhere else. Surely the Magpies weren’t the only team who wanted you?”
“Yeah, that was good,” Harry grinned. “I don’t think Oliver was best pleased, though. I thought he was going to deck me.”
Part of Harry had been surprised to learn that they’d both chosen the same profession but it sort of made sense: Malfoy had always been a good player, his father’s money notwithstanding. France had made sense too. In the years since the war, some former Death Eaters and sympathisers had managed to rebuild their public images, but it would take more than a few charitable donations to make everyone forget about Mafloy’s past.
Harry laughed, warm and deep. It was an unusual role reversal for him to be the one trying to get Draco up in the morning, but even through the sleepiness, he could feel Harry buzzing with excitement. “Come on.” He poked Draco in the ribs. “If you get up I’ll make you a cup of tea.”
Harry huffed in annoyance. It was all very well for her to say that. “I’m going to the loo,” he said grumpily and stomped off in the direction of the mens room.
The Wellington Wizards were a strong team but Harry was playing well. He spent the first half watching the other Seeker and mapping out his game plan, and then five minutes into the second half he spied it. The Snitch was up high, almost at the edge of the airspace. The Wizard’s Seeker hadn’t seen it but she had clearly seen Harry see it because she was tracking him. This meant that he couldn’t fly towards the Snitch without her seeing it, and she was far closer.
He looked good, in dark grey shorts with long black compression leggings and a black long sleeve Magpies shirt, all of which hugged his strong body beautifully.
Harry was still standing frozen in shock when Angelina appeared in front of him, “Get a move on, Potter, we have an inspirational speech to listen to.”
He opened one eye to see a very blurry Malfoy standing over him looking disgustingly awake. “Oh, god,” he moaned, closing his eyes again.
The bar was nicer than the ones they’d been to in Brisbane and Sydney, with warm moody lighting, velvet booths, and none of the urine smell the other bars had.
It was like he had created a file in his brain where he stored up things throughout the day to talk to Draco about, and now it was overflowing. If there had been any reception at all Harry would have tried to call him by now, but as it was he had to make do with looking at the back of his head in the dining hall.
Hours later, after the sun had set and the candles that floated high above the guest’s heads had been lit, Draco stood at the edge of the courtyard, watching quietly. He felt somehow both perfectly at peace and overwhelmed with nervous excitement for the future. Draco watched the guests milling about, dancing, drinking and laughing in equal measure. He should rejoin the party he knew, his mother would have had his head if she could see him neglecting his hosting duties, but he wanted to wait for just a moment more, to let himself absorb it for a little longer.
“Alright!” O'Flaherty rubbed her hands together. “What you’re not going to do is ask for Butterbeer or Firewhiskey or anything like that, okay? Just ask for whatever IPA they have on tap and then get out of there as fast as possible.”
“That achievement was a credit to you all, but it’s no good if we don’t maintain it, so I want you to take these next few games seriously. All the teams are gearing up for the World Cup qualifiers next year, so they’ll be trying to show off their best players hoping they’ll get picked. I’ve heard a few rumours about teams trying to get players back from America and Europe. They will be fighting tooth and nail for every point and we need to be ready. That means no distractions: you're not going on dates, you're not going out drinking, you’re working yourself to the brink of death on the pitch and then getting an early night, got it?” Davies glared at them one by one until they all nodded their agreement. “Wonderful. Now you can go and get changed, and then our fearless leader will be giving us a lengthy talk about the new uniforms or something.”
Malfoy walked towards him, making Harry back up nervously until he was pressed against the wall and Malfoy was very much in his personal space.
“Potter,” he drawled tiredly. “Do you mind delaying whatever sad little attempt at an apology you were planning until after I’ve unpacked my headache potion?”
He had quite a few things to say about it, actually, but he was well trained. “It’s style over substance. He should go back to France where he belongs.”
Snitch out of the sky, and Ron grinned the whole way home. Harry was also feeling pretty good, considering they were up to play the Magpies in two weeks.
Without his permission, Harry’s eyes flew to Malfoy, but he was just doing what he had been doing before. Harry watched as he reached up to pick a piece of lint off the other man’s shoulder. It made Harry feel a little sick. He was simultaneously morbidly curious and horrifically embarrassed.
They had been sniping at each other all game and the crowd loved it. Harry was even enjoying it a bit too, now that he understood the way that Malfoy did things a little better. Instead of feeling stung by his words, Harry felt himself enjoying the back and forth.
He didn’t miss the confused look that Hermione and Ron shared. “How long is a while?” she asked gently.
The place he took them to was less a bar than a club, with pounding music and big glittery ropes hanging from the high ceiling. Even though it was early the place was packed, and Malfoy seemed to know everyone. He kissed the bouncer on the cheek and then they were led to the back and through a door that took them into another, even more glamorous, room.
Harry followed him over to a table in a quieter part of the square and sat down across from his best friend.
“Oh my god,” Harry cut him off. He felt like he could possibly pass away from embarrassment at any moment. The worst part was it wasn’t not working for him. “Please stop.”
She made a derisive noise. “I don’t care what people expect. You’re not obligated to be anyone’s hero.”
With a sigh, Harry turned back to the game, focusing his attention on the Seekers who he was ostensibly there to observe.
Before long, the sitting room was teeming with friends and teammates, milling about and snacking on the sandwiches and tea that Una had laid out.
It was a truly ungodly hour when Malfoy finally slipped through the door. Harry wasn’t asleep - there was no chance of that - but he resented the brief flash of light from the corridor nonetheless. He listened to Malfoy bumping around the room with a growing annoyance.
“There’s no one. You’re insane.” Harry took a sip of tea to disguise his lying. “Did you come here to bully me or teach me how to use it?”
“One of the greatest lessons I’ve learnt over the past four years is that a player is only as good as those he plays against. It’s easy when you’re doing well to think that you’re entitled to winning, and having someone come in and make you question that is… challenging. When that happened to me, I didn’t handle it with the grace that I should have, but now I know that I would not be the player I am at this moment without that challenge. So my final thank you is to Draco Malfoy, who has forced me to work harder every game and play at a higher level than I ever thought I was capable of to keep up with him. England should be very proud to have produced him, and Scotland are lucky to have him.”
He realised belatedly that he had stopped moving and was just hovering above the pitch staring off into the night.
He hissed desperately, motioning wildly for Harry to climb up next to him. There were definitely footsteps coming down the corridor now and so he followed Draco’s instructions without argument. Luckily they were both small enough to fit on the seat but it was still a squeeze and Harry was forced to grip onto Malfoy’s shoulder to keep from falling backwards, as the Caretaker began to shuffle around the bathroom, muttering to himself.
Harry had a feeling that it was Draco who was avoiding his gaze now, fussing with the cuff a little longer than he needed to. Harry wanted to kiss him but he wasn’t sure whether or not he was allowed to. Was that what they were doing?
Harry sat back down and mulled over the conversation. What Benjy said had lodged itself in Harry’s brain. Perhaps he was being a coward for not doing what he knew he wanted to do. Without overthinking what he was doing, Harry reached into his pocket and pulled out his phone.
,” Harry said clearly, tapping his wand on the panel of buttons. There was a little clicking noise and the doors opened to reveal a square rooftop courtyard. The whole place was overflowing with plants Harry had never seen before: huge lush ferns, flowers bigger than him in bright primary colours, and a tree with leaves that seemed to glow. He thought for a moment that Neville would have had a field day here.
“I’ll just…” He motioned towards his shirt but didn’t move. They stood there staring at each other. He was very, very aware of the love bite on his shoulder.
Harry sent him a grateful smile. It felt good to have everyone on the team patting him on the back, even if all the attention was a tad embarrassing. When he looked up, he caught Malfoy’s eye from the other side of the table. Harry’s breath caught slightly in his throat at the expression on his face. He looked intense and focused, the way he looked when he was diving for the Snitch.
Malfoy ignored him, “So you really never try to pull, then?” He asked, propping his chin up on one hand. “Surely you’d have fans beating down your door to get a piece of the golden boy?”
“I feel like eating in the kitchen today,” he announced so Harry shrugged on a hoodie and they made their way down the narrow stone staircase to the kitchens.
“Can I ask you a question?” Harry asked as he lay on the bed in his hotel room in Japan, staring at the ceiling.
Draco was lying on the bed, legs spread, stroking himself lazily. He looked at Harry with something like pride or challenge when their eyes met. Harry watched, frozen, as a pretty blush spread up his pale chest.
“Right,” Draco said, his eyes focused on the wall just above Harry’s left shoulder. “Back to normal.”
Harry knew he was being given a test. He could leave and pretend this had never happened, or he could lean forward and press his lips to Malfoy’s. When it came down to it, was it even a choice at all?
“How did it happen? When did it happen? How is it? How big is it?” It was Harry’s turn to sputter then, and she grinned filthily.
At around ten-thirty, Harry was on his third glass of Firewhisky and second bowl of pudding when he heard a familiar voice and looked up to see the smiling face of Benjy Williams making his way across the living room towards him. He pulled Harry up and into a strong, firm hug.
They lay like that for a while, not sleeping but not quite awake yet, until Harry exhaled gently into Draco’s neck.
Harry swallowed, baring his teeth at her in a smile that was more grimace than anything else. “Yeah, tonight.”
But he never got a chance to finish because Malfoy’s eyes had darted to the left and he had turned as if to fly that way. Harry shouldn’t have fallen for it, it was such a basic error, but he was too angry to think straight so without his control he swung around to the left expecting to see the little gold ball. But it wasn’t there. He swung back to Malfoy and as he did Malfoy did something strange. His head and body were still turning towards the left but his broom shot to the right and before Harry could register what was going on Malfoy’s hand was closing over the Snitch.
He was overwhelmed by the clean scent of his skin, so different from any woman he’d ever been this close to. Malfoy’s clean, slightly damp hair smelled of citrus, wood, and something expensive that Harry couldn’t identify. Some loose strands brushed against Harry’s cheek and the cold of it on his heated skin made him feel feverish.
“What? No, of course not!” Harry felt his face getting hot. “It’s just that I’ve never… Well, you know…”
Norway were one of the weaker teams on the table and England beat them without much fuss. It felt good to be back on the pitch and Harry began to get a little excited about the competition.
“Well,” Harry swallowed nervously, feeling the anxiety starting to seep back. “I guess I’m not straight then.”
The restaurant was one of the nicer ones they’d visited on their trip. Apparently to Muggles it looked like an office building, but once you got into the elevator and tapped your wand against the button for floor two, you arrived in a restaurant that was half indoor half outdoor. Long wooden tables took up most of the room, with candles hovering above them, and a spread of food far fancier than Harry was accustomed to.
“Let me get this straight,” Ginny said calmly. Too calmly. “You have been sleeping together and calling each other when you’re in separate countries for nearly a year. You aren’t sleeping with anyone else. You went to Scotland for a week to nurse him back to health when he was injured.”
Harry flushed. “I really am sorry about that, but you have to admit that you were trying to get me to do it.”
Harry fell back onto his pillows, hoping the room was dark enough to hide his embarrassment. “Yeah, well. It’s not like that, okay?”
Draco continued as if he hadn’t spoken. “She was the black sheep of the family, but she was my great grandfather's favourite because they shared a total obsession with Quidditch, which is why he gave her this place and basically left her to it.”
Together they all headed towards the main sitting room, Draco still carrying Rose in his arms even though she was getting a little too big to do so comfortably.
Harry glanced back at Draco, who rolled his eyes. “For Merlin’s sake, sit down. You’re making me nervous.”
Harry took another step forward, intending to be threatening, and found himself very annoyingly looking up at Malfoy, and far too close to him. It was too late to step back now - that would be admitting defeat. “What would you know about sportsmanship?”
“Firstly I’d like to thank the team, the management, the trainers, and the coaches, particularly our head coach Ron Weasley. We would not have made it here without every one of you. To our Captain Davies: thank you for being the leader this team deserved and never wavering in your conviction that we would win.
After that, it was Oliver Wood, Roger Davies and Maxine O'Flaherty in quick succession. Next were Benjy Wiliams and his six-year-old daughter Zoe who, much to Draco’s amusement, was so in love with Harry that she could do nothing but stare up at him.
It wasn’t as nice as the one that Harry was usually put in, he noted, and then forgot every single thought he’d ever had when he saw Malfoy leaning against the counter, shirtless.
They were so close, neck and neck, shoulders pressed together as they jostled. Harry could practically feel the feathers brushing his fingertips, when Malfoy did something strange.
Harry stared at the number for a long moment before stuffing it into his pocket. He wasn’t going to use it - he certainly wasn’t going to buy a mobile phone just so he could call Draco Malfoy - but he couldn’t quite bring himself to throw it away either.
He spent the rest of breakfast trying to think of ways to get it back, and settled finally on sending Malfoy a note during afternoon Potions.
“Of course,” Harry patted his shoulder again and headed towards the stairs, relieved to have a purpose.
The pre-World Cup qualifying games were always a good time, though, even if they required a decent amount of international travel, and the English team was coming together beautifully; they beat Wales, Germany and Italy in quick succession.
Harry had been sitting next to her, clutching the letter emblazoned with the Aurors department logo in one clammy hand and one from Puddlemere United in the other, looking out at the rest of his life laying itself out in front of him.
At first glance he thought that he was looking at a gallery of landscapes but when he looked again he realised that they were all Quidditch scenes. He stepped closer to inspect the first one and was thrilled to see the Hogwarts Quidditch pitch and the tiny players zipping around in the old-school Ravenclaw and Gryffindor Quidditch uniforms.
Harry wondered if he should be more embarrassed. He didn’t even know if Draco would be awake, let alone interested in seeing him, but he was tipsy and he wanted to see him.
The Christmas Quidditch was always popular amongst the fans, and deeply unpopular amongst the players. Usually, they alternated years so as to allow them to spend at least every second one with their families. However, there were a few players who did it every year. For the past two years, Harry had become one of them. He knew that he was letting Mrs Weasley down and disappointing his friends, but it had just been too hard to be around Ginny. By playing in the Christmas match, he was able to miss most of dinner and just pop in for half an hour to have dessert. This had worked perfectly for the past two years, and so, despite his new tentative friendship with Ginny, he was signed up to play again.
“Draco,” she trilled in a thick accent, holding his face in her hands and covering it in kisses. “It’s been too long.”
Before Harry could react or say anything at all, Draco's expression shifted back into character to one of anger and frustration, and he got to his feet and stalked away, leaving Harry on his back in the mud feeling like he’d been winded.
Harry was shaking his head before she finished talking. “Don’t think like that, Gin. We just weren’t right together. I know I wasn’t easy to be with, and it wasn’t your responsibility to fix me.”
Harry was still stroking Draco’s cheek when he noticed his eyelids begin to flutter, and was embarrassed to find himself snatching his hand away. Draco made a little sleepy noise and squeezed his eyes tightly shut for a second, before opening them slowly.
Those photographs swam around his head alongside the new image of the dark-haired man leaning into Malfoy’s personal space. They became a confusing tangle, and Harry decided to head back to the hotel as he was feeling a bit nauseous. It must have been that last drink, he rationalised. It was quite strong, after all.
“There are some unbelievably illegal books in here,” Draco said gleefully over his shoulder, reaching up to pluck out a small leather-bound volume.
“Thank you… Oh, Harry!” She beamed as they placed the pan down carefully. Once it was safely deposited, she dusted her hands on her apron and squeezed Harry tightly. “My dear, you made it. You played terrifically! We’re all very proud of you.”
In the changing rooms afterwards the team patted him on the back, but they were subdued. Harry caught Malfoy’s eye across the room and was shocked to see the little nod of acknowledgement he gave.
Harry turned his head to see Malfoy lying on his bed with his pants still on but his shirt completely unbuttoned, staring at the ceiling. His brain raced. Did that mean…? Was he saying…?
“...and you know, they have no pupils at all. Also…” Harry blinked, trying to reorient himself. She gave him a funny look. “Are you alright?”
He was even more furious when he realised that the antics had given the Snitch time to vanish again.
He managed to get about half an hour more sleep before he dragged himself out of bed. Malfoy was doing something fussy in the corner which he ignored, just went into the bathroom and took a piss. He didn’t bother looking in the mirror, he knew what he would look like, then pulled on a sweater and some trackies.
Harry had been unsure when Hermione had told him that they’d be getting married in the woods, a little worried that it would remind him of that awful year. When he saw the site, however, with the copious amounts of flowers piled high to create the altar, it couldn't have looked less like their makeshift campsites.
“Alright,” Malfoy started, standing next to Harry so he could follow him exactly. “Usually you would be flying at quite high speed doing this, but we’ll start stationary.”
After exchanging some more hellos and thank yous, the two women left for their offices on the other side of the house to argue about arrangements for the press. Before Harry and Draco could even breathe a sigh of relief, the Floo went again.
It took about an hour and another cup of tea for him to get the hang of using the tiny keyboard, and another cup to wrap his head around the snake game, which Ginny assured him was integral to the experience.
They shared one more bruising kiss before Malfoy grabbed Harry’s hand and pushed him through the crowd towards the back exit. They burst through it into the mild night. Malfoy began to walk in the direction of their hotel but Harry was still holding his hand and used it to drag him back and into his arms.
“I did. Lots of them, but I drove most of them away.” He shrugged and then his brow furrowed and he looked at Harry with concern. “Did you have a nanny who took care of you when you had a cold?”
Harry ducked out of the tent. It was always nice to see Lee but he really wasn’t in the mood to chat about anything, particularly Draco Malfoy. Ever since he’d got back from Scotland about a month ago his patience had been at an all-time low; the slightest provocation and he flew right off the handle.
Harry snorted with laughter, and just like that the tension was broken. “Cheers, mate,” he chuckled. “I have to get him back first though.”
Draco looked at him blankly and then his face twisted into something that was possibly supposed to be a smile. “Ah, yes. I was just leaving.”
Draco paused and then took a small step forward and, with a hand on either side of his face, kissed Harry. He pushed Harry, still kissing him, back into the room and kicked the door shut behind him. “Is this okay?” He breathed and Harry made a noise that he hoped communicated full and complete permission.
Oh Merlin, he glanced up but couldn’t see her parents anywhere. “Alright yes, of course, I’ll teach you.”
“Because she’s observant.” Ginny held up Harry’s arm by the sleeve and inspected his cuff. “You really should be wearing some, you know.”
He stepped to one side and held the door open. Harry felt his feet carry him inside. There was something about Malfoy’s gaze that made Harry feel like he was under a heat lamp.
“Oh, yeah, I guess I haven’t.” He hoped it wasn’t obvious that he was stalling. “I’ve been busy with recovery and training, I’m focused on getting back into shape for the World Cup. But once that’s all over I’ll get back to it.”
Harry had the rest of the day off so he fled to Ron and Hermione’s house. Unfortunately for him, they were both home. Even more unfortunately, Ginny was with them. The three of them took one look at his face and forced him to sit down and tell them what was wrong.
Something about Draco’s blank tone rubbed the wrong way at the raw place in Harry’s chest so he continued. “Also, I thought, I know you were upset when Hermione and Ron found out, I thought it’d be a good idea if we cooled things off a bit during the World Cup too, then we can see where we are afterwards.” Harry felt the words he had forgotten about all week spilling out of him.
“Really?” Malfoy drawled, and the tone of it made the hairs on the back of Harry’s neck stand on end.
On the plus side, his normal post-booze shame was totally eclipsed by the panic that swelled in him when he remembered the way that he had left things with Malfoy. If he had been capable of it he would have buried his face in his pillow, but as it was he made do by squeezing his eyes shut.
She shuffled in a bit closer, her other hand coming up to touch his shoulder. “You know, we’re not technically teammates anymore…”
After he’d finished telling the whole sorry story, there was silence. Ginny, Ron and Hermione all looked at him with varying degrees of disappointment.
They dressed warmly and made their way down the stairs and out into the crisp day. There was still a hint of wetness in the air, and the ground smelled damp and fresh.
“I’m just in bed.” Harry wondered if he was supposed to be answering in a flirty way - whatever that meant.
“Well I was going to give you the camera back, but since you’ve decided to be rude I think I’ll hold onto it for a bit longer,” He smirked and turned to sit back down. Harry debated just hexing him and grabbing it but he could see McGonagall and Snape watching them closely.
“Rest,” she replied firmly. “And by that, I mean lying down and having your meals brought to you.” She turned to Draco. “You’ll need someone to keep an eye on you too, at least for the first week. Do you want me to call anyone for you?”
Ron laughed too. “If he heard that speech I’m sure he’ll be waiting in your hotel room when you get back.”
Ginny had been silent for a few moments, and when she had spoken again she sounded like she was choosing her words carefully. “Don’t become an Auror.”
Harry felt all the frustration and anger from the game well up again and he had to clench his fist to keep from hitting something. “Of course you have. Come to gloat, I expect?”
Harry worked his arm free from around Draco’s waist and pushed it between them, gripping Draco’s dick. It was an awkward angle because his face was still pressed against Draco’s neck, but the noises Draco was making made it worthwhile.
“Go away,” he called grumpily, but the knocking came again, more insistent this time. “Oh for fuck sake…” he grumbled, dragging himself out of bed to open the door.
“Uncle Draco,” the child in question cooed. She reached out grabby hands towards him, and he lifted her from Granger’s arms.
Draco yelped and pulled the blankets even closer around himself. He knew he was being childish but he wanted to stay in the perfect, safe warmth for a few more moments.
The quiet was eventually broken unceremoniously by Harry’s stomach rumbling. Draco snorted. “Time for breakfast, is it?”
“Merlin,” Harry breathed, but before he could say any more, Malfoy pulled him in and they were falling in a tangle of limbs onto the thick carpet.
A week after the Cannons game, Harry was waiting for his coffee to cool down to a drinkable temperature in the kitchen of the Puddlemere training facility. He was there a good hour before anyone else and so when the mail delivery came down the shoot he went to pick it up. As he was idly sorting through it he caught sight of the front page of the
“Erm… Well…” Harry shrugged. Was he freaking out? He thought he probably should be, but the bubbles and Malfoy’s arse had really taken the edge off it, if he was honest.
“I mean in a romantic way,” Ron added quickly. His ears were getting redder by the second but he seemed determined to power through. “Not for myself, obviously, but you’re my best mate and it feels weird that there’s a part of your life I don’t know anything about.”
“Oh, erm, no, I just hadn’t seen it before,” he mumbled, suddenly becoming deeply interested in the bookcase to his right.
He turned his head and body towards the left and she followed, but he wasn’t there. Instead, he’d gone to the right where the Snitch was fluttering about ten meters away. He had reached it and closed his hand around it before she had even realised what had happened.
Sleep was the worst casualty of the injury. He’d never been the greatest sleeper anyway, but since the World Cup he’d barely been able to lie down without his mind being swamped with bothersome thoughts. That was one of the reasons he was so grateful for Quidditch: it tired him out until he could safely fall into bed.
Harry stayed near the back, watching as his teammates got drinks and began to mingle with the French players. He was joined after a few minutes by Angelina and Cormac.
They were never going to make it out of the entryway, but Harry refused to come in his pants like a teenager, so he reached down and pulled Malfoy’s hand to the front of his pants, hoping that he’d get the hint. Luckily, Malfoy seemed to be very much on the same page because he made fast work of the button and zip. Harry pulled his jeans down with one hand, which was rather awkward but the best he could do without breaking the kiss. Something in him knew that if they stopped kissing again, he’d lose his nerve.
Once out of the shower, he tugged on a dark blue button-down and the nice jeans that Ginny had forced him to purchase a few years ago. A small part of him wanted to look nice, but he couldn’t admit even to himself why that was.
Malfoy didn’t reply but instead gave Harry’s stained, slightly misshapen bag a very judgemental look. “Please tell me that it’s bigger on the inside.”
Una led them through the front doors and into the entry hall. A moderately sized stone staircase curved up to the next floor, which Una ushered them up. Within a few minutes, Draco had been whisked away to bed and Harry found himself standing in a guest bedroom, his trunk resting at the foot of the bed. It was a generously sized room with thick stone walls and dark wood floor covered with a variety of rugs and furs. The decor was far less formal and grand than Harry would have expected from a Malfoy home. The generously sized bed even had a handmade quilt hanging over the end of it. He went over to stand in front of the huge fireplace, holding out his hands to warm them, and caught sight of the pictures on the mantelpiece.
“Only because you sent me a ‘you up’ text.” Malfoy sounded very much like he was smirking. “At one in the morning, I might add. It’s all very damning.”
If possible, the photoshoot was even worse. The photographer was a very tall wizard with long stringy brown hair and a very large camera, who forced Harry into a series of increasingly humiliating and uncomfortable poses. Luckily he didn’t seem interested in making Harry get his kit off, but it was small mercy to him when he found himself pretending to kick a Quaffle.
“Actually, I can.” Harry couldn’t quite bring himself to look at him, Pansy’s words buzzing annoyingly in his head. He cast them aside as best he could. “I just won the League Cup, remember? I’ve got two weeks off. Plus I’ve been through this recovery before. I know how much help you need.”
“Thank you for agreeing to be part of this, Angelina,” Draco said primly. “Unlike your betrothed, you are a true gem.”
Harry had never been in a feud before but he had to admit it made life much more interesting, and also significantly more stressful. He found himself obsessing over Malfoy’s games, even going so far as to use polyjuice to sneak into a Magpies v Harpies game, which didn’t make him feel better.
“It wasn’t your fault,” Harry said, furrowing his brow. This was not the conversation he had expected.
During the press conference following the match, Harry was still smarting from the loss and his argument with Malfoy. He ripped little pieces off the parchment in front of him and thrummed with nervous energy, leg bouncing under the table as the reporters hurled question after question.
“Weird.” He directed Harry towards a table in the middle of the store covered in an overwhelming array of phones. “You’ll want something basic, then. Do you need a camera?”
What the actual fuck just happened? One minute they’d been yelling at each other like normal, and then the next… Harry hit his head against the tiles a few times for good measure.
“Nah, don’t worry! It’s way more common than you would think,” she said as she motioned for him to follow her into another room where most of the rest of the team were milling about.
Parvati had been Harry’s agent for about a year and a half, taking over from her mother Priya just after the World Cup debacle. He tried not to dwell on why he had been palmed off to the younger Patil because it turned out she was actually a brilliant agent, despite her inexperience, and significantly less scary than her mother.
Draco gave him a stiff little smile and then turned without another word and swept out of the bathroom.
Draco awoke with a start. He’d been falling and falling and just as he was a breath from the ground he’d found himself in bed.
“Because,” Malfoy said smugly, poking Harry’s shoulder. “Unless you’re planning on extending your Australasian vacation you probably want to make the Portkey which leaves in half an hour.”
“Did you watch?” Malfoy bobbed up beside him again, looking a bit breathless but pleased with himself.
“For fuck sake,” Malfoy said under his breath but Harry wasn’t listening. He let himself be guided to the bathroom and sunk down onto the floor next to the toilet with relief.
Quite polite, Harry thought, considering how much he would have preferred to hex him. A few moments later the reply came on a new scrap of paper.
“Well, I am actually Scottish through my grandmother on my father’s side. Her sister - my great aunt - is the one who left Lochinvar Castle to me. She died about a year ago, without an heir, so she left it to me.”
“Draco Malfoy, come here you gorgeous bastard.” George shook their hands enthusiastically before slinging a long arm around Draco’s shoulders. “You know, Harry, you’d better get a ring on this man’s finger toot sweet. It isn’t safe to let someone so good-looking wander around unattached. Why do you think I locked Angie down as soon as possible?”
It was the sounds Harry would remember later with embarrassing clarity as he lay alone in bed. The sound of Draco’s breathing, the little gasps and sobs that Harry couldn’t quite believe he was responsible for. There were other things too: the softness of his skin contrasted with the hardness of the muscles and bones beneath, his woody, expensive scent, the way his chest and neck shone with sweat. But most of all, it was the sounds he made as Harry opened him up. He was - as always - in control of the situation, talking Harry through kindly but impatiently, and every now and then his voice would shudder and Harry felt it all the way to his toes. He thought he could come from that alone, just from watching him.
The colours made him look a little like he had at the victory dinner in Auckland, relaxed and smart, and it made Harry feel slightly light-headed.
He was surprised to see the corner of Malfoy’s mouth twitch. “I have it sent from a boutique in Paris, if you must know.”
“I just need to focus on getting the Cup, then afterwards things can go back to normal.” Harry could feel himself starting to babble slightly so he shut his mouth.
“You can apologise to me.” His face was impassive but Harry didn’t think he was imagining the quirk of his mouth.
“I just needed to take a moment. Thanks for the bubbles.” Draco leaned back into Harry, turning his head to press his lips the soft skin under Harry’s ear.
“Potter, I swear…  If you don’t move, I’m going to die, or kill you, or both,” he complained, and Harry didn’t need to be told twice, pushing into him.
“I’d rather not talk about that, thanks.” He was fighting desperately to keep his voice calm and even.
Malfoy snorted. “Merlin, no. Cami’s a friend but she’s not really my type. Keeping tabs on me, are you?”
“Yes, my great-aunt was somewhat of an inventor. She had a particular passion for adapting Muggle technology for magical use.” Draco flicked his wand and the doors flew open. “You can see why my father disliked her so much.”
She flicked a lock of her short black hair over her shoulder and indicated for him to follow her back down the corridor. When they reached a small, empty office, Pansy directed him into it and he went without argument.
2005 melted into 2006 without much fanfare. Harry spent most of January and February training and playing, but when March rolled around he suddenly found himself being trotted out for all the pre-World Cup events that he had enjoyed so much the last time around. This time, they felt like a chore. Worse than a chore, actually - he felt actively anxious and overwhelmed by the entire affair.
“That is not… Am not sorry to win. But you were hurt.” He was rolling his glass between his big hands.
“You looked like you were having a nice time out there.” Harry wished he could just stop but it wasn’t happening.
Ginny Weasley and Luna Lovegood arrived a few minutes late — apparently Lovegood had got it into her head that they needed to bring some special kind of bulb, which had been a nightmare to harvest. Harry accepted the bag that she handed him with a look of extreme trepidation as it seemed to be trying to run away.
“What are you doing?” Malfoy said quietly, and Harry realised belatedly that he was reaching out to stroke Malfoy’s cheek.
They continued to clutch onto each other, holding their breaths, until they heard the door to the hallway click shut. The sound seemed to shake them both out of the trance they were in and Malfoy let go of Harry roughly, clambering down from the seat and almost going face-first onto the tiles in his haste. He hovered after unlocking the cubicle door, turning slightly to catch Harry’s gaze. Harry was sure that he looked like a startled pigeon, as he stood frozen in the spot Malfoy had left him, eyes and mouth gaping. Malfoy swallowed nervously and Harry realised that his hand was shaking again as he gripped into the open door.
“O'Flaherty, Coote - leave McLaggen alone. I know he’s annoying, but we’re up against the Harpies next month and apparently Weasley’s been playing bloody well so we don’t have time to have fun,” Davies called, turning back to finish the conversation he’d been having.
Draco smirked. Harry might be the saviour of the wizarding world but Draco was the only person in the world who could make him blush like that. He squeezed Harry tightly, relishing the solid weight of him. He loved him so much that he sometimes wanted to squeeze him until he burst.
“Look, I’m not going to push this. I know you get enough of it from Hermione and Ron. But are you letting yourself have fun?” She looked earnest and worried and it made Harry’s stomach ache.
He had no excuse to be miserable really, considering that only a few hours earlier they had beaten the Tāmaki Tuis and won the Cup. Well, Harry thought uncharitably, the team had beaten the Tuis. Harry had had very little to do with it. He had been stuck on the bench, watching Malfoy give the performance of a lifetime. It was a particularly cruel kind of torture, being forced to watch someone do your job so much better than you - not to mention the confusing twist he felt in his stomach watching Malfoy play with his trademark savage gracefulness. When he raised his arm, Snitch glittering in his fist, and was mobbed by the team, Harry watched from the sidelines. He couldn’t work out if the rolling in his stomach was jealousy or something worse.
Harry had seen tapes of him playing in France - he wanted to be prepared, after all - so he knew that Malfoy was a skilled player. According to their stats, Harry was a tiny bit faster and stronger than Malfoy, but nothing could have prepared Harry for the agility and viciousness of his playing style. He was a falcon with all of the stereotypes that came along with that, and it immediately pissed Harry off. He didn’t understand why players like Malfoy couldn’t just get on with playing the game, why they wasted so much time showing off for the crowd and talking absolute bollocks to teammates and opposition alike.
He grasped the phone in his hand all the way home as if his life depended on it - he certainly did not want to have spent that much money only to get mugged five minutes later. Once safely home, he placed it on the table, staring at it warily. He flipped it open, then closed, then open again.
“I just don’t like going out. It’s exhausting.” His annoyance was subsiding slightly, leaving him feeling wrung out.
He stormed over and shoved Malfoy with all his might, and Malfoy shoved him back. It wasn’t a real fight, but it was enough to cause the heads of the people around them to swing in their direction.
He missed getting snarky little texts from him after he won or lost a game, he missed the sound of Draco’s voice at the other end of the phone, he even missed his (usually unsolicited) advice and criticism on Harry’s playing. The worst part was that Harry had a horrible feeling that he’d created this situation for himself. He had been the one who’d suggested they take a break. He was the one who had prioritised his job over their relationship.
A shield snapped up instinctively as Harry watched the shards. He was at once thankful that Scorpius was in his room, even as he wondered how the child had reacted to the sudden burst of magical energies. Perhaps they should've done this outside...
His heart thundered in his chest, "I think we might be able to." He gave a soft laugh, "but he still needs a bath. And well.." he pressed a small kiss to the corner of Harry's mouth, intertwining their fingers. "You've seen how that works."
Harry smiled, sweeping Scorpius up and settling him in the tub. "So your daddy didn't tell you that you've got a visitor coming over?"
Draco's hair was wet at the tips, his simple black shirt rolled up at the elbows. He was dressed in a pair of plain black sweats, his shirt soaked against his skin revealing lean muscles and broad shoulders. "Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy," he chided, a small smile on his face as he brushed some hair from his face, the locks choosing to just fall back in the way of his mercury grey eyes.
Harry's eyes narrowed a fraction as he wondered just what was going on in the blonde's mind. "Right," he said quietly and then flicked his attention back to the boy. "Ready to get out of here?"
Harry watched him go. "What about removing his magic?" he whispered. "Or repressing it like they did with Draco?"
"Yes, apple pancakes." The auror laughed, cuddling the boy close and lightly tickling his ribs. "Are you awake yet?"
Scorpius blushed, giving a quick nod of his head before making grabby hands at Harry with a small "fork please!"
Scorpius gave a quick nod, his mouth forming a small 'o' before he gave a little giggle and poked Harry's knee. "You're it!" He turned, rushing away towards the kitchen and the smell of apples, his arms held out in front of him as to protect himself.
With a laugh, Harry pulled on his shirt. His name still carried a lot of weight when he needed it to, particularly since he so rarely used it. He grinned at Draco. "I know how things work there. I work there," he reminded him. "I'll be back as soon as I can."
Draco reached down, hand shaking as he wrapped it around Potter's leaking prick, jerking him roughly, hands slicked with sweat as he lapped and nipped at his neck, breathing beginning to come harshly as he felt himself rapidly coming closer to the edge.
Harry was just zipping up the blue, snitch-dotted onesie when he caught sight of Draco in the doorway. He grinned, getting to his feet and bringing Scorpius with him. He didn't ask what the cup was full of, making a note to ask later. "I'll let you take it from here, Draco. I'll floo-call Hermione and let her know she can come by now."
Draco swallowed almost audibly, his eyes falling shut. "No..." he ran a hand through his hair, his locks becoming disheveled, falling in to his eyes. "They just know that his magic... his magic is not taking to him." He waved a hand as if the motion would suddenly explain everything to the brunette across the table. A sigh fell from his lips as his hand fell to the table. "They think he might be a squib. A squib with some magic that is refusing to take." Malfoy's gaze told the brunette that he refused to believe that.
"You don't owe me anything, Draco. All I want is for that happy little kid to stay that way." His smile was soft. "And for his gorgeous father to be able to be who he is without the damn Ministry getting in the way."
The question was nearly lost on Harry, who was busily drinking in the sight of shirtless Draco Malfoy. He cleared his throat, a hint of pink touching his cheeks when he realized it and he grinned down at Scorpius. "Of course you can help."
Harry ran a hand through his hair, looking from Draco to his son. His body was still very much on overdrive and his mind was still struggling to click things together. "Ah... I'll let you take this," he murmured, smiling ruefully.
The little boy giggled, grabbing Harry's hand and using it to poke the ducky who scooted across the tub, bubbles from the soap parting to make way. "Thank you!" He gave Harry a missing-tooth grin, squealing happily as he saw something behind Harry's shoulder. "Daddy!"
"I know, 'addy!" The little boy giggled, small fingers already reaching for an apple slice, taking it and biting in to it with an excited crunch.
“It’s true.” For some reason, Harry felt it was very important that Malfoy believed him. “You come off really snobby and rude but actually you’re quite thoughtful.” Malfoy stared at him, so Harry continued. “Well, maybe not thoughtful but you think about things, like, deeply or whatever.”
Everyone had gone to bed or out to dinner, so Harry and Draco went back to the field they had been training in just outside the city. The fading light cast long shadows around them.
From the looks of it, Malfoy had brought with him half the contents of Malfoy Manor. Harry had to assume he’d magically extended his suitcase because it just kept coming and coming: piles of books, toiletries, sheets, pillows, and clothes - so many clothes. Item after item he pulled out and refolded, smoothing each piece delicately. Harry watched as he pulled out a set of dove grey formal robes and hung them in the wardrobe carefully. They were nicer than pretty much anything Harry had ever owned - not that he would tell Malfoy that.
He had to admit though that he had never really considered how difficult it must have been for Malfoy to come back to Britain. He had of course seen the headlines, but Harry had been far too busy being annoyed to consider that it might have been difficult for him within the team. Harry hoped that Angelina was wrong about him having a hard time with the Magpies but he wasn’t naive. He knew what Quidditch players could be like.
Why was he telling him this? “That I’ll focus on Quidditch, and not let relationship stuff distract me until after the World Cup.”
Harry rubbed his hand over his eyes, trying to push out the mental image of Draco, in bed with a faceless Belgium, that had popped into his head. He wasn’t jealous of course, but something about the image bothered him, like an itch in the back of his brain. He just wanted to find out if he was right.
“Ooh, touchy,” Malfoy smirked as he took his hands off the broom, holding them up in mock surrender. “I hope I haven’t said anything to upset you. Surely the golden boy doesn’t get ruffled over a few silly comments in the paper.”
Draco was still laughing but he swam over and wrapped his arms around Harry’s shivering body under the water. To be honest it really didn’t do much to raise Harry’s body temperature but it was such a sweet gesture that Harry allowed himself to be held in the water for much longer than he should have.
Harry was slightly taken aback by the seriousness of the question. He did feel protective of Draco - he would do anything to protect him - but he knew that wasn’t exactly what Ron was asking. “I’m in love with him, if that’s what you mean,” Harry replied, and then swallowed. There it was.
“Harry!” He turned to see Dean grinning at him, Seamus by his side. “Ginny said you might be coming. It’s really good to see you, mate.” Harry let himself be dragged into a tight hug, and then another with Seamus.
Benjy threw his head back and laughed. “Calm down, Harry, you look as if I’m going to give you a bollocking.”
Malfoy didn’t turn around or reply, so Harry stepped out onto the balcony and leaned on the railing beside him. The night stretched out before them, the lights tracing the shape of the hills that wrapped around the city like fairy-light covered arms. On the other side the ocean was just inky blackness, as though someone had forgotten to colour that part in. Harry felt lightheaded.
Harry huffed in annoyance. “Because it was rude of him, and I was sick of putting up with him anyway.”
“Erm, yes?” Harry replied, his mouth filling with the familiar, metallic taste of panic. He tensed himself for some kind of abuse, verbal or physical.
Ginny sighed and ran a hand through her hair. “I just want you to know that even if we're not together, you’re still part of the family.” Harry felt the knot in his stomach tighten. “I know you’ve been avoiding Christmases and things, but you need people. You can’t get through life without your family.”
“If anyone has any questions about the actual Quidditch School, now would be the time to jump in,” he said, once he’d calmed down a bit, trying to avoid looking at Harry, whose shoulders were still shaking a little, for fear that it would set him off again.
“What is Master Potter doing in here?” Kreacher had appeared at the door, looking in suspiciously, as if he expected to find Harry up to no good.
Apparently it didn’t because Draco pulled away and looked at him, still holding his face in his hands. “I saw your speech.”
“He’s not really company, though, is he? Sorry, you know what I mean, Hermione,” Ron withered under her unimpressed gaze.
Harry was shaken out of his reverie by Ginny sliding into the booth next to him and smacking him on the shoulder.
“Yeah, I suppose not. Surely a trip to Australia can’t be too bad anyway? Even if the ferret is tagging along. Plus it might be good for you to...” He grimaced. “Well, to get away from everything.”
The rest of the competition went by in a blur but neither Puddlemere or the Magpies made it to the final so Harry didn’t get a chance to see Draco again before he went home.
“I’d rather be an honorary Muggle than a slimy little git,” Harry was quite proud of himself for that one. “And I know how duels work, more or less.”
She glanced down at her notes. “It’s been over a year since your last official interview. What’s been keeping you away? Are you afraid of criticism?”
“Yeah,” Harry sighed, dropping his head back onto Draco’s chest. “I just can’t believe that Krum was right.”
He found a rather emotional Hermione on the second floor, in Charlie's old room, having her makeup fussed with by Ginny, Padma and Mrs Granger.
Harry didn’t see himself as an angry person (though he knew a few people who would probably disagree with him on that) but he knew the way that anger and passion coexisted. He was intimately familiar with the look that Ginny used to give him when they were yelling at each other, like she didn’t know whether she wanted to hex him or fuck him. But what did it mean when a man gave you that look? What did it mean when Malfoy looked like that?
Harry choked on his beer, and coughed for a few moments before he was able to speak again. “Who? Malfoy?”
Malfoy snorted. “It’s alright, Potter. I’m sure Applebee would give you a go if you asked her nicely.”
He made his way shakily over to the bar and poured himself a large Firewhisky. Just as he was taking a swig Ginny appeared in front of him with her hands on her hips.
“No, but it’s probably a good idea. It’s easier this way, cleaner. Before either of us meets someone else or gets attached.” Draco looked completely calm but there was that muscle in his jaw that twitched, giving him away.
“I disappear? You practically threw me into the fireplace when Weasley and Granger walked in on us.” Draco gestured between them, a little wildly.
Draco felt Harry go stiff next to him but he just smiled at the reporter who had asked the question. “I think you’ll find that that is alleged former Death Eater, Ms Anderson.” There was a light sprinkling of laughter around the courtyard, “But to answer your question: if the public does not trust me to look after their children then they are in luck because Mr Potter here will be doing most of the looking after. I’m more the business end of the operation.” He paused for effect. “No pun intended.”
Harry jumped slightly, Malfoy’s voice tearing him from his fantasies. He blushed. “I…” He stammered. “I wasn’t ogling… I was admiring your technique.”
England won against Bulgaria. It happened so quickly that Harry almost couldn’t believe it. They were in the final again and Bulgaria wasn’t. Not to mention the fact that it was looking as though Scotland would be in the final as well. Harry was in a daze.
“And at no point in the past year did it occur to you that you might have feelings for one another?”
“No, no! I was hoping… I didn’t know.” They stood there for a few seconds, just grinning at each other like idiots.
“Firstly, I’d like to thank you all for taking the time to join us here today for the ribbon-cutting and relaunch party for Lochinvar Quidditch Academy.” A cheer went up from the group. “We will have many more guests joining us in a few hours, but we first wanted to celebrate with the people who have really made this all possible for us. Thank you to each and every one of you for your support, and we look forward to showing you what we have achieved.”
“Great,” He sneered. But just then Harry saw Snape advancing on them out of the corner of his eye and decided he’d better leg it back to the Gryffindor table before he lost any more points for his house. He gave Colin another apologetic pat on the shoulder, which made the small boy blush furiously and forget about his misery for a few moments. Harry did feel bad really, even though Colin was beyond annoying, he was just a kid, and Malfoy really was being a prize twat.
Taking one glance over his shoulder, he pulled the cloak tighter around his shoulders and pushed the door open slightly, peering inside. The tiled hallway which led to the bathroom was empty so Harry slipped through the door, pulling it closed behind him with a soft
“I’m going to go get food,” he called over his shoulder as he made his way out the door, not waiting for a response from his roommate, and headed downstairs towards the promise of breakfast.
Those words had stuck in him like a thorn, spurring him to take Puddlemere’s offer, public opinion be damned. As he looked out over the dark garden and the remnants of Ron and Hermione’s wedding in the moonlight he wondered how he could have forgotten them so easily.
“If you say so,” Harry said with a laugh, but he was already pulling away from Draco and slipping out of bed, letting a burst of cold air into the cocoon.
It was just because he hadn’t had sex in a long time - that had to be it. The last person he’d been with was after a date that Wood had set him up on, a few months after the breakup. He’d been too emotionally raw and she had been in awe of him, which was not, as it turned out, a winning combo for sex. So, he hadn’t had fulfilling sex in almost a year and a half. That had to be a contributing factor, didn’t it?
Harry felt euphoric. The club was filled to bursting but the crowd seemed to move out of the way for Malfoy. The lights changed his white-blond hair to pink, purple, red, green. His white shirt was unbuttoned enough to expose his sternum dusted in glitter, the rest of the shirt sticking to the sweat on his stomach and back. Malfoy pushed through the crowd until they reached a back corner where the shadows would prevent any of their teammates who were scattered throughout the club from seeing them, and dragged Harry into a rough kiss.
Harry watched as Malfoy mounted his broom but remained on the ground, placing both of his hands on the broom facing the same way. Harry tried to mirror it.
“Oh.” Harry’s mouth suddenly felt very, very dry. He wasn’t sure he could blame it all on the hangover. “So you and…”
“Yes! Well, no… I mean yes,” Harry stammered. “You just can’t go around saying things like that, fucking with people.”
At first, Malfoy was completely still, and Harry thought for one horrible second that he had made an enormous mistake. Finally, he made a noise that had Harry’s stomach flipping over. Malfoy pressed into him, a hand coming up to wind into Harry’s hair. It wasn’t like any kiss that Harry had ever had. It was an explosion, the release of a pressure that had been building up for far longer than he had ever realised. His hands were all over Malfoy, in his hair, on his neck, gripping onto his back.
Draco seemed to relax a bit but he didn’t let go of Harry’s arm. “I hate being by myself when I’m sick. I used to make my nanny sleep in my room whenever I got a cold.”
Grinny was grinning too. “Now for the real reason we came here.” She took Hermione’s hands in her own and affected a concerned look. “Are you absolutely certain you want to do this? My disgusting brother hasn’t tricked you into this in some way?”
It couldn’t have lasted more than 10 seconds but Harry felt as though the world had shifted on its axis when he opened his eyes again. Everything was brighter, almost painfully saturated, as they pulled apart. It was as if every drop of blood in his body had rushed directly to his brain. Over the rushing sound in his ears, he heard Filch’s mutterings moving even further away down the corridor. His eyes met Malfoy’s again and they exchanged a look which sent thrills all the way down to his fingertips and toes.
It wasn’t until he was halfway down the corridor that he realised that the feeling making his heart pound wasn’t anger.
So Malfoy had kissed him. Or had he kissed Malfoy? Harry’s brow furrowed as he tried to remember, it was just so fuzzy. He could definitely remember the other boy leaning forward, but he was almost certain he’d leant forward too. How inconvenient, it made the already confusing situation even more so because Harry couldn’t figure out whether he should feel embarrassed and worried or not. Regardless, he knew he wouldn’t tell anyone; for starters, it would just be too hard to explain to Ron or any of the other boys, and Hermione would probably just be mad at him for sneaking out in the first place.
“Oi, Harry! Over here!” Angelina’s voice shook him out of his thoughts and he looked up to see her head poking out from behind an enormous pot of yellow flowers.
“Your ears are all red, you absolute liar,” she laughed, pouring them both a cup of tea and sitting down across from him. “Spill, right now. Who is she?”
“My great-aunt.” Draco stopped and looked out over the pitch. “Before the first war she ran a summer Quidditch school here. She always wanted to reopen it but she got busy with her other projects and then she got sick.” He paused and shivered slightly. Harry had the strongest urge to reach out and hold his hand but he didn’t want to interrupt the story. “I think she hoped that by leaving me this place I would one day reopen it. She always was a barmy old cow.”
Sydney in October was stifling - a dry oppressive heat that seeped into Harry’s bones and made him ache for foggy British mornings. He regretted agreeing to the tour from the moment he grasped the Portkey.
Krum nodded and turned to follow him, as he was passing he leant forward and murmured in Harry’s ear: “Like I say, junior Quidditch trophy.”
“But you’re so much fun to wind up,” Malfoy’s voice was too low for the audience to hear and it made the hair on the back of Harry’s neck stand up. “Besides, it’s not as though you’ve been shy about sharing your opinions either. Lovely picture of you in the
They lay next to each other for a long time afterwards, catching their breath. Harry wasn’t sure if it was the wedding or the sex but something felt different, more settled, in his chest. The sex had been pretty great, to be fair. It was always great with Draco, but they’d never done it like that, and Harry was struggling to process his feelings about it. It wasn’t better or worse than the sex he’d had with women, but it felt different somehow - more intense. Like he hadn’t been certain where he ended and Draco began.
Harry considered this. It definitely had an element of truth to it, he had to admit. “So I could have had loads of crushes on blokes without knowing about it?”
“Both,” he replied finally. “I shouldn’t have made such a big deal out of it, but you shouldn’t have said what you said either.”
“It’s just…” Harry paused, trying to think of what to say. “On trips like this I always used to spend the evenings talking to Ginny, so now I’m just used to turning in early instead.”
Harry realised what he’d said and ducked his head in embarrassment. “No, I mean… Harry… You can call me Harry,” he choked out.
The ceremony took place in a small clearing of trees about half a mile from the Burrow. The guests sat on wooden pews that Arthur and Mr Granger had spent months building and bonding over. They weren’t the most structurally sound but both men were so proud of them that no one had the heart to criticise them.
Harry took a hold of Draco's hand, leading him out and down the hall. He couldn't imagine what it must be like, having magic only to have it yanked away and suppressed. He sank down onto the couch and retrieved the wand from his sleeve before cautiously offering it.
Harry ran after him, catching him just at the doorway to the kitchen. Grinning, he scooped the child up and caught him up in a hug. "Gotcha!"
The little blonde boy nodded and giggled. "Yes! Harry made me and Perry pancakes!" At the word pancakes Scorpius picked Perry up and flew him around, giggling as he himself landed on his father's back, Perry clutched tightly in his arms.
"B-B-Bathroom." His eyes were wide and watering, tears dripping down against his cheeks as his little bottom lip quivered. Perry was nowhere in sight.
The blonde let out a haughty laugh, pushing away from the counter and grabbing Harry by the shoulder, he pulled him close and pressed their lips together in a chaste kiss. "Can't wait. But for now we have a five year old to bathe before he gets suspicious about where his daddy disappeared to." Giving Harry's shoulder a small shove, he walked around him and cancelled the charms Harry had placed with a small, giddy flick of his wand.
"Who said I wanted you out of gratitude?" His whispered words were washing over Harry's lips, the simplest brushes of air as he stepped closer, their hips barely brushing.
Draco gave a small hiss, a small cringe as he gently touched his lip. "T-Thanks, Po- Harry." He grabbed a towel, dabbing away the blood before smiling in to the mirror. No blood? He turned his head side to side and grinned again, checking his teeth for any signs of the red liquid as well. No.
Smiling, Harry got to his feet and zipped up his jeans. "Want to clean us up with your shiny little wand?" he teased.
Harry blew out a breath, tucking his wand back up his sleeve. That hadn't been the outcry of an abused or neglected child; he'd been legitimately happy to see his father. "A couple of boys pushed him. You saw it happen?"
He gave a small chuckle, nipping at Harry's thumb gently. "No, I don't want you. Get out right now, you blubbering buffoon." His expression was serious, a few pregnant seconds passing before he broke out in peals of laughter, clutching at his stomach as he leaned against Harry's shoulder. "O-Of course I'd love to have you, Harry." He smiled warmly after a few moments of laughter, leaning forward to kiss him softly. "If you'll have me that is."
A few seconds later, Scorpius came running in to the living room, his towel clutched to the front of his body, his naked bum in the air as he ran around giggling. "But daddy! I don' wanna bath!" The little blonde boy raced around the couch, giggling and hiding before giving a shrill cry of "Harry!" and running up to him, clinging to his leg and hiding behind him, giggling quietly as his dad came rushing in to the living room.
Laughing, Harry followed, pausing at the door of Draco's bedroom. He nudged it open quietly, just to check on the other man and make sure he was still sleeping.
"Okay, daddy!" Scorpius's grin was wide on his face, his pale complexion warm with a small flush of exertion. "Apples?" the little blonde smiled up at him as if the world didn't cast him away, as if he had no worries.
Scorpius nodded, hair flicking in to his face as he held his arms up, making grabby hands for the brunette wizard. "Up! Up!" Draco chuckled, patting Harry's shoulder, once again ignoring the odd feeling that crept through his arm as he walked into the kitchen to get Scorpius his vitamins for the night. The elder Malfoy made sure that his son was up to date on all vitamins, hoping that it would help his son in some way. If you were to tell Draco Malfoy ten years ago that he would have a son who would need to be put on Muggle vitamins for fear he might die, Draco would have hexed you, charmed you to a wall, and hexed you again just for good measure.
Hermione, rather stunned by this, was about to ask, but Harry beat her to it. "Why in the world don't you have your wand? Did someone take it?" His auror instincts kicked in, his hold on Scorpius becoming a bit more protective.
"Well, come on then, Scor." He chuckled, tucking the boys head under his chin as he reached down, grabbing a small white unicorn off the fluffy white pillows that sat against the wall and the bed. He held it up, the little child taking it with exhausted glee.
"Well... ahem." Draco cleared his throat, his light blonde hair falling in to his eyes as he tried to readjust the bag gripping around his neck, and the little child fidgeting in his arms. He set Scorpius down, opting to take his hand instead. The little hand was littered in bright colored band-aids. "Thank you for helping Scorpius, but we really must be going." His voice was curt. Draco refused to admit to himself that Potter looked well... good. He had more important things to worry about then rekindling some sort of estranged friendship that never even existed.
Harry made encouraging sounds, reveling in the touch of this gorgeous, gorgeous man. The hand not tangled in his hair began to explore every inch of Draco's back, fingers pressing, stroking, caressing.
"Hopkins, I know every single person on your security team and they won't do a thing to me. I will go to Shackleboltif you don't stop acting like a child."
