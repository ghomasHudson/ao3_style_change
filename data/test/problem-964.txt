Harry made a comforting noise as he wrapped his arms around the other, putting a warm hand on the other’s bloated belly. “Hey! You were the one who suggested the restaurant in the first place, you git! And well, I did warn you that you probably shouldn’t have eaten all of those samosas. The butter chicken and that large serving of rasmalai you also devoured wouldn’t have helped things neither, love.” He pointed out lightly.
This was a very rare spell that of course they had learned from Hermione, and was only done between people who had complete trust between them.
Andromeda, Teddy’s grandmother, had actually asked them a few weeks ago if they could watch the toddler while she took a ladies trip with her sister and Draco’s mother, Narcissa, to France. While the boys had wholeheartedly agreed, unfortunately the trip had been rescheduled due to horrible weather and Teddy being sick for one weekend.
Teddy nodded as he stared at his cousin’s face, listening to his words.
When Draco finished about a few more chapters of his book, he decided to put it away as he watched his lover throw a few ingredients into one of the cast-iron pots and then start preparing the steaks.
The rest of their weekend with Teddy went by quickly.
Draco chuckled before letting out another moan himself as his own arse peed out another stream of diarrhea.
“Ooh, that didn’t sound too good.” Harry grimaced in sympathy as it sounded as if something more may have come out. And the stench was rank enough that Harry had to cast another Olefacio minuere.
Harry finally looked away, green eyes meeting grey for the first time. “I don’t find this disgusting. I think all of this is just as normal as breathing, not shameful like I grew up being taught. But me thinking this just means that I’m…not normal. I’m a freak. Just like they’ve always said.” He admitted.
“And we should have kept a closer eye on her as well.” Draco added. The boys had forgotten to cast an anti magic spell on the playpen to avoid any accidental magic from happening.
With the light from the full moon above them, Harry smiled as he watched his lover swim along with the fishes.
“Oh?” Draco leaned back a bit to read Harry’s face.
Harry gritted his teeth, shaking his head as he tried to take deep breaths in an effort to lessen the cramp. The bugger really hurt!
There was a nice, cozy-looking set up to the side, with hammocks, cushioned chairs, a table and even a sofa laid out around a circle of arranged rocks and logs- which he assumed was where their campfire would go later.
Harry’s heart warmed as he tickled the little boy’s belly, making him laugh out loudly. “More than you’ll ever know, Teddy.” And it was the truth. Harry loved Teddy and considered the little boy as his son.
“Harry?” He called out. Harry, who was currently helping Teddy build a large castle out of blocks, paused to look up questioningly at his lover.
Harry sighed as he looked nervously at the porcelain throne behind him. It was now his turn.
With an audible grunt, Harry watched as a deep fart rumbled out of Draco’s bottom before slowly transforming into a crackling sound instead.
BRRRRRAAAAAAPPPPPPP!....
Draco didn’t care that his hand was getting dirty as he only focused on comforting his now crying lover, hearing his sniffles and whimpers as he continued to unload five days worth of digested food into his knickers.
Sighing in relief, Harry put the blanket back down.
When he was completely cleaned, Harry sighed in relief that this was all almost over. “Okay, now that I’m all clean-“ he gave Draco a blushing look, “The last thing to do is to flush the loo. That’s when you press this little lever here and everything will disappear.”
UUUURRRRPPPPP! Pbbbbblllllttttttt…
“Hawwy go poot poot a lot!” Teddy giggled, his face red with all the laughter.
Harry watched until he felt another tug in his bladder.
Sighing, Harry laid his head back down on the pillow, observing Draco’s face as he slept.
The couple engaged conversation, talking about their upcoming plans, what they needed from grocery store and other mundane things that made Harry once again thankful that this was his life.
They quickly removed the boy’s diaper and gave the boy a quick cleaning spell- he would be taking a bath anyway, so he would be properly cleaned there.
Draco just looked at him confused as Harry shrugged sheepishly. “Just stay and…go here. We can talk about our plans with Teddy this weekend.” He offered.
He let Harry pull his body into a hug and listened when Harry finally spoke up. “Do you know how much I’ve been holding that in? Merlin, I feel better.”
Draco gave a loud grunt which made Harry turn to look at him.
Suddenly a large fart made its way out of his bum.
And Harry did not have a job, but he was the secret benefactor of two orphanages- one in the Muggle world and the other in the Wizarding world- which he and Draco would visit once in a while.
After about an hour later, they decided that it was getting close to bedtime. Putting away the toys, they decided to get the bath ready. Teddy loved taking a bath together with the 2 older men, all of them sharing the tub full of the little boy’s favorite- bubbles!
It was hard to believe that only a few weeks ago, Harry had been poo-shy, so much so that he had been reduced to tears during that fateful ‘accident’.
"Yes. For now, at least." Draco answered as he bent down, giving a clear view of his diarrhea-covered legs and bottom, and ruffled through his pants pocket.
But thanks to Draco’s help and encouragement, Harry slowly became more comfortable in pooping in places other than their toilet.
Draco walked out their floo, having just picked up some takeout for their dinner to see his lover with both arms wrapped around his middle as he was bent over in obvious pain.
Draco grinned as another violent fart left him, but he could only feel it, not hear it. It did also leave a stench that made all three occupant’s noses scrunch up.
Fairy lights hung everywhere- still turned off due to it was still morning, but their glass sparkled in the sunlight. And lanterns also filled the area, turned off as well but it gave Draco security knowing they would have more then enough lighting during sundown.
Harry shook his head when he saw the other narrow his eyes at him. “I don’t mean it in a bad way, just…ohhh?” He said helplessly.
If he thought about it closely enough, the look on Harry’s face looked almost jealous….
After a light dessert of creamy fruit salad, the trio went to the living room where Harry and Draco cuddled on the couch while Teddy sat on the rug in front, watching his tv show.
“This is truly heaven.” Draco sighed, smiling happily up to the other as he accepted one of the chocolate covered cherries that the brunette offered him.
Harry nodded and stood up, pulling up his pants once more.
They had told him that after everything Harry went through, he deserved a few years to live for only himself, and no one else.
“Marmalade. And its in the bottom left drawer- I had to do a few rearranging when your Mother sent us those antique dishes.” Harry pointed out.
Draco, who was also not paying attention but working on an essay for Charms, looked questioningly at his lover who sat right next to him. “What’s wrong, Harry?”
But he couldn’t resist getting his posh boyfriend out of his comfort zone.
Urrp! Brrrt!
Biting his lip, Harry shifted his eyes to the tub and with a slight pause, Harry quickly made his way inside, ripping off his clothes as he did so.
After finishing off the tiramisu and putting away the leftover crackers and chocolate (they devoured all the marshmallows), they moved to cuddle together on the sofa.
A thought suddenly occurred to him and Harry’s eyes widened as he looked down at himself, lifting the blanket slightly.
The couple then decided to spend the night together (completely innocently) in the Room of Requirement where they could snog and cuddle together with complete privacy and no interruptions.
“Ugh, even though this coffee brand is one of the best, it never fails to go straight through me.” Draco said exasperation, his stomach giving a loud gurgle.
He knew that Harry had been anxious about going in front of him, his fear amplified due to his past trauma caused by those blasted relatives of his. So the blond did his best to make sure his lover felt comfortable, safe and especially loved and would trust that Draco would always be there for him and nothing would ever change that.
Leaning forward to place a soft kiss on the other’s forehead, Harry sighed as he tucked the blonde’s head under his chin and he now stared out their window.
When Draco was finally all clean, Harry dropped the now yellowish brown tissues into the bushes behind them. He also casted a Olefacio minuere directly on Draco to rid of any lingering stenches left behind.
“Mnmnm…” Harry grumbled as he tried to shove his face in the soft flesh in front of him.
Harry groaned. “I already did- he said he was visiting his Muggle in-laws in Canada at the moment and won’t be able to come here until next week.”
Draco raised his eyebrow at his cousin. “And what do we say?”
Draco nodded. “Leave Teddy to us, Aunt. We won’t promise that he’ll be completely potty trained by the time you return, but at least he’ll have the idea in his mind.”
Draco could feel when Harry’s body finally gave in, as his body stiffened and Draco could feel a round mound form, stretching the pants material as it keep growing larger underneath the palm of the blond’s hand.
Pffffssssssssss….
Teddy nodded and watched his cousin with his full attention.
The following day, the three enjoyed visiting Muggle London together, where Harry decided to bring them all to the zoo.
When Teddy nodded, he continued. “Make sure you sit down on the seat and make yourself comfortable. Then you can go.” The room was quiet once more as they waited for what would happen next.
Draco was certain that they had reached a whole new level of intimacy and love in their relationship after today.
Harry’s mouth shut as he watched the other stand up, but then he looked confused as he watched the other turn away an audible fart sounding as he made his way out of the room.
“Again!” Teddy demanded but Draco shook his head and moved him away from the toilet.
Teddy managed to stay energetic until they hit the aquarium. The tired little boy was now found snoring lightly on Harry’s shoulder.
BBBRRRRRTTTTTRT!
Draco’s pout deepened. “I still don’t understand why you like it when I do that sort of thing so much.” He huffed.
When he was done, Harry closed his eyes and grabbed up the rest of his nerve. He could do this.
“Sorry about that.” Draco apologized, his piss starting to tamper off. Teddy looked down at the puddle, his mouth in a cute small ‘o’ shape.
Harry nodded. “I want to go to one more place first and then we can go.”
He really didn’t know what to think. He didn’t know how he felt.
Draco was worried as he placed his hand on the other’s stomach, frowning when he felt the other’s very distended belly, harsh rumbles moving against his hand.
Unfortunately, their bowels wasn’t quite done yet as they both had to pause about halfway to the stream and they practically ripped down their knickers as diarrhea shot out from their arses.
Harry reddened but gave a small nod.
Giving another yawn, Draco shuffled back into the bed, Harry quickly opening his arms for the other to fall right into before falling back to sleep.
Draco reached up and held Harry’s face, lightly but firmly making the brunette meet his eyes. “Harry. We promised that we would be open with each other about anything and never lie to one another. You shared your childhood with those horrid muggles to me and I shared the torture I went through when Voldemort was living under my roof. We both know each other too well for you to lie to me now- and yes, it’s completely obvious that you’re lying about being alright even though I know you’re anything but right now.”
“Miss me, Hawwy?” Teddy asked in his cute high voice, eyes sparkling up at his godfather.
“How you are able to drink that, I’ll never know.” Harry eyed the drink in Draco’s hands, shaking his head.
He then guided his boyfriend to help him bend over, aiming his dirtied arsehole at the bush.
Harry looked down as he quietly answered. “It’s…d-different. I think it’s fine for you but it’s different when it’s me. Not just embarrassing but it’s like it too intimate, too…too much. It’s dirty.” He mumbled the last part mostly to himself.
Glamping stood for Glamorous Camping. It was like luxury found in the woods and apparently the ‘in’ thing that a lot of Muggles did nowadays.
Draco was still sitting on the tub, watching Harry’s lesson with interest, and gave him an encouraging smile when their eyes met. That smile gave Harry more confidence to proceed on.
“For the Wizarding way, it usually takes longer to learn it because magic is involved. Mother taught me the hand motions and how to harness my young magic back then to clean myself and vanish the waste away. Although I couldn’t do anything about the smell- one usually needs a wand for that level of magic.” Draco raised an eyebrow at Harry, who could do the spell both wandlessly and wordlessly.
After the war, it was Harry’s testimony that kept Draco and Narcissa out of Azkaban. In fact, they got off pretty lightly- the only punishment was for both of them to be on probation for one year, which included Narcissa being under house arrest and Draco needing to attend 8th year at Hogwarts during that time.
“I’ll need to kip out for a bit to pick up some potion ingredients.” Draco told him, taking a sip of his coffee.
“Ooh!” He grunted as he got a lapful of blonde wizard suddenly landing on his lap.
URRRPP!
And he had been so gassy!
The two ate large helpings of everything, eating directly from the dishes themselves, not caring about proper table manners as there really wasn’t any need to out there in the wilderness.
They sat on the chairs, pushed side by side close to each other, watching the fire as they enjoyed a dessert of what Harry called ‘camping tiramisu’ and of course, s’mores.
Harry chuckled as he did the same and let his piss sprinkle onto the trees as well.
He had been a die-hard tea fan until he got together with Draco and discovered the wonderful world of coffee. Now Harry preferred to drink coffee right when he woke up and enjoyed tea later in the day.
“Oh, that’s right. Well, that makes sense.” Harry nodded.
Draco groaned as a spluttering fart came out.
A few more farts shot out, making the little boy giggle some more. “When that is done, make sure you-ooh….you cast a spell to cancel out any sounds that come out- it’s not polite for others to hear you.” Contradicting to his words, Draco let out another bubbly fart just then.
Harry then let out a louder whimper and Draco felt a sudden wetness spreading on the front of his own pants.
**Here is the second chapter! I’ll be updating this story every week, same time, so look forward to it!
Harry could feel his eyes tear up again. He hugged the other tight and nodded his head, telling the other that he was only comfortable around him and loved Draco so much.
He felt Draco rub his back, trying to comfort him. Harry gave him a grateful look before he winced when a particularly violent fart left him.
Now, Victoire didn’t know if she’ll ever get any more desserts or even be allowed back into their home after what she did.
While thinking of last night (not the sex but what happened before that), Harry eyed himself ‘down there’.
Draco’s heart melted at that. Never had he thought that the gross quirk he grew up with- where when he burped, sometimes his bum would just follow up with a fart- would actually be something that someone else would find ‘cute’.
“Just let it go, baby. It’ll be alright.” Draco assured him. One of his hands cupped over his lover’s bum in reassurance as he lifted his other hand to guide Harry’s head to his shoulder and rubbed the other’s back.
“This spell is short lived and once you release your gas, it will smell again-nnh! I personally like to leave this spell for last since I do not fancy having to constantly cast it after every bout of gas.” Draco explained, Teddy nodding.
Trying his best to be quick and thorough, Harry quickly wiped himself, trying not to show too much to the other two.
The couple waved the little family goodbye, reassuring the parents that their daughter will always be welcomed into their home.
Draco rolled his eyes but was smiling. “As long as there’s salad as well, then alright.”
Draco nodded as he closed the the shelf and moved to where his lover pointed.
But his lover managed to wear down his resolve and that prat knew exactly how weak Draco was against his puppy dog look- those blasted green eyes of his could make Draco do anything to his will.
But that was why he couldn’t figure out why he was still so hung up on the fact of how other wizards, specifically Draco, did their elimination so differently to the Muggle way.
It more tissues to throughly clean off the splatters of diarrhea on the back and between his lover’s thighs, making the blonde’s face become hotter when Harry gave special attention to his balls.
Well, maybe a little which was understandable due to the waste that was involved, but he wasn’t disgusted by Draco or not even by the act of soiling itself.
With that, the couple decided it was time to change into actual clothing before finally starting their day with wards, flowers and garden gnomes.
He only waved to her goodbye, and she turned to awkwardly shuffle through the crowd in her costume.
Draco pulled him into a room just before a bend. Even if they were alone he didn’t want to risk the chance of someone walking in on their conversation, at least with a locked door he could control the ears in the room.
Draco couldn’t help the gust of air that must have been a laugh escape him, sometimes it was too easy.
Then, with great force, something struck Draco in the back of the head faster than he could react, letting darkness rush in.
Just hold on to me by the knuckle
The moment Draco felt the eyes off his back as he turned the corner he broke into a run, he sprinted so fast down the steps to the second floor he nearly slid and fell at the landing. His heart was racing, he could hear it in his ears and the beats kept pace with his footfalls. It drummed so rapidly it almost hurt and by the time he’d made it inside his room he was gripping it against his chest. His fingers clawed into his black robes, trying to hold and cage his heart in place before it made any attempt to leap into his throat and escape out his wide, gasping mouth. No air was passing through his lips, he realised.
He found out her favourite colour was yellow and she was planning to incorporate it into her costume this year. She even told him that her favourite subject was mythical animal science and she had a rabbit familiar named Gummy (he was thirteen and had lost most of his teeth).
“Yes, sir. Headmaster told Niffler so.”
It was the memory of his sister the night she died.
Sirius waited for what was really on the other man’s mind. It took some time, after several slow exhales of smokey breath, but Dumbledore let out a haunted sigh and finally explained:
“At least other couples get to
“I do, do you mind?” He said smoothly.
gasp! another omega !  i wanted to have someone in the younger years but i didnt want them to be in gryffindor (cough ginny sorry...)
“I think…I need to see Headmaster Dumbledore."
Potter somehow convinced Draco that he needed to tag along in order to track down Luna.
That same stubborn strand of blond hair swung into view again. Before the boy could reach up and sweep it away, Severus did it for him.
“I don’t believe Draco is capable to set aside his personal beliefs to do what it takes to bond with you, Harry.”
Snape nodded. “A point to Ravenclaw. Were this a normal, weaker boggart the shock caused with your greater spell casting ability would kill it. However this one has had all summer to fester and become quite powerful. It will take a couple of tries before it is ready to be expelled from the cabinet. Who will go first?”
for Sirius Black?” Draco said, baffled and blushing hard. In the moment he was shamefully reminding himself of his mother’s old cat. She would wriggle and squirm like Draco was in Harry’s arms whenever someone would dare pick her up and pet her. She was a mean thing, black with piercing blue eyes.
Snape was already waiting for him just outside his study’s doors.
“…Thank you?”
He shook his head.
Draco stared her in the eyes as he processed what she was telling him, she smiled weakly in return.
The wolf rises onto its hind legs, its mouth open and panting, thick strands of saliva and blood were webbing from tooth to tooth.
“Only if you say yes,” Harry looked up at him, there was a twinkle in his eyes. He wasn’t wearing glasses, Draco finally realised. You could easily make out the thick lashes surrounding the edges of his eyes.
The students
He wasn’t dancing seriously, Draco wasn’t sure if Harry even knew how to. Harry just looked like he was only in it to have fun, to listen and to participate, rather than to be the best. Draco looked over at the corner of the Hall where the Slytherin’s controlled, he instantly made out Adrian and Blaise competitively dancing, each one offering a perfectly performed traditional Wizard’s dance, to the point they were both a little flushed and puffed out. Draco decided Harry wasn’t worth over-performing for anyway, likely he wouldn’t have appreciated the complexity of the choreography.
Professor McGonagall looked affronted. “Harry has already agreed to be your mate.”
The older man narrowed his eyes, his lip curling tightly with displeasure. He didn’t like being interrogated.
“Tell me about it.” He said with a sigh. “This has been - to put it politely - an absolute cockup of a semester.”
But that blasted mud-blood fool just had to open her fat mouth.
She met with the other Alpha the night before the semester would start, she was already planning to have Severus swear his loyalty to her son regardless. The original plan was to Mark Draco as a Death Eater, later he would be the set in motion to their plan to infiltrate the castle. To kill Dumbledore, Harry Potter, and all traitors. She would have had the man help Draco in his mission any way he could, but now it was to just save him, any way he could. She knew that meant he had to be sent away from the school by any means necessary, each day that passed meant the Dark Lord was ever nearer to unleashing his expanding army. Greyback had recovered and was retrieved from prison by Yaxley, who were both now sitting in her chairs in front of her, eating the food lain out by her house elves. The wolfish man noticed her looking at him and gave a wide, sharp smile.
She rolled her eyes.
Narcissa gripped her skirts so tightly she might have stretched the expensive fabric. In translation: What did the Dark Lord know of Draco?
(See the end of the chapter for
Bellatrix Lestrange was captured, but severely injured. While Rodulphus Lestrange was killed by McGonagal, who reflected his killing curse back at him. Several other Death Eaters lay littered in black heaps, stunned or dead. Some had escaped, but the real numbers were still unknown.
— he’d at least write a fucking note first. He took a long breath in through his nose and let it out through his mouth, and counted slowly to himself, a method of calming himself Snape taught Draco. Back when he was still receiving private lessons to control his Omegan magic, back when Draco still had hope of being free. The true lesson he learnt was that goodwill could only ever last so long, and eventually payment In exchange for kindness was always owed in
They stood there quietly for an unbearable amount of time.
Forever, my love, we're in circle
“Don’t let him hear you say that or he’ll let it get to his head,” Draco grumbled, and then he paused. He stared hard at something in the distance before blinking when a thought struck him. “Maybe I could hide out in the forest until it’s all over? The wards extend past the forest, I could camp out there for a few days?” Dumbledore would surely forgive him? If no harm came to anyone, it’s not like he had a real case against Draco.
“Between you and I? Mother would love it. If she found out I had a thing for Betas I’d probably lose the inheritance to my last three fathers.”
He was going to stay.
“Now,” she said, “don’t think I didn’t notice that it was Potter
Draco shooed her away from the table and hushed her before a teacher could notice her hysterics. “Shut up, it’s fine. Be none the wiser and let others waste their booze if they want. Dumbledore’s not so stupid to think that Seventh Years wouldn’t sneak in
“Draco?”
“Luna!” Draco tried, looking around. There were at least twenty owls in the open room, all cooing and staring at him with wide, curious eyes.
For his family.
He could fight bloody tooth and nail, and take everyone down in this school with him.
He was right beside the bed, but Draco was too tired to move further away.
“I wan to twy too! I a big boy!” Teddy chirped up excitedly.
“How is it, love?” Harry turned and saw his boyfriend standing at the doorway, a crying  Victoire, in the blond’s arms.
And that weird expression on his lover’s face whenever he watch Draco relieve himself in front of the other. Harry didn’t even smile like he usually did when Draco once again let out one of his burp-farts by accident.
Harry sighed as he took in a whiff of his hazelnut coffee, the caffeine much needed to keep him going all day.
As he dropped the tissue into the toilet, he opened his mouth to say something but shut it again when he felt Draco giving his hand a squeeze.
Draco suddenly recalled the past few days, remembering the odd behavior of his lover.
Placing a soft kiss on his lover’s head, Draco’s lips lingered there as he slowly fell asleep.
Storing any lingering thoughts away in his mind, knowing that he will come back to examine those later, Harry now focused solely on his love, leaning in as he placed a sweet kiss on the other lips.
Draco’s jaw dropped. “Harry! That was five days ago! You’ve been holding it in this entire time?”
Draco was the one to help lift Teddy up so the little boy could flush the toilet himself. Again, Harry notice Draco give a slight jolt at the sound but Teddy was fascinated as he saw the tissues swirl down until they disappeared.
Harry blushed harder as he whispered so quietly that Draco almost missed the words. “Since the day the toilet had broken.” He confessed.
“Alright, so can I know why are you so against going the wizardly way?” Draco asked, looking nothing but curious at this.
Harry breathed as he stared out the window again, trying to sort out his thoughts and feelings and what they meant.
Just as Harry wrapped his arms around the blonde’s waist and hugged the other tighter to him, Draco suddenly gave the other a light push, sleepily shaking his head as he started to move away.
“There’s always room for dessert.” Draco grinned as he spooned some tiramisu into his own mouth.
Suddenly the sound of a airy fart filled the air with a hissing that quickly made any thoughts floating in Harry’s head quickly halt and suddenly Harry’s only focus was on Draco and Draco only.
Harry grabbed Teddy and swung him around a few times, loving his shrill laughter that filled the room.
As Harry continued to unload, sounds of gas being mixed in as he defecated, Draco felt a familiar drop in his own belly.
Sighing, Draco wrinkled his nose at the smell and waved a hand around his arse as he cuddled to Harry’s side once more.
“Yeah, but that was in front of only you- not my godson.” Harry pouted.
After they had a good shag on that exceptionally soft rug, the two headed back to the campsite for a small lunch (the champagne and sweets had filled them up quite a bit).
Feeling a pull in his bladder, Draco decided it was time to get out of the hammock.
Alright, so he didn’t have any fetishes in regards to ‘that’. That was good to know.
As for Ginny, her only wish for Harry was she hoped he’d found someone to share his life with so he wouldn’t be taking care of Teddy alone. At the time, they had already broken up but they actually became more closer than before since they had also came out to each other as gay the same day they broke up.
“Potty training the Muggle way is actually much easier to learn than the Wizarding way. I admit, I learned how to go the Muggle way long before I did the Wizarding way. All you have to do is hold it in long enough to sit down on the seat, after all.” Draco rolled his eyes.
His godson was in a laughing fit right now (mostly because the sounds his godfather was making was so funny!) but Harry couldn’t even care as he couldn’t stop the farts from coming out once he freed them.
There was something else Harry did not regret about coming back. After 7 years of hatred, many weeks of grief, forgiveness and tentative friendships, and finally 4 days of plotting by 2 of the scariest girls that Harry still wonders why he considers his friends (Hermione and Pansy are truly a terrifying pair…and speaking of scary girls, this includes Ginny- which Harry refuses to believe had nothing to do with the plan based on the smirks she sent him when he spotted her with the terrible duo), Harry finally got together with his former arch-nemesis and the great git of his life, Draco Malfoy.
Giving a yawn, Draco laid his head back down on the pillow, smiling when he heard Harry mumble into his chest as he nuzzled his head against him.
When they woke up again the sun was just beginning to set. They went back to where the rug laid, and cuddled there as they enjoyed the sunset together.
(=^w^=)**************************
“Insecto Aspernalbis” With a downward flick of his wand, Harry could hear Draco’s sigh of relief as the constant buzzing from all the bugs around them was finally silenced.
The first few days, his stomach was in turmoil, constantly gurgling and rumbling at every moment.
After their trip to the zoo, they had chosen a cute child’s potty- one that had the characters of Teddy’s favorite show on it- and bought it before going home. They had gotten two so that Andromeda could have one at her house as well.
He couldn’t tell if he was in the wrong for staying while his love was about to do…that. But by the look of Draco’s face, he then wondered if maybe he was wrong for thinking that this was…not normal while the blonde obviously found no issues with their current situation.
Draco and Andromeda exchanged a fond look between them as they watched the cute scene before them.
Teddy cheered up at that and nodded his head excitedly.
After a few minutes, Harry was finally done but Draco continued to hug him until he calmed down.
He held his arms up for the little girl and once in his arms, gave her a soft kiss on her cheeks. “Oh, honey. It’s alright. It was only an accident after all.”
Wiping himself down, the blond used the tissues to cover his ‘butt baby’. Harry helped by covering it with dirt and leaves so no one could tell anything.
Just as the blonde moved to leave, Harry had grabbed his hand to stop him and still laughing, tugged the blond back on the couch.
“Where are you going?” Harry asked, a bit grumpily as he had been looking forward to having a morning cuddle with the other for their first morning together in their new house.
Brrrrrlllllllllllttttttttttttt!...
BBBLLLLLLLTTTTTT!...^%€£+^#%...
Harry continued to watch until the butt bombs that was going off in his lover’s derrière was slowing down, the stream of endless feces ending as his lovers farts became more airer and less moist than before.
During his History Of Magic class, Harry, who was slowly nodding off like usual, suddenly lifted his head and looked at the Professor in shock.
Harry nodded. "Yeah, and maybe since it was you’re first time eating food made on the campfire, then maybe that- ugh..." Harry stopped what he was saying when his own stomach suddenly began to cramp. Very badly.
“URRRRRPP!” Harry let out his own belch, sighing at his patted his stomach. “Excuse me.” He said sweetly, as he winked at his lover and grinned as his godson giggled.
“Sounds good,” the dark haired Alpha said, not quite looking at Dumbledore, more interested in staring perfervidly at Draco himself. “See ya then.”
to anyone that would listen. The Omega wondered where the Alpha of the house was, he gravely needed somebody - even his body tingled approvingly at the mere thought of the man, and he could feel his internal muscles flex with need at what someone like Sirius could offer. It wasn’t the first time he’d tempted these thoughts, and now here Draco was again.
The older Alpha rubbed an eye and grit his teeth as if baring the pain of an on-coming headache before answering him with a weary, “I don’t know.”
“Then you’d both be no different than any other normally-functioning mated couple. Congratulations.” She clapped slowly and let out a pathetic ‘woo’ out loud into the quiet of the common room.
“Pansy stop thinking with your genitals for a second. Merlin.” His hands came up to scrub at his face roughly. “This is actually serious.”
“This okay?” Sirius challenged, hoping the Omega would say yes.
The Headmaster nodded, still smiling. “How did you find your time spent back with Sirius? I heard you two have become quite close, family is important.”
This time Dumbledore did not speak again, and only stared at the pale boy. If he was annoyed at the lack of stimulating responses, he didn’t show it.
” The half-giant merely raised his enormous hands in surrender and stood back as a peace offering.
“Jesus,” said Dean, shovelling down spoonfuls of baked beans. “Nasty trollop.”
“Damnit!”
As the train stirred to life and began to edge out of the terminal, Draco watched Sirius on the platform. The man looked as if an idea struck him, and he crumbled to the floor and disappeared into his clothes, only to emerge back out as a shaggy black dog. Draco gasped and pressed his hands into the cool glass to get a better look - Sirius seemed to notice the reaction and hopped around in a circle with a paw raised, long tail wagging.
It hooted at her and fluttered its wings a couple of times before pecking the unassuming crumb out of existence.
“Proceed.” Snape stood back, hands still behind his back. He was absorbed into the small crowd.

Dumbledore rubbed his eyes underneath his glasses, the contented tone in his aged voice quickly withered into something now on the cusp of complete collapse. As he spoke he slowly made his way back to his own chair. “We are, Harry. Of course. But things have become…Compromised.”
Draco ran his hands through his hair. Maybe this was why he didn’t visit, he was getting too old for her bullshit.
He sucked in a sharp breath when it parted the skin slightly, pushing the plump lips apart… Fireworks exploded in his head and he gargled out a ridiculously loud cry into the cemetery silence. He felt his torso and hips lunge downwards, his body engaging in its own desires, greedily attempting to swallow the large fist sized lump.
Harry gave a mystified laugh at the bizarre interaction. The house elf bowed so low it practically collapsed over the floor, arms splayed out long and apart, the bat-like ears pointing down. Draco realised it was completely ignoring him, it’s bow directed towards Harry instead.
Draco touched the front, never seeing a book like this in his life. “Where’d you get this monstrosity?”
“Dumbledore’s sending me away. I’ll be back in a week.”
She silenced her bubbling thoughts when the unmistakable black mist formed at the head of the table, all nearby light was sucked into it, and it grew until the Dark Lord’s translucent face emerged. His hands creeped out from the darkness to lay flat on top of the grand table. The darkness receded into his animated black robes, the torn pieces seeming to flap even without the presence of wind.
The walk back to the castle was a shameful one, he was in a shock blanket conjured up by Snape. It was bright orange and felt like a target on his back.
“Very well. Do not disappoint me again.”
“I don’t,” he lied.
Draco decided to talk to him.
The Omega would never be able to explain exactly what came over him, only knowing that it was too late to stop the gamut of emotions that came over him. Instead of attempting to communicate with words, Draco only flung his arms around the man’s waist, burrowing his cheek into his large chest.
The two of them had been quickly healed but their clothes weren’t cleaned, they both had caking patches of blood lining their shirts collars.
Harry looked like he was going to argue that, but instead he shook his head in no, either to Draco or to himself. The boy was growing redder by the second, and the once faint Alpha scent quickly swelled and intensified, being carried by the expanding stink of nervous sweat. Draco admitted he’d heard rumours that the great Golden Boy himself was painfully awkward when it came to girls he fancied, but this was something else. He seemed nervous, but also furious, those scarred hands were shaking into balled fists.
to silence his weeping body.
“Of course not. Maybe next week?”
Seeing as there wasn’t going to be the usual dinner, student were expected to take part in the food available throughout the ball - Lucia and Eleanor had been the ones to direct the house elves’ food prep for it, scheduling the menu and even going so far as to volunteer work in the kitchens themselves sometimes. There were so many options that there was at least one dish starting with every letter of the alphabet. There was even eyeball punch, with eyes that blinked (which was bound to be spiked at some point - if not already).
SORRY FOR THE WAIT EVERYONE I LOVE U ALL IM GOING TO REPLY TO ALL THE COMMENTS NOW THAT I HAVE A CHANCE... ITS BEEN A LONG WHILE!!!! THEN I'M GOING TO DOODLE AND POST SOME ART FOR THIS IN AN UPDATE SO STAY TUNED! <3 THNX FOR THE SUPPORT IVE ALSO DECIDED ON THE NUMBER OF CHAPTERS!!!!
a name in his house since he could remember, was flirting with him. Then he reminded himself that they’d already fucked once before, and he couldn’t help the familiar tight feeling wind up in his belly.
“It’s alright, and no that doesn’t make me feel any better at all, but thanks.” He accepted her hand-up as she pulled the both of them to their feet.
She grinned and dug around for something in her book-bag, she pulled out a fistful of notes and passed them over. Harry took them with a passing thought that he might need to straighten them out a bit, already predicting that Draco wasn’t going to look at them in this state.
Her eyes narrowed and she pursed her lips disapprovingly. “I’ve heard of him. Hello.”
also YES before you ask draco does have a pusspuss. he has both. I tried to explain it throughout the story that it was there while not being so obvious about it lol >w>
“Fuck’s sake…” Sirius rubbed his eyes, soothing the pain blooming behind them. “If you say so.”
On the map her little black dot could be found moving around in the Owlery.
He noticed Professor Snape comfortably cloaked in shadow by the doors, leaning back with his arms crossed, acting in his role as chaperone and looking every bit as bored out of his mind as possible.
She took hold of his wrist and lead him down towards the girls’ dormitories, the charm that once made the halls shrink when a boy dared journey through was disabled by students many decades ago, prefects never bothered to report it, and every Slytherin Head of House never cared enough to enforce a serious divide, except during Deloris’ short reign.
here's a quick short update!!! finally finished chapter 19 <3
“You absolute psycho, Lovegood.” Marcus barked, laughing.
.” Draco’s stomach lurched.
“That’s good to hear. Do you mind giving us a moment, then, Poppy?”
Draco snapped, unhappy with how quickly she was solving this issue.
“So will you be bonding soon?” She asked.
He poked around at the Brussels sprouts he randomly picked for himself, rolling them in golden gravy. To be honest he wasn’t really hungry. He couldn't taste a thing knowing everyone was gossiping about what had happened today. He was either a rape victim or he was asking for it. His gender made people's opinion of it complicated because it was technically what he was made for. He wished people just didn't have an opinion of it at all. He wished everyone would just shut up.
He knew enough about the Slytherin, like how he was not to be trusted.
just wanted to get this out of the way so i could start writing for that good old heat we all know and wnat
“And Draco,” Dumbledore said gravely, turning to him. The effect that grandfatherly frown had on a person was bizarre because Draco was suddenly feeling the shame that Potter must have been feeling.
“Draco?” Potter nudged him, waiting for his answer.
“Hmm… Perhaps Draco?” His professor said, his sinister motive as obvious as the sun in the middle of the afternoon. The man was practically toying with him.
The serious problem was this was the first time since Grimmauld Place that Draco had been in so close a proximity to Potter for longer than thirty minutes. He could smell him
you?” She spat, she leaned in so close Draco could count the mamelons on each tooth.
Draco tried to shove Niffler aside at the face, but the skin on it’s cheek was like elastic, old leather. The only thing that moved were it’s eyes bulging from its sockets.
“I don’t…”
“Why do you care?”
Draco visibly hesitated.
As the boy struggled with an on-coming wave of sleep vertigo as soon as he was standing, the elf was swishing his finger in the air, summoning Draco’s robes and personal things,
Blaise couldn’t help the smile. “Why would an Alpha like me want to be bonded to a powerful and influential Omega like yourself?”
” His words curt, and intending to hurt.
clay pots, silver, bronze, linen-bags.
Then he looked up in time to see her gasp in alarm.
Dumbledore gave a single nod to the explanation, then summoned his pipe from a shelf tucked away on the second level of the study. Once it was packed then magically lit, the Headmaster went into exhausted retelling of recent events from his perspective.
If Harry now was put to the challenge, he’d fail too.
She giggled instead of compensating him with a response, giving her two favourite boys a quick kiss on the crowns of their heads before she retired for the night.
Dumbledore took another toke of his pipe in solemn silence.
Her big blue eyes blinked. “Alright… Could you help me hand out my the next copy of the Quibbler, it’s coming out Tuesday. I wouldn’t normally ask but it’s just been so popular.”
His glare, lack of costume, and overall demeanour said the man wished he was anywhere else but here, and it warned students to stay the hell away if they knew what was good for them.
But Draco’s mild unease from the unwanted attention would soon burgeon to panic, when he seemed to be the only one who noticed the Slytherin Head of House seize up and flee the room, while clutching at his right arm tightly through his sleeve.
He made a note to self: Stop lying to Pansy.
He had managed to buy himself some time.
“And you seem to be safe and healthy, I can only assume your magic was under control.”
Sirius sat back down.
Draco parted his lips to let out a gasp of surprise - from what, exactly, Severus couldn’t tell. The closeness? The oath? Perhaps both.
What left could he do?
“Why?” The old man urged. He conjured a napkin for the Omega who took it gratefully.
“Oh! Oh…Fuck! Alpha!”
.” He snaps his fingers for the immediate attention of his servants, ironically, Alphas. They drag her away, into her room, without her husband and wand. She was no longer in control of her own home.
There was still enough sunlight for the boy to cast his gaze around the room, curious to see what else Sirius left the same and what might have changed. It only took him a couple of seconds before his eyes caught the disarray of colour overwhelming the surface of his mirrored cabinet desk, he choked on his saliva and felt his heart skip several beats when he finally made out what exactly he was looking at — Lined up proudly on his desk was a collection of phallic objects. It was the first time he’d ever seen something like this in his life, and the awe made him at a loss of how to proceed. There was a horrifyingly elaborate range of variety from an average-sized penis no bigger than Draco’s own to an enormous purple monstrosity he wasn’t sure could fit anywhere inside him without crushing his organs. There were at least fifteen or twenty of them standing like some art show piece, some looked more normal and resembled a phallus, others took on more sinister and outlandish shapes with tapered heads, bumpy or ribbed shafts, or enormous bulges on the bottom that imitated an Alpha’s knot. Each one was a different colour, a different length, one seemed to be wiggling on its own.
“But it’s not like it’s a big deal or anything, I mean I’m sure you can smell what I’ve been up to? Right? Surely.”
If possible, the light shone even brighter.
A truce wouldn’t be likely any time soon.
There was always Luna. How exactly did she manage being 16 years old in a private boarding school swarming with horny, unmated Alphas and still remain unbonded? She never mentioned any particular difficulties with her magic, in fact at first scent you wouldn’t have been able to tell if she was an Omega at all with her stink pouch and heavy hand on pheromone suppressants. He recalled her also mentioning on the train she was fortunate enough to present early like an Omega was supposed to, but Lucia did too and she couldn’t escape their dreaded fate.
“Since when have you ever cared what’s
“I think it’s cute. Besides, petal, you won’t be short on finding anyone for the Halloween ball coming up.” Pansy was curling her hair with a finger, examining the pour of students make their way to their classes before the next bell rang. “I mean…That is if darling Potter doesn’t do it.”
“So what’s it like? A heat,” Pansy said sleepily.
hi guys!!!!! happy (early) christmas!! so sorry for the super long wait but in my defence this chapter is 10k long hahaa! next chapter please be prepared to see the story move on to good old hoggie-wartsie! hope everyone is gonna have an amazing christmas :) (a christmas chapter wont happy until another 2-3 updates lmao so that will be a little delayed!) i hope you guys appreciate how difficult it is to come up with a comprehensive biological universe for a/b/o while still making things interesting and different. so far i hope im making sense but if not i promise my goal is to keep filling in the cracks as i go along !
Then Draco yielded, and he sighed when the ache in his joints from lack of use finally caught up with his racing mind.
He was such an idiot.
“There is no one left, no witnesses”
He wished he’d never been born.
“I thought we got over this when we did this the first time.” Potter said bitterly. “It turned out fine.”
When Draco finally returned to Scotland, it was still early enough in the morning that the sun had only just completed its sequential rise. Being a Saturday, Hogwarts grounds were already bustling - there were students in their pyjamas on brooms playing a quick game of Quidditch, some were swimming in the lake or taking walks along the stone paths up on the hillside.
“The pound shop when my dad took me to muggle London.”
“Draco? What are you doing, darling?” That was Pansy’s voice, she prowled from out of the shadows, hands behind her back. One of her dark eyebrows was quirked up questioningly. “I was on my way to the kitchens. Did you want to come with and sneak some food to bring back to the common room?”
Please. Stop.
also me: girl.....
“Draco, what’s happening?” Pansy said frustratedly, she dropped the magazine back at its place on top. “You’re an Omega, so what? No one’s treated you any different in Slytherin. We love you. But we feel like you’re ashamed of us. Clearly you’re doing this for Loony - why? Why aren’t you telling me anything?” She was beginning to cry, her mascara running down her face in black streaks. “I - I just want things to go back to normal. Do you hate me, Draco? Have I upset you?”
“Get… Your hand… Off…Me.” Draco seethed slowly, each word was an attempt to regain his composure, his hair was falling away to curtain his eyes. He took a  long breath through his nose. “I don’t want your help. You may have me bonded to you, but it means nothing, and it will fade away soon enough. You will not acknowledge me or speak to me, I don’t want to be reminded every time of what I did. Stay away from me.”
From above Draco could see the dozens of curious heads poking out from the shattered windows to see what had happened below. It would be a miracle if the Headmaster could explain how an area mass the size of a small Quidditch pitch was burnt to cinders without mentioning Draco. Perhaps they could say a dragon flew over and sneezed?
“Woah - nice to see you too,” said Sirius in surprise.
Oliver snatched at one of his forearms and forced it upwards, as Draco began to shout another hand had come and covered his mouth. Without his wand he couldn’t do a thing, with that thought settling in Draco’s whole body began to shake. New tears were welling up and running across Oliver’s hand. “I should be your mate,” Oliver said like it was law. “You need someone who can protect you. Let me do that. I want to be your Alpha. I can be a good Alpha. Your true Alpha - ” Draco bit him, a humble attempt at resistance. Oliver snarled and cast a quick binding charm that forced Draco to seal his own mouth closed with his two hands. He was then pushed to the ground, on his back with his hands remained glued to his face, as if he was trying to keep a secret. Oliver didn’t waste any time trying to yank Draco’s uniform trousers past his thighs. Draco was going to be sick.
And I'll keep wearing the weight of you
A lone wolf cries out in the distance, the sound of it seems to be coming closer as each second passes. Draco attempts to run, but the trees give up no clearing, they were planted so close together that even his hand couldn’t slip through, he was trapped.
“See you Friday…” Harry said pathetically after him, but it was too late.
“Do you really not like me that much?” Said Potter once they reached the bottom and had slipped out from the entrance.
, it was like a centuries-old modus vivendi was now invalidated, and something unnatural was taking place tonight.
“I don’t know, anywhere. I’ll go anywhere.”
“All of this, Harry. All of it. All the bullshit. You wanting to take Malfoy to the dance, you running off and disappearing on Sunday instead of coming with us for lunch at Hagrid’s, what else? You fucking the little cunt! We were this close to having him gone and out of our lives and you fuck him - ” Ron snapped and then skidded to a halt, he looked as if the memories were causing him to short circuit. His red hair matched his face and his hands, which he was digging the heels of into his eyes. It looked almost like he was on the verge of gouging his eyes out from the frustration. “You can’t possibly like him. Getting it out of your system was one thing, but he’s gotten into your head. I mean - for crying out loud - you were already obsessed since First Year, but ever since Malfoy presented you’ve been
“Hello, Potter. Zabini.”
on your arse?”
they were nearly as thick as his own fingers. It’s head was a bulbous, bludger sized thing, and was followed by 12-inches and a fat knot shape at the base. The site of it made Draco’s mouth water, unable to resist a few gulps.
“Oh, hi. Yeah.” Harry shook her outstretched hand and paused a little for a second, surprised. His mouth hung open before he blinked back to reality and let go of her hand. He stood back and pushed Draco forward by the small of his back. “Have you met Mal - Draco?”
He wished he’d never presented in the first place.
Harry looked up to monitor across the room at the mention of his name;
Hagrid had offered to carry him but Draco nipped that suggestion in the bud effectively - by barking harshly. “I can
“What?” Draco snapped, growing impatient that they still weren’t moving.
Draco trembled to the bone. He shook so hard his knees began to knock against each other.
“I thought I’d try something different. It’s what’s in with Muggles, right?” He stared at the man challengingly.
After crawling on his sore knees towards the door, Draco reached up with a shaking hand. He almost couldn’t manage to hold himself on the other alone, and was a second away from collapsing back onto the floor, but luckily his fingers managed to grasp the edge of the cabinet desk, where Sirius’s gift stood in all its glossy purple glory.
“I lost control of my magic. Just exploded. Nothing really happened and Dumbledore’s working on teaching me how to control it.”
thanx for reading and feedback is appreciated :') <3 i do these for fun but it's always great to improve
It didn’t help just how pretty he was. Pale grey eyes, full pink lips, and perfect, unblemished skin. He was a fantasy made flesh. His white hair made him look timeless. Draco Malfoy had the beauty to defy age itself, and he’d possibly never look ugly in his life.
As he continued back to Draco, he proudly looked down at the fruits of his labour. He’d managed to arrange a colourful display of some of the things he’s seen Draco eat during his stay only two months ago - he wasn’t sure how picky the boy would be and wanted to play it safe. The tray was nearly at capacity with bowls of berries, oats, a plate of pancakes with syrup, decorated with plum slices, and even a lemon tart. The things on it were all a bit too sweet for Sirius’ liking, but he still couldn’t help but delight in the skill of his culinary magic.
Draco snorted and brushed off remnants of the cheap party display from his shirt, the silk-like fabric glided along the palms of his hands, texture as smooth as water. “Colour me impressed. Is there tea?”
“I do… I really do.” Draco said, heartbroken and feeling a little nauseous. He had almost been in a very similar situation, considering his odds bonding with Sirius Black, who was his second-cousin and twice his age. He needed to know more. “So why do you reckon it’s like this?” Why did all their magic come out of them like a burst damn? Why was it so difficult to control?
Draco stared at it gravely for a few a seconds, but couldn’t say a response in time as Potter walked in with Eleanor, Romilda, and Augustus. In the corner of his eye Draco could see her quickly roll her sleeve back down and press her arms together by her side, flustered and embarrassed in the presence of the Alpha. Potter only tipped Draco with an acknowledging nod, not quite over his resentment from two days ago.
It was a group of first years just coming out of the Great Hall, probably having just finished breakfast early, and from the group of five Draco could immediately detect the Omega out of them. He was the smallest boy in the back, with tanned skin and golden hair. Draco deduced that he might have been in Hufflepuff as his friends proudly paraded around wearing the house insignia on their school assigned bed-robes.
He wasn’t even given the chance to say goodbye to his friends or collect any homework he may be assigned for the week.
Draco dragged out a sigh.
Sirius understood responsibilities. He understood the role he played when Dumbledore had him sent to Azkaban for twelve years.
Draco let his head fall against the cold floor, allowing himself to feel drained and limp as his transfiguration professor undid the bond keeping his hands glued to his face.
As the Dark Lord continued to say nothing and only observe the starry horizon, Belatrix decided to wandlessly shoot flames from her fingers into the fireplace nearby, and a log-less flame suddenly consumed the hollowed out space, satisfied with her work she took a step back and waited.
Draco did, he dug his fingers into his robe’s inside pocket for his wand. Once out, he rested the tip of it against crumpled page. “I solemnly swear… That I am up to no good.”
“Draco…” It says in a strange, growling voice. It was so familiar.
He decided not to say anything else to avoid encouraging Sirius from coming back inside with the others.
Even in the dim midnight light, he could distinguish the silhouettes of Headmaster Dumbledore, Filch, Professor Snape, Professor McGonagall, and the oaf of a groundskeeper Hagrid along the perimeter of the destruction. Draco couldn’t really make out their faces but he could easily toss a guess to say they were perplexed.
watched in amazement at the performance. Draco felt a pull to look away, and turned, surprised to see Lucia staring sadly at him.
He cursed Dumbledore, and his parents, and Harry, and every Alpha on this damned, hellish planet.
Harry squeezed his bicep tightly, keeping his arms crossed.
If you had asked the question a week ago, the answer may have possibly still been the same. But now, looking up at the crestfallen boy before him, his real answer would be riddled with complicated and non-committed excuses.
that is? Fuck!” The tears had dried and he was getting angry now. “I think I understand why I have to, and why it’s important. But I need
omg!!! i cant believe it! another chapter! although this ones a littttle shorter.
…He still couldn’t get it in.
“I saw what the council had done with the Great Hall, it’s wonderful. The ball will surely be a great success, and a night we will all remember. Thank you to you both. Draco,” Dumbledore turned to him with a warm, benevolent smile, “how did you find the volunteer work?”
points to the first reader to guess where the hex girls are from ;))))
The Omega hadn’t even said goodbye. And he was going to be spending the week with an unbonded, unpredicatble Alpha like Sirius while his own self-restraint was already at its most compromised. It was a terrible idea, and Harry was absolutely furious…
Eventually, the sounds quietened, or Sirius fell asleep again, he wasn’t exactly sure which came first but he woke up stiff and propped up against the door. He realised he was still pretzeled on the stool and that it was Draco’s weary voice calling his name that woke him up.
He was really crying now - his body uncontrollably shuddered at each sob.
- they were all the memories that caused Draco the most suffering, which fuelled his supernatural power.
The Slytherin students weren’t as passé as people liked to think.
Draco still couldn’t say a thing, and was grateful that the man returned the hug for a few blissful seconds.
“Yes, whatever. Can you tell me anything or am I wasting my time?” If this didn’t work out he fortunately had another plan in his cards, but he’d rather the ghost tell him now so he didn’t have to spend much longer in this dirty, abandoned bathroom than he had to.
He felt like everything he'd done was now all for nothing.
“Oh, sweet thing, I like being corrupted,” she purred back.
Sweat built up at an alarming rate over his flushed skin and he worked hastily to lift his thigh higher, then positioning the toy lower until the head was pressed against the skin at his slit. A shiver rushed through him at the sensation of cold rubber meeting delicate wet flesh.
Three songs in, and Draco was feeling a little warm around the collar, already eager to escape the tight crowd. His friends payed him no mind as he slipped away.
? Do you want to be or not?”
The Slytherin was hoping the Gryffindor boy wouldn’t ask, but it wasn’t like he was surprised either.
. He began to let out a long, triumphant chuckle - it was soft, and almost a sigh in nature, like it was made out of the wind that froze Hell over.
Sirius decided he needed to treat this boy to something nice, as a reward for his bravery, or maybe as an apology for all the crappy bullshit he’d put the other through.
“I don’t know what else to think about…” Draco said helplessly.
This needed to stop right now or he was going to explode. That unstoppable sensation of magic was making its appearance and was rippling through him like an oncoming wave, like it was sending a warning. Like it was asking Draco if it could emerge.
“All you need to do is go through the steps as you two had done before, we’ll make sure things are comfortable for you.” Dumbledore said, smiling and looking pleased with the lack of pushback.
’ with dark coordinating colours and fearsome-looking versions of the symbolic animals. For all intents and purposes, it was a Halloween party, and a very charismatically thrown-together one at that, thank you very much.
“Ok. Wait a tic.”
Draco was upstairs asleep, tuckered out, finally giving in to the weariness that weighed on him half an hour ago. Downstairs, the grandfather clock revealed it was only a quarter to nine, and Sirius was now settling into his chair for his final report of the day’s events to Dumbledore.
“Listen to me right now. Stop.” The warning rumble of a powerful Alpha emerged from that bulging, stubbled throat.
She laughed and shook her head. “No, sorry. My dad made this for me. He’s very protective.”
“But he declined.” He said, sarcastically self-pitying. “It’s not you, if you’ve been wondering what the hell is keeping you out of his pants. If I’m going to be honest I think he’s warming up to you. Pansy’s told me enough of the things her and Draco talk about involving you. He just wants to be treated like a normal person. Now the real reason why I’m here…” Zabini leant in, lowly growling to match his rival under his breath. The two Alphas shared a tense moment where no one spoke, and the growls were rumbling in their chests like a pair of lions squaring off territory.
“Oh little bird,” The voice growled, the same sound that haunted his deepest, darkest nightmares. “Where are you?”
The house elf had cued its departure with another Disapparation crack, it didn’t say goodbye, probably feeling overwhelmed by the hostility between the three humans.
“I…Yes.” Harry had to take responsibility. For himself and for Draco, if this was to save everyone. “Anything.”
“Feels like it’s been hours,” Draco groaned with his eyes shut, Pansy combed out a knot forming in his hair. “Maybe I should mutinise? I’d be a great Headmaster.”
anyway the ball is rolling!!! i reckon this story will complete in 5 more chapters :^) let me know which has been your absolute fav chapter so far, would love to know <3
“Yes, now do me a favour and hold your breath whenever we’re in the same room. Hopefully next time I see you you’ve died.”
The engine ran on magic, it made him capable of anything. If Sirius wanted to he could go up to speeds that surpassed the human eye, he could fly higher than any Muggle aircraft. He felt invincible on it.
The blond Omega herself dumped a tall stack of tabloid issues into Draco’s unsuspecting arms as soon as he met up at their agreed spot, on the fifth floor just outside Ravenclaw common room after their last class.
Draco felt the hand of Sirius on the small of his back, pushing him onto the train. It was once again very early in the morning, and platform 9¾ was completely empty.
Pansy interrupted his surveillance by appearing at his shoulder and putting a goblet of punch into his hand.
“It’s a muggle saying.”
“Oh - fuck… Oh!” He mumbled deliriously to himself, eyes rolling back. He tossed his head back and forth as if he was destined for the insane asylum, damp platinum hair was swinging against his forehead and eyes. “
No one said a word for a long time, not even Gryffindor’s beloved social demonstrator. There was only a tense silence until the dismissal bell rang softly. Snape used the opportunity to collect his things and leave the room in one sweeping motion.
. He should have known it wouldn’t have lasted long. He regretted not asking more questions, but it was hard to when Snape was hellbent on belittling Draco in every way possible. It was unfortunate that the man was an absolute cunt -
Draco laughed, the sound surprising himself. It relaxed the tension in his body and he sidestepped around the Alpha looming too close into his space, he refused to acknowledge the impish smile growing across the other’s face, instead eager to continue on down the hall until he reached the Great Hall.
Draco stiffened, his face was angry. “Why?”
hi fellas! sorry for this update taking so long. been really busy! i havent really had any chance to draw either so i might come back to this later and add a drawing or two. unsure of what i want to illustrate tho so thatll be fun to choose.
Draco caught it with his left hand, the hand that was only moments ago in his dreams torn to a bloody stump.
“Okay - I get it. You don’t have to explain anymore. Hey - hey c’mere…” Harry pulled him into a hug as soon as Draco started to hiccup and let out a new sob, it was so tight Draco couldn’t move a muscle. He was so confused, normally he wouldn’t care. This was so unlike him, but ever since presenting, his emotions had been all over the place, and even now he was struggling to reel back the never-ending overflow.
“The audacity,” said Draco, appalled. And
“I don’t know. I guess I’m just…” He picked at a piece of croissant. A dark blond eyebrow was quirked down and he had on a contemplative pout.
His magic would occur during unusual times, like he could control it, or even more questionably it wouldn’t appear at all during times it was expected to most.
The memories were one coagulated mess, the timelines scrambled and her feelings misplaced.
Her heart clenched painfully at his words, she wished her loyalty was enough.
—Harry pulled away after reading a couple of sentences, he’d mistakenly picked a random paragraph to start from. This was from the magazine Luna personally handed to him on the train (
Neither of them were offered a lemon drop.
The man took every opportunity to blatantly mock and snap out a mean remark. If it looked like Draco was distracted and lost in thought, he’d magic his class-books to the floor, ordering the boy to pick it up. Snape would ask him the harder questions that took him longer than a second to answer -
She hummed. “Do you know when it’s supposed start?”
“Maybe…Maybe. But you have to give me something in return. Something I would
Harry was currently in his 8th and final year at Hogwarts. Hermione had dragged both him and Ron with her in order for them to properly complete their Wizarding education and gain their NEWTS. Harry didn’t regret returning though since this year was where  inter-house unity was firmly promoted and encouraged by all the staff- especially from one stern Headmistress McGonagall.
Teddy raised both arms in the air. “Me!”
Draco rolled his eyes but he had a smile on his lips, and a bit of red tinted his cheekbones. “Figures. Well, it’s not like I’m unaccustomed to your constant staring problem anyway. And you’re the only one I feel comfortable around so I guess it’s more of a benefit that I don’t need to always leave the room in order to go.”
BRRRRAAAPPPP!
Draco just shrugged. "I don't want my clothes to get dirty and this feels like a messy one." He merely explained before he turned his body towards the bush and immediately started to piss.
Shaking his head, Harry looked to his right, unable to stop himself from smiling- not that he wanted to- as he stared at his blonde partner who was still snuggled in their blankets beside him.
So the night before their trip, Harry got everything ready- setting up the campsite and making sure everything was in order. He casted a spell so everything would be still be in place and ready for when he brought his boyfriend.
Draco sighed, knowing what his significant other was dying to ask. He knew the other had been strangely quiet and distracted after their class. “Be glad I love you and am willing to humor you. But, yes. I usually do my business the traditional wizarding way.”
The khaki pants began to bulge out, trying to accommodate the ‘butt baby’ that was making its home in it.
“Why?” Harry finally asked him.
Harry didn’t understand why he couldn’t stop thinking about what had happened. Even as he stared up at the ceiling, all Harry could see were pants bulging from fecal matter and he swore he could hear all the pops and splatters that accompanied it.
Then Harry had burst out laughing and Draco wanted to die right then and there.
Luckily, Harry and Draco shared a room, together with Terry Boot and Ernie Macmillan. The couple would alternate between both their beds but Draco’s had silk bedsheets so they slept there more often.
Harry yawned and he blearily blinked awake. He absently reached for his glasses that was on the side table and put them on.
Hermione rolled her own eyes at him before answering him. “Muggle plumbing was invented around the 18th century. Before then, witches and wizards simply relieved themselves in public, and then vanished the evidence. Presumably this also explains the designs of the long, sweeping robes sorcerers usually wear, which would potentially be useful for keeping their excretions secret. There was a bit of a worry for young children getting the spell wrong and not quite managing to make everything disappear- I supposed that this was their way of ‘potty training’.”
When a hissing fart came out of the blond’s bum, making the little boy giggle once more, Draco held up his hand, making sure Teddy was paying attention, and with a circular flick of his wrist and a slight twitch of his fingers, he called out, “Quietus.” Suddenly the hissing sound was cut off and Teddy gasped.
They enjoyed each other’s embrace for a few more minutes before Harry felt another, much larger vibrating on his lap and actually heard the barking *BRRRRRAAAPPP!* burping out from his lover’s arse this time.
Pfffffffftttttttttt!
“What?!” He exclaimed in shock.
They all enjoyed the spaghetti bolognese that Harry cooked, Teddy especially loving the cheesy garlic bread.
Also his lover was adamant on never relieving himself on their furniture- he insisted that cleaning spells just wasn’t as effective on furniture and he did not want to deal with cleaning the mess in the Muggle way.
Harry sighed. “Well, back to the topic. I think your way was best- we’ll teach him by example, me the Muggle way and you the Wizarding way?”
Draco gave him a soft look as he leaned forward to capture the other’s lips in a soft peck. “Shall we have lunch first?”
Any doubts that had lingered inside was now replaced by joy and love in Draco’s expression and he gripped Harry close to him, resting his forehead against the other’s as they both let out a sigh of content.
“Harry…” for once Draco was speechless.
“Ok, shut up now. I have a staring problem, I got it.” Harry fumed, his face as red as a tomato.
Harry nodded as he bit his lip worriedly. Draco caught it and asked what was wrong, but Harry shook his head to wave off the other’s concern.
Harry looked up in surprise as he saw his lover turn around and lower his pants even more. Before he knew it, a fart came out, followed by what he could see was a log slowly coming out of the other’s hole.
If it was up to Harry, he would have adopted Teddy and they would both be living together right after the war. He loved the little boy and Andromeda was getting too old to take care of a 2-year old toddler anymore.
Suddenly he heard the bathroom door open and he heard his lover call his name, the sound of clothes falling to the floor.
Shushing the other, Draco continued to soothe his lover as they both found themselves standing in a puddle of piss.
Draco was quiet for a moment as he watched the other’s movements. He could tell that something was still bothering his boyfriend. “Okay, out with it- what’s wrong?” He asked suspiciously.
Especially when that someone was Harry Potter.
“Ah, wait. In order for us to be completely comfortable with one another, I should fart too!” He said.
Harry gave her a soft look as he stood up and walked towards them, casting cleaning charms on himself.
“You boys are right. I guess this old lady is just worrying over nothing again.” She gave her grandson a fond look before looking back at the other two.
“Honestly, Harry. I don’t know why you are surprised. Professor taught us this in first AND fourth year.”
“Ahhhh…” Teddy said, nodding in understanding.
Draco slapped his hand over his mouth, the other one going behind to cover his bum, face pink in complete mortification.
They would also make sure to cast a vow (that’s safe for children) so Teddy wouldn’t let slip of the minor details of their potty teachings to anyone.
“You are.” Draco now joined in, still holding his stomach as he kept himself from letting anything out. He was hoping to hurry along the explanation as he could feel the gates within his body about to open soon. “And so, Uncle Harry and I are going to show you how to go both ways.
“You’re not a freak.” Draco told him with an absolute tone in his voice. Harry felt a weight lift from his chest at those words.
“We we’re in the living room then. But I didn’t suppose you wanted to witness anything in our dining room, right after eating.” He pointed out, looking uncomfortable as more gas started to slip out unintentionally.
He never even peed in front of Draco before!
To Draco amazement, Harry had then let out a huge belch of his own.
Sighing, Harry got up from his seat and sat on his lover’s lap, rubbing the other’s arms to calm the still irate blond down. “Draco, you know that I’m already over whatever the Dursley’s put me through. I’m fine and I’ll never see them again.”
After a few more farts and plops into the toilet, Harry could feel that he was finally done.
As the toilet quieted again, Harry sighed- he really did not want anyone to see the ‘aftermath’ of his meals for any longer than necessary.
Harry joined the conversation then. “Great, so now you know the wizarding way. We can have you try out the spells yourself, alright?”
He didn’t feel disgusted.
Remembering Teddy, Harry said, “Teddy, when you’re sitting down doing your poo but find yourself needing to pee, just do what I’m doing now and-ahhh…just do this, okay?” His had finished urinating but he could feel his arse opening to let another shot of liquid feces out.
“No, god, no.” Sirius was still settling down, occasionally chuckling. “C’mere.” He started to gesture him over. “C’mere a sec.”
“So I’ve been told,” said Draco vaguely. “What are you going to tell me I should do?”
Draco nodded like he understood.
Before someone could rush in fast enough to grab a hold of Draco he was running forward, delighting in getting in a couple more punches. Potter gifted him the time to land four before he was holding Draco’s thinner forearms with his hands. The Omega wasn’t prepared for the jolt that came when his Alpha tugged him forward with a knee to his gut, he was launched upwards and flipped before crashing down onto the stone floors. Draco’s head was absolutely spinning. He couldn’t tell who’s voice was coming from who. So many people were screaming and shouting at him or for someone - or maybe they were trying to cast a spell. Possibly he was hexed? Everything just hurt so damn much.
Draco’s stomach clenched painfully and he was panting hard into his hands, still gripped tightly over his mouth.
Harry
“Can I trust you, Harry? Do you understand the lengths I am asking you to take? You’ll do this, won’t you?”
“About what?” Harry said slowly, he was still withdrawing from his head and returning to reality. Silver eyes blinked of existence.
After carelessly disposing the empty bottle on the floor, he climbed back onto the bed and curled his body around the sex toy in his arms - it was so thick and large it could pass off as a small prosthetic leg. He squeezed it into his chest for a pathetic attempt at comfort; its round head pressed into his tear stained cheek. He had no idea how he was going to use it, but he knew the Omega in him was yearning for it. His sex between his legs spasmed and clenched for something to fill it, and his cock lay hard and ready to explode against his leg. He’d long removed his pyjama bottoms, finding them useless when they’d be drenched with slick in under five minutes. Even now, on the spot he lay over the padded bed cover, was soaked through with the endless trickle coming out of him. He had to avoid moving too much, nauseated by the sounds of the squelching mattress.
Draco could only helplessly watch his kidnapping unfold, like he was experiencing an out-of-body lucid episode, as the werewolf’s enormous hands encased his arms and upper body before hoisting him up in the air. His heart skipped a few beats before he landed gracelessly on top of Fenrir’s broad shoulder, the exposed skin around his dirty tank top was so uncomfortably warm against the exposed skin on his belly where Draco’s half-tucked shirt rode up.
“What is it?” Draco had to ask, since Snape was now looking at him expectantly.
“We’ll put a pin in that for now. I gave you space today out of courtesy to you, Draco. Now you’re going to return the favour by explaining where the fuck you’ve been. Why were you taken away from me? Why couldn’t the Headmaster trust you to have your heat here, darling? Too good for a private room in Hogwarts?”
What could explain what was happening without opening the door and giving away his position? As a distraction, he tried to deduce it all using the clues given by Draco’s scents and sounds.
He needed to back track now.
“Quibbler,” Draco groaned, rubbing the obvious headache out of his eyes with his free fingers. “I never finished reading it. I was too pissed and can’t remember what even half of it said.”
She nodded understandingly. “I’m sorry.”
“Yes…” Blaise sat down at the foot of the bed, respectfully keeping his distance but maintaining his intense eye contact. Their silhouettes were lit by the glow of the lake coming through the windows, beside them kelp brushed against the glass, and a school of fish hurried past. He wanted to make this meeting quick. “I think it would be beneficial for the both of us if you were to bond to me instead of Potter.”
The walk was brisk and quiet, it didn’t feel like the right time for Draco to bring up what was on his mind involving the older man. Snape himself was pretending as if it never happened, he hadn’t mentioned it once, and that suited Draco more than it didn’t.
“Did she have you promise her?” Those pale eyes slipped down to Severus’s hidden palms. Severus could imagine what he must be thinking: a blood pact.
Song lyric credit:
That’ll do it. Darkness was swimming around the edges of his vision, all he could see now was Potter still staring down at him.
“You might not know much about me, there’s not much you need to know. I’m here to pass on my advise, if you’ll take it.”
They continued on down the hall in silence for a little bit longer, Draco walking with his hands clasped behind his back, Harry with his hands stuck inside the pockets of his robes.
“You heard the man,” Fenrir said to Draco, still chuckling. “I have to bring you back alive. C’mere, pet.”
as promised! a follow up chapter shortly after! i'll be adding drawings in for these last two chapters soon (just coming up with scenes id like to redraw so if you have suggestions i'll hear em out ;) )
His Father would’ve had an aneurism if he could see Draco now.
It seemed like it was only a matter of time before he was going to eventually be ripped away from the man.
The day went by easily enough, in fact from morning until the mid afternoon things were unusually pleasant.
“If I’m desperate enough, bloody well maybe.”
“Fuuuck you,” Draco found himself gurgling, it didn’t sound like his voice. “You punch like you have…No hands. Cock-scar.”
She quickly looked away.
Classes have started, and Draco was Hung Over. With a capital H and a capital O.
“No.” Draco managed out, panicked. “Don’t come inside…”
“Yes, Master Black. Kreacher does as he is told.”
The Alpha swung in for a bicep-bulging bear hug, crushing a pop out of Draco’s spine somewhere. Draco stuttered but didn’t push himself free, he couldn’t quite believe what was happening and stood there frozen in place.
Sirius couldn’t help the laugh escaping him at the absurdity of the thought, and decided to ask the question for the hell of it.
It might have been a trick of the light, but Harry was beginning to make out glowing silver eyes inside the burning embers of the fire. Harry’s face and neck was heating up from the proximity
glittering as they moved in the iridescent lights. “Hit it sisters…”
I’m pretty scared, if I’m going to be honest.”
The rain that came over the Malfoy estate felt like a mood mourning, anticipating a loss;
Her skin still tingled from the remnants of the Crucio curse and Narcissa couldn’t help the full-bodied shiver coursing through her. She couldn’t remember who struck her with it first, if it was the Dark Lord himself, or her sister, or another servant. She remembered how terrible it was, and how loud her screams sounded in her ears. It was like her blood was boiling inside, while a current of first-degree electricity ran through her nervous system. It felt endless, like an eternal, time-capsulated Hell on Earth.
“I…I’m not…”
against his own chest, Draco attempted to tug it free but Sirius only squeezed harder in response. Before Draco could even yelp Sirius’ face went hard and Draco froze, he braced for something. It was a new reflex his body had learnt. He waited for the smack, a shout, maybe Sirius would make good on that threat of pushing him off the roof. He nearly let his eyes slip shut but as soon as they started to lower a laugh was bubbling out of Sirius. It started as a soft chuckle but was quickly picking up momentum and swelled to be a lively roar of laughter.
Everything’s like some bloody soap opera with you.” His Alpha temper was rising and he rubbed his black hair in frustration.
“Trust me, it’ll be different this time… Sit on the front.”
Potter’s scent filled his nose in under a second. Wood. Ink. Sweat. The smell of his cotton red t-shirt. The denim of his jeans. The lavender shampoo he must have used this morning, it was so fresh.
“Grab your coat. I’m taking you out for a drive.”
“A medieval knight” Harry grinned. “Could do with a princess, though.”
“Excuse me?”
Pansy picked one up and held up the cover:
The bastard was grinning awkwardly at the dramatic display, clearly uncomfortable but also not unaccustomed to the level of grovelling. “Nice to meet you too…Uh - Niffler, was it?”
The corridor filled with the smell of honey, and Harry had to swallow a couple of times to clear away the water in his mouth.
A grunt escaped his lips and he let his frustrations control his actions. He rocked on the toy like he was a fearsome animal, hoping his wildness would result in gouging the thing deeper inside him.
” He nudged her shoulder, careful to avoid the dangling goat head attached to her neck. “If you’re so worried just don’t have any, or do, and enjoy the night. Either way don’t care so much.
Potter slowly trodded his way down the stairs until he was towering a head over Draco, who stood his ground with every muscle taught and strung under his clothes, his chin jutted up like a weapon. They stared at each other haughtily for ages until Harry finally faltered. His big green eyes glowed in the reflection of his glasses, and his tan skin looked flushed by the blood obviously rushing to fill his head.
Draco pointed to her necklace. “You don’t suppose I can have one of those?”
Harry winced, he’d known for a long time that things were gravely wrong, and that this war would not be easy to take on, after many nights alone to suffer in his nightmares, shared visions from Voldemort himself, of Nagini, and sometimes others.
“Now, now. Draco, you don’t need to— ”
“What in Morgana’s good grace is going on? What are you boys doing?” It was McGonagall. She had shoved the door into the spare classroom open, rushing in. Somehow Draco’s magic could sense the cavalry coming to save him and slowly retreated; the colour, the sparks, and miraculous, inexplicable physical warping of magic all came back to soak into his shivering, sweaty skin.
edit: i did it and now appreciate the *smoulder*
“Pah - she absolutely wreaks.” Said Blaise, covering his nose with a hand.
“Get rid of them,
“I’m so, so sorry, Draco… It’s… This is important. It has to be this way or you’ll get worse. You can’t control it, you know you can’t. There’s no way you can fix it. I had to tell him what you were going to do…” Lucia was crying now, holding herself tightly as she did. Each tear was the size of a small coin, rolling clear down her freckled face to drop in rapid succession from her chin.
He was far straighter to the point than Draco was expecting, it made things very uncomfortable to talk about with Potter and McGonagall as his audience.
“I thought he was filled in?” Draco said incredulously.
“I - er - I’m not quite so sure…” Harry let out. He felt so stupid, why was speaking suddenly so difficult.
“Sweet creature, there you are. I knew it was you.”
“Can’t you focus, Draco? Pity you didn’t inherit the Alpha wit I expected you to. I won’t hesitate to deduct points from Slytherin if I catch you wasting my time again with your laziness.”
Potter looked disappointed and Draco wasn’t sure why. Wasn’t he relieved that Draco didn’t want to hex him into furniture?
Draco muttered out an apology and shook his head for clarity. Get it together. He cast a freshening charm on his inkpot and attempted to start the sketch.
Blaise continued, “I mean, you haven’t bonded completely, have you? People can smell it, even I can. That’s why it’s so easy for people to hit on you like they have all day. You and Potter didn’t do it right.”
“See?”
Liked seeing the incredible power observably drain from his small, quaking body.
“Just seeing him…”
Finally after what felt like an excruciatingly long time, Sirius slowed his pace and peeled into a nearby road. Once stopped, Draco ripped off his helmet and stumbled away by unhooking a leg and hopping a couple of steps back, but once standing his legs betrayed him with a slight tremble and he realised he needed to brace himself against the motorbike for a few seconds longer until he recovered his bearings. He also now noticed how his fingers, which were pale blue and still slightly hooked at the joints, looked like a corpse after Rigor mortis set in…The site was unsettling to say the least. As he made a show of not looking like the trip had been too much for him, Draco looked up in time to see Sirius shake off his own helmet into his awaiting gloved hands, that inky black hair was slightly damp from sweat and had formed multiple tangled ringlets. The man only spared Draco a quick smile before snapping his fingers, the motorbike and both their helmets blinked out of existence, then he made his way to the magically revealed door of Grimmauld Place.
also i hope u can tell when i try to b funny... im trying 🥺
“Where’s Draco?” Harry grit out, nursing a deep gouge at his shoulder, the blood was quickly - possibly too quickly - weeping through his fingers. He refused to look at the wound, in case it was much worse than what he first brushed off,
The Dark Lord was there waiting for them, along with Yaxley, who was nearby a shelf ripping its books to pieces. Bellatrix could only stare at her master’s bald head as he faced away from her, over-seeing the windowed balcony with his hands behind his back.
Draco still didn’t meet Potter’s bright green eyes, afraid of what he would see. If only Draco could post-pone this conversation to the near date of never.
“You’re talking about what happened outside of the school.”
The only signs of life were Draco, Sirius, and the Hogwarts house elf, Niffler, who was summoned again to get his luggage on and off the train, then to march Draco back to Hogwarts Castle.
Draco looked down at her, her breath wreaked of whiskey and her lipstick was smeared across one cheek.
“And what was it like?” He asked again, seriously.
The longer he stood there thinking, the more the magic rumbled in his ears, like it was yawning and waking up, ready to destroy everything in its path. It had no outlet, no reason to be channeled, it was an unleashed, unstoppable -
At some point late into the night, Draco had managed to slip out of bed. He stumbled and collapsed onto his belly on the floor, and the freezing wooden boards against his exposed, sweaty skin made him scream suddenly. It shocked his system and he scrambled to his knees and hands -  he spared a glance at the door, to see if Sirius was still outside. No one knocked, or called out to him to see if he was okay, so he must have been alone.
“Because I want to control it. I don’t want to be afraid of my magic, that’s not what you taught me.” His eyes were glowing silver-gold in the candlelight. “That’s not what my house or this school has taught me.”
A flash back of the Boggart came into mind, the booming laugh had frightened him to the core — but now, as the Werewolf before him opened his wet mouth, he realised it had the potential to be much
. The heat is necessary after all, which you yourself had eventually experienced with your ex-mate. So any severe health side-effects to Harry, similar to your own bond during your time with us at Hogwarts, is not exactly a concern, Sirius.”
It came from outside, some kind of explosion.
“What? When did he do that?” Sirius made sure to check the door, he strained to hear for any signs of the boy, and heard nothing. His hearing was never wrong, so he relaxed a fraction, but not much.
“Fenrir, do you believe you have what it takes this time?” The silence came back with a hush.
The bedroom Draco found his luggage in was a far cry from the bright and modern design of his own. Its sitting furniture had dark, bog-green upholstery with black and silver thread designs unlike the powder blues and white he remembered in the Manor. The bed was smaller than his own with a canopy so black it reminded him of a funeral veil.
“Never-mind, you’re right. Let’s keep going.”
Then a pop went off as the pygmy puff’s head burst open into a cloud of stuffing. Draco let go and it fell into a heap of pink fuzz and white internal stuffing.
“I haven’t thought much about it… I might just get Pansy to come up with something for the both of us.”
“I choose to be here. I’d prefer to be here than with someone I’m not ready to give my body to. That wouldn’t be my choice. That wouldn’t make me free.”
Severus took, impossibly, another step. He was too close now, by this point he could taste the proximity: a mouth-watering honey.
“Well…Yeah? I fucked your brains out, mate, least I can do is take you out to a dance.” Draco punched him in the arm ( - Merlin, it was so
“I’m going to have to,” Draco shrugged. “I’m not really being given much of a choice.”
Draco scowled up at him, offended, clearly Severus had pinched a nerve. “I cracked open a boy’s head without touching him.”
Also stop lying to yourself.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco took them gingerly, and as soon as they parted from the Alpha’s hand he whipped around and stomped towards the direction of the Gryffindor towers.
“Oh…” He whimpered out. As he arched his back and tilted his neck to the side, a drop of drool escaped and it dribbled across his cheek, disappearing into the pillow.
He took a chance and went for a door, it was an empty classroom. He took a sweeping turn and collapsed down the wall nearby the door.
To silence all the voices telling him he couldn’t get away with this on his own…
“Yes, exactly!”
“—He’s good, Draco. He cares about us, he knows what’s best for everyone. Even you Draco. Even if your family…” He wisely didn’t finish that sentence. Instead he distracted the conversation by pretending to scratch an itch on his face, the sound his nails made against the youthful stubble on his cheek was soothing, the Alpha seemed to be chewing on his next words a little more carefully this time. “Like I said, I don’t want to fight anymore, feels like I’m getting too old for it. Like we both are. And god why would I want to lose the chance to be with someone as fit as you. And I know you need help, I want to help you. To save your family - ”
The man couldn’t help the snort that escaped him at that.
,” Pansy yawned into her pawed hand, the other directed towards the Alpha with her claws extended. “I look good.”
As for Lucius… Lucius was being kept in one of the guest rooms. She knew only because she was still given quite liberal freedoms, which included numerous access to areas of the Manor. She recalled seeing him slumped on the bed, gaze vacant, at least he seemed free of recalling the horrors.
He decided it was best if he just tried the Owlery again.
Nothing but the time the train was meant to depart - 4:30AM - and from personal experience, how long the train typically took to get back to London - 3 hours.
The sun wasn’t out yet but a pale blue ray of twilight lined the horizon, promising its appearance in an hour, the stars were still glittering in by the thousands up in the ink black sky directly above them.
. It was like he was missing something he never quite noticed until it was gone, and its absence was distressingly missed - like the warmth of the sun he has paid no mind to suddenly went cold, like the white-noise in his head was switched off.
“What are you going as, then?” Draco prodded, lids lowered as he curiously observed the Alpha towering beside him.
The years of antagonism between Harry and Draco since their fateful meeting in the uniform shop had made what was supposed to be a simple courting ritual between an Alpha and his Omega feel like one long and drawn out war. But despite everything, like some sort of masochist, the more Draco acted like he wasn’t interested the more Harry wanted him. He was so conflicted - was this wrong? To want a boy who so very obviously didn’t want Harry back? He felt so desperate he was just about ready to start flipping through the Half-blood Prince’s book to find notes on the perfect Alpha scent cream - it wouldn’t be the first time it saved his skin - a flash of crimson red and the spell ’
If only he’d brought a book, he was going to have a tough time having no one to talk to for the train ride.
“Hey…” He cleared his throat of phlegm and rubbed the crusts of sleep out of his eyes. His back ached something fierce and he popped a particularly stubborn creak in his neck, “How’s it ‘goin?”
Draco’s face blushed a tiny bit, it was hard not to be pleased with the attention.
only been Potter, Romilda, Augustus, and Draco left working on spells together to fuse concepts from their perspective roles. Lucia was the first to go, which was unusual for her, and Eleanor left shortly after.
Draco froze as he suddenly understood what was going on.
“That’s just the nature of the act itself.” Draco pointed out to him gently.
The abs on the others stomach tightened as a burst of flatulence blasted out, popping through the quiet air around them.
He yawned as he stared at the ceiling, blinking sleepily as he slowly woke up from his slumber.
“And that lake here is also connected to a stream which runs up to this area- so we can bathe in its refreshing waters later. Oh, and also…” Harry tugged the other’s hand and pointed to an area that he had also set up.
Harry flushed but instead of saying ‘no’ like he immediately wanted to, he instead gritted his teeth and opened his legs slightly to revealed the mess beneath him.
Harry shook his head, giving out another laugh. “No aplogizes, love. When nature calls, gotta answer it.”
Lifting his other hand, he cupped Harry’s face so that the other looked directly at him. “Harry, when was the last time you defecated?”
Draco shook his head. “Mother would be the only other person, but that was only until I was five. From then on, I always did my business discreetly or just left the room altogether. In my older years, I never go in front of anyone like I do with you.”
When Draco felt his stomach give a familiar grumble as it dropped down to his bottom, he knew it was time to start Teddy’s training.
But now, Harry stared at the pants not because he was admiring his lover’s arse. Instead he stared as urine streamed down, leaving dark trails down the pants before making a good size puddle on the floor, surrounding Draco’s bare feet.
Harry furrowed his eyebrows. “Why? I mean, why bother leaving the room? You never did that yesterday?” He questioned.
He watched as Draco shuffled slightly away from him and the couch, just about maybe 2-3 feet away and shifted his body so Harry saw him from the side, couldn’t really see the blonde’s face but had a good view of his behind.
Draco looked at how happy Harry looked and finally he could feel his own lips lifting up to a small smile. “I supposed so.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “I know you didn’t wipe yourself properly. And I will not have you bathing in the same tub as Teddy and I without being properly wiped. Now scoot up, Potter. It’s not like I haven’t been acquainted with any of this before.” He gave a sneer, but his eyes were twinkling.
Crunching on one of his crisps, Harry heard a short burp coming out from the other.
But most importantly- Magic.
So after finally getting Draco to agree, Harry chose the best campsite for them to stay at for one day and one night. Then they would leave the next morning.
Draco hesitated a long time, but finally mustered the courage to step forward, close enough for Sirius to grab at his arm and pull him over the engine cavity. Draco instinctually swung his leg over, like it were a broom, and shared the space on the seat. It only took a second for him to regain his backbone when he grabbed a hold of the leather handles without being instructed to. Draco jumped back in surprise when Sirius settled his own larger gloved hands around them, gripping tightly. He rotated both their wrists downwards until the motorbike roared to life and whirred loudly in response to each twist of the handles.
the Omega was staring down at his plate, his snow white hair stood out like a beacon against all the black, brown, and deep green that surrounded him. Even from one end of the Great Hall Harry could make out that sweet blush marbling his pale skin - it was no mistaking it, since the whole hall was buzzing with gossip about Head Master Dumbledore’s announcement. Although, it was a little hard to tell but it seemed the Slytherin table was solemnly quiet about the whole ordeal.
But it was a shame he couldn’t really fully shake himself free from it.
“That’s great news.” Dumbledore looked agitated, and very tired, despite the earliness of the night.
“Okay, Luna.”
“What are you doing…“ Draco started, but he let his words trail off as his attention centred in on the folded up map in his Alpha’s hand. “…Ah.”
,” Harry said again, coming closer. The intimidation, the power, the allure, what ever it was seemed to be working, and slowly it quelled the Omega’s rage.
Draco stared at him for what felt like a very long time, Blaise carefully kept an ear out for intruders to give the other boy time to think. He didn’t understand the wait, he felt like he had surely explained things clearly enough for the other Slytherin, it was an undeniable win for everyone. Blaise wasn’t prepared for the puff of a laugh, and despite a shadow hiding most of the blond’s face you couldn’t mistake the smirk. “So who would you choose to be with if not with little me? I don’t suppose you have a thing for Pansy, do you?”
“Wait! Do you want me to go out while you…” he trailed off as he looked away, wondering if he should wait in the kitchen or maybe their bedroom.
And just like that, the entire fecal and urine mess was gone.
He was sure his words were only half comprehensible, as he spoke the words through his crying, but he knew that the blond understood him.
“We think that because you’re starting to becoming such a big boy now, it would be time for you to learn some big boy things.” Harry explained to him.
Draco actually blushed at this, but before he could say anything, his grey eyes widened as piss started to quickly come out involuntarily.
Harry confusedly watched as the other gave another yawn, eyes half-hooded, as the blonde sat up from the bed.
Draco looked at him shocked. Did his boyfriend just…?
Thankfully, the bowl showed mainly tissues that were slightly stained- but nothing too explicit.
Victoire loved her Uncle Harry’s warm bear hugs, his homemade desserts and his jokes that always made her laugh till her tummy hurt.
No, what was on Harry’s mind was the scene of Draco soiling himself right in front of Harry, completely and abashedly.
His bathroom habits were usually pretty regular. He would poop at least once every other day, maybe twice depending. But since their toilet was still out of commission and due to his poo-shyness, Harry was just unable to go.
Draco saw Harry looking at him with a completely mindblown expression before turning into a very wide, toothy grin.
“Ughhh…why I let you take me to that Indian restaurant, I’ll never know.” Draco moaned, hugging himself to his lover, the close
It was now Draco’s turn to look confused now. “What’s silly about that?”
“If there’s something I learned during our Muggles Studies class and living with you, it’s that Muggles have strange, not wrong, but different customs than us wizards. They may not agree with the way most wizards, specifically Purebloods, expel their waste, but it’s only because they have no magic. If they did, I’m sure they would prefer to go the same way I do- it’s much less of a hassle than to sit on that hard, cold stone and having to fuss with all that tissue and ‘flushing’ nonsense.” The blonde made a face at that.
When the large bulge finally stopped growing, he heard Draco sigh, causing the bulge to shift down, making a nice brown seat at the bottom of Draco’s pants.
Harry laid on his back, one arm resting on his stomach as his other was caught underneath his lover, but comfortably so.
Brilliant, really.
With Draco’s job as an apprentice Potion master, he had many orders for his potions but he was able to do them all at home since Harry had made their basement into his own Potion’s lab.
Draco was still upset about not getting any of the exotic plants, but he brightened up when he bought the zoo’s gin and chocolate as his souvenir.
As the pair got into their bed for the night, Harry’s mind was on the the broken loo as he closed his eyes and fell asleep.
She had been in her playpen where the boys had left her, but she was able to open it (using accidental magic) and went to the loo.
Curtains closed, Silencio spell up and cuddling into his boyfriend, Harry finally asked, “So…about our conversation earlier during History…” he trailed off.
“That’s right. So next time, you know what not to do so this doesn’t happen again, okay?” Draco added, rubbing soothing circles on her back.
Harry coughed as his blushed a bit, the other raising an eyebrow at him. “Um…I probably might keep staring, actually. I-I don’t know how to explain it but, I can’t really look away when it happens. It’s…interesting? Sorry.” He said sheepishly.
And that was what was bothering Harry all along.
his life, Draco vanished the entire mess with a wordless and wandless Evanesco.
And it helped that his lover was one of the most powerful wizards in history and had a natural talent in wandless and wordless magic.
Harry casted a cleaning spell to make sure the little boy was spotless before helping Teddy from his seat and called out to his godson, who ran immediately to the living room, to be careful. Harry casted another spell to turn on the tv to the channel that Teddy loved.
Olefacio minuere was a spell that lessened smells until it just barely hit the nostrils. But the downfall was that if a new smell came in, then it would override the spell’s effects easily. So if one was having a bout of flatulence, the spell would need to be repeated after each air emission. But at least this spell prevented multiple smells to keep adding and become unbearable.
Draco pouted at him as he shrugged helplessly, giving out another wet, bubbly fart.
“Not even your mother?” Harry asked in surprise. He then remembered during Draco’s lesson on how he wondered why the blond never hide anything when he relieved himself in front of Harry.
Colored in soft ivory, the large tent stood tall at about 6”10 and could fit at least 8 people inside. With the flaps open, he was delighted to see an actual bed inside! With everything from puffy pillows and a comforter that just begged for one’s body to be wrapped in.
“Your burp-farts really are cute, love.” Harry laughed, winking as Draco blushed even more.
“Maybe it was something you ate today?” Draco guessed, giving him a sympathetic look. The smell in the room was downright dreadful. Harry was thankful when Draco casted Olefacio minuere to clear it up, even temporarily.
“No one else knows that I do it- it only happens when I’m very full and if I’m alone in private.” Draco whispered.
Harry blushed but Draco forced him to keep eye contact, refusing to let the other avoid this. “Harry.” He said warningly.
Putting the seat down, Harry shoved his pants and knickers down and sat down in a swift motion. He perked up at Draco.
Harry grinned as he finally understood. “Because I trust you to not judge me and am comfortable around you to show all my sides to you- the good, the bad, and the dirty.”
to go around, wasn’t just gonna give it all to Peter here.” Randal, , dressed as some sort of Western muggle cowboy, was clearly pissed out of his mind from a presumed generous helping of Eyeball Juice. Draco could smell alcohol vapour on his breath,
No half-measures, no half-bonds, no exceptions.
“Okay…”
Draco leaned back on the rim of the sink, it groaned a little at the weight. “What?”
But then it vanished.
“I’m being given until tomorrow to say who I’m going to let bugger me and make me theirs for… life, probably.” Back at Grimmauld Draco had naively assumed it may have only been until school ended, but now with the added issue of being an emotionally-triggered explosive it was likely going to be his reality until he eventually died - or until he ripped out the part of his brain that gave him emotions. A
“What is it?” Draco said suspiciously. You could see the exhaustion and curiosity swimming in his eyes, the left eye was still slightly reddened, it was taking longer to recover even after Madam Pomfrey’s help.
“Then why did you ask?” Draco graced him with a quick glance over his shoulder.
“You look after yourself, kiddo.” Sirius said with a grim look on his face, patting Draco’s shoulder. Draco was wearing a padded black pea coat, so it was impossible to enjoy the warmth of the older man’s calloused hand.
I want to try to see if I can handle this problem on my own, at least. I need to believe it’s possible. You’re a damned teacher!
) He couldn’t help the blush forming on his face... The article seemed a little shameless. Luna was a very, very -
to ever lay your hand on another student. You yourself would understand that no matter who you are… Omega, Alpha, or Beta, does not give anyone the freedom to inflict violence on another Wizard or Witch. You’ve embarrassed me and this whole school.”
Harry didn’t say anything, his mouth was open and his eyes were open wide with shock.
“I wanted to make an offer.”
Could Draco be… Was he… Using the toy? Sirius only left it there as a spiteful joke, never in his wildest dreams would he think Draco Bloody Malfoy would have it in him to attempt to sexually perform with a cock so big even the most experienced needed prep-time and foreplay before daring it.
Sirius’ didn’t look like he realised just how much his mouth was hanging open, he looked frozen in time, as if Draco was the single greatest miracle unknown to the rest of mankind.
The Dark Arts teacher lead Draco up all seven floors (eight including the dungeons) to the entrance of the spiralling staircase. The gargoyle stood there unmoving in their way.
“I only ask because it seems to have been helpful,” she looked back-and-forth between the two of them.
“What a relief that’s over. I’m never going to agree to go on that death-machine again.” Draco said after him breathlessly, quickly patting down his wild, static-charged hair.
“Like last time,” Draco said mostly to himself, despite still not taking his eyes off Harry’s, which were glowing with an unreal shade of green. He was half expecting the Harry to tilt his head like a puppy, or to pout in hurt-confusion, but this time the Alpha, his destined Alpha, was studying him with determination. Whatever was going on in that wild head of his, it seemed like he had come to terms with something, and he was destined to make Draco his. His hard eyes wordlessly vowed that things would be final.
“I can handle it by myself.” Draco tried to say confidently, but his mouth betrayed him and he only managed to whisper the words out.
can you also tell by now my favourite thing to write is draco running away from his problems?
The bedroom door opened as soon as he approached it and Sirius had to hold his breath, afraid of how his own body could react to the fresh heat pheromones contained inside.
Maybe the Slytherins could make their own student council? Served by Slytherins for Slytherins only? Draco smirked at the idea. They could have club themed uniforms, with a stylish robe lapel pin - perhaps snakes in silver over Hogwarts? With gems. Lots of gems. There would be a secret password and they’d hold all their meetings in the prefects bath house -
She just smiled at him again with that signature glazed-eye stare.
Everyone was now staring at him, and at some point the music had stopped.
“Alright then.”
“You would, the best.” Pansy placated him, her voice was like a dream.
Draco ran his fingers over the swell of Harry’s pectoral muscles, until they creeped up higher, around his large shoulders, until they clasped the sides of Harry’s neck.
He had just finished witnessing a memory - a painful memory from a long time ago. With his wand he scooped the silver strands out of the cauldron and into a glass vial, storing it away only to be seen again in another few years at least.
“Hmm…Yes, and I suppose I share many similarities to a Pygmy Puff. Skin, the ability to defecate. However, still, I’m not a weak, frilly, dulled creature that only cares about eating and being bred. Creatures like that belong away from schools and kept at home, nothing more than pretty, out-of-fashion pets.”
Harry slowly came to a stop and threw him a funny look, “I dunno? Probably was told all he needed to know from Sirius and just wanted to let you relax? Why?”
“We’ll split up, okay? That way we’ll cover more ground.” She said cheerily.
Severus could only tell her so much without compromising her position, the Dark Lord regularly would slip into her mind during meetings, turning over any memory and unchecked thought, prowling for evidence.
If Harry was clever he’d get it, and his glowing attitude was telling Draco he probably did.
