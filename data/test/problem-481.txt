"No." Draco growled and then proceeded to dramatically go through the process of lifting his knee back up, more rough this time.
"No! Papa! No Merpeople out of water!" Albus screamed over the sound of water filling up the porcelain tub. They were in Harry and Draco's ensuite. It was their favorite bathtub to use when they played 'Merpeople' because it was considerably large. Actually, it was probably bigger than Harry and Draco really
His right hand was drawn to his erect nipples, just like they were before Harry came in. The residue of lube trailed along his chest as he drew mindless circles over his skin. Draco puckered his lips and blew out cold air along his sternum. The air instantly clung onto the wet surface and his whole body reacted beautifully to the sensations.
It took a moment for Harry to register what Draco was referring to, but when he saw his struggling fingers clawing at his crotch, he brushed them aside and drew the zipper down with ease.
This morning was different, and for a minute he felt disoriented after his eyes absorbed the bright sunlight pouring into his dormitory through the tall windows. It was typical for him to wake up to the sunrise. Every morning he watched the beautiful view while perched against the window sill inside of his joint dormitory.
"Harry my boy, are you alright back there?" Harry glanced up at the sound of his name and realized every face in the room was on him.
The darkness of the hallway filled his senses and he sought out for the light switch stationed on the wall to his left. One stride forward and he was nearly toppling over Albus' stuffed pygmy puff that was carelessly abandoned on the floor. This action seemed to trigger a reaction from the end of the hallway.
"Yes, carrots Papa! Daddy's just like Santa's reindeer!" Albus' spoke through laughter. "Just like his
"Is that good, Professor?" Draco asked and his voice was music to Harry's ears. The hoarseness came from straining his throat as he attempted to hold back his stray whines.
"Just like Daddy is." Draco confirmed.
"Are you going to answer me?"
He lowered himself down onto Harry's knees and wriggled his bare arse over the newly exposed skin. The hair on Harry's legs stimulated his exposed bottom and he visibly trembled over the sensation. Draco flashed Harry a wide smile, unable to contain his excitement.
"It's fine." Harry finally spit out after a few seconds of regaining his composure. He began drawing careless swirls across his paper again, mentally thinking about scenarios that would initiate the flaccidity of his erection.
"What?" Harry hesitated and a familiar feeling of dread crept up his spine. It almost made him nauseous.
The boy was trying to balance a blue plastic cup on the top of his head, completely drowning out the conversation Albus was trying to hold. The cup tumbled down his backside and hit the water with a
"Bathroom, now." Draco demanded, pushing Harry's fist off of him, but Harry didn't budge.
Feeling Harry's intense gaze on his mouth, Draco consciously slid his own tongue against the soft surface of his bottom lip.
Draco began to pick up the pace, sloppily slurping the full length into the back of his throat and bobbing back up to swirl his tongue around Harry's slit.
"Nghh!"
to hear Draco say it.
He recalled.
As they stood in the ensuite, Harry ambled up behind Draco and enveloped his arms around Draco's waist, pulling him flush against his chest. Harry's lips instantly found their way to Draco's neck like a magnet and they quickly got to work by pressing quick kisses below his ear.
"Take off your knickers. I want a good look of that gorgeous prick." Harry instructed, still swirling the head of his cock with his thumb.
"I know so." Harry purred, a wicked grin splaying across his face. Draco whimpered at the sound of Harry's voice and his hands found their way behind his back, clasping together. "Come on. Lie back my beautiful boy. I want you to finger yourself for me, can you do that?"
"Holy fuck Draco. So fucking vulgar." Harry growled low in his throat. Draco let out a breathy laugh on top of his hand, the cool air hitting the wet surface and making his hair stand on end.
"I can get up myself, you know." Draco mumbled, not looking Harry in the eye.
"So pretty." Harry admired, noticing how Draco's cock curved inward toward his stomach. It jumped upon hearing Harry's praise and Harry ate up the delicious sight, taking note of his obvious excitement.
When he didn't get one, he panicked only for a moment before realizing that he wasn't being hexed into oblivion either. Noting that that was probably a good sign, he decided to push his luck even further.
Harry thought.
The dildo instantly got to work, seeking out Draco's entrance. If Draco wanted Harry inside him so badly, this would have to be the next best thing.
Draco bucked his hips into the touch, even more needy for release after a five minute denial. "Hurry, Harry. Gods, I might come in my trousers."
He could only hope no one would be using the utensil after him, considering his own precome would soon be smeared all over the handle.
He was caught and there was no getting himself out of the situation.
"I thought something was actually wrong." Harry retorted, feeling considerably less slumberous than he was moments ago.
"Oi!" Ron flailed his arms in search for something to ground himself before he fell and Hermione's shoulder was the lucky winner. He was soon able to stabilize himself, saving him from a trip to the stone cold floor.
It was something they never brought up. Never during the war, never after the war. They recognized that they were both severely damaged, but they would never dare initiate a conversation about it. It was vital for their relationship to be strong for one another. They were only living for each other.
"Princess Papa?" Harry raised a questioning eyebrow as he ruffled Scorpius' Curls with a towel.
When they found themselves in front of the master bedroom, they walked through the door frame hand in hand. Their whole house hunting journey had been an exciting process. It gave them a glimpse into their future. It made everything feel more
"It's all yours, my love." Harry ran his fingers through Draco's hair and rested his hand on top of his head, as if to guide him.
time. I did tell you when I came in to not let me interrupt you, didn't I?" It took everything in Harry to
"Wha…" Draco replied breathlessly with his eye lids half shut. He subconsciously swiveled his hips to move his swollen prick against his slick fist.
"Now want to tell me why the hell I found you in the tub?" Harry questioned, suppressing a laugh.
and smiled innocently up at Harry before reaching out and taking the shaft in his hand. He gently shook it around before leaning in and tapping the head against his lips a few times, placing small kisses on it each time.
"Like I said, don't let me stop you. A boy needs his pleasure, it would be rude of me to stop you, don't you think?" Harry cocked his head to the side in question, lifting an eyebrow. His tongue slipped past his lips and coated the bottom one. At the same time, he allowed himself to take in the view.
isn't a reindeer either, you cheeky monkey. It's a stag." He smiled in attempt to calm down his beating heart and the small boy who was sat at his feet. He slowly dropped down onto his knees, feeling them crack as they bent beneath him.
Draco stared back at Harry, murderous. "Harry, needa come so bad—Arghh—Please!" Draco whined, his eyes welling with desperate tears.
"Just making sure you're alright. Can I not do that?" Harry raised an eyebrow, questioning him. His eyes flickered down towards Draco's adam's apple and he watched it as it bobbed with every swallow. The sight was erotic and images of him sucking on his sensitive skin ran through his mind.
Harry forced Draco to look up at his face instead of the mouth watering treat in front of his eyes. He tilted his head upwards with Harry's touch and Harry met his pleading eyes.
Draco tilted his head in order to see it from another angle, but doing so still didn't seem to help him figure it out, so he gave up on trying to solve the mystery.
He steadily raised his fingers towards his mouth, placing his thumb against his bottom lip. He ran the smooth padding along it, slicking it with Draco's precome before sliding it into his mouth.
"Here's a bit of history for you, the ancient Greeks associated it with death and it was believed that there was a meadow of asphodel in the Elysian fields..." Slughorn continued to blabber on, but Harry decided to drown his voice out. One minute into the class and he was already achingly bored.
"Oh my—fuck me—nrghh." The moans escaped past Draco's lips with little effort. His mouth was now wide open and Harry found himself imagining he was shoving his cock inside.
The clock in the sitting room was nearing 6:30 p.m. as the boys played with their legos on the plush carpet. The steady rhythm of the second hand and the sound of light giggles floating around the room seemed to calm Draco's nerves.
"You mean
Draco's body twitched and the magnetic force of Harry's cock became too strong for Draco to resist any longer. His hand automatically reached out and he laced his elegant fingers around Harry's sensitive prick. Harry let out a strangled cry at the unexpected touch.
He opened the back of his throat and felt Harry slide smoothly down it, filling him up. His nose reached the wiry hair he's been playing with and it tickled his skin, causing him to scrunch up his nose in response.
In that moment, Harry concluded that he would be the one to restore Draco's happiness. It was difficult at first, and at times it still was, but he's made an immense amount of progress, and it couldn't have made Harry feel more elated with the outcome.
"If you're blathering on about the lecture, I frankly don't give a
Harry took one look at the come soaked sheets and wandlessly spelled them clean. Draco stared back at him in complete awe.
Now, he could still declare that he took in his environment with amazement, but he definitely couldn't say his intentions were completely innocent. Not when he was close to orgasming while watching his debauched childhood enemy crush ingredients at the front of the room.
Draco took a moment to watch Harry through his eyelashes. His eyes were dark and suggestive, unlike anything he's ever seen before. He felt a tight pull on his lace panties as he devoured the sight. His prick was jumping with excitement, desperately trying to break free from its restraint.
Draco's eyelashes fluttered at the seductive motion and his lips parted slightly. He couldn't help but draw in a shaky breath.
"I thought you were going to be a bad guy. No?" Draco questioned, raising his eyebrow in confusion.
I want you, okay? There's nothing to worry about, it's only me."
"Fuck." Harry cursed, squeezing the base of Draco's cock which encouraged a quiet, indecent moan to slip past his lips.
"Quiet, Draco. You need to be quiet for me, remember?" Harry reminded.
Draco went to pick it up, but Slughorn stopped him yet again. "Boy, haven't you learned anything in my class! What do we do with ingredients we aren't sure about yet? I'll tell you what we don't do! We
Harry licked his lips at the thought, picturing the pretty stain of Draco's orgasm pooling against the fabric of his uniform.
"What is it, Potter?"  Draco groaned, standing from his very comfortable position on the couch.
I felt an anger bubble inside me.  It dissipated as I kept staring into Harry’s eyes and was replaced by an overwhelming crushing weight on my shoulders.  Harry saw my father come to Voldemort’s side.  I knew he was an ex-Death Eater.  Ex.  He was under the Imperius curse.  He was.  But if what Harry was saying was true…  My mouth was dry when I finally tried to speak again.
“Don’t worry, I’ll make sure you pass the class,” I chuckled, pouring in the next ingredient.  Almost an hour later, Pansy’s previously perfect hair was frizzy and I could feel sweat dripping down my neck.  I glanced over to Harry’s table, and the three didn’t seem to be doing much better.  Hermione’s hair reached peak frizziness and she stared at the board, seeming to put the potion to memory; Weasel’s hair was damp against his forehead and was doing much worse than Hermione, instead, staring at his potion with his brow furrowed and a slight grimace; and Harry’s glasses were slipping down his nose, his robes in disarray and his potion gleamed a wicked green — nowhere close to being any colour it should be right now.  I let my eyes linger on him for a moment, admiring the thin strip of skin exposed from the undone top button, his tie hanging loose and the bit of his bottom lip he drew up between his teeth.  I swallowed thickly, pulling my mind away from thoughts inappropriate for class.  I looked down at my own ingredients and took a deep breath — I’d probably need more moonstone.  Perfect.  I quickly pulled out a scrap of parchment and scribbled a note on it.
“Wouldn’t think of it!” I called back.  I made my way up to the corridor with the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom, taking note of cupboards and alcoves students — or myself — may use for secret rendezvous.  There was no sign of Harry in the hall yet, so I paced through the surrounding ones until I heard someone coming down the hall.  It turned out to be a fourth year Hufflepuff going to meet their girlfriend in a nearby cupboard.  I stuck around for a little while longer until I heard the door of a classroom creak open.  I rounded the corner to see Harry quickly walking in my direction.
“The Ministry of Magic does not wish me to tell you this.  It is possible that some of your parents will be horrified that I have done so — either because they will not believe that Lord Voldemort has returned, or because they think I should not tell you so, young as you are.  It is my belief, however, that the truth is generally preferable to lies, and that any attempt to pretend that Cedric died as the result of an accident, or some sort of blunder of his own, is an insult to his memory.”
Draco watched as Harry scanned the crowd before his eyes staggered onto him for a moment before he turned his back. He saw me. He looked right at me. Harry slowly turned back around, averting his gaze to another part of the crowd, before singing the next verse.
One night after drinking a bit more than he should have and dancing particularly aggressively to a song, causing Draco to throw his head back laughing, Harry flopped onto the couch, almost sitting on Draco in the process, and leaned his head against Draco's shoulder.  Draco felt heat rise to his face as he continued to try to focus on his reading.  Harry reached out a finger to point at the picture on the page.  He tapped the page, giggled quietly and dropped his hand onto Draco's lap.
“You know it's only—”  I started but he cut me off.
“Now press it.”  I glanced up at Blaise.  He was smiling like a child waiting for me to press it.  “Come on.”  I reach out and press it.  The current message disappeared in a swirl and was replaced with “POTTER STINKS”.  My stomach dropped.
Our lives were no longer our own.
“I will be at the Ministry that day. I think I may have to run into him.” I could hear the signature Malfoy smirk on his face.
"We went to a couple pubs and the club—"
And many a drink he had that night until he was draped across the couch in a less than elegant way watching Harry play with the tiny kitten.  He fell asleep with his head nearly falling off the couch.
"Something to do with bumps making a sound.  Not sure really,"  He chuckled.  He hummed along as Draco watched.  Not long after, Draco would ask how to use the record player and started joining Harry on his shopping trips, eventually buying his own records — pretty much anything he could find.  His collection ranged from a handful of classical albums to metal to pop to classic rock to disco.  Harry will never forget the time he walked in on Draco dancing to ABBA.  He thanked Merlin he had his Polaroid nearby to snap a picture before Draco noticed.
“Hey you,” Harry laughed, stumbling through the vines.  I turned around to greet him with a smile.  He looked better than the other night — hair washed, eyes bright, a slight pep in his step even.  His bright smile covered half his face as he walked quickly over to me.
“Students raise their hands when they wish to speak in my class, Mr — ?”
We stayed there for a little while longer, exchanging stories of our childhoods, the good and the ugly.  Harry never let go of my hand.
“I don’t like being nervous,”  I groaned.  Pansy started stroking my hair.
Meanwhile, Harry scanned the crowd.  He always did, just in case that white-blonde hair was lit up under the coloured lights.  He allowed himself that one small fantasy — the boy the song was about showing up in the crowd one night, magically falling in love with him.  He knew it was ridiculous. Guilty pleasures.
“Good afternoon, Professor Umbridge,” We chanted back at her.  I glanced around the classroom.  Most students looked somewhere between the brink of falling asleep and utter contempt.
"Why?" Harry turned his head away from Draco to hide his blush. He was special. He was the only one of his old friends, if you could call them that, that he had written a song about. He was also the first boy to make Harry realise he might not be straight.
“Voldemort?” I whispered, unsure if I believed Harry.  “Are you sure?”
“Hey, shut it!”  I slapped his arm.  The boys all turned to me with furrowed brows.
"I just, I said that to a girl once. I was reading the Prophet before sixth year, and she asked who 'Harry Potter' was. Said he was a bit of a tosser." Draco shook his head, smiling at Harry.
“No, of course not!” I yelled back before lowering my voice.
“You’ve got a point.  You’re not lying?”  I shook my head vigorously.  “You’re not?”  He dropped his arms, and his eyes widened.
“I don’t know.  I don’t want to rush or overwhelm him,” I mumbled.  Pansy smiled sadly.
“Please!  Like you were subtle!”  He shook his head, laughing.  “You know, I’m not as oblivious as everyone thinks.”  My stomach dropped.
“Well, we’re reading just now.  If you have other queries we can deal with them at the end of class,” Umbridge said.
“Potter, what is this supposed to be?”  I looked over my shoulder to see Snape towering over Harry, sneering at his potion.  My stomach dropped for a moment, silently thanking Merlin that Snape wasn’t commenting on the note.  I glanced to the cauldron, now spewing dark grey steam.
“Hey,” She whispered as she gently sat down on the edge of the bed.
Despite the lack of clouds in the sky, our compartment was dark. I sat next to Pansy, who leaned her head on my shoulder. Crabbe, Goyle and Blaise sat across from us. Crabbe and Goyle engaged in a heated discussion of the Dark Lord’s return, claiming it to be the best thing to have happened since he first rose.
The rest of the day passed slowly again.  Boring classes, boring free blocks spent with Blaise hopelessly flirting with Pansy while glaring at me.  I had a pit in my stomach from potions; I needed to apologise to Harry.  I understood that calling Hermione a Mudblood was likely crossing many lines.
In the middle of a crowd, the wizarding world's golden boy saviour, with his long hair and ripped jeans and pride flag cape, was kissing the Malfoy heir with pastel rainbow hair and tequila breath, and nothing felt more right at that moment. Draco ran his hands through Harry's curls, thanking whatever entity it was that was allowing this dream to come true. Harry wrapped his arms around Draco's thin waist, pulling him flush against his body, their bodies fitting together perfectly. Just a few people away, Pansy watched with a smirk before turning back to the girl she was dancing with.
"Yes, Potter,"  Draco enunciated before breaking into a fit of giggles.  Harry shook his head, retrieving a pair of sweats and tossing them on the bed.
"Pansy dragged me out here," Draco laughed and shoved his hands into his pockets. "So this is where you disappeared to after the war." He smiled to try to cover up the wavering in his voice.
“The girls and I were talking last night.”  She started walking out as I continued laughing behind her.  “Let’s just get food.  I need coffee.”  I wrapped my arm around her shoulders and she yawned.
“Maybe you should make me,” I whispered.  I snickered as Harry flushed deeply, unable to come up with a retort.  I sauntered away with a bowtruckle in hand.  Harry joined Hermione and Weasel on the ground a few feet away and I joined Pansy.
If Harry had to wake up Draco, he'd run in as soon as he heard the screams and shake Draco awake.  Often, Draco would have tears streaming down his face and Harry would ask if he could do anything.  At first, Draco would wipe his tears silently and shake his head.  After one particularly bad night, he just wiped his tears but let Harry stay on his bed.  A few nights later, he let Harry hug him, and Draco broke down.  He began sobbing into Harry's shoulder, mumbling about how he wasn't good enough and didn't deserve the new life he was given.  Harry just held him, rubbing his back and telling him that he was a good person.  They stayed there until the sun came out when Draco finally peeled himself off Harry's shoulder and apologized profusely.
"Yeah, yeah, thank you, Harry."  This time, Draco was more conscious of using his first name,  letting it roll off his tongue slowly.  Harry paused.  It was odd to hear his name in Draco's mouth.  It sounded softer than when Hermione would snap it or Ron call it.  Draco made it sound almost like a song in a way Harry was unfamiliar with.
“Draco!”  I looked over my shoulder to see Blaise.  He was leisurely strolling down the hall, arms crossed in front of his chest.  “So, what did you guys ‘break up’ about this time?”  He sneered.  I sighed heavily.  Really, just the cherry on top.
Draco was still pushing his way to the front when the band began the second song.  The crowd pulsated to the beat, and Draco kept pushing his way.  He needed to get to the barricade.  He hadn't paid much attention to the first song the band did, already knowing the song enough but also being completely transfixed by Harry Fucking Potter.  Having overcome his shock, he now paid attention to the performance.
“Why will you be at the Ministry?” I felt the glare the moment he turned from the fire.
“Pansy, I don’t think today is a good day to do this.”  I kept watching Potter and his other Gryffindor friends.  Granger stormed out of the Great Hall, huffing as she usually does, and Potter was left with his uncomfortable friends, who also left.
“Hi Pansy,” I laughed.  She pulled away and caught a glance of my Prefect pin.  “You’re a Prefect too?  Why didn’t you tell me!  I haven’t heard from you all summer!”  I opened my mouth to reply before my father cut me off.
“Okay.  So, uh, well, I don’t know what you’ve heard about Cedric, and, uh, what happened out there…”  He pushed his glasses up his noses forcefully and stared intently at the grass.  I took a small step towards him, almost scared he’d blow up, but he took a small step backwards and put his hands up.  I nodded as he continued.  “But I want to tell you myself before Dumbledore announces it.”  He took a deep breath and swallowed thickly.  “Well, you know the point of the maze was to find the Triwizard Cup at the centre.  I helped Cedric out when we accidentally met in the middle.  Well, Fleur had been knocked out and I’m not sure what was up with Krum.  Cedric and I both saw the Cup at the same time, so we agreed to grab it together.
”  I countered.  I tried to use the least harmful hex I could without seeming like I was throwing the duel.  Jets of light shot from both wands, hit each other in midair, and ricocheted off at angles — Harry’s hit Goyle in the face, and mine hit Granger.  Goyle groaned as a bunch of boils began springing up on his face as Hermione began whimpering as her teeth grew.
“Long and boring per usual,” I said softly as I sat down. She took my hand.
“Seems like we both had less than desirable childhoods,”  Harry laughed sadly.
“How’d it go last night?” She asked softly.
“I wish it wasn’t,”  I sighed.
I slept alone that night.  The next morning I skipped breakfast but received a letter from my father.
"Yeah, thank you."  Draco nodded and watched Harry leave.
He'd seen Draco mostly naked plenty of times, but something about undressing him felt different.  Harry felt almost guilty when unbuttoning the light blue shirt but let out a sigh of relief noticing the white undershirt.  Draco giggled as Harry pulled the shirt off his shoulders, wiggling to make it harder.
Pansy stayed the night with me but neither of us slept much.  I fell asleep in her lap at one point but woke up shortly after a nightmare.  We didn’t talk much.  My mind felt numb to any new thoughts.  The screams of the crowd kept echoing in my head.  As morning rolled around, a Prefect knocked on the door, informing us that breakfast would be mandatory.
"Well, we're grabbing drinks before the next band plays. You're more than welcome to join us, as always," Cole laughed. Harry appreciated Cole's friendship, especially. He made him feel normal.
“No, of course not. I wouldn’t befriend a blood traitor like him.” My voice warbled and she gave me a knowing look. “The rest of the year was fine. Quite boring really. Besides the Tournament and Yule Ball of course.”
"Well, you must be special," Said the one who hadn't spoken yet. Mason.
The flat was small and sparsely decorated.  The door opened into a hall with a kitchen to the left and a living room next to it.  The living room was painted with grey walls and a sturdy fireplace with a hefty supply of floo powder sat against one wall.  Two black couches faced each other and a full bookshelf sat behind one of them.  The kitchen was fully stocked with kitchenware and some food basics.
“Every guest in this Hall,” said Dumbledore, and his eyes lingered upon the Durmstrang students, “will be welcomed back here at any time, should they wish to come.  I say to you all, once again — in the light of Lord Voldemort’s return, we are only as strong as we are united, as weak as we are divided.  Lord Voldemort’s gift for spreading discord and enmity is very great.  We can fight it only by showing an equally strong bond of friendship and trust.  Differences of habit and language are nothing at all if our aims are identical and our hearts are open.
"Alright.  Classes start proper tomorrow.  Your things have been moved to your new addresses.  I suggest you settle in tonight."  The trainer left as the trainees began apparating to their respective locations.
"We were just a couple of kids at the time, thought we were too young to die." Despite his best efforts, Harry couldn't stop thinking about that face. It's not him, you know that. Malfoy wouldn't show up to Edinburgh pride, much less with rainbow hair. Harry shook it off and tried to turn his focus back to his performance. "But life changes just like that, and there's just no going back."
But my parents.  My mother still lived in the same house as the bastard.  If I spoke one word out of line, she’d be tortured or killed.  My father would lose everything — his son, his wife, his power, even his life.  I can’t be responsible for them.
“Harry Potter, the boy who must always play the hero.”  I pressed a kiss to his forehead as he grumbled.
“I do now.”  We joined the others at the Slytherin table.  I’d glance over to Harry’s usual spot but it remained empty throughout breakfast.
However, it was the first time Draco felt it this deep in his stomach — an odd, tight feeling that made him dizzy and hyper-aware of Harry's eyes boring into the back of his head.  It made him quiver with an energy he had never felt before, something deep and scalding.  It made his brain foggy and brow sweat ever so slightly.  He hated what Harry could do to him by just being there, how he could weaken his knees with just a gaze.  He was used to the light flush that would sometimes paint his cheeks when Harry would sit too close and graze his hand, but he always chalked it up to the growing friendship between the men.  Now, as he felt his neck heat and face flush, the growing pit in his stomach made him think otherwise.
“I’m not!  I swear!”  She said loudly.  I snickered as I looked over my shoulder to see Hermione looking back at us.
“As long as you have studied the theory hard enough, there is no reason why you should not be able to perform the spells under carefully controlled examination conditions,” said Professor Umbridge dismissively.
“Of course.”  I gave him a quick, soft kiss.  “Goodnight, Harry.”  He smiled even brighter.
“Mother?” I whispered.
I quickly picked up the Prophet and unfolded the paper.
Grey eyes and lips of lies and that dark tattoo.
“Are you—”
“You're oblivious, aren't you! He can't take his eyes off of you most of the time! I catch him sometimes.”  I scrunched my brow.
“You alright?” She asked softly, laying a gentle hand on my arm.  I nodded.
“Very much,” Draco mumbled before pulling Harry down into a hungry kiss.  Both men sighed and Harry tucked an arm under Draco’s waist, holding their bodies close together.  Draco felt flooded with warmth as Harry’s tongue slid into his mouth and teeth grazed his lips.  Harry’s free hand gripped Draco’s hip before reaching for the hem of his shirt.  He broke the kiss before giving it a gentle tug.
And two, I’m practically in love with Harry Freakin’ Potter.
"No, it's Harry Evans." Cole looked between Draco and Harry. "Thought you two were mates?" Draco nodded slowly. It made sense for Harry to change his last name — even if a wizard saw him and got his name, he wouldn't immediately be recognised, especially with his new look.  Harry Evans was a brand new person.
“Okay.”  Harry moved his lips to my jawline, mumbling as he kissed me.  “I love you.  I’m sorry I didn’t get to say that last night.”  I sighed deeply as he returned to my lips.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” I mumbled, walking away.
"But like snakes slitherin' in the dark, I swear I felt something about to start."  Draco was only a couple rows behind the barricade now, mesmerised by Harry's singing.  He felt his gut clench as he processed the song — burn, lessons, war, snakes — he laughed to himself.  Of course, the parselmouth would sing about snakes.  "But we were on different sides, and I didn't think I'd make it out alive."  Draco's heart beat faster.  The more he listened to the lyrics, the more he heard himself in them.  Can't be.  He's singing about the war.  Could be anyone, he tried to convince himself, continuing to push forward.
“Hey, hey, I know.  We’re all stressed out.  It happens.”  I pressed a kiss to his head as he wrapped his arms around my waist.
I woke up the next morning less rested than the day before.  I spent a few hours staring at the ceiling, trying to make sense of the argument but ended up passing out before I could.  I dragged myself out of bed and got ready before meeting Pansy.
“Drop it.”  We walked silently to the Great Hall and joined the other Slytherins for dinner.  My muscles still hadn’t relaxed from the last class.  Pansy watched me with a careful eye.  The hall was loud with gossip of Harry’s outburst during Umbridge’s class.  I tried to tune it out.
“You are…”
“Manners, Potter,” I drawled.  “Or I’ll have to give you a detention.  You see,” I took a step into the compartment, eyes fixed on Harry.  “I, unlike you, have been made a Prefect, which means that I, unlike you,” I fixed a perfect smirk on my face, restraining from laughing at the red painting Harry's cheeks.  “Have the power to hand out punishments.”
“He can’t. He committed underage magic,” I muttered, taking a seat and pulling out a book.
“Remember dear,
"Okay."  Draco smiled, his eyes drooping shut, and reached out his arms, making a grabbing motion to Harry.  Harry sighed and laid down next to him.  He felt Draco's thin arms snake around his waist and pull him closer.
“Good idea.”  I nodded, tearing my eyes away from the Gryffindor table.  “I can’t believe how much homework we’ve already been assigned.  It’s the first day!”
facing a changing world.
"Right. This is an old classmate, Ma— Draco." Draco's stomach did a small flip when Harry said his name. He had always been Malfoy. He wracked his brain for any other time Harry had called him that but —
In one swift motion, Draco took Harry's face in his hands and brought their lips together.  His nose bumped Harry's glasses and their teeth nearly clashed together.  Harry froze for a moment, his hand still on Draco's shoulder, eyes wide open, before gripping his shoulder tighter and closing his eyes.  Their lips were still sweet from that morning's breakfast, and Harry could taste the honey from Draco's tea.  Draco breathed in deeply and recognized the scent of apples from the night before — Harry's shampoo.  Harry's stubble was rough in his hands and against his face.  Harry revelled in how soft Draco's lips were, and the delicate scent of his cologne flooded his senses.
"Apparate?"  Draco slurred.  Harry nodded, taking his elbow and bringing them home.
“You accompanied Draco to the Yule Ball.”  My mother stepped forward with a sweet smile.  I looked past Pansy and saw Harry bustling about with the Weasley clan and a few odd stragglers, including Mad-Eye Moody and Professor Lupin.  “I heard you made a dashing couple.”
"Us? No, we're both raging homosexuals as she'd say," Draco laughed. Harry nodded and smiled.
of the door closing, I was left alone in my bed, staring at the ceiling and finally able to let my thoughts wander after two unbearable and arduous months.  I silently thanked Merlin.
“I didn’t agree to the bet, Pansy,” I whispered back before plastering a smirk on my face and approaching the pair.
"Harry!" One of the boys yelled as they approached, holding up a shot glass before downing it. Harry laughed deeply, and Draco loved the way it sounded in his ears.
“Listen.”  I raised my hands as Blaise raised his eyebrows.  “I’m not sure how much longer we’re going to play this game, but it won’t be long.  When it is over for good, tell her.”  His brow furrowed.
“Well, he turned out to be a maniac, didn’t he?” said Dean Thomas hotly.  “Mind you, we still learned loads —”
"Really?"
“Close,” He whispered.  Harry laughed and pulled himself up.
“How the hell did you find this place?”  He laughed, stepping into the field.
“Thank you, sir.”
“Don’t worry about it.  I know you do,” I mumbled against his lips.  He paused for a moment before pulling back.  My stomach dropped.
“Hey, remember, anytime you need to sort out your feelings, I'm here for you,” She teased.  I laughed.  Blaise came around the corner and instantly glared at me.  I knew he had a major crush on Pansy, but right now, she was mine.  Or at least acting like mine.  I raised an eyebrow and gave him the famous Malfoy smirk. He sped up in front of us. Pansy rolled her eyes and I laughed.
“All of my homework?” He groaned.
“Don’t be.  I know you’re stressed.”  I pulled his head up and smiled at him.  I brushed my thumb along his cheek and pulled him into a soft kiss.  Harry practically melted into me.  I broke the kiss and planted another one on his forehead.  “Come on.  I can walk you, and if a teacher catches us, then I can just be reprimanding you for being out of bed after hours.”  I smirked as Harry laughed lightly.
"What?"  He'd mutter, feeling the heat rise to his face as Harry stared at him with glazed eyes.
“I do not wish to criticize the way things have been run in this school, but you have been exposed to some very irresponsible wizards in this class, very irresponsible indeed — not to mention, extremely dangerous half-breeds,” She finished with a wicked giggle.
“Right.  Sorry.”  Crabbe nodded.
“But being on administration’s and the ministry’s bad side isn’t going to help—”
“Why would I lie?”  He laughed, almost maniacally.  “My best friend hates my guts, the whole school is weary of my existence, even Dumbledore isn’t particularly happy about me right now, and I’m about to compete in a tournament people three or four years older than me die in,”  he rushed out all in one breath.  He paused and held up his hands.  “I really have nothing left to lose.”
"Is that how you figured out you're a 'raging homosexual'?" Harry grabbed the drinks and turned back around. The other boys had drifted away down the bar slightly, but neither Harry nor Draco seemed to mind. Or, more likely, they didn't even notice.
“Just come, Draco.” She took my hand and led me into the drawing-room where my father had already taken a seat in his large, leather armchair.
“You really didn’t have to go at Ron like that, you know,” He chastised lightly, pulling away enough to look me in the eye.  I pursed my lips and nodded.
"Wait really?"  Draco paused.  "He was pretty cute."
Breakfast went by peaceful, and Draco was thankful for the pancakes curing his hangover.  They moved throughout the day lazily, neither bothering to change out of their sweats.  Shortly after breakfast, and deciding not to do the dishes, Harry put on a record — Frank Sinatra's Songs For Young Lovers — and dropped onto his sofa, humming along to the soft jazz.  Draco joined him shortly after, with a mug of tea, on his own sofa, Mittens curling up in his lap.  Harry laid back, hands tucked beneath his head and Draco watched, no longer worried that the dark-haired boy would catch his stolen glances.  Eventually, Harry began singing along to the fourth track, Like Someone In Love.
“I know, I’m just—” I huffed, trying to word everything going on in my head.
Quickly faded 'way in that war.
,”  Harry and I shared a knowing smirk.  “I’ll double that.  Get on.”  I gave him a slight shove towards the portrait of the Fat Lady.  He mumbled the password and slipped inside.
.  Dumbledore turned, his eyebrows raised slightly.  He nodded slightly, sitting back down.  The other professors stared at the short lady in surprise.  I smirked.
“Good,” said Professor Umbridge. “I should like you to turn to page five and read chapter one, ‘Basics for Beginners.’ There will be no need to talk.”  Professor Umbridge left the blackboard and settled herself in the chair behind the teacher’s desk, observing them all with those pouchy toad’s eyes.  I silently opened the book and stared at the page mindlessly, not bothering to actually read the page.  After a few minutes, I glanced up and looked around the room.  Hermione sat with her book unopened and hand raised in the air, staring directly at Umbridge.
The Great Hall was silent that morning.  Most people weren’t eating.  Many just stared into the distance or at the empty seats next to them.  Diggory’s seat was like a void, fellow Hufflepuffs staring into the space, looking for answers.  A few minutes after the meal started, Dumbledore slowly stood up/
“Let’s not talk about that though.”  Harry pressed another kiss to my lips with a smile.  All thoughts of the dog disappeared from my mind as my focus turned to his very soft lips.  “I’m just so happy to see you.  Especially after the day I had,” He chuckled.  I raised a brow.
"The record?" Harry whispered, his dreamy smile still plastered on his face.  Draco coughed.
“What could you possibly want to tell me?”  Potter scowled at me as I just stood gaping.
"You're a bit of a tosser," Harry laughed. They shared a look, speaking unnecessary words they both considered for many years. Harry felt a pull in his gut he hadn't felt with any of the people who had asked him on dates in the past year; Draco similarly felt this pull but couldn't recognise what it meant right away.
“Without ever practising them before?”  I swallowed thickly.
"Malfoy,"  Harry hissed as Draco ran his finger across the counter and grimaced.
“What— where— oi! Slow down!”  I look back to see Harry a few yards back, still trying to find the vines.  I shook my head and walked back to him.
"Getting you to bed,"  Draco grunted.  Harry giggled and nuzzled is head into Draco's neck.  Draco felt his face heat up again and he brought Harry into his room.  As he placed Harry on his bed, Harry wrapped his arm around Draco's neck.
“Well, I don’t,” said Hermione bluntly. “There’s nothing written up there about
“Well done,” My father murmured again before leaving me.
I easily found my parents, stiff-backed and noses high.
"You're always looking to get fucked, whether by alcohol or the next guy you meet," Harry laughed.
"Er, no, no it's alright.  I'll be fine."  Harry smiled tightly.
“Draco, love,” She patted the spot next to her on the sofa. “Tell me about your trip home. How was it?”
“Rest of the week?”  I shifted my hands to rest over his shoulders.
“Wait.”  I grabbed his wrist.
“An old rhyme my mum used to tell me.  Trees and vines.”  I laughed, watching Harry stare at the enclosure in awe.
“Snape’s being a hardass,” Pansy muttered.  A silent ‘thank Merlin, not to me’ followed.  I smiled slightly.  I’d take Snape over the Dark Lord any day.  We made our way to lunch — shepherd's pie — and chatted with Blaise, Crabbe and Goyle about classes thus far.  I glanced towards the Gryffindor table.  Harry looked miserable, all signs of happiness from this morning gone.  He caught my eye a moment later.  I gave him a small smile and he returned a slight nod.  A bit of relief washed over me at the thought of seeing him tonight.  For an hour or two, I’d be able to pretend that everything was as it was last year, that the only threat of death or injury was ridiculous and protected by officials, that all we had to worry about was sneaking around like normal teenagers.  For a couple of hours each night, we could pretend to be normal.
“It’s Harry.  He wants to meet tonight.”  Pansy laid a soft hand on my shoulder.
“Who do you imagine wants to attack children like yourselves?”
“Truly,” I muttered.  We made our way to the dungeons to change and freshen up before dinner.
“Yes, but they don’t believe him when he says the Dark Lord is back,” She said calmly. It was true — the Prophet refused to print anything about his return. “Last I heard the Minister fervently denied it.”
“Yeah, this is good,” Draco mumbled, pulling Harry’s head up to look him in the eye.  Harry’s cheeks were dark and lips swollen, glasses crooked and hair sticking to his forehead and neck.  Draco chewed on his bottom lip at the sight of the absolutely messily gorgeous man, whose hands were now tickling the soft skin just above Draco’s waistband.  Draco smiled and placed a soft kiss on the corner of Harry’s mouth, just as Harry’s fingers slipped into his waistband.  Harry pulls Draco closer, though he wasn’t sure they could get much closer.  Their chests heaved in unison, pressed together, a strong heat rising between them.  Their soft kisses grew messy, teeth clashing and hands running wild against hot skin.  Between deep breaths, their hips found a rhythm, until the room filled with their messy sounds.
“Yeah, yeah I’m alright.”  She raised a brow but dropped the subject, handing me my bag.
“As long as we can.”  My heart fluttered.  “I don’t plan on letting you go any time soon.”  I tightened my hold on him slightly as he hummed quietly on my chest.
"Yeah, don't worry about it."  Draco put a hand up, stopping Harry in his tracks.  "You'll be a great Auror with those instincts."  He smiled.
“Like that?” Harry chuckled, moving back up to Draco’s face.  His deep green eyes were hooded slightly and his glasses crooked.  Draco smiled, running his hands to twist in Harry’s long hair.
can’t find out. I must side with Voldemort for my own safety. Yet the moment I publicly declare my allegiance to him, I lose any relationship with Harry and Hermione. But if I declare my allegiance to Harry, my family and I will surely lose my life, as well as my families. There seemed to be no right decision now. These questions weighed heavily on my shoulders throughout the summer as much as I tried to dispel them from my mind.
"That is true. Thank you." Draco downed his shot, cursing at the lack of salt or lime.
“Maybe a bit too close,” Blaise laughed, nudging Goyle with his elbow.  They all let out whooping laughs around me as we approached the rest of the class.  Harry glanced over at me with tired eyes and raised a brow at the snickering around me.  I smirked.
"Potter!  Potter!"  Draco called out and tried to shake him awake.  Harry woke up the moment Draco's hand touched his shoulder and instinctively threw a punch in his general direction.  "Fuck!"  Draco yelped, stumbling back and holding his jaw.
“Dray, I really don’t want to get into this again.”  I nodded and ran a hand through his hair.
"But fuck the years gone by, I got nothing left to say. Believe me, I never cried." Harry tried to resist the urge but ended up staring right at Draco as he sang the last line. "But I wish there was a way." Draco felt shivers down his spine. Did he mean that... to me? Harry tore his gaze away from Draco again to finish out the last chorus. Draco remained though, stupefied by Harry's stage presence and fire behind his eyes when he sang to Draco. His breath was lodged permanently in his throat, sweat causing his shirt to stick to his back — he couldn't tell if it was the closeness of the crowd or the fire Harry stared at him with. He couldn't pay attention to the rest of the song, eyes transfixed on Harry's near erratic dancing. As the song finished, Harry tossed his fist into the air, earning a roar from the crowd.
“Ah, sir. Respectful. Step aside, Narcissa. Let me get a proper look at him.” My mother dropped my hand and stepped backwards, leaving me standing alone in front of Voldemort. He began slowly circling me, the snake following his bare feet. “Do you befriend Mudbloods?”
any more boring?” Pansy groaned as we walked out of class.  We had a short break before Potions that we spent leisurely strolling through the halls.  First years ran about, trying to find their next classroom.  Second, third and four years hung out in groups, loudly talking and laughing.  Many fifth, sixth and seventh years paired off, whether as prefects or couples happy to see each other after the summer.  I silently wished Harry and I could do the same — meet in the halls, hold hands, sweet kisses on the cheek before class, sit by the lake during lunch, all of it.
“We just wanted to find you lot before we do our first patrol round,” Pansy muttered, still staring at Crabbe and Goyle.  “Weird ones.  Come on Draco!”  She took my hand and we left the compartment.
to give Harry the cold-bucket-of-water wake-up.  Harry would thank him as soon as he dried himself using the hot-air-charm.  Draco would ask if there was anything he could do to help and Harry would quickly say no and that he was alright.  Draco would leave but not sleep for the rest of the night.
"Really Potter?  I thought we were sharing this flat."  He looked back up to smirk at Harry but ended up smiling at his preposterous expression.
“Watch me,”  I laughed cynically.  Pansy rolled her eyes and tried to push me off her.
“I’ve been trying.”  I closed my eyes, letting her touch lull me.
"Shut up." Harry turned around and handed him a shot glass. "Drink." Draco eyed him.
.  I tried to send him an apologetic glance but he looked away before I could.  The three conversed for a moment before Hermione ran out of the Great Hall.  I tried to meet Harry’s eyes again and signal him to meet me, but he was deep in conversation with Weasel.  A few minutes later, Pansy nudged me.
leave you for her,” He threatened, stifling a laugh, one night.  I raised my hands in mock defeat.
“Thank you,”  I whispered in Pansy’s ear.  She giggled and nuzzled her head on my shoulder.  We sauntered back to the dungeons.  On the way, we saw a frazzled Potter.  His eyes were cast down as he walked fast from the Hall, trying to avoid other students.
“Potter!”  I spat, adding a wink at the end.  His eyes widened and he looked down. Mudblood Granger came up to him and took his arm, leading him away from me, mumbling in my direction.  I sighed and kissed Pansy's head.
“I know.”  I tucked one hand under my head and brought the other one cup his neck.  “And you’re the only one in my life.”  He smiled brilliantly.
“Pansy, what are you doing?”  I asked as soon as we stopped.
"Alright.  Let's get you to bed."  Harry gently pulled Draco up, wrapping his arm over his shoulders.  "Come on you,"  Harry laughed as Draco groaned, heaving his body weight onto Harry.  Granted he was quite thin and Harry could've easily just picked him up, but Draco just curled his arm around Harry's neck and leaned against him.  They slowly made their way up the stairs, Draco laughing as he laid his head against Harry's shoulder, causing heat to rise to Harry's face.  Just at the top of the stairs, Draco nuzzled his head against Harry's neck.
Love seems like a curse, you made that true,
Now when they got home, they'd flip a coin to see who would pick out the music for the night.  Mittens would occasionally join them, opting to sit next to Draco who would pet him in time to the music.  They'd listen to two or three albums before going to bed, Harry occasionally taking breaks from studying to dramatically sing a ballad or dance to an upbeat song.  Draco would always roll his eyes first before smiling through Harry's antics.  Harry would then collapse next to Draco with a hazy smile on his face.  Occasionally, he'd just watch Draco as he read, until Draco would meet his gaze and pink would tinge his cheeks.
“No.  No way,” I finally said.  Harry clenched his jaw and furrowed his brow, trying not to let more tears spill.  I shook my head furiously, tears pricking the backs of my eyes.  I pursued my lips.  “No, you’re wrong.  It was somebody else.  Anybody else.”
“Draco,” Pansy whispered.  I tore my gaze away from the gleeful Gryffindors and turned my attention back to my breakfast.  “You gotta stop staring at him.  Someone’s gonna notice.”  A pit grew in my stomach.  Despite the cheerful nature of breakfast, I could already feel a weight settling on my shoulders.
“Wouldn’t be the first time,” I muttered. “Do you plan to attend the trial?” I asked, turning back to my book.
"Hey little guy,"  Harry mumbled as he picked up the kitten.  "Draco!  Look what I found!"  Harry called as he walked back in.
“If I didn’t think you were setting me up, I actually would laugh.”  He cocked his head and crossed his arms.  “But since this seems like exactly that, I’m just gonna head back to my room now and contemplate everything about the tournament.”  He turned on his heel and began towards the castle.
“But you just can’t say it.”  I sighed and closed my eyes.
“I didn’t think you’d admit it,”  Potter chuckled.  My jaw dropped.
“And today is the last morning you’ll wake up refreshed if I know you at all.”  Pansy smiled and nodded.
“What?”
“Now…
“So . . . on my whistle, Harry and Cedric!” said Bagman.  “Three — two — one —”  With that, a short whistle sounded and Harry and Diggory darted into the maze.  I sighed as I lost sight of Harry.  The other two champions were let in soon after and the horrid waiting time began.  I watched the clock tick by — 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes.  Around an hour I decided to stop watching the clock and instead focus on watching the maze.  I zoned out until something landed on the grass outside the entrance.  Immediately a crowd surrounded the area, screams and hushes escaping their mouths.  The spectators slowly quieted before—
“Don’t stay up too late.  You need to sleep.”  I pressed a gentle kiss to his head.  He sighed heavily and pulled away enough to look at me.
"Right of course," Harry smiled. Draco's eyes gleamed under the flashing coloured lights, and Harry tried to keep his breath steady. Draco untangled himself with a dazed smile gracing his face and pulled his phone out to text Pansy. He drafted a sloppy text saying he was with Harry and was fine before turning his attention back to Harry. He was still moving to the music but kept his eyes fixed on Draco.
“Thank you.  I know that you believe me and you’re on my side.  I just wish everyone else would believe me too.  They’re all in danger if they stay ignorant.”
"Hasn't everything?" Harry smiled and nodded. "I mean, you're in a rock band, my hair is dyed, and we're actually getting along right now." Draco laughed again and shook his head.
“How do I know that you’re not lying?”  I almost sneered at him.  He deadpanned.
"Fine, Malfoy!"  Harry yelled back.  They stood there, staring at each other breathlessly before Draco started laughing quietly.  Within a few moments, both men were paralyzed with laughter.  Draco leaned against the wall while Harry stood doubled over with his hands on his knees.  How foolish it seemed after everything they had gone through — arguing about the showering schedule.  Once they caught their breath, Draco smiled before turning back to the bathroom.
“The Draught of Peace,” said Harry tensely.  I bit the inside of my cheek to prevent laughing.  That was most certainly not the Draught of Peace.
When Draco heard the heavy steps coming down the stairs, he turned around with a mug in his hands but almost dropped it.  Sure, he had seen Harry shirtless plenty of times, even when they were living together, but he wasn't expecting a shirtless Harry with his sweatpants hanging low on his hips, revealing almost too much, with his hair a mess and glasses haphazardly strewn on his face.  As he lifted his arms to stretch, Harry let out a low groan and Draco nearly squeaked as the sweats dropped a centimetre lower.
“Have you yet attempted to use any of them?”
Harry opened his eyes the moment their lips parted, his mouth opened slightly and lungs straining to breathe again.  He kept his grip on Draco's shoulder, watching as the blonde slowly removed himself from Harry, refusing to open his eyes.  Harry couldn't decide if he wanted to pull Draco back to him and never let go or drink a whole bottle of whiskey before confronting the situation.
“A note! Potions!”  My eyes widened.  Oh hell no, not in public.  “Snape won't deduct more than five points for passing notes if he catches you.”  I thought for a moment.  What do I have to lose, other than my dignity?
"Patronus," Harry mumbled one day when they were brainstorming.
“The other day when you were out.  I got bored so I raided your wardrobe.”  My jaw dropped.  “By the way, these are incredibly comfy.”  She smirked casually.  I rolled my eyes and wrapped my arm around her shoulders.
“Ready?” Harry asked, lining himself up.  Draco tensed slightly and nodded.  Harry noticed and shifted over Draco, placing a soft kiss on the corner of his mouth.  “I’ve got you,” He whispered.  Draco nodded and Harry shifted his hips forwards.  He lightly trailed kisses along Draco’s neck as he gently pushed in and waited until Draco relaxed.  “I’ve got you,” He whispered again, close to Draco’s ear, causing him to shiver.  “Just tell me when.”
But fuck the years gone by,
“Not yet sir.”
“Yes. Pansy,” I chuckled. She smiled knowingly again as if she knew there was more I wasn’t telling her.
“I— how— you—”  For the first time, I, Draco Malfoy, was truly speechless, until I finally managed to blurt out—  “I do not sound like that!”  Potter threw his head back, laughing.
“So, you never told me how that meeting went,” Pansy asked quietly over the table.  I sighed and picked at the food on my plate.
“Dean Thomas.”
Draco stirred quietly, letting out a soft moan.  Harry felt a blush creeping up his cheeks as Draco began waking up.  His eyes fluttered open lightly.  He looked at Harry and smiled before startling and shifting back on the bed.
“I know.  It’s just appearances, I promise,”  I assured him.  He nodded curtly.  “Just read that when you get the chance.”  I smiled at him, trying to lighten the mood a bit.  “Now go.”  He nodded, trying to suppress a smile.  I sauntered away, biting the corners of my mouth to not smile too much.
My appearance was also slowly declining. I ate less during meals, the presence of the Dark Lord draining my appetite. I slept less at night, overwhelming fear of dreaming and what was to come in the next school year. I did my best to hide my dark circles and slimming frame from my parents and the Dark Lord, but my mother took notice. She said nothing but would give me meaningful glances during dinner and when we would return to our rooms.
“When did you even—”
“Come on, we have to go to the Prefect’s carriage.”  Pansy pulled us away from the window and we made our way to a private carriage near the front of the train.  We entered to find the Head Boy, a tall and lanky Ravenclaw, and the Head Girl, a prideful Gryffindor, waiting for the Prefects.  We were the first to enter, followed by the Ravenclaw Prefects, Hufflepuffs and finally, running in, out of breath, Hermione and Weasel.
"It's late.  You should go to bed,"  Harry murmured, smiling at the sleepy man.  Draco slowly sat up, rubbing his head.  "Let me know if you need anything, okay?"  Harry grabbed Draco's wrist as he stood.  Draco looked at Harry's hand on his wrist then to his face and smiles softly.
“Okay, well, I’ve lived in Malfoy manor my whole life.  I’ve never met either of my aunts or much of my family outside my parents and grandparents on occasion.”  I sighed.  “I grew up an only child, no cousins, no pets, not many friends before school.  My parents enjoyed vacations throughout Europe and teaching me magic from a young age, like flying a broom.  My father wasn’t around very often.  He took a lot of business trips, so I became rather close to my mother.  That’s about it.”  Harry lightly rubbed his thumb on my hand.
And I made it worse.  I tormented him every day and for what?  Because he wouldn’t be my friend first year?  I just added to the hate and mistreatment in his life despite my feelings for him.  I could’ve helped.
“Everyone else,”  He said calmly.  “The Daily Prophet would have a frenzy with it.  Your father would probably go on a murdering spree.  I get it.  It’s easier this way.”  He gently played with the hair at the nape of my neck.
"Really, Potter?  Thought you'd want the Gryffindor colours."  Draco leaned casually in the doorway, smiling at Harry as he unpacked his trunk.  Harry looked up, meeting Draco's eyes and smiled.
“Come on,” Harry smiled, holding out his hand.  Draco cautiously sat up and took it.  “Let’s go upstairs?”  Draco’s eyes widened before he stood up next to Harry.  Harry smiled even wider and kissed Draco’s cheek before tugging him towards the stairs.  Halfway up, Draco trips and they laugh lightly.  Harry lightly laid his hand on Draco’s cheek.  Draco instinctively leaned into the touch, letting Harry push him backwards until he bumped against the wall.  Harry ran his hand up Draco’s arm as their lips met.
"You're ridiculous," Draco smiled.
“Are you excited?”
“Fine, I'll do it,”  I said, dropping my shoulders.  Pansy squealed.
“Settle down,” He drawled despite the room being silent.
“It’s all going to be okay, I promise,”  she whispered.  I smiled at her and nodded.
She flicked her wand again and more words appeared on the blackboard again.
.”  I pulled him into a tight hug.  His tense muscles relaxed slightly in my arms and I closed my eyes, savouring the sweetness of the moment.
"That's the fun of chippys,"  Harry took the fork out of the top of the box and dove in.  "You eat it while walking."  Draco watched, scowling still, but slowly followed suit.
"Malfoy, there's a chippys like a block away.  You can walk."  Draco huffed, putting on his own jacket and following Harry.  They walked in silence for a few minutes until they reached a kebab shop.  Draco scrunched his nose.
The Great Hall was bustling and reeling with joy for the new year.  Pansy and I joined Crabbe, Goyle and Blaise at the Slytherin table as McGonagall led the First Years in with the Sorting Hat and a stool in her hands.  As she set the stool and Hat down, it began singing it's beginning of year song.  I didn’t pay much attention, as I never really did, until the Hat neared the end.
“It's fantastic!”  Harry exclaimed, turning back around to me, a bright smile across his face.
“Tired.”
“I know.”  A few minutes later, Harry stood up and walked out of the Great Hall.  Pansy and I followed suit shortly after, going to the library to work before our rounds.  We stayed there for three painstaking hours before going to the dungeons to drop our bags off and start our rounds.  After scolding a few straggling first years, the halls grew empty and quiet, and we grew exceedingly bored.
“Us!”  Harry let go of me and took a step back, motioning his hands wildly.  “All of us against Voldemort!  The Ministry is being ignorant and—”  I put my hands up.
“Wow, Potter.  I didn’t think you could get any worse at potions.”  I turned my sneer to Harry and placed my hand on the table.  He lazily glared back, looking dead inside.  I held myself back from grabbing his collar and pulling him into a kiss right then and there.  Instead, my sneer softened slightly, enough for him to quirk a brow.  “You never cease to amaze me.”  I winked as I left the note on the table.  A small smile flickered on Harry’s lips as he slipped his hand over the note and into his pocket.  I stole another glance at his potion as I passed, instantly regretting it.  I continued making my own potion, helping Pansy along so she wouldn’t completely flunk the first day until Snape began drawling again.
"Daddy! He say
He noticed the small movements of Draco's hips rolling into the covers, rutting his erection into the mattress as discretely as possible.
about what you have to offer. I'm rather busy focusing on something else entirely and you should be following in my footsteps as well."
He couldn't succumb to this as well, especially since he just consented to the idea of letting his children wear their swim trunks into the bath. They convinced him by declaring: "Papa, this is playtime, okay? Not bath time. We bring water toys, too."
Right now, the two boys were head first inside the fridge, their faces flushed and tingling from the cool air.
Albus dropped himself on the floor, landing on his bum with a small "oof". Scorpius stared back at his Papa with wide eyes that were glazed over with fear. They aren't used to Draco raising his voice with them.
Harry wanted to counteract, but he strongly decided against it.
"Stay." Draco demanded, looking directly at Harry's right leg. Harry couldn't help, but chuckle at the boy.
"You're a noisy one, aren't you? Gods, I can only imagine how you'd sound unrestrained. Singing out a beautiful melody of pleasure while I fuck you into a mattress."
Draco's eyelids flew open at the reminder, absorbing as much of the scenery as he could. Sure enough, he was still situated in the back of the classroom as Slughorn droned on about the draught of living death.
The way Draco's tongue poked out in concentration as he leaned into the table was driving Harry insane. He idly wondered if Draco would take the hint if he stood up and left to 'use' the restroom. Harry concluded that he would, but he didn't think he could manage a trip to the men's room in his current state.
Harry concluded after viewing the equipment that appeared to still be in use.
"Let me help you." Slughorn offered, but Draco quickly shut him down.
Draco's opposing hand curled around Harry's shaft, squeezing the hot flesh with gentle care. His lips littered wet kisses underneath the swollen head as he began to stroke at the base.
Harry didn't know how to prepare the flower, but that sure as hell wouldn't help him to know
"Could what?" Draco asked as an impatient hand flew up to sit on top of Harry's.
." Harry teased, making his way over to the edge of the tub. Just like he previously did with his
with his new living arrangements. He begged McGonagall to adjust the system, to let him stay with Ron instead, but she wouldn't budge.
"Yes, you've been such a good boy for me, Draco. I know you can hold on just a little longer.
"Don't you even dare." Draco panicked, clasping his other hand around Harry's wrist which put a stop to his tantalizing motions.
! They kept asking me for all these things and I tried to say no, but they kept
The soft silk felt delightful against his erection. The smooth surface teased every inch of his skin as he rolled his hips down harder into the mattress. His gaze never faltered from the fierce green eyes that looked back.
The feeling of tiny fingers gripping tighter to his shirt brought him back to reality. "I'm sorry I yelled." He repeated, this time making sure he continued before he was lost in this thoughts again. "I'm not mad at you both. I was just scared, that's all."
"Harry, I swear to Merlin—" Draco cut himself off before harshly grabbing Harry's erection through his trousers and forcefully squeezing it. Harry winced in pain, dropping his book bag back onto the stone cold floor.
Harry's words erupted through Draco's body with so much force that it drove him right onto Harry's lips. Draco was sloppy and uncoordinated, but he couldn't find it in himself to care.
Only after 5 minutes in the bath, Draco had found himself laughing harder than he's had in
"Draco." Harry lifted the leg that Draco was resting on to force him up. "Come here, my sweet boy."
"Mine. Not Harry's." Draco stated. His face was now an inch away from Harry's and he stared coldly into his eyes.
"Papa you have to be King of Mertown. You just have to be!" Albus splashed around in his space, still overjoyed by the fact that his Papa agreed to play with them.
Draco was
"I said I'll take care of you, so I'll keep my promise to that. If you come any closer, this ends. Do you understand?"
on the floor, Draco soon felt the weight of another child mirrored onto his opposite leg.
He shifted his weight on his feet and spun around to face his troublemakers. He didn't know whether to laugh at the sight folding out in front of him, or have a heart attack.
"Harry?" Draco vacillated quietly. Harry rolled his neck around to peer back down at him. Harry's strong stare almost deterred Draco from continuing, but he then reminded himself of the conversation they previously had.
"That's quite alright, Professor." Draco had never felt more humiliated in his life, standing in front of his classmates as he desperately tried to suppress a moan.
"S' only you." Draco whispered almost breathlessly. Harry's eyes lit up at the sound of Draco's voice and that unfamiliar feeling surged through Draco's body yet again.
Draco sighed, knowing he was fighting in a battle he could never win. Stopping the faucet from filling the water too high, he finally gave into the brat's wishes. Looks like he was going for a swim tonight as well.
The scene that just played out was what made everything Draco did in his life
"No, you hold it, ok?" He pushed the creation closer to Draco with a huff and Draco's eyes began to strain, forcing him to refocus the world around him again.
with them in the
! It was the most excitement they've experienced all day (that is, if you don't count their dessert before dinner)!
The amount of times he cried himself to sleep at the age of 17 in his four poster bed at the Manor. The way he could hear the monster of a man from two floors below speaking thoughts of how he planned on torturing Harry Potter in
"Harry—" Draco's speech was cut of by a particularly filthy moan, snapping back on his dildo. "Gonna—" Harry didn't need to hear the rest before his own hand flew away from his prick and straight to his wand, stopping the dildo from moving completely.
Draco let out a deafening moan and his eyes rolled back in pleasure. Draco continued to grind down on Harry, leaving desperate kisses all along his hip bone.
Draco had never felt so loved in his life. He never felt so cared for and so precious. Harry was fulfilling a craving he never knew he had until this very moment in time.
Knowing that Draco would be good to go, he placed his wand on the desk behind him, leaned back in his chair, and worked his own magic on himself.
"Nghh—Yes, quiet. Please Harry." His hips bucked upwards again to meet with Harry's palm and the other boy pressed down against the swollen flesh.
"We can't play Merpeople with two people! We just
He noticed the excitement his puckered hole was experiencing by the way it continuously clenched around the air, desperate for attention. It reminded him once again of what Harry had asked him to do. This time he didn't get upset that he forgot.
His hand found its way back into the patch of curls hugging Harry's now limp prick and he absentmindedly combed his fingers through it. His eyes fluttered shut and his body went limp against Harry's leg, completely spent and exhausted.
"Harry—" Draco breathed out, his teasing finger trailing over his crack. His legs were now back up in the air and bent at the knees, giving him full access to his own arse.
"That was hot as fuck." Harry breathed out, chuckling in disbelief. How the hell have they not gotten caught yet? It was all sheer luck that nobody thought too hard about Draco's appearance.
pick it up with our bare hands! You never know the reaction it could cause. Crouch down so you're level with it."
Draco arched into a full body spasm, his heavy cock shuddering in Harry's hand. "Yes. That's it, Draco. Come for me."
Harry smirked as he watched Draco stumble to the front of the class, knees wobbling underneath him. He held his robes closed, hoping his erection would be hidden while he walked past his classmates.
when I came home. You were the loudest out of the three of you!" Draco rolled his eyes, but the smile on his face was still prominent.
"Maybe, but I'm not willing to experiment now. Please just
Draco was aware that Harry's attendance at the Ministry today was strictly for a meeting, but those scared him as well. Meetings could eventually lead to fieldwork, which can lead to injuries, which can lead to St. Mungos, which can—
"Ha ha, very funny." Hermione rolled her eyes and nudged Ron's back, causing him to lose his footing.
"You look a little flustered, Draco. Are you sure you're alright?" Harry pushed, not really understanding why he wasn't dropping the subject altogether. Maybe he
“Draco!”  Someone whispered from a closet.  I turned around and leaned forward.  The door opened, revealing Pansy smiling like an idiot.  She reached out, grabbing my arm and pulled me into the closet.
“I promise,” He whispered before pressing a sweet kiss against my lips.  I could feel us both smiling into the kiss.  We spent the rest of the night talking as we usually did, but I could feel a tension in my gut I wasn’t used to.  I could see that me not saying ‘I love you’ was making him upset to some extent.  I hated the slight pang of sadness that would pass through his eyes as my moment for saying it passed in silence.  I hated how his kiss lacked for a moment before fully relaxing into me.  I hated that I knew I was hurting him but still couldn’t bring myself to say it.  He kept promising that he understood but understanding why and hurting regardless are two different stories.
"You alright?"  Harry asked from the doorway, causing Draco to jump and swear under his breath.
?” Voldemort sneered, moving closer to my father.  He simply straightened his back and nodded.
“I see no difference,”  Snape said calmly.  Granger’s eyes filled with tears as she ran out of the corridor.  Harry and Ron both started screaming insults at Snape, but thankfully due to the echo in the hall, Snape couldn’t pick out the exact words but understood the point.
“Yes.  She’s a bitch.”  He sighed heavily.  I chewed on my lip for a moment.  I could feel anger lightly rolling off of Harry.
“He wasn’t dead, but yeah, he’s returned!” Harry yelled.
“Yeah of course.”  I nodded.
“Of course
“Making me look like more of a fool?  You know, your favourite pastime?” He spat.
My heart stopped.
“What’s changed?”  Realisation washed over his face.  “You’ve actually got someone, don’t you?”  Heat rushed into my cheeks.  He smiled like a kid who just found the full cookie jar.  “Ha!  You do!  Well, who is it, mate?”  I shook my head and started walking again.
"Really?"
Patronus went on to become quite popular, playing many underground shows before being invited to perform at larger venues.  They became quite well known, and in May, they received an invitation to perform at the local pride event.  Jasper was openly gay, and Harry had eventually figured out he was pansexual, so they agreed happily to play sets on Wednesday, Friday and Saturday.
"Each time I look at you I'm limp as a glove," Harry sang softly, turning his head just enough to meet Draco's eyes.  "And feeling like someone in love."  Draco flushed even darker, even the tips of his ears turning pink at Harry's dreamy smile.  The record slowed to a stop, light static buzzing from the speakers, but neither man moved for a moment.
“I can’t help that you’re just so attracted to me,” Harry smirked and placed a soft kiss on Draco’s jawline.
“Already invading our room Pansy?” Blaise sneered half-heartedly.
“What’s got your knickers in a twist?” Blaise asked.
“I didn’t know you drink coffee.”  She shook her head.
“No,” He murmured against my lip.  “Nope, we aren’t talking about that tonight.  I’ve got detention for the rest of the week.  I want to spend tonight just—”  I pulled away slightly to look him in the eye.
“No matter how many times you point that out, she won’t change!  She’ll just keep giving you detentions!  Don’t you think your time is better spent outside detention teaching yourself defence?”
for our cause?” Voldemort stepped in front of me again, his wicked grin close to my face.
“Maybe you will if you don’t shut up,” He said out of the side of his mouth.  I smirked as I reached around him, bringing my mouth close to his ear.
“—get away with this!  We need to know how to defend ourselves!  I thought you would understand!”  Harry just glared at me for a moment before stomping away towards the exit.
“What are you talking about?”  My palms were sweaty and my body felt like it was devouring itself.
“This will all be okay in the end,” She said softly.
“I still want to know what that note said,” Blaise laughed.  I rolled my eyes as Pansy chimed in.
“So, are you guys meeting tonight?” Pansy asked as she closed my door behind her.
“That’s… that’s absolutely horrible.”  I muttered.  I tried to wrap my head around it.  Sure, I was a bully, albeit not entirely by choice, but I could never imagine doing that to a child every day.  Family.
“He… he told me some important stuff,” I mumbled.
“You’re insufferable,” She sneered with a grin.  I snickered.
“Make sure to cast a silencing charm,” He grumbled.  Pansy flashed him a devious smile before sitting next to me on the bed.
I started after the vines.
“Ladies and gentlemen,” Dumbledore began his announcement, effectively claiming the attention of the bustling room.  “In five minutes’ time, I will be asking you to make your way down to the Quidditch field for the third and final task of the Triwizard Tournament. Will the champions please follow Mr Bagman down to the stadium now.”  I watched as Harry warily stood, saying goodbye to his friends, and making his way to the other champions.
“Oh my god Draco!”  She squealed and giggled.
“That is correct Narcissa,” A low voice hissed. Chills danced down my spine as the air in the room grew cold and stiff. Voldemort slipped into the room, his massive snake at his feet. “And it is to our advantage as well. We are able to remain in the shadows, our movements unnoticed. It is a pity though, that our dear Mr Potter managed to fend off our Dementors.”
"Alright, boys, behave!"  Harry laughed as Jasper pulled Cole's plug out of the amp, causing a cursing match between them.  "Alright!  This next song is an original!"  Jasper started playing a riff as Mason set the beat.
How was I supposed to know I'd fall for you?
“Come on, I want to eat before our meeting.”  I started down the hall.
"Yeah, yeah, just, er, just a nightmare."  He took a deep breath before meeting Harry's eyes.  "I'm alright.  It happens.  I'm sorry I woke you."  Draco looked away, feeling his face heat up.  He hated seeming weak, especially in front of Harry.  Despite their budding friendship, he still viewed Harry as Harry Potter, the boy who defeated Voldemort and changed history.  Draco knew that Harry no longer saw him as a Death Eater, and he worked hard to fix his public image — he was truthful at his trial that he only complied to save himself and his family; he did community service as a junior potions master at St. Mungos; he even publicly addressed and apologized for his and his family's actions during the war.  Draco wanted to be a strong man, redeeming the Malfoy name after his father nearly destroyed it.  That man wasn't supposed to have nightmares that woke up the wizarding world's golden boy.
“Are you a Ministry-trained educational expert, Miss Granger?”  The air in the room stood still.  Pansy and I shared a short glance before watching the mess in front of us unfold.
Draco's took a few moments before obeying Harry's commands. Harry's sultry riddled irises soon met Draco's and time seemed to slow down. It was only the two of them who mattered in this world in this moment.
of the refrigerator, his teeth clattering as he went through the vegetable drawer to find carrots for his Dad.
"Princess Papa?" Scorpius questioned while meeting Draco's gaze. Albus began to cackle and hit his small hands against the bubbles that littered the waters surface, sending droplets of water flying in every direction. He was acting like it was the funniest thing in the world, and to him, it probably was.
." Harry mimicked in the same tone as him. The playful grin he was trying to suppress finally made its way to the forefront. He just couldn't help himself. Draco was just too adorable.
"Hello King Papa, I here to be Prince!" Albus' started after explaining how the game will work. Draco guessed that he didn't explain it well enough, because he was still confused as to what they were doing exactly. He could've sworn they were the 'bad guys'.
It poked at Draco's entrance and startled him, causing him to frantically search for Harry's whereabouts in the room. When he saw Harry still sitting in the old wooden chair in front of him, his eyes furrowed in confusion, but quickly changed once the member started to apply more pressure on his rim.
"Oh, Harry!" Draco dramatically cried out, throwing his arms up. "It was
"Seeing as that was never my intention, I think I'm doing just fine." Harry teasingly said, believing it would get a rise out of the other boy. He was definitely not expecting the response he received.
Harry pretended to contemplate his options, even though he already had the outcome set in his mind.
Water spilled over the edge of the tub and pooled on the tiled floor, but Draco couldn't find it in himself to care. He could barely hear his children's laughter over his own as he screamed out for mercy.
Draco furrowed his eyebrows in contemplation. He wasn't sure how to go about this. He's never asked to suck someone's cock before, it always just happened. He felt quite lost and he wished that Harry would take the hint.
"Albus Severus! Where did you learn that?" Draco gaped, whipping his head around so quickly that he's surprised he didn't pull a muscle.
"Harry please." Draco breathed, reaching his hand out to grab ahold of Harry. He clutched the cotton fabric of Harry's shirt in his fist and tried to pull him up.
His head tiredly rolled over Harry's shoulder and stopped when his face was pressed against his neck. Draco breathed in the musky sent emanating off of his warm skin and he pressed his lips upon the soft flesh.
"Something wrong, Mr. Malfoy?" Slughorn placed a supportive hand against Draco's shoulder to steady him.
"Fuck." Draco whimpered. "Can't get it down."
It took Harry's mind a few moments to grasp onto what Draco was asking him to do, which was a moment too long for Draco's anxious mind.
"Daddy! Me n' Albus took Princess Papa's castle!" Scorpius giggled, scrunching his nose when Harry placed a kissed onto it.
Harry threw his head back, basking in all of Draco's touches and caresses. He groaned loudly and bucked his hips forward in search of Draco's mouth.
"Maybe then you would use your opposing hand to stroke it, that usually calms most herbs. Of course I only know this from experience with other
He had to save his brother. He just
He didn't register that his eyes were still closed until he felt two arms slither around his neck, followed by a small body molding to the curve of his spine.
"Harry. Yes." Draco whimpered, barely audible. His movements faltered as he neared the end of the bed, and his eyes sought out Harry's. The pout on Draco's face grew prominent when the silver ones locked with the green.
Draco found himself face to face with Harry's cock once again, but with much more excitement about it than the first time. He wasn't able to properly pay attention to it when he was riding out his orgasm. This time, Harry had his full and undivided attention.
Harry could see the entrance to the classroom just at the end of the hall and he gained speed. When he passed the threshold, he came to an abrupt stop, doubling over to catch his breath.
"Such a pretty boy." Harry's words of endearment were almost enough to cause Draco to spill all over his silk sheets and make a mess of himself.
Soon their ambush commenced and Draco found himself to be the primary target. Water was flying about and hitting every exposed surface of Draco's skin. Scorpius was holding the water strainer directly over Draco's hair and Albus was bouncing up and down, creating his own makeshift wave pool.
The pre-come that gathered atop his slit spilled over and Draco's eyes followed the bead as it dribbled down the length. Draco's tongue caught the salty liquid before it reached his hand and he moaned in approval, indulging in the delicious flavor.
"I Prince Albus." He answered, very matter-of-factly.
He threw his wand to the side and hooked his fingers around the bottom seam of his sweat soaked shirt. He sat up slightly in order to pull it up and over his head, throwing it in the same direction as his wand went.
Did that mean Harry was going to let him down in the morning? Surely he would come forward now if this felt as real to him as it did for Draco. They could do their quick exchanges of
"PAPA!" Draco registered the cry as Albus, who was now charging towards his father as fast as his little legs could take him. With quick thinking, Draco's hand settled on the wallpaper and searched the area for the light switch.
“What?”
“Tell me about you.  I know the myths and legends, but I want to know you.”  He smiled.
"Potter?"  Draco arched a brow as Harry poured.  Harry tried to ignore the use of his last name and the pull it had in his stomach.
“Why would I lie to you?”  I called out.  He stopped.  “What could I gain from it?”  He turned around and glared at me.
They looked each other up and down, admiring the views.  Draco’s eyes locked on the dark hair covering Harry’s broad, tanned chest, trailing down his navel to his green pants.    Draco laid back on the red sheets, legs slightly apart.  Harry’s gaze travelled upwards from Draco’s knees to his pants, his fingers longing to touch the soft downy hair on Draco’s thighs.
“No sir.”
“Okay, but you were just nice to Potter!  Don’t you think he’ll think something’s up?”  Her eyes were wide and she looked a bit like Aunt Bellatrix’s Azkaban poster.
"I'm..."  Draco took a deep breath.  "I'm gay."
“Don’t say his name for heaven’s sake!”  I raised my hand, trying to get him to just stop yelling for just a moment.
All the lesson we were supposed to learn
“You attended the Ball with Parkinson’s daughter right?” I smiled.
“Did you do everything on the third line, Potter?”
“Oh is that it then?”  Draco twisted in Harry’s arms to face him, smiling incredulously.  “Had nothing to do with you poking me in the ribs every time you wanted a kiss?”  Harry rolled his eyes.
“Hey,” Pansy said warmly.  Blaise raised a brow at us.
“Well, what now?”  He laughed.
your footsteps in case you step out of line.”  He flinched slightly, seeming to restrain himself from either punching me or kissing me.  I hoped it was the latter but knew it likely wasn’t.
"Never say never, P— Evans." Harry shot him a thankful glance before grabbing their drinks from the bar. "Remember, we haven't spoken in well over a year." He handed off one of the drinks and Draco downed nearly half of it in one go. Harry raised his eyebrows but raised his own bottle in a silent "cheers" and followed suit.
“Then try not to get detention.”  I straightened his glasses as he tiredly glared at me.  He looked more like an angry, sleep-deprived kitten and I suppressed a giggle.
"Nothing,"  Harry would mumble before picking up his book.  Draco would silently curse before turning back to his own book.  It would take him at least ten minutes before he could focus again.
“What about it?” She asked sweetly, batting her eyes.
“Okay.  Well, I grew up with my aunt and uncle and their son Dudley.  They made me live in a cupboard under the stairs.  I was given Dudley’s hand-me-downs and ate scraps.  They never told me about magic and tried to keep my Hogwarts letter from me until Hagrid showed up and took me away on my birthday.”  I stared at him.  “What?”  He asked so innocently.
“Everything will be alright!  I promise you.”  Her fingers gently brushed through the gel in my hair, calming me.
As Dumbledore dismissed the feast, Pansy and I did our best to round up the First Years and show them to the Dungeons.  Once we were satisfied with how they had sorted out, Pansy and I left for my room.  Blaise was already there, hanging his clothes in his wardrobe.
“Not yet fully sir.”
“Do you know the Unforgivable Curses?”
"I'm gonna get you some water,"  Harry muttered, stroking a stray hair from Draco's face.  He nodded slowly and closed his eyes.  When Harry returned with the glass, Draco had slumped onto his side, giggling at nothing in particular.  Harry sat down the glass, shaking his head and smiling to himself as he sat Draco back upright.  "Drink,"  Harry handed him the glass.
“Fine!”  She yelled.  “Fine Draco. You know what?”  She poked my chest.  “You should go now.”  She winked as I stood up.
“You forget you’re a wizard.  Obliviate exists,”  Pansy interrupted.  I sighed.  She was right.
“Are you saying battling Voldemort isn’t worth it?” He yelled.  I took a deep breath.
.  Be careful with your correspondences.  And your acquaintances,” My mother whispered.  She gave me a small, knowing smile.  My throat tightened.
“Draco.  Call me, Draco.”  I stepped towards him.  “If we’re going to even try to be friends, let alone anything else, I want you to call me Draco.”  I smiled.  I liked being kind to him.
"How was I supposed to know I'd fall for you?"  Harry gave up searching the crowd and let himself go.  Draco watched in awe, now just an arms length from the barricade.  Harry captivated the stage, pulling every bit of energy out of his body and the air around him.  "Grey eyes and lips of lies and that dark tattoo!"  Draco froze.  Grey eyes... that dark tattoo... was he...  "Love seems like a curse, you made that true.  What the hell am I supposed to do with you?"  Harry was leaning down to the audience now, reaching his hand out to a handful of fans.  The opening riff poured through the speakers again as Harry turned away and began moving across the stage.  He scanned the crowd again, just for shits and giggles, until his eyes caught on a specific man — a sharp face with pastel rainbow hair.  Harry paused for a moment before turning his back to the crowd and raising his arms into the air.  Sure, it rallied the crowd, but more so, Harry needed a moment to recuperate before the rest of the song.  Hell, the rest of the set.  There's no fucking way...
“There, now,” said Professor Umbridge sweetly.  I couldn’t help the sneer that formed on my face.  Her voice sounded like nails on a blackboard but with an out of tune orchestra backing it.  “That wasn’t too difficult, was it?  Wands away and quills out, please.”  I shared a look with Pansy; the order “wands away” has never yet been followed by a lesson we’ve found interesting. We slipped our wands into our bags and pulled out parchment and quills.  Professor Umbridge opened her handbag, extracted her own wand, which was an unusually short one, and tapped the blackboard sharply with it; words appeared on the board at once:
“And if Potter brings up the note?”  I began pacing again.  I might wear a hole in the floor before I ever get to the lake.
“I dragged you out here to actually tell you something!”  I whipped around, glaring at him.  “But since you seem to be in an intolerable mood—”
“He’s not really wrong honey.”  I rolled my eyes.  “Still! This is great!”  She gave me a big hug, and I laughed into her shoulder.
"Yeah, I'll join you soon." Harry smiled as the other three left the backstage area, leaving him sitting on an amp, nursing a stale tasting bottle of water. His skin felt on fire and muscles weak. He could feel his magic ripple under his skin in a way he hadn't felt in months. He couldn't decide if he wanted to drown his feelings in liquor, sleep for twelve hours or get lost in a crowd of sweaty bodies in the coloured lights. He only moved when the next band came through the hall, deciding it best to find his mates. As he left down the side ramp to the crowd, Harry's eyes caught on that sharp face again. Merlin's beard.
“Alright, mate.  But I want to know at some point.”  I laughed and nodded.
“You raised your son well, Lucius. This will no doubt help you. He will be useful.” Voldemort slipped out of the room as fast as he had come in, the snake refusing to leave his side. As soon as he was out of sight, my mother rushed to my side again. I let out a shaky breath.
“Well, we ended up arguing about his mouthing off to Umbridge and it got way too heated.  He started going off about…”  I waved my fork around and Pansy nodded understanding.  “The current situation with the Ministry and all and he went off about defending ourselves and all that.  Of course, I can’t tell him just how complicated it all is!  My father…”  I waved the fork again, knowing I couldn’t say exactly what was on my mind.  She nodded again, staring down at the table.  “Well, you know.  He knows too, just not the extent of it.  So then he stormed off before we could really even see each other.  We met today during lunch and he apologised and said how stressed he’s been and all and I said it was alright.  He’s got detention tonight but we agreed to meet while I’m on my Prefect rounds.”  She nodded again.
And I didn't think I'd make it out alive.
Hoping that the rest of the day would go by without any problems, yet, just before Potions, Crabbe shoved me to show two-thirds of the Golden Trio approaching.
"Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars, hearing guitars, like someone in love," He murmured along.  Draco felt his breath hitch listening to Harry.  His voice was softer than when he would dramatically sing to ballads; it was rough, deep and gravelly, contrasting sweetly with Sinatra's smooth as honey vibrato.  Draco couldn't help but be entirely mesmerised by Harry's lips as he sang, the way they shaped around each vowel.  Draco let his head loll to the side as he lazily petted Mittens and watched Harry.  "Sometimes the things I do astound me, mostly whenever you're around me."  Draco smiled lazily as Mittens purred in his lap.
"Potter?" Draco called out as Harry walked towards him.
“Draco!” Harry yelled.  I could see the fear and anger rolling off of him.  “I’m not wrong and I’m not lying!”  I took a deep breath.  My whole body was shaking and I could feel Harry watching intently.
Of course, he didn't show Draco the picture but gently woke him up with a mug of hangover cure.  Draco wouldn't let Harry go to the shelter that day.  Instead, he forced Harry to take him to the pet shop to pick out a bright green collar, plush white bed and more toys than he'd ever seen Dudley open on his birthday.  Draco nearly pranced to the tag machine to get a silver heart-shaped tag with 'Mittens' written in cursive.
I wish I knew who you were.
“Cedric Diggory,” Everyone said.  I glanced to the Gryffindor table to see Harry proudly lifting his glass, his jaw trembling slightly.  Everyone sat back down as Dumbledore lowered his hands.
"Look!"  Harry said with as much enthusiasm as a kid on Christmas morning, holding up the kitten.  Draco's eyes widened and he started shaking his head.
“Not about the chapter, no,” said Hermione.
“Not much sir. I don’t associate with
March crept by, melting into April and Easter break.  I stayed at Hogwarts during the break as my father had “business to deal with”.  The letter I received from him was short and overly formal, even for him.  The first time I read it over, I got an aching feeling in my stomach.  He’s only ever that short and formal when it’s about something he doesn’t want me to know about.  He sent a package of sweets as well alongside a brief note from my mother wishing me well.  I read the letter over a couple more times, trying to decipher what “business” he could possibly be dealing with.  Sure, he had an interest in the dark arts and artefacts but he never let it come in the way of holidays.  My mother would always force him to be home for holidays, and as much as he initially grumbled, I’d catch him stealing smiles at my mother, obviously thankful she had made him stay.  This would be the first Easter that I could remember that we wouldn’t all be together.
“So, according to you, Cedric Diggory dropped dead of his own accord, did he?” Harry asked, his voice shaking.  A uniform gasp rang throughout the room.  I felt my throat close.  The last time I knew of Harry talking about this, he broke down in front of me.
How was I supposed to know I'd fall for you?
As Easter break ended, the halls filled again and we were all quickly swept away with school work again.  Spring washed onto the grounds, flowers springing up in unlikely places, trees blooming green once again, the sun staying out longer and longer until, by the end of April, we’d meet under blue skies and return under the slight cover of dusk.  I could feel myself lowering my guard every day that Harry and I spent together.  Every day I felt like I was closer to saying it to him — it felt truer and truer every day.  My spirits felt lighter as April melted into May, and May into June.  Harry, on the other hand, seemed to get tenser as the weeks went on.  I’d ask him almost every day what was wrong but he’d refuse to talk about whatever it was bothering him.  Instead, we’d talk about the horrible Charms essay we had due the next week, Professor Sprout’s ridiculous lectures, and have short arguments over Snape’s distribution of points which would end in laughing, possible wrestling and definitely kissing.  I tried my best to keep his mind off the tournament and whatever it was that was bothering him but I could see the way him, Hermione and Weasel would whisper in the hallways.  Something was going on between all three of them but I couldn’t place my finger on what.  I hoped it was just the tournament and their worries about Harry, but something told me it was something more.
“She’s also a professor and a ministry employ—”  I started calmly, but Harry clenched his jaw and pushed away slightly.
“Hey.”  I met him halfway.  “Before anything else, I just want to apolo-”
“Pansy, would you just leave it for now?”  I raised my voice, trying to start a ‘fight’.  She pursed her lips and crossed her arms.
“Shush, these halls don’t stay empty forever, you know.”  I shot him a glare, and he stopped smiling.  “Take this.” I shoved the note into his hand and smiled a bit.  “I’m also going to apologize in advance for these.”  I pressed the pin to show him the second message.  His face got red.  “Hey, I’m only doing it to keep appearances.  I didn’t make them.”
“What?”
"What, Potter? Trying to get me drunk?" Draco smirked and laughed. Harry glared at him, cheeks flushing slightly, before realising Draco's near-fatal mistake, Harry's eyes widening.
“Let’s see,”  He said, in his silkiest voice.  “Fifty points from Gryffindor and a detention each for Potter and Weasley.  Now get inside, or it’ll be a week’s worth of detentions.”  We all entered Potions and began class.
“Well, please don’t.”  He took a couple of steps towards me.  “I want to see where this goes.”
The rest of the class went by without a hitch.  The rest of the day seemed to drag on, Pansy consoling me every so often.  Our last class ended at three, leaving me with four hours to fret and worry.
“If you mean Professor Lupin, he was the best we ever —”
“I trust you.”  We ate in silence for a few minutes before the Trio walked in, looking varying levels of miserable.  Harry looked exhausted, his face dark and scowling.  They quickly sat down together and dove into the meal.
“Of course, my dear.”  We started down the nearly empty hall to potions.
"You alright?"  Harry asked quietly.  Draco swallowed thickly and nodded.
“So…”  He walked toward me again.
Now eye level with Draco, Harry was pleased to see the same soft down on Draco’s legs surrounding his very hard cock.  Bracing himself with his arms around Draco’s thighs and hands on his arse, Harry placed a light kiss on the tip before slowly encircling his cock with his mouth.  A quiet string of curses left Draco’s mouth as Harry bobbed his head, happily tasting the sweat lightly covering Draco.  He kneaded his hands gently into Draco’s arse.  He pulled off with a pop to look up at Draco.
I walked to the Common Room to meet Pansy.  She grinned and jumped out of the armchair she was sitting in.
“You go first.  Less suspicious.”
"Malfoy!  Malfoy wake up!"  Draco's eyes opened wide and he sat straight up, breathing heavily.  Harry didn't move his hands from Draco's shoulders but sat in front of him.
Draco pushed one last bit, so he was at the front of the crowd, earning him a kick in the shin from a girl who got pushed back, but he couldn't care less. Harry was now right in front of him. Just look here you bumbling idiot! And Harry did.
"No,"  He muttered.  "Absolutely not."
“I was going to apologise because I knew the moment it slipped out it was wrong.”  I sighed.  “I know I can be a bully, and frankly, I hate it.  But if I stopped, my father would notice, and I really don’t know what he would do, but I don’t want to risk it.  But, I promise you, I won’t ever say it again if it’s not completely necessary, and even then I’ll think twice.”  I took a deep breath.  Harry’s face was still hard set as he looked at me until he finally nodded.
“Hey,” I whispered once we were inside.
“Haven’t gotten the chance to see him yet.  I hope we can meet tomorrow.”  I sighed heavily.
“See you tonight?”
However, when he opened them again, the sun was streaming in through the window and he was met with the gentle snores from the man next to him.
“Yes, I can,” said Harry, turning back to Snape, his fingers clenched tightly around his wand.
“Yeah, I’ll go first.”  Harry smiled and squeezed my hand.  “See you soon,”  He whispered before walking back to the castle.  I stayed a few minutes after he walked in before going back to my room.
Love seems like a curse, you made that true,
“Pansy, what if someone sees us?”  I paced my room as Pansy reclined on my bed, painting her nails.  I had changed out of my formal robes into a comfortable jumper over my button-up and dress pants.
“Wait, what do you mean?”  I asked.  She shook her head.
“Yes, but look.” I held up the badge and she beamed.
Believe me, I never cried,
“You shouldn’t look so depressed after meeting with him, you know,” Pansy commented one Tuesday night in March as she followed me back into my room.  A week before, Rita Skeeter released a ridiculous story about Harry’s heart being broken by Hermione’s toying with both him and Krum, which I would not let Harry live down.  Every time I mentioned his obvious, undying love for Hermione, he’d groan and roll his eyes.
“That’s my name.  Don’t wear it out,”  Potter sneered.  I scowled.
“Right.”
"Let's get some breakfast, alright?"  Draco followed Harry downstairs a few minutes later to find him making pancakes. Draco sat at the table and just watched Harry cook. Harry always amazed Draco with the arsenal of classic rock songs he had memorised that he'd sing and bop to when he cooked and this morning was no different.  Harry was swaying his hips and mixing pancake batter.  Mittens weaved in between his feet, purring lightly, and Draco, despite a throbbing headache, overall aching body and slight terror of whatever happened when he blacked out the night before, he felt incredibly at peace and filled with warmth.
