Draco held up a hand to still the bloke’s nervous babbling. It was giving him a headache. When his head stopped spinning and his vision finally cleared, the first thing he saw was brilliant, green eyes gazing anxiously at him.
Harry stared at his boyfriend with wide, shining eyes. “You never told me any of that,” he said softly. Malfoy managed a sheepish grin and Harry leaned into him. “Come here.”
want me to make a meal out of whatever poor bastard got in your way?” the vampire asked with exaggerated innocence. He grinned sharply, clearly enjoying every bit of Father’s disgust. “You’ll have to excuse my uncouth deportment,
‘Harry’ ruffed happily and licked him again. This time, Draco bolted up with a yelp of alarm. The golden retriever puppy wagged his tail and pawed at him, yipping up a storm. Draco groaned and scrubbed at his face.
“So what do we really know about this kid?” James asked, in a last ditch attempt to distract her. Lily turned to him and he promptly seized an opportunity to edge in around her and rescue the wine. “You know,” he coaxed as he stirred some brandy in, “other than the basics.”
Draco obliged. “I wanted a Chihuahua,” he informed Potter, before slipping back into blessed slumber.
“I know what a Kneazle sounds like,” Nick huffed, sounding affronted. “I assure you, Friar, I may be dead but I’m no simpleton! There’s
He watched as Harry left him with one last smile to coach his brood. Brilliant. At least he had until tonight to formulate a new plan. Between Granger’s lack of progress and his own failure to communicate, he needed a new way to start the conversation.
“I told you I took a break from flying,” Draco mumbled. He swayed slightly and his head came to rest against Harry’s chest. Harry carded a hand through his hair and the Snitch — still locked between his fingers — fluttered unhappily. Draco smiled. “You didn’t open your gift.”
Draco has never been one to question his Father but right now he has to wonder. Does Lucius truly think he has any control here? That Potter can’t — or won’t — tear him to shreds the moment it sparks his fancy? This isn’t a werewolf or some street thug bought off with a handful of Galleons. Vampires...they played games. Deadly ones. And they didn’t lose too often.
His throat clenched around Draco’s hard, slick length and that was it. Draco thrust into his throat, arching and moaning as his climax hit. He flopped back on the bed, panting like he’d just run a marathon. Harry swallowed around Draco’s softening cock, drawing another hiss from him. Draco whined in weak protest and Harry released him, crawling his way up to kiss Draco’s lips.
“You say you can’t get the words out. Have you tried writing them down? Maybe a letter will help. Or you could visit Madam Pomfrey together and she could help you explain it.” Her tone gentled a bit. “These are fairly obvious solutions, you know. I don’t really believe you haven’t thought about them yourself.”
Al nodded fretfully and huddled against Draco. One green eye flitted back to the admittedly large and imposing snowman that James and Teddy had built yesterday. Draco grinned and ruffled his son’s hair gently.
“You have tiny hands,” he informed Hugo. That earned him a happy giggle and another round of petting. Draco raised an eyebrow.
Harry stared at it in silence for a few seconds, and then a grin crept up his lips. “You know I have other interests,” he said, reaching out.
Uncle Ron would probably get a laugh out of it, he thought morosely. Father and Dad? Maybe...not so much. He tried to keep his footsteps light as he crept past the dozing portrait guarding the entrance. Down the stairs, past the painting of the centaurs playing polo...
The clamour coming from the Hall was so loud, it almost made him falter. If it wasn’t for Granger trooping firmly at his side and whispering encouragements, he wasn’t sure he would have made it.
This was bad. He couldn’t get caught sneaking out — on his first night in the castle, no less! He would lose at least a hundred House points for this! All the Gryffindors would hate him.
“Of course not!” Draco sputtered. “I meant a real farm! Where he can run around and chase rabbits and...Harry, I
James cringed and swiped a shaky hand over his face. He hadn’t said much since Draco had arrived. Actually, he hadn’t even looked at his father once during his mumbled explanation, choosing instead to address his sheets. Draco had a feeling that the gravity of the situation was sinking in. Good. He wasn’t letting the boy off the hook that easily though. “Answer me, James,” he ordered in a tone that brooked no argument.
heaps of red, yellow and green blocks. He gurgled triumphantly at his handiwork and Draco rolled his eyes.
It hurt to hear it. Somehow, knowing that Harry wanted this, some version of this — it just made it worse. “Not with me,” Draco murmured. He drew his knees up to his chest. He wasn’t angry anymore, just sad. Sad for himself, and the baby. “You can’t tell me he wants
“James.” Father looked utterly stricken by this point. “I...can you please try for me? Can you just tell me what’s wrong?”
The Stomach Settling Draught from Pomfrey. The one that had been interfering with his casting all day.
Would he need a bezoar for this? Did they even have any in the Infirmary? Would he need to go to St Mungo’s?
The golden retriever ignored him and bolted at Harry like a bullet, whimpering in concern. Harry scratched his ears and murmured reassurances but the thrice-damned mongrel wasn’t convinced. He turned on Draco again, tail bristling in reproach.
But, as he wearily reminded himself, this wasn’t just about him anymore. He was responsible for more than just himself now and whether he liked it or not, so was Potter.
scared him so much, that he’d decided to reject him first. He didn’t want to give him a chance to break his heart, even if Harry had given him no reason to think he would.
have to do this alone, I swear. You may not be used to good things but...you’re going to have to get used to that.”
“Do you like it?” he asked haltingly. The flush deepened and he hoped to Salazar that Potter wouldn’t call him out on it. “Spending time with them, I mean.”
She didn’t realize that she was leaning forward until she slipped off her rock. With a squeal and a splash, Marina toppled off and into the water. The noise alerted the boys who broke away and turned to her. Grey and green gazes narrowed in accusation and Marina squirmed guiltily.
him.” His hands fly to cradle Harry’s face, desperate to convince him. Maybe it’s selfish. Maybe after hearing what Harry has been through, he should be understanding. But he just
Potter took a few seconds to process that. “You take applications for...you know what, never mind. How about we take this slow?”
he was dealing with. Draco’s heartbeat ticked up as he reached for the doorknob. There would be hell to pay if he was caught lurking but he
Harry rolled his eyes. “Okay, let’s put aside the fact that you’re morally reprehensible for a second. Assuming your little scheme works and Godric and Helena take to each other...”
“I didn’t sleep a wink all night,” Draco confirmed sulkily, tipping his head back to give Harry better access to his neck.
If James could stay out of the sodding Hospital Wing for the rest of the year, he could have it back by Christmas.
So, he sat himself behind him, heart skittering in his chest and looped his arms tight around his middle. “Alright, Potter,” he said. “Let’s do this.”
Draco’s anger evaporated with those two words. He knew James meant it. He knew James was sorry, that he was terrified of what could have come to pass and he knew that all James wanted right now was to be held and told it was okay. That Father loved him and forgave him and he would take care of it. He just didn’t know how to ask for it. He didn’t know if Draco would do that for him after what he’d put his family through.
“No,” he declared firmly. “I don’t know what possessed you to volunteer us for babysitting duty but you are not sticking me with Ginger Junior while you and Granger traipse off to the Ministry. Believe it, Potter, when I say no, I mean
Harry pursed his lips. “I think you should leave now,” he said firmly. “And you can think about whether this is important enough for you to get along with Godric or not.”
“Those were my favourite trousers,” Draco grumbled. But he shifted off Harry— carefully and slowly. Then he turned around to look his old nemesis in the face.
Draco nodded but refrained from making any promises. The truth was that he was done. If last night had proved anything...maybe he simply wasn’t
. A bead of blood trails from the wound in his neck to the ruined mess of his sheets and he whines — in protest, in need; he doesn’t
Draco sighed and let his head drop back against the chair. Finally. They were alone. He didn’t think he’d ever been this exhausted.
“And...I don’t know how you’re going to feel about it. In truth, I’m terrified about finding out. But you have to know. You just...you have to.”
“You don’t like me,” Draco said. He sounded so resigned about it, like hoping for anything more was pointless.
“You know,” he whispered in Draco ear and making him shiver. “I’m really glad I ran into you today.”
Understandably, this didn’t do much to reassure James. “So he’s a Slytherin, he’s Lucius Malfoy’s son and he hexed my kid,” he listed off dryly. “Remind me, why are we letting this boy in the house again?”
Draco groaned and stuffed the last of the pamphlets into a satchel before throwing it to the far end of the Boy’s Dorm. He fell back on his bed with a sigh, wondering why he was so tired. Was it the baby? The shock? Or was it because the bloody pamphlets had assured him it was
“I get it, you know.” Potter’s smile softened. “I know how complicated it is. We didn’t exactly go into this with a plan and I’m not going to lie, it will be rough when...if we…”
“...hardly the first pregnant man in wizard history, are you?” Pomfrey’s voice was drifting in and out of focus. Draco took a shaky, stuttering breath and rallied to pay attention. If this was happening to him, he probably needed all the facts. “I know it’s rare and you were obviously not expecting this, but there’s nothing to fret over just yet. Why, you’re only six weeks along.”
Draco gathered him up at once, holding him close. James held on with a death grip, anchoring himself to Draco as the tears flowed on and on.
Grimmauld Place was a sight these days. Draco emerged from the fireplace, still clutching Teddy like his life depended on it, and took a look around.
“Here,” the man with the gorgeous green eyes said, putting a gentle hand on his arm. “Let me help you up. Oh god, I’m such a klutz. I really am sorry...”
“As a matter of fact you are, Weasley,” Draco drawled, rolling his eyes. “You just walked in on Potter and I
anymore. “It doesn’t matter now. I’m handling the situation as best as I can. And I really have to go to class now so…” He pushed past Harry in a bid for freedom and he wasn’t even slightly surprised when a firm hand clamped around his forearm.
curdled inside him. It was no longer explosive. It was cold. It was unforgiving. It was an invocation against the universe itself for mocking him, for pushing him and driving him to insane retribution. And if he
was Draco Malfoy. Dressed in tailored robes sporting the Malfoy crest...well, James had to admit he certainly looked the part. Grey eyes, sharp features, white blond hair — yeah, that was
Draco slunk even further in his chair, if such a thing was possible. McGonagall eyed them both with steely suspicion, but Harry met her gaze frankly.
Lily shrugged. “It took you four years to figure out Sirius and Moony were together, you tell me.” Her green eyes lit up speculatively. “You know, if you really want to complain about Draco, I’ll bet Padfoot will join you. He loves bitching about family, you know that.”
Maybe, but that didn’t stop a father from worrying. That’s just how it was. His one job in the world was to protect Harry and keep him safe. Now he was all grown up and dating and that was bad enough but a
He looked a bit awkward and Marina smiled to put him at ease. She flipped her tail in the water and splashed to show she meant no harm. His smile widened and he came closer. “You’re a mermaid,” he said.
Al looked thoroughly unconvinced. Instead, he just held his arms out, silently demanding to be picked up. Draco obliged, allowing the little boy to hide in his neck.
“Of course you’re scared. James, you’re on your own for the first time in your life at a thousand-year-old institution with hundreds of your peers. It’s natural to be nervous, surely you didn’t expect to manage everything perfectly from day one? That —” Father sighed and shook his head, “— is an
The thief ran a hand through his atrociously messy black hair and flipped a page, apparently unaware of just how much danger he was in. Draco’s eyes narrowed as the bloke extended a hand and reached for the plate on his table. A plate of white chocolate scones topped with raspberry jam.
Lily smiled gently and brushed a kiss to his temple. “Oh, sweetheart,” she murmured. “I’m sorry tonight didn’t go the way you wanted.”
It may have been a reasonable request but Draco still felt slighted by it. This was just as much his Potion as hers and his grade depended on it too. “Fine,” he bit back. “Then I’ll stir.” He edged around her to reach for the stirrer.
“Gosh, I wonder why,” Harry muttered. He scowled blearily at his father, still grinning in the flames. “If you don’t return my boyfriend in two hours, I’m calling Mum. And I
“Like I said, you caught me mid-project. I could use a shower and I wouldn’t want to leave Teddy all by himself…”
“Yes. About that.” Father spoke up, sounding uncharacteristically hesitant. “I won’t deny that you have proven a valuable ally, Potter. However...”
He spotted several switch buttons too — the kind Muggles used to turn on lights or answer a door. Draco pushed one, half expecting a light to go off somewhere but nothing happened. Some small mirrors...at least they were doing what they were supposed to although Draco could hardly guess their purpose on the board. A metal spring welded with a hook; it extended when he pulled it and then sprung back into place. There was also a small section with fabric swatches, buttons and zippers. A shoelace, threaded with beads and tied up to make a zig zag across the board. And that thing, in the corner of the board...he didn’t recognize it. Draco’s eyes narrowed suspiciously. It was glued on too. Flat and squarish, with odd little buttons, numbered from 1 to 9 and the letters C and AC.
wouldn’t gawk at a bathroom. Perhaps, this boy needed to associate with a better crowd. Then he wouldn’t embarrass himself by looking so wonder-struck at some silly…
“I can’t!” Draco burst out. Why didn’t she understand? “I’ve tried, Granger. Everytime I get close I either freeze up or say something completely ridiculous! I
“I know you do.”  Father hesitated a moment before speaking up again. “I think we’d better get Dad in for this talk, hm? Can you wait a moment while I fetch him? I’ll be gone for a minute at most.”
“Must you be so crude, Potter?” Father sneered. “Surely we can discuss these things in a more genteel manner.”
Albus cheated to get an upper hand. Lily had a temper. Scorpius was impatient and lacked follow through when he didn’t see immediate results. And James...James was a reckless,
” Harry emerged from behind the telly-thingy, rubbing his head. He gaped at Ron incredulously. “Who said anything about ‘seducing’ Malfoy?” he demanded. “I just invited him over to watch a couple movies, that’s all. Merlin, Ron! We’ve talked about this before. Draco and I are just friends!”
His gaze drifted downwards. He opened his palm slowly. The Bean, pink and cheerful, sat there. Strawberry. Draco smiled, despite his morbid musings. He’d always liked the strawberry ones best. And mint and seabreeze. Would his...his baby have liked them too? Or would he — or she — have taken after...'him' instead? Rooting through the bag, determined to find the most obnoxious flavours — the cinnamons and the watermelons and the rainwaters?
Draco startled as a soft voice brushed his ear. He’d been so lost in thought he didn’t even notice that Potter had spotted him and come over. He blinked, looking up into warm, green eyes.
There was a brief flash of black and green and then Draco collided face first with and extremely solid…chest, he supposed it was a chest. Or a very warm, rather toned brick wall. Either way, it knocked all the breath out of him and then he was flailing and toppling down the hill with the solid chest slash brick wall firmly attached to him.
His insides twist and he wonders despairingly just when he fell so deep. It may have been when he was barely thirteen and happened upon the vampire for the first time. Or it might be right now, at this very moment. More likely, he thinks it’s been every moment in between, before and after.
“Can’t fault you for timing,” he muttered, absently drifting a hand over his stomach. Now that he thought about it, he could detect a barely perceptible curve under his touch. How had it escaped his notice before? He was usually so on top of things.
A chuckle rang out behind him. Draco turned around and saw Harry approaching with little Helga and Rowena tucked under each arm. An anxious Helena followed close behind, ever the overprotective mother.
Granger, being the unfathomably decent person that she was, hesitated a little. Draco sighed and gave her a small nudge forward. She’d done a lot for him but he couldn’t expect her to hold his hand through this. No, this part...this part he needed to do alone.
It makes his dead heart ache in ways he was sure he’d forgotten but it’s for the best. Draco deserves a life of his own. A true one. He’s too young and sheltered to understand what he’s asking for.
a fair point. “But only because he had to. There is a world of difference between taking a chance because there is no other choice and doing something stupid just because. I’d like to think we taught you better than that.”
With that, they departed from the corridor. Pansy emerged from the shadows, accompanied by a rather mutinous Theo.
“Mr Mal...Draco.” The switch to his first name just made it worse. It was another Healer thing, another useless platitude for Merlin-only-knows-what. His grip on the sheet tightened. He braced himself, preparing for the absolute worst because at this point, what else could it be?
Harry didn’t though. With point blank concentration, he pursued the golden orb’s trajectory, swerved against the beating wind and reached out.
“Something better be on fire, you little mandrake,” Draco snapped as he bolted in. He skidded to a halt when Hugo stared at him with teary, blue eyes and lifted his arms in a not so silent demand to be held.
that he needed space and perhaps it was best if they avoided each other for the rest of the school year. And after that...well, he would need to figure things out but once he submitted his research thesis, he could very well complete his NEWTS by correspondence. Perhaps he would return to the Manor. Mother would be happy to have him back and he still needed to break the news to her. He couldn’t imagine her reaction but he would rather risk it than spend one more second…
“Jamie,” Father spoke up softly when he still couldn’t bring himself to say anything. “You’re really starting to worry me.”
“Oh, well. It’s just with the NEWTS and...what have you got there?” Granger asked suddenly. She craned her neck to get a better look at his book. “A Comprehensive History of...
“They do when I’m around,” the bloke replied with a sheepish grin. He shrugged and held his hand out. “Hello, I’m Harry Potter. Your friendly, neighbourhood accident waiting to happen.”
A dark shadow moved in the corner. There was a glint of sharp fangs and thin, bloodless lips curling in a smile. The woman froze and her eyes widened. Draco swore he saw the exact moment when the horrifying realisation struck her. A scream caught in his throat as she turned around and came face to face with...
needs to be taken down a notch, I suggest we move on to designing a prank of epic proportions. I’m talking stuff of legends here. Abject humiliation! Pain and misery! A...”
He could think of at least one good reason right now. Draco turned to Granger. “Really?” he barked, when she gave him a guilty look and spread her hands. “
She pursed her lips, obviously trying to choose her next words delicately. “I don’t think it’s quite the same coming from me.”
. The fact that she’s a healthy, thoroughbred female with a gleaming coat and beautiful, brown eyes is a lucky coincidence. And don’t take that tone with me. It takes two to shag, Potter.”
“Draco, stop it!” Harry snapped. He looked frustrated and upset and it was all Draco could do not to Disapparate on the spot, wards be damned. “I just want to figure this out, okay? Please just talk to me.”
It took the bloke a second to figure out he was being glared daggers at. Eventually he extricated himself from his book and blinked at Draco. His brow furrowed and vivid green eyes narrowed in confusion. “Can I help you?”
This was it. This was the way. Granger and her hunger for knowledge was inescapable. He couldn’t count the number of times she’d cornered him to ‘discuss’ whatever stirring subject had caught her fancy. Her best friends couldn’t possibly be an exemption! Sooner or later, she would bring up male pregnancy in front of Potter and then the pieces would fall into place. Potter may not believe him but surely, he would believe Granger.
“There it is,” Potter praised, looking just as thrilled by her minute progress “A little more wrist in that swish and they’ll be drafting you into the DMLE before you know it.”
Still, it wasn’t exactly pleasant. His ears were ringing, he'd missed dinner and despite the relief of finally getting the truth off his chest, there was still the aftermath to deal with. The news would spread through the castle like Fiendfyre, if it hadn’t already. There would be gossip and speculation and eventually, the Prophet would get wind of it. He hadn’t even thought about breaking the news to Mother and then there was the matter of Harry’s adopted family. He could only speculate that the Weasleys would react about as well as McGonagall...
“You told Father you’d take what you wanted when you were ready.” His arms loop Harry’s neck, trying to channel warmth and comfort. “Were you going to take me?”
“Don’t think so,” Draco argued. “We covered everything in BDSM and this was the best way forward. You understand, of course. All in good fun.”
Potter tugged his arm, leading him to the board again. Teddy ignored them. He was still pushing, prodding and pulling at everything, utterly consumed. “See?” Potter grinned, gesturing to him. “Busy.”
It took a while but finally, Draco was able to extricate himself. One more twist and then he edged away from Harry and flopped back on his pillows with a grin, revelling in his freedom. Oh, it was glorious. He could breathe and move again and Draco had never been so grateful for the simple things.
Marina nodded reluctantly, but the dark-haired boy smirked. “Don’t believe her,” he advised. “She cheats.”
“So we’re back to last names again?” Harry asked quietly. He looked uncertain and sad, all of a sudden, and Draco’s determination nearly wavered. “Look, about last night. I don’t...really understand what’s going on anymore. All I know is we were, I don’t know, connecting. Then you ran off and I couldn’t find you anywhere. And okay, maybe I shouldn’t have but I was worried so I...looked you up in the Map
Finnigan was a lot more forthcoming. He sidled over and swung an arm around Draco’s shoulders. “It’ll be okay, Malfoy,” he purred, brushing bold fingers against Draco’s nape. “I’ll be right here with you through the whole thing.”
“I didn’t either, at first,” Potter replied. “But apparently, they’re very popular with Muggle families. Hermione told me all about them.” His hand was trailing the length of Draco’s arm as he spoke. Draco’s breath hitched in his throat. “They’re like little activity centres and they’re supposed to be great for building motor skills. Teddy’s learning all kinds of things right now. How small tools work and what he can do to make them work.” The hand was moving to the small of his back now and Draco was just barely keeping up with Potter’s words. “He’s learning how textures feel and how to unhook strings and open locks and hinges. It’s great for his development. And my peace of mind.” Draco frowned and Potter gave him a grin. “He runs off with my keys all the time. I can never find them.”
Harry was confused. This by itself wasn’t a very worrisome state of affairs because Harry was almost always confused when it came to his moody boyfriend. But for some reason, things felt different this time. Draco had been snarky and snappish all day and Harry just had this hunch that
“Your petty politics mean nothing to me,” the vampire drawled, studying the dregs of wine with a bored expression. “Regardless, consider it done. Same terms as always.”
“Shh,” Draco soothed, stroking his son’s hair gently. “It’s okay. Everything’s alright now, James. I promise.” His fingers ran through those brown locks as he spoke, gentle and reassuring. The motion was calming, like a balm for the ache in his heart. James was okay. James was safe. He was in Draco’s arms and he was going to be
“Hush, love,” he murmured, pressing a kiss to the wild, black curls. “It’s okay. We just need to cheer the snowman up, that’s all.”
Draco was utterly nonplussed. “I...think it’s bits of Muggle rubbish glued to a board,” he answered frankly. Potter looked even more amused now, and it was starting to annoy him. “The buttons don’t do anything,” Draco protested. “That switch thing doesn’t work. And what are the mirrors for?”
The shout rang out suddenly, scaring at least ten years off Harry’s life. He exchanged an alarmed look with his mother and then they were both running for the door, wands out and raised. Harry stumbled out on the porch, searching for the source of all the unholy screeching, prepared for anything from hexes to a literal punch up...
“Well, you’ll be happy to know you didn’t,” Draco replied coolly. “When you fell off your broom— a good twenty feet, by the way— Albus dove and tried to catch you. Of course by the time he made it to your side, you were in a hole in the ground with shattered ribs and a dislocated shoulder, but that’s hardly important. Rest assured, he didn’t catch the snitch so really, there’s
It was nearly midnight. There was not a sound in the bedroom save for the soft ticking of the alarm clock on his bedside table. Draco stared at the ceiling, quiet as a church mouse while he waited for Harry’s breathing to deepen.
Draco startled at the sudden interruption and whirled around. Potter stood in the doorway, holding two cups of steaming cocoa. “Malfoy,” he greeted, eyeing Draco cautiously.
“Who else would I support?” Draco asked, sounding genuinely confused. “The Arrows? Or Merlin forbid, the Chudley
“You can hold off,” Granger conceded. “But I think we both know what will happen if you do. The more you wait, the more reasons you’ll find not to do this.” She took a deep breath and met his eyes. “We’ve been in here for hours. It’s probably dinner time now so he’ll be in the Great Hall.”
The Floo flared up at six in the morning, bathing the corridors of their small flat in bright green. Harry muttered sullen curses under his breath as he stumbled, still half-asleep to the living room. If this was what he thought it was…
Draco made his way down the corridor to the refurbished classrooms on the fourth floor. He would have thought that after Lockhart’s disastrous attempt at reviving the Duelling Club, anyone with a modicum of sense would discourage overzealous children with wands to fling spells at each other.
Remus sighed and Sirius smirked and raised a glass. They watched as James disappeared through the fireplace.
“He was born Tom Riddle, but I knew him as Voldemort. I was nineteen when he struck my village. My parents... he killed them in front of me.” Harry’s mouth twists in a pained grimace. “All these years...three hundred years and I still don’t know
He can see Father’s expression in his mind’s eye — from the displeased twist of his mouth to the glint of discomfort in his eyes at the reminder of who, or rather
she gave him a pointed look – “are going to behave yourself. It’s not every day Harry asks to bring someone to dinner. The only other one who got that far was little Miss What’s-Her-Face.”
He glanced at Padfoot — a normally reliable source of support — but all he got was another shrug. “Harry’s got good instincts,” Sirius pointed out.
“So, I’m asking. Stay a little longer? Just for dinner?” Potter’s grin flashed against his throat. “I’ll let you play with my toys.”
Draco stumbled indoors, flushed, numb with cold and with a three year old wrapped around him. Albus mumbled in his sleep and snuffled into his neck. Draco patted him absently, his eyes roving the room and landing on the warm, roaring fire and almost immediately after, on Harry.
“No, no, no!” Draco whispered, watching the horrifying scene unfold on the tellavision screen. “She’s going in there! Why is she going in there?!”
What, indeed. Draco sighed and leaned into Harry’s touch, letting him draw him closer. “I suppose I’m not used to good things happening to me,” he murmured. “If you didn’t...I didn’t want the baby to know how that feels, I suppose.”
Potter looked justifiably nonplussed. “Yeah,” he replied slowly. “We’re pretty good friends in case you hadn’t noticed.”
“I’ve got a couple brooms in the shed,” James was saying, already dragging Draco towards said shed. “You ever played Seeker’s Tag on a Firebolt?”
boyfriend with an arm tucked firmly around him and a muscular leg pinning him in place. Harry nuzzled at his neck, making contented purring noises all the while and Draco groaned in dismay.
And Draco turned to Harry Potter, with fire in his eyes, grabbed him by the lapels and hauled him up.
So far, par for the course. But then it got worse. Theo committed the ultimate blasphemy by revealing the season finale of
“I have to tell him, don't I?” he mumbled. His hand braced against his stomach. He could feel the beginnings of a curve now, or maybe it was just his overtaxed imagination. But this child was real. They had been real for eight weeks. And they deserved better.
He popped another bean in his mouth as he reviewed his essay on Anti Apparition Charms. The taste of watermelon spread over his tongue, cool and refreshing. Apparently, it was growing on him. The books said it was much too soon for cravings but even so, he could already sense the slight changing of his tastes. He wondered how intense they would eventually get.
“Camera!” Draco blurted out. Harry raised an amused eyebrow at his outburst and Draco suppressed a groan. Really, he wished he could kick himself. “I mean, I see you have a camera,” he amended quickly.
“Thanks. That won’t give me nightmares or anything.” He shook his head and turned to Potter. “You up for a quick game, mate? Ginny’s been going on and on about a rematch after you showed her up last week.”
With nothing to do but wait around while Potter straightened himself out, Draco took him at his word and made himself at home. Teddy was more than happy to accompany him as he took a round of the house.
“Very well,” she intoned after a tense spell of silence. “I suppose I should address the students — no doubt they have several questions after your little display. You two may speak here and you
Godric nuzzled affectionately at Salazar before bounding over and licking Draco’s hand. He rolled his eyes and indulged the mutt with a petting. “Oh, sure,” he drawled. “I get you a girlfriend and suddenly I’m the best thing since old chewed up slippers, yeah?”
Harry swallowed and reached out to take his hands. “I’m so sorry,” he whispered. “I was so angry...and you’ve been...Merlin, Draco. The stress! Are you okay? Is the…”
Granger cleared her throat and shifted around him to reach for the bitter root. She started slicing, firmly avoiding eye contact with him. Draco’s brow furrowed at her uncharacteristically quiet demeanor. Normally, when they partnered up, he could barely get her to shut up. Now she wouldn’t even look at him.
Harry’s smile widened and the grip on Draco’s shoulder tightened almost imperceptibly. “All the pretty ones do,” he whispered.
Draco scoffed and leaned against a wall, trying to get his twisting insides to settle. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d been this nervous. How was he going to break the news to Potter? And even if he managed to get the words out, how would Potter take it? Would he be upset? Angry? Or...maybe he wouldn’t care. Maybe this baby wouldn’t mean a thing to him. And why would it when…
Harry’s heart leapt. He scrambled up at once, trying and failing to ignore the slight flutter of hope in his chest. “What’s the matter?”
and set it firmly in front of him. He could still hear Harry waffling behind him, clearly wondering whether to leave or stay.
They approached the table with slow, measured steps. Harry’s lips pursed as they approached and he doubled down on glaring at the table, pointedly refusing to spare a glance for Draco. His fork clenched in his fist and he looked like he wanted nothing more than to leave. Nonetheless, he stayed put.
Draco nodded along and let her prattle at him as he mused. Good. This was good. The wheels were in motion. Sooner or later, Granger would crack and Potter would be subjected to a seminar on male pregnancy. And once the bait was set, it was merely a question of easing him into the truth. Eventually, even that obtuse idiot would see the light. Draco was sure of it.
Draco huffed and crossed his arms, still looking put out and sulky and adorable. Harry had to resist the urge to just wrap him up in his arms and keep him there. “You know,” he offered instead, “it might help if we watched the whole thing two or three times. It won’t seem so scary then.”
Enough was enough. This incident was the last straw as far as Draco was concerned. He loved his children dearly but he wasn’t blind to their faults.
Marina giggled and nodded, enjoying the way his eyes lit up with mirth. “Well then,” he drawled, pulling idly at his pants and slipping them down, ever so slowly. “You’re going to
His bare toes curled into the plush carpet. Draco wrapped his arms around his middle as he huddled by the door. As a child, he was never allowed in this part of the house. He still had vague recollections of house-elves sternly shooing him away whenever he ventured near.
lurking in the shadows. Harry wavers. But in the end, the choice is already made. Lucius Malfoy, of all people, made it.
Draco swallowed against the dryness in his throat, despite the thrill curling in his chest. Sometimes, he forgot that there
“Cho Chang?” James put in helpfully. He remembered the bright, young brunette from about a year ago. Pretty, smart, solid Puddlemere U fan…he’d actually liked her. Lily, on the other hand…James snorted. “You just don’t like her because she said your chicken was a little dry.” Lily glared at him and he wisely changed the subject. “How about the Weasley girl? Wasn’t Harry seeing her? She was cute.”
Hermione,” Harry retorted, which just confirmed Draco’s suspicions that this was some elaborate scheme to ruin his life. Of course, the extent of Weasley’s schemes revolved around how to maximise his sugar quill intake but Granger was certainly devious enough to cook something up.
Of course his snarky attempt to change the subject fell flat. Harry smiled and nudged him, obviously expecting a real answer. “Draco,” he chided. “I told you I wanted to be with you. I want everything with you. This child is...a miracle but I have
“Very well,” Draco replied with a put upon sigh. “But you’re going to have to follow my lead, Harry. It’s serious business taking care of a baby, you know. You have to have a
Potter shuffled his bunny feet and scratched his ear awkwardly. “How about a date first?” he offered tentatively. “Do you want to go to Hogsmeade with me next weekend?”
the ones being rude here.” He tapped her frame in gentle admonishment, but his eyes were kind. “Hasn’t anyone told you it’s not nice to spy on people?”
“There is no easy way to say this, I’m afraid.” She sighed and her eyes softened a little. “You’re pregnant.”
“I don’t really want to talk about it,” Theo informed him with a sniff. “Do you want my help or not?”
“Moving on!” Draco interrupted as he indulged in some more gratuitous gavel banging. Pansy winced and rubbed her temples discreetly. “As I was saying,” Draco continued grandly, “the first order of business is our Bi-monthly Performance Review. I think I can speak for all members of the BDSM community...”
sanity. He only had one idea left and if this was it, so be it. He grabbed Weasley’s plate, turned a deaf ear to his protests
Potter turned to him, looking put out and mutinous. “Come on,” he grumbled, heading for the den. “We should probably set up for the
“Well, that’s the most important thing,” Father said firmly. A faint smile played on his lips as he settled down, making himself comfortable. “As long as you’re alright, we can take care of everything else together.”
“Not this time, darling,” he cooed, stroking her in an effort to calm her down. “Maybe we can go for a run to the park later, yeah?”
Draco stiffened. Harry went pale as a sheet. They turned around, still hand in hand, no doubt sealing their dark fates. Headmistress McGonagall loomed over them, mouth pinched and eyes sparking. Behind her, the entire student body thronged, clearly twitching to get the scandal mills working overtime.
Malfoy bolted up with a jerk. “Not guilty!” he blurted, looking around blearily. “Don’ want Argentina...”
He went back to his studies with a sigh of relief, letting Granger’s excited chattering fade away to background noise. Just a little longer and this would all be over.
Draco shook his head, amazed at his own lack of foresight. He should have known, considering who he was dealing with. A frank conversation was clearly the wrong way to go here and honestly, he should have expected that — when had he and Potter
Potions went by in a blur. Draco couldn’t even begin to concentrate on his Invisibility Potion, and frankly, he couldn’t care less about it at the moment. He felt sick to his stomach, his head was spinning and the worst of all? Harry’s crestfallen, heartbroken face flashing before his eyes in an accusing infinite loop.
The door opened a crack, allowing him a glimpse inside. Father looked stiff and wary as he handed a wineglass to their guest. The man —
“Okay. Look, Potter. I...about what we’ve...you know, been doing. There’s something you should know. I...that is,
“It was only a vague suspicion at first,” Granger clarified. “When you gave me the book, I didn’t really think much of it. But then I found this.” She rummaged around in her satchel and pulled something out. Draco took it, immediately recognizing it as one of his many pamphlets. “You left it in the book,” Granger went on. “I recognised your handwriting, you had every milestone circled. But I still didn’t realise…”
Teddy squealed and nearly fell out of his arms as Draco entered the little playroom. He put him down hurriedly and paused to take a look around.
“Harry, please!” He was definitely shrieking now. “I can’t...I don’t know anything about children! What if he cries? What if I drop him? Oh gods, what if he needs to go to the bathroom?!”
“Have care how you speak to me, creature,” he sneered. His heart was rabbiting and he knew that Potter could see right through his flimsy pretension. But Father was watching him and he still had a part to play.
of course he was nice to small children — but this was different. Potter had a genuine connection with these kids. He listened to them and mentored them and they clearly adored him. Even now, they were swarming him like eager kittens, demanding his attention and time. And he indulged them happily, giving them his all like he did with everything else.
Potter reached out for his hand. His fingers wrapped around Draco’s wrist, pulling him closer. Draco followed without protest— momentarily distracted by the flash of anticipation in Potter’s green eyes— and then he remembered why he was still so upset and promptly pushed Potter away.
Harry rolled his eyes and pushed him towards the bedroom. “You will be when I’m through with you,” he promised.
Well, he could do one of those, at least. Draco toed off his shoes and fell back on the narrow bed. He was asleep before his head hit the pillow.
“I’ve got it,” Draco muttered, raising his wand to perform a Slicing Spell. His wand sputtered and flickered in his grasp, and then suddenly their table was covered in mounds of bitter root. Draco winced and several students cast puzzled glances in their direction.
“I…ended things with him today,” he admitted guiltily. Granger’s eyes went wide and he braced for impact. “I don’t know why, before you ask. I couldn’t tell him the truth and it was too much so I...did this instead.”
to tell Harry. And despite what Pomfrey said, it was becoming increasingly clear to him that he was going to do this by himself. That’s just how it was. And frankly, after last night, the thought of even
“Do you have a better idea?” Draco demanded. At any rate, it was out, for better or worse. He had done his bit.

amused. The man had him on a technicality, but he was not going out without a fight. “I will take them from you,” he threatened. “They are
“Sap,” Father accused with an eye-roll. But he smiled anyway and let Dad loop an arm around his shoulders. “And you’re not going to die in Herbology. As much as it pains me to say, Professor Longbottom is an expert and you couldn’t be in safer hands.”
“Malfoy!” Granger snapped and snatched up the stirrer again, blocking his path quite firmly now. Honestly, what was up with her? Draco watched in disbelief as she crossed her arms and turned the full force of her indignant glare on him. “I really,
“I’m afraid I can’t do that.” She sighed and shook her head as he opened his mouth to argue. “Mr Malfoy, you’ve suffered a massive shock. You’re obviously distraught and while I sympathise, as your Healer, I cannot endorse any medication until you’re emotionally stable. This decision is life altering and not to be taken lightly.
When they finally came to rest at the bottom of the hill, Draco’s head was swimming and he was aware of very little save a volley of excited barks and the fact that the chest— and whoever it was attached to— was on top of him and pressing into his face. Draco coughed on some snow and shook himself to clear the ringing in his head.
Oh. Warmth crept up on him suddenly, taking the edge of his anger. Harry looked so...worried for him, for them. How had he ever feared that this man would reject him? He was so good. So very good. Draco should have trusted him from the very beginning.
Well, that was that. James withdrew and reached out to tune the wireless. If they were really doing this whole bonding thing, Quidditch scores were a good place to start. And after all this, he would be remiss not to give this boy a fair shot.
Like any good Slytherin, Theo laughed long and hard at his predicament. Nevertheless, after ten minutes of snickering, he rallied to the cause.
Eventually, Potter did seem to get the hint. The invites stopped, the small talk petered out. Potter made himself scarce during the study group and Draco made sure to avoid the Quidditch Pitch. They didn’t talk outside of class, they kept their distance in the hall, even the glances they shared were quick and fleeting. And if they still allowed themselves the occasional indulgence of the Room of Requirement, that was fine. It wasn’t real, after all. So what did a few moments of weakness matter?
forgotten about Teddy in all the chaos. Maybe he wasn’t so alone after all. And as he stared at his family, framed by the flames, he figured things could be a lot worse. Even if things didn’t work out here, at least he would always have people who loved him and believed in him.
in the hallways too long, now would we?” The portly ghost glanced into the alcove again. James could swear the Friar flashed him a small smile before proceeding to herd his companion off.
There’s an answering chuckle, one Draco instantly recognised. His pulse quickened in Pavlovian response.
The dark haired boy looked around the bathroom, clearly taken aback by the sheer size of it. The mermaid sniffed in disdain. Her blond was
“Of course, dearest.” Father smirked and turned back to James, his expression going from playful to appropriately serious in an instant. “And as for you, young man… you would have made an exceptional Slytherin. And you’ll make an excellent Gryffindor. I have no doubt in my mind that you would have done both Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw proud as well. You have
James nearly stumbled. He paled rapidly and ducked into the nearest alcove, his heart pounding in his chest. Oh Merlin,
racks his exhausted body and his legs twitch in surrender, still wrapped around the vampire’s waist. Harry’s smile softens and he busses a kiss to Draco’s head before uncoupling them gently.
Yes. Yes, he could. Merlin help him, he had to. But damn it if it didn’t still scare the living daylights out of him.
Draco frowned as Pomfrey visibly struggled for words. He’d never known the mediwitch to be anything but efficiency incarnate. The silence grew tense and his insides twisted.
In minutes, he was comfortably ensconced in an armchair at his best friends’ flat, twirling a glass of Ogden’s and watching tiny Teddy play with his blocks. Teddy gurgled happily and waved a chubby fist at the grown-ups. James couldn’t help but smile fondly. Godric, had Harry ever been this little? Every time he saw Teddy, his heart soared with happiness for his friends. It had taken years before they were even seriously considered for adoption, thanks to Remus’s affliction. But Teddy was here at last, and they couldn’t be happier. James raised his glass in a silent toast before turning to Sirius.
“And what did your creepy little brother have to say about Draco Malfoy?” James demanded. Teddy gurgled urgently and toddled over to his father. James bit back on a resigned sigh as Sirius was immediately distracted. He Shifted — much to Teddy’s delight — and barked affably, nuzzling and fussing as the child grabbed at his fur with tiny fists.
They watched in silence as the Snitch flapped its wings in Harry’s grip. Harry hesitated, then ran a tentative thumb over it’s smooth surface. For a few moments, there was nothing. Draco’s grip on him tightened and then…
The sound of his name from Potter’s lips brought Draco back to the present. He cleared his throat and took a small step back, hoisting Teddy back up. “He did,” he answered. Teddy turned to him at once at the sound of his voice and Draco smiled, giving him a gentle bounce. “We read stories, fed the ducks and painted on the terrace. Or rather, we painted
image was going to stick. But then, he’d been dealing with unresolved feelings for Potter since Fourth Year so it was hardly a revelation. No point in revisiting that mess, certainly.
“I can’t!” Draco yelled back. “You need to hear this, Potter! I haven’t come this far to fall back!”
He didn’t have the emotional maturity to raise a child! And even if he could get past that hurdle, there was the family name that could scarcely afford any more tarnish to think of. And his parents...oh Salazar, what would they say? They would balk at a child born out of wedlock. At the very least, they would insist on marriage. And how was he supposed to manage that?
Then the creature smiled and raised his glass. “But that would ruin a perfectly good business relationship, wouldn’t it?
Draco could live with that. He subsided with a barely there smirk and went back to watching the dogs. Given enough time, he was sure he could convince Potter to keep
He couldn’t stay here. He couldn’t. He would fail his classes or get laughed off the Quidditch Pitch or… or die in Herbology or something just as horrible and embarrassing. And then he would lose a thousand House Points and then he would get
that brought him back. James cleared his throat and disentangled himself to peer over his son’s shoulder. Lily grinned and winked at him, before gesturing subtly to her right.
him, it does diminish the man in his eyes. There’s a nervous quality to Father’s haughty tone. It’s embarrassing, Draco thinks. Certainly not how a man in charge behaves around his supposed underlings.
Draco suppressed a smirk and stayed put, waiting until James was fast asleep. Then he disentangled himself, pressed a kiss to the child’s forehead and took his leave.
practiced smile on Lily. Her eyes lit up, and so did Harry’s. “If it’s not too forward, I brought a little something for your table.” James bit back on a scoff as Malfoy produced a massive bouquet of Madonna Lilies and offered them to…oh right, lilies for Lily.
“Mate.” The bloke shook his head slowly, looking over Draco with a hint of concern. “You’re not making any sense. Are you having a stroke or something?”
“And you’re stuck with me,” Potter retorted with a shameless smirk. “Go on and make yourself comfortable, yeah? We can get takeout for dinner or something.”
“I understand,” he replied with a sincere nod. But his lips were pressed together and he was obviously trying not to laugh and Draco was starting to see red.
Godric ruffed in agreement and clambered on to the sofa, situating himself firmly between them. Draco was willing to bet every Galleon he had that it was not a coincidence. The mongrel commenced licking Harry, wagging his tail in Draco’s face as he did.
“That’s my boy. Now, do you still want us to come get you or do you want to give this thing another try?”
Potter, if possible, looked even more gormless. And then, the light of comprehension dawned in his eyes. Draco waited with bated breath for the other shoe to drop.
Draco groaned and clutched his stomach. He felt worse than he ever had before. It felt like his very insides were revolting now. What the hell…?!
“Malfoy? Is that you?” a voice called from somewhere in the interiors of the house, followed by the patter of footsteps.
It’s not a shock. He’s always known the truth, even if it remains unspoken. He was seven when he first came upon one of Father’s ‘business associates’. He was racing through the Manor, playing a game of hide-and-seek with the portraits, when a huge, brutish man with pointed yellow teeth blocked his path. The man, whom he would later come to know as the notorious werewolf Fenrir Greyback, grinned at him and purred, “Aren’t you a cute little morsel?”
“What?!”  Weasley yelped. Granger just gaped and Harry had started rubbing his temples and muttering about how he should have stayed upstairs.
succumbing to a breakdown like Potter had suggested, then Merlin as his witness, he was damn well taking
It’s only then that Draco realises he’s been talking out loud this whole time. He attempts a scathing glare but well, that’s the downside to having a vampire lover.
The thought was depressing enough to take the wind out of his sails. It was one thing for Potter to be upset but the idea of him
It was a cold night. The moon hung bright in the sky. A pleasing breeze rippled through. Harry breathed in the calm and smiled.
“I know how much you like deals, Lucius. One last bargain, for old times' sake.” He flexes his grip; a suggestion of a threat. “I take him and you keep your golden life with all the trappings. Everything you’ve worked so hard to build. The money. The power.
Draco stiffened on instinct. The woman on the screen was approaching the crypt. Her shaking hand wrapped around an ornate handle. Draco gasped and hid his face in his hands, only daring to peek through his fingers. Finnigan squeezed his shoulders gently but it was poor comfort. The woman swung the door of the crypt open.
most of them, Mr Potter! And you, Mr Malfoy. I would have thought, you at least, would have a sense of propriety…”
provide such a reason. But business was business and any worthy Slytherin knew that opportunities came hand-in-hand with risk.
“Potter?” he called, when the man himself showed no signs of appearing and greeting his guests like a civilized wizard.
Potter wasn’t having any of it. “Malfoy!” he snapped, shaking Draco frantically. “Are you okay? Malfoy, talk to me! Say something!”
He rolled his eyes as Harry froze in his tracks, visibly floundering for an excuse. Ron scoffed and headed for the door. “Have fun on your non date,” he called over his shoulder. “Don’t forget to hang a sock on the door!”
, little Malfoy,” Potter broke in. “By all means, intrude anytime. And remember,” his teeth were stark against the pallor of his skin. Draco wondered what they’d look like clamped around a pulsing throat, “should you need anything during your
He was so caught up in his thoughts, he barely noticed the portrait shifting at the entrance. It wasn’t until Potter ran smack bang into him that he looked up with a surprised yelp.
now. But Potter just made a small exasperated noise in his throat and shook his head. “Merlin, it’s always studying with you two.”
As if she would ever dream of such a thing. Marina craned her neck, eager to get a better look. The tie came off, and so did the shirt. His back was turned, and she noticed that it was lean and lightly muscled. It made her want to reach out and run her hands all over him. Stupid two-dimensional painting…oh well, at least she could watch.
Harry nudged something forward with his left skate. Draco’s coffee cup rolled among the orange and brown leaves, his name still scrawled messily on it.
“Oh, so they’ve stopped coming into the bedroom to watch you and Daphne shag?” Draco asked innocently.
Yes, Father would rage (thankfully, behind bars) and Mother would fret and write long, tearful letters. People would judge him, far more than they already did. His plans for the future would have to wait, his life would never be the same, everything was going to get
“Honestly, I’m surprised it took so long,” he replied. “I was expecting this conversation weeks ago.”
Draco watched in stunned, impressed silence as Potter took control, guiding the child with gentle encouragement and demonstration. He was patient and persistent and when Sophie was ready to try again, he helped her cast. Small sparks flew from the wand this time and Sophie’s face lit up with delight.
Harry grinned to himself and took a deep breath, revelling in the crisp chill and freshness of a lovely December morning. He was out for his walk and while the climb uphill was steep and slow, the view was most certainly worth it. The whole world was cast in a blanket of pristine white. From where he was standing, Harry could gaze down the small hillock and into the woods just beyond. Tall spruce and pines dotted the landscape, their branches specks of green and gleaming white in the sun.
His parents exchanged looks. Father arched an eyebrow, Dad hummed thoughtfully. James tried very hard not to sigh in annoyance. The silent conversations… that was one thing he didn’t miss. Right now, he just wanted them to say
Baby Snitch buzzed in contentment and curled a wing around his finger. Harry’s grin widened and he carefully closed his hand around it, letting it rest in his palm again.
He trailed off as his eyes focused on Harry slowly. Malfoy yawned and rubbed his eyes. “Harry? What time’s it?”
“I’m okay. I think.” Harry chuckled too, and shook his head. “I guess it’s still sinking in.” He turned to Draco with a soft, hopeful smile. “Tell me it’s true again?”
“I suppose I’ll ask the obvious question,” Father spoke up after a span of silence. “Why do you think you don’t belong in Gryffindor?”
“...didn’t think anyone would be here right now,” Granger prattled, pulling out a gigantic tome from her bag and setting it on the table with a loud
It’s definitely not the answer Draco wants. Patience has never been one of his virtues, not then and
He was up the stairs and in Al’s bedroom in record time. Al turned over as Draco tucked him in, one sleepy eye opening to look at him.
But it was better than nothing. And work with it, he would. Harry was coming over now, reluctantly but still. Draco pulled out his wand, aimed it at the plate and thought the words loud and clear in his head.
Draco flushed, a little embarrassed by his evidently obvious fretting. Maybe the hormones were finally catching up to him.
“I know what will help,” Potter murmured into his hair. “Do you...remember what we talked about the other day? About spending time together? Just the two of us?”
Draco grinned and followed without protest. “I’ll sleep late tomorrow,” he replied. “Maybe right here, if things go according to plan.”
is…I suppose it was too much to ask to get along right from the start.” He gave James a cautious glance. “Maybe we just need to spend more time together?” James shrugged in reply and Draco took a deep breath, clearly steeling himself for what he had to say next. “Look, Mr. Potter. I realise you might not want to hear this right now, but I think it’s important for you to know. Harry…he’s my everything. He means the world to me and — assuming that he’s alright with it — I plan to spend the rest of my life with him. So, I would strongly suggest that you get used to me because…well, I’m not going anywhere.”
Draco raised an eyebrow as he entered his study, only to find it already occupied. His son was perched on the window sill, watching the world outside.
It was only a few moments later that he heard dual footsteps returning to the fireplace. Then Dad was crouching to peer at him, worried and confused and running an agitated hand through his messy, black hair.
Draco gave up and closed his eyes, making himself as comfortable as possible. Well, tomorrow was another day. Sooner or later he
Of course, being twelve year old boys, they both thought it was hilarious and so they’d spent the remainder of the evening, slowly upping the ante. Mother was gracious enough to ignore them for a large part of it but when Draco’s peas spelled out
“Both of us,” Father added quickly. Dad grinned and squeezed his hand, and James made a face on pure instinct.
Draco picked him up again, if only to stop him from running inside and spending the rest of the season under his bed.
“I’m going home,” he announced, stepping away and resolutely ignoring the crushed look on Potter’s face. “Goodbye.”
James whooped and threw an arm around Draco’s shoulders, jostling him playfully. “You’re alright, kid. Say, did you play back at school?”
“Draco, listen to me.” Harry pulled him up and cupped his face in gentle hands. “I love you. I want a life with you and our child. This...this is it for me. I know we started a certain way and we have a ton of history to get past, but I’ve known how I feel about you for a really long time. And you will
Several things happened at once. The vampire lunged for his victim, Longbottom cursed a blue streak, Thomas flailed and knocked over a glass and Draco screamed in terror, flung his arms around Finnigan and buried his face in his shoulder. He thought he heard Finnigan chuckle but he was too overwrought to bother.
James managed a weak grin at that and curled into Draco’s embrace again. “Love you too,” he replied, stifling a yawn. “Will you be leaving soon?”
“Stay focused,” she advised as they entered. “The only person you need to concentrate on is Harry. Everything else is background noise. Okay?”
She had a point. He had thought about it and there were any number of ways he could have broken the news to Harry. Instead he’d been on swings and roundabouts, putting it off, weaving and dodging...all because he was scared. The idea of Harry rejecting him, rejecting
The words tumbled out of him in a rush, before he could freeze up again. Potter blinked in sudden, abrupt surprise and Draco’s hands clenched against the desk.
“You can always have another heir,” he cajoles. “Rebuild the family if Draco were to disappear. But ask yourself, Lucius, will you ever be Minister for Magic on your own?”
“They wrote a book about it, didn’t they?” Draco muttered, snatching the book back. Wonderful. Just perfect. He finally hooked a Gryffindor and it was the wrong one! Merlin help him, Granger was like a crup with a bone when she found something new to study. Now she wouldn’t shut up about it until…
Draco woke slowly and groggily, struggling to regain his faculties. He cracked a wary eye open, frowning as he processed his surroundings. He was covered in blankets and lying on a couch that was not his own, in a room that was also not his own. Additionally, he had been divested of his clothing and was clad only his boxers. Those thankfully, were his own.
Draco sighed heavily and flopped down on his bed. He was alone in the dorms while his classmates took advantage of the fresh air and sunshine. It was just as well — there was very little privacy to be afforded in a room full of almost grown men falling over each other. And the Room of Requirement, for whatever reason, would not make itself available to him without Potter. He had the vaguest sense that the Room had not forgotten — nor forgiven — the incident with the Fiendfyre just yet. There would be a ways to go before anyone or anything in this castle had reason to trust him again. He tried not to dwell on it too much. Still, that left him with very little time and few options and if religiously avoiding polite society got him the solitude he needed, so be it.
William was not convinced. He whimpered and pawed fretfully at Draco, sending him sprawling on his back. Then he settled himself on Draco’s lap, snuffling and whimpering apologetically. “Oh, so you’re sorry now, are you?” Draco grumbled. “This happens to be your fault, I’ll have you know.”
She turned on her heel and swept from the room. Draco watched warily as she paused at the doors for a moment.
“It might interest you to know,” Father went on smoothly, “that your Dad was a wreck when he came to Hogwarts too. Not to mention, he spent half his Second Year convinced the Hat had made a mistake and he should have been Sorted in Slytherin.” He scoffed and rolled his eyes. “As if.”
in his throat and his ears and he could sense the vampire’s interest. He could see it in the twitch of his smile, the way those jade eyes trailed downwards...
Draco emitted a startled yip at the sudden outburst and Finnigan promptly took the opportunity to pull him closer.
“Wine?” Father’s tone was treading a fine line between openly contemptuous and barely civil. “I’m afraid we’re fresh out of your...poison of choice.”
In fact, most of his fellow Slytherins had taken the coward’s way out and refused to attend altogether. He hadn’t, though. For reasons that remained a mystery to him, Draco felt obligated to return to the school he’d betrayed. And on most days, he didn’t regret his foolhardy decision. With every cautious nod from Longbottom, every awkward almost-a-conversation with the Patil twins, every study group session with Granger and whoever else still cared about their NEWTS at this point, things were slowly sliding back into some semblance of normal. It was...good, against all odds. It was what he needed.
Mid sulk however, something changed. Marina looked up with mild interest as the door slid open. Ooh! She eyed the blond with interest. Now here was something to look at. He was a tall boy, lithe with sharp features. His grey eyes reminded her of stormy nights over the sea, and his hair was
Draco glanced up, to find himself surrounded by wide-eyed First Years. He jumped and Potter startled, clearing his throat and quickly removing his arm from Draco’s shoulders. More innocent blinking ensued, although Draco did notice a couple of small Slytherins shoot each other knowing glances.
Now he couldn’t even do his schoolwork without messing up. Had he always been this much of a failure at everything? Honestly, he couldn’t think of a single thing in his life that was going right at this point.
Harry sighed regretfully and ruffled Draco’s hair instead. “I’ll be right here,” he murmured, shifting back a bit. “On my side of the bed. You just get your rest, okay?”
Harry stared at him. Malfoy blinked but quickly recovered with a small, sheepish smile. As for Lily…well, it took all his Auror training not to quail at the look she gave him. James swallowed. Suddenly, his throat felt very dry. Where was that over-spiced mulled wine when he needed it?
James wasn’t sure he could take it anymore. He speared a piece of roast with his fork and choked it down, coughing around the liberally seasoned meat.
“You’re so good with Teddy,” Potter murmured. “You love him so much and he adores you and it shows. You’re so
“Well, that’s my cue then,” he announced, giving them a terse nod. “Have a good game, Potter. Perhaps we might speak when you’re
“We’re going to get through this,” he promised softly. If he didn’t know better, he would swear he felt a little flutter under his fingertips. He chuckled softly and resumed his petting. “I’ll figure it out, I promise. Whatever happens, it will always be you and me.”
Harry falls silent again. But then he leans forward and presses a kiss to Draco’s head. “Think it over,” he says quietly. “Sleep on it. If you still want this tomorrow, I will honour your choice.”
Draco’s breathy gasps quickened and moans spilt from his lips as Harry sucked gently at the head of his cock. Draco whined and his hands tightened into Harry’s hair, pushing him further. Harry obliged and took Draco in his throat in one fluid motion.
Draco rakes sharp nails down his back, only to gasp when Harry thrusts his hips in retaliation. Another wave of
It took a while but ultimately, Albus donned his mittens and snow boots and followed Draco outside, keeping a firm hold on his hand and skittering behind him as soon as the snowman was in view.
Remus gave him a fond look and took a seat too, shifting his attention to James easily. “Why the sudden interest in Draco Malfoy?”
“No,” James answered at once, because really, he hadn’t done anything wrong. He was just a kid who wanted his boyfriend’s parents to like him. “No, you didn’t, Draco. It’s just…”
Draco stared back, mirroring the confounded expression. Did...did Potter not know what babies were? Was he supposed to have the
Draco’s heart surged. He pushed the plate of scones over to Harry again. Harry raised his eyebrow a fraction and Draco smiled shyly at him.
“I have an idea,” he declared, talking firmly over Finnigan. He turned to the man and offered a smile of his own. “Why don’t you just move the party downstairs? Then we can all watch these ‘movies’ Potter keeps going on about.” And yes, maybe Draco’s voice had a bit of an angry hiss to it, but all in all, he thought he comported himself very well. “What do you say, Potter?” Draco edged, with a sharp smile. “Just us
No wonder they liked each other so much. Harry was wild and spontaneous and carefree, and Draco was cultured and poised and polished. Wasn’t that a thing, opposites attract? It must be, he decided. What other explanation could there
...and apparently, it was never going to happen. Draco smiled and ruffled his hair gently. “I will always be there for you,” he promised. “Even if you are the most infuriating child I have ever come across. And I knew your Dad when he was your age so that is saying something.”
James considered it. A part of him still missed home, and he knew it wouldn’t just go away. But that sick, heavy feeling in his chest was lifting by the minute. For the first time since he set foot in Hogwarts, he actually felt like he could make it here. Maybe… maybe even grow to like it in time. It would never replace
Draco cleared his throat, smoothed down his robes and took an authoritative stand at the podium. He cast a discreet
“Nothing,” Draco soothed, stroking Harry's hair and pushing him back on the bed. He had to fight to keep a frantic note out of his voice. “Go to sleep, Harry. It’s okay...”
Pomfrey was reluctant to let him go; she was of the mind that he needed more rest. Still, well-intentioned as that was, even he knew that staring at the Infirmary ceiling for the rest of the school year was not a sustainable way forward. And as much as he wanted to, he couldn’t miss his classes. Not if he wanted to graduate in time.
The Snitch quivered in his grip. It’s wings fluttered violently before extending and wrapping all the way around its form. A golden glowing light encased the orb, growing steadily brighter — until it resembled the stars twinkling above them. And then, when the light grew so bright that Harry blinked and Draco was sure he would have to look away, it disappeared. And the Snitch unfurled its wings, revealing itself again.
“Come on,” she laughed, herding her baffled boy indoors. “Let’s get you some pudding. And we’ll make a plate for your father and his new best friend too.”
Harry laughed again and kissed his forehead. “I grabbed it when I was all mad at you and storming out. I just had this feeling I’d need it.”
“I’ve been thinking,” Potter went on. His thumbs were stroking now, gliding over Draco’s skin in an almost reassuring way. “I know it’s a lot for you but I would really like to...not avoid you all the time. Not that the other part isn’t fun because oh
giving Harry up — not without a fight. “You’re not him.” He pushes forward, presses his lips against Harry’s. “If you were, I’d be dead.” Harry hesitates. His hands flex against Draco’s hips, as if debating whether to push him away. Draco wraps his legs tight around him, ignoring his exasperated growl. He’s just realised something… and he needs to know.
Draco gave up as Harry went about coddling his pampered pet again. “I’m just saying the farm is an option,” he muttered.
His footsteps faltered slightly. Last night, he’d resolved to come clean to Potter. And he still intended to, he
It’s a jarring reminder of the distance between them. He curls up in his sheets, ignoring the ache in his chest as Harry pulls on a shirt. The black garment slips over his pale, lean body.
Harry just tuned out her fretting and opened the door. He stopped short and a grin broke out on his face as he took in the sight in front of him.
“Mm, Harry?” He’s sliding in and out of sleep already but there’s still something he needs to know.  “What happened to him? Tom Riddle?”
There was another length of tense silence. It was Longbottom who spoke first. “Well, it seems you two have some things to talk about. We’ll just get out of your way. Thanks for the party, Harry. It was...yeah, bye.”
, Draco. And it helps that you look like you walked out of my fantasies. Everytime you come here with him, all I want to do is ask you to stay a little longer.”
For some absurd reason, his throat clenched at the thought. Draco cursed and rubbed his eyes viciously. For Salazar’s sake! He needed to stop doing this. He’d made his decision. Come tomorrow, this would be over. And if he kept talking to it like an insane person…if he got stupidly attached to it...
that was the worst of it! How was he supposed to tell Father the truth? That it wouldn't matter if he were in Gryffindor or Slytherin or the others, he
And just like that, the dam broke. James made a choked sound in his throat as he tried to stifle a sob, and then his shoulders were shaking violently and he was crying like the world has fallen to pieces around him.
. She had even threatened to take away House Points if he came to his next check up by himself. Draco didn’t even know how that worked since he wasn’t technically a Slytherin anymore, but he wasn’t eager to find out.
Al heaved a sigh of relief and settled in again. Draco smiled and bussed a kiss to his head, before turning out the lights and shutting the door with a soft click.
Potter raised his eyebrows in frank surprise. Apparently, he hadn’t expected an actual conversation. “I do,” he answered, after a beat of silence. “They’re really smart, you know. Eager to learn and try new things. And they, I don’t know…” Potter trailed off and scrubbed the back of his head, looking a little embarrassed himself. “They don’t think of me as ‘The Saviour’ or whatever. I’m just the bloke who teaches them new spells. It’s...nice, I guess.”
“You do that, Head Auror.” Lily’s answering laugh was all amusement and fond exasperation. “But be back in an hour. The boys will be here by then, and I need you to set the table.”
He struggled for words but they wouldn’t come. Instead, his eyes were prickling and his throat felt too tight and heavy. James swiped his sleeve over his eyes angrily. This was so
“Look,” Potter cut in gently. “I know you’re used to being good at everything. You get Os and Es in all your classes, right?” Little Ravenclaw scrubbed her face and nodded, looking just a tad mollified. Potter grinned and pressed the wand in her fingers. “Sometimes, you just don’t get it right on your first try. I know I didn’t. That’s why we practice. Now take a breather and try again, okay? Just relax.”
“Potter,” Draco cut in firmly, ignoring the obvious look of surprised hurt on Harry’s face. “I apologise for my conduct last night and I understand that you were worried but circumstances were...beyond my control. That’s all I can say.”
Draco made a sound in his throat that had most of the table scattering away for safety. A wave of magic swept out from him, buoyed by two insane weeks of abject rage and frustration. Several cups shattered. Longbottom’s roast caught fire and Finnigan’s shepherd’s pie exploded.
terrace.” The house elves would have a time of getting Teddy’s handiwork off the marble flooring, but he didn’t think they’d mind. They were utterly besotted with him.
— sprawled on the chaise accepted the offering, but there was no mistaking the glint of humour in his green eyes when Father quickly retreated.
The memory brought a fresh ache to this chest, but he couldn't turn back after all this. It was now or never, he decided. With a quick breath to steel himself, he settled down in front of the fire and tossed a pinch of powder into the flames.
“Well, it’s a good thing he’s distracted then,” Potter retorted. His hold tightened. His lips brushed the shell of Draco’s ear. He smelled like mint and pine and a little wood-dust, and Draco’s struggles were ceasing and his body was going limp against his bloody will. Potter chuckled and angled his head, letting his lips brush down Draco’s jawline now. It was utterly unfair and Draco wasn’t sure which end was up anymore.
“It’s a noble profession,” James cut in pointedly. Harry frowned and glanced uncertainly at Lily, who pursed her lips. James kept his penetrating gaze trained on Malfoy. “Funny, I had you figured for a politician. Like your old man.”
Draco nearly jumped out of his skin as Granger’s greeting rang out. The witch breezed past him — summarily ignoring Madame Pince’s annoyed
Draco snapped defensively. Potter’s lips twitched and he looked like he was valiantly trying to hold back a smile. Draco glared at him. “Well, it doesn’t matter now anyway. You should have said something and you didn’t and it hurt my feelings when you told Weasley we were just friends.”
“So that’s how it is.” Harry chuckled and flicked his fingers. The Firebolt sped to him and Draco barely had a moment to be impressed by that easy display of wandless magic before Potter was beckoning to him. “Come on,” he said. “Let’s go chase it down.”
Not that he would ever tell James and Teddy that their artistic abilities were anything less than stellar, of course. But he had to admit the snowman left a lot to be desired. It was lopsided, for one thing. It didn’t have a hat or a scarf. The eyes were crooked and the smile looked more like a grimace.
to hear what Potter had to say. This was going to change everything and things were already so confusing. He was only just getting around the idea of being a parent himself and...and maybe it was too complicated. Even for the Boy Who Lived.
“Yes, yes. I know you want to see Potter,” Draco grumbled. “Merlin knows you prefer him to me, as you should.” He settled Teddy on his hip and cast a quick Cleaning Charm on the baby's hands. The last thing he needed was Potter finding fault with his handling of their shared charge. He knew it was another thing he should be ‘grateful’ for — that both Potter and Andromeda supported his spending time with Teddy — and he was. But, with Potter...well, there would always be some tension there.
He was aware of Albus watching his every move, but Draco just kept at it. Still, when he heard little feet pattering towards him and a small, gloved hand reached for the carrot, he smiled.
A few days later, she was sunning herself on her rock when the door opened again. Marina looked up, half expecting the gorgeous blond boy.
They’d subsided so far on small talk and the occasional slip into their old ‘bickering’ — as Andromeda liked to call it — but...well, Draco supposed he was still waiting for the other shoe to drop. Potter had shown no signs of wanting to change their arrangement — Draco had weekends with Teddy, while Potter and Andromeda shared the week — but it still worried him that he might someday. And that Teddy wouldn’t miss him if he did.
And what better time than now? They were finally alone. No interruptions. Nothing at all to distract from the inevitable conversation.
“There are options, of course,” Pomfrey said. If she disapproved, she was careful not to show it. “I have some leaflets in my files, I’ll make a package for you to...think things over.”
Oh. Oh, good. James held his breath, praying they would move on soon. Another inch to the right and the Friar would surely spot him.
“You changed,” Draco mumbles. It sounds petulant, but he doesn't care. Harry’s had worse from him. “If you wanted, you could... change me.”
Although, in all fairness, he probably deserved at least part of the blame for his reputation. In hindsight, he
It would be a horrible death too—something involving cheese graters and sea salt. Draco was creative. He could improvise.
He was still waffling between knocking on Potter’s door and running home and begging off the whole thing entirely when he felt a tap on his shoulder.
The lights went on. The screen went blank. Draco blinked in confusion as he sat up, disentangling himself from an equally confused Finnigan. Longbottom and Thomas exchanged perplexed glances before turning to Potter.
“I said,” he repeated slowly and meaningfully, “there’s a baby. Potter, there is a baby. Please tell me you understand and I don’t have to break out the finger puppets.”
It was a board, that much he was certain off. Wooden, stuck to a wall, placed at about Teddy’s height. So it was definitely meant for him. But what really caught Draco’s eye was the strange collection of bits and pieces attached to the board. They were mostly Muggle odds and ends. Some of them were just metal bolts and latches for doors. Just...stuck to the board, seemingly without purpose. Draco pulled one to test it. The latch opened as he slid it and then shut when he slid it back. It didn’t open or close anything, so it was utterly devoid of function. And that wasn’t even half of it.
Granger’s fists hit the table, surprising everyone including herself. “Sorry,” she muttered, flushing furiously as the table stared. Harry blinked at her in confusion but she gathered herself and leaned over a perplexed Weasley to hiss at him. “Listen to him,” she ordered. “This is important!”
Draco glanced at his torn sleeve and suppressed a sigh. “It’s okay,” he replied. “These things happen.”
“Yeah?” James perked up at the mention of Tonks. The kid was his best Auror, now that Kingsley had officially moved on to politics. “I didn’t know they were friends.”
“They’ll leave us alone long enough to shag,” Draco finished. “Isn’t it wonderful how things just work out all on their own?”
“Male pregnancy?” Granger whispered, sounding utterly awed.”That’s amazing! How many cases are there? Is it common? Is it rare? On an average, what factors contribute to the success or failure…”
He got another cheeky grin in response. “I wouldn’t expect you to. Besides, you clearly need them more than I do. Now come on, sit down and stop being homicidal for a minute.”
Of course. Draco rolled his eyes and gathered him close. “Alright,” he sighed, raising his wand and lighting the fireplace. “Let’s go see your godfather then.”
Right. Because he’s a vampire and Draco is a fragile human. If Harry ever did lose control — be it hunger or lust — it will be his end. As long as they’re together, Harry will always have to curb his instincts. To be
Longbottom’s look was stern and reproachful. “Harry seems to think differently. Really, Seamus, there are boundaries.”
Surely, if he wrote home and explained to his parents that he was sick with Dragonpox, they would come pick him up? They couldn’t
His eyes fluttered shut. The exhaustion took him over and he curled into the covers. Tomorrow, he reflected tiredly, was going to be...eventful. Pomfrey would be expecting him and he could only hope she meant what she said about helping him. He-
Harry caught up to him with quick strides, blocking Draco’s path firmly. “Oh thank Godric,” he said. His hands flew to his hair, pushing through it in an agitated motion. “I’ve been looking everywhere for you! You just ran off and...at first I thought you went to the dorms but then you weren’t there. And then you weren’t at breakfast and then you missed class! Do you have any idea how worried...”
Potter cleared his throat and scuffed his shoe against the carpet. Draco rolled his eyes and turned to face him, quirking an eyebrow. Potter ducked his head again, looking suitably ashamed of himself.
you okay?” he ventured helplessly. Fearfully. “Is this a breakdown? Because I...I don’t know what else to think right now.”
What he does know is that it’s too late to question it now. Even if a small, sensible part of him still feared for his life every time the creature glanced at him.
As he made his way back to the Eighth Year Quarters, suffering a wary glance from a gaggle of Ravenclaw Third Years, he was reminded of how little support he could expect through this whole...thing. He had the better quarter of a year left at Hogwarts and he would most certainly start to show by then. Soon, those looks and glances would turn to whispers. Nudges and discreet side-eyes. If the scrutiny didn’t drive him mad, the rumours certainly would.
Even Draco— who had once reduced a barista to tears over a tall, half-caf latte that turned out to be venti, decaf cappuccino— couldn’t find it in himself to berate someone who was so clearly apologetic.
The door of the bathroom slid open. Marina frowned as the magic alerted her to a visitor. At this time of night? Intrigued, the mermaid poked her head out of the water. Her eyes widened as she caught sight of the intruders.
Potter’s voice was soft and hopeful and it just stoked Draco’s irritation. He pursed his lips and looked the prat right in the eye as he spoke.
“Wow,” Ron quipped. “So, explain. How do you plan to seduce Malfoy if he’s going to spend the whole night shaking like a leaf under your bed?”
“Draco Malfoy,” Draco mumbled, swallowing around his scone and taking the offered hand. “Thanks for...for the...”
He raised his fist. Draco laughed as the Snitch buzzed petulantly, firmly ensconced in Harry’s fingers. Harry whooped and pulled the broom up. He drifted into a lazy glide, circling the Pitch a few times before and performing a totally unnecessary loop before heading back to solid ground.
“We’re all fine,” Draco added sharply. He gave Potter an icy glance. “Perhaps you should focus more on the movie and less on Finnigan.”
”I promise,” James said without a moment’s hesitation. He lifted his head to look at Draco uncertainly. “Are you still angry, Father?”
“You,” Potter went on, “are going to ace the NEWTS. You’re smart, talented and you’ve got no reason to worry this much. With the amount of work you’re putting in, you might just give Mione a run for her money. Also, please don’t tell her I said that. I really want to live.”
Draco cleared his throat and lifted his chin, trying his absolute best to look affronted. “I don’t think I like your insinuations,” he told Harry loftily. “Helena is my companion, my best
He busied himself with arranging a pile of blocks on the floor. Children liked shapes and colours, right? He had just started putting the yellow and green blocks in a little heap when Hugo protested.
“Oh, Draco.” Harry pulled him closer, carding a careful hand through his hair and pressing a kiss to his head. “Please tell me you know different now. Please tell me you know that I would never, ever leave you. Both of you.”
One week in. He’d been to Pomfrey again. Received another batch of potions. Sat through a stern lecture on
Lily waved a hand to shush him. She was trying to keep a straight face, but a stifled laugh escaped her anyway. “Just let it play out, baby,” she told him. “Just…let them go.”
Potter’s eyes widened and for a second he looked like he was having second thoughts. But then he flashed Draco a tentative smile. “Well, they don’t call me a Gryffindor for nothing. See you next weekend, Malfoy. I...look forward to it.”
“It’s not a date!” Harry exclaimed impatiently. “We’re just two friends catching up. Besides, this is Draco’s first time watching a movie and I want it to be fun for him. Friends do that, you know.”
“And you’re called an idiot,” Draco grumbled, putting up a decidedly half-hearted struggle. “Let go of me, you cretin. Your godson is right over there.”
Somehow, he just knew it in his bones. If Harry turned away from him now, they would never fix this. He would never be a part of Draco’s life or the baby’s. And that thought terrified him more than anything else in the world.
Malfoy smiled faintly and turned to Harry. “He did,” he said softly. “Harry’s always so…he just does what makes him happy. He could have been an Auror like you, Mr. Potter. It would have been safe, sensible thing to do.” He glanced briefly at James. “But he wanted to work with Magical Creatures, so that’s what he did. Honestly, I thought he was mad but…I realised that he’d inspired me. Harry made me want to find my own way. He showed me that I didn’t have to be what was expected of me. So, after a bit of soul searching, I told my parents I was going to be a Curse Breaker and that was it. Of course, Father was
Harry hummed in acquiescence and settled down. Then his brow furrowed as he realised that Draco was on the other side of the bed. “What’re you doin’ there?” he mumbled, reaching out and grabbing Draco’s arm to pull him over. “Get over here.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “It’s true. You’re going to be a father. Our baby is eight weeks along, very opinionated and loves those horrid watermelon beans you enjoy.” His heart flew when Harry’s grin widened in unmistakable delight. “I can tell she loves you, you know,” he said softly. “There’s a...feeling whenever you’re around. She seems content in your presence.” He hadn’t noticed it before but now, now that he finally had a moment with Harry, he could finally focus on that curious, blissful sense deep inside him. That wasn’t him, he knew it. That...that was her.
Tiny Ravenclaw emitted a screech of pure frustration and chucked her wand to the floor. “I’m done!” she announced, voice wavering a bit as she turned to Potter. Draco braced for a tantrum of epic proportions. He wasn’t disappointed. “I can’t do it and I quit and I’m never duelling
“Confident, are you?” he teased gently. His green eyes sparked with mischief and Draco abruptly decided that they were done talking now. He leaned over Harry, clearly intending to pick up where he had left off. And he was doing a pretty good job at it too...
was one way to describe the Malfoys. Also, uptight, puritanical, snobbish and so painfully conformist he’d bet they still brewed their tea in brass cauldrons and bestowed ceremonial beatings on their house-elves. In summation, he was not a fan and he didn’t understand how Lily could be so calm about all of…well,
The thrice damned thing fell with a loud crash and Harry’s eyes snapped open. He got up and looked around with sleepy, bleary eyes.
“Are you sick?” Harry demanded, looking honestly, heartbreakingly worried for him. “Is that what this is all about?”
shot up the length of his spine. It took all his wherewithal — not to mention, the toddler ten feet away — to step away and out of the man’s grip.
. Why he picked us. Then, before I had even begun to mourn them... it was done. He remade me. Turned me into
you would know.” There was a ripple of movement — barely perceptible to the naked eye — as he shifted his stance. Father tensed and even Draco couldn’t help the hitch in his breath.
The other boy’s gaze darkened, even as his cheeks coloured. “At this point, I don’t give a damn,” he growled, letting his appreciative green eyes roam his lover’s frame. “So long as what happens in the Prefects Bathroom, stays there.”
He did know that. Deep down, he knew this was real. And yet, he didn’t dare tempt fate by saying it out loud. Some fears...they would stay with him forever. But having Harry here made it bearable.
James stared, baffled as the Friar gave his friend a stern look. Nick trailed off, looking rather nonplussed himself. And then his expression turned to one of dawning comprehension.
At least he learned to pay closer attention to his surroundings after that incident. Now that he was looking, there was no mistaking the unsavoury lot slithering in and out of that study. It wasn’t just the werewolves with their leers and gristly smiles. It was the goblins with their beady eyes and doublespeak, armed with reams of classified parchment and departing with clinking purses. It was the denizens of Knockturn Alley — the Borgins and Burkes, the Cobbs and Fletchers — obsequious, fawning, bearing gifts for
He’s eighteen now — fresh out of Hogwarts and on his way to a vaunted career at the Ministry like every Malfoy before him. And yet,
“I’m not good with figuring my feelings out,” Potter admitted quietly. “I guess it was just easier for me to pretend we were friends.” Draco’s glare intensified and Potter held his hands up in a gesture of placation. “But I would have worked it out eventually!”
Harry waved him off and buried his head under a cushion. The hiss of the Floo faded away with the sounds of his boyfriend and his father excitedly swapping Quidditch strategies for the day.
Oh, for the love of Neptune...very well, she would humour the nice, handsome boy. Marina rolled her eyes before pressing a hand up against them. His answering chuckle made her smile. He had a nice laugh…
Harry looked utterly miserable. He was barely paying attention, even though Weasley was prattling on next to him, and he was pushing his food around with a wan, lifeless energy. It was awful and the guilt nearly made him cave.
“I’m sorry about what I said to Ron,” he said. “It wasn’t true, I know that now. I...I really like you, Draco.”
Dinner progressed, as dinners tend to do. James glared sullenly into his wine, resolutely ignoring the conversation around him despite Lily’s watchful eye. Everyone seemed to be doing just fine without his input anyway. Malfoy was having no trouble holding court. So far, he’d been a model guest — making easy conversation, showering Lily with compliments on everything from her Charms work to the food, liberally summoning wine…no doubt it was all those etiquette lessons Lucius Malfoy had obviously sprung for.
The other Eighth Years were staring now, some of them craning back in their seats to catch a look. Harry’s fists clenched. He looked like he was seriously considering going for his wand. Draco braced himself, even as one hand slid discreetly to his stomach in a bid for protection.
His vision cleared. He hadn’t even realised he’d been tearing up. Granger was watching him with wide eyes, her hands splayed in a placating gesture.
They never really talked about it, and maybe that was Draco’s fault. Potter had tried in the beginning — in that clumsy, determined way of his. An invite to Hogsmeade. Another game of Seeker’s Tag. Did Draco want to take a walk sometime? Maybe they could do that Potions essay together.
“Oh yes, you did a stellar job,” Harry retorted dryly. “What with the mumbling and the snitches and fleeing from the sight of me. It’s a wonder I didn’t catch on.”
needed that scone. Perhaps it was foolish, but somehow he just knew that the moment he felt that white chocolate melting in his mouth, with that buttery crunch and the tartness of the raspberry assaulting his senses, it would all be better. All his problems would just disappear. But for that, he needed the scone.
Contrary to popular opinion, Draco was not melodramatic. In fact, on most days he was the epitome of rationality. Calm, collected...some might even go so far as to call him
Apparently, Sasha had other ideas. She yipped and made a sudden break for freedom, pulling Harry alongside as she bolted down the hill.
Draco whirled around and his eyes landed dead on the offender. The thief was seated at a table not too far away. He was dressed sloppily— in a hoodie and jeans— as criminals are wont to do. Draco sneered. Just look at him, sitting over there in his stupid Man U hoodie and his stupid glasses, reading his stupid book.
He allowed himself a fond smile before immediately schooling his expression. The children knew they were not allowed in his study. Of course, Albus was at that age when he would want to test boundaries but that was precisely why the rules had to be enforced.
“Oh.” Draco startled, a bit caught off guard by the abrupt invitation. “That’s nice but you really don’t have to...”
“You could fail every single class and we would still love you,” Father replied without a moment’s hesitation.
“Draco.” He blinks as he’s hauled up against a solid chest. Draco swallows against the tightness of his throat. His fingers trail down the cool, muscled planes of Harry’s chest. Trying to memorise him.
Potter wasn’t particularly hard to track down. There were only a few odd places where he spent his time nowadays. If it wasn’t the Quidditch Pitch, the Great Hall or the Common Room, it had to be the DADA Training Rooms.
William gazed at him with sorry, soulful brown eyes and Draco’s ire deflated like a bad soufflé. “Come here, you great mutt,” he grumbled, petting his doggy menace. William barked happily and planted his paws on Draco’s shoulders, proceeding to lick him with great enthusiasm despite Draco’s vehement protests.
Draco stood there with his boyfriend, Helga gnawing at his shirt, Salazar chewing on his shoe and Rowena angling for his sleeve while Helena and Godric chased each other around the flat. A reluctant smile tugged at his lips because really,
Harry’s dating him and he’s coming to dinner. I’m just trying to figure out this kid’s deal. Did you know he used to hex Harry back at Hogwarts?”
“I can’t,” Harry said firmly. “I...I can’t do this anymore, Draco. It’s bloody awful and it hurts and somehow, I’m always left wondering what I did wrong. So, no. I’m sorry but this is what you wanted, right?”
“Potter…” His voice was a raspy whisper. All of this...he couldn’t get his head around it fast enough. Potter had been watching him? Potter
“He was here for hours before you finally woke up,” Draco added relentlessly. It hurt him to do this but it was long overdue. Twenty feet, that was all he could think of. Twenty
the crowd?” Draco ran his hands through his hair, all composure forgotten. He was flushed and grinning, eyes bright with excitement. “That had to be a new world record!”
Hugo detached himself for a second. He patted Draco’s cheek and gurgled seriously at him. Draco blinked at the tiny pocket of warmth against his skin.
“Oh believe me, I can guess,” Draco snapped. “This hasn’t been a picnic for me either, Granger. For your information, it’s been a right mess. I feel like I’m constantly on the verge of a panic attack. I’m stressed, I can’t cast properly, I’m always hungry or tired or both! And between telling him and not telling him and not being
This was it. No excuses, distractions or interruptions for miles. He had no reasons not to do this anymore. Draco nodded and braced himself.
“What’s Dad’s problem?” he burst out. He’d been simmering in silence ever since his father had all but fled from the table, and Draco had cautiously opted to follow him. Now they were both gone and he just…he didn’t know
Draco didn’t know why he did it. It was an impulse, an attempt to salvage some shred of dignity from this appalling evening. A small part of him knew that this couldn’t end well, but at this point, what choice did he have? It was either this or an evening alone with Potter— knowing that the man would never see him as more than a friend— and that was just unbearable.
the former Headmaster’s name was case for detention — it took an audacious sort of cunning to dream that up.
Yes, a Kneazle,” he nodded hastily, nearly displacing his head again. “Quite right, Friar. Clearly nothing worth bothering the Prefects with.”
“Beautiful,” Harry murmured. An affable bark from his companion confirmed his statement. Harry chuckled and scratched Sasha’s ears.
,” she raised her voice slightly as Draco started to protest again, “if you promise to go through the information package and have a good think on things, I will most assuredly honour your choice in the matter. Whatever it may be.”
“I can’t,” Granger said, sounding firmer now. “But Harry can.” She shook her head and sighed. “Malfoy, I realise you’ve been dealing with a lot this year, but surely you’ve noticed that Harry likes you? He likes you enough to want to
Draco flushed and burrowed into the jacket, breathing in the scent of pine and cinnamon. He let out an appreciative sigh, only noticing belatedly as Harry wrapped an arm around his shoulders and led him off.
Draco laughed, partly out of amusement and partly out of surprise. “Nice to meet you,” he replied, taking the offered hand. “I’m...”
James hid in his shoulder again. His voice was small when he finally spoke. “Connor s-said...he said Dad would have done it. He said Dad would’ve taken the bet.”
Draco favoured her with a sharp grin and steepled his hands. “I’m so glad you asked, Pansy. Here’s how it’s going down...”
Draco thought. Merlin forbid anything that nauseatingly sentimental ever came out of his mouth. He would never live it down. “Treacle tart,” he supplied instead, burrowing into Harry’s warm, strong arms. “Been craving one all day.”
“That’s the spirit!” Theo replied, slapping his back cheerfully. “Now get to work. The sooner Godric buries
“And I love him despite that,” Draco reassured with a smirk. “It’s all Ron Weasley’s fault, you know. He’s a terrible influence on your son.”
Before James could blink, he was being enveloped in a crushing hug. His heart warmed and he immediately moved to embrace his boy. Harry was so tall now, it felt like he grew a little more every time James saw him. It was almost hard to remember a time when he’d barely come up to his father’s knee. The thought made him tighten his hold just a little more.
“Yes well, don’t get used to it,” Malfoy grumbled. Nevertheless, he was extra cautious as he handed the sleeping baby over to Hermione. “Careful,” he warned as she settled Hugo on her shoulder. “Don’t jostle him.”
inform them about the fireplace next to the Great Hall which is always lit and operational for emergency Floo Calls.”
Draco sprang out of his hold immediately. One hand instinctively went to cradle his stomach. Merlin help him, he’d nearly tripped! That was too close. Was the baby alright? What if…
“Steady, beautiful,” Harry murmurs, closing the open gash with a swipe of his tongue. “We may have gone a bit too far this time.”
“You want your toys?” Draco repeated meaningfully. He did his best to enunciate and speak full sentences around Teddy. Of course, he was too young just yet, but all the books said children were like sponges at this age. He wondered if Potter had read any child-rearing books before taking this up. Draco snorted at the thought. Far more likely, he was going on instinct, like he did with everything else.
Harry smiled and Draco leaned in for a kiss, only to be thwarted as Helga reared up and licked his face again.
His words tuned in and out. Draco stared at the plate in dead, terror invoking silence. The peas stared right back and sure enough they insolently spelled out
Slughorn dithered a bit but evidently, her vote counted more than his. “Very well, off with you then. Just be sure to…”
It’s haunting and painful and it makes him want to shrink into himself. He’d known — at least on some level — that Harry’s life couldn’t have been painless but this
before embarrassing himself completely. Yes, all he had to do was go in there, pretend nothing was amiss and spend a few hours with Potter. No harm done, right?
“Harry,” Draco replied softly. He turned around to face the man, taking in the familiar sight of his messy hair and warm, green eyes. Harry’s robes were askew and his Firebolt was propped against a nearby tree. He had obviously been flying when Draco arrived.
mattered now except for the baby growing inside him. But it didn’t make him feel any less weary. He was facing an uphill battle on all fronts, and it started today. Pomfrey hadn’t minced words with him.
Lily gave him another kiss and her lips quirked in a soft, dangerous smile. “James, darling? You’re the love of my life but if you don’t get out of my kitchen right now, I
The Potions tome dropped to the floor with a thud as Father hurried over quickly. He looked absolutely frantic, and James felt even worse somehow for worrying him so.
“Will you come with me?” he asked Granger. It was embarrassing and humbling but...she’d been here for him. He really didn’t think he could do it without her. “Please, Granger. I don’t...I don’t want to do it alone.”
“I’m sorry I hurt you,” Draco replied. He really was. Of all things he regretted in this mess, that made the top of the list. “You have to know I didn’t mean to.”
Just for that, she executed a graceful flip, making him smile again. Suddenly, he started shuffling awkwardly. Marina frowned, wondering what the matter was.
Still, he shied from the overtures. What he had with Potter, this thing they’d been doing...it was too complicated. When he thought about their history and what they’d put each other through —  it went far beyond Potter’s broken nose and the slashes of scars across his own chest. Just a year ago, they’d been out to actively hurt each other in the worst ways. One didn’t just get over that. And even if Potter was trying, even if he was sincere in his intent...well. At best, he was trying to assuage his own guilt. At worst, he was blowing off some steam like he undoubtedly felt he deserved to. Draco was just one more unresolved matter to him, one more thing to put to rest.
“Not really, no.” Harry dropped his fork with a clatter and turned to glare accusingly at him. “I rather think you said it all this morning, don’t you?”
Maybe it would be different if he were in an actual relationship or...something. But he wasn’t. And the thought of explaining
“Pay attention, Potter,” he muttered. “I promised my mother I’d never cast this spell in polite company again.”
They lapsed back in surprisingly comfortable silence. Harry’s fingers tangled with his and he marvelled at how...easy it all was. He’d worried and fretted over this moment for so long and now that it was here, it almost felt unreal.
A flood of emotions whirled inside him. Draco swallowed, a bit surprised at the sudden lump in his throat. This, all of this, had been so overwhelming. A part of him wished he could just sink into Harry’s arms and let it all out. Just tell him everything and…
Draco woke up to an insistent tugging at his hair. He groaned and scrunched his eyes shut, batting at the disturbance.
Pomfrey held up a finger to silence him. She was skimming through a Healer’s tome now, nodding to herself and occasionally giving him a scrutinising glance. Draco’s unease just tripled. In all his visits to the Hospital Wing — and there were many — he’d never known Pomfrey to ever require a reference book. Whatever this was...well, he wasn’t going to get any answers until she was done, was he?
So, Draco made his way to the dungeons. Potions was next and he needed to finish his paper before the NEWTS. Also, by luck or happenstance, he didn’t share with Harry. That, admittedly, was the only reason he’d gathered the courage to go. All he had to do was get through one class and skip dinner in the Hall, and he could make it to the dorms without running into...him.
If there was a worse way to herald his child’s existence, Draco couldn’t think of it. He just dearly hoped Mother never found out about this.
His boyfriend nuzzled into his neck with a contented sigh and his hold on Draco’s waist tightened reflexively. Then he fell still and Draco heaved a sigh of relief.
He drifted off, with strong arms holding him, a hand gently cradling his stomach and a soft voice whispering promises of the future. There was still one thing left to do though, and he wasn’t putting this off for anything.
Draco frowned. This...wasn’t something he was familiar with. He wasn’t exactly an expert in Muggle toys but he knew enough to recognise them or at least, figure out how they worked. With the exception of the one time Teddy’s clockwork dog had barked at him and nearly scared ten years off his life, he hadn’t come across any that stumped him.
“Granger and I need to visit the library,” Draco lied, trying to keep his voice steady. He only partially succeeded. “Right now.”
Pomfrey pressed something into his hand. Draco stared, nonplussed and confused, at the innocuous little Bean sitting in his palm.
Potter grinned and seated himself, sliding up to Draco a bit closer than strictly necessary. “I don’t remember seeing you here before,” he said teasingly. “Looking for some pointers, Malfoy?”
“Right,” Ron agreed, nodding along. “Say, Harry, if this is just a friendly get together kind of thing, can Hermione and I come?”
Harry nodded in agreement and settled back as the movie started. “Not a date,” he murmured in Draco’s ear. “Maybe later, when you’re not so mad at me, we can try going on a real one and see how things go.”
“No,” Draco drawled. “Clearly not.” Potter looked about ready to melt into the floor, so Draco took pity on him. “Sit,” he ordered, shifting over and patting the couch. “Make yourself at home.”
Honestly, he’d graduated law school just last year, he was an up-and-coming star at his father’s firm and he always,
Draco swallowed and slipped into the classroom, unseen in the flurry of students milling about. Potter, however, was easily spotted, surrounded by a group of wide-eyed Second Years.
Harry wasn’t buying it. He crossed his arms and fixed Draco with that relentless, stern expression that always made him want to sit in a corner and think about what he’d done.  “You’re astounding,” Harry informed him. “I can’t believe you would use this sweet girl as
and they would be correct— fuck you very much, Theo. Yes, he had his bad days like everyone else. Who wouldn’t be in a bad mood after a late night of cramming for their Comparative Literature Finals? It was Blaise’s own fault for being within biting distance in the first place.
He flopped down on his bed with a groan. His hand shifted back to his stomach, more habit than anything. Draco huffed a tired laugh.
A comfortable silence fell between them, and it almost surprised him. He hadn’t realised how much he’d needed to talk about it. About all of it. The relief was almost palpable, like a weight had been lifted off his shoulders.
“It’s that wench MacDougal.” Father spat the name out like an insult. “She’s hawking her pro-Mudblood agenda in the Wizengamot again. She might be making some headway this time.”
And Harry. He’d missed Harry too. Now that he was here, flying with him under the light of a thousand stars, he rather wished they’d done this earlier. Just...been with each other. Before things went completely mental.
William and Sasha observed them curiously before going back to nuzzling and fussing over each other. Draco cracked a smile, watching William make a complete arse of himself over the girl. When he turned, he noticed Potter grinning too. “Who would have thought, eh?”
James scowled. Was that a dig? It sounded like a dig. But Malfoy was looking at Harry now, grinning teasingly at him.
Draco vision went a tad hazy. The voices in his head surged, clamouring for retribution. His entire world narrowed down to a plate of delicious scones in the possession of a vile, hoodie clad villain. And then he was moving with purposeful strides to the table, murder in his eyes and fire in his heart.
Honestly, all he wanted right now was to hide in the Hospital Wing for the rest of his natural life.
was the one to come rushing to Hogwarts when the Floo-call had come from McGonagall. Harry was borderline hysterical and halfway through the fireplace but in the end, Draco had managed to talk him into staying back somehow.
, he reminded himself firmly. No matter how much he wanted to, he couldn’t do that. He was here to teach James a lesson, not traumatise him. So he schooled his expression and turned back to his son again. “You do realise you’re not helping your case, don’t you?”
Father stiffened, caught somewhere between insult and caution. “I’ve been told vampires are patient creatures. When I’m the Minister for Magic, rest assured, you will be handsomely rewarded.”
William cut him off with a bark and a firm yank. Draco squawked, his shoulder protesting heavily against the strain.
“Draco Abraxas Malfoy!” Harry gasped in outrage and went so far as to cover Godric’s ears. “If you’re suggesting even for a second that I put my dog down because you’re not getting any, I will hex you into next week!”
Draco— who had been momentarily stunned by the sheer green of those eyes— recalled his mission. The scones were still sitting their innocuously and the sight did nothing to quell his temper. He turned back to the thief.
Godric however, yipped in delight. He lumbered past Harry and all but bolted for their guest— their decidedly
, to keep his focus anywhere but on that smirking, taunting mouth. “Hasn’t anyone told you it’s rude to eavesdrop, lordling?” He was close enough that Draco would have felt the heat coming off him, had there been any. “Dangerous too. We wouldn’t want you compromised.”
“I’d do anything for you, Draco,” Harry whispered against his lips. “Tell me what you need right now.”
get the words out.” He shook his head in despair and gave her a look of frank desperation. “You do it. Please? Just tell him for me.”
So he seated himself next to James and lifted a gentle hand to trace his cheek. Thankfully, James didn’t flinch from his touch. “Look at me,” Draco ordered quietly.
“Sophie,” Potter chided, bending down to retrieve her wand. He smiled encouragingly and passed it over. “What did we just talk about? You’re putting a lot of pressure on yourself.”
“You caught me in the middle of a project,” Potter was still talking, evidently oblivious. “I must have lost track of...oh hello, Teddy Bear.”
Ah, a technicality. Apparently, Draco had a future member of the Wizengamot on his hands. The thought made him chuckle a little.
Potter’s expression darkened. “I didn’t like that,” he grumbled sullenly. “I wanted to hex Seamus for touching you. And I wanted to hex myself for not telling you how I felt when I had the chance.” He took a step closer, expression intent and determined. “
Potter smiled back and his fingers brushed against Draco’s. “At least,” he replied, looking endearingly bashful after all his bravado. “And...now I have time to get to know you better.”
He nodded sympathetically. “I get lonely too, sometimes. I’m not really supposed to be here. I’m not a Prefect or anything. But I can come down and see you sometime if you like?”
“Potter, stop being difficult! I’m trying here!” Draco snapped back. He was reaching breaking point, he just knew it. “Do you have one or not?”
Draco crossed his arms, even as an embarrassed blush rose to his cheeks again. “What exactly is it for, Potter?”
When Draco thought about what might have happened today...he didn’t even want to say it. Just thinking about it made his heart hammer in his chest again, well on the way to another panic attack. No, he was done with that spiel. His son was in
There was stunned silence for a second. The bloke gaped at him as if he’d grown a second head. Then he cleared his throat and addressed Draco again. “You want these scones?” he asked. “Because they’re yours?”
“Mm,” Draco agreed noncommittally. He stretched and allowed the blanket to slip off his shoulders, noting with a triumphant smirk as Potter’s eyes drifted again. “It would be a shame to separate them, don’t you think?”
Draco rolled his eyes and turned off his Kindle, making a mental note to delete that ridiculous e-book as soon as he had the chance. It was a gift from Pansy and now, he was more than certain that she’d forgotten his birthday completely and resorted to a panicked last minute shopping spree. Why else would she give him a compilation on Pagan Folklore? Or maybe it
“Harry, you can’t do this!” he protested desperately. “Weasley will kill you when he finds out you left his son with me! And believe me, I am not going to stop him.”
Harry raised an eyebrow as he opened the door to his flat, only to see Draco standing there. “Hello, Draco,” he greeted cautiously. Not so surprisingly, Godric made an immediate appearance and growled, hovering protectively behind Harry. Draco ignored him and focused on his boyfriend.
“As I was saying,” Draco recommenced in a tone that suggested that the next interruption would be the last one, “we haven’t selected this year’s lucky target yet. I have taken the liberty of putting together a small list of vict—er,
