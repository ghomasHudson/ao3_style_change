This time, however, the blood was way deeper of a red than he could remember his usual cuts being. He must have hit a vein. The red screamed of being stopped and done something about, not only that but his consciousness as well. White dots like snowflakes appeared all over his vision, and he was reminded of the first snowy day of Christmas here at Hogwarts. It was a memory he always held close, even the harsh wind or freezing temperature could not ruin the day he spent with his friends. It was a simpler time, for he couldn't care less about those things right now when he had a lunatic to control his life.
Malfoy. Draco. Draco has someone close to him that isn't Harry. Someone other than Harry. No, no, he was not allowed to do that-

The bathroom scene did repeat itself as well, Draco desperately noted, but unlike anything else, the scene would have repeated itself with or without the loop. It happened day after day, all the time, there was no avoiding it.
The acid yellow reminded him of something dangerous, something that you weren't supposed to touch at all. He never really liked yellow, he would always struggle to compare it to something, and would boringly say it reminded him of summer days, but also to sparkling dusk, a lot of flowers he saw around Hogwarts and his mother's well loved gold jewellery, which she proudly wore day after day, almost all the time.
He put the balm into his cloak's pockets and headed towards the library, since he remembered himself doing so yesterday might as well do it again. Draco made sure to remember using the balm on his fresh cuts as well, since he already had it he could use it until he ran out of it so he would't mindlessly waste it.
"What's wrong?", Harry asked as he quickly came to his side.
Harry paused a little, quickly drank his, and afterwards with surprise clear in his eyes looked at Draco, "Really? They both looked exactly the same to me!", he fondly smiled a little, and Draco's heart skipped a beat, "You're really good at potions, huh? It must have taken ages to be able to know all of them by heart!"
"Fine. I'm fine."
Later he would realize that Draco's discomfort came from touching his forearm, not from Harry himself.
October 1st
"What do you mean by that? Don't fill the git's ego even more, Hermione. Please, we don't need that.", Ron grumbled, distaste clear on his face.
Draco was gifted, talented, and he wore that knowledge with pride. However, neither of those characteristics were much of help when he himself decided that paying attention to anything in particular was not worth his time. Unfortunately, Harry included.
"Oh?", Draco said while crossing his arms, "So it's completely my own fault now?"
Sharing a room with a bunch of noisy teenagers, for already six years, never made the fact of getting woken up easier. He found himself missing his younger self's days of having his whole quiet bedroom to himself, never appreciating the damned room until he came to Hogwarts and had to share one.
And this marked the third today. The third time he had this conversation with his friends, the third time he denied the whole conversation altogether, and the third time he watched Draco with the same stare, noticing only him, besides Harry himself of course, acting and dressing differently from anyone else, clearly applying Draco was well aware of the loop, but doing nothing about it.
He even seemed happier, if Harry could call something like that happiness.
Harry honestly wondered if he should seek help from someone again.
"Not only are you incapable of accepting confessions from younger girls, Potter, but also at brewing a simple potion. " He forced a sneer to go with his weak insult. He didn't really know how to react otherwise.
"I don't know them by heart.", Draco said lightly as he started to feel much better. The antidote was already working. He fidgeted a bit when he realised how nervous he suddenly felt, talking to Harry had that kind of effect, "I just really like colors.", he said as he finally got up from the old desk. He cringed a little at his stiff backside and tried to loosen up his muscles as he stretched his arms above his head.
But Draco paid him no mind to answer. The more he denied that one fact which was bugging him since yesterday's today, the longer he would be able to live in his own created world of time repeating itself over and over again. This was a world where Draco couldn't make mistakes, where his actions didn't matter, where he could do whatever he wanted without thinking about consequences. This was a world which he always wanted to have, even if it was only made up and full of lies.
The people who Draco loved, but none of them were worthy of Draco's love.
No, Draco was not going to try and find comfort in the eyes of none other than Harry Potter. If he was about to break down completely, then so be it.
"Didn't it start like this last time as well?", she casually asked, keeping her gaze stronger than before. "In second year with us?"
"Oh yeah! All Slytherins already know about it!" Pancy cheered as Draco witnessed another theft of his blueberries, "Honestly! You could've at least thanked Theo for vanishing it away!", she kicked Blaise as hard as she could for stealing her blueberry directly out of her hand, "Everything was left spotless afterwards, rumor has it that he used-", she stood up a bit and carefully leaned in towards the two boys, as she quietly whispered, "Magic.", and with that she dramatically sat down.
Also, I am always here to hear anyone out, please remember that you are not alone, find me on tumblr as leaphyy.
Harry tore off his gaze from Draco, whom he had shamelessly watched the second the blonde entered the hall with his friends earlier this morning. That was quite a while ago, class was about to start and Draco had yet to pick up his fork and start eating.
Neither boy spoke after that, Harry clearly way too embarrassed to make a sarcastic remark. The realization that the darker boy didn't deny the situation happening made Draco's heart suddenly flutter, and thus blush, if it was even possible, even more. Snape took the chance to bring their attention towards both of the potions he was carrying. One was a delicate sparkly light blue shade, while the other one was almost the exact same sparkly light blue, but a slight violet tint could be seen in it, and Draco took in the beauty of the both potions.
"You don't have any right-", the other boy said, with each word his voice becoming louder, but his words were interrupted by the unexpected presence of their professor.
-Clementine
None of them but Harry.
He carefully opened his tired eyes, blinking a few times to adjust to the thin light that barely shone through the thick and heavy dark green curtains. He could hear the soft snores of his roommates and friends, carrying a somewhat melody through the dorms in the early hours of the morning. Sluggishly, he sat up, stretching his arms and legs in the process, as the messy and tangled silk sheets slowly slid off of his body, exposing him to the fresh morning air. He shivered at the sudden temperature change, and quickly wrapped his arms around himself in an attempt to warm himself up, if only for a bit. He slowly looked around the room and noted that all of his roommates were fast asleep, aside from Blaise who was quietly, but furiously writing on a piece of old, yellowed paper. His books were awkwardly placed on his bed, waiting for the right second to fall off and wake everyone in the room. His frowned, his thick eyebrows pointed out that he was deep in thought, and his frown deepened a little bit as he stopped writing, only to continue a few seconds later. Homework, Draco presumed, which was obviously delayed for the last second, not the first nor the last time. Draco scowled and rubbed his eyes to make the tiredness go away, and he tried to remember why Blaise was doing any homework at all, due to none of the teachers giving them any the day prior.
Yellow. Yellow for the small butterfly clip which pinned down the long amber hair of a fourth year Hufflepuff girl. The girl seemed very clumsy, thought Draco, as the girl spilled her pumpkin juice all over the table. She flushed a deep red when her fellow housemates started teasing her.
He heard Harry's soft curse, and soon enough found a pair of green and angry eyes on him. He could never be able to explain the rush of heat he suddenly felt all over his body, it made him confused and restless, and he didn't want to deal with it right now when he could feel an argument slowly rising in the air.
Harry asked, but Draco had already enough space between them to continue walking down the hall, towards his room since he didn't feel like going to the library anymore. He acknowledged Harry's question and moved his right hand up and waved, as to say "Stop bothering me, goodbye.", leaving the darker boy behind, all by himself in the hallway.
That was not a case, however, nor was it something that would ever happen, so he had to live with the truth and regret of never properly meeting his parents. He was never given the opportunity of doing that, so he would not question the what ifs, for it would be a much easier and wiser choice. Easier since he wouldn't overweight his brain with such horrible and heavy thoughts, and wiser since he never learnt to let go of things which were his. Which brings him to one of his not so pretty, nor heroic personality trait.
"Why, for Potions of course!", Hermione declared smugly, "I've managed to find them all under half an hour. Oh, Ron helped a bit, well, more or less."
One thing is for certain, Draco became Harry's new delicate flame and no matter how much he tried, he could not take his eyes off of the other boy, and with that, he realized, would not be able to calm him overly possessive feelings that were almost always present. Harry was not the one to blame, after all, for Draco was always surrounded by a good amount of people, his friends, Harry supposed. One thing which gave him a bit of a peaceful state of mind was when he realized that Draco was an open book only to him. While some of his friends showed their worries and concerns at certain times, they did brush it off rather quickly and Harry was the only one to realize that Draco's unhappiness was always present. No matter how much he tried to hide it, Harry always saw right through his lies. Unlike his friends, Harry was willing to try and do something about it, whether it being his so called "hero complex" or some of his overcomplicated feeling.
The breaking point of it all was in third year when he growled and snapped at professor McGonagall. He was not paying attention in class, he was way too busy doodling a bunch of green dragons and other things on a piece of old and yellowed paper. The professor saw him, and was not amused with him at all, so when she tried to take it away from him something in him snapped, and then he tore the paper out of her hold and was about to scratch her as well. After his possessiveness was brought to her attention, a wave of pity took over her, and for the first time ever he caught something like sadness in her eyes. She offered him her help right after class, he still had no idea then just how much she would actually help him.
That year I stayed up all night to sew that Dementor costume, my fingers pricked raw and bleeding by the end of it. It was rather shoddy work but I remember being very proud, excited to get a reaction out of Potter.
I take a step back, alarmed. "This is where I need to go?"
TWELVE
After the disastrous morning, I try to shake off the looming grey cloud over my head and dawn my best Malfoy charm.
I heave a sigh and pull a jumper on before Apparating, magic straining, to Grimmauld Place.
My magical core is exhausted from the long day of continuous magic use after such a long period of abstinence. My body aches for a long night’s rest and a Pepper Up or two, but instead I head for the bathroom for a fresh shower.
I freeze, foot stopped before I reached the ground. The bus operator spits in his bloody
Dean and Seamus dropped into the store a few hours later and I went from there to a new wizarding bar that opened up, this one not kid friendly unlike the Leaky.
The man, Charles, based on his name tag, scowled.
Luna cocks her head to the side at seeing Tasha and brings a hand to her smooth scales. Large dragon hide gloves are over her elbows and her clothes are mismatched Muggle and Wizard styles. She takes Tasha from me and holds her up to look consideringly at her blank face.
, then painstakingly find about where the address is on the map. I stab my wand there.
"Harry said you rescue animals?" I ask and Luna looks up with a wide smile.
If only this was a date and he hauled me home at the end of the night. To tuck me in beside him with a kiss and tease me about my lack of alcohol tolerance in the morning.
"I used to, but he moved to Hogwarts when I took ownership of the house." Potter is...shockingly casual. I stare at his back clad in muggle cloths. He's filled out since I saw him last. But as every wizarding tale recounted adoringly, he was on the run for a year by then.
I rest my head on his solid shoulder to hide a sad smile. Of course I'm hung up with someone I cannot have. Will not have. Never wake up next to, nor go to sleep beside. I want to comb his hair and have him make breakfast for me, explain those queer Muggle gadgets in the kitchen.
"Oh!" He yelps and I jump, shoulder hitting the wall as I clutch the towel around my waist. His grey eyes are the size of saucers for a moment before he slaps his hands over them, "
"Er, I dunno if that’s a good idea," I say, slightly annoyed at Draco for pinning this on me. But Draco is still...Draco and my cock's still half hard.
She nods, transferring Tasha to me, then focuses on a small cage of shivering snow puffs, "Just keep her warm until she's back."
Draco smiles into his lap, "That's nice. She seems very...happy."
cages.
"What does it mean?" Luna asks with a confused smile, tilting her head so her long curls fall over her shoulder.
Potter gives me an odd look and I avoid it by studying the owl tree a moment before announcing, "Okay, I'm going back inside. Thank you for the pastries."
I smile, pressing my face into my swan down pillow, because despite the annoyances, I'm safe and out of that damned carpet bag.
I wrinkle my nose in distaste, "You want me to peddle her off?"
All for a nice dinner.
The original man yells at his friends, "Shut up! How old does he look to you?"

I cast
"Brilliant. We can side along from here- I remember you saying after work you're too tired to Apparate."
"Don't piss on my things," I huff as I close and then lock my door, trapping the creature inside to lay havoc to my possessions. I turn and give it a stern look before throwing my over-sized hood over my head and Apparating from the security of my apartment to Diagon Alley.
"Ron's at the joke shop, now what is it? You've really worried me Harry."
Harry
I look at him for a long second and he focuses his attention to Tasha who preens, "Do you have a Muggle bus pass? Or a card for the Tube?"
-----
Dean and Seamus just bought a house to live in together and when I asked how they were getting on, Dean got a suspicious look about him. They've been dating ever since the end of the war, which forged their bond instead of tearing them apart like it did Ginny and I.
Hope you liked the chapter! Kudos, bookmark, and comment plz
All the manners ingrained in me since birth leave me as I shove past him with a scowl, looking for Tasha.
My smile drooped into more of a pained grimace. I need this job.
off." He explains and shoves a bite into his mouth and hums a moment before speaking, his mouth still full, "'Mm not really sure how this is s'posed to taste, honestly, but it's pretty good."
I cast a Scourgify on his soaked clothes, and ask cautiously, "Draco, what happened?"
The spell is one I found in the Manor's library before it was confiscated, before I received my trial and couldn't leave that blood-stained place. Not wanting to see my family, I locked myself in the library with only my favorite house elf for company until the Ministry recovered enough for a trial.
"Give them to me.", said Draco as he took the potions from Harry, touching him accidentally, and blushing for a bit, "Hmm..", he said as he examined the both potions, softly shaking the light blue and tinted violet one, "This one's mine. Here.", he handed Harry the only light blue one.
For hate always overcame love. Or at least, he thought so.
1-800-273-8255
What he did not expect, however, was the sudden lack of that pretty scarlet red on the warm skin of the green eyed boy's cheeks, even after the gorgeous girl whispered the same confession in his ear.
"You gave them quite the scare, you know,", Harry thoughtfully said, "Not only was Parkinson worried, but Zabini as well. Though, he hid it surprisingly well.", he smirked at the last part. Was the bastard teasing him?
"Zabini, you idiot!", Theo yelled as he forcefully sat up again, eyes glaring into the loud and annoying boy, his attractive face scrunched and full of anger. That anger completely disappeared when his eyes shifted towards Draco, who was still looking at him and fidgeting a bit with his fingers.
Crimson, again. Crimson for the smooth and warm blood that slowly, yet steady, flowed down both of his forearms, one enduring a lot more damage than the other, for obvious reasons. Draco wondered how many times he would have to do this until there was no room left for the blade to leave its mark. Not much, it would seem, for he could almost not recognize neither of his arms due to the cuts and injuries. The moment might as well been a murder scene, for how much damage he made for that much blood to pour out. Not only did he inflict new cuts, he reopened the old ones as well, going over them a few times before making sure there was no way of healing them anytime soon.
It took Draco a moment to realize what Potter was referring to. Just then did he remember forcefully packing his bag in class with not his books, which he glamorously left in his room, but Potter's instead. He would later deny the fact of blushing and becoming an embarrassed mess after realizing his mistake. The 'again' was left unnoticed.
He found himself not liking when people touched his things, whether it being right in front of him or just the mention of the touching happening. He remembers snapping at Dean in first year once for touching his book without asking. The problem with his books was soon solved, and now he can share them without any issues, but still, the nagging feeling at the back of his head would still be there. He didn't like it when his friends paid attention to someone else who wasn't him, or when anyone else besides him had a reason to talk, or basically whatever else they had to do with both of them in general. Once, he made a Ravenclaw cry for answering a question when it was Hermione the professor picked to give the answer. The second time it happened was when someone interrupted and talked over Ron, clearly doing it on accident. A lot of people suffered through his outbursts in second year, that is until Hermione became aware of his problem, and together with Ron, the three of them were able to get that under control as well. But the nagging feeling never went away.
Apparently, Ron was missing the same piece as well, and when she revealed it like that, his face turned serious, a light understanding behind it.
"-and I'll prove it to you, just you wait-"
"Fuck!", Harry shouted making everyone around him turn their heads, even Draco himself.
Harry witnessed the potion quickly changing colors, a calm deep blue almost violet becoming a neon yellow instead. The smell turned rotten, and he wished he never touched the damned yellow plant.
"Hmm,", Harry hummed as he stopped to think a little, "It might have been half an hour since he left the classroom.", His eyes narrowed in deep thought a bit as he recalled what happened, "He could have already found the antidote and the both of us could have had all of this behind us, only if it wasn't for Parkinson making an enormous fuss about it.", Harry sighed a little and fixed his glasses that were slowly sliding down, "I mean honestly, she was yelling and screaming at everyone and everything, especially me! Zabini tried to calm her down before Snape gave her detention, didn't really work since she got it anyways.", he huffed softly, "If you concentrate hard enough you can still hear her screaming in the hall, Snape charmed the door so no one aside from him could come in, it's still a bit dangerous in here."
"Nothing, just..", he started as he took a step back from the cauldron, nearly bumping into the other boy. He realized how the potion became hotter and hotter each second passed, and the room suddenly felt rather warm,  "The cauldron is extremely hot, we shouldn't touch it.", he tried not to wince again at the burning he felt on his hand. "Let's call the professor.", but before he could call out to Snape, he felt a soft touch on his right wrist which made him stop in his tracks.
"Yeah mate,", Ron whispered as well, a light and soft expression on his face, "We're here for you. The both of us."
White.
Or ever, as things are standing in a loop for now.
"Harry! Merlin, there you are!"
Violet. Violet for the birthmark of a fourth year Gryffindor in his Astronomy class.
"He sure isn't shy about being caught red handed, is he?" Chuckled Blaise as he stole a blueberry directly from Draco's plate. He noted Blaise's black nail polish, which was shiny and neatly done.

"She thought you could use a bit of help with Potions,", he smirked, lightly teasing Harry, "After today's accident and all.".
He looked up from his plate, becoming aware of the ongoing teasing going on between his friends, and-
Looking back, it all started when he was about nine years old. He remembers getting his first toy, a white and greenish tinted stuffed dragon. It wasn't really his, since it firstly belonged to Dudley, who after ripping one of its wings out, threw it at Harry almost cracking his glasses in the process. After screaming and blaming Harry for the damage the poor dragon went through, his aunt punished him with not having dinner that day, nor the next day... nor for the next whole week. He did manage to sneak the dragon into his cupboard so at the end, nothing of it mattered, for Harry finally got himself his first toy, and for the first time ever he was nothing more but thrilled and happy about it. Happy, since he never got something like this before. The stuffed animal was something that finally belonged to him, and him only. He wasn't about to share it with anyone anytime soon, or ever. Since the dragon was Harry's, nobody else's. And for that, he was determined to fix the poor thing and give the dragon a new home.
Then, a shout and a failed potion.
Red, again, as in the blush that stood against the dark and warm skin of the boy, as it rose just seconds after the girl whispered something to his ear. It must have been a confession.
He wondered if Draco forgot his books again, and found himself not minding to share his own books with the gray eyed teen, even after yesterday's today happenings of Draco accidentally stealing his in rush. Thankfully, he did manage to find him after class and was successful at getting them back.
Brown. Brown as in Blaise's cold and deep eye color that now locked with his, frowning a bit more to come across as melodramatic, clearly annoyed for being ignored by his fellow Slytherin friend.
It was only then when he realised just how much his heart was beating and yearning for the presence of the green eyed boy, his eyes slowly fluttering at the memory of Harry all over him. He never expected himself to miss the other’s touch and lavender smell, but just remembering it made him feel safe and warm. It made him think of light pink, a color he used to describe delicate and easily breakable things. Harry himself reminded him as the calm before an enormous storm, but he had yet to find out why.
If only Malfoy would meet his eyes for a period longer than a few seconds, Harry would give everything in his might to try and understand the other's thoughts. It was tricky, but it didn't matter, for Harry wanted to be the only one to unravel every last one of Malfoy's secrets.

Draco exhaustingly watched his friend slowly lose his cool, and he cursed and cursed as he furiously tried to move the dripping paper off of his bed, while intensely making sure not to get any of the black ink on the light green carpet.
The dark green and blue cyan reminded him of a pin his father used to wear when he was younger. It was a long time ago, but Draco still remembered every detail of the delicate pin. The pin was rather expensive, but nevertheless not his father's first choice. Its gold rimming made up for the thin but elegant stone. The dull color didn't do any justice to his father's ties, that being a reason for it being thrown away, forgotten somewhere in the manor. Draco remembered looking for it as a young kid, treating it like a treasure waiting to be discovered. However, no matter how hard he looked, he never found it, and soon he lost all interest in finding it whatsoever. The treasure remained hidden till this day.

Brewing potions has always been unreasonably problematic and without a reason way too hard, in Harry's honest opinion.
Instead, he concentrated on the lovely shade of the magenta glasses a Ravenclaw girl in front of him wore.
"Mate,", said Ron, finally catching up with Hermione, "No offence, but, you don't seem fine.".
'Tomorrow'
"Aside from the horrible things you did to your book, I mean honestly,", Draco grumbled as he carefully cut a coral colored plant into tiny pieces for the potion, "You're not even good at drawing. Is there anything you
"No, no!", Hermione quickly dismissed, "I don't mean it like that at all-"
The tense silence was broken by a curse, and a loud "Are you kidding me!" from Blaise, and Draco heard a few groans and whines coming from the beds that weren't far away from them, alongside with a sharp "Keep it down, morons!" from Theodore Nott, as he used his pillow to block out the sounds.
"Why you-", Harry started before he realized that Draco was slowly but surely moving away. "Hey! Is your hand at least okay?"
And then Ron joined, and Harry knew he was caught.
That possessiveness continued to curse him throughout his whole life, however, the more time passed, the more Harry learned to keep it under control. That didn't change the fact that it was still present, buried deep down in the pitch black flaws of his soul.
But Harry did absolutely not feel like that over a spoiled brat. No way. He was just curious, that's all.
"That, and,", Pancy said as she took the chance to swings herself over the two boys, "It must be horrible to carry so many books at once! Think about you back!", she pet him over his back and continued to talk about who knows what, clearly wanting to be the center of the conversation.
So why, oh why, did Harry feel sick with jealousy when there was nothing to be jealous about? Draco was his own man, the choices and their consequences were something Draco had to deal on his own, Harry was the one who had no right to interfere. Draco had every right to chose the people he wanted to be around with, the people whom never decided to say anything about his almost non existent eating habits, the people who decided to ignore how he wore long sleeved shirts throughout the whole sunny and hot September.
It utterly flew past Draco's mind that this wasn't the first time that he came across the same sight.
If only tomorrow would never come.
"Aren't you the sweetest?", he smirked as he ripped his hand from Harry's grip, "I wonder what that sweet Hufflepuff girl would do only so she could see your pathetic face right now,", Draco took pride in the sudden anger that crossed Harry's face, he noted how his hands were clenched and how the other boy tried to contain himself from doing something he might regret later. "Probably everything, even cry a bit more. I don't think she shed enough tears today, don't you agree?", Draco couldn't explain what, but something about making Harry Potter furious gave him so much satisfaction.

At least, he hoped so at first, and soon enough proved to himself to be the one in the wrong. He was surprised to be greeted with an acid yellow instead, and he almost covered his nose at the disgusting aroma of the failed potion. The potion was still supposed to be a cool, icy violet. This was far from it.

Harry felt sick, he felt like throwing up, he felt like punishing Draco for what he was doing to him, making his head hurt and his ears ring with screams. The room felt cold, way too cold, and for a second Harry wondered what it would be like if he choose to force all of Draco's secrets out of him.
But Harry never wanted Draco's love, for Harry was sure that this what he himself was feeling towards the Slytherin was far from pure love. It was something ugly, tainted, something that was hot and ready to overflow. Possessiveness, something he didn't feel for so long.
Draco stopped halfway through his, cringing at the taste, "This one's a bit violet, see?", he said shaking it a bit and bringing it closer to Harry, "The color is well hidden, but if you pay close attention it kind of looks like the violet you find in a diluted Camellia tea.", he drank the rest of the potion, "Violet cancels out yellow, and since the potion was acid yellow, it's pretty obvious that potion was mine."
In case anyone feels the same as Draco is portrayed in this fanfic:
"And", Hermione continued, looking back and forth from Harry to Ron, "If something like second grade were to happen again, we'll overcome it. Together."

Draco quickly looked down, his beating heart doing him no justice at all. He started eating, slapping away the prying hands which were about to steal his fruits, and ignored the stare and small gasp of the green eyed boy. Today, he didn't feel like drinking coffee.
The blonde actually touched his breakfast this time, even if it was almost equal to nothing. Still, it was something and it would mark him eating for the first time this week.
"He's up to something, I just know it."
Draco closed the door with more strength than necessary.
Why was he feeling like this? Surely something like this was not normal?
For the time being, I'll have to think about a plot I want this story to have, and then everything will be quite easy. Please don't mind my chaotic updating.
Draco didn't realize that none of his two friends neither got up from the table nor followed him as he slowly move towards the heavy doors, book opened in his hands and head bowed downwards as he read quietly through the last weeks lessons. Only when Pancy carefully called out to him did he stop and turned around. He raised an eyebrow and waited for the both of them to get up. They both did, and he became fully aware of their awkward glances they were sharing between each other. If anything, it irked him that neither of them was saying anything.
And then, green again. Green for the eyes that locked with his, and Draco felt himself go frozen as he held his gaze. For some reason, he choose not to interrupt, even if the only entrance was currently blocked by the girl. He wanted to enter the class as soon as possible, but the need to not make any interaction with the green eyed boy was stronger. He watched as the boy with a visible blush, but cold eyes, turned to the girl and whispered something in her ear. The girl's shoulders dropped, her breath hitched, and she quickly apologized before she turned around and Draco could easily see the tears in her eyes. She ran towards the stairs and when Draco turned, he saw green again. Those careful and warm eyes would soon be the death of him.

Before Harry could get the full sentence out of his mouth, Hermione cradled him into a quick hug and then placed all of the books she was carrying into his hands. They weighed Harry down and he caught them in a tighter hold before they could slip and fall onto the ground. He looked over his friends in question.
Theo's gaze shifted towards Blaise, a sudden glint in his eyes, "Only if you ask nicely, it's not that hard, c'mon.", he mischievously smiled as he heard Blaise's gasp, sleep long gone from his features.
"Potter," He says and bows his blonde head, "How are yo-
Luna gives Potter a look I don't miss but can't quite puzzle out.
That's definitely more than I thought. My Gringott's balance could take the hit though, after the war I received more misguided 'donations' then I could ever spend. Hermione has been helping me sort out causes to fund and businesses to invest in to help build Diagon Alley back to what it was.
"Looks good," I say and Hermione agrees, leaning over to give Ron a peck on the cheek. Ron's cooking has gotten leaps and bounds better than it had been now that he has to cook it himself and seeing the mouthwatering dish I believe Ron inherited Mrs. Weasley’s talent.
"Wha- No. You're not giving me your snake."
"So, you

, waddya think he's got under those funny clothes?"
I take myself in hand, warm water sliding down my back, and close my eyes. Warm hands replace the water, stroking my spine and a muscled chest pressed tight against my back. Darkly tanned hands grip my pale hips and an open mouth kiss travels down my throat to my shoulder.
"-so Hermione went into the girls lavatory and took her share of the potion, only to realize it wasn't Millicent's hair that she got, but her cats. She was alright though, just funny looking for a bit."
Charles comes stalking back, a perky looking woman about my height, trailing behind. She smiles widely at me, her red lips stretched taunt, "Hello Draco! My name is Tammy!"
"No girlfriend. I don't think you need anymore wine."
I crack open the battered door and poke my head out, expecting maybe one of my elusive neighbors, but instead see a pure black Kneazle waiting patiently. It slips through the crack in the door and I jump back, losing one of my slippers as I step harshly on my bad foot.
"It's very likely. Perhaps you should ask your neighbors who owns it?"
The image of a shirtless Harry, dripping water in a towel is just what I need burned into my memory. His rich tan skin and dark chest hair shined with drops of water like some sort of erotic painting, a study in contrasts against the pristine towel. Or potentially my hand splayed across his broad chest.
My actual name, not Potter, though that too is something coming from his posh mouth. The two syllables a memory in the Pensive, when Draco would shout across the Quidditch field, in the corridors. Always to rile me up and it always worked. The never-ending urge to hit his Ferret face transforming into the confusing urge to cradle his sharp jaw and taste his lips.
"What!" Charles exclaims, "I didn't do anything!"
Hermione hops up and gives me a short hug, her loosened, wild bush of hair attacking my face. "How did things go at Luna's with Malfoy there?"
"Hermione," I say, crossing my arms over my worn out quidditch jersey that has gotten rather tight in the years since I was on the team. It's so comfortable though in cold weather because of the heating charms interwoven in the fabric.
I clumsily rub my hole, pressing my fingertips against it and gasp at the pressure.
It made sense why they would hire a cleaner for a party, so the groom to be wouldn't have to clean up afterwards.
I follow blindly though my mother’s ancestral home, all dark textured wallpaper and missing portraits.
I fumble with my card and the people waiting to exit the death machine radiate annoyance. Once the fee is paid, I practically run from the bus and to a shop to buy a map.
It makes sense, the memories from the Yule Ball are still tangible. The pair of them were matching, everyone thought they looked so compatible. Whether it was because of their matching skin or how easily they danced together, I haven't a clue. Everyone was more than star struck that night.
I scratched the back of my neck, "Uh, he's doing well actually."
I didn't mind it getting messy and though it still looked proper enough for a Muggle job.
I itch to grab my wand and spell their balls off from the sheer mortification. They think I’m a
With the birds being so happy and free to fly about, they choose their owners instead of the other way around.
"I'm here for a job interview. Your manager said to come here, so here I am."
"Oh, hello Draco." Luna says with an earnest smile. I shuffle my feet, remembering the last time I saw her. She was held in the cellar of the Manor for many weeks during the war, only spared because of her family connection to mine, being a cousin stricken from the family tree. She was stolen as bait for Potter and his friends. Just because she was spared didn't mean she was taken care of.
Draco
I focus on her, brows furrowing in confusion, "Yes, I just returned her to her body. How did you know?"
I take a drink of my butterbeer and let my head
I sigh and rub my eyes. Taking a minute to round up my scattered thoughts, I start.
Sitting on the toilet seat, I try to fashion a wrap from toilet tissue and a sock, wincing every time I move my sensitive ankle. I should have taken healer classes at Hogwarts or at least paid attention to Madam Pomfrey’s seminar Fifth year. It would have come handy in the war, but I was too busy being a total twat, hatching schemes to humiliate Potter.
I'll have to return her. The sooner the better. She's only a baby, her species living almost to three hundred years old. She doesn't have any control yet, not able to return to her body after entering my mind unless she's in close proximity and encouragement.
I remember clearly walking in the road, seeing the Muggle car, and then...waking up on the grass? How?
I drop my roller brush, splattering the grey paint all over the tarp.
I beat the door with the knocker until my arm is tired and I feel ice forming on my soaked clothes. My desperation turns to anger. And without thought, I fling a stinging hex at the door. Seeing my magic be absorbed by the wards, I huff a cold breath and send a jelly legs, followed by a bat bogey . The door absorbs the childish magic with an angry red ripple.
I toss myself carelessly onto my bed, cat bouncing with a disgruntled hiss and a swat at my face.
I stroke Tasha and scowl, "Fine. The tank and all I would guess to be at maybe 100 Gallons. I'm not sure exactly, but some of her potions are rather hard to come by and take a hand more practiced than mine."
The sound cuts through the quiet again, this time a distinctive animal noise coming from the front door.
While writing this I had a thought- In reality owls are nocturnal so why do owls deliver mail during the day in Harry Potter? It makes no sense lol so I just decided they're magical owls.
I abandon my cleaning efforts for the oven and quickly take the gloves off before getting out my wand, racking my brain for some spell that might work on the ugly beast.
Again, he squeezes my thighs, "Oh really? You like me now?"
Oh, Draco.
dating when my name is spoken like a blessing.
The list drags on and on and I fall asleep on my back in the middle of an already cursed day.
"Draco! When'd you get here?"
How am I supposed to take a cock up my ass if I can't even fit my fingers? Maybe it'd be a good thing if Harry has a small member. Not that I'll ever experience that particular pleasure.
I probably shouldn't be doing this in the first place. It's out of line, Malfoy just wants to see his snake, not be caught in dinner plans he didn't consent to. But he may appreciate a nice meal and stay around longer, that he'll feel welcomed.
Hot tears are pouring out of my eyes and soaking Harry's shirt. His big hands squeeze my thighs and he asks in a soft voice, "You alright?"
I sniff and wipe my nose on his shirt, "I am such an awful drunk."
I would fake offense and when they turn to me I would steal a kiss from their pink lips and haul them up into my arms, moving into the bedroom to dump them onto the bed.
"Oh hello, Harry. Are you
The man looks to his friends who go still before bursting into laughter, alcohol sloshing everywhere as they grab each other for support.
Luna nods absent-mindedly and looks around at the partway stripped wallpaper, where lighter rectangular patches reveal where paintings were hung for far too long. Big strips of it have been removed and other parts have brightly colored paint swatches over top.
here to strip. Why don't you employ male cleaners?"
Draco groans, jostling Tasha who's draped over him like a content kneazle.
She seems to assess me, then kicks her boots off and grabs another 'research' magazine from the natural wood coffee table, "I'm just surprised. You've hated each other for years."
I look at her, eyes wide, "Oh. So, it's one of your rescues?"
Draco bows head again, but this time he's hiding a smile that makes my doubts vanish for a moment.
came to your door in tears, gave you his snake
We finished up the meal with occasional awkward pleasantries. Draco was obviously uncomfortable and I was scared to open my mouth or else any number of things could have spilled out. All of it true but doubtlessly idiotic and uncalled for.
"So does Saturday sound good? I'm not sure where you're place is so you'll have to Apparate to Grimmauld. Or I can pick you up after Luna's, it's your choice."
What am I supposed to do with myself between now and Saturday?
How different would this view be if the war ended any other way? The Dark Lord was full of hatred for the Muggles, far greater than any varying level of resentment the pure bloods held. He wanted to rule over the Muggles, not simply be separate from them.
"What's that?"
I run my hands over my face with a breathy sigh, imagining his warm breath and big hands. All over me. Touching me.
I found Tasha in her terrarium, curled up in Harry's old Quidditch jersey. The sight was more than I was prepared for, the intense desire to curl up in it alongside her was barely manageable.
him. It just doesn't make any sense to me and you're not explaining anything, Harry."
She nods and with an apologizing smile to me, returns to her office.
"When
"Yeah, why're you asking?"
My heart thumps hard against my breast plate, eyes locked with Draco's for a second. He breaks the contact, looking back down, "I really liked the food and I wouldn't mind trying more. And I haven't quite figured out the bus system so it makes sense for us to go together."
"I'm going to try to be a stripper. I've never had a cleaning job before, but I’m hoping I qualify."
Potters grin is pure mischief.
"Harry," Hermione reaches out and takes my hands, "Trust me when I say you have no reason to feel that way. You and Malfoy have always been special to one another and if it's going to happen, it will. Just don't stress and psyche yourself out."
"So she's yours?" She cuts in, eyebrows raised. A thick scarf is wound around her throat; her nose and cheeks rosy from the cold. Her and Ron's apartment doesn't have a floo. The closest access is two blocks away and public.
Potter seems to make a huffing noise, "Of course not."
"Alright. Do you want weekly rent or monthly?"
Draco's clothes are soaked in what I'm guessing is coffee since the logo on his apron says, 'Java Bean'. He's standing moodily in the kitchen and I'm not sure whether to laugh or prepare a shield charm.
He said he liked me. He called me handsome.
The lady's eyes go wide and she repeats slowly, "Well, that's nice dear."
He seems embarrassed, flushing red the longer he sits. A Malfoy in a Muggle apartment? Ron will be shocked.
Draco
, more than I thought possible even with the shops large size.
-----
I grind the heels of my hands into my eye sockets until I see colors, trying to rub away the filthy images flooding my mind.
I breathe a sigh of relief.
I shed my jacket and hang it up, "Ron, I told you he's not like that anymore."
My wank a few days ago has plagued me, constantly showing up regardless of what I'm doing and trying to distract myself is pointless. Draco stripping is the last thing I need feeding this growing bonfire of obsession.
"I've never heard her whistle." Potter says to me, watching curiously as she lowers her considerable weight from his arm to the counter top and towards me.
"I actually went for a job interview earlier and it went pretty horribly. I apologize for my ill manners towards you this time and last." He says this stiffly, language stilted and proper. I want to shake him back into his laughing self.
Tasha hissed at my raised voice and I clamped my mouth shut, still holding out the small bag which Potter hesitantly took.
As real as that felt, it wasn't real. I could never date Draco, he is a

Both of the boys kept each other's gazes, suddenly a playful and challenge like atmosphere appearing. Each one dared the other one to do something, but neither of them knew what that something was.
Snape, after he came to the realization that none of the boys were paying attention to what he was saying, rudely shoved both of the potions into Harry's hands, who slightly jumped at the sudden contact, and with a scowl on his face told them, slowly but clearly, "Hurry and drink your potions, then I want both of you out of my classroom.", he slowly turned on his heels and went towards the door, the same murderous calm voice still there, "I have much more important things to do than watch over two irresponsable and chaotic teenagers.", and before he slipped through the door, his cape mimicking his every movement, he said, "Detention, both of you.", and slammed the door.
Harry remembered Parkinson's furious face, furious at Harry for hurting 'our' Draco, her friend, she said.
⋆❀⋅❀⋅❀⋆
Harry repeated the word over and over again like a mantra as he made his way towards the Gryffindor tower after the Potions incident.
Harry acted on instinct. Grabing a firm hold onto Draco, he pulled the other as far away from the potion as he could, his top priority being to keep the other safe.
"Mate,", Ron repeated himself, a tiny bit harsher this time, and Harry finally turned his attention towards his friends, and that was when he realized both of them finished eating their breakfast, while Harry was still only halfway done. Not only that, but Hermione was looking at him with a piercing look, one that was telling him she saw everything right through him, but still, obviously she didn't see enough since she decided to keep quiet for the time being.
"Yeah, yeah, I'm-"
"You would tell us if something was on your mind, right Harry?", interrupted Hermione, her piercing eyes cutting through Harry.
-Clementine
Blue. Blue for Luna's nail polish that was a bit blotchy, nevertheless very pretty. He watched as she proudly showed it off to the Weasley girl whose name Draco forgot. The redhead watched Luna with a fond smile but stiff shoulders as she glanced at the blonde, whose hands were now in hers, making it obvious that her touch was not welcomed, or more welcome than it should have been. Draco settled for the latter.
White as in his hair that lay flat against the library table where he decided to take a break. It had gotten a bit long, and it reminded him of white silk that could be found all over his manor. It was still wet for he had come here after taking a shower and cleaning that gross potion off of his body. After taking a potion that was supposed to reverse any side effect the failed potion had, he headed straight to the library. It was very dark due to it being way past curfew. The full moon shone through the big window, directly where Draco was seated, it being the reason why Draco's hair seemed so white. He took notice of how the stars, with their equality bright light, complimented the mysterious and somehow scary looking full moon. Books were scattered all over the table, but Draco paid no mind to them, as his head lay comfortably on his arms. He closed his eyes, and took a deep breath. It is soon to be tomorrow. Just a few more minutes and another day would be gone, as well as Draco's life. It seems that watching his entire life go to waste was all he could do now. He listened to the old clock tick and tick and tick, as if it was mocking him that he was running out of time. He signed softly, as he stood up and made his way towards the Slytherin common room. No matter how much he dreaded tomorrow, nor how much he wanted to live his last moments in peace, he still found himself wishing that he was in his bed. No matter how much he hated time, it would still go on, with or without him there to witness it.
In case anyone feels the same as Draco is portrayed in this fanfic:
It is a well known fact, one which even Harry himself knew his whole life, well, one way or another. His variation, however, was much milder than the truth which was hidden from him for almost more than ten years, if you count dying in a car accident milder from dying by the hands of a lunatic. They were his parents, all things considered, and dying by either didn't sit well with him. He wanted them alive, he wanted them by his side and watch him grow up just as he would watch them grow old. If he was given the chance to relive everything once again, he would take it, and now as an older version of the previous Harry, he would do everything in his might to protect them.
"No problem Harry,", she said as she took half of the weight from Harry's arms, "You're still giving them a read though.".
I hope you enjoyed it !! It is only the first chapter, and hopefully there will be more to follow.
Rage flashed through Potter's eyes, but before he could say anything professor Snape took a step towards them successfully breaking the argument. As soon as his eyes laid on Draco, he sent him to the hospital wing quickly because God knows what the potion that exploded was. He shot an annoyed glance towards Pancy and Blaise, whose eyes held concern, but otherwise gave him a wink and thumbs up. However, before he exited the classroom he could hear Snape lecture Potter. Taking points from both of their houses was clearly not enough as he heard how both of them deserve detention for this little stunt they pulled.
Also, I am always here to hear anyone out, please remember that you are not alone, find me on tumblr as leaphyy.
Worry. He recognized worry in her voice.
Words: 2696
"Mister Potter.", Severus Snape said, "No yelling in my classroom, 50 points from Gryffindor.", Draco smiled at Harry's groan, and then Snape carefully looked towards their potion, and immediately stopped his steps, a bit of panic in his eyes and the same second he vanished their cauldron. "A few seconds longer,", their professor warned, "And the whole classroom could have gone up in flames.", he looked unamused at Harry's short look of panic and Draco's shift of eyes towards the floor. He took a glimpse at Draco's hidden hand. "Mister Malfoy,", he caught the attention of the white haired teen, and didn't miss the uneasy look the same teen gave him, "Hospital, now.", he said as he dismissed him.
And then, green. Green for the warm eyes that locked with Draco's cold ones.
Red. Red for Pansy's lipstick that surrounded her lips perfectly, making it clear that she spent a lot of time on her makeup this early in the morning.
The second thing he realized was a fresh scent of dried herbs and lavender. It made him feel safe and warm, and he fought off the urge to give into his instincts of just burring his nose into the source of the scent and drift into a well welcomed slumber. Somehow, the scent calmed him down and he hasn't felt safe in a long time. It reminded him of the old flower shop his friends and him visited not too long ago. The section with the dried flowers and herbs was his favorite one, and the scent made him miss the place more than he'd like to admit.
"How come it's only my problem when you are the one who keeps ignoring me!", Harry crossed his arms, caught Draco's stare and narrowed his eyes, "What was so interesting that you weren't able to answer my simple question?", he took a small step back, still directly holding Draco's gaze. Draco could swear he saw him hesitate for a bit, and he suddenly became aware of how much nervous Harry seemed. But, soon enough, Harry found his bravado yet again as he put on a brave and serious face, "Not only today, but with the shelf and the plant from yesterday as well! How come they both caught your attention while I couldn't! It's not fair!", Harry rambled and stiffly shook his head in disbelief, "Honestly, what do I have to do for you to pay attention to me at least for a little bit?"
I focus out the rattling window and watch Muggle London pass by. It was...rather impressive considering they have no magic. The machines flashed brightly and some sort of excitement buzzed in the air. Pedestrians walk quickly, some talking to each other, some speaking into boxes held to their ears.
That was nothing like this. His eyes were crinkled and nose wrinkling as he complains about her tickling him.

It's a much better sight than when I went into Magical Menagerie with Hagrid where all the owls were in cages hardly bigger than themselves.
I rush over to the counter and the strange machine there, trying to smile at a twenty something year old man. The rest of the flock break off and find seats, leaving the man to order.
He throws an apron at me which hits me in the side of the head before I catch it and level a glare at that complete
I lower my wand and cautiously unlock the door.
I squeeze his hand, then notice the red skin there, as if it was recently scalded. He yanks his hand from mine and tucks it underneath his thighs, "I'm learning how to cook."
He reaches a hand out and I slap it away, "Stop making this harder than it has to be, you twat! You really think I’d be here unless I bloody had to? I'm trying to be a better person and I won't let you take that away from me!"
The Ministry had plenty of money to rebuild, bigger and better with more funding and departments, but the threat of corruption that came with that flood of money is very real.
I kick off my shoes and pick them up just to send them flying across the largely empty room. The expensive dress shoes bounce a few times like well thrown skipping rocks, though that does nothing to lift my spirits.
And I'm fucked.
transportation system. Why can't finding a job just be simple? Am I going about it wrong?
It doesn't budge.
Hermione left around 3 to get ready for a date with Ron at some posh restaurant, leaving just Tasha and I to get the actual work done.
I found two businesses that asked for you to come to their shops. One was a family owned corner shop and the other in a different section requesting a 'stripper'.
Muffin can't know.
I stare open mouthed at the door he disappeared through, a sinking feeling at the pit of my stomach.
I shut my eyes tight, willing my member to go down a bit. It's not much to notice, but knowing my luck, Harry will register what's happened.
"Tasha?" I ask, reaching up to bump her. She doesn't react, eyes are fixed far off.
I turn and kick the closest leg in reach, "
Snatching it up, I shove a hand down into it and feel for the velvet bag before grabbing it and offering the small item to Potter, glaring at his watery image through my bloody shameful tears, "Here's her tank and her heat lamp- you'll have to get another bulb- and her favorite rocks and molting potions, and-" I sob again.
I wonder if Potter knows any of this. I'll have to tell him before her next shed, maybe pop in and speak to him later...
An empty bus stop bench sits underneath the warm glow of a street lamp and old homes sleep all around. I sit, casting a warming and a small warding spell to repel any unwanted attention.
My eyebrows shoot upwards, "Really? What was the job?"
I stand to fast and sway a bit, "Fine. Lets go."
Just what I need before tomorrow.
"So you want me to have your snake?" Potter asks, setting a chipped cup in front of me.
Maybe if I can get Kreacher to Apparate over from Hogwarts.
"Uh. Thank you, sir. Just drop me off as soon as you can, please?"
With the feelings rising up in my chest like the dawn, sunshine and warmth seeping into my veins, I groaned silently to myself.
I shrug off the strange desire and sit back, "Don't apologize. You had reason both times and you did leave Tasha with me which more than makes up for it."
"Could you go get her, please?"
Harry Potter asked me out to eat with him, not romantically, but as friends. I can't
Draco's coming over at five.
(See the end of the chapter for
Potter blinks his bottle green eyes framed by those hideous glasses. I wish I could say they didn't do something to me but they did.
The other obnoxious men cheer, one pumping his fist and shouting, "Fuggin' strippers!"
"Is that you, Harry?"
This has become a real problem.
His hands grip my shoulders and I heft him up by his thighs, trying not to think of how closely we're pressed together.
I decide to take a shower to pass the time until Luna shuts her shop down at nine o'clock and heads over. Maybe she'll think of something to return Tasha to her body.
Harry
your clothes haven't been stolen?"
"Fine. I'll just call you Muffin then, how do you like that?"
The only person that can Apparate inside this house is the Lord, which is me since I inherited the title. It seems Draco can defy the wards because of his blood connection to the ancient house.
. The look she sent me was enough to send shudders down my spine.
Because Draco is coming.
So what do you thinks going to happen? And what about that shiny Muggle car? I think it's adorable seeing Draco and Harry treat Tasha like a little baby. And Luna makes every fic better in my opinion.
"I don't want to hold any grudges. The war is over and Draco isn't in Azkaban. All the deserving Death Eaters have been punished. He's on his own and clearly doesn't want charity. He just seemed...different Hermione."
Draco...a stripper?
It wasn't the real thing of course, but a shoddy remake of the Weasley family tradition Harry was seen sporting on more than one occasion. The wool sometimes itched against the skin and is by far the worst quality article of clothing I own, but the knots winding my shoulders relax and my nightmares wash away when I slip it on.
Immediately, a Daily Prophet cretin shoves the latest in front of my face, "Want a copy of the most read Wizarding newspaper in the UK? Get your Daily Prophet! Harry Potter's been seen conversing with Celestina Warbeck- Is it Love? Get your Daily Prophet!"
"Alright," He replies and spitting into his cup once more, he returns my address parchment to me.
A warm smile splits my face, "Thanks."
matter. I can already tell there's a difference in you, Draco, and soon the people that matter will too."
Potter shakes his head. "Never. Everyone from my father’s side is gone and Hogwarts meals are as English as they come. Have you eaten it?"
"Oh hush, Ron, I can't even get you to walk to the shop so you really have no room to talk."
I try to send Luna a look to drop it seeing her unhappy frown, but she drops it and instead says, "Since you know about the Muggle world why don't you teach Draco about it, Harry?"
The strange creaking groan of the doorbell rattles through the house and I shake off the oven mitts, spelling the dishes out from the cupboard and sending everything flying through the hall to the sitting room.
"His magic was extracted, remember? I hear that's as bad as getting the Kiss, except you live." I stated evenly and Seamus nods in agreeance.
Draco scowls at me, but I mutter the incantation and feel the magic pour out of me and onto Draco.
Her eyes shoot open and an excited hiss leaves her as she scents the air with her forked tongue, "
I mostly feel like this was a filler chapter while still allowing some info. I actually had a minute of panic when I sat down at my writing laptop and opened it up to there only being a couple of sentences of chapter nine. In that brief moment I thought I had already posted chapter eight and hadn't wrote for so many days. My brain broke lol.
I check in on a napping Tasha before I take the turmeric yellowed
She shrugs, "Perhaps. Your head is full of Nargles again Harry, are you feeling alright? I haven't seen cousin Draco since the Manor. He always gave me cookies and bandages, you know."

Completely unrelated but I have a frigging embarrassing story to share. I'm never telling anyone I know. So I dropped a nail polish earlier. In the toilet. It sunk straight to the bottom and I could barely see it. I grabbed a coat hanger but that only pushed it further in. There was no way to get it out and I was NOT going to stick my hand in there. So I was kneeling by the toilet, pulse racing with adrenaline while I tried to figure out what to do. I rationalized that if I flushed it, it would MOST LIKELY not break the toilet. It was smaller than a dump so it could theoretically flush. I turned on the sink in case there was a strange noise and then flushed. The nail polish clicked the whole way down but it flushed. I walked out of the bathroom like nothing happened but I can still see the mental image of that nail polish hanging out in our septic tank lolll. What else was I supposed to do?
Another chapter!
I look up from my chips and wince at Dean's expression. Seamus takes Dean's hand and nudges his shoulder.
My foggy head is filled with a high, piercing hissing that's instantly familiar.
magic.
"Yes." I lift the steaming glass halfway to my mouth to blow on it, then realize, "You didn't ask me how I take it."
Three months after surviving a war, I was two knuts shy of a galleon. I would have to be to come to the bloody Savior of the Wizarding World, the boy who lived twice. But seeing no other option, a Slytherin will do as they must.
Draco's on his second glass when the food arrives, steaming and straight off the grill. I'm halfway worried he'll get sloshed at this rate and I won't know what to do with a pissed Draco any better than I know how to handle a sober one.
"Isn't so bad, is it?" I ask.
Muffin continues to look at me with hate filled eyes so I get up and huff an irritated breath.
. He certainly isn't gay.
The bathroom is small and sloppy. Despite my strongest cleaning charms, which did do a toll on the mildew and mold, the mortar of the tiles still looks grimy and the water damage to the ceiling is unsightly. The shower had no curtain when I moved in, so I had to transfigure one from a spare bedsheet. The sink and toilet are right beside one another with no counter space for my many hygiene products.
you going to get a job Harry," Hermione teases, "You and Ron both are lazy oafs."
I almost drop the plate on Tasha, tongue burning and eyes watering as the hot food sears my mouth. The plate now on the table, I reach for the ice water pitcher and pour myself a glass, which I gulp.
Draco
There's a tall man behind the counter in an apron, boredly refilling the pastry case. The sound of the door cheerfully chiming makes him glance up, or, well, down at me.
Draco looks up from Tasha who lets out a warning hiss to me for stealing his attention.
My hand engulfs his, the shake a bit clumsy as he's left handed and I have to switch to my left clumsily so we match.
The foggy air inside the shower makes my gasping breaths a struggle. Water runs in heavy rivets down my back and between my spread cheeks like how I imagine a warm tongue would be.
I hold her tight to me and throw the covers off my lap, jumping off the couch. I pan around the room for shoes, but not seeing a pair I Apparate straight to the front of Luna's shop.
"Oh, hello Harry, you're early!" Luna sing songs with a smile while jiggling the skeleton key to open the flimsy lock. "Did you get me a sour cherry scone?"
Hopefully it will move out soon, but seeing it sprawled happily over my things I know I’m in for a disappointment.
"Hey, get out of here," I order, holding the door wide open and point at the creature threateningly. It pays no mind.
cup and says, "Ya forgot to pay."
I reach in the bag and limit myself to only one, not wanting to appear greedy. "Thank you," I say and take a small bite.
I pry open the gallon of primer, a neutral light grey to be painted over with the baby blue later. I stir the dull shade well and pour it into a roller brush tray.
I laugh out loud. "Draco, you can get a bus pass and you won't have to Apparate anywhere. And the tube is an underground train. Similar to the Hogwarts Express but underground."
"We serve about 25 different drinks here but you only need to learn the top 5 and go from there. This is the expresso machine. You make it single-shot or double shot, adding different things depending on the customer. Pull this here, fill it to here, and add a splash of this- now for an iced coffee you use this machine. Fill this cup with ice first then press this, then these buttons. The whip cream is here and hold it like thi-"
"Oh yes, Harry's taking care of the owls out back. Want a pastry before I show you the animals? Harry brought them. The sour cherry scone is very good."
"Hey Malfoy, how much do you figure this was worth in all?"
One mountain summited, I survey the tasks I still have to do and settle in for a long journey.
"You're pouting, Draco. Feel like going home now?"
Good, I remind myself, this is what she wanted. It's for the best.
"She's right," I agree and place a hand to squeeze Draco's shoulder once, "You don't deserve to be mistreated, Draco. We won't let anything happen to you."
"Ah. When's your next interview then?" I ask and his pale cheeks blush pink.
I have no right in viewing Potter that way. I've made countless bad choices, bullied him, and now he's misguidedly helping me. He doesn't deserve my twisted lust. The innocent crush of a witch is harmless in comparison.
I smile and follow her up the twisting old staircase to a circular room filled floor to head height with lighted terrariums, some large, some small. Snakes, lizards, and frogs of all sorts lay inside.
. He's still Malfoy. But different. He's more...vulnerable. I just can't help but think that he was this way all along. I keep looking back and remembering moments where the Malfoy mask lifted. He saved my life at Malfoy Manor, if he hadn't done what he did who knows which side would have won the war."
"Alright," I repeat, my own lips twitching, "I'll have to look into pricing more, but I'll leave her with you and come back...sometime next week."
It was only when I saw the new shop I reconnected with her, if she hadn't opened her shop I might not have seen her again. Reconnecting is just by chance with no one knowing each other’s new addresses, the Ministry still regrouping, and many moving to other countries to start over.
He looks at me, then quickly back to Luna, "Thank you."

"You know how Dean and Seamus like each other? Like, they're gay? Well I think I might like boys to, but I also like girls.

"No, I haven't. Now let me go."
Saturdays are always lazy days around Grimmauld. Tools lay abandoned and the telly in what used to be the formal sitting room plays movies on the new vr. I've been putting off taking a shower and getting ready to portkey to speak to a
My face twitches with the concentration it takes to
His knees were bouncing up and down slightly, obviously uncomfortable. I glance to the coffee table groaning under the weight of magazines and new paint/carpet/tile samples. The shipment of bathroom tile sits in a mound of straining boxes by the fireplace.
She beams and wraps him in an enthusiastic hug, "Come by tomorrow, it's Ollivander's old building, quite hard to miss. Now we have to catch the portkey, Harry, come on."
"I- uh- I was taking a shower. How'd you get in?"
Sorry for the long wait (as always lol) I love all the kudos and comments! And the date will be in the next chapter so stay tuned ;)
With one last look, I head inside.
"She likes being around the other owls. I'm not sure how she would react to being moved to such a different environment. She's had enough trauma I think...we all have."
I can't help but smile at him. He's so comfortable, so bold, and I'm desperate to say anything clever.
Another chapter! This fic is going so fast, I swear.
I feel sour, thinking of Potter as I have been all night. If this was a date, if he was carrying me home with him, if he felt the same way. It's a sadistic twist of fate that Potter acts this way with me for the sake of friendship and nothing more. He is truly to nice and it's unfair.
?" I ask with a smile.
"Tasha will be waiting." I try to joke.
I stare at my scuffed-up dress shoes and say miserably, "I don't want your bloody tea."
His grey eyes shift to mine, "I don't have a cat, I have a freeloading no-good pest. I've given up trying to be rid of her. Or him. I'm not sure of the gender."
Leaving Grimmauld Place, I walk without such anxiety and my pride intact, 500 gallons in my pocket and plans on my mind.
you feel that way Harry. Now, how about another butterbeer?"
I squeeze my eyes tight, imagining a rough, large hand wrap around me and massaging my aching erection while teeth scrape my thin shoulder. I lean forward, rubbing my head with my thumb and reach behind me to spread my cheeks.
I nod to myself and close the bathroom door behind me.
I take my wand and do that before standing up and facing the mirror to check my reflection. My hair is sticking up in the back and dark circles carve out hollows underneath my tired eyes. My complexion is very grey but for a patch of angry red spots on my chin.
(See the end of the chapter for
But it was a start. No upstanding Wizarding business would take me, and without one of those Muggle driver's licenses it was my best option.
"Hey, has anyone heard anything about Malfoy?" Dean asked with a laugh.
against the scarred wood of the counter.
You'd think I would've grown out of my Draco Malfoy obsession.
An idea has hit me and I can't get the mental image out of my head.
Harry sits on the opposite side of the couch. "She's been eating those little mice that you keep frozen? She tells me when she's hungry and I figure that’s been working."
Potter eyes are as round as his glasses, hair messy and kissing his brow bone. Paint is smudged all over his arms, the light blue a beautiful contrast against his rich skin.
Harry
I can imagine another's voice say my name in an admonishing way, playful smiles and inside jokes passed around over breakfast. Brushing my teeth at night as another finishes up a shower.
The driver has the address pressed flat against the turning wheel and a queasy feeling fills me at the sight of his lone hand holding the wheel. Machines are zipping by and lit signs fill the road like candy jars in Honeydukes.
"Now time to get to work, lazy arse."
"So you're okay with it? And what do you mean Ron noticed?"
I grab my wand from the back pocket of my jeans and pop my bubble head charm, rush out of the room, bolting down the two sets of stairs and down the long central hallway of the first floor.
Charlies scoffs, then rolls his eyes. Dragging his feet he turns to get the manager, and to my shock, mutters, "Fuck'n twink."
"You've met my nephew Charles, hmm? You'll be working alongside him today, learning the ropes and such, I'm sure the two of you will get along like two peas’ in a pod! You both are such nice boys."
The door opens into a towering cage which can barely be called a cage as a large tree sits in the center, filled with owls hooting loudly.
Draco is stroking Tasha's scales, unlooping her from his neck as she hisses unhappily. He takes her over to her tank and sets her down in the large terrarium gently.
The giant rat like creature seems to be entirely Muggle, yet Luna claims it exudes calming magic as it gets along with practically any other animal. I have experienced nothing of the sort, my heart in my throat and hands shaking with nerves upon hearing Potter's voice.
On the other hand, he knew a handful of people who honestly enjoyed it, some even found, if not the class than the process, relaxing. A few of them were muggleborns who described it, "Brewing a potion is as same as cooking." Harry was sure almost no one, not even he himself, agreed with that. The others were all purebloods, and only by that they already had an enormous advantage in the subject, who where taught the act of potion making since their youngest days. Lucky bastards, Harry was sure that without their status they wouldn't be so smug about it.
Blue. Blue for Luna's nail polish that was a bit blotchy, nevertheless very pretty.
Draco took this as his cue to leave. He stood up, stretched a bit, gathered his things and made his way towards the bathroom, looking forward to taking a long and warm shower. He made sure to pack the right books this time, checking if all of his homework was still in place. When it was, he picked out his outfit for the day, a black thin long sleeved v neck, dark green buttoned cardigan to put over the shirt, black pants and shoes and made his way out of the room. Lastly, he took his dark green Slytherin robes, and softly closed the door.
He knew there would come no reply to his question, yet he waited for a few seconds hoping today would be different. Alas, he got his hopes up for nothing.
He was well aware that most of the students shared the same opinion as him. Harry and Ron even heard Hermione complain, even if it was only to herself, about the subject a few times. While Hermione would never herself admit, Harry was always there to lend her his help with his rich and well read vocabulary and openly say: Potions sucked big time.
But he couldn't, for the green belonged to the chocolate haired boy, none other than Harry Potter, and he'd be damned if he found any comfort in the Chosen One at all.
In his defence, Harry did try to call out the other's disinterest a few times, but he had yet to get Draco to react to his calls. If only he could get the blonde to pay attention for a few seconds, to stop Harry from making another horrible mistake. Harry was sure that by now, with Draco's help, even he would have learned how to correctly brew the potion, given it was already the third time they were doing this.
"What?", Harry dragged on, feeling all of the sudden trapped, "Of course not, I got over it like two years ago. What brings something like that up?", he asked forcefully.
"When I told you to keep a close eye on him,", Snape started as he shot a sneer towards the darker boy, dragging out every word tortuously slow, "This was not what I meant."
"You're alright, yes? Nothing happened to you? The potion didn't do any harm, right?", asked Ron as he massaged his red cheeks, "Nothing's bothering you? You seem a bit down.".
In case anyone feels the same as Draco is portrayed in this fanfic:
Yellow. Yellow for the small butterfly clip which pinned down the long amber hair of a fourth year Hufflepuff girl.
He slowly turned his head towards the direction where he knew the green eyed boy would be, preparing himself to come across a muddy green or boring cyan.
-Clementine
Pink. Pink for the shoelaces of a fifth year Ravenclaw in his Charms class whom Draco never paid attention before.
⋆❀⋅❀⋅❀⋆
But Draco didn't hear anything else after the second Harry mentioned the shelf.
He blocked out any sound that came from Harry, deciding that the conversation was not worth it, and in the meantime decided to take a closer look at the plant.
Also, I am always here to hear anyone out, please remember that you are not alone, find me on tumblr as leaphyy.
"What?", Harry defended, angrily finishing his breakfast, "I don't get why it's such a big deal, i know I'm right-"
In reality, he couldn't care less about his friend's nails, but he had to keep the conversation going. Simply hissing at Blaise wouldn't do the trick anymore, if anything the other Slytherin would only use it as a chance to start teasing him about the unwanted eyes, and he wanted to keep the conversation about his obvious stalker to the minimum. His chest tightened as he remembered the deep green eyes and he tried to pay no mind to it. He had to continue with his color observation otherwise he would lose his mind.
In forth year, he finally learnt how to keep all of those feeling under control without the nagging feeling he usually had afterwards.
"Well, good morning to you too mister grumpy." He quietly chuckled as Draco shot him a glare, "And to correct you, no, I couldn't have. Pancy made us go with her shopping yesterday, it was horrible, I mean really!" He put his hand over his mouth for a melodramatic measure, "Not everyone is a study freak like you, you can't honestly expect me to stay up late at night to finish the assignments, I need my beauty sleep." Blaise whined as he took an empty paper and started rapidly writing on it, "Also, your bed hair is horrendous, do something about it."
Blaise took a step too close for Draco's personal liking, but he decided not to take one back only when he saw the concern in his eyes, that Blaise badly hid behind his playful smirk. He put both of his hands on Draco's shoulders, getting his full attention.
"Not again!", Harry groaned, bringing both of his hands to his nose, trying and somehow succeeding to shield himself from the smell.
⋆❀⋅❀⋅❀⋆
Orange, it reminded him of the yesterday's old shelf, that was still there in the classroom not far from him. But this time, the color was more warmer and a bit lighter, thus making it a coral color, not fully orange. Draco normally compared orange and other warm toned colors to warm fall days, blossoming spring and fire, but this time, the plant reminded him of none of it. It somehow made him think of hot summer sun rays bouncing off of the shallow surface of a small pond, that was in the middle of a tangerine tree forest. The smell of the plant did not match its color at all, as it was sour and a bit bitter, making it clear that on its own it was almost not edible at all. Draco noted the small seeds of the plant, surprisingly a deep violet color, and he prepared himself to mix in the last ingredient into the potion at exactly 6:45 pm, that was less than a minute away. At least, tried to prepare himself. As he looked up from his chopping board, he was met with a muddy green.
He forcefully ignored Blaise's cry of  "Fuck you! Also this is the first time this happened, excuse you!", as he closed the door behind him, not bothering to keep it quiet at all.
"How'd you know?", Harry said a bit warily, not yet drinking his.
Instead, Harry decided to choke out:
Harry internally groaned.
"Over my dead body!", the darker boy yelled, and by the look of a few annoyed groans, successfully woke up everyone else in the room.
"Discouraging me?", Harry repeated, growing more and more confused by the second, "What's up with all of these books anyways? As far as I know there are no upcoming tests."
Draco watched as she combed her short black hair carefully with her fingers. Her fringe fell just barely in front of her eyebrows, which were precisely filled in. Her warm light brown eyes playfully narrowed at Blaise.
If it wasn't for a pair of strong but gentle hands that yanked him out of the smoke, and slowly yet firmly led him to the furthest part of the classroom, Draco was sure he would have collapsed then and there. It was an embarrassing enough thought, he never liked being the center of attention in his weakest moments, so he was thankful for the clean and fresh air. He waited a bit, and soon enough, everything became a bit clearer and he was more or less able to become aware of the surroundings around him.
His dragon, which he chose to name Nuri. Hebrew for 'my fire', as his little one will be to him.
Black. Black is for the spilled ink that glamorously covered half of Blaise's bed, alongside with his bedding, dark grey pajamas, books and all of his newly written papers. The black liquid was glossy, and it could've been black glass for all that matters. It was mysterious, and it seemed to lure him in as it were to tell him all the secrets of the world. It reminded him of his father's freshly polished shoes.
Ron lifted his left brow, "Are you sure it's only that?"
Hermione withdrew her hand where it was previously pinching Ron's cheek and looked Harry directly in the eyes. He saw them soften a bit.
"Oh, no. It's just,", Harry whispered as he shifted on his feet a little, "Malfoy got a bit hurt-"
Which brings him to his next conclusion.
"It was rather surprising to see her openly care so much,", said Hermione, her voice as wise as ever, "The Slytherins usually keep to themselves at all times, I'm glad Malfoy has someone so close to him.".
Draco Malfoy had a lot of guts leaving the finishing touches of their potion in Harry's hands, given how disastrous Harry was compared to Draco, who as far as he knew, had the gift of potion making like no one else in this school. Being Snape's favorite helped a lot as well, not like Harry could relate.
"Did it return?", she asked steadily, testing the waters to see if a question like that was fine to ask, and then continued, "The, you know, past habits?" She was standing on thin ice, choosing her steps carefully.
Maybe then Harry would be satisfied-
Were Parkinson and Draco close? If so, then how much close were they?
But he wasn't.
(Also, I might edit the previous chapters, I'm thinking about changing the first one completely. Still don't know about it tho, so please don't be surprised IF it happens.)
Amber. Amber for the hair of the same fourth year Hufflepuff girl he's seen in the morning. He took no notice of her face nor her body, which was curled and a bit exposed as she talked to the boy Draco tried so hard to ignore. If it weren't for the same yellow hair clip and the fact that she was blocking the door of the Potions class, Draco wouldn't have recognized her.
Nuri was only his.
⋆❀⋅❀⋅❀⋆
Until next time ~~
Draco was supposed to be only his.
Potters 'again' utterly flew past his attention, since he was slowly dissociating and losing his senses. His vision was getting blurry, and all of the colors in the classroom started mixing together. Draco noted as the once coral chopped up flower with deep violet seeds, which he cut to pieces beforehand, became foggy and soon that acid yellow. No matter how many times he blinked, the yellow would never leave his sight, and he was once again reminded just how much he despised the color. He couldn't pick up any scent at all anymore, as he was fully surrounded by yellow smoke and found it hard to breathe. His lungs were burning, begging him to take a breath, but he couldn't move, couldn't find fresh air-
It is not a secret that Harry Potter spent all of his life without a single parent. Actually, it is a well known fact in the whole wizarding world, one that the second when you mention his name one of the following things pop up in your mind: Harry Potter is The Boy Who Lived or Harry Potter is the son of the famous Lily and James Potter, both deceased since Halloween 1981.
He took a quick glance towards the attractive boy, making sure to avoid his eyes at all cost. Instead, Draco's eyes traveled across the boy's messy and curly hair, which color reminded him of the deepest dark chocolate he could think of. He held back his thoughts of how it would feel to brush his fingers through it. Draco's eyes suddenly became restless, eager to observe something else, yet he refrained himself of going anywhere else. Alas, he failed, and he passively took notice of the green eyed boy's red crew neck, which held small and delicate gold detailing around the rims. It made him think of-
"Good morning to you too, mister clumsy.", Draco repeated Blaise's words from the morning, smirking a bit at the awkward smile his friend shot him, "Hopefully you solved the little problem from not too long ago, would't want my precious clothing to get ruined by a single drop of that damned ink", he said innocently as he took a second sip from his coffee.
There was no second chance of getting them back once lost.
Draco was hit with nostalgia when he saw how dark the other boy's eyes were, like glassy and black marbles. He perfectly remembered their color after all those nights when both of them tried to find themselves in each other's touch. Nobody knew Draco better than the marble eyed boy, not after all those long nights. Theo knew everything about him, even about the angry red lines which marked both of his arms. Before, he made sure to take care into softly stroking them while promising him that everything was going to be alright. It never did, but Theo didn't need to know that. Just remembering them made him think of a fresh spring morning, the one where the whole nature wakes up and comes alive. Like the first sip of the hot, minty morning tea.
Yeah, maybe he was alright after all.
Yet, even as the heavy doors closed behind them, he could still feel that strong and cold stare, and Draco could only feel his dread rise.
"Hey, you.", he said in a soft voice, his face holding a fond smile and Draco couldn't help but smile back a bit. Theodore always had a soft spot for him. "Did he wake you up as well?"
However, Lucius' sudden change of heart, his sudden scolding, beating, neglect and abuse, did not change the fact that he was still an only child growing up. Till this day, Draco is still thankful for not having to protect anyone from Lucius' cruel wrath, for he would never touch his mother. Only him.
There was silence in the classroom, and if Draco cared more, or Merlin forbid,
"Ron!"
Harry smiled fondly at them, the blurriness disappearing and his vision clearing up. Honestly, these two.
His friends took notice of his actions yet again, but their concerned glances soon turned to confusion as they watched their platinum blonde friend stand up and take out his Herbology book. Draco flipped through a few pages, going over them and making sure he was prepared for the class. Luckily, they didn't have any homework for today, but it gave him ease when he made sure he had everything memorized for the day, even if Herbology was one of his least favorite subjects.
"How mean!", Blaise yelled while he thumped a bit with his foot, but before he could say anything else, a groggy Theodore Nott suddenly sat up, and sent Blaise a look of clear anger and disgust.
After hearing a distant voice, Harry hesitantly turned around and was met with a thick mop of brown and a different mop of curly red hair. Hermione was jogging towards him while Ron was not so far behind, both of them a bit out of breath and worry lines deep on their foreheads. Hermione was barely keeping hold on all of her books in her hands, a few papers flying off here and there, while Ron was stretching his arms around and collecting said papers.
Orange. Such a bright and deep orange, someone could mistake it for a fire.
Red, or rather crimson. Crimson for the smooth and warm blood that slowly, yet steady, flowed down both of his forearms, one enduring a lot more damage than the other, for obvious reasons. Draco watched as the mark, that was as dark as Blaise's not so long ago spilled ink, disappeared behind the crimson substance and left agony in its wake. The scene reminded him of melting ice, for as he longer left his arm in his sight, the more damage it would endure, and then he would be left to watch as his skin melted right in front of his gaze and dripped to the wet bathroom floor. Understandably, the feeling of it was noting like melting ice, it was far from actually. The hot and burning pain could only be described as what it exactly was, pain. He could describe it as sitting in front of an enormous fire in a hot and barely endurable summer mid day. It was just unpleasant.
He walked out of the hospital wing the second after Madam Pomfrey handed him a calming balm, which would hopefully get rid of the burn sooner rather than later. He didn't bother to thank her nor be respectful, and before he closed the door without saying goodbye, he heard a quiet displeasing sigh. He used the balm right after he closed the door, halting before it, and carefully smearing it all over his palm. He exhaled a sigh in relief when he felt the pain calming itself, and noticed the balm started its magical healing right away. He stretched his hand a few times, and soon enough he could close it. He skin impressively regrew not soon after, and he gave a pleasing smile when he saw a pale shade of white cover the ugly mess behind it. It did leave a huge pink scarred tissue behind, but he was told it would soon disappear as well.
"Nice to know Hogwarts wasn't all bad for everyone. You, of course, had everyone's fair share of both. You could make friends with a rock Potter."
"It's a Muggle flat a ways away from here. There's no floo network so I Apparate."
I bow slightly to her and let my smile show, "Hello, Cousin."
He shakes his head and stands as well. The apron he was wearing still had some stains despite my earlier cleaning spell. There's a name tag that reads, "Annabeth."
I fix what I can, wetting my hair and scrubbing my face, but my robes I have to transfix into more Muggle looking clothes. I was never talented in Transfiguration, so the end result leaves something to be desired, but it's as good as it's going to get.
"Come on, go back home, please." I beg the Kneazle who sits staring at me not three meters away. It blinks languidly and flicks it's smooth tail.
One lizard, a purple and green stripped creature blinks lazily at me and walks up to peer through the glass, flicking out it's long tongue to scent the air.
Draco grimaces.
Maybe I’m bisexual as well? Because I do think women are pretty. Hermione and Luna are very pretty but I would never date either of them for obvious reasons. Same reason I wasn't attracted to Ginny.
"Hello?" I call, voice uncertain, and Potter fumbles before dropping the bucket, the tiny owl on his head flying off with a screech.
He glances down and takes out his wand to spell away the apron, leaving him in a rumbled button down and creased slacks.
Harry shakes his head, "No. I've been thinking of taking Matilda home though. She's not much good for a letter owl but she likes me."
When I cast another
"Can you go check on the owls, Harry?" Luna calls out over the waking squawks of the birds and I give her a thumbs up.
So that was chapter 12 and the 'date' still isn't over! How does Draco end up so drunk and what happens next hmmmm. You'll only have to wait 6 more months lollll
. A part of me feels like I need a shower, but the rest of me aches.
"Don't you have a home to be at?" I call to the Kneazle. It's pitch black coat is shiny and I can't see its ribs though it's healthy. It looks young and was utterly ignoring me".
is playing and I'm only half paying attention as Tasha keeps nudging and nipping at my feet underneath the blanket.
His hand around his cock. It's probably long and thick, his fist a loose grip as he thrusts up into it. Big enough he would have to prep a hole really well before fucking it.
This is a short chapter but Harry spilled the tea. Literally.
"Oh good, I'm starving." Draco searches the table, then falters, "I think they forgot to bring the silverware."
The second time she tries the lever, it releases and I breath a deep breath from where I'm propping myself up on the counter and rubbing my head.
Draco laughs, turning to me, "It smells
Harry
"I've only had two and a half glasses of wine Potter. I'm French by blood, I can surely handle my drinks."
Potter coughs, "I'll just go get dressed, then we can go catch the Portkey?"
Seamus nodded, "Didn't she try to had you over to You-Know-Who, Harry? During the battle?"
"Yes, there are so many damaged animals out there, especially right after the war. I can't take many of the larger creatures like Hippogriffs but other places do."
I move to grab his legs with a grin and he jumps back.
A pretty Indian waitress comes by and asks us our drink preferences. Potter orders a beer and I order some sort of spicy Indian wine and pray to Merlin that it comes quick.
But Muffins gone so I grab my pillow and position it under my hips so I'm straddling it and grinding into the fabric.
My mind flashes back to the shower fantasy, his hands on my pale hips that my traitor brain created.
I shrug awkwardly and push my glasses back up from where they've slipped. "It's the right thing I suppose. And a bit of a habit."
"He actually isn't, not really. He's still Draco, but just not as prejudiced.”
I reach for a small glass jar and dab the spot remover on my chin, seeing them instantly vanish for me to deal with later. I spell my hair back from my face and tidy up the rebelling strands with water in substitute of my long-gone pomade. I meet my eyes a moment, seeing an unsettling expression reflected back, before glancing away.
I nod, eyes stuck to the food despite the wriggling snake trying to worm her way underneath my shirt.
Last week I ordered a new stove and it arrived this morning, leaving me to the task of moving the two-ton solid-iron monster from Salazar knows what century out of the house or at least to the attic.
"Hello?" I tense, painfully aware I’m without my wand. Or clothes of any sort.
"Yeah, so stop nagging us, Hermione." Ron jokes and Hermione shoots him a well humored glare.
I shrug, painstakingly trying to appear casual, but my heart is beating in my ears at seeing the sunlight stream across Potter's face. And his wild hair where a stray feather is trapped in the untamed curls.
I sit up and take a deep gasp of air, pulling the cheque from my pants and spelling it over to the rickety table before I get the urge to shred it because I don't
"What'm I 'sposed to do with that?" He laughs and his voice seems to boom off the metal walls.
"That's nice, dear. What job interview's this late on a Saturday?"
Another round of laughter persists and my fingers dig deeply into the flesh of my palms. Heat rises to my head until I feel like a steaming kettle because
Another chapter! It takes longer to edit than to write ;-;
"I'm doing well, thank you." I reply and Luna frowns at me.
I huff out a breath, smoke rising from my mouth from the cold, "Get on my back, Draco, or I'll throw you over my shoulder."
"Come on," Potter says firmly and steps back to allow me though. I clutch my hideous bag to my chest and for some reason can't find it within myself to disobey.
"Just take her, Potter." My voice comes out as tight as a bow string, threatening to snap and unleash an avalanche of bleeding emotion.
She gets up and moves away from me, sitting down at the other end of the bench. How rude. Though not incomparable to how I would act when faced with the unprivileged.
I reach out a hand and she shakes it surprisingly hard, jarring my shoulder.
"'ve you never rode a bus 'fore, lad? That's not how these things work." He snorts and jabs a meaty finger to the seat right behind him, "Sit there."
Draco
"A decent portion," I mumble, directing all my attention to Tasha for comfort.
I agree. With Tasha being white I've always focused more on her appetite and temperament, though sometimes I notice her scales turning dull.
"He's gotta be a posh twat still, come on."
I turn just in time to see the glossy paint of a Muggle vehicle baring down on me.
"That'd be great." I assure him and summon a bank note and pen, scribbling the amount and my signature.
It's early but there are still customers inside, a witch and her young daughter watching the bright birds and others looking in cages.
"Why don't you?" I ask.
"Thank Harry, he brought them. Perhaps you want to see the snakes first? A wonderful Blue Grass Viper just came in, it has the most wonderful white glow. It's not very tame though despite Harry's efforts."
