Kreacher had already, by this time, covered Draco with two of the blankets and was tucking him in. As Harry sat on the bed, holding the black pyjama top in his hand, he felt the heat radiate around him.
Miss Payne arrived first, at half past seven, and she started brewing the Murtlap Essence that she had struggled with before. It was a very simple potion for a fifth year, mostly made up of strained pickled tentacles of Murtlaps, but the girl had managed to screw up the order and the stirring. He hoped that she would gain confidence by completing this easier potion successfully.
Draco Malfoy was a bit like a magnet though; whenever Harry was around the blond man, he was drawn to him. Before, he was drawn to him for other reasons, but now … now Draco was like a muggle yo-yo. Up, down, and never knowing which ‘Malfoy’ persona you would get. The one he had the privilege to see during their first coffee on Wednesday the 25
be … but this one isn’t.” Harry tried, still feeling like a bloody simpleton. As many dreams and visions that he’d secretly envisioned, of a life with Draco, not once had he imagined having to care for the man as if he were a child. “Will you trust me? Will you tell me if you see something else, and try not to be scared of it?” Harry asked. “I won’t let anything hurt you.” He added.
“You know what I did to her Potter. The things I made her do under the Imperius Curse. I never meant for Katie – for Weasley – for… I never wanted to hurt-”
Harry read the words twice to be sure he hadn’t missed anything. Everything Tau had said made sense – unsurprisingly. Harry, however, thought it a shame that the man’s fears prevented him from accepting something good.
don’t really send gifts, and if they do, or if they send cards, they get redirected to Gringotts. As for the Weasleys, Molly’s letter was apologetic but the owls were worked into exhaustion this year and Ruffles, their family owl, couldn’t be expected to carry them all on his own so she just sent the jumper and mince pies along with the cards. Ron’s owl, Pigwidgeon, couldn’t carry the gifts on his own either, and he’s a bit clumsy.” Harry sighed again. “I really don’t know why they can’t just say the jumper and the mince pies are from the whole family, I really don’t need gifts from everyone separately.”
Wouldn't that be funny; Harry potter, the golden boy that everyone wants a piece of, arrested for breaking a dating service agreement.
“Actually, you prat,” Harry chuckled. “…I did! Right before that dumb reporter tried his luck. Remember?”
Was he that desperate for company, for connection and love, that he would dive right in and take whatever came? Was he really that easy?
The fact was he didn’t care. He didn’t care what Tau had done in his past. If he one day met up with him, and he really hope he did, he would find out the blond man’s history then. Tau was funny, sweet in his own way, arrogant defiantly, but so interesting and charismatic. He loved talking to the blond, loved trying to figure him out like a tricky puzzle.
“I’ll be right out!” Said Harry, around a mouth full of toothbrush and toothpaste, and then started to panic when he realised, he’d left his wand on the bed – forgetting it in his need for the loo and his deep thoughts, and he hadn’t prepared his clothes for the day either. He would have used a wandless summoning charm, but without knowing what clothes he wanted specifically, there was no guarantee that he would summon suitable clothes.
Harry chuckled. They continued talking for while about small things and work, drinking their coffee and enjoying each other’s company. Harry still felt guilty though; he was taking up Draco’s evening, and the man was obviously not turning him away because he though Harry had another episode and needed companionship.
Draco was in two minds on that statement; it had mostly been a good day, yes, but his feelings were still in chaos behind his mask and walls regarding both Potter and Padfoot. His complete realisation that he was, in fact, in love with Potter, meant nothing! He could play the denial card,
Draco ignored him this time in favour of greeting Mrs Allaway and attending to business. Harry remain quiet until they were exiting the shop, only speaking to say goodbye to Mrs Allaway. Once the door closed behind them, Harry turned to Draco.
“Be careful what you say Alex, I might think you’re being disrespectful.” Harry warned him with a half-smile.
Harry didn't have lessons with Draco agian until Potions class after Lunch. It was double potions, and the new teacher - Professor Linagen, was expectant of mature, sensible, and willing students - anything less and he would throw you from his class room.
“Like I said, make sure he stays in bed and keeps warm. I shan’t be long.” Madam Pomfrey then made her leave, leaving a clueless Harry alone with a sick Draco.
"Thanks," Harry smiled shyly, quickly continuing on, "right, the last stop is a muggle store called Argos. I need to get Arthur's gift."
Together, they had decided what would be the best argument to put forth for the divorce request – mainly that her husband Mr Lucius Abraxas Malfoy, had brought Voldemort into her life and held her in submission under duress. There were other reasons however, such as Lucius’ lack of sexual contact with her after Draco was conceived – unless it was to vent his frustrations in a rather aggressively sexual manner. There was also the fact that she feared for her son’s life, and the aggression Lucius often directed at her when he was angry or frustrated, or when he disagreed with her.
Once the owl had left - after its gratitude for the treats and some affection, Harry noticed the letter had the Le’Amortentia wax seal. He quickly broke the seal and read the letter:
A comfortable silence fell over them as Draco returned to the books, but Harry had a sudden desire for fresh air. He knew he should finish explaining about the Horcruxes soon – the break from the topic wouldn’t satisfy Draco for long, he’d have question later for sure. At least he’d accomplished one of the things he had wanted to achieve – to get Draco to open up to him a little.
Harry smiled in understanding, nodding, and wishing that the Slytherin students didn’t have such high expectations on decorum and speech and the like. “Christmas does have a way to unleash immaturity,” Harry said, thinking back to his and Draco’s snow fight, “but at least something good came out of me making a fool of myself yesterday.” He smiled at the boy, glad to see him return the smile – albeit shyly.
“I’m happy to. Do you have the Malfoy vault records by any chance; we’ll need them to prove that Narcissa didn’t receive her thirty percent?” Harry asked, suddenly remembering.
“True that!” Harry chuckled; Minerva certainly would hex them into the next year if they didn’t meet the requirements. Draco walked with him to the door to see him out. Harry stepped into the hallway before turning around. “Night Draco.”
Draco suddenly stumbled to his feet to use the restroom, and Harry laughed as he almost walked into the door frame. Harry pulled himself up onto the armchair, just catching platinum-blond hair vanish into the bathroom, and then Tau came to his mind quite suddenly.
Draco snorted… chuckled… and then started laughing that adorable, heart warming quiet laugh of his. Harry found his smile, his laughter, so contagious that he couldn’t help the mirth that rose up and burst from his lips in joyful laughter.
“The prejudice against my house is not as it once was; I was surprised to see the unity of all four when I returned, but Silas’s attitude hasn’t changed with the times. I see a teenage boy holding onto to archaic and dark views, views similar to those that dark lord once held. I would not underestimate him, and I would be careful –- he holds a grudge against you Potter - Harry, that much was obvious during his detentions with me.”
Harry: "I said I was done - I'm not playing games anymore. I'm fed up of feeling like a ball in a ping pong machine."
Harry blinked; his steps faltered. Is that what he really wanted? Was he ready for that step? Stranger things had certainly happened, but … It was hopeless wasn’t it?
for Merlin's sake! You have to understand, my reactions are fundamentally attributed to my upbringing by a useless cunt of a father. I was psychologically conditioned,  indoctrinated, brainwashed! I've grown up with the belief that a Malfoy must never show their emotions, among a shit ton of others. It's second nature to me now, you see? It's like
Harry: "Yeah. It was my Godfathers before he died. It needs a huge make over. I figured I'd go have a look at it over the holiday. God knows, I may need some space from the Weasley's. They're really the only family I have, I love them dearly ... but it can get a bit chaotic and over-whelming."
Draco pointed to a small box, wrapped in red and green stained paper – it currently sat on the coffee table between the two armchairs across the room. Draco had planned on just leaving it there for Harry to find, planning on feigning indifference and passing it off as unimportant – just a gift, nothing more. Harry obviously hadn’t noticed, but Draco had an unexpected desire to point it out just then.
Situated on his bed comfortably, a mug of steaming hot coffee on his bedside table, Harry wrote to Tau using his magical Parchment and Quill.
Friday, 2nd October, Midnight at astronomy tower. Draco looks down ashamed, but Harry takes his hand hesitantly between his own.
After returning the quill and parchment to the draw in his bedside table, Harry settled down into bed to sleep. With his mind playing over the different possible scenarios of Tau and Padfoot’s inevitable meeting, it was a while before he drifted off… and straight into throes of nightmares:
“Together then?” Harry asked, smirking at how awkward this had become, hoping his face wasn’t as flushed as it felt. He looked down at his own present, unwilling to look at Draco’s face. Surely it shouldn’t be this uncomfortable, two friends exchanging gifts on Christmas morning? Oh, but he wished they were more than that, and Draco’s reaction to his present was obviously very important to him.
“I asked the students once – last year in fact, to revise the three unforgivable curses and explain the signs, how to counter them, and what to do if you suspected someone to be Imperiused. Mr Avery’s essay stated that the ministry was filled with fools to have banned them, believing that the killing curse should be used to remove criminals that deserved it, permanently. He went on to express his opinion that if you allowed yourself to be Imperiused then you deserved to be used as the ‘weak-minded idiot that you obviously were’. His opinion of the cruciatus cruse, was that it was useful.” Harry paused to rub his face before continuing, sighing before taking a deep breath.
Professor McGonagall: "Without prof to your claims, I'm afraid I am finding this very hard to believe. I hope this isn't some elaborate plan to get some form of special allowances in your lesson Mr Malfoy."
-Saturday the 5th December: Ginny is in their common room, sitting on Harry's lap. Draco stares at them both angrily.
Neville looked as if he believed the girl – at least to some degree – but Harry wasn’t fooled at all. Miss Payne was obviously lying… the girl was hiding something.
Opening it, he couldn't help but wonder - with a surprising spark of excited anticipation, if the blond man had accepted his request after all. The letter on top was from Malaise Vixen, saying that his mystery man had indeed accepted his request, that he had enclosed his own letter, and that he was rather surprised someone had chosen him out of the surely better prospects.
-It is advised that you listen to the songs (on YouTube perhaps)  as you read this fanfiction to get more of an idea and feel for the story. There is important events and things written between the lines of the lyrics - for example:
Harry held the gift in his hands – still unopened, remembering his own gift that he’d brought for Draco. He felt a slight wash of anxiety… what if Draco hated his gift, what if it didn’t match up to the one Draco had gotten for him. Oh well, he thought, taking a deep breath, he would just have to get this over with and deal with whatever came.
Miss Payne looked nervously between her head of house and her Defence Against the Dark Arts professor. “It’s nothing. I-I thought I’d made a mistake with the potion I was brewing and d-didn’t want to disappoint Professor Malfoy. I-I thought he would be angry at me.”
“I Draco Lucius Malfoy, son of Lucius Abraxas Malfoy and Narcissa Druella Malfoy nee Black, herby agree to the oath, and will never again speak of Horcruxes nor the magic and process involved – except to those that already have this knowledge and bare no ill intent. Absie linguamea aeternum, et ita fieri.”
“Draco and myself believe he intends to harm another teacher.” Harry informed her, sitting down in the chair to the left – in front of Minerva desk.
That night - long after Ron had started snoring, Harry couldn't sleep. He was eager for a reply from Draco, and he couldn't stop thinking about him, especially their last conversation earlier that day.
Harry had caught a glimpse of something shining in the autumn sun. It was about half way toward the giant apple tree that Draco was climbing. He frowned, suddenly standing up to walk away from a confused Ginny - to go investigate. Ginny sighed and followed behind him.
With a fresh tea for himself and a new one for Draco, they sat in the long kitchen at the table. Harry admitted he had awoke from one of his regular nightmares about an hour ago.
They passed a crowd of rosy-cheeked children, pressed up close against the windows of 'Weasley's Wizard Wheezes' with their gloved covered hands. Their innocent faces stared longingly at the brightly animated products on display in the charmed windows - charmed to snow over the various merchandise within, where the assortment of goods popped, cracked, flashed, bounced, and shrieked. Harry smiled at the ooh's' and 'wow's' and other exclamations of amazement and wonder, but his smile turned sombre as he remembered Fred…
Harry was just preparing the defence against the dark’s arts class room - to accommodate the larger number of first years that would be arriving in two weeks, when an Owl started tapping rapidly at one of the windows. Harry smiled as he went to open it; after nineteen years in the Wizarding world, it still amazed him how owls could find him nearly anywhere he went. As long as there was a window - or a way to enter the building, they would find him.
What was even more bizarre, was that it didn't feel like just a song. It was more like a conversation he'd had with Malfoy. The blond git had accused him of finding Ginny less attractive, accused him of being infatuated with him - or something to that degree, and basically admitted that he found him - Harry, attractive. Ridiculous!
Draco walked to counselling after dinner, lost in his thoughts. What would he be made to talk about, to relive and admit? He loathed digging into his emotions, opening old wounds, or talking about things that were unimportant. McGonagall had unfortunately however, deemed in vital for all students that were there during the war, to attend at least one session. If they refused, they would be sent home. They'd be assessed to see if they needed more counselling or not - and he would make sure it was the latter.
“Nothing Mr Potter sir.” The male student - dressed as a Veela with an eye mask on, quickly spoke before the other two could.
With that said, everyone quickly gathered at their designated section of the Great Hall, and Harry went to question Mr Leonard.
Draco gulped down a mouthful of whisky, obviously weighing up his options, but in the end he nodded. “Show us then Potter.”
“It is certainly not nothing! You levitated Mercia’s book into the back of my head!” Harry recognised the boy as Mr Cain Sharrow, a first-year Ravenclaw dressed as … Bertie Bott he assumed, what with the charmed beard, grey suit, and ‘every flavour beans’ as buttons. Cain was pointing angrily at Oscar.
Harry was suddenly overcome with how strange this was, that he was tucking a grown man into bed – a grown man that he had feelings for. Draco was also acting so strange, delirious, delusional…  and even though Harry knew it was the Snowflu at least, it was still weird to see the man acting like this. It didn’t help that Harry was clueless on how to help, that his emotions were swirling in a confused manner, and that he was worried… scared really. Yes, he was scared! Scared that Draco’s symptoms were worse than they should be, or that the man was getting worse, or that he was developing symptoms that he shouldn’t be. Even so, he managed to outwardly remain calm – thank Merlin, trying to do his best as he prayed that Poppy would hurry back – he needed to be assured that Draco was okay.
ask Minerva to assist him, but Draco would have the better chance of getting through to Silas as an ex-death eater, and as Slytherin’s head of house. It all came down to the fact that Draco
“Harry...” Draco knew that he couldn’t say no to Harry, that the raven-haired man was determined to do this, but not only was he concern for Harry’s mental state, the memories Harry wanted to show Silas wouldn’t be great for him either. He had his own scars from the war, his own demons, and he was also wondering if something of that magnitude should even be shown to a child. Harry seemed to read his thoughts though.
He almost headbutted the headboard as he threw his head back. Was he really into tall arrogant pure-bloods, with blond hair, grey eyes, that ate too much chocolate, and had disastrous pasts?
“What's going on here?” Harry’s voice was loud and firm, staring down at the three squabbling students.
Yes, that wasn’t too bad – Draco thought, just work… but now he was desperate for Harry to leave. Each of Harry’s idiosyncrasy and habits were driving him slowly to insanity. Harry fidgeted consistently with his lips – biting, licking, sucking – and every time he ran a hand through his messy raven-hair, it made him look as though he’d been thoroughly shagged into the mattress. He didn’t even want to think about those bright emerald eyes, and the way they had been looking at him…
“You're welcome. Always happy to educate lesser minded beings. You should at least lose the ridiculous teeth Potter – Harry. No vampire walks around with their teeth out like that - they appear before they feast on a poor unfortunate soul, and they are much more terrifying.”
Harry’s grin grew into a knowing look as he decided what he wanted. He could feel the curiosity now radiating from Draco’s body, burning away at his pompous posture and restrained facial expressions.
Harry almost stumbled with the force of such cutting words, with the pain of such blunt rejection, and in a bid to cover it … he did as Draco wished – he left.
“Yep!” Harry replied, promising Draco of his discretion and secrecy. Their shared weaknesses were only between them, and that had somehow brought them closer as friends. A blushing smile was still on Harry’s face as he lowered the fresh coffee onto the table.
“Listen Potter. I just wanted to say I’m sorry. As you so kindly put it, I did indeed act like a ‘prat’ yesterday. We have to work together. It would be nice if we could at least be civil.”
"He loves that broom!" Harry exclaimed, defensively. Draco made a note that Harry's relationship with Teddy was obviously close. "He doesn't know I'm getting him a new one," Harry continued, "but the Nimbus modules have been out dated by the Firebolts and the Volant series. You know that."
Harry looked up at Draco and couldn’t help but wonder what his angle was. Yes, they had a great evening last week - when they had both had a bit too much to drink, but Harry still wasn’t sure that Draco enjoyed his company. This would be the first time that Draco has asked for his company - and not Harry making the invitation, it was rather surprising really. A pleasant surprise actually – Harry decided, seeing as he had started to really enjoy Draco’s company, and he was learning to read the complex man.
Harry and Ron quickly checked their notes, Hermione was working with Neville agian at the back - so they couldn't ask her. Just then Draco turned to face them and snicked along with Blaise.
“Mr Longbottom will be heading down to Hufflepuff house shortly, to make sure the students are ready to leave on time.” Minerva’s her stern face was softened slightly by the mirth she tried valiantly to hide.
Harry: "That! You create problems when there isn't any, and insist on being a prick when I'm just trying to put the past behind us. Can't we just be friends for once, instead of hating each other?"
Draco: "Oh alright. Firstly ... Hermione ... well you and her really, were both raised with muggles. I've noticed
Draco stood there being essentially admonished by Harry. Moving images started to appear around them like fog at first - getting clearer as the song starts.
“Oh, come on Potter! You’re a Gryffindork, so stop trying to Slytherin me and tell me. There must be something you can share that isn’t in that book of yours.” Draco borderline begged, which warmed Harry and threw him for loop simultaneously.
listening but he was also enraptured as soon as Draco had spoken French… it was rather sexy actually.
There was certainly no ‘both’ of them, just one! One gorgeous, charming, intelligent and funny man. A man with a tonne of good-humoured arrogance, an awkward way of expressing concern, and rare smile that could chase away the darkness inside him and brighten a room. A real man - with flaws, fears, doubts, issues and feelings just like himself.
“Enough!” Harry shouted, knowing Draco’s reaction only too well – having personally reacted the same way many times in the past; Draco was angry and humiliated, and snapping insults because it was better to be angry and hated then to face painful emotions. “Of course I don’t bloody enjoy this! I’m trying to help. The last time I checked Draco, that’s what friends do.”
Harry, once again nodded, wondering what she was about to ask him. His fingers twined together nervously, and he hoped it wouldn't be to embarrassing. Malaise started with the usually questions: names, address, and age for example - assuring him that this information was solely for Le'Amortentia's records and would remain secret and confidential to anyone else. Then she started asking other questions for his profile.
A brown haired thirty-two-old man with green eyes, muggle born, with a passion for teaching magical children under eleven. Says he loves kids and wants his own family one day. His quote was – 'You can teach no one, only attempt to provide the conditions in which they can learn themselves.'
meet Draco in Hogsmeade, or even Diagon Ally. Perhaps he could rope Draco into coming Christmas shopping with him, or get his advice on doing up Grimmauld place. Maybe he could invite ... Oh, he was positively addicted to the blond. Maybe he should just stick to the letters, it was safer that way, he wouldn't be tempted to dive in without checking the level of the water first. He was already missing the Slytherin git!
-Thursday 14th. Knocking on Draco's bedroom door. The other 8th years are angry with Harry for different reasons.
He would no doubt get more evidence tomorrow that would shut up the annoying wisps of doubt that remained, but he had his answer – Draco and Tau were one and the same. It was indisputable, but what happened now?
“Well now you know!” Draco snapped, pacing the room. He quickly stopped and turned to face him again. “I suggest you go Potter. It’s getting late.”
“Draco!” Harry interrupted, knowing he’d misunderstood completely. “I, I’m just not sure what it is exactly.” He admitted, feeling almost contrite as he bit his lip.
“Dracula.” Said Harry, frowning as he looked down at himself. He was rather proud of his black cloak – the red silk underside matched his red gothic waist coat, and he couldn’t understand why it wasn’t obvious who he was supposed to be.
Deciding he was far too tired to reply tonight, he slipped the parchment and quill into the draw. Maybe Tau’s message would feel different in the morning. He would reply as soon as he woke up, it wouldn’t do to try tonight; he might write something strange or embarrassing in his tiredness - or say something he shouldn’t.
“I’ll get some us coffee.” Draco nodded. “Do you want to talk about it?” Draco asked, walking to the small kitchenette and started boiling some water.
-The eight-year student in the common room, start singing out side his bedroom door as he slams it closed on them.
Draco yanked up his sleeve in anger, baring the raise Death Eater mark. It didn't shock Harry, but the more recent burn marks over it did.  Draco was shocked when Harry's fingers ran over it gently, the look of concern in his eyes confusing him, and he yanked his arm back returning his sleeve with haste.
– the man looked adorably innocent. Harry blinked; he didn’t know why he’d expected Draco to be the green silk type of man.
“The staff; Minerva, Hagrid, Neville and Hannah, and Filius always gets me something.” Harry shook his head, like he just didn’t understand why they would bother.
“Hey! This is from Molly. She always makes one for me, and I happen to think this has much more value then something meaningless and expensive.”
Draco nodded, but he was coughing an awful lot. Harry rushed to get him a glass of water, which Draco took gladly. The blond then scurried like a frightened mouse back into his sophisticated composure - slamming his mask back into place and trying to hide his embarrassment.
Harry suddenly patted Draco on the shoulder, and stood up rather quickly. “Come on, we best get back I’m afraid. It’s nearly Nine already, we need to be up for work tomorrow. I just hope Minerva doesn’t have kittens that we abscond for the day.” Harry said.
“Harry?” Draco was hesitant. He bit the inside of lip, cursing himself for even daring to ask… What was he even going to ask? Do you fancy me Potter? Kiss me? Ludicrous! He had Padfoot regardless and he was behaving the fool.
“I’ll give you ten seconds to come out guys… then we’ll melt your little fort to a puddle!” Harry called out, laughter ringing around him.
“Ah. Well, I’m sorry to say that after you all hand in your summer essays … I need you all to do a start-of-year recap test.” Harry winced at the noise of protest, the complaints only getting louder the longer he allowed them.
Harry didn’t ask Draco again, not wanting Poppy to overhear them, and he rubbed at Draco’s back to calm the man down. “It’s okay Draco. It’s going to fine. You don’t need to hurt yourself!”
, that made him less than enthusiastic to write sweet nothings in return. There was also his desire to start distancing himself; if he expected Draco to reject him once he knew the truth, then he would not be so hurt when it actually happened… well, that was the theory at least. If truth be told, he was also feeling bad, and the idea of losing Draco was already casting grey rain clouds over him.
“Perhaps we should bring this to Longbottom’s attention; her change in performance and behaviour could be affecting her other classes likewise?” Draco suggested. The girl maybe prone to
He finally calmed down enough to think on his reply, and he could either kill the seed of doubt he’d placed into Draco’s mind and say that his wand-work was above average, or he could have fun with it. He eventually decided to do both.
Samuel shook his head and tried to step around his ‘defence against the dark arts’ teacher, but Harry put his arm out to stop the boy leaving. “If you won’t tell me, I’ll have to take you to your head of house.” Harry waited… but when Samuel said nothing he sighed. “Come with me then!”
there… waiting for him. Harry would be waiting a long time, because Draco knew that he’d be no good for the man that was a divinity.
“Unfortunately, some of the food or drink may be contaminated I’m afraid -- Poisoned.” Professor – and deputy Head master, Filius Flitwick started. The students looked terrified. “I will arrange for safe food and drink to be sent to your dormitories, and you may continue to honour All Hallows' Eve there if you wish to do so, until midnight. Prefects and/or Head of houses are to escort you all back to your dormitories immediately! You will be informed when we have more news.”
“How so?” Draco asked with a slight frown. Harry sighed, thinking of which example to use – there were so many.
Harry shook his head. He knew Draco wasn't evil, but that's all people saw him to be because of his entrapment on the wrong side of the war - so naturally, that's all Draco believed himself to be. Somewhere under that two hundred foot wall, was still an eighteen year old boy that he wanted to be friends with. Something about Draco Malfoy was rather curious, fascinating, enticing, addictive. If it wasn't for the fact that Draco just caused a multitude of problems in his wake, they might have been friends ... and if he - Harry, stopped denying the obvious, stop being so oblivious, he would have to admit his rather strong crush on him.
Draco sighed as the heat seemed to help, even if only slightly. “Thanks.” He said, but frowned once again in shock. “So, that’s normal?” He’d felt the same symptoms in his feet, but he hadn’t realised that they had literally frozen!
Minerva nodded and levitated Camellia into the air. She thanked him before striding out of the Great Hall. Mr Leonard went to follow her, but Harry quickly used a sticking charm on his feet.
Being far to busy stewing in hurt, anger, and guilt ... no one noticed the old muggle enchanted radio 'Pop' into existence.
If he agreed to meet Draco before then, to reveal his true identity, there was a massive chance that Draco would refuse to talk to him again. Yes, he
Harry sighed in feigned remorse. “Well now, how am I not supposed to think about it when you paint such a lovely picture with those elegant words of yours.” Harry smirked.
Saturday morning, the first of January, brought icy winds whistling through the empty Hogwarts corridors, and Harry found himself starting the New Year just as the last one had ended…
Samuel only hesitated for a second, his curiosity obviously getting the better of him. “On Salazar’s honour, I swear I will keep your secret sir.”
Draco was fucking gorgeous – attractively so in the, ‘Mmmm’ department. He was pleasant company for the most part - now that they’d dissolved their enemy status and false notions of each other, and it seemed like Draco enjoyed his company vice versa, but the man was still closed off, guarded, and his personality was mercurial. Draco was also real – very real and very much present.
As he spread the soap over his pale skin, he remembered such embarrassing moments from the last few days - his subconscious mind and desires acting out while his conscious ability was suppressed by his illness. He remembered demanding that Harry stayed with him, feeling safer when the man was there – certainly not something he’d ever humiliate himself admitting in the right state of mind. He remembered Harry taking care when wiping his face with a damp cloth, brushing back his hair from his face… perhaps believing him to be asleep at the time. He remembered many things, things that he would rather forget, but the worse memory – and the one that caused him the most anguish – was when he nearly admitted that he had feelings for Harry yet couldn’t act on them because he was tainted.
The Slytherins were still reserved in nature, despite the slowly growing house unity, and they certainly didn’t like tattling to the teachers unless it benefited them, so getting the truth from Samuel could be difficult. Despite the changes in interhouse equality, Slytherins were still bullied sometimes for their parents or grandparent’s involvement in the war, and some of the students, like Mr Samuel Bartlett here, had no connection whatsoever, but they were targeted just because they wore green. He was sure that Draco had mentioned how Mr Bartlett was the first Slytherin in his family, and how proud he was of the boy for not only his hard work, but also for the boy’s ability to fit into his house despite coming from a family of Hufflepuffs and Gryffindors. The unfair judgment of the boy by other house students, still fell into that old notion that ‘all Slytherins were bad’, and it was kept alive because the offspring of death eaters that did actually exist, mostly ended up in that house. It saddened Harry most grievously, and it certainly wasn’t fair.
Harry rolled his eyes and went back to testing the food with his wand – shaking his head in disbelief. Draco was certainly a massive puzzle; no one could simultaneously insult him and show concern for his well being in the same breath the way this man could. That was another conundrum though, that Draco even cared about him at all.
‘Ah.’ – Harry thought, nodding his understanding; Draco kept referring to his father when he regressed in age, and it was almost as if he was subconsciously missing the man. It was strange that Lucius Malfoy was always the one that Draco mentioned when unaware of his present feeling and memories.
“Food to your room.” Draco interrupted. “Yes, you said. I’m just not sure I believe you.” Draco admitted, returning to his porridge now that it had been sweeten at least.
“That was the past Draco! I don’t give a fuck about that.” Harry told him, meaning every word. Draco rubbed his face and Harry thought he looked confused.
He wanted to rush back to the infirmary and stay by his bedside until he was recovered, to make sure he
-In the shadows of the carriage lit by the few streams of light from the small high windows, Draco takes Harry's hand and rubs his back gently.
“That it may be Potter, but it is still only acceptable as far as living accommodations go. Nothing noble or remarkable about it.” Draco insisted.
"Don't Potter!" Draco pulled back his wrist. "Don't ruin what we have!" His eyes pleaded as they met Harry's begging green ones. "Don't! Nothing can happen between us… I have Padfoot, and you're–"
“What’s going on?” Harry asked, reaching Draco’s bed. He put his bag onto the floor, along with the box he had been carrying.
“Okay fine. Harry … please share with your esteemed work colleague, the stories you never shared with the world.” Draco asked in his pompous smooth voice. Harry didn’t miss the reminder that they were work colleagues and nothing more - most certainly not friends yet.
Avery held his head up high, eyes fixed on Draco’s. It looked like he was going to argue, and Harry wouldn’t be surprised if he did. Silas Avery was a difficult and argumentative child, one that acted extremely entitled and obstinate. Harry use to have difficulties with the boy in defence against the dark arts in the past, often ending with him ignoring rules and injuring other students. Harry had yet to prove that he had been hurting other students for the sheer fun of it, and were not, as Silas had claimed, ‘an accident’. However, with too many incidents, Harry had refused to accept him for N.E.W.T level defence against the dark arts – and was no longer teaching the boy.
Malaise's voice snapped him from his thoughts. "So, a gay or bisexual wizard, any blood status, but no magical creatures' blood for now?"
Harry sent a boiling spell at the snow under Draco’s boots, causing Draco to lose his focus on the spell as he jumped away from the now boiling water. Harry used that few seconds, to free himself and get back to his feet – wand brandished or the next round of friendly attacks.
Draco: "Alright Potter! You're on. I expect to be feed and provided with hydration. No lupin, I'm allergic. Next - we're going to need a quill and a lot of ink, much ..."
Draco: "I'm an arse, I get it but, I'm really trying. Don't give up on me, I'll tell you whatever you want to know, just don't go."
He waved his hand setting the fire in the hearth alight, the orange glow revealing his private chamber at Hogwarts. His heart rate settled with the visual proof that he was safe in bed, but his stomach bucked and sent him racing to his en-suite.
He couldn’t help but feel his smile grow; Harry still had a habit of skipping meals – much to Minerva’s displeasure, and for a moment, Draco wondered when that habit had actually started.
-Lucius appeared in the images, removing his Death Eater mask in the department of mysteries, and pointing his wand at a fifteen year old Harry.
Draco used a simple colour changing charm to turn the water a pastel blue colour. Then sky blue, cerulean blue, sapphire blue, maya blue, azure blue, midnight blue, and steel blue.
“What for?” Harry was bewildered. There was nothing concrete to hold against the boy, and therefore no point in reporting Mr Silas Avery to the Aurors department.
They both drunk their coffee in unison, an ominous feeling – like a chilled draught, swept over them in the sudden silence.
Draco used a spell to melt a bottom section of their snow fort, while the girls pointed their wands at the ground and said, “Gliaciar!”
Draco gasped as the lift moved upwards, but he also noticed how Harry's hands fidgeted, how quiet he had become. "Is it safe?" He asked.
As if on cue, Neville downed the last of his coffee, nodded to the headmistress, and then excused himself from the table to do just as Minerva had said he would. Draco knew it was hopeless arguing with Minerva; the witch sometimes had uncanny observational skills – perhaps it was the cat in her. He didn’t want anyone getting false ideas that he and Harry were anything more than friends however, so he refused to seem eager about his offered excuse to visit Harry this morning. He couldn’t deny to himself that any excuse to see Potter was a welcomed one.
“Yeah. You’ll be right as rain soon.” Harry assured him, nodding. “You were brought here Sunday evening. It’s Tuesday morning now. The symptoms are supposed to last about forty-eight hours.”
“Professor Snape was a great occlumens though. He’d have to have been, if he was able to fool the -- Tom, for so long that is.” Draco wondered aloud, stopping himself from using ‘The Dark lord’ as his title - he didn't want to give the man the title of 'lord', and Tom seemed fitting seeing as the man had apparently hated it.
Harry sat a bottle of Odgen’s Olde fire whiskey down on the table, with the two glasses already there amongst a range of finger foods Kreacher had brought up - seeing as 6pm was the middle of dinner time, and he didn’t know if Draco intended on eating before he arrived. Harry had eaten at lunch time, and he would be perfectly content with the food Kreacher had brought up. He was wearing black jeans and a pear-green checkered shirt. It was nearly 6pm, and Harry checked the note he’d received from Draco earlier.
Harry: "I don't need this! It's been less than an hour Malfoy! An hour! If we can't even last that long than it obviously won't work between us!"
“And what pray tell, has brought you to that conclusion?” Draco sniffed the air like a pompous prat, but his lips twitched at the memory of words... hundreds of words from one non-judgemental, kind, and challenging man.
Jaylan Thomas, had done particularly well on his article regarding the multiple uses of a single spell. Harry smile at the boys interesting ability to utilize things to their fullest potential. One example Jaylan had given, was that of the Lumos Maxima charm.
“Who?” Neville asked, glancing up at Harry in worry before trying to comfort the distraught Hufflepuff girl.
“I have to!” Draco repeated, fighting to get out of Harry’s sudden hold – trying to return his actions of removing the taint from his skin. “I have to!” He screamed.
what it is – some have knock back effects, or can be explosive. If I hear of anyone in this class doing so, you will receive detention and I will deduct sixty house points for reckless and endangering behaviour, do I make myself clear?”
The Dursleys had raised him to believe he was a freak, and he’d found it hard to trust that anyone would accept him if they knew who he really was. He’d learnt at the age of eleven, that the Dursley's views were wrong however, even if a part of him always suspected, but he’d been forever scarred by them.
As he slipped out of his pajamas and climbed into the shower, he hoped that Tau receive his reply well and didn’t think he was playing the aggrieved party. His intention was to show a degree of sympathising, and to show equal willingness to be as open with Tau as he was with him. He’d never been this open with anyone before, he thought, as the warm water ran over his face, and that was both exciting and terrifying simultaneously.
Harry questioned himself. If was ‘accidental’ then he wouldn’t technically be breaking any rules. Okay, so he
Draco flowed in next to him as he was checking the Halloween punch, and Harry glanced at the uniform the blond was wearing.
His tears ran with the warmth of the water, another allegory for his life perhaps – that his pain and his past, would always corrupt any happiness he found in life.
They would wink at each other, lick their lips,  eye fuck, and whisper seductively to each other in passing.
By breakfast time, he was extremely tired having only slept a few hours. Arthur had gone to work already, Ginny was ignoring him as expected, and George only appear to get some toast before returning to his room. His mood lifted however, when Pigwidgeon returned with a reply. Molly didn't miss the stupid grin on Harry's face when he excused himself from the table to go read his letter.
“I’m not ready to talk about it.” Harry said, not denying that Draco was right. “I really don’t think it’s much of issue though. I do eat Draco! Just because I eat when I feel like it, and not three perfect meals a day, doesn’t mean I’m starving myself.”
Harry was a divinity in his own right, an icon of hope, and a symbol of triumph and peace. Harry was the dawn that drove away the night, the warmth that could melt glaciers, and an addiction that wouldn’t abate.
Before you sit down and watch *Coughs* read, 'Drarry and the magical muggle radio musical' I'd like to say a big thank you for giving this unusual musical-story a look (Even if you read no further than here). If you do plan to read on, then please take note of the following:
-Ginny all in Draco's face now - as Harry won't leave. Draco pushes her back, flips his hair, and walks back to Blaise and Pansy. Harry seems mesmerized by Draco, and refuses to leave.
“I don’t have time to–” Harry cut himself off as he growled in frustration, running a hand down his face.
It was true, Harry had come through for her – something he was eternally grateful to Harry for - and his mother was planning on sending the divorce certificate to her ex-husband as a New Year gift. Lucius had no idea that Narcissa would be a Malfoy no more, and Draco suspected that his father would not be happy. He didn’t care what Lucius thought anymore, his mother deserved happiness after what that bastard put her through... what he’d put them both through. Lucius Malfoy was no longer his father, and even though he would be keeping his Malfoy name, he wanted nothing to do with the man that had sired him.
"Oh, thank Merlin," the shop assistant visibly relaxed. "You have no idea how many customers I've had to turn away today. All our brooms are out of stock." He pulled out a thick leather book, red, and flipped through the pages. "We only have the brooms that have been pre-ordered left." He flipped another page, running his finger over the names, "Teddy you say? Tonks?"
“Don’t worry Mr Bartlett,” Harry spoke on the way down, “if it’s what I think it is, then they only last about twenty minutes.” He was hoping to re-assure the young boy, which judging by the slight relaxing of his stiff posture, he’d succeeded. Something was bothering Harry though… if Samuel had
Harry knew he should have ended the conversation there, dismissed the boy and made his way down to check on Draco – Merlin only knew how much he wanted to, but it could not be said that he didn’t care about the students.
Harry laughed out loud, "It's novelty, not so much for practicality but for… decoration, I guess. I guess some people just like their…" It was Harry's turn to whisper, "their genitals to change colour while they… you know." Harry tried to stifle his mirth so that they didn't draw attention to themselves, but Draco's face didn't make it easy. The glamoured blue eyes that looked at him were squinted in disgust, and a wrinkled noes told Harry Draco's opinion on the item. "It probably makes their bathroom look cool too." He shrugged as he chuckled.
Draco spun around to face young Hufflepuff girl. Miss Payne looked like a deer caught in a Lumos, her face pale, her breathing ragged, and her eyes filled with such fear. He quickly started to approach her but she suddenly fled the room.
Harry felt a hand … a real hand, touching his shoulder. In his delirious state and frantic climb to stay above the flood of images, all he knew what that It was real, solid, and he clung to whoever that hand belonged to. His panicked thoughts chanting
“Blimey Potter -- Harry. That certainly sheds some light on things I’ve wondered for years. Professor Snape had it out for you from day one - everyone could see that, and I always suspected it was more then the fact that you were a Gryffindor.” Draco frowned in thought, sipping his whiskey - his index finger tapping the glass.
Draco: "It's okay Harry, you didn't know. You're right though ... I should have just told you. I let my pride and ego stop me."
If Harry’s nervousness was noticeable, Draco didn’t comment on it. Harry’s heart was trying to come out of his throat, and his hands were slightly sweaty.
No! He had to focus on something else… someone else! Yes, he had found something quite real and wonderful with Padfoot. His only chance at love lay with the mysterious man behind the parchment. It would work as a distraction – as it had been these past couple of day – but it was also something that was truly promising; he
Harry shook his head as he removed his clothes. He walked into his bathroom and turned on the shower. The water heated fast, and after checking he had a towel to use once he was done, he climbed in and let the water cascade down his body.
-His hand roam up under Harry's shirt, Harry grabbing onto the desk tightly. Draco hands start undoing Harry's trousers.
It was obvious that the unexpected apparition had snapped Draco from his temporary state of defeat, but the failed attempts the blond made to reel in his tears and pull himself together, belied his anger. Harry could see beyond that angry façade, beyond the new mask Draco was now wearing, and he saw self-hatred, pain, grief, and hatred at an unfair world.
Harry sighed in relief, watching Draco as he appeared to be sleeping… but then Draco’s breathy voice mumbled… “I think you’re won’erful!”
Ron, Hermione, Draco, and Harry sat at a table finishing their drinks - discussing the interview due to start in 10 minutes.
Harry spent a long while letting his guard down, and explaining his strange condition. When he admitted that twelve years ago, he had a form of post-traumatic stress disorder, Draco admitted his own form of PTSD and nightmares back then. For Harry, the PTSD episodes dwindled over the years until they were no more than the occasional nightmare, but he’d started having episodes of one-tracked thoughts about something that reminded him of the war or other reminders of the past. These one-tracked thoughts - or mind haze episodes, were relatively harmless and infrequent, but they could steal his attention quite suddenly if his mind wasn’t active.
Harry’s head snapped up with a gasp - ‘oh fuck’ on the tip of his tongue. “Sorry.” Harry tried going for shameful instead, but Malfoy just looked like he wanted to strangle him.
“I don’t mind helping. If that’s what your mother really wants then I’ll look into it, but I’ll need your help. I really don’t know how all that stuff works.”
Draco sighed. Harry really didn't have any reason to trust him, so there was no point trying to get him to believe him. He just needed to know if Harry remember or not, now he had his answer.
For one thing, he was even more certain that Tau was in fact, Draco. The ‘error’ Tau claimed to have made with the chocolate, sounded like he had brought the wrong kind, made an error with the baking, or something to that degree, but Harry was almost certain that the so called ‘error’ had been in consuming to much.
“I suspect his deprived childhood…” Madam Pomfrey visibly shook herself, “That is confidential Mr Potter! I must be going!”
“Why are you so curious?” Harry asked in a softer tone, but not quite ready to let go of his defensive posture just yet.
-Harry walks slowly over to Draco, wrapping his arms around his waist from behind He rests his head on Draco's shoulder, eyes looking up at the stars with his lover.
“Mmm. I’d advise more greens, but I fear my concern for your diet would be ill received.” Draco drawled.
The scent of coconut and coco butter wafted his way as Ginny's red hair blew in the wind, but he was rather focused on Draco. His shirt would lift up as he hung from the branch by his hands, exposing his abdomen. It wasn't until Ginny spoke that he looked back at her and smiled.
"I'm almost finished here Draco." Harry tried to contain his mirth, unaware of Draco's darkening thoughts. "I just need to pick up Teddy's; I promised Andromeda I'd buy him a new broom."
-The carriage stops at Hogwarts, and Harry looks around at the grand castle with it's warm glowing light at it's windows.
Harry: "No he doesn't. *He chuckled* I don't want to anger you, and you don't have to tell me, but ... I feel there's something else bothering you, something your too embarrassed or scared to admit or something."
“Fine.” Harry relented eventually, scowling at Draco’s triumph little smirk. “You remind me of Professor Severus Snape.” He said, rather matter-of-fact.
“Mother finalised the draft for you.” Draco said, handing Harry over the small wad of parchment. “If you agree with everything this time, then you only need to copy and sign it, and then send it into the Department of Magical Law Enforcement – Family relations department.”
Harry thought about  the questions Draco had asked him in the shop: What's the room's function? How many windows - what type- what size?  Floor colour, wall colour, ceiling colour, layout etc. So many question for a new couch it was unbelievable ... and he did the same thing for most of the things he'd brought. Harry didn't understood much of it, but just then, he had an idea, an idea that seemed so perfect in more ways then one.
Welcome to my Chérie, parchments and quills story. I hope you enjoy reading my Drarry fanfiction and are kind enough to leave lots of comments if you do XD.
“We don’t exactly have solid proof, but I think we need to be careful – prepared. There’s a possibility that it
“Sirius once told me that all the Black’s were named from constellations or Greek mythology. It wasn’t hard to figure it out.”
“What brings you to this conclusion? It’s a very serious accusation, one that will have to be handled with upmost care and caution. I cannot simply confront Mr Avery without further proof.” Said Minerva, but her tone suggested that she believed them and was hoping they had more to go on.
unwell, he’d wanted to do very illicit things to the delectable body that lay hidden beneath the clothes… wanted to kiss the man into yielding to him... into forgetting about Padfoot and just choosing him instead.
It was strange; the more he tried to remember his missing periods caused by the damn curse, the more they actually flooded back to him - however, they seemed to become reality - no longer imperius-like-singing out of his control. Were they real memories, or fake illusions forced into his mind by magic?
Draco: "Harry! You defeated Voldemort. You brought peace to hundreds of people, gave them justice for their lost family and friends. You prevented thousands - millions of deaths from happening, and you gave everyone that survived a future. I know I can't stop you feeling bad for the lives that were lost - just like I won't ever stop feeling guilty for my part in the war, but you have to see the light too ... or it will destroy you - living in only darkness."
Harry thought, as he utilized yet another warming charm. Draco and himself, both masked under glamour charms to hide their appearance, knew that Diagon Alley would be packed, but it was brutally chaotic!
Draco was all flustered and stuttering, just the way Harry had come to like him actually, but it appeared that Draco had reached his humiliation limit and was about to run.
“Yeah Mr Malfoy, you’re trapped!” Fourth year Gryffindor, Arlan Monero shouted from behind Harry, also with his own red snowball… in fact, all sixteen students that were around Harry had red snowballs – as did Filius Flitwick and Neville Longbottom.
“I had boggarts, pixies, doxies, dust mite, bugs… you name it this place had it.” Harry continued, sitting down the teal coloured sofa to wait for Draco. “So many dark artifacts and rituals had passed this house – the walls vibrated in it. Walburga’s portrait wouldn’t shut the fuck up and-”
After a moment of thought on all sides, the students nodded and decided to let the matter drop. Harry sighed in relief, and made his way back over to the buffet tables. As he glanced up to where he had left Draco, he saw the blond man looking deathly pale. Before he could reach him however, Draco had started his hasty exit from the Great Hall.
"I can do that." Draco nodded. He was glad that Harry had moved on with the conversation, that he'd calmed down and accepted his help, but what was left unsaid was like the dragon in the room; it was unmissable, hot and blazing for notice, and it wouldn't be easily removed.
Floating, carved pumpkins illuminated the Great Hall in autumn-orange light, and a charmed – almost sentient, cold breeze traversed the Hall - sweeping past Harry every few minutes as he checked the food and drink for contamination at the extravagant buffet table.
A woman – defiled – green - snap of bone – blood – joy. It had been a broken link back then – blurry, and he hadn’t known at the time that it was the muggle studies teacher – Professor Burbage. But… he knew now, and he knew that her death had given birth to the seventh Horcrux – Nagini. The sick loop of that memory made his stomach lurch.
“I found her a book on abstinence and told her we didn’t stock the book she wanted.” He struggled to get out his words. “She …. She left in such a hurry, throwing the book down on a shelf on the way out.”
“I might have been better at it if a certain student hadn’t found amusement in sabotaging my work…” Harry smirked when Draco mocked offence at the insinuation. “…Or if my teacher at the time wasn’t an arse.”
“Take this!” Madam Pomfrey ordered, handing over a potion he didn’t recognise – which was strange, he was a potions master!
“Sorry Malfoy. I was just thinking about something.” Harry lifted the last of his lukewarm coffee, drinking the strong liquid to hide his embarrassment. A part of himself was now very conscious of his own messy black hair, and he ignored the itch to try, hopelessly, to flatten it.
“It wasn’t reciprocated." Harry explained. "Severus, met my mother before their first year at Hogwarts - they lived closed to each other in Cokeworth. They became very good friends, but Severus made mistakes and their friendship suffered for it. He never stopped caring for my though." Harry paused and sipped at his whisky. "He hated my father, and by extension, he didn’t like me - I think I reminded him to much of James. My father saved his life once, but it was my godfather’s fault that he needed saving at all. He repaid that life debt in first year, using a counter curse on my broom when it started bucking. Do you remember that?”
Their eyes met, and Draco felt his heart beating like a bucking broom. They were so close and sharing the same air. He couldn’t tear himself away … but he had too! He had to step back, but Harry fucking Potter was staring at him questioningly with those unique and rare emerald eyes of his... and then Potter let him go.
“May I use your restroom?” Harry asked, a little sheepishly. He couldn’t help but feel ashamed of his deception, but he did actually require the use of facilities.
“Stay here Mr Leonard! We need to ask you what happened.” Harry explain to the distraught looking fifth year Gryffindor, un-sticking him from the floor once he’d placed a hand on his shoulder. He shared a quick look at Flitwick, who nodded and climbed up onto one of the small round tables dotted around the room.
“I’ll stay with you.” Harry said, sitting on the bed in an attempt to keep Draco in it. Harry couldn’t help but chuckle though … his mind
Draco: "I never asked you to come to my trial. Saint Potter, protecting Death Eaters. Maybe you require a mind healer."
Harry waited to make sure Draco had finished. It wasn't often he got let in on what Draco was really feeling like this. He then took Draco's hands.
Having already finished planning the schedule to meet the curriculum for the first years’, he was now working on the same plans for the second years. He had to fit in a multitude of topics, from Dark creatures such as Banshees, Cornish pixies and trolls - including the correct way to handle such creatures, to Defence against the dark arts spells, such as the disarming charm or the full body bind curse, and he only had thirty-nine weeks in which to achieve this for all his students - including all the revision for the things that they had learnt from the previous years. The students were not going to be pleased with the amount of homework he had to set them.
Harry sighed. He had to reply to Tau and pull his thoughts out of the black hole that had started to form in his mind. He’d learnt a lot about Tau, but he hadn’t given the man much back. What could he share with Tau that wouldn’t give away his identity?
If Harry had to guess, with Tau being a pure-blood wizard, he would assume that he’d never had muggle chocolates before. Harry hoped Tau wasn’t a pure-blood that was against all thing’s muggle, seeing he still enjoyed many of the thing’s muggles had to offer. Yes, Harry even had a laptop at home, and he still preferred muggle clothes shops.
“Why not?” He shrugged again, ignoring the use of his surname, but Draco leaned closer and whispered into his ear.
“The teenager’s, or your Mothers?” Harry asked, trying not to laugh anymore because his side was already burning … or that could be the fire whiskey … or both.
Harry looked over to where Reese was pointing, and sure enough there was an orange cup with pink lipstick around the top.
Draco had jumped at first, he found her enthusiasm unsettling, and her mumbling wasn't very reassuring. She was batty, strange, and smelt like butter, basil, and incense.
Draco started scratching at the mark – maybe he could scratch it away, maybe if he removed it he could be worthy of Harry’s affections.
“You’re an ignorant, judgmental tosser!” Malfoy’s last words spat at Harry before he flew away in a rage - leaving Harry behind blinking in the sun.
Harry soon finished his pudding, content to watch the students finish their own food, but he watched as Draco took a second helping of double chocolate gateau … … then a third.
George and Angelina had worked hard to maintain the Wesley business, and it was blooming… literally. They'd stopped in earlier to wish them both a Merry Christmas, and they'd brought a few things for the older Weasley children there too.
hoped that Draco wouldn’t stay this way, wouldn’t close off from him, but for now, all he could do was sort out their plans for Mr Avery. Yes, he’d come to talk about the boy, but he’d also hoped to talk to Draco in general… it seemed like Draco wasn’t in the mood for that though.
After agreeing to go see McGonagall after lunch time, Draco eventually persuaded Harry to get dressed and to stop isolating himself in his room. They had decided to go for a walk while they mauled over the facts - what they knew so far, their theories, and revelations forced on them by whatever was happening. Walking along the outskirts of the forbidden forest, Draco stopped.
Traitorous tears pooled in Harry’s eyes as he blinked. He had never been thanked in such a way before; most people thanked him for being a hero, giving him credit for the things he’d never even done - and never showing their gratitude towards others who had also played a part in winning the war.
Harry was always weird with food though, Draco thought, wondering if that was just part of being a Potter or something. He’d noticed Harry’s complete lack of eating routine, how he simply ate when he wanted – which wasn’t much at all; Harry also skipped meals in the Great Hall, and when Draco had asked about it in the past, Harry had just shrugged and said, ‘Kreacher brings me food when I ask for it, I sometimes eat in my private chambers.’ He wasn’t sure why it bothered him or acted like an itch he needed to scratch, Harry wasn’t losing weight or anything, but it was a mystery… and Draco liked to solve mysteries.
“Good. How is Kingsley by the way? He keeps trying to arrange a tea date, but you know how jobs go.” Harry winked at Draco as he took the chair next to the blond. Draco looked surprised, but at least he didn’t seem angry that Harry had intervened. Minerva looked much more relaxed now, her lips still twitching.
With the trip to Homely abode over - blankets, bedding, furniture etc all shrunk down into Harry's store bag, they made their way to Eeylops Owl Emporium.
His fingers continued to fumble together as he waited, and he wondered why he was so nervous this time around. He didn’t want to impress Draco, per se, but he also didn’t want him to have a reason to moan or insult his abilities as a host. ‘
“Get lost Potter!” Draco shoved Harry away from the door, slamming it closed behind him and locking it. He could hear Harry chuckling on the other side – the damn prat was enjoying this.
“Miss Payne!” He called after her, running into the corridor. He’d have chased after her, but with a curse on the tip of his tongue, he remembered Mr Avery.
Harry lifted the blanket to take a look: Draco’s right foot was now a purple-blue colour, with frozen, icy nails… just like his hand had been. Harry got off the bed to find some socks for Draco, not really knowing what else he could do to help the man.
-Sunday the 12th December - Ginny yelling at Harry in the courtyard, Harry grabs her hand and pulls her close to him to calm her down.
Draco walks up to Harry and Ginny, and starts throwing insults - causing Ginny to get off Harry's lap and retaliate.
think of such lascivious things he'd liked to do with Draco's body, when Tau was most likely waiting for his reply! He suddenly felt very naughty indeed, and quite self-abashed.
Harry starting laughing. What else could he do? He had just been insulted along with his profile, picked apart, accused, demanded of, and warned away ... he liked this Tau already. Harry got the strongest impression that Tau wanted him to respond, and he was going to. The poor guy sounded insecure almost, but most definitely arrogant. Maybe it was a mask? A tactic to avoid humiliation and embarrassment perhaps?
He gulped down the last of his coffee, staring disappointedly down at his empty cup. “Kreacher!” He called.
Harry downed the shot of amber liquid and played with the empty glass as he turned to face Draco. He sighed. “I lied by omission. I told only enough that would make sense, yet would keep the world safe.”
“Rags?” Harry feigned outrage. He knew Draco was teasing him, and he loved it. “I brought these in a respectable shop I’ll have you know.”
Harry saw Draco’s pain, felt it even. He knew his comfort wouldn’t be welcome, it was a matter of pride mostly, but his heart ached to help Draco through that pain as Draco was helping him.
Harry swore he saw Minerva’s lips twitch as if holding back humour, and the look of barely restrained outrage on Graves face almost made Harry snort.
Tau certainly knew how to make Harry think about things he wouldn’t have even considered before. Time felt very really to him: Eleven years of suffering with his aunt and uncle - not including the five awful summer holidays there, fourteen years since he lost his godfather, nearly an entire year living from place to place in a tent – with Hermione and Ron twelve-thirteen years ago, and twelve years since the battle of Hogwarts.
Draco stood up and twisted his wand, causing the snow around Harry to crawl over his downed body, attempting to hold him down on the ground.
“I see,” Harry said, grounding himself in the present, and ignoring the echoes of the past, “but what spell did you use?” Harry asked, now keeping his eyes on Draco.
The parchment that Poppy had linked to the spell, started listing the girl’s injuries and illnesses. Poppy ended the spell when she had two years’ worth of data. She sighed, returning her wand to its holster before reading the parchment. She had no idea what she was supposed to be looking for – the girl had a short list, minor injuries, flu, a slight cough…
His body burned with needs, and suddenly… he remembered that night with Draco - how they’d both consumed one too many glasses of fire whiskey, and how he’d briefly had lascivious thoughts of Draco’s attractive body and what he could do with it.
Taking a deep breath, he decided to make coffee for Harry and himself, it would keep his hands busy. The owls he’d let in, were currently sitting on the back of the two wooden, dining room chairs. “You have owls,” Draco called out, “parcels. They were waiting for you in the hallway.” Draco was proud of his ability to
“I didn’t say anything.” Harry held up his hands in a form of pacification, but he still could not contain his mirth. “Can I ask you something though?” He asked a few moments later.
Harry: "You were forced to take that mark. Yes, you did some bad things, but in every other sense ... you're not a Death Eater. You were cleared of all charges at trial."
“The sixth vessel held a part of his soul, yes, but he never intended for it happen, nor did he get the chance to say the spell and make it a true Horcrux because his body was destroyed. That’s why he could never die and stay dead the evil bastard, because -- because a part of his soul always remained earthbound and undamaged. When he –- when he came back in 1995, at the end of – the end of – erm -- fourth year –- he -- he made another one by killing-”
As the Calming Draught started to work, Harry felt burned red with embarrassment and shame. He shakily stood up, glanced at himself in the mirror, and left the bathroom.
Draco’s eyes instantly searched the left-over crowd of students. He found one browned-haired student with wide eyes pointing his wand at Harry – Mr Silas Avery! Silas realised that his spell hadn’t worked, and he ran onto the train before Harry even had a chance to turn around.
“The quill is also muggle made, not much magical about it I’m afraid, but again… I saw the green peacock quill and I thought you would like it.” Harry cleared his throat, deciding to plough on. “May I?” Harry asked, pointing to indicate his desire to show Draco how to use it. Draco nodded his consent, and Harry moved his chair around until he was sitting rather close next to him.
only about six o'clock, and he usually stuck around until later in the evening if they weren't overloaded with homework to grade.
Harry was taken aback for a few seconds, before sighing – Here we go again! Draco had regressed in age once more.
Potter. My business is just that, mine!” Draco went silent for a moment; No, Harry Potter wasn’t an option… but Padfoot was! “Okay fine! So, what if I am?”
Hermione: "Never mind. Right, we will leave you two to it. Mr Forthswrite should be here in a few minutes."
“That’s it?” Draco’s disbelief was a façade. Harry knew that he was asking a lot from the blond with the simple request of being on first name bases - to do so implied they were friends. Harry had learnt a lot about pure-blood customs, and the customs of those in higher standing in the wizarding world. The use of first names were reserved for loved ones and close friends, or for those you were trying to manipulate.
She smiled at her potion professor, apparently relaxing now that she knew she wasn’t being held accountable. “Thank you, sir!” She said, and Draco nodded.
Harry nodded, hoping that Draco would trust him enough after this to share his own burdens. Right now, however, he had to decide where to start. “Have you ever heard of a Horcrux?” Harry asked, raising the glass to his lips to steady his nerves.
Draco: "Why? No one else would, in fact, they would ostracize and admonish you for even speaking to 'Death Eater scum'."
Finally sated by the delicious Hogwarts’ food, Harry sat in the dark-green armchair in Draco’s bedroom, reading from one of the two books that Kreacher had kindly fetched for him. Madam Pomfrey had yet to return, but it hadn’t even been an hour yet so he wasn’t too worried. Minerva had been down to see him while he was eating, asking if he would be willing to make himself available to the Slytherins – should they need their head of house while Draco recovers; Harry had agreed of course.
No! If that were true, he could have had any man that promised loved and devotion - even if they were just after his fame. What if that was the problem though? This was the first man to like him and not know of his fame, and that right there was so appealing - being liked for who he was and not what he had done, or what the books and news had said he’d done anyway. He liked Tau, was sure it was mutual, and was sure they would have at least started a good friendship together if it didn’t lead to romance.
-Harry - watching the images and his boyfriend, takes Draco's left hand in comfort. Draco's eyes are glistening with the promise of silent tears.
“A female colleague at the work…” Harry lied slowly, choosing his words carefully. “When I was doing my Auror training, she had that same parchment and quill Draco. It’s from Le’Amortentia isn’t it?” Harry asked, feigning innocence. His heart was still pounding from the overwhelming evidence. Draco was Tau!
Harry chuckled, and nodded. “Got it! See ya then Draco.” He smiled, then he half-heartedly saluted before turning the corner.
-Wednesday 20th. Harry and Draco find themselves alone in the common room. Harry blocks Draco's door so he can't ignore him.
