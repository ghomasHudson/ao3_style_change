Every word was a bomb exploding within Draco’s chest, but he maintained his neutral expression. Malfoys weren’t affected by petty emotions such as fear and hurt. Malfoys didn’t express vulnerability. And Draco had been taught how to excel at being a Malfoy by the very best.
Harry looked at him curiously, but they had reached the register by then, and Harry was forced to redirect his attention to the cashier instead of Draco's estrangement from his parents.
Draco opened his mouth to list the myriad reasons he had come up with over the course of the last month, but the alcohol combined with the exhaustion he already felt conspired to wipe his mind blank. To cover his confusion, he drank deeply from his bottle, trying to remember why exactly it was a bad idea to indulge Potter. Potter would break it off anyway, Draco was certain of that. So why not let himself be happy until then? Surely wanting affection wasn't a weakness.
"Harry," said Draco in a low voice, turning the name into a question and a reassurance at the same time. He didn't look at Harry as he said it, though, preferring instead to burn a hole into the girl's head with his eyes. If looks could kill, he mused absently, she would have been drawn and quartered by his gaze within seconds.
Sure enough, Harry’s gaze flickered away a moment later. He looked off into the distance for a few seconds. Then he seemed to come to a decision and, returning his gaze to Draco, he said, “This is it, then. We’re done, Draco. I can’t watch you self-destruct like this without even trusting me enough to tell me what’s going on—” He had been getting more heated as he spoke, and he cut himself off now with an explosive sigh. “Look, we both have secrets, but yours are hurting you, and that hurts me to watch. You might be fine with that, but I’m not going to keep hurting myself. More importantly, I won’t let you keep hurting me. I thought you might realize someday you’re not alone anymore, but I see now it was a misguided hope.”
The man was not sore on the eyes, that much was true. His eyes were a piercing green, his nose straight and narrow, his muscles clearly defined. His bronze skin only completed the tantalizing image. Still, his hair was an absolute mess, and his round, wire frame spectacles looked constantly on the verge of slipping down his nose.
Finally Lucius pulled his cane away, but Harry’s head didn’t drop, nor did his glare lose its ferocity. “I’m not the one who involved him, Draco. That mistake was entirely yours.”
"Then why are we just standing here talking? Go on, make the popcorn, we have movies to watch and actors to heckle," Draco said imperiously, urging Harry to start moving.
Something felt off when Draco woke up. The sunlight streaming through his window was hitting his face at the wrong angle, and he winced and rolled over in avoidance. He was strangely well rested, and he had a fleeting desire to burrow into his covers and fall back asleep.
“Who I
“I don’t know that I can,” Harry replied. “I don’t know that I can keep turning a blind eye when you’re being hurt like this. But more than that, I don’t know that I can stay in this relationship, if you won’t let me into your life, or past your walls.”
Slowly, Draco moved to get a better sight line on Harry. He kept Lucius in his field of vision as well, unwilling to give Lucius a chance to deploy any tricks hidden up his well-fitting designer sleeves. He raised the gun and aimed down the sight. The head wasn’t the most effective target, but a point blank shot would be devastating nonetheless. Besides, Draco knew Lucius well enough to suspect he expected a show; aiming for the chest or femoral artery simply did not offer the same melodrama. All the while, Harry’s eyes remained unseeing. Harry’s catatonia was worrying, but Draco filed it away to talk about later. He had other priorities right now.
"Tell me why, then," Potter was saying meanwhile, as Draco fixated on his internal monologue. Potter looked determined, and his tone was fierce. "You're smart, you're witty, you're well-informed. I barely spoke to you for an hour and it was still one of the most interesting conversations I've had recently. You're
"No, me neither," Harry agreed, his voice still hoarse. He fiddled aimlessly with the plastic bottle, tossing it back and forth between his hands. Draco waited silently for a moment longer, thinking Harry might be more inclined to speak now that he had had a few minutes to calm down. Indeed, Harry opened and closed his mouth several times, but to Draco's irritation, nothing came out.
If he drove Harry away now, he would never be able to protect him. He needed to be able to keep Harry safe from whatever Lucius might be planning, and he couldn't do that if Harry kept him at arm's length out of disgust, as he inevitably would once Draco revealed the truth about his past. The best thing for Draco to do right now was to keep this to himself until he could fix the situation.
Draco had finished his lunch and was waiting for Harry to do the same when he grew aware of two wide-eyed girls their age staring at them from across the small restaurant. They were whispering furiously to each other from behind hands raised to their mouths.
Harry didn’t respond, and Draco didn’t press the issue. Some of the pressure had eased upon offering an explanation. He’d achieved a sort of clarity: whether Harry accepted his explanation was out of Draco’s control. That knowledge was tremendously freeing.
He stepped aside and let Harry in, accepting the figurative olive branch and extending one of his own by saying, “Which actors shall we heckle tonight?” As Harry opened a bottle for each of them, Draco retrieved his laptop and settled on the couch. The heat of Harry’s thigh pressed against his was a comfort he’d forgotten; he let himself revel in it for a moment before pulling up Netflix.
When they stood up to leave, Potter offered to walk Draco to wherever he was headed next. Draco wondered why Potter was so eager to spend more time with Draco, but he didn't voice his thoughts. Instead, he simply said, "I'm done with classes for the time being, so I'm just headed back to my dorm," and Potter nodded and fell in step, chatting amiably as they walked.
Potter ducked his head in embarrassment. "Fairly normal, yeah," he admitted. "Sometimes it seems like half the female population is after me, and a quarter of the males as well."
"You don't really mean that," he said. "You wouldn't, anyway, if you knew the truth."
“What if I refuse?” Draco asked, his eyes trained on the pistol. He wrapped his fingers around the grip and tilted it back and forth, testing its weight. It gleamed faintly in the dim light, and the heft of it against Draco’s palm was comforting in its familiarity. Despite himself, Draco felt some of his fear recede now that he had a way to defend himself.
Draco was loathe to leave Harry for the dreary monotone that characterized his next class, but he hadn't missed a lecture yet and he certainly didn't intend to now. He kissed Harry softly, lingering in the sensation. The emotional storm he had weathered this morning seemed as though it had occurred ages ago; his feelings toward Harry then were so disjunct from what they were now that Draco almost couldn't believe he had ever felt that way at all.
Scrawled underneath in the same messy chicken scratch was a phone number. Draco quickly pulled out his own phone and dialed the number in as a new contact, attaching Potter's name to it when he was prompted. Then he shot off a quick text, asking Potter to meet him in the library where they'd first met so many weeks ago, and waited anxiously for a reply.
all of that was? You better start talking, Draco, because the moment my legs stop feeling incorporeal, I will leave, and you will be dead to me.”
However, while Draco was content to wait, Harry wasn’t. A week into the new term, Draco heard a knock on his door and opened it to find Harry on the other side, proffering a pack of beer with a questioning smile. It wasn’t an apology as much as an olive branch, an offering to move into the future without the tension of their fight looming over them. It was also a nod to the first time Harry had visited Draco’s room, and Draco’s lips quirked into a smile at the memory.
“Is he all that’s keeping you here? Are you reluctant to return home because you don’t want to leave him behind? I can make that decision tremendously easy for you,” Lucius drawled. He cocked the gun, and the other Death Eaters followed suit. Draco remained rooted to the spot, frantically trying to find a way to save Harry and escape with both their lives in hand. But it didn’t matter how he approached the situation; he came up blank every time.
"Of course, sorry! Thank you!" said the first girl, her chirpy voice too loud in the now-silent cafe. The pair retreated to their own table as Draco waited for Harry to pick up his trash to throw away.
“Yaxley still has your phone,” he blurted out. He couldn’t think of anything else to say, couldn’t even imagine talking about the ordeal they had both just been through. “I hope you have it backed up because there’s no way to retrieve—”
Instead of looking revolted or scared, as Draco had hoped he might, Harry looked horrified. "That's awful," he said vehemently. "Idiots who say things like that would change their minds in an instant if they got to know you. The real you."
The drive was quiet. Draco spent some time pondering the implications of not being blindfolded. In his experience, Death Eaters only forwent the blindfold for victims who were expected to lose possession of either their eyes or their lives. Although Draco didn’t think he was going to his death—Narcissa’s subsequent grief would surely prevent that—his continued access to vision didn’t bode well.
Finally, Draco lost his patience. "Are you going to say anything?" he demanded. "What happened back there? What she said wasn't right, but it wasn't something that should have caused the reaction it did. Tell me what's going on, Harry."
"I suppose you think I should make it up to you?" he drawled. He had reached his room by now, and he slipped his key into the lock so he could open his door.
He could weigh his options, but he already knew there was only one course of action he could take. Harry’s safety and wellbeing came before Draco’s emotions. Even now, in the face of Harry’s anger and upset, Draco couldn’t tell him about the Death Eaters. So instead, he buried his inner turmoil and fracturing confidence under a stony façade, and he did what he’d been born and raised to do: he attacked Harry’s weaknesses.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Let's just go," Harry whispered back. His voice was shaky and his eyes were damp. He tugged lightly on Draco's hand.
Draco snorted and pushed open his door. "Tomorrow, then? We can go to the cinema or something."
But, he realized now, his fear and hatred of the Mark had also kept him from moving on. He had imbued the Mark with artificial power, elevated it to a pedestal from which it dictated Draco’s actions. He had left London because he wanted to leave behind his life of crime and misdeeds. He wanted to create a better life for himself, a life wherein he was beholden to neither Lucius nor the Death Eaters.
Once Draco had put some distance between them and the warehouse, he pulled off the road so he could enter his dorm’s address into his phone’s GPS. Then he turned to Harry. The other boy still looked dazed. He stared blankly through the windshield while absently rubbing at his wrists where the rope had left red imprints. It was a look Draco recognized from their second date, when an insult about Harry’s sexuality had triggered some kind of panic attack.
“At least one of us should get enough sleep,” Draco replied, just as quietly. The words tasted bitter in his mouth. He tried for a smile, but he could tell that Harry wasn’t buying it anymore. Harry was more awake now, his eyes narrowed and calculating, trying to understand what Draco wasn’t telling him. Draco ignored all that and leaned in for one last kiss before hurrying away, but he couldn’t stop thinking about the way Harry’s gaze bore into his back as he closed the door behind himself.
Draco spared a moment to think about the question. "I'm not entirely sure," he admitted finally, clenching his fists as a defense against the warning bells ringing in his head telling him not to share this vulnerability with Harry. "I thought I might stay with Blaise or Pansy, but Pansy is going to France with her parents, and I'm fairly certain Blaise is sharing his flat with his flavor-of-the-month."
The tattoo was undoubtedly grim. It had to be; after all, the Death Eaters had chosen it to inspire fear in the hearts of all who saw it. But it was also a little nonsensical, Draco supposed. Why a snake, of all animals? And why combine the snake with a skull? If the skull represented Death, wouldn’t this image imply that Death was doing the eating rather than being eaten as the “Death Eater” epithet suggested?
“Welcome to another year at Hogwarts. This year we have a new fifth year joining us from Mageía Máthisi in Greece. Please give Adrianos a warm welcome.”
“I was raised by my father and house elves. My mother has nothing to do with me.”
Fred: Took Harry half an hour and a solution to calm her down.
Harry: How? Draco did even know that he could get pregnant.
Draco: You don’t need to go all healery on me.
Harry: I'm going to hex you two one of these days.
Hermione: That's lots of tablets Harry.
Cedric: How?
Sky: I know. He didn’t say anything in class but I think that that was because he thought that he would get a better grade than me but he didn’t so that’s why he had a go at me at break.
Ginny: What about you Fred?
Harry steps out of the floo and smiles at Minnie. He’s come for their weekly Saturday afternoon tea. They hug then sit down.
Ginny: When?
Fred: She was pretty quiet after their year's exam results came out.
Severus: What are you two whispering about?
George: And we thought that we were the biggest rule breakers that year.
Draco: A combination of occlumency and hidden rooms.
Harry: I have a boyfriend.
“We’re giving her the welcome she deserves.” Adri says.
Harry: Yep and my boyfriend's is Fangs.
Ginny: Who the fuck is Sky? And why the fuck is she calling you Daddy?
Luc, Sev, Harry and Darcy are walking to the stadium.
Harry: I am. But I also have to keep quite fit for reasons I would rather not disclose so I went vegetarian and I have cut down on the amount of wheat that I eat.
Harry: He might have added moonstone.
Cedric: Yes he is.
George: You really are fate’s favourite chew toy.
“A secret one.”
Harry: What’s happened?
Harry: Sky and Scorp say hi by the way.
Sky: I’m excited okay?
Fred, George: But that would be telling.
Harry: Yes.
Draco leans over and whispers in Adri’s ear “I certainly will later.”
Harry: You always ruin my fun.
Cedric: What?
Arthur: Where abouts is your tent going to be? Do you know?
Rita: How old are they?
Draco: I get it. I do it too. If you had told me you were coming I would have said that we could have taken the kids out for dinner.
“Lord Adrianos Slytherin.”
Greg: You're trans?
They kiss.
Harry: What was the kid’s name?
May: What can I say? I’m a Black. Insest is what we do.
Harry: When do I ever disappoint on that front?
Draco: Language.
Harry: Probably Grimald Place.
“Boo!” Another calls.
Fred: Is it about the twins?
Harry: Since when?
Dudley: Potter? What are you doing here?
Arthur: Hello Amos. Where's Cedric?
Harry: I go back to annoy them and because Dumbledore says I have to.
Fred: I'll sort her out. You enjoy your breakfast Harry.
Fred: Hidden away snogging his girlfriend probably.
Hermione, Ron and Ginny climb into a carriag, they didn't realise that there is already a girl sat in it.
Severus: He’s ten. Why wouldn’t he sleep through the night?
“Err no. You see I’m used to going to a school where they don’t squash your opinions and am also used to being able to trash any of the ministers that my uncle doesn't get along with.”
Harry: No. These two are ten which makes me single at the time.
Fred: Why a spoon?
Rita: Husband? Children? Only last week were you seen with Ginny Weasley.
Draco: Tell me once we get to Sky’s room.
The way she said “nobody” made Harry realise that the rumors were true. Harry’s phone goes off and Ginny picks it up.
Darcy: Darcy Lucia Malfoy-Snape.
Darcy: You remember how Madame Pomfry said the transformation would be really painful?
Harry and Draco are sat in the living room of their suite. Draco is sat in Harry’s lap and they’re both holding glasses of wine.
They all laugh.
Draco: Why not?
“That is a secret.”
Scorpius is severely autistic - along with other things - and finds school too overwhelming. He probably won’t go to Hogwarts and will be home schooled by Draco and Narcissa.
Ginny is texting someone and Harry is watching T.V.
Harry and Ron head down to breakfast. The boy who lived is wearing a green shirt tucked into a pair of black skinny jeans he's paired it with contact lenses and classic black and white vans. Ginny blushes hard and looks down at her scrambled eggs. Harry sits down next to Fred. Ron sits across from Harry.
Harry: *whispering* Thank you.
Arthur nods.
“That’s likely!” A Slytherin calls.
George: That's because I'm gay. I have a boyfriend.
Ron: What do you mean "
She runs off crying.
Harry: Yeah, now that you mention it, it is.
Harry: Well they're in for a shock then.
George: Grey eyes.
Harry: Well Darcy said that the transformation wasn't that painful so I wondered if you'd added something to the potion and the only single ingredient pain relief that wouldn't react with any of the other ingredients in the potion is moonstone.
Fred: Act straight...
Draco: Okay then do it. It’ll be nice to spend some time as a family.
Harry: I never saw your father as a crying in joy type of guy.
George: Don’t tell us.
George: Act dumb...
Harry: Yeah.
They start heading upstairs, Harry still hugging Scorp.
Harry: Touche. When were you going to tell me that you were cheating on me?
Hermione: Can't Madame Pomfry do anything?
Arthur: I know that this sounds preposterous but are you on blood replenishing potions?
May: You knew that there was a possibility. The gene is in the Black family. I’m living proof of that.
Fred: You'll see her when we get off the train.
“Yes I do.”
Harry: I’ll deal with it. I’ve got some good news.
Minnie: Before we sort the first years one of our fourth years has requested a re-sorting. Potter, Hadrian.
Cedric: Don't you live with muggles?
Hermione: Harry that's not safe.
Harry: Well the Minister is in for a shock when I turn up. And the wedding they were on about was probably the small, little, tiny wedding that Lucius and Draco's step father had last term.
Fred: I can't tell you that.
Minnie: Well then we have a new potions master.
He plucks his phone out of Ginny’s hands.
Ginny: Did he tell you that?
Harry: *whispering* You know what my boyfriend's like if I turn up looking like I've been dragged through a hedge backwards.
Sorting Hat: SLYTHERIN!!
Harry: I'll have some yoghurt please. I'm not that hungry.
Hermione: Since a while actually Harry.
Darcy: I'm sure your brothers will have told you about me.
would care about wix customs.
Fred: Asexual.
“I take it that you hold the title of Lord Slytherin.”
Harry: Hello Percy.
Harry: Well I’ve just broken up with my cheating girlfriend so I thought I’d come celebrate with my family.
Ginny: YOU HAVE CHILDREN WITH MALFOY?!!
Darcy: Submissive vampires never wear black. It's against the law to force a submissive vampire to wear black.
Cedric: I'm here.
May: Oh how fantastic.
Molly: Why is it dear?
Harry: What do you say, Draco?
Harry: You used to like beating up ten year olds although you did wait until you were sixteen and had a whopping four GCSEs. I only have fourteen GCSEs and I can’t think of why you did that.
Fred: She
He holds out his hand and plucks his fully packed trunk out of the air. He shrinks it and puts it in his pocket. He disaperates.
Harry: I can confirm that he is George.
Harry: I have degrees in classical arts and latin. I’m also fluent in fourteen different languages and have a full time job, saving lives. What are you doing for yourself these days?
" section. He tips the box upside down and the tablets fall into his hand. He swallows them one by one.
Ron: Who from? Did know you had a girlfriend.
George: As if
Harry: I've always known.
Ron: That's nothing on what Harry can do.
Molly: What do you want for breakfast Harry?
“We also have a guest from the Ministry of Magic. She will be conducting inspections on the school. You all need to be on your best behavior and give her the welcome she deserves.”
George: The last third years to get full marks were Remus Lupin and Lily Evans.
Molly: Go.
Harry: I'm not a breakfast person. Most mornings I go for a run then have a shower in the Quidditch changing rooms and grab a yoghurt on the way to class.
He took a deep breath and broke the eye contact, dipping his head forward until his forehead rested against Draco's. His fingers had stopped their motions against Draco's arm, drifting up to loosely encircle his wrist instead. Draco brought his right arm around Harry's shoulders, holding him close. He saw that Harry's eyes had drifted shut, and his own followed suit.
He started driving again. Silence swelled between them, interrupted only by the GPS’ periodic guidance—an unwanted passenger, clambering into Draco’s lap and demanding to be addressed.
For the first time, though, Draco found himself blatantly hoping that Potter would look past his posturing and call Draco on his bluff. The truth was, Potter intrigued Draco. There was something about him that drew Draco to him, leaving Draco wanting more than what little he had convinced himself he was allowed to have. Draco couldn't quite put his finger on it, even less so through the comfortable haze that was gradually settling over his mind, but whatever it was, Draco liked it.
Draco let himself get lost in the pleasure. A euphoric haze settled over his mind, and his thoughts grew so scattered as to be incoherent. His world boiled down to the sight and feeling of Harry's mouth traveling across his body.
Draco reached blindly for Potter, flailing aimlessly in the air until his hand collided with what felt like fabric. "Potter," he whispered with his eyes tightly shut, knowing he would lose his nerve if you opened, "you were wrong." He smirked at that. There was a certain vindictive pleasure in knowing he had managed to pull one over on Potter, who had been so adamant that he knew Draco better than even Draco did after only two encounters. "I
"Alright," Harry agreed instantly, seemingly oblivious. "Let me know when to meet you."
"I will when he stops acting like I'm only dating you to steal your virginity and prey on your innocence," Draco maintained with a haughty sniff.
"I had a brilliant idea," Draco proclaimed one evening, as Harry booted up his laptop and Draco pulled the popcorn from the microwave. "I think we should watch that drama you were in."
Draco’s future, Harry’s happiness, the future of their relationship—it all seemed to come down to how Draco responded to Harry’s plea. He could tell the truth, or a censored version of it anyway, and take a leap of faith. In doing so, he would be leaving himself vulnerable in a way he never had before.
Draco made a strangled noise. "It's a little early to move in together, don't you think?" he asked. He realized then that his hand was still on Harry's shoulder, and he snatched it away before Harry could notice how long it had been there.
Harry finally raised his head and met Draco's gaze when Draco insulted him, remorse shining in his eyes. His hands stilled; silence stretched between the two, fraught with the words that remained unspoken. "It's not that I don't trust you," Harry started. He trailed off, frustrated. "I want to tell you," he tried again, "but it's not something I feel comfortable talking about right now. Surely you understand?" He dropped the water bottle onto the bedcovers beside him and gestured to Draco's left arm. Draco gripped at his sleeve reflexively and tugged it down. His face burned as he realized he had only played into Harry's intent. "You have your own secrets," Harry continued. "Let me have mine."
Fred gets up and goes up to Ginny's room. He knocks on the door.
Fred: He's not showing off.
Ashley: There’s no way you have fourteen GCSEs.
Scorpius laughs.
Fred: Hermione Granger has officially been rendered silent.
Fred: I'll sort her out. You enjoy your breakfast Harry.
Fred and George sit down opposite Harry and May.
Lucius: *whispering* That's completely fine.
George: Tied first place was Draconian Malfoy and Hadrian Potter.
They all jump.
George: When did you find that out?
Percy: What’s so funny Malfoy?
George: What did they do?
Harry: Because you don’t like the Malfoys and I don’t want my kids to have to face that. They are perfectly happy living with Draco, Lucius and Narcissa. Why do you think that Lucius didn’t go to Azkaban? Because he protected my children - his grandchildren - from Voldermort and Kingsley knew that.
Ginny: Harry that's awful. How could you? You were supposed to be mine!
Harry: *whispering* Sounds like a plan.
Molly: This is Sirius and Remus all over again!
Arthur: So, Harry, tell me a bit more about this boyfriend of yours.
George: Get on with it.
Lucius: Yes he is even if he doesn’t want to.
Harry: Oh really? Well it’s a bit of a shame that I’m her father then isn’t it. I understand what’s going on. It’s a bit of like father like son.
Fred: He's ignoring you.
Darcy: I don't get why you have to go back there when there is no point.
Harry: Guys I'm not doing it.
Harry: But…
Harry: Because it will hurt more.
Harry: Force of habit.
Harry: Nobody fly off the handle but first of all I'm bi. Second of all I've had a boyfriend.
Harry: Hello Luc. How are you ?
Molly: This is no laughing matter. Go sit down at that table and think about what you have done.
George: What's the special occasion?
Fred: I can't tell you that.
Hermione: Then how come you didn't know what one was at the end of last year?
Fred: Yes yes whatever.
Lucius: And it’s about time too.
Hermione: Is that a hickie on your neck?
Harry: Darcy's Christmas present.
Harry: Not a clue. He said he would meet me at the portkey point.
She looks at Severus.
Harry laughs.
Harry: Yep.
George: I'm George.
Molly: And you.
Harry: Mrs Weasley almost squeezed the life out of me with her hug, Mr Weasley told me how proud he was and Charlie gave me a high five.
Harry: Yep.
Harry: Yeah.
Harry: Yes.
“This year is going to be great.”
Ginny: It’s Greengrass isn’t it? Their mum?
Amos: Who are your magical guardians Harry?
Cedric: Show off!
Fred: Gin it's Fred. Please can I come in. I want to talk to you.
Severus: Why don't  you sit down and find out?
The boy who lived wraps the vampire up in a hug.
Harry: I can confirm that he is George.
“Since my parents were murdered when I was one.”
Harry: Nobody fly off the handle but first of all I'm bi. Second of all I've had a boyfriend.
Harry: Ginevra was cheating on me then broke up with me because apparently having children with another person was a deal breaker for her. I don’t mind however. I’m perfectly happy with the current status quo.
Dudley: What?
“So what are you doing here? I’m sure whatever school you went to was better than this hell hole.”
Arthur and Molly come in, Molly holding food for the twins.
Narcissa: Harry!
Harry: Not for me. I found out that I have a gluten intolerance.
“Slytherin house be quiet.” Dumbledore says, fuming.
Rita: What surname do they have?
Darcy: You know who I was now. Don't you? Draco Lucius Malfoy. Well I'm now Darcy Lucia Malfoy-Snape.
Draco: Some arse hole kid at her school.
Greg: Congrats mate.
Narcissa: I didn't know to expect you.
Molly: You stupid child. If only you had told us. Now I’m behind on christmas sweaters. I have five more to make. This has thrown my whole schedule off plan.
Ginny groans.
Harry: Oh there is. At the school I went to, the subjects were slightly different to what you’re thinking of. I also did higher maths, psychology, classical arts and latin.
Harry: No and no. They have two dads.
Draco: What happened?
Harry: No you can’t because I’ll scoop your eyes out with a spoon if you do.
George: Fucking original that.
Minnie: I called this meeting to tell you all that I have - finally - found a potions master for next year.
May: At least he’s good looking.
Harry: You're not going to like it.
George: Her boyfriend is the boy who lived.
Ginny: MALFOY?!!!
Hermione: How do you know all of this anyway?
Fred: Great body.
They all laugh.
Ron: Five more minutes.
Charlie: Hence the separation tablets.
A boy in Slytherin robes with his hood up stalks from the floo straight on the train. No stops. The people he walks past find this weird. No family to say goodbye to and no friends to say hello to. A blond boy by the name of Draco Malfoy is almost overcome by the sheer power the mysterious boy carries. He sets a goal in his head that he will get into the boy’s bed one way or another by Christmas.
Fred: And she's a vampire.
Harry: Lots of problems. I've got two for IBS, one for depression, one vitamin supplement then Poppy gave me ones for separation and blood replenishing. I'm not on the blood replenishing ones at the moment.
George: You lot though we went to Lee Jordan's.
Charlie: Have you got a blood problem?
Molly: Be quiet, both of you, before I whack you over the head with a pan.
Draco: Merlin Father don’t do that.
Harry: Lots of problems. I've got two for IBS, one for depression, one vitamin supplement then Poppy gave me ones for separation and blood replenishing. I'm not on the blood replenishing ones at the moment.
Harry is stood in the corner under his spare invisibility cloak as they’re giving his original one to Sky for her birthday that is the next day.
He holds a hand out and a clear plastic tray with twenty-eight sections comes flying he opens the "
Ginny: Go away.
Harry softly presses their lips together. He swipes his tongue across Darcy's bottom lip. She opens her mouth and Harry's tongue slides in...
Scorp: So are you going to live with us Daddy?
Fred: Ginny, Harry and his boyfriend have been together since the second week of their first year at Hogwarts. Harry's known he was bi since he was ten.
Pansy: Who are you?
The Slytherins all make their agreement known.
Ginny: Nobody.
Ginny: Harry that's awful. How could you? You were supposed to be mine!
Harry: No but my boyfriend is a vampire.
Sky: Yeah bugger off.
He comes out from behind a tree walking on his hands. Only people that find it impressive are Amos, Arthur and Ginny.
Draco relegated himself to the couch after the ninth consecutive night of jerking awake in a cold sweat. He told Harry it was because he didn’t want to disturb Harry’s sleep in addition to his own, and this was true to an extent. More importantly, however, Draco didn’t want to give Harry a chance to figure out what he was dreaming about, whether by hearing Draco cry out in his sleep or by asking him questions when he was still too incoherent after waking up to think about what he was saying.
But he couldn’t focus on that right now. This distance, while painful, was a blessing in disguise, letting Draco devote the entirety of his focus to dealing with Yaxley without having to keep Harry at bay, too. If Draco played his cards properly, he could sort this all out and then reconcile with Harry on his own terms; he refused to do so on the Death Eaters’.
Draco was still for a moment, taken aback by Harry’s easy assumption that they would be spending next Christmas together. A pang of guilt shot through him. Harry had no reason to be aware of the complications Draco would soon be facing, nor would Draco let him find out. That conviction spurred him into action again, and he carefully unwrapped the package in his hands.
Harry nodded once in acknowledgement but otherwise did not respond. He dropped his gaze to the bags in his hands, absently hefting them as he mulled something over. Content to avoid the subject, Draco did nothing to break the ensuing silence.
“You like it, then?” Harry asked eagerly. The question was unnecessary, in Draco’s opinion. He had made it quite clear how he felt about the gift. Still, Harry looked expectant, and Draco found he didn’t mind assuaging Harry’s ill-founded insecurities.
Harry grew visibly more distressed the longer Draco stood without responding. Draco took a perverse, hysterical pleasure in watching Harry’s jaw tighten and his eyes narrow with each passing second. “Say something!” Harry demanded finally. “That’s it? You’re not even going to apologize? You’d rather hang onto your pride than make a meaningful effort to fix this?”
Potter complied with a chuckle and sat at the opposite end of the couch, mirroring Draco's position. Draco stared at him a little suspiciously, trying to guess whether Potter had done this on purpose, but then Potter passed over a bottle opener and Draco's focus shifted.
Draco paused, his hands balling into fists by his sides. “Are you breaking up with me, then?” he whispered, doing his best to keep his voice steady.
Harry smiled good-naturedly. "I'll be fine here," he reassured his friend. "You should go, though, or you won't make it to the airport in time."
A whimper sounded then, drawing Draco’s gaze to a figure he hadn’t noticed before. Off to the side, in the shadows between the small patches of sunlight painting the floor, was a man tied to a chair, with Montague, a Death Eater near Draco’s age, standing alert beside him.
Harry swatted at his chest with a laugh, calling him on his bluff. "We have Netflix and popcorn," he said instead, laughing again when Draco's face lit up with childish joy.
"Thanks," the brunette gasped as he dove under the table. Draco rearranged his legs to hide the other man in their shadow before returning to the heavy tome before him.
"If Weasley's family is even half as annoying as he is, I think I'll pass," he drawled, hoping his voice didn't sound as shaky as he thought it did.
Despite himself, Draco smiled slightly. “Blunt as ever,” he remarked.
Draco remained frozen and wide-eyed, unable to respond. Then Potter's lips covered his own, and he finally found himself able to move. He pressed into that delicious friction, giving back just as good as he got. He registered Harry pushing him into the door and welcomed the support when, just seconds after latching onto Draco's, Potter's lips ghosted up his jaw to his ear. "Definitely not cold as ice," Potter whispered. Draco shivered involuntarily.
Draco froze. He kept his eyes trained on his duffel. He had hoped he would be able to make it to the start of term before being confronted by Harry, but it seemed he had hoped for too much. “Alright.”
"Alright," he said. "One date, Potter. We'll see how it goes from there." Potter turned back towards him uncertainly, and Draco turned his gaze away again, tracing the wood grain of the desk with his eyes. "I'm not ready to come out to the world as a whole, though," he admitted quietly, wondering if Potter would be content to keep their relationship secret. He hadn't thought about the fact that after putting himself completely on the line, this one detail could turn it all on its head.
“Draco, open your eyes,” Harry coaxed. Draco realized with a start that his eyes had been clenched tightly shut ever since he’d woken up. He pried them apart with some effort, blinking rapidly to bring the dark interior of the room into focus. Once his vision stopped swimming, he saw that Harry was holding a glass of water towards him. He took it gratefully.
"I'll be fine," he drawled, dismissing Harry's concerns. "Besides, loathe as I am to agree with Weasley, you'll only be a phone call away. If I ever do feel inclined to burst into tears, even though that's your area of expertise rather than mine, I'll simply call you."
Draco's lip curled. "I'm not too keen on reminding them of my existence right now," he said shortly.
"This is certainly not how I imagined our date ending," Draco remarked after a moment, when it became clear Harry was not going to say anything. He hoped the dryness of his voice masked the confusion and worry he was feeling.
“Afraid of being gay? It’s true that I don’t want all and sundry to know my sexual orientation, but I’m not the person who becomes catatonic from being called a fag!” he retorted. Harry recoiled in shock, but Draco did his best to ignore him. “You want to talk about trust? You’re expecting an awful lot of it from me without giving me any in return. Don’t be a hypocrite.”
Harry ignored his words and trained a steely gaze on Draco. The fire burning in his eyes simultaneously made Draco want to look away and held him captive. The feeling of having Harry’s entire attention focused on Draco was addicting, in spite of the dread currently pooling in Draco’s chest.
Lucius turned back to Draco with narrowed eyes, and despite himself, Draco swallowed in fear. Lucius had dropped all pretenses of cordiality, and with them, all chances of mercy. “You were already a disappointment for abandoning your duties and shirking your mantle, but you never do things by half, do you? As if your insolence wasn’t flagrant enough, you had to run off to cavort with some common boy as well.”
“I have to try.”
In an odd way, he relished the nausea tying his stomach into knots. It was fitting. Harry had been right yesterday; Draco had hurt Harry even in the act of trying to protect him. Didn’t Draco deserve to be punished in return? Didn’t Draco deserve to feel at least a fraction of the pain he had inflicted on Harry? And not just on Harry, but on the people Lucius had hurt, the people whose lives the Death Eaters had ruined, while Draco stood by and laughed and looked the other way.
As the last of the gift wrap fell away, Draco found himself holding an unbelievably soft, emerald green scarf in his hands. The material was obviously high-end, and the color was one that brought out Draco’s eyes. A subtle shimmer was woven into the scarf, lending it a certain allure that Draco couldn’t quite explain.
Well, Draco wasn't one to pass over an opportunity to have someone in his debt. He sighed. "Get under the table," he said, resigned.
Harry stilled for a moment, prompting Draco to release a low whimper at the loss, but he snapped out of his daze as quickly as he had entered it. "Circumstances prevented it," he said simply, before causing Draco to lose his train of thought by pushing up Draco's shirt and mouthing at Draco's sensitive stomach until the blond was trembling.
Though he got one just a few moments later, Draco lingered in his room, hesitating. If he met up with Potter now, he could no longer continue pretending his relationship with Potter was little more than a series of ill-advised coincidental encounters, fated to collapse onto itself as quickly as it had begun. It was not an enticing outcome, and to Draco's chagrin, he found himself seriously considering hiding in his room until this situation went away.
Draco scoffed at himself. Hadn't he decided not to let his worries of the past dictate his future? Now that the shock had worn off, Draco had no excuse to refuse. He had nowhere else to go, as Harry had so aptly pointed out, and Harry had made it clear that he didn't mind the imposition.
This left his Mark completely out in the open, and Draco froze, anticipating judgment, or ridicule, or simply even recognition.
“So that’s my secret,” he continued, his voice suddenly dripping with scorn. Draco couldn’t suppress his flinch. He looked away, unable to meet Harry’s eyes. “I have PTSD. Reminders of that night trigger me, mire me in flashbacks so intense it’s like I’m reliving every blow, which is why it’s so difficult to talk about. So what the fuck is your excuse? Do I finally deserve to know what the
He felt the bed dip as Harry stood up, and he had to suppress a cry when he heard Harry leave the room. Though the details of his nightmare were already fading from his memory, he could still vividly remember the utter contempt on Harry’s face as he had walked away from Draco in the dream. For a split second, Draco despaired that the real Harry had had enough as well and was finally leaving.
Draco opened his eyes and met Potter's gaze. "Why are you here?" he asked. It was a simple question, an easy one that would hopefully lead to the discussion they really needed to have.
Once inside, they grew subdued in favor of consuming their meals, though occasionally, Draco would catch Harry's eyes and mime a particularly amusing moment from the film, or vice versa, and they would devolve into another spate of muffled giggles.
Draco's alarm woke him the next morning. He clawed himself into an upright position, feeling groggier than he normally did, and rubbed his eyes blearily. As he did, his shirt sleeve rubbed against his cheek, and he stared at it in confusion, wondering why he hadn't changed before sleeping.
Far from being placated, Harry scoffed in disbelief. “You’re not exactly giving me much reason to trust you right now,” he pointed out. “You’re refusing to tell me anything. The way you’ve been acting over the last couple weeks is enough to tell me that things won’t be okay, not anytime soon.” He fell silent for a moment, before continuing with a short laugh, “I guess I should have seen this coming. If you don’t want to be with me anymore, you can tell me.”
Potter flicked a glance at Draco, but his gaze skittered away immediately afterward. "Did some child acting when I was young, just adverts and the like. There were a few that grew quite popular, and for some reason people seem to remember them, unfortunately for me." He held Draco's gaze at that, pure confusion etched upon his face. Draco resisted the urge to laugh at how incongruous the emotion seemed with Potter's headstrong personality.
He almost walked past Harry’s flat, lost in thought as he was, and had to do a quick about face to turn down the right path. He texted Harry as he went, letting him know Draco was outside, and knocked sharply on the door when he reached it.
Guess who's back!! Christ, it's been a truly disgusting number of years since I last updated. The good news is that I finally, officially, genuinely, actually managed to finish writing the rest of this fic. It's been something of a personal goal of mine, actually; I swore to myself that even if it took a decade, I would finish writing and publishing this fic. I owe it to the idealistic 14-year-old writer who started writing ACOMI with nothing more than an AU premise and a vague idea of a climactic scene.
Shaking the disquiet from his mind, Draco trudged through the snow until he reached a small copse of trees at the far end of the grassy field that made up most of the park. Bare though they were, the trees were deceptively secluded, serving Draco's purpose perfectly. Despite the lack of potential onlookers in the park, Draco wanted every ounce of privacy he could get.
Draco raised a brow. "Oh yes, what a shame, to have hordes of girls chasing after you," he droned sarcastically. "Just an absolute nightmare."
“Please, not tonight.” He kept his eyes locked on the screen, unwilling to see the unhappiness writ large upon Harry’s face. Even Draco could tell he sounded weary; he hoped Harry would take pity and cede to Draco just this once. “This is nice. Let’s have this, tonight.”
It was only when Lucius glanced aside, his lips curling in contempt, that Draco realized he had made a mistake.
Potter's lips tightened. "That's not something I'm willing to share," he said quietly, shocking Draco with the change in his attitude.
Draco would have been ashamed to admit that the diversionary tactic worked, forcing him to close the laptop after watching only three episodes, had his body not been singing with pleasure. He turned his attention to Harry instead, returning his ministrations in kind.
Instead of answering Yaxley’s question, Draco asked one of his own: “Are you alone this time as well, or has my father finally dismounted from his high horse and come to see me in person?”
like you. Just don't know if I should." His hand fell back to the bed and Draco smiled softly, letting sleep claim him at last.
Harry opened his mouth—perhaps to level more accusations at Draco, perhaps to demand answers Draco refused to give. Draco didn’t give him the chance. “There’s nothing either of us can say that hasn’t already been said. We both saw this coming, there’s no use in denying it. So let’s leave it here. Let’s aim for some semblance of an amicable parting. We’ll be thankful for it in the long run.” He paused, considering whether he wanted to say anything else, but his mind was full of static and his mouth was unbearably dry. Idly, he berated himself for lacking the foresight to prepare his parting remarks ahead of time. He had had weeks to rehearse a response for when Harry finally grew tired of Draco avoiding the issue. But he couldn’t change that now. With a final decisive nod, he turned on his heel and began to walk away.
Harry chuckled. “Waiting for the post-Christmas sales?” he joked. “Wish I’d thought to do that.” The statement coaxed a quiet laugh from Draco. He took a moment to silently appreciate the fact that Harry was giving him an out.
"Trust me," Draco said firmly. "You don't want to date me. You want to leave before you end up hurting yourself unnecessarily."
Lucius cocked his head in a mockery of curiosity. “Tell me,” he said before Draco could respond to his previous sally, “what is it about this boy that drives you to turn your back on everything you hold dear? What falsehoods did he feed you to make you think you owed him anything?”
If Draco had to guess, he would say Lucius would come to fetch Draco himself, especially once he learned about how Draco had challenged him when speaking to Yaxley. And if Lucius came to get Draco, there was no doubt he would try to use Harry as leverage to convince Draco to return to London. That thought scared Draco more than anything; he couldn't let Harry get caught in the crossfire of Draco's mistakes.
They went ice skating once, a few days after buying the tree. Draco immediately took to the ice, but Harry couldn't seem to skate more than a meter without falling spectacularly. Draco teased him mercilessly about it as they made their way back to the flat, cheeks red and fingers shoved deep into their coat pockets. Harry retaliated by sticking a handful of snow down the back of Harry's shirt, leading Draco to declare war. By the time the two stumbled through Harry's door, they were cold and wet, snow clinging to their clothes like a second skin. Neither boy could stop laughing.
Draco knew it was an absurd thought the moment he had it. Harry was completely unaware of how deeply Draco’s world had been shaken just days before, nor did his behavior suggest he had grown tired of Draco. But the fear lingered in the forefront of Draco’s mind until the moment Harry returned to the room and sat back down on the bed.
He almost didn’t recognize himself through that lens. Divorced from the memories and guilt that weighed upon him, Draco saw only a young, scared, utterly exhausted boy. He saw pronounced bags beneath his eyes, too deep to attribute to late nights spent studying for a stressful exam. He even saw, for a brief moment, the shadow of the Ice Prince who had served as second-in-command of the Death Eaters, carved into the sharp angles of his jaw and cheekbones, swimming in his gunmetal irises as he continued to hold his own gaze.
Draco paused. Distantly, he realized a few students crossing the quad had noticeably slowed to watch the fight unfold. He considered walking back to Harry, or imploring Harry to lower his voice. But resignation was quickly beginning to weigh down his limbs, and he couldn’t find the energy to turn around, much less willingly re-enter the fight Harry was trying to pick. Instead, he closed his eyes and clenched his hands into fists and waited for Harry to finish.
Wasn’t this exactly what he had been trying to prevent? Wasn’t this what he had been so worried about? All that time he had spent safeguarding Harry from his faults, shielding Harry from the inevitable crossfire, had been to keep the mistakes of his past from destroying the happiness he’d achieved in his present. And yet, what he had feared was exactly what had come to pass.
"I knew this was an awful idea," Draco lamented to Harry in a mournful whisper. Harry's expression fell immediately, but Draco ignored it and powered on. "I actually liked their ice cream and now I can never go back to that shop."
And he would fix this somehow. Despite his best intentions, he had fallen hard for Harry, and he couldn't bear the thought of losing him so soon after experiencing what true freedom was like.
Draco was nearly asleep when Potter pressed a kiss to his forehead. "I'll see you around, I suppose," Potter whispered, presumably thinking Draco wasn't awake to hear him, and suddenly Draco couldn't bear the thought of letting the man leave without knowing how Draco truly felt. His previous misgivings melted away in the face of losing the first person who had inspired true happiness within Draco.
The contentment lasted right up until the moment he woke up gasping for breath, phantom blood painting his hands and Harry’s concerned voice breaching his racing mind.
"That's another thing," Draco said. He drained his bottle in one long pull and gestured for Potter to pass over both another bottle and the opener. "Are you mentally deficient? I told you, it won't do you any good to moon over me." He tried to ignore the regret that shot through his heart like a lance at the words.
Objectively, Draco recognized Harry’s words for the taunt they were. He knew he shouldn’t rise to the bait. But after Yaxley, after weeks of anticipating a death warrant with his name stamped on it, after two decades of doing exactly what he was told—he was sick of being ordered around. He was sick of being told what to feel and how to behave and everything he owed the world. He whirled around and pinned Harry with a glare, no longer caring who heard him.
“Funny how things work out,” Harry said some minutes later. Draco laughed quietly, a little desperately, and left it at that.
"Point taken," he said quietly. He hoped Harry would hear the apology hidden beneath the words. "You're right. I'll let you tell me when you're ready."
Shakily, but no less determined for it, Draco said, “I rather hope they’ll see who I’ve become instead.”
Immediately, unease set in. Draco didn't know how to respond. Just the thought of coming out to people he didn't even know, much less know well enough to anticipate the reactions of, left him in a cold sweat. But evidently these people meant a lot to Harry, if Harry was so eager to introduce Draco to them just a day after they'd begun dating. Draco had made it clear this morning that he had no intention of broadcasting his sexuality to anyone quite yet; surely Harry wouldn't ask this of him if he had any misgivings about his friends?
He was shaking now, his hands trembling against his thighs and his vision narrowing until all he could see was Harry. He didn’t know what he wanted to say. All he knew was that Harry had no right to decide what Draco owed him. How dare Harry accuse Draco of not caring when he didn’t hold the cards Draco did? “Not everything is about you! You’re not some blameless victim. In all the time we were together, you never even
Draco hummed, gathering his thoughts. He couldn't remember the last time anyone had asked him that question due to an actual desire to get to know him. It raised other questions Draco hadn't thought he would need to consider, since he'd assumed he wouldn't see the man again after this chance encounter: What could he afford to share? How much was he comfortable revealing to the other man? "Eighteen, studying law," he said. "I like green apples, I hate sweets, and I'm highly independent."
Draco scoffed and pushed himself off the couch, preparing to return to the bedroom. “I’m not asking for something unreasonable, either,” he said. “Just some time, and some trust. You can give me that much.”
But maybe he still had a chance. Harry had criticized him for not knowing how to lean on others for help, and he had been right. If Draco apologized to Harry now and told him the truth, would Harry see that he had changed? That he was trying to be better? And even if Harry turned Draco away, what did Draco have to lose? They had already broken up. Harry had nothing more to hold over Draco’s head.
“Harry,” Draco cried out before he could stop himself. His mind had gone blank at the sight of his boyfriend—well, his ex-boyfriend now—trussed up like any other Death Eater target. He wanted to rush forward and make sure the other man was alright, to cut him loose and reassure him that everything would be okay. But before he could take a single step, Lucius cleared his throat, and in a rush, Draco remembered that a single false move could spell the end for both of them.
No, he amended immediately, not for nothing. The Mark was a remnant of the worst possible version of himself, a person he had the capacity to be no matter how badly he didn’t want to. The Mark kept him from forgetting what he had left behind.
Harry left for the Weasleys' the next morning, despite his numerous protests that he couldn't leave Draco after a night as emotionally charged as they had just shared. Draco simply manhandled him towards the door in response and thrust his duffel into his chest.
A minute later, Harry spoke again. "Come stay at mine, then," he said, determination etched on his features. "If you really don't have anywhere to go."
“Who, my father?” Draco drawled, keeping his tone purposefully nonchalant, but Yaxley was grinning again before Draco had even finished.
Uncertainty warred with gratitude in Draco's mind. They had only been dating for a few months, and though Draco felt more and more secure in their relationship with each day, he still wasn't comfortable laying himself bare in front of Harry. What if Harry suddenly decided he wanted nothing more to do with Draco?
Harry was quiet while Draco drank, but he seemed to have something on his mind. He wouldn’t meet Draco’s eyes. Instead his gaze seemed fixed on Draco’s left arm. Out of habit, Draco made sure the tattoo was still covered, coloring slightly in embarrassment moments later when he realized Harry had already seen it.
"Eighteen, also studying law," Harry responded, surprise and pleasure coloring his tone. "I like reading but only if it isn't required for class, and I enjoy a game of rugby from time to time."
arms. To his dismay, Draco finally remembered he’d fallen asleep wearing Harry’s t-shirt, which had sleeves capped just inches below the shoulders. His Mark was now on full display.
On some level, Draco knew it was unfair to keep Harry in the dark about this, especially if he might be at risk because of it. But warning Harry about this meant telling Harry about his past, and the thought made Draco sick to his stomach. He couldn't imagine Harry would want anything to do with him after finding out about the crimes Draco had committed. His nightmares had made it abundantly clear that Draco had done too much harm to deserve the kind of love and support he was receiving from Harry now, even if he was past all that now.
But no one had reacted negatively. No matter how many times Draco combed through the memory to process it, he couldn’t deny that. And not only that, but he had actually been paid a compliment. A compliment! Had he really spent so long fearing his Mark for nothing?
"Far be it from me to divine a Malfoy's intentions," Yaxley said primly, his sudden subservience a mocking contrast to his previous brazenness. His lip curled then as he made his scorn for Draco known, and Draco's anger returned tenfold. "Feel lucky that you are being offered another chance to begin with, instead of asking such insolent questions. Mistress Narcissa fought hard to grant you pardon, though Master Lucius asserted, rightly so, that you did not deserve it. Do not let her efforts go to waste."
The moment he and Harry were alone, Draco crossed over to Harry and pulled him into a deep kiss. "What do you say we celebrate Weasley's departure by defiling his bed?" he whispered conspiratorially.
Except he wasn’t under any covers. He was still curled up on the floor, his arm numb from being used as a pillow the night before. He pawed about until he found his phone and opened one bleary eye as he clicked the home button. The screen remained dark save for a flashing image of an empty battery, drawing a groan from Draco.
A chill ran down Draco’s spine. So Yaxley had had access to Harry’s phone—and presumably Harry himself—since at least this morning. He couldn’t have taken Harry any earlier than the night before, though; Harry had made no mention of Yaxley during their breakup. However long Harry had been in Yaxley’s clutches, he was probably still nearby, close enough to be used as leverage.
“I’ll stop by once I’m done with classes,” he responded. His thumb hovered uncertainly over the “send” button, but with a final exhale, he pushed his fears aside and pressed the button. Then he pocketed his phone, slung his bag over his shoulder, and left for his next class, trying not to care who saw his Mark along the way.
The memory washed over him in a rush, a reminder of exactly why he was wrong.
"I'm sorry, what?" Draco asked, sure he'd misheard Potter somehow. "You mean, on a date."
"A reminder," Draco answered quietly. "Of a mistake I made, once. A mistake that ended in a lot of pain for a lot of people." He left it at that, fear coursing through his veins at the thought of revealing more than he already had. Some part of his brain still expected Harry to recognize the tattoo and bolt, irrational as the conviction was, and Draco was surprised he hadn't already done so. It wasn't exactly an obscure symbol; if Harry really wanted to know the story behind it, he could easily Google the image.
Harry rolled his eyes at Draco's response to being teased but answered nonetheless. "The Weasleys are having me over for Christmas dinner; I might stay a few days to help out and hang out with Ron." His expression brightened then. "Why don't you come with me? Ron says his mum always cooks enough for a small army; I'm sure she wouldn't mind one more mouth to feed."
Harry hesitated, but eventually he settled back against the couch. “Alright,” he conceded. “We can have this. We can have tonight.”
Harry tsked dismissively. “We can go out together. This way you know you’re getting me something I’ll like, and I’ll be able to guilt you into spending an exorbitant amount of money to make up for it.” His eyes brightened then. “Did you open your gift?”
“You were never nothing to me,” he said. “You just can’t handle not being everything.”
"No, you tosser, I'm gay myself," Draco began heatedly, the confession pulled from him, but then he noticed something he hadn't seen before. "That's an odd-looking scar," he said curiously, his irritation draining away. He gestured to the lightning bolt shaped mark marring Potter's forehead. Potter gave a nearly imperceptible flinch, but Draco caught it anyway. "How did you get it?"
He was startled out of his thoughts when a firm hand gripped his shoulder and pulled him to a standstill. For a brief moment, he worried that something had gone wrong with Harry's train, forcing him to return. He panicked, though it didn't show on his expression - Harry could not be allowed to realize Draco had forgotten to get him a present.
Arthur: Do I detect some sarcasm?
Harry: As her boyfriend I can very definitely confirm that she is a girl.
Arthur: What about your presentation?
Draco: Hello to you, too Sky.
Ginny: When were you going to tell me this?!
