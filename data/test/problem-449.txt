“Good luck with that.” Harry could hear the smile in Draco’s voice, even with his eyes closed. There was a pause, and then, “Stay the night?”
“Gabrielle.” Gabrielle’s head was high and her eyes were dry when she approached him. He took her hands. “I stand by what I said last night. You’re amazing, and someone out there will be so lucky to have you. I’m sorry that it can’t be me.”
“It was at first,” Harry answered defensively, but then he snorted. “But I also don’t think I was out for long enough for it to hurt like that when I went before.”
Sadiyah’s eyebrows rose. “You… oh my god. Harry. I know you’re not great with emotions—” Harry found himself really wishing that the contestants
Draco reflected on his conversation earlier that night with Blaise on why, exactly, he and Harry were incompatible. “That,” he said, “is deeply ironic.”
I have no children. I rarely interact with children. I am honestly not at all sure that I can write children. But I love Teddy anyway, so hopefully you will, too!
Harry and Draco’s conversation had been going in circles for what felt like ages, but Draco’s disbelief seemed to be growing, not diminishing, the longer it went on.
“I didn’t buy it then, I went back for it later.” He looked back to Harry. “Teddy wanted to show me your tree in the toy store on Diagon; we noticed this on the way out. It reminded him—”
Harry felt warm and happy, surrounded by some of his favorite people in the world, just relaxing and enjoying each other’s company. They’d all come so far, he thought, as he watched Pansy and Hermione bicker good naturedly about the rules of some obscure darts game he hadn’t heard of while Ron and Blaise appeared deep in conversation about what must have been something to do with mixology, judging by the way Blaise was gesturing at his glass and Ron was eyeing it thoughtfully.
Draco smirked at Harry, who rolled his eyes at him, before telling Teddy, “As much as I’d love to save you from Harry’s terrible skating, sadly, I’ll only be here for another week. If you can talk your gran into bringing you to see me in New York sometime, though, I could take you skating there—there are several places around the city where we could go.”
“Nice to meet you, Dermot.” Harry smiled back reflexively. Something about Dermot made him feel immediately at ease, and he found himself thinking that maybe this hadn’t been such a horrible idea, after all. “I look forward to getting to know you. I’ll see you inside, yeah?”
Eventually, they were stretched out naked on the bed, and Harry was above Draco again, kissing him. He found himself cataloguing the feel of every place their bodies met: his rough leg hair catching against Draco’s finer fuzz, the soft skin of stomachs skimming together, his now fully hard cock sliding alongside Draco’s, making them both shudder. Finally touching like this was heaven, and also almost hilariously surreal. To go so quickly from desperately in denial to desperately turned on was bizarre and wonderful.
They worked quietly for a while, listening to the gentle strains of the classical Christmas music that Narcissa had set to play on the wireless. Draco carefully calligraphed each piece of parchment, settling into a rhythm and enjoying watching each precise curl and swoop of script take shape. He hadn’t been looking forward to his task at all, but he had forgotten how satisfying he found formal writing. The more casual scrawl of his regular correspondence just wasn’t the same.
Harry thought about this. “Well, I know Romilda, Cormac, and Perry are all pretty into Quidditch. And Sullivan is athletic, so he probably will be as well. They’ll probably be interesting to watch.”
Harry groaned. “I can’t believe I’m saying this, but I almost wish you’d read it in the papers… but alright, may as well do the highlights.” He proceeded to give Draco a quick rundown of his truly terrible childhood, sounding almost bored even as he described the cartoonishly terrible behavior of his aunt and uncle. When he’d finished, Draco just stared for a moment before blinking a few times.
The final hill went smoothly for the first few seconds, but as they accelerated, it all began to go wrong. Between one moment and the next, Harry’s woolen hat was whipped violently from his head by the whistling wind, flying off somewhere into the distance. His hand flew up to catch it, but too late. Immediately, his now-loose curls slapped Draco across the face, tangling in his eyelashes and brows and obscuring his vision.
“Yup! Quidditch talk. For like twenty minutes straight. Apparently, we both had a lot to say about how Puddlemere is performing this year.”
When everyone had assembled, Harry standing on a grand staircase while the contestants spread in a semi-circle of formalwear below him, Blaise kicked things off.
Draco’s face relaxed, and he moved toward the door, squeezing Harry’s shoulder as he passed. “You’re doing fine, Harry. Get some rest; you’ll be a shit ref if you can’t focus because you’re overtired. Well,” he paused and smirked, “you’ll be a shit ref anyway, but you should at least try to sway the odds in your favor where you can.”
Thankfully, Hermione had not been wrong, and they had reached the end of the trail barely ten minutes later, Reginald loping along beside them. The view had, indeed, been spectacular—they had ended up at the edge of a towering cliff, huge tracts of untouched forest spread out far below them, more mountains rising on the other side of the gorge. A wide river cut through the middle, the sun reflecting blindingly up at them. Once they’d looked their fill, the group made the unanimous decision to Apparate back to the house. They had done quite enough hiking for one day.
“Romilda, I’m sorry, but it’s time for you to leave the Bachelor house,” Blaise announced, and, at his nod, Owen and Leela managed to get her to her feet and out the door, wailing all the way.
“You didn’t need to say. As I said, your aura is tinged with pink; it’s clear that you’re falling in love. And it couldn’t be anyone other than Harry, could it?”
. But Sullivan made him feel small in an entirely enjoyable way, like this was someone who would take care of him.
Ron struggled to sit up and patted her knee. “Nah, babe. I’ll keep going with you. Just give me like… ten more minutes.” Hermione smiled gratefully at him.
“Have you seen you?” Harry asked, raising an eyebrow. “You’re successful, you’re smart, and you’re gorgeous.” He coughed. “From an objective standpoint, I mean. I don’t believe for a second that you don’t get approached all the time.”
“Okay,” he’d agreed softly, squeezing her hand back, eyes burning as he looked down at his feet. “Okay, I’ll do it.”
“Right. Sure, of course.” He faltered, trying to find something else to say. “So, you still won’t tell me about your job?”
When Ron resurfaced, he was gasping and shivering. He glared at Ginny, who was laughing uncontrollably, and promptly grabbed her around the shoulders, pushing her completely under. She was still laughing when she popped back up, despite the cold water streaming from her hair. “That was perfect,” she said, sighing happily.
Draco pulled him back in. “Don’t be ridiculous. You’re Harry Potter. Someone else will hire you for the publicity alone.” His tone was lightly teasing, and Harry snorted.
Max glared as he yanked his jeans up, buttoning them angrily, which was actually moderately impressive. Who knew you could
“Oh, it’s ‘Zabini’ now, is it?” He smirked. “We went out a few times, if you must know. It didn’t go anywhere, but we stay in touch.”
Now, Draco sat in a chair by the fireplace, brushing his fingertips over the carvings of Harry’s picture frame and watching the miniature leaves shudder and shift under his touch. The flickering light of the crackling fire emphasized the delicate designs. He watched himself and his family in the photo, laughing as they hung decorations on the tree. He watched his mother smile at him and press a kiss to his cheek while Teddy turned and grinned at the camera, waving. In the background, Andromeda surreptitiously rearranged some of the more haphazardly hung baubles that were in danger of falling from their branches.
The theme park turned out to be a much more convenient date than Harry would have expected. This was largely because there were massive lines for all the best rides, so they had a lot of time to chat. Harry found himself making regular use of a wandless Muffliato so that they could talk without fear of slipping up and breaking the Statute, though; they’d received the same warning as he and Perry had, but with Leela, Harry was less inclined to follow it. He hadn’t learned nearly as much about her, and he didn’t want to let the opportunity slide.
Harry smiled down at him fondly as Draco reached up to run his fingers down Harry’s hand. He felt his heart stutter at the touch and was sure his face must have done something extremely embarrassing for a second before he got it back under control. He hoped desperately that no one had noticed. “Obviously. I don’t have a death wish.”
“He said he was incompetent, that he didn’t deserve his job and was too stupid to be more than a clerk, and all this...” Harry gestured vaguely and trailed off before finally meeting Draco’s sympathetic gaze. “So I punched him. Didn’t even think about it. Just—” He shrugged. “And then it all went to hell.”
After making their way through the most recent section of the museum—which included large photographs of scantily clad wix posing provocatively with carefully placed bottles and which made Harry blush and Draco’s eyebrows raise almost to his hairline in amusement—they finally reached the tasting portion of the tour.
together. Once the buzz of new relationship energy had run its course, there just wasn’t anything left to work with. And he had honestly tried. It wasn’t as though he didn’t want a relationship; he very much did. But he was only 26—he wasn’t ready to resign himself to one that was just
Harry sighed. A confirmation of some sort would have been too much to ask for, he supposed. “Look. Pansy. I get that you mean well, but Draco’s friendship is important to me. I’m not going to risk that by making some sort of confession. Okay?”
Harry made a sound Draco couldn’t quite decipher, but his fingers clenched against his back, and Draco could feel the smile that spread over his face where it was pressed against him. “I still hate you,” he reiterated, words muffled, “But I can’t give you up, either. Arsehole.”
“I will.” He turned, and though his expression didn’t change, Draco could see something shift behind his eyes. “Draco, what time’s your Portkey tomorrow? I’ll come see you off. If you want, I mean.”
“I think you’d probably be a lot better at this than I would,” Harry observed without thinking. Sadiyah raised an eyebrow at him and he blushed, realizing what he’d said. “Not that I’ve pictured… I mean, obviously, you’re beautiful, but… fuck.” He grimaced. “I’m just making this worse, aren’t I? Feel free to stop me at any time.”
“I wonder what happened to the dragon once you freed him?” Luna chimed in. She was perched next to Blaise in a flowy sundress; her long hair had been tied back in a braid after it had flown across his face one too many times.
The match dragged on, with the blue team scoring goal after goal over William’s unimpressed head while Cormac continued to knock almost every shot by the red team out of the air. Everyone was beginning to look exhausted, and quite a few players were splattered with dirt or sporting grazes on their exposed arms or legs. The score had reached a depressing 250 to 20 when, from the side where they’d been hovering the entire game, Jack reached out and casually closed their hand around the golden snitch, bringing things to an at least somewhat less embarrassing closing score of 250 to 170.
He excused himself, telling her he needed some air, which she took in stride, moving off to find another dance partner. Before he could get far, however, Gabrielle had taken his hand, pulling him closer and looping her delicate hands behind his neck. He smiled, deciding he could hang on for another song. The beat was slow and sultry, and soon, Gabrielle moved closer, beginning to move sinuously against him. It should have been hot. It should have been tempting. But all it felt was wrong.
“S’mores!” She looked around the circle, but was met by a collection of blank faces. “Really? None of you? Not even you, Harry?”
“He seems good,” Harry whispered to Draco, who had wrapped his arms around him and was resting his chin on his shoulder. Watching the finale the week before had been an emotional experience; it was a relief to see Perry as he was now rather than in the state he’d last been shown on screen.
His serenity came to an abrupt halt as he reached Potter’s name on the list and once again encountered that vexing ‘and guest.’ Trying to sound casual, Draco asked “Has Harry mentioned who he’ll be bringing as his plus one?”
“You know, Harry,” Hermione said hesitantly, “taking the spot on the Arrows isn’t exactly going to let you fly under the radar here, either.” Ron snorted at the pun, and she rolled her eyes.
His second debrief with Pansy and Draco was much shorter than the last. After a few distracted apologies, Pansy hurried off to alert her editor of the infiltration and do damage control before any of the day’s events were made public. Draco, however, once again stayed a few minutes longer.
Harry looked down at himself. He was wearing what he thought was a perfectly serviceable pair of basketball shorts and a plain tee shirt. “I’m not?”
under his breath. Harry looked a bit pink, but still smirked right back up at Draco, so it was probably just the heat. “Played that one close to the chest, didn’t you? But don’t worry, I’ve got something in the pipeline. I’ll be back on top before you know it.”
“Something that the great Harry Potter isn’t good at?” Draco had smirked at him, and Harry had shoved him in the shoulder and told him to go fuck himself, laughing. “But I’d so much rather you did,” he’d murmured when Harry had drawn near again, and Harry had given him a look that said Draco would be paying for that later. Draco looked forward to it.
. It would end, and then it would be awkward, and when I visited again everything would be different and uncomfortable and I don’t want that. I want to be able to have this, sometimes. To come back to. Does that make sense?”
Soon, Luna called Harry back up to the platform for the next session. By the end of the third and final one, his whole body was stiff and sore. He groaned as he climbed down. “How do people do that regularly?” he asked Luna, rotating his head to try to work a kink out of his neck.
“Play nice, boys,” Parkinson drawled before moving past them and directly up to Ginny. “Nice choice,” she purred, her eyes trailing over her body, lingering rather longer than could be considered strictly polite on her décolletage. “Didn’t fancy the sweet, innocent look, then?”
,” he went on, “that you seem perfectly happy single, and you have an amazing career. It’s not really the same, is it?”
“Indeed. Well, it’s going to be a busy day, so I’ll let you rest up. See you in the morning, Harry.”
Hermione’s expression relaxed. She eyed him up and down before tilting her head in concession. “Fair point.”
“Well, they did actually let me bring books and things, luckily, so I’ve done a bit of reading. Gone flying once or twice, swum, walked around. Dealt with a ton of invasive questions from Blaise in front of a whole camera crew. You know, the usual.”
“Well, why not? We’re both single, gay, and extremely attractive.” Draco raised a challenging eyebrow.
Draco pouted. “Shouldn’t you be on my side, here? I would think you’d want me to spend quality time with my family, not get drunk with a bunch of old schoolmates who don’t even like me.”
He tried again. “Have you heard him mention anyone in particular recently? If there was someone, I’d think he would have said so, since he’s here so often.”
Later on, when they had stopped to get drinks and let their heart rates slow down, Harry looped back to their earlier conversation. “My family was part Indian, you know.”
His eyes are fixed on mine when I look at him. “Draco,” I say, savoring the feel of his name on my tongue, like it belongs there, and his red-rimmed eyes go soft. Another piece of the puzzle slots into place. “It means everything.”
“You’re welcome. Now finish your drink, we have to get back. I can’t just faff about entertaining you all day; I have actual work to do.
“You’re not. This was perfect.” Draco pulled a blanket up over him. He leaned down and pressed a kiss to his forehead. “Goodnight Harry.” But Harry was already asleep.
“We could always wait until we get home?” Harry suggested, knowing, now, that there was no way in hell that Draco would take him up on that offer.
“Indeed. Well, as we expand, we’re hoping to reallocate some of our more senior staff; the majority are still in the New York office, which leaves the rest of our locations fairly bottom-heavy. I was hoping that, since you grew up here and are familiar with the workings of the UK magical community, you might consider a transfer.”
He hugged her back, letting his cheek rest against her temple, her bushy curls tickling his nose in a comfortingly familiar way. “Yeah. I think so. Thanks.”
Harry, whose face had taken on a curious look at Draco’s unconscious glance, gave a small, relieved smile, but didn’t move away. “Good,” he said, his voice soft. He paused for a moment, seeming to make a decision, and then he was leaning down slightly, and oh god, he was doing to kiss Draco, and Draco was going to
Harry shivered, but laughed. “Point. I should tell Ron and Hermione first, too; they’d kill me if it somehow got to them before I could.” His hands travelled back to the loose locks of hair at the base of Draco’s skull, tugging lightly.
Ginny, who had been passing, apparently overheard this last bit because she looked over at them. “He’s here for Harry?” she asked Ron. Ron nodded, and she shifted her attention to Draco. “About damned time.” She glanced over her shoulder, and Draco followed her gaze to see Mrs. Weasley on her way back, holding several mugs and a plate of cookies. “For Merlin’s sake,” Ginny hissed, “get out of here while you can.”
Oddly, this course of action seemed to work perfectly well. No one said anything strange to Harry when he entered the kitchen, and no one gave him any knowing looks while he ate breakfast. He was tempted to ask Draco if anyone had seen him as he came downstairs—it hadn’t been particularly early, so he wasn’t sure everyone would still have been asleep—but eventually he decided that “pretend it never happened” would be his best bet to avoid awkward conversations with Draco, as well, so he opted to leave it alone.
? Why not, I don’t know, get one of those Muggle punching bags? Or spar properly, safely?” Harry clamped his lips shut, not wanting to let anything else slip out, but Draco kept going. “Why not come to me? I could have helped.”
Draco sighed, knowing that there was no way he was coming out of this unscathed. “It’s a Christmas party, then, I assume?”
He tried to shift subtly, desperate not to wake Draco but even more desperate to get out of this predicament before it got more awkward than it already was. He almost thought he’d managed it for a few seconds, having slid ninety percent of his body free. That last ten percent, however, included trying to get Draco’s head from the very edge of Harry’s shoulder onto the mattress below—which, it turned out, was quite enough movement to startle him awake.
A timer dinged, and Draco moved to take the rolls from the oven. They looked golden brown and perfect, and he breathed in the scent of them appreciatively.
“I guess I won’t be wooing you with my skill in the kitchen,” he managed, and Harry cackled, falling forward so that his head was on Perry’s shoulder.
He woke up on Thursday morning to the peaceful sound of raindrops pattering against windows and leaves. Blinking blearily, he pushed his glasses onto his face and climbed out of bed, wandering over to the sliding glass doors out to his balcony. A steady rain fell from a blanket of velvety grey clouds, the water making the wood planks of the balcony shine. It wouldn’t be a day for outdoor adventures, but Harry found himself smiling. The idea of a cozy day in sounded ideal after the string of activities they’d undertaken thus far this week.
The amused expression disappeared, replaced by a disbelieving stare. “Sorry, did you just ask me to be your
“Yes,” Draco answered immediately, much to Harry’s relief. His hands had drifted down from Harry’s face at some point, and he was now running them exploratorily over his shoulders, down his arms. “Please. If you leave early tomorrow, no one will notice.”
“Great! I might have to do a little bit of behind the scenes work, but based on the conversations I’ve had, I think we’re in good shape. I should be able to have the paperwork drafted and to you for review within the next week or so.”
Much to Harry’s disappointment, he wouldn’t get to play against Draco again today. Two of the Wasps’ reserve players would be taking the field—Draco had been coerced into a formal dinner between the Greengrass and Malfoy families, and one of the team’s Chasers, Andrew Sampson, was recovering from what Draco had assured Harry was an equally humiliating and hilarious accident during a post-match celebration the week before. This left Abigail Simon, whom Draco had replaced, playing seeker, while the Chaser vacancy was filled—much to Harry’s chagrin—by Zacharias Smith. The man had always been an irritating git, and the looks he’d been giving Harry indicated that he hadn’t changed much since school.
Harry’s hands clenched against Draco’s arse as he ground forward once more. “Fucking hell,” he muttered. Running his hands around and down Draco’s thighs, he dug his fingers in hard. “Wouldn’t have pegged you as the submissive type.”
“Don’t be difficult, Potter. It’s art, not pornography. Nudes have been one of the most prolific genres of fine art for hundreds of years.”
Harry raised an eyebrow. “I don’t know if I count that as starting easy. It was… well, it was new, I’ll give you that. But in the end I think I’m glad I did it. It made me feel a bit more at ease in my skin, which I wasn’t expecting. Plus, I got to see everyone’s artistic… talents… which was pretty fun.”
“Don’t bother,” Draco cut him off, waving a hand dismissively. “We both know you were lying about that assignment.” Harry’s eyes went wide and he hissed a ‘
It shouldn’t feel as good as it does, I think, but then again, the whole point of this is that there is no ‘should,’ so I decide not to worry about it.
Harry’s walk back to the house was brisker than before. When he got back to his rooms, he pressed the button for elf service.
Draco ignored them in favor of sliding his hands into Harry’s birdsnest of hair, pulling lightly and making him groan into the kiss. He supposed this one counted as a win for both of them.
Harry’s face felt hot, and he was immensely grateful that he’d inherited his father’s dark complexion, which he knew from rather too much experience did a decent job of hiding any inconvenient blushing. “Yeah, Jack’s really something,” he said, resignedly aware that his reaction would be extremely apparent to anyone watching, blush or no blush, so there was no point in dissembling. “A lot of people seemed pretty cool, though. I’m looking forward to getting to know them all a bit better.” When Blaise kept looking at him expectantly, he wrinkled his eyebrows in confusion until he caught sight of Pansy in the background, glaring and gesturing impatiently for him to go on, and remembered the lines she’d drilled into his head ahead of time. “—and seeing if any of them could potentially be the one.”
Draco laughed. “I suppose that’s valid. Fine, you can Apparate from here, but if you do, I’m not going downstairs until morning. I don’t want to deal with them any more than you do.”
“Pardon?” Draco asked, thrown off-kilter by the odd statement, before quickly correcting himself. Luna’s oddity didn’t excuse poor manners on his part. “I mean, I’m sorry, it’s lovely to see you, too.”
“Yes and no,” Harry replied. “My workshop was already here, and I had the flat upstairs, I just didn’t use it that much. You know I own the old Black house on Grimmauld Place?”
“That’s up to your Healers.” His mother’s voice was firm, and Draco couldn’t help feeling an exasperated fondness at her overprotectiveness. Or, at least, he couldn’t until he remembered just why he’d been playing so recklessly in the first place.
This time, Harry didn’t hold back. He kissed Draco passionately, grasping his waist and then, much to Draco’s delighted surprise, hoisting him up so that he was sitting on the counter without ever parting their lips. Gamely, Draco wrapped his legs around Harry’s waist. Harry slid his hands around to Draco’s arse, pulling him forward until their groins were pressed firmly together.
Harry gave Draco an exasperated look. “Would you rather blind-Apparate to a house in the middle of a forest without any way of getting to us if you miscalculate?” Draco shot him a glare.
In which Harry talks Draco into skiving off work, an escape room date turns out not to be the best idea, and there are fireworks.
It didn’t, but Harry nodded anyway, because there wasn’t much else he could do at this point. Luna summoned a number of props for him—a slatted wooden chair, an apple crate, a book, and even a broomstick—and walked him through a series of poses, timing them. Harry had to admit that the whole thing was easier with the props. If he was concentrating on how to interact with one of the objects, he didn’t focus so much on his nudity or the room full of people watching him. He tried to ignore everyone but Luna, following her directions until she finally called time.
Harry hurried off after a pointed glare from Teddy, and rejoined them shortly to settle himself at the other end of the sofa. “
The trio took the floo to the Leaky Cauldron and exited to Muggle London, quickly hopping on a bus. Teddy had evidently done this before, as he seemed completely comfortable and insisted on taking the front seats on the top deck, pointing various things out to Harry and Draco as they went.
Harry had hoped that he could sneak back into the cottage without his friends realizing that he’d been out all night, but he should have known better. Hermione was curled up on the sofa in the front room with a cup of tea and a book when he walked in. She looked up and raised an eyebrow at him, saying nothing.
They made the bust on Tuesday. Monday had been a rush of preparations and contingency planning and final logistics, and the stakeout had lasted all day, but in the end, it had been worth it—they’d brought in six players in one sweep and were confident that at least one of them would give up the rest in exchange for sentencing leniency. Draco had dropped into bed exhausted but elated.
“They really never stop, do they?” Harry commented, not sure whether he was impressed, amused, annoyed, or some combination of the three. “Did they at least use a silencing charm?”
Once the stew was on the stovetop, Greg decided to poke through the house guide for instructions on how to use the fire pit. Harry joined his friends in the games room, where Hermione was thoroughly trouncing both Blaise and Luna at darts, the magical scoreboard showing her a good hundred points ahead of either of them on their race to zero. Ron and Draco soon found them, returning the chess set to a cabinet in favor of watching Hermione destroy her competition.
They’d been through two clothing shops, a candy store, the Owl Emporium, and a jewelry store already, and although Teddy had pointed at and asked questions about many things, he had yet to make a purchase. It was, Draco found, an interesting mix of adorable and exasperating. Now, Teddy had stopped in front of a toy shop. “Look in the window!” Teddy announced proudly, pointing. “Harry made it. See?”
Putting on his poshest, most dismissive voice, Draco broke the until-now-comfortable post-fuck silence. “Well. It’s been fun, but I think this whole…
“Ohhh. Yeah, there are potions that people sometimes use that are like that. They’ll get you kicked right out of whatever competition you’re in if you’re found out.”
She studied him for a moment. “Alright. Then answer this: can you honestly say that you have feelings for me right now?”
Draco, who hadn’t experienced anything but excellent meals since he’d arrived, laughed. “Yes, I can see that; you’re normally all so lazy.” Andromeda swatted at him with a dish towel. Draco dodged and then looked at Harry curiously. “You weren’t here last week, though.”
He found his thoughts drifting to Draco. Draco was single, as well, and he was far from unlovable. But Harry wasn’t sure that it was the same. Draco seemed perfectly content to be single. If he wasn’t, Harry was sure he would have had someone by now. He was gorgeous, for one thing, and even if he weren’t, he was funny and witty and just mean enough to keep things interesting. He was also, Harry was coming to see, extremely caring and protective of his friends, although Harry doubted that he would admit as much if confronted. No, Harry decided, it wasn’t the same at all. Draco would be a catch in anyone’s book. Harry was… well, just Harry. Once people got past the fame, he didn’t really have that much going for him.
Despite the corny line, Harry couldn’t help but feel hopeful as they made their way back toward his temporary home. Maybe he wouldn’t walk away from here single and frustrated after all.
“You know, Harry,” Cormac went on, apparently unphased by Harry’s lackluster response, “I’ve been thinking about it, and I believe we could be quite the power couple when all this is over.” He waved vaguely behind them, seemingly encompassing the boat and everybody on it.
“Well, I feel exhausted,” Draco replied, but despite his attempts to sound put out, he couldn’t hold back his smile. “Next time you’re in a mood, I’m sending you for a run and staying by the pool with a cocktail.”
Harry rushed into the room, red-faced and frantic with two Medi-Witches at his heels. Luna went over to calm them, but Draco barely noticed, entranced by Harry’s wild appearance. He ignored the room’s other occupants, eyes solely focused on Draco, his body finally relaxing as his eyes roamed over him and seemed to register that he was all in one piece. “Oh thank fuck.” In three long strides, he was across the room, and then he was leaning over and kissing Draco soundly.
something, something that said ‘you’re important to me.’ He found a small cafe to have a bite at and bought a sandwich, sitting down at a little table by the window to think.
“Very. She’s moved into a house with her sister and grand-nephew and seems utterly delighted by their company. Although apparently the house isn’t quite full enough for her; she keeps trying to convince me to move back, as well.” He gave her a wry smile.
Despite his words, he found himself yanking Harry’s head back by his hair so that he could kiss him again. Harry whimpered and Draco felt a thrill of victory as he once again took command of their embrace. It didn’t take long for Harry to regain his senses though, biting at Draco’s bottom lip in retaliation and making Draco laugh. “That all you’ve got, Potter?”
with his former rival. Looking across the room, his eyes met Potter’s; the other man looked equally distraught.
“Draco?!” he called, quickly assessing the direction the sound was coming from. “Draco! Are you okay?” Over the sounds of the shower running, a string of curse words interspersed with yelps of what sounded like pain was his only answer. Without thinking, Harry slid the door of the bathroom open.
Harry scrubbed his hands over his face in frustration. “Dammit. I’m sorry! Sadiyah just… said some stuff last night before she left, and it’s fucking with me.”
Malfoy stops going back to the Manor. We do actually talk about that, because even before the war changed him, he knew you couldn’t just move into someone’s house without asking them. Although the war did help solidify that, a bit, what with his own uninvited housemates. I tell him it’s fine, and what I mean is it’s great, but I can’t imagine telling him that, even though I tell him everything else. We don’t talk about ‘us’. I think we’re both afraid that if we put it into words, it will break the spell.
He was still riding high when he sauntered into Harry and Weasley’s office on Wednesday. He leaned ostentatiously over Harry’s desk, stretching almost directly over his perpetually-tousled head to grab a piece of chalk and carefully add six perfectly straight tally marks to his own side of the board, giving him the lead by three.
“Swimming now,” Ginny stated firmly, taking advantage of Pansy’s indignant distraction to slip out of her grip and swing the door open. As soon as it clicked into place, a ladder magically extended down into the water, providing a convenient exit and entry point. Ginny, of course, ignored it and jumped right in. When her head popped back up, she was gasping. “Fuck, it’s even colder than yesterday!” She stretched out so that she was floating on her back. “Feels amazing after the sun, though.”
“Well, don’t these look nice!” Nancy exclaimed as they approached, and Harry beamed. Perry looked hesitantly optimistic, relaxing further when he cut them into pieces and they looked almost identical to Nancy’s samples on the inside. “Wonderful job, boys. Now, let’s see how they taste.”
Dinner passed pleasantly, casual physical contact escalating in frequency and intimacy as the wine bottle emptied, much as it had on their previous date. As Draco had predicted, Harry had been delighted by the modernized variation on treacle tart that he’d pre-ordered for them to close the meal, giving Draco a startled grin when it had appeared. He had a fantastic smile. He had a fantastic everything, really—Draco was more open to admitting that fact to himself now that Harry was his date and not just his coworker and formal rival.
He twirled a cue between his long fingers, studying it. Harry pointedly didn’t watch. Instead, he pushed himself off the door frame and walked over to the table, studying it.
Ron made a gagging noise, and Hermione thwapped him lightly with the magazine of local attractions she was currently browsing. “Let them be happy!”
Harry grinned. “They’re one of the better things we’re importing now that the Ministry has stopped suppressing international trade quite so heavily. Apparently, Japan has had them for decades, but the tariffs were so high they weren’t even bothering to try to sell them here.”
Draco smirked and walked over to him, hands in his pockets, until he was a bit too close for comfort. Harry could feel the heat radiating off of him, and the hairs on his arms and the back of his neck prickled from the proximity.
Draco ran a hand through Harry’s hair, sending gentle shivers down his spine. “Me either,” he admitted, voice uncharacteristically serious. “I spent so much time trying not to think about it. I thought, sometimes… but then you’d pull back, and I’d be sure I’d imagined it.”
Draco held back an eye roll and perused the list, which appeared to be the latter part of the alphabet. Several names stood out to him—Parkinson, Zabini, a somewhat surprising number of Weasleys, and, of course, Potter.
gotten to see him at all. It wasn’t remotely true, of course, but he folded quickly nevertheless. He was still fairly floating from the night before, so he didn’t bother to put up much of a fight. He hadn’t been to Diagon Alley in years, and anyway, he thought, it would be nice to spend some time with her out of the house.
Blaise ignored her, stepping toward the hot tub and climbing in unconcernedly. He stood right next to Luna, putting him directly across from Harry and Draco—and thus
Once the doors had closed and Owen and Leela had returned to the group, Blaise addressed them all. “Congratulations on making the top twelve! But don’t rest too easily. You’ll have a day to recover, but after our next group date, two more of you will be leaving the mansion. Good night, everyone!”
Leela huffed a quiet laugh. “We noticed.” Harry looked at her, confused. Before he could ask what she meant, however, she added, “I really am sorry.”
“That’s precisely why I like it,” Draco said. “I can drink my wine and enjoy the breeze without having to worry if my stomach is going to decide to expel itself from my body.”
He looked sad and embarrassed and Draco knew that if he hadn’t already decided to tell the truth, he would have done so now. “You didn’t misread,” he said, chest tight. “I just can’t. Even if I might want to. It’s not a good idea.”
“Yeah, well, you didn’t know him in school,” Draco groused, staring down at his shoes. “He was a grade A prat.”
“No way to find out but to try, yeah?” Ron climbed in eagerly, and Harry, not to be out-Gryffindored, quickly followed. Sure enough, as soon as Harry’s feet hit the water, the tub expanded slightly, leaving it a perfect size for two. He laughed in delight. Magic really never got old. As Harry settled, Greg grimaced at the water but stepped in, heaving a sigh of relief as the space once again expanded to accommodate his broad form.
Harry leaned forward and kissed him again, catching his lips while they were open, and meeting them softly as they closed.  Draco hummed softly as his rant died, and Harry pulled back to find him looking a bit stunned.
Despite having been in operation for less than twenty years, the firm had grown exponentially. The rapid growth had meant hiring and training new staff on a massive scale. Draco had found himself recruited based solely on a chance encounter with an older witch he’d met in passing at his tailor’s who had been impressed with his polished demeanor. “Your posture inspires confidence,” the woman had told him, and the next thing he knew, he was being pushed through a rapid training course and out into the world.
“How much further were you planning to drag us, Granger?” Draco asked from the log he’d draped himself over. “Just an approximation will do.” His shirt was riding up, exposing sweat-damp skin, and Harry desperately tried not to imagine licking it. He groaned internally. Even being bone-tired wasn’t enough to keep him from ogling his friend anymore. Stupid accidental cuddling, further degrading carefully-built (but already thinning) mental walls.
“Luna Lovegood is spoken very highly of by all of the British wizards that I know and respect,” she told him coldly, “and she is a very good friend of Harry’s.”
“I might have to take you up on that.” He held her gaze for a moment more before clearing his throat and looking away. “What about you, Leela?”
“Hi, I’m Dermot,” he said with a dazzling smile, reaching out to shake Harry’s hand firmly. “I’m so pleased to be here.”
Despite his best efforts, when Harry returned to the sofas—tea in hand—he saw that Draco’s eyes were cracked open, watching him blearily. When he caught Harry’s gaze, he patted the cushions by his head, and Harry accepted the unspoken invitation. Draco lifted his head as Harry set the two mugs of tea down, making just enough room for him to sit before dropping his head back down onto Harry’s thigh and immediately closing his eyes again.
Back in his suite, after everyone was sent their separate ways, Harry was joined by Blaise. They settled into two beautifully upholstered but desperately uncomfortable chairs in front of a small film crew. “So, Harry,” Blaise opened, giving him a carefully-composed look of intense interest, as though he was about to ask the most important question of all time, “how are you feeling now that you’ve had a chance to get to know everyone a bit more? Are your initial impressions still holding true?”
Harry waffled for a moment before deciding that breakfast could wait a bit longer while he had his soak. He cast a charm to keep his food warm, hoping that Dilly couldn’t sense the magic somehow, before stripping out of his pajamas and climbing into the frothy bath with a contented sigh, inhaling the soothing scent of lavender. His eyes had just dropped shut when he heard a knock at the door. He groaned inwardly. That had to be Draco. He didn’t know why he’d thought he wouldn’t come by right away, but it was too late to change course now, he supposed.
The family had shared what should have been  a festive dinner, but Draco’s mind had been half-elsewhere the entire time. His mother and Andromeda had taken turns shooting him concerned looks, but neither had said anything. Narcissa had seemed to struggle with holding back her words, and her face was sad, but she’d ultimately kept her thoughts to herself. Teddy’s mood, too, had turned after Harry had mentioned Draco’s departure, and although he had seemed to be fine on and off, he had picked at his plate morosely once they were all seated. Eventually, Andromeda had ended their suffering, saying that she was going to go read her new book from Draco, and the rest of them had gratefully taken the excuse to go their separate ways.
Draco took another deep breath, letting it out slowly before responding, his fury turning his voice ice cold, every syllable pronounced with dangerously sharp diction.“To be perfectly frank,
“Yeah, really.” He released her, watching her return to Owen’s side. His arm came up around her, and it was clear that he’d been holding back out of politeness. Now that they had Harry’s blessing, he seemed to relax. “We all came here to find love, right? Or at least the potential for it.”
It’s different with him here all the time, because we can’t just lie around listening to music all day every day, so we have to interact more like people. I was afraid that might break the spell, too, but it hasn’t. We bicker about chores. He steals my clothes sometimes (even though he always tells me they’re hideous). I’m teaching him how to cook. It’s… nice. It makes me feel more like myself.
Harry debated responding, annoyed at his tone, but before he could decide, a clearly unimpressed Gabrielle chimed in.
I shrug, even though he can’t see me. “Living?” I’m not sure what he wants to hear, how much it’s safe to say.
Draco felt his chest clench and tried to push it down, knowing that Harry wouldn’t appreciate his pity. But then— “Wait, are you saying you used
They finished their breakfast while Teddy examined his new belongings, and soon, Harry got up to leave. “I’ve got to go get ready,” he said apologetically.
Once they were dried and rested, Harry and Sadiyah decided to take a stroll along the boardwalk. They bought a couple of ice creams to cool themselves off and chatted amiably as they walked. Harry asked Sadiyah more about her own childhood, curious about her unusual education.
“Shut up,” Harry muttered, feeling unaccountably warm. He could swear he heard a giggle as he moved back into the room.
“Yeah, that was pretty clear from the screaming public row and breakup,” Ron snorted, and Harry’s head snapped back up to give his friend a betrayed look. Ron at least had the decency to look slightly abashed. “‘Mione’s parents get the Australian papers and send the articles that mention you to us,” he admitted.
“We actually have a surprise for you on that front,” Blaise told him, pulling a brown paper portfolio out of nowhere. “As a gift from the show and your suitors, you get to take all of their final works home!”
The second assault had, of course, come from Ginny—a move that Harry probably should have seen coming. It had been a Sunday afternoon, shortly after dinner at the Burrow, and Harry had been in a bit of a food coma, which always made him a bit more easygoing—something of which Ginny was very much aware.
It had been perhaps twenty minutes when a long arm dropped suddenly over Pansy’s shoulder and a head of red hair leaned down to press a kiss to her temple. “Hello, gorgeous!” came the somehow-still-familiar voice of George Weasley.
“I mean, you still don’t really drive or use phones or anything, though,” Harry agreed reluctantly, grimacing at Ron’s look of outrage. “Sorry, but you know it’s true.”
As they poured over ridiculously priced produce, Harry had a moment of regret that he hadn’t let Hermione have her way. He hadn’t wanted to have his vacation be too strictly structured, but planning five and a half days worth of meals on the fly had turned out to be a bit more complicated than he’d expected. Still, by the end of their trip, they had filled the boot of the car with bags upon bags of dry goods, vegetables, fruits, and meats. A second stop filled the half of the back seat that wasn’t taken up by Ron with what seemed, to Harry, to be a rather ridiculous amount of alcohol, but Ron and Greg were adamant that it was in no way excessive for nine people on a week-long vacation.
Stepping back into Harry’s space, Draco wrapped his hands around the back of his neck, rubbing his thumbs in circles at the base of his skull. “Well. You’re a complete idiot—”
“I found her sneaking around the corner trying to get pictures of you and Gabrielle just now,” Hilde said, glaring at Nathalie. “She had a Quick Quotes Quill behind her ear and everything.”
“Shut up,” Draco said, making Harry laugh, and he climbed out of bed. He was headed toward the loo when he remembered. “Oh! I brought you shampoo.”
The smile made Draco’s chest clench, and he wondered if he should just come out and say that he thought perhaps he’d changed his mind, that maybe he wanted to pursue this after all. “Do you ever think of having children of your own?” he asked instead.
Hermione was quite visibly trying to bite back a smile. “Not that this isn’t all very important,” she said, “but we should discuss a timeline for getting back on the road, yes?”
“Of course.” Harry returned the smile. “Stick around for the elimination ceremony, though, okay? Pretty sure they’re going to make me have one, regardless, and I’ll look like less of a tit if I can tell you good luck in person rather than having you disappear into the night.”
“No one but the crew saw,” Draco promised him. “We unlocked the door as soon as we realized what was happening. They just think that something broke down.”
“I suppose it isn’t the worst thing that could have happened,” Draco conceded. “Better than the alternatives.”
“He never seemed particularly interested in any one of us while we were at the house,” Gabrielle chimed in. “And we could see behind the scenes how they were drawn to each other, especially with how the crew talked. It was a disappointment, at the time, but not a surprise.”
Draco hummed in understanding. “Fair. Do try to keep yourself distracted today, though. The more you dwell on it, the more trouble you’ll have moving forward.”
He joined the long queue at the register. While he waited, he idly watched the other patrons of the store hurrying to finish their own Christmas shopping, wondering who they were buying their gifts for and what the recipients would feel when they opened them. When he finally made it to the front, he paid for two items: a little wooden owl and a trio of tiny sledders in a snow globe. He asked the shop attendant to wrap the second item but not the first, and he headed home. Once he’d dropped off his packages, he thought, perhaps he would stop by Harry’s workshop to bring him a cappuccino.
Face unreadable, Narcissa reached out and pushed a strand of hair back from his forehead. He closed his eyes. “Alright,” she said, finally, dropping her hand. “I just have one favor to ask.”
Harry snickered and grabbed his own wand from where he’d left it on his nightstand earlier that day, summoning a washcloth from the bathroom and wiping the worst of the mess from both of their stomachs. Tossing it to the floor, he turned onto his side so that he was facing Draco. He was flushed and sweaty and gorgeous, and Harry couldn’t believe that he was allowed to see him like this. And touch him like this, he realized, reaching out to run light fingers over his protruding clavicles, down his ribs, across his hip bones. Draco arched into the touch and let out a contented hum. “You’re like a cat,” Harry observed.
sent to me at home. There was so much horribly intrusive tripe printed about me and my family after the war, I just stopped following any of it.”
The answer came in a sort of irritated whisper-yell. “Because it’s three in the fucking morning, and Greg’s snoring sounds like a goddamned Erumpent in heat when he’s drunk.”
“It’s pretty excellent,” Harry agreed, pleased. “If I thought I would ever be a passable baker, I might even get one myself.”
“Just the once,” Harry muttered. He felt his shoulders raise defensively and looked at his feet. “Why hasn’t he said anything, then?”
“Yeah, I know,” Harry admitted, “but at least I won’t have to show up to practice with my cheating wanker of an ex-boyfriend every day.”
“Either Harry ending up with someone else or the entire season having to be scrapped.” Draco answered promptly.
“Do you want that list alphabetically?” Harry had asked, once he was able to process what she was suggesting. “Because I can’t do that off the top of my head, but I can get back to you.”
Harry put a hand on his knee to silence him. “Thank you.” He gave Draco a small smirk. “Honestly, it might have been the best part of the date.”
Draco’s heart did something a bit funny. “I’m not sure,” he said, turning back, “but I suppose we’d best not risk it.”
“Cheers,” Blaise said, lifting his head from the ground just enough to take several deep gulps before collapsing once more. He had also stripped his shirt off, and Harry thought amusedly that this time it might actually be for practicality and not aesthetic. Even Ginny seemed tired, which was really quite an achievement. She was slumped on the ground with her back against the stump that Pansy had perched upon, and for once was not needling her brother or trying to get people up and moving.
After the tasting, she walked them through the actual works, where they walked past vast cisterns and through rooms of stacked barrels where she talked about the different types of wood used and the ways that they affected the different lots. Apparently, in magical distilling, it was a bit similar to wandmaking in that each type of wood imbued different properties into the final product.
Harry opened his mouth to respond, enjoying their banter and the direction it seemed to be taking, but was interrupted by Ron’s voice summoning him. “Dammit. Gotta go.” He considered for a moment, and then decided to take a chance. “Let’s get together soon, though, yeah? You’re staying at the manor?”
Later, after doing his post-episode interview with Blaise, Harry wandered out onto his balcony, feeling tired, but not sleepy. Gazing up at the night sky, he pondered Blaise’s speech and the unpredictable nature of love. He’d meant what he told the couple earlier: they’d come here to find love, and they’d found it, and he was happy for them. It was a bit like a prophecy, in some ways, he thought: their wishes had come true, but not in the way that they’d expected. It was sort of poetic.
“Be a dear and gather up any of Maximilian’s remaining things, would you?” He’d learned the hard way that obstinate exes often used ‘forgotten’ belongings as an excuse to attempt to weasel their way back into his life, so these days, he simply boxed everything up and had it delivered to its rightful owner before they could try. It saved him from unnecessary and uncomfortable interactions with people he’d rather just forget. Clossy gave him a sympathetic look and disappeared with a snap.
The kitchen was an absolute disaster, and Draco was having more fun than he’d probably ever had while making food. Narcissa had, predictably, set her heart on a far wider variety of biscuits than any reasonable person would consider necessary, but for once, Draco wasn’t complaining. She and Andromeda had made sugar and gingerbread biscuit doughs earlier in the day, so he was working with Harry to roll them out and cut them into shapes. Andromeda was making a shortbread base for lemon bars, and Narcissa was helping Teddy to roll the Russian tea cakes she’d just removed from the oven in icing sugar. She was streaked in the fine white powder up to her elbows, down the apron she was wearing, and across her face; Draco didn’t think he had ever seen her look so disheveled in her life. Teddy, of course, was even worse.
They continued to rock slowly, every movement intentional and heavy with something that Draco wasn’t sure he could bear.
“Okay, everyone! Let’s do a little tour,” came Nancy’s cheerful voice. They gathered again, and she handed them each a glass of water. “For cleansing your palate between tastes,” she told them, before starting them at the workspace at the front right of the room. “Jane and Kevin, let’s see how you did.”
She sniffled quietly, and his heart broke a little bit. “Hey,” he told her, reaching to tilt her chin up so that she would meet his eyes. “You are spectacular, okay? You are gorgeous, and kind, and smart, and the way you stood up for Luna today was completely fantastic.”
“They better be, for what we paid for them,” Greg grumbled. “The price of produce here is practically robbery.”
“What, you mean besides your spending two days draping yourself over every surface you could manage whenever I was nearby?”
Harry poked at his split lip in the mirror and hissed. He could already see a nasty bruise forming across one cheekbone, and his eye was beginning to swell. And that wasn’t even getting into the various smaller cuts and bruises.
“I apologize for wanting to ensure that you didn’t have to scrap an episode,” Draco drawled sardonically at her, but Harry noticed that he was a bit pink in the face.
Sure enough, whatever commentary she’d had on Harry’s suit was dropped with a put-upon sigh in favor of a final rundown on the way the night would progress. Harry had heard it all a hundred times already, but knowing that, downstairs, the cameras were already set up and ready to go made him grateful for the reminder. He knew he was going to make a fool of himself at some point, but he supposed that avoiding it being in the very first episode would be something, anyway.
Harry shoved him away with one hand, wiping his lips with the other. “Ugh, what the hell?!” He gave Cormac a disbelieving look.
“And, what, we should all just forget about it? My parents died because of the wars. My godfather. My godson’s parents. Professors. Classmates. Friends. Fucking hell, Sullivan,
“Come on, Draco!” Teddy chimed in. “We’re going to the fair, and to the shops, and to see the tree and the lights, and we’re going to have hot chocolate!”
Also, I have both done a lot of figure drawing and been a nude model, so there was a lot of drawing from experience here on both sides. Especially with regards to not a single piece looking a thing like me.
Draco still looked concerned, but it was now tinged with confusion. “What happened? What do you need?”
It wasn’t entirely avoidance, he told himself. He had Christmas shopping to do, and he could pick up some of the things Mother would need for her party to mollify her after his abrupt departure. He opted to walk the twenty minutes to Hogsmeade’s shopping district rather than Apparating, allowing the crisp winter air to clear his head and calm his nerves.
“Honestly, I’m exhausted,” Harry admitted. “I might take a nap, try to adjust to the time difference a bit. We could pick up some dinner later? I think the owners left a list of nearby restaurants. I’m too knackered to think about cooking.”
“And they were all things you really liked or really wanted to try, right? Except for the escape room, but I can see why he thought that would be up your alley.”
Now that he was here, Draco didn’t quite want to leave yet, so he searched for something else to talk about. “How was the game?” he finally asked.
Pansy got straight down to business. “So. We actually got some decent footage yesterday, so thank you for not being a complete stick in the mud.”
“Hey, don’t cry. It’s okay, really. I’m happy for you.” And he found that he meant it. He hadn’t even thought about tonight’s eliminations, he realized. He liked everyone who was still here; he had no idea how he would have gone about choosing who to send home. But this… this was a good reason. A happy reason. After the toxicity of the last two elimination nights, it was a relief. It felt right.
If possible, Hilde looked even more smug. “Darling?” she said, turning—to Harry’s (and everyone else’s judging by the reactions) surprise—to William Williams III, who was seated to her right. He took her bejewelled hand and kissed it before turning to Blaise.
“I really liked him,” he mumbled, voice thick, after he had cried himself out. A hand carded through his still-damp hair.
. And, he thought as he watched him catch a wooden dragonfly as it tried to dive off one of the tables, laughing, it was...
Harry laughed. “I wish! But no, honestly, I have no idea. There are some people I’m more drawn to than others, but I don’t want to get ahead of myself.”
“I… of course not. Yes.” Draco’s mind was reeling, trying to synthesize everything he’d just heard. “Thank you. For telling me.” He paused, took a deep breath. “For what it’s worth, I care about him, as well.”
Blaise shook his hand, clasping it in both of his own before gesturing for him to sit. “Perry, it’s wonderful to see you again. You look fantastic.”
“Of course,” Draco said, disappointed but trying not to sound it. “I completely understand. We can have dinner another night.”
“Take Ginny Weasley. She’s always been a mediocre player, but the Harpies were just raring to snag her. Bet they thought taking on the Savior’s sloppy seconds would boost their popularity.”
Pansy shrugged nonchalantly and stood to pour herself a glass of apparently now properly decanted wine. Ginny was practically choking trying to hold back her laughter. Harry grinned, partially in amusement at Ron’s indignance and partially at how Draco was currently smothering a fit of giggles against his shoulder.
Harry laughed. “I mean, okay, I was kind of upset at first when I realized there was footage airing from times I hadn’t realized I was being filmed. But at least I signed up to be on air in the first place. It was much more jarring for Draco,” he told Blaise.
“Seriously. And I had some guesses, obviously, but I didn’t have an answer myself until I was out of school. My aunt wouldn’t talk about my mum and dad, and at Hogwarts I was a bit preoccupied. But after the war, I got curious again, so Hermione and Draco helped me do some research.”
Draco dropped his bags gratefully as he walked into the small foyer. The facade of the house as he approached had been tiny in comparison to the Manor but huge by New York standards, and cozy, all honey-colored stones and trailing ivy with a solid wooden door. The many windows were all alight with candles against the early winter darkness, and there were wreathes of fir and holly on each of them. The interior was just as cozy, full of dark wood, warm stone, creamy white walls, and elegant but homey velvet-covered furniture. There were plush rugs and overstuffed bookcases and an array of paintings and photographs. There were, notably, no portraits. It couldn’t have been more different than the Manor.
“Oh my god.” The absurdity of the situation was just hitting Harry. “I have no clue. They didn’t exactly leave us much to do, did they? Other than—” he looked behind them at the bed, and then at the bedside table again. “I’m honestly terrified to know what they put in that drawer,” he confessed.
“Don’t worry, she hasn’t given in entirely to my charms,” George told Draco with a smirk of his own. “Can’t pin this one down, can you? But she’s a hell of a good time.”
He laughed, but left the stool to retrieve a bottle of red wine, which he uncorked with a wave of his hand. He poured four glasses, one of which Narcissa promptly claimed, appearing in the kitchen as silently as Harry had.
In the years following the war, Teddy Lupin’s care had fallen almost entirely on Andromeda Tonks. Harry had helped as best he could, but there was only so much he could do, especially as Teddy grew past toddlerhood. He’d seen how isolated Teddy was from kids his own age, and he knew from experience what not having friends or playmates was like for a small child, but since Andromeda’s friends’ children were quite a bit older than Teddy and Harry’s friends were too young to have children the right age for him to play with, he didn’t really know what to do about it.
Harry looked torn. “I don’t suppose you’d want to just come here? I still want to see you, if you’re up for it. We could have something delivered, watch a movie?”
Once they’d disconnected, Draco quickly finished the letter he’d been working on and packed his briefcase away. He looked down at his outfit; he’d been planning to change before their date, but he supposed his current outfit—a soft pair of jeans he’d owned for years paired with a cozy cable-knit cardigan over a plain tee shirt—would be fine for an evening on the sofa. He didn’t generally wear these jeans out, but as Harry had seen him just as he woke up multiple times now—both intentionally and unintentionally—he didn’t feel as self conscious about wearing his comfortable clothes around him.
“Cousin Draco Cousin Draco!” Draco was awoken by a flying tackle as Teddy leapt onto his bed and landed on his chest. Despite the huff of breath that escaped him, he couldn’t help but laugh. It felt like it had been ages since the first time he’d first been woken like this, despite it actually having been barely more than three weeks ago.
“Ah. Well. I suppose it did what it was supposed to, then.” A pause. “I’d been thinking more along the lines of a fresh coat of paint and maybe getting rid of the house elf heads, but… hmm.”
the night that I—” Draco’s cheerful voice halted abruptly as he reached the bathroom door. Harry gripped the edge of the sink, aware of how his bloodied knuckles must look against the porcelain, and didn’t look up until a gentle pressure under his chin forced him to. He heard a sharp inhale, and reluctantly opened his eyes, although he couldn’t bring himself to meet his flatmate’s gaze. Draco’s expression was unreadable as he tipped Harry’s head from side to side, cataloguing his injuries. Harry guiltily savored the warmth of Draco’s fingers against his skin, trying to memorize the sensation before it ended.
Quiet footsteps approached Harry, and Draco’s quiet, disembodied voice spoke. “Sorry about this. There’s been some sort of delay. I’ve got people checking to see what the holdup is.”
The group kept up an easy banter as they wove around one another, scattering decorations over the large fir tree. They took their time, allowing Teddy to hem and haw over the location of each bauble, Harry gamely lifting him when he wanted to reach the higher branches. Andromeda poked fun at Narcissa for her meticulous arrangement of strings of cranberries, with Draco backing his mother up, insisting that there was nothing wrong with perfectionism. When Draco found a collection of bird-shaped ornaments, he commented that perhaps they should nest in Potter’s hair rather than on the tree, and Harry threw a carved wooden hedgehog at him, making Draco cackle. He felt warm all over.
Harry sighed and slumped onto the sofa. Draco joined him, curling up sideways so that he could see Harry’s face. “Two of George’s shop assistants called in sick today, so he needed Ron to help out.”
Harry had reassured him that it wasn’t about him, they’d exchanged a hug that involved the requisite amount of manly back-slapping, and then they’d all headed to the kitchen for food.
“Alright, come on,” he said, putting on a theatrically exasperated tone, “but this is the last hill, okay?”
Harry answered the knock on his workshop door promptly and didn’t look terribly surprised to see him. Andromeda must have given him a heads up. “Hey,” he said. “Come on in.”
of a lock being turned. The sound made Harry flinch, bringing back memories of too many times being locked in small, dark spaces.
The abrupt shift in atmosphere unnerved Harry, and all at once he realized just how far they’d wandered from their party. His apprehension returned, along with the now vivid recollection of just what had sparked it. “Erm, second chance?” he asked, desperately hoping that she wasn’t saying what he thought she was.
“So I met this guy while I was in America who was really into rock climbing, and we ended up out in Colorado for a while. This must have been, oh, ‘97, ‘98?”
“I dunno, I died before, and they still let me play,” Harry mused. His hands moved upward, toying with Draco’s hair tie briefly before pulling it free and letting his hair tumble down to his shoulders, a waterfall of gold-touched white. He ran his fingers through it, grazing over Draco’s scalp and making him shiver.
“Because, unlike you, we stayed in the country and actually bothered to make friends with people outside of our very small and very incestuous group of housemates,” Blaise smirked.
Harry snickered, and Pansy sent him a glare before turning it on Draco. Then she walked over to him and whispered something in his ear. Harry watched as his expression changed into something that reminded Harry unnervingly of the moments preceding many of his least-proud moments from school. Pansy pulled back and nodded at Draco once before stalking out of Harry’s rooms, high heels clacking angrily against the tiled floor.
Harry glanced at him in the mirror. “Honestly? No. The Dursleys would punish me for using anything other than the cheap bar soap. I was proud of myself for buying proper shampoo at all when I left Hogwarts.”
“Here.” Greg pulled open the pack he’d unceremoniously dumped on the ground when he’d sat, pulling out rather more water bottles than should have fit and tossing them out until everyone had one.
And then, for some Merlin-forsaken reason, Harry starts to laugh. At first, it’s just a snort. But then it’s followed by a chuckle, and then he’s
Potter was frowning into the middle distance past Malfoy’s right shoulder. He had drawn his wand almost absent-mindedly, and was now rolling it back and forth in his fingers in what was clearly a nervous habit.
He collapsed on a different sofa, since he couldn’t use a cleaning charm on the one where he’d slept and there were grimy smudges of ash on the silk. It was only after he sat down that he realised he was breathing hard. He didn’t feel exhausted, but certainly a lot more tired than he should have been given that all he’d done was have a shower and got dressed. Judging by the strength of the light now coming through the lake, it had also taken a lot longer than it normally did.
, they had to get the message - and then shouted over the growing sound around him - “I have wronged you, I beg your forgiveness!”
Potter was already seizing his hand and pulling him upright, grabbing the invisibility cloak before it could fall off Draco’s lap and handing Draco his crutches.
In other circumstances, Draco would have felt pissed off after a night spent on the most uncomfortable mattress he had ever had the misfortune to encounter. His back ached almost as much as his leg. But as it was, that discomfort barely registered, because today he had to talk to muggles.
He forced himself not to eat too fast, or too much. He had seen what happened when Ollivander had done that the first time Draco got home for the holidays in sixth year. Ollivander had nearly died. Draco had made a point to read up a bit about starvation after that. When he returned to Hogwarts that spring, he charged Prudy to continue the nightly ritual of sneaking food to Ollivander.
“The Potter boy also owes you a life-debt,” his father said. “You did not identify him when he was at the Manor.”
Potter huffed, but appeared somewhat appeased. “I won’t even be there. I’ll be staying at Hogwarts at the moment, to help with the rebuilding.”
Draco put his crutches down on the floor and rolled up the rough denim of the left leg of the jeans. He startled a little at a low rumbling sound, but when he looked up, he saw it was just the sound that the wheels of the doctor’s chair as she pulled herself around her desk to take a closer look.
From the corner of his eye, Draco could see that Potter’s posture was as tense and brittle as his voice. Draco drew the firewhiskey bottle closer and poured himself another finger, before handing it to Potter. He waited another minute, but Potter seemed determined not to say anything more, and Draco could no longer resist commenting.
Draco looked at him consideringly for a moment. “You know that it’s not your fault, right? You didn’t do anything wrong; you went for a walk.”
Draco pulled back, and his face was even paler than usual, his expression repentant. “I still should have— ”
“No! I mean, yes, you are, but I—” Harry groaned and rubbed his free hand down his face. “I meant in the jacket,” he mumbled, eyes closed. When he opened them again, Jack looked extremely amused.
Finishing his sandwich, Draco decided to file all of those thoughts away and focus on finding a gift. Chris had given him until the new year to make a decision. He had time.
In Draco’s peripheral vision, he saw Weasley bang his head against his desk. “I’m getting tea,” he announced, stalking out of the office. Draco raised an eyebrow at Potter, who shrugged.
“I promised the day to Pansy,” Draco told him regretfully, immediately feeling guilty for how much he wanted to throw over his friend to spend more time with Harry. “Tomorrow?”
The five of them followed a dirt path down toward the lake, enjoying the summer sun that bathed them as the trees thinned and then petered away. It wasn’t long before they reached the boathouse, which was situated on a small wooden pier. Peeking inside, Ron grinned.
“It really is. I don’t know if any of us really know how to navigate it, least of all me,” Harry admitted.
“Cousin Draco Cousin Draco!” the whirlwind shouted, coalescing, as Draco’s eyes began to focus, into a small boy with a riot of unnervingly familiar black curls.
“Have to make sure they’re good enough to share with people,” Harry said seriously, running his hands down Draco’s back.
“Please.” Draco allowed her to tip the potion into his mouth, and immediately felt himself begin to fade. He vaguely heard Goyle say something about meeting them at the hospital and saw Luna summon and speak to a silvery hare that he thought must be her Patronus just before slipping into blissful unconsciousness.
“Conceding?” Draco asked. His boat had drifted in a circle and he was pointed in the wrong direction, but seemed only halfhearted in his efforts to get himself turned back around.
There were two bedrooms with two twin beds each on the ground floor and three doubles on the upper, one of which was definitely a Master Suite.
“She told me to tell you this.” Leaning in even nearer, Draco stopped with his lips just millimeters from Harry’s ear. “Scared, Potter?”
“I told you I was going to,” Draco said dismissively before wandering, naked, back into the living room to retrieve the bottle.
Once the cameras were off and the crew had disbursed, Pansy and Draco settled in. Draco was uncharacteristically quiet. Harry hoped he wasn’t still mad about the hot tub incident.
As if on cue, Luna reached up and slid one more button loose on his shirt before patting him on the chest. “There you go. Much more in character.” She wore a short skirt, a jacket, and a cross necklace, and a wooden stake stuck out of her pocket. Harry flushed, feeling a bit exposed, but didn’t rebutton it.
“Alright,” Harry exhaled. He downed his margarita for courage, setting the glass aside. “Here goes nothing.” Standing, he took a few steps back before launching himself forward into the water with a large
Draco sighed. This was beyond his control, and he knew it. He made a mental note to put safety charms on all the kitchen knives, just in case.
Harry had trouble keeping himself from looking completely miserable at the elimination ceremony. He said goodbye to an unsurprised and contrite-looking Nathalie and an indignant Cormac before retreating to his room, where Blaise was waiting. “Do we have to do this right now?”
He led her inside, explaining along the way what the program was and his own part in it. He and Neville had secured space in a Muggle school that went unused during the summers, and his and Hilde’s footsteps echoed in the empty halls. It was always odd to Harry to think what it would have been like to have stayed in schools like this—with their rows of lockers, ubiquitous green and black tile floors, and bright fluorescent lights—rather than going off to Hogwarts.
“The blue team will get to start the cocktail hour half an hour early,” Harry answered, “so they’ll get a bit of bonus time with me. Which isn’t much of a prize in my book, but you’re all here, so I suppose it can’t be that bad?” There was more laughter, although some of the red team’s players were now scowling at William. “For now, let’s all head back to the house to clean up and get some food. I’ll see you all this evening!”
“What about the power going out at the club right when Sullivan kissed you, then? And yes, I was watching, and no, I really didn’t want to admit that, but you are extremely hard to get through to so I’m willing to humiliate myself a bit. More. Merlin.”
Nancy called everyone up to the front, where she demonstrated each step of the recipe for them, explaining as she went. “Now, it’s very important that you use the correct amount of baking powder. Too little, and your muffins won’t rise. Too much, and not only will your flavors be off, but you may have unpredictable results like an odd rise or too fast of a browning time. Baking is like chemistry: if your measurements aren’t precise and your techniques aren’t correct, you might be fine, but you can also end up with an awful mess—and potentially a poison.” She winked. Perry looked taken aback, and Harry touched his arm to get his attention, shaking his head slightly with a small smile. Perry seemed to understand what he was saying and relaxed.
“I’m still a little creeped out that she had cameras in my bedroom, though,” Harry said. “Feels like a bit of a violation of privacy.”
“I’d never been on one before I finished school,” Harry confessed. “The closest I came was the Gringotts carts. But I still love them; it’s a different sort of adrenaline rush than flying, you know? Being completely out of control of the situation, even though you know you’re completely safe.”
They all traipsed out onto the huge, luxurious, multi-tiered patio, where the omnipresent champagne table had been set up near a terraced garden. As they stood, the lights atop the tall, ornate lamp posts dimmed and then went out, leaving them in almost perfect darkness. Harry waited in anticipatory silence for his eyes to adjust. Before he could fully make out the silhouettes of the people around him, a burst of light filled the night sky.
“Your sexual orientation doesn’t prevent you from having children,” Narcissa went on. “Many couples use surrogacy or adoption, you know.” Draco felt his eyebrows rising and tried to school his expression. His mother’s viewpoints on propagation of the bloodline had certainly evolved since he’d been gone. “Societally, things aren’t as they were when you were younger,” she continued, either missing or ignoring his reaction. “The Wizangamot voted in favor of allowing same-sex marriages several years ago. Even the Muggles here have legalized homosexual partnerships to some extent. You could easily find a husband and have a child through less traditional means. It’s not as though I’m asking you to go against your inclinations.”
Draco had skated regularly in his youth, and although he hadn’t been in a few years, he found that it came back to him easily. He drifted around the edges of the rink, watching the other skaters go by. There were a few couples holding hands, a group of teens chasing each other around and laughing uproariously, and several adults chaperoning younger children. One of the couples, a man and a woman who looked to be well into their eighties, if not older, were engaged in a routine full of twirls and spins that Draco would have been impressed by even in people a fraction of their age. He watched them for a few moments before gliding past to catch up with Teddy and Harry.
“Nothing! So, what should we do with the next—” she looked at her watch and groaned, “—fourteen or so hours?”
When the pool party came to a close at the direction of a suddenly-visible Pansy Parkinson, they all headed inside to change and prepare for the eliminations. Once Harry was suited up again, this time in a deep navy, Blaise joined him for a short interview before they went downstairs.
Trying not to move too much, Draco summoned the remote control and switched the television off. Harry looked soft, and young, and Draco could think of nothing he wanted less than to disturb him. He checked the time; it was just after nine, so he didn’t think it would throw Harry’s schedule off at this point if he slept through the night. He contemplated just tucking him in on the sofa, but he thought that Harry would probably wake when he shifted him anyway, so reluctantly, he tried to rouse him enough to get him to his bed.
“Oh, I found her in the woods on Monday. She’d injured her leg, and I patched her right up. She’s been a lovely guide while I’ve explored.”
or anything. It was just that the git drove him mad, what with his whole… everything. That was all. And Harry didn’t appreciate him stealing their costume idea.
Malfoy spends the night sometimes, when he’s too drunk to get home or when he pretends he is because he can’t stand the thought of going back to the Manor. I never call him on it. This house has too many rooms, anyway, so it’s no big deal, and it’s kind of nice to have someone around in the mornings.
With a sigh, he resigned himself to another night of fantasies and frustration. At least he now had that ‘sir’ echoing in his mind; if nothing else, it would add a new twist to his imaginings.
The ceremony was short and sweet. Blaise started it off by giving a pretty speech about how love sometimes finds us in the most unexpected places before Harry called the couple up to hug them both and wish them luck. Rather than the rushed exits of the past eliminations, they were allowed to stay for a few minutes so that everyone could raise a toast to their future and they could say goodbye to their friends.
“Right. So I was there, sharing it with  Ron and Hermione, but they moved into their own place after they got married and Hermione got pregnant and it was just… way too big, on my own. So I started staying here more and more, and when Andromeda and Narcissa bought their house, I decided to make it permanent.”
Tonight, on the climactic season finale of The Bachelor: Magical Edition! Three contestants, three overnight dates, three extremely telling conversations, one epiphany, and one shocking twist! Tune in next week for a very special episode asking: where are they now?
Perry smiled again, this time a fond little thing. “Very much. I hope to have some of my own, one day. You?”
“—okay.” Harry’s brain was still sorting out her rush of words, but she seemed so panicked that he went into crisis management mode. “Breathe.”
Draco squeezed back, and when Harry glanced at him, he was blushing slightly, but looked extremely pleased with himself. “I’d say so.”
While they ate, Pansy and Ginny flipped through the pages of the house guide, pointing things out to each other. Ginny had all but wrestled the book from Hermione when she realized that she was poised to monopolize it for the rest of the evening. “Ooh look, there’s instructions for the hot tub,” Ginny said. “Let’s do that after dinner.”
Back in line, Hermione pulled her glasses off, rubbing them with a handkerchief before perching them back on her nose, giving Harry and Luna a faux-disapproving look. She was clad all in tweed, her Giles costume perfect right down to the omnipresent green mug of tea. “If we could return to the matter at hand?”
Her cheeks were slightly pink when she pulled back, and she looked both pleased and vaguely embarrassed. “Well, I have always wished to know you a bit better,” she told him, “and this seemed a good opportunity. You are quite handsome and have always been very kind to me.” Her accent was still heavy; she rarely came to England, he knew—maybe once or twice a year to see her sister and niece. It had a pleasant lilt to it and reminded Harry of how Fleur had sounded when she first arrived at Hogwarts.
“Let me check my busy schedule,” Draco deadpanned, trying to maintain some semblance of his usual attitude rather than coming off like a pining schoolboy. “Yes, I’m free,” he added with mild exasperation when Harry looked a bit unsure. Honestly.
His suspicions were quickly confirmed. “Mmm, it’s a bit of a Hogwarts alumni tradition. Mostly our year, but a few others come from time to time. It’s grown over time.”
“Mmm. Yes, that was rather wasteful of us,” Draco agreed, biting his lip thoughtfully. “We’ll just have to make sure to make up for lost time, I suppose.”
Harry really did try, as he ate his breakfast, to visualize what his life would look like with each of his remaining potential partners, but it was a much harder exercise that he’d anticipated. He could sort of
“I…” She looked close to tears. “It’s just… journalism is pretty difficult to get into, you know?” Perry had also released her by now, and she wrapped her arms around herself. “Rita told me that, if I got her exclusive details on the show before it aired, she’d let me do a guest column.”
’ at Draco, looking around to make sure Creevey was out of earshot. Draco rolled his eyes. “Come on, Potter. It’s only one night. What do you have to lose?”
“I know,” they answered, sounding amused as they gave him a firm handshake. “You can call me Jack.” Their voice was smooth and low and immediately sent Harry’s mind to very dirty places. He could not for the life of him place whether they were a man, woman, or something else entirely, and he found that he couldn’t be less bothered if he tried. There was something about them that was almost devastatingly compelling.
Draco nodded, leaning up to bite Harry’s earlobe before murmuring “Fast and hard. You’ve teased enough for one night.”
Harry opened his mouth to respond, but Draco got there first. “It’s entirely alright,” he told her, “Harry’s family comes first. I wouldn’t have wanted him to leave you in the lurch.”
Two o’clock rolled around. Harry had started pacing a while back just for something to do. There was another
Harry stepped between his legs where they hung off the bed, and Draco propped himself up on one elbow, reaching out his other arm to catch the front of Harry’s shirt and pull him down into a kiss. Harry leant over Draco, bracing himself on his palms as he kissed him back, deep and urgent. Bracing one knee on the mattress, he righted himself and started undoing the buttons down the front of Draco’s shirt one by one, finally sliding it over his shoulders, baring his chest to the cool air. Draco levered himself up and pulled it from his arms, tossing it aside before sliding his hands up under Harry’s jumper and t-shirt, caressing hot skin over firm muscle. He pushed the fabric up far enough that he could kiss Harry’s stomach and chest, and Harry shivered before reaching behind himself to pull both jumper and tee over his head in one swift movement. His glasses went with them, and Draco laughed a little against his skin, glancing up.
Back up in his room, Harry waited while Blaise settled in and the crew set up. It felt a bit weird to be doing this so early in the day, and it was leaving him a bit off kilter. Finally, the main camerawoman gave Blaise a signal and he flipped on his sunshiny smile.
Harry attempted to stand, a little shakily at first, but he felt steady enough once he was fully upright. “Yeah, I think so. How did you know to look for me out here, anyway?”
Draco touched his arm. “We’ll put a cushioning charm on his coat, okay?” he murmured so that only Harry could hear. “Just in case.” Harry gave him a thankful smile.
. It was just that the hand on his neck wasn’t quite the right shape or size, maybe, and Perry’s smell was
Draco was already through the Floo when he realized that he’d referred to his mother’s house as ‘home.’ Rather than panicking about it, he filed it away with the other factors he was planning to take into account as he considered his looming life decision.
“Yes. Well. Thank you.” Draco was frustrated to find that he couldn’t muster a more eloquent response. Maybe it was the alcohol? It certainly couldn’t be the physical contact or the surprisingly conscientious concern, he tried to tell himself.
“Oh good.” Draco’s relief was visible. “I didn’t actually have a backup plan, so I would’ve had to get very creative if you’d decided against it.”
After graduating from Hogwarts, Harry had made the decision to move to Muggle London. He hadn’t cut himself off from the Wizarding world—not in the least—he’d just wanted a bit of privacy after everything. Being able to lose himself in the bustle of millions of people who didn’t care about him one way or the other had been a breath of fresh air after having his every move scrutinized for upwards of eight years. He’d also had a strong urge to do all of the things he hadn’t been allowed to as a child: go to movies and restaurants and the beach. Read books and listen to music. Eat whatever he wanted, whenever he wanted. Play computer games.
“Ah, good.” Lucius had glanced only briefly at Draco before returning his attention to the paper. “I was about to send an elf for you. Thaddeus and I reached an agreement on the betrothal last night; it will be announced at the game today.”
“Should I stop, then?” Harry bit again, sucking lightly, his thumbs brushing at Draco’s hip bones, making him wish desperately that he hadn’t gone for a shirt that tucked in so that he could feel Harry’s skin against his.
Draco’s parents continued to press for an engagement to Astoria Greengrass, meaning that he was obligated to spend an evening with her every so often to appease them. Harry’s friends had, now that some time had passed since his breakup, begun trying to set him up, and he found that he could only say ‘no’ so often before they started to get suspicious.
Afterward, they sat side by side on the floor, naked and breathing heavily. “I really, really do not want to walk downstairs past Narcissa and Andromeda,” Harry admitted.
, exactly. Mildly disappointed, maybe, but accepting. But there was something there, Draco thought, lingering behind his eyes. He mentally shook the thought off; Harry knew just as well as he did that they’d had an expiration date before this had even begun. He watched as Harry bit into a slice of toast, chewed, and swallowed before saying, “Guess I’d better make the most of the days we’ve got, then. What have you got up today?”
“Please?” she’d wheedled, looking at him with big, brown puppy eyes that had gotten him into trouble many times. “It would be so good for Pansy’s career. You know she’s been trying for a promotion, but her boss is a condescending prick. Launching a programme like this would make her a shoe-in.”
“Please, sit.” She settled behind her desk and indicated two stylish leather chairs across from her. Draco eased himself into one, coffee still in hand, and crossed one leg over the other. “Calpurnius told me you would be in the country. I suspect that he knew you'd show up here sooner or later. How is your trip going?”
“Well. That’s all done, now, I suppose. I’m going to let Ron know you’re back.” She unfolded herself from the sofa, setting her tea and book on the coffee table before rising. Instead of leaving the room, however, she walked over to him and enfolded him in a hug. “Are you okay?” she asked softly.
Harry chuckled wryly. “We do seem to land ourselves on opposite sides pretty consistently, don’t we?”
“This okay?” Harry asked, glancing up, his mouth mere inches from where Draco’s cock was straining at his clothes.
Harry let his arms drop and sighed, stepping back. Running a hand through his more-than-usually messy hair, he grimaced. “Not really. I just… lost my temper.”
Love is a rollercoaster. Sometimes literally. Featuring a trip to a theme park, Draco having strong opinions on color theory, and the non-sexual kind of water sports.
Luna sipped at her drink thoughtfully, setting her cup carefully down in its saucer before offering, “I think that would be rather a waste, don’t you?” Draco gave a resigned little shrug, and she reached across the table to take one of his hands. “It seems to me that what you really need are two things: a secure way to communicate and a safe place to go together.”
“Well don’t worry, we won’t keep you in anticipation for too long! The first contestants are just pulling up now.” Blaise pointed down the long drive to where two old fashioned-looking limousines were slowly making their way toward the house. Harry felt his heart stutter but did his best to appear calm. They were just people. It would be fine.
Harry shivered, immediately beset by the rather compelling mental picture of Draco thrusting into him. “Yeah no that’s, uh— that’s good. I like that suggestion.”
“I believe so. Andromeda sent him upstairs to get dressed an hour ago. Although, he’s been worryingly quiet since then, now that I think on it. Draco, dear, would you mind going up to check on your cousin?”
“What, exactly, happened?” Draco asked. “Luna just said that you and Smith fought. I assume there was a good reason.”
“Right. Well. Thank you.” Draco was frozen in place, obviously just as disconcerted as Harry. Something about the look on his face snapped Harry out of his stupor, and he shook his head, clearing it.
Harry cracked a tired half smile, leaning his head back to rest against the back of the sofa and closing his eyes. “I’m more trouble than I’m worth, unfortunately. When I was helping George before, I was almost completely behind-the-scenes. It’s stupid, but I still draw a lot of attention, which isn’t great when the store’s already packed with holiday shoppers.”
He was half sure that Harry would pull away from his touch, but he didn’t. If anything, he seemed almost to relax into it. “I’m okay,” he said, and it wasn’t convincing, but Draco didn’t want to push it. “Thanks, though.” He reached up and gripped Draco’s hand where it lay on his shoulder, so briefly that his hand was gone before Draco could even fully register it, and then stepped back, continuing on his way.
of feelings about philanthropy and taxes, at least within the US, most of which come down to “these deductions are an important incentive to get rich people to do good things with their money but why can’t they just pay fucking taxes” and “the government should be doing a large chunk of what charities are doing (providing healthcare, feeding and housing the homeless, supporting the arts, providing disaster relief, fixing inequitable education systems, etc.) anyway.” Like, they won’t, because this country is pretty shit and they’d rather support tax evasion and spend the money they do have on continuing to build the world’s largest arsenal, but they SHOULD. (...uh… happy holidays?)
“Um, not really, I guess. We have a lot of friends in common, so we end up at the same things a lot, but I actually don’t think we’d ever hung out just the two of us before.”
“Might’ve done. Do you like it? I thought you should have a picture with your family; something to take back with you. Something tangible.”
The next contestant to enter was the polar opposite of Dermot, physically: a short, curvy blond with huge blue eyes and a bubbly energy that Harry also liked immediately who introduced herself as Hilde.
“You like it when I misbehave.” George wiggled his eyebrows but let Pansy go, sauntering off toward the bar.
Harry laughs. “I dunno. My stuff is all back at my flat anyway, so it’s not like I lost anything important. Maybe this is better. We probably would’ve been miserable here, anyway.”
“Oh, lots of things. Some of it’s just basic lifestyle stuff—where they want to live, whether they want kids, what they want out of a long term partner, that sort of thing. But I also need to know if their core beliefs align with mine.” Harry had workshopped that line with Hermione before the show even started, and he was grateful for it, because he was sure that he would have been floundering by now, otherwise.
Harry couldn’t stop grinning. He waved across the room to Jessica, one of the full-time staff who seemed to be in charge today. She waved back with an amused smile before returning to helping one of the younger boys separate what appeared to be some stubbornly stuck Legos. Standing back up, Harry turned to Hilde, who looked overwhelmed and lost.
Draco allowed himself to be pulled into the shop and down an aisle; Teddy had obviously been here many times and knew exactly where Harry’s crafts were shelved. They rounded a corner, and Draco came face to face with a tall, thin tree covered in delicately carved animals, slithering and climbing and flitting about within its branches. A snake with carefully articulated scales curled itself around the trunk, flickering its tiny wooden tongue from time to time. Draco noted several dragons similar to the ones that Teddy kept in his room. He carefully stroked the neck of a little owl, which fluffed its miniscule carved feathers under his touch and turned its head to look at him.
Harry bit his lip and thought. He was fairly certain that the house guide had mentioned an apothecary hidden from Muggle eyes at the back of the nearby convenience store. “Will you be alright if I pop out for a few minutes?”
“Oh, right.” Draco almost thought that Harry looked disappointed for a moment, but on second glance, his expression was clear and friendly. “Thanks for the tip. I’ll see if he’s free. Have a great weekend, Draco. Parvati.” He knocked his knuckles against the desktop twice before straightening and walking off, hands in pockets. Draco watched him go, sighing as he rounded the corner. It really was a pleasure watching him walk away.
“So, tell me about yourself, Nathalie! I don’t know anything about almost anyone other than your names at this point. What do you do? What made you want to come on the show?”
Greg dumped the contents of the bag in the middle of the clearing, letting everyone scramble for their own food rather than trying to hand everything out himself. Harry waited for the initial rush to die down before grabbing himself a roast beef sandwich and some sort of peanut butter granola bar. He had just unwrapped his sandwich and was in the process of taking a bite when a loud rustling nearby caught his attention.
“Yes, well. Just… be more careful, please. And go eat something so that you don’t pass out and fuck up the filming schedule.”
This assumption was proven true as soon as the game got underway. About half of the players seemed to have no idea what they were doing. Owen had been assigned as a Beater, if the bat in his hand was any indication, but he kept trying to catch the Quaffle. Gabrielle was making a valiant effort at Chasing, but kept forgetting which hoops she was supposed to be aiming for. Hilde ducked the Quaffle as though it was a Bludger whenever it came near her; Jack’s role was entirely unclear, since they were simply standing to one side looking vaguely amused; and William, who was apparently the red team’s Keeper, was stubbornly refusing to block any shot that wasn’t within easy arm’s reach.
“I’m predictably impulsive,” Harry answered, feeling slightly sheepish. “Honestly, I realized how weird this was right before I saw you and almost turned around. I can still leave, if you want.”
“Gladly.” Grabbing his wand once more, Harry cast a quick charm over them both, drying most of the sweat that coated their bodies. It wasn’t enough to remove the sticky aftermath of their lovemaking, but it did, at least, dispel the clammy feeling of sweat and spunk cooling in the evening air. He turned, curling against Draco’s side just to feel the warmth of his skin again. “I kind of can’t believe this is happening right now,” he admitted, his head resting against Draco’s chest. “I honestly didn’t think it ever would.”
K&C now had offices on six continents, and London was only one of several European locations. Although Draco was annoyed that he’d had to make a trip in, he’d felt a sense of relief wash over him as he’d entered the tall glass building and taken the elevator up to the thirteenth floor. This was his comfort zone: sleekly designed offices and top-of-the-line technology paired with soaring magical memos and finely pressed parchment. The receptionist had quickly set him up in a guest office, and now here he was, quite a few hours later, realizing that although he generally loved his job, attempting to catch up on three weeks of work in one afternoon might not have been his best plan.
He’d just decided that the water temperature was acceptable and stepped into the shower when Harry joined him, wrapping his arms around him from behind. “So what’s so special about this shampoo?” he asked, sounding genuinely curious.
They bobbed in place for a while in companionable silence, steering only to keep themselves from drifting too far off course. When Harry felt that he’d let his muscles rest for long enough, he rolled his shoulders and back and pointed himself toward the shore once more. “Okay. Let’s go.”
“Excuse you, that was a gift,” Harry said, trying to keep a straight face as he looked over at the ratty tartan horror.
“Shit! Sorry. I didn’t hear you.” He righted the little figure and stood, pushing his glasses up slightly and wiping his face quickly and self consciously with his sleeve. As Draco moved closer, he could see that his eyes were red-rimmed.
“Oh, yeah, Leela and I are quite close. Perry, too. Like I’ve said before, there’s not much for us to do, so we end up spending a lot of time together.”
“Yeah. Yeah, just a little maudlin, don’t worry about it. Too much wine, probably.” He lifted his mug in a mock toast. “I should go get some food to even it out. I don’t think those gingerbread men are gone yet.” He gave Draco a forced-looking smile and turned to walk away. “See you in the morning,” he threw over his shoulder.
Harry didn’t know if his laugh was amusement or relief or just unbearable joy. Probably all three. He rolled so that he was poised over Draco. “Good to know,” he said, and leaned down to kiss him again.
Eventually, Harry mustered enough energy to sit up, and he and Sullivan scooted to the edge of the dock to dangle their feet in the water as the sun went down. Sullivan had once again wrapped an arm around him as though it was the most natural thing in the world, and Harry couldn’t help but lean into it. Sullivan was magnetic, he thought—kind and cheerful and easy-going—and the way his larger body fit against Harry’s made him feel safe. Plus, he was bloody gorgeous.
“I didn’t mean anything by it,” Draco said, feeling unfairly chastened. “I spent time with some of them the other night at the Three Broomsticks, and it was perfectly fine.” He thought back on George draping himself over Pansy and cringed. “Mostly.”
Draco let out a puff of air. “Oh, thank fuck. Get in here.” He stepped back, allowing Harry entrance.
Harry smiled and lowered himself to the ground, mirroring Perry’s position. “Enjoying yourself so far?” he asked, unsure how else to start.
Harry’s eyes went wide as he looked up and down the path. “We just Apparated into the middle of a massive Muggle tourist attraction?! Are you mental?”
And when I really stop to think about it, I think… I think he never really meant to leave me this house. I don’t know why I never realized that. Like, yeah, he made me his heir, but it wasn’t about the house. It was about…” The smile falters. “It was about family.”
“Like, you make perfume?” Harry asked, and Gabrielle nodded. “Huh! I never really thought about the fact that that was a job someone could have. How did you end up doing that?”
Over the following weeks, it became clear that “keeping it quiet” was going to be more complicated than either Draco or Harry had anticipated. They had exchanged a few owls at first, but when Harry told Draco that Ron and Hermione were getting a bit nosy about who he was talking to, he’d had to agree that they should do so only when necessary. He knew that Granger was far too astute to miss the fact that all of Harry’s letters were being delivered by the same owl.
“I brought gifts with me from New York,” Draco told him. “A scarf for my mother and a book for your Gran. And I’m not telling you what I brought you, so don’t even ask,” he added.
“I understand that one of our producers, Draco, stepped in to keep you company once it was clear that Jack wasn’t going to be found. How was that?”
He barely gave Harry time to murmur the charm and drop his wand before he was pushing him against a wall and kissing him like he was drowning and Harry was air. Harry groaned into his mouth and sank his fingers into his hair, kissing him hard before pulling back slightly. “Being around you all night and not being able to do this was fucking torture,” he said accusitorily.
Took them long enough. Anyway, we’re halfway through and it’s looking like we’re gonna end up at 30-35K total? We shall see!
Draco smirked down at him. Leaning down until their lips were brushing, he pitched his voice low. “Pick someplace that’s only suited for two.”
Harry clapped, and was surprised to hear the rest of the room doing so, as well. It seemed that Dermot’s performance had drawn everyone else’s attention as much as it had Harry’s.
, Draco, why do you think?” Draco didn’t answer. Harry hadn’t expected him to. “You don’t know what it’s like to watch someone you—  Every week, it’s someone new. And it never stops hurting.”
Jack’s drawing was mostly hazy and grey—soft swathes of shadow that Jack told him was vine charcoal. It didn’t include Harry’s whole body; rather, it was focused largely on his chest, the angle from which Jack had been sitting apparently giving them a mostly unimpeded view. The strongest lines of the piece were in stark white chalk against the grey: a meticulous mapping of his scars—both the oval left by the Horcrux locket and the spreading lightning of the killing curse. It was, overall, eerie, and Harry couldn’t decide whether he wanted to stare at it for hours or get away from it as quickly as possible. He opted for the latter, trying to slow himself enough to not show his discomfort, and moved on to Leela’s canvas.
I still see my other friends, of course, but Malfoy is the only one I don’t feel like I have to fake it with. Everyone else gets so worried when I’m broody and in my own head, so I try to smile and joke and act like I’m fine even when I’m not. It’s not like they ask me to; they’d be horrified if they knew. But everyone has so much of their own shit going on, I don’t want any of them to feel like they have to take care of me. Because I’m fine, really—most of the time.
On Monday, he woke up to an owl pecking insistently at his window. Grumbling at the hour, he let it in, his irritation quickly dissipating when he realized the owl was from Harry.
Harry breathed out a sigh of relief and then turned to Draco, chest still heaving with exertion. Draco couldn’t help the grin that spread across his face even as he tried to catch his breath. He could feel sweat tracking down his face, his neck, his back, and he was streaked with dirt and—he suspected—blood; but they had
As it turned out, he didn’t need to. When he opened his door, Draco was sitting cross-legged by the puzzle, turning a single piece over and over, not really looking at it. The rest of it was done, the subtle gradient of blue sky spreading seamlessly across the floor. Draco looked up at the sound of the door and almost dropped the piece, swearing and scrambling to his feet. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to— you weren’t supposed to be back until—” He stared at Harry, a flush of pink spreading across his cheeks. “What are you
“Right. Okay. I—” Harry rubbed his eyes under his glasses, unable to face even the stars. “I think I’m in love with you,” he mumbled, finally. He heard a sharp intake of breath, but Draco didn’t immediately spring up and bolt, so he soldiered on, his voice stronger now that it was out there and couldn’t be taken back. “I think I’ve been in love with you for a really long time. And I’m fucking terrified that by saying it out loud, I’m ruining everything.”
As much as he would have liked to, Draco couldn’t deny that they were, in fact, feelings. Feelings beyond lust and beyond the fondness of friendship. He didn’t think it was love, at least not in the sense that people always talked about—fireworks and fairytales and forever. It felt too soon for that, too new. But it was definitely
“I’m sorry.” Harry reached out a tentative hand, touching Draco’s shoulder carefully. “I didn’t know.” Draco let out a shaky breath before looking up and meeting his gaze.
Hermione coughed. “I’m sure we can each let Blaise borrow a few things from us. Harry, there’s laundry here, right?”
know about that? I’d kind of hoped that the rivalries of younger students flew under the radar of the higher years.”
“What can I say, I know how to play to my strengths,” Draco answered, unembarrassed. “But yes, aside from that.”
And that did it. Something in Harry finally snapped, and his vision went red around the edges. Without even realizing what he was doing until it was over, he wheeled around in a tight 180-degree turn and punched Zacharias square in his stupid, smug face.
It was soft—just a press of lips, nothing profound—but Harry immediately felt something inside of him unfurling, like a piece of himself had been wrapped up tightly in twine and had finally been cut free.
After resting for a while, they eventually collected their kayaks and Apparated back to the boathouse before heading back to the main house to clean up and recover. Harry took a long, hot shower before spreading a salve on his stinging hands and flopping onto his bed for a nap. He was going to miss naps, he thought, as he felt himself drift off. He should plan more naps in his daily life once they got back.
Harry smiled fondly. He loved when Draco was like this, casually affectionate. He’d been worried that their multiple unfortunate encounters the day before would put a stop to it, at least for awhile; the fact that they hadn’t, he thought, was probably a testament to the strength of the friendship they’d built over the years. He was immensely grateful for it. He gave in to his earlier instinct and ran a hand through Draco’s uncharacteristically messy hair, making him hum in sleepy contentment. Picking up his mug and a mystery novel that someone had left on the end table, he settled in and began to read.
“He is,” Draco agreed. “Did you move to Hogsmeade to be nearer to him? I think Andromeda might have said something along those lines.”
“It’s already been arranged, dear. It would be rude to back out now. You may disagree with your father’s tactics, but Astoria has done nothing wrong and does not deserve to be embarrassed by your refusing to accompany her.”
Draco laughed. “You’re not wrong. Alright, fuck it. Give me a minute to go and let her know, and then we can proceed to drowning our sorrows.”
It was unclear what, exactly, happened at that point. All Harry knew was that one second, Cormac was closing the distance between them again, and the next, his foot had shot out from under him and, somehow, his flailing had propelled him right over the side and into the water.
He was surprised when he heard Luna call for a break, but when he moved to stretch his limbs, he realized that his feet were numb and tingly, and his back cracked alarmingly. He stood, wrapping the robe back around himself before jumping around a bit to get his blood flowing.
“Yes, that. Since then, I’ve largely stuck with things you’ve either done or expressed interest in doing, but this was a bit of a wild card, so I thought it best to check your comfort level.”
“Oh!” Harry said as they waited for their server to bring them more wine and injera, distracting Draco from a deep contemplation of Harry’s neck and how it would look with a line of love bites down it. “I meant to tell you! I finally got Ron to tell me about that conversation that neither of us remember from last week.”
“Thank you very much!” She looked down at his name tag. “Harry. I’m sure yours will be just as good.”
Once she was set, Harry led her around the room with him, stopping to exclaim over the painting one of the kids had wanted to show him, letting another child tell him a story about how his doll had needed to go to the hospital, and promising a small group that he would read to them the next time he was in.
As what Pansy was saying sunk in, Harry felt himself pale. If ‘everyone’ thought that they should leave it alone, that meant that they all
“Well.” Narcissa’s strained voice broke the awkward quiet that was filling the room now that Harry seemed to be at a loss for words. “I suppose that… explains a few things.”
Harry’s eyes flashed with heat and he immediately pushed forward with one finger, driving it inexorably into Draco’s body and making him groan. He only pumped it in and out a few times before adding another, making Draco curse. Despite the mood of the encounter so far, Harry leaned forward to kiss him gently. “You good?”
—while Greg seemed mildly confused by his Captain’s fury. “Well, obviously. They’ve been obsessed with each other since we were eleven, and we all saw them at the gala, right?”
Harry did, both apprehensive and curious to see what everyone saw when they looked at him. A quick loop convinced him that he needn’t have worried. The collection of works in front of him were eclectic, ranging from careful pencil studies to wild, brightly painted canvases, but they all had one thing in common: not one of them remotely resembled him.
Jack, unsurprisingly, was wearing the same thing they always did, and, also unsurprisingly, it still left Harry tongue tied.
“It’s fine,” Harry told her. It wasn’t, really; he’d been looking forward to this ever since Draco and Pansy had told him about it. But he could see why it might be uncomfortable to be dropped into with no warning.
“You don’t have to come if you don’t want to, you know. I do actually have enough friends to fill a cabin—”
Luna wandered around helping everyone set up their paper and charcoal before returning to the front of the room. “Now, Harry, we’re going to do a series of gesture drawings, and then a couple of five minute poses, and then we’ll get into a final hour-long session so that everyone can make a more complete piece. Does that sound alright?”
apparently still sound asleep. Draco Malfoy was in his bed, on top of him, sound asleep, and Harry was semi-hard and also
“And don’t even get me started on Ron. As if that oaf could have climbed so high up in the Ministry without being best friends with ‘The Chosen One.’ He’s barely capable enough to serve as a clerk!”
Draco could barely form a coherent thought at the sudden onslaught of heat and wet and pressure, but it only lasted for a few moments before Harry pulled off and lifted Draco’s legs higher so that his knees nearly met his shoulders. Draco adjusted his grip to hold the new position, unable to do anything beyond following Harry’s whims. He peered down his torso, watching as Harry stepped back slightly to observe him.
Harry and Greg decided to put together a stew to let simmer until dinner, while Ron and Draco dug out a chess set and Hermione, Blaise, and Luna opted to try out the dart board. Pansy and Ginny retreated once more to their bedroom, Draco yelling after them to “remember a fucking silencing charm, you shameless bints,” causing Ginny to flip two fingers at him without turning while Pansy gave hime a salacious wink and a smirk.
They’d spent some time in the hot tub again the night before, blissfully easing the tension out of their tired muscles, before turning in fairly early. Draco had not joined Harry in his bed again, a fact for which Harry could not decide whether to be relieved or disappointed.
“Well you can bloody well tell them to burn the thing, because it’s NOT HAPPENING!” Draco was yelling now, gripping the back of the chair tightly with both hands, and both of his parents were finally giving him their full attention: his mother looking perplexed, his father irritated.
A few things: 1) I know it might feel weird to see Harry hit it off with anyone but Draco, but writing an entire dating show with no redeemable characters or people that he might actually be genuinely interested in would not have been fun for me. 2) On that note, I planned to have Owen and Rose self-eliminate from the get go, because I like them and I want them to have a happy little Hufflepuffian life together. 3) I don’t have a head cast for Sadiyah, but when I was writing her, she sounded like Bill from Doctor Who Series 10.
He brushed his hands off on his jeans before heading inside. As he made his way through the mudroom toward the kitchen, however, Harry found himself yanked into the games room by the neck of his shirt. For a panicked moment, he cursed himself for leaving his wand in his bedroom earlier. When he whipped around, however, it was only to see a rather irritated-looking Pansy with her arms now folded across her chest.
The engagement party had been what did him in. He’d been feeling particularly morose, contemplating the shrinking number of unmarried people left in his group of friends, and had decided that the best way to cope and not put a damper on the gathering was to drink just enough champagne to drown his self pity and focus on being happy for his friends. It had not been one of his better plans, so he’d found himself gravitating to the outer edges of the garden of Parkinson Park, where the party was being held, hoping to at least keep his mood from poisoning anyone else’s. That had been where Molly Weasley found him, and his fate had been decided.
“Oh! Yeah, sure.” Harry turned back to Nathalie. “It was nice talking to you. I’m sure we’ll get more time later.” Nathalie looked slightly put out, but, to her credit, tamped it down quickly and nodded before heading off to chat with someone else.
“Draco,” Harry said, after a long moment of silence, looking up at him. His expression was complicated, as though he were debating something with himself. “I—’ He bit his lip, searching Draco’s eyes. “I really don’t want to make things awkward,” he finally said, “and this was really nice and I don’t want to ruin it but…” He trailed off, glancing down toward the frost-touched sidewalk.
front, and reached mere inches past his arse cheeks. Paired with the tight, bright green jersey, he thought he looked more like an exotic dancer than a referee. “I can’t come out like this,” he called through the closed door, continuing to observe himself in the mirror with horror.
Draco struggled to gather his thoughts. Dominant Harry was much hotter than he would have guessed, and it was very distracting. He hadn’t lied about his flexibility, but his kinkier fantasies involving Harry had mostly veered in the opposite direction. As with many things that had happened with them this past week, it had been a whim that made him egg Harry into turning the tables. His subconscious was a genius, he decided, before another sharp smack reminded him that he’d been asked a question. “A bit of burn is fine,” he collected himself enough to answer, “just be quick.”
To Draco’s pleasure, Pansy, Blaise, and Greg had all joined them, Greg with his girlfriend in tow—although Greg had whispered to him, when she had disappeared for a moment to refill their drinks, that he was hoping she would be his fiancée by tomorrow evening. Draco had given his heartfelt congratulations, pleased beyond measure that his friend—who had had an even more tumultuous childhood than his own, in some ways—had finally found some peace and happiness for himself. When Susan returned and pulled Greg off to see someone else she’d run into, Draco stayed with Blaise and Pansy for a few minutes, enjoying what would probably be the last time he’d get to spend with them for quite awhile, before continuing on his way.
He checked the Weasleys’ first. Molly greeted him with a hug when she opened the door, inviting him in. “I was actually just hoping to borrow Harry for a moment,” Draco told her, smiling. She ushered him inside anyway and closed the door behind him.
. Do you think that just… stops mattering? That eleven years of distance means that we should just get over it?”
Happy to have found a subject that he could discuss without revealing too much of himself or stumbling over any accidental references to their uncomfortable shared history, Draco began to share the stories of some of his more colorful clients. These led to a handful of anecdotes about the odd custom orders Harry had handled over the years, which led to a lively discussion of the pros and cons of magical versus mechanical animation of toys and gadgets.
The next pair were the ones who had forgotten their blueberries, leaving their muffins perfectly cooked but rather bland. “They’d be lovely with a bit of jam,” Nancy told them kindly. Then came the unrisen ones, which were quite dense when sampled. “A bit short on the baking powder,” she observed, “but the taste is good.” The next ones were fine, if a bit underbaked. After that came the ones that were more brown than golden, which were dry and a bit crunchy in a less than pleasant way, but which Nancy was still very polite about. And then, it was Harry and Perry’s turn.
. When he rose, pushing his hair back out of his eyes, Ginny was cracking up once more, and Ron was looking at him, eyes wide with betrayal, hair freshly soaked.
“What the hell do you think you’re doing?” Capulet hissed. “You can’t just go cozying up to Harry Potter!”
“I know you would have,” Harry said, “but it was fine. I wouldn’t have said yes if it was a problem.”
Draco, who had been heading toward the door, turned back to look at him. “Nothing in particular. Why?”
“I guess sort of? It’s pretty strange to have technically gone out with each of these people a bunch of times but to still only know them a little bit. But I’m looking forward to it.”
“Almost certainly Mother,” Draco replied with a smirk. “She loves a touch of dramatic holiday romance. I promise I won’t accost you in front of everyone you know, though, don’t worry.”
“I still can’t believe you stole a fucking dragon.” Ginny settled onto the bench opposite Harry and Draco, crossing her legs and settling her plate across them.
“...Okay.” Harry’s gut churned, and he couldn’t tell whether it was telling him to move forward or to run away.
Harry relaxed a little. Perry’s breath was warm against the side of his face and the pressure against his arm was grounding. Surreptitiously, he cast a slight muffling charm so that they could hear each other better and turned slightly to meet Perry’s eyes. “Yeah, thanks. Just bad memories.”
“Cheers to that,” Ron grinned. “Good riddance to bad rubbish. Ross wasn’t good enough for you, anyway. And, now, I’ll have you around to keep me company at all the public league events, and Hermione can stop pretending that she finds my job remotely interesting!”
To Harry’s relief, once they got underway, the ride was fairly uneventful. He didn’t often drive at home, and even then, it was on the opposite side of the road and not at nearly the speed that Americans seemed to prefer on the highways. Other than Ginny teasing him over his white-knuckled grip on the steering wheel, Pansy’s whinging about leg room, and Blaise’s constant playing with the radio, however, everything went as smoothly as he could have hoped for.
Harry looked skyward. “Ahhh. A while ago, I think? But I can be a little slow on the uptake, sometimes.”
“Well!” Narcissa broke in after a few moments of heavy silence. “I believe we were discussing a party?”
“To answer your unspoken questions, yes, it’s a mix of houses, and no, no one will mind if you come. There’s been a lot of… shall we say, interhouse mingling? Over the years.”
“Yes, sir,” Harry answered with a teasing little salute before Apparating away, and Draco tried very hard not to shiver at the words. Oh, he was in trouble. But maybe not too much trouble, he supposed; dinner at Harry’s flat sounded extremely promising. He doubted that he was misreading the subtext of the invitation.
A series of questioning looks went around the circle, before Hermione gently queried, “Ron, did you happen to…”
effort, would you?” He walked back to the side of the field, shaking his head, and blew the whistle again to restart the game.
Draco had been assigned the task of ensuring that the platters of food on the dining table and the floating trays of canapés never ran low. He was forced to admit, as he refilled tray after tray, that his mother had not overestimated their needs. He was currently between checks, however, and was sipping at some sort of cranberry-champagne cocktail while he observed the guests.
“I’m glad to hear it,” said Blaise, whom they had seen frequently over the past few months and who knew perfectly well how things were going. “And how did you feel watching the show as it aired?”
“And,” Perry cut him off, speaking more loudly, “when you were upset, he was always there to comfort you, right? And before you ask how I know that, remember that whole ‘the crew is more gossipy than Rita Skeeter’ thing.”
Between the odd cadence of the conversation and the unnerving nearness of Jack’s body, Harry quickly found himself in need of more alcohol and excused himself. He wondered if anyone ever got used to Jack. He suspected not.
“A group?” Draco felt the beginnings of alarm bells going off in his head; ‘a group’ sounded like more people than just their small Slytherin cohort.
“Come look at this,” Sullivan said quietly as Harry approached. Stopping next to him, Harry looked down at where Sullivan was pointing and laughed. A truly gigantic toad was sitting on a lily pad, staring balefully up at them. At the sound of Harry’s laughter, it let out an offended croak before turning and jumping to another plant further away from them.
Bidding the professors farewell, Draco went to check on food levels once more before beginning another lap of the rooms. He’d seen Harry in passing several times, but hadn’t managed to spend any time with him yet, constantly getting pulled into other conversations and looking around to find him gone. He had just made it to the living room when Luna Lovegood appeared at his shoulder. “He’s over by the windows,” she told him, uncannily observant as ever. “You may want to rescue him; I always warn him about the nargles, but he never listens.” She waved her hand toward the upper sash of the window, where a sprig of mistletoe was lying in wait.
“Easier said than done,” Harry responded wryly. “Maybe I should have taken them up on that training bar thingy.”
By the time they arrived back in London it was past sunset and, despite the time change, Harry was exhausted. They all gathered their luggage to head their separate ways, Harry and Draco enduring another round of teasing when Draco opted to stick with Harry rather than heading back to his own flat. Finally, however, they stood in the foyer of Number Twelve Grimmauld Place, Harry breathing in the familiar smell of it with a mix of relief and melancholy. After a week away, it felt strange to be returning to the real world.
By Monday, Draco was pleased to be able to say that he had adjusted to being back on Greenwich Mean Time and had, therefore, made it down to breakfast without the help of an overexcited eight-year-old. He spent the first part of the day catching up on some work correspondence that had come in over the weekend, much to his mother’s chagrin. By one, however, he had given in to her insistence that he not work through the entirety of his vacation and joined her in the breakfast room for lunch. He had just finished when the living room floo flared to life and Harry Potter stepped through.
They made their way outside. As he came into view, Harry could hear Blaise Zabini’s smooth voice addressing a group of people operating an array of cameras, lights, microphones, and other equipment that Harry couldn’t quite identify.  His wide, white smile glinted in a way that rivaled Gilderoy Lockhart’s in his heyday, and Harry felt a twinge of jealousy at how natural he looked in his sleek suit. Harry felt like a frumpy child in comparison.
Finally, Harry and Draco were deposited in a bar near the entrance that was obviously designed to hold dozens of people but in which they were entirely alone but for a single bartender. Harry looked to Draco to see what happened now.
I think that maybe that’s why the way I get treated now pisses me off so much. You’d think that once I saved the world, people would let me live my life, you know? But instead, it’s like they think I owe them even more now. Every move is scrutinized, and if I don’t live up to their ideal of what a hero should be, they all look at me like I kicked a fucking puppy. Everyone’s so disappointed that I don’t want to be their poster boy for the rest of my life. It’s pretty bullshit, honestly.
“Okay.” Perry let out a breath and leant in. Harry closed his eyes and waited. Warm, soft lips brushed tentatively against his. He responded, parting his own lips slightly, and Perry moved in closer, kissing him more firmly, sliding a hand behind his neck.
“Are you okay?” Luna asked, stepping forward. Dermot just glared at her. She looked him over speculatively. “Blue is a very nice color on you. It isn’t quite the same shade as our school days, but it looks lovely with your hair.”
been an arsehole, he knew, and he winced a bit internally even as the hot water began to do its job, soothing his tense muscles. He didn’t particularly like playing that role anymore. But the thing was, it was necessary. Every time he tried to let someone down gently, they’d cling to him like a sad, lost puppy, insisting that they could fix whatever was wrong. It just made it harder for everyone involved. This way, they could hate him in peace, and he could keep searching for a relationship that wouldn’t fizzle within the first few months.
Draco felt like he’d been punched in the gut. Potter had said that Severus had been serving Dumbledore, but it had slipped Draco’s mind after everything else that had happened. This made it feel real. Severus truly had been helping Potter, teaching him his own secret spells. Somehow, all that animosity between his godfather and Potter had been an elaborate act. Draco felt something bitter clench in his stomach and had to look away.
Severus was dead. He had not been on their side. He had been a spy for the Order from Draco’s babyhood, in love with Potter’s mother, in love with a
After several long moments, Potter unclenched slightly, and Draco dared to glance at his face. Potter’s jaw was tight and his eyes hard and gleaming.
have to leave now. Except that was utterly pointless - what would he do, go on the run? He had to be at the Manor every new moon, and even if, with Prudy’s help, he managed to stealthily apparate in and out for a few months, eventually some Auror would work out the pattern of the break-ins and set up a very simple ambush. It was only delaying the inevitable.
The Auror kept pace a few steps behind. Draco watched her out of the corner of his eye as he continued his slow progress. The stretch of wall that marked the entrance to the Slytherin common room was coming up, but the Auror didn’t change her attitude. Not a Slytherin, then.
Then Draco realised where he was sitting. Crabbe’s bed. He glanced down to the foot of it and saw Crabbe’s cloak still tossed haphazardly over the covers. For a second a crushing pain
Potter was smiling. “Yeah, cars are death-traps, you wouldn’t believe how many muggles die in crashes every year.” He grinned at Draco’s appalled face. “But if my uncle could get away with driving like a maniac everywhere and never getting hurt then I reckon you have to be pretty unlucky for it to actually happen to you.”
do things to rebuild your life. Which includes finding ways to do things you like to do, like beat me at Quidditch, even with a hole in your leg.”
Draco sat back, stunned. Warmth and shock were mingling in his chest, spreading upwards. He covered his face with his hands.
“Well, congratulations on leaving your comfort zone. I know it isn’t easy. So, if you wouldn’t mind, could you tell me about your injury?”
Draco’s breath caught. It was very rare for his father to say he was proud of him. And never in Draco’s
Shacklebolt nodded. “Those conditions seem eminently reasonable to me, Lord Malfoy, and I am happy to meet them. And if we are therefore in agreement, then I would like to start with the most time-sensitive issue: what you may be able to tell us about where the other Death Eaters are hiding.”
“When I whispered yes, she told everyone I was dead. And so that was when they all paraded back again. She knew it was the only way she’d be able to get back to the castle to get to you.”
“We’ll, er - we’ll leave. Um, for now. I’ll tell the others you’re staying put in Slytherin tonight, right? You’ll stay here?”
“Seriously. But I didn’t expect to be alive right now - even before I knew I had to die, I mean - so I suppose we might have to broaden our view a bit on what’s possible.”
“This whole situation is exceedingly strange, Potter. I never thought we’d see the day when you thanked me.”
He pushed himself up to a sitting position on the floor, his back against the sofa, and hugged his knees close. He felt physically sick. He gulped breaths, desperately trying to settle his stomach and lower his heart-rate. It was the same level of fear that he’d felt during the Fiendfyre the first time; he was absolutely pouring sweat, his magic was crackling wildly in the air around him, and Merlin, but he was terrified.
astounded, given the way Potter had flown through Fiendfyre to save his life only days ago, but there was still no earthly reason for Potter to
“The Path of the Penitent. Like I said, it’s ancient magic. Strong stuff. I have to atone to each of the people I’ve wronged, by doing a task they set for me. You said ‘Explain yourself,’ and apparently that means that I - I can’t lie to you.”
This time, Potter did wait long enough to hold the door open for him, which saved him having to open it using his shoulder. Potter had been telling the truth. The Aurors - one of them the woman who had stood guard over him down in the dungeon cell - looked over, and frowned, but didn’t say anything. Potter levitated Draco’s trunk again from where he’d left it by the Staff Table, and Draco followed him quickly through the Great Hall, the Entrance Hall, and out onto the grounds.
Maybe… maybe Prudy could just apparate him home on the nights of the new moon? He could be back in his cell in less than an hour. It wasn’t too much of a risk, was it? But no, he was being stupid. He had only been shoved in this dungeon underneath Hogwarts as a temporary measure, while everyone finished clearing up after the battle. Hogwarts was warded to the eyries against intruders, but its dungeons resembled nothing more than dingy classrooms. Soon he’d be transferred to await trial in the Ministry cells, or, or in Azkaban, and both of those places had had centuries to close all the loop-holes of a wizarding prison. They would have safeguards against house-elf abilities.
and slid it over the table. Draco easily separated a blob of the same size as before, and then spent a moment thinking about how he looked on a broom.
Draco was trying to catch his breath. His chest seemed to be full of shards and something was bubbling in his throat.
Draco wanted to make a remark about Potter becoming talkative before being drunk too, but he wasn’t stupid enough to interrupt. They just took more sips of their firewhiskey, both looking into the blue flickers of the tiny gas fire.
Potter emerged from the bathroom and sank into one of the mismatched armchairs, looking quite grey in the face.
Potter actually giggled. “I gotta say, it’s weird, but I’m beginning to like it.” He rolled his eyes at Draco’s expression. “Oh, come on. You’ve got to admit it’s sort of funny.”
Draco almost rolled his eyes, and then remembered how it had felt to be clueless and nervous in a tailor’s shop.
Prudy followed him as he worked his way through the trees. She had summoned a small orb of light in front of herself, since for her this place was still a dark cellar. Draco watched bemused as she walked straight through one of the oak trees, but when Draco checked, it was solid and real beneath his hands.
“I know enough, Mr Malfoy. I know this You-Know-Who fellow is essentially your standard wizard Hitler. I suppose he’s dead now?”
“Malfoy,” said McGonagall. He saw her eyes flick to the bandage on his arm, but she made no comment. “I am very glad to see you looking better.” Her voice sounded slightly rougher than usual. Draco was astonished to see that she genuinely meant it. “I cannot even begin to sufficiently apologise for what Peeves did to you. I’ve never heard of him attacking anyone like that.”
Peeves flew down to the pile of rubble, effortlessly hoisted a piece of stone the size of a cauldron up to his shoulder, and threw it at Draco.
Potter shrugged, failing to look nonchalant. “You know how it is. Early inheritance, the perk of losing one’s parental figures before turning twenty.”
Once they both had their plates loaded with a mix of rice and curry, Potter looked up and their eyes caught across the table. Draco realised suddenly that they were about to
People stood silent and staggered up every side of the amphitheatre, with enough space between each person to make it seem as though everyone stood alone. The effect was striking, and eerie. Draco followed Potter and Andromeda as they started down the granite spiral path that wound down into the centre, and then he understood how everyone had arranged themselves into such a perfectly spaced pattern; the path widened every three yards or so into natural, circular plinths, designed for standing on.
After a few, endless minutes, Prudy’s sobs began to subside. Draco brought his right hand up to wipe away a couple of stray tears from his own face and he wasn’t surprised to see Potter do the same. Finally, Prudy stopped crying, but didn’t uncurl from her position as a tight ball of limbs on Draco’s chest.
Potter looked awful. His eyes were red-rimmed and his hair was sticking almost straight up, and his black formal robes were half unbuttoned, revealing a glimpse of a ratty T-shirt underneath. He was holding a large bottle of firewhiskey in one hand, and a crinkly bag of takeaway in the other. Draco’s stomach swooped a little as he remembered where Potter had been today: Fred Weasley’s funeral.
friends, Myrtle. I’m sorry I haven’t been to see you lately - after the Easter holidays, I… well… it was just safer to spend most of the time down in Slytherin.”
Three weeks. By then, he had to somehow have sorted all this out, and be back at home. At least it wasn’t
Its ancient branches, already sagging with age, were sagging even lower, deliberately reaching towards him. Draco watched as the branches formed a protective circle around where he sat, and reached out to touch the branch nearest him, remembering how it had felt when he had been this tree. “Hello,” he said softly.
“Depending on how much consistent effort you put into the exercises, I’m confident we’ll see significant improvement within three or four months.”
“Mr Malfoy, I never thought you were the type to martyr yourself.” Her eyebrows raised over a pointed look. Draco recalled a certain hippogriff incident in third year and squirmed. Her voice was soft as she went on. “You have received a life-changing disability, Mr Malfoy. I have some ways I can help. But you need to tell me the details.”
He leant inside the low door for a moment, and Draco heard another metallic clunk before the man withdrew and stood back politely. Draco was impressed by the man’s easy manners, and he managed to give a stiff nod of acknowledgement as he stepped up to the car.
at dating. And I know there’s nothing wrong with staying single, but, it’s just starting to get a bit lonely at this point, you know?”
Harry grinned at Oliver, whose face bore a fervently enthusiastic expression that made Harry nostalgic for his early Hogwarts days. “Sounds perfect. I really hope this works out.”
“And speaking of Sullivan.” Blaise suddenly looked like the cat who’d got the cream. “That was certainly an interesting development. How do you feel about him making a move last night?”
. Secondly, she was completely addicted to reality shows. And lastly, she was, at her core, still very much a Slytherin—which meant that she was
“But stay for a while, let me get you a drink.” Molly bustled away, and Ron turned to watch her go before turning back to Draco and putting a hand on his shoulder.
Harry looked down at the pristine white trainers and raised an eyebrow. “They’re… trainers. They’re supposed to get dirty. That’s what happens when you play sports.”
“Oh, she did. She told me after, when I confronted her about her unabashed betrayal of my trust. Apparently, she had a contingency plan in place from the moment she talked me into signing on to the production. Duplicitous cow,” he added, but he couldn’t hide the fondness in his voice.
I give you Captain Graham Montague and his team: Benvolio D’Angelo! Sophie Weber! Haley Abram! Balthasar Rosi! Clement Erickson! Aaaand everyone’s favorite celebrity Seeker, the one, the only,
Teddy had apparently given up his mad solo sprint to try to teach Harry to improve his skating. From what Draco could tell, this mostly consisted of him tugging on Harry’s hand and telling him to go faster while Harry tried not to be pulled off his feet. “You have to move your feet more,” he was saying when Draco arrived beside them.
“I won’t let Pansy use that part. We’ll go with the room-breaking-down story and just use footage from the first bit, and then fill the rest in with tonight’s cocktail party.”
Harry groaned as he reciprocated, his actions belying his words as he slid his tongue into Draco’s mouth, urging him onwards. Draco grasped Harry’s hips and then slid his hands back, finally grabbing that arse he’d been deprived of his chance to touch on Saturday. Harry ground forward, seemingly instinctually, and it was Draco’s turn to groan. Harry broke again, panting. “Twenty minutes is not long enough to do all the things I’ve been thinking about doing to you.”
They took their time, kissing and touching as they removed each other’s clothing with care. Draco ran his fingers and lips over each part of Harry he uncovered, memorizing the way his skin felt over lean muscle and protruding bone, tracing freckles and scars with his tongue. Harry ran his fingers through Draco’s hair, tugging lightly and then running his thumbs over his temples, behind his ears, down his neck. When they were both naked, Draco pushed at Harry until he reclined on the mattress and climbed up on top of him, straddling his thighs.
Draco wasn’t entirely sure what was happening or why, but he was absolutely not going to let that get in the way of whatever it was. He kissed Harry back enthusiastically, stopping only when he shifted to get closer and jarred his ribs slightly. “Ow.”
The fire burned on and the conversations continued, light and pleasant and carefree. It had probably been at least an hour, if not longer, when Ginny observed glumly that they’d run out of beer.
“Oh, yeah,” Sullivan answered. “My parents and I left when things started to get a bit out of hand. Didn’t really want to stay around if we could help it, you know?”
“Yeah, of course,” Draco said immediately, and he suddenly felt completely helpless. “Can I—” he hesitated, and then put a tentative hand on Harry’s slumped shoulder. “Do you need anything?”
Andromeda rolled her eyes, and good lord did he hate having his own disdainful expressions used against him. “Well I suggest you figure out what to say and go sort this out, because he is, as you said, here rather a lot, and it’s going to be a hell of a lot more awkward if you keep hiding in your room when he shows up.”
Once he’d snapped out of his shock, Draco scowled and Apparated home, where he had a furious wank before plotting a second date that would knock Harry’s socks off. And also the rest of his clothes, hopefully.
Over dessert, Narcissa and Andromeda’s conversation turned toward the upcoming party—as it tended to do, since party planning was one of the great passions of his mother’s life. Their exchange mostly consisted of Andromeda trying to talk Narcissa down from her more over-the-top ideas. One of the plans that was nixed, much to Draco’s relief, was that of using live fairies. “Enchanted Muggle lights look beautiful,” Andromeda said firmly, “and the fairy unions are a nightmare to deal with.”
The pair watched, skating slowly side by side as the two children raced around the pond, laughing and yelling. Draco tried to enjoy it, but he kept thinking about Teddy’s reaction to his imminent departure. His mood must have been visible as his gaze tracked his cousin, because it wasn’t long before Harry broke the silence.
“Telephone? Flying car? Getting blocked in behind the Floo at Harry’s aunt and uncle’s house? Any of this sound familiar?”
you, makes him happy, for whatever reason. And—” he shrugged, looking sad. “He deserves to be happy. But he doesn’t really… believe that, I don’t think. So, like I said, he’ll never ask you to stay. Even though we know he wants you to. So I just… I thought you should know.” He trailed off, and then grimaced. “Seriously, though, Malfoy, please don’t tell him I told you any of this, because he might actually murder me.”
Leela was a fun partner, swinging Harry around by the hands and shimmying in ways that managed to be both sexy and silly. He was breathless when their song ended, beginning to morph into another, and he pulled her into a hug, spontaneously planting a kiss on her sweaty temple before letting Perry pull him away. As he turned, he could just see a giddy grin splitting her face.
“Gabrielle!” Harry greeted her with a hug and a bemused smile. “It’s been ages. What are you doing here?”
It was too much to think about right now. He wasn’t even sure if Harry would want to keep seeing him if he stayed, or if he had only decided to give it a go because he knew there was no chance of a long-term commitment. He
“Anyone ready to start thinking about dinner?” he asked, dropping the book onto the large dining table—a massive, lacquered slab of wood with uneven sides that appeared to be a vertical slice of a large tree—and flipping it open to the page of restaurants. “I’ve got the list of places nearby that the hosts left.”
“Fair enough.” Harry pulled back and slammed back into him, and Draco’s hands flew to the bed, gripping the sheets for all he was worth as Harry proceeded to fuck him within an inch of his life. It was rough and deep and so
“True, but that’s… mmm.” The end of the sentence got lost in a hum that was nearly a moan, and Harry gently tugged Draco’s head back by his hair, kissing up his neck before nipping at the cord of muscle leading down from behind his ear. “What was I saying?” Draco asked breathily. His fingers dug into Harry’s lower back.
“Fine. Let’s go on a date,” Potter said, as though the conversation had not been interrupted by nearly twenty hours of what Draco had to assume was an epic battle between Potter’s libido and his principles.
He was brought back to reality by his partner smacking him in the back of the head with a stack of paperwork. “Ow! What the fuck, Patil?”
Harry didn’t answer when Draco knocked on his workshop door. Draco waited for a few moments, and when he didn’t hear footsteps, he knocked again. It was still fairly early, but the sun was already down and it had gotten rather cold, so after waiting a while longer and still receiving no response, Draco decided ‘fuck it’ and tried the doorknob, which turned easily.
Harry didn’t have the energy to dissemble. “I mean, it’s nothing new. People have been using me for one thing or another my entire life. I just hoped that wouldn’t be the case here, you know?”
Draco breathed out a plume of smoke and tapped his cigarette against the ashtray on his bedside table. The sweat was still drying on his skin, but he’d already relegated the encounter that had caused it to his mental ‘not worth remembering’ file, where it joined the past several months of this relationship. He sighed internally. Time to admit defeat.
“You still came to sleep in my bed, though,” Harry said, smiling a little, remembering Pansy’s exasperation at that fact.
“I know.” Draco smirked, leaning forward to kiss his neck. “I think you like it.” He moved his attention higher, tracing the tip of his tongue around the curve of Harry’s ear before whispering suggestively, “But if it's a problem, you could always punish me for it.”
“I—” Hilde started and then closed her eyes and took a deep breath. “No, of course not. I was just surprised. Let’s go meet the little angels!” Her smile was very clearly forced, but Harry didn’t really know what to do besides carry on. And besides, he’d really missed these kids.
Harry felt much like he had when the looping rollercoaster they’d ridden a few days back had shot out of the station, shocking his whole body with the force of its acceleration. Struggling to keep up, he put his hands on her shoulders, bracing himself as much as her. “Whoa, slow down! It’s okay.”
“Well, I think I might like to do a bit more hiking,” Hermione said, before biting her lip and adding sheepishly, “well, some walking in the woods, anyway.”
“Are you two going to bicker like an old married couple for the whole drive?” Ron inquired, “Because if so, I’m riding in the other car.”
Harry laughed. “Yeah I mean, it’s all pretty standard. I’ve been asked ‘How are you feeling?’ so many times that I’m about ready to chuck him out a window, even though I know it’s his job. But just, you know, digging into what happened, especially when it’s a bit dramatic, like that whole thing with Nathalie.”
“Have you played?” Malfoy asked casually, making Harry look up. He was glancing sideways from under long lashes, his eyes sparkling mischievously in the dim light.
Draco gave his sore shoulder a tentative rotation. “In one piece, as far as I can tell. Might bruise a bit, but I’m sure there’s a salve of some sort back at the house.”
“Ron’s the only one who isn’t working full time, other than Molly, and she’s with Bill and Fleur right now.” At Draco’s questioning look, he added, “Fleur’s pregnant with their third kid, and she’s too far along to manage the other two without help. Bill’s supposed to be on leave, but there was some emergency, and all the curse breakers got called in.”
Leela grinned. “It has. He and Draco have become regulars at my restaurant—glamoured, obviously—and we’ve managed to see each other a few times outside of that. It’s been a little complicated, what with all the rules around who we can and can’t be seen with in public, but I’m looking forward to kicking his arse in Quidditch now that my friends can take his on openly.”
The class was for beginners, and Harry wasn't sure whether to be insulted or relieved. “I don’t mind at all,” Perry confessed. “I’ve never cooked a thing in my life.”
“Hiya, Harry!” Colin Creevey’s always-chipper voice caught the edge of Draco’s attention, and he gladly turned his focus to the much-more interesting task of eavesdropping on his coworkers, swiveling his chair just slightly to allow him to watch them from his peripheral vision. “I’m trying to get final numbers for the Anniversary Gala next week. Should I put you down for a plus one?”
He was making his way toward the register when he noticed the shelf full of snow globes, their miniscule inhabitants enacting cozy winter scenes under a constant fall of drifting snow. Walking over, he found the one that Teddy had pointed out to him—the hill of sledders with its little family on the toboggan that could almost have been them. He watched them climb back up the slope, dragging their sled behind them, before gliding gracefully back down. He thought about laughter and exhilaration and the feel of his own legs bracketing Harry’s, both of them holding tightly to Teddy. He thought about that moment when everything had started to change, when his feelings had become as inevitable as their final tumble down the hill.
“Village, actually, but yes, that’s the one. It’s lovely, but it’s too steeped in old magic for there to be an internet connection, even if the people who lived there had wanted one. I’ve been in withdrawal.”
The hot water was a balm on Draco’s sore muscles, and he sighed as the tension began to wash away, closing his eyes and tipping his head back into the spray. Harry stood before him, chest almost brushing his, running his hands leisurely up and down Draco’s sides. When he began to press soft kisses to Draco’s arched neck, he laughed. “That is not going to help with the efficiency of this shower.”
Harry laughed. “Let me guess, they want you to quit your Quidditch career and do… whatever it is people from old, pureblood families do for work?”
Harry hummed as the soft scent of lavender wafted through the glass cubicle. “That feels nice. Smells nice, too.”
the time, and that it was now safe for him to rise—clambered out of the bed. “Well, I’m just… bathroom,” he said eloquently before sort of run-walking to the en suite and shutting the door tightly behind him. He managed to hold back his groan of embarrassment until he heard the sounds of Draco shuffling out of the room and closing the door quietly behind him. Fucking hell.
“Fine,” Teddy sighed, put-upon in the way only a child can be. Draco saw Harry glance over his shoulder at him, but he shoved his hands in his pockets and kept his eyes on the ground.
“Yeah, I caught that bit.” Bizarrely, as the reality of the situation sank in, he found he wasn’t particularly upset at the rejection. If anything, he was almost… relieved. He wondered vaguely if he might be a little bit in shock. “Do you want to tell me why?”
“Breakfast would be wonderful, thank you. I was actually wondering, though, could you see if Pansy or Draco is available? I have a couple questions.”
“Oh good.” Finally, she smiled back at him before looking around the cheesily ‘romantic’ room. “Merlin, look at this place. Who on earth thought that this was a good idea?”
“Ooh, are we eating?” Ron asked, sitting up from where he’d been lying out on a towel on the rear part of the deck where the shade didn’t reach. “I’m starving.”
“Yes, exactly! See, you get me.” Harry grinned and slid his thumbs under the waistband of Draco’s trousers. “Come over when this is all done?”
want to spend two hours in a car with Ginny, Pansy, and Blaise right now. Thankfully, they managed to behave themselves—probably because within five minutes of leaving, Harry told them that if they didn’t stop tormenting him, he might be distracted enough to crash the car.
Harry laughed wetly and freed one hand to wipe at his face. “Sort of feels like it right now. I’m out for the rest of the season, and I’m pretty sure I just tanked my entire career.”
“Mmm, I don’t think I will.” Draco raised an eyebrow, removing his hand from his pocket only to spin a cigarette between his long, pale fingers and
“Ah.” Sadiyah looked uncomfortable. “I dunno, Harry, I definitely feel weird talking shit about another contestant. Sort of feels like trying to give myself a leg up at someone else’s expense, yeah?”
“Blaise might,” Greg suggested, thumping the side of the craft with his palm a couple times like it was a horse he was appraising. “Malfoy’s family was too posh, but I think one of Blaise’s stepdads was into boating.”
“Now get back out there; you aren’t here to chat with me, you’re here to show off those, what did Luna call them? Oh yes— ‘nice shoulders and round bottom.”
Harry held his gaze for what might have been a moment too long before clearing his throat and looking away. “Once or twice.” Running his fingers over the green felt top, he felt a tingle of magic and smiled. “The Muggle kind, anyway. How does the wizarding version work?”
Draco grinned. “Some of my better work, if I do say so myself.” He stood. “I should go. Goodnight, Harry.”
‘Not too badly,’ was actually, Harry had to admit, a bit of an understatement. He’d followed Malfoy’s career in the French league, and the man had become a rather extraordinary player. Surprisingly, Harry had found himself feeling much the same way about it as he’d felt about watching Ron’s career take off—oddly proud to see what he could do, once his life wasn’t being defined by the people around him. The press hadn’t only reported on his career, either; Malfoy was often mentioned as a generous philanthropist and frequent volunteer for any number of charitable causes.
“I do?” Draco frowned and looked down at his thin flannel bottoms and worn tee shirt. “Am I allowed to put my robe on, at least?”
Malfoy and I discuss the house system one day, and how fucked up it is, how it encourages the insularity and bitterness that led to the war. How maybe he would have learned to be less of a bigoted little shit earlier if he’d had to share rooms with people who weren’t raised in the same circles he was. Maybe he wouldn’t have, but it sucks that he didn’t even get the chance.
There was a pause. “He was down for breakfast a bit ago, but I’m not sure where he is now. I’ll let him know that you were looking for him, though, if you’d like.” Draco silently thanked his aunt for keeping his rapid departure to herself. He was aware that he must have looked like an idiot as he sprinted up the stairs and away from the conversation that he knew was coming. His avoidance was as obvious as an Erumpent in a tea shop.
Harry didn’t even register the question. “I’ve got to go.” His voice was strained, and he found himself pushing through the crowd and out the door on autopilot, not waiting for a response.
They had the stew as a late lunch/early dinner, and by the time they’d finished and digested, the rain had—as  Luna had predicted—stopped, and the sky had cleared to reveal a beautiful sunset. Greg got the fire started, and before long, tall flames were licking up into a sky darkening into an inky black, studded with innumerable twinkling stars.
He spotted him by the bar, near where Harry himself had been not too long ago. Harry approached, feeling almost shy. “Hey,” he greeted him. “Tired of dancing already?”
Harry laughed, a warm little ball in his belly at the idea of Draco looking at him while he wasn’t paying attention.
Harry gave her a small smile. “Sorry, that’s just what we call children’s stories with magic in them. They aren’t about actual fairies most of the time, and as far as I know, they weren’t written by them, either. Some are still fairly gruesome, though.” He thought of the collection of Grimm’s fairytales he’d picked up to read to Teddy when he was little, only to slam it shut in horror when he’d gotten to the end of Cinderella. “Lots of mutilated body parts.”
. Almost immediately, however, the world snapped back into motion, and everything descended into chaos. Harry didn’t know who had seen the altercation, but, evidently, somebody had, because they were suddenly surrounded by swearing, scuffling teammates. Harry tried to pull back, to rein in the madness that he’d inadvertently unleashed, but it was too late.
Harry grimaced. “Sorry. Look, I was on my way to grab a coffee; can I buy you one as an apology? Or were you on your way somewhere?”
Her comment about fancy hotels and restaurants and whatever was also bothering him. Was that why she was interested in him? Because he had money? Looking back, she had spent an awful lot of time talking about art and travel and whatnot in the few conversations they’d had—she hadn’t actually talked about much else that he could remember, he realized. He also couldn’t recall her talking at all about her actual life, just the things she
“I don’t knowwwww,” Teddy whined, reluctantly holding onto Draco’s hand as they walked down the street. “What are
of us did. Why are you so sure he didn’t?” Harry furrowed his brow. “Have you seen something behind the scenes?”
“And that’s how you do it,” he gloated as he straightened, smirking smugly down at Harry. “Suck it, Potter.”
Quite a few hours later, Draco lay in his bed, staring at the ceiling, frustration mounting as his mind ran in circles and refused to allow him to sleep.
“That sounds great.” Harry smiled. He was feeling a lot better than when they’d started; in fact, he was rather enjoying his time with Draco and found that he wasn’t particularly ready to end it. The bartender made them two cocktails from the list of specialties, and they went to sit at a tall table to one side.
Blaise did, it transpired, have some experience with a Floaterboat—and so, on Tuesday, they filled a cooler with snacks and drinks and piled on board.
“I do not moon!” He did moon, and he knew it, but he wasn’t about to say so. He still had his pride. “And he didn’t ask me out, either.”
After they had stretched their third round as long as they reasonably could, Draco reluctantly said that they should probably go. His last night of drunkenness was too fresh in his mind; he
If that had been the end of things, Harry would have been fine. Great, even; if anyone deserved to have the best of everything, in Harry’s opinion, it was the Weasleys. But then, Ginny Weasley had gone and fallen in love with Pansy Parkinson.
The burn and stretch were intense as the head of Harry’s cock pushed past the still-resistant muscle. Draco realized vaguely that he hadn’t even seen it, caught up as he’d been in the myriad of sensations he’d been experiencing. It must be big. The feelings went on and on as Harry pressed deeper, confirming Draco’s suspicions. Through the sound of blood rushing in his ears, he could hear Harry moan and curse.
“Seriously. But yeah, mostly that sort of thing. Last night he asked me probably a dozen questions about Draco, which was, like, extremely weird.”
Harry pondered this. “Well, obviously I want to see how we vibe when it’s just the two of us. It’s different to hang out with someone solo than it is in a group. I want to see what they’re like when they don’t need to stand out from the crowd to get my attention. Other than that, I’m hoping to sort out some key compatibility issues to see if we’re on the same page.”
Pansy snickered. “Don’t worry, darling, I’ll wait with you for the proper stuff. But I was hardly going to stop her.”
HEY LOOK, PLOT. It had to show up eventually! While I was writing this, I did a LOT of googling various London Christmas activities—and let me tell you, it is not that easy to find information on things like which Christmas Markets started when or what the window displays were at toy stores in 2006. The only time I’ve personally been to London in the winter was January 2010, and all I can say from personal experience is that they do not believe in salting the sidewalks, which I learned by falling on my ass. More than once. It was very icy that year. Anyway, I tried to research, but eventually I gave up, so if this isn’t entirely accurate, I apologize. Even the most neurotic of Ravenclaws has limits.
Harry grinned. “You make a very good point.” He took Draco by the waist, pulling him forward to close the distance between them and kissing him once more. Cautiously, he let his hands trail up and down Draco’s sides. When Draco responded, making a pleased little sound and pulling him closer, he let them slide underneath his shirt, caressing skin slightly goose-pimpled from the cool night air or possibly Harry’s touch. Draco shivered, and Harry pulled the shirt up, encouraging Draco to lift his arms so that he could pull it off entirely.
And that stirred up an entirely different flurry of emotions that Harry was completely incapable of handling on top of everything else.
“No, it was nice,” Harry told him, his words rushed and somewhat higher pitched than usual, much to his embarrassment. He thought, with mild hilarity, that he seemed to be a bit rusty at letting people kiss him, in general. He really
They worked efficiently together, slicing and peeling and rolling and sauteing, casting stasis charms as they went. They chatted as they worked, Draco carefully steering the conversation away from Harry or his imminent departure, and Narcissa, for once, let him. Andromeda and Teddy returned at some point and were promptly banished from the kitchen to ensure that they didn’t interrupt the rhythm of his and his mother’s efforts as they worked methodically through their list. Draco smiled as a truly impressive selection of finger foods began to take shape, their presentation precise and elegant under mother and son’s joint perfectionism.
Once they’d picked up speed, it was remarkably like flying, albeit quite a bit harder on the arms. Still, the smooth rush forward was familiar and exhilarating, especially with Draco racing alongside. The smell of lake water and fresh air, combined with the heat of the sun and the cool of the wind and the sound of Draco laughing and swearing beside him as Harry pulled ahead, was everything Harry could have asked for on their last day away from the real world.
Next to Harry, Draco snorted before leaning in to whisper into Harry’s ear, “‘Unavoidable conflict’? Try ‘restraining order’.” Harry shushed him, trying not to laugh. He honestly pitied Romilda a bit—but not enough that he wasn’t relieved not to see her seated among the others. And as for Jack, well. He supposed he’d never know the truth about them, whoever they were. He’d thought that maybe someone watching the show might have recognized them, but no one had ever come forward, so that was that. It seemed that they would remain forever a mystery.
“Your father has already shared the announcement with the league organizers. It’s not up for discussion.”
I really enjoyed writing this chapter and thinking through what all of Draco’s thought processes would be at this point in time. Because we’re living on story time (and fluffy story time, at that), I think it sometimes feels like things like falling in love or deciding to uproot your life are quick and simple and uncomplicated. In reality, a choice like Draco is facing is huge, and he and Harry—as the people they are now—have only known each other for three weeks. From an outside perspective, the choice seems straightforward, but for Draco I think it really wouldn’t be.
Harry shook his head in amusement. “Alright, get out of here you lot, I need to sleep this day off.”
“I think that we want very different things from our lives. I’m sorry. I hope you find the right person for you.”
“Sounds perfect.” Leela smiled, and Sadiyah smiled back. There was a murmur of assent from the others. “So, who all’s good with puzzles and riddles and things?”
Fortunately, Teddy was not in the market for too many gifts; he was young enough yet that he didn’t really think of adults outside of his immediate family as people that needed presents, so he was only shopping for Harry, Andromeda, and Narcissa. Unfortunately, he seemed to be determined to go into every single shop to make sure that he found the exact right thing for each of them.
that was why Potter was here. The Arrows were the only team without a Seeker at the moment, owing to the horrible incident at last year’s qualifiers. Draco himself had been brought on to distract from the scandal, pushing the Wasps’ former seeker—who had been on a losing streak anyway—into the reserves. He should have realized immediately.
Sadiyah looked considering for a moment. “Well, it sounded like there are two main things that we need to do: find clues and puzzles and then solve them, right? So why don’t we all start out by looking for anything that seems out of place and bringing it back here.” She indicated a wooden table to the side of the room that’s surface was fairly empty. “Once we have enough that patterns are starting to emerge, half of us can keep looking for the rest of the clues, and the other half can begin trying to sort out the puzzles. Does that work for everyone?”
on it,” Teddy told Draco proudly. “They asked him to make it special for Christmas. I watched some but I don’t go to his workshop much because he gets busy and then it's boring. He’s got better toys inside, come look!”
As the night went on, Draco had to grudgingly admit that Harry had been right about them not actually knowing each other, despite their many years of circling one another. But Draco had been right about something else: Harry Potter was anything but boring. On the contrary, he was so compelling that Draco found himself building a mental list of things he wanted to show Harry just to see his reactions and places he wanted Harry to take him because they sounded spectacular.
He sat up and checked himself over carefully. His right palm, where he had cut it with the silver knife, now bore a small white straight scar. He touched it for a moment, feeling the slightly raised skin, but it didn’t hurt at all.
The tree immediately curved a creaking branch across his lap, and Draco watched as a section of bark as wide and long as his hand peeled back for him to take. He picked it up, wincing at the obvious gash left behind. He stroked the exposed wood as if to soothe it and whispered, “Thank you, sir.”
Well, best get to the hospital wing as quick as he could, and with luck he’d be back in time for Potter and he’d never need to know Draco had gone. It was unlikely to work out like that, but he needed to do this for Prudy. And for Dobby.
“Sir is having a nasty knock to the head and a slight concussion, as well as many bruises, but Winky is not able to help with your leg, sir.”
After another couple of seconds of him looking anywhere but at her gaze, the healer - doctor - seemed to take pity on him.
Of course, Draco would be questioned under Veritaserum in any case, but it still wouldn’t be as revealing as freely offering his memories to the court. The damage to his father would be limited by the court’s knowledge of the right questions to ask. But he would also be offering no more than every other Death Eater. He would have no bargaining power at all.
