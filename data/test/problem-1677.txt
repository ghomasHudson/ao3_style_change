“No, it has to be now.” Harry insisted.
They had grown close over the last couple of months, yes. He probably felt closer to the blond than to anyone else at the moment. Ron and Hermione included. He loved spending time with Draco and it didn't even matter what they were doing. Whether they were talking, flying or even studying together.
“He called her a mudblood!”
Draco felt torn. On one hand he really wanted to follow the other boy and find out what he was up to. But Nott had back-up, even if it was just two fourth-year girls by the looks of it, while Draco was alone. And the match would start in a few minutes.
"He wanted me to play mascot and make it look like I'm working for the Ministry."
“You mean you really didn't recognize his untidy scrawl? Okay, it's gotten better, but his handwriting really doesn't look all that different now. And the name... Snape's father was a Muggle. His mother was a witch. A witch by the name of Eileen Prince.”
“Who...?”
"There will always be people who disappoint you. Especially those who are close to you." Draco mused quietly, thinking of his father. "You can't prevent that. But everyone who dares to hurt you from now on has to answer to me."
“Can't help it. I'm still traumatized.”
So Harry kept moping, dragging himself through his classes and stubbornly avoiding his boyfriend, even though he missed the blond prat. Once lessons were done on day two, the Gryffindor fled to his room and used the two-way-mirror to contact Sirius and Remus. He finally told them about the memory and his talk with Dumbledore, before complaining about Draco. To his surprise and great annoyance, Sirius actually sided with the blond.
He didn't dare look at the blond, afraid of what he might do. Just a bargain, he reminded himself yet again. But was it really? Draco had fantasized about him. And not just recently, judging by his words. What did that mean?
“Yeah, so you'll better get dressed. And get rid of the snake, before someone tells a teacher.” Dean added with a pointed look at Draco.
Those were definitely good news. Harry didn't know what to say.
“It's what we do.”
“Of course not.” Draco huffed. “Stir clockwise, not counter-clockwise. When we were listening in front of Dumbledore's office the other day, Sirius and Remus talked about a prophecy, remember?”
At least the window offered little resistance and they were able to get it open quickly. Climbing out proved tricky though, since there was almost no room to manoeuvre and their joined wrists hindered their movements.
“I guess.” Harry agreed, wondering where this was going.
“He complained about Nott. And he told me what Nott is up to. At least as much as he knows.” Draco said, before recounting the conversation he'd had with Goyle.
Lunch was almost over by the time they arrived back at Hogwarts, but they managed to grab a few sandwiches, before retreating to the library to get some homework done. Draco noticed that Harry kept glancing at the girls, obviously still shocked by their earlier revelation. Their little group only split up after leaving the library. The two couples disappeared for some alone time, while Harry and Draco returned to their room.
"At least I don't preen in front of a mirror like a girl." Harry shot back.
“I don’t know. Maybe it’s fake or something…”
“Right.”
“Well, you're so keen to find out what I'm up to. I could tell you.” Malfoy offered.
He threw his head back and let his eyes flutter closed, little moans and whimpers spilling from his lips as he pushed into Harry's hand.
“I guess it's worth a try.” he said finally.
“Yeah, just stab it, Mione.”
“I guess we’ll have to wait and see what happens.” Remus ended the discussion. “There’s nothing we can do at the moment.”
“The fountains mingle with the river,
Harry sat bolt upright in bed, panting like he'd really just been running for his life. He fumbled for his glasses and looked at the clock. 3 am in the morning. Hesitating only a moment he reached for the two-way-mirror and cast a quick silencing charm at his bed-hangings, so he wouldn't disturb the others.
He cast a notice-me-not-spell on both of them and they crept upstairs. A door stood open, showing a low-ceilinged bedroom, only lit by the light of Harry’s wand. The smell coming from the room was even worse than downstairs.
"What the fuck..! Potter! What are you...?"
“No, it's not. I didn't mean to hurt you so badly. I... I didn't know what that spell did. I would have never used it if I'd known.” the dark-haired boy swore.
“He probably would. But I don't think you should ask him to.” Luna said matter-of-factly.
"And then?" Remus prodded.
“Good. Well then, let's go.”
When Harry came back to himself he was lying on the blanket, with his head in Draco's lap. His three friends were all gazing at him worriedly, but it was the blond who spoke:
“I wanted to. But Daphne said I had to court you properly, cause you're a pureblood.”
"Yes, you're free. Just don't ever go back there. It's not safe for you." the blond implored.
He looked over at Astoria again. She was sitting across from him at the small table, sipping her wine with an air of boredom. Just like predicted, she had pouted for a few days after the picnic incident and then she had graciously accepted his apology (along with a dozen roses and some very expensive chocolate) and forgiven him.
“Blaise?”
“Be quiet, Sirius. You’re waking the whole house.” he admonished. “And you’d better come back inside, Harry.”
There was a flurry of movement. The Gryffindors stood to join Draco and shield Harry. Then the Ravenclaws followed. And the Hufflepuffs. And after that even some Slytherins. Harry felt a rush of gratitude.
“Well, they’re all wrong. Harry and I are just friends.”
"What happened?" Harry asked again.
Still, some people had to die. Like Remus. I'm a wolfstar shipper, so since Sirius is already dead here, Remus had to die, too. Makes no sense, does it? Well, that's just how I feel. And I also wanted Harry to feel connected to Teddy.
“Ah, Probity Probes – so crude, but effective.” Travers commented lightly. He nodded left and right to the wizards, who raised the golden rods and passed them up and down his body. The Probes were obviously meant to detect spells of concealment and hidden objects.
“I would as well.” Sirius offered.
“You will help an old man avoid pain and humiliation. That should not damage your soul.” Dumbledore reasoned. “I ask this one great favour of you, Severus.”
"It seems that professor Snape has finally found the bonding spell that was used on you." she let them know. "With the help of Remus Lupin, from what I've gathered. If you would like to visit him in his office after lessons today, he will tell you what he's found out about the bond."
The first incident, as he would later come to call it, happened on a regular Sunday afternoon. All had been normal, or at least as normal as it could be these days, so far. But then Ginny asked him to accompany her on a walk. Swallowing down his feeling of unease he agreed and followed her out of the house, never noticing the hopeful smile on Molly's face as she watched them go.
“I know. But where? If it is the diadem of Ravenclaw... where could it be? Where would he have hidden it?” Harry wondered, thinking again of the statue of Rowena Ravenclaw, with the stone diadem upon her white curls.
“Stop that and sit back down. You’re making me nervous.”
“Sirius!” Harry yelled suddenly. He sprinted across the hall and threw himself into his godfather’s arms.
“Ron was wrong. Snape believed me that I only defended myself.”
“I haven't had an outburst that bad in months. Really.”
“But...” Ron spoke up again, only to be interrupted by Harry, who didn't want to listen to any more accusations.
"Good. Then back to the matter at hand. Where was I? Oh, yes. Why I believe that Potter very obviously likes you. Well, all this helping aside, he didn't kick up much of a fuss about this bond, did he? And we all know he's usually very vocal about anything that pisses him off. Just remember how often he got into it with Umbridge last year. And the lunch date?"
“Told you that Levicorpus-thing was funny.”
“The Snitch I caught in my first ever Quidditch match. Don’t you remember?”
"There might be." she said slowly. "But… with the marks appearing on both of your wrists… I think it is unlikely."
"Just a little accident." Sirius assured. "Don't worry, Minister. We've got it under control."
When he finally made it to his dorm room he was greeted by a grinning Blaise.
"No, he doesn't. You were rivals at school. We're no longer in school. And I always felt there was some unresolved sexual tension between the two of you."
The Gryffindor shrugged, knowing that he’d have to face the consequences sooner rather than later. He wouldn’t put it past Ron and Hermione to show up today. Maybe talking about it would help with the inevitable confrontation.
Glad that at least someone believed him and fully on board with that idea, Harry decided to do just that. So he watched Malfoy closely during the day, followed him under the invisibility cloak between classes and tracked his movements on the Marauder's Map in the evenings.
“Harry…”
Harry grinned, immensely relieved that the blond was just as nervous and awkward about it all as he was. “I know what you mean. I can't wait either.” he assured.
“Do you think of making it public?” the animagus asked.
“Heard what?”
“He's not the one who attacked me. Please, can he stay? Only for a little while.” Draco asked, giving her his best puppy look. The one that had always worked on his mother and most of their house-elves. She pursed her lips and looked them over.
"I don't like saying this, but Harry is right." Remus said with a sigh. "The risk of the Horcrux getting lost is too high."
“Maybe we should wait a few more days. Come up with a better plan.” the werewolf tried to reason.
Remus rolled his eyes. “Be that as is may, Snape is not the only death eater at Hogwarts. There are at least two more. And he might have warned them as well.”
“What's more important is what kind of treasure was hidden in her vault.” the old headmaster went on, ignoring Draco's obvious turmoil. With a smile he pulled a dented and battered looking cup from a drawer and placed it on his desk.
February brought surprisingly mild weather and the general mood in the castle seemed to lift with the temperatures. To Harry it felt like they were really getting over the war now. Most students were in high spirits and even the seventh and eighth years couldn't be dragged down by their immense workload, which was supposed to prepare them for their upcoming NEWTs.
Draco and Sirius exchanged a surprised look. The blond wondered why someone would try to steal the sword of Gryffindor. There were only a handful of people who knew that it could destroy Horcruxes. And only one girl at Hogwarts who knew that Dumbledore had wanted Harry to have it.
“You wanted to let Death Eaters into the school.” Harry accused.
Her words hit him like a ton of bricks. She knew? But how could she know?
“Ignore them. Focus on something else.”
Harry watched in horror as the little man started choking himself. He grabbed the silver hand and tried to pry it away from Pettigrew's throat, but again it was no use. Draco had finally picked up his wand again and pointed it at the hand: “Relashio!”
Madam Pomfrey's yell prevented Draco from answering. The matron came bustling over and shooed him back into bed with a stern glare. "You will stay lying down until I've given you permission to get up. Understood?"
“But… I’m not even a Gryffindor.”
It was slow going, with only his wand lighting the way. He kept expecting a barrier to stop them any time, but none came, which only made his unease grow. When he heard voices, he put out the light of his wand.
“Oh come on, Draco. I've known for ages that you're bent. And it doesn't take a genius to figure out what's going on between you two, with the way you're always looking at each other. And did you never notice that he always finds excuses to touch you?”
Daphne actually giggled. “It’s good that you can joke about it.” she praised. “If you can joke about the bad things that happened to you, then you’re on your way to overcome them.”
“Exactly. He made me read the story and then he claimed it was sort of true.”
But when he reached the entrance to the eighth year quarters he found it blocked by none other than Ginny and Justin, who were snogging like there was no tomorrow, completely oblivious to their surroundings.
Draco pulled him into his arms and Harry leaned against him.
“I know, but... Well, at first we thought you just wanted some time to yourself. We got a little worried when you didn't show up in the common room after a while, but then Blaise Zabini said he'd just seen you with Hagrid.”
“Yes, I've noticed.”
Urquhardt was ruthless, despite complaints from various players. He took them through the drills again and again, completely unconcerned by the wind and heavy rain. Draco wondered what he'd have to pay Millie to make her knock their team captain off his broom. Too much, he decided in the end. She'd probably want a detailed report of his intimate encounters with Harry. She'd been needling him for information for a while now.
“And that’s a good thing?”
Harry jumped out of the way. The curse hit a bottle nearby, shattering it. Crabbe aimed again, but Draco was quicker and shot a stunning spell at him. Crabbe dove for cover at the last second and vanished behind a desk.
“In the end I agreed not to tell you anything, unless you specifically asked me about it.” Sirius spoke up again. There was a strange twinkle in his eyes and a smile tugging at his lips.
“Bogrod, get the clankers and take Madame Lestrange to her vault.”
"Have you ever heard of a Horcrux?"
Harry quickly filled them in about the evacuation and Snape's flight. Most of the students started for the Great Hall. While Harry reunited with Remus, who told him about his son Teddy and asked Harry to become the boy's godfather, the Weasleys finally made peace with Percy, who had come to join the fight. There was some discussion when Mrs. Weasley tried to send a protesting Ginny back home.
“Only what Dumbledore told me and Remus, which probably wasn't everything.” Sirius let him know. “He claims that he was there when Trelawney made the prediction, so he's the only one who knows the correct wording. The prophecy was the only reason he hired her.”
“Of course.”
“Yes, they might.” Hermione agreed. “We’ll need a good plan first.”
The blond focused his attention on Harry and Ron, who were both breathing deeply, with matching grins on their faces. The reason for that was the gold-coloured cauldron next to their table, which was emitting a strange mix of scents.
"I'm not going anywhere."
“No, nothing. I was getting bored with the game, so I decided to go to bed early.”
"Fine, then. It's over. And don't come crawling back to me!"
Goyle nodded.
Now he had to realize that his brother had done something incredibly brave. That he’d tried to stop Voldemort, instead of just running away. Harry could imagine how he felt. It was a bit like finding out that the father you idolized had been a bully in his own youth.
“And if we walk into a trap? Like Godric’s Hollow?” Draco pointed out.
“No, she… she didn’t bother me.”
“We went to get something that will help us defeat Voldemort.” Harry let her know, before talking about the cave and the potion Dumbledore had drunk, the lake and the Inferi and making their way back to find the Dark Mark hovering in the sky above Hogwarts. “And then Snape... and Nott ... killed him.” he ended his tale.
He grabbed his wand from the bedside table and cast a quick cleaning spell on himself, before slipping back beneath the covers, still wondering what the hell had just happened.
They left the room and he was just about to wish for the room full of junk, when Ron suddenly remembered that the house elves would still be down in the kitchens and that they should have been evacuated as well.
“What should I call him, then? Your puppy? Charity project? … Boyfriend?”
“Draco is right. There’s something off about her.” Sirius chimed in.
Harry watched him, trying unsuccessfully to stifle a grin. He knew exactly what Ron was talking about. The blond usually looked immaculate. Not a hair out of place. Just not right after waking up. Harry had been surprised about that too. He had always thought that while his own hair simply refused to lie flat, Draco's hair would be the opposite.
“Thank you.”
“Snitches have flesh-memory.” Draco suddenly realized.
Draco gripped Harry’s arms, forcing the Gryffindor to look at him. “They’ll be okay. The Weasleys are very capable of defending themselves. And I also don’t think they have much to fear if it turns out that you’re not there. As for Ron and Hermione … they’ll know what to do. Remember what Mione said last night? She packed their stuff into her bag, in case we had to take off at a moment’s notice. They’re going to meet us at the cottage.”
“The Ministry has fallen. Scrimgeour is dead. They are coming.”
“I thought that would be quite obvious. I couldn’t stop thinking of you, Harry.” Draco whispered seductively.
“How did you do that?” Ron wanted to know, but the dark-haired boy merely shrugged and mumbled something about getting lucky.
“It's what he does, Draco. What he feels he needs to do. It would not be fair if you asked him to change that. He wouldn't understand.”
“Nono, I’m fine.” Harry assured. “Just a bit tired, I guess.” His gaze darted around the room, before settling on Draco again. He still looked a bit shaken. “So… what did she want?” he asked, jerking his head at the door.
“You're not. Go ahead. Tell me about the nightmare.”
“My family are blood-traitors.” Ron piped up.
“And ended up in detention.” Remus reminded.
Malfoy sighed and looked down at Harry again. "Don't mind her. She's always this bitchy and annoying. You actually did me a favour by scaring her off."
“Maybe Sirius and Remus found it.” Ron said hopefully.
“Just for a moment. I need to show you something.”
Harry exhaled shakily. “Draco.” he whispered back. The name rolled off his tongue like he'd just been waiting to finally use it. “Draco.”
“Take a seat, Draco.”
"Good. Me too."
“Did he say what?” Harry asked warily.
He pointedly turned away from her and focused his attention onto the first years. The last thing he wanted was to listen to Daphne getting all lovey-dovey about her girlfriend. His unrequited crush on Harry was bad enough. Even without the Gryffindor's weird behaviour and his friends rubbing their own happiness in his face.
“Well, what I’m talking about would be considered Advanced Magical Theory.”
“Aww, poor little Potty.” Draco mocked, earning himself a glare. “Want me to take your mind off of them for a while? I actually came in here to congratulate you on your win, you know.”
“We need to get going. We’re wasting time.” Harry complained.
"Yes, he will. Madam Pomfrey said there will be no side effects." the Gryffindor girl assured. She looked visibly relieved.
"I trusted him." he mumbled into the blond's shoulder.
“I only meant … you look tired.”
>Usually Blaise would shake me awake and we would both pretend nothing had happened the next day.< Draco had said. >But there were nights when he couldn’t get me awake. Where I was too caught up in the nightmare to fully snap out of it. Those nights he usually fetched Pansy and she would crawl into bed with me and hold me until I calmed down.<
"Why don't we stay out here for a while, hm? The weather is nice and Blaise is being a prick. Not that unusual, but still..." Malfoy sighed softly. "He's not too pleased that I want to keep you, you know? But don't worry. I'm sure he'll come around. And I think Pansy is going to be on my side. She'll think you're cute."
One of Draco's hands slipped underneath Harry's shirt, lightly stroking the bare skin of his back. Harry moaned and retaliated by sucking on the blond's neck. He was rewarded with a startled gasp and what sounded like: “Fuck, Harry!” Letting his lips trail lower he found a spot that made Draco cry out and buck up against him. And shit, he wasn't going to last much longer. He felt hot and dizzy and simply wonderful.
“I've always been into girls and boys. It's called being bisexual, Harry.”
“He's getting better.” he commented. Millicent only huffed.
Millie opened her mouth to protest, but the little girl beat her to it: “She can't come with you. She's busy.”
“Don’t tell me you’ve got ornaments above your bed, too.”
Harry soon realized that he had another problem to concentrate on. With Katie in St. Mungos his Quidditch team was a chaser short and they were only about a week away from this terms first match against Slytherin. Usually the first choice for a replacement would have been Dean Thomas, seeing how he had flown really well during try-outs. But Harry was still pissed at him for hurting Draco and didn't want him on the team. The same went for Seamus. It was bad enough that he couldn't simply kick Ginny off the team. Especially now with Katie gone.
“How did you get away?”
"You started calling him Draco." Ron pointed out.
“Shut up, Dung. I’m asking the questions here.” Sirius growled.
“We can continue this particular discussion another time.” Dumbledore decided suddenly. “Harry and Draco are waiting just outside the door.”
"It all went perfectly." Sirius assured. "Kingsley arrested my dear cousin Bellatrix. After I've accidentally hit her with a stinging hex, that is. She's probably on her way back to Azkaban as we speak. After some consideration Moony and I took Narcissa to Grimmauld Place with us. She's reconciling with Andromeda right now. And Kingsley promised to send a team of Aurors round to Malfoy Manor. Maybe we're lucky and they can catch a few more death eaters."
So the trio hurried along the street and rounded the corner. They stopped beside a shop window a good distance away from Gringotts.
“And then you're going to follow us?”
They waited with baited breath and only seconds later there was the crack of apparition. Followed quickly by another. Mipsy had come. But she hadn't come alone.
Harry's good mood held throughout the day and he even managed to get some cleaning done. He felt more alive ever since the letters had started arriving. He wasn't ready to venture outside yet, but he felt like he was finally getting better. Interacting with his mystery pen-pal had lifted his spirits and broken the monotony that had been his life for the past year. If only he'd finally get his suspicions confirmed about who the other boy was.
He began to sob so hard that there were no more coherent words. Draco felt about ready to start sobbing, too. He was no fan of the old elf by far, but he pitied him nonetheless. Kreacher had obviously adored Regulus. And then he’d been forced to watch him die and he hadn’t even been able to carry out his last orders...
“I... I've read it.”
“Sirius!” Remus cut in again. “That’s not the way to go about this.”
“What the hell are you doing?” Draco shouted at him.
Harry was about to protest, to assure Draco that he loved him, when Draco suddenly swung the sword. There was a sound like a scream and a loud crash. The smoke figure vanished. The hairband lay on the table, neatly sliced in half.
The blond cast a quick look around, obviously checking that they were alone. Then he whispered: “Like this.” and leaned over to kiss Harry.
“She did what? So that's why they attacked me... They kept saying stuff like that, but...” Draco trailed off when Madam Pomfrey returned, immediately rounding on Harry.
"Potter isn't gay."
She gave them a moment to let that information sink in, before continuing: "Professor Flitwick, professor Snape and I are continuing our research on the subject. Remus Lupin has also kindly offered to help. I know this is hard for both of you, but until we succeed, you will need to cope as best as you can. Try to spend time together. Without getting into a fight, I might add. Though that should be obvious."
“I still shouldn't have used that spell. I nearly killed you. I'm so sorry.” Harry assured.
Harry turned away with a shudder and found Malfoy sitting in one of the squashy armchairs by the fire.
“I don't care what you wanted. Out with you! Mr. Malfoy needs rest!” the matron ordered sternly.
Then he looked straight at the Hippogriff and started reciting: “The fountains mingle with the river,
“Oh really? And why doesn't Zabini want to share with you? I bet you snore.”
“And it all went spectacularly wrong.” Malfoy admitted.
"He asked me to help him. He doesn't want to hurt anyone. It's been killing him, working on that bloody cabinet."
"I already told you, they're not dates." he grumbled.
“I'm going with Draco.” Hermione answered, completely unfazed.
“I'm not sure if father knows. He probably wouldn't care either way. Mother knows and she's okay with it. Not thrilled, of course. But she accepts it.”
Thanks for the lovely comments. They made my day - as always.
Urquhart had booked the pitch on Saturday, right after the Gryffindors, so Draco and Millicent went down after breakfast to watch the Gryffindor try-outs first. It soon became apparent that a lot of people had only shown up because Harry was captain. There were an awful lot of giggling girls, people from other houses and even some who had shown up without brooms.
“I'm sorry, Draco. But I must ask you to leave.”
Harry was surprisingly quiet for a while and a sudden, horrible thought occurred to Draco.
“There are different ways. Have you ever tried meditation?” Draco asked.
“Sirius is right.” Harry chimed in.
Once again people were stopping to stare at them. Draco glared at a group of Hufflepuff first years until they ran off.
The interrogation was suddenly interrupted by Thicknesse, who luckily paid them no mind. He was too busy heading straight for Umbridge's office. Draco held his breath, but he needn't have worried. The Minister came back out only a minute later, obviously without having noticed Harry. This time he stopped to throw the assembled crowd a confused look.
“Lavender claims no-one is completely straight.” she let him know.
“Are they staring at you or me?” Harry wondered.
Harry was stunned speechless. He didn’t know much about Regulus. Sirius almost never spoke of his brother, or any of his family for that matter. He only knew that Regulus had been a Death Eater. That he’d joined Voldemort without really knowing what he was getting into and once he’d realized what a psycho Voldemort really was, it had been too late to get out.
"Could you say where she'll be at a certain time?" he checked.
They walked along the lake and then entered a small copse of trees. He was about to complain again when Harry suddenly stopped. Looking ahead the blond couldn't help but gasp. Fairy lights twinkled in the bare branches of two large oak trees. A blanket was spread out on the ground underneath, with a picnic basket waiting at the side. Draco walked to the blanket in a daze, staring at the scene, before looking back at the Gryffindor.
If that wasn't bad enough, he found himself, once more, the best friend of two people who seemed unlikely to ever speak to each other again. Ron was still mad at Hermione for the bird attack and kept mumbling that he'd never promised her anything and was free to snog whomever he liked.
"Are you okay?" Draco asked softly.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What do you mean, you're not going to do anything?” Lavender wanted to know.
“I did.” Harry confirmed. “Neville helped, cause he knows a lot about flowers and stuff and I wanted to get the meaning right.”
Only when Harry took his hand, giving it a gentle squeeze, did he lift his head again. To find most of the others smiling at them. No-one seemed to mind. Well, no-one but Ginny (who was once again glaring daggers at him) and maybe Fleur (who looked slightly put out). Mrs. Weasley assured them that they looked very lovely together, while they had to endure jibes from the twins and their older brother Bill. Draco was pretty sure that Sirius was only keeping his mouth shut because he had received some sort of warning from Remus.
The blond looked puzzled for a moment. "They fought the dark lord in the first war."
"Indeed. ... So... we got the Horcrux." the werewolf changed the subject.
A few people whooped and there was a smattering of applause. More questions arose. People were talking over each other.
“You weren't actually worried, were you? You should know me better by now.”
Harry breathed a sigh of relief. "That's great. Thank you, Sirius."
“Are you okay?” the dark-haired boy shouted back.
“A light went inside you?” Draco muttered doubtfully.
“Alright. Tell me about Potter.” she ordered, half-turning so she was facing him.
“Yeah, I thought so, too. But I don’t want to get him in trouble.”
He pulled out the Marauders Map and Draco looked at it curiously. Hesitating only slightly, Harry handed it over.
“Shagging you, of course.” Draco said matter-of-factly, causing the younger boy to splutter.
"A small dog." Harry admitted reluctantly.
"Ronald, we've been over this! I'm not staying here." she insisted.
“So? What did Sirius say?”
The moment of silence was broken when professor McGonagall entered the ward, closely followed by Mr. and Mrs. Weasley and Fleur, who immediately rushed to Bill's bedside. Harry heard Fleur declaring loudly that she was still going to marry Bill and suddenly she and Mrs. Weasley were crying and hugging each other.
“Sirius, stop insulting Snape and tell me what you saw.” The werewolf ordered.
“But I want to share a room with Dean!” the Irishman protested.
“Cool.” Ron muttered.
“I found the sword. Look.”
The loud voice made Harry jump. He blinked at the fuzzy outline of his godfather, who was clapping loudly and making cat-calls.
“And what do we do now?” Harry asked.
“Err… how did you know…?”
He could see Remus trying unsuccessfully to stifle a grin. “Draco is right. We need a plan. We can hardly just apparate to the gates and walk into Hogwarts.”
The others were no help at all. They all agreed that it would be better to concentrate on the Horcruxes (or homework and studying on Hermione's part and Quidditch on Millicent and Ron's part) and leave it to Dumbledore to deal with Nott.
“That makes sense.”
With no classes to attend and no homework to do, he spent his days surrounded by his friends. The weather was so beautiful, it felt almost like it was mocking them. It could have been a great time, if not for the dark shadow hanging over them. Sometimes he still felt like it had all been a bad dream. Like Dumbledore had to be sitting at the teacher's table, alive and well. Other times the reality was all too clear and he found himself mourning the old headmaster, despite the doubts he'd had about him.
Harry was sitting at the end of the table, surrounded by his friends. He was sure he’d never been this tired before. The loud voices were giving him a headache and people just wouldn’t leave him alone. It seemed like everyone felt the need to talk to him or at least shake his hand or pat him on the back.
“I am sure that getting the Horcrux won't be all that dangerous.” Dumbledore assured.
“That's right, Harry. Think of something happy.” Luna whispered. When he could only stare at her she pointed out: “We're all still here. Still fighting.”
Daphne rolled her eyes. “No, he doesn't know. At least he doesn't believe it.”
“But..”
“Do you want me to talk to mother about trying to help you?”
“But... Why would she give it to you? She could've just used an owl.” Harry wondered. Why was she writing to him in the first place? She could have just stopped by.
Sirius’ broken whisper made all of them look at him. He had one hand clapped over his mouth and Draco could see tears glistening in his eyes. Remus wordlessly pulled him into a hug and Draco turned away. He couldn’t even guess what Sirius must be feeling, now that he knew the truth about his brother’s death.
“Good. Then take us to this room. Maybe Dobby can take Ron and Hermione and Mipsy, could you take Draco and me?”
"Even if he was, he wouldn't be interested in me." Malfoy insisted.
They were quiet for a moment, until Weasley once again broke the silence. Draco was getting the impression that the red-head couldn't keep his mouth shut for more than a few minutes.
“Yeah, well… I’ve told you to follow our example and elope.”
She made a distressed noise, but Harry ignored her and went on: “They locked me in a cell in Malfoy Manor. And then... Draco came to save me. He helped me escape.” He decided against telling them about Rookwood and the torture, not wanting to relive those horrible moments. “We've been on the run together ever since.”
He might have been able to talk his way out of it, if Lavender hadn't cornered Harry during breakfast and made him promise to go. And of course Harry argued that Draco couldn't leave him all alone with the girls. Faced with the Gryffindor's puppy eyes he had no choice but to agree to come as well. Neville and Hannah got bullied into tagging along, too. After all, they had all agreed on this trip during the train ride back from London.
“What did Doge say?” he asked.
“He did.”
“Forget about them. We need to look for the Horcrux.” Draco reminded.
“Are you going to come in?” Draco’s voice cut through the silence.
“We’ll be sure to get some. Right, Harry?”
"Hermione warned Mr. Lovegood about the danger, but he wouldn't listen." Remus took over again. "He kept insisting that it wasn't an Erumpent horn, but the horn of a Crumple Horned Snorkack."
“Kill!” Voldemort hissed in Parseltongue.
Deciding to ponder that fact later he hurried down the stairs, only slowing his steps once he reached the door to the bathroom. He could hear sobs and the voice of Myrtle, crooning softly. Taking another deep breath he pushed the door open and stepped cautiously inside.
“Or he could be innocent.” Draco pointed out. “The poison could have been in the bottle.”
He could see deep-green mountains and lakes below them. The dragon flew lower and lower in great, spiralling circles, honing in upon one of the smaller lakes.
Draco shifted on the bed, internally debating with himself. Harry was his friend. Despite their difficult history they had become friends over the last couple of years and he cherished that friendship more than he cared to admit. The Gryffindor would be totally ashamed of this phone call come morning. Draco could just stop it right here and make fun of him the next time they met and everything would be fine. They’d laugh about it and move on.
"He's going to k..kill mother. And he'll make me … watch and then… he… he'll kill me too."
The Gryffindor shook his head, so they drank their tea in silence. Andromeda appeared a few minutes later. She let them know that she’d explained everything to the Weasleys and that he wouldn’t have to return to the Burrow if he didn’t want to. She also assured Harry that it hadn’t been his fault, but Draco could tell that he didn’t believe her.
“Yes, I am. Those bloody reporters pissed me off. Pretty much everything pisses me off right now. And you know what happens when I get angry.”
But it wasn't just a nightmare. Ron and Hermione had really left him. Rookwood had really tortured him. All those things had happened. And that made it worse. It made the whole hopelessness of his situation crash down on him and Harry tried in vain to stifle a sob. The blond reached out tentatively, laying a comforting hand on the younger boy's shoulder.
Which left him with another problem. He was supposed to bring a date. And everyone knew it. Hermione had already warned him that she had caught a few girls discussing how to best slip him a love potion. The Weasley twins offered those in their shop and had devised a clever plan to deliver them to Hogwarts without having them confiscated, which made it all too easy for those girls. Romilda Vane kept popping up whenever Harry entered the common room, offering him sweets or something to drink. It was getting really tiresome.
“You're kidding, right? I can't remember ever meeting her before.” the dark-haired boy grumbled.
It looked like Harry needed a moment to digest this, but finally he nodded and asked, “So what happened when you got home? Did you tell Regulus where you’d been?”
“Are you going to spend an hour in every shop?” Harry complained loudly when they left again.
"I said get out!" Malfoy yelled again, pointing his wand at Harry.
“Err... we're just...”
"He looked like he did in that memory Dumbledore showed me. When he asked Slughorn." Harry realized suddenly.
Strangely enough, Harry was pretty sure that he would. Draco knew him so well. And he was very thoughtful. Their impromptu trip on Halloween had proven that. Which also meant that he had to pick a thoughtful present for the blond as well. And that wouldn't be easy at all.
“They found out about us.” she sighed, which didn’t make any sense to Hermione. But the boys seemed to know what she was talking about.
Harry racked his brain. His mind still felt sluggish and it took a moment until realization set in. When it did, he gasped.
Malfoy was standing next to the bed. And he was yelling at Harry. Who suddenly realized that he must have changed back into his human form during the night. And he was still lying in Malfoy's bed. Naked! He scrambled up with a yelp and grabbed the blanket to cover himself.
In the end Harry turned to the only person he could think of asking. The only person who even believed him.
Ron looked cheered by this.
Which sounded strangely plausible to Harry. Malfoy had always been his main focus. And there had been those dreams...
“I'm not jealous!” the dark-haired boy protested.
The kids stared at him in surprise. “Dumbledore’s brother owns the Hog’s Head?”
When they finally entered the room of requirement and Draco asked if he was okay, Harry assured him that he was fine. And he meant it.
Remus sighed. “I guess so. As Sirius said, we can apparate right into the pub. Aberforth should be able to tell us whether or not it’s safe to walk up to the castle. Maybe he even knows a safe way in. If not, we’re at least close enough to look for a better way.”
Harry took a deep breath and smoothed down his robes one last time. “Yes. Let’s go.”
They parted ways inside the great hall, heading for their respective house tables. A few people still stared at them, but most of the other students had finally gotten used to seeing them together. Even the glares directed at Draco had lessened. Just like the open hostility towards Slytherin. Although Harry was pretty sure that most people just weren’t openly hostile any more, but secretly still called the Slytherins Death Eaters and other evil names. McGonagall was very strict about her idea of inter house unity and there had been a startling lot of detentions during the first couple of weeks, when people had felt justified to attack anyone wearing the green and silver of Slytherin.
“Oh, yes. She is waiting in the sitting room. Come. Pebbles will show you, Master Draco.”
Daphne hesitated a moment, but then she shrugged and climbed onto his bed as well. So much for stuffy pureblood upbringing. Her parents obviously hadn't done a good job of teaching her manners.
She snorted at that and he almost told her how un-ladylike that was, but thought better of it. Pansy had no qualms about using her sharp nails when she felt insulted. Even against him.
“Harry found the sword of Gryffindor.” Remus explained.
“You and me both.” Ron agreed, looking slightly green.
“Yep, that should do. Let's go.” Sirius decided.
“Yeah? Like what?”
Harry held out the sword to him. “Doesn’t matter.”
“I guess we’ll have to.” Remus said resignedly. “We need to get that horcrux before he has a chance to move it.”
He looked down at the beautiful bouquet, gently touching the petals of one of the Gardenias. Everything about the whole thing screamed 'I love you'. But who might have sent it? He looked over at the Gryffindor table almost on instinct. Harry was staring at him. Their eyes met for only a second, before the Gryffindor blushed and averted his gaze. Next to him Lavender giggled and said something that made him blush even harder.
Because that was what it would come down to in the end, right? He would have to kill Voldemort or be killed by him instead. Wouldn't he kill a part of Voldemort with every Horcrux he managed to destroy?
Harry turned to stare at the blond in shock.
Mrs. Weasley ushered both men inside, probably more pleased to see her estranged son than the new minister, who claimed that it had been Percy's idea to visit. Percy however looked like he'd rather be anywhere but here and returned his mother's greeting rather stiffly. And when Scrimgeour not-so-subtly asked Harry to accompany him on a stroll through the garden, so Percy could reconnect with his family, no-one believed the ruse any more
“But…”
"I can't find ... oh, Merlin's pants! ... Accio dittany!" she cried and a small bottle flew out of the bag into her hand.
In the days leading up to the wedding Narcissa had made them repeat the vows so often that Harry felt like he could say them in his sleep now. He’d still been afraid he might stumble over his words when the time came. Or forget something or say something wrong. But now that the moment had come, he was completely calm and the words flowed easily from his lips.
“What was it about this time?”
“Sure thing, prongslet. Say hi to the little dragon from me. And don't worry. I won't tell him that I've seen you in bed with Ron.” Sirius promised with a wink, before the mirror went dark.
“She wasn't. She fought over it with her friend and the package tore.”
Harry took his place at the end of the right carpet, with Sirius, who would be leading him to the altar. Ron, his best man, gave him a thumbs-up and hurried to the front, while Hermione took her place in front of Harry. Draco appeared only seconds later and stopped on the other carpet, with his mother next to him and Luna in front. He looked amazing. Harry had to admit, albeit reluctantly, that all the discussions about colour themes had paid off.
She startled at the sound of his voice and quickly wiped her eyes. “Harry, I didn't see you. Just got back?” Her voice sounded false and way too cheerful.
“They won’t.”
“I'm not trying to make fun of you.” Harry assured. “That poem may not have worked on Wilbur.” He grinned when the blond glared even harder. “But it worked on me.”
"What are you guys doing back? I thought you would be gone for another three days." he blurted.
“Of course. I already said so, didn’t I?”
Draco finally realized that the source of the large fire was Hagrid's hut. Harry continued struggling, until they both saw the half-giant emerging from the burning building, carrying his boarhound Fang. He stumbled towards them and gently put the dog down.
“Harry, let's head back! It's getting dark and I'm hungry!” he called over to the Gryffindor.
"Nice?"
His words brought a beautiful smile to Harry’s face and Draco was struck with the sudden urge to say more. To say everything. For once he wanted to throw caution to the wind and be as brave and reckless as any Gryffindor.
“That fucking old prick!”
Draco couldn't really deny that. He had no idea what had gotten into him. But he also wasn't ready to admit defeat.
Harry was still asleep when they re-entered the bedroom. Draco crawled back into bed, eternally grateful to be lying down again. Of course Sirius’ surprising restraint didn’t last long. He tucked Draco in like you would a small child.
“How are you feeling, Harry?” Hermione inquired softly, sitting down at the edge of the mattress.
All four of them were startled when a group of fourth year girls appeared at the door to their compartment. They were whispering and giggling among themselves, until a bold-looking girl with large dark eyes and long black hair stepped into their compartment, smiling at Harry.
The flash was gone as suddenly as it had come. Harry found himself sitting in the cosy little kitchen again. Draco was staring at him, wide-eyed and pale. He found himself speaking without really meaning to.
“I didn’t want to bother you for nothing. I thought maybe it was just a rusty shovel or something.”
“Best get on the train right away. Try not to get into too much trouble this year. And if you do, I want a detailed report.” Sirius joked, earning himself a stern look from Molly Weasley.
“It's not that much. We can still do it later. Or tomorrow.”
"Told you so."
“Mate, we thought we were doing you a favour. Ginny said...” Seamus started explaining, but Harry cut off his words.
He seemed nice enough, so Harry accepted the cake with a shrug. “Thanks.”
He was trying to work up the courage to approach his aunt Andromeda and ask for help.
"It was only a nightmare. You're okay. You're safe."
"And what about you, darling? Sirius told me that you sought help from the Order."
Without waiting for the blond to reply, Harry pulled himself up onto the dragon's back. He stretched out an arm and sighed in relief when Draco took it and hoisted himself up as well.
“Of course you are.”
"It's okay, Dobby. You're not their elf anymore. You can tell me about the Malfoys." Harry reassured him.
“Yes, I do. I love you, Draco Malfoy. Will you be my Valentine?”
“I’m really glad you like it so much.” he said when she finally paused to take a sip of her chocolate.
Lavender grinned triumphantly. “See?”
“I believe we have found the reason for your... outbursts.” she stated rather confidently. “You have told us that when he-who-shall-not-be-named tried to kill you as a child, a piece of his soul latched onto you, correct?”
This chapter is Draco's POV. Next one will probably be Harry's again.
“Phineas Nigellus said Snape knew about the fake sword.”
They were silent for a long moment, just looking at each other. The younger boy started fidgeting under that intense stare and averted his gaze, busying himself with folding the letter. He looked up in surprise when the blond suddenly got up from the chair and took a seat on the bed next to him.
McGonagall had gone very pale. “Snape... I never thought... But Dumbledore trusted him... He was so sure of his loyalty.”
The dark-haired boy agreed reluctantly. They packed their things and left the library, heading for the stairs.
Harry pulled his mouth away, but continued to stroke him through his orgasm. Draco collapsed into the cushions and Harry moved back up to lie beside him. "Sorry, I guess that was.." he started to say.
“There has to be.”
"They just… left you alone?" Draco asked in shock.
Draco and Blaise had been tasked with getting food. They had been on their way back from the kitchens, after asking the elves to deliver all of Ron's favourite food, when they had run into a weeping Hermione. The sight alone had made Draco's blood run cold. Because Hermione was tough and it took a lot to make her tear up. It had gotten even worse when she had thrown herself into his arms and told them among sobs and hiccups that Ron had been poisoned.
“He recognized it?”
“Hmm.. Can I hear the question again?“
“Are you really sure you want to do this?” he checked.
“Do you have any idea when our book-lists are going to arrive?” Harry asked.
Immediately there were two or three house elves bustling around them, asking if they needed anything. Now that his stomach had settled, Harry felt that he could use something to eat. "Do you have any treacle tart left? And maybe some chocolate cake for him?"
“Yeah. I heard it call for you-know-who and then… only pain.”
Of course Draco realized what he was trying to do. He was hoping that his presence would protect the blond from further harassment. Only a year ago he would have bristled at the indication that he needed Potter to protect him. Right now he didn't really care. If it meant that he could actually get his shopping done, he'd accept the younger boy's help.
Things between him and Seamus had been strained ever since. And of course Dean had readily taken Seamus’ side. Harry could feel them staring at him even now, as he made his way to the Gryffindor table. He took a seat at the very end of the table, as he always did these days. Most people from his house had learned not to bother him. As had the fan-girls, once McGonagall had started giving them detentions for pestering Harry.
“Grimmauld Place. It was among the chunk we threw out.”
They listened attentively while he told them about his trip to Hogsmeade and kept bombarding him with questions about all the shops. Was it true that Zonko’s hadn’t reopened? And what about Honeydukes? Did they really have the best chocolate? Was there really a post office in Hogsmeade with all kinds of different owls?
A cracking sound drowned out his words. Seconds later the wall beside them exploded.
“Takes one to know one.” he shot back with a grin.
Just a short chapter this time. Still hope you like it. And I've already got started on the next one.
The blond looked surprised and like he couldn't quite believe it. Harry wondered if he understood that it was no longer about their bargain. This was about them. It had been about them from the beginning, he realized. He hadn't accepted because he'd been desperate to find out what the other boy was up to. He'd accepted because deep down he'd wanted this, though he'd been too scared to admit it, even to himself.
They landed in Dumbledore's office and saw the old headmaster half-lying in his chair, semi-conscious. Snape was standing in front of him, pointing his wand at the wrist of Dumbledore’s blackened hand and muttering incantations, before forcing a goblet full of potion down Dumbledore’s throat. On the desk in front of them lay the ring that had housed the Horcrux. After a moment Dumbledore’s eyelids fluttered open.
“Why are you in my bed?” Not that he really minded that fact, but…
“You'll never find out what I'm doing in there.” he claimed. “Unless...”
“Dumbledore must have known that his will would be examined and that they wouldn’t give Harry the sword.” he reasoned.
“Why I’m here. We’ve got more in common than you think. And you’re isolating yourself too much. It’s not healthy. I want to change that.”
“No-one is ever completely straight.” Lavender claimed.
The tall boy nodded with a pout.
“We have no time to explain.” he interrupted the animagus. “There are Death Eaters in the castle. At least five of them. My father is somewhere back there and the others went in that direction.”
Potter just laughed.
“Yeah, okay.”
“You've changed. If I can see that, why can't they?”
"I feel the same." Draco admitted.
The blond was glad when lessons were done for the day and he could escape the stares and whispers for a moment. He went back to his dorm to put his school bag away and freshen up. Of course Millie was already waiting in the common room when he emerged and insisted on accompanying him, despite his protests that he didn't need a babysitter. Luckily he managed to shake her off when they ran into Neville in the entrance hall and she went all blushing virgin, as she always did in Longbottom's presence.
The team captains shook hands and then both teams kicked up off the ground, rising into the air. Draco admired how Harry looked on his broom, until the commentary started and he looked over at the commentator's podium in obvious surprise.
Draco himself felt weighed down by the locket whenever he had to wear it. He couldn’t shake the dark thoughts that kept plaguing him. The memories of his father, telling him what a disappointment he was. The fear of not being good enough. Of losing Harry and everyone else he cared about. It made him revert to his old defence mechanism - hurt them before they can hurt you. Lash out if you're feeling insecure. Of course his spirits lifted as soon as he was allowed to take off the locket and hand it over to the next wearer, but he soon started dreading his next turn more and more.
“Very well, Potter. We shall secure the school against He-who-must-not-be-named, while you search for this ... this object.”
The rest of their shopping trip was surprisingly pleasant. Potter got better at ignoring the photographers and reporters, who seemed to pop up at every corner and he even stopped bristling at every dark look and nasty comment directed at Draco. With Potter at his side no-one dared to attack the blond openly and he also didn't get thrown out of any other shops.
But in that moment none of it mattered. The only important thing was the boy in his arms and the fact that they had both made it through the war alive. Everything else would work out - one way or another.
With a resigned sigh Draco gave in. There was just no arguing with Sirius when he'd set his mind on something and he really needed to pee. So he allowed the older man to trail after him as he slowly made his way to the bathroom. At least Sirius had the decency to wait outside. And when he stepped out again Draco was even secretly glad for his presence. It felt as if the short walk had lapped up all his strength. He didn’t even protest when Sirius took hold of his arm to support him. At least he kept his mouth shut as he did so.
Most of them didn't even bother to lower their voices and he was once again glad that he'd managed to talk his mother out of bringing him to the train. He caught the word Death Eater more than once. And that was actually one of the nicest things people had to say about him.
Sated they clung to each other until their breathing evened out and their heartbeats slowed to normal. When they pulled apart the usual awkwardness set in. They glanced at each other with shy smiles.
The only one who noticed that something was off was Neville. He sat next to Harry during lunch and commented on how jittery the other boy was. But when Harry smiled and claimed that the upcoming Potions test had him keyed up, he immediately bought the excuse and went back to talking about his newest plant.
“Please what?”
Dumbledore didn’t answer. He was busy examining his dead-looking hand with detached curiosity. Snape scowled at him.
Harry grinned. “Yeah, of course. I wasn't sure if you already knew how to do it...” he trailed off with a shrug and came closer. “It's pretty advanced magic, but it's not as difficult as people make it out to be.” he assured. “The incantation is Expecto patronum. But to make it work you have to concentrate with all your might on a single, very happy memory.”
“Don't worry, professor. We won't.” Potter assured earnestly.
“All right.” Sirius agreed. But when he took a step towards her, she shook her head and pointed at Harry again.
Harry met his stare. “I know that your brother didn’t care about me. I was just a pawn in his game, like everyone else.”
“What? Oh... yeah.”
"That's a Celtic knot." Hermione observed. "And Malfoy has the same?"
“I’m fine, Blaise. If that’s all…”
"Harry Potter, sir is visiting again. What an honour!" a tiny elf squealed upon seeing him.
Draco had to agree. It would only make sense if Dumbledore had expected Snape to play a vital part in defeating Voldemort. And maybe he had. Like Remus said, the old man had always trusted Snape. Though trust was maybe the wrong word here. He'd been sure of Snape's loyalty, more likely. There had been something strange going on between the two men. Draco had always had the feeling that Dumbledore knew something about Snape. That maybe he was even blackmailing him. But he didn’t dare to voice his theory out loud.
“Oh yes, it was very popular. People seemed even more interested than in the crumble horned snorkack.”
He jumped in shock when Sirius suddenly sprang to his feet, staring at him wide-eyed.
"How dare you...!"
Nothing was okay in Draco's opinion. Not even close to okay. But there was nothing he could do, aside from following through with Harry's plan and hoping for the best. So when Luna passed him the bottle of Felix Felicis, he took a small sip, before handing it to Millicent. The feeling of euphoria and certainty that washed over him was brief. His mind was too consumed with worry for his boyfriend to fully appreciate the effects of the potion.
A move he quickly regretted when they poked him in the eye and Draco laughed at him.
The blond shrugged and gestured to the other armchair. “Why don't you take a seat? Have a drink. I've only got hot chocolate and pumpkin juice, but I could call an elf if you want something else.”
“But... I'm not like you, Draco.”
“Door's always open for you, mate. Come by whenever you like.”
Draco smiled. “Did she sent you down here?”
“Because of the sword. It was supposed to be locked in her vault at Gringotts. That’s why she tortured Hermione. To find out if we’d broken into her vault. And if we took anything else.”
"Was that necessary? I'm mentally scarred now." Ron complained loudly.
“But he didn't punish you?”
Harry decided to ignore the healers instead. What did they know anyway? He didn't need counselling. He just needed some peace and quiet. Some time to relax. And he needed people to stop annoying him. But he swallowed his pride and told Andromeda about his condition.
The younger boy frowned. “Of course I did. I sent those flowers...”
“We can use the tunnel to get them to the Hog’s Head.” Neville piped up. "If you-know-who is concentrating on the school, they should be able to leave from there."
“Protego!” someone yelled. Harry felt an arm around his waist, pulling him back and he fell to the ground, stones and debris raining down around them.
Ron and Hermione of course wanted to hear none of that and got exasperated whenever he mentioned Draco. They just didn't get it. But as the weeks wore on, they were too busy with their own lives to admonish him much. Ron seemed permanently glued to Lavender's lips nowadays and Hermione threw herself into schoolwork even more than usual. Which left Harry with a lot of free time. He used it constructively, by following Draco around school underneath his invisibility cloak or watching his dot moving around on the Marauder's Map.
“Nott got out. He was in front of us.” Hermione said, obviously guessing his thoughts.
"If you want me to."
The decision was made quickly enough, but it took him two days to finally gather his famous Gryffindor courage and actually seek out the blond. Draco wasn't hard to find, seeing how he spent most of his time in his room. But once he'd stepped inside and found the Slytherin looking at him curiously, he had no idea what to say.
“Yes. You don't have to stop trusting him. Just don't trust him blindly. And if he does something that bothers you, you discuss it with me. Or with Sirius. Okay?”
Potter raked a hand through his hair, messing it up even more than usual. His breathing had evened out, but there was still a haunted look in his eyes.
“I’m very happy. Things were tough after the war, but I’m okay now. My magic is under control. I haven’t had an outburst in ages. So you don’t have to treat me like a ticking bomb. Stop fretting and just talk to me, okay?”
By the time he was finished Draco had gotten rid of the over-large robes, pulled his shrunken down rucksack out of the pocket of his jeans and returned it to its normal size. Harry quickly pulled out his own rucksack and did the same, rummaging around for dry clothes, while the blond spread out a blanket on the ground.
Harry shot him a glare. “That’s not what I said. I only said there might be some truth in it.”
“You can help us pick out ornaments. You’re the expert on Wrackspurts after all.” Draco chimed in, obviously sensing Harry’s discomfort.
"Oh, yes. Aside from the part where the plan went to shit right after entering the Ministry and we almost got caught." Draco snarked.
“I had nothing to do with that! I swear!”
"I talked to McGonagall. She gave us permission to leave the castle grounds, as long as we're back in time for dinner." He took a deep breath and finally voiced his brilliant idea. "I thought we could visit Godric's Hollow."
"How did you find the others?"
Draco didn't sleep any better that first night back at Hogwarts. Too many thoughts and fears were chasing themselves around in his head. When he tried to leave the dorm next morning, Nott was blocking his path. Once again the smaller boy was flanked by Crabbe and Goyle, who kept their gazes down, like they couldn't even look at the blond.
Harry led the way to the staircase. Draco followed him, grumbling under his breath about Hermione bossing them around. The upper floor looked just as bad. There was a general air of decay and they left footprints in the thick dust. They opened the first door and peered inside. It looked like a sitting room. Heavy drapes had been put over the furniture to protect it from dust, giving off the impression that the room was full of looming figures.
“He'd be a fool.”
He wanted to know everything Dumbledore had neglected to tell him. He finally wanted to get answers. Real answers, from someone who had to know the truth. And Aberforth looked almost glad to be able to tell his story. He didn’t take his eyes of the portrait of Ariana as he spoke.
“Thanks.” Draco murmured softly.
“What’s that supposed to mean?” he asked, the frustration in his voice clear.
September went by in a blur of lessons, homework, study sessions in the library and stolen kisses in deserted hallways or empty classrooms. Pansy had taken Draco's threat seriously and stopped bothering him. Nott and his cronies were still mostly ignoring him, aside from a few jibes here and there and Draco almost found himself relaxing. Even if Blaise cautioned time and time again that Nott might be plotting something against him. To him it looked like Theo was busy enough with whatever task Voldemort had set him. He seemed exhausted and stressed out and was likely to snap at anyone who dared to talk to him.
“Draco said you’d probably want to talk to me alone.”
Over the dragon's roars and the crashing of rocks all around he heard Draco shout: “Defodio!” It took him only a moment to realize what the blond was doing and copy him. Together they blasted the ceiling apart. They passed the underground lake and went higher up still, until they finally emerged in the marble hallway, amidst fire and crumbling stone.
The blond sighed again, obviously not pleased with Harry’s lack of knowledge. But he seemed willing to explain. “Your magic is a part of you. You use it every day, often without conscious thought. You use it, but you’re not fully aware of it. Very few wizards and witches are.”
Harry flushed and looked away guiltily. "Sorry. I didn't know it would affect you."
“No, with Snape. Of course with you, you daft prick!”
And suddenly it all clicked into place.
“I don't suppose you have any questions?” Sirius suddenly wanted to know, sobering a little.
“See?” Alice crowed, before asking who had sent the flowers.
Lessons got more demanding too and free periods were mostly used to study and catch up on homework. Being Quidditch Captain was also a lot more work than he'd anticipated, especially with Katie missing from the team. And then there were the private lessons with Dumbledore, which proved a challenge of their own. All this, topped off with the strange new tension between Ron and Hermione had him stressed out after only a few weeks of school.
“Wait a second. Did you talk to Snape?” Remus wanted to know.
“Of course it still stands.” the Gryffindor boy assured.
The Gryffindor nodded. “So... you really mean it? You want to give us a try?” he asked again. Just needing to be sure.
Harry grinned at the memory, before going back to opening presents. His pile seemed to grow with each year. Even Millicent had gotten him something and he was glad that he'd remembered to send her that Herbology book Hermione had suggested. A startled exclamation made him look over at his boyfriend again.
“I do like it. I mean, of course it was hard at first. All those new people and the new school… But the girls were really welcoming. And the best thing is that no-one really knows much about the war. No-one was giving me dark looks because of my family’s allegiance or what I did. I could start over and just be myself. No pressure, no expectations.”
"Don't even try to get up." he warned. "Like I said, you’ve lost a lot of blood. I'm going to levitate you back to the Cottage and put you to bed. You'll be fine in a couple of days, but only if you rest."
“You’ve carried that around with you the whole time?”
“I have to finish my Charms essay, too.” Harry protested with a pout.
Okay, first I want to thank everyone for the lovely reviews.
He had expected them to question or maybe even torture him, but so far they hadn't even looked at him. He'd only seen Wormtail once, when he'd brought Harry a pitcher of water and some stale bread. Aside from that his only company were the oppressing shadows. It was quiet down here. The only sound he heard was that of water dripping onto stone, somewhere to his right.
The blond nodded, staring at the other boy thoughtfully. Maybe he could...
“But, Draco...” Daphne whined.
Both boys turned to Sirius, who rolled his eyes at Dumbledore's dramatics.
His mother had always been a lot cleverer than most people gave her credit for. Even if they read her letters before allowing her to send them, which Draco suspected, she chose her words so carefully they couldn't find anything amiss. Bellatrix would probably think she meant it, when she wrote: It's so nice to have my sister with me again. I enjoy every minute I get to spend with her.
“I know and I would not ask if it wasn't absolutely necessary.”
Then Lavender suggested visiting the Glinting Goods next and Harry looked about ready to start tearing his hair out. Draco, who was used to shopping trips with Pansy and knew how the girls could get, decided to take pity on his friend.
Draco turned and climbed back into bed with him. “I agree.”
“No, I suppose he wouldn't.” the Slytherin had to admit. “He would hate me for it, right?”
Hermione took pity on Draco and urged Harry to open his presents. She had bought him a new Sneakoscope. He also got an enchanted razor, a bunch of Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes products and lots of sweets. Hagrid was pretty much the last guest to arrive. He presented Harry with a small, slightly furry drawstring pouch. “Mokeskin. Hide anythin in there and no-one but the owner can get it out.” he explained and Harry almost immediately started a mental list of things he wanted to put into the pouch.
“It is what it is, Potter. Just accept it. And now I'd really like to sleep, okay?”
“I try to. But I’m still crap at it and it doesn’t always work.”
Sirius shrugged. “Might as well. He’s not going to be dumb enough to try to escape.” He trained his wand on Mundungus and the rope fell away.
Hope you like the new chapter. I tried not to use too much from the book, but I'm not sure if I managed it.
“The point?”
“Right. The fucking rat… Oh, I know. The Hog’s Head!”
Both boys were quiet for a long while. Finally Harry pulled something out of his pocket.
“Ginny, I thought you’d already be in bed.”
"You can borrow the mirror if you want. To talk to your mum, you know. I'm sure Sirius wouldn't mind her using his."
“And if they send you to Azkaban?” he asked shakily.
“It's more the embarrassment I'm worried about.”
“Won't matter to some people.”
Shifting slightly Harry became aware of the mess in his pants. He bit his lip and felt his face heat. Thankfully Draco was blushing as well. The blond pulled out his wand and cast a quick cleaning spell on them both. “Thanks.” the younger boy muttered sheepishly, climbing off his lap to sit beside him.
Voldemort’s power was growing steadily, which meant that they rarely heard any news of the outside world. It was too dangerous to contact other members of the Order.  Most of them had gone into hiding as well. Harry knew that the Weasley's were all in hiding, just like Tonks and her family. And they'd heard rumours that Hagrid had fled to the mountains, after the death eaters had tried to capture him.
“Okay. So what exactly do we have in common? Besides Slytherin roommates.” he wanted to know.
By then Harry was completely fed up with everything and it was probably only sheer luck that his powers hadn't whacked out yet. Well that and the antidote to the Doxy bite, which would dampen his magic for a few hours, according to Madam Pomfrey. He just wanted to collapse on his bed and wait for this horrible day to be over.
He rounded the corner and nearly collided with Nott and two sulky looking girls. The other boy sneered at him.
And okay, that could actually work. What did he have to lose anyway?
“Just tell them to get it over with and shag already.” the blond advised, rolling his eyes at the surprised look the other boy gave him. “Come on, everyone can see that they fancy each other. It's so painfully obvious.”
“Great. Get your coat.”
Potter stopped right next to their table, staring down at him. Draco felt himself blushing, remembering all the things Potter had overheard a few days ago. When he'd been spying on him. Rage replaced his embarrassment. But before he could tell Potter off, Astoria beat him to it.
They glanced at each other and erupted into a new fit of giggles.
“So... you're saying that … these things only happen, because I've got more power now?” Harry asked.
Harry just laughed. It was nice to know that they were still the same boys they had always been. Hermione would frown at them trading insults like this, but to him it felt normal. And it wasn't said with malice, like in their earlier years. Now it was just fun, joking around with each other, riling each other up a bit. It was just their dynamic and he doubted that would ever change.
Startled by the voice he turned in the opposite direction.
“Stupefy!”
Suddenly a high, cold voice echoed throughout the hall. It seemed to issue from the walls themselves. Students screamed and looked around in fright, as Voldemort told them that he knew they were preparing to fight and that they wouldn't stand a chance.
“Search fast.” he urged.
Harry finally lifted his head. “Not at all, Lavender. Barge right in. No need to knock or anything.”
“No-one is forcing you to come.” he animagus reminded.
“Expecto patronum. Expecto patronum.”
Before he could panic there was another loud crack and Dobby appeared with Ron, who was carrying an unconscious Hermione. She looked horribly pale, had various cuts and scratches all over her face and blood was dripping from her arm. Ron looked pretty scratched up as well. They had both been very close when the chandelier had come down.
“Remember when we hid my potions book?”
Harry only laughed.
She got up and walked over, taking a seat next to him on the couch and placing a hand on his shoulder.
“So it means that I have to kill Voldemort or he'll kill me?”
“I think I saw a couple of brooms in there.” Tonks piped up.
“There you go, little dragon. Do you want uncle Sirius to read you a bedtime story?”
Harry and Ron shared a grin as the Lovegoods entered the marquee.
Deciding to throw caution to the wind, Harry lunged for the tiara.
“Harry always thinks that he has to do anything by himself. He thinks it's his job to save us all, you know? That's just who he is. He's very brave. But sometimes he's not very smart. You have to tell him that you're worried.”
Andromeda's voice had taken on a shrill tone. He only now realized that she had called his name a few times already and that she had backed away from him. And finally he noticed the dark waves of magic rising all around him. It was happening again. He'd been an idiot to think that it wouldn't. The picture frames on the wall rattled and he could still see Andromeda's lips moving, but he couldn't understand a word.
"Good. We'd better get going then. I'd say it's at least a ten minute walk to the Cottage. But I didn't want to take us closer while there was a chance we were being followed."
“Your Potions book went flying and you smashed a bottle of pumpkin juice. Which should probably teach you not to leave your stuff lying about. But that's it.” Draco claimed.
“So you really love me back?” Harry asked in wonder.
Sirius clearly itched to do something. He kept telling them that the plan was good enough and urging them to just put it into action already. Harry unfortunately agreed with him. Thankfully Remus kept a level head and insisted that they needed more time to prepare. He was also doing a pretty good job of keeping his boyfriend in line. Draco only wished his methods wouldn’t involve things like blowjobs in the kitchen. It really wasn’t funny anymore how often he’d walked in on the two men. And while he wasn't as much of a prude as Ron, who turned the most interesting shades of red whenever he caught them in the act, Draco still had no desire to see that much of his cousin, thank you very much.
Their first stop was the cottage where Harry's parents had died. Draco was shocked that people had decided to leave the ruin standing and even put up a sign. His shock grew when he realized how many people had visited the site. It seemed morbid to him for strangers to come and have a look at the destroyed house. The graffiti and well-wishes they had left behind made him shudder. But they also explained why no-one gave them a second look. People thought they were just another pair of tourists.
The younger boy sat down on the bed and took his hand. “Me neither. I only snogged Cho a few times. So I guess we're on the same level here.” he assured. Draco looked up and there was no mistaking the relief on his face.
They had tea and then Hagrid showed him the Nifflers he had acquired for his next Care of Magical Creatures class. "Been thinkin bout getting an Erumpent next." he told Harry. "But McGonagall wouldn't allow it. Said it was too dangerous."
“You could have tried poetry.”
Harry wasn't sure if Draco heard him or if he sensed his approach through the bond. But all of a sudden the blond whirled around and pointed his wand at him. He resisted the urge to draw his own wand, knowing full well that it could only end badly and instead held up his hands in a placating gesture.
Draco caught Sirius’ eye and nodded. He wanted to be there as well. Possible danger quite aside, this visit would be hard for Harry. To finally see the home he'd lost. Maybe even visit his parents' grave. Harry might need him. And he also hoped that his rationalism would balance the recklessness of the two Gryffindors. At least a little.
"Alright, I'll try. But if it backfires, I'm blaming you."
“Breakfast has barely started.” the Slytherin pointed out. “Why are you in such a hurry? It's usually a lot later when I finally manage to drag your arse out of bed and down to the great hall.”
“He might.” Snape agreed in a strangely detached way. “But so far he doesn’t suspect me. I will tell him that the Order showed up out of the blue. I was no match for them, so instead of fighting a losing battle I choose to flee and return to his side. He will not question this.” He seemed confident in his plan.
“How is France?” Draco asked.
“And Brown’s parents? Do they know?”
“At first he just looked … sort of sick. And I think his eyes flashed red once. But in the other memory his skin was so white and his features were sort of … blurry. I don't know. It was just weird.”
“Your hair looks really nice like that.”
Hermione then asked Harry about the new professor. He told them that Slughorn was obviously trying to surround himself with famous students and that he had bragged about all the important people he knew.
“No, I don’t. Please stay out of it.”
The three Gryffindors turned to grin at Millicent and congratulate her and she blushed as well.
Remus still wasn’t happy about it. And of course both Ron and Hermione protested against being left behind. But in the end they all had to give in and agree to the plan. Sirius, Harry and Draco would do this alone. They would use Polyjuice again and leave in the evening, when there’d be hopefully less people around. First they would look for a likely hiding spot and if they couldn’t find the sword they’d try to contact Bathilda Bagshot.
“I'm sure we can.” Granger answered.
The injured were being treated by Madam Pomfrey and her helpers on the platform. The dead were lying in a row in the middle of the hall. Draco saw Mad-Eye Moody and a sixth year Slytherin girl he knew from the DA meetings among them. And the little Gryffindor, who had loved to bother people with his camera. He quickly averted his eyes, afraid of seeing anyone else he knew.
"What did he want?" Sirius asked.
There was a strange, hissing sound from the sitting room. Draco jumped. Sirius squinted at the door with a frown. Harry, though, seemed unperturbed. “It’s okay. She’s just an old lady.” he insisted and entered the room.
“But how did you get in here?“ Harry wanted to know.
“But...”
“Don't look at me like that! I didn't do that. One moment I'm walking back from Hogsmeade, minding my own business and the next I get attacked from behind. And then I wake up here, chained to you.”
Harry merely blinked up at him, too tired to offer a comeback. He was so tired of fighting. Of running. He had no strength left.
“You don’t have to.” Draco assured softly.
A sharp little cry startled him out of his musings. His mother was on her feet in an instant, giving him a smile.
Nothing ever worked. The two boys were getting increasingly frustrated.
Again she looked at all of them in turn, though her eyes lingered on Draco the longest.
“When my magic lashes out, I have no control over it. I can't stop it. But you... I don't know how you do it, but you help me control it. You know exactly what to do to keep me calm. When we met earlier, I was seconds from losing control. And you helped me. Just like you did at Andromeda's. I never managed to stop it before.”
“We need to get out of here!” Hermione yelled.
"Hey there, hot stuff." a low, gravelly voice reached his ears. Draco blinked in surprise.
"Are you okay?"
“Perfect. I didn't fancy putting on yesterday's clothes.”
“He was always an ugly git. So?”
“But he is in love with you. I'm sure of it. And he'd realise it if you were to court him a little more openly.”
"Have you… heard from your godfather yet?"
“A bit.” Harry said. “It's still ... sort of unreal.”
“I just want to go to my room and you're blocking my way!”
“Don’t worry. We’ll manage.” Sirius said confidently.
“Why he called her that awful name? I’m not sure. I guess it’s got something to do with hurt pride. And I’m sure he regretted it.”
“Are you sure?” Remus checked.
“She said no visitors. So if you don't mind, I think I'd like to lie down for a while to recover from the shock.”
"Yaxley grabbed him just as I apparated us out, which means that he got taken along." Remus said with a grimace. "As soon as we landed here, Sirius apparated them away." Which explained the scuffling sound and the crack earlier.
Voldemort still wasn’t showing himself openly, which only fuelled the fear, uncertainty and suspicion among the wizarding public. The Ministry was now firmly in his hands. Minister Scrimgeour had been tortured and killed and replaced with a man named Pius Thicknesse, who was supposedly under the Imperius curse. Harry was a wanted man. The Ministry claimed to be looking for him to question him about the death of Dumbledore. Also new was the Muggle-born Register. All Muggle-borns were forced to come to the Ministry and prove that they had wizarding ancestors. Otherwise they were accused of having obtained their powers by theft or force.
Great. So pretty much anyone in his house had known that he was bent. And Pansy had scared them all into keeping their mouths shut. That definitely sounded like his best friend and he felt a wave of gratitude towards her. Wizarding society didn’t really mind same-sex relationships. Even purebloods believed in the age-old practice of turning a blind eye. But it was a different matter if you were the only heir of an old pureblood family. And quite another matter for a female member of the sacred 28.
That smile was quickly wiped off his face once he stepped onto the pitch. The weather had gotten even worse. The steady downpour of cold water had him drenched within minutes and the wind had picked up as well, making it hard to keep his broom steady. Millicent didn't seem to care. She flew around the pitch with a bright grin, whacking bludgers left and right. Draco decided to stay well away from her.
Again the elves nodded.
“What is it? Do you see someone?” the blond whispered.
"I'm spending it with mother and aunt Andromeda, I guess." the Slytherin said with a shrug. "Though I hope to meet up with Pansy as well. She's coming home for Christmas."
“And what are we supposed to do?” Seamus asked.
"What happened? And why is there a ... dog - at least I guess that's what it is - in your basket?"
He was cut off when they rounded the corner and nearly ran into Blaise, who was obviously trying to make it back to the dorms before curfew.
Harry's arms gave out and he collapsed onto the mattress Draco slumped down on top of him. For long moments they just laid there, their heavy breathing the only sound. Harry shuddered when Draco's softening cock slipped out of him, leaving him feeling strangely empty.
"Ahhhh! Get away from me, you dirty little beast!" she screeched loudly, pushing him off. "Look at my dress. It's ruined. Disgusting, filthy creature!"
Once again Harry slept poorly, plagued by nightmares of Voldemort and awoke tired and grumpy. He managed not to take his bad mood out on his fellow Gryffindors this time, but he couldn't refrain from scowling at Draco. Especially when the Slytherin kept sneaking curious glances at him all through breakfast. Probably wondering if Harry had realized yet that he'd been made a fool of.
“Wait here, until we’ve talked to her. Then we’ll see how to proceed.”
I know I said something about a longer chapter last time. And I had planned a longer one. But then I thought it would make more sense to split it. So you'll get a short chapter now and another one in a couple of days.
“I have a bad feeling about this.” he finally voiced his concern aloud.
Remus wondered if Tonks had gotten her mother to coach her, because as far as he could tell, her impersonation of Bellatrix was flawless. It was a little scary, if he was honest. He held his breath while the goblin took his time examining the key and let it out in a soft whoosh when the tiny creature finally nodded.
“But I actually like Dobby.” Harry protested. “I have no idea how I feel about Kreacher now. I mean, I sort of pity him, after what he told us today. But then he goes and calls Hermione mudblood and stuff like that and I get why Sirius doesn’t like him.”
Draco’s first urge was to dismiss her and stalk off to his room. Show her how it felt when ones housemates turned their back on you. But the strange look in her blue eyes stopped him. So instead of running away, he crossed his arms over his chest and gave her a cold stare.
"You trust too easily." the Slytherin muttered. His only answer was a snort.
“A bunch of Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs.” Draco snorted in disgust. “So much for sweet and friendly Hufflepuffs, huh?”
“Look at his face, Harry.”
His tone was quiet and yet so commanding that Harry found himself obeying without second thought. He took a shaky breath and let it out. His lungs were protesting, but he forced himself to take another breath and another. Malfoy kept his strong hold on Harry's arms and kept talking in that low, intense tone.
Draco rolled his eyes. Harry could see that he was more shaken up than he wanted to admit. “Well, that was fun. But someone else can do the next one.”
“Well, well… if it isn’t the little Malfoy heir.” the werewolf drawled with a grin.
Over the next two weeks Draco spent most of his time with Blaise and Millicent or Harry and his friends. The other Slytherins kept eyeing him strangely, like they didn't know what to make of him now. Draco had really been something like the prince of Slytherin house for the past couple of years, mostly because of his family's standing. Now that he'd been disinherited the other students were obviously unsure where that left him.
Harry felt a wave of gratitude.
“She trained to become a mind healer after graduating from Hogwarts. But when she married father  he forced her to quit. Obviously it's unbecoming for the wife of a Malfoy to work.” he sounded bitter and for a fleeting moment Harry wondered if he even missed his father.
"What the hell is wrong with you?!"
“Potions essay.”
He was surprised when Harry didn't let go of his hand. Glancing up he found the Gryffindor staring at him. "The cursed necklace - that was you."
“What the hell are you doing?!” Remus yelled hysterically.
Remus shook his head and raised his wand again. “Homenum revelio.”
“Only fair.” Draco agreed. “We all had a go already.” And once had been more than enough for his liking.
“Good. I want you to get comfortable. Close your eyes and focus on your breathing, like you do when you meditate.”
“Yeah? How fine?”
“He would never hate you. But he wouldn't be pleased.”
“Well, Moony figured it was high time I gave you the Talk. But judging from the sounds I heard coming from my little cousins room last night, I guess I'm a little late for that.”
“Dumbledore wanted Snape to tell me. At the last moment...” He swallowed hard, like it pained him to remember what he'd seen in Snape's memories. “There's another Horcrux. One even Voldemort himself doesn't know about.”
And amid a smattering of applause, joyous cries and a round of wolf whistles, Harry and Draco shared their first kiss as a married couple.
“I can’t sleep like this.”
“Yes, since Christmas eve was yesterday, we're having Christmas lunch today, Harry.” the red-head explained slowly, like talking to a child and then broke into laughter again at the glare the dark-haired boy sent him.
“It means that Slytherin is associated with the Dark Lord now. People will be wary, possibly even hostile towards all Slytherins this year. So if Blaise and Daphne want to have any chance of being accepted, they need to distance themselves from me.”
"Let's take turns. Make sure no-one wears it longer than four or five hours at a time and be sure to take it off before you go to bed. You're more vulnerable in sleep and so more likely to be affected."
When they finally reached the hospital wing the first thing Harry saw was Neville, lying in a bed near the door, apparently asleep. Millicent was sitting at his side, holding his hand. She gave them a shaky smile, before focusing her attention back on the boy in the bed.
A little helplessly Harry pointed his wand at him and muttered: “Imperio.” Again he felt the strange sensation as the curse took hold and the goblin's eyes became distant. He looked over at Draco, who nodded.
Slowly the tightness in his chest was lessening. It was getting easier to breathe. Harry still felt cold and he was still shaking, but the panic was subsiding. And so was his magic. The dark tendrils flickered and faded away. He swayed on the spot and Malfoy's hold on him tightened.
Harry just continued to stare at the gravestone for what felt like minutes. “But they’re not living.” he whispered finally. “They’re dead. It’ just empty words.”
“Me too.” Draco decided.
Harry was glad that he had agreed to visit Hagrid with Ron and Hermione. He hated not talking to the half-giant and was relieved that they had managed to make up. But he still would have liked to watch the Slytherin try-outs and offer some moral support. Therefore he hurried to catch up to Draco after lunch. They headed outside with Ron, Hermione and Millicent, who by now had become a member of their group. Harry found that he liked the quiet girl.
A timid knock at the door made him look up.
“He and Longbottom got an invitation from the new teacher, Slughorn.”
“No. I can't...” his voice broke and Draco scooted closer.
“Now we can't have that.” Potter said with a grin.
“I believe the headmaster is going to send them to the Forbidden Forest with that oaf of a groundskeeper Dumbledore was so fond of.”
“And…?”
“Makes sense. If you ignore the fact that she took Weasley with her.” the Slytherin noted.
Finally Harry's lips twitched. “Okay, maybe it was a bit funny.”
“That’s good. I guess you’ll both be feeling the after-effects for a couple of days. Harry more so than you.”
“Okay.”
Left alone with his thoughts he could do nothing but wait. Surely they had alerted Voldemort to his capture. Soon he would be here and then … Harry would be dead. Everything would be lost. And it was his fault. All his fault. Because he had been stupid. So incredibly stupid. He should have listened to Hermione.
For the first time he realized what going back to Hogwarts would mean for him. He was a misfit now. The former prince of Slytherin had become an outcast. No-one would talk to him. No-one would sit with him. He would be all alone, without any friends. But it wasn't like he had a choice here.
Draco took a seat at the end of the table, unsurprised that the other Slytherins kept their distance. He had known that this year was going to be a difficult one. His encounter with Blaise on the train had shown him just how difficult. But he was determined to make it through. He had no other choice, really, since it was part of his parole. But he would have come back anyway, he thought.
He shook his head and sighed to himself. He really needed to figure out what was going on with the Gryffindor. Maybe he could corner him later and make him talk. With that thought in mind he got up and started getting ready for the day.
Harry grinned back. “Thank you, Sirius.”
“Well, if you feel that you need to visit the Weasleys, but you don’t really want to spend the whole break with them, you could just drop by for a day or two and spend the rest of Christmas break at Andromedas.”
When Harry finally left St. Mungo's (with a full bottle of Calming Draught, as well as a bottle of Dreamless Sleep potion, but without having made an appointment with Maggie or any other mind healer) it was already getting dark. He sighed in defeat when he found Ron and Hermione waiting for him in the kitchen at Grimmauld Place. He should have known.
“I just hope I don't make a fool of myself at the first game.” she mumbled shyly.
“Sure it is. Back in our Hogwarts days James and I often set out with less.”
Draco rolled his eyes and finished getting ready while Harry continued to fidget beside him. When they left their room he studiously ignored the blond, staring straight ahead. As soon as they reached the great hall he headed for the Gryffindor table, taking a seat between Neville and Lavender and starting a heated discussion with them.
“Yes. I‘m very lucky. And I love you, too. Of course I’ll marry you.”
They joined the queue of students heading down to the village. Since it was a regular Hogsmeade weekend there were quite a lot of people, though Draco suspected that the dark clouds obscuring the sky prevented at least some of the older years from going. The walk was pleasant enough, despite the chilly wind and seemed shorter than he remembered.
"I couldn't change back."
“Because you're not trying hard enough.” the blond complained.
“We’re all fine.” Harry answered, before asking what had taken the two man this long.
“Spend time with you. Occasionally. Don’t worry, just as friends. I have zero interest in you.” she assured.
By the time he finally made it down to the Quidditch pitch, Harry was just wrapping up practice. While he tried to wrestle the bludgers back into their box, his team-mates made their way past Draco to the changing rooms.
“I do say so.”
But then, all of a sudden, the death eaters stopped their attacks and started retreating. And then, for the second time that night, Voldemort's cold, hissing tones filled the air, reverberating from the walls around them.
“What? But that's stupid. Just because she's dating a girl?”
“And the others are okay? Luna and Dean? And Mr. Ollivander?” Harry checked.
"Malfoy fainted, too." Ron added.
His protest was cut off when Potter grabbed his arm to haul him closer and then smashed his lips against Draco's. Caught off guard the blond did the only sensible thing. He returned the kiss.
"What the horcrux showed you... you know that were only lies, right?" Harry checked.
Thanks for the lovely Reviews. And sorry I made you wait so long for the next chapter. I've been pretty busy with work. Of course more comments might inspire me to write faster next time....
“I know what you mean. Of course we believe what we’ve been taught all our lives. Usually you don’t question your parents. You look up to them. Unless something happens that makes you question them. And then it still takes time to realize that maybe what you’ve been taught was wrong.”
“Thank you.” Luna said, giving both of them a brilliant smile. “It's good that you read it, Harry. I know how prone you are to attracting Wrackspurts. You should really take some precautions.”
“Sometimes I really hate you.” he grumbled.
"No. He's going with the Weasel and Granger. He always does." Draco protested.
“But you didn't say it.”
“We've really got to continue the DA. Snape will never let me pass exams.” Neville nearly begged from his seat across from Harry.
Malfoy grinned. “No? That's a pity. You'll never find out what I'm doing then. And you won't be able to stop me. Can you really live with that? I could be up to something nefarious.”
“A lot of people felt that daddy should publish more interviews, however. Like the one with Harry. Maybe you want to tell the truth about your father? I'm sure daddy would be happy to publish it.” she suddenly changed the topic.
"Let's put it somewhere safe. Hide it."
"Sorry for being a dick earlier." That comment earned him a small smile.
Harry was tempted to agree. Having a drink actually sounded nice. But he knew that it would only draw out the inevitable. He was wound up. Buzzing with nervous energy. Had been all day. He just wanted to get it over with now.
“Room of requirement.”
He took off down the hall and she followed him, trying to stifle the urge to ask why he was taking her to her room and not Harry. It would be terribly rude. But it seemed that Neville knew her too well.
“You were unconscious and …” Draco’s voice broke and Harry felt a surge of panic.
“Don't overestimate yourself, Nott. You're hardly that interesting.” Draco shot back.
“Your godfather felt it necessary to get in a few hexes.” Remus explained testily.
“Rough weekend?” Draco asked.
“Well I don't want that, okay?!”
Draco sat down next to him. “A little, maybe. I guess we both are. For different reasons.”
“R.A.B. - Regulus Arcturus Black. Of course!”
James Potter, born 27 March 1960, died 31 October 1981
“You know, that might be an idea. I did have fun with the DA. I'll ask Dumbledore if it would be okay.” Harry decided, before starting a conversation about Quidditch.
"Don't worry. You won't get rid of me that easily."
Draco managed to talk him out of it every time, mostly by pointing out that Harry and him were still weakened by the ritual and that he was supposed to stay here and protect them. But he feared they would have to chain him down if the others didn’t return soon. Of course he could relate. If Harry went on a mission without him he’d go nuts as well. Unfortunately that didn’t make it any easier to deal with the irritating animagus.
“Where's Harry?” Draco asked in a hushed whisper.
He listened half-heartedly to his friends, who agreed with Snape and told him to be careful. They had a free period right after lunch, which they spent in the library, doing homework, before Draco and Millicent headed off to double Herbology with the Ravenclaws.
“Can’t do anything without your pet Slytherin these days, can you?”
Okay, that didn’t sound too bad. Yes, the forest was full of dangerous creatures, but Hagrid knew the terrain well. He would make sure nothing happened to them. Draco only hoped they would learn their lesson and not try anything stupid like that again. Although, knowing Ginny, she most likely wouldn’t. She was as bull-headed as her brother.
And indeed he did. He’d been surprised at first, but Draco took studying very seriously. There was a reason why he’d always been top of most classes, right behind Hermione. Harry had just never cared enough to notice. Maybe he hadn’t wanted to see it, since it wouldn’t have fit with the picture of the evil, spoiled brat he’d had.
“But do you really think he’s going to do something about it, once he realizes that he has feelings for you? If he even realizes it.”
"I don't want to kill." he whispered.
“Oh, relax, will you? I’m not here to hit on you, if that’s what you’re worried about.”
“Something wrong, Lavender?” the dark-haired boy asked.
Harry felt like his insides had turned to ice. Distantly he heard Draco whispering: "No! Merlin, please no." The blond pulled him closer, like he wanted to shield him from the truth of what they'd just witnessed and Harry wrapped an arm around him. Numbly he continued to watch the scene unfold.
But he never got the chance, because after breakfast Harry suddenly announced: “I want to go to Godric’s Hollow.”
Draco had never been so happy to see Sirius and Remus.
"Always."
“It has its merits.”
“About what?”
"No! You're not going back. They'll kill you." Draco objected.
The stared at each other for a moment and the blond had to fight the urge to lean over and kiss him. Keeping this a secret was going to be harder than he'd thought.
A roaring noise was all the warning he got. He turned and saw both Crabbe and Ron running towards him. Flames of abnormal size were pursuing them, burning down everything in their wake.
“Of course we're going to fight. As much as I enjoy kissing you, there are still times I'd rather punch you in the face.”
The lessons of the day dragged on, starting with DADA, where he somehow managed to insult Snape – again - and land himself in detention - again. Followed by Charms, where he accidentally sent a table flying at Seamus, because he couldn't concentrate properly. Luckily the Irishman managed to duck at the last second.
“You should.”
“No. She's brave.” Harry argued. “And like Sirius said, she switched it. No-one is going to notice, right?”
"Make sure to get some soon. I sensed a Wrackspurt in the room just now. It had obviously gotten you."
“Of course not. I don't expect you to.”
“I can understand why she's your best friend.” he commented later, when they were just about to go to bed. “She's really fun to be around. I never would have guessed.”
“You won't.”
“You're right.” Harry agreed, glancing down.
Shocked silence followed Draco’s words. Remus was shaking his head in disbelief, Hermione looked about ready to cry and Ron had gone so pale that his freckles stood out sharply in contrast. Draco looked over at Harry, who was just sort of standing there, as if frozen.
They got into the next lift, where they, by some stroke of luck, ran into Ron and Remus. Both of them were completely soaked and reported that it was still raining in Yaxley's office. Before they could form a new plan however, the lift doors opened again and Mr. Weasley got in. He unknowingly had a pleasant conversation with his son and even suggested a spell to stop the rain. Ron looked about ready to bolt out of the lift and try it, but Remus stopped him.
"Anytime." Draco said just as quietly.
But before they could even start looking for the exit, they heard Hermione scream in panic close by. She and Ron came running towards them, with Crabbe on their heels. But it wasn’t Crabbe they were running away from. Following in his wake were flames of abnormal size, burning down everything in their wake. Draco realized immediately that this was no ordinary fire. It was too wild. Too uncontrolled. The flames looked as if they were alive.
