Harry shook his head. In their fourth year there had been a photo taken of them hugging in the Champions tent — but Dumbledore had made it vanish like smoke. A few had also been taken at the Yule Ball — but they probably were still at Hogwarts, stored in an old book to remember the memories of the Triwizard Tournament. 'We never thought of taking any,' he replied her. 'Can I—'
; you're making me dizzy,' Draco complained as Harry came to a halt, kissed him and threw him one of his beautiful smiles.
All the girls were dressed in shades of blue as well, and as their usual blue group they took a step closer to Draco to inspect every little detail of his robes. His parents knew the finest tailor of France and together with magic his robes had become just how he had envisioned them in his head. He had been inspired by the robes princes wore in fairytales and could happily say that he felt just like one that evening.
that the French school was about. The only positive news was that Umbridge wasn't planning on staying at Beauxbatons herself; had her hands full with Hogwarts and therefore would lay all her faith in the hands of Madame Maxime.
And Harry… well, Harry seemed lost. He just stood there; looking at nothing and with a complete blank face. He was wearing his house's colors, red and gold, even though Draco knew non of its other students supported the poor boy. When a dragon's growl resounded, Harry flinched and lifted up a part of the tent's canvas to take a look outside. Draco also noticed that Harry wanted Dumbledore's attention but didn't seem to get it; the old Headmaster was lost in a deep conversation with Madame Maxime and nothing or nobody seemed to be able to snap him out of it.
Madame Maxime seemed very tired from the day's events. Her eyelids looked heavy and the smile she had held before started to fade away. She wiped a hand across her forehead and rose from the sofa again. '
But Harry himself had just rolled his eyes and opened the old book again. It concerned Draco a little with how much time Harry seemed to spend with reading the scribbles in the book. Draco himself had read a few pages but had found nothing special besides some notes that corrected the way of creating a potion — things he had known himself already. Was there something he hadn't seen? Was there something that was interesting to Harry but not to him?
Madame Maxime had visited him later that night and had been as furious as the girls; but had understood the reason even better than any of them. Draco had already trusted her with his father's secret, his past, in his first year. It had actually been his mother's idea to tell her, to trust her. And it had been a good idea, it now appeared. Madame had told him not to worry, that she would protect him if things would become different now. But Draco had declined her help, knowing that there was no escape to facing his father this summer again; he knew he had to face him in order to protect his mother. She also had offered to fix his hair, bring it back to it's original length. But that had been another offer Draco had declined; he never wanted to resemble his father again.
know. With his arms locked with Harry's — whom still seemed exhausted from the swim — they hiked up a small hill and formed a circle amidst the trees. Before they knew, they were gone again — and landed a few moments later in another forest that could have been exactly the same, if it hadn't been for a small river that ran a few feet away from them. 'I've hiked through this forest with my parents once,' Hermione explained, taking a glance over her shoulder at the small river. 'It's not too far from Hogsmeade, actually.'
'I—' Harry started but Draco hushed him, his index finger pressed against Harry's slightly bruised lips.
'Then why does it smell like a mix of lemons and lavender in here?' Looking around the classroom with a pair of frowned eyebrows of himself, his green eyes caught Draco's presence; standing next to his head of house and being the center of attention. 'Draco?' the boy stammered in the same way he had done at the Ministry. It took him a few seconds and at least three blinks of his eyes before believing that his French lover was actually there. He then made his way through the classroom, pushing people aside as if using the spell Bombardia and throwing his arms around Draco as if he hadn't seen him in years. 'What are you doing here?'
A room three times the size of Bellatrix' vault appeared in front of their eyes; filled with a mix of gold, silver and bronze. There even were a few items colored in that of gemstones, placed next to furniture pieces and a giant statue of a horse. 'Wow,' Ron let out. 'Bloody hell, Draco, I knew you were rich but—
'I've never heard you agree with me that fast, Gellert. Perhaps I should use this technique more often when you're rambling on again,' young Dumbledore said to him.
Potter's hand feels warm and comforting on Draco's wrist, even though the grip is quite tight. But he loosens his grip, sliding his hand softly over Draco's skin and taking his hand in his. Pressing firmly into Draco's palm he whispers,'don't worry, you're not alone in this, alright? Believe it or not but I care about you.'
'Harry?' he shot upright, stared around, unaware of where he was. It was so dark and his heart was beating so fast.
voice; Voldemort was whispering to him that he should cast the terrible spells he had been thinking about — that he knew what they were called and exactly how to cast them.
A silence followed as Harry was lost for words and of what to do. Was there really only one option for Draco? For him to go home? 'I wish I could do something,' Harry then said. 'But I realize as well that there will be no hiding; not for either of us.'
busy and not in the mood to answer any questions. Pushing through anyway, the duo managed to get all the information they needed; or at least, the information they could have access to.
Well, it obviously didn't look that much better but Harry believed Dumbledore's words above those of others — even that of himself sometimes.
'The return of Voldemort, of course. Why don't you go ask him yourself, Dolores? I'm sure he'll gladly tell you all the details.'
At exactly that moment he got pulled out of Snape's head; back into his scruffy Potions classroom. The professor looked disheveled and worn out, took ahold of the table behind him and seemed to be panting of exhausting. 'Sir, I—,' Harry began but Snape raised a hand to silence him.
His mother reached out a hand, and even though Draco would've liked nothing more than to push it away, he needed the support. Holding on to her while taking the tiniest steps, he could feel the scars move all over his body; ready to rip again. It hurt as badly as thousands of knives stabbing through one's figure — their blades burning with the flames of hell. Draco bit his teeth, unwilling to let any of that pain be noticeable on his face. Narcissa let her fingers slide through her son's hair to fix it a little, after they had managed to cross the hallway and walk down the stairs. Sad eyes, ones from a woman whom had nearly given up.
Emerald carpet under his feet. A wide staircase, curved to the left. Malfoy Manor looks just the same as it did five years ago. At least, the entrance hall does. Of course Harry doesn’t remember it very well; but he remembers the carpet, the atmosphere when they’d been dragged inside and held captive in the Manor’s cellar for a little while. The cold feeling still lingers around too, making goosebumps appear on his arms.
, said with his calm voice now a little less calm. His eyes were set worried, and as he frowned his white eyebrows, he seemed to inspect every inch of Harry's face. "You are a very strange boy, Harry.
were afraid that the trust wouldn’t last; that there would be no other solution than to leave England.
, he said to himself. A little creature inside him however, planted there by Voldemort himself, seemed to cheer at the announcement of his task nearing. 'How do you know?' Draco asked.
Keeping his mouth shut, Harry finally manages to look away from Malfoy's stormy eyes. Eyes on his tea again, he looks at the small reflection of himself in the hot liquid. It would be silly to tell Malfoy he was thinking about him, wouldn't it? Of course he could tell him he was thinking about his cursed arm; that would be easy to believe. But he had waited to long to reply with such an answer; it had became an easy lie. Malfoy's pale right hand appears in Harry's vision, hovering besides his tea cup and then slowly touching his hand with his long fingers.
Harry sighs. “You have to trust someone.” Malfoy nods, but his eyes show him an uncertainty still. Harry could almost hear an inner battle going on in his head; should he trust Harry, his enemy? His opposite? But, didn't Malfoy already trust Harry with his life? “The fact that I saw your arm last week, your
He had to stop; catch for breath and focus his mind. He tried to listen for any movement, but the beating of his heart in his ears made the quiet grounds around him sound loud and busy. How badly he wished he was now the one to have a timepiece that would lead him to Harry.
It all went so fast, the fall, just like it had done the first time. As he fell he looked up into the terrified eyes of Harry, already diving down his way to catch up with the blond. But Draco fell so fast and all the brave Gryffindor boy could think of was to just jump the last few feet as well, throw his arms around the boy and break his fall. And then everything suddenly went black. Draco could still hear the sound of rustling leafs but he couldn't see the trees anymore. At least, for a few minutes. His vision came back sooner than he had thought it would, leaving a terrible headache behind. He noticed he was panting, exhaustion kicking in again and spreading through his body like wildfire. Draco lifted his head a little and saw that Harry's arm was still tightly wrapped around his chest, still protecting him from getting hurt.
Draco thought to himself. Imagining Harry sleeping in the same room as his fiery best friend and the gay couple he had seen earlier wasn't really the ideal situation to him either.
They followed Umbridge all the way to Knockturn Alley and into a dodgy looking pub, black wooden furniture covering the cramped space and red candles giving the whole place a macabre twist. She walked straight to a man, a hood covering his face and took out her handkerchief, unfolded it and placed it upon the crooked chair's seat. With her toad-like face leaning closer to the man, it became difficult for Draco and Harry to hear her voice — even though they had moved as close to the table as they could, holding their breaths. 'You are not trying hard enough! People are starting to speculate things — starting to turn to
Draco placed his pillow on top of his head, tried to bury his thoughts away with it, but of course it didn't work. After another few minutes he finally gave up and jumped out of bed, headed for the door. The common room was deserted and all portraits were asleep, snoring loudly with peaceful expressions on their painted faces. Draco turned himself towards the portrait of Raphael, whom had his face rested upon his single hand.
'Harry! Hermione! Ron!' Voices shouted, picking up their earlier noise. No-one seemed to welcome Draco though, but he got a few glares to make up for it. Had they still not realized that he was nothing alike to his father? That he wasn't to be associated to the Dark Lord?
Harry had given up glancing over at Draco during meal-times and eventually even stopped showing up. Of course it worried Draco; what if the boy was slowly starving himself out of stress and loneliness?
because they simply were. He himself had tried to dress up a little more decently for another visit to the blond as he felt too professional in his Auror robes the previous time. But his burgundy pair couldn't compete with Malfoy's tailored ones. Shiny silver buttons and those delicate snakes, hiding within the seams.
'I couldn't,' Draco admitted. He quickly glanced at Harry and his friends whom had drifted off from the three best friends; were inspecting every little corner of the room as if to find their headmaster returned underneath a sock. '
Draco let out a deep sigh and read Harry's letter again; at least Dumbledore had managed to escape. His prediction had come true though; the Ministry was now officially after the Headmaster with a reason — with the evidence they needed.
Draco felt heat rise to his head at Ron's words. He knew very well who Cho Chang was. Ravenclaw seeker, beautiful girl with Asian eyes and hair as black as that of a raven. Beside from a sudden anger he also felt disappointed and almost… heartbroken. 'Oh,' he could only manage to say as he looked at his feet.
the sound of his head hitting the sloped ceiling above his bed. Stretching of limps, muscles slowly losing their tensity. Making his way now through his room, Harry searched for the light switch in the dark; so conveniently placed as far away from the bed as it could be. The tiny space lit up instantly, and tiredly Harry blinked with his emerald green eyes. His room was shaped like that of a triangle, as the Dursleys had appointed the old, dusty attic to become his room all those years ago. Harry'd tried to make it a little less sober by hanging a variety of old scarfs he'd found on the two sloped sides of the room. It had brought some well-needed color into the dull place.
Harry Potter seemed to agree, nodding his head while keeping his eyes locked in Draco's. It was almost as if Draco had enchanted him with only a few words. 'And what is your name,
"Good morning, Draco darling. Did you sleep well?" She lifts up her grey eyes from the paper and stares at her son with the look of a concerned woman.
With a kiss as an answer, Draco almost couldn't let go of Harry anymore. He wished every Gryffindor would just disappear so he could spend the night in Harry's warm four-poster bed, wrapped up in sheets of red with his lover dreaming by his side.
Harry rose from his seat as well, Draco remaining where he sat while staring aimlessly in front of him.
to do it? Would Harry hate him for it? 'Yet you know, don't you?' Draco then asked, suddenly realizing that Dumbledore had been talking about something else than just being on the wrong side. Did the old headmaster perhaps already know what the Dark Lord was up to? What he had given Draco as his task?
Harry stayed behind with his lover in his arms and a little girl in front of him, still tied up and unsaved. Maybe he didn't have to save Hermione anymore; but he also just couldn't leave the girl behind. A feeling in his heart told him Fleur wasn't coming to get her; he just somehow knew. Declaring himself as a complete idiot, he looked around to see if the Merpeople that were guarding the square were paying attention or not. To his relief, he didn't see any of them anymore and saw it as his chance. He shot a spell at the girl's ropes and saw her slowly drift upwards to the beam of light. As soon as Harry started to move as well, he could feel the water shift around him more stronger than before. They were nearing. He had upset them.
Apparently he was only good enough to look after the girls and perhaps study a little at a different school.
? You aren't letting me return to school?' Taking a few steps closer, Draco balled his hands into fists but felt like it was a hopeless move at the same time. Never would his
Draco wondered. They looked like small black dots with hints of color. The horses came to a halt beside the man Draco saw earlier; he was quite tall and hairy, with a big fur coat covering most of his body. Next to him sat a large dog, dripping drool out of its mouth. Whoever this man was; Draco found him as interesting to look at as the castle beside him.
she asked in French. She, as well as all the other girls, referred to the Hogwarts students according to their House's animal.
'Can't you see I'm dying?' Draco throws his hands in the air, raising his voice just the tiniest bit. A few tears escape his eyes but he ignores them, keeps staring at Harry with great determination. But the arse doesn't even dare the look at him anymore. Doesn't even dare to look at the resemblance of near Death.
had given him a task; a task from a monster he had to obey in order to survive. His mother had been attached to him like a puppet attached to its owner by strings; only saying the things he wanted her to say. How could Draco have thought of her so wrong; how could he have thought she had been so alike to his father? He should've known there had been something wrong; his mother had always been against
'What are you so happy about?' He asks, eyeing Harry up and down as if he could find the answer somewhere between his Auror robes and his messy hair.
,' Harry said with still that cheeky smile upon his lips. It was the most cheesy thing the boy could've said, yet it was enough for Draco to turn a violent red and bury his face in Harry's neck to hide it.
Giving her son a rather confused look in return, she calls for Pibbly. The house-eld arrives within a few seconds, and Narcissa instructs her to bring Draco the newly purchased owl from the Manor’s owlery.
The boy shrugged and picked up his broom again. 'Want to try?' Harry swung his leg over the wood as if it was the most normal thing in the world and reached out his hand. Draco hesitantly took it and stood behind Harry. 'Hold on tight!' The boy said to him and before Draco could even react or tell him to wait, Harry took off with great speed.
Thinking fast, Harry’s only explanation is that Malfoy has cast a kind of concealment charm upon his arm before coming down, which would at least make some sense. But why is it that Harry can still see what lays underneath that charm and Ron can't?
It was the 2nd of September and early in the morning; before six and a deserted castle greeted Draco with rays of morning sunshine. But all Draco could see was darkness and misery; how much he hated the fact that he was there instead of at Beauxbatons, surrounded by his friends and writing letters to Harry. He would see Harry now daily — at least that was a good thing — but facing him and having to lie to him would be a greater pain than Draco had ever felt. Even the stab of that wooden stick many years ago wouldn't be able to compare to the pain of having to lie to his lover; lie about something that would hurt both himself as Harry greatly. Perhaps even the whole school.
Already walking away from the Gryffindor's table with the box of berets under his arm, Harry had to hurry himself to keep up with his lover's sudden vivacity while trying to swallow down that mouthful of food.
a little voice in Harry's head told him. Of course, but still. A department for the dead; it being located at St. Mungo's seemed as an obvious thing all of the sudden.
For the second time that night, Draco raised himself on his elbow again, looking down upon his boyfriend with shocked eyes. 'You must report this to Headmaster Dumbledore!
After an elaborate explanation about the festivity, including a show-off of photographs taken at the wedding day — Hermione fortunately changed the subject to the locket again. 'How did you become in its possession in the first place, Draco? We knew Bellatrix had it, but that's where our trail died.'
to keep you from drowning to death!' Draco shouted back. Harry climbed out of the Lake, face still furious. It made Draco sigh. 'You know what? Forget about it! Find something yourself!'
and threw the boy off him with all the strength he had. Harry hit the ground next to his bed with a loud
‘You think so? But what about Krum? Hermione currently seems to like him way more than Ron.’ Harry teared his look away from Draco's grey eyes to glance over at Hermione and Krum once again.
Another silence followed as they both awkwardly sat across one another; Harry slowly taking sips from his pint and Draco tracing his fingers over the pages of his books. Hogwarts students kept entering and leaving the pub in quick paces; ordering hot and cold butterbeer and sitting down at tables as far away from Harry as they could. Draco noticed Harry looking over at them a few times; a certain sadness visible in his eyes. Even though he acted like he didn't care; Draco could see it
Harry reached out a hand towards Draco and Draco took it, getting pulled up to his feet again. Being so close to Harry all of the sudden, he noticed he was a bit taller than the boy himself. He took a step backwards to be a bit more away, the closeness too much for him to bear. 'I'm sorry about that,' Harry then mumbled.
And he certainly also wasn't feeling like telling Harry about it, as he knew the boy would probably melt away of shame.
Only a quarter before the start of the second task, Harry finally gave up his search and moved over to the pier. On his way there he ran into Ron who seemed to have been waiting for him. 'There you are!' he called out. Harry glanced over at a bundle of slimy, grey-green
'A signed copy,' Draco noted, raising his index finger and watching Molly Weasley slowly melt away as she opened the book to look at her idol's signature.
Harry then heard another pair of footsteps, further away but definitely getting closer. Nearly running down the stairs in order to hide from the second person, he still wasn't fast enough. Severus Snape met him halfway, his eyes set darker than ever. Harry parted his lips, maybe to shout or ask for help — maybe to just don't do anything at all — but Snape held a finger against his lips, told the boy to stay silent. He then passed Harry as if nothing was going on at all, went up the stairs with a flare of his black robes. 'Albus,' he said as he reached the top. It was a strange way, how he said it — and how he didn't seem to draw his wand to point it at the boy. Harry was hiding on his previous spot again as well, glancing up to try and catch the slightest glimpse of what the boy looked like — who he was. He then also noticed that Dumbledore had no wand at all to defend himself; it laid deserted on the floor.
Harry sighed. 'I know — but that doesn't mean he can't hear me out. He did ask, however, how I knew about this attack. I told him the truth about the nature of my nightmares — and before I knew it I was getting dragged down to the dungeons by professor Snape.'
uncomfortable. There weren't any pubs near Beauxbatons and even if there were, he would never go to one. If he wanted to drink something while out in a village, he stopped by a tea-room or just waited until he was home again. The tea-rooms he was used to were decorated in whites and marbles, details were lain in with gold — but
'Well, yes… But that's not exactly what I'm aiming at. With not many, I actually mean that there's only one Death-Eater left in the whole prison!'
‘Harry, please. You’re supposed to wear your House’s colors and the outfit was especially designed for you. You look totally fine,' Draco soothed him.
'Did Draco—‘ Harry guessed, confusion himself as he touched the tule fabric and lace details of the dress.
'Well, yes — and one of them has to do with you!' Not able to contain a bit of the anger in his chest any longer, Harry had to confront his lover with the facts.
Draco pushed him away and splashed water in Harry's face. 'I'm going to make you pay for this,' he said to him, still irritated but with a smile in his eyes. Harry grinned at his words and Draco couldn't hold in his smile any longer either. He then was the one to reach for Harry and kiss him; a decent kiss if to say the least.
Madame cupped his cheek like she had done before they had left weeks ago, staring into his grey eyes. 'I know it won't. You're not the one to repeat the same mistake twice,' she said. Her voice had turned serious; a tone she only used to make something
, I do bathe together with the girls. It’s really not as awkward as you may think, Harry. The girls are used to seeing me naked by now and I am totally fine with it.’
Draco frowned. How could it be that Hogwarts had two Champions? And maybe more importantly; how could it be an underaged Champion? He didn't feel mad about it, but wasn't glad about it either. If Harry Potter could get the opportunity to join the Tournament, why couldn't he?
Draco's figure moved itself atop of him, feeling more heavy than ever which was strange to Harry as he knew the boy to be as light as a feather. His eyes kept staring in his — a possessive kind of stare that suddenly scared Harry to the bone. He wanted to throw the boy off him, tell him to leave and go away — tell him to act normal again even though he knew that was impossible. Harry reached out his hands, took ahold of Draco's face and felt the soft skin that was still as cold as ice. 'I love you,' he said to Draco in a whisper. A wet drop then escaped his eye — a single tear which he hadn't planned on shedding at all.
Draco frowned as he sat down and placed the small blue bag he carried on the seat beside him. 'Talk to me? About what, exactly?'
'A vampire?' Harry's interest was triggered and the boy threw Draco a weird look with his eyes. 'Really?'
A nod from Draco's head and McGonagall left the classroom; leaving Draco in the center of a mixed crowd. Some were still glaring daggers at him and others seemed careless about his presence. 'Come,' Harry said, reaching out his hand for Draco to take. 'Let's get away from those idiots.'
like he liked it to the surrounding crowd, but the second time it tasted even worse and he was on the verge of following Harry in his spitting.
It ended up on Harry's plate and the boy threw another questioning look at Draco before unfolding the letter again and reading it in his head. Meanwhile Draco took a look at what was inside; three berets in the Gryffindor house colors — one black, one red and the other golden. How did his mother even know he had been sorted into Gryffindor? 'What does she say?' Draco asked her as he saw Harry read his mother's letter from the corner of his eye.
Malfoy is silent after those words; looking lost in his thoughts. Minutes pass by and just as Harry thinks he should just leave; the mans opens his mouth briefly.
Harry frowned but nodded as Draco pointed at the cloak in his hands. 'It was my father's,' the boy replied.
Draco shook his head again. He didn't want to go through the embarrassment once more. What if he would fall again? Maybe he would truly die this time. '
,' the blond mutters to him, and immediately it becomes clear to Harry that Malfoy is surprised to see them, even though he hides it well. Pibbly probably didn't tell him that it were Potter and Weasley that were his unexpected Auror guests.
Stopping in his pace, right on one of the moving staircases, Harry made Draco slowly come to a halt as well. 'Why do you sound so serious?' was his reply.
Curious about what it could be, he unwraps the package as fast as he can. A downsized book appears within, staring at Draco and eagerly waiting for him to enlarge it again. A quick run to his nightstand and back for his wand, followed by a whispered '
? He basically towered above Fleur's presence right there and then; staring down at her tiny figure in confusion.
Descending the stairs with his eyes wandering off to the display of beheaded House-Elves, Harry could hear Hermione and Ron exchange words in a whispering tone in the living room. He waited in the hallway for a few seconds, held his ear by the door as he listened to the worry in their voices as they once again discussed the whereabouts of other horcruxes — and how disappointed they were for nothing having found any yet. His friends grew quiet as he entered the room, their eyes looking up and quickly down again. 'Did you sleep well?' Hermione asked, the same question she repeated every morning since their arrival at the place.
'Stop calling me that way,' Harry muttered with a grin but Draco already pushed him through the wall, the brightest of smiles on his lips before he disappeared out of Harry's sight.
he breathed out. 'But how?' Turning himself to the door again, he retrieved his wand from his sleeve to start tapping against the iron. Nothing happened, obviously. With a shrug, he glanced at the others whom shrugged their shoulders in return — not much of help either.
'Something wrong?' Draco asks him. He's not entirely sure why he asks Potter just that; the look could mean anything. A gut feeling, that's what it is.
His final night at the Dursley's had arrived — their safety no longer guaranteed. It was dark in his room as there was no moon in the sky. Or at least, not that Harry noticed. Grey clouds were everywhere like thick smoke, no star coming through to shine its light. With the lamp on his nightstand turned on, Harry was looking at Draco's golden timepiece again. Time ticked away like a timepiece was supposed to do, but Harry wished dearly it would stop for just a few seconds and point in a complete absurd direction, like it had done so many times before. Noon,
, you did. You reacted just the way I thought you would. I wasn't able to protect you from seeing my family's
A flash of light followed and the tall grasses of the Weasley property moved violently as Ron and Tonks came stumbling out of them. More flashes of light cleared up the sky; made it appear as if lightning was striking down upon the Burrow. Harry ran outside with Lupin behind him and together they watched how everyone arrived one by one — except for Alastor Moody and Mundungus Fletcher.
she had said, but Draco knew that it was a spell that verged a lot of power and wisdom that only a seventh year had learnt about.
As she strode away again, Potter seemed to have frozen on the spot; probably mesmerized by Fleur's beauty and their enchanted words in French. 'I must go now, but I am sure we will have more time to talk soon,
A week later, late in the afternoon, Harry finds himself sprawled across the sofa; book in one hand and a mug of homemade chocolate milk in the other. If there's one thing Harry thought he could do best, it was probably making homemade hot chocolate. Something about melting the chocolate, adding milk at the right time and then pouring it into a mug to let it set for a few minutes was enchanting to the man. It made his mind at peace and reminded him of Christmas days at Hogwarts.
their Guardian appear — they will be able to see the Immortal that has been by their side for days, months,
, wait,' Draco interrupted him. 'Let me guess first…' He closed his eyes and acted as if he was thinking very hard. It made him look ridiculous and Harry was on the verge of pushing the blond into the cold lake when he opened his eyes again. 'Perhaps an animal that lives in the forest?'
Harry felt his head fill with heat. How did he mean, there isn't anyone that needed a cure? What about Draco Malfoy? Had they just simply forgotten his entire existence?
The tunnel seemed to go on for at least a mile, and Draco's back started to hurt as he was too tall to walk through the darkness comfortably. It was uncomfortable for anyone, he then realized, looking at the others in front of them and hearing their sighing. An angel sang in his ears as a light appeared in front of his eyes; another portrait got swung aside. A buzz of voices followed, caught his ears and drew his attention.
He knew about many different ways one could breathe underwater but non of them would last for an hour; he had a lot of research to do starting tomorrow. But that was fine; helping Harry was something he loved to do and with the boy's best friends supporting him again, Draco was sure they would help search for something as well.
Not really being able to deny that fact, Harry sighed. 'Alright then — we'll go tomorrow. You have the location of a forest nearby, right?'
A grin appeared on the boy’s face. ‘Let me guess; you also chose to use the magical butterflies for Beauxbatons’ entrance in September then?’
. Draco's heart stopped as he first glanced at the twins, noticed they were thinking the same as their smiles faded from their handsome faces. 'She does indeed look like a toad,' André then said and Draco followed his eyes; only to see Umbridge sit next to his beloved Headmistress Madame Maxime.
Draco swore his cheeks turned a blush pink at those words, so he focused his eyes on Harry's hand, still placed upon his shoulder. How dearly he wished he didn’t turn red so quick. ‘But— don’t you want your friends their help instead?’
There was also one time that Draco had been talking to a few girls outside in the Clocktower Courtyard when a hint of red had entered his eye's view. He hadn't dared to look up but as the girls fell silent in their conversation, he couldn't ignore the boy any longer. Still, he had kept his eyes staring in the distance; not looking at anything at all.
'Actually, I-I think I've always been more jealous of you than that I felt hate towards you. I hated you because I wanted to be you, or at least, be your friend.'
"Where else would I be?" Draco answered, his tone still so incredibly calm. Harry wondered what went on in Draco's head — in the head of an angel. Would he think the same way as he did? Or would his thoughts be blank, or only related to angel-things? A question Harry was definitely planning on asking — but perhaps not now.
'Parseltongue,' was the first thing the boy said after a moment of silence. 'I can hear the whispering of a snake. What if— what if there's a horcrux in here?' His eyes met Draco's, and Draco immediately knew what to do without having Harry suggest it. He passed Ron and Hermione, made his way back to Harry and asked where exactly he could hear the whispering come from. 'Somewhere over there,' he said, pointing at a pile to his right. A few steps in that direction and Draco started to pick up every item he could see, held it close to Harry and got a shake of his head each time in return.
Harry shook his head, then placed his old copy of his Potions book next to Draco's. 'I'm here for this,' he admitted.
to do. In Draco's eyes it was simply unfair, and therefore he found it his duty to tell him about the dragons as well.
The Healer let out another sigh, his eyes focused on Dolohov's body. It took the man a few seconds to find his voice again now that the initial shock was over. 'As you probably overheard, I haven't found any clue to what this curse is yet. There is nothing to be found on this… men's body,' he said. He seemed to struggle with calling the death body of Dolohov that of a man.
His mother doesn't seem very convinced but relaxes her shoulders a little, as to say that she at least
After about an hour of doing household chores, Harry hesitantly pulled the ladder to the attic down once more and went up its rungs with his heart beating in his throat.
but all the rooms look the same. At least we have a separate room like at Beauxbatons. You share rooms,
His best friends then gave each other a questioning look. 'At the Ministry? Why would you think that?' Hermione asked. 'And isn't Draco at Beauxbatons?'
Holding on to his hat with both hands, Draco ran as fast as he could. He had never felt rain hit his precious skin that hard before — it felt like he was getting hit by several hexes at the same time. He looked over his shoulder and saw that some girls had pulled irritated faces, but others wore bright smiles. They rather seemed to enjoy running through the rain on a Monday morning — perhaps it gave them a feeling of freedom. Draco himself didn't like it at all and was happy when he was inside the castle, exhausted from the small sprint and soaked because of the rain. He waited by the door, touching each girl's shoulder and counting them in his head. As the last girl, Ella, made her way inside, he let out a breath he didn't knew he had been holding.
Tea cup? Draco didn't see a tea cup in the package, did he? Looking at the small box again, he then notices a tiny little item the size of a pearl. Actually, it seems to be a pearl. A '
What they did know, however, was that they had to get out of Malfoy Manor's cellar as fast as they could. Luna apparated away first with Dobby — and within five minutes the elf returned with a satisfied smile upon his face. It was now there turn, and Hermione and Ron already took Dobby's hands. Harry couldn't. He froze. 'Wait,' he said. 'We can't just leave Draco behind.'
Harry could feel his face heat up and his cheeks flush as he glanced at Draco's equally red face. He climbed up onto the pier and reached out his hand to help Draco get on it as well; the gesture made the blond's face even redder. As they shook off some of the water from their clothes, Harry basically got
As Draco made his way towards the bathroom the next morning, the girls trailing behind him, rain once again poured down upon their heads. Fortunately it was only a slight drizzle. Still, Draco had pulled his water-repellent hat over his ears again and clutched his dressing gown tightly around his body. Drip drop, getting wet was yet another thing he detested. He awaited the girls by the door like he did every day, touching each shoulder as they passed by. Fleur seemed to be lost in thought already since she had awoken; staring into nothingness. Her wide blue eyes didn't give any of her secrets away. When Draco touched her shoulder she even jumped a little; it had scared her.
With the violin back on the wall, Draco wipes his tears away and stares out of the small window. The sun's shining an orange gleam over the Manor's gardens again. The roses all look up at the sun, absorbing the first rays of sunshine. His eyes then focus on his hand; black as ever.
It all didn't matter to Draco; he had a task and it was weighing down upon his shoulders like nothing else had ever done before. Every fight he ever had had with Harry or every argument with his father couldn't compare to what he was experiencing now. He had been trying so hard for years and years to gain access to the good side; to switch sides and finally be away from the monster. But now he was caught in the monster's claws and unsure of how to escape.
As they had neared Courtroom Ten, Harry had spotted a familiar man already from afar; Lucius Malfoy, talking to a man in great suspicion. He had followed Harry with his eyes as if he had been a prey; ready to attack at any moment. Worried, the man had looked but extremely wary as well. And Harry hadn't been able to stop thinking that his son was hiding amongst his enemies without him knowing. The humor.
Hermione had always hated it when Harry or Ron didn't tell her the truth; it was as if she could hear every lie within a sentence and stare the truth out of their eyes. 'I was with Draco,' he repeated. 'But — we didn't go for a walk.'
a nickname Draco had earned himself through many different events. The twins both already had had detention and were currently being watched closely by replacing Headmistress
'I haven't heard from him ever since we parted in France.' The sun was setting outside and disappearing behind green hills; the views of beautiful Scottish landscapes passing by through the window of the Hogwarts Express. It was the first of September and a new year at Hogwarts was about to begin. Hermione sat beside Harry and Ron opposite of him; eating a chocolate frog and trying to keep a second one in his hand without having it jumping away.
‘Draco,’ a voice then said. His muscles relaxed. A vague feeling of composure overcame him. He lifted his head, lifted his eyes, but the calm feeling turned into fury as he saw whom it was that had called his name. His father stood on the other side of scene, behind Voldemort with his arms opened wide — ready to have his son returned to him and welcome back with a smile. 'Come, Draco.' A gesture, meant to be inviting and loving but turning into a triggering factor. His mother standing beside him, a look of worry on her face.
“Showing you more to pity,” follows the sneer reply. Malfoy’s hands move fast, and all the buttons easily slide through his fingers, unveiling another layer of clothing. It appears that Malfoy is rather fond of wearing a t-shirt, button-down and wizarding robe all at the same time. As he pulls the last bit of fabric off his head, exposing his pale, bare chest, Harry catches for breath. From his left shoulder down, Malfoy's pale skin has been replaced by pure
Chapter with a little bit of Christmas feelings, cuteness, hate towards the pink-dressed woman named Umbridge and a build-up to more important events coming up in the next chapter! I added the last part where they overhear Umbridge talk to the editor of the Daily Prophet as I find it a perfect example of her/the Ministry's plans to silence Voldemort's deeds and keep an eye on everyone who believes Albus Dumbledore's words. I hope it makes sense? Thank you for all the comments, you all seriously are too good for me!!
A sigh followed. 'Why make plans when we have no idea whom will be there, or what the Manor even looks like,' she explained. 'I've searched for information about the Manor in every book I could find, but it seems to be a very private property guarded by ancient spells I simply know nothing about.'
His nails scratch down his throat, trying to stop the invisible curse and praying that it won't spread further than what he can see. Fortunately Potter's voice is there quickly to reassure him.
Malfoy lets out a sneer. 'Something useful like that book that spread the curse even further?' His hand automatically reaches towards his collarbone, hidden away beneath the green fabric of his robes.
Draco had already told him everything he knew and had learnt about the Merpeople. A few simple defense spells would help Harry to keep them at bay. Once they would become aggressive though, it would be more difficult to fight them. 'So it's only a matter of not upsetting them?' Harry had asked and Draco had nodded in return. As long as Harry kept himself to the rules and do
'Alright, but I insist on guiding you there as the other students won't know what will overcome them. As I said before; we have never had a student from another school transfer to Hogwarts in his sixth year. The first a few times but
Soon enough they were greeted with the voice of Death Eaters, of whom Draco didn't even know their names, as they neared the drawing room; accepting the invitation of joining
Hearing the anger in Snape's voice, and seeing his hand slowly point itself at Harry again — the black wand clutched in it — Harry knew it was definitely time to leave. He didn't want to; but he had to, if he didn't want to be hit by a Jelly-Leg Jinx or something far worse as well. He left the dungeons feeling utterly exhausted yet wide awake by his new discoveries. Not only had he found out his father used to bully other students, he had also found out about Snape being friends with Draco's father.
Coming to a halt on a deserted square in Paris, Draco said his goodbyes to the twins and hurried himself to the Portkey Madame had arranged for him. A few other students followed him as well, their eyes searching for the old and scruffy object their Headmistress had informed them about. The row of objects looked as if stolen items from a poor man living on the streets, and Draco picked out his rotten apple almost immediately. Pulling a face of disgust he placed a finger on the soft flesh and felt his body getting pulled away into a swirl of time and space as he traveled over the Channel to England again. With the smallest rustle of leafs he landed on the forest's muddy ground a little away from the Manor, the rotten apple rolling down the slight hill before popping away into nothingness. Draco could see the roof of the Manor he hated so much and turned his back towards it without a second guess, retrieved his shrunken broom from his pocket and blessed the night sky for turning dark at already an early hour during winter. Flying over the trees of the same forest he had landed in before, he made his way to London again with the cold wind blowing through his hair.
'A few chocolate frogs and other candy from friends; nothing special actually.' The boy shrugged and then gave Draco a cheeky smile as he seemed to remember something. 'Or maybe… there is this one present that I got that is my absolute favorite.'
' he said after the man, but Dumbledore ignored his words. Leaving the classroom as well a few seconds behind him, Draco noticed the man was already gone.
arrived a few minutes earlier than the time Draco told him to come. It was a good surprise though, he had an utter dislike for late-runners.
because of idiotic professors and that idiotic Tournament. The goblin Draco had Imperio'd suddenly came back around, shouted a few seconds before getting the same curse blasted at him again. Irritated, Draco bit his teeth, clenched his jaw and lifted his chin. 'Bring us to Bellatrix Lestrange's vault!
?' A vague memory of a small, blond child holding hands with a tall, blond man. A woman with black curls next to him, opening the door to showcase a collection of potential toys — at least, that was what Draco had thought at the time.
'I can see them as well,' Neville admitted. 'I witnessed my grandfather's death.' He placed a hand on one of the Thestrals' heads and smiled.
Later in the evening, he sat on a chair with his face towards a window, taking in the night sky. Fleur stood behind him, ready to cut hair that hadn't been touched in months. It had grown to his shoulders, the silver locks longing for their former glory. 'Are you sure you want to cut it short again?' she asked. In Fleur's eyes, Draco's hair would forever be the long locks he had had before — the beautiful Veela-like hair every girl had been jealous of.
'Let's get him back to the tent,' Ron suggested, lifting Harry from the ground by his arms. 'He has to rest.' Draco was confused as he saw Harry's best friends carry his lover back to the tent as if it was the most normal thing in the world. Had it happened that many times before? Was Harry going to be alright? He hadn't been enough by his side the past few months to know wether visions like that happened frequently; he only knew they had occurred once or twice in the past. And never this severe. They had always appeared like nightmares; like terrible dreams, Draco knew. But this seemed to be different. This seemed to be as if Voldemort's soul had crawled into the poor boy's body — had started to eat him from the inside.
Harry just sighed and glanced at Hermione, who had been against the idea from the start. 'What if something goes wrong?' she had said, not believing that it would help Harry any further with obtaining the memory. Ron on the other hand had been all in for it; wanted to see Harry when influenced by the potion and was cheering for him to take it.
?' he told them. They all nodded their heads and Draco jumped out of the carriage, the girls following in his steps.
. He immediately missed not having a cup of tea to wash away the foul taste. 'You don't like it, do you?' Harry asked him with a grin and Draco nodded in all honesty.
Interest triggered, Draco crawled up from the ground — his limbs aching and bones cracking by the sudden movement. 'Want me to help translate a few things?' he proposed, and Hermione put on a bright smile.
beautiful. Perhaps Draco could always send a letter to Father if he didn't get selected; he was sure he would turn things around easily.
'I must leave tomorrow to somewhere of high importance; a dangerous place to which I will bring Harry along.' Draco wanted to interrupt him, ask him why he had to bring Harry, but the man hushed him by holding up a hand. 'Before you ask; Harry knows the danger of it and is the only one that can help me with it. You'll soon be informed what it's all about. Have patience, my boy.' Draco nodded his head, even though his patience was terribly lacking at that moment. 'As I believe, mister Idel somehow knows of my traveling and will take advantage of it by completing his task — which means yours will have to be completed as well.'
‘And so we did; we fled away to France. It was only natural for my parents to choose France over another country; they both are fluent in the language and
Draco gave Harry another nod and a weak smile as he swung his leg over the broom, just as Harry had done. The boy then explained to him how he should hold his hands, place his feet and bend his body according to the direction of the wind. But even though Harry was trying so hard, Draco's courage was slowly fading away with every word the boy said. His hands were sweating even more, the wood sliding underneath his palms. He remembered the first and last time he had been standing in that position; listening to the words his flying instructor had to say. It was as if Draco's magic had exploded from his hands, making the broom go up against his will. Reliving that memory and suddenly afraid it would happen again, Draco dropped the broom and shook his head as he took a few steps away from it. '
'The fear, Harry. The fear for the Tournament. The fear when your name suddenly got called. I remember when you told me about having had enough awful adventures in the past; I figured you were telling the truth,
. A hint of jealousy washed through him, but only lasted a second. It quickly got exchanged for compassion and pity — both for the many Mortals that had gotten ill and had died, as well as for Draco whom had had to deal with who knew how many of those cases… Harry at that moment was extremely glad he'd been healthy for already his entire life, besides from the few bruises and blue eyes.
Dark robes he once had worn to a funeral were hung to his wardrobe; his mother had probably placed them there for him to wear. Exchanging his pajamas of silk for the darkness of the robes, Draco felt even more like just giving up all together. Knowing that his hair was probably the most chaotic mess it had ever been, he still didn't even glance into the mirror to fix it; he was simple too tired and couldn't care any less. His mother was waiting just outside his door, dressed in black robes herself and her hair partly tied to keep the strands out of her face. Draco could hear his father saunter through the hallway as well, further down and looking like a complete mess himself. His once
'But why?' Harry didn't really understand what Hermione was trying to say. Why would a locket want to be alone with him? So he could change its owner from Draco to Harry?
Draco gave the painted boy, Raphael, a firm nod. At the gesture, the wings of the key he was holding fluttered a bit and left his hand. Not even a second later the portrait swung aside, revealing the compartment he had slept in the night before. But, to Draco's relief, everything was a bit expanded as well. The bed was wider, the desk as well and he now even had a wardrobe accompanied by a standing mirror. Everything was decorated in shades of pale blue, gold and white; the colors of Beauxbatons.
It's already late in the afternoon when Draco finally sends off his letter. It took him way longer than expected to invite someone as the annoying arse over to his house.
Was he surprised it had been reality and not a dream? Perhaps a little. But secretly Harry'd wished it had
December didn't only mark the start of winter to most students, it also marked the twenty-five days there were left until the Yule Ball. There was not one student from any of the three school that hadn't mentioned it before. Rumors had been spread of a Yule Ball ever since the Triwizard Tournament had been announced, but nobody had known there actually would be one until Headmaster Dumbledore made his announcement.
Those words seemed to light a fire in Harry as the raven-haired boy came into action and made his way to the boy -- Hermione just quickly enough to grab Harry by his robes and keep him from strangling the boy to near-death.
Lowering himself onto his desk's chair, he stared outside the window and looked upon red roses and white lilies his mother had planted in the Manor's gardens. Draco's hands were tingling with the desire to wither them; to make them turn as rotten as his parents their soul. But weren't they just trying to give their son the best life? To keep him safe? Draco didn't know anymore and therefore contained himself, picked up a new stroll of parchment instead and started writing to Harry — letters of which he didn't even know he would be able to sent.
Harry reached the cottage first. A squeaking door, a chandelier of seashells slowly swinging in the wind. The smell of lavender. Fleur stormed in their direction, and Harry knew she wanted to wrap her arms around Draco — hold the friend she had missed so greatly in her arms. But Harry stopped her, placed a hand upon her shoulder and brought his head close to her ear. 'he's not himself,' he whispered to her, hoping she would understand.
Draco swallowed at the thought, but knew Madame would never approve of such vile techniques. Besides, her girls' hands were too precious to mutilate just like that. '
Their conversation then got interrupted by a loud voice, loud shouts coming from downstairs — followed by footsteps bonking their way up the stairs with no shame nor hesitation. “Potter!” It came a few moment later from right underneath the closed hatch. “Open,
Malfoy now looks away from him, eyes staring at his mahogany floor and hands behind his back. 'I guess I did.'
'There's no need to defend yourself,' Harry said as he turned himself towards his friends. 'You both know that he's on our side, right?' He tried to read their eyes but they both looked away as if afraid to let him see that they weren't so sure of which side Draco was on; as if they still believed he was as mad as his father. It made him angry again, but he suppressed the feeling. 'At least Draco sent me letters,' he concluded before leaving the room, pulling Draco by his sleeve with him.
Potter's response arrives within the following hour, brought in by a satisfied looking Noir. Draco takes the letter from the owl and watches it with a side glance. Potter probably gave the damn thing a few treats, and was probably over the moon to see such a beautiful resemblance of his own Snow owl.
The snake-like Wizard had doomed up in front of his eyes, pale as the moonlight and as monstrous as Harry had imagined him to be. Harry hadn't been able to do anything but try to remain calm; something he had never been very good at. He tried to figure out a plan, tried to figure out a way to escape from Voldemort and the graveyard all together; but fear and panic were taking over his brain and made him unable to think.
Draco's cheeks blushed at the thought of a professor seeing every little thing, every little moment they had shared together. An awkward feeling boiled up in his stomach as he looked away from Harry's green eyes. 'That's rather — personal,' he commented. 'But it's good for you to learn it; especially if
Of course Draco hadn't been able to tell them he had gone to Hogsmeade with Harry but he told them he had been too curious and gone off to explore the little village on his own. Upon entering a bookstore, he had gotten lost of all sense of time and returned at an hour way later than he had wanted to. The girls hadn't questioned his story; they took it as the truth without a second thought. Not even one of them asked what books Draco ended up buying nor did they ask to see them; they just believed him.
Ron could easily step over large obstacles, his long legs no problem to the whims of nature. Long legs were gifted to Draco as well, but he seemed to struggle as much as Harry nonetheless. There simply was no elegant way to get through a forest, and his Beauxbatons self nearly fainted at the sight of his ripped trousers.
'I-I'm not sure either if I would be an ideal father. I never really had a father myself and sometimes when I babysit Teddy I feel like I say '
‘Higher!’ A man dressed in blue from head to toe, marching from one way of a field to the other with his hands in his sides. A golden wand with a bright green emerald at its end sticking out of his trousers’ pocket. A beret on his head. Silver locks peeking from underneath the wool. ‘Higher, Louis! Four meters above the ground it not nearly enough to achieve those Quiddich dreams of yours!’ His voice was strict yet righteous — scary to a few yet a trust radiating from it as well.
After a nod, he saw Harry glance over his shoulder, at his friends who were looking around in wonder. Luna and Ginny pointed at every little detail of the architecture and Hermione seemed fascinated by the many talking statues that were positioned throughout the hallways. Students dressed in blue passed them, all nodding their heads to Draco and throwing weird looks at Harry and his friends; as if someone had disposed trash on their school's precious marble floors. Footsteps of gold were appearing in front of everyone's feet except those of Draco; leading them in a direction unknown to them — but clear to the only local of the group.
Draco's attention got pulled away from Harry's godfather by Molly whom excitedly left the room to return seconds later with a pile of gifts. Draco saw it as his cue and opened his little suitcase as well, started retrieving a few small gifts he had prepared for the ones he hoped to see again. Harry now was the one to throw him a questioning glance, but Draco waved his look away. If he wanted to gift things, then that was his decision. Molly seemed to agree with Harry's questioning eyes as she pulled an eyebrow at the pile of gifts wrapped in gold. 'Dear boy, you didn't have to buy us anything', she said to him, eyes wide but with a warm look.
‘Please tell me this all isn’t still a dream?’ They had retreated to their little space; Draco sprawled on top of their four-poster bed wrapped in what seemed six blankets and Harry standing beside it, buttoning his robes again.
Walking to the door, hand in hand, Draco threw one last look over his shoulder. Time had resumed itself, and everyone had bursted into tears — sobs for a wonderful little girl that would most definitely be missed.
“It’s weird though —,' Harry thinks out loud as they walk away from the entrance, heading towards the small apparition point at the end of a long, stone bridge, ‘— why would Davis be scared of Dolohov's body? Was he afraid that he would get infected by the curse himself?”
Draco had sneaked Harry back into his room so they could spend their last nights together, just sleeping side by side and feeling each other's warmth and comfort. They talked about the future, about what it would be like now that Voldemort had returned. Now that Harry couldn't come to France anymore during the summer. Draco's father was too much of a risk; if Draco would bring home Harry Potter, archenemy of the Dark Lord himself, he wouldn't even think twice before handing him over to the monster himself.
The boy whirled around immediately, his wings moving with him. He'd taken off his shirt, which exposed his chest completely; just as perfect as his face aside from the strange white scars that ran zigzag over his torso in elegant lines — like some kind of secret script. But Harry didn't get much time to take them in, as his green gaze got drawn to the boy's pale eyes once more. Wide eyes, their pupils blown. "I told you not to look," the boy, the
'Sorry, I just needed a way to start the story… But, did you know that there are not many Death Eaters left in Azkaban right now, as most of them died only a few weeks or months after their capture?'
They sauntered over the sand, their hands locked. It was a lovely afternoon with a bright sun, a cold wind but a calm sea. They had done nothing more but be close together, enjoy each other's presence they had missed so much. Stories, memories of the last few months seemed unimportant — only
Leave me alone!' he shouted in Harry's face. A moment of silence followed, a moment of rest. A kind of pause. They looked at each other; Harry’s face calm and confused — Draco’s furious, hot and red. Draco caught the worry in the boy's green eyes as Harry noticed his tears, and it tore their silence apart. 'You don't understand anything,’ Draco continued, his voice finding its anger again.
The strangest images of pure white things flashed in front of his eyes, as if a movie was playing in his head, especially and only for him, created by this mysterious person.
Madame Maxime hurried herself around the corridor, long legs chasing the boys away from the girls. ‘
Draco stopped in his pace and took ahold of Harry's hand. A warm breeze declaring summer passed by as he faced the boy again. 'I-I wish I could protect you from them,' Draco stammered. 'It must be horrible how they treat you.'
'Why? Is he annoying you? Should I got talk to him?' Already looking for the boy himself from behind the draping, Draco felt Hermione pull him back by his sleeve.
Two months had passed since they had arrived at Grimmauld Place, a poster now on every wall in the magical world declaring Harry James Potter as
The corner of the boy's mouth quivered slightly, as if a tiny smile wanted to jump out — yet the boy oppressed it, and asked another question instead. "Do you know what happens when a mortal lays eyes upon an angel?" Harry shook his head, once again clueless. "They become overwhelmed; their minds not able to take in something from another world. They either faint, go blind, get stuck in some kind of trance for life or…" The boy fell silent, seemingly unwilling to go on.
Draco could see Harry swallow from the corner of his eyes, bend his head in an awkward way. 'Nice to see you again as well, Madame Maxime,' was his clumsy reply.
rich?' He reached out to touch something that appeared to be a large snake, completely made out of silver, with emeralds for eyes, but Draco slapped his hand away.
time since he'd heard his aunt's name. Mother didn't like to talk about her sister; she was supposed to be forgotten. Draco had always been rather curious to know why a Pureblood woman had given up her life of wealth and prestige for the life with a Muggle. Of course now he could understand her actions; love is stronger than any other emotion.
Draco's eyes took in his fellow students once more; a thing he liked to do whenever he felt bored. His friends were sitting around him, dressed in shades of pastel blue. Their hair always so flawless, eyes bright and shiny. But they could try as much as they wanted; Draco always thought
Thank you so much for all the kudos! I hope to upload at least once a week so make sure to check for updates regularly!
,' she answered. And it was right; maybe Draco secretly knew why he had been chosen. He had always been ahead of his year and had never shown interest in girls the way most boys did. It wasn't because he didn't like the girls; it was because he didn't particularly like them
"Let me help," a voice to his left then proposed — a voice so soft and delicate that Harry almost didn't catch it. Realizing it couldn't come from any other than the boy, Harry turned his head towards him again — but found him no longer there. Instead, the boy stood on his other side — so suddenly, as if he'd teleported himself there. His pale gaze grazed past Harry's before his irises turned white again, pointing themselves at the woman. Her blue eyes got instantly drawn to them like magnets, and Harry had no clue of what happened next. Their gaze only lasted a few seconds, but during those seconds it had felt as if the world around him had stopped. There hadn't been any noise, there hadn't been any movement.
Every second of their last two days together they had spent in each other's company. They had left Dumbledore's office smiling, fingers tangled in each other as they had walked back to the Great Hall to face all of their friends who had fought a battle for them they couldn't fight themselves. It had been funny to see their faces as they had entered the Hall again, acting as if nothing had happened in the first place. Professor McGonagall had demanded everyone to sit down again and eat; something non of them had done before or after their yelling battle. Draco and Harry had taken a seat by the girls, who had still given Harry vile glares at first but resolved everything after Draco's explanation to them in French. Harry's friends seemed to take longer to be convinced that everything was fine again, that it was a good idea for Harry to date the son of a Death Eater. Especially Ron, who already held many grudges against Draco, had been hard to convince but had stopped sulking in the end anyway.
The portrait just gave him a blank look and Raphael seemed to beam from across the room, ready for Draco to return back to the room. But as Draco stood in front of the boy's portrait, he suddenly seemed frozen for a second time that night.
At the end of Draco's first week at Hogwarts, he was walking towards the Quidditch pitch with Harry by his side. It was Harry's first day as the captain of Gryffindor and he had asked Draco to come and watch him try to manage a team — something the boy had never done before and found all too exciting. Of course Draco had accepted the invitation; still feeling a bit down but also trying to make the best of it, he didn't have the nerve to refuse. But as they were about to leave the castle and exchange the tiled floors for grass, headmaster Dumbledore appeared out of nowhere to tap Draco on the shoulder. Raven and silver turned their heads at their headmaster; smiling in a strange way and dressed in pale blue from head to toe. Perhaps he was channeling his inner Beauxbatons. 'Draco, may I speak with you for a minute?' he asked.
never expected that Riddle would return. He always told me not to fear the man; that he wouldn’t come back and if he would, and there was always a big emphasis on the
"You can see me?" the boy then asked, but it took a moment for Harry to let those words come through — to realize words had been spoken at all. It was as if the words had to travel through a forest of fog to reach his ears — but when they did, Harry blinked and got pushed back into reality.
He moved his feet and was launched faster through the water than ever before. It made him want to smile but knowing that he only had an hour for the task, he put his happy feelings away for later and moved his feet as fast as he could, further into the darkness of the lake.
'It does, Draco,' Harry declared as he rose from his seat only to fall down to his knees again in front of Draco. 'Because I still love you.' His eyes were filled with tears as he cleared the pockets of his robes, took out locks of silver hair and held them in his trembling hands for Draco to retrieve.
A mermaid's song in the Merpeople's language. Draco had been lucky that he had heard it; it had given him all the information that he needed. When Fleur had opened her Golden Egg proudly in the carriage's common room, the same screeching sounds the mermaid had made erupted from inside. As all girls had held their hands to their ears, Draco had remained calm and had made the connection; it had to be a message in Mermish.
That's all it says. Did Potter really have to use such a large sheet of parchment for those few words? Not to mention the fact that the

. Glaring at Draco as if he just ate something terrible and is dying to spit it out, right in Draco’s face. The Weasel himself looks still the same as during his Hogwarts days; too tall, red hair too bright, too many freckles and probably hand-me-down Auror robes.
Putting on his shoes in the entryway and grabbing his bag from the closet under the stairs, Harry decided it was best to just walk to school a little earlier than to linger around. He wasn't going to be able to get anything edible from the kitchen anyway, and the longer he stayed, the more chance he had that Vernon or Dudley would annoy him once more. As the conversation from the kitchen slowly drifted into Harry's ears — once again about Dudley's outstanding school grades — he put on his coat.
Before Draco could protest, the boy had already disappeared into the crowd. Draco remained standing by the door, observing everyone in front of him. They all looked at Draco as if he was part of the furniture;
'We can always throw in a window,' Draco suggested to that, getting a few weird looks in return. Whenever he said something like that — so
A sigh almost escaped Draco's lips, but he contained himself. 'If I had been in your place, I probably would've casted a spell as well.'
. She picks up the Prophet again and Draco peers at the front page, looking at the face of Potter holding up a new addition to the Nimbus brooms family.
now the locket had found a host that was incredibly close with its target. 'It's trying to kill me,' Harry repeated out loud, getting a nod of Hermione's head in return. 'And you think if I get intimate with Draco, he will take the bite to be alone with me and try?'
'Dumbledore has you under his control as well, I see,' Dolores then declared. She sniffed with her nose and crossed her short, chubby arms. So it was Dumbledore they were talking about — but why?
'So?' Harry raised an eyebrow and saw Ron do the same. 'Do you mean him warning me about the fact that something was going to happen? Because something already
Immediately Harry drew his head back, looked into Draco's eyes to confirm his words were true. 'He has a task of his own — one that might be equally as dangerous as mine. I'm warning you, Harry; keep an eye on him instead of trying to help me. The more you want to help me… the more chance I have of dying.'
'Of course I will. Even if she doesn't I'll inform you with whatever nonsense I've come up with in the meantime. I won't give up on you so easily, Draco,' he replies with a small smile.
He takes a deep breath, tries to focus himself on whoever he’ll find behind those doors today; Aurors only wanting to talk — or Aurors ready to give him an undeserved punishment for whatever reason. Perhaps they think he’s dead, Draco then thinks to himself, as he remembers he hasn’t shown his face in public for the past four years. Or think he’s lonely, decaying away in the presence of his equally weak mother.
Draco fidgeted on his chair a little as he awaited her words. Why would she want to talk to him about Harry? Had the boy told her everything he knew? About the Egg, the bathroom, all the help he had gotten with the dragons?
'Do I really have to sleep in a room of my own? Can't I just stay with you?' Harry asked. They were following the way Harry's golden footsteps were taking him; obviously to the dormitories but it was only a question to which one and what exact room.
Another tear escaped Harry's eye as he nodded short, let his hands find themselves a way around Draco's waist — now even smaller than before. 'I will do everything to keep you safe from now on. My promise to you is that I won't let anyone come close to you or take you away from me again.'
fault, it's something not even God has control over. Mortals get sick because of other Mortals their faults, not ours. Anyhow… when a Mortal of a Guardian passes, in their last few seconds of Mortal life, they will
'While we were at Hogwarts for the Triwizard Tournament,' she explained. 'It was maybe a few weeks after we arrived. I had taken my camera with me to show the other students back at Beauxbatons what Hogwarts was like — and one day I spotted Draco in his little outfit and thought he looked really
Dudley glanced at his friends over his shoulder, whom were still laughing. 'No, I think I'll keep it. Let me see —
Red, green, blue and even yellow passed by their table to wish Fleur good luck, neither of them daring to pat Fleur's shoulder like they did with Krum or Diggory. It probably was Fleur's Veela inheritance that kept them at bay, hands tucked away neatly in their robes' pockets. Fleur returned all of their words with little smiles and nods. It worried Draco that she was so silent, but perhaps she was just lost in thought.
The twins glanced at each other and then back at Draco with confused eyes. 'How do you mean, hurry up?' André asked, clearly not seeing what Draco saw.
'Are you sure about this?' Hermione asked for the hundredth time. It seemed as if Harry and Ron were experiencing deja vu's, as they rolled their eyes several times.
And now he was doing to same, only for himself. He was surrendering himself so others didn't have to do it, and Draco couldn't help but feel a warm glow inside his chest at the thought. Pride. Between the feelings of worry, anger, sadness he felt proud of Harry for wanting to safe so many lives.
'And you should've seen her face; such a resemblance to a toad I had never seen before. I'm still amazed by how
sparked a few memories of something he'd read about before. Wasn't the name Lucifer more common amongst humans? "It isn't true what the mortals say; about him having lost his wings. He
On Sunday morning, a bit before the break of dawn, Draco decides to leave his room for a walk in the gardens. He needs the fresh air. He needs to leave his heavy robes in the room and his glove, at least for one more time. Those robes, that glove... they have grown to be a part of him since a while now, and the feeling of leaving them behind in his room is freeing. As if everything is alright once more.
His name seemed to draw a reaction from the ginger haired boy; a simple chuckle and a smirk on his freckled face. At least the pout Draco had seen earlier had disappeared like snow. 'You're called '
Draco covered his upper body with foam in seconds and looked away from the boy. If there was one thing he hated about himself; it was the ugly scar the size of a large button on his heart. It was a disgrace to his elegant and sublime self, he found. He had always seen himself as near-perfect,
With Ron now bolting up from his chair, ready to kick the elf in the gut — for calling Hermione such a terrible word — Kreacher already took a few steps backwards while protecting his tiny body with his thin arms. 'Don't call her that,' Harry added to it in a strict way. He knew Sirius had given Grimmauld Place to him, which meant he was Kreacher's master now and therefore the house-elf had to obey his words. Kreacher seemed to understand that fact as well, as he bowed his head slightly. 'Do you know where the real locket is? This one is a fake,' Hrry explained to him, and Kreacher looked up again.
He had felt Arthur's eyes immediately pointed on him, though, as he had stepped inside and observed the Weasley's their home. He still couldn't blame them; especially not now that he got a task from the Dark Lord. Many ticking sounds and house-hold magic soon drew away both Draco's as Arthur's attention, and as Draco observed the interesting clock in the kitchen; he was reminded of his old timepiece he had given to Harry. 'You still have it?' he asked the boy, whom was standing behind him and observing the clock as well — even though Draco knew the boy had probably seen it many times before.
Christmas trees from floor to ceiling decorated in white. Sparkling floating candles, red ribbons and enchanted snow everywhere. The decorations for the Yule Ball were the most delightful thing Draco had
"Oh—" Harry was halfway down the ladder when he stopped, popped his head up the attic again. "Feel free to take a new shirt from my closet, before you catch a cold or something."
'I-I don't mean I don't want you by my side, though. It's just… weird, I guess,' he heard the boy say.
And it worked; it made Harry run after her — through the circle of that yellow fire and through the tall grasses of the Weasley premises. 'Harry!' Arthur called out after him, already hurrying himself behind the boy. A large flame rose up in front of him; denying him his passage. Draco ran over to the man, rose his own wand up to the night sky and started whispering spells together with Arthur. He caught the man glancing at him with eyes that seemed to radiate a trust he had never felt upon him before — at least, not from that same man.
‘It does?’ Draco asked as he moved closer to the boy in question, eyes locked in his. It made Harry move away a little as well, but hesitantly, as if he actually didn’t want to. ‘Her song’s words were sang in Mermish. I couldn’t understand
. A breath inhaled so silent, it's almost unnoticeable. It is still early in the morning, yet the warm light of an upcoming sun isn't there. Cool, grey light is filtering through the window instead, shining upon Draco's face and waking him. He slowly opens his eyes to replace the darkness of his dreams with the darkness of reality. A wish to make the sun come out, but the Malfoy Manor remains veiled underneath a dark, velvet blanket.
“What exactly did you do, if I may ask?” Harry turned himself to Draco, who had pulled up the ladder and closed the hatch as if he was the one who'd been living on this attic for years — well,
,’ one student began, followed by others whom pointed at the shining new piece of jewelry around Draco’s ring finger. They said it in an irritated, hysterical way in which only the French could try to clear something up. Their hands in the air, fingers pointing at Draco and looking at Harry as if he was the most stupid person they'd ever seen.
Draco took deep breaths as he let the information sink in, tried to calm himself for his shoulders kept shaking. Flashes of headmaster Dumbledore falling off the Astronomy Tower slowly slithered back into his mind. A sadness caused by grief overcame him, made his heart sink. 'You were there?' His voice was a mere whisper, but Harry had heard every word and nodded. 'Did I — did I really kill him?
The tears then finally ran down his cheeks as if a dam had burst. In his trembling hands he held the remainder of what he once used to love so much, now sacrificed to prove his love to a boy who didn't even love
'You can't what?' Green eyes tried to look in his but Draco just sighed and buried his face even deeper.
'It's… complicated,' he replied in the end with a weak smile that was more like a grimace. To cast away the heavy atmosphere that had suddenly fallen around them, Harry silently casted a patronus charm of his own and sent his stag over the lake. Draco lifted his head again to look at how the stag took place beside the swan and how they seemed to communicate without any words. It felt the same to Harry as Draco's hand intertwined with his again, no words needed to know the boy was thankful.
he was just kidding!" Biting his teeth, Draco let himself fall down upon one of the chairs, letting a hand go through his hair. The other angel, named Aaron, sat himself down on the chair opposite of him. "You got to understand where we're coming from as well, don't you? Imagine if one of us had gone through almost a
part. Once again, a faint smile followed. "That was a dumb question, wasn't it? I should know an angel can't be human like myself… Is your heart gone then?" Not exactly sure why he asked about the boy's heart, Harry suddenly felt guilty for doing so. Was it perhaps a rude question to ask?
'I've always thought you were amazing at Quidditch and Potions, if you wish to receive compliments on something,' Harry tells him. He shrugs and looks Malfoy's brooms, displayed on his dark bedroom wall.
The twins both shook their heads, all three of them smiling as they entered the Dining Chamber. Delicious smells filled their hearts with joy and the tables of marble and gold greeted them with big smiles the shape of croissants, but something was wrong —
“Don’t catch flies, Potter,” Malfoy mutters at him. Realizing that he'd been staring quite frankly with his mouth wide open, he closes it. A shiver runs over Malfoy’s figure then, and the blond takes a deep breath.
