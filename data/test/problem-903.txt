Periander ended up with them, or there's something more- why Dorian and Lamia were just cut from the Malfoy family tree as if they never existed, but not the Periander-"
Even after she became suspicious of herself. Maybe she would have gone to someone for help if she had a friend in the world. Anyone she could trust but me. But it was me who she wrote to, up to this very morning, pouring out her heart. 'Tom, Tom, my love, what should I
me?" he echoed, a world of woundedness he had thought buried roaring back to life. What he would have
He told them all he was suffering from sickness after the magical overcharge he'd suffered at the Cup, which they believed readily enough. When he tried, though, to specify that his fight with the Ministry wizards had been unprovoked, and he hadn't summoned the Dark Mark, they didn't seem to put much stock in it. "So they all just attacked you for no reason?" Blaise asked skeptically.
When they made it into the entrance hall, the doors to the great hall had already been opened, and all the students seemed to have settled in, except for the champions, who were standing with McGonagall beside the doors. Krum looked very downcast, but he brightened when he looked up and saw Hermione run over towards him. "Oh, Viktor, I'm sorry I'm late!" she exclaimed. "Draco said we should be fashionably late, I forgot about the champions' procession- I'm sorry if I've held it up, oh, you look nice..." Smooth with the boys, Hermione Granger, that was her calling card. Maneater supreme.
"Just the man," Severus said. "The very man. A girl has been snatched by the monster, Lockhart. Taken into the Chamber of Secrets itself. Your moment has come at last."
Sirius did seem to soften, but only enough to lower his voice. "He shouldn't have to wait. I wish I could at least tell Harry I've wanted to adopt him, since the day I was freed- sooner-"
"I want to help," Draco said, hand stroking over his wand in his pocket, "But I don't know why none of you will listen to me about Professor Snape."
"I sat here yesterday," she said as if it was explanation enough, and unfurled a parchment which she pinned flat over her side of the table. When she caught his stare, she eagerly added, "I know the first Charms essay isn't due for weeks, but really, it's never too early to begin research, is it? There's so much
"No," Diggory said, shaking his head, and took a deep breath to steel himself, as if it took great courage for him to confront
But Draco didn't think Potter would get better at focusing on anything until the root cause could be addressed. Potter seemed ready to wait for Ron to calm down, as these Gryffindors were far more tempestuous towards each other than Draco could have imagined from the outside. He still remembered the fall-out last year between Hermione and the boys over the Firebolt and the Scabbers-Crookshanks situation, but reminding Ron of the foolishness of that just tended to make him angrier, Scabbers turning out to be a mass murderer notwithstanding.
?" Draco yelled, and followed Potter towards to Diggory, trying and failing to keep his voice down. "What are you thinking, Potter? Stop! You can't!"
"See me on the Marauder's Map?" Draco sighed, and eventually followed Potter up the steps to avoid being dragged. "Um, Potter, you know I'm banned from Gryffindor Tower, don't you?"
Maybe he'd already guessed by the near-cognate, but his face still went satisfyingly slack and open-mouthed, when Draco turned to call back, "Hell, obviously!" Then he ran after Gilderoy.
. "A Gryffindor," he finished lamely. Draco just turned back to Hermione as if his captain hadn't spoken, while thunder rumbled above them like some god had been angered by Hermione's presence.
Millie was first, presenting the cat case, and telling the story of finding Mr. Wilberforth chasing a rat in the Hogwarts grounds. Her narrative ended with Pansy stopping Mr. Wilberforth, calling it Weasley's rat, and carrying it off to give to Draco Malfoy in Mr. Wilberforth's case. Pansy echoed Millie's tale, with the additional step of giving it to Draco herself. And the prosecution didn't waste their time questioning these two put-together pureblood girls, with their details just setting the scene. The venom was saved for those who claimed to have witnessed Pettigrew's confession.
should be used to the thing. He couldn't keep it off his face as he carried his nightmare cargo to the boiling cauldron. He looked more frightened of it too than he had even been of Sirius. The thought of what Wormtail had done to Uncle Sirius, made a voice in Draco's head say
Dantanian linked his hands behind Dorian's neck and pulled him into the kiss he demanded. Dorian's mouth met his still open, breath unsteady and wet and uncertain. Dantanian kissed him with the unskilled excitement of one who had never been kissed before. That did not deter Dorian. He gave in to the kiss and took it over, pulling Dantanian's face up to kiss properly, eyes falling shut while Dantanian's stayed open. It was not in detachment. His pupils were dilating, dark eyes wild, and he was the first one to moan into the kiss. He made a childish protesting noise, and then some little confused ones, when Dorian pulled away.
," Severus said, rubbing his eyes, "There was a reason Grindelwald could not use the wands he had made. Either the heartstring was too rotted to be an active ingredient, and only the trace of Dantanian's blood fuels the wand, or else it is a mixture. Either way, he would have needed Black blood to make any of the wands come to life. Which he would have known, if he had any
"Two? You're not taking Care of Magical Creatures, Draco?" Potter asked, sounding disappointed. "Which electives are you doing?"
"You know, I believe you," Draco said thoughtfully, though he could only guess based off that mild reaction. It was still more than most anyone else had to go off. "But you know who did."
"Stay away from him!" Draco yelled, and had a sudden, horrible suspicion of what might befall Severus from the Hogwarts High Inquisitor, should Draco not produce results for her.
Draco had been in more peril than she might suspect at that party alone, to say nothing of his pursuits at Grimmauld, but he let her rant on, abandoning his first instinct to unburden himself in turn. He was beginning to feel very old, with Pansy now hiding from him every chance she could. His messages through Millie that he wasn't going to seek retribution just seemed to make the poor girl think him
Draco marched over, incredulous, and sure enough, he alone had a notation next to his name that marked he would be going to McGonagall's office.
"You already have your Amaranthium, Striker, you don't need more magic," Draco teased, "Maybe you should wear it to ask Ron to the masquerade... you are going to ask him, aren't you?"
"He only asked me because Hermione Granger was already taken," she said with a shrug. Unfortunately, Luna had ceased terrorizing Michael long enough for her ears to perk up.
. "Difficult, very difficult. An unusual case, I see. Sorted before into Slytherin. From a Slytherin family, asking for Slytherin, with all the cunning and thirst to prove yourself that Salazar could ever have hoped. Once. Now, that lies there beaten down in the past. Yes, you would have fit Slytherin then nicely, though you have your fair share of book smarts. And somewhere, perhaps in you, waiting to be born- your own narrow kind of loyalty..."
Back in the blue loop, Draco had imagined Potter excited for the First Task, chomping at the bit to get his arrogant self out there in the spotlight and claim yet more glory for his Chosen One shtick. The opposite couldn't be more true. The closer it got to the end of November, the more Potter became a nervous wreck, to the point Draco began grudgingly offering him some of his own calming draughts. Having Ron be Potter's friend again seemed to help, but it couldn't do anything to lift the fear of humiliation or death that seemed to haunt Potter all the time now, a fear he seemed ready to sooner die than admit to Draco. He overheard Harry telling Luna and Hermione, and even Ron once that he had no idea what was coming, and how that drove him insane. But when
power. He even threw in a prayer to the demon goddess Hecate, feeling at the moonstone dagger in his other pocket before pulling his right hand out. The talon wand seemed to purr at the current he was letting flow through, though it seemed readier to lash out than protect.
"No, Dobby. I- Harry, Harry Potter, he'll be- he'll be there too, soon. You should- you should go if you can, to look after- watch over him." Draco grabbed the wall again, world spinning, wondering with some detached Severus-like disgust if he was the one acting like a Gryffindor now.
Draco found it hard not to stare at the Sword of Gryffindor, the gleam of bright rubies like fresh blood transmuted right to gems. It was so difficult to look Dumbledore in those piercing unsettling blue eyes, it was already tempting to look almost anywhere else.
"Draco was," Luna asked, with the implication seeming to dawn clearly in her sad eyes as well as the court's ears.
"Oh, so if it's a punishment," Draco hissed, flattening his hands against Harry's chest, "You won't mind if I stop, then, will you?"
It was an easy enough task to sneak with the invisibility cloak into the medical bay that night, and give the three sinners their reprieve of Vernidemnidas while they slept. He even manfully resisted the urge to give the sleeping Smith an avant-garde haircut on his way out.
Potter stared at him after he cheered, and Draco made a juvenile face back at him, scrunching up his features and wiggling his head to the side. Out of all the things Draco had allegedly done, was celebrating his godfather's success really worth looking at him for?
Remus lingered in the living room after, nobly resisting the urge to eavesdrop, but Draco had no such compunctions whatsoever. He went straight up once the door to Remus and Sirius's room had closed, pressing his ear up to the hard wood. He could only make out the muffled notes of Sirius's enthused baritone. "Damn it," he breathed, "He must not be the near the door."
The realization Severus would not trust any of Draco's dormmates with his things felt cold, but he shouldn't be surprised. What, had he expected
It was annoying. Draco didn't know how much his carefully crafted tough dark wizard mystique would crack under the knowledge he hung out playing Quidditch with celebrities. Bad enough everyone already thought he'd rescued half the population of Beauxbatons before strolling up and casting the Dark Mark.
"But if they do expel me, can I please come back here and live with you and Remus? I don't care if you lose your trial, it doesn't matter, I'd even go on the run with you if we had to! I wouldn't mind! I wouldn't be any trouble, I promise, and I have money..."
Dumbledore strode over to the door and opened it. "Bed rest and perhaps a large, steaming mug of hot chocolate. I always find that cheers me up," he added, twinkling kindly down at her. "You will find that Madam Pomfrey is still awake. She's just giving out Mandrake juice- I dare say the Basilisk's victims will be waking up any moment."
"We've been playing Quidditch every day," she was telling her, "Me and Ron and Harry, and then Luna and Bill sometimes join in to make it three on three, but with you and Draco here, we can have a proper game. Especially if Fred and George stop by before dinner..."
"And wrecked your dressing room?" Remus sighed, pocketing his wand and pinching the bridge of his nose.
He was proved right, as he was forced to leave after literal hours of questioning, and pull Harry aside to make an offer he didn't want to make. "Listen, it wasn't my idea," Draco explained, "But Dumbledore really thinks that after what happened with Mr. Weasley and Nagini, you should start getting lessons in Occlumency again. And I'll do it again, if it's the fate of the bloody wizarding world on the line like Dumbledore made it sound."
If Dorian had been older, or perhaps less rushed by the impending Sorting, he might have noticed the way Dantanian stiffened and looked at Lamia, in real fear that Dorian somehow had something on him. But Dorian was too busy reaching into his bag and producing a Periander family tree. "Here!" Dorian said triumphantly, unfolding a very worn and dog-eared parchment, and pointed to one of Lamia's cousins, on her uncle's side. The name
The rest of the Sorting passed unnoticed by Draco. Luna stroked his hair, letting him lean his head on her shoulder. He shut his eyes, until curiosity made him look in the direction of Gryffindor. He was resolutely pretending Slytherin didn't exist.
"He's a traitor!" Karkaroff exclaimed, running over and throwing himself at the feet of Father. Karkaroff must have regarded him as the real power there, even if he should have heard that the one put in charge today, the one still in favor, was Bellatrix. "He's a traitor, you see! He's on their side! I am not! I am loyal to you, Lucius! I am loyal to our great Dark Lord, I never lost the faith, I have been waiting for his return, I will prove it you-"
"No! Maybe someone should have yelled at him a long time ago!" Sirius whirled back on Draco, with a ferocious fire in those dark eyes so much like Phineas's recently emptied ones. "What is this? Some kind of childish retaliation against Dumbledore? Your godfather?
Potter laughed, more gentle than mocking, before raking a hand back through his unruly dark hair. "Anyway, I just- I'm glad you're alright. And I'll leave you alone, I will, just- I have something for you that I keep meaning to give you and I keep forgetting..."
The unquestioning faith in Luna's voice made something in Draco finally, finally crack. "Take this, then," he said, reaching into his pocket and shoving the vial at her. "It's Pensieve memories." He grabbed the bag from his luggage where he had put Severus's books, pages still marked, and shoved them at her too. "You can look- I don't know, I'd imagine the Room of Requirement could make a Pensieve for you if you wanted. Whatever, just don't try and use Snape's Pensieve. But look at the memories, and read what the books say after. Try and understand, and then- then try and tell me I'm wrong, that you'd be better off without me."
you're a really sweet person- you've got everything in the world going for you, so just try and move on, you'll have plenty of options-"
. I used Serpensmorta on Aunt Bella and she just cast Vipera relashio and kept on against me, this isn't helping if you can't replicate what she-"
"I didn't think it would really hurt him," Luna said nervously, casting a furtive glance at Neville that seemed to try to conceal her solicitude towards him. It was obvious in that one look how much of Luna still wished she was dating Neville. Even if she had also enjoyed casting Verniculpa on him.
"No, that wouldn't work either! He's trying to say that-" When Draco's tongue locked as faithfully to his own mouth, as always, he concealed it, waiting for it to unlock. "Damn it, Grindelwald! Damn it all! You
"Lord Voldemort's gift for spreading discord and enmity is very great. We can fight it only by showing an equally strong bond of friendship and trust. Differences of habit and language are nothing at all if our aims are identical and our hearts are open.
The belief in Potter's guilt, possibly with Draco's help, wouldn't have been even noteworthy to him, should Ron not have also persisted in it. Even though he had far less reason than he'd had to persist thinking Draco the Heir of Slytherin in second year. Ron's lack of faith seemed what made Potter the most miserable. "I could cope with the rest of the school if I could just have Ron back. But I'm not going to try and persuade Ron to talk to me if he doesn't want to..."
wanted to, didn't you?" Draco whispered. "In Hagrid's hut. When you saw Sirius again, and he was begging you to believe him, and you still thought he was lying. I saw you mouth the word Crucio. I can never miss the look of that word. Never. I know how it feels. It has this special feel on your mouth, like a blade you're sharpening..."
"I wouldn't lie," Luna said, although Draco knew that itself to be a lie. He didn't know how convincingly she had delivered it, either.
Gilderoy squared his shoulders, tossed back his unruly gold hair, and recited in far better Catalan, "Aigua de l'estany, possessio del senyor, flux! Estany infernal, estany de L'Inframon, estany de L'Infern, flux! Flux!
"Yes, he'll be the maddest at me," Draco said tightly, gesturing at the Black tapestry and then more widely at the house around them. He didn't gesture at Ron and Hermione, but he knew their companionship would have to be honestly included in that scope as well. "Because this has been mine, and it should have been his." The idea of him getting to talk to Harry through the mirror himself had been a non-starter with Sirius and Remus. Draco had the suspicion Dumbledore had instructed them to keep Harry in the dark.
yours!" Gilderoy cried out, truth forced out of him now of all times, and just like that, Severus's pacing ceased.
Draco's hand ran reflexively over the claw-shaped wand in his pocket. "Moony was Lupin. And the others?"
"Oh, and we were looking for a certain location in Islington. It's called Grimmauld Place," Draco added, dropping it in as if a casual aside, while Hermione counted out the correct number of paper pieces to give the man. "Is that a street in Islington, by any chance? I have family there."
It made him uncomfortable staring at it now, thinking with bewilderment on how different he had been back then, and how little he would like that person now if they ever came face to face. But he had resolved not to change any of the writing at the top of the pages from his first recording, to keep it as accurate a memory of the past as possible, so 'the ugly Mudblood' stayed.
"It's different," said Draco, but he had no desire to hurt her by explaining that Luna made far more interesting sartorial choices, such as today's ribbon-crossed Rapunzel braid and earrings in the shape of armadillos. "She's my cousin-"
The Malfoys always had loved to talk of being descended from Slytherin, Grandfather Abraxas's portrait most of all. If Tom Riddle had been the Heir of Slytherin, or at least bright enough to pretend to be- and Draco kept hearing how
"I don't know, maybe," Draco said, which what seemed a shockingly lackadaisical attitude to Weasley, judging by his face. "That will do. It'll be good to have a memory aid to study at more length." Draco went over to one of the desks and sat down, wondering where he had seen something like it before. He flipped through his notebook and a word caught his eye in the very first entry:
"But you're going to teach the Slytherins?" she asked indignantly. "What is it you're planning, Draco? For the Slytherins to all have their faces shielded from the weather, while Gryffindor is caught in the rain?"
Draco was silent for so long it felt he had passed out. There was a ringing in his ears, or perhaps a roaring. "The eclipse," he finally said, and Grindelwald nodded. "The blood moon." Another nod. "Your beloved Blutmond." Nod again. "A ritual has to be done, to get the third mirror.
He had none of those compunctions when it came to Smith. His fingers itched in his pocket poised over the talon wand, when he walked past Smith at dinner. He was running his mouth to Hannah Abbott, Susan Bones, and a group of other female Hufflepuffs. Abbott and Bones had both had their mothers killed in the past months. You would think the universe would not also be so cruel as to inflict
"Theo," Draco said, taking him to the back of their dorm to look him dead in the eye. There would be no wiggling out of this for Theo. "Do you
"No," said Mr. Weasley looking extremely grave. "They've pulled us all off our regular jobs at the Ministry to try and find him, but no luck so far."
Draco went and got himself a glass of water from the bathroom, making himself drink it to calm the feeling of pure bloodlust, thrumming to the pitch of excitement of the talon wand. "So is that what you wanted to talk to me about?"
"Draco, if this discussion is becoming too upsetting for you, we can take a break or reschedule to finish-"
"You mean your thirteenth birthday?" Draco laughed. "That was just you, me, her, and Dobby down in a random hall in the dungeons."
"You talked to Snape about us?" Harry said, face lighting up in an inappropriately huge smile, and Draco put his head in his hands.
“Nothing, Professor,” Pansy chirps. “Just that Draco didn’t really enjoy his little probation as a polecat.”
“Brilliant, aren’t they?” Malfoy says, slipping smoothly down from the tree and sauntering over. “But look!”
It seems entirely too long before Professor McGonagall steps out onto the floor on the arm of Professor Dumbledore, and all of the teachers begin to follow suit. Parvati steers him around the new additions to the dancefloor, a number that grows on every beat as their friends and schoolmates decide to face the music.
“Well, I fed him a few bits by hand, and it seemed to encourage him to finish the bowl,” Harry says. “And everyone but Phobos seems to be using the litter tray. Clever, aren’t they.”
He glances around at the others, but they’re not paying him any attention. Cedric is pacing, and Fleur and Krum are back to looking mildly ill.
doesn’t know) come twirling past before Ginny steals her away, and then Harry’s being dragged farther into the fray by Katie and Alicia and loses all bearings as to where he is.
“Oh, a Gregorovitch creation. Outstanding craftmanship, I must agree. Hornbeam and dragon heartstring?” Viktor nods. “Rather larger in diameter than one usually sees… Ten and a quarter inches, quite rigid. Avis!”
Skeeter smiles and reaches back into her bag. She pulls out a long, acid green quill and a roll of parchment. She leaves the parchment hanging in the air between herself and Harry and brings the tip of the quill to her lips. She sucks it for a moment with discomforting and apparent relish before setting it against the parchment. It shivers and flicks its long tail.
Her friends giggle and hide their mouths behind their hands. Lavender whispers loudly to a girl with very blonde hair.
Harry looks over his shoulder and looks between all of the couples behind him. Madame Maxime is very conspicuously dwarfing Hagrid, Professor Dumbledore is terrorising Professor Trelawney, by the looks, and, ah… Ron and Blaise. Ron is as red as Harry expects, anxious and spluttering and still very willing in Blaise’s hands. He snickers.
Malfoy glares at him, and for a moment Harry thinks he’s going to refuse. He steps forward, though, and Harry realises that he may have made a mistake.
The others make noises of appreciation. He pushes some money into the hands of Dean and Seamus.  “We’ll open the statue when you get back, just make sure you don’t get caught!”
“Has Wandle been eating properly?” Malfoy asks, sitting down and peering into the pit of fur. “He seemed to have lost his appetite when I had him Wednesday night.”
and it had taken all his willpower not to burst into flames and instead pretend he had no idea what she was talking about, other than
“A most extraordinary performance we have seen tonight,” Dumbledore continues when the fuss settles. “I must commend you all on your incredible talents and flair for the dramatics. Now, I welcome all of you, ladies, gentlemen, ghosts, and particularly
She, Harry and Ron run out to the front of the castle just before dinner that evening, when fewest people are around.
He stalks off, back to the castle entrance, though the drama is sort of diminished by the fact that they’re all going the same way.
In front of them are four colossal, towering dragons. They roar and shoot spires of flame into the sky, and Harry is transfixed in terror.
Just then, her reply, if she’d had one, was drowned out by the flutter and flapping of hundreds of pairs of wings. Harry grabs the letter Hedwig drops before it can land in his beans. He hands her some bacon and hastily opens the letter one-handed.
“Don't be ridiculous, that would be much too much strain for any one of us,” Hermione says. “If we could help, then maybe, but we can't.”
The school carriages are tied not too far from where they’re walking the perimeter of the courtyard. A couple of them shudder in ways that Harry would rather not think about, and then of course
By the time Madam Hooch is yelling at them to hurry up and get ready to greet their guests, Harry’s team is winning by a hair. Malfoy is, admittedly, a much better-matched opponent. Both of them have caught the snitch only once.
“Hey,” Harry murmurs, placing his hand gently on Ron’s shoulder. “How about I go and find someone to help?”
The Ravenclaws and Slytherins get to their feet to cheer. Not to be outdone, Gryffindor and Hufflepuff scramble to follow, leaving their guests looking thoroughly taken aback. Hermione gets many claps on the back, and goes quite red with pride.
The morning of the thirtieth finally arrives, though with fog, and Harry gathers the fast-growing kittens from Hermione as they head down to Sunday breakfast.
Maybe one day I'll finish, maybe one day, but for now this is as far as we get. Not so bad though, yeah?
Ron exhales loudly and stretches his arms, sprawled on the grass with Hermione and Zabini. “I dunno about you guys, but
Harry soars upwards, just inches from the chasm wall, fumbling his wand back into its leather strappings. A burst of fire tears the air several feet to his left.
“Make sure you do!” Ginny shouts, but he doesn’t reply. He forces a grin and a thumbs-up for some third-years who shout
The house tables have gone out the window, as always, and people are rushing about shrieking and chattering like never before. There are possibly a thousand turkeys and plates of roast potatoes, entire cooked hams and mountains of vegetables and actual boatfuls of gravy. Harry, looking for any remaining spaces to sit, spies Cho, Cedric, Krum and Fleur all in one and beelines for them, only to realise too late that with them comes—
The pegasi—the closest match Harry can think of—can now be seen to all be taller-than-an-elephant, short-haired palominos. A single one of their stamping black hooves is easily bigger than Harry’s arm is long, and they snort and shake their heads furiously. Flaming eyes roll in glistening sockets, and wings with a span of the Gryffindor common room fold elegantly to their sides.
Snape’s lip curls more than Harry’s ever thought possible. “I rather trust you not to go mixing yourself up with Potter’s reign of terror, Draco, or have you too taken leave of your senses?”
Harry taps his wand against his palm. The robes are quite atrocious, really, but there’s nothing Harry knows how to do that could fix them. “None of us have anything else…”
“Testing,” she says, and the quill begins to move. “My name is Rita Skeeter, reporter for the Daily Prophet.”
He frowns, barely restraining his knee-jerk reaction to cross out the idea immediately. He’s not… Well, Hermione said so herself: there’s nothing wrong with it. He’s not scared of the possibility. Better not to leap head-first to conclusions, though.
“You’re bullying me again. This isn’t fair. It’s not like Harry’s any better. Hell, he’s worse! He’s wearing that stupid badge! And you—stop hanging out with my brother! He’s an idiot, and you’re way above him!”
“Yes,” he says quietly, “most impressive. Nine and a half inches, inflexible… Rosewood… Containing… Oh my.”
There’s a tiny flash of gold to Harry’s left, and he wheels around immediately to go after it. Malfoy is at his side in an instant, low over his broom and grinning from ear to ear. Harry leans lower and pushes his Firebolt further. The wind rips through his hair and through his too-thin jumper, and it sets his skin ablaze. The snitch flits in front of them, dropping suddenly. Harry barely dips his broom handle to swoop gratuitously, and Malfoy corkscrews perfectly to drop below him. They close in, fizzing with adrenaline, arms outstretched. Malfoy tips towards him but he refuses to flinch, pushing his broom and reaching ever farther. Just as the tips of his fingers brush tiny golden wings, Malfoy lurches forward and closes his hand.
“Harry and I are going to find somewhere quiet so I can ask him a little about how it feels to be in such a controversial position,” Skeeter tells him. Harry is surprised she doesn’t pet him on the head and call him a good boy, for all her voice drips with condescension.
“The thing is,” George cuts in, eased expertly away from the other two, “he slipped up and forgot he was supposed to be asking about you too, Harry. He wasn’t very subtle before that, but now it’s just a bit pathetic.”
Malfoy, startled and frowning, meanders over from his conversation with a group of Beauxbatons girls. “I don’t know what your prerogative is, Potter, so I’ll ask you to kindly leave me alone,” he grumbles.
Mr Crouch, Ludo Bagman, Professor Karkaroff and Madam Maxime are all newly sat at the table. Rita Skeeter settles herself in a corner and retrieves both quill and parchment.
“I’m not the Hogwarts champion, Cedric is. Maybe now everyone will stop thinking I’m trying to steal his thunder.”
Fleur is right, of course. The staff this year have really outdone themselves, with freshly polished, singing suits of armour, endless strings of real holly and fir and dozens upon dozens of towering conifers, all covered in snow. There are live faeries and little golden owls all over, and everything glitters with frost and house-coloured ornaments. Even the charmed bloody mistletoe is back, though Harry suspects it’s Fred and George again rather than a new Christmas staple. He’s already narrowly missed being caught with Neville twice this morning.
Krum stands and pats Cedric on the shoulder before he reclaims his seat. He hands his wand to Mr Ollivander and stands tall, hands braced at his back.
“You’re mental,” Ron tells his brother. Fred pays him no attention, having leant down to talk quietly with Hermione, already leading her from the hall.
They make their way to the dungeons silently, ignoring the brushing of shoulders under the cloak. Harry stops in front of the bare stretch of wall hiding the Slytherin common room.
I had planned to finish the book (as you do), but for JKR and motivation related reasons I have not. I hate that she's ruined something that has brought an awful lot of people so much joy, but I also despise how she decided it a good idea to use her very considerable platform to attack me and my friends and our loving, peaceful, worldwide community so blatantly. I hope all of you are well and looking after yourselves despite her atrocities and the state of the world right now <3
“Dean! Shut up!” Seamus swats at him, red in the face. Ginny cackles and threatens to test him on it. Seamus smacks her too.
“Good thing I got one for you then, isn’t it?” He leans across the table and prods it onto the side of her nose. “There! Now we both have pretty eyes.”
Hermione looks over from scribbling distractedly in her notebook. “As long as you leave them with water and something to do.”
Rita Skeeter pulls open another door a few paces from where they are. “We don’t want to be in there with all that noise,” she says, opening the door. “Ah, this’ll do. Nice and cosy.”
“Well, you can come if you be quiet and don’t make a fuss,” Harry allows. He digs into his cottage pie and tries to ignore the buzzing in his stomach.
“Cedric!” several people shout. Cedric turns around just in time to be piled upon by five of his friends shouting and congratulating him.
god no. Even looking back now, he decides he has no idea how he ever survived his relatives’ bigotry. Why Uncle Vernon had ever let him out of the house when he was so clearly not one of them. How lucky he is to still be alive, despite being both queer
“I wonder what the tasks are going to be,” Ron says. “I bet we could do them no problem, Harry. We’ve done all sorts of dangerous things before.”
Harry snorts. Beside him Ron makes a retching noise. Hermione steps over under the pretense of plonking Avennia onto Harry’s shoulder.
They go to bed disgruntled and without a plan, suddenly highly conscious of the looming date of the first task.
Harry turns back to Ron and Hermione waiting for him at the door, snatching his bag and the cat sub-crate off his desk as he passes. “I’m so stuffed.”
“…and when we went out to see, it turns out that those Weasley twins of yours ’ad just decided to make us a fireworks display!” Fleur says brightly. Her laughter tinkles across the hall, easily distracting at least half of the occupants at the nearest tables, including Parvati, Cedric and Krum. Davies keeps missing his mouth with his fork. Harry tries not to laugh, really he does.
“What do you want?” Harry asks, trudging over. Closer, he notices the large badges they have pinned to their robes. For a wild moment he thinks they’re S.P.E.W badges, but then he sees the glowing golden words.
“Well, we have,” he tells her, tilting his head to indicate Fred. “Been down loads of times to nick food, so we’ve met them.”
“What?” Harry yelps, but not before he feels a hand close around his wrist and yank him towards… a direction. There are a lot of people they have to fight their way through, but Harry can’t help but think it’s totally worth the bumping around when the crowd finally spits them back out onto the sidelines. He spends an unashamed few moments with his hands on his knees trying to get his breath back.
For reasons unknown, George tries his level best to badger Warrington into giving him a congratulatory kiss. Fred and Maxine egg him on, and Malfoy and Ginny heckle from the back. Such a bizarre scene, Harry isn’t sure he’s been privy to before. The lot of them race back to the castle once they’ve stowed their brooms, stumbling and shoving and raucous. Ginny wins by a mile, leading the lions’ way up to the Gryffindor Tower. The seven of them duck behind large tapestries when they hear Peeves approaching, and giggle between themselves sneaking away.
“Still, looks like your badge survived.” Cedric nods to his shoulder and Harry looks down. Sure enough the badge remains, if a little discoloured, completely intact. The words aren’t even flickering.
With an odd, panic-compelled timing, Malfoy’s snide words from a measly two evenings ago rattle their way into his head.
“Well anyway, she was a bit annoying about it, but no more than everyone else who refuses to believe me.”
Professor Moody hobbles swiftly into the courtyard before them, wand out and levelled straight at Malfoy. Malfoy shrieks and Harry turns, just in time to see him shrink instantaneously into the body of a long white ferret. A few gasps and quiet laughs echo around them. Harry is too transfixed by the sight of ferret-Malfoy skittering around in the grass to notice.
“Angie, darling!” Fred says, loudly, as he throws open the dormitory door. “I hope you aren’t stealing these young things away from their dates?”
Draco shakes out the last of the snow and turns around with a dramatic flare of his cloak. “Oh, you’re
At the arranged time, Harry feigns tiredness and escapes to his room. Ron goes with him, waiting for him to put on the invisibility cloak before heading back down.
She takes Harry and Hermione gently by the wrists, leading them into the midst of the very, very odd mix of people. Harry talks to her friends from Beauxbatons and she insists they introduce her to all number of people from Hogwarts, even ones they don’t really know. Cedric and Cho dive in to help them soon enough, and Harry can trip his way back onto the sidelines and away from the crowds.
Parvati drops her wand and takes a couple of breaths. “I’m not sweating for you, Weasley. If you want that ruffle fixed you’re going to have to find someone else.”
“This is surprisingly in-depth,” he admits, handing it back. “I didn’t know you could tell who’s who through those smudgy old specs.”
“Harry,” Parvati hisses out of the side of her mouth. Harry looks up and realises that all of the lanterns on the tables have dimmed, and that the other champions and their partners are standing up. He hurries to his feet and to help Parvati over to the floor, taking up position as one of four points on this Triwizard compass. He mixes up his hands and gets glared at and forcefully corrected, all luckily in time for the first few notes of the night.
“Nothing gets in the way of a good story,” Skeeter says lightly. Her bloody Quick-Quotes Quill is hovering around again. Harry would quite like to set it on fire.
“Now?” Draco says, and this time he’s the one parroting. “What do you mean, now? Why all of a sudden? Why, after all I’ve tried to—”
By Friday all the constant talk of dancing and dates has Harry both exhausted and tied up in knots. He lies in his bed in the dormitory, staring unseeingly up at the canopy and listening to Ron’s snores.
“Socks!” Dobby exclaims. “Thank you Harry Potter, socks is Dobby’s favourite clothes!” He pulls them on immediately, the purple working wonders with his bauble-toggled tea cosy hat. He pulls out a small package of brown paper and presents it to Harry.
A volley of stunning spells soars over the stadium and sparks against the horntail’s scales. She wails and staggers over to her nest before collapsing, great wings shielding it from prying eyes.
The next time he takes back custody of his new fluffy friends is on Friday, the morning he sends off the letter to Sirius.
Sure enough, when they join the rest of the class lining up along the Potions corridor, Harry sees the little badge glinting in the low light. Malfoy, currently looking away from them, has pinned it to his other lapel in an attempt to draw attention away from it. The fact that it’s still there is incredible enough.
He follows her gaze to Malfoy watching them with a tiny tilt to his mouth. Harry gives him a small, unsure wave. He turns around swiftly.
“As it should be!” Fleur agrees, swooping in to join them. Her dress is flowy and a beautiful lilac, drifting around her calves like the air itself. “Come on, all of you!”
“Harry!” Hermione greets them, somewhat strangled, and throws her arms around his neck. Angelina ruffles his hair and Katie smacks his shoulder “For luck!”
“Oh, very funny!” Hermione says scathingly. The other Slytherins snicker and press their badges. “Harry, come on,” she’s saying, but Harry’s too busy grinning to pay attention.
see the tournament through, and I must reiterate the weight of the choice you are making: these games are not for the faint-hearted. I beg of you, make sure you are prepared to perform to what is asked of you before you enter.”
“One, two, three!” their friends all chant from across the hall, and Harry’s ruthless yank is rewarded with the largest fountain of glitter yet. It’s the size of at least three of their party poppers and drifts over more than half the hall.
Harry rolls his eyes and strides out into the corridor. “I don’t know, Ron, I don’t bloody know. It’s not like you’re free of this either. Everyone’s going to be taking someone.”
“You’re mean,” Ginny tells the twins a second time when they’re walking down to the stadium. The two of them pause in their calls of “Place your bets!” and, “Who do
“Bummer,” George shakes his head as they approach, “we’ll have to chase him up with this. We can owl it soon, or just shove it into his hand. Can’t avoid us forever.”
From their vantage point at the foot of the castle, the whole school has a clear view of the disturbance in the water. No longer is its surface pristine and glassy, but bubbling and rippling quite disturbingly. Waves begin to wash over the shore, just as a gaping vortex appears in the centre. The water swells and churns, and a long, black pole begins to emerge from within.
Even under their sensible cloaks, all of Hogwarts are beginning to shuffle their feet around in search of warmth. Harry can hear Parvati complaining to Lavender, and he silently agrees. The unsettling gigantic horses are still standing only about twenty feet away from them, snorting and snuffling around.
He wants to curl up and hide. “I knew… It isn’t something I want to think about. They said it’d be safer, this year. I’m just playing along to stay alive, really. Cedric’s the real Hogwarts champion—”
Hagrid is already approaching the door of the Beauxbatons carriage, and they have to jog to catch up.
Back at the tower, Harry meets Ginny as she’s climbing out of the portrait. She grins and waves him over, and he happily turns around to walk her to Charms, hoping that he’ll meet Cedric on the way. For all he likes Ron’s family, he realises he barely knows Ginny outside of their passing conversations at mealtimes, and he thinks he really ought to start being a better friend.
A scrap of parchment is making its way around the tables at lunch. In its wake follow gushes of whispering and giggling, and people with tiny coloured stars on their lapels. Some are on cuffs, jumper sleeves, even skin. Harry looks on in confusion until the paper lands in his hands.
Ron snorts. Malfoy huffs, dislodging a strand of hair that’s fallen into his face. It resettles at the corner of his eye, and Harry really wishes he would just tuck it back.
“School seems a silly thing to be worried about, what with someone possibly out to get you killed,” Ron muses.
Sadly, because it has to at some point, the next Friday comes around. Since the introduction of Hagrid’s group project, most of the fourth year Slytherins and Gryffindors had been startlingly civil. In fact, the only nice interactions Harry have had with those outside of his house have been with Malfoy, Zabini, and Parkinson. Ish. Harry thinks he must be really desperate if he’s calling Malfoy and Parkinson nice (ish).
“Someone’s had a look at their vocabulary list this week,” Harry mutters under his breath. “I was just going to ask you about this idea Davies had, about formations.”
He holds up a hand. “Nobody is expecting instant results. If you want my help, at least do as I ask you.”
It seems that the moment every plate in the room is abandoned, they all vanish at once. Dumbledore stands and beckons for everyone else to follow, and with a wave of his wand all of the tables rearrange themselves to provide refreshments and seating at the back of the hall. He conjures a raised platform to the side of the head table, onto which stumps a musical group Harry has never seen before. A set of drums, several guitars, a keyboard, lute, and cello are all present on the stage and quickly taken up by the musicians.
The Entrance Hall is alive with movement, despite heads of houses sorting their students into relative order. Someone elbows Neville in the side, and Seamus trips over his shoelaces into the back of Hufflepuff seventh-year Beatrice Haywood.
Harry, Ron and Ginny end up joining the four-a-side pick-up Quidditch game on the lawns with Alicia Spinnet and Katie Bell. They’re met by Ravenclaw Seeker Cho Chang and Keeper Grant Page, and Hufflepuff Beater Maxine O’Flaherty.
“We’ve spoken,” Ron mumbles, face absolutely burning. Harry sits down on the sofa and pats him on the back a few times.
that ladies and gentlemen?” Ludo Bagman exclaims. Harry makes a lap around the stadium on his Firebolt. The horntail follows his path, arcing her neck like a black, scaly version of Dudley’s old slinky before it tangled. The chains around her ankles have been set in concrete.
On Saturday, Malfoy approaches Harry at the breakfast first. Honestly, it sounds like it could be the beginning to a bad joke.
It has a strange, skeletal atmosphere, as if raised long lost from the bottom of the ocean and returned to purpose. The rigging drapes aesthetically, functional but greying, and the portholes are filled with a misty light that makes the whole ship seem like it’s shrouded in fog.
He forces the horntail over and around narrow obstructions as many times as he can, speeding inelegantly over the grounds. The forest trees will provide no cover, and he decides that he’d rather not get them set on fire.
Still, other houses do not hesitate to make fun of him at any given opportunity. They’re on him when they’re out in Hogsmeade, when he’s walking through the castle, and even at meals. If it’s not for making an arse of himself as a champion, it’s now for making an arse of himself fictionally. Professor McGonagall has cuffed ten or so people around the head for their comments, which has been most satisfying, and the majority of his fellow fourth-years are kind enough not to jab and jeer at him every three seconds. Regardless, he’s still huffy and irritated enough that on Monday when he hears someone call his name he lashes out without hesitation.
“You could,” George suggests, just as Fred knocks the side of his head and stands, stretching upward.
Realising Hermione is now captured by the twins, Harry looks over to Ron and sighs. Ron shrugs and gives him a long suffering expression.
Having gathered over time into the vibrance of the common room, the whole house seems to up and take their leave all at once to head for the Great Hall. Harry can see Colin leaping up and down several metres in front of him, and Ginny off to the side clinging to the legs of the girl currently balanced on her shoulders. All of them are drowned in woolen jumpers in, mostly, varying shades of red and gold, and also a lot of glitter, because Fred keeps setting off bunches of handmade party poppers.
but I named these two,” she replies, hoisting them into her arms. “This is Wandle, and this is Marcassin.”
“Nope, this is it, this is the end for me.” He throws a dramatic hand to his forehead and pretends to faint.
. Their hooves hit the ground with a minor earthquake, galloping tremendously past the astonished rows of students. The carriage comes crashing down behind its steeds, bouncing and rolling at an alarming pace.
The green dragon snaps its head around and roars. Harry is torn between covering his ears and taking hold of Malfoy’s shoulder to hold himself up. Malfoy himself is tense, poised on the edge as if ready to bolt. Harry takes hold of his upper arm anyway, both to prevent him running and to keep himself standing, and Malfoy takes a deep, shaky breath.
Her hair bounces in a set of elaborate and impressively-tight curls, and she has jewelled spectacles perched on her nose. Fingers with long crimson nails grip a crocodile-skin clutch.
“Common Welsh green, sorry,” Harry corrects himself. “I mean, if you don’t believe me, you can ask Malfoy—”
Snape sneers at them again before whirling around and clipping off back down the walkway. “See to it that it stays that way!”
She stands him in the middle of the rug in front of the fireplace and circles him, taking in his baggy jeans and navy jumper and the probably-wrinkled shirt beneath. She lifts the hem just to check, rolling her eyes when he yelps.
Once again, chattering breaks out while they choose their seats. Ron tries to shuffle Hermione over to make room, but his hero sits himself firmly at the Hufflepuff table.
“How horrible!” Hermione says. “I’ve seen some of her articles, and they’re all a load of absolute rubbish! I don’t know if I’ve ever seen a genuine truth in one of them
“One of these!” Harry says, showing him the parchment. He taps the green star and presses it to his own cheekbone before taking another. Ron takes the parchment, picking up a star and pressing it to Hermione’s nose.
“Yeah. That’s if I don’t cock up summoning the one thing it relies on. Sirius was going to tell us something useful…”
“So, what exactly have you got there, Granger?” Fred Weasley asks, sliding into the seat beside her. Harry sighs with relief—an angel disguised with forked red tail. “You’ve been carrying that crate around for two months, I’ve been dying to see inside.”
“This is brilliant, isn’t it Harry!” Colin says as soon as the door closes behind them. “Just brilliant, you being champion!”
There are ruffles and drapings of silk lining the walls, dripping from sconces and adorning the arms of the gleaming suits of armour that now move without so much as a clank. Rich, thick tablecloths have been lain out over the highly-polished wood of the house tables, each in their corresponding colours, with embroidered table runners shimmering gold and silver beneath the platters they boast. The cutlery and crockery of each table have been embellished with their house mascot and the school crest. Matching napkins have delicate embroidery and are impressively presented.
Harry looks down. The python is disappearing off to investigate a chair. “Oh, yeah. I, um, need some help sending them back.”
Cedric pulling Harry aside, behind the suit of armour, and the way it had sent his heart to his throat. Ginny falling into his lap and the heat that had set off inexplicable shivers. Ron’s arm resting gently around his waist. Hermione staring up at him in her attractive party clothes. Draco’s hand brushing his beneath the cloak.
“What, really?” he asks, bewildered. “You would take me? I mean, you’d go with me?” All of them laugh, and he flushes even harder.
“I could have sworn I had two badges when we went to Hagrid’s… I gave him one, but the other has—oh!” She pulls her hand out of the plastic pocket, two shiny golden galleons in hand.
Their first report was due in on Monday, so Harry handed his summary, which was rather more like a log of any and all activity, over to Malfoy to skim.
The music has taken a drastic turn. Harry assumes this is more the band’s regular programme, with the cheering crowd and rowdy flailing. It kind of looks like his worst nightmare, and he must accidentally show it on his face.
“I know, Potter, and that’s why we need to teach you,” Malfoy says. Hermione glances at him, then does a double take. “But first we figure out the rest of Weasley’s idea.”
“George wants to invite him to the ball, of course!” Fred grins. George tuts and smacks at his face.
Fred glances at him with a split-second startled expression before pulling out The Grin. “Well, my good looks can’t be the only thing going for me, can they? I have to be better than George somehow.”
“Oi, why couldn’t we have had that?” Seamus asks. “Do you know how hard it is to sneak out of that basement?”
He runs his fingers delicately down the length of the wand and mutters a quick “Orchideous!”. A neat, flourishing bunch of peonies, irises and camelia bloom from the wand tip.
The sparks don’t peter out as expected but zoom up and down the house tables. Everyone seated beneath gasps and giggles as they bounce around painting the sparkling image of a high-class masquerade ball over their heads.
“Fuck,” Harry repeats emphatically. He wonders if his brain capacity has somehow shrunk with this pseudo-hangover.
“Hold!” someone hollers. In front of Harry are at least a dozen wizards on brooms, all pouring magic into a shimmering shield stretched over the stands. Another dozen hover overhead.
They hide the goods in the boys’ dormitory, showing off the stock to a surprised and impressed Neville. It’s unfortunate that they have to sit through a whole double lesson for DADA, vibrating out of their skins as they are, but Moody appears to overlook the sudden star-spangled-ness of his students and their unusual enthusiasm. Dinner is equally as torturous a wait, and it’s a miracle the teachers haven’t already put a stop to the obvious festivities being whispered about everywhere they look. Harry overhears a couple of Ravenclaws energetically discussing his approach to the first task. He blushes and ducks his head as he passes and their whispers ramp up in urgency.
“Hmm. I hope he’ll stay that way. I daren’t tell mum about the task, she’s already having kittens as it is…
Krum strides in last of all, all the way down the rows of students. He stops and kneels front and centre, his head bowed to the head table. Once the remaining students have followed his lead, a second peal of applause rolls through the hall.
think is dying first?” to raise their eyebrows at her. Harry had become used to their cajoling in the common rooms and corridors, laughing it off with a wave of his hand, but today it’s a little on-the-nose.
An almighty screeching fills the air, piercing enough that Harry almost drops the egg in shock. Everyone around him is yelling and covering their ears, faces contorted with pain, so he scrambles to close it and holds it an arm’s length away from him.
Harry catches a glimpse of another figure stalking across the grounds as he passes a large window. He doesn’t know who, but he can take a pretty good guess. By Thursday the only champion who won’t know about the task will be Cedric, and hell if Harry’s going to let that happen.
“Right, well, I’m going back to the dungeons,” Malfoy announces. Harry immediately leans over to pick the unfinished food from his plate. “There’s much too much red and gold and camaraderie over here.”
“Thank you all, it has been a pleasure,” Dumbledore says. “You are now free to go back to your lessons, or really straight down to common rooms or dinner, as they will be ending momentarily.”
Harry would be hard pushed to miss the lingering glance she throws over her shoulder at them, kind but also sad—no, it’s
Harry watches her unclip her bag and retrieve a handful of candles, lighting and floating them into the air with her wand.
Harry realises that there is, actually, a very odd and eerie noise drifting towards them. Hermione gasps quietly in recognition, and a rumbling starts up through the ground. Everyone returns to looking around eagerly as they had been before when—
A roaring round of applause shakes the walls. The students smile and turn to take their seats. Harry’s eyes follow those making their way over to the Slytherins, somehow surprised when the probable-veela sits herself right between Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson.
Malfoy turns his frown on him, stepping forward and trying (but failing) to look down his nose at him. Ron is just too tall, and Harry catches himself trying not to laugh.
With a large swallow Ron turns out the insides of his cuffs. He picks up his wand and slices off the lace, which makes him look a fair sight better already, but there wasn’t really much to go on in the first place. Charlie rattles in her cage on Ron’s nightstand, climbing the bars and performing impressive acrobatics for a nonexistent audience.
And Charms they do indeed have. Flitwick squeaks and congratulates Harry for his first successful attempt in class. Harry isn’t so sure, seeing as he almost got a shower when the inkwell collided with his head. He grins and thanks him anyway.
—and an appraising sort of look. “All right, then.” She returns easily to Alicia, smiling this time.
“Ah, thanks,” Harry says, folding the parchment into an envelope. They make it to the owlery and back before Hermione and Fred have even noticed them gone.
Harry returns to the tent to find Cedric gone. He sits next to Fleur on one of the ominous medical cots and waits.
She laughs and they disappear off towards the stage again. Harry sort of loses track a bit after that. He dances with Ginny and Dean and Seamus and Fay, even, and when George falls over him and they end up on the floor everyone around them is howling with laughter, but he and George most of all. Harry spies Fred sneaking Hermione out of Krum’s hands at one point and Ron dancing a very uncomfortable looking thing with Parkinson and Susan Bones. Neville and Draco’s date (whose name he
With the golden plates eventually scraped clean, Dumbledore takes to his feet again, coming to stand at his lectern. The hall buzzes with excitement and quiet chattering.
“Ron Weasley,” says Ron, sort of, because he’s halfway through his mouthful of pie and also gazing up at her in shock.
“Dress robes shall be worn,” she continues, “and the ball will start at eight o’clock, Christmas day, until midnight, in the Great Hall. Now, this may be a good chance to let our hair down, but the standards of behaviour expected of you will not be relaxed! I will be most seriously displeased
“Oh,” Harry says stupidly. He hears someone, possibly Hermione, shriek with laughter somewhere in the distance.
That was a lie. Harry is fairly certain that he would never expect such words from his friend’s mouth in either of their lifetimes.
Harry looks up at Malfoy in irritation. He stands smirking over them with the veela girl from before on his arm. She snorts indelicately, and he looks about to preen.
“Right,” Draco sighs. “I’m off. Couldn’t bear to think what would happen if I hung around here too long. See you around.”
Snape is seething by now, and Harry is pleased as anything to go. He snatches his bag back off the floor and sends a grimace over his shoulder to Ron’s pitiful pleading expression.
He walks down to breakfast with Ron on the Saturday morning to be greeted with more than the usual stares and whispers. Out of the throng of Hufflepuffs, Cedric stands up and waves the newspaper in his hand at them, grinning broadly.
Draco watches him quietly before slowly raising a hand to meet his. “But I’m not announcing it to the whole school.”
Harry rises to his feet only to find that they’ve tried to do a runner on him. He picks himself up off the ground, shaking horribly, and steps into the tunnel. The canon goes a fourth time, and he walks towards the pale, watery light.
“My cloak,” Harry grins, feeling emboldened by adrenaline. “Do you have anything to disguise yourself with?”
“He must be entering,” Harry says. They begin to shove their way past the crowd, and he clutches the crate close to him.
Draco sweeps out his arm, and indeed he may be right. All around them are soft golden faerie lights and thriving rose bushes trimmed around arching pergolas that would have Aunt Petunia green with envy. Snow settles thick on the ground and yet their shoes remain warm and dry, and the same must be said for farther out into the wilderness, as he is fairly certain that he can see Fleur with one of her Beauxbatons friends with their hands all over each other around the back of that shrub. A quick glance over his shoulder confirms that a number of couples haven’t even made it as far as the garden, settling instead for getting handsy on the steps and walkways around the courtyard.
The Gryffindor common room is in the middle of preparing for the anticipated battle—or rather, party. The crates from the dorm have been brought down and stacked against one wall, revered and honoured and added to by their housemates. A group of girls, Dean and George are doing makeup and hair in one corner, every so often pouncing on unsuspecting friends and dragging them in. Harry and Ron scamper upstairs to change and rejoin the preparations, and are accosted by Ginny almost instantly.
Harry thinks, just as something smacks into his side and his fingers close around the heavensent handle of his broomstick.
The Entrance Hall glows with the low-burning sconces. In the shadows of a far corner he spots Malfoy, fiddling with his shirt cuffs and pratting about with a few strands of his hair. Gone is the uniform, just like Harry, and he wears a thick black cloak with a tall collar clasped at his throat. He looks a bit like a gentler, more regal Snape.
“The moment has finally come!” he announces. “A short explanation, before I bring in the casket, and the Triwizard Tournament can begin!”
small, Ludo,” she says in a high, honeyed voice. Her eyes haven’t left Harry since he’d entered, her gaze scrutinising and considering and leaving him feeling stripped bare.
“Still, a pretty good idea,” says a quiet voice from behind them. “Any idea where Granger is? I’m here to deliver the kneazles.”
Fred and George conveniently reappear when most of Gryffindor, the champions, and their friends are all stumbling out into the snow. Shrieks of laughter echo off the stonework and out onto the fields of icy white, rising in pitch and volume as the first brave souls scoop up handfuls of the stuff and lob them at everyone else. Hermione, wisely, climbs a nearby tree in an attempt at escape, though several snowballs stray close by. Ron spots Draco standing below her dangling feet and winks at Harry, sneaking off quietly on his own. Seconds later there’s a scream and a shriek of laughter, and Hermione almost falls off her branch. Draco swats at Ron, who is positively howling, and has drawn his shoulders right to his ears where a large clump of snow has been shoved down the back of his cloak.
Grateful for the first thing today that has gone right, Harry sighs with relief. Before anyone can really let their guard down, however, the man with the camera jumps out from the side of the room.
“Come on,” she says, finally quirking a smile. “Let’s go and find someone. I’ll hijack my sister if needs be.”
They run over to the owlery during the break, where Ron has to snatch Pigwidgeon out of the air to get him to stay still enough for Harry to attach his letter. He throws the poor owl from the window and he plummets, struggling to get the weight of Harry’s rambling letter up out of gravity’s reach. He manages, eventually, while all three of them lean from the sill with slightly guilty expressions.
“Come now, it’s all right. There’s no need to be afraid of getting into trouble. We all know you shouldn’t have entered, but our readers do love a rebel.” She winks. Harry tries not to wince.
McGonagall appears beside him. “Mr Potter,” she says. “The Champions will be meeting in a tent on the other side of the stadium. I advise that you make your way there after your friends are done wishing you luck.” Her expression is pinched and her jaw is tenser than he’s ever seen it. He thinks he knows how she feels.
With startling timing, a choir of beautiful voices fills the hall. Students in blue satin robes appear at the doors and proceed serenely into the hall, leaving a corridor between two single-file lines. Dancers and gymnasts promptly spin and swirl into the gap, flowing like water in the enthusiastic chorus. The dancers are led by an incredibly pretty witch with a flickering sheet of platinum hair who puts Harry instantly in mind of the veela from the World Cup. Maybe she is in some way related, with the gentle way she now glows, attracting the attention of mostly everyone, but most of all the very rudely-leering boys. Harry imagines that, in such a position, she has taken up a role of leadership much the same as Krum. Hogwarts doesn’t have such a figure, he thinks. That is unless you count Gryffindor’s Weasley twins, Hufflepuff’s Cedric Diggory, or even Slytherin’s Draco Malfoy; which is to say, they haven’t
“Is it a dragon?” a first-year shrieks, before promptly falling into hysteria. A large shape does indeed loom over the horizon, dipping and weaving and growing ever larger as it nears.
“Oh yes, just making sure they’re all functional and won’t cause you any problems. They’re your most important tool, of course!”
Harry’s heart drops. “Oh, great… More publicity. It’s not like they don’t run enough articles on me anyway.”
Just then, a group of Slytherins come up the stairs from their common room. Draco is in the lead, with black velvet robes that Harry thinks make him look like a vicar. Even so, a very attractive one. On his arm is the blonde girl Harry had seen with Neville at the inter-school party. She has hair as pale as Draco’s and has swapped her orange and green dress for lovely, glittery blue robes. Pansy Parkinson is wearing something floaty and green (no surprises), and is quickly approached by one of their Beauxbatons friends, who’s wearing a hijab in the same green and a set of lovely silver robes. Crabbe and Goyle look like a couple of glowering, mossy boulders, but Nott and Zabini are chatting amicably as they stroll through the throng. Zabini, in his grey velvet, comes to a stop in front of Harry, Ron and Parvati.
“Cheers Malfoy, I’ll take them,” Harry says, still grinning. Malfoy rolls his eyes. He drops a cloth on Harry’s head.
“Well, your date is taken care of,” Draco hums, inclining his head to something over Harry’s shoulder. Harry realises a beat too late that he should be looking over there and not at Draco’s fingers tapping the rim of his empty flute, and when he does he catches sight of Parvati safely ensconced in a close dance with Lavender.
Ron is unwrapping his annual jumper from his mother, this year paired with some wonderfully violet socks. “What is it with the socks,” he mutters, and then dives excitedly to retrieve his gift from Harry.
Draco Malfoy saunters towards him, moments before his accident with Buckbeak. Harry almost bolts upright in shock, but once again pauses, letting his thoughts play through. Malfoy gives him a look, all the way down and up again, and a taunting raise of his eyebrows. Harry shivers. He discovers a sudden urge to know what Malfoy had been thinking. He hadn’t even noticed at the time, so basted with his own anger as he was.
Harry watches him go, hand raised weakly to wave him out. His friends farther down the table are snickering loudly.
It’s dark when Harry wakes up, and at first he isn’t certain why he has. It’s a few seconds later when he sees the huge glinting eyes leering at him from a few inches away, and he yells out.
“Why do you think they’re uneducated?” Fred asks suddenly. She starts, gazing at him with wide eyes. “Did you know that house-elves are incredibly intelligent?” She shakes her head. “Okay, did you know that the way they use magic is completely different to wizards and witches?” She nods. “Right, well, maybe we should go and have a chat with them, eh?”
“Angelina,” Fred says, not embarrassed in the slightest. Harry flicks his eyes to Hermione, who is most certainly not reading any of the page she’s on.
“Woah,” he murmurs, gazing up at the decorations that have appeared overnight. The candles have been pushed towards the enchanted ceiling, and over each house table hangs a large silk banner: Gryffindor’s red with a golden lion, Hufflepuff’s yellow with a black badger, Ravenclaw’s blue with a golden eagle, and Slytherin’s green with a silver snake. The animals move, proud and graceful, as an imaginary draught ripples across them. Over the fifth table hangs the Hogwarts Crest, all four house insignia slotted together around a large golden H, moving freely from house to house.
Ron has lots of siblings—he’s not the oldest, nor the youngest, nor the one with dragons, nor the Ministry employee, nor a troublemaker. To everyone other than us, he’s just Ron. He doesn’t get much attention at all, and you’re
“Merlin’s sake, sit down!” George demands, grabbing his wrist and yanking. Warrington stumbles and does as he’s told, eyeing George warily. George doesn’t seem to care, other than for the bright red of his ears, and is still throwing his daring and quite mad ideas into the pool.
Harry hadn’t been expecting a warm welcome, exactly, but the cold shoulder the Hufflepuffs give the whole of Gryffindor house is a bit of a kick to the stomach. He’s very glad that he doesn’t have Herbology with them until Monday, but equally unsettled at the prospect of dealing with… Well, anyone who isn’t Ron or Hermione. Or Fleur, he supposes. Fleur is nice.
These must be the Weird Sisters; they arrive to what McGonagall would pronounce terribly uncouth whooping applause, are all very hairy, dressed in black, and have chosen very particular, artistic places in which to tear their robes.
“That’s a lovely idea, Harry,” Hermione says, appearing in a whirl at their shoulder. Her hair bounces on her shoulders and glints in the lamplight, otherwise contained in a bun at the back of her head. She’s wearing a sleeveless turtlenecked jumper, forest green and sort of ribbed, over unexpected cuffed jeans and with a large shirt tied around her waist. Harry doesn’t think he’s seen her wear any of it before, but is beginning to question his observational skills anyway.
Harry has spent every single one of those days running around the castle trying not to die of embarrassment or deck anyone who makes noises about Rita Skeeter’s comments on Hermione. He’s had to hold Ron back once, and Neville has had to tackle them both on multiple occasions.
But the fever that Ron had suddenly been afflicted with seems to be raging through the entire school. Lee is leaping up and down and pawing at Fred’s shoulder, and they pass a group of girls squabbling over the only writing implement they seem to have to hand: a bright red lipstick.
She giggles and rolls her eyes, but downs the rest of her drink and takes his hand. “I know you’re having trouble, but all you need to do is relax,” she says, and leads him over to where Lavender and Seamus are having some sort of shouted conversation. Lavender notices Parvati and runs over to drag her in, so Harry goes to hover with Dean and Ginny dancing enthusiastically a couple of feet away.
“Bloody hell, are you all right?” Ron asks. He thumps his back for him. “You’re not even there yet, don’t hurt yourself already.”
“Right,” says Bagman. He’s wearing his old Wasps robes again. “Well, time to fill you all in! I’ll offer each of you this bag—” he holds up a small purple pouch “—and you will pick a small model of the thing you are about to face! They have, err, different varieties, you see. It will also decide the order you go in.”
On the final note, Davies and Pucey slash their wands as one, and the whole visage vanishes in an explosion of imaginary water.
ink themselves beneath it. He does as instructed and the star sticks to his finger. Beneath it is a green one of identical shape.
Lavender giggles shrilly from somewhere near the middle of the class. Harry leans over to see Parvati shove her in the shoulder, face working to keep itself straight also. They both glance over at Harry, which McGonagall ignores. Typical.
The python slithers out of a corner, followed by the anaconda, hiding in a pot. The boa drops down from a roof support and Cedric shrieks.
“It was fun,” Dean says. He winks at Ginny. “Seamus got chatted up by a drunk hag at the Broomsticks.”
Hermione fidgets behind Malfoy’s shoulders. Harry is beginning to wish he could just sink into the floor. Or the shelves. He isn’t picky.
Cho releases the snitch and the quaffle goes sailing into the air. Harry speeds upwards, chasing glints of gold, but glances sideways for only a second and loses it. Malfoy smirks and tilts his head.
Harry tries to think of someone to ask, preferably someone who won’t hex him, and somehow comes up a bit short. Nearby the Gryffindor girls are sitting together chatting, and it pokes at the memory of his silent promise to Ginny.
“The chains snapped,” Harry mutters, scrunching his nose and looking away. Pomfrey declares him fit with a scathing glare and instructions to stay put. She returns to Cedric’s back.
“Finally shown up, have you?” Malfoy huffs. Zabini is picking at his nails and dangling a niffler cage from his wrist.
Harry watches the oversized snakes explore the tent. “I summoned it. She wouldn’t let me get close though, so I asked some friends to help while I ran distraction. She ended up chasing me around the castle.”
“Nothing of the sort,” Angelina replies lightly. She smiles and takes his arm, and he winks to Harry, Ron and Parvati as they make their glamorous exit.
Harry looks to the goblet in his hand and realises that yes, he has been trying to drink from an empty cup for several minutes. He sighs and puts it down, ears burning.
He practices for another few minutes, picking up a shaky volley between himself and Ron with a spare quill.
Blaise laughs, and the sound somehow reverberates through all of them despite the surrounding clamour. “I’m sure we can fix that. Now, would you care to accompany me this evening?”
A slight singing noise slants towards him and Harry looks up in glee. His broom swoops down, and he jumps from the plateau.
“Well done, Harry!” Angelina and Alicia scream, dragging him through much like the night of the Goblet’s choice.
“Because I know you apologised to Hermione last month,” Harry breathes. “I know you apologised to her and I know we’re all… Less volatile this year. I’ve had some thoughts.”
Eventually the pair return grinning ear to ear, with shrunken crates of butterbeer (and one dubiously obtained crate of Ogden’s) from Rosmerta and pockets full of Honeydukes’ finest.
The snakes have curled behind the rock from earlier. They extend their necks at the sight of him and unfurl. Harry scrambles forward and picks up the gleaming egg, hoisting it into the air.
Hermione turns her best sorrowful gaze on him. “You really have helped us this evening, Malfoy, are you sure you can’t come again tomorrow? We would all feel much better if you were there, after all.”
“Are you going to be a git about this?” Harry hisses. “I’ll worry about that when I don’t have to worry about you getting us into trouble!”
