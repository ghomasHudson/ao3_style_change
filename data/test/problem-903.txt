Draco was blinking up at me in what I could only call amazement, and I wanted to shy away from it.
"This is who you're fucking now?" He directed his question back at me. I rolled my eyes.
dreams now are just an echo, but that bastard really got in my head. Made me think we shared similarities, and that everyone only does what's best for themselves, and that I should, too. I mean, I was
"It's… Better than the first, I'll say." Taking another swig, I fought against the contortions my face threatened at the taste. The mouthful slid uneasily down my throat as he followed suit, much more casually than I. A cough forced its way out of my mouth as I continued. "Sorry, I just pictured…"
I wasn't the only one to send my attention backwards to see who was so late, but it was my eyes that Draco's met. I would've instinctively drawn my eyes away, but the blush that stole into his cheeks kept my eyes captivated.
"What does it look like I'm doing?"
he barely uttered, a pleased pink creeping into his cheeks. I pressed my lips together and tore my gaze from his face back to my work.
"However, a word of caution is necessary at this moment of transition. Many, if not most of us have lost, in the past year, that which we will never regain. That can never be undone. It is now up to every individual to decide how we will allow that to change us. I urge you all to pursue the best possible outcomes. It is all too easy to allow the war to live on in our hearts, should we yield to hatred. Forgiveness is no petty trifle to give, but therein lies healing. And healing, dear students, is a goal I think we can all prioritize."
'I think Hermione might be a
"What the fuck? Who the hell are you and what have you done with Malfoy?" Some color was returning to Finnegan's face as he looked me up and down. I attempted a sheepish grin, and his shock replaced his confusion again. "I never knew your face could do that."
"It'll certainly be a shock to everyone… Might upset a few… But honestly, what can they do? You're still Harry Potter even if you're dating a guy."
Seemingly reluctantly, he pulled away from me and started redressing. After a moment’s hesitation, I followed suit. Pulling my trousers up incited the same hiss as before, and I scowled at him.

Her smug expression softened into something like compassion.
"Whoa, whoa, slow down. You
"Hey. Sorry, I didn't want you to have to wait on me."
"Getting a little ahead of ourselves, aren't we?" She leaned around the corner into the Great Hall, and gestured for me to do the same.
‘Harry’ he began his reply, casting a sharp glance up at me. ‘You ACCIDENTALLY Legillimens me in my sleep. You should give yourself more credit’
"Just don't do it again, prick."
Luna's advice of "cutting myself a break" rang in my ears.
"Everyone on the staff wants
"Malfoy."
He shrugged and ran a hand through his hair.
I growled internally at the hypocrisy of not wanting to be labelled a hero and yet occasionally pulling the hero card. Sure, I still had the same common sense of any 18-year-old, but I killed Voldemort for chrissake! That didn't count for nothing.
I glanced up at his face, and the blatant arousal there solidified my resolution.
My wide, disbelieving eyes turned to see him blushing down at his hands as his fingers toyed with his bandages.
His hastily tacked-on clarification drew laughter from my lips.
and then scrawled in the margin, ‘
His shitty handwriting was WAY worse when he was writing so quickly. I struggled to make out what he'd penned before it disappeared.
He gasped again as his flavor spread across my tongue.
The glare he shot me was half-hearted, and I smiled. He was so damn

‘Tonight then?’
Harry, however, only grinned and leaned forward to plant a kiss square on my lips. I lingered as he sat back, and my reopening eyes perceived the
"J… Just don't do anything I wouldn't do!" I felt confusion twist my brow, when she grasped my wrist. "Don't do anything YOU wouldn't do, okay?" She clarified.
'Sorry for my first impression on you.'
Harry was idly pulling grass from the ground, a knot between his eyebrows. He seemed… Relaxed. Albeit a bit stressed and tired, but he wasn't tense in my presence like I thought he'd be. His glasses slid down his nose and he pushed them back up before looking up at me, and I immediately looked away.
As class began, Sprout announced we’d all have five minutes each to give our presentations, so we’d have enough time to get through them all, and the class breathed a sigh of relief. My irritation only grew, though, when I thought about all the time and effort we’d wasted.
His hand stilled as he assessed my reaction.
I couldn't admit it, but it stung to know the brunette was only being nice to me on someone else's behalf. But here he still was, even after admitting it, talking to me like mates. I wanted to make Potter spit blood, and tell him I didn't need hand-outs, but… Some part of me wanted to believe he actually wanted to be there. I pulled my legs into myself and glanced up at him.
I whipped back around to Voldemort, my wand in my hand suddenly.
likes
look all at the same time. His face turned bright red and he ducked his head. I had a sudden urge to laugh, but I quashed it.
Harry was still patiently awaiting my response, but I didn't miss the surprise on his face when my response was suddenly standing, without ever touching my food.
"I'm… S-sorry, I… Know it's stupid…"
I couldn't conceal the grin on my face. It took all I had to stop my legs from bouncing gleefully under my desk. He'd just made my day.
"Yeah… I guess." I pushed my arms into my shirt and started doing up the buttons. "He's… Still the same, but… Somehow, completely different."
crossed my lips as we held each other. We embraced a moment more before I pressed a chaste kiss to the biggest scar on his chest.
The general consensus of the rest of the group amounted to uneasy affirmation, but that was enough for me.
“That’s good. I’m sorry they were mean to you. That’s not what Hogwarts is usually like.”
"Do what you want."
"You can't trust him!" One of them called after me.
“Fair point,” I conceded. “What about you, Ron? Care to be a Keeper again?”
We both arrived early to Potions. This time, we chose side-by-side seats near the back of the class.
I swiveled to see him picking at his food, alone at the very end of the Slytherin table, the very image of piteous. He happened to look up when I realized I'd made
I shrugged.
She whispered furiously at me.
“Were you…?” I felt an intrigued expression spread across my face as I shifted to face him more directly. “Worried you’d come between my friends and I?”
"I… Really can't understand what you see in me, but… For what it's worth, you've… Completely destroyed my expectations for this year."
Irritation replaced my discomfort, and I grimly thought
"Well, then I suppose you're doing the walk of shame back to your dorm, as per tradition."
He glanced down at me.
When we finally reached the sparsely populated Great Hall, we hesitated.
?" He gave a shaky laugh as a tear streaked down his cheek. "Speaking from experience, fretting about
'I see.'
"That wasn't a threat, you greasy, disgusting pile of shit." Harry stepped up dangerously close to my father. "It was a
I yawned and started undressing for the night, still mulling over McGonagall's request.
We weren't to Hogwarts yet, but we'd pulled into a station I didn't recognize. Surely this was the turning point I'd expected from the beginning. Harry came to sit beside me, gripping my hand silently. A multitude of footsteps was growing louder until finally, our compartment door was thrown open.
"Well… Still! That doesn't make up for the fact that he's a
well," I agreed before leaning in to kiss him.
"So there was this time in first year, when I was out wandering the castle in my Invisibility Cloak, and I stumbled upon the Mirror of Erised. You know what that is?" Draco nodded, listening intently. I swallowed. "Well… When I walked up to it, I saw… My mum and dad, standing behind me. Smiling at me." I was briefly lost in the memory before I continued. "And then… When V- he came back, we dueled and our spells… Connected? I still don't really understand, but Dumbledore called it priori incantatem? I saw all the people he'd killed, including my parents. The final time was in the Forbidden Forest when I was walking to my death. Dumbledore'd left me the Resurrection Stone, and I finally used it. I talked to my parents, to Sirius, to Lupin... "
Our eyes met as the realization clicked for us both.
I couldn't think of anything intelligent to say as I watched him stand and leave.
"Uh… Yeah?"
"Sorry… I'm going to bed early tonight."
The question of Potter's ulterior motives drove Draco to his next class. He intended to quietly observe if he was giving anyone else the same kind of attention, but halfway to the Astronomy tower, he realized where he was going and halted.
Draco was looking at me like I'd started speaking Parseltongue, and I rolled my eyes again.
"I knew it!" Her glee dissipated quickly. "But...?"
"You're amazing." My already flushed cheeks warmed further.
Harry was suddenly on his feet.
"You've…?"
"Booze? If anyone will sell me any… Might visit the magical artifacts shop, see if they have anything new."
My shitty handwriting faded several long moments before Draco finally took the paper back to reply.
"Well, I mean... If we start openly dating... There's a high probability people will think I'm doing so against my will, and I want to protect him from any harassment, but I don't want to paint him in such a way that he seems powerless to defend himself-"
My shower passed in a blur as I mentally braced myself for all the teasing I'd just bought myself, but my grimace couldn't affix itself to my face. I was too lost in thought about all that had happened overnight. Briefly, in the mirror after my shower, I lifted my cloaking spell to steal another glance at the blossoming red on the side of my neck.
I’d garnered a fair bit of attention from the rest of the room, but instead of replying, Draco seized my face and crushed my lips to his.
"Still, can't believe Sinistra wanted us all to stay up this late just for that."
"Fffffuck," slid from my tongue, unbidden. His warmth was so
"Told ya," came Harry's retort. I shot him a look of betrayal.
"It'll be fine so long as I don't… Fuck with it anymore." I frowned down at the scabs forming over my damned Dark Mark. When he lowered his lips to gently kiss my arm, though, my heart lodged itself in my throat.
"So our projects are due this Friday, right?"
"I-I guess so…"
you come back? I mean, if you died…?"
was a question I’d been meaning to ask, but I was almost certain his answer still wouldn’t convince me. A deliberating frown indented between his eyebrows as I slid the page back onto his desk. He took quite a while to formulate his response.
My anxiety eased slightly as I returned his smile.
But when I turned to see why he'd stopped, my heart lodged itself in my throat. He was frowning down at our clasped hands.
"I can't believe we wasted all those years
he looked, mixing us drinks, but he was pouring them back into the glasses we'd previously used before I could comment.
‘You’re still terrified when you stop dissociating, though. And courage doesn’t necessarily mean you’re not afraid.’
"Er… So, I…"
I… I have no words." Hermione praised me with a wide grin.
I happened to glance toward the lake and what should I spot but a black figure slumped against a tree, with shining blond hair.

"Sorry. Just... Lost in thought, again." I attempted a weak chuckle, but Draco's curiosity turned to concern.
Again, where I searched for anger to draw up around myself, I found none. Only gratitude for McGonagall (and Harry) presented itself. Frustration wrinkled my brow as the rest of the class started filtering into the room. I sat upright and tried to nonchalantly pull out my textbook and parchment.
"Fair point."
This earned a chuckle from him, and I grinned.
Once the question crossed my mind, though, I immediately remembered why it
growl that sounded in his throat. He pressed my knees nearly to my shoulders as he pounded into me, and I saw white. Just when I thought it couldn't get any better, his right hand released my knee to grip my twitching erection. His attentions brought me to the precipice, and my own voice nearly deafened my ears.
Tossing my robes in her general direction (and carefully avoiding eye contact) I went to my dresser to withdraw a clean pair of pants. When I withdrew back into my bathroom to change into them, she must've insinuated the rest of my sentence because, when I reemerged in only my briefs, she was grinning broadly. With another roll of my eyes and a sigh, I snatched my robes from her tightly gripped fingers and started dressing. We'd changed around each other enough during our months hunting Horcruxes, this was nothing for us.
“Right.
"That's dark," but neither of us stopped laughing for a few moments. "Not nearly as dark as my dreams usually are, though… This is very strange for me. Is it really so tame just because

The rest of breakfast passed in silence as Seamus attempted to finish his meal (he eventually gave up), Harry aggressively consumed an apple and a piece of toast, Hermione seemed to struggle to contain her laughter, Ron studiously shoveled his normal portions into his face, and Neville fought to keep a grin off his face. It was oddly warm, albeit a bit awkward. I found it didn’t bother me one bit.
He laughed again.
The once-reddish welt on his skin was now an enticing purple, and I couldn't resist lowering my teeth to it again, eliciting a startled whimper from Harry. His fumbling fingers froze undoing my buttons, so I took over for him as I gently suckled on his neck. With practiced efficiency, I shed my shirt and pressed our bare chests together. A tremble passed through Harry's body against mine as his hands slid around to my back.
Harry seemed to consider this for a moment before replying.
"Forget coming back to school, can you
"Look, the least you could do is
"I… Uh… Well, you see… I guess…" Now it was
didn't want to be alone with the two of them. Who knew how far they'd be willing to go on their "Rehabilitate Draco" train?
Catching my breath to answer him verbally seemed futile, so I silently swallowed and nodded. His eyes never left mine, but I couldn't bring myself to watch him expose me, so my head fell back onto the bed as my pajama pants and boxers were pulled down to my knees. My cheeks burned even hotter, and I lifted my hands to cover my face.
His elbow served itself into my arm, and I laughed.
"What exactly have you two even been talking about? Can't imagine he has much to say to you, except apologize." Neville offered, to which Seamus snorted.
"By the way, I've been wanting to do this all day," he said as he closed the gap between us, tilted my face up, and kissed me. My lips smiled against his, eagerly reciprocating.
Feeling quite a bit more confident, I decided to flip Draco onto his back and straddle him. The surprise on his face was obvious, but it wasn't the expression I wanted. Emulating what he'd done, I lowered myself to kiss him again before moving my lips to his cheek, his jaw, his neck.
I smacked my lips, and chose to take another swig from my water, rousing more laughter from Draco's lips. My cheeks flushed as I registered just how much fun we were having.
Draco's eyes raked down my naked body, and I could've blushed into my fingers. Before he said anything else, though, he grabbed his wand from beside my head and aimed it at himself. He uttered a spell I couldn't hear, and then aimed it at me. I hadn't even a moment to wonder what he was about to cast on me when his lips moved again, and within me, I felt a strange, shifting sensation. He tossed his wand to the floor then, and lowered himself down to kiss me.
‘Date me long enough, you’ll go grey prematurely’
With a roll of his eyes, the blond finally followed me to the bathroom as I set the shower water running. We were already naked, so there was no stripping to do, but we did stand heartily blushing as we waited for the water to warm.

‘Blimey, even your transparency is rubbing off on me’
"How you even had the nerve to come back is beyond me. Are you thick?"
?" A girl in my year who I'd never bothered to learn the name of stood in my way with a few other girls behind her. My eyebrows raised incredulously.
I glanced up at him, but he was pulling out his own personal effects.
"What? I told them you apologized, because you did. Nobody believed me."
"Suppose that makes sense. We should probably stay away from the more dangerous ones, though."
She offered me a small smile, but in her eyes, I could've sworn I saw a mischievous glint. My eyes narrowed just a fraction in response.

'Sentimental value?'
Shock slacked my jaw.
"Well, er… B-better get some sleep, eh?"
With fierce determination, I quietly observed his face as I allowed my hand to slide all the way down to his bulge. He drew in a shaky breath as his eyes widened slightly, and I pulled my lower lip between my teeth.
"You… Want me to… Be
My grin fell from my face.
Draco calmly took his seat, but even without looking, I could tell something happened. Maybe several things? The energy I was picking up from him was all over the place.
As his message faded before me, my guilt solidified.
He didn't look at me as he shoved his parchments and textbook into his bag.
He paused his pacing and realization dawned on his face.
We both turned toward the Room of Requirement, only to realize we'd be walking together if we both went now. I laughed awkwardly.
"Draco!" He came to kneel before me, prying my right hand from my left wrist to pull up my sleeve. "Just breathe, this isn't real, he can't hurt us."
I'm inclined to say you have good taste, so I'll take your word for it."
"What can I do for you, sir?" I asked politely.
Harry spoke into my mind.
I could barely hear myself, but somehow he perceived my question because a wide grin stretched across his face.
The competition was indeed as plentiful as the Gryffindor stands were empty. Only a handful of tiny first-years occupied the top row. It seemed like Granger and Weasley were about the only ones not dying for a chance to make the team.
“Is it going to be weird or will you be able to act like a normal person?”
A short laugh escaped Draco. “That wasn’t friendly, that was reserved.”
He sighed and – looking like it pained him greatly – opened his bag to rummage through it. There was a second during which he froze, apparently thinking, and then he pulled out his Falcons robes and handed them to him.
Draco swallowed heavily. His mouth was dried-out, and his voice was barely more than a whisper. “I didn’t take you for the person to ask permission first.”
that the artery couldn’t start leaking. Healing it shouldn’t be too complicated – some Blood-Replenishing Potion and a few quick spells should do the trick.
“I haven’t come back, Kreacher,” Potter said bluntly. “I just took a wrong exit. I’m not staying here, so you can go back to the school.”
“He never celebrates Halloween with us,” said Callum, who wasn’t even in costume, wearing a leather jacket instead. And they had told
Potter’s seat came swinging by again just then, wobbling dangerously. And also quite emptily.
Harry poked him in the side. “I said not yet.”
He did not really think that was what was going on, but now that he had said it, he caught himself wondering who would win in a scuffle. Somehow, he doubted it would be him. Draco was taller, sure, but Potter was definitely in better shape. He did nothing but train every day and probably ate a lot of vegetables. Draco only ever worked way too many hours, but never
A sigh before Harry pushed open the exit. “Would be brilliant though. Then I could finally sack McCarthy.”
Alright, that was accurate. Maybe Potter just didn’t like the song because such statements didn’t fit his
Careful not to shift the cloak, they got to their feet and followed a group of Ravenclaws out of the room as fast as they could.

“Really?
“Nah – The unicorns. They like to paint them with rainbow manes and tails.”
“Anything else you

“Well, you started that smear campaign against me! You even made
Harry turned to frown at her and said suspiciously, “Didn’t you read that before coming here?”
Potter nodded, concentrating on dividing the last tiny bit of cake yet again, but Draco could hear him mutter under his breath,
It felt like a scene from the movies, the ones where everything moved much slower for some reason. The only thing missing was an explosion the two of them could walk away from.
Granger had her suspicions. That didn’t mean they were on to them, right?
Draco got up at the nick of dawn. Harry was sleeping like a log, but Draco’s mind was racing.
“I really wished more students would complete an internship before starting their training at St. Mungo’s,” Draco said wistfully. “Some of them are just not cut out for Healing.”
"Can you teach me how to do that? Like… In the real world."
Draco said we still weren't even, but I think he did forgive me, because he asked me to toss him a pumpkin pasty, and I obliged.
'Yes, sir.'
My legs halted.
My heart rate stuttered and my hands started trembling, but I couldn't stop myself. My head was feeling increasingly lighter, and the adrenaline started climbing back up my spine. I was about thirty seconds from either throwing myself off the side or collapsing, when something suddenly grounded me.
“Ah, you thinking about doing Quidditch again this year?” Seamus asked as he picked up on the context of our conversation.
'Can I talk to you after class?'
"That'd be fantastic! You could apprentice at an apothecary, I'm sure you'd be brilliant at it."
"See? Just there," I pointed toward where I'd seen it, and he found it within moments.
"See anything good?"
I couldn't ignore the heat in my face, but thankfully, Draco didn't comment on it. We just kept stacking books into our arms silently.
Slipped from my lips unintentionally as my pace quickened slightly. I lowered myself to close the gap between our chests, burying my face in his neck. "
His answer didn't make me feel any better, but we were entering the Great Hall now, so I decided to drop it as we joined my friends.

Our old Potions professor's name sparked a sliver of pain in my chest, but I tried to shrug casually.
My spine straightened in shock. It was troubling to me how easily I transitioned from thinking of him as Malfoy to thinking of him as
The castle was just a dark shape against the sky, but as we looked up, our eyes adjusted and countless stars littered the cosmos.
A nervous laugh sounded in my throat before I cleared it.
For the first several minutes, we showered stoically, cleansing our bodies of the stickiness that clung to us, shampooing and conditioning our hair, sharing the water, until I was watching Draco wash his face with the soap the Room had provided.
This realization was swiftly followed with the notion that
The curiosity in Draco's expression dropped into something like shock.
'We'll be holding hands in the halls and someone asks if we're a couple and we just say no? What gave you that idea?'
He raised an amused eyebrow at me as I flushed.
I thought about what I would ask if I didn't already know so much.
'Well, I don't think so, I
"To a night well spent," Harry raised his glass, and I clinked mine against his.
"Do you clean this room every day?" It looked like a hotel room, I could hardly believe anyone lived in it. Draco sat on the edge of his bed as he watched me.
"Indeed. Erm… This might be inappropriate to say, but…" He met my eyes with such sudden sincerity that I froze. "Nobody blames you."
"Er…"
I only managed to wriggle beneath him as he flattened himself on top of me. A gasp cut off our kiss as his pelvis pressed against mine.
‘Dissociation? Courage?’
"Ah, I see where the misunderstanding is coming from. You
"I could've prevented it, though, if I'd acted sooner and more decisively."
A flash of lightning cut him off, and the Dark Mark appeared in the sky.
nutjob."
“Your friends don’t think I’m stealing you from them, do you?” I chuckled at this.
"D-did you… See… The whole thing…?"
I grimaced at my feet.
I gasped in fake outrage.
McGonagall pulled me aside as Ron, Hermione and I were leaving the Great Hall. I cast a glance at them, but aside from mild curiosity, they didn't seem to mind.
The petulant pout he gave me eased my worry slightly as he huffed.

"I see you're taking this
I dragged him along with me in silence nearly the entire way to class, but at the last moment, as the bell rang again, he stopped.
?" I petitioned hesitantly. His answering grin seemed to grip my heart.
"D-Draco…" He moaned my name, and I nearly came myself. I was careful not to be too rough with him, but my pacing was one of my skills I was most proud of. His voice rose in pitch steadily, until finally, a shriek ripped from his lips as he released down my throat.
"Are you sure you should've taken those bandages off just yet? I'll summon some if they need replacing."
"I'm gonna… I…
"Yeah, I gathered that. You're in good company, you know. Lucius is a fucking monster."
"Don't get used to it," he almost whispered.
He paused outside the door to the classroom, and we were almost late because of it, but when I turned back to see why he'd stopped, his expression stopped my heart momentarily. It was a most unreadable expression, but if I had to guess, it was a combination of confusion, mistrust, hurt, and hope. It was replaced with a scowl under my inspection, but I held the door open and he reluctantly stalked in.
"And don't come back!"
Harry’s voice was steadily rising in pitch, and I suddenly wanted to show him what he looked like, so I lifted off his neck and watched his face. His eyes were closed, but the slight shift in his expression betrayed embarrassment.
"Do I have something on my face?"
I finally returned his smile.
"Are spelled very weakly. Honestly, do you know who I am?"
I noted as my cheeks warmed.
“You barely bumped into me. What time is it?”
My grunts and moans must've been loud in his ear, but his mouth was right beside my ear, as well, and
I was awake far too late, agonizing over
He chuckled.
"Alright, alright! Shut up about it already." She pressed her smiling lips together and poked my arm repeatedly. I rolled my eyes, but couldn't fight the smile crawling back onto my face. "Nothing officially even happened."
“Mmmorning,” came his lazy reply, and he pressed his lips to the side of my neck. A flash of pain reminded me of the now-worsened welt he’d dealt my skin.
His hips angled slightly more upward, and suddenly his voice was ascending in pitch, his moans coming more frequently.
"Of course you could, but would you?"
I swallowed.
I allowed myself a chuckle at the memory of Malfoy's reaction. He'd not only looked so hilariously shocked, but also positively perplexed. If all I did was random acts of kindness for him, like holding doors and choosing him as lab partners, it would drive him insane with bewilderment.
"So… How does non-virginity feel?"
Now, it was my turn to snatch the page back urgently.
Harry had stopped with me, and was giving me a curious expression. My cheeks flamed.
"Also… I've kind of… Been, like,
"What are you doing here, Potter?" He still spat my name like a slur, and it comforted me somehow.
so relax I did. Or tried to, at least. My hands seized his neck and brought our foreheads together as I grit my teeth. The sensation was jarring, but as I allowed him into me, a spark of pleasure lit in me.
"Guess you're right. Who d'you reckon's gayer though, you or me?"
My eyes widened with shock, and I snatched the paper back.
"See? Told you it'd be alright." I nodded as he rubbed my back.
"No, not every day. Fairly consistently, though. Why, is yours as hazardous as I'm imagining?"
"Hm. Time works weird in dreams." I angled my face up to blink up at his. "Without a doubt, the best night's rest I've had in years, though."
"Shit…" Hastily, I pulled my shirt back over my head and collected my book bag. "Er… Keep the snacks, I guess. I brought way too many…"
"We've all had just about enough of conflict and enemies, I think. We're happy for you," Hermione chimed.
is wrong?"
He surprised me suddenly by reaching over and seizing my wrist. A yelp escaped me as he pulled me back down onto the bed and expertly flipped me over to straddle me.
My brow twitched.
I sat up suddenly, already assuming the worst.
"I wonder if there's something here we're meant to find?" Harry wondered aloud as he dropped my hand and headed toward the changing staircases ahead of me.

A snort sounded in my throat.
Harry shrugged as his laughter died.
"Er… Sure."
Anxiety clenched my gut.
count as no one?"
bad, right?"
His answering smile was still a touch sad, and I suddenly wanted to distract him.
Once class ended, we headed to the Great Hall together, once again hand-in-hand. The irony of my being shown kindness while Harry had been shown hatred was still reeling my mind a bit, but I'd already seen how nobody would say anything to us while we were together. That anyone would have the nerve to go against the Savior of the Wizarding World was beyond me, but teenagers were teenagers at the end of the day. At the dinner table, the following conversation ensued:
I'd never admit it to him, but the brief moments I'd been inside his mind were very telling. However, I genuinely did want him to open up to me and tell me of his own volition. Whether that would ever happen, I couldn't be sure. But I hoped.
"Oh, god…" I held his legs to me as I slowly pulled nearly out and thrust back in.
‘Still doesn’t make me braver’
I stunned myself silent as I realized some of what I'd said to Harry could also be applied to myself. A strange warmth flooded through me at the notion that understanding him was helping me understand myself.
I eyed the brunette from behind, and just as I was wondering if he could feel me looking at him, his shoulders slumped slightly. Not in a tired way, or a bored way, but in a… Sad way?
An assenting '

'That's not a bad thing, right?' I wrote back after I seized the parchment back.
honest, I wanted to keep his sweaty hand in mine forever. It felt so solid, like I'd been subconsciously reaching out for something to grab this whole time, and now that I'd found it, I was wholly unwilling to let it go. Who knows when he'd let me hold his hand again?
Somehow, his touch seemed to bring feeling back into my fingers. He said nothing as I forced a deep, DEEP breath into my lungs and tried to let it out evenly. Thankfully, my heart rate began decelerating as my trembling hand gripped his.
I saw myself nod, felt my hair brush against Harry’s cheek.
I was writing Draco a note before I even had time to consider what I was asking.
"Still, I'd rather have to deal with
"Anything you wanna talk about?"
him." I laughed for a while, and eventually, Draco joined.
If I was right, her conniving was more characteristic of a Slytherin, but I couldn't stay mad at her.
too invested in our relationship.'
I suddenly sat upright. This brought Slughorn's attention to me, and obviously, he called on me for the next question.
McGonagall took my hands in hers and squeezed, surprising me again.
Eventually, I crawled into bed when my anxiety turned to shame.
"What?"
The memory of his skin against mine had my hands eagerly lifting his shirt up over his head, just as his legs came into contact with the bed. We'd broken away for a moment as it came up over his head, but I pulled back when he came to reconnect. His adorable pout changed to curiosity as I withdrew my wand from my pocket, connected it to the skin of his neck where I knew my love bite was, and uttered, '
"No… It was… Actually really nice… Having you there…"
"Glad to see you've decided to come to classes."
"I'll… I'll talk to 'em… I guess…"
"Shh!" I shushed her hastily and sighed. "It's…
echoed in my head.
"Draco…" I'd meant to sound more wary, but my voice came out breathy. One of his arms unwrapped from around my waist and fingers wrapped around my reawakening member. A gasp hissed into my mouth as I braced myself against the window with one hand. "I…" My sentence was lost as his hand started stroking and he pressed me tighter against him.
"You know I can't be killed, right? He literally tried twice. And I don't even have any Horcruxes!" With a grimace, Harry laid his hand over mine and ripped the blade out of him with great effort. Once it clattered to the floor, his other hand came up to cradle the side of my face.
“Don’t be.”
He unconsciously started scratching at his arm again as his anxiety took over. Yes, this was quite a suitable punishment.
"Er… You weren't in class."
"You'd think, since I've had so much practice. Honestly, though, I think I'll take a few years off after graduation. Hunting evil wizards gets kinda tiresome."
"I know how heroic my actions seem from the outside, but it took
“He’s already proven himself a million times over! How many wins has he brought Gryffindor already?”
Whatever had passed between Harry and McGonagall had clearly set him off, but I was the last person to pry into other peoples' emotions, so I simply followed him in silence.
Reluctantly, I was keenly aware of Malfoy all throughout Potions. He seemed like he was having trouble staying awake, but there was a moment when it seemed like something startled him. I saw him tense from behind, but couldn't see anything that might've set him off. Not that I cared, anyway. I was more trying to get a read for how he would behave from now on.
My head drooped as pleasure started to pool at the base of my spine. To my utter embarrassment, a whimper sounded in my throat.
My cheeks flamed and I suddenly couldn't look into those green eyes anymore.
"Maybe determining one's compatibility with another?" I whispered back with a shrug. We shared a laugh just as Sinistra started calling attendance.
"You… You what?"
I'd never seen him blush. But there he was, pretending to take notes with the
My eyes locked with his, and all my humor died. There it was, swimming in those emerald pools, as clear as day. I wanted to hide from it
"I… I think it was… When you came to find me by the lake. I'd expected you to be tense around me, but you weren't, and… W-when I glanced up, you were pulling grass out of the ground and your glasses had slid down your nose. It was p-probably when you pushed them back up and looked at me."
I wasn't about to press him about it, since he was silently following me back to the castle, but I was suddenly struck with the juxtaposition of the Malfoy I knew and the man walking just behind me. I cast a glance back at him, a frown rippling my forehead. His eyes were downcast, and I followed them to see his fingers anxiously picking at each other. One of his hands was wrapped in bandages.
His playful expression softened as he came up to me, taking my face in his hands and kissing me soundly.
"Which is no one's fault. Hell, if we're pointing fingers, how do you think
Once we'd gathered all the books from our list, we brought them back to the table and spread them out. He took half and I took half, and we started going through and making notes of page numbers with relevant information. I was honestly shocked at the progress we'd made in one free period by the time the bell signaled the end.
"Or can I?" My lips moved of their own accord, but my voice wasn't my own. It was a sound all too familiar, and it made my flesh crawl. Suddenly, a knife was in my hand, and my body moved on its own, shoving it into Harry's chest.
Relate
"Hm," he hummed in assent. We lay there on the grass peacefully for a long several moments before we both resurfaced into consciousness.
My lungs expanded to their capacity, and I couldn't exhale. A few kisses were pressed to the insides of my thighs, and just when I thought the anticipation would kill me, he finally took me in his mouth. Suddenly, I
‘I’m not only enamoured with you, I’m impressed by you. You don’t trust my judgement?’
“‘S possible,” I shrugged, earning another eye roll from Draco.
“Not bloody likely. ‘Mione’s got me doing all sorts of studying after school, I’d never have the time.”
Harry stifled a snort.
dropped into the seat opposite me, scaring the shit out of me.
"And…?" Hermione beamed at me expectantly. When I didn't answer, she sighed. "What you think of each other is that
"He… Used to call me Dragon, Drag for short."
After class, I decided I'd go talk to Malfoy. Whether or not anyone saw me didn't matter, I wasn't doing it to make a point. There were just some things I had to know.
s sounded from the table. Once seated, I cast Harry a curious glance, which he merely returned with a shrug.
“Okay.”
"Mmmmorning," I groaned as I stretched my limbs over him.
Was one for the books.”
Flitwick launched into his lecture, and I half-heartedly tried to take notes and follow along with the reading, but the other half of me was intent on Draco. What was he thinking now?
The Dark Lord's name had rarely been uttered in my presence, and hearing it now seemed to shake my psyche because the train literally shuddered.
"Hey," he called my attention back to his softly smiling face. "You know you're
"You both seem… Happy."
"Twat," I said with a subdued smile as I turned and left, closing the door behind me quietly.
"I… Wow… Just… What…?" Harry gasped. I wheezed a laugh.
I winced, hoping he hadn't jinxed it. Thankfully, we arrived at the doors to the Great Hall without incident. The enormous double doors swung open to allow us in. Everything in here looked untouched, too. Uninhabited, even.
A shiver ran up my spine as his palms slid up my back, gently inviting me back down. His face lifted slightly, and I obliged, closing our lips together again.
Of course, Ron and Hermione would be each others' pair, and no doubt several other students would ask to work with me, but did I want to work with any of
We walked in silence together to the Astronomy tower, and I had to slow my pace exponentially to keep stride with him as we approached. We were bringing up the trailing end of the class, so no one saw when he paused outside the stairwell. I waited with him in silence as he mustered his courage.
He gave me a sad smile, and I couldn't help but lean in to wrap my arms around him. The tugging of him into my embrace sent him forward and me backward until we were sprawled out on the grass, dissolving into easy laughter.
"Do you have dreams like that… Often?"
"You…" He laughed in disbelief. "You
"Well…" He cleared his throat. "One day, it was raining, so we couldn't go out, and we were ransacking my father's liquor cabinet, and he… Just…" He fidgeted uncomfortably, but I'd never hung on someone's words like his in this moment. "Pushed me to the floor, and…" His Adam's apple bobbed as he swallowed. "Sucked me off."
, was subtly coaching me in my ear when my charms were off. To be honest, my heart simply wasn't in it.
"I'd say you already have," he returned my own words in kind. I smirked.
gotta be enough to distract you, right?"
My internal self-assurance did not, in fact, assure me. I truly did
"Sorry, I… I think that was me."
"N-no, I don't. Do you?"
'What happened last night?'
. When did we start walking to class together? And what did everyone else think?
“Well, I’ll just have to try. What about you, Draco? Any interest in extra-curriculars?”
"No, we were never affectionate with each other. I guess… My first kiss was with my first time."
"Before I was really allowed to know what my father was involved in," Draco continued, seeing me listening so intently. "He would have these guests over, and… One of them had a son around my age, must've been like, fifteen… And we were mostly left to our own devices when our fathers would have their clandestine meetings, so…"
It was then that I realized, apart from Hermione, everyone was watching me expectantly.
'What are you, a Gryffindor?'
"I'd spend the night in your mind over mine any night."
My own words echoed in my ears, and I winced internally, but his vulnerable expression shifted into something like compassion.
"I'll say," Draco snorted. "What part of
"Of course," Harry chided. My musings from earlier this morning rang through my head,
My cheeks reddened as I realized, in the moment, I definitely would
'We tried to make it work for a little while, but when shit hit the fan, our priorities shifted. We're still friends, but I don't think we were ever a very good match. I suppose I just felt left out when Ron and Hermione got together.'
Now that I only had my own pleasure to contend with, I could focus more. My hand that
"Really? What for?"
My eyes skimmed his words before looking up to his in confusion. Fascination seemed to sparkle behind his green eyes, and my heart stuttered.
"Um… Er… Well, I… Think you're incredibly brave, and kind, and strong of character. I'm… Very grateful to you, but I'm sure everyone is, too, so…"
I swallowed as I massaged the same spot, wishing I could see Draco's face more clearly. His breathing turned heavy, though, so I assumed I was doing an alright job.
picture it,
They all exchanged glances, but of course, Hermione was the first to chime in.
"Can I have some more water?"
I cast an assuring glance around at Slughorn, McGonagall, and Flitwick as I pulled the Slytherin girl into my arms.
that much
As he rolled onto his back, I took advantage of the bed and stretched my own limbs. My elbow barely collided with his brow, and I suddenly flipped over.
, but continued nonetheless.
I swallowed the mouthful I'd chewed and stared down at my plate.
A scowl darkened his brow.
Another flush crept into my cheeks as we both wrapped our towels around our waists and brushed our teeth with the two toothbrushes that'd presented themselves on the sink.
"'S fine," was all he said.
Harry smiled up at me, and I returned it, gently stroking his hair off his forehead. With a sniff and sigh, he pulled back finally.
"Herbology research in free period again?"
but I hastily brushed that aside. He was probably just being polite, again.
"Still, it's beautiful. We should try using your telescope anyway, and just see what's up there."
"Wow. This… Makes so much sense." I commented as I walked around the room, observing not even a single atom of dust.
her? I thought you were more keen to keep it a secret."
"We can use mine."
The regret twisting my heart suddenly relaxed, and I found gratitude swell up to replace it. I took another sip of my drink, fighting the grimace as the last drops slipped down my throat.
She was only teasing, again, but the look in her eyes said
"If you could only see your face right now…"
"This is
"Yeah. Thanks."
"Well, lucky for you,
"I find it hard to believe myself." His humor suddenly sobered as his cheeks flamed. He dropped his gaze to his lap and continued quietly, "Having you beside me… Emboldens me, somehow."
the day the whole school found out I was shacking up with Draco would be the day we’d have to stand before our peers and give a presentation. My mouth went dry as we slid into our seats.
"Impossible!" My voice still wasn't my own, and the terror his voice inspired in me caused even my possessed hands to tremble.
tired of having to face terrifying things and losing people, seeing death everywhere I looked…" His eyes were far away again, and I reached over to squeeze his hand. With an apologetic smile, he wrapped his fingers back around my hand. "Sorry. I really know how to kill a mood, don't I?"
However, towards the end of the lunch period, I saw Malfoy get up to leave when a group of other Slytherins pushed past him, intentionally knocking him to the floor and scattering his belongings. With a loathsome sigh, I stood.
The girls exchanged glances.
“Dunno, Harry, she might say she will but will’ve already made up her mind as soon as she knows you’re interested.” Ron suggested, and I sighed.
“How the fuck am I supposed to sit on the bench casually now?”
Draco hummed in assent, and I clumsily offered my empty glass back to his wand. After refilling it, I swallowed as much of it as I could. Seeing I'd drunk all I could, he took the glass from my hand and set both of ours down on the bedside table.
A soundless voice sounded in my head, but I immediately knew whose it was. My head whipped round to easily find Harry's smirk.
"What did she say?"
Draco's cheeks flamed as his eyes lighted on this last note.
“There’ll be plenty of time for both.” He pulled my face close enough to kiss my forehead, right on my scar. “That is, unless you don’t think you could go a few
Harry's intonation said he was nearly there, and suddenly, I was, too. It’d been far too long, and I couldn’t help but be swept up in his ecstasy. "
"Did you know the prophecy could've been about someone else?"
"Yeah. Thanks."
‘I can always tell now when you’re thinking about fucking me’
Rodolfo."
"Sure. Maybe… Something
The dust never seemed to settle on Draco's life. Deafening whispers followed him through Platform 9¾, and dread sank in his gut as he searched desperately for an empty compartment. Luckily for him, the third from the back was unclaimed. A sigh broke through his lips as he dropped into the seat, but he couldn't quite taste the relief on his breath. As the train rolled out of the station, he thought on his predicament.
"H-hey, Malfoy."
Harry hummed in assent, casting his gaze 360 degrees around us.
"Yeah, disgustingly so, but…" Seamus tore a bite of bread off in his mouth and continued around it. "Far be it from us to stand in the way of happiness."
, I decided. I'd ignore him until I couldn't anymore.
A grimace twisted my face as the sympathy I felt for him solidified in me. I crouched beside his fitful form and clapped a hand to his shoulder.
The class passed by in a blur, and by the end, I was starving. I think everyone else was, too, partly because lunch was our next period, but also partly because we had all become much more sensitive to each others' moods. At the sound of the bell, we all gratefully rushed from the room to the Great Hall.
‘It can’t be that simple, right?’
I laughed with him.
My words were lost with an 'mmf-!' as I was once again submerged in sensation. He was pressing himself against me so hard, I had to take a few steps back to compensate. My back found the stone wall and compensation was no longer on the table. His body pressed firmly against mine as his fingers fisted in my hair.
" Draco's hips pressing into mine interrupted me, and the telescope clattered to the floor.
Beyond the
He shook his head as if to say
Unwrapping said bandages revealed that my palm and wrist were starting the phases of scabbing. Unsightly, to say the least, but Pomfrey quietly assisted in redressing them, this time applying a creamy white potion to my wounds. I hissed as her practiced hands spread the cream onto my skin, but found as soon as I could perceive the pain of my wounds being prodded, a numbing sensation replaced the pain.
We lay there a few minutes more before I slowly withdrew from him, earning a groan from his lips. Once extracted, I let my body fall limp on him.
"This is weird. I know you're still sixteen because that's the last time I saw you, but can we… Not do this?" I begged as I forced myself to my feet.
"How the hell did I get so lucky?"
"How…
"But Harry… People might put two and two together on their own, you know…"
as much as I wanted to drown myself in it. After a long, intense silence, he seemed to brace himself. Expecting words like
Harry didn't write back the rest of the class.
Was the only answer I could whisper back. She gave me a concerned side-eye, but thankfully decided to drop it, instead deciding to catch me up on what all they'd covered in the first ten minutes of class.
"Ho… Holy shit… Oh fuck… Oh my god…"
like you could have the confidence to
Warmth spread through my cheeks as I stared down at my hands in my lap. A strange frustration knit my brow, and I realized I was annoyed that I wasn't angrier. Harry's persistence ticked me off, but I wanted to be irritated enough to tell him to fuck off. I found that I just couldn't do it.
"And you used to call me…?"
Draco's arm under my neck curled to rub my back as he pressed a kiss to my head.
Harry looked incredibly sad, but I was too curious to filter my questions. How many people could say they'd used
The exhaustion of the day started to weigh on Draco, but before he let himself succumb to sleep, he hastily withdrew his Dreamless Sleep from his luggage and downed a mouthful. No way was he going to sleep his first night back at Hogwarts without it. He eventually fell asleep, still fully-clothed.
I glanced up at him just as his slumped form stiffened. Curiously, I followed his gaze to our Headmistress giving her lecture.
We boarded an unmanned boat, and it carried us silently across the water. Eventually, the castle came into view, and everything looked… Pristine. No bodies, no carnage, no destruction. It was then I realized we'd changed into our robes. Harry glanced between us and chuckled.
"I… Didn't bring a change of clothes." He huffed.
"Mister Malfoy?" I winced at my father's title, but realized I hadn't been paying attention and had no idea what I was being asked.
Still, it stung my heart a bit to know what my peers thought of Malfoy. Not that I didn't understand, even somewhat agree, but… Didn't Malfoy do everything he did because if he didn't, Voldemort would've killed him?
"We're not just
"You know, you make this face sometimes… When you're deep in thought, I assume about something pleasant, where your lips curl up just slightly, and your ears turn pink." One of his hands lifted from his glass to grasp his ear, and I grinned. "The first time I saw it was our first day in the library, when we were picking out our books. I think it was probably the moment I realized I fancied you."
Hermione's words were the only thing preventing me from sprinting back up the stairs to check on Draco.
Lucius wasn't worth all the hatred in Draco's heart, however. Some, he saved for himself. It chafed his ego to admit he had made mistakes, but the weight of his regrets was heavy enough without trying to maintain his pride. True, he had been raised to look down on muggle-borns, but to be painted with the same colors as those who would see them all dead… It sent chills down his spine. He had spent weeks scratching at the skin where his Dark Mark was, trying to scrape it off. He had only succeeded in adding to the multitude of scars in his skin and terrifying his mother.
I wanted to apologize for subconsciously invading his privacy, but I was too hung up on the admission he'd made in the dream.
With an impatient motion, I swiped away a stray tear that had trailed down my cheek.
A loud clattering drew my eyes up out of my lap finally and startled the shit out of me. Finnegan had dropped his fork and was staring at me in shock, his face paler than I'd ever thought possible for a Scot.
Another glance at Harry's encouraging expression, and I was uncomfortably stepping over the bench to sit next to him. I'd say I'd never felt so hated by the people around me, but it wouldn't have been true. This was a familiar discomfort.
"You might've fooled him and his goody-goody band of lunatics, but you're a scourge on the Slytherin house. You should just drop out, save yourself the embarrassment."
Just then, the train screeched to a halt, and I winced.
“S-sorry,” he apologized with a flush, which earned a chuckle from me.
‘And what requirements might we require?’ My quill seemed to elongate and exaggerate the ‘require’ in this note on its own before I slid it back to him.
With a curious grin, I touched my forehead to his as I willed him to invite me into his head.
"Jesus, we both need therapy."
always been a fighter." He set his empty glass on the floor before standing and approaching my chair, a confident grin settled onto his face. "What did you have in mind, Mister Potter?"
"A-anyway, I hope you'll forgive me… One day…" He cleared his throat as he shoved his head, then his arms back into his pajama shirt. I waved a hand dismissively.
It was more of an instinct than a decision when I set down my glass of water, dismounted the chair, and went to kiss him. He gasped through his nose as my lips connected with his, and clung to the front of my shirt. Before I could process what was happening, he was leaning back and pulling me down on top of him.
"Really?"
"Not with
"Stop beating yourself up.
"Er… Come on in," he invited as he stood out of the way to let me in.
"I think…"
The irony of her bringing her father into the situation suddenly had me stifling a laugh.
Experimentally, I did just that. Harry's delicious gasp drew air directly from my mouth as his hands seized my waist. It took all my willpower to pull my face a few inches away and look down into his eyes. Their shocked wideness eased as they drooped slightly. I was suddenly struck by the contrast of his beet-red face and the bright green of his irises.
My eyes snapped up to Draco, bringing me back to my senses.
what this is all about! You just wanted more
"Draco… He's
to disappear and let the chips fall where they may." He ducked his flushed face, and when he spoke again, it was barely a whisper. "When I woke up, it was like no time had passed, but… I spent
Draco's hand carefully reached onto my desk and stole back the journal page, interrupting my internal monologue.
Feeling us both cum together was one thing, but watching his face as he did was another. Once he’d collapsed onto me, I was sure I’d never have a better orgasm.
We laughed together, and our mutual discomfort seemed to ease. Now, I was just left with a topless Harry Potter and the heat in my face. I struggled not to stare as he leaned down and grabbed his shirt off my floor.
Draco flicked his quill back and forth as we contemplated this. An entire presentation came and went before either of us could come up with an answer. Draco was the first to take a guess, though.
It was a weird kind of smug, though. I didn't think he was just gleeful that I was uncomfortable, but it was more like… He was…
About… All kinds of embarrassing things about me.
I couldn't ignore how
"Details. Or at least more of an explanation."
"Yeah, maybe…" I glanced around again, grimacing at the unnatural stillness.
I took this to mean I was doing a good job, and felt a certain satisfaction at the fact. If I could do half as much as he did for me the previous night, I'd have no regrets. His moans were increasing in pitch, though, and as they did, I was suddenly disappointed.
"Drag?" Harry obviously asked, and I rolled my eyes.
) staring down at a book, a soft pink coloring his cheeks, and a gentle smile curving his lips. Under the instinctual curiosity, a thought I hadn't expected crossed my mind.
"Nothing, I guess." He sipped his water again. "So… Quidditch practice is Monday Wednesday Friday, right?"
I glanced at what he'd written and rolled my eyes, a grin creeping back into my face. Before I could respond though, he lowered his quill back to the paper.
‘I hope you don’t regret anything, because I don’t.’
drew the truth from my lips, but I swallowed it.
know why.
He was at the liquor cabinet several long moments as I emptied my glass of water. With shaker in hand, he turned back towards me.
The posse of Gryffindors I’d ripped through had dispersed as several professors arrived at the scene.
"I killed you seven times, I'll kill you again," I threatened gravely.
"True."
you?" My word was elongated as a sigh escaped my lips, and a shiver ran up my spine.
My warm cheeks warmed further as I realized
I huffed.
I internally scoffed at myself. Was that even a question? Did I
"I-" He tried to say, but his voice came out as a whisper. After clearing his throat, he tried again. "I don't know what to say," he eventually confessed. He still wouldn't meet my eyes as his began to water. "I can't wrap my head around how you can see beyond my past." His voice broke, and it seemed to strike an arrow through my heart.
Draco undoubtedly picked up on my increasingly foul mood, but said nothing as the first pair stood to present. Their project was about some magical fungus, where it was commonly found, what they were used for, and all manner of random facts about them. I barely listened, mulling over how little effort
"I'm sure there's some magical explanation for it, but all I know is… I chose to."
Harry grinned at me, slightly out of breath.
I started with one, of course. I wasn't a
Slughorn continued on with his lecture, but I cast an icy glare back at Harry, whose expression left me dumbfounded.
“What the fuck is going on?” I demanded as I tore through the gathering to crouch over the weeping first-year. “Are you alright?”
He grinned at me as he closed the door behind him.
"It's not gossip when it's about my best friend! Tell me, tell me, tell meeee!"
"Don't I know it." My nose seemed to tingle at the memory of her fist in it. We chuckled together, and Harry casually laced his fingers through mine. I swallowed, and couldn't help but glance around nervously. "You're in a good mood."
laughed. He laughed like he couldn't help it, and it was the most beautiful thing I'd ever heard. He laughed like he'd been holding it in his entire life.
"You're taking the mickey," Seamus supposed in disbelief.
Just as my anxiety was fanning itself into anger, I heard the door at the back of the room click and swing open.
"I've known you a long time, Harry. I know when there's something you don't want to talk about, and I
"Oh, a tiny bit! Well, I'll try to keep that in mind."
Draco smirked, and I suddenly realized I'd been meaning to ask him…
"Don't see why not. She wouldn't send us into town to collect herbs she grows personally, right?"
Eventually, though, it was time to go to class. I was so accustomed to arriving early, it was a strange experience to follow the general flow of students to our respective classrooms. Harry fidgeted anxiously all the way to class, even though his hand was twined tightly in mine.
I tried my best to pick up on what they'd covered last time via context clues, but focusing on language became increasingly difficult as I took in my surroundings. I'd never been overly fond of our previous Headmaster, but the trauma from that night seemed to seep out of the cracks in the walls and soak directly into my feet. The memory of the flash of green light that night nearly blinded me.
I grit my teeth. I was used to being the topic of gossip, but now that I'd fought in an actual WAR, my love life was still the focal point.
We shared a smile before his eyes glanced behind me.
His expression said he wanted to feel bad, but didn't in the slightest. The conflict there seemed to settle into something like satisfaction as I brushed past him to find my wand. I wasn't as upset as I was acting, but once my enchantments were back in place, the slight amount I was upset vanished, and was quickly replaced with something like
saying, if you even just showed up at tryouts tonight, you’d have your old position back, one hundred percent guarantee.”
I nearly fell stepping back over the bench, but didn't let it slow my escape from the crowded Great Hall. I didn't check to see if Draco was following me, I only walked until I found a secluded hallway.
I held as still as I possibly could as Harry adjusted. When I felt his muscles relax, I slowly pulled myself almost all the way out, and was rewarded with a new kind of groan from him. Relaxed as he was, I pushed myself into him a bit more quickly this time. Another moan sounded in my throat as I assumed a painfully slow pace with him.
"Just what the hell do you think you're doing with that
A strangled kind of laugh coughed out of my throat, and I realized I was crying.
After dinner, Draco nearly had to run to keep up with me as I rushed back to the dorms. As dumb as I probably looked, I was excited to hang out in his room. I'd gotten a glimpse this morning, but I wanted a full tour.
I glanced back at his grin, and once again, the sight of him naked and reclining nearly stopped my heart.
I shook my head to clear that thought from it, and exited my room. Once in the common room, I strove not to hone in on the whispers that surrounded me, instead making a bee-line for the Great Hall. Once there, I found Harry already seated at the Gryffindor table next to Hermione. As I headed to join them, she saw me first, and I blanched.
‘Incorrigible’ I penned, but before sliding the note back, I glanced at him. A smug grin spread his lips as his eyes absorbed this word, and I continued. ‘How the hell do you figure I’m braver than you?’
The sound of his laughter made me feel oddly warm, but the words he said made my blood run cold.
The Slytherins went pale and backed away, not even bothering to utter excuses before they fled. As we watched their retreating figures, I suddenly broke down in laughter. Harry came back to sit across from me, a smug grin on his face.
‘The room of requirement can meet numerous requirements at once’
"Despite your interest in
had started echoing in my mind throughout the days.
"We found ways to entertain ourselves."
we can go.”
The thought sent me cackling quietly to myself, and Harry cast me a suspicious glance. I offered a dismissive gesture as we settled into our seats. Flitwick’s lecture began, and we both somehow strove to pay attention. Memories from last night playing behind my eyelids threatened to distract me, but I persevered. Predictably, though, our note-passing Horcrux slid onto my desk eventually.
We arrived to class just in time, and slid into our seats in unison. My mood was still grim as I withdrew my textbook from my bag and opened it to the last chapter we were on. As McGonagall launched into her lecture for the day, my chin rested in my palm.
His expression winced as I closed my hips to his, and I heard his silent voice in my mind say,
I frowned at him, resting my chin on my wrist.
"Morning," came Harry's reply.
Just as he said that, the train began decelerating. My eyebrows shot upward.
"No. You think I should? An
"Leave it alone, Hermione," I tried to sound threatening, but I wasn't truly worried she'd do anything to jeopordize the situation. She was just taking the mickey, but if anyone else caught on at this stage…
"Their inventory refreshes so often, I bet there will be."
He pressed on, nearly jogging down the corridor until he turned a corner and descended the stairs into the courtyard. I trailed behind him, feeling an increasing sense of panic.
Draco paused mid-swallow and lowered the cup from his lips.
what’s not fair…”
My answer spilled from my lips before I had time to reconsider.
"Nothing!" He glanced at my clearly disbelieving face, and sighed. "It… I mean… I was just w-wondering…"
"Harry?"
Toward the end of class, Sprout assigned us a project. Group up in pairs, choose a research topic, and create a presentation to share with the class.
His answering chuckle silenced the both of us as we turned our attentions back to the books before us.
saying that wouldn’t be fair. I don’t want special treatment, I’d want to earn my spot on the team.”
"D-did you have a moment like that? About me?"
“Oh, god, I’m gonna be sick… Ow!” Seamus reached down for his ankle, and I had to assume Hermione’d kicked him. This seemed to bring Harry’s presence of mind back as he cast her a sideways glance. She was happily spooning porridge into her mouth.
Okay, this time, I was honestly just trying to keep him out of trouble, but what I'd heard filled my heart almost painfully full.
"They… They were?" Harry nodded earnestly. "Uh… Well, I… Um…"
"Of course. A terrible thing happened here, one that directly affected you. Anyone who blames you is a fool."
Draco was up and ready and in the Great Hall for breakfast before anyone else was awake, just to avoid interacting. He nearly fell asleep in his plate a few times, but it was worth it to avoid the nightmares, as well. He happened to glimpse a very disheveled Harry Potter arriving earlier than most, but he didn't seem to notice him.
“Ha!”
At one point, he happened to glance up across the hall and his eyes immediately met all-too-familiar green eyes. He ducked his head with a flush, hoping he'd be able to avoid a confrontation with the Boy Who Lived, but imagining different scenarios nonetheless.
"No… Cast a Patronus."
My amusement splintered, though, when I pictured everyone else following my lead and being facetiously nice to him like some running joke. It'd still be a kind of bullying…
"O-oh. Right. Well…" With a glance at me, he joined the flow of students, and I followed.
I frowned.
"You've… Never been very close to her, have you?"
"Just darkness."
"Well… Patronuses are summoned from good memories, so I… Can't say I'm surprised, but… Maybe we can make some good memories together? Ones that would be strong enough to produce a Patronus?"
took over his features. His hands were still on my cheeks as I leaned forward to kiss that damnably snoggable face. The hands on my face pressed our lips together more tightly, and I thought I’d pass out so fast was my heart thudding in my ribs.
My eyebrow raised at him incredulously.
My thoughts halted as the following realization occurred.
But I couldn't possibly take his again. He was only trying to offer some comfort in an uncomfortable situation, right?
"Yeah, well, those people don't know you like I do," he snorted.
"Fine. I won't promise we'll end up best mates, but I'll… Protect him from the others."
Once we set our bags down on the table, Harry produced the list of books from last time and we set back to work recollecting them. I was painfully aware of the social avoidance, the whispers, but Harry seemed stubbornly ignorant. Summoning up my courage, I decided to follow his lead, keeping focused on the task at hand. With arms full, we returned to our table and laid them all out.
I couldn't rightly say if I was ready or not, but I nodded nonetheless. With painstaking caution, he pushed himself into me.
My head spun as I considered the possibility that McGonagall had predicted we'd have such chemistry. And if so,
Yes, Harry…?”
he was. His half-lidded eyes glanced from mine to my lips, and just like that, they were back on his.
My mouth fell open.
"Isn't it?" I commented as I propped myself up to sit against the headboard. "What a different world it'd be now if
"Think it'll be… Y'know… A battleground?"
His guilty glance up at me softened my heart a bit, and I uncrossed my arms.
"What can I say? I want to know everything about you."
"Yeah, this one's full of surprises, aren't you?"
he wasn't."
'I never claimed to be Hermione. Snacks?'
I wiped away another tear.
‘Everyone is, for any scrap of news on my comings and goings. I hate the spotlight.’
"What memory do you use?"
Hermione held my arm while jumping up and down and squealing.
The wave of possessiveness that washed over me shocked me.
I looked up at him, only to see him pretending to flip through his textbook, an adorable pink staining his cheeks.
"Anytime. Let me get you some water."
"Right."
I wondered.
"Apologies aren't necessary. I understand it must be difficult to be here." I grimaced down at the floor. "If there's anything I can do to make it easier for you, please don't hesitate to let me know. Even if it's looking the other way every once in a while when you don't show up. I know Mr. Potter will keep you abreast of the lessons."
'What time are you thinking? And where?'
"Easier than filling pints at a pub?"
“Morning,” I commented as he stretched his pale limbs over me.
"Corny git. What do you want?" I dared him.
We filed into Flitwick’s classroom just as everyone else was arriving, and found two desks beside each other against the far left wall of the room. The others purposefully avoided sitting too near us, but I found the whole situation rather hilarious.

"Harry…

"Hey."
"Harry, that's
"Your first time… Was with another guy… And you
“Yeah,” I replied as we took hands again and made our way to where our friends were looking on. A range of expressions painted their expressions, but we silently slid onto the bench and began loading up our plates from the dishes. Eventually, the group’s cumulative amazement relaxed as they returned to their dinners.
He chuckled again, and it infected me.
"Actually… He
"I usually dream of dying."
I stopped suddenly. My irritation wasn't for him, but it was certainly
This paradigm shift sent me reeling as my quill hesitated over the page. It wasn’t even quite a paradigm shift, though. I’d all but worshipped him as a child, but when I’d actually started going to school with him, he’d seemed like an arrogant prick.
'Maybe 9? And how's your room?'
in his thick Scottish accent. Anyone, everyone, someone. But nobody uttered a word.
"I want to watch," I explained.
"Anything you wanna talk about?"
Turning my gaze from his concerned face, I resolutely pulled his pajama trousers and briefs down to his ankles. Having come face-to-face with his erection, I swallowed. Thankfully, he'd dropped his head back onto the bed, so whatever reaction I'd had was hidden from him. I ran my hands back up his legs, and curiously leaned in to nudge him with my nose. One of his legs twitched, and I nearly missed the quiet half-gasp he gave. This only encouraged me, though, and I decisively ran my tongue over his tip.
A look of awe overtook Draco’s curiosity as his eyes raked over my clumsily scrawled message. He turned this look up at me, and I shrugged. Snatching the page back, he replied with a short answer.
I shrugged, and we both laughed.

about you! You're wasting away with Dementors sucking the life out of you daily."
“Morning.” The muttered responses were underwhelming, but Hermione took one glance at us and snickered into her porridge.
but directed his next words at her.
I want from him? He already knew McGonagall was asking me to be nice to him, but eating dinner with him? What exactly compelled me to do this?
She beamed up at me.
"Er, do you know who you're talking to?"
"Well what did he say?" She looped her arm through mine and led me back out to the hall.
My legs were just barely reaching an ache (I had been at Quidditch tryouts for the first time in years today) when he surprised me by flipping us over. This motion was accompanied by an
"A new year begins at Hogwarts. I wish to welcome you, and welcome you back, not with warnings or bad news, but with hope. The reality of us all gathering once again in this Hall is a victory – a triumph in the face of evil. Let us never forget, we are witches and wizards, and we do not cower in the face of fear. We stand firm, we reunite, and we push on. Let this year be a new chapter in our stories."
"I'd like you to set an example to the other students. They might be afraid of the ones who've been given a second chance, but I'd very much like to avoid that chance going to waste."
The door shattered as Harry pushed it open. Several people from adjoining offices let out startled shrieks and Draco put a hand on Harry’s shoulder.
he will!”
Draco crossed his arms in front of his chest. “See? Overprotective. I’m perfectly capable of reading some notes. It’s not like I’m going to perform any magic soon.”
'Pansy was just for appearance's sake. Truth be told, we hated one another. Still do, if I'm honest.'
‘Tonight it is’
I didn't sleep easily that night, even with Dreamless Sleep.
"I've… Never really had much game… I guess…" Memories of the nightmare that was finding a date to the Yule Ball resurfaced, and I winced.
"'Mione, I really don't see how that's any of your business," I asserted as I tore myself from her hands. My legs carried me to my dresser, where I withdrew my blazer, and started pulling it onto me. One glance behind me at her pitiful expression drew yet
"Have you ever considered writing a book?" Harry gave me a curious expression.
He seemed distressed, and deep in thought, as we went, and I clutched his hand in mine. The smile he turned to me was obviously forced, but I didn’t comment on it. As we slid into the bench at the Gryffindor table, I audibly hissed again, despite my best efforts. It was a few moments into our meal that Ron and Hermione finally joined us.
"Harry?"
"Hermione. Ron. Everyone."
. So long as mother was alright, he could bear any uncertainty.
"Morning," I commented noncommittally as I sat beside Harry, sliding his wand into his pocket subtly.
My lips lowered to whisper against his parted, panting lips.
With a sigh, Draco set his cup down on his night stand and backed up onto his bed, lifting one foot onto the edge and leaning back on his hands.
with the guy, what the fuck was I supposed to say?
“No point beating around the bush at this point. They would’ve found out sooner or later.”
you all McGonagall asked Harry to be nice to Malfoy. What did you expect?" Ron interjected, his mouth full.
Slughorn called out a page number just then, and we both strived to look engaged as we flipped to said page. The context for the lecture was lost on me, and I assumed for Harry, too, but our conversation seemed to die naturally at this point as we both turned our attention to the lesson. An emotion I couldn’t name festered in my chest, but neither of us wrote back for the remainder of the class.
“That wasn’t so bad, was it?” Draco whispered to me as the next pair began their presentation. My eyes rolled again, but I withdrew the journal page to respond.

thing I’ve ever done because I wanted to.”
"I believe I have something to make up to you, don't I?"
"Hi yourself," I returned. We both turned to look out the window, and only familiar scenery could be seen for miles. "Well, this is a right sight better than I'd expected."
"Draco?"
Draco's other eyebrow raised, and he was stunned silent for a brief moment before we both descended into hysterics. Our laughter didn't subside for a good several minutes, until we were both wiping away tears.
Draco certainly did not expect to get any work done when Monday evening came. He didn’t even expect he would so much as touch a single book. Although he also didn’t expect Madam Pince to be there, bowed low over the library catalogue.

Draco tapped his wand against the open wound and it sealed itself shut neatly, leaving behind smooth skin, the tone not a bit lighter than the rest of Harry’s hand. Draco took another picture immediately, telling himself it

“Over a

“They say that dogs and their owners are often alike,” Potter mused, apparently already in far better spirits than he had been all evening. “But I really don’t see it. He’s much friendlier than you are.”
, Harry! You can’t talk about them like that.”
, Draco wasn’t planning on ever acting on it, much less mentioning it to anyone, and he sure as hell wasn’t comfortable with what Potter was insinuating, which was apparently that they were involved with each other.
Harry, who was still wearing his Quidditch clothes, leaned over the edge of the bed and fished for something on the floor. Then he slapped a copy of Witch Weekly against his chest, crossed his arms and watched Draco.

has no integrity himself,” Draco said coldly.
Potter nudged his shoulder and asked rather casually, “So, why did you say you couldn’t eat anything I give you?”
“Are you really sure?”
It really was him.
Harry’s head whipped up and his eyes found him, and Dayal used the distraction to attach one of the restraints to his right wrist. Harry growled and wrenched his arm away before Dayal could fasten the other end to the stretcher.
Then there was Felicity. Her family had stayed impartial in the war, but Draco never would have suspected her to sympathise with Muggles. Maybe this was about image? People rarely admitted to having belonged to Slytherin nowadays. But Cuffe had said that the informant had been
used to it.”
Potter grimaced as he watched Draco hobble towards his chair on one foot, and
Draco raised an eyebrow. “And it was an interrogation,
It had been fun watching her, Pure-Blood Slytherin that she was, put Harry in his place. Provided she wasn’t selling him out to get him off the team, of course.
“So, you’ve forgiven her for beating you up that one time?”
They were sitting on either side of Professor McGonagall. They hadn’t even talked about it beforehand – sitting next to each other here, in public, would have been too much. They were getting plenty of looks already (Harry probably a bit more than Draco) and Draco was feeling kind of paranoid. To him, Harry’s hair seemed even more rumbled than usual. He felt like the whole world must be able to see it for what it was – Harry looked like he had just stumbled out of bed.
“And full of additives. Also, this one has expired.”
Anyway, here is
All capitalised, probably. Haven’t got one of those, have you?”
Problem was, he wanted this child to like him.
“No, you didn’t,” Potter grinned. “But only because you couldn’t even keep standing straight for more than five seconds.”
“What the

“Yeah, tell me about it,” Potter said matter-of-factly. “

the whole reason you’re here? To ask me on a date?”
Harry was kneeling in front of Draco’s fireplace with his head stuck in the green flames. Two cups of tea and a plate of buttered toast stood on the kitchen table. Draco’s stomach growled at the sight, so he sat down and took one. Aurelius lay down on his bare feet while the stag stood majestically by his side.
“None,” said Samantha, holding his gaze. “This is for your actual job. The one that

Harry did not immediately sit up to inspect the damage. Instead, he hummed in blind confirmation.
As soon as the lung was halfway presentable, he abandoned the torso and strode around the table to focus on the head instead, which – by some miracle – seemed to be alright, if you didn’t count the numerous lacerations.

“I’m fine, thank you Mrs. Maloney. How are you?”
Potter had spotted him immediately and grabbed his arm to tow him through the crowd, introducing him to a ton of people as

Pansy, but only by the time seventh year had rolled around.
“Take what?”
“Impressive. Without using any magic?” Draco said, opening some of the cupboards at random. All of them contained cookware, neatly stacked.
“Please continue.”
Harry glared at him and crossed his arms. “Yeah, well,
now? There was no telling how Harry would react if Draco just called for him. He didn’t really want to startle him. It felt kind of intrusive, just coming in unannounced. Even if Harry had done the same on Christmas

Harry groaned. “Do you have any idea how much pizza I had?”
By the end of the week, Harry had three different Slytherin girlfriends, depending on who you asked, and Draco hadn’t been alone with him once.
“Do you?” –
“You’re only about twenty percent annoying,” Lauren added. “And I have a feeling you only

He wasn’t prepared to see the whole right side of Harry’s chest. He certainly wasn’t prepared to see so much of Harry’s

The cheering died down abruptly, giving way to confused silence.

. People should really stop calling me that.”
Harry interrupted his inspection by dragging him over to where the TV stood. They sat down on the middle couch, which – by the look of its worn cushions – seemed to be the best of the three. The girls were busy in the kitchen, so Draco leaned over to him and asked, “So, what are the rules here?”
Well, this certainly wasn’t what Draco had expected. He chose his next words carefully. “So … you were afraid people would know we’re seeing each other because I know about your family? Don’t worry;
“He’s one of the Ancients,” muttered Marc, concentrating very hard on his menu. “Can we talk about something else?”
“Yeah, why not,” Potter said and then, as subtle as a Bludger to the face, immediately changed the subject. “How did you come to own a golden retriever?”
only finding out now?”
“Harry’s getting better, only they won’t let him leave Mungo’s for another day or two. So he sent me instead.”
The song came back with such force and clarity that Draco would have fallen off the swing a second time, had this not been a memory. As it was, he had to settle for yelping and leaping right through his own past self, which obviously was so entranced it wouldn’t have noticed even if it had been real.
“Yep. Don’t worry, we already offered to hex him. More than once.”
That seemed to be the way the Weasley’s coped – today, it wasn’t just George pranking them. All of them pranked each other mercilessly and then claimed responsibility by shouting those two words.
Kreacher nodded so fast his ears were slapping against his shoulders repeatedly. He didn’t seem to mind at all, looking up at Harry hopefully.
“So, you’ll un-request him, then?” Harry asked grimly.
“No, maybe it isn’t. But under these circumstances, I’m not discharging you. I’d estimate it will take you about two months to get back on your feet, provided you do all the exercises on your own,” Draco said.
On the other side of the field were the
Potter turned his back on him then and put his shirt back on, which took rather long. Draco suspected that his injuries were more painful than he let on. Fine by him. Potter could stand to suffer a little if he didn’t want Draco’s help.
please trust me too?” Potter pleaded.
Draco shushed him again, desperately searching for a way out.
“It went something like this,” said Draco, followed by his best attempt at imitating the squeaky sound through humming.
Three years ago, he never would have dared to treat Draco like that.
“She didn’t!” Draco threw his hands up in frustration.
“What about her?”
“Violet?” Harry’s voice was awfully thin.
“Seriously?” Harry sounded as if Draco had just told him there were twelve fully grown giants waiting for them behind the door. “How could you possibly know that?”
heal that? And what a fucking good job he did too. Just look at that scar – completely unnecessary!”

A lot, then. People knew already. That it was his fault. Draco wondered if the family had sent a letter yet. He wouldn’t ask.
“Odysseus,” Harry spat out. “Odysseus wasn’t his owl; it was
As soon as they were out of view, there were two shouts of “Harry!”.
“I’m sorry, Harry,” she said – looking at him again, like a maniac. “Lauren
The noise died down when he reached thirty-four. Cold hands were placed over his at seventy-five. At eighty-one, Harry’s body was draped against his back and he pressed his lips against the back of Draco’s head only a second later.
Harry had just set one foot on the first stair when the owl screeched.
Draco forced his eyes open just as Harry leaned over him, his brilliant green eyes staring deep into Draco’s as if he was searching for something.
He got up from the sofa then, and not at all because apparently, just a few hours ago, a Slytherin and a Gryffindor had shagged there, which he still had trouble accepting. Of course, they had almost killed each other shortly thereafter and
Harry didn’t reply, but Draco could feel him chuckle silently. There were worse things than being involved with someone in dire need of a dictionary.
Blaise shook his head in pure denial and ignored her. “She did
Harry kept adjusting his grip on the Lightning Blast even though they were still standing in the empty hallway leading into Blaise’s test stadium, each of them leaning against opposing walls. The doors were closed, but they could hear the mob of excited spectators inside.
Draco almost didn’t see him, because he was sitting at a crowded table, upper body slumped over his book, the hood of his red sweater pulled over his face, head resting on both arms.
“Oh, yeah, no,” the real Harry muttered, waving at the Pensieve to change the memory again. “That wasn’t important, just forget that part.”
Draco pushed Harry’s shoulder, causing him to drop his wand so he could brace himself with both arms behind his back. “
The only thing that made this a little less awkward was Draco being significantly taller than Potter, which meant that they didn’t have to stare into each other’s eyes the whole time. Thank Merlin for small mercies. He didn’t think he could have stood staring into those damn green eyes for longer than a few seconds.
Potter? That was a whole other story.
survive.” Harry sighed.
Draco whiled away the time by sorting the Chocolate Snitch cards. There were thirty-two cards on the side table and Draco was willing to bet that Ron was responsible for eating at least half of the chocolate. That man really had no restraint.
“Blaise!”
“That’s not a fight,” Harry said with a wave of his free hand, which he then used to knock.
Pince nodded silently and then just watched as he inspected the cover with more attention than he had paid all the other books combined. When he started to feel thoroughly ridiculous, he opened the book and, on a whim, lit his wand and held it to the page at point-blank range. Every single fibre stood out in stark detail. There was no way she would be able to accuse him of negligence now. (Which was without a doubt the reason for her visit.)
Harry really didn’t like being restrained. The muscles in his upper arms were flexing like he was only just holding back.
“You’re kind of an arsehole, you know?” Sarah said without much reproach, like she was just stating a fact.
The match was also quite brutal for a non-league match. Maybe the players thought this would be the easiest way to impress somebody who played for the Falmouth Falcons, whose motto called for breaking some heads, after all. They seemed to forget that the Falcons’ players almost never got penalties – they had mastered the art of rule-abiding brutality, even if just barely.
“You’re right, Pansy.” Draco put his fork down neatly. “We
All the blood inside his head suddenly dropped to his stomach. “Her
I'm working from home at the moment, which can get a bit lonely, and it was such a nice to surprise to wake up to all these nice comments :)
“Oh, so you actually
“Let’s hope not,” Harry replied, limping over to the bathroom.
“It’s not like we ever really talk in public, is it?”
Draco turned back to face him, face completely serious. Too late did he notice that the toothpaste on Harry’s stomach was still very much there. Well, at least now Draco knew why he always brushed his teeth shirtless. He had wondered about that, because it wasn’t like Harry was too hot – he always cast a warming charm beforehand.
“I’d rather live,” said Draco, returning his attention to his own (safe) plate.
The door to the study stood open and from inside came the frantic sound of paper rustling. Potter was bent over the desk, flipping through a folder full of newspaper clippings. There was a small tower of identical folders on either side of him.
Draco peeked at him through a gap between his arms just in time to see Potter drop his backpack onto his desk and stuff his whole arm in there.
Draco just shook his head, momentarily lost for words. How had Harry opened the wall? When something touched his arm, he nearly jumped.
“Ah,” said Draco, slamming his book open at the marked spot. “You would rather we’d not be here at the same time.”
If Draco had to describe the look on Felicity’s face, he would have chosen the word
Which was why they were still jammed together an hour and a half later. At least Draco didn’t have to worry about being pressed up against Harry anymore – his right arm had gone to sleep over an hour ago.
“What’s
very intimidating,” Draco assured them. “But let’s get back on topic. Why did Harry punch somebody in the face?”
Yes, he should definitely burn that card as soon as possible. It already seemed to be getting to him.
And this was definitely doing something to Draco. Suddenly he didn’t feel tired or cold at all anymore. The blood inside his head was rushing down fast, apparently feeling it was needed somewhere else. And Draco wanted to agree, but there was still the pressing matter of Potter having broken into his house. And also the small inconvenience of Potter not wanting him, of course. Even if he seemed to be roaming his whole body with his eyes.
But at the same time I wanted to ask what the
"I… I…" Harry's voice began to ascend in pitch, and I couldn't help but speed up.
His implication of spending the rest of our lives together clutched my heart.
Was he jealous of
"Me too."
"Here, try this."
Seamus lifted a smirk, as if he was about to make some snide comment, but suddenly blanched.

I gulped, and he sighed.
I sat up slowly as a
McGonagall eyed me over the tops of her lenses with raised eyebrows.
After that, though? He paused unloading his clothes into the dresser. Any possible future he had previously imagined revolved around his father's influence, but now that he was out of the picture… Draco came up empty.
"Okay! Okay, I'm sorry," he
I swallowed, my cheeks burning.
His mouth opened into a perfect O, and I imagined mine did the same as he filled me. Slowly, I came to settle all the way down on his hips. A groan slipped from my lips as he released the breath he'd been holding with a sigh. I grit my teeth as I adjusted, again, to the sensation. Remembering what I'd learned, though, I forced myself to relax. Once I did, I lifted myself up and dropped down.
“For things like venom or some harmful serums, you only need to extract it, but for poison, it’s critical to have your antidote completely destroy it once it’s in the body. If you don’t want long-lasting side-effects, that is,” Draco chimed in.

"Ahem… S-so, we need to find any and all material having to do with antidotes, right?"
She eyed me cheekily, and I narrowed my eyes at her.
My own words echoed in my head as I tossed and turned.
"If you ever tell anyone I said this, I'll deny it and hex you, but…" She stepped close enough that only I would be able to hear. "Draco and Harry sitting in a tree… K-I-"
stupid.”
Liam noticed Draco then, and he looked him up and down very slowly, which made Draco instantly aware that his trackies were practically clinging to his legs. He sat up carefully, because lying there like that, he felt like some kind of zoo animal.
. Also, he had neither a biceps nor a triceps. He didn’t care how much Marc insisted that Draco looked like some kind of ethereal being – Draco knew that was just a nice phrase to say that he was so pale that he was practically glowing.
Harry glared at him half-heartedly. “Great, why don’t you remind me that all my Muggle friends are going to die of old age long before we will?”
Draco seized Harry’s wrist to keep him from knocking on Lauren and Olivia’s door.
don’t pretend those articles don’t exist!”
“He’s got a phobia,” Potter said, probably because he couldn’t very well tell them that Draco had never been in a car before.
“Fuck this,” he muttered finally and got up again.
Draco chuckled to himself while he made his way over to a group of armchairs arranged in front of one of the windows that looked out into the lake, and took the one next to Pansy.
, alright?

if somebody tried to bribe her. She had that Gryffindor-kinda feeling – a whole lot of opinions and no finesse.
But then Dayal pulled on his end of the restraint around Harry’s wrist, yanking him onto his back.
. His Trainee Healers kept talking about it as soon as he turned his back on them (because he gave them very pointed looks whenever they did it in front of him). Patients were reading it and speculating with each other.
Draco shook their hands a bit. “Could we go back to the part where you supposedly almost kissed me?”
“Nervous? Why?”
Draco took out his St. Mungo’s badge and slapped it onto the kitchen island. “Protean Charm. I’m sure you are familiar as you already enchanted the Snitch.”
“– the Chosen One?”
“Fine.” Draco coughed up some blood but managed to hold eye contact. He was going to stall as long as possible and hope that Harry would save him. “Kill him. See if I care.”
Draco wanted to laugh. He had done worse things than that today.
“Your
Harry poked his shoulder disapprovingly. “Close your eyes. You’re staring at it like it’s gonna go up in flames any second.”
he could keep track of where what went, but there was obviously a system in place.
“Psh. That’s impossible. You were wearing my backpack.” Potter waved a hand in dismissal and grabbed Draco’s upper arm in the same motion. “Go on then, if you’re so much better than me. Apparate us back.”
“I’ll tell them,” Potter said, grinning broadly.
Harry’s grin widened as he pointed up at the attic. “I’ll go get the chest down here.”

Harry huffed in frustration. “
“You want me to change my clothes in the back alley of some shady dive bar?” Draco asked in disbelief.

Draco finished his spell and took a few steps back to restore her personal space. “Felicity, I have to report it if I suspect that a crime took place.”

nakedness, at least in his eyes. But maybe he was just old-fashioned. It was, of course, possible that Harry was referring to the shepherd’s pie he had made for them. That had indeed been eyebrow-worthy.

Harry’s shield flared up, pushing Chang a few feet away. Her wand clattered to the ground.
should get her eyes checked, if she really thought ‘Adonis’ was hotter than Potter. A Greek god? Draco actually thought he looked a little sickly, definitely too pale next to Potter, who was
“No, it’s not,” he corrected.
“I’m sorry, what? Did you say
“What are you waiting for?” said Harry harshly after a few seconds of silence. “Just do it already.”
“Fine, I’ll do it,” Potter said, pushing his bowl away. “Where’s my wand?”
She leaned in so she could whisper into his ear, “See? Told you you’d know Adonis when you see him.”
for the ‘M’.
Draco went into the sitting room to see Harry get smothered in a three-way hug starring himself and the girls. It certainly looked uncomfortable, because he had to stand hunched over to be able to reach Olivia, and then there was Lauren, practically leaning on his back.
Draco didn’t want to look at Harry’s face now, but at the same time, he
! Come on, anything at all will do. Does he have a weak side? Any notable injuries?”
“Yeah, but we wanted to keep you!” Olivia said like the sweetheart she was.
” Harry demanded to know, an eyebrow raised so high it almost vanished under his still damp mob, which hid his scar quite effectively.
“I’m afraid we could also be looking at a Blood Curse.”
Harry leaned across him to retrieve his wand and Invisibility Cloak from under the pillow, but before he could cast a Lumos, Draco’s hands happened across a long, silky thing near his left foot, and he slung it around Harry’s neck and tied it for him with practised hands.
“Hi,” said Granger pleasantly while Weasley made a face behind her. “Do you mind?”
The other two took the seats right behind them and began whispering excitedly, which caused their voices to rise and fall more than they were probably aware. Draco caught scraps of their conversation here and there.
Harry grabbed Draco’s wrist when he tried to remove the knife set from his shopping trolley. “
“I’m not
“Sex,” said Lauren.
Harry caught sight of Draco and perked up. Seldom had Draco seen him that relieved. Ginger noticed the change as well. She turned around to see what Harry had spotted. That was when Draco recognised her.
Draco took his time showering, but it didn’t help him sorting through his head, and he was still thinking about it when he went back into the bedroom to raid Harry’s closet. He was almost glad when a tap against the window pulled him out of his thoughts.
them to call you?”
He still couldn’t refrain from writing back.
“My Patronus is a falcon!” Draco argued, pulling the sweater over his head even though he was already wearing one.
“He threw a bat at your face?” Draco grinned and turned Harry’s head with two fingers at his jaw to get a better view from another angle.
“Well, I didn’t know you would
If he thought he would get out of it that easily, Harry was sorely mistaken.
Second of all, Harry had stalked Draco so much that Draco definitely had a few free passes left. Maybe

To his mental do-not-date-because-of-reasons list, he added,

“Speaking as a legacy
“Not exactly …” Harry was biting his lip and avoiding his eyes.
“If it’s about my ankle, I think it’s only slightly sprained,” Harry said immediately. “Fucking McCarthy just grabbed me.”
Draco loved the summer holidays. With the students home from school, there were
him? He’s violent and also under arrest. I can’t just unbind him!”
“Er – I guess so, but that was just ...,” he tried to explain, but she cut him off, patting his hand affectionately.
Draco huffed a laugh and quickly tried to mask it as a cough.
Blaise silenced her with a significant look that made her huff. Theo nodded. Draco took a huge bite so he wouldn’t have to say anything.
But as the days went by, he entertained the thought that maybe this was
Draco dashed forward just as Potter lost consciousness, barely catching him before he hit the floor.
. Guess what kind of animal they’ll put on the emblem?”
“As if,” said Draco. “You do know you’ve got a very well documented anger management problem?”
“Just straight ahead. They’ll have to get out of the way IF THEY WANT THEIR HEADS TO REMAIN NORMAL-SIZED!” Harry directed the last part of his sentence at a particularly bothersome witch, who was blocking their path. She was gone in an instant.
Draco rolled his eyes and turned it off with a flick of his wand. Then he sat down next to Aurelius and picked up his mug.
“You’re not allowed in here!” Cuffe was clearly trying to sound resolute, but his voice broke several times.
For the first time since the year had started, Potter actually acted like his former self. His shoulders were squared, and even though he had to look up to every single one of the boys, he still managed to seem self-assured.
“Didn’t you get the DVD for Christmas?” Olivia said in a judgemental tone. And then, thankfully, she stood up to stretch her legs in what was probably a yoga pose.
.” Harry sighed and dragged the hood back over his head.
Draco selected an old and senile witch with a broken hip. She probably wouldn’t even know what year it was, so it seemed safe enough.
“I don’t want you to
“That picture makes it look much worse than it is,” said Harry firmly, not even looking at it. “
And there he went thinking about him again. Calling him Harry. Draco had thought of him as Potter for thirteen years – it shouldn’t be so hard going back to that.
“Alright,” Harry said resolutely. “We’ve got to actually get shit done tonight. No excuses.”
It wasn’t much better inside the treatment room. Three mediwitches were huddled around Harry in his soggy Quidditch robes. One of them was dabbing at a wound on his forehead very, very carefully. Another was trying to disguise stroking his hair as an attempt at keeping it out of the wound. The third seemed rooted to the spot. Draco could see why – Harry was frowning at her with a dopey look on his face.
The first spell shattered it, pushing him back a few feet. The second struck Harry in the chest, knocking him out cold. He collapsed to the floor, unmoving.

“I just want to say that I feel like I kept getting
Draco rolled over onto his stomach and found that his ropes were giving way. He cast them off hastily, got up on his feet, and sprinted forward, hands still touching the ground here and there, as another rope caught Harry around the waist and dragged him towards the briefcase and away from Draco.

Lauren opened the door and promptly dragged him in by the arm.

send an owl an hour ago. Which you straight up ignored. That was rude, by the way,” Blaise said. “And you could’ve changed at home if you had just taken the Floo. So that’s on you, really.”
But Harry didn’t insist on Polyjuice or glamours or his Cloak anymore, and the looks were getting fewer and fewer with every year going by, with every event they attended, looking just as in love as they had been five years ago. Maybe someday those looks would cease completely.
would cause.
” Potter whispered, his speech already slurred by fatigue.
They had printed an old photograph of the D.A. directly underneath. Harry wasn’t hard to find. He was standing front and centre, his mob of hair unmistakeable and his eyes so green they were the most vivid colour on there. Cho Chang was standing a good way down the line, right next to the Edgecombe girl. The idiots at Witch Weekly had actually placed a giant question mark over Chang’s face, making her unrecognisable to anyone who didn’t know about her already. As if people wouldn’t buy that rag either way.
Draco glanced at the girls to see if they’d noticed anything.
Super excited for the next one!
“Alright,” said Nash, leaning over Draco’s notes. “Step one is to make sure your magic is contained.”
They stared at each other for just a moment, and then Draco turned Potter’s face to the side and bore down on the blood smeared across his scar with grim determination.
