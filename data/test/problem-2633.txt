"Mate, I think it's a brilliant idea," announced Ron. "And please believe me when I say that I'm fully aware of how bizarre it is that we're all now in this situation. If you'd told me when I was at school that... well, you get it. But, seriously, I think it would suit Harry perfectly. He's always loved doing stuff for his friends and family, and he's

"Father has donated a bag of cakes to our excursion; I suspect that's his way of trying to make you trust us," said Draco, ruthlessly shoving his galloping thoughts to the back of his mind. "I think there's even a Christmas pudding in there."
"That was thoughtful of you. They'll really appreciate it."
aim, but it's not surprising that it didn't work out, now that I think about it, because of course the aim I was following no longer existed. And I don't think I've found another one."
"I take my job as your deputy very seriously," Ron told him. "It's part of my job description to cover for you when you're unavailable. Doesn't mean I can't make the most of opportunities to make you blush."
He Disapparated, and Harry pulled Draco round and kissed him.
can, Mister Multiple Prodigy."
Draco obliged, shivering but also incredibly turned on. When he was down to his underwear, Harry stood up and kissed him.
"Oh, I'm sorry – didn't I leave copies of them with the lesson plans? I thought I had," said Harry, frowning.
Draco looked as if he was about to cry. "Maybe a different sort of overwhelmed. A good sort," he said. "Thank you. That means a lot to me."
"Right," said Harry, as they sipped their coffee at breakfast the next day, "I think I've got it mostly sorted out in my head now, but can we sit down and iron out the final details, please? I want to be as prepared as I possibly can be before tomorrow."
lucky – lucky that they’re all stupid enough to go shopping on a Saturday afternoon," said Hermione, who’d rejoined them as Ron was speaking. "I can’t think of a more unpleasant time to go shopping."
"There were certain musical genres that had to be included, but apart from that it was a free choice," Draco said. "Actually, choosing which songs to do was almost as hard as singing them. But I must say I really enjoyed the decision process."
"I haven't, although they
Draco glared at him. "I’m sure you’ve heard all the counter-arguments to
"Well, I know that James only ever wanted to be a Chaser. Neither he nor Al has ever seen their dad playing Seeker in a proper game, though – I think he did play a few times in Auror staff tournaments, but nothing else. But they all used to go and watch their mum playing Chaser for the Harpies. Al and I both tried out for Seeker, but that was mainly because of our size rather than because of you and him. We were surprised when we got picked as Beaters, but it's been a lot more fun than we thought it would be. Croft leaves at the end of this year, so we'll have to have a new Seeker next September, but I'm not sure whether either of us will go for it."
"I think you get the gist," said Hermione hurriedly, waving her wand again. "But the most important thing is that you don't need to take our word for it - Draco is going to sing for you right now."
"Well, Harry, I don't know how long he's been there, but isn't it obvious why?"
point of a marriage, but they're a pretty good thing to show for it, don't you think?"
"Erm," said Harry, "this is the tent. In front of the tent is where we will sit to look at the sky later. (The chairs are inside the tent for the moment – I put them there in case it rained.) Everywhere else is the toilet, but it's more pleasant for all concerned if we go a decent distance from the tent before using it."
"Well, I was in Russia for a while..." began Draco.
Within a few minutes, both wrist and ankle were bandaged and a painkilling injection had been administered, and the paramedics started to carefully manoeuvre Granger onto a stretcher. This seemed to rouse her slightly, and she began talking urgently to the paramedics, who looked at each other helplessly.
Draco appeared to be lost for words, so Harry squeezed his hand and said to her, "Just do anything you can that will help Draco care for his parents. That's all we ask."
"Not all
"Come on, then," said Harry, jumping up and leading Draco into the bedroom.
"I like the way you're thinking," said Harry solemnly. "But I do feel we need to explore all the options first, so we can agree which rewards will work best. For example, I've fucked you, and I can confirm that that reward will work

James looked round as Harry reached him, and his face broke into an uncharacteristically wide grin. He jumped up from the bench and flung his arms round his father. "It's great to see you back," he said, looking up at him.

"That was just last night," Harry clarified. "We should probably also count the one in the shower this morning. And the one in the toilets at work this lunchtime."
"Ah. Sixth year, then?"
Draco, however, wasn't currently thinking about food, but about the way his whole body had seemed to wake up and pay attention when Harry had taken hold of his hand. The contact had lasted only a few seconds, until they were back inside the house, and neither of them had commented on it; when they stepped through the door, Harry had simply let go, but he'd looked back at Draco and smiled.
"What have they asked you to say?" asked Harry.
Ron was already at his desk when Harry entered their office. "Morning, mate," he said. "How's it going?"
"Well, I do," said Harry firmly. "Ask Ron if you don't believe me. He not only worked out that I was planning to offer to share with you, he also told me that the main reason was that I've always been fascinated with you. And he was right, even though I hadn't even realised that
"Don't I? ... I suppose I don't. Didn't think you'd noticed, though."
be upset if she wanted to share a room with her sister, but of course I told her I'd be fine. I need to make sure I spend time with her this year, though. She and Lavender were very close, and I keep expecting to see the two of them together – it must be much worse for her. And for you, Ron, of course."
, and I started thinking that that was a bit like me, and then I thought how amazing it was that I was even having thoughts about classical music, and that a year ago I didn't even really know what classical music was, and now I know all sorts of random stuff about it, thanks to you. Even though I can't actually, you know,
"Two reasons," said Draco, putting down his quill and turning round. "Firstly, these plans are alphabetical, which means that I find it much quicker to learn the kids' names. Secondly, I find that if the first thing I do is to uproot them all and make them sit where I tell them, it helps me to establish control."
"I don't understand why that would make them hate you, though," said Hermione, puzzled.

a scary thought," he said. "To this day, she remains the only person who has ever punched me in the face. Not an experience I care to repeat. But you needn't worry: I have no intention of hurting Harry. The attraction goes both ways."
"So am I," gasped Draco. "Don't stop. Don't stop."
Lucius stood up and went to the oven to retrieve the apple crumble dish. "We could give him those sweets too, Narcissa," he called. "Can you get them? They're at the back of the cupboard."
An excited murmur arose, and Harry lifted his hand to stop it. "We will be taking questions afterwards, if there are any," he told the reporters. "I'm sure there'll be some about this device, at least - and I'm grateful to Hermione for helping us find a way to get Muggle electronic devices to work inside Hogwarts." He fished Draco's phone and Bluetooth speaker out of his pocket and passed them to Hermione, who started fiddling.
"You have a

"It's fine, don't worry," said Ginny. "Dean and I haven't had him for ages, it'll be fun. And it's not your fault they've suddenly decided to call you all in for a raid. Ron's quite excited, by the way."
Neville smiled fondly at them both. "Well, I think it's great," he said. "Now, I'd better leave you to it before your breakfast actually goes cold. See you at the match?"
"... worth waiting for," panted Harry. "Let's not wait too long before doing it again."
The next moment, though, all thoughts of winking cats – or even non-winking cats, or in fact anything at all – had left his head entirely, because the person who appeared in the doorway at that point was someone that Harry hadn't seen in five years, but had thought about many times in that period.
"Presumably there must still be paperwork at the shop, though?"
"Who do?"
"Yes, please," said Teddy. "Don't look at me like that, Harry. I'm a growing boy. I always have room for good food."
Harry smiled at him tenderly. "Well, it's not the last night
"Bacon time," said Lucius, who was at the stove tending to a frying pan. "Also known as half past eleven, on this occasion. You slept for twelve hours – you must have needed it."
"Well, I suppose I'm at least partially to blame," said Harry. "Because I obviously knew
Harry opened his mouth to speak, but Narcissa beat him to it. "Please, let's not talk about the past, Draco," she said. "We said and did so many things that we sincerely regret, but now we are different people. And we're all getting along so well – let's not spoil it."
"But you want to, right? ... Don't look at me like that! You've been on your own for a long time, and this is

Deciding that there was nothing to be gained by putting it off, he crossed the square, climbed the few steps to the door of Number Twelve, and then grabbed the railing in a panic as he lost his footing on the icy top step. He managed to steady himself just in time, and smiled ruefully at the thought of replicating Hermione's accident.

I didn't believe it for ages, but I finally went and looked it up in the library and found it was true.

"Old age! My word, Draco, the two of you are only thirty-nine years old. Just wait until you're eighty-three like me.

It's almost a pity that you won't see each other at all while you're covering his classes."

"You're right," said Draco, surprised. "I was so focused on Hermione that the enormity of what I was doing didn't occur to me. But that doesn't mean that I'd feel comfortable going to Diagon Alley. Or to Hogwarts, for that matter."
"As long as there's food, Professor, we can be patient all day," said Ron.
"Please, Professor," said Parvati, after sharing a nod with Hermione. "The girls have all agreed already, if you're happy to go along with what we've sorted out?"
"Amazing," said Harry. "Fabulous. Incredible. Fantastic. All those sorts of words. But that's not because it was sex. It's because it was with

Draco took his hand and started stroking it. "There'll be a next time, then?" he asked, without looking up. "I was hoping there would, but I'd understand if you just wanted a one-off to get it out of your system."
needs a bit more sleep than the seventeen-year-old me, and I'm shattered. How about you? Are you tired?"
"Mr Potter, I am delighted to see you," said McGonagall, as they stood back from each other. "And you too, of course, Mr Weasley and Miss Granger. I am sorry that the three of you had an uncomfortable experience on the train, but I suppose we should probably have foreseen it. My apologies for that."
"Will you let me be the judge of that?" said Harry. "Go on – what was it?"
"Goes with your eyes," he explained, smiling. "OK, let’s go. Although if this turns out to be yet another of those things you’re just naturally brilliant at, I may go back to hating you just a little bit, FYI. It took me a long time to recover from witnessing your first ever time on a broom, damn you."
"Quarter to six," said Draco. "I haven't told you how I got the message to James, have I?" He grinned.
"Huh?" said Draco, lifting his gaze to meet Harry's; it looked, to Harry's secret delight, as if Draco had been mesmerised by Harry's bare chest.  "Oh... Sure. Don't worry. You've already helped a lot, actually, by letting me whinge at you."
Harry scrambled up from his chair, on which he'd been sitting backwards so he could rest his chin on his arms. He engulfed Draco in a tight hug and kissed him, before going over to the piano to shake Rabia's hand.
Prompt: 3: Hogwarts in the snow
"No idea, actually," said Draco. "I just know they suck them. I was thinking about them while I was sucking your cock."
"Fine," said Draco, resigned. "What's his bloody address?"
"Well, in the middle," said Draco. "I told you, I've never shared it with anyone before. And it's not as if we can sleep separately anyway. The more important question is: do you want to be the big spoon or the little spoon?"
Harry’s eyes shot open, but he relaxed as he saw Draco’s grin. "Maybe I wouldn’t mind," he found himself murmuring. The last thing he saw before he closed his eyes again was the expression of surprise on Draco’s face.
Arthur Weasley was sitting at the kitchen table when they got there; he was eating a mince pie, and the amount of crumbs on his plate suggested that there had been considerably more than one. He smiled at Harry and Draco but continued eating. Molly Weasley was standing at the stove stirring something; but after a few seconds she left it to stir itself and came over to the table, which was covered with a ridiculous amount of food given that it was quite late in the evening. There were two turkeys and three Christmas cakes, plus many dishes of vegetables and a gravy boat. Molly waved her wand, and the plates obediently rearranged themselves so that there was room for her to add two empty plates.
Draco talks about a life-changing song.
strange-looking Father Christmas," commented Draco, looking up to the roof of the Town Hall.
"I know, and I think subconsciously that's why I wanted to come back, even though I didn't have any reason to believe you might feel this way. But I wasn't thinking that at the time. I just knew I wanted to come back to England, but as soon as I arrived I remembered how people had treated me, and it seemed easier to just keep myself hidden."
Draco thought about this. "Yes and no," he said. "I
"Hot chocolate sounds good," Draco agreed. He unzipped the front of the tent and looked inside. There were two folding chairs immediately inside the doorway, which he pulled out and passed to Harry; the only other things in the tent were a sleeping bag and pillow to one side, a rucksack at the far end, and a couple of plastic carrier bags near the front.

At that very moment, there was a knock on the door, and Draco went to open it.
Harry laughed, but hugged back happily. "It's great to

"Well, you can't, can you?" Draco pointed out, smiling wryly. "You'd be screaming in pain within a minute. Although... I'm grateful that you don't seem as freaked out as I thought you might. Look... now that I think about it, it's probably not the best idea to discuss our long-term plans while we still don't have any choice about being together."
"And it would be a pity to mess up your outfit," Draco pointed out. "You look pretty hot in that. The waistcoat is really doing it for me." (Harry, after much thought and consultation, had opted for a dark grey three-piece suit with a black shirt.)

'. But I remember feeling awful when I found out, years later, about how things had been with your relatives."
Albus flushed slightly. "I know," he said apologetically. "I thought it'd be easier just to tell you when you got here."
Draco, who had been turning to go back to the kitchen, whipped his head round to look at Harry, who laughed.
"I'm sorry," said Draco. "For the length of the drive
"I do," said Draco, grinning. "I'd assumed this was the case, but hadn't realised it'd be quite this bad."
Draco looked expectantly at Harry, who blushed and opened his mouth to speak but then closed it again. Then: "Oh, what the hell," muttered Harry, and then his lips were touching Draco's.
"Draco," Harry reminded him.
Harry turned onto the bridge, singing along with Debbie Harry when it got to "picture this, a day in December; picture this, freezing cold weather" (he found he didn't know any of the other words, so had to settle for a da-da-da approach), but when he got to the middle of the bridge he stopped suddenly. There was an old-fashioned red phone box which he didn't remember being there the last time he'd been this way, and - even more surprisingly - there seemed to be a snowman inside it.
"It is," said Draco. "You don't have to come, by the way, if you were just being polite."
"Thank you, Ron," said Harry. "Now can we go back to sleep? I promise we'll come and see you later, and you can quiz us all you like then."
Finally, Draco sings!
Ron emitted a sort of strangled sound, but bent to do as his wife suggested. "I don't think that'll be a problem," Harry admitted. "Just the thought of his face is…"

“That was amazing, mate,” said Ron, who was also quite tearful. “I was only going to this thing tomorrow to be supportive, but I’m actually looking forward to it now, if it’s all going to be as good as that. And… I see it now. You and Harry, I mean.”
for the event. Which reminds me: good afternoon, Mr Malfoy. It is good to see you again after all this time. Mr Potter here has been telling me how much you have helped him recently."
"Starving, actually," said Draco. "I had lunch before I left Sorrento, but I didn't leave the Portkey office in Naples because I didn't want to miss my departure slot."
Intrigued, Harry examined the phone box. The door wouldn't open, suggesting that it wasn't a normal phone box; he couldn't tell whether or not the snowman was real (it
"Me neither," whispered Harry. For a moment he wished he'd kept hold of Draco's hand, but they'd agreed it would look more professional to just walk in side by side. They were certainly causing a stir, if the stares and open mouths were anything to go by, but he couldn't decide whether or not it was a
"No, it's fine," said Draco. He called Woopy, and a few minutes later they were both sipping their drinks.
"I do have one more task," she said. "Not many of you know this, but Draco is an excellent singer, and he's sung many songs to Harry since they've been together. But, Draco, Harry has a surprise for you. He's been practising for weeks, and now he would like to sing a song to
(Ron and Hermione had offered, the previous year, to cook Harry a pre-Christmas Christmas dinner, since they would be having their actual Christmas dinner at The Burrow as usual, but Harry could no longer go there. It had been a very happy occasion in a year which had been very difficult for Harry, and the three of them had vowed to make it an annual tradition. That first time they'd done it on Christmas Eve, but Ron had requested that it be earlier in future so that he could make the most of the available food without being sick. Hermione had been particularly amused at the thought that even Ron couldn't cope with two full Christmas dinners on consecutive days.)

in any of Mr... Professor Potter's lessons."
Draco turned to look at him, and there were tears in his eyes. "I feel like I'm dreaming," he said. "You're being so nice to me, and I'm not sure I deserve it."
"Draco, what on
Draco laughed delightedly. "He was gay, you know," he said. "He's probably watching us proudly. And jealously, actually – he couldn't be open about it when he was alive."

it was to go to a Muggle destination, so I was able to concentrate. I spent a few weeks getting used to just being there: I'd just go through the gateway in the Leaky Cauldron into Charing Cross Road, and then spend all day just wandering and observing. I changed lots of my money into Muggle money at Gringotts, and after a while I got brave enough to spend it. The first thing I bought was a cup of coffee from a vending machine – it was disgusting, but I felt safer interacting with a machine before I tried it with a human. I was so proud of myself that I immediately went and bought a better cup of coffee from a street stall, and

Finally getting to hold Harry was the best feeling Draco thought he'd ever experienced; at least, he couldn't think of anything else he'd enjoyed more. He decided that if this was as far as he ever got with Harry, he'd be fine with that: how could anything be better than this? He would quite happily have stood there for days, but then he felt wetness on his skin: Harry was crying silently.
Five minutes later, though, Harry found himself back in the garden behind Draco Malfoy's house, freshly Disillusioned and peering through the French windows. He hadn't worked out anything at all, other than that he wanted to see Draco again and find out what was going on. He was relieved to see that Draco was back in his armchair, surrounded by candles; this time he was just reading, but with the cat again sprawled across his chest.
Harry laughed so much at this he spilled his wine.
It seemed like hours later when Harry finally lifted his head and fixed red-rimmed eyes on Draco. "Thank you," he said, a little hoarsely. "I think that was just what I needed. I feel totally pathetic, though – I'm not even sure why I'm crying."
"I don't think you were
seen," Draco informed Harry. "I think I must be still asleep and dreaming."
"Of course," Draco agreed. "And thank you. It would be quite a big deal for me to return. I'm not saying I never will, but I'd never expected to before now, so it'll take me a while to get my head round it all."
– sorry it's moving so slowly!
"Aren’t you the boss? You should get your minions to do more," said Draco, moving to join Harry at the window.
"Ah, I was wondering about those glittery bells on the door," Harry said. "They don't seem very you. But do you get any other visitors?"
"I'm sorry about that," said Harry, resting his chin on Draco's chest so he could meet his gaze. "I think I was just freaked out at the idea of people knowing before I'd thought about how to tell them. I've got a bit paranoid about that over the years; people do seem to insist on talking about me, but it's been a bit easier to deal with since I started pre-empting anything I knew there'd be rumours about, by making announcements myself."
"Can I offer anyone another helping of apple crumble?" said Lucius.
"That's thoughtful of you," said Harry. "I wonder if she's spoken to the press already? She may well have done. Anyway, I bet I can guess what their first question will be to us."
"It’s fine by me if you do. I promise not to take advantage of you."
smiling, but found that his mouth instantly returned to its grin.
"Ah... not as such, no. I haven't had a chance to mention it to him yet. But it won't be a problem, I assure you. Since he's requested to take a holiday in termtime, he can hardly complain about what the school has to do in order to cover his timetable. It's very lucky that the Beauxbatons term starts so late in September, and you can help us out before you go back to France. I don't know of anyone else with your experience who would have been available at such short notice."
"This actually makes sense now," he said, shaking his head. "I used to think you seemed a bit dim when we were at school, but after quite a long time I realised that you were actually very intelligent, you were just not always great at noticing things."
Draco laughed hollowly. "They're better than

really wanted to know."
After a few words of welcome, Harry explained the structure of the evening, and then introduced Rabia, who grinned at everyone before taking her seat at the piano and creating an instantly magical atmosphere with Debussy’s “Clair de Lune”. She entranced the audience for the next twenty minutes, before finishing with a thunderous Rachmaninov prelude, resulting in equally thunderous applause.

They fell onto the bed still kissing, causing an outraged "MIAOW!" from Kilgharrah, who had been sleeping there. She ran out of the room in disgust, but for once Draco paid her no attention.
"So," said Harry as they sat back down at the kitchen table, "the Manor seems to have disappeared."
"They're not Christmas decorations, they're chocolates," said Hermione. "Hershey's Christmas Kisses, they're called. They're American – I've heard of them, but never seen them in England before. But Hamleys had a special display of American chocolate, so I thought I'd get some for you to try."
Molly beamed at him. "Well, that's a lovely thing to say," she said. "I look forward to getting to know you. I know there's been bad blood between our families in the past, but I'd like to think we've all moved on from that. Ron's told me on several occasions how impressed he's been with you at work."
"He was, for a while," said Hermione. "But he quit a couple of years ago, about the same time as he decided he'd had enough of the wizarding world. He lives here in Cricklewood now, and we're the only wizards he still sees."

Unlike whoever lived in the house, the cat seemed to want attention; it came over and licked Harry's hand, and then stalked round the side of the house. Harry followed it across the snow-covered grass, aware both that his heart was beating unusually quickly and that he wasn't sure why. As he turned the corner, he was surprised to see that the back door of the house was slightly ajar. The cat stopped at the door and looked back at Harry one last time, then slipped inside.
"First course. Cream of mushroom," he said. "I haven't made it from scratch, sorry, but it's a good brand. And I
"She didn't," said Harry. "At least, not last night. I fell asleep in the armchair and woke this morning to find the house still empty. I thought that she must have gone straight from work to the camp – there was no reason she had to come home, of course. So I made some breakfast and planned to get a Portkey to the camp later and surprise her there. But she turned up while I was eating."
At three minutes past nine the following morning, Harry was sitting in his office yawning when his assistant knocked on the open door.
"There's nothing silly about it – it's perfectly natural," said Hermione. "But if Draco manages to bring us closer together again, that's just a bonus. He's obviously already made you happier."

"It’s very handy, keeping an owl in your office," commented Harry. "I must try that. Usually I just send Helen to the owlery."
“Oh, it’s fine,” said Draco. “I’ve been thinking for a while that it would be nice to share it with Rabia. She’s one of our best friends and we know we can trust her. And I was about to say, Rabia, that the bit Harry hasn’t told you yet is that he’s pretty much the most powerful wizard in the world at the moment, so he can do magic without a wand that most of the rest of us can’t always do

He'd just found the last object – "Abacus! There you are!" when there was a disturbance in the air and Harry landed, stumbling, in the middle of the room. Draco leapt up to steady him.
"'M not asleep," croaked Draco. Then he sat bolt upright, looking horrified. "I'm not asleep," he croaked again, "and WHY AM I CROAKING?"
"Not yet," said Harry. "I've not been with anyone serious since then. Just a few flings here and there, but none of them were really what I was looking for." He paused. "I
"No one's been lying to you," said Harry. "Before Saturday, I hadn't seen him since the war. And, on the one hand, I don't really understand it myself, and on the other it feels like the most natural thing in the world. We... seem to have a connection."
"Well, I'd love to do it again one day, and I hope I get the chance," Draco said. "But that night was one of the best nights of my life, and afterwards I went to the pub with a load of the other singers from my year, and we ended up doing karaoke."
"I'd love to say that they'd do it for anyone," said Lyudmila, "but I have to admit that what's prompted this is mainly Mr Potter's involvement. From the management's point of view, at least. They're desperate for good publicity, and they were very embarrassed by the fuss he made on Saturday. No-one wants to be seen to be upsetting Harry Potter."
Harry instantly pulled the towel from his face and whirled round. An intense blush quickly covered his face, and Draco was intrigued to notice that it actually spread to his neck and shoulders.
Only a week and a half behind! Sorry for the further delay – but I promise I
"I carried a watermelon," said Draco's mouth, with very little input from his brain; this made him laugh even more.
Harry checked his alarm charm was still active, and then jumped back into bed. He was asleep seconds later.
Harry started to explain, but Draco interrupted. "That was because of me – sorry," he said. "The finale was a big deal to me, and I wanted to be able to just... well,
"Pretty much," said Hermione. "I don't think they'll ever totally forgive me for doing it, but they do understand why I did, and we've moved on. I don't see them as often as I'd like to, but that's because of lack of time rather than any awkwardness. Actually, I'd love to introduce you to them. I'll see if they can come to your next concert."
"Um... I didn't, until a few days ago," said Draco. "But, just to be clear, I do follow the Muggle news. It's just the wizarding world I didn't want to know about. I figured that if anything was important enough, someone would tell me. My parents do, occasionally - they still get the
"Thanks, Helen," said Harry.
to tell me," she said. "I'm intrigued."
"You're right, though – we should have tried," said Lucius. "I hope you'll let us make up for it now."
"We did, but I’ve hardly seen him since the war," said Draco. "He and his mother went to live in Italy as soon as they found out they hadn’t been charged with any war crimes, and I was a bit unimpressed that he didn’t contact me to see how my trial went. So I didn’t contact him either, and it all was a bit awkward the next time I saw him, at some event or other, especially as we didn’t really get a chance to talk properly. But then a few months later we bumped into each other again, and cleared the air. And every time I’ve seen him since it’s been fine, even though that’s been less and less frequent."
"Alright," said Draco, although he felt anything but. He shivered slightly at the familiar egg-breaking-on-the-head sensation of the Disillusionment charm, and then walked into the chippy behind his new friends.
“Correct - this is already the biggest room, but it’s also the only one with a piano. And you know there are tuning issues involved with moving pianos, so we couldn’t move it in time anyway.”
"Let's talk about something totally unrelated to any of this," said Hermione suddenly, after the four of them had walked in silence for ten minutes. "Draco, I've been meaning to ask you for ages: that night when I had my accident, and you found me... what were you doing in the area? I'm curious."
“This is the best part–you saw each other and started talking. Then you realized how drunk Harry was and didn’t want him to splinch himself, so you side-alonged him back to yours.”
When they first arrived, Draco peeked around Grimmauld Place with newfound interest. He’d only been a couple times in his youth, but he remembered its previous state of grime and draftiness like it was yesterday. Most of all, he was happy that his Great Aunt Walburga had finally been removed from her place in the front entryway. He remembered her bellowing and shuddered.
With Harry distracted, Draco took the opportunity to flee from the Black family ancestral home. The front door slammed closed as Hermione practically ran from the sitting room and into the kitchen.
,” Hermione replied, always the optimist.
!” Harry had always done a poor job of hiding his surprise. How was he supposed to go a month without mortally embarrassing himself? He figured that his older self had already had this conversation with Draco, but, currently, Harry had too much pride and was far too stubborn to let Draco figure out about his stupid schoolboy crush.
,” he muttered, squeezing his eyes shut and praying that he hadn’t picked up another muggle from the bar he frequented too often for Hermione’s liking. Harry was trying to cut down on the drinking, he really was, but yesterday was October 31st and all his friends were busy moving on with their lives, and Harry couldn’t help but feel sorry for himself.
“Have not!”
“I’ll spare you the boring details Potter, I know you weren’t any good in Potions.”
Ten minutes later, Draco was alone outside the chippy. Ron and Hermione had gone home, but not without hugs (from both of them) and wishes of good luck. He had removed his Disillusionment charm, and all that remained was to summon the nerve to walk into the chippy and look Harry in the face. He'd decided that he'd wait until there were no other customers, if possible.
How come?" asked Potter.
"Give me a little more credit," Harry told him. "I have a plan! And I think it will work. But I'd just like to remind you that I'm very used to being stared at and, although it's not always pleasant, I find I can ignore it after a while. They soon get bored and move on. As for your more nightmarish scenarios, I'm pretty confident that nobody will dare to do any of those things if I'm standing right next to you. And, who knows - maybe they might not even want to anyway!"
"No – where would they have been?" asked Harry.
*******
Draco's grin widened, but he didn't remove the candy cane. "Warning noted," he said. "So, did you stop after two wanks last night, or...?"
I still want to hear what you were going to tell me about Merlin. And you haven't told me
"I've never had a candy cane, have you?" Draco said, some minutes later.
can have happened in just two days."
"I'll race you," said Harry to Ron, rapidly scanning the report he'd just finished writing. He'd tried especially hard to make this one legible; maybe, for once, the secretaries wouldn't glare at him. "Last one there buys the first round."
"No pressure or anything," commented Draco wryly. "Right, it's a date. Tomorrow is the first day of the rest of your life. Operation New Harry will commence. But tonight, I really want to just lie here in your arms and stare at the pretty flames. I've decided it's my new favourite feeling."
Harry raised his eyebrows, but then shrugged and followed Oliver out of the office and into a nearby room filled with leather armchairs and old-looking wooden tables. An open fire was roaring away cheerfully in the fireplace, and in an armchair next to the fire was....
Draco looked a bit startled at this inclusion, and Harry smiled gratefully at Molly. "We're fine, thank you," he told her. "Just tired. But I promised I'd come and update Ron."
"I've never heard you talk about your parents before," said Draco, "but I know things were strained for a while after you had to modify their memories in the war - is everything OK now?"
Draco opened his mouth to speak, but Oliver held up his hand. "I'm sure Draco will answer that later, but I'm as keen for this to start on time as you are. So, briefly, the Ministry realised after the Sydney event that there's a large category of voters that they need to engage, particularly as many of them are very well off. The feeling is that they will pay more attention to Draco than to you."
, and I hate it. That's my favourite moment of the whole piece if it's done properly, so it ruins it for me if the conductor is power-mad and decides he doesn't want an audience to think for itself."
"Well, yes and no. I still work for the Aurors, but I'm not an active one any more – I lead the training these days. That's mostly in London, of course, but, y'know, fireplaces and Apparition and such – I don't have to live there. What about you? What do you do these days?"
always lovely. But first I need to get through this afternoon's lessons, and then I need to work out what I'm going to say when I owl Draco."
"Hi," said Draco. Hermione jumped.
Harry raised his eyebrows. "I'd forgotten I saw you using a phone yesterday," he said. "I never thought I'd see you embracing Muggle technology."
Harry's heart sank, and Hermione winced. "It was actually worse at King's Cross than on the train," said Ron. "At least we could shut the door on them when we were in our carriage. At the station, we could hardly move for people surrounding us."
not stupid," said Draco, turning his head to look at Harry. "But I promise I'll tell you if I can see any problems with it, and I'll help you find a way round them, if you want me to. So, go on. What's the idea?"
"What...? Oh, no! Draco, that's not what I meant. You think I want to keep all this a secret, don't you? But why would I? We haven't done anything wrong. And no, before you ask, I am not ashamed to be seen with you," said Harry. "I just meant that we don't want them to poke their noses into things that are none of their business, so we should plan exactly what we will allow them to know, and then refuse to answer any more questions. Look, I hate the fact that I'm used to dealing with the press, but it's definitely got easier since I realised that was the way to do it. And my main concern right now is that I want to be sure that your parents don't get brought into it."
Three days later, Draco was much more relaxed. He'd met all his classes at least once by then, and there had been no further problems. The Gryffindor/Slytherin half of the third year had been the most attentive of all the groups, and if this was due to the influence of Albus and Scorpius then Draco certainly wasn't complaining. Even the Ravenclaw/Hufflepuff half of the year, when they'd turned up for their second DADA lesson of the week that morning, had behaved acceptably.
Draco responded by scooping up the last of his whipped cream and tipping his head back to drop it in his mouth. As he licked his finger clean, he was interested to note that Harry seemed to be following his every movement with his eyes.
"I've just realised that I may have caused a problem earlier," Draco admitted. "When I Apparated to fetch Weasley, I came out here so no one would see me, but when I came to
a few spaces in some of the rooms, of course, because some students didn't survive the war, but we felt that it would be too upsetting to rearrange the remaining students just to free up some more rooms. So we've opened up the guest rooms along the cloisters. They each have two beds, and that gives us just enough space to accommodate the eighth-years."
"My apologies for keeping you all waiting so long," said McGonagall. "Thank you for your patience. Now, as I explained earlier, we have ten rooms awaiting you in the cloisters, so all that remains is to agree on who's sharing with whom."
Thinking of his job, he realised that Harry probably wouldn't know what he'd been doing for the past few years; although they'd talked at the press conference, it was mainly small talk about the food and the other people in the room. Draco had been a bit hesitant to bring up the past (even the more recent past, which was relatively pleasant) and he was unsure whether Harry was too. They certainly hadn't talked about Harry's job either; Draco was only aware that he was the Hogwarts flying instructor because Oliver Wood had told him.
"No, he met Albus on the train, but they only introduced themselves by their first names," said Draco, who had worried about the very same thing when Scorpius had first mentioned his new friend. "They only found out each other's surnames when they were being Sorted, and Scorpius said they were both a bit taken aback, but they already felt like friends by then, and when they both ended up in Slytherin that just reinforced it. He admitted to Albus that first day how much he'd always idolised you, but Albus apparently just laughed and said that it was fine as long as he didn't start sending you love letters."
Lucius smiled widely at this news. "I am very pleased to hear that," he said. "Now, sit down. Full English breakfast coming right up. Here's coffee and toast to keep you going in the meantime. Now, tell us everything. What did you do last night?"
apologies you owe Draco."
Harry laughed out loud. "That's brilliant!" he said. "Ooh, look, there's Hamleys. I haven't been in there for ages. I'd forgotten about it till Hermione mentioned it. Pity it's shut. Anyway, which TV programme?"
used to it - when I spend any amount of time in the company of other people, they invariably end up irritating me for the tiniest of reasons. Anyway, you said yourself that you're sometimes not in the mood to interact with anyone. I just have that mood most of the time."
"If I don't stop now, you'll
"Of course I trust you, you idiot," said Harry. "I'd hardly be asking you to go and spend my money for me if I didn't, would I? That's sorted, then. What else do we need to do before this can happen?"
"Ginny!" shouted Teddy, and jumped into her arms. "I like you. Harry's boring. Where are we going?"
"No."
"There's a first time for everything," said Draco. "I'll make it a bit less awkward for you, though, because I'm going to bed
"You really suit each other," explained Ron, at Draco's slightly puzzled look. "And I think everyone will recognise that. Come on, let's find out."
"If Harry can cheer for both sides, I don't see why I can't as well," Draco replied, amused.
"So you don't spend much time with wizards, then?" asked Harry. "How come?"
Albus and Scorpius smiled at him, but Lily looked on the verge of tears. "It was a bit of a nightmare when the paper first arrived, to be honest, but people got bored of asking questions when we kept refusing to answer," said Albus. "The
Harry was looking at him with admiration. "It's all starting to make sense now," he said. "So when did you actually move in? And why
"Follow me," said Draco, heading down a side street. When they reached the square, Harry stopped and stared.
Draco nodded, and a few minutes later they were both in Ron’s living room, with Harry, as usual, trying to brush soot from his sleeves. The room was tastefully decorated: the lights on a small Christmas tree glowed in a corner, and there was tinsel artfully draped around the edges of the room. In an alcove, four candles illuminated a wall with a few Christmas cards affixed to it.
Harry closed his eyes and then opened them again. "So, you're saying... we're bonded? You and me?
"Won't be a minute," said Potter, before jogging up the stairs and out of sight.
"You probably should, though," said Draco. "I am so sorry. It never even occurred to me that her torture of you would have lasting damage. I wish I
thought occurred to him, he knew he was going to go along with it. There was, of course, a brief argument in his head, between Sensible Ex-Auror Harry (who knew that it was entirely possible that this was not an ordinary cat and harm might come to him if he let it direct him) and Impulsive Ex-Hero Harry (who was too intrigued by the idea to care), but one of the reasons that Harry was an Ex-Auror rather than an Auror was that Impulsive Ex-Hero Harry won far more internal arguments.
So Harry had been disappointed that he wouldn't be spending the afternoon snuggling with Draco in the cinema, and had slumped in front of the TV, until Draco suggested he could go out for a walk ("while you still can, before it starts to snow - the temperature's just right today"). Harry had grumbled but couldn't think of a good enough reason not to, and now he was glad he'd done it. He'd got the tube to Charing Cross and wandered over to Trafalgar Square - he liked the idea of seeing Nelson's statue before seeing the film set in his lifetime - before crossing the river to the South Bank Centre, and then wandering along the aforementioned south bank of the river, past the London Eye towards Westminster Bridge.
"Lux circuitum," said Harry, and a white glow surrounded them. "That's a definite yes, by the way – but I'd like to return the favour too, and I want to be able to see you."
"Well, Andromeda saw an advert that said that Harrods was opening a Department of Surprise & Delight for December, and that there would be 'unexpected moments of magic for all the family to enjoy'. Sounded nice enough for a four-year-old, so I agreed to bring him. But it turns out that their main 'moment of magic' involves face-painting, and that's a bit of a waste of time for a Metamorphmagus... Teddy kept asking what the point was, when he could just do it himself with no paint. Even so, I thought he might quite like it if he actually tried it, so I volunteered to have mine done first to encourage him... but he still refused."
Harry grinned. "Ron and Hermione are really bad at that," he commented. "Well, Ron is. I think Hermione does sometimes realise how silly it is."
been out of the country quite a few times, because my parents live in Spain now, and I visit them occasionally. But I live in London. I just don't go out in the wizarding world."
"Harry, please don't cry," said Draco, and Harry was startled to find that tears were indeed rolling down his cheeks. "I've already caused you enough problems today. I don't want to depress you as well. Anyway, it's not as bad as it sounds, really. I'm used to it. The last few days have just been harder than usual, and that's why I was in the pub."
"I think she
“No, especially not on Christmas Eve for a non-Christmas programme, but it looks like we were wrong. And it’s mostly people I’ve never seen before, and some of them are dressed quite strangely. But I’m pretty sure most of them are here to see Draco, from the bits of conversation I’ve overheard. He tells me you did some publicising? Well, whatever it was, it worked!”
"Go on then." Harry watched as Hermione scribbled rapidly on a bit of parchment, which she then took over to the window to attach to an owl who was perched nearby.
paperwork – I do spend most of my time actually teaching kids, and I love that. So it's definitely better than being Head Auror."
"I never used to be able to do a Patronus," Draco said. "I tried and tried when I was at school, but I could never even get any smoke to appear."
"I feel… normal, I think," said Harry, considering this. "No pain, anyway. I feel very tired, I suppose, but that’s no different from usual."
I don't know the proper words – is it a standard?"
one possibility," said Draco thoughtfully. "I could go shopping
"Sadly, I don't trust myself not to get carried away if I do this properly right now," he said. "But I always think it's good to leave people wanting more, don't you?" He took hold of Harry's head with both hands, and kissed him firmly but briefly on the lips, before Apparating away.
At that moment, there was a bright flash behind him, and Draco turned to see a streak of light flying into the room, which then resolved itself into a bright silver stag. It stopped right in front of Draco and said, in Harry's voice, "Listen, I know I promised to owl you, but I've been trying to write a letter to you for the last hour and I keep writing gibberish and throwing the paper away. I'm not even sure what I want to say, which is probably the reason for the gibberish, but I do know that I enjoyed spending time with you yesterday and I'd like to see you again. Erm... I don't suppose you're free right now? Because if so you could, erm, come here? If you'd be comfortable? Or if not I could come to you. Or anywhere really! Erm, that sounds pathetically desperate, doesn't it? I promise I'm not
"I meant it," said Harry. "Sprouts would've been fine. But this is great too. Did you really cook it yourself? From scratch? I mean, you even peeled the spuds?"
"It's a gift," said Draco, smirking. "Seriously, though, don't worry about what happened in the bathroom. I accept your apology, of course, but it wasn't necessary."
Draco was alarmed. He formulated and dismissed several possible responses before deciding to go with: "Well, you've got three great kids, and as far as I can tell they all love you both very much. I don't believe kids should be the
"No, I don't think so," said Draco. "Do you? And are you one of those people who wakes up in the middle of the night for a piss?"
Draco's last note was a very long melisma, meandering around the lush piano chords as the flute and cello played separate bits of melody. As all the instruments converged and held a chord with Draco, Harry (still holding Draco's hand) stepped forward slightly and repeated his initial stage-whisper.
He realised that he could easily stare at Harry's muscles for hours, and decided he'd better do the decent thing and admit that he was there. He coughed.
Harry felt Draco's flash of anger, although his facial expression didn't alter. "Of course," said Harry. "But only as friends, Ginny, just to be clear. I'm sorry, but whatever happens between me and Draco I can't be with you again. I've known for a while that I'm not the best partner for you, but I just didn't want to upset you so I didn't say anything. You'll be much happier with someone else."
"When did it start, for you?"
"It was quite difficult to practise this without you finding out, Draco, given that we still had to be in close proximity to each other until a week or two ago," said Harry. "So I need to thank my co-conspirators Beth and Ravi for all their help." He nodded to the two nurses sitting either side of Lucius and Narcissa, and the female nurse got up and went over to the piano.
"First things first," said Draco. "Hang on, I need to change hands, though. I don't know whether my wand would work as well if I used my left hand. Probably safer not to try." He stood in front of Harry so that he could take hold of Harry's right hand as well as his left, and then let go of Harry's left hand, freeing his own right hand to draw his wand. "

"Well, OK, but I'm a coward compared to

Winky was summoned, and shortly afterwards they were tucking into a full English breakfast. Harry cleared his plate quickly, and sat back to watch Draco eat. This was a fascinating sight, he discovered. Draco didn't shove too-large pieces of food into his mouth (as Harry was all too aware he did every time he ate); he cut off a small piece, used his fork to carry it to his mouth, and didn't cut off another piece until the first one had been swallowed. It seemed odd to use the word 'dainty' to describe a man, but that was the word Harry's brain produced.
done a good job.
"If anyone dares to say that, I'll deal with
"It probably goes without saying that all these songs are dedicated to Harry," said Draco, over the chords, "but I've tried hard to choose songs whose lyrics are particularly appropriate for me to sing to him, and this one is no exception. It's by a singer called Debby Boone, and it's called 'You Light Up My Life'."
"And what about romance? Or sex, or preferably both?"
"I've spent the past four years studying vocal performance," Draco pointed out. "It'd be a bit silly if I got embarrassed when I actually performed, wouldn't it?"
"Kilgharrah? That's a very unusual name. Where did that come from?"
"What do you…" began Harry, but the man ran off around the corner opposite the Magical Menagerie.
"Sadly, there’s no such thing," Draco told him. "I can detect whether you’re under a

Hermione laughed. "Drama queen," she said. "Thank you again for all this. See you soon – with Harry."
to make it up here for lunch, but I apologise in advance if I don't manage it."
"Well, OK. I’m not promising I’ll take it, but if you give me the potion I’ll think about it," said Harry. "You still think it’s nothing to do with the curse?"
"Their school year starts much later than the Hogwarts one, so this is still my summer holiday," said Draco. "Now, please stop avoiding the issue. I've answered all your questions. Will you answer
He rooted through his backpack until he found a small booklet, and turned to the last page. After a quick count, he announced: "Forty-two sopranos. Forty-six altos. Twelve tenors. Twenty-three basses. ... Oh, wait, those twelve tenors include the two who were ill on the day, so there were only ten. Plus me."
At half past seven exactly, Harry stepped out in front of the huge audience. (Originally, the plan had been for each performer to introduce themselves, but as the audience grew the musicians agreed that it would be nice to have a proper welcome for each of them, and Harry had been quickly volunteered for the job; Draco had already mentioned the management offer, and they all seemed keen on that, too.) By Harry’s estimation, there were now almost five hundred people in a room that probably held considerably less than half that number, but none of the Muggles present seemed to have noticed the magical expansion (he’d also had to do a surreptitious Geminio when he’d realised they had extra space but no extra chairs). Rabia’s parents, who she’d introduced to Harry a few minutes earlier, were sitting proudly a few rows from the front, but the majority of the people in the room were wizards and witches - most known to Harry by name, but by no means all of them, although he recognised a lot of faces.
"A male alto," said Draco. "A man who sings really, really high notes. I'm sure they're all lovely people, but I don't like hearing them sing. Sorry, I'll stop ranting now."
"Not before I've returned the favour," said Draco. "I've been fantasising about this for years, remember. Although, now you've added to the pressure by being a blowjob natural, I'm not sure I dare try."
said Ron. "

In the bedroom, Harry pulled Draco onto the bed as soon as they reached it, but Draco stood up again, laughing. "Fair's fair," he said. "I'm feeling oddly brazen, so let's see if I can give
"No, probably not," said Molly, "but it'll help more than anything else. The voice is a very sensitive thing and it can react badly if you try and alter it with magic, so the best strategy for things like this is to use mainly physical cures – same as a Muggle would – but I do know some spells that can enhance their effects."
Prompt for 3rd December:

Harry grinned. "I know you think it's hilarious, but it just tastes nicer! Champagne is a bit too bitter for me, usually."
"I agree," said Harry. "I do too. I think you're better at it than me, though - I recognised
Harry removed a glowing coin from his pocket, with an apologetic look at Draco. "It's the Ministry," he said. "I have to go."
"Fair point," said Harry. "I do feel a lot more relaxed than I usually am at this point, I must admit."
"As if his world had ended," agreed McGonagall. "Which, under the circumstances, he has every right to. I was astonished when he told me what had happened. I'm pleased to hear he's recovering, though. And that the two of you seem to be getting along so well. I was confident you'd be able to be polite to each other, at least, but I was still quite taken aback when Harry begged me to let you stay."
. I'm afraid we've all been so busy just trying to get the school ready to open on time that we haven't even considered changing anything, and that was remiss of us. I wish you
"That smells delicious, Ron," commented Draco. "You've made it difficult for me if you ever come to
"That we're friends," said Draco. "And they
"I'd love to say I'd guessed it must be something like that, but that would be a total lie," said Rabia. "I knew there was something special about you - and Harry, for that matter - but I thought it was just that you were insanely talented. Which, I hasten to add, you absolutely still are."
It was almost midnight when Harry finally returned, and Draco would have had trouble staying awake if he hadn't been so worried. He was just wondering whether or not it was worth sending an owl when Harry stumbled out of the fireplace.
"Open it and see, dummy."
"We're as bad as each other," Draco agreed. "But the important thing is that there's nothing stopping us doing it

to, really, but I think it would help a bit."
"That's where the shops are," added Narcissa. "And Tuesday is market day. Oh, and there's a pleasant little café. We should pop in for coffee and cake."
"I'm sure you can probably work it out if you try. You seem to have worked out everything else about me," Harry said. "No, wait, that sounds as if I'm bitter, and I'm not, really. I'm just... a bit fed up."
Draco's jaw dropped open. "Mother!" he said, horrified. "He's sitting right here!"
"I appreciate that," said Harry. "To be quite honest, though, I do actually feel a bit relieved that it's over between me and her, now I've got used to the idea. She deserves someone who really wants to be with her, and Ron's right – that hasn't been me for quite a while. I just couldn't bear to admit it – to myself or to her."
"How many do you think
"It is," Harry agreed. "I suspect he'll argue a bit more next time I see him. He's definitely never given in so completely before, but he was totally out of his comfort zone. Especially when you were naked in front of him too – which was

"Well, it works, however you've done it," said Rabia. "Now, I'd love to sit and chat, but I've got a euphonium player coming for a run-through in a minute, so I'm afraid I'm going to have to throw you out. Harry, I’ll see you on Friday – please make sure you sit near the front so that Draco sings like he did today. Draco, I’ll catch up with you tomorrow, yeah? I’m going to want to talk ALL about Harry now I can put a face to the name.”
Harry is impressed.
"I feel fine," said Harry, smiling at him reassuringly. "I'm just glad everything's sorted out and Ginny and I can both move on. And Draco has been looking after me."
Draco laughed. "No! Why would you think I'd have needed it? I don't think I even have any in Sorrento. Like I said, it's been a long time."
"Indeed," sad Draco. "Well, the good news is I’m as certain as I can be that it’s
"We agreed that we'd tell them after we told the kids, and that we'd ask the kids not to mention it to Rose and Hugo for at least a few hours, so that they didn't hear the news before their parents did," said Harry. "Now, please
"Won't be a sec, then," said Harry.
what Draco had expected to hear. "What?" he said, baffled.
"I tried not to think about that, but I think he probably could... although not very often, or he wouldn't have spent so long trying to catch me," said Harry thoughtfully. "But yes, it did hurt."
Harry nodded. "Anyway, you're right about the darkness," he said. "I've become fascinated by astronomy in the last few years, but it's hard to see anything in London with all the light pollution. It's a lot better at The Burrow – that's where I started noticing the stars in the first place. But for a while now I've wanted to spend a few nights somewhere
Draco shook himself and got dressed before looking for a bathroom. This, too, was tiny – possibly the smallest bathroom Draco had ever used – with a shower over the bath and a sink crammed in next to the toilet. The window was slightly ajar, and a sudden gust of cold air hurried Draco out of the room and downstairs.
"OK. I'm dying of curiosity now, mind. But tonight should be fine. Actually, it's good timing, because Hermione's promised to cook a Christmas pudding, and it's a bit too big for just the two of us."
"What do you want us to do until everyone else arrives?" asked Ron. "Shall we just go up to Gryffindor Tower and wait?"

"Well, we could Side-Along you if you like, I suppose," said Hermione. "Although..." She paused as she noticed the look on Harry's face.
Harry grinned at Draco, who shrugged his shoulders. "Listen, you three," said Harry. "Your mum'll be Portkeying in any minute now, so just sit down and I'll join you in a second. I just want to have a word with Professor Malfoy before he leaves us. No, not leaves us,
"Oh, definitely," Harry agreed. "Did your dad put anything in for us to have with it?"
At noon the next day, Harry was waiting for Draco in the Guildhall foyer. The foyer had been decorated to within an inch of its life; Harry couldn't see any part of it that wasn't covered in tinsel or glitter, and the glare was starting to make his eyes hurt a little.
Draco grinned at him, and they walked the rest of the way to the ward in a companionable silence.
"Bloody hell, Mione," complained Ron. "You said it was clear!"
"I just thought it'd be nice to walk to Hogwarts from here rather than use the Floo," said Hermione. "Adds more of a sense of occasion somehow. Plus, you're not great at travelling by Floo."
wand out is that I was being calm and sensible, but the truth is that I didn't even have time to make the decision, you were so quick. I like to think I would have done the same if I'd had the choice, though."
"Don't worry, I can guess what you want to ask," said Scorpius. He switched his spoon to his left hand so that he could eat while scribbling a note. Draco was about to reprimand him for these appalling table manners, but then he remembered that he did want to get back to the castle as soon as possible, and started to speed up his own tiramisu consumption. He'd just cleared his plate when Scorpius handed him the note.

6: Christmas lights over a snowy bench
Draco looked at him for a moment, then exhaled heavily. "They were," he admitted. "I actually really enjoyed most of them. It was just those damn third-years. And bloody hell, I just remembered – I get the other half of the third year first thing tomorrow. Kill me now."
Russian is being spoken, and progress is being made.
Not the most helpful of prompts today – why did I say yesterday there were no Christmas decorations in Draco’s flat?!?
Lucius and Narcissa still didn't turn away from the windows.
"It tastes like sick," was Ron's verdict a moment later. He reached for another one.
Draco laughed. "No, this is the Cutty Sark," he told him. "It's more than a hundred years old - it's a tourist attraction, it doesn't sail any more. You're right, though, it
to be that hot?"
"True, but there's a reason that formal meetings tend to have action points or something similar. Otherwise what's the point of the meeting?"
stupid," said Harry. "And I'm sure everyone else will think I'm stupid when this gets out in the press. Which it will."
"Obviously I'm extremely polite, and I tell them that I'm very flattered but I have a boyfriend," said Draco.
"Thank you, Draco," said Harry. "I appreciate all this. And I’ve enjoyed this evening. See you tomorrow!" They shook hands, and Harry stepped into the fireplace.
"Where shall we go?" wondered Ron.
He nodded to Rabia, who launched into a laid-back intro full of juicy harmonies. "
Harry woke up slowly. He'd only crawled into bed just after 6am, after a frustrating night which he and Ron had mostly spent standing under a tree in Leicestershire, waiting for a call to action that never came. It took him quite a bit longer than it should have to realise that what had woken him was an owl tapping at his bedroom window. Rubbing his eyes blearily, he stumbled over to the window to let it in.
"Well, I've totally got my head round the fact that people in America have just gone to bed when I get up, and so on," Draco explained. "I can cope with time zones that are
"Didn't see you there – you startled me," she said. "Have you been waiting long? Wait... where's Ron?"
"It's true," said Harry. "He's addicted. Right now, he's
"Well, look at us, for example," he said. "If we'd told anyone we were at school with that one day we'd go off to spend the night camping together, they'd assume one of us was planning to kill the other. Of course, it may still come to that, but I'm hoping not."
"Oh, we both know it'd be better if I was with you, but I'd still have to try it on my own before I could be sure it was safe," said Draco. "Thank you for the thought, though. And now you may marvel as I avoid an awkward topic by answering your other question! I'm a composer. That's what I do for a living. I write music, partly for my own pleasure but mainly for money, which means that I can't always write the type of music I'd choose to. The best fees come from film and TV soundtracks, so I do lots of those."
"Bloody kids," he said with a sigh. "Third-years, to be exact. The rest were all OK, actually, but that lot I had last lesson..." He sighed again.
Draco looked at him for a moment. "What have you eaten today?" he asked, eventually.
Draco thanked the man (well, if you could call him that; possibly he was slightly older than twelve, but surely no more than fourteen) and settled back into his chair, lost in thought. He was quite startled when he finally returned his gaze to Hermione and found her looking directly at him, with a sort of puzzled awareness.
"Only if you promise we can meet again tomorrow, and continue from where we left off," said Harry. "Apart from anything else, we promised to visit Hermione.
"Ooh, that sounds like something I want to see," said Harry. "Is it OK if I come?"
In the five minutes before Harry was at the front of the queue ordering his cappuccino, he couldn't help glancing over at Malfoy several times. Each time he did so, Malfoy's eyes were still closed and the muttering continued almost nonstop, but Harry realised that the frown only appeared when the screeching girls screeched particularly loudly. Encouraged by this fact – but even more so by the fact that there were no other empty seats in the whole place – he collected his drink from the end of the counter and approached Malfoy's table.
If anyone is wondering who Mrs Doyle is,
"I assume you'll want to make the most of the night sky, so shall we say quite early? Six o'clock?" said Lucius, taking a pen from his pocket to write the address on a beer mat. "That will give us time to cook something proper. Is there anything you won't eat?"
"Yeah. It was... not pleasant, and I was distraught for a while. But when I calmed down a bit I realised that he had never felt like
why you're a better person than me."
"Got it in one," said Harry, beaming. "What d'you think? Would it be easy to do?"
Draco flushed uncomfortably. "Well, you had a good reason then," he pointed out.

He watched as Harry reached into a container and took out two things that were very vaguely fish-shaped, but didn't otherwise look like any fish Draco had ever seen. They were covered in some sort of milky liquid, which dripped off them as Harry dropped them into what Draco could now see was a vat of sizzling hot oil in front of him.

"True," said Harry. "Right, are you ready?" Draco took hold of his arm, and they Apparated.
"That'd be lovely," said Draco. "Speaking of which, we haven't told Harry about your idea, have we?"
"I definitely need to sleep," said Harry. "Thanks for coming. See you at work on Monday?"

what happened to you here in the past." He set off along the corridor, and Harry fell into step with him, cursing his own big mouth for wrecking the comfortable atmosphere.
"Sounds lovely," Harry said. "So, you have a piano in your house? I wish we were there instead of here, so you could play it to me."
Harry realised that he was actually starving. "That's a good idea. And I've got an equally good one. Winky!"
Harry stared at him. "You go to
"It's amazing, isn't it? But, no."
"We're going to need to do that again quite soon, if that's OK with you," said Harry.
"Your kids, or
Draco bade her farewell, promising to be back as quickly as possible. He spent a few minutes wandering round the hospital in search of a suitable Apparition location. The fire escape behind the canteen suited his needs, and seconds later he was approaching the door of The Burrow. He hesitated before knocking, but the door opened while he was still summoning his courage.
he thought. He laughed at this, then leaned over and kissed Draco's forehead. "Come on," he said. "Let's go and eat our fish and chips before they go cold, and then I rather like the idea of snuggling on the settee with you while we talk. How does that sound?"
"That would make sense," said Hermione thoughtfully. "But also most wands that are seized are not subsequently willingly returned by the person who seized them, or with such good wishes. I mean, I didn't actually know that Harry had returned it at all, but I'm willing to bet that you thanked Draco for its use and were happy to return it to him?"
"Oh, I is being the
Prompt for 7th December:
Draco nodded. "Not only did I have nothing I could put on the form, but I couldn't even make stuff up, because I knew they'd check it," he said. "But I

Draco took a deep breath. "Diagon Alley," he said.
the very aspects of the performance that Draco had hated made him even grumpier, and he felt suddenly very lonely: he had no problem attending concerts on his own, but he did not appreciate being reminded that he wasn't on the same wavelength as most people.

Harry's cock twitched again at this, and Draco wriggled slightly against it, although Harry wasn't sure whether or not he did this consciously. "So you are... "
Harry's face was crimson – Draco was pleased to note that at least he no longer looked like death warmed up – but, to his credit, he didn't look away, staring as Draco removed each item. It was only when Draco stepped out of his black boxer briefs and stood there naked, trying not to feel self-conscious at the fact that his cock was fully erect, that Harry started to remove his own clothes, his eyes continually returning to Draco's cock as he did so.
"What on earth are you apologising for? I'm taking it as a huge compliment. I made you come without even touching your cock. I'm feeling incredibly smug right now, I can tell you."
"It's pretty, isn't it?" agreed Draco. "I thought you knew, though, sorry. This is where my concert is, on Wednesday. And I was originally not expecting many people, but after you told everyone about it today I think there might be a few more, and I want to check how many we can fit in. Come on, we need to talk to the curator."
Harry gave him a watery smile. "You're being so nice," he said. "Thank you. I do actually feel a bit better now I've unloaded everything on you, but I think I'm all talked out for the moment. Please don't feel you
Ginny grinned. "The Boy Who Lived to be Bad to the Bone. I always suspected it would come to this."
"Well... Of course," said Draco, realising that he could hardly refuse. He wasn't at all sure how Granger would react to his presence, but decided that she would probably prefer even someone she hated than no one at all; she had, after all, always seemed more sensible than most of her friends.
"Well, at least she hasn't sent a Howler yet," Harry pointed out, but he hurriedly reached for his cloak anyway. The Howler incident had happened two months earlier, in his first week as a fully-trained Auror, and people still teased him about it.
Draco has bought Harry a present.
"A lot better, I think," said Draco. "I take it you were worried about him last night? He
"I'm not sure," admitted Hermione. "But, even if it lasts all the way to Hogwarts, we still have to actually leave the carriage, remember. There might be even more of them by then."
time we visit either of them, don't you? It was the anticipation that was getting to us."
Ten minutes later, they were in front of the Royal Albert Hall, waiting to cross the road to the park. It was already getting quite dark, and Prince Albert gleamed at them slightly eerily from his memorial.
"Well, that's actually another thing I'm unsure about," said Draco. "We agreed I should do a classical song and a more modern one, and I think that's a good plan, but I don't think there's an outfit I'd feel comfortable in for both of those."
"Have you changed your name, then?" asked Harry, surprised.

kissed him quite a lot."
"It was Crabbe," said Draco tersely. "It would have been me, too, if you hadn't swooped in to save me. For which, thank you again, by the way."
"How shall we..." he began, but then Draco slid his hand down Harry's arm and took hold of his hand.
in it. Including a load of clothes for all three of us. For her and Ron she'd just put their own clothes in, but she said it was about time I had some proper clothes, so she went out and bought some for me, and I've been wearing them ever since."
"I knew that people used to tell their kids about me, but for some reason it never occurred to me that they probably still do," admitted Harry. "I think I'd vaguely assumed that if people talk about me, it's people
The fox disintegrated, and Harry grinned. "Right,
His immediate concern was that he and Harry hadn't made specific arrangements for their next meeting; Harry knew that Draco had no way of contacting him other than face to face, but was Harry expecting him to just turn up, or would Harry come back to Wallington? And at what time? And would it be awkward?
"Indeed," said Draco. "I might almost believe you were a gentleman."
"But that's not enough," protested Harry. "He's exhausted. Isn't there anything that you can suggest to help
"We should go and say hello," said Lucius. His wife and son whirled round to look at him in surprise, but he was already striding over to the corner, so they followed.
to only see his wife during the holidays. It had never occurred to him to worry about this until James had set his thoughts racing – plainly he must be the worst husband in the world, he thought glumly.
"Hmm, when you put it like that it
"I do now," said Draco. "I tried getting the house-elves to encourage them to eat, and that worked at first, but now neither of them will eat unless I start them off. I kept getting home and finding them still sitting at the table with untouched plates of food in front of them, and the house-elves were all distraught. It was easier to just start coming home every day. It's not as if there was anyone I was spending lunchtimes with at work, anyway, so it wasn't a big deal."
(See the end of the chapter for
"I've been thinking about this for quite a while, and I've talked about it to quite a few people," Harry went on, "and I've decided I'm going to spend a lot of my time, for the foreseeable future at least, managing Draco's singing career, and maybe the careers of a few other musicians too. Now, I know this is very different from anything I've done before, and I may turn out to be useless at it, but I'm very keen to give it a go. But if you're thinking what I suspect you're thinking, I'd like you to listen to what my very good friend Ronald Weasley has to say."
"I hardly did anything," Draco protested. "Kingsley's a good man. Oliver too, for that matter. What made the biggest difference was what you said to them in Moscow. They'd obviously talked about it quite a bit since then, and I think they were feeling bad that things had got to that stage. They wanted to help - they just hadn't thought of a way to do it."
"It was easy, actually, although it was only by accident that I did it this way. When I started telling him this story, he was very young, so I always started with 'once upon a time' and didn't make it clear that it was a
The concert is a great success, but it's pretty obvious who the star is.

son, for that matter. I'm sure the pair of them will keep the rest in line."
"Yes, yes and yes," said Draco. "It's never been a secret. In fact, I'm surprised you didn't know, since our sons are so close. Do gay people disgust you, then? I must say I never thought of you as the homophobic sort."
"No apology necessary," said Harry, stifling a yawn. "But if you do come up and I'm asleep, promise you'll wake me? I'd hate to miss you."
"Sorry I'm so late," Ginny said, when the obvious exhaustion in Harry's face (somehow exacerbated by the surreal paint) guilted her into stopping her giggling. "The match took ages. What on earth happened to your face?"
Harry, ever obedient, increased his efforts. "I'm close," he panted.
Harry's confused about where he is.
Harry and Draco spend a while being tourists in Greenwich.
Harry laughed. "Bugger! Of course there was," he said. "Good job one of us was paying attention. Won't be a sec." He ran out of the room.
"This is impressive, isn't it?" said Harry a few hours later, as he and Draco strolled across Red Square in the early evening. "I was right, though - St Basil's is the most impressive bit."
"He was a bit of a star, actually," said Draco. "He asked some very good questions, including one I'd never even thought about before."
Harry blushed, but lined up his cock and pushed, and was gratified to see it go straight in. He felt a brief barrier, but continued to push, and eventually his cock was entirely hidden within Draco's body; he felt his balls pressing against Draco's buttocks and gazed down in wonder.
"That's a bit of an understatement," said Draco. "So, OK, your arguments are quite persuasive - I'm actually starting to believe this might work. But I'd have to pay you - it wouldn't be right otherwise. And I wouldn't be able to pay very much at first."
Padma burst out laughing, and Harry threw a bread roll at her.
Two hours later, Harry was at his desk in his staff quarters, gulping down a mug of strong coffee. He had almost finished his lesson plans for the following day, and the temptation to go to sleep immediately and get up early to finish them was very strong. But Harry knew himself well enough to know that in the morning Still-Half-Asleep-Harry would tell himself it'd be fine if he stayed in bed another hour and made up the lesson as he went along. Hence the strong coffee, and he had also put on some music to see if that helped; normally he found it impossible to concentrate with music playing, but he hoped the distraction might help for once. The Spanish Dance from Tchaikovsky's
Harry leaned forward and kissed him thoroughly, stopping only when Ron said: "Delightful as this is to see, we still have all this food to eat, and warming charms aren't quite as good as eating it while it's still hot from the oven. So let's eat, and then later we can fine-tune the plan."

"Oh no?"
"Hey. It's me," said Ron. "What do
"They are," said Harry. "This is all very impressive, I must say. I never thought you had it in you. Now, come on. I want my hot chocolate. And I want to quiz you about your personal life."
"It's easier not to. This is really the only place I can do magic, and if I brought Muggles here I'd have to concentrate to avoid any slip-ups."
"But you were..." started Draco.
"Who would you have preferred?" asked Harry, curious.
"Oy!" protested Harry, followed by "... actually, that's fair. Hermione has accused me of that on more than one occasion. What haven't I noticed now, though? Or, wait... obviously I do want to know that, but first I want to know when you, erm, changed your mind about me."
The snow is falling down, gets colder day by day ... I miss you
"Your hoodie. Give it to me," said Draco. "Have I got the word right? That's what you call that red thing you've got on, isn't it?"
