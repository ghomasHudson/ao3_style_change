Draco almost let out a sob of his own, before ignoring the crowd that had gathered around them and made his way towards his own dorm.
“I can’t do that.” He breathed out and realised for the first time that it was true. That what he felt was real. It was so fucking real. But as he stared into Potter’s loving gaze, he thought himself an idiot for every doubting that.
He sighed closing his eyes firmly. “Good, now close your eyes and think about what your future would be.”  She started and Draco attempted to imagine his future. She carried on, “is it long? Is it short? Is it everything that you could possibly want?” She asked.
It was a moment that he'd dreaded. One that he didn't particularly want to come true. But it was one that had to happen. One that there was  no escaping from. And that, that was the scariest thing one could possibly imagine.
He was tired of it. He was tired of his father always acting as if he was above everyone else, as if he were always right. Well, he wasn’t. Not this time.
Hermione sighed. “You and Harry. Shouldn’t you already know what love is since your already so deeply acquainted with it?” she questioned knowingly.
Madam Pomfrey nodded and Kat gave Draco a quick squeeze. “I’ll see you tomorrow.” She whispered before leading the Hufflepuff’s out in a whirl of Left. Rights. Left. Rights.
Several moments later and he was done. The severity of his actions weighing down on him, his shoulders sagging in defeat. He’d had to do it. He felt tears prick the inner corners of his eyes, threatening to fall. He’d had no choice. It was expected of him.
With a sigh, Draco lamented over the letter he had just written Potter, carefully folding it and tucking it safely into its envelope. It was his shortest letter yet.
So, the Hogsmeade weekend had crept up on him out of nowhere. He was getting ready for his date with Theo. Well, he would’ve been if he hadn’t been dragged into an empty classroom by a red-faced, angry Snape.
Potter scoffed. “You know what, you’re not worth it.” He growled. “You’re pathetic.” He spat before pushing past him and continuing down the corridor.
Draco felt something very similar to dread start to wash over him. This was bad. This was very, very bad.
Arthur Weasley gave him a strong pat on the back, “I’ve found something revolutionary.” He said in pure triumph.
She nodded enthusiastically and Draco was surprised when a small hand latched onto his own. It was a very peculiar act, but it strangely warmed the pits of his stomach, nonetheless.
A purple glint caught his eye, as he glanced at the Hufflepuff table. Piggy was at the centre, the ‘Draco Malfoy Pride’ badges being passed round frantically. Them shining on the robes of most of the Hufflepuff's.
He didn’t blame Draco. He didn’t blame him at all. He understood completely. He didn’t have a choice. He was just a boy forced into a life that he didn’t want to live. Harry knew all about that. They were quite similar in that respect.
tell me you’re riding that muggle death-trap Draco.” His father bit out angrily. “I swear to Merlin if you are I’ll—”
Draco sighed. “Of course, I don’t, jokes are meant to be funny. This situation makes me laugh far less than it amuses me.” He dramatically drawled.
Potter gasped and Draco held his breath. Inside was two pieces of paper. One was a sketch of Potter and himself by the lake, looking up at the stars in awe. It was the moment that Potter had told Draco about his parents, and the moment that everything had changed. It captured the moment that Draco felt safe, free, like he belonged.
Draco lifted an eyebrow, “you can’t act smart you bumbling buffoon. You either are or you’re not. Not that I’d expect the likes of
Draco turned to face the inquisitive little menace, “quite simply actually. He is my father so I love him but he is an obnoxious twat so I don’t stand for what he believes in.” he answered, mentally kicking himself for being so vulnerable. To a bunch of first years, nonetheless.
Draco nodded as they dissolved into another outburst of laughter. He never did answer Potter’s question.
And that’s after the rest of them had scurried off back to the Hufflepuff table when Snape had reprimanded them for overcrowding.
There was nothing wrong with him. This was war. Things happen during war. People die, people live. Shots are fired, shots are lost. It was normal. He
This wasn't their faults. Not much anyways. They were just trying to do the right thing by their friends, he couldn't fault them for that. He would've done the same.
What was Potter talking about? Had he confused Draco with someone else? Had war taken a toil on his mental state? So many question, and so little answers.
Draco looked up at him in alarm. “This. Us. You!” he frantically spat, gesturing his arms between them.
Once again, this was something that he needed to bare alone. He couldn't burden anyone else with his problems. Especially Potter.
Draco sighed contemplatively, he reasoned that he just didn’t care. He really didn’t care. What was the point? He was trapped in a net of expectation and duty. His life was and would always be a product of his father’s choices. What was the point of caring for a life that wasn’t his own?
Okay, that was it. He didn't want to do nicely. He didn't even want to share her toilet. He needed to divert the topic of conversation, and he needed to do it now.
Draco shot her a comical glance, “no disrespect, but this is the last fucking place I want to be.” He assured her before walking out of the room.
She shook her head. “I used to think that my mum’s death was my fault. That maybe if I were happier, or kinder she would’ve lived. I was just so confused.” She let out a loud sigh and Draco felt his heart crack a little.
Potter held up his arms in defeat. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to annoy you.” He said honestly. “It’s just you never draw this early in the morning by yourself, unless there’s something wrong.” He argued.
He shrugged. “Sorry if this sounds crude, but I honestly couldn’t give a fucking shit what that noseless bastard thinks.” He bit out defiantly.
Oh, he saw how they wanted to play it. Well, two could play at that game. He stroked his chin as if he were in deep thought, “I wonder what my Hufflepuff’s are doing?” He started as he watched his friends start to squirm. “I hear that they’ve charmed their butterflies to act a little more aggressively, I do ponder what exactly would happen if they just so happened to attack once I step out of the carriage.” He threatened lightly.
Weasley laughed. “Don’t lie to me, I saw how nice you were to that little girl you were with.” he said and Draco realised that he must be referencing Kat. Stupid adorable little Hufflepuff, tearing down the reputation that he had tried so hard to build up.
Potter took a step towards him shaking his head, “what don’t you know?” he asked softly, his voice laced with concern.
And to see her like this, with tears running down her cheeks, well, it was something he never wanted to see again.
“Draco?” his mother whispered carefully, and he turned to face her, “are you awake?” she asked and he was just about to answer when the cup of tea she was carrying slipped from her grasp and landed onto the floor with a painfully loud
He shook his head and sent the girl a reassuring look, “there’s nothing wrong with you sitting here. Old Severus probably just wants to talk to me about potions or something.” the
Draco grinned. “But I find everything funny.” He reasoned, because everything was just that little bit better when viewed as satirical.
It was Christmas Eve and Potter and himself were cuddled up next to one another in front of the common room fireplace.
The Fiendfyre spread uncontrollably and Draco started to run. He could see the exit, it was so close, he figured that the others were close behind. But it was hard to see, it was a case of every man for himself.
Draco blushed, feeling hot under his gaze. “If Draco will have me?” Theo said, staring at Draco expectantly.
He felt a single tear fall onto his reddened cheek. “But I can change the future. I can look it straight into the eye and go for it. I can be someone that you’d be proud of. That I’d be proud of.” He sighed, “there’s nothing I can do or say that would ever make it up to you. But I can try. I can try and laugh. I can try and be kind. I can and will try to be the person who you thought I was. Of whom I
“You bitch!” he screamed, pointing his wand at her. “I’ll kill you.” He threatened with conviction. “I’LL FUCKING KILL YOU!” he roared spitting out a multitude of spells that she ever so easily blocked.
It was the next day and Draco was surrounded by a bunch of Hufflepuff first years. Who’s idea was this again? Oh right, his.
He shook his head. “Nothing Pans. Please promise me you’ll stay out of it.” he almost begged her, he wouldn't forgive himself if anything were to happen to her.
His father came from behind him, begging and pleading with him to be sure. Draco ignored him. He was far too focused on the ring pulsing from beneath him, filling him with an indescribable warmth. He felt safe, he felt free.
Fair play, it was perhaps a tad idiotic to trust a stranger. But Draco wasn't any old stranger, no he was the Prince of Slytherin.
Despite his better judgement he made his way towards the alcove and was shocked to find a crying Hermione. It unsettled him deeply, for as long as he'd known her, Hermione had always been so brave and strong.
Draco shook his head. “I’m so glad to see you.” He directed particularly at Hermione and Weasley. “But I have to stay here. I can’t leave my mother.” he explained.
She gave him a reassuring pat. “Don’t worry, Draco. I’m not sad anymore. Well, not really.” She carried on. “It just means that I get two Christmases and two whole birthdays!” she said excitedly. “Mummy and Daddy still fight when they see each other, I think that mummy doesn’t like daddy’s new girlfriend.” She decided.
“Hold on.” He begged his friend who’s eyes were wide with fear. Draco felt his heart start to beat even harder in his chest as he saw the Fiendfyre start to rise. It was over. They were going to die here. There was no hope left.
Just then, Smith was attacked by a flock of angry butterflies, them pecking and nabbing at his exposed skin. He screamed in pain.
Draco knew he was weak. He knew that he shouldn’t forgive Potter. That he should walk away right now and not look back.
Potter gave him a hopeful smile, “then there’s nothing to worry about. Nothing else matters except how we feel about each other.” He said with reassurance.
He turned his attention to his daughter, and his heart broke for her. He knew that she’d really been looking forward for them to wave her off at the platform.
“Oh, it is,” he replied. “When it’s all done. When it’s all over, the first thing I’m going to do is travel. Just because I can.” He said enthusiastically. The
He absently thought about the ring that hopefully still rested on Draco’s chest. He smiled at the thought, because maybe, just maybe he was protecting Draco too.
Truthfully, Draco didn’t want to answer that question. He would never answer that question, for it was a question that he feared he already knew the answer to.
He was just about to hurl a witty remark when she took a deep breath. “What’s going on with you Draco?” she asked in concern.
lost almost everything. So, he’d realised that with what he did have, he had to cling onto and never let go. And he had his father. He would
Macmillan shook his head, “don’t worry, I’m not going to babble. Mainly because babbling is bad and makes no sense at all. I mean really? Why do people babble. Are they scared? Are they confused? Do they—”
He couldn’t help but notice the similarities between her and Kat. They were so similar but yet so different. He felt awful for how he’d treated Hermione in their past years. She didn’t deserve it, none of them deserved it.
“Draco Lucius Malfoy!” A familiar voice spat. “Why did I have to find out from a bloody Hufflepuff first year that—”
Well he didn’t really have anything to say to that, did he? So, instead he diverted his gaze onto the ground beneath him.
That was hilarious. He never realised that Severus was a bloody comedian. Draco admit that he was wrong. Draco Lucius Malfoy? And leave himself open to Severus' smug teasing that he knew that he would indulge in. He thought not!
Pansy shook her head. “I don’t blame him the girl is stunning. She’d look even better if I gave her that makeover I told you about.” She asked hopefully, giving him a pointed look.
Draco was completely surprised to see Kat march in followed by a long line of Hufflepuff first-years. Their ‘Draco Malfoy Pride’ badges shone proudly on their robes. Their faces were tainted with three stripes of purple glitter paint which was plastered on each cheek. They looked adorable.
“I’ve done something terrible. I carry it with me all day, every day. It serves as a scar. A reminder. Of what I am. Of what I’ll never be. Of whom I’ll always be.” Potter’s eyes shone with fresh tears. “I wish I could say that I didn’t want to do it. That I was forced. But the truth is, I wasn’t. I thought I was being brave. I thought I was making my father proud. But I wasn’t. I never have. I don’t think I ever will.”
He found Crabbe and Goyle, both almost surrounded by fire. “Follow me.” He urged as he started to climb up a tall stack of furniture. He had no idea as to what he was doing, he was pretty sure that the mound wouldn’t hold. He just prayed that the fire wouldn’t reach them.
She gave him a searching look, “I mean that you’re not happy.” She reiterated. “I see how you look at people. I know how you act.” She said matter-of-factly.
He hummed. “I’m glad.” He locked his fingers into Draco’s messy hair. “We have to get up soon, we have to get to the Weasley’s for lunch.” He sighed dejectedly and Draco knew know he felt.
The Headmaster sighed knowingly. “Are you sure that you’re alright, Mr Malfoy?” he asked in concern.
Draco rolled his eyes, “because I don’t bloody well know why there’s a bunch of Hufflepuff’s following me around like I’m Merlin himself!” he bit out exasperatedly.
He took a deep breath, his eyes shimmering with caution, “because Voldemort said he was going to kill the person I love.” He breathed out, and Draco looked up at him confused.
Weasley sighed. “I’m sorry mate, we were just doing what we thought was right. It was unhealthy.” He started and Potter glared.
Wait. He took a closer look at it. But maybe, it was a snarl. Yes, he mused. It did remind him quite a bit of a snarl. He was sure of it. It couldn’t be a laugh because it was a snarl.
Draco grinned as he broke away from the Weasley twin. “Well, I wasn’t going to let you die, was I?” he attempted to joke.
Blaise shook his head. “Don’t say anything, just do the right thing.” He whispered quietly, and Draco finally saw reason.
Pansy gave him a conflicted look and he took a deep breath, “You must hate me.” He said sadly. Of course she would, he would hate himself.
A single tear slipped down his cheek. And all he wanted in that moment was one thing. One person. He wanted Potter. He wanted
“I know you’re up to something Malfoy. I know you’ve done something to that girl. What, were your cronies not good enough that you had to settle for an innocent girl?” Potter hissed.
“So dear,” Mrs Weasley started, “my lazy son here tells me that you’re the reason that he scored an O on his potions project.” He beamed at him, lumping a huge piece of chicken breast onto his plate.
He was currently sitting in The Leaky Cauldron. He and Theo had picked out a quaint little table near the back of the pub. He knew he should be focusing on Theo and his story about beans, but he had a plan to execute.
Draco Lucius Malfoy. Cause of death: suffocation by rubble, aided by a hyena’s screech. Draco mused, he had to admit, it had a nice ring to it. Much better than the AK he was sure to get after he failed to carry out the Dark Lord’s impossible biddings.
Pansy sniffed. “Well we don’t care what you said. We’re saying that you have to. And that’s that.” she said firmly and he wanted to strangle her.
“RONALD BILLIUS WEASLEY! I swear on my seven children that if you don’t step away from that chicken now, I’ll cut off your tongue!” Mrs Weasley yelled, and those were the first words he heard as he stepped through the Weasley flew.
He now realised how naïve he’d been. That wasn’t the truth. Not anymore. Because the scars were permanent. A mark engraved onto his skin to remind him why the bruises had been there in the first place. To remind him of all that he had lost, and all that could’ve been.
Fine! He admits it. He was worried about Potter. Of course, it wasn’t because he cared about Potter. That didn’t make any sense. He hardly knew who Harry Potter really was except from being his childhood nemesis. But he had to listen.
Pansy pulled him into a tight hug as he sobbed onto her robes. “I know darling. I know.” He whispered soothingly. “But you have to. You don’t have a choice.” he froze.
“Draco?” at tentative voice asked and Draco forced himself out of his parents embrace as he looked up into the hesitant eyes of Harry Potter.
Crabbe and Goyle. Well, Vincent and Greg as he supposed he should get used to calling them as they were his friends after all, spent the entire of transfigurations attempting to cheer him up. He’d spent the entire time trying to tell them that he was alright, but they either thought he was fine but still wanted to make him smile, or he wasn’t very convincing. Draco suspected the latter. Still, it was sweet, nevertheless.
He was calculating and cruel. All things that the world should be rid of. Draco decided that Potter was right, Draco didn't deserve it. He deserved
“So, Draco,” Hermione started and Draco turned to face her. “Did you like the potions book I got you?” she asked almost shyly.
That made sense. With their help, there was a greater possibility of success. He had a chance. He really had a chance.
Suddenly, the common room door slammed open, and Theo walked in, planting a quick kiss on Draco’s cheek before sitting down.
She shook her head violently. “Of course, I don’t hate you.” She reassured him. “I love you. You’re my best friend.” She declared fiercely and Draco couldn't understand her.
Annie sighed and Draco let out a triumphant grin. “Fine.” She huffed. “Hand me the stupid thing.” She held out her hand.
As if sensing his insecure nature, Harry entwined his fingers through Draco’s giving them a small squeeze. The gesture was small, but he’d never needed it more.
He wasn’t going to be subjected to the ‘Potter tried to provoke him using first year insults’ incident part two. Not a-bloody-gain.
“It does.” He admitted quietly, “more thank you can imagine. But I can’t let fear stop me from going after the things I know I need. And I need to earn my potions NEWT. I need to socialise with my friends. I need to seek closure. I
Severus growled. “Not everything is a joke, you idiotic boy.” So, he was idiotic and foolish, oh bother! Severus had forgotten devilishly good looking and charming. He'd have to tell him so that Severus could use it in one of their future little talks.
This pained Draco. It really it. He'd always pegged Potter as someone who had it altogether. Despite the odds, he thought him to be a generally calm person.
They all squealed murmuring a chorus of ‘thank you Draco’s’ and Draco smiled at them before making his was towards the Slytherin table.
Surprisingly, Potter had testified on his mother’s behalf, stating that she had saved him that night in the forest. Draco didn’t exactly know how, but he was proud that his mother had stood up for herself, and it was the love in her heart that had gotten her acquitted.
Several moments later, he realised that there were barely any Slytherin’s participating in the battle. Well, he said
Kat nodded and Draco shot her a fond look, “he can’t see you through the phone darling.” He reminded her.
he feel now? He could lie. He could shake his head in defiance and say that he felt absolutely nothing towards Potter.
Draco didn’t have the foggiest idea as to what he was banging on about. “Stop What? Breathing?” he drawled.
His father’s trial had gone better than he’d expected. Draco was certain that his positive publicity had resulted in the outcome. His father had been sentenced to a year in Azkaban as well as been forced to pay a large sum of reparations. His father had been less than happy, but Draco was ecstatic. His father would be free in a year and the reparations had hardly put a dent in the Malfoy fortune.
Ricky shrugged. “Well, I would like to take her on a picnic, and maybe buy her a box of those chocolates she liked so much.” He answered innocently.
He was tired. He was so bloody tired. Of everything. Of the pain. Of the suffering. Of whatever he felt towards Potter. He didn’t exactly know how he felt, but he knew that it was quite strong. There was no point denying it. Draco Malfoy cared about Harry Potter.
Blaise shook his head, “No you’re not, but that’s okay.” He reassured. “Anyways, please think about giving Theo a chance. I think he’d be good for you.”
Draco took an abrupt step back as if burned. “I’m sorry.” He said. “I’m so, so sorry.” He babbled incomprehensively before leaving the common room ignoring Theo’s desperate pleas to come back.
He blamed Potter. Stupid Potter with his stupid glasses and his stupid scar and his stupid, stupid fat dick. Distracting Draco like that. How so very rude!
Theo stared at him; his eyes too full of tears. “Please Draco, speak to me. Please, just tell me what’s going on.” He offered desperately, taking a step towards him.
I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry. The decision to kill Kat has been something I've been battling with since the story began. I really didn't want to do it, but I had to. It makes perfect sense for the story's direction and Draco's character development. Scream and me, shout at me, do whatever. I was in tears after writing this chapter :(
The pad and pencils he was using currently were from a muggle art store. He’d overheard Granger in their fourth year expressing how muggle art equipment was much more efficient than wizarding ones. He found the sudden urge to go and invest in some, reasoning that his love for art was far greater than the hate he had for mudbloods.
Hello, old friend, Draco thought absently as he looked round the room of requirement. It looked the exact same, he supposed some things never changed. He’d come in here in search of Potter, Crabbe and Goyle trailing behind.
The familiar voice in his head sang out, it menacing and frilly. Couldn’t it see? Couldn’t anyone see? He couldn’t fix the cabinet. He wasn’t powerful enough.
It had taken a strength that he didn’t even know he possessed to be able to come out here today. He wanted to run. He wanted to hide. He wanted it to be all over. But he couldn’t. He wouldn’t. He needed to be strong. For the both of them.
Smith let out an anguished cry, before running out of the potions classroom, the door slamming behind him.
Draco shuddered. His words hitting far too close for comfort. Dumbledore thought he knew so much; that he’d had it all figured out. Well he was wrong.
Draco shrugged. “Life is sad. You either die or get the hell over it. And since I don’t really feel like dying, I’ve chosen the latter.” he said defiantly. He decided that he was a dramatic prince and he didn't care who knew it.
“Thank you.” She whispered, “Now we have lots of friends.” Draco couldn’t help but chuckle at the irony. He never thought that he’d see the day when Draco Malfoy was friends with a bunch of Hufflepuff's.
what you did Malfoy.” He snarled as he took a step towards Draco and Draco reflexively took a wary step back .
Draco looked his uncle dead in the eye, “well” he started, “I wasn’t planning on telling them, so unless you’re stupid enough to say anything, I think I’ll be okay.” He mused.
Draco blinked, raising a brow. “Shove it up my asshole.” He deadpanned, taking in Theo’s wide grin. “What the
Hermione slapped him on the arm. “Hey!” Weasley shouted, rubbing his injured arm. “What was that for?” he gave her a scathing look. It was her own fault, no one should come between a man and his chicken.
Tears full of defeat and agony were pouring down his face. His body was shaking, his heart smashed into unfixable pieces. He felt every part of him break as he read what was written just below his own words.
The Weasley twin looked up at the rubble hovering over his head, and back at Draco with complete astonishment. He smiled, before rushing over to Draco, helping him to lower the mound safely.
He sighed. If he were honest when he thought of Potter he didn’t feel anything but deep regret. He regretted the way he’d approached him in their first year. He regretted the years of antagonising and bullying. Draco had been nothing but a narrow-minded bigot, a replica of his father’s beliefs and words. He’d been a parrot, a vessel, an object to carry out the twisted beliefs of the Malfoy’s before him.
He may have let Death Eater’s into Hogwarts. He may indirectly be the reason that the Headmaster is dead. But he’d made peace with his enemies. Become best friends with a beautiful Hufflepuff. He’d risked his life bring food and blankets to the prisoners. He refused to crucio his classmates. He’d saved the Muggleborn’s, Potter and co.
Suddenly, a rouge hex flew past Draco’s head, and he quickly looked up, raising his wand in defence. The battle continued.
She grinned widely before opening up her book. “I see that you’re doing the potions homework. It’s tricky.” She exclaimed. “It took me a good two hours to do, would you like some help?” she asked hesitantly.
Ms Pritchett smiled as turned to face Kat. “And what about you, young miss?” she asked her and Kat blushed, also nodding frantically.
Was it really that hard to believe? Spiders were killing blood thirsty little cretins; they’d kill you without a second thought. “It was a big one.” Draco offered sheepishly.
“No buts.” Draco intervened. “Everybody makes mistakes and does things that they don’t mean.” He reasoned.
“Nothing in particular.” He answered, suddenly feeling quite shy. He’d never shown his artwork to anyone.
“Don’t worry Draco, I know what you need. I know how you like me to kiss you slowly, over and over until you can no longer bare it.” his hands fly up to the sides of Draco’s head, pulling him in for another filthy kiss. “I know how you like putting my fat dick in your mouth like the cockslut you are.” He squeezed Draco’s balled and he moaned, it catching deep within his throat. “I know it all.”
Ah yes, the potions book! It was over a thousand pages long, and he had to shamefully admit, he couldn't
Potter had held Draco when he’d found out, pulling him close and telling him that everything was going to be okay. It was more than Draco deserved.
Draco gave her a sharp nod. Kat beamed. “Please let me have a look.” She asked shifting closer to him. When Draco shifted away, she let out an exasperated breath, “please, please pleaseee.”
Had he been this naïve when he was thirteen? No, not at all. He was just a mean, manipulative, little boy. So… the classic thirteen-year-old.
He had always been and will always be a victim of his environment. Why did he have to live a life that others had dictated for him? Why couldn't he just be free?
Potter snatched Draco’s wand from his hand, “Come on Draco, we have to leave.” He stated gesturing Draco to follow.
Draco felt himself begin to let go. He desperately began riding Harry’s thigh, moaning with every thrust of his hips.
“I’m fine, Potter,” Draco said only to prove Harry right when the vampire winced from the pain he felt when he moved to stand.
A fire suddenly roared to life, casting an orange glow throughout the room. Harry turned back toward the door to find Draco standing in its frame, placing his wand back into his pocket.
Draco heard Harry’s steady footsteps approach him followed by a firm, yet gentle grasp on his hips. Draco didn’t resist when Harry turned him so they were face to face.
They sat separate from the other guests, and Draco did his best to engage in normal conversation with the man sitting next to him. He was surprised to find that the task wasn’t nearly as daunting as he’d originally thought. Draco tried to convince himself that it was the alcohol, but sitting there with Harry, talking and laughing, Draco had felt happier than he had in a long time.
“Hm,” Draco thought for a moment. Everything in Draco’s life was always given to him. He never had to work for what he had. His father never worked so he didn’t have any frame of reference of what it would be like to have a job. “I guess it’s worth a shot.”
“I was surprised to hear from you, but I’m glad you reached out.” Robards said once he was seated at his desk. “Please, have a seat.”
Draco pushed himself inside Harry slowly until he had nothing left to give. He captured Harry’s lips in his and began to thrust hard into the other man again and again. Each of his breaths ended in an erotic groan. Each of Harry’s gradually became louder and Draco increased his pace until he was a whimpering writhing mess under him.
“What are you saying?” Draco asked hesitantly. He feared that he might have been misreading the situation.
“When you’ve been in this business as long as I have you learn to exploit loopholes.” Borgin smiled that slimy smile of his. “When can you start?”
Draco closed his eyes to fully immerse himself in the bliss. When he opened them, he had found that they were in Harry’s bedroom. A moan escaped Draco’s lips has he thought of the almost incomprehensible power of Harry’s magic that never failed to turn him on.
“Please!” He begged. “I really don’t know anything! I’m just a runner. Bloodroot is impossible to get a hold of. Only the ministry has access to it.”
“Why don’t we discuss this further in the bedroom,” Draco pressed his body up against Harry with his hand on the small of the black haired man’s back, holding him in place.
“If you’d told me I’d be inviting you into my bed three years ago, I’d have probably hexed the living daylights out of you,” Draco laughed once his breath stilled.
Draco groaned and rolled onto his back. His head was pounding and his body felt weighed down. Even the simple task of opening his eyes felt like a chore. But he managed nonetheless.
The words sent shivers down Draco’s spine. Everything. He’d wanted everything the man on top of him was willing to give. Harry wasn’t like the other men he’d been with. He wasn’t looking to just get off after a long night of drinking and bad decisions. But at the same time a voice in the back of his head warned him that this was a bad idea.
“I knew training would be demanding, but some of it was just cruel. They would use unforgivables on us nearly everyday, and awful potions when they didn’t. It was their rewritten philosophy that we as Aurors should train with anything we might face in the field. Before we could pass the program they…” Harry’s words trailed off as he tried to form them. “They made us drink The Drink of Despair.” The memories of the horrible things that potion made him see and feel. He had watched all of his loved ones die all over again. It felt as though fire was coursing through his veins. The nightmares that had plagued him after the war became relentless after that. He wasn’t able to get a good nights sleep unaided for months. Even the strongest of sleeping draughts  prescribed to him by the ministry’s mind healers only took the edge off.
“‘Employment opportunities?’” Ron repeated. “Blow through your inheritance already, have we?” He seemed to laugh at the thought until he noticed that Draco was in fact serious. “What makes you think there’s anything here for you?”
Harry looked at Draco and watched as multiple emotions passed over the blonde’s face before landing on anger. If looks could kill, the one that rested on Draco’s face was a death sentence to whoever it was directed at. It was a controlled rage that could only be seen in the fire behind his stormy grey stare. Harry watched as the glass in Draco’s hand shattered in his crushing grip and was once again reminded just how dangerous Draco could be. It fascinated him and terrified him all at once.
“Save it for the Aurors.” Draco spat. “Someone in the city is dealing bloodroot and you’re going to tell me who.”
Draco had barely heard Harry call after him as he pushed his way through the crowd. A part of him wished Harry would just fuck off so he wouldn’t have to face him. But the other part that was glad Harry had chased after him neglected to lock the door.
One moment, both of the men were standing in the middle of the room as if the proximity would strengthen the sting of their words. The next, they were kissing against the wall.
Draco melted at the feeling of Harry’s rough palms on his chest. It was a sensation that, until then, had only been a memory.
“You mean like an auror?” Draco asked. He didn’t necessarily think he was qualified for said position. That and ninety percent of the aurors were people who would be less than willing to work with him.
Leaving Draco to tend to his wounds, Harry wandered down the hall, admiring the gothic architecture as he did. Intricate designs were carved in the woodworkings along the ceiling and down on the floor moldings, Candelabra wall sconces lined the hallway illuminating the space in the dull flicker of candlelight.
Draco tried to think of a retort but was drawing a blank. “Well, you almost kissed me too,” was the best he could come up with.
The man nodded frantically then took off. Draco banged his fist against the wall in frustration. He’d had no leads, but he'd be damned if he let whoever did this get away.
“I’m not sure,” Draco said as he cast a tempus. It was getting late. Still early evening, but the sun was beginning to set.
Harry’s voice was cold. And rightfully so. If the situation were in reverse, Draco would have hexed Harry into oblivion. Draco surely had Robards presence to thank for the other man’s restraint.
“No, wait,” Draco held the door open, trying to ignore the irritated look on Harry’s face as he did. “Can I come in? Please?”
“I’m not out, Draco. Publicly dating a man is a bigger deal to me than it is to you. And as far as I’m concerned my sexuality is no one's business.”
“The owner’s lounge. Unless you’d prefer to fight back the crowd.” Draco smirked and nodded for Harry to follow him up the stairs.
Astoria paused and something between them shifted. Her piercing blue eyes cut into Draco as her expression changed from frustration to sorrow. “Is there someone else?” She asked quietly.
“What?” Draco asked as he tried to ground himself, but his head was so high in the clouds that he didn’t ever think he’d be able to come back down.
Draco sat down crossed legged by the edge of the Great Lake. He breathed in the freshness of the deep winter air. It smelt like heaven.
It had been several months since he’d let the Death Eater’s into Hogwarts and it was now the Easter break. Ever since that day, he’d just felt… empty.
Macmillan nodded. “Yeah, I think she’s wonderful. But she’s too focused on Weasley to even notice me.” He mumbled dejectedly.
Potter had been the last one to take the stand, much to the surprise and dismay of the Wizengamot. He had spoken loudly and with pride as he told all on the nature of his relationship to Draco. He claimed that Draco had been the only thing to keep him going during his fight against the Dark Lord. He provided evidence that he was not under the influence of a love potion or the Imperius Curse. He finished stating that he would never love anyone who wasn’t worthy of his love, and Draco was worthy of the world.
Potter squeezed him a little tighter, “I’m here.” He reassured him softly, his eyes scanning gently over Draco’s face, as if searching for an answer he desperately wanted to find.
Pansy shook her head, continuing to block his path, “you don’t care? You don’t care?” she repeated hysterically and Draco could swear that they were going around in circles.
! What would a Gryffindor do? What would a Gryffindor do? “Erm…” he started nervously, “I saw a spider?” he questioned more than he stated. A spider. Really? Ron Weasley would be proud.
He’d made a choice. One out of fear. Out of pure desperation. Gone was the feeling of pride. Rejected was the tug of loyalty. Crushed his ambitions lay.
himself? “Lavender is single and no longer emotionally attached to Weasley. Go get her.” he urged him, and Draco reckoned that he would make a phenominal coach or something.
They had? He was the one that was actually in the relationship, he surely would've noticed if that were the case, right?
“What’s wrong with you?” a squeak erupted from above him, and Draco looked up to face the creepy girl.
Draco didn’t know what to say, but luckily Potter spoke for him. “I promised you almost two years ago that this ring held a part of me. That it would be there to watch over you when I couldn’t. That it would care for you when you craved it. That it would protect you when you needed it most. That you would always have a piece of me to love and hold you close.” He stated and Draco’s breath hitched.
Draco chuckled. “I’ll try my hardest not to die in the near future.” he joked but when he saw the looks on their faces, he realised that he was being utterly serious.
He pulled back hesitantly, reaching into his pocket, and pulling out the green apple portkey. “This.” He held it up so she could see, “is called a portkey, it’s set to activate once you hold it and it will take you home.” He told her carefully.
He’d been dreading the day that his father would want to get in touch with him. It’s wasn't so much that he didn’t like his father and didn’t exactly want to see him. It was more an issue that he hated his father at present and couldn’t think of anything worse than seeing him.
“Well, let me tell you. I’d never go out of my way to tell you something like this if I were lying. It just isn’t proper.” He wrinkled his nose as if tasting something unsavory.
Draco realised that they were coming to the end of their journey and took a deep breath. “Yes, yes very wonderful indeed. Anyways father, we’re almost at the station so we’re going to have to go.” He told him.
A second finger joins the first, it’s slick and hot, and Draco sucks him in, again and again. He feels as if he were floating, like he’s high on complete bliss. Potter inserts another finger, and Draco’s at a complete loss when he hits the spot deep inside of him. “Uhh…Potter…I need…” He gasped out frantically.
Potter put his arms firmly on Draco’s shoulder’s, holding him in place. “Am I disappointed that you took the mark? Yes. Do I wish that you hadn’t? Absolutely.” He started and Draco was frozen in his place.
“I’m sorry but—” He glanced into big, hopeful eyes and cursed the day that he was born. “But I think Kat would much more enjoy a walk around the castle grounds than a picnic. She likes to move around.” He finished sadly.
“Don’t worry Draco, we’ll come with you and help.” She decided, gesturing for the rest of the Hufflepuff's to follow her.
“Why are you always fucking ignoring me?” he questioned desperately. “Can’t you see that it hurts?” he cried, and Draco froze.
He sighed. “I really don’t want to talk about it.” he muttered, hoping that she would take the bait and leave.
He sat down on his bed, running a tired hand through his silvery locks, what could he do? Perhaps he could seduce the Death Eater in question? Draco shook his head at that, it had too much potential to go wrong, plus Draco wasn’t admittedly looking his best. He could devise a plan to trick the Death Eater? Draco sighed, no that wouldn’t work either, it would take too much time.
Potter opened his mouth to speak, but Draco cut him off. “I’m not a good person. No, I’m a terrible person. I’m giving you a way out. A chance to find someone special. To find someone better than I am. Someone who isn’t a disgusting Death Eater. Someone who isn’t me. Go. Just go.” Draco ordered sadly.
He let out a distressed cough. “Why do you think that?” he queried, genuinely afraid of the answer that he was sure to receive..
Draco chuckled slightly as his eyes fell on Weasley, the git had obviously forgotten to take off his greased stained apron. He still couldn’t believe it. If you had told him nineteen years ago that Weasley would’ve become the first successful chicken expert to ever grace Wizarding society, he would’ve laughed in your face. But nineteen years later, and here he was only buying chicken that had been tested and manufactured by Weasley.
Everyone was looking at him as he passed. He supposed that it was to be expected, no one had seen him since his trial. He didn’t so much mind the looks of love or admiration, he even didn’t mind the odd glare that he would receive. But, what he did mind,
She stared at him; her eyes wide with embarrassment. “Draco.” He sniffed. “I didn’t mean for you to see me like this. I didn’t mean for anyone to see me like this.” she told him and Draco vowed not to embarass nor upset her any more than she already was.
They carried on throwing spells forward and back. Ducking and diving. Screaming and shouting. Draco felt tired. He felt the fight leave him. He felt alone.
Draco was scared. He was scared about his task. He was scared about deceiving Potter. He was scared that he’d never be able to do the right thing.
Abruptly, he stood up muttering his apologies before running out the door straight towards the apparition point, ignoring the concerned shouts and objections that he had left behind.
It had been just over a month since the final battle, and this was the first time that Draco had interacted with anyone who wasn’t his mother or Ms Pritchett. He wouldn’t admit it to anyone, but he was really starting to become quite lonely.
Draco shook his head. “It just doesn’t.” he replied hoping Theo would take the hint and just leave him be.
His mind became fuzzy, his eyes became glassy as his memories were ripped from him. He forgot the smile that Harry only saved for him. He forgot the endless nights they spent wrapped around each other under the nights sky, the stars their only witnesses. He forgot Harry’s laugh. He forgot how Harry felt as he made love to him. He forgot their days together, their notes. He forgot the first time he’d told Harry that he loved him…
Draco sighed dramatically, “Fine Weasley, you win. I’m free on Thursday. Meet me outside the potions classroom at seven, not a moment before or after. Am I clear?”
“And you get a present. And you get a present. And you get a present.” Draco bellowed enthusiastically to a herd of beaming Hufflepuff’s.
It was true. He was only human. He made mistakes. But that was the problem. He'd made too many mistakes, ones that he couldn't come back from.
This was harder than he'd ever imagined. He thought that knowing what he was going to do would make things easier. Would soften the blow. He was wrong. He'd never been so wrong.
His head falls back. He can’t think about anything but Potter’s touch. How it feels to have Potter need him so much.
He was a monster. He was cruel, ugly, and foul. No better than the Dark Lord himself. In fact, he was worse than the Dark Lord. At least he believed himself to be doing the right thing when he committed his misdeeds, Draco knew what he was doing was wrong, but he still did it. He was a coward.
A necklace so innocent but represented the destruction of his own innocence. A necklace that would make him foul, dirty, a killer. A necklace that would result in him living up to his father’s expectations. A necklace that would make him the merciless Death Eater that he’s always been. That he will always be.
Draco eyes softened a facture. “Well, I’d always suspected it, but it just feels so nice to hear you say it out loud.” He gushed smiling like a loon before realising that he was being led off topic.
It was like nothing he had ever experienced. He didn’t know how to deal with it. How to make it make sense. He felt so little, but so much all at the same time.
? He pondered lightly. He could— no, he couldn’t do that, it was too risky. But maybe it would work if— no, no, NO! It couldn’t possibly work. Draco groaned; he was being stupid. It would never work. He flopped down onto his bed in defeat, feeling sorry for himself in every possible way.
In some twisted way, Macmillan had seemed to have grown up a little. Had become a person that he was proud of. Draco would never admit it to anyone, but he was slightly jealous of that.
Macmillan shrugged. “I wouldn’t know. We’re not all that close anymore.” He replied. Draco’s ears perked up because now it was getting interesting.
“Do you want to explain why there’s a bunch of Hufflepuff first years sitting at the Slytherin table?” Pansy asked.
“I’m not even joking. They’re currently running around the castle attacking people with butterflies and promising to spill the blood of whoever hurt you.” He shuddered and Draco suddenly felt fearful for Potter’s safety.
She squealed in glee, “I wonder what it could be?” she asked as she tore open the gift. She gasped as soon as she lay eyes on it. “Oh Draco, it’s beautiful.” she cried, carefully tracing the sketch of herself staring back at her.
Draco blinked, as he frantically darted around to find that he had suddenly forgotten how to breathe. His aunt was looming over Hermione, a manic glint residing in her eyes.
His gaze settled on his husband, who still looked as gorgeous as he had all those years ago. Much had happened during these past few years, Draco had become a potions master, Harry had become an Auror, they’d been given the gift of their children. They’d bickered, fought, smiled, and laughed. But the one thing that had never changed, the
Draco didn’t have that. He had a mother that loved him but smothered him. His mother being too weak to keep him safe. He had a father who said he loved him but beat him. Who had conditioned him to carry out his family duties, ever since he was a young one. He had friends who cared for him but were so entrapped in their own prejudice beliefs to ever go against their families and help him. He had nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. No one to turn to when he needed aid and comfort. He was completely and utterly alone.
Draco sighed. “I really don’t know what to say other than I’m sorry.” he said genuinely. There truly wasn't anything he could say. After all, he seemed to have been to one to cause this mess in the first place.
Perhaps, he had been avoiding the Weasley’s, but that was only because he was sure that he’d run into Potter if he accepted any of the invitations.
“Open them, open them.” She chanted and Draco was absently aware that everyone’s eyes was still one them.
“It was us who asked you to stay away from him in the first place. If we’d known that it would have made him act like this, then we would never have suggested it.” he deduced.
Weasley looked at him as if he were stupid. “To the land of chicken.” He said as if it were obvious, and Draco thought about asking what in the hell that was, but decided against it.
Draco growled. “Ha bloody ha very funny.” He quipped, but it wasn't funny. No, it wasn't funny at all
“It’s not your fault.” Hermione said quickly, “It’s just that he’s rather obsessed with you.” She explained.
“Well I have, ever since I was young. I still do.” He mused. “I didn’t really have anyone when I was younger. My family don’t like me all that much.” He admitted and Draco’s heart broke a little for him.
When he entered the Slytherin common room, he was dismayed to find all eyes on him. He sighed; couldn’t he catch a break?
She growled, “you really are a piece of work Draco Malfoy.” She decided, as if that was meant to offend him.
Draco knew that he couldn’t give into it. He’d just ended whatever the hell this was with Potter. He thought that it would’ve made him feel better, that ending it was the only choice. He still felt that way, but that didn’t make it hurt any less.
“Can’t you see what’s going on here?” she asked, and Draco shook his head. Pansy took a deep breath, “You’re doing what you always do. You’re ignoring the problem hoping that it will go away.”
They stayed like that for several seconds before slowly pulling away. “This is the craft shop.” She inclined her head slightly towards the store in front of them.
It was as if it had all come down to what he would say next. As if, his next few words were to be the decider. Draco was scared. He was afraid that he was going to mess up. So, he said the first thing that came to his mind. He couldn’t think, he just had to act.
“Merlin Draco! What the hell are you going to do with all this chocolate?” he half-laughed, half-sighed.
He looked at Severus pointedly, “And that is?” If he thought about it, messing with old Severus was actually quite fun. A much more efficient way to spend his time then the moping he had calendered in for the day.
That sounded just about right. He was still the person he'd always been, he just didn't have the energy to actively be him anymore.
She nodded slightly. “Don’t thank me. This is all because of you. You accepted us two years ago without a second glance. You let us follow you around, you let us laugh, you let us be a part of something bigger than ourselves. So, thank you.” She squeezed him just that little bit tighter.
Draco looked up, taking in his apologetic features. He nodded, before returning his gaze back onto his work.
know that it was Snape’s book that he was using. Draco couldn’t bare to think what Potter would do if he found out. Oh well, what he doesn’t know won’t hurt him.
Was that as bad a chapter as I thought it was? It wasn't very plotty, I guess I wanted to focus more on Draco's relationships. Sorry if it sucked as much as I think it did. Also, don't worry DRARRY will sort their crap out. I promise!
Draco took a deep breath, this was it. There was no going back, not now, not ever. “They’re letters… that I wrote… for you.” He choked out anxiously. “Read them. They bare all. The good. The bad. The ugly. Everything that I am is in those letters.” He looked up at Potter intently, “and if you still want to be with me once you’ve read them, then yes. My answer is yes.” He said, finally giving himself to Potter.
Draco wanted to hide. Whether or not he loved Harry Potter was none of their business. And what was even worse was they followed him
“Morsen. Ricky Morsen.” He replied and Draco nodded in approval, what a fine way to introduce ones name.
He sobbed louder onto her shoulder. “It’s okay, it’s okay.” She cooed, pulling him even closer. “Everything’s going to be fine. I’m here, I’m here.” She reassured, but he knew it couldn't be. It couldn't be.
He took a deep breath looking at the list. He felt a huge weight fall from his shoulders. He may not be able to stop the Death Eater take over, but he could help in this small way. He would do whatever he had to, in order to make sure that the students at risk remained safe.
He munched half-heartedly on his buttered toast when he felt a small tap on his shoulder. He turned around swiftly to find a smiling Kat.
It wasn’t so much that it bothered him more than it completely terrified him. Truthfully, he had no idea how he was going to act. Was he going to cry? Was he going to laugh? Would he be absolutely fine? He had no bloody idea. He just hated not being in control of this, it left far too much possibility of upset.
Maybe that made him naïve. Maybe it even made him a little bit selfish. But he didn’t care. Everybody had that one thing that kept them going. That one thing that gave them hope. His was Draco.
She smiled and him knowingly, “I know exactly what you’re doing. I’ve seen this many times before.” She commented.
Potter still ignored him during the day. It was either Draco didn’t exist, or that his existence was an inconvenience for Potter. There was no in between. Draco didn’t know how he felt about that. On the one hand, the day hurt. It hurt so goddamn much. To be belittled by Potter, to be cast away like he were nothing.
“Kat?” she questioned intently, an essence of hope dusting her tone, and Draco broke for a second time that day.
If he were honest, Draco didn't think there was a time where he wasn't thinking about Potter. The man had stolen his mind, just as he'd stolen his heart.
He scoffed. “I don’t know why I expected any better.” He snarled. “You’re a coward Malfoy.” He spat. “You’re a fucking coward.” He said once more before stomping out of the Great Hall.
When she was almost that the end of the corridor he shouted, “By the way who’s Ricky?” she blushed quickly hurrying out of sight and Draco laughed. Victory was his!
Her eyes widened. “You haven’t?” she gasped. “But you’ve been in love since Christmas!” she declared.
He raked a distressed hand through his hair, he could do this. He knew that he could do this. “I wanted so much more for you. You deserved so much more. You were so innocent, so pure. You truly represented all that was beautiful from the world. War wasn’t the place for someone like you. It’s bloody and isolated. Cold and haunting. Everything that you were not. Something as repulsive as war and something a breath-taking as yourself, should never have crossed paths.” He choked out.
But he had to keep going. He couldn’t go back and change the beginning, but he could start where he was and change the end. And he chose to be good.
It wasn’t as though he didn’t like his friend, he did. It was just that he had somewhere that he really needed to be. It was around five minutes before curfew, and five minutes before he was sure to be caught for sneaking out of bed.
She carried on, “but now looking at you and hearing what you have to say, I couldn’t be any more confident that you’ll go on to do great things, than I am now. I’m proud of you Dragon.” She told him, tears lacing her voice.
He gave her a confused look, as she carried on. “He spends every minute of his free time looking at your dot of that stupid map of his!” she huffed.
She hit her head for a final down before slamming it down ono the table. “I thought I’d at least preserve some of my dignity and kill myself, instead of letting you dreadful excuses kill me first.”
He smiled in understanding. “Well, I’m not sure what that has to do with it, but I promise that I don’t want to hurt you.” He tried his best to come off as sincere as he felt.
As Draco followed Potter out of the hall, making the first free decision he had in ages, he heard his mother whisper quietly to his father. “I know that was hard Lucius, but part of being a parent is being strong enough to give your child the wings to let them fly.”
? He thought with annoyance. He almost never received any owls from home, so seeing the owl in front of him, filled him with deep dread.
Potter opened his mouth to speak, but Draco abruptly cut him off. “And it’s hard. It’s so bloody hard.  To feel so much for someone but not remember how you fell.” He finished.
Stupid, stupid Hufflepuff’s. Make friends with the Hufflepuff’s Draco. They’re lovely, Draco. Their friendship
Weasley took a deep intake of breath. “You know I still don’t like Malfoy all that much.” He decided. “But Draco. Now he’s someone I could find myself becoming friends with.” He offered with a smile.
“I am hard on you. Not because I don’t care for you. But because I don’t just want you to survive. I want you to
Draco’s eye’s narrowed at the small boy. “Don’t betray my trust.” He warned. “If you harm one hair on her perfect little head, then I’ll hex you so hard you’ll lose your ability to breathe.” He threated, proud of his handywork.
Almost dying does that to a person. But he wouldn't dare admit that to Weasley. He'd had a glimpse of death and he didn't rather fancy seeing it again for a long while to come.
Draco turned round to face him, startled. “I can’t find the bread.” He said simply, diverting his attention back onto the appliance.
He smiled. “Hello, Kat.” He said. “What are you doing here?” he asked her, trying to mask his delight.
He hated him because he was right. Draco’s heart hadn’t been in it. He didn’t want to do it. he still didn’t want to do it. But he had to. He had no choice.
He laughed, “don’t get cheeky with me.” He shot her a sincere look, “I absolutely love them. They’re the best gifts that I’ve ever received.” he said honestly, too shocked to say much more.
He beamed at her. “Thank you, you’re amazing.” He said genuinely, staring to feel himself tire even more.
Oh god. He sounded exactly like his father. What was be becoming? He didn't even know who he was anymore.
“Help!” Potter screamed frantically. “Please, somebody help him.” he bellowed again. “I need him. I need him.” he tried again. “Please. I can’t lose him. I need him. I need him. I need hi—”
He was almost there. She was right in front of him. He was going to make it. He was going to save her.
Draco felt his cheeks start to heat up. No one had been this nice to him in a really long time. Of course, he didn’t agree with her, he knew that he was evil incarnate. Still, it felt good to hear such things.
“No. No. NO!” Potter shouted. “I won’t lose you. I can’t. Not again. You’re coming with us.” He declared as he attempted to pull Draco towards them.
Draco opened his mouth to object but Potter cut him off. “You could have hidden it. You could’ve allowed me to remain oblivious. But you didn’t. You wouldn’t. And that’s what sets you apart from all of the other Death Eater’s. That’s what makes you special.” He scooted even closer to Draco and his breath hitched, his hands becoming clammy.
There was a time where Draco couldn't have dreamed to talk to his father like this. But times had changed. And Draco was done. He was done with his father's crap. He was so, so done!
Blaise glared at him. “And you think you’re helping her like this? That you’re not putting her in harm’s way?” he spat out
His brown curls had been neatly chopped; now sprawled out messily upon his head. His jaw was sharper, his lips just that little bit plumper. Colour had returned to his golden skin, him now radiating warmth. He’d even filled out slightly, his new weight gain adding positively to his already toned physique. Even his blazing green eyes seemed more mesmerising than ever.
It was now one day before he’d be boarding the Hogwarts express, and be on his way to Hogwarts. He was nervous. He was really, really nervous. He’d spent most of the summer cooped up in the Manor, except from the many Weasley family dinners that he had attended.
Draco opened his mouth to object but was cut off by a sharp glare. “If you’re going to give me some rubbish about letting Death Eater’s into Hogwarts, then please be quiet. You didn’t have a choice in the matter. But with what you did have a choice in, you chose to be good. That speaks volumes.”
“You’re late.” Potter stated as Draco sat down next to him. Draco ignored him, focusing his gaze on the sketchbook beneath him.
Draco turned to face the bloodied body that was his aunt, he took a deep breath. “I’m already tainted.” He growled out defiantly.
His aunt gazed at Potter and her grandson lovingly, before giving Draco a knowing glance. “He looks really happy, doesn’t he?” Draco didn’t trust himself to speak, so he gave her a quick nod.
“Besides,” Potter carried on, “No one declines Mrs Weasley’s food.” He narrowed his eyes at Draco, “
“You’re an idiot Draco. You’re a complete and utter idiot.” He snarled. “He has your mother; you narrow minded fool. How long do you think he’s going to keep her alive?” He spat and Draco felt sick.
So, the moral of the story was that it was all Draco’s fault. He was stuck at the manor antagonizing over Potter who was probably in Romania forgetting all about him. You know what they say, karma really was a bitch.
They were Potter's family, he desperately craved their acceptance. And he wasn't sure that he was going to get it, especially after all he'd said and done to them.
Panicked, Draco backed himself into a corner, before tripping and falling to the ground. Well, he’d done it now. It was over. He was all Potter’s now. Potter would probably even AK Draco. Not that he minded all that much, he deserved it.
He sighed. “Can you believe that the little bugger is in love with Kat?” he asked, still not being able to get his mind round it.
Mr and Mrs Weasley had also to his surprise testified on his behalf, claiming that he was one of the most beautiful souls that they had ever come across. Mr Weasley had told the court about his fascination with muggle technology, stating that a heartless Death Eater wouldn’t dare be so obsessed with muggle things. He’d even brought the toasterer as evidence. Mrs Weasley had further commented on his actions during the final battle, disclosing the moment they’d had together as well as times he’d fought for the light. After they’d finished their testimonies, they’d both sent him warm, loving smiles which he greatly appreciated.
Potter raked a hand through messy black curls. “You confuse me Malfoy. You confuse me so bloody much. This is your fault; this is all your fucking fault.” he told him.
Draco gave her a loving smile. “You already make me happy.” He said honestly, because she did. Make him happy, that it.
“Excellent.” Blaise purred as they sat on one of the couches. “So, pray tell, do you have anything to do with why Theo looks as if his crup’s just died?” he asked.
She gave him a hesitant smile, “if you still love him, then you should be with him. We all made you happy, but he made you the happiest.” She declared before turning on her heel and rushing into the store.
He’d refused to eat. He’d refused to sleep. He’d refused to talk. Everything reminded him of Draco. He saw his smile in the flowers. He saw his hair in the sun. He felt his love through the stars.
“It wasn’t all that great before.” He started. “He didn’t much talk to me. He didn’t really interact with me. But at least he bloody well acknowledged my existence!” he huffed out.
Luna, Ollivander, and Dean had testified about the months they spent at the manor and how Draco never failed to sneak in food, water, and blankets that had essentially saved their lives. Ollivander also described how Draco would teach prisoners how to successfully fake being hit with a crucio, on their first night at the manor. Whilst Luna spoke about how he would always keep prisoners company well into the night, something he didn’t have to do and could’ve been killed for.
They all laughed and dissolved into mindless chatter. Draco was watching them contently, joining in when necessary, when Kat came and pulled him into a hug.
He looked over at his aunt hovering over his best friend, a menacing glint in her eye. He couldn’t save her. He couldn’t save anyone. He couldn’t even save himself.
Granger shook her head. “No, I don’t think so.” She considered. “We’ve been talking for quite a bit of time, and not once have you said anything insulting or aggressive.”
After the disaster that was the whole necklace debacle, oh yes, had he mentioned that he had failed?
Hermione glared at him. “Ronald Weasley. It’s only been ten minutes. Do you want to pass your exams or not?” she huffed pointedly, and Draco feared he already knew Weasley's answer to that.
He remembered how that conversation had gone. Draco had been more frustrated than ever. He felt alone, abandoned, as if a chunk of him was missing but he hadn’t known what. Now he realised that that piece had been Potter, but back then he hadn’t known that.
“I went from hating your existence to being in love with you. How does that bloody work? I love you, but I still hate you. I still see you as my arch nemesis. I hate that you rejected my hand all those years ago. I hate the attention that you get. I hate that you played a role in my father’s imprisonment in Azkaban. I hate how you laughed at me, how you taunted me, how you called me names.” He admitted, getting it all off his chest.
Draco suddenly felt extremely uncomfortable. He was selfish. Potter had cancelled his plans, missed out on spending time with his family, just so that Draco didn’t spend Christmas alone. He’d even gone as far as to accept the Weasley’s invitation for Christmas, when Draco had been too afraid to.
He bit back a scoff. It was only natural that the boy who lived to be a pain in Draco’s ass looked like a damn god, whereas Draco was sure that he looked like a shrivelled shrimp.
He tore at her dress. Clawing it frantically. He had to find the wound. If he found the wound then he could save her. She wasn’t dead. SHE WASN’T DEAD!
“I’m a mess.” Draco pointed out. “I need time to find myself. To understand myself. To accept who I am without my memoires.”
“A second chance.” She breathed out, a single tear escaping from her grasp. “Before we only knew today. We knew then then, and the right now. We knew strength. We knew how to fight. We were well acquainted with the present.” She carried on unwavering.
The Slytherin’s as well as the rest of the students stared at them in shook. He didn’t blame them, for the little girl next to him was making history before their very eyes. Never, in the whole of Hogwarts, had a Hufflepuff sat at the Slytherin table.
Draco chuckled. “Yes, I can assure you that I do. In fact, if I were you, I’d feel extremely proud to be in Hufflepuff.” He gave her a small smile as he forcefully tried to prevent himself from turning green with disgust.
Four silent words were plastered onto the drawing’s back. Four words that spoke an abundance of truth.
you to be supportive of my life choices once in a while.” He huffed, and Draco had to admit, they sounded like a bloody married couple.
“Don’t die on me.” He begged her, in between healing charms. “Not you. I’ve already lost so much. I can’t lose you too.” He pleaded with her.
He was on the verge of digging into some scrumptious sausages when the Malfoy family owl landed right in front of him.
He sets a rhythmic pace, perched in Potter’s lap, grinding away on his cock. He absently wonder’s if he could make Potter come like this. He groans at the thought. Potter’s eyes start to lose focus, his breath catching in his throat, as he lets out a deep moan deep from within his chest.
He had spent so much time by himself. He'd spent so long thinking that he was alone. It was nice to think that they were there for him. That they understood him. Even though deep down he knew that they didn't. He was certain that they never would.
Draco carried on. “I understand that it must be disheartening knowing that you were tossed into Hufflepuff because you was hardly wanted by the other house. That must’ve hurt but it’s okay.”
He can feel his erection, hot and hard just begging to be set free. He squirms in his lap, pressing against his length again and again, Potter’s eyes becoming glassy with desire. He wants him. He only wants him.
Not speaking to Potter was a safety blanket. A protection for Draco’s heart. He’d denied Potter communication all because he was scared. Well, he wouldn’t be scared anymore. He couldn’t.
house and tell me that my daughter’s dead. How could you lie about something like this? I don’t even know you. I don’t fucking know you.” She murmured the last part desperately. In complete denial, pleading for a way for this all to be just a dream. Draco wished with all his heart that it were.
His emotions towards Potter were all messed up. He was so confused. It was as if he’d forgotten the years they’d spent antagonising each other and now saw him as a beacon of hope. It was strong. He just felt so strongly towards Potter. He didn’t understand it.
He looked up, coming face to face with the rather repulsive faces of Ernie Macmillan and Zacharias Smith. Had Merlin not punished Draco enough?
Ms Pritchett shook her head, taking a deep breath. “My daughter wasn’t always the beautiful, happy young girl that you knew her as.” She started. “She was heavily bullied at her old school. She was different. And the other kids didn’t like that.” She admitted quietly.
He knew that it was a lot to ask. He knew that a Death Eater like him hardly deserved something as beautiful as happiness. But he was willing to try.
“I know what you need.” Potter reassures him, whilst stretching him to completion. Draco’s eyes roll to the back of his head in complete pleasure.
She gave him a sceptical look. “Then why did you call me here?” she questioned, and he braced himself for what he was about to say next.
“So, I’m sure you all know why I’ve called you here today.” he told them seriously as he entered the abandoned classroom.
you’re not this dense Draco. I didn’t say that you had a problem with Potter. I vividly remember stating that Potter was your problem.” She huffed out in frustration.
“Damn it! I didn’t get anyone except Hermione and Weasley presents.” He moaned. Trust him to completely forget to buy a few extra last minute gifts. Actually, it was quite unlike him.
Blaise grinned. “I call bullshit on that pathetic excuse. Now, tell me the real reason that you rejected Theo.” he prodded.
you to this to us. To me? I hate you. I hate you so much.” She choked out and Draco couldn't help but frown.
Currently, there was a Death Eater patrolling his bedroom door and Draco was pissed. He had to get out of there. He had to be apart of the battle. He owed it to the Hufflepuff's. He owed it to his family. He owed it to Kat…
He wrapped an arm around the girl, “But you are helping, by staying safe and alive. I don’t know what I would do if anything happened to you.” He said honestly.
Without a word, he stood up and walked away. He didn’t need to listen to this bullshit. Draco felt a deep satisfaction to be the one to leave Potter alone. It was petty, but he didn’t care.
Draco was doing the right thing. He knew that he was doing the right thing. He had to believe it. He had to. Because he couldn’t afford to be wrong. If he was, then he’d lost everything for nothing. And Draco wouldn’t be able to live with that.
Potter laughed. “Because bread goes off after a few days. The contraption is useful, and muggles don’t have magic.” He reminded Draco gently.
“I hate it. I hate it so much. I just want it to stop. I want everything to stop.” He howled in pain.
“Oh,” Kat said dejectedly whilst pulling out a neatly wrapped square box, “I’m sorry about the cauldron.” She handed him the present. “This isn’t a cauldron, but I hope you like it.” she muttered shyly.
She looked terrible. Her hair was matted upon her head, her cheeks were hollow and worn, her walk had a slight limp. He had done that. He had done that to her.
Potter let out a scoff. “What’s wrong with you Malfoy?” he asked, “why won’t you answer me?” Draco remained silent.
that he had to stay strong because no one could fix him. But he was tired of waiting. Tired of having to be the one to fix himself and everyone else. Tired of being strong. And for once, he’d just want it to be easy. To be simple. To be helped. To be
He was crazy, a complete nutter. A spontaneous, angry, idiot who was currently ranting and raving like a bloody lunatic.
Speaking about Potter, the git wouldn’t leave him alone. He stared at him during classes, he followed him in the corridors, he glared at him in the Great Hall. It was all very confusing.
Draco smirked. “Well of course, it is. I made it.” He boasted and Severus shook his head. “Anyways, I must be off, places to go, people to see, Headmaster’s to kill. I’m very busy.” He mocked walking towards the door.
. The Headmaster had known all this time and he hadn’t done anything. That angered Draco. He could’ve stopped him. Intervened. Even killed him. But he hadn’t he let Draco descend down the path into darkness, sell his soul to the devil himself. He hadn’t saved him.
“Then what’s wrong?” he questioned intently, taking her hands in his in an attempt to make her feel safer than she obviously felt.
Was he really that transparent. Didn't Blaise realise? It was obvious that Draco didn't deserve it. It was something that wasn't up to him. His choices had been taken from him a long time ago.
He sighed. “Weasley is absolutely besotted with you.” He assured her. “He doesn’t look at anyone but you. He doesn’t even speak about anyone but you. Hell, he even does his homework when you ask him to.” He declared, spitting out the hard facts. “If that isn’t love, then I don’t know what the fuck is.” He mused.
“Of course, not you idiot. The Hufflepuff's! Stop stealing the Hufflepuff's.” Smith exclaimed and Macmillan nodded. A nod? Really? A bloody nod! Was this guy mute or something?
Draco’s eyes started to well with tears, “it was my fault. I’ve lost him, and it’s all my fault.” He choked out in realisation.
Hermione and Weasley were waiting for him outside of the Slytherin common room, worry dusted their faces.
It was small and white, with a patch of light blue hair dusting its stomach. To Draco, it represented all that was pure in the world. All that the world could
He spoke of that fateful day at the manor and the way Potter had acted. He revealed the first time that Potter had told him that he loved him. He even admitted the first time that he said those three words to Potter. He spoke of the Weasley’s. He told his father about the last words he had said to Potter. He told him about the letters…
He sighed, “okay, tell me what’s wrong.” He told him and Draco decided to continue to act completely detached.
Like hell was he going to stay in this mouldy old room just because Potter told him to. Who the hell did Potter think he was? No, Draco was going straight back out there to fight, whether perfect Potter liked that or not.
It had all been a lie. It had all been a fucking lie. He didn't want to believe it, he didn't want to let that part of him go.
Draco took a deep breath before properly facing Potter. “Well, of course it is, who else would it be?” he snapped and Potter shook his head before bringing him in for a tight hug.
Draco turned on his heel, making his way slowly towards the Slytherin dungeons. It was probably past curfew, but for once he found that he really didn’t care.
Draco nodded. “I understand perfectly, but I like my Hufflepuff’s and I’m keeping them.” He said firmly.
This was it. This was what his father had meant. This was closure. He knew that he’d never stop grieving. For grief was the price to pay for love. But he was healing. He’d never forget his best friend, but he’d heal. It was the only option.
He was such an idiot. He wanted to ask for help, he wanted to so badly. Why couldn’t he do it? What was wrong with him? He knew that he should stop this nonsense and confide in the Headmaster. But he wouldn’t, no, he couldn’t. And he didn’t know why.
. But he wouldn’t be. And he’d still be wishing. And he’d still be staying strong, with tears in his eyes. He was
Blaise sighed. “Draco, you have got to stop denying yourself things because you think that you don’t deserve it.”
She nodded. “Yes. And don’t you forget it.” she threatened. “So, tell me what on earth is going on. Is it Potter?” she asked and he felt a bout of annoyance.
He smirks before grabbing hold of Draco’s feet and placing them onto his shoulders. He groans nudging his way between his legs with hot licks and open-mouthed kisses. Fuck. Potter licks his lips before swallowing him whole.
Why was Potter doing this to him? Why was he saying these things? Words that meant so much. Words he couldn't take back. Words that gave him
Listening, even if it were only for a few moments. He had to know. He had to know if Potter was safe. Potter gave him hope. If Potter were alive then everything would be alright. The Dark Lord wouldn’t take over. And Draco would be okay. Even if that was in Azkaban. At least he would be alive.
“Well I think you’re stupid.” The boy spat and Draco would’ve hexed him if he didn’t remind him so much of his former self.
“It’s been a day Malfoy. Only a day since you ‘broke’ off whatever the hell was going on with you two and Harry’s a mess.” he gave Draco a look of concern.
She took a deep breath. “I’ve done everything. I laugh at his stupid jokes. I help him with his homework. I glam myself up with makeup. But he still doesn’t notice me.”
Draco took a deep breath and glanced at both of them apologetically, “I truly am sorry. I’ve just needed a bit of time for myself.” He admitted quietly.
What did he expect him to say. 'Sorry I'm a tad bothersome, you know, nerves from plotting to kill the Headmaster and all that.' He had a sneaky suspicion that wouldn't go down to well...
He growled. “How do you know what I am?” He spat with fury. “I’ve done things that would shock you.” He seethed. Because how did the old man know? How could he not see what Draco was? He was a coward. He was manipulative. He was a Death Eater. He didn’t deserve to be understood. No, he deserved to rot.
In fact, he downright envied Macmillan. He too, wished that he could become the person that he'd always wanted to be, a person that he was proud of.
. It all made sense. It had been his only physical comfort during the war. It kept him close when he was sad, it glowed when he was happy, it kept him safe when he was scared. It went cold when the war seemed lost…
Kat nodded before she grinned widely. “I knew I could make you happy.” She cheered before sitting next to him.
He was currently in the Slytherin dorms in his bed, letting the tears fall freely. He didn’t know what to do. He didn’t know what to think. What was going on with Potter? What had Draco done to make him feel as he did?
Another cry erupted, louder and more pained this time. He shivered remembering the first time this had happened and he’d come face to face with a crying Kat. Stopping, he thought, had been one of the best decisions of his life.
Draco had ‘bumped’ into Potter more times than he could count, and it was only midday. He’d didn’t rather fancy bring up the consequence that Potter’s stalking had on the little task the Dark Lord had set him.
Her eyes widened, glistening with something other than desperation, something that looked a lot like acceptance. “Take me to her. Take me to my little girl.” She asked in defeat and all Draco could do is oblige as he held out a hand to take them both to a place he’d never wanted to go back to.
“Good evening, Draco.” The Headmaster acknowledged cordially, and it made Draco’s stomach churn. Didn’t he realise? Couldn’t he see what Draco was about to do?
“That sounds like a very wise idea.” She started. “Why don’t you start with your potions homework? It’s one of the required NEWTs when becoming an auror, anyways.” She suggested and Weasley nodded, before promptly starting his work.
He could see it now: and this kids is how Draco Malfoy single handedly drove Theodore Nott off the edge. He was sure that it would become a fan favourite.
Her words meant everything to him. The one thing he’d always wanted to do was make his parents proud. And knowing that not one but both his parents were proud of him, that they accepted him… well, that made him accept himself as well.
Theo shrugged. “Maybe, but maybe not. Anyways, please Draco speak to me, give me a chance.” He whispered pleadingly.
He shook his head looking down at his feet. Why didn’t she understand? Why didn’t anybody understand?
Theo pulled Draco close, “It’s okay.” He whispered soothingly. “Everything’s going to be okay. I promise.” He repeated, absently stroking Draco’s hair.
He sighed; his father wasn’t finished yet. “Stupid Potter.” He mumbled. “Stupid Potter, and his stupid hair and his stupid scar.” He bit out and Draco couldn’t contain his laughter for one second longer.
Draco looked at her feeling completely bemused.  “I don’t understand. You hate me. I’ve been awful to you.”
That was it. That was one of the things he loved about most about her. Forgiveness. Her ability to forgive, and not just for her own self gain. No, she genuinely forgave. Honestly, she was already a better person then Draco could ever hope to be.
She howled with laughter, pushing her face so close to his that their lips were almost touching. “If you get a chance..” she said in an odd calm tone, “Say hi to the little voice in your head for me.” His aunt sneered before returning back to Kat.
Defeated, Draco nodded. “I’m just so confused. So many of my friends are telling me all about this great and wonderful romance that I shared with Harry Potter. But I can’t remember any of it.” He looked up at his mother with pleading eyes, “how do I know my feelings are real if I don’t remember how I got them?” he asked.
“Harry!” Hermione snapped, glaring at him with her arms folded tightly across her chest. Weasley was there too, looking at his best friend with shame.
No, he’d never been alone, he’d had the stars. They’d always been his friends. He’d played with them, laughed with them, confided in them. They made him feel safe, wanted, loved. He’d always believed that there was someone up there, watching over him and keeping him safe.
Draco, just problem.” She chastised, glaring at him intently. “A Potter problem to be exact.” She finished with a knowing smirk.
He felt useless. Worn. Torn. He really was a puppet. But it wasn’t his father, no, it had been his aunt Bella all along.
Draco secretly agreed because if the past week had shown him anything, it was that Potter was nothing but transparent.
He also couldn’t comprehend his sudden obsession with Potter. How he was drawn to Potter, or the sudden feelings he had for Potter. It was if they had come out of nowhere.
He turned his attention back to the wide eyed girl who let out a questionable chuckle, “You don’t seem very happy.” She observed.
Blaise nodded. “That name does sound awfully familiar.” He gave Draco a sceptical glance, “how the bloody hell did you know that?” he asked and now it was Draco's turn to act smug.
Draco blinked a few times. Kat never ceased to amaze him. He honestly wondered how such a small girl could be so perceptive.
But then again, the cabinet had already mocked him and taunted him, who’s to say that it wasn’t laughing at him? Draco took another look. Merlin! It really was laughing at him. The dent wasn’t just a smile. No, it was a full-on throaty laugh. There was no way on this goddamn planet that it was just a smile. A dent that big couldn’t be anything less than a laugh. He was sure of it.
Well, that was all going to change. Draco suddenly felt a protective urge wash over him, “why are you telling me this?” he snapped out.
Draco shook his head, “you’re right, I have gotten lots of gifts before.” He started and her face fell. “But I have never gotten any gifts as special as the ones you’ve brought me. Thank you. Thank you so much.”
“Ginevra Molly Weasley!” Mrs Weasley huffed. “I’ve taught you better than that.” She said pointedly.
“Are you seriously not going to speak to me.” He repeated again, “after all that?” he gave a defeated sigh.
…” Draco whispered quietly, eyes shining with tears. “I remember.” He choked out and Harry’s eyes widened with pure disbelief. “I remember.” He repeated. “I remember how I fell in love with you. I remember it all.” he vulnerably breathed out.
lying about the portkey, I’m not lying about the Death Eater’s. You’d be dead either way.” he stated firmly, reasoning that part was entirely true.
He took a deep breath, “Kat I’m very grateful that you like me enough to distance yourself from your friends.” He started, “but you’re a great person and you deserve to share your friendship with so many others, not just me.”
He could feel his resolve start to crumble. It wasn't fair! Why did this always happen to him? Why couldn't he just be normal. He wouldn't even mind being a muggle. They seemed so loving, so carefree. It sounded like a life that would benifit him greatly.
“A chicken specialist.” She hissed, again giving Weasley a murderous glance, and Weasley nodded. “Why would you want to throw your life away like that?” she seethed.
Toilet? He could share her toilet. In order to do that he'd need to be dead, and if Draco was dead then... he shivered, he didn't want to think about that.
Jerry nodded mutely, and Draco shoot him a vicious mile. “Good.” He carried on, “anyways, I need them for my Muggle class project.” he lied through his pearly white teeth, hoping they wouldn't ask any questions.
As soon as he got back to the manor, he felt tears start to form in the crests of his eyes. He was tired, he was so, so tired, and it was only midday.
Draco smiled softly. He was happy that the girl felt so strongly about him, over the past few days she’d become very special to him. Like the little sister he’d never had. Nevertheless, he couldn’t let her put any potential friendships on the line for him. After all, he’d be leaving in two years and she’d be staying for the next five. Of course, he’d write her, but it wasn’t the same as being with her in person.
On the sketch, her pupils were wide, full of joy, her brown hair was falling onto her face, her cheekbones were raised and strong. And her smile. Her stunning smile was larger than life, lighting up her entire face. She was the epitome of pure innocence and beauty.
thought about it. He tried to poke holes in his father’s conclusion. Pansy or Blaise could have done it. But… they couldn’t perform occlumency. He knew for a fact that Weasley couldn’t have executed something like that. And Hermione possibly could’ve carried it out, but she most definitely would’ve told them by now, the guilt being all too much. Plus, he sincerely doubted that a bunch of mini Hufflepuff first years had the magical capability to perform such a complicated task.
In fact, he couldn't really bring himself to care about anything much. And his ability to turn off, to detach himself like that. Well... it scared him.
Fleur laughed. “Dhere iz nothing wrong with za little bit of sauzage.” She glanced fondly at a blushing Bill before biting into a fat, juicy sausage.
A bunch of innocent first years who were most probably ignorant to the possibility of real loss, and to hear that someone they questionably looked up to, that they cared about had been perhaps fatally hurt, well... Draco didn't want to think about how that must've felt.
Draco nodded before pulling off his blanket and getting out of the bed. Like hell was he going to stay here any longer than he needed to.
He turned around, sobbing into her shoulder. It hurt so much. Jerry may have gotten under Draco’s skin, but he was just a boy. He was a Hufflepuff. He was
Greg sent him an apologetic glance as he gathered up his things and made his way towards the Weasel. Both he and Potter shot daggers at him as he sat down. Great, it must be his lucky day. Not only did he have one grumpy Gryffindor, but he had two. Bloody two for one. Maybe Dumbledore will fall down the stairs and break his neck, then he’d really be having a lucky day. For all the Dark Lord knew, Draco could’ve ‘pushed’ him. There, job done. Finished. Finada. Dumbledore no more!
Ah! This girl had a little piece of Slytherin in her. You couldn't tell him differently. He wouldn't hear of it.
He sat up, beginning to discard of his robes and shirt, revealing his toned physique and Draco groaned with appreciation. “Fuck, Draco.” He breathes as he goes on to work on his belt buckle. His cock is stands proud and erect. The same thick, pink masterpiece that he’s seen so many times before.
that. Stupid git said he had to do something so he’d not coming back till tomorrow.” Weasley bit out in frustration. He furrowed his eyebrows, “don’t try and distract me.” He turned to Pansy and Blaise, “I expect a handwritten apology by tomorrow.” He simply stated.
Draco had been having a pretty average dinner in the Great Hall when the Gryffindor table had erupted into a bout of screams and shouts.
Suddenly, he stopped in his tracks, coming face to face with the last person he wanted to see. With someone he hated even more than he hated the Dark Lord. With the woman who killed Kat.
Draco’s face fell slightly. “Sometimes he’s mean to me. Sometimes he calls me pathetic or a Death Eater. He does things he know will upset me. It hurts when he’s like that.” He saw the scared look on her face. “But that’s only sometimes. And it’s only during the day. At night he’s perfect. At night he makes me happy.” He tried to reassure her.
Her eyes glistened with happiness as she smiled. “And then she met you.” She gave him a thankful look, and Draco shook his head to oppose her. “She would write to me everyday about her new best friend. Someone who didn’t care that she was different. She spoke about your talks, she spoke about all the new friends you’d made for her, she spoke about you making her happy.” She brought Draco in for another hug.
Draco’s heart flutters, and at that moment he doesn’t want to feel anything else. He wanted to feel Potter’s cock buried deep into his tight heat. He wanted to feel Potter lose control. He wanted to feel connected to Potter in every way.
Scared, Draco abruptly pulled away. “What in Merlin’s name do you think you’re doing?” he sneered angrily.
He laughed, “Anyways, Potter what on earth are you doing here?” he said once again in that terribly offensive tone. Draco did not sound like that!
“You will choose one of the designated potions that can be found in your study books, once you have chosen, you will have until the end of the Christmas term to complete it.” Draco inwardly groaned. Three months. Three months in the Weasel’s company. That’s not even mentioning having him as a work partner in class for the whole year. Could his life get any worse?
Draco sighed and attempted again. “Father, can you hear me?” he asked whilst seriously debating whether or not slamming his head against the window beside him was an appropriate action at present. After careful consideration, he decided against it. He was not potentially messing up his hair for anybody.
It wasn't that he didn't want to go with Potter, of course he waned to go with him. But he couldn't. Not after what he was about to do. As much as it broke him, this thing with Potter had an expiration date.
His father shot him an incredulous look. “Friend!.” He hissed. “My son, the Malfoy heir, a somewhat honourable Death Eater friends with a mudblood. A Hufflepuff, no less.” He growled at him in pure disbelief.
“Anyways,” Draco continued, “Let’s go, these presents aren’t going to deliver themselves.” He made his way out of the dorms.
One minute they were at each other’s throats and the next they were acting as if they were the best of friends. Draco could hardly keep up.
It all suddenly became far too real. He was doomed. He’d never be able to fix that blasted cabinet. His life, his father’s, his
One hour later and with a belly full of chicken, Draco had almost made it to the Slytherin dungeons.
Just as they were about to exit, the first years came to a halt turning back round. Kat coughed loudly. “If anyone else dares harm one hair on Draco’s head, just remember that you’ll have us to deal with.”
The Headmaster took a deep breath. “What brings you here, on this fine spring evening?” he asked and Draco wanted to hurl.
Alas, Draco was phenomenal at covering up his feelings and that is why he was still alive listening to Potter’s embarrassing babbling.
Potter had been his whole life ever since he started Hogwarts. Their jabs and taunts. Their spits and spats. It had all been about him. It always had.
He decided, that if he were given the choice, then he would’ve gone back for Crabbe. He’d always go back for him. He’d rather die trying to protect his friend then live with regret. He closed his eyes, admitting defeat, he’d be with Kat soon.
“Draco?” his father called out. “I can barely hear you.” He pointed out, and Draco finally realised what the problem was. He chuckled slightly; his father really wasn’t the brightest button in the pot.
“But you don’t take Muggle studies.” Jerry remarked and Draco hated the law that said you couldn’t castrate children. Very inconvenient, that was.
Draco was sitting at the Great Lake, the stars shining down on him protectively. He had his sketchbook on his lap, and a pencil in his hand. He mused that it had been such a long time since he had drawn anything. He missed it. Losing himself in his own little world, away from the clutches of reality. It was his escape, and he was thankful that it was still there for him to go to.
She’d come in just after he had finished crafting one of his many letters to Potter. ‘Is everything okay mother?’ he’d asked her in concern. She’d slowly shook her head, tears spilling down her cheeks as she collapsed onto his lap.
Mrs Weasley shook her head, “I don’t want any excuses. We’re getting ready for Sunday dinner as we speak. You
Draco took a deep breath, “Ms Pritchett?” he asked hesitantly. His mind whirling with anticipation, as he feared for what he was about to do.
“It seems as though everything was lost. That everything was taken from us. Ripped from our clutches. And in a sense, the war did do that. It tore down the life we once knew, the life that we had become accustomed to. Throwing us away as if we were broken and used. We didn’t have much, but at least we had something.” Her voice started to shake and Draco could tell that she was holding back the tears.
After transfiguration, Draco brushed any attempts that Vincent and Greg made for him to join them in the common room. He gave them the pathetic excuse that he needed to do something. And that is how Draco now found himself, sketchbook in hand, sitting under a tree. Alone.
He looked at both Hermione and Weasley, secretly pleading for a little bit of help. Hermione sighed apologetically, whilst Weasley gave him a teasing smirk.
“I’m not.” He answered simply. What else could he say? Lie? He was affirmative that he was that of a transparent nature.
Draco was feeling very emotional. He didn’t want to let Kat venture into the world alone. She was still too young. Too innocent. She couldn’t be corrupted. That’s it, he’d tell Ricky no. He could do that.
Draco knew what they were saying was right. Potter and he were both broken. They were both fragile, full of deep hurt and destruction. He should stay away. He knew that he should stay away.
“Of course!” he yelled deliriously. “ Of fucking course, you won’t take accountability for your actions.” He swore. “Jokes on me, huh? For clinging onto that little piece of hope that you actually cared about somebody other than yourself. I’m such an idiot.” He snarled.
“Why would I do that, anyone would take my flawless hands over your overworked ones.” He bit out innocently. “Although, I may take you up on your whole looking at myself in the mirror idea, I truly am something to be admired.” He uttered boastfully.
His father shook his head, his eyes wider than Draco had ever seen them. “You must not think like that. I will not let you.” He spat.
Kat laughed. “Well it’s not as if Draco’s silly enough to get himself in a situation like that in the first place. He’d very smart.” She preened.
He gave his friend a pleading look, “the Dark Lord wants to be the one to finish him. It’s his right, we can’t take that away.”
Draco was a man on a mission. Well he was a man on a lot of missions, but one served to be of the upmost importance at the present moment.
He took in Potter’s words. Telling Potter to be sure. Essentially telling him to leave, had in one sense been one of the biggest mistakes he had ever made. But, ultimately, it had given him the courage to find himself. It had given him the strength to accept himself. And love was only made possible through acceptance.
He could say that he’d made a family in the Weasley’s, they treated him as if he were a part of it anyhow. At times, he felt guilty of how he used to view and speak about them, but now he felt as if he was making up for it. He was immensely glad that he had distanced himself from his bigotry views, that decision had allowed him to love and befriend the most wonderful people.
The boy let out a scared yelp, rubbing his palms nervously together. “It’s… just well I kind of, just a little bit, think that Kat’s…. really pretty.” He choked out and Draco blinked feeling confused.
He nodded. Tears sliding down his cheeks as he looked at the broken face of a woman hoping that her child was alright. That her child was
Severus’ features softened whilst he contemplated his answer. “Well, I must say Mr Malfoy, you never fail to surprise me. I admit, that does sound like an acceptable plan.”
If Draco was in the corridor with his Hufflepuff’s then Potter was hidden behind a pillar. If Draco was in class, then Potter was waiting outside. If Draco was alone… well, he didn’t want to think about that.
looked at me. You didn’t see the Slytherin Ice Prince or Death Eater scum, no, you saw me. Just Draco.” He let out a weak smile. “It was the first time that anyone had really understood me. That anyone just wanted to get to know me for myself.”
Her eyes glisten with silent tears as she lowered her head in what Draco assumed was shame. “I wanted to be like you Papa. I wanted to be like Daddy too. But I’m not. I’m different. I’m a Hufflepuff.” She whispered the last part quietly.
They sat there for several moments in silence before his aunt spoke again, “it’s your Black side.” She stated and Draco gave her a baffled look. She sighed, “It’s because you’re a Black, that’s why you’re holding back.” She said simply.
“I really don’t appreciate such an aggressive tone. I’ve hardly done anything to warrant such rudeness.” He challenged.
Quickly, he pulled his wand own, his body slowly filling with anger and resentment. “Get out of my way.” He ordered.
Weasley looked down at the grinning girl. “So, when did the Hufflepuff first-years turn into an army?” he asked her innocently and Draco repressed a sigh. He noted that Weasley really could be quite oblivious when he wanted to be.
“That’s it?” she exclaimed, her face going red. “I dethrone you and you brush it off like it’s nothing?” she growled at him.
The last few days before the end of term past by quickly, and before Draco knew it, he was alone in the Slytherin dorms.
Draco scoffed. “Well, yes I do believe that’s what the badge says Severus.” he fought the urge to laugh. He was quite proud of that one.
“Let’s start on the potion.” Draco suggested and Weasley nodded, both knowing the sooner they started, the better.
She gave him a beaming smile. “I’m picking up some supplies for a mass production of Draco Malfoy Pride badges.” She chirped merrily and Draco choked on the very air that he was breathing in.
They had all lied, they had all been wrong. And Draco had been the one to get hurt. He'd been the one who's trust had shattered, leaving him with virtually nothing.
It didn’t hurt nearly as much as the dark mark had. It didn’t hurt as much as having his freedom ripped from him. It didn’t hurt as much as having his family’s lives in his hands.
She came to an abrupt stop once she lay eyes on him, “Oh…Draco.” She murmured pulling him into a tight squeeze. He let himself fall into her grasp, wallowing in his own self pity.
She gave her a small tap on the back. “Don’t worry, he’ll be released later and then you can see him whenever you want.” She offered the dejected Puffs who's moods instantly changed.
They casually made their way towards the Hufflepuff dorm, the little girl talking his ear off as they went. He’d learnt that she had two younger brothers, that her new robes were extremely itchy and that she was quite partial towards chocolate frogs. He grinned slightly as she said that, as he found that he too had quite a liking for chocolate frogs.
Actually if he were quite honest, Blaise and his pretentious comments could go suck his dick. Literally. Blaise would definitely appreciate it, that's for sure!
It was all too much. He wasn’t supposed to feel like this. Potter wasn’t meant to make him feel this way. So, Draco did the only thing he could do.
She growled before making her way towards Draco. He knew how he had to play this. He had to be obedient. Smart. He had do everything and anything he could to keep Kat safe.
“Petrificus totalus!” he shouted at the distracted Death Eater who promptly fell to the floor, completely paralysed.
His mother squeezed his sweaty hand, “maybe, but it’s the first time that you’ll be going back since the war. Doesn’t that bother you?” she asked in deep concern.
Ahhh so the fic's coming to an end. I think there's around four chapters left including an epilogue. I couldn't kill Fred :(  The fic was already far too angsty. I based the harry love scene of a tumblr post, I'll try to like the prompt down below
“Stupefy!” Draco yelled, knocking the Death Eater out cold, before quickly putting him into a body bind. He wouldn’t be escaping any time soon.
Theo sighed. “You have to give me something here.” He was right. Draco did owe him something, but if he were honest, he had nothing to give.
Draco laughed. “You don’t need to worry about Harry, Hermione.” He said simply. “He couldn’t have known what that spell done.” He reasoned.
When he’d reached his destination, he sat down cautiously. The Great Lake lay silently before him, reflecting the multitude of stars that lit up the nights sky.
She rose her eyebrow, “good, then you should know that I’m going to dye my hair Hufflepuff purple tomorrow.” She said proudly and he froze.
No matter how much preparation he'd given himself, nothing would have truly prepared him for that. Hearing that his best friend was scared, and it was all his fault in the first place.
You see, he didn't understand why Healers would always ask him that question. What was he meant to say? I'm not feeling sick at all, in fact, I've been freely deposited here, is it alright if I leave? It was just stupid.
Pansy and Blaise acted distant whenever he mentioned Potter. When he’d first spoken about him on the first day of their seventh year, they’d both looked at him with pained expressions. As if they knew something that he didn’t. It was all terribly off putting.
“Draco.” A cold voice hissed and he sighed. It was here. The moment he had been dreading for the past day. Better now than never.
His aunt’s eyes glistened with tears, “that would be lovely.” She answered in relief and Draco smiled, he had stuck the landing. He repeats, he had stuck the landing.
Draco choked on the very air that he was breathing in. “I say this as a friend. Weasley, you need help.” He laughed, giving him a gentle nab.
Draco wanted to scream. He wanted to tell Potter that he didn’t want to. That the nights kept him sane. That
Pansy took his hand in hers for a second time, “we’d ask questions. Give subtle hints about things regarding Potter that only we’d know. You’d never fail to look at us as if we were crazy. Your face would remain blank every time.” She told him and Draco felt tears starting to prick his eyes.
Between Goyle’s insistent snoring and Blaise’s muffled cries, there was no hope for him. With an annoyed sigh, he pushed himself off his bed and picked up his new sketchbook and pencils. Carefully, Draco walked out of the dorm, he’d might as well do something productive.
Dark on light. Aunt on Nephew. Blood on Blood. Spell after spell was fired, spell after spell Draco blocked. Sweat was pouring down his forehead, his breath coming out in pants. He didn’t know how much more he could take.
The Dark Lord and the Death Eaters had left the Manor just moments before. His mother and father had been forced to go with them. Rumour had it, that Harry Potter was at Hogwarts. Draco’s heart squeezed in his chest at the thought that Potter could be facing the Dark Lord this very moment. He hoped to Merlin that he was alright.
“That’s why I’m calling sweetheart. I’m afraid that your grandma and I won’t be able to make it.” he said and Draco could hear the disappointment in his tone.
Draco nodded and gave her a quick hug “See you tomorrow.” He whispered and she sent him a friendly wave.
She narrowed her eyes at him. “It’s rude to take the gifts that you brought for someone for yourself.” She reprimanded.
Suddenly, Draco was hit with an overwhelming sensation. He brought a hand up to clutch his head as it spun with a nauseating pain.
She took a deep breath, “I almost made the biggest mistake of my life because I almost gave into fear. I almost lost the love of my life. But I didn’t. I married him, and that was the best decision I had ever made. She squeezed his hand. “Never say no to true love because your scared.”
she would be safe with you. But she’d be safer at home where the Death Eater’s can’t find her.” she said rationally.
Hermione shook her head. “It’s just, that he must be blind or downright stupid.” She started and he looked up at her confused. “I try, I try so hard. And he doesn’t see it, he just doesn’t see it.” she mumbled dejectedly.
“Sometimes. But then I just remember that they say those things because they don’t believe. Not everyone can see the world as I do.”
“Are you in any trouble?” she asked with worry, and he wanted to say no. He so desperately wanted to say no.
“I told you that I liked you at the end of fifth year and again at the beginning of term. But still, to this day you’ve ignored me. You haven’t told be if you like me, love me, or just downright hate me. So, which is it Draco?” he questioned. “Which is it?” he repeated, his voice laced with vulnerability.
And those were just the first years. Don’t even get him started on the presents he’d had to get Hermione, Weasley, Potter, and surprisingly Lavender Brown. Because Draco just
The last memory he had of Macmillan was him hexing him so hard that he'd blacked out later waking up in the bloody hospital wing. So
Draco looked at him for a few moments later before he fixed his gaze onto the lake in front of him. He had nothing to say.
His father tutted. “Enough with the pleasantries. If the Dark Lord finds out that I’ve been communicating with you, then it’ll be both our heads!” he snapped.
were you thinking?” Potter swore loudly as he expertly rode them towards the exit. “What part of I can’t live without you do you not understand?” he growled and Draco could do nothing apart from hold his waist a little tighter and pull him closer.
Draco felt his heart speed up as Potter continued, “Like hell am I going to let you spend Christmas all by yourself.” He declared.
He felt his skin start to prickle. “But now I know that you were wrong. That I was wrong. The Dark Lord isn’t strong. He isn’t brave or admirable. He’s weak. He cowers behind his followers. He’s merciless, cruel, and wrong. And I hate it. I hate him.” he declared.
“This potion counts as one quarter of your final grade for this year.” Well it looked like things could get worse. Okay, Draco was sorry. He apologises to whatever God he’s seemed to have upset. He’s sorry.
“You left me.” Draco cried out. “You left, and I thought you’d forgotten about me, that you didn’t want me.” He shamefully admitted, hanging his head down low.
Draco rolled his eyes. “I apologise. I never realised that killing your Headmaster made you a man. I’m sorry, I’ll do better.” He drawled and he could feel Severus' burning gaze drilling holes into his skull..
He’d had enough. That crazy, demented, psychotic bitch had taken everything from him. His best friend. His future. His fucking freedom. She would not take his life either. That wasn’t hers to take. He wouldn’t let her.
Potter took a small step towards him, “how have you been?” his tone was cordial, but his eyes gave him away. They were full of so much unspoken emotion, Draco feared that he would pass out from the weight of it.
Draco never said anything. The nights air was full of the sound of Potter. Draco never turned to him. Never nodded at him. He barley acknowledged he was there. Outwardly, that was. Internally, Draco smiled at Potter’s jokes. Mused about his day. Disagreed with his favourite subject. It was peculiar, but Potter’s company was oddly comforting.
He shot a few curses and hexes as well as successfully disarming his aunt. Serves the crazy bitch right.
Draco was making his way to the Great Lake when a hand clamped down onto his shoulder. Alarmed, he turned around pointing his wand at his attacker in threat.
Draco gave him a small smile in return, “now that’s something I could get on board with.” He quipped before returning back to the potion.
“I’ll tell you what.” He said calmly, “tomorrow evening, you pick some girls and boys if you want, from your year that you like the best.” If the ignorant kids didn't want to make friends with Kat, then he'd make them for her.
She smiled up at Draco, “I think that it’s brave to do all the wrong things, but for all the right reasons.”
He’d felt it the second the Dark Lord had succumbed to the darkness. The dark mark had let out a tiny surge of power, it was miniscule, but the shock was indeed noticeable. It was almost poetic, a mark destined to radiate an abundance of power, reduced to nothing at it’s Lord’s demise.
Okay, so maybe she wasn't the bitch in this situation. Draco was the bitch. He was very much the bitch.
Theo narrowed his eyes, taking a step closer towards him. “That’s the fucking problem Draco. You haven’t done anything!” he accused, and if Draco was secretly planning his death, then so be it.
Couldn’t Theo catch a hint? Draco couldn’t go out with him. He couldn’t go out with anyone; he didn’t deserve it. Death Eater’s didn’t deserve nice things.
“Have you any idea of just how many lives she’d ruined? Of how many people she’d already killed? Of all the people she had yet to kill?” Neville asked him in a serious tone.
Smith howled. “Who would’ve thought it? Draco Malfoy so much of a coward that he needs a few first years to do his bidding. How pathetic.” He insulted.
No, Draco was currently staring at the floor as the Headmaster berated him for his actions in potions yesterday.
And Mrs Weasley had pulled him in for a bear crushing hug, then commented on how thin he was, before finally gifting him with a green woollen jumper with a silver D stitched onto the front. If Draco teared up a little bit, then that wasn’t anybody’s business.
Sorry for the slightly later update! Another update will be posted either later on today or tomorrow morning :)
It was true. He’d been afraid for most of his adolescent life. He’d denied himself so many things, so many possibilities. But he was stronger now, better. He couldn’t let fear win. He wouldn’t.
But even with the odds against him. Draco had still become best friends with Hufflepuff’s. He still managed to apologise to all he had wronged. He couldn’t kill Dumbledore. He made Portkey’s for all the Muggleborn’s. He’d saved Ron, Hermione’s, and his life. He loved Harry….
To say that it had been a weird week would be a bit of an understatement. He now could honestly say that he had made friends in the Weasel and Granger. Or Weasley and Hermione as he now calls them. Between working on his potions project as well as the occasional out of class conversations with Weasley and Hermione’s and his daily library study sessions, Draco was well and truly flabbergasted. His new friendships were completely unexpected, but welcomed, nevertheless.
“You can barely hear me, you say?” he asked and Draco’s stomach started to fill with dread. His father chuckled with glee, “then I’m sure you won’t be able to hear it when I say that Potter you
There’d been so many times where he was sure that he was ready to give up. He knew the feeling; he knew it all too well. When he was just waiting. Waiting to get home, to get to his room, close the door, fall onto bed, and just let out all that he’d been keeping in. The feeling of both relief and pure desperation. Where nothing was wrong, but nothing was right either. When he’s tired. Tired of everything, tired of nothing. Just wanting someone to be there and tell him that it was okay.
Piggy looked up at him with wide eyes, full of determination. “They mess with you, then they mess with me.” She growled, waving her wand around in threat.
He waited patiently for several seconds before sighing deeply. It was clear that they would not show themselves. He supposed he hadn’t expected any better. They’d probably sensed what a traitorous, murderous bastard he was and were too scared to have anything to do with him. He couldn’t blame them; he wouldn’t have either.
It seemed fitting. It really did, that Potter would find him when he didn't what to be found. He had a knack for seeking Draco out when he least wanted it.
After the ‘Potter escaped from the Manor because of Draco incident’, the Dark Lord had determined Draco’s loyalty to be somewhat expendable. As if that wasn’t obvious. Draco was friends with Hufflepuff's, for fucks sake! What part of that didn’t scream: fuck you! You noseless bastard?
Draco huffed, knowing he was fighting a loosing battle. “It’s my father.” he told her, lowering his voice slightly, fearful of who may be listening.
Draco sniffed, raking a hand through his messy locks. “You don’t understand. You don’t know how it is when we’re alone. You don’t know what he tells me or how he treats me.” He defended.
As he drifted in and out of consciousness, he heard the beginnings of mutterings. Ones that sounded a lot like Potter.
He was too baffled to speak. Is that really how he sounded? It was unseemly. Draco shook his head, wait a second…. He had done WHAT?!
When Draco entered his dorm, he walked straight to his bed, but instead of climbing atop of it, he crawled under it.
“Good.” Severus approved, and Draco was begging to feel tired.  He just want to get away. To be anywhere else but here.
Hermione rolled her eyes. “What am I going to do with you?” she tutted, but Draco could see the affectionate glint in her eye. Well, that was new. Had it always been there?
“Mr Malfoy.” Snape characteristically drawled. “If you wouldn’t mind, I’d like to have a moment alone with you outside.”
Potter shook his head. “No, you didn’t, you called it a toasterer.” he said again and Draco wanted to chop his balls off. He would've done it most definitely. It was just now he had formed an attachment with Potter's balls that he didn't plan on severing any time soon.
Draco smiled slightly as he put his pencil to parchment for the first time in days. He finally knew what to draw. Something that made him happy.
son and his dear friends in order to protect them. Or do you mean risking your life to bring food and blankets to prisoner’s in attempt to keep them alive? I. Know. It. All!” she lifted her chin up defiantly.
He was about to turn to leave, when a small tuff of curly brown hair stopped him in his tracks. He watched startled, as a small girl crept out from behind the pillar. She was small and frail, he guessed that she couldn’t have been older than a first year. Her robes were too long, her black eyes drenched in tears.
He shifted slightly, “I was ready to give up. To give up on happiness. To give up on love. To give up on life. I was in such a dark place. I didn’t think I had anyone to turn to. I was tasked with something impossible that I knew deep down I’d never be able to complete it. It seemed as if it was all over. That I was done.” He started, desperately trying to fight of the tears that threatened to escape.
Pansy let out a small tear. “If you truly want to be happy, you’ll grab Potter and never let him go.” She finished and he nodded.
He pulled his mother close that night and fell asleep in her arms. It were if he was a young boy once more, but Draco didn’t mind all that much. In fact, a part of him knew that the small boy he once was had never truly left him.
In that moment, he realised that he had a duty. They all had a duty to protect the next generation. To shape and guide them. To make sure that their optimism was never replaced with pessimism, much like many of them had been exposed to. They deserved a chance to be free to have a choice, and it was up to them to make sure they got it.
Draco could took a deep breath. He had to calm down, he couldn’t make a scene. Not now, definitely not now.
It looked as if Kat was here to stay. He couldn't say that he minded all that much, it had been a long time since he'd accepted any proper company.
He froze as he was engulfed in a deep warmth, his ring buzzing with magic and tranquillity. It felt oddly nice to be this close to Potter. He felt safer than he’d ever felt, locked soundly in his ex-nemesis’ arms.
He’s just merely extremely realistic. Blaise just can’t handle his truths. It was quite so very sad if you asked Draco.
to be wrong.” He bit out in frustration, squeezing his pencil tip so hard into his hand that he was sure to draw blood..
The story of Draco’s hearing had been on the front page of the Daily Prophet that morning. They’d deemed him the ‘unexpected hero who had protected them all’. They’d also regarded his relationship with Potter as the great love affair that had saved the wizarding world. He had been blow away with that response, he wasn’t a hero, he was just a man trying to do the right thing.
He knocked the door three times anxiously, dread pooling in the pits of his stomach. A ghost like woman opened the door. Her face was pale, her once presumably thick, brown hair was thin and matted. Her eyes were hollow with dark grey bags lining them. She looked broken. She looked defeated.
Draco’s heart was beating frantically within his chest, as he held onto every last one of the Headmistress’ words. Her putting into words the very things that he didn’t know how to express.
She shook her head. “That’s not what I’m afraid of.” She told him, and Draco gave her a confused look. Wasn’t making friends the number one thing that children were afraid of when starting a new school. Wow, how times had changed.
Draco’s eyes widened, “No!” he yelled. “He can’t find out. Not now. Not yet. I have a plan.” he told her somewhat confidently, because he did, have a plan that is.
Kat beamed. “Oh, that makes me so happy. I had them made especially for you.” She grinned handing him a purple badge. Draco took the badge, eyeing it sceptically.
Disrespect? Did his father honestly believe that he deserved to be respected at the moment. He could not for the life of him understand the whole show nothing but respect for your elders thing. If someone continued to show him disrespect, he wouldn't tske it lying down. Not anymore.
Draco shook his head patronisingly before sliding down the wall. “Touchy, touchy.” He teased. “Who shat in your breakfast?” he quipped.
Draco didn’t know what to think. It was the first time he’d actually heard what sixth year with Potter had been like. Sure, everyone had told him what he’d felt. Even Potter had told him how he’d felt. But no one had dare tell him how he’d acted. How it had impacted him.
They lapsed into another round of silence. Draco decided that he still didn’t like Potter very much. In fact, he didn’t like him at all. But that was okay, he was certain that Potter didn’t like him very much either.
His reaction was quite funny actually. Weasley truly believed that he had a say in the matter. It was both unfortunate for him and so terribly amusing for Draco.
His father gave him a look that said, ‘did you really just ask me that?’ “Oh yes. I was extremely appalled at first, I definitely wanted to rip your throat out. But I just figured you would grow out of it.” he looked at Draco pointedly, “obviously, you did not.”
Draco sulked. What was wrong with him? Draco knew that he was sarcastic, it was his proudest personality trait after all. But what was this? Wasn’t he trying to divert attention from himself, not encourage it? Self-preservation and all that Slytherin crap.
He knows it’s Potter. Of course, it’s Potter. Draco had been obsessing over him for several years. Potter had invaded his speech, his thoughts, his dreams…
Potter gave him one last final glare, before leaning towards the Weaselette and giving her a long, drawn-out, passionate kiss.
There was no hope. There was officially no hope. Blaise would forever be vain and doomed to a life of isolation and unhappiness. And right now, Draco couldn't say that he actually gave a fuck.
His father started to mutter a few insincere apologies but was quickly interrupted Kat. “Are you coming to wave me off at Hogwarts grandpa?” she asked excitedly, her eyes growing wide.
Something told him that wouldn’t go down too well. His father may be in Azkaban, but if Draco knew Malfoy’s, then his father didn’t need to be a free man in order to kill him. He’d rather not take that chance, even though his life wasn’t the greatest at the moment, he still planned on keeping it, thank you very much!
be standing in my home in the next five minutes, or so help me I’ll drag you over here faster than you can say howler.” She said with the upmost defiance and conviction, before shoving her head out of the flew as the connection cut off.
He opened his mouth to speak but she cut him off again. “Close your eyes,” she directed, and he did, albeit hesitantly.
“Aunt Emmy!” His three-year-old son chirped up as soon as they stepped onto the platform. He squirmed in Harry’s grasped as he held out his arms to Ms Pritchett expectantly.
Did anyone ever take a minute and just think: you know what, Draco already looks extremely confused, so let’s not confuse him anymore. No, let’s help him.
There was silence for several moments before Potter growled, “Are you still not going to speak to me?” he asked.
“She’s done something to you. Taken someone from you. Someone you loved.” He stated gently and Draco felt tears start to form in the crests of his eyes. “I should know, it’s the same look that I see every time I look at myself in the mirror.” He admitted quietly.
Hermione sighed. “I’m so sorry this happened to you. You didn’t deserve it.” she said and Draco felt quite guilty because yes, he did deserve it.
Draco was tired. He was tired of the lies. He was tired of the fake appearances. But most of all, he was genuinely just really bloody tired.
It was as if all his past mistakes had finally caught up with him. He was finally getting what he truly deserved. He didn’t want it. Oh Merlin, he didn’t want it.
Draco glared. “Well, now I have a new idea. Kat stays with me.” He snarled, but deep down he knew that he was fighting a losing battle.
He coughed loudly. “Anyways, the fact still remains that I wiggled my arse, like this.” He turned around shaking his arse with everything he had, before facing them once more, “in order to get you all to follow me.” He stated matter-of-factly.
“Well, since Potter acted like a bloody lunatic, making your relationship appear to be anything but platonic.” He started and Draco cringed. “Then yeah, it is my business.” He finished.
He took another deep breath. “It was perfect. It was everything I’d ever wanted. And it scared me. It scared me so much.” He said shakily. “I was Harry Potter. I wasn’t meant to feel this way about Draco Malfoy. I was meant to marry Ginny and have hundreds of little ginger haired children. I felt dirty. I felt sick. It was as if something was wrong with me.” he wanted to console Potter. To tell him that there wasn't anything wrong with him. But he couldn't. He
“Last time I checked I wasn’t talking to you like you were a bloody animal. Stop being so dramatic, Theo.” Draco criticised, dramatic was a title only reserved for Draco.
“Was it Potter?” Theo questioned hesitantly; Draco nodded. Theo let out a sigh laced with deep acceptance. “It’s always been Potter, hasn’t it?” he came to a conclusion that Draco found hard to accept, but a part of him had always known.
Potter took another step towards him, “I want you to talk to me. I want you to tell me what’s wrong. I want to help.” He said honestly.
Potter brought a hand to his chin, lifting his head so that Draco’s eyes were on his. “You told me to go.” He reminded him and Draco sighed.
Draco sighed, before pulling up his sleeve, not knowing if he’d regret his action. Nathan screamed when he saw the mark, trying to pull away, Draco’s earlier sticking charm holding him firmly in place.
He watched in glee as Hermione’s face turned a frustrated shade of red, “I can’t take it anymore!” she shouted in defeat.
Draco was speechless. His mind was foggy, his lips silent. This was everything he had ever wanted. His father’s acceptance. His father’s pride. He didn’t agree with his father’s choices, nor did he understand his beliefs. But he realised that his father loved him, and that was something he had
Draco turned round so that he was looking into lazy green eyes, “but I like doing this.” He stated as he cupped Potter’s balls, giving them a squeeze.
He honestly had no idea. He thought he’d needed time. He still thought that he needed time. But it was hard. It was really, really hard. He’d become a social recluse, and for what? To find himself? How was
Draco let out an annoyed breath. “Yes, yes, I’m not dead.” He brushed them off. “Please don’t let my apparent resurrection keep you from your mindless conversations.” He bit out before making his way to the dorms.
Theo patted his back, “it’s good to see that war hasn’t changed you much.” He commented, and Draco narrowed his eyes.
Smith growled. “That’s it Malfoy. I’m done with your shit.” He swore and Draco put up a shield charm in the nick of time, anticipating Smith’s next move.
Potter smiled at him, leaning in to give him a quick peck on the lips. “Whatchya thinking about?” he asked.
What was truly healthy? What did anyone define healthy by? It may have not been the standard that most were accustomed to, but it was
Draco narrowed his eyes searching heavily for the mocking words. Where in Merlin’s name was it? It was hiding, he decided. That had to be it.
Draco shook his head, tears spilling down his face. “Please just take me home. Take me back to Hogwarts.” Draco begged and Theo nodded as they began their journey home.
He gave her a confused glance, “but doesn’t it bother you? That you’re different and everyone knows it.” he asked.
She rolled her eyes. “You weren’t listening to a word I was saying, was you?” she chastised and Draco knew he should feel bad. He
Instead of panicking, like he so very wanted to, he put on a brave smile. “There’s nothing to be scared of.” He said simply. “I’m sure you’ll make lots of friends.” He reassured her as best as he possibly could.
Not a moment too soon, another cry came from behind the pillar. It was louder this time, more distressed.
Obviously not, so Draco better remind him, and carry on to spend the rest of their days reminding him. “Of course, but don’t let it go to your head.” He started. “I can stop thinking about you just as quickly as I started.” He threatened light heartedly.
“You’re a Death Eater!” he shrieked, his eyes wide in terror. It was a reaction that Draco had expected so was prepared for.
He gave her a sad smile he hope was reassuring. “They won’t kill us. They need us. They can’t survive without the Malfoy fortune. Why do you think we’re still alive?” he said.
Her eyes widened when she saw him and Draco bit back a shudder. She’d probably recognised who he was. How couldn’t she have? The Malfoy hair was a signature trait.
He scoffed. If she really thought that would grind his nerves, then she was very much deluded. If fact, this was perfect. Without the pressures of being prince he’d be able to get the attention off him for a change.
He was questioning him? The 'I can barely string words together' Weasel was actually questioning Draco's potion making abilities. Draco Lucius Malfoy! Were they talking about the same Draco here, because he obviously hadn't meant him.
He came to a stop as his eyes fell on Weasley and Hermione, they were both sitting on the Grand stairs, they both looked defeated.
He sighed raking his brain for the softest answer possible. “Bad people are coming to Hogwarts. People who want to harm people like you. I’m doing this to keep you safe.” He said honestly.
Pansy and Blaise kept understandingly away from him, and he’d avoided Vincent, Greg, and Theo like the plague.
why he didn’t identify him back at the Manor. He must realise that Draco was on his side, Hermione and Weasley obviously did. But as he stared into his hopeful eyes, Draco knew without a doubt, that Potter’s words were full of a deeper meaning. He knew that Potter was asking why Draco specifically saved
Draco lifted his chin up proudly, “the Slytherins are loyal to me.” he tried to act as sure as possible, but it was hard.
Kat laughed before pulling Draco in for one of their hugs, “You’re right, I’ll see you at dinner.” She assured him before shooting Macmillan one last glare and walking towards the door.
He hated him with every fibre of his being. But instead of hating him because he was a half-blood scumbag that had rejected his attempt of friendship. He hated him because he was overly dramatic. He thought of himself as terribly hard done by. He hated him because he was impulsive, arrogant. A small-minded fool that thought he had the worst luck in the world.
He took a deep breath, setting a trigger word. One that only Harry would know. One that Harry would say when the time came.
With the last shred of hope that he had left he lifted the wand and pointed it to his head. He prayed that feelings were something that couldn’t be forgotten.
But the nights, the nights, they were something to be treasured. They made him feel special, wanted. Draco didn’t speak, nor respond. No, he just listened and felt. He listened to the gentle deepness of Potter’s tone; he felt his heart skip a beat whenever they hands fused together. Potter made him feel safe, accepted, wanted. He couldn’t give that up. He wouldn’t give that up for the world.
The necklace lay in his pocket, a silent reminder of all that he has done. Of what he will continue to do.
They fell into a comfortable silence. With his two best friends pressed next to him, Draco felt safe. Something he hadn’t felt in a really long time.
Draco looked at her confused. She carried on, “someone stupid would let their emotions guide their every action, but someone brave would renounce everything they believe in to save somebody that they loved. It doesn’t mean that their beliefs or the right thing isn’t important, it just means that they’re human.” He wanted to believe her. He desperately wanted to believe her.
“Draco, it’s absolutely beautiful. I’ve never see anything more artistically amazing.” She said in complete awe.
Potter cupped Draco’s draw, stroking it gently. “I’ll tell you one thing.” He started. “You’ve never been more beautiful than you are in this moment.” He whispered earnestly before smashing his lips onto Draco’s.
“Have you ever looked at the stars Malfoy?” Potter asked, his gaze ablaze with wonder as he took in the nights sky.
Potter carried on. “All I can do is keep you close and carry on showing you how much I care about you. And I care about you so much.” He said earnestly. “I keep on thinking that this is all a dream. That one day I’ll wake up and you’ll be gone. And it scares me. Because your it for me Draco. I’ll never feel this for anyone else but you. You’ve completely ruined me.” He replied, gently.
