"I know you don't want to marry," Draco said. "But I do. I was made for the debutante balls, Potter, but here I am, looking as I do and not a suitor in sight."
"You won't believe who came to see me this afternoon," he said.
He looked around at the large arrangements of flowers, each bunch more colourful than the last, their curling ribbons and bright green leaves. He inhaled and the thick heady perfume of flowers washed over him. He could start a greenhouse with the number of flowers he'd received both in person and by owl. It was almost enough to get to his head, impossible to push away that satisfaction that settled in his chest as he looked around the room. He'd had one or two suitors that fit his guidelines for a husband, a Greengrass cousin who had his own Manor in France and Yaxley, of course. Though, Draco had heard unpleasant things about Yaxley and he wasn't inclined to let that particular acquaintance go further. Still, that left the Greengrass cousin who said he'd be back tomorrow.
"What rumours?" Harry asked, knowing full well what everyone was saying about him.
"I can't marry you," Harry whispered.
He knew where he stood with Draco, knew that even if Draco wanted him back, he wasn't going to choose Harry. Because Draco needed a fortune, a pureblood, and uncomplicated attachments. Draco needed Gregory Greengrass or Blaise Zabini, someone who knew how to navigate their world, someone who didn't think of children with horror and marriage with revulsion.
It was all Draco could hear as he lay in bed that night, the way Harry's voice had gone low and deep, how he'd exhaled just a little rougher as he told Draco all the things he'd ever done. Harry had said it was better when it was someone else's hand, when there was a warm mouth sucking him off.
"About me fucking men, yes," Harry said, pleased to see the way Draco's mouth dropped open.
"You were saying?" she asks.
Harry's eyes dropped back to the necklace at Draco's throat, and his words were low and deliberate when he said, "We're courting and you're wearing another man's necklace."
He's beautiful, shivering underneath Harry, his eyes bright and unfocused. The sounds he's making, small choked off groans as Harry moves in him, against him. Their breaths, loud in the otherwise silent room. Harry loves him, every bit of him, from the way Draco bites his lip to keep quiet as though he's afraid that someone's going to hear them in the empty flat. To the way Draco's hands feel against Harry's hair, how he pulls him down so that they're kissing.
"Why exactly did you do this?" Hermione asks, pointedly ignoring Ron and passing Harry a cup of tea.
Draco nodded, extending his neck a bit as Elise Abbott made a full turn to get a better look in their direction. He could hear the gasp of breath from the people nearest to them and when Gregory asked Draco for a dance, he gladly accepted. They danced together a second time before propriety dictated that Gregory pay attention to his other guests. By the time Gregory excused himself, Elise Abbott looked as though she'd swallowed a particularly sour lemon. That made Draco feel better until he looked towards the corner where the Weasleys stood and remembered that Harry hadn't shown up.
There was a flash of uncertainty across Draco's face before he schooled his expression into a mask of indifference. "Your reputation outside of Wizarding society hardly has anything to do with your reputation within it," he said. "Besides, no one here is fool enough to say no to The Boy Who Lived simply because he tumbled with a Muggle or two."
Draco throws an arm around Harry's shoulders and pulls him closer, kisses him, hot and eager. He's trembling and willing, and Harry can feel that tightness in his chest, an ache that rests somewhere behind his sternum. He doesn't know how he could he ever begin to explain the way the world narrows down for a moment on the curve of Draco's mouth, on his face and all the changing expressions.
He'd been content, wasting away his time, until Ron's letter arrived. Until Ron asked him to come back. Until Harry listened because, for the first time in five years, he'd been curious. Because by the time Ron asked him to go back, the two truths of his life had already grown roots within him, and he'd known without a doubt that nothing and no one would be able to shake his convictions.
One of the things Harry's learned about Draco is that, much like Harry, he enjoys a good chocolate dessert every now and then. That night in late September, Harry's banking on it being close to the weekend and the fact that they haven't had a date in a little over three weeks. It's easy to convince Draco to get the mousse cake, to say that it's because they haven't had time to go out.
He wasn't the same eighteen-year-old child who'd wandered the countryside because a dead man asked him to, because people said it was his destiny, his purpose. He was a grown man with needs and desires, a man who looked at Draco Malfoy and wanted him wholeheartedly and unashamedly. A grown man who didn't confuse things as he might have done when he was younger.
"Iâ€¦" Harry said, unable to form the proper words.
Harry looked up, his eyes meeting Draco's. "You should call me Harry," he said. "Since we're supposed to be courting."
"I've read it," Harry said. "Ginny likes to laugh about it at breakfast."
"You court me," Draco said, continuing before Harry could voice his protest. "A pretend courtship, of course. Enough to get me the attention of someone other than the eldest Bulstrode cousin. Not necessarily a Spanish prince but someone proper."
"Let me guess," Draco said, deciding that he had no time for propriety and turning to face Harry on the couch. "You've been known to go after unsuspecting purebloods looking for suitable matches?"
He wanted Harry, that much had been clear from the beginning. But more importantly, Draco wanted him more than he wanted this match with Gregory, more than he wanted the ring on his finger. He stood there and thought of Harry, of the way he'd looked in the Bulstrode ballroom, the hard set of his mouth, his jaw, the way he couldn't seem to stop looking at Draco. He imagined himself walking back into the ballroom, heedless of what anyone saw, imagined marching up to Harry and pulling their faces together. He imagined the scandal, the delicious heat of rules broken and wants fulfilled.
They'd talked about their respective families and had spent a rather pleasant afternoon, nothing exciting but nothing dull either. Then Blaise had dropped by to invite Draco to his family's concert that weekend and the ball the following week. Draco hadn't thought he merited a personal invitation, but Blaise had simply raised an eyebrow and said, "I assume Potter will be attending if you do." And Draco had laughed and taken the invitation without answering Blaise's questions.
Harry's gone through three pages of results, has almost convinced himself that Draco doesn't love him and that Harry's simply reading too much into his own feelings, when he finally finds something useful.
"So you don't want to spend less time with me then?"
He didn't have to give back to the Muggles, didn't have to send his children out into a world that would expect great things from them. Whatever children he might have in the Wizarding World would always carry the burden of his name and be victims of the trauma that came from being a child caught in the middle of a war. He wasn't ready for parenthood. He didn't think he ever would be. But the Wizarding World wanted it from him like they wanted his attention and his time, his devotion to their causes.
He was so focused on keeping his footing that it took a moment for him to notice the figure standing at the far side of the maze. He recognized the slope of the shoulders and the messy black hair before Harry turned. Harry was mostly in shadow, the hedges hiding his expression even as the moonlight revealed his red coat and his shining dragonhide boots.
He thinks of the implications of taking a chance even when one is sure the outcome will be negative. Quite frankly, Harry thinks, watching the film, he could do much better than Mark. And he wouldn't be declaring his love to someone unavailable. He wouldn't even be declaring his love to someone who doesn't love him back, because Harry knows that his feelings are returned. He knows what it means that Draco's made a home on Harry's sofa, that he has clothing in Harry's closet, that one look across a boring Ministry meeting and everything suddenly seems so much better.
She curtsied and he bowed, taking her hand as they straightened and placing a kiss on the back of her gloved hand.
It's why Draco had taken it upon himself to marry well. He owed his mother that, owed it to himself. He was tired of courtships, pretend or otherwise. At the end of the day, all he wanted was to know that he'd have a place to live and that his mother would be safe for the rest of her life. Gregory Greengrass could provide that for both of them.
The first things Harry does Monday morning are clear his afternoon and harass Bartholomew from the Department for Intoxicating Substances, until he promises to send Draco home early.
"Do you want romantic gestures?" Draco asks.
"What?" Harry asks, midway through pulling at his hair.
He was escorting his sister to the dance floor, both of them looking rather awkward as they took their positions. It was easy to spot the rest of the Weasleys to their right, all of them laughing until Mrs Weasley said something that quieted everyone down at once. All of them looked impeccable in various shades of green that went well with their hair. Draco suspected that Fleur Delacour had something to do with that, although he didn't doubt that Mrs Weasley had contributed plenty to the Weasley family's newly polished look. After all, Mrs Weasley was one of the Sacred Twenty-eight, and despite her family's long absence at these events, there were some things one didn't forget.
"Nice bouquet," Draco said, getting up as Harry came to a stop in front of his couch.
Harry gets his knees under him and lifts Draco's hips higher, changes the angle so that the next time he pushes in, Draco lets out a broken off groan. Draco feels good, their faces close to each other as they move, Draco's hair curling with sweat, his grey eyes half-lidded as he stares at something past Harry's shoulder. He's doing his best to focus because Harry had asked, had whispered, "I want you to watch me." But Harry can see his concentration slipping, the way it does when they get really into it. When Draco lets loose a little and asks Harry for things, listens when Harry moves him around, arranges him how he wants him. So easily compliant, so willing to please.
Parkinson Manor sat at the centre of acres of forested land with winding pathways that led to various gardens and lakes. From the entrance of the manor, a pebbled driveway led to the main street, the way lit by floating bulbs of white light. About halfway down, there was another path hidden behind a mossy curtain in between the large green hedges. Harry hadn't noticed it on his way to the manor earlier, but as he followed behind Draco at a proper distance, he saw the mossy curtain part, allowing Draco to step through.
The waitress wraps up the mousse cake and hands it to Harry so gently, he knows she's put Draco's piece in there.
"I don't want to be a catch," Harry said.
But Ron had laughed when he'd said it, and he hadn't hesitated when Harry had asked him to help him pick out something for tonight. That his look for tonight had been Ron's idea still makes Harry want to laugh. But he's seen the appreciative glances from Draco and he makes a mental note to send Ron flowers.
Then, with a quick wink in his direction, she turned back into the mass of potential suitors, leaving Draco to ponder the question by himself.
"I'm just going to do this looking at the TV, if you don't mind," he says, doesn't wait for Draco to stop him. "I've been trying to tell you all month, it feels like, and now that I know you don't expect a million roses, it's easier to just come out and say it."
a traitorous voice in his head told him.
Harry shrugged. "If you haven't heard about it, I'm not going to be the one to tell you," he said. "It's not particularly flattering."
"It's a privacy spell of sorts," Draco said. "Before the War, the Parkinsons used it to confuse the Aurors when they came to check the house for Dark objects."
He types in "how to tell someone you love them" into the search bar and goes through three different websites with advice that ranges from,
"I suppose we have no other choice," Harry said, eyeing Draco's glittering jewels. "You need a rich husband and Bill Weasley broke my heart at seventeen when he married Fleur Delacour, so there's nothing left for me at these balls."
Harry does his best to be polite to Narcissa the next time they have lunch. It happens on the last Saturday of September, when the weather's decided that rain would put them all in a good mood. They're not able to eat outside, even though they always eat outside when Harry visits with Draco. But Harry gets through it in one piece, doesn't use his coffee spoon for the Tarte Tatin, and manages to scrape by a moderately successful evening.
Harry tries not to laugh as he nods solemnly. He knows Draco enjoys the movie more than he lets on, not only because of the film itself, but because it'd become a sort of tradition between the two of them. On weekends when work had been particularly demanding, they'd curl up on Harry's sofa, tucked under a blanket and just let the sounds of holiday cheer wash over them. Sometimes, Harry knows, they hadn't even paid attention to the movie. What had mattered was the calm that had swept through the flat as the movie had played in the background, something comforting that let them know things would be okay in the end. With work the way it was recently, a Friday night curled up with Draco on the sofa sounded good to Harry.
"Oh, but she had to," Pansy said, turning wide disbelieving eyes on him. "You must know you've always been the one to beat, Draco. There are no more Blacks of note and after the House of Black, the Malfoys are the most well-connected and influential of all pureblood Wizarding families. The name still means something, even if you do find yourself with much tighter purse strings these days."
"Weasley," Draco agrees solemnly. "What are we doing for dinner tonight?"
"Come here," Draco says.
"I'm not going to marry him," Draco said.
"As well they should," Draco continued. "You're more than the Boy Who Lived and I am more than an ex-Death Eater. And whatever decision you make, regardless of whether or not the Wizarding World agrees with it, will be your own because you're you, Harry. You're a person with wants and desires and needs, and no one can take that away from you. Not even me."
With a careful glance behind him, Harry followed, feeling a rippling of magic wash over him as the moss curtain settled back into place.
Harry watched him and even though they shouldn't, Harry didn't stop Draco from putting a hand on his arm. He was wearing gloves but the intention was to comfort him and Harry was going to take any bit of comfort he could get at that moment. He could feel the air getting stuck in his throat as he tried to gather his thoughts. He'd stopped trying to speak these things aloud. It had been hard enough explaining to Ron and Hermione why he'd had to leave. Explaining to Draco was another thing entirely, an important thing that he had to get right.
Harry finds the "volume" button and turns down the sound until he can't hear the music coming from the earbuds anymore. He hands the Shuffle back to Draco, watches how Draco tucks it away as though afraid he'll damage it. When Draco looks at him, Harry's smiling, watching the morning sun, and breathing in the smells of cooking bacon.
Without thinking, he tugged off the ring on his middle finger. He considered tossing it into the water and watching it sink beneath the bubbling fountain. He felt a sense of satisfaction just imagining it gone because, at least then, he'd have made a clear decision. Instead, he placed it on the marble, the moonlight reflecting off the stones. It was a beautiful piece of work, clearly expensive, so very proper for a promise ring because it meant the actual engagement ring would be far grander. It was a masterful expression of wealth, exactly the kind of thing Draco might have done if he'd had a choice in pursuing someone.
Still, it was with the same annoyance that had been simmering underneath his skin since he'd stepped foot in Parkinson Manor that he said, "I'm hardly the only person with connections to former Death Eaters. I don't see why the blasted Lady Red had to single me out."
He caught himself on the last thought, horrified at the way he was already making arrangements in his head for his move back to London. He thought of Draco again, of the stories that had run daily after the War, about how if anyone had any experience with dealing with the press, it was Draco. Perhaps Harry wasn't introducing him to anything new. Perhaps it was better that it was Draco, who knew what it was like to be branded one way by the press and to be left with no room for change or growth. Perhaps, a voice in the back of Harry's head told him, perhaps it might be possible to marry Draco and be happy.
He dragged a hand through his hair in exasperation, pulling so hard on the strands, Draco knew it must hurt.
It was impossible to tell where he was, something about the spells in place skewing the sounds around them. From far off, Harry could hear the sounds of the ball in full swing, the string quartet carrying on over the chatter of the guests. Much closer was the sound of swishing robes and footsteps, as though there was a group of people passing nearby.
Harry grins. "Especially the ones about the Internet."
At first, he'd found the cottage in the countryside and refused to use his magic out of spite. He'd purposefully kept his location a secret and had asked Hermione to help him with the spells to keep owls from finding him. He'd given Ron, and only Ron, the last shard of the two-way mirrors Sirius had once gifted him. Then he'd made Ron and Hermione promise not to tell anyone where they might find him.
Harry's grin was slow and self-satisfied as he held out his arm again. "You were saying about Blaise?"
"Hey," Harry says, "don't move, I'll be right back."
Draco paused to gesture at himself and their surroundings. Harry followed his hands, the length of his fingers. He told himself that he was looking only because Draco had allowed it, because it was required in his understanding of the situation. He had to know how the fabric of Draco's dress robes hung on his shoulders, had to understand the shape of Draco's nose and the attractive ruffle of his hair. Looking wasn't hurting anyone after all, and so long as no one caught them in the garden together, there was no harm done.
Draco narrowed his eyes as Pansy fanned herself, the perfect picture of posed indifference. She knew Draco had read the pamphlet because everyone in their circle read Lady Red's rubbish. Even the help read it, which meant that everybody knew that Draco's name had been dragged through the mud that morning. His unfortunate past had been brought under scrutiny without a single mention of how his name had been cleared not long after the end of the War. There hadn't even been a mention of his family's new foundation, and perhaps it was true that his family's generosity was originally meant to drag their name out of the mud, but being cleared of all charges had come at a great financial cost. Their donations meant that although they could still afford the fees for Draco's coming out this season, they were no longer as comfortable as they had been pre-war.
The muscle at Harry's jaw worked hard as he regarded Draco. Harry was still leaning against the wall but the tension at his shoulders was gone, even though Elise Abbott was still doing her best to push her daughter past Draco. Harry spared one glance for poor Alice Abbott who tripped over her feet as her mother gave her a particularly forceful shove forward.
Harry's mouth dropped open as he watched Draco pull further away. He didn't know what exactly did it, whether it was the obvious out Draco was giving him, or that infuriating beat of his heart whenever Draco got too close. He only knew that as he stood in the hallway just inside Grimmauld Place, he felt a desperate need to hug Draco, to hold him, to bury his face in Draco's neck and have Draco stroke his hair. He wanted it to be simple, more than he had ever wanted anything else in his entire life.
"We could stop the movie," Harry says.
"McLaggen," he said, nodding his greeting before turning to the door. "Harry Potter here to see Draco Malfoy."
Then, the world had gone out of tilt as Harry had realised that he was in love with Draco Malfoy.
"Reputation?" Draco asked, the word jogging him out of his momentary haze. "What reputation might that be, Potter?"
Which meant that Draco had to find a rich husband. And he was finding that task more difficult since Lady Red had so casually reminded everyone that his family had been in bed with Death Eaters not so long ago. Even though the same thing could be said of half the people in the ballroom in front of him. But, Draco supposed, everyone needed a scapegoat.
Harry supposed there were some things one didn't say no to, and Draco Malfoy smiling at him under the moonlight happened to be one of them so, with a shake of their hands, they agreed.
Ever since then, the Prophet photos had been much more pleasing to the eye and Harry had stopped feeling like a slob.
Harry's starting to worry as he moves closer. "I can always rewrite it," he says. "I'm not married to 'chickpea.' There's really very little that's both light and rhymes with 'tea.' But it's only the first draft. Ginny laughed at me when I read it to her but what does she know? Draco?"
He hadn't known just how angry he was that Harry hadn't been present for most of the night until Harry was in front of him. Lady Red had made a big deal about his and Harry's courtship, publishing piece after piece about all the flowers Draco had received. There had been an entire section dedicated to their potential wedding date the day before, and Narcissa had even started making comments about what theme Draco might like for his wedding. And now that they were meant to attend their first event since their official fake courtship had started, Harry hadn't shown up the entire night. Draco just knew that tomorrow there would be an article about how he'd lost Harry Potter's interest, how Draco might not be as interesting as Lady Red and Harry Potter had originally thought.
Harry thinks about dinner and how sometimes gestures don't matter more than words, how it would be so easy to say it now, something to fill the spaces in between them. Draco catches Harry's eyes and they stare at each other, Harry overwhelmed for a moment at the sharply focused look in Draco's eyes.
Draco laughed, overly aware that they were putting on a show for the other people in attendance. He found that he didn't particularly care what anyone else thought. Whether they believed he was having a lover's quarrel with Harry or if they overheard their conversation. The fact remained that he'd lost face tonight and his mother had paid some of the price for that. Draco wasn't feeling charitable towards Harry and he could see Gregory looking their way from across the room.
"I know how to keep the mothers away from you," Draco said. "And I know how to get myself a Spanish prince."
Harry looked up startled, his heart beating hard in his chest. "Hermione and Ron said almost the same thing when I told them," he said.
Harry frowned, "You don't happen to be related to Hannah by any chance?"
"I suppose, if you like dark-haired men," he says.
"Do you want to head back?" Harry asked, knowing well that Draco didn't.
"Iâ€¦" he started, letting the silence linger as he thought of what to say.
The night was cool, the cold air blowing in from Draco's open window and doing little to ease the heat spreading across his chest. He thought about Harry earlier that day, about how his messy hair had fallen over his face, how he'd smiled at Draco, the way he'd grinned at McLaggen, slow, self-satisfied. He thought of Harry's bare arms and the cords of muscles on his forearms, the way Harry had flexed when he offered his arm.
"You know what rumours," Draco said, coolly.
He's quiet for a moment, the silence in the flat a little more pointed. He doesn't mean for the moment to get awkward but there's nothing Harry can do about it. He's not going to confess to Draco that he doesn't know how to tell him he loves him. That would involve explaining why and Harry's done with looking back at things that he can't change.
Harry said nothing but his eyes were still on the emeralds at Draco's neck.
They're at Ron and Hermione's flat, Harry on Ron's favourite armchair, Hermione and Ron to the left of him on the sofa. Ron's doing his best to seem like he isn't laughing at Harry, though his coughing fit every time Hermione asks Harry a question, gives him away.
"And what, pray tell, have people been saying?" Draco asked.
Draco goes home with him and as they're hanging their cloaks to dry, Harry thinks of the list and says, as casually as he can, "That was fun. We should have lunch with your mother again tomorrow. Your dad too, if he's up for it."
He didn't move away, even though they were almost touching. He stood his ground, his eyes cold and unimpressed.
Harry let his eyes roam around the room, going from one bejewelled person to the next. He lingered on the long necks and the flattering cuts of dress robes, on the delicate motions of people wandering around the room in groups. He watched the quiet flirtations, the sly exchange of appreciative looks, and the delicate dance between two interested people. He saw a young woman drop her bag, watched the person closest to her stop and bend down to pick it up. There was a moment where the two met each other's eyes, a lingering touch as the young lady got her bag back, and then the smallest brush of hands as they parted ways.
"Lovely weather we're having," she called.
He turned towards the door, pulling it open, only to come face to face with Draco himself.
"Oh," Draco says, finally hanging up his cloak. "In that case, be clearer next time."
Mrs Abbott didn't even acknowledge him and a moment later, Ron was gone, disappearing into the crowd. Harry watched him go with a sinking suspicion that he'd been abandoned with intent. He turned back to Elise Abbott and her daughter, and found that while he'd been distracted, the group around him had gotten bigger. He could see Pansy Parkinson towards the back of the crowd, standing next to a young man who shared the shape of her nose. Among the heads of this new crowd, Harry could pick out a few faces, though the knowledge that he knew some of these people did nothing to take the edge off the dread that was building in his stomach.
He glanced at the door next to him and realised his mistake as the first mother made it to him. He'd picked the spot next to the exit so that he could escape should the need arise. But in doing so, he'd let Ron take the space next to him, effectively blocking off his right. The group of people in front of him had fanned out as though expecting him to run, and though he might make it past the threshold and into the Parkinson Manor waiting room, he knew he'd never make it out without someone stopping him. Besides, the night wasn't over and Harry had promised Ron he'd stay, so he took a breath and turned a smile on the woman in front of him.
Eventually, he told the Weasleys where he was. Eventually, he allowed Hermione and Ron to send owls. Eventually, he invited Mrs Weasley over for tea and allowed her to fuss over him. And as the days passed, the anger had dissipated, the same way the clouds disappeared to nothing over the coastline in the distance. Until one day, Harry had woken slowly, with no memory of the usual nightmares. He'd stood in his backyard as the sun rose, letting the sea breeze ruffle his already messy hair.
"Potter," he said. "You're here to see Draco?"
Besides, well-dressed or not, the Weasleys were an attractive group of people, hypnotic and charmingly humorous. They more than made up for their less-than-perfect behaviour at these events simply by being themselves. It really was a shame that most of them were either married or uninterested in forming a match with Draco's family.
Well, Harry thinks, watching the way Draco eyes him up and down, when Draco puts it that way, there's really only one choice.
"You keep cleaning up after me, even though we both know you're rubbish at cleaning spells."
"Or ten," Harry said.
Harry gives him a questioning look and Draco shrugs.
"What?" Harry asks, confused about what he's done to make Draco think he wants to end things. "Why would you ask me that?"
"Don't tell me that," Harry practically shouted.
He couldn't explain all of this to Draco yet, so instead, he shrugged and said, "Just because people are spreading rumours that I'll bed anything with a pulse, doesn't make it true."
And then, he'd seen Draco Malfoy draped in gold and black with strings of pearls decorating his hair, over-the-top and gaudy. Something had shifted in the centre of Harry's chest, as Draco led him to the Parkinson gardens, and he'd agreed to Draco's plan before he could stop himself. He'd agree to whatever Draco wanted, if only Draco were to ask. If only he'd close that infinitesimal distance between them when they spoke. If only he'd stay still while Harry did it for him.
"Just because everything I say with regards to mannerisms and familial expectations goes right through you, doesn't mean that I didn't try," Draco says, but he's smiling as he takes Harry's hand. "Is that what this is then? An apology for the fiasco that was lunch with my mother?"
Inside, there are strings of white fairy lights hanging around the edges of the room, small bulbs dancing around the tables so that there's enough light for everyone to see what they're doing. There's a string quartet on a small black velvet-covered dais at the back of the restaurant. The shine of the velvet matches the sleek floor tiles and the exposed dark red brick walls. The bar counter is a deep burgundy, polished to a perfect shine. Every few rounds of drinks, the bartender waves his wand and the surface gleams as though new.
"Do you think she's heard about my reputation," Harry went on, oblivious to the way Draco sat very still. "I assume not, since she thinks it's safe to leave you here with me. Alone."
"Oh, Harry," he says.
Draco touched himself without thinking, sliding his hand down his pants until he got a hold of his cock. He imagined Harry whispering in his ear, those same words he'd whispered earlier. He'd talked about fucking, about the warmth of a body below him.
Harry looks at them, at Ron's sympathetic expression and at Hermione, who looks as though she has many things to say and is keeping quiet out of friendly respect. Harry considers how they'd react if he told them about the time in the bedroom, thinks,
Draco cleared his throat. "Potter, you do understand that great-great-grandfather Malfoy himself will rise from his grave long before a Weasley thinks to marry me," he said.
Harry reaches out to touch Draco's shoulder and is surprised when Draco startles. He turns, his grey eyes wide as he looks at Harry.
Then, Harry remembers dessert.
Harry hadn't made Draco wait. He'd come the morning of the Bulstrode Dance and simply let Draco know that they were to put an end to their fake courtship. He'd been polite, if a bit distanced, his eyes never straying from a spot over Draco's shoulder. And so, things ended, and Draco had been left to sit in silence for the rest of the morning and well into the afternoon.
"Mother will be here soon," Draco said.
Harry takes a deep breath and waits, eyes on the movie. He watches Mark go through his poster board signs, listens to Draco's quiet breathing. He has to get through this before he can look at Draco because he knows once he does, there's no way Harry's going to finish his speech.
"Of course I'm right," Ron says, patting Harry on the knee.
It was for the best, he told himself. It had never been Harry's intention to marry him, and Draco had made it clear from the beginning that he was looking for someone rich and pureblood. Someone who wouldn't have to learn how to navigate high society, someone who his mother might respect even if she never fully liked them. Draco hadn't even cared about heirs. His family history wasn't something he was proud of, and his family name carried with it centuries of faults and unnamable atrocities. It was never about children.
"Not unless they see someone worth running for," she said, as she opened her fan. "I assume you read Lady Red's paper this morning."
Draco knew what Harry was talking about immediately. Last night, he'd worn a mixture of black and gold, but his mother had been dressed to complement him in black and white, with the faintest traces of gold at her neck and in her hair. Instead of presenting the bouquet to Draco as flirtatious teasing, Harry had chosen to present it to his mother. His beautiful mother who hadn't received a single bouquet of flowers since Lucius Malfoy had died during the War. It was no wonder that Narcissa took the bouquet, thanked Harry, and proceeded to escort suitor after suitor out of the sitting room.
He kept his eyes on the room, even though he could feel Harry's breath on the side of his face. "And what if everyone thinks I like Gregory?" he asked. "It's not like you've been here at all tonight. And it certainly wouldn't be my fault if someone else came and took me away from right under your nose."
"You don't suppose Mr Potter's taken ill," Elise Abbott continued conversationally, fanning herself with her hand. "I haven't seen him at all this evening but I'm sure he'd be here if he could. He is courting you after all, is he not?"
Hermione and Ron are the last to leave and Harry can tell right away that Ron's up to something. He watches as Hermione shakes her head, but Ron turns to Harry, winks and says, "Hey Malfoy, have I ever told you how your hair kind of reminds me of chickpeas?"
"No, I don't, but I can stomach a night of good food and something pretty to look at."
Harry exhaled shakily, relief washing over him. "Or a Spanish prince," he added.
"I'm assuming it's supposed to be romantic," Draco says, sounding bored.
"You are angry."
"The volume from what?" Harry asks.
"Yes," Draco said, stabbing his sausage hard enough that his fork hit his plate.
He wondered whether Harry's mouth would be warm, whether he'd stop before Draco came or if he'd keep going. He wondered just how much practice Harry had because he couldn't conceive of Harry being inexperienced with the way he'd talked about fucking. He imagined Harry laying back against the headboard, self-assured, that smirk playing on his lips. He'd tell Draco what to do, how to suck him off. Maybe he'd put his hands in Draco's hair and guide him, press him down until Draco gagged.
Or perhaps Harry would win in a duel. Perhaps he'd overpower Draco, would take his wand, would have him at his mercy.
"I don't know," Harry says, packing up his quills and the parchment with his notes. "How do you feel about curry?"
That he trusts Harry to see him this way, to take care of him and guide him is almost too much. It makes Harry want to hold him close, to give him whatever he wants, in whatever way Draco wants it. Makes it so that it's a little hard to think as Harry presses in slowly, really letting Draco feel all of him, that heavy slide of their bodies. He feels Draco shiver beneath him and Harry buries his face in Draco's neck. He smells like detergent and the thick heavy scent of his cologne. Good everywhere he's touching Harry, murmuring encouragements as Harry moves, broken off, "please, need to feel you."
"I'm all right, Mother," Draco said, knowing that she wouldn't believe him.
As Draco watched her, so did every wizard within her proximity, their eyes trailing down the expanse of her neck. She didn't stumble as she made her way across the ballroom, but Draco saw the slight shift to her stance, the way she slowed just a tad to give everyone more time to look at her. He almost laughed as he watched Nott trip over himself to get closer. Pansy came with a significant fortune and with enough familial backing that there was no doubt she'd find a husband this season. It was really only a matter of who Pansy wanted to marry and when.
He could feel his heart beating rapidly in his chest, Draco's words echoing in his head. He had to tell himself that Draco didn't mean a real courtship, that he wasn't looking for anything aside from a boost to his image. This was meant to help Harry. Neither he nor Draco wanted anything serious from the other. They were both looking for a way to better their situation and a fake courtship, no matter how terrifying the prospect, might be fun. If only for the look on Ron's face when Harry told him he intended to court Draco.
Draco turned, knowing that the light from the chandeliers would catch on the emerald necklace. He saw Harry's gaze lock on his throat and felt particularly mean as he reached up to adjust it.
Draco let the silence hang, a heavy meaningful weight between them as Harry noticed again how insignificant the distance between them was. Harry was rich and well-connected but he wasn't pureblood. Draco wasn't talking about him, but he watched Harry as though he might mean him. As though Harry should want Draco to mean him.
He let out a low growl of frustrated rage and strode forward again, linking his arm with Draco and pulling him along the path. "Listen, Draco," he said. "I knew who I was before and during the war. But then it ended and everyone wanted me to be so many different versions of myself. I didn't know what to do, so I left. Now I'm back and no one learned a single thing in my absence. They still want me to be who they think I should be, and no one bothers to ask me what I want to do, or who I want to be, and frankly, last night it was one person too many so I fucked off. I'm sorry. I should have told you."
"It was an argument," Draco says, heading into the flat. "And I am by the way."
Pansy raised one perfectly pencilled brow and held out the cream-coloured card hanging from her wrist. She produced a quill from a tiny purse hanging from the side of her dress robes and handed it to Draco. He took it and signed his name at the bottom of the long list of men who'd already reserved a dance with her.
"Do try to be a little discreet with your staring," Pansy said, carefully inserting herself between Draco and his view of Justin. "You wouldn't want anyone getting any ideas about where your interest lies. Especially not before you hear who's coming tonight."
"I don't like being told what to do," he said, taking one step too many.
Once, Draco had been destined for grander things. He'd been raised for courting, for the passing glances, the quick meeting of eyes, the demure lowering of his lashes. He'd had the clothes and jewels and knew how to arrange them so carefully on his person that he seemed born to wear them. He deserved the gifts and the compliments, and he was damned if he didn't pull a husband rich enough and well-connected enough to lift his family from the hole his parents had dug themselves into.
He's too quiet.
"It was free. Hermione wasn't using it anymore."
"Oh," he said, quietly, something like hurt flashing across his face as he avoided Draco's eyes.
And, in the end, when it came down to a choice between happiness and duty, Harry found that happiness was as easy as finally saying, "Yes."
"Just like that?" Harry asks, refusing to believe it can be that easy.
"Draco?" Harry asks.
Draco stood there, paces from Harry, just waiting. It took a few tries but, finally, Harry focused on him and not the scowling mothers at Draco's back. When he was sure that he had Harry's undivided attention, Draco smiled disarmingly and said, "What disaster have you gotten yourself into now, Potter?"
"Hm," Harry says, turning back to the film, "I suppose not."
"Never say I love you during sex," Ron says. "Everyone knows that. Too much adrenaline. Not enough space to think."
"Go slow," Draco says against Harry's ear.
Harry leaned forward enough that Draco could smell the citrus in his cologne. He was so close Draco could practically feel the heat from his thigh, his hand just a stretch away from Draco's on the back of the couch. All Draco had to do was shift a tad and he'd be able to brush his nose against Harry's. He couldn't help himself as they looked at each, couldn't stop his eyes from dropping to Harry's mouth, to the edge of his smile, back to his eyes. Harry was watching him intently, his mouth slightly parted, his chest rising and falling as he breathed. He stared and stared until Draco lost track of everything else but the bright green of Harry's eyes. He inhaled and Harry looked down, finally, at Draco's mouth.
"Draco," Harry says, taking a step back. "We really should at least make sure the cakes made it home all right."
Draco looks up slowly, something mischievous in his eyes. He tilts the box to show Harry the broken mass of chocolate mousse, raspberries, and white sugar.
"Oh?" Draco asked, interested in what exactly Harry was planning.
Harry buried his face in Draco's neck and kept going, moving with Draco until they were both panting, until the pleasure built between them and drowned out everything but their muffled groans.
"I see," Harry said again.
When he got to the fountain, he stopped, listening to the cascading water as it hit the marble. He went to it, wanting to feel the spray on his face, to touch the water and perhaps calm the burning in his chest. He didn't understand what was happening, or why he suddenly wanted to run and keep going until he couldn't hear the music from Bulstrode Manor, until he might outrun Gregory and his smiling face. He leaned against the fountain, his right hand coming down hard on the marble. He heard the click of the ring against the stone, the sound loud in the mostly silent night. It echoed in his ears, a reminder of the decision he'd just taken.
"You know exactly what you're doing, don't you?" Draco asked, even as he looped his arm with Harry's again.
"I'm talking about Blaise Zabini, of course," Draco said at last.
"Not a chance, mate," Ron said. "You promised you'd keep me company and we haven't given Mum nearly enough time to catch Ginny."
What could he say? What could he tell Pansy that would make her understand why he'd done what he did? That he might harbour feelings for Harry was a ridiculous excuse. That he loved Harry was even more preposterous because if he did...if he loved Harry, then he was an even bigger fool than Pansy thought him. Because Harry wasn't going to marry him, and Draco had just thrown away his one chance at a good life for nothing.
Draco turned back to Pansy. She was smiling, a secret little thing that made her look a tad manic.
"It must be their most popular bouquet, then," Draco said, motioning to the spot next to him on the couch. "Elegant and expensive."
Harry shook his head again. "No," he said. "You don't understand."
Those thoughts settled in his chest as they continued their walk, as Draco talked about Blaise having tea with him and his mother. He imagined that Draco wore no gloves, that their skin might touch, and suddenly, he wanted it so much, he thought he might burn from the inside out with the need. Just a single touch, one of Draco's fingers pressing into his skin, the way they'd touched that first day Harry had paid him a visit. He wanted to press his fingers into the inside of Draco's wrist, to feel the thin skin there.
"So soon?" she asked, her gaze lingering on Draco, concern creeping into her expression.
"Just as it makes sense that I marry a pureblood. Someone rich and well-connected," Draco said, his voice going soft even as his gaze drifted down to Harry's shoulders, his arms.
"A poem?" Ron asks, his entire expression brightening as he looks at Harry. "Let's hear it then."
They'd gone halfway around the lake before Draco stopped and broke the silence. They were by the bridge that bisected the lake, Draco's gaze following the path around the lake, as though contemplating the view. Then, as though making up his mind, he pressed his hand more firmly onto Harry's arm and pulled him onto the bridge. When they were about a quarter of the way through, Draco slowed down, his steps as short as he could make them without stopping completely.
Draco snapped his attention back to Gregory in front of him, to those wide blue eyes and that soft smile. There would be no hardship in letting Gregory Greengrass love him, in one day, perhaps, loving him in return.
Harry loves the way Draco's fingers dig into his back, the low whine in his throat as Harry moves back and changes the angle again. He loves the way Draco throws his head back, the way he can't seem to get a full breath as Harry speeds up, how he's doing his best to keep his eyes on Harry, how Draco's hands twist in the sheets.
"Obviously not. A Malfoy waits for no one," Draco had answered.
"And much to gain," Draco added.
"It's too bad most of them are either already married or committed," Harry said, following the elegant spread of Draco's fingers. "Things would be much simpler, otherwise."
Draco still says nothing.
He wished he could do what Draco was doing, wished that it were that easy to exist in that particular room, with that particular group of people. He wished the world wanted different things from him, that he couldn't hear the way the mothers were talking about him, weighing his name and fortune against the fact that he hadn't held an actual job in the past five years. He sighed as the group closest to him finally made up their minds and started towards him.
Draco smiled. "We're in agreement, then."
But that second to last Sunday in September, Draco's off with Blaise and Pansy and Harry's at home, trying to figure out what he's doing wrong. He understands that most of the failed attempts at telling Draco he loves him are due to spur of the moment things he can never hope to control. It still doesn't change the fact that Harry loves Draco, wants to tell him, and hasn't found a way to do it. So, he puts the Internet to good use and goes on a hunt for advice from various websites.
Harry laughs. "Am I supposed to be something pretty?"
"I won't bring children into this world," Harry said, at last, because that was easier to say than the rest of it. "They've always wanted everything from me but I can't give them that. I won't."
Harry knew what came next. The right thing to do would be to buy a ring, to propose to Draco and ask his mother to forgive Harry's lapse in judgment. He and Draco would sneak away for a quick wedding. They'd have to proclaim their love to the world upon their return, saying that the rush was because they couldn't stand to be apart from each other a moment longer. Harry would buy a ring and Draco would wear it andâ€¦and Draco would be his.

Draco stops midway to hanging up his cloak  and doesn't move. Harry watches him, trying to figure out what's happening. He senses something went wrong and when Draco turns to him with a carefully cool expression, he knows something's up.
Draco took a step back, untangling his arm from Harry's.
Except, Harry had fought and died for the same cause, and all he'd had to show for it was a cottage near the sea and no idea who he was outside of a long-finished war. He'd known what the Wizarding World wanted. He'd known they expected him to marry Ginny, or to marry some other pretty girl who'd be good at magic and who'd paint a pretty picture on his arm. He was expected to dedicate the rest of his life to fighting for justice, to rebuilding what had been broken during the War. He'd have to have children, of course. Because how could the hero of Wizarding Britain not have heirs? How could he deny the world the privilege of his offspring? Of more potential Harrys who'd make the world a better place.
"Oh, for sure," he said. "I saw Mum pull out Aunt Muriel's favourite hat, and you know how Ginny feels about that."
Draco shook his head sadly. "She's never letting you go now."
It involves, among other things, Draco Malfoy, the poshest restaurant in wizarding Britain, a chocolate and raspberry mousse cake, and a declaration of love stencilled over the top in powdered sugar. But, Harry supposes, that might be getting ahead of himself.
There would be no heirs and there would be no marriage, so there could be no Draco in his life.
Sometimes it was difficult to remember that what he and Draco were doing wasn't real. Harry had become accustomed to meeting Draco at an event and reserving two dances, one at the beginning of the night and one at the end. They'd spend the rest of the time lost in conversation about the decorations, or about the Weasleys, joking about Ginny's engagement to Luna Lovegood. Sometimes Draco would dance with other people. Sometimes he'd say no and stay with Harry the whole night, both of them pushing the limits of what was appropriate.
"I need a moment," Draco said at last.
They're looking at each other, the moment heavy. There's something about the closeness and the absence of the usual city noise that makes everything hotter and more intimate. Draco shifts as Harry moves and they both freeze as Draco shakes and Harry tries not to come.
He called out Harry's name when he came into his hand, shivering with the aftershocks. And he knew, deep down in his bones, that it was too late. He was already in too deep with a man who had no intention of marrying him.
"Why is it so loud?" he asks, trying his best to move past his second failed attempt at declaring his love to Draco.
Every morning there would be a new article from Lady Red, speculation about a love match and how enamoured Harry seemed. The more the days passed by, the harder it was to watch Draco from across the room, or across the street, and do nothing. Harry couldn't stop himself from going to say hello when they met by chance along a crowded boulevard. He visited often, sent gift after gift, pretended as though it wasn't great fun courting Draco. He pretended he wasn't taken with Draco's quick wit and his barely appropriate flirtations. He pretended he wasn't obsessed with the way Draco held onto Harry's arm just a moment too long on their walks, how he didn't move away when Harry stepped a tad too close.
"There are people watching," Draco said through gritted teeth.
Harry does his best to fight back his laugh. "Oh? And I suppose you've never been attracted to any dark-haired men in your life."
"Your mother's been gone a long time," Harry said.
"Draco," Gregory said, coming to a stop in front of him. "I'm ever so sorry that I wasn't able to get away earlier. There was a minor incident in the kitchens."
Percy, Charlie, Fred, and George were doing an equally good job of avoiding Mrs Weasley, gathering to talk and scattering when Mrs Weasley got near. Harry watched them too, wondering how it was that Mrs Weasley didn't lose hope as she failed again and again to round up her children. He'd asked Ron whether they shouldn't do something but, for once, Ron wasn't the target of Mrs Weasley's ire and he intended to keep it that way. Hence, the reason why Harry had spent the better part of an hour leaning next to the closest exit.
"And stop taking poetry advice from Ginny," Hermione says, looking up from the little piece of parchment she'd taken from Ron earlier. "Also, you really should stop doing what people on the Internet tell you to do. You know better than that."
"Ah, yes," Ron had said the first time. "Now you and Malfoy can be posh prats together."
But he couldn't marry Draco. He couldn't put someone else through the never-ending rotation of rabid reporters, the demands from people who didn't even know them, the questions about children and destinies. Harry couldn't do it again. He'd left the Wizarding World because he couldn't stand the endless expectations, or the idea that by doing nothing he was letting everyone down. He preferred to be nobody, but if he married Draco, he had to be someone. He had to come back to London, had to be part of Wizarding society again, had to show his face. For Draco. For his family.
Harry is still not sure he believes Hermione's innocence with regards to the quiz. But the memos, on top of a shitty week, mean that all Harry wants to do now is listen to Christmas carols and the way Hugh Grant stammers his way, endearingly, through his declaration of love. Though, if Harry's honest, there are parts of the movie that leave a lot to be desired.
All in all, it had been a good day and Harry was still there, sitting next to Draco, taking in the sun coming through the windows.
Maybe he'd be a little rough when they finally fucked, just enough that Draco might feel it the next morning when he stretched. Just enough that Draco would remember Harry moving in him, holding him down, making him come. Doing it over and over until Draco could feel his orgasm building as it did now. He muffled his groans against his arm as he thought about Harry's hand on his mouth, shutting him up, keeping him quiet, pressing down hard.
"I was always the Boy Who Lived, and then I was The Chosen One, and every day of my life, I was just what everyone else wanted me to be. I did what they expected me to do. I became an Auror because that's what I was supposed to do. And when I realised that it wasn't what I wanted to do, when I finally decided to do something for myself, nobody could accept it. So I left and I promised I would never again let them tell me what to do. That everything I did from there on out would be my choice and my choice alone."
"She works fast," Harry said.
"You don't have to marry me," he said. "I apologize if I made you feel as though you had no choice in the matter. You always have a choice. As do I."
For a long time, he stared down at his ring, unseeing, imagining that he could hear Harry walking up to him, standing just a tad too close at his side. He could almost feel the way their sleeves would brush against each other, as Harry took his coat off, despite the windy night.
"What's all this?" Draco asks when he steps through the fireplace and sees the things on the table.
Everything Harry had ever wanted was unravelling before him and all it had taken was Cormac McLaggen walking up to him in Diagon Alley and saying, "So, what's it like having your tongue halfway down Draco Malfoy's throat?"
"We shouldn't be engaging in such trite and tired filmography," Draco says, as he scans through the titles on Harry's bookcase. "But I suppose, if we must watch something, it's better we go with the enemy we already know."
Harry watches as Draco reaches up and tugs out a pair of earbuds. The sharp stab of disappointment is almost enough to mask Harry's surprise. He can hear the pop music blasting from the headphones and he winces in sympathy for Draco's ears.
Harry knew they were friendly, that most of the purebloods had known each other since birth. Draco himself said that he wanted to marry into a pureblood family, so it wasn't that far of a leap to imagine that he might choose Blaise. After all, Blaise was rich and beautiful, well-bred and important. Harry and Draco had talked extensively about Draco's preferred suitor, so Harry knew that Blaise was a potential candidate. He just hadn't given Blaise too much thought because of Gregory Greengrass and his constant need to be near Draco.
He could see the men around the room pretending as though they weren't listening intently. Huxley, who had been talking to Draco before Harry came in, looked as though he was getting ready to make his move as soon as Harry committed the first hint of a social faux-pas. But Draco knew better. He could tell from the amused lift to the corner of Harry's mouth that Harry was rather pleased with himself for what he was going to do next.
It is, after all, in poor taste to declare his love for Draco when he's asking Harry to choke him.
He was expecting Harry and it wasn't a surprise to see him walk into the room close to midday. What was a surprise was the large bouquet of enchanted Damask roses he carried. They were gold, black, and white, fresh and alive but shimmering in the sunlight as though infused with coloured ink. The bouquet was wrapped in what looked like a thin sheet of gold and holding it all together was a string of pearls. It was immediately out of place with all of the other bouquets in the room, exaggerated and almost gaudy, calling attention to itself.
Naturally, the front page of the paper had been about Harry and Draco. Harry still wasn't sure how Lady Red had managed to get so many details about his supposed courtship. He hadn't told anyone but the Weasleys that he intended to court Draco, and though everyone had seen them together at the Parkinson Ball, Harry had yet to make his intentions towards Draco clear. Although, it figured that there was already speculation about his and Draco's fake relationship, even though nothing was official. It was just the way of their world that rumours seemed to travel faster than actual news.
Draco stops at the end of the hallway, a small smile playing at the corner of his lips. "Happy," he says as he heads deeper into the flat.

"Hm," Elise said, turning pitying eyes on Draco. "It's never a good idea to say yes to someone who will leave you waiting at a ball, dear. Best not to count all your owls before they're delivered."
"The time that what?" Ron asks.
Ron laughed. "Well, yeah, what did you expect? You're the Boy Who Lived, Britain's Most Eligible Bachelor. You're a catch, mate."
"Draco," Gregory said, softly.
"And men," Harry said.
Just as from the doorway, Narcissa said, "For me? Really?"
"Fucking is almost as good as getting fucked," Harry said, his voice getting thicker as he remembered the feel of a body above him, pressing him down into the sheets, a body below him as he moved his hips. "You don't understand what you're missing, how good it is when it's someone else touching you. How soft the inside of a mouth is. So yes, I've fucked my way through the countryside, and yes, I'm good at it. And no one is going to make me feel like I should be ashamed of it."
It had always been about lifting his mother out of poverty, of being able to provide for her, to take care of her the way his father had never taken care of them. Harry had never volunteered for that, and no matter how much Draco might want him to change his mind, he knew better than to place his hopes in impossible places. Besides, Gregory Greengrass was perfectly acceptable, rich, kind, handsome. He wasn't directly related to the main Greengrass family, but he had enough that Draco would never have to worry again. And most importantly, Gregory would be at the Bulstrode event that night, and if Harry was finally done, then there was nothing else for Draco to do than go to the ball and seal the deal.
Breakfast was a silent affair after that, Draco doing his best to swallow past the burning in his throat while his mother chatted about Zabini's dinner the following week. Harry showed up as soon as breakfast was over. Draco was tempted to deny him entry, but his mother opened the door and Draco wasn't strong enough to fight his mother when she got an idea into her head. And that was how he ended up at the park near the Manor. Harry had presented Narcissa with a beautifully wrapped parcel. She'd taken one look at all the bright green ribbon and had said yes before Harry had even finished asking for permission to take a walk with Draco.
