Harry cast a wandless Tempus and determined that they had slept halfway through dinner.
“You said you were here on Ministry business!”
A simple unlocking charm, a diffindo on the padlocked filing cabinet, four minutes of frantic searching and he had got what he wanted.
As has been proved to Draco time and time again, girls are extremely dangerous.
He darted in and stole two pumpkin pies from the Slytherin table, then rushed back up to the dormitory. He did not see his old headmaster, watching the chaos from inside a gilt-framed portrait, eyes twinkling.
He felt an invisible hand touch his cheek.
When he looks back, Neville is holding out a bottle of butterbeer to him, smiling.
“I can’t tell you,” Harry mumbled, reaching out.
He lets Harry put his hands on his hips, rock them together, and lean in till their foreheads are nearly touching. The proximity is making him dizzy and his knees are going to give out any second. Harry’s eyes are blazing. He looks more determined than Draco’s ever seen him. The music is thumping, but Draco thinks his heart may be thumping louder.
In mid-November, in Flitwick’s second dance class, they partner each other again, even though Harry could have chosen anyone. He’s puzzling this out when Harry says in his ear:
“I do,” said Draco.
“Oh no you don’t. What kept you at work so late?”
“So what did they use?” asks Potter. Draco listens to this conversation but feels a little bit like he is in two places at once, both sitting at the eighth year table and also watching it from the Slytherin table on the other side of the room. Potter nudges him. Draco stares back vacantly. Then Potter reaches over him to grab the rosemary potatoes, and dishes some out onto both their plates.
the cereal, for Christ’s sake.”
Harry doesn’t need asking twice, he walks over to Draco immediately. Draco was sure he’d refuse, if not because it was
Harry returned the kiss, opening up. He tasted sweet, and nervous, and willing.
Canary Creams are an awful trick, and Draco has never forgiven Pansy for slipping him one after he said her new haircut made her look like a weimaraner.
Potter’s other hand settles firmly Draco’s waist, burning a hole though his jumper. It’s been so long since he was touched by anyone like this, in an intimate way. And now his face is burning. Potter is so very close. It doesn’t make sense, but he feels a strange jolt through him, a feeling telling him anything is possible, and perhaps he hasn’t ruined everything.
He takes it, although he hasn’t had a drink all year. He thinks about drinking after every Transfiguration lesson, but NEWT year is so stressful he thinks that if he starts drinking he might never stop. He opens the butterbeer anyway.
The other Potter burst into the dormitory, huffing and puffing.
Any other year, that would not have passed an excuse. But Potter looks like he needs sleep. Besides, he earned it.
“Are you alright, Draco?” asks Neville, who has appeared by his side. Draco thrusts the bottle (which he has miraculously not spilled) into Neville’s hands and nods wildly. Harry shoots Neville an odd look and Weasley says something to him in a low voice that Draco can’t hear.
“Last year, when I was here and you were… dancing.”
“Yes, because you’d never spy on anyone under that cloak, would you?” he spits. And then feels stupid, because he’d managed half the term without dragging up the past, and they’d almost been getting along.
“I said, I’ll lead.” Potter grins. “I’m taller.”
“Taking a shit, Potter, what do you think!” he yelled incredulously. The Potter holding on to him burst out laughing.
The Niffler girls? Hermione— Granger will go on a rampage if she knows third years have been invited to a party with alcohol present.
“But the cereal floats, so it’s not like you can see— look, I’m not having this conversation again.”
Malfoy switched the light off and settled back down under the covers, letting Harry run a hand up and down his side, and shifting forward until they were nose to nose, feeling their magic spark off each other and create a fierce, tugging heat.
“Ah,” he groaned, putting it back on the table. Realisation slowly dawned on him. “This must be a Wheeze.”
He can join the queue behind the rest of the wizarding world. Although, the rest of the wizarding world isn’t here right now.
“Busy? Doing what?”
Shifting slightly and pulling a face at the stiff feeling in his back, he assessed his surroundings. He was once again alone in the common room, still on the ratty red sofa, but this time he was underneath a great heavy weight. The weight was breathing softly and quietly. Even though the fire had gone out leaving the room in darkness, he could tell who it was.
“You can’t Apparate inside Hogwarts!” said Draco, appalled.
“Do you need me to find you a Weasley?” he asks softly, before realising a split-second later that if she has had a lover’s tiff with the Weasel, that was about the most insensitive thing he could have said.
Tonight, Draco lets himself be. He lets a tipsy-looking Hermione kiss him on the cheek, and he lets Ron cuff him on the shoulder, and he lets Harry pull him onto the glittering marble dance floor and whirl him and whisk him away, until everything but them is just sounds and colours, and lights and laughter, and he lets himself be dipped.
This morning? Perhaps Harry hadn’t lost a dangerous magical artifact capable of resurrecting a murderous megalomaniac, if Draco was still alive. Perhaps everything was going to be fine. But why would Potter miss him if he’d seen him this morning? Whenever this morning happened to be…
“Yes, Harry obviously it’s the safest place for him, and of course the Weasley’s are nothing but the picture of kindness so it makes sense that they would extend the invitation, but this early? Surely, The Order knows something that they’ve failed to share with us,” Granger replied though still clearly lost in her own world of thought.
Harry’d gazed down at him with eyes so bright, a flush spread over his cheeks, and Draco had known then and there that he was in love with Harry Potter. Sure, he’d fancied him for a long time, even fantasized about him, but he had never been hit full force with just how deep and fond his feelings had been until that moment; like a blow to the head from a bludger. And he’d made sure to address the brunette as Harry as often as possible, especially when he found himself beneath all that warm bronze skin.
Harry wasn’t willing to fully admit it to himself yet, but he knew deep down that he was addicted to being near Malfoy. He was finding more and more excuses to be around him even if he couldn’t always justify them to himself, Malfoy, or Hermione and Ron.  For the past few weeks Harry had spent his evenings in the common room curled up in the overstuffed arm chair across from Malfoy reading one of the various books he had selected for him. Harry realized that while he did love getting lost in the storyline and leaving his own world behind him for a little while, it was really the conversations with Malfoy that he craved. After Harry finished one of the books Malfoy would always ask what he thought and they would share their views and ideas, and Malfoy really listened to him. Not only that, but he found that he really enjoyed listening to Malfoy, he always had really good insight and made Harry think about the characters or the storyline in new and interesting ways. So now not only was Harry addicted to exploring new worlds that he could lose himself in, but he was also addicted to listening to Malfoy’s feelings and notions, inquisitive to know if they aligned with his own.
Malfoy finally lifted his eyes to meet his, and Harry was overcome with the sincerity of Malfoy’s words. He could see the pure terror the other boy felt at recalling that summer, and he knew the terror, he had felt it himself when in the presence of Voldemort and it was horrific.
, after snogging the life out of him surely it would only be standard to start on a first name basis. Harry dragged his hand roughly through his already untidy hair and huffed out a ragged breath.
George led the way, “I’m tallest I’ll be able to see blonde from a mile away, no problem.”
“Good morning Potter, it appears you’ve lost your way. Granger and Weasley are down there,” he says with the wave of his hand and a slight roll of his eyes. Malfoy internally chastises himself at being so uncouth, but he can’t help it something about Potter just catches him off guard.
“To get through the day,” Harry replied nipping at his bottom lip.
Harry admitted to himself that it was not only nice to view Malfoy as actually human, but also to have someone he felt he could completely be himself around. That wasn’t to say he couldn’t fully be himself around Ron and Hermione, it was just that there were things about him that they could never truly understand, at least not in the way Malfoy could. He found that he clung less and less to the letters received from his two friends that summer, and instead hung on every word, every exchange, and every glace from the blonde boy. Although, Harry knew he couldn’t dodge his friends forever, not that he was dodging them per say, it’s just he knew in his heart that he wasn’t ready to share his reformed views on Malfoy with them yet. Partly because he was hesitant about how they’d both react, and partly because he wasn’t sure he knew how to classify them himself. How did he feel about Malfoy?
“Better?” Dumbledore asked with a look that seemed to irritate Harry more than what he’d just experienced with Malfoy did. However, the headmaster didn’t wait for a reply but instead continued, “I cannot stress enough to both of you, that this was just a small example of the pain you could experience when apart from one another, the greater the distance or time separated from one another the greater the pain. With that being said, you’ll both depart on the Hogwarts Express tomorrow morning. Harry, your uncle will be at King’s Cross to retrieve you both and is aware that Draco will be with you for the duration of the summer.” The headmaster didn’t wait for Harry’s reply before turning towards Malfoy, “Draco, you’re already aware that your parents will not be there tomorrow, and we have the necessary precautions in place should they try to interfere at all.”
“Really?” Draco responded still a bit sheepishly.
That was probably what had Draco twisted up so much, he knew his biggest fear was going back to pretending he hated Harry. He was absolutely certain he’d be awful at it now. Honestly, it was hard to remember a time where he’d never touched Harry, never felt how warm his skin was, how assured his lips were, or certain his touch. How could he go back? He knew if he was forced to pretend the summer hadn’t existed, he’d be more likely to spend the days seeking out starkly dark hair, and sharp green eyes. His rude looks wouldn’t be able to hide or suppress the deep longing he was bound to feel with or without the bond still intact.
“I’m sorry, it’s really my fault Hermione was helping me with something, and I lost track of time. I knew you were just around the corner and I thought it’d be fine, but I forgot that time can make it worse…I was too long…”
“Merlin, I’m concerned. Draco really has done a number on you hasn’t he?” Although, when Harry glanced up, he could tell her smile was fond. Harry could do nothing but smile back at her sheepishly, knowing damn well there was no way he could deny it; Draco really had done a number on him.
Harry let out a laugh, “I’ve already come Draco.”
Draco watched as the brunette let out a huff of breath before donning a wide grin, “that is probably the hottest thing I’ve ever heard.”
Draco appeared to be snapped back to the present at Harry’s suggestion, and promptly let out a noise of bewilderment. “If you stop now Potter, I think it might kill me.”
Of course, he was afraid to face the world. However, the people he was afraid of most, the people whose approval mattered more to him than anyone wouldn’t matter anyways. He knew his parents would never accept his relationship with Harry, it went against every basic pureblood standard, fuck the extensive ones. Loving Harry was pretty much either a death sentence or cause for disownment in the Malfoy family and most other pureblood families as well.
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
She returned his smile, and just as she pulled back her hand, the rest of the Weasley clan burst into the dining room and all at once the small space was filled with shouts and bouts of laughter. His eyes instantly found Harry’s and the gentle smile remained on his face for the rest of dinner.
Harry knew he shouldn’t skip classes; he knew he shouldn’t worry Draco which is exactly what he knew he would be doing if Draco decided to skip a day’s worth of classes leaving him devoid of the other boy’s attention. But he knew he needed, with all of his being, to read the book Draco had given him. Harry mused that the novel itself was not incredibly long, and that if he really put his mind to it could easily finish it all in one sitting. Perhaps he could even be finished by the time Draco returned from classes that afternoon and they could attempt to put their game to rest.
“What?” Harry watched Draco turn to look around, probably in search of whatever had Harry in such a twist, and then back to look at him.
Draco pulled away with a laugh, fully intending to finish his explanation.
Harry couldn’t help but let out a laugh at that, “I mean you aren’t wrong; you are an absolute wanker but you’re my wanker you daft git.”
Each face held a different emotion; Fred and George were grinning like idiots like they’d known all along and were now confirming for their records, Hermione looked concerned probably for their well-being Harry mused, and Ron just looked nervous and uncomfortable which Harry decided was much better than angry.
“What are you thinking about Potter,” Draco asked, turning over onto his side to face Harry and grace him with his gray eyes.
“You’ve gone soft, Malfoy, you know that don’t you,” Harry teased with a grin knocking their shoulders together making the bond thrum and the ache slacken. “I wonder who’s fault that is, Potter,” Draco replied soft smile fully in place.
“Of course, that’s not the only reason though Ron. I need you to understand that. Draco’s different, and he’s different because he wants to be not just because of me. This all just sort of happened, it’s not like he or I asked to be in this position. But I won’t lie and say I’m unhappy with the result…This summer has been the best one of my life, you know what summers are like for me.”
Harry smiled at Draco, patting his thigh gently as he leaned back, “lift up darling” he spoke softly. Draco complied and Harry pulled the saturated piece of fabric off and admired the blonde’s leaking cock. The head was an angry red, probably angry with Harry for all the teasing, but it didn’t matter he was about to rectify that.
Of course, a side effect of their heart to heart had been that Draco was now incredibly nervous that everyone at the burrow already hated him and therefore he’d be completely unwelcome. He couldn’t help but give Draco a warm and reassuring smile, knowing Hermione’s letter would ease his anxiety on the matter just a bit.
All Harry could do was smile softly, placing his chin in his palm and leaning against their kitchen island as he watched Draco scurry around picking up bits of clothing and tossing them in the hamper.
Draco couldn’t help but smile fondly at the daft git. He was absolutely sure he would never get used to just how little Harry seemed to care about what others thought of him. Their eyes met, and Harry ran his fingertips down the side of Draco’s face, he was helpless to do anything but lean into the touch and let his eyes close.
Now however, something seemed to bubble under their touch. A building electricity that drew goose bumps along their flesh in an alarming yet, thrilling way.
Potter looked at him for a moment before replying with, “yeah” and a curt nod of his dark brown head.
“No, please trust me, this was enough, I-“ but he was cut off by the blonde.
As always, great minds think alike. Harry let go of Draco’s aching cock long enough to hastily yank the front of his bottoms down enough to fully free him, and Draco didn’t think twice before pulling Harry by the arse flush against him, cocks aligning earning a groan from both boys.
“Yeah well it’s either that or you sleep under the bed, there’s no room on the floor, and my lovely aunt and uncle would rather die than have a wizard in their guest room or on their couch.” Potter trailed off a little before continuing more softly, “and I don’t think sleeping in separate rooms would be comfortable,” Potter finished the statement without meeting Draco’s eyes.
“NO!” Harry starts a little too loudly…”no, no, I’m sure this is great, yeah?” he finishes with a curt nod, feeling anxious.
I am so thankful for the feedback I've gotten so far! I'm definitely inspired to write and to post more chapters for your viewing pleasure! <3
“Couldn’t have been worse than any of the others yeah?” Harry spoke as he rolled over onto his stomach, chin in his hands to hide what was left of his morning problem from the now very awake Malfoy.
Draco’s eyes shot up, so unused to the noise as he realized the boys had almost whispered their entire conversation. However, before Draco could think of another Whitty remark in the hopes of making the other boy laugh again, the door was yanked open and the portly man who had delivered them from the train station was staring at them with a face so red, at first glance you’d think he was about to burst into flames.
That image had scared him more than Voldemort. You-know-who had been around all along, spoken about and rumoured to be here or there, until he was. The state of terror that was Draco’s life appeared gradually, like a frog being boiled alive.
“How do you turn people back? This one didn’t seem too happy about it.”
Not to hurt him. Of course not. Just to get his attention. Muggleborns got terribly offended about things like broken bones, forgetting that with Skele-gro potion, non-magical injuries could be healed within a moment. There was no need to take a simple conversation starter so seriously.
knew them, which makes it even worse…”
Draco pulls Harry’s other hand further up his back to the correct position, then missteps and steps on Harry’s foot. Forget about NEWTs, this dancing is driving him insane.
. Weasley is already pulling Harry up the stairs, but Granger is looking across the room. “Hang on…”
“I am! I dropped something into a well by accident while at work and it’s very important that I get it back, and I’m paid by the hour so technically I am on business, and by the way I wasn’t here at all, if anyone asks. Not that they will. I’m pretty sure it landed in the biscuit tin in McGonagall’s office, and I should be able to get there without anyone noticing.” Harry checked his watch, which had no face, and at least fourteen silver dials. He pulled the invisibility cloak around his shoulders and reached for the doorknob. Then stopped.
“Goodnight,” Harry insisted.
He hasn’t spoken to Granger since he sent her a terribly long, rambling, and overly sincere apology letter in June. And he doesn’t want to talk about it.
Draco couldn’t help but briefly indulge in a thousand-yard stare at this display of obtuseness, expecting the Potter pressing up against him to commiserate, but he was Potter as well, so he didn’t. The hand that had covered his mouth now rested at Draco’s waist. He was watching Draco expectantly, clearly relying on him to save the situation.
“Malfoy!”
Harry looks equally surprised to notice he’s in a room full of people, but none of the people are noticing them. They are all pointing up at the enchanted sky, letting out gasps and adjusting tiaras as they tilt their heads back.
Harry stopped mumbling about his invisibility cloak, which he had unfolded from a pocket deep inside his robes. Undetectable extension charms were also illegal, and using them to expand pockets just to look slim was an incredibly dandy and un-Potter-like thing to do. It was almost like wherever he lived in the future, he had some fashionable person taking care of his clothing choices for him.
Draco frowned.
“What are you doing? Spying on me?”
“Is this my Dad’s school record?”
“Hey, Ron. Nice to see you. Have a bean.”
It’s hard to hear anything over the music and the stamping, so Neville leans in close to Draco’s ear.
“A weasel, obviously.” Draco’s hand crept up to Harry’s shoulder, resting carefully at the edge of his collarbone. “Nominative determinism.”
“Don’t tell Hermione,” he says, breath smelling like firewhiskey, “but that’s Saoirse and Aoife.”
“I’m afraid I can neither confirm nor— oh, don’t look at me like that, of course I will!”
Harry opens it carefully, taking in the worn parchment and faded ink. Draco thinks he can see the words ‘horse’ and ‘custard’ in the
and reached for his wand. Draco decided to intervene, lest anyone be prematurely Obliviated, gently removing the warm hand covering his mouth.
This had the perfect potential for pissing Potter off, and if he kept it up, he might find himself pleasantly slammed against a wall and ravished one of these days. He certainly hoped so.
“Good point.”
He’s pulled out of his reverie when Potter grabs his hand. He spares a moment to lament how dreadfully pale his skin looks in comparison to Potter’s, until he registers Potter’s mouth moving.
A few years ago that would have provoked Potter into a delightfully cross expression and clenched fists. But it doesn’t anymore. Harry pinches him in the side, making him yelp and laugh on reflex like being tickled.
The doorknob rattled, and Draco found himself yanked into the bedroom’s adjoining bathroom. Potter shoved a hand over Draco’s mouth, which proved that whoever this Potter was, he was still an idiot. Any witch or wizard worth their salt would have cast a Langlock to hush him up, and anyone dangerous would have disarmed him immediately. This Potter, wherever he had come from, had him pressed up bodily against the door. He looked very worried and, sadly, like he wasn’t thinking about ravishing.
by Mary Snell-Hornby. He needs to borrow that book for his Ancient Runes class but she always seems to have it. He wonders if she even needs it anymore, or if she’s just holding on to it to force him to come and talk to her.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“Oh, yeah,” says Seamus. “I forgot.” He takes another big spoonful of trifle. Longbottom looks at Weasley, and Weasley looks at Potter, and Potter winks at Draco and tries not to laugh. Granger starts a conversation with Girl Weasley about the new perfumery in Hogsmeade and Potter passes Finnigan his invisibility cloak under the table.
Draco makes a beeline for the nearest bench, and as he sits down Potter unravels into visibility. He stuffs the invisibility cloak into his bag and ruffles a hand through his hair nervously.
Granger is sitting at one of the tables along the window, nose buried deep in
Neville nods towards the two gorillas, who are swinging from a light fixing and hollering. He’s never seen this level of mischief in the eighth year common room, and it’s frankly terrifying. But funny. Mad, actually. He takes a long swig of butterbeer and giggles, feeling joy bubble up from somewhere he’d forgotten. Then Potter comes up looking cross and drags him away by the arm.
“Everyone did.” It’s true, but it’s a poor defence.
“—to…the Yule Ball,” he finishes lamely. Granger narrows her eyes shrewdly.
Then, without waiting for an answer, Potter is whisking him, whirling him, they spin past other couples and the room is a blur, the music seems to get faster and Draco is led backwards and turned and spun and Potter is so warm and Draco can’t breathe, he doesn’t know how much time has passed and he clings on tight until they stop in the centre of the room.
“Draco,” Harry interrupts loudly, stopping their dance and accidentally drawing the attention of the other eighth year couples around them. “Please will you go to the Yule Ball with me?”
The hall is beautiful, decorated in hundreds of gold and cerulean baubles, and lametta draped over each of the twelve exquisitely decorated fir trees. Harry’s wearing the green robes that bring out his eyes, and he’s tried to do something to his hair and it hasn’t worked, and Draco loves him all the more for it, and thinks very hard about leaning up and kissing him but he feels weak at the knees again and just a smidgen overwhelmed.
“Just in time, Harry. You can partner Mr Malfoy, please.”
“I love you.”
“I’m hiding from Hermione. She’s trying to make me revise.”
“Head Boy!” They all chorus in a sing-song way like primary school children. They do this all the time, but Longbottom doesn’t seem to mind. In fact, he seems to like the attention.
“Explain.”
Harry climbed into bed clumsily, thanking Circe his partner was such a deep sleeper. His partner swiftly sat up, switched the bedside light on (temporarily blinding them both), and crossed his arms.
“Oh,” Harry said.
Draco didn’t know what a time-well was, but he wasn’t about to let Harry know that. Hang on, “fell”?
“Did you find it?” Draco asked eventually.
“Harry.”
“No, I don’t.” The smiling stopped.
is so impossible, it feels as if his limbs, along with his brain, are stuck in treacle.
“Nah thanks, Harry, I’m alright.”
After that it was easy. He waited fifteen minutes, and then when he heard screaming, ducked behind the stone statue of Joscelind Wadcock. Filch came tearing up the corridor with Mrs Norris bringing up the rear, tail high in the air.
“I know,” Draco says quickly. And then, because he’s a colossal fool, he adds: “I missed you.”
After a few moments, he turned back around to resume his nap. The common room was empty for once, perhaps due to it being an unseasonably hot day that most Hogwarts students were eager to take advantage of. He could have slept in his own bed, but Harry was fairly sure he had seen Dean and Seamus go in and not come out yet. It was perfectly silent, but that was all the more disturbing, for it suggested they were producing the sorts of noises that would necessitate a Silencing Charm.
“Malfoy, I want to talk to you,” said Potter from outside the bathroom. Potter inside the bathroom let out a soft
Draco instantly turned a rather appealing shade of Gryffindor red. After a beat or two of awkward silence, Harry became hyper aware of their intertwined legs, his palm pressed into the small of Draco’s back, and the heat pooling in his abdomen that was threatening to make itself known to the world.
“Draco? You need to breathe.” Shit. Here he is. Looking lovely. His hair’s getting too long, and Draco must remember to remind him not to cut it.
Draco tilts his head and licks his lips without thinking. Harry yanks Draco closer to him, pulls him back and they go toppling over the back of the sofa Granger and Weasley are sitting on.
“Oh, it’s fine, Harry! It wears off in an hour or two. You do know who that is, don’t you?”
“What animal would he turn into, do you think?” Harry asked, sneaking his fingers back up under Draco’s t-shirt and moving in small circles.
“Of course you are,” Harry laughed. “Only, I haven’t seen you since this morning.”
It worked for a short while. Draco’s lips migrated to his cheek, and then his neck, leaving hot, open presses over his skin. And then he cruelly pulled away, holding his affection hostage in return for answers.
When he says yes Harry lifts him off his feet, and it’s as if someone slipped felix felicis in his tea.
Potter frowns, and claws at his own chest for something that isn’t there. He stares at his palm, empty-handed, and then closes it.
“I’ll come back later, but I still want to talk to you, Malfoy.”
When he returned to the common room, present Harry was still there, lying on the sofa in his bobbled Weasley jumper, sucking on the head of a chocolate frog.
“Have you seen Ron eat?”
“That’s so I pour the right amount of cereal. It’d be too much milk otherwise. It makes perfect sense.”
ravishing, Draco found himself noticing, as his heart did a painful little trot up to his mouth. Potter’s hair had grown longer and curled around his face, like some sort of overgrown cherub. He was dressed in smart, well-fitting black robes, crested with a red and purple insignia that blurred itself when Draco looked directly at it. His body was a warm, firm press. Draco wondered whether his heartbeat was audible. It felt like it was echoing off the tiles.
It was a few days later when Ron Weasley spontaneously turned into an enormous rust-coloured crup at the dinner table. He knocked over three plates of profiteroles and a chocolate fountain, wagging twin tails and barking loudly. Hermione looked stunned, as did the rest of the students and staff, Neville choked on his slice of tart, and Ginny roared with laughter. Draco’s eyes were twinkling as he popped a chocolate covered strawberry into his mouth.
“If everyone could choose a partner, please!” Flitwick chitters. “Yes, Mr Finnigan, you can partner a wizard if you wish, of course. Say, is this everybody?”
“Come back in an hour,” Draco replied distractedly.
“This is for you.”
When he heads up to the dormitory before dinner, he trips over Hermione on the stairs. She’s crying quite horribly, tears leaking all down her face in a way that makes Draco’s stomach drop to his feet.
Asking a simple question is hardly throwing a strop, but now Draco can’t say that without sounding like he is indeed throwing a strop. “No, I didn’t use a spell, and I’m sorry if I embarrassed you. Since this year. Living in a tent for months, there wasn’t much else to do.”
“Harry. Kiss me.”
“I’ll look forward to my surprise tomorrow then. I’m sure it’ll be very surprising. Unexpected, even. Out of the blue.”
Potter looks genuinely surprised, and Draco feels his face heat.
In fact, he may never recover.
They relaxed into a cosy silence, and Harry’s brain drifted to think what form he might take, if he had eaten a bean. His Patronus was only a stag because of his father, he didn’t think he was necessarily stag-like himself. He was just Harry. It didn’t much matter anyway. Turning into a fish indoors might be a little disastrous. Or an elephant, too big for the room. Thoughts of elephants and big things made him feel a little hot suddenly, and he was grateful for Draco shifting away from him.
“Now, we’ll start with the box step—“ Flitwick is cut off by the classroom door banging open and ricocheting off the stone. There’s Potter, looking dishevelled and panting like he ran a mile. Which he probably did.
“I’m a little busy right now,” he called.
“I’m not using a time-turner,” he said. “Actually, I fell into a time-well.”
Granger shakes her head and buries her face in her hands.
“I’m asking someone,” Harry says slowly. “But I’m not sure they realise I’m asking.”
“Oh, by half an inch,” Draco argues on reflex. They both know it’s by more than half an inch. Potter shot up in sixth year, all those treacle tarts and puddings finally caught up with him.
“I mean, that’s not all I did, obviously,” he says, scratching behind his ear. Everyone at Hogwarts knows about the Horcrux hunt by now. “And we had some books, but… I got really bored, so Hermione taught me to dance.”
“Yes, you can,” she throws it at him. “Now tell me what’s going on with you and Harry before I have to hex it out of you!”
“How are you feeling?”
“Ministry business,” he repeated. “And I can’t see your badge, which means you’re an Unspeakable. You know that’s a stupid system, along with the fact that not being able to
“Fred and George released a new product today,” Neville says confidentially. “Gorilla Granola. Like Canary Creams.”
“Me and Hermione aren’t…”
“I don’t mind if you eat one,” he said. “They’re not mine.”
And it wasn’t his to take, and maybe Harry doesn’t want it, or doesn’t want him to have taken it, and maybe he should have just left well alone.
Ron took one more glance at the ferret blissfully stretched out upon Harry’s chest and burst into peals of laughter. Harry waited patiently for it to stop, and resumed stroking the ferret’s warm body. The fluffy tail twitched once or twice, but it didn’t stir.
“You never told me.”
Even the second time around, NEWTs year is revision hell. Draco doesn’t come up for air on Wednesday until he’s completed the Charms essay and perfected the spell for transfiguring a jelly baby into a candelabra. The Potions research will have to wait, because if he spends one more second in this dusty old library he’s going to set his own kneecaps on fire.
But then, remembering he was in a draughty classroom and was safe and alive, he was not relieved. Harry Potter was now the only other student without a partner, and two students without partners inevitably became each others partner.
They sit in silence for a few minutes, watching Jobberknolls swoop over the tops of the trees, until the question bursts out of him.
“Genius,” Finnigan shouts, spraying trifle. “Absolute bloody genius, those girls. I think we should invite them to—“ Ron clears his throat loudly and cuts Finnigan off, putting an arm around Granger at the same time.
“—Hogsmeade,” Harry mumbled a quarter of an hour later.
“Hey,” said Potter, craning his head. “I wanted to ask you something, before you run off to the toilet again.” Draco came to sit on the floor by the sofa, demonstrating that he was not about to run off to the toilet again.
Harry threw his head back with joyful laughter and slid an arm around Draco’s waist beside him. Not a minute later, he was gone, and a golden phoenix soared around the Great Hall’s bewitched night sky.
Relieved that Draco wouldn’t be able to notice his flushed face in the darkness, he took his hand away as Draco sat up. He chewed his lip absently and caught Draco watching him.
The gorillas, standing on the study tables and beating their chests, are getting less hairy by the minute. It’s falling off them in clumps, revealing two girls whose real hair is dyed electric purple.
He smells incredible, and Draco berates himself for thinking that, and then he panics because they’re about to dance and as much as he’s tried to hide it, Draco is all elbows and knees.
Draco nods.
Harry awoke from an afternoon nap in the eighth year common room to the sound of squeaking. He didn’t have to look far to find the source of it — it was stood directly on his chest.
No, she hadn’t done that, though Pansy would surely have laughed if she had heard him say it. But she wasn’t here. He had to write it to her in a letter and imagine her laughing instead.
“I,” he started. “I mean. It didn’t hurt, did it? Transforming like that?”
“It’s nearly one in the morning, we should all be going to bed.” Granger yawns, closing her copy of
“Oh shit oh shit oh shit,” said Harry.
“Hello,” he croaked out in a sleep-rough voice. “Where did you come from?”
—————————-------------------------------------------------------------------
They break apart again when they hear noises from the crowd.
The course of true love, and time-travel, and Harry’s life in general, never did run smooth. But it all worked out in the end.
Fuck.
Harry pulls back, and they’re both grinning like idiots, and Draco feels an inch away from saying something embarrassingly true about how he feels. He leans back in instead. He slides their lips together, forgetting all his thoughts when their tongues finally touch.
“We should dance at the ball.”
Granger looks up at him when he leaves, but he hurries off and doesn’t slow his pace until he gets to the swinging pendulum beneath the clock tower.
“Ron says—“ Harry starts awkwardly, but Draco never gets to hear what Ron says because a Niffler the size of an Indian elephant has just thundered through the courtyard with six teachers screaming after it.
The ferret stopped tapping and gave him a withering look. It was curiously familiar.
Potter in the bathroom closed his eyes and thumped his head against the wall beside Draco’s. Draco took pity on him. He must have got hold of an illegal time-turner somehow, gone back in time, and doubtless fucked it up. Draco knew that time travellers were forbidden to encounter their past or future selves. In fact, time travellers weren’t meant to be seen by anyone. A butterfly flaps its wings, and all that. It was just like Potter to ignore a simple rule and have a catastrophic effect on the entire universe.
“Ron!”
dance like
He shuffles over to the other side of the bed to give Harry space to come in and draw the hangings behind him. He gives a half-hearted attempt at breathing and then pulls the file from under his pillow.
The shock lasts for a good few seconds.
Harry Potter being dead was not something Draco had ever imagined, and even the short moments where it appeared to be truth were unendurable.
“Shouldn’t you be a dragon, then?” he murmured.
“Yes, oh.”
“Not anymore,” he answers evenly, and casts a warming charm over Draco that makes him tingle to the tips of his fingers.
Professor Flitwick is chalking elaborate diagrams of feet and arrows on the blackboard at the front of the class and nattering away. Weasley and Granger are already in hold. They’re a sickening couple — they don’t do public displays of affection very often, and that’s what makes them so sickening. They have such a secure relationship they don’t need to prove it.
“I wasn’t supposed to,” Draco chided.
“I can neither confirm nor deny,” Harry said.
you’re an Unspeakable makes it obvious that you are one. You should really change that,” he said.
“And what do you mean, I look young? How can you have fucked up this badly — time-turners can only take you a few hours into the past.”
“What do you mean, am I sure?”
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What a cheesy line...
Harry grabbed his glasses from a nearby end table, accidentally scattering some Bertie Bott’s Every Flavour Beans to the floor in the process. Putting them on, the white blur turned into a four-legged, and rather irate, pristine white ferret.
“The Yule Ball is for eighth years only. Those girls are third years.”
Weasley appears looking grim from the dormitory door behind Hermione, nods at him with a “Ferret,” and murmurs something, probably about Harry, in her ear. She gets up and smooths out her robes, and Weasley hugs her tightly.
“Good, aren’t they?” said Ron, leaning in close to peer at the ferret. “Neville turned into a chinchilla the other day.”
“Oh. I was wondering when you were going to throw a strop about that,” Potter mumbles.
column, but it’s hard to read upside down.
Dancing to music — he can’t tell where it’s coming from, but it’s very loud, and most of the other eighth years are dotted about the room, sipping drinks and dancing. Every time the gorillas stamp their feet the walls shake, and the portrait of Roderick Plumpton (now lopsided) snorts and grumbles. Draco looks over to see that the Golden Trio are squashed together on the squashy sofa by the fire. Harry’s got his leg crossed over his knee, and his foot is tapping in time to the music.
Draco lifted his head and looked at Harry through lidded eyes.
“Dance with me,” Potter says roughly.
Draco thinks back to being dipped in Flitwick’s classroom and his heart skips. But he doesn’t think he can dance right now, he’s only had half a butterbeer but it’s gone straight to his head. Come to think of it, it does taste a bit funny. There’s a butterbeer label on the bottle but it looks and smells much more like whiskey.
“Am I not… there, in the future?” Was he even alive? He knew Harry couldn’t answer. Telling someone about their own future was strictly against the laws of time.
“Including you.”
“I’m fine. I will, of course, never touch a bean again. Weasley has utterly tarnished all future confectionary experiences.”
“Do you…” He swallowed. “Together. If you want, we could— do you want to go to—“
“Oh,” said Potter, looking sheepish all of a sudden. “Well, I’ve just, um, popped in for some Ministry business. No, I shouldn’t have said that. It doesn’t matter why I’m here. In fact, let’s pretend I’m not here. God, you look so young.”
“…Are you sure?”
“What was it that you lost?” Draco asked.
Harry tried his second best stalling tactic: kissing. He propped himself up on an elbow, threw his glasses over the other side of the room, and pulled Draco down.
“No, of course you don’t. I’m not here. I just have to get something from McGonagall’s office and then I’ll be gone. Don’t tell anyone.”
“Hi,” Potter says sheepishly.
At first, Draco is relieved to see him. Potter was missing at breakfast. And nobody seemed to be talking about it. Of course, Potter was often absent, usually busy vanquishing Dark Lords and taking bludgers to the face and generally being a dramatic scar-headed twat. But after seeing Harry Potter’s body crumpled in the giant’s arms last summer, carried into the courtyard and looking as fragile as a dead bird, Draco’s heart couldn’t quite take it.
“Stop listening to me in the bathroom, you creep! I think I would know if I’m using the toilet or not!” Draco did his best to sound persecuted.
Draco sat in the common room in the late evening, pretending to read, as he watched Potter, who was also pretending to read. Lounging in a wingback chair, he turned a page in his Advanced Potions textbook every so often to keep up the appearance of reading. Slyly, in the space of a blink, he glanced at the large gilt mirror hanging beside the portrait of three dormice having a tea party. In its reflection he could see Harry patently watching him from his position on the sofa, surrounded by sweet wrappers. Potter’s attempt at pretending to read was much less convincing, in Draco’s opinion. For one thing, the book was upside-down, and secondly it was in Pamphylian Greek.
They had watched and watched each other all year, never admitting that they were, and Draco dreamed of doing something more. Of collecting a fistful of mud from the Quidditch pitch on a rainy Tuesday and slinging it in Potter’s face. Of wrenching an apple from the mouth of one of the roasting pigs at Sunday dinner and lobbing it at the back of Potter’s head.
The courtyard is blissfully empty. This far into October, icicles are forming on the edge of the fountain, and no students below fifth year are good enough at warming charms to want to stay outside during free periods.
Flitwick turns on the dusty old gramophone, sending classical music warbling about the classroom. Potter’s eyes flick to the gramophone and then back to Draco. Draco finds he can’t breathe suddenly. The very idea of dancing with
Harry dumps his messenger bag in the corner with everyone else’s, and throws a smile at Granger and the Weasel.
“And what time do you call this?”
The culprits are apprehended after Hagrid wrestles the Niffler down and locks it in the trophy room. The staff had wanted to keep it outside but couldn’t stop it barrelling towards the nearest shiny object, letting out deafening squeaks.
, Draco thought to himself, running up the stairs to the dormitory two at a time.
All too soon Potter pulls him upright, although he still feels upside-down. He’s belatedly aware of everybody in the room looking at them. A few people clap. Flitwick is so impressed that he awards twenty house points to Gryffindor, and Granger doesn’t even remind him that eighth years don’t get house points.
“They didn’t tell us what they were planning to do with it, but Minerva thinks they were training it to steal the Quidditch cup from her office. Filch nearly cried, begged her to let him use Veritaserum on them. Merlin knows where they were hiding the damn thing, it’s mammoth!”
in the top right hand corner.
“Mm.”
“Is that? The Niffler girls? SEAMUS!”
“Right, that’s enough,” shouts Weasley. Harry scrambles up and looks dazed. “If you’re going to embarrass yourself, you should at least do it sober so you remember it.”
“Excuse me?” Draco says, indignant.
Draco didn’t respond. He didn’t know what to say to Harry; he didn’t know how to communicate that his situation wasn’t pleasant or special but was actually painful and often sad.
Harry reaches out and puts his hand on Teddy’s arm. “Teddy, there’s nothing that you could ever do to make us not want you. You’re our son.”
“Right,” thought Harry, “so perhaps maybe a bit more than ‘pissed,’” he amended.
Draco placed both hands flat on the table. “Do not excuse my behaviour during the war, Potter. I did things that were unforgivable. Don’t act like I was some innocent child.”
“Well, I think it’s sweet. They both deserve something nice; they’ve been through enough as it is, and I think we should all be happy for them both.”
Draco leaned back pulling Harry with him, sliding his hands down the brunette’s body to bunch up his shirt and yank it up and over his head, pushing Harry back against the mattress and tossing the shirt over the side of the cot. Harry’s eyes were wide, and Draco met them with eyes just as large, pupils blown, and trailing down to take in all the exposed honeyed skin.
Unsurprisingly, the headmaster was the first to speak again, “Of course Harry, you do realize that both you and Mr. Malfoy have been here in the hospital wing for three days now, correct?” He paused with another telling look, “Between myself, Madam Pomfrey, Professor Snape, and several other professors here at the school we have tried every conceivable notion and remedy to beak the bond. I can assure you that every test has been run, and every counter-curse attempted. Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger can also attest to our efforts, as they were determined not to leave your side throughout the process. Of course, I’m sure you know Miss Granger was also very noble in her efforts to assist in reversing the bond as well.”
Draco knew he was getting in way too deep in regard to his forlorn unrequited feelings towards Potter. He knew he had let his heart hope too much, and once given an inch, his heart dove for a mile. He was letting his gaze, his hands, and his thoughts linger much too long on green eyes, soft skin, and unreciprocated feelings. He wasn’t sure if the bond was making it harder on him, after all, he had lived with these feelings for quite some time now, albeit, unhealthily but he had still lived with them and never felt this out of control. There were so many moments he had to control his hands to keep from reaching out, touching, grazing that bronze skin, and it was so taxing to talk himself out of it that he had reasoned aggressively that it had to be the bond, if only for his own sanity.
Severus found himself pacing his office yet again in anxious contemplation. There had already been so many shifts within the last year alone, and yet, he knew this shift would ultimately come he just didn’t know how to face it. Severus Snape was not a man who often allowed himself to wallow in his own emotion, it was easier to store it away and take it out when it was most convenient for himself than to face it head on. However, every now and again he found himself faced with moments where storing his sentiments away for a more appropriate time unviable; such as now.
Ron did have a point; the bond did sort of work at pulling them back towards one another and he tried to hone into that.
Draco felt himself exhale not at all realizing he’d been holding in a breath. The outright rejection he’d almost been expecting hadn’t come and the nudge of courage became a shove.
He looked up at the window one last time before maneuvering around the hedges lining the house and turning to inch his back down the wall and lean against the structure hidden from sight. He could still feel the distant ache of the bond, but Harry also knew that some of that ache was his own as well, separate from the bond. Harry reasoned that the ache from the bond was at least bearable and he felt a little comforted at the fact that Draco wasn’t really that far from him.
As always I love, love, love all your comments!! They keep me going and make me smile while I'm at work wishing I was at home writing!! :)
Draco let out a little huff of a laugh at having been caught out, “Only marveling at how you’ve been able to sleep through every single moment of this morning. God forbid the war begins while Potter’s sleeping, you’d sleep right through it.”
Draco was roused back with a slight tap on their bedroom door. Draco felt his heart race, as his head jerked up from Harry’s head and looked from the door, to Harry and then back to the door again. He was at a loss, he certainly didn’t want to wake up the sleeping boy curled up in his arms, but he also had no idea who was on the other side of the door.
Things heat up a little in this chapter!! We're finally starting to get to some of the good stuff... things are about to lift off a little bit both in plot, and between our two favorite boys! <3
The problem was that Draco found that after he was faced with the reality of what his father’s ideals involved, he just didn’t feel as strongly for them, which was tearing him up inside, and why he had spent the majority of the school year trapped inside himself. It was one thing to go around flaunting blood superiority when it didn’t involve murdering muggles in cold blood, but another thing entirely when he was forced to watch as Lord Voldemort and his clan of Death Eaters tortured and killed innocent people as an after-dinner sport. Deep down Draco knew he didn’t have the stomach, fanatical devotion, or zealous ambition to carry him through as a successful Death Eater. But however unqualified or terrified he was, he didn’t want to alienate himself from his parents. No matter the circumstances they were his family, Draco loved them, he didn’t want to lose them, especially not his mother. He couldn’t bear to think about what his mother might think of him if she knew what he’d spent his time agonizing over. Draco couldn’t imagine how she would feel about her son if she knew who he truly was; a coward, and not just for wanting to avoid taking the mark and following the Dark Lord. Draco knew his mother was much too clever to ever fully support someone as reckless and unpredictable as Voldemort, but she was bound by her marriage vows to always support his father; zealously ambitious.
Draco let out a noise of surprise, followed by a soft whimper in response to their new position. Draco pulled Harry in as if he weren’t already close enough. Their bodies were pressed together fully, all angles slotted together, and still Draco seemed to want more. Who was Harry to deny him anything?
When the two boys had finally come up for air, that was when Harry had been hit full force with the realization of his feelings for the blonde git. All those feelings he had shoved deeper, willing himself to save for another day, another time, but not willing to face head on in the moment had come breaking to the surface like they’d been drowning and needed to suck in as much air as possible.
“There’s really no easy way, or right way to go about these things are there?”
“Should I wait to speak with him then? I don’t want to muck it up or make anything worse.”
Draco had been awake long before he slyly watched Harry try, and fail, to stealthily dress and exit their room. He had to hold back an eye role as he watched the brunette stumble around hastily, pulling on various pieces of clothing that had been strewn about on the floor. Draco had to hold in a smirk as he watched Harry pull on a white t-shirt that definitely belonged to Draco, heating a little on the inside at the thought of something he owned flush against warm skin, he knew when it was returned to him it would smell like Harry.
There was a pause, which encouraged Draco to add, “I think they thought I had a right to know the truth because Severus did it for me, however daft the decision was he made it with sincere intentions. Dumbledore didn’t have much to say but I could tell he was furious nonetheless.”
Then potter does something that completely catches Draco off guard. He full on grins at Draco. The toothy, eyes bright, cheeks flushed kind of grin that leaves Draco with that overwhelmed feeling that typically ignites the desire to retreat.
After a few days of little to no contact with Draco, Harry was beginning to go stir crazy. Instead of spending his evening curled up in the common room with him per usual, Draco had opted to stayed holed up in his own room. It wasn’t as if Draco was avoiding him completely, he still opted to give Harry little half smiles when he looked towards him in the dining hall or brush his arm up against him when they passed each other in the halls. But this just wasn’t enough to alleviate his craving to be near Draco, to touch him, hear his laugh, talk to him, kiss him…
*****
Draco looked into Harry’s emerald eyes, clinging to their warmth, “I know I’m in love with you, and for me the love has been there for
In his keen desire to zone into the whispered conversation while still appearing asleep, he hadn’t realized that warm fingers were still encasing his hand.
Draco didn’t dare say anything, instead he snaked his arms around Harry’s back and curled into his touch. After a long moment of silence, he felt the brunette take a deep inhale before speaking into Draco’s neck.
Draco couldn’t help but smile, “This actually,” he said with a gesture between the two of them.
“Friends. Only, can we at least be the kind of friends who snog…secretly of course…”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You Slytherin’s have an odd way of talking, is it always that stiff and proper or just when you’re both pureblood prats?”
“Oh I want you to, merlin Draco, I want you to.” He replied, cupping the blonde’s cheeks for good measure.
Harry let his fingertips trail his own before returning the half-smile over his shoulder on his way to join in on the game, leaving Draco desperate for more.
“So, let’s not think,” Draco huskily whispered, wet against his ear. The admission went straight to his cock.
Harry stayed put, “Honestly? You’re so sexy I think it may kill me,” he spoke to Draco’s lap.
He knew at once that he was failing miserably at hiding his diminutive break down when his eyes locked with Harry’s. He took a deep breath to steady himself and reign himself in and then graced Harry with a soft half smile, their signature, before vacating any remaining emotion from his face. He could tell that Harry was worried, the brunette had never been even a little practiced at hiding his own emotions and Draco was sure that it was difficult to look at Draco like this after so long of being fully let in. Shit, it was hard for Draco to go back to this place after allowing himself this summer of reprieve. But Harry knew, he knew that Draco had to do what was necessary to survive this year in the Slytherin dorms, they both did.
Draco pulled one hand away from Harry’s shoulder to pull out a very similar chain that had been hiding underneath his shirt. He held it up for Harry to view and inspect, blush in full effect.
Suddenly he felt off, like Draco was too far. The ache in his core was becoming more pronounced by the moment, and he let himself lean back against the shelves to try and catch his breath.
Draco felt his heart leap a little at Harry’s admittance of wanting Draco beside him, especially because deep down he knew the weight of what Harry was asking of him and what Draco was committing too was beyond them falling in love.
Harry found himself clinging to Draco more deeply, pulling his head back so he could lose himself in the skin on Draco’s neck and collarbone thoroughly enjoying the noises it elicited from the boy rocking himself above him. He knew they were both close, he could feel it in the way they both had become more frantic, more desperate against each other. Draco brought his hands back up to Harry’s face, fingers digging into Harry’s cheeks and neck, “I’m gonna come Harry.”
Harry could only smile fondly to himself and try to muster up enough will to leave the warmth of the naked boy taking up most of their cot. Harry slid from the sheets, hastily pulled some pants on, and pushed open the window to allow Hedwig in. She graciously pecked his hand in annoyance, before settling back inside her open cage and extending her leg.
Weasley was graced with another kick from Harry, and an eye-roll from Granger.
“I don’t think you messed up Draco, you told me now, in your own time. That’s enough for me. Of course, I’m a little relieved to know that if I brush past you in the hallway at school I won’t instantly come in my pants from the bond’s intensity.” Both boys let out a long laugh at that, knowing full well that they’d already overcome the full intensity of the bond, it felt more like a pleasant hum against their skin, instead of the full throttle fire etched into their veins when they touched as it had at the start. Although, Draco knew that he would always feel engulfed by the flames of the fire that was Harry Potter, bond or not; he always had.
“Harry,” Draco started, “I’m, I’m Elio, I’m too hung up on you to ever go anywhere, I’m in love with you” he breathed out quietly, feeling as if he were the bold one for once and daring himself to face his feelings head on, wanting Harry to see him fully as he was. “So, I’m Oliver then?” he said with almost a cheeky grin, pulling their joined hands to his mouth and kissing Draco’s fingertips. “Listen Draco, just to be clear the whole time I was reading I pictured myself as Elio, meaning I’m mad for you too” Harry said in almost a huff. Then almost as if for good measure added, “You know I’m not going anywhere, I’m in love with you too” paired with a pointed look that left Draco aching.
Everything they did together, every word they spoke, every moment they shared in those last few days seemed looming with
, or asked for the sacrifice of his first-born son. No, Potter had simply gotten comfortable on the sofa, as if Draco were his friend. It’s only Draco found it hard to understand how the savior of the wizarding world could want to be friends with someone like him; an ex-death eater. Of course, Draco had changed, even he could admit that to himself. He didn’t want to be associated with the ideal’s death eaters inculcated, that he even once claimed as his own. However, Draco had never, not once stated this to Potter, or to Granger, or to Weasley for that matter. And it’s not that Draco hadn’t thought about saying any of this to Potter, actually, Draco had spent a great deal of his free time recently agonizing about putting these feelings into words, and torturing himself with the idea that he didn’t really deserve any of the affection Potter had exhibited towards him lately.
“Well then what’s the problem Potter,” he asked cheekily reaching towards Harry’s jeans.
“Oh, Draco, dear – such a good boy,” she said beaming at him.
“It looks like us feeling things out, we don’t know what’s happened at your house all summer, and we should check in with Snape and Dumbledore. Can’t we just be friends at school? Surely, it wouldn’t be a stretch that after being forced to spend the whole summer together we grew out of hating each other is it?...It’s only, I just don’t…I at least don’t want to have to pretend to hate you, I’d be really shit at it and not touching you is truly going to require all of my attention.”
Both boys sat up to peer out into the direction the voice had come from and were met with the sight of three burly boys striding towards them sneers gracing their faces.
Without thinking he threw his whole body back against the dimwitted moron detaining him and was able to twist himself free of his hold. The bulging boy attempted to yank him back by the wrist, but Draco promptly turned and kicked him in the bollocks before stumbling forward again in search of Potter, trying not to think about the burning pain scorching underneath his skin. He surged forward, and within a few steps the brunette came into view along with his repulsive cousin. Without thinking Draco took out his wand, he knew he wasn’t allowed to do magic outside of Hogwarts, and especially not in front of a bunch of muggles, but he mused that they probably didn’t know that.
As Draco followed behind Harry and his uncle, he couldn’t help but notice how solemn they both seemed. Neither of them appeared to be happy to see the other, there were no hugs exchanged or even words exchanged which was quite the contrast to the goodbye Potter had shared only moments ago with the Weasley’s. Silence filled the stretch of the car ride, Draco choosing to look out the window enamored with all the muggle things he’d never seen before, realizing that he had never been in a muggle vehicle before this moment either, musing that it seemed quite ordinary. After a short ride, they turned into a neighborhood where every house looked the same, how they knew which house was theirs, was beyond Draco, but they appeared to have a system as Potter’s uncle confidently turned into the drive of one of the homes.
Now, if Harry is truly being honest with himself, he can’t ever remember a time he truly read a book for pleasure. Unless you count smuggled school books read by wand light in secrecy at his aunt and uncles house in the summertime. Or the history of quidditch volume Hermione got him for Christmas one year. But a book like this, a novel with made up worlds and characters, well that’s always been Hermione’s avenue, not his. Which is probably why Ron thinks he’s gone mental. If Harry’s really, truly being honest with himself it’s not really the need of a new hobby that had him asking Malfoy for a book suggestion, it wasn’t even really Malfoy’s change in demeanor either.  It genuinely had everything to do with the way Malfoy looked when was engaged in whatever fictional world he’d chosen that day. Harry wanted to know what that kind of escape felt like. Harry wasn’t unhappy in his own life, in fact he was probably happier than he had been for a long time, but he couldn’t deny the part of him that sometimes wished he could take a break from being the ‘savior,’ and walk in someone else’s shoes for even just a moment.
“Ron and Hermione were seriously considering having me committed during sixth year. I think I spent more time watching you, trying to figure out your nefarious plans than I did actually learning anything the entire year.”
“I thought you might like to make this for Teddy’s birthday party this weekend?” Antoni asks, looking at Draco and Harry. “It’s easy to make a big helping of, and you can showcase your newfound skills.”
“Huh,” said Harry, raising his eyebrows and watching Lily twirl away. “Well, I suppose we can wait until tonight to ask.
Harry rolled his eyes and began to assemble the ingredients he’d need to make dinner.
“Wow,” Bobby says as he enters the bedroom. “It doesn’t look like anyone even lives in here. Draco, you keep a tight ship!”
But sometime later, as Draco lay gasping beneath Harry, he whispered, “I’m glad you found your way to me, too.”
“I think giraffes are the best savanna animals because they have black tongues!” Scorpius responded quickly, leaning over to look at Al’s drawing.
“Nope.” Harry shook his head.
oOoOoOoOoOo
Draco shook his head. “This sort of thing doesn’t happen in real life. I’m the bad guy, not the one who ends up with the handsome prince at the end of the story.”
Harry shrugs. “I guess I was just nervous that it was something you’d never do, or that you might be offended that I asked you to put on such feminine things.”
“Thank you, Zayde!” Lily said, sitting up straighter in her chair and patting her riotous hair down with her rather grubby hands. Harry flicked a gentle cleansing charm in her direction before she grabbed a biscuit and ingested whatever germs she had picked up at school.
Harry waved him off, nodding. “Yeah, ‘course.”
“It’s always been him, for me. We have an acrimonious history, to say the least, but we’ve gotten past all that and we have a family together. I won’t give that up for my own selfishness.”
“They’re so perceptive at this age!” groaned Hermione, rolling her eyes.
“I just… I forget, sometimes. I get so caught up in our every day that I somehow manage to forget how stunning you are. And then I’m hit over the head by you. I’m so lucky.” Harry pressed a chaste kiss to Draco’s still flushed cheek. “I’m so lucky,” he repeated.

[Footage shows Draco and Teddy taking coffee and biscuits to Harry and visiting with him at his desk in the Ministry. Draco glares at the camera periodically.]
Al took his thumb out of his mouth and added, “Movie! Yes! Popcorn too, dad?”
Draco whips his head up, his eyes widening slightly. “She gave this to you?”
“For the love of Merlin! Just go and ask him to stop it if it’s bothering you so much. Go. Now. Shoo!” She might feel bad for instigating what would undoubtedly turn into, at best, a nasty shouting match, but she had to finish this Transfiguration essay today. She didn’t return to Hogwarts to do…whatever it is Harry’s been doing for the past six weeks, which mostly involves snapping quills and staring at certain high-cheek boned blonde gits during every single class they have together. Hermione would be worried if Harry weren’t so bloody obvious. He was worse than Ron when he wanted to shag.
“The sooner I’m legally bound to you, the better,” Harry said, his smile wide and warm. “I’m yours, Draco. Always.”
Thus, this little project that I undertook following the discovery of Harry’s kink should come as no surprise to him. I suppose it might be a bit shocking to come in from conducting his Serious Auror Business (which undoubtedly involved plentiful angry-Harry eyebrows frowning at the rookies) on a random Tuesday night to find one’s husband mostly naked and draped across one’s desk. But one does what one must to keep a marriage’s fire alive.
“Papa? Can we sit near Al? I promise to eat my whole lunch and not complain and mind my manners.” Scorpius tugged at his father’s jacket to get his attention.
“I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU TOLD GRANGER BEFORE YOU TOLD ME, DRACO LUCIUS BLACK MALFOY! AFTER ALL WE’VE BEEN THROUGH, AFTER MAKING ME SUFFER THROUGH HEARING ABOUT ‘POTTER THIS’ AND ‘POTTER THAT’ SINCE WE WERE ELEVEN BLOODY YEARS OLD!”
“Right then! Please, sit. I’ve just made loads of fresh rugelach.”
oOoOFin!OoOo
[the camera pans to Teddy, who is looking at his parents nervously and fidgeting with the hem of his aunt’s sweater.]
Antoni bends down and begins to shower the small dog with love. “It’s ok! Oh, he’s perfect! Hello, new friend!”
“Potter? I thought that I was Harry, now that I’d had my tongue up your arse.”
- do you really think he would break up the family that means so much to both of you over it?”
Draco was startled out of his reveries and back to the chilly London afternoon when he nearly ran full-body into a couple who were standing in a long queue. He managed to side step them, and wondered for what they could possibly be braving the January temperatures.
Draco was taken aback. This was the second time in a decade that he’d had an actual conversation with the man, and he was suggesting that they set aside the fact that they fought on opposite sides of the war and ... what? Be friends?
“It makes me feel absolutely terrible, Teds,” Harry says quickly, “because it means that I haven’t done my job as your dad to make sure that you feel wanted and safe every second of every day.”
“No, Hugo. I’ll apologize to daddy, you’re right that it was very bad manners and against the rules.” Ron gave Hermione a champion smirk. “Why don’t you go look for the afikomen with the rest of the kids?” She asked.
The boy glanced up at Scorpius with a slightly alarmed look on his face, but he answered nonetheless. “Hi, I’m Al,” he said quietly, twisting the marker in his hands. “I’m five, too. I’m drawing the giraffes I seen at the zoo yesterday.”
“You don’t tell each other ‘I love you' much?”
“Have you two ever had an actual conversation about your feelings?” Jonathan asks, ignoring Harry’s misgivings and moving to stand in front of him.
“Yes, well, you’ve made that clear. Thank you for your hospitality. Please pass my thanks on to Saul.” Draco wrenched open the door and strode out into the night, not looking back to see Harry stood stock still in the doorway, feeling bereft and heartbroken.
“Right.” Draco clears his throat and sits gracefully, crossing one long leg over another.
“To be fair, most of the recipes are Sophia’s. I’ve just … added to them. She was the real cook in the family.”
Lily set an orange flier on the table in front of Harry and Draco. “Friday is family night at school. Mr Bowers said that we can bring as many parents and guardians as we want because every family is different and special and perfect no matter what that bum-head Charlie Vance says and I want to show you all my family tree that I made and Mummy and Nev said that they wouldn’t miss it for the world and I want you all to be there ok?” Lily had turned slightly red from not taking a breath during her brief speech.
“Yes, Jamie. You got it in one. The only reason your mother and I decided to have children was to avoid menial tasks. And guess what? Our plan failed miserably because you lot are the least helpful children in the history of creation!” Harry shouted.
“But you don’t say it?” Karamo questions.
“He’s a great kid. You’ve done a wonderful job with him.” Harry put the dry dish in the cupboard and turned to face Draco.
Tan gets up. “Oh, Rowena wept! You are stunning!” He pulls Draco over to the mirror, standing behind him.
Teddy stands up a bit straighter and takes a deep breath. “Well, if it’s a school day then Draco comes and wakes me up and I brush my teeth and wash my face and put on my school clothes.”
Draco and Harry exchange a look and Draco nods his assent. “Of course, Teddy. But Harry and I want to give you our gift first, if that’s OK?”
If asked, Draco Malfoy would say that the most irritating aspect of moving one’s life from Paris to London in the dead of winter was the difficulty in finding the particular charm that would repel the salty slush that covered the Knightsbridge streets from the bottom of one’s trousers.
“I told you!” He hissed at Draco and felt his cheeks flush.
[Antoni confessional/interview: I created a new cocktail in celebration of our inaugural episode in England! It’s called “The Drarry” and uses bitters, grapefruit, and vodka for that perfect combination of sour and sweet. Look for the recipe on our Instagram!]
“Let’s go let’s go! Everyone is going to be here and you two are taking absolutely forever!” Teddy turns and runs down the hallway.
Teddy shakes his head. “No.”
“I think they do it when they’re flirting,” Teddy says casually, inspecting a tomato.
“Zayde’s right, Dad,” Jamie said, “Mr. Malfoy kept looking at you and smiling. And then you’d smile at him. It was weird.”
“I mean, Harold, you’ve certainly grown up since your high school days… that’s a normal thing to say, right?” Jonathan amends, looking at Bobby for confirmation.
“Clean me up, you manner-less cretin.” Harry ignored him and instead rubbed his thumbs in circles over Draco’s skin, relishing the sight of him covered in cum, looking utterly debauched. Draco sighed contentedly and leaned his head back so that it rested on Harry’s shoulder. “Your worship of my arse will take you far in this life, Potter.”
“Harry.”
“Do you know my papa? Hi! I’m Scorpius Malfoy. I’m five and a half and I just moved to London from Paris. Have you been to Paris?” Scorpius had run to his father’s side, and was now standing between him and Potter. He stuck his little hand out to the other man, the mitten that was clipped to his jacket sleeve swinging wildly, and waited. Draco held his breath, sure he was about to watch his son be rejected by Potter just as he had been at eleven years old.
“Well, this is just…” Draco huffed out. Casting one last glance at his son that he hoped conveyed the depth of his unhappiness, he stepped into Potter’s waiting embrace and wrapped his arms around the other man’s hips. He allowed himself to pull him in tighter; this time his face was close to Potter’s neck and as he inhaled he smelled a dark, spicy scent underneath the cooking oil. Draco closed his eyes and allowed himself to really accept that he was currently being hugged by Harry bloody Potter.
“How did you become so well-adjusted?” Draco asked, looking at Harry suspiciously. “Honestly. What you went through … I’ve read the book. Well, I’ve read all the books about the war.”
“Mazel tov!” Everyone cheered.
Harry just stared. Was Malfoy actually suggesting that they…?
would eat it up!”
?!” Tan shouts.
“You haven’t even kissed me yet, and you expect me to call you by your first name?” Draco squawked with indignation as Harry once again flipped him around, but was silenced with the soft, searching kiss that Harry pressed to his mouth. They kissed for several minutes, hugging their naked bodies together while their lips nipped and sucked at each other.
“Nice one, Lil!” he said to his sister.
Harry was dumbstruck. That might be the nicest thing that Malfoy had ever said to him, even if it did include the threat of violence to other humans. “Erm, thanks, Malfoy.”
“Of course I’ve thought about it, but I’ve never entertained the notion in reality.”
[Ron interview/confessional: Look, it’ll be a bloody miracle if these five blokes can achieve what no one else has been able to in the past decade. But I’ll try anything to make Harry happy, you know? He’s my best mate, and he and Draco deserve each other. And if this show doesn’t work, then I’ll just lock them in a bloody closet together until they admit they’re arse over tits for each other. Am I allowed to swear?]
Draco swatted Harry’s hand out of the way. “That’s enough, Harry. I’m ready.” Draco reached behind him and put a pillow under his hips. Harry poured more lube into his palm and coated his dick thoroughly. “Are you sure you’re ready, Draco? I don’t want to hurt you.”
Given the amount of people who had gained the knowledge first hand, Harry had little doubt that the news had spread to the rest of their family and friends. It was all for the best, he thought, that he wouldn’t have to see the look of horror on Ron’s face when he first heard that he’d be in-laws with the Malfoys.
“You lying git! You do not get to run away from me this time!” He waits a few seconds, to no avail. “Fine! I will blast this door down! Just wait until Bobby sees the mess you’ve made!”
“Five? Please. You couldn’t even reach the top of a hob when you were eleven, let alone five.”
“Kreacher is very unhappy with the goings on in the ancestral home of Master Malfoy. Kreacher is expecting this sort of uncouth behaviour from Master Harry, but Kreacher knows Master Malfoy is being raised better than letting all sorts defile the noble -”
“Molly Weasley was the first person who told me they loved me,” Harry responds. “Right after Sirius’ funeral. I was fifteen.”
Harry sighs again, sounding exasperated. “Yes, Draco. I am in love with you.” He says resignedly. “I’ve bloody well been in love with you for the past seven years, you absolute arsehole. I have no idea why.”
Draco bent his head so that his cheek rested on the top of Harry’s messy curls and breathed in the intoxicating scent that now meant home: the slightly woodsy smell of Harry’s cologne mixed with the cooking oil that always clung to his hair and clothing regardless of how much time he’d spent in the deli that day.
“In all seriousness, I need to kvell a bit about my Harry,” Saul beamed and raised his glass of wine. “I count all of you as mishpocha, but Harry is the boy that Sophia and I never had. He came to us out of nowhere, and in the blink of an eye he’s taken over the deli and he and Ginny have given me three beautiful grandchildren. What more could a man want, I ask you?” He wiped away a tear. “And so tonight, I give thanks to everyone here and especially to my boychick. Hashem brought him to me and Sophia when we needed him. When we all needed each other. Cheers to you, Harry. Cheers to us all!”
“I had no idea you were all wizards,” Hermione admits, extricating herself from the hug Karamo had pulled her into.
“So, in Judaism, there’s this idea of finding one’s ‘destined,’ called b’shert. Saul always refers to Sophia as his soulmate, as the one that God had intended for him. Sophia would always roll her eyes and smile and tell him that it was quite the universe if God wanted them to go through a war just to find each other,” Harry laughed softly, his eyes shining. “I used to think that Ginny was my destiny, you know? That she was the one that the universe - or God, or however you want to imagine a sort of higher power - had chosen for me. That we, like Saul and Sophia, had endured a war and had still come together. But we never had what they had. Gin and I fit together neatly, and we had a nice marriage. Our children are the light of my life. But sometimes I think that I’d like to fall in love someday. To really fall in love. To feel the type of love that people write novels about. And if you’ve found that, then I think that’s really special. And I also think it’s unique. Not everyone has the chance to find their missing piece, you know?”
Draco lowered his flannel pants and his hard cock sprang up, jutting straight out from his body. Harry thought that he had never seen anything quite so beautiful in his life. The moonlight reflected off of Draco’s pale skin, making him look like some sort of ethereal being. He had only a light dusting of hair on his arms and legs, and his chest was almost completely bare save for a trail of fine hair that led to a thatch of strawberry blond curls above his dick. Draco’s cock wasn’t as long or thick as Harry’s, but it made Harry’s mouth water, particularly when he took himself in his fist and gave himself a few slow pumps. “Oh, Harry,” Draco breathed, closing his eyes briefly when he flicked his thumb over the slit of his cock, “I’m going to
“I apologise for his manners. We’re ... working on polite interaction with adults. What time shall I return to pick up Scorpius?”
And so, standing in front of Dr Song now, Harry closed his open mouth. He was tired, he was hot, and he was bored of fighting with Malfoy. Instead of protesting the situation further, he squared his shoulders and told himself to, in the words of Minerva when he tried to get out of rooming with Malfoy last September, “grow up and make it work, Potter.”
“Oh, Gin. I know. I miss her too.” Harry tried to console his wife, rubbing her lower back in gentle circles.
“What’s the name of that muggle god, Harry? The one that they always call out when they’re upset or having sex?”
“Where are your brothers?” Harry asked when the kettle let off a soft ding and the room was still absent Jamie, Albus, and Scorpius.
Draco pulled off. “Oh no, Harry. None of that.” He took Harry’s hand and placed it on the back of his head. “Fuck my mouth, Potter. I want you to.” Draco licked the slit of Harry’s cock before opening his mouth, waiting.
[B-roll of a Teddy pulling up red knee-length socks and straightening his tie plays while Teddy’s voiceover continues.]
They were still smiling at each other a moment later when Scorpius looked up from the table and said, “Papa, I’m hungry. Can I have my cheese toastie now? Also, Al and I are going to build a new zoo that lets you ride all the animals! Isn’t that a great idea?”
Draco didn’t respond. He sighed and let his head hang heavy between his shoulders.
Draco kept his gaze steadily on Harry’s. “Until this afternoon, I was also operating under the assumption that I now have four children. But I understand that it’s different. That James, Albus, and Lily aren’t truly mine to claim.”
“Tanny, no one from the States knows who Harry Potter is,” Antoni points out.
“I just don’t want them to leave!” Teddy cries, miserable. “They helped us so much and they are so nice and I want to keep them here!”
“Harry.” Draco let go of his dick. Harry lifted his head, making eye contact with Draco. Draco continued, “I want you to watch this. I want you to watch while I suck your cock. Sit up a bit.” Harry groaned and scooted up the duvet so that his back was against the headboard. Draco crawled up and settled between Harry’s open legs.
“You’re not going to live at Hogwarts or the Manor forever, are you?”
Lily ran to her father and gave him several wet kisses on both of his cheeks. Al rolled his eyes and acquiesced to a quick hug; Jamie put one arm around his dad’s shoulders and shouted, “Bye!” before running towards the Floo.
The tall blond laughed. “I’ll have to get that in writing. Last night Scorpius woke me up at two in the morning because he said he couldn’t sleep for wondering how gravity worked.”
Harry exhales audibly, relief spreading across his face. “Get over here, Draco! Family hug.”
Harry collapses more on top of me than next to me, given that there are two grown men trying to share a loveseat. We’re quiet for a while. I stroke his hair and he presses kisses to whatever parts of me he can reach.
If the man was surprised by this behavior he didn’t show it. He simply smiled at Harry and gestured to the empty tables. “Well, boychick, you heard her! Choose a seat. I’m Saul Weinberg, and that whirling dervish was my wife, Sophia.” He stooped to pick up a tray of what looked like tiny, spiraled biscuits, and began to arrange a few on a dish. “Are you a coffee drinker?”
“I’m covered in cum,” Draco said, running his fingers through his mess on his face and not looking a bit put out at the situation.
“I want you to ride me. Can we do that?”
“Well, me and Harry wear jammies. Draco always wears those robes that swish around so much. Uncle Ron says he just likes being dramatic and is trying to be like his godfather Severus but I dunno. I just want him to be cosy with us.”
“We want you more than anything in the whole world, Teddy,” Draco adds.
“We call him Troggy or Trogs or Sir Bites a Lot.” Teddy says proudly.
“Practice makes perfect when it comes to learning how to communicate with your loved ones. And if you’re unsure, just ask!” Karamo smiles at the three of them. “When my sons came to live with me, we all had to figure out what each other’s boundaries were, and to make sure we were fulfilling each other’s needs as best we could. You can always check in with your dads, Teddy, if you think they might be sad. And the same goes for you too, Harry and Draco.”
“Indeed. Shall we go to the Ministry tomorrow?”
“What? What’s wrong?” Draco asked, looking slightly alarmed at the expression on Harry’s face.
Edward R. Lupin.
“Oh.” Draco stopped pounding on Harry’s back, considering this. “Well, fine. If you must, have your dastardly way with me.”
He pointedly avoided Tottenham Court Road and the memories it held.
Harry turned bright red and opened his mouth to protest that this was ridiculous, but to his great surprise Padma, Blaise, Lavender, and
“First, I’d like to thank you all for coming,” Jamie said, holding his flute of champagne delicately. “Teddy and I are so honoured that all of you came to celebrate with us today. We love each and every one of you, and you’ve all been so important in our lives.” Jamie looked over at Teddy and winked. “But I’m going to take a leaf out of my Zayde Saul’s book and take this opportunity to kvell a bit about my parents. All four of them!” Jamie smiled at the table where the most important people in his life - besides his new husband, of course - sat. “When I was six, my mum and dad split up,” he continued, “and honestly, it was the best thing that’s ever happened to me.” Teddy let out a surprised bark of laughter, and there was scattered chuckling from the guests. “Because I gained two more parents. I don’t have many memories of my parents being together, but I have more happy memories than I can count of my childhood. Mum, Nev,” Jamie turned to face his mother and step-father. “You two are the most supportive, hilarious, wonderful parents a kid could ask for. Nev, you taught me how to care for a garden and how to apologise to Teddy when I was being an arse. Mum, you taught me how to ride a broom and how to stand up for what I want and what I need in life. You’re the most amazing woman I’ve ever met, and I love you both to the moon.” Ginny wiped away a tear and Neville beamed at his eldest step-son. “And Dad,” Jamie turned slightly to look at his father, who was clutching Draco’s hand and weeping. “Oh, Merlin, Dad! Keep it together!” Harry laughed and mopped at his eyes with a kerchief. Lily got up from her seat and stood behind her dad, leaning down to wrap her freckled arms around his shoulders. “Thanks, Lil! Anyway, Dad, you taught me how to be a good partner and a good friend. You showed me what it means to be strong for your family, and how to make the best pancakes in the world. I love you.” Jamie took a deep breath. “And you, DD.” Jamie smiled at his other step-father. “My Draco-Dad. We got off to a rocky start,” Al and Scorpius burst out laughing. “If by ‘rocky’ you mean ‘terrible,’ then spot on, James!” Scorpius shouted.
Harry turned to look at his husband in horror. “Draco!”
Potter was smiling at him. It was disconcerting to say the least. He suddenly straightened said, “Oh! I’m sorry. This is Saul Weinberg, the owner,” he gestured to the man wearing the half-moon spectacles who was still seated at the table, “and my dear friend. Saul, this is Draco Malfoy.”
I frown, because I can’t actually get them off without taking the garter off, and if I take the garter off the stockings will fall. It’s a lingerie house of cards.
Harry’s eyes grow comically large. “Err, tension? What? We’re not lovers! There’s no steam!” He splutters.
all took large gulps of wine. Harry looked over at Ron, his mouth hanging open.
Harry chuckled. “Quite a pair we’ve got, huh? Al is always finding a way around what I’ve said.” He turned to the two boys. “How about you two and Jamie finish setting the table, and Draco and I will talk about a sleepover?”
Draco opened his mouth to reply but Harry interjected. “I think we’ve gotten off track a bit here. Sex is a very important part of a relationship, and no you don’t have to be married to have it, but you shouldn’t do it with just anyone. You can end up feeling, erm… sad? Regretful? Unfulfilled?”
I groan despite myself. Harry’s casual displays of complicated magic never cease to impress (and arouse) me. Single-item summoning spells like that shouldn’t work—the knickers should tear or pull me with them. But, Harry being Harry, they appear perfectly intact in his large, tanned hands.
“Pervert” Draco admonished, smiling.
“Right. Sure. Let’s go.”
[Bobby opens the door, revealing an almost unrecognizable sitting room. Instead of heavy drapes, mismatched furniture, and a mess of toys on the floor, the room has been redecorated with a warm, yet clearly child-friendly feel. The large bay windows have been expanded to allow more natural light, and are now hung with gauzy white curtains; the walls are painted a subtle gray, and the house’s original decorative moulding and light fixtures have been cleaned and restored. The fireplace is decorated with framed photographs of Harry, Draco, and Teddy, as well as their extended family and friends. All of Teddy’s toys are now in stylish, labeled bins along one wall. A huge sectional sofa in dark blue dominates one side of the room.]
Harry, who had spent the better part of the school year moping about, feeling listless and thinking that he had nothing to look forward to after Hogwarts, felt somewhat ashamed that he’d never considered the fact that other people might be in the same boat. Ron had been talking about the Auror Academy nonstop since Head Auror Robards cornered him and Harry after their Order of Merlin ceremony last June, and Hermione had been accepted to three different Healer Training Programs. Their futures were clearly mapped out, while Harry had been feeling progressively more isolated with every passing day.
“So, will you go to dinner with me?” Harry asked again, pulling Draco into his lap.
“Oh, Merlin.” Harry’s head hit the door with a
, Harry thought, the way that we fit together. They kissed slowly, and Harry took his time exploring Malfoy’s mouth with his tongue, finally sucking Malfoy’s bottom lip lightly between his teeth before pulling back a bit.
“Ok, ok! Anyway! I didn’t allow myself to consider the possibility of you - of us - in reality, until that day you walked into the deli. I had made peace with the fact that I would probably always admire you from afar. But then there you were, looking incredible in that black wool coat and those tailored trousers that should be illegal and speaking French. I was enamored of you immediately. And even though it took us learning how to communicate - Hermione, shut it! - we eventually got there.
Draco smiled down at his son. “Alright, chouchou. Go pick a table.”
Draco placed a three-ring binder on the table in front of him and began to mete out papers with a complicated looking schedule printed on it. Harry glanced down at the binder and was again hit with a wave of love for Draco. His binder had become an ever-present accessory in the past few weeks, as he had begun planning the party the minute that Saul had suggested it as a way to have a “housewarming/formal blending of the families.” Harry also felt that it was important to establish new traditions with Draco and Scorpius in order to ingratiate them into the huge, crazy family that Harry had assembled over the years.
I turn slowly and fold myself over the desk so that my arse is in the air. I glance behind my shoulder and see that Harry is looking at me with something akin to reverence. I wiggle my bum in invitation.
together.”
Draco laughed. “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have set her on you this morning. But I couldn’t face you, and it was either her or my mother. I assumed you’d rather have Astoria at your door than Narcissa Malfoy.”
“Err...yes?” Harry said, looking vaguely confused.
Harry walked. He waded through groups of school children in front of the British Museum and dodged men in suits rushing along the streets outside of Parliament. He walked along the brightly coloured houses of Knotting Hill and carefully sidestepped a puddle of sick outside of a pub in Chelsea.
Jonathan tips Harry’s chin up with his pointer finger so that Harry is looking directly into his eyes. “Life is short. Love is terrifying, but it’s also a mystical, magical rainbow journey full of baby goats wearing onesie pajamas. Do a George Michael and have a little faith, boo boo. You two could have so much happiness together.”
Al and Scorpius cheered while Harry and Draco grinned at each other.
“What do you mean?”
“Dunno, mate.” Ron had remarked at dinner last night. “Tony’s alright, and his handwriting is perfect. He doesn’t mind setting up the Total Station in the morning, and he’s actually pretty funny.”
He found Draco sitting on his leather armchair that faced the lit fireplace. The bedroom had been expanded using wizarding space so that in addition to the large, four poster mahogany bed frame and matching armoire, there was a small fireplace with a sitting area that would otherwise have been impossible to fit in the two storey townhome.
Draco took a deep drink of water. “I’ve so carefully planned out what I’d say to you, if I was ever face to face with you again. This is not what I’d imagined.”
[Tan interview/confession: it’s almost too easy at this point. But I have to say, I’m good.
Harry nods and carefully picks Teddy up from the sofa. He wakes up but allows himself to be carried.
“Oh, erm, I’ve never...done that before. With a bloke,” Harry replied, embarrassed at his lack of experience. “I mean, I’ve done other stuff - loads of other stuff! - just not that.” Draco - if it turned him on to use his first name, then he would now be Draco to Harry - reached up to tweak one of Harry’s nipples, and Harry responded by moaning and grinding his hips into Draco’s again. He could feel the hard length of Draco’s erection against his own through the thin layer of pajama pants, and the friction was intoxicating. “But, I mean, we could try it! We
“I’ve been extremely lucky in my life, finding family and friends to support me.” Harry took a drink of his tea. “And of course there were the years and years of therapy.”
“That’s a very good point, mate,” Harry says, chuckling.
as the idiot who let Death Eaters into the school. I’ll probably pickle my liver with firewhiskey before the age of fifty out of sheer boredom.”
“Wait, are we talking about
“Oh, err… I usually just grab whatever’s at the top of my drawer. So, you know, jeans and a jumper mostly. A tee-shirt in the summer, if it’s warm enough.” Harry responds, looking warily at the scene playing out in front of him.
This whole thing began, as most ill-conceived and/or ridiculous events in my life do, with Pansy Parkinson. A few weeks ago, I attended her “divorce ‘do”—picture a hen party with just as much alcohol but with the added ritual burning of a wedding dress and some minor curses directed towards her now ex husband and his 20-year-old slag of a secretary—and had (apparently) a wonderful time.
Draco moaned above him. “Yes! Yes! You feel so good, Harry. So good!” Harry continued to hold on to Draco's hips, thrusting up with his softening cock on every down movement. All of a sudden Draco stopped moving, his mouth hanging open and his eyes squeezed shut as his own orgasm overcame him. Hot ropes of come sprayed over Harry’s chest, and Draco collapsed over him, seemingly unaware of the mess between them.
“What?! Why?!” Draco shouts.
“Oh no.
I can’t help but smirk, satisfied at my ability to (almost) make him come immediately.
“Oh stop it, Draco.” Harry moves to put his arms around Draco, pulling him into a hug that Draco does not return. “I was just surprised! Of course I want to cohabitate with you, you berk. And I’m going to keep hugging you until you reciprocate, so by all means, take your time. I’m sure the Fab Five have nothing better to do than watch you pout.”
And because Harry was a glutton for punishment - at least where Draco was concerned -  he told him anyway. And as expected Draco poked fun at Harry’s corny sentiments.
“Oh. Well, I suppose you know best, then.” Draco turned his body fully away from Harry and crossed his arms. “Lily,” he continued, “we will of course accompany you to your classroom on Friday evening. It would be my absolute pleasure.”
Draco laughed at that, shaking his head. “I’ve already married one woman I didn’t want to shag, I’m not going through that again.”
I shuddered, remembering the smell of Harry when he’d come crashing in at four thirty in the morning. “You really, really do.”
“Yes! I have an aunt named Pansy but she’s not really my aunt. Papa says that family is who you choose, it doesn’t matter that she’s not blood. He also says that blood is overrated.”
“We usually go to the park on the way home to say hello to the ducks, even though Draco says he doesn’t trust ducks because they’re basically just dinosaurs and they’ve seen too much. But I like the ducks and if we didn’t go see them they might worry about what happened to me so we stop and wave and give them some bread.”
“Sprogs! Table!” Harry called as he carried a plate of snacks and a pot of tea to the table where Lily, Saul, and Draco had already sat down.
So absurd, in fact, that I’m sitting here in his office at the Ministry at half seven on a weeknight, waiting for Harry to return from a crime scene, wrapped in his invisibility cloak lest Weasley stumble in and see something he can’t unsee.
“F-fuck, Draco,” Harry replied, fisting Draco’s hair and pushing himself into Draco’s mouth. Draco relaxed his throat, taking as much of Harry as he could manage without gagging. It had been a long time since he’d done this, but he was confident of his skills.
“Teddy! What’s wrong?” Draco sinks to his knees immediately and starts checking him for injuries.
Harry chuckled and began to undress. His left foot got caught in his denims and he struggled to stay upright, crashing into the bedframe. “Ow! Bugger!” He cursed, righting himself. He looked up to see Malfoy struggling not to laugh at him as he pulled up his own flannel pajama bottoms.
When Harry didn’t move, Malfoy turned back around and hopped back into a push-up position before snaking his upper body down and out so that his chest was pushed up towards the sky. With a smirk back at Potter, he rose onto his toes and back into the V-position that he had started in.
Draco grabbed Harry and pulled him into another kiss. “How do you feel about being a June bride?” he asked between kisses.
“Dad, do you think Teddy will write letters to me especially? Not to you and mum, but just to me?” Jamie asked, running up to Harry’s side and tugging on his sleeve to get his attention.
Everyone laughs, even Draco, but Teddy looks determined. “Promise?”
“If someone doesn’t tell me what the fu… what you meant by ‘you’re engaged’ I will start hexing at will!”
“Good morning, gentlemen!” Tan greets them warmly, sweeping his hands around the shop. “Welcome to the first international location of my favorite store, Bonobos! They have everything you need to get fitted out to be the professional instructor and the cosy dads that you are. Ready?”
“Come through to the sitting room!” A magically-magnified voice calls out.
He perused the handwritten menu, and noted with some amusement that the sandwiches were all uniquely named: there was one called “The Trollied Turkey,” another named “Not Your Nan’s Ruben,” and even the “Feeling Peckish? Pecorino” sandwich. Under the heading “Today’s Specials” was something called “The Roonil Wazlib,” which was apparently a sandwich made up of chicken schnitzel, horseradish sauce, and radicchio on toasted challah. The name tugged at something in Draco’s memory, but he couldn’t put his finger on why he would have any familiarity with something called “Roonil Wazlib.”
“Hellooooo Draco Malfoy! I’m Tan France,” Tan moves to shake his hand. “Your son Teddy nominated you and your partner Harry for a makeover on our television show. We’re part of a team that’s here to give you a total boost!”
Harry chuckles. “You’re right, mate. I know that in this house we always allow each other to finish a conversation because it’s very bad manners otherwise. But when you heard me say that to Draco, that was the first time that I’d ever told him that I loved him.”
[Tan interview/confession:
When he was fully seated he looked down at Harry and smiled wickedly. “Scared, Potter?”
Saul waved a dismissive hand. “My Sophia saved me! She came into the camp with British soldiers to liberate us, posing as a muggle nurse. She found me nearly dead in a bunk, riddled with all manner of disease. She watched over me and nursed me back to health. Fed me matzo ball soup - it was even better than my bubbe’s. The first time I opened my eyes in hospital and saw her, I knew she was my b’shert - my soulmate. My angel.” Saul looked over at Sophia and smiled, taking her hand. “We’ve been together since 1945, if you can believe that!”
“Mmmhmm,” Jonathan says. “So you and The Chosen One are …”
“Oh, bugger!” Harry cursed, starting at Ginny’s voice. “Jamie! Al! Lily! Your mum’s here!” he yelled, pointing his wand at his throat to make his voice heard up the stairs. “In here, Gin!”
Jonathan cuts him off. “Just think about it, sweetie.” He squeezes Draco’s shoulder. “Now, back to the Singing Sorceress herself!”
Harry blushes a bit and removes his fingers from where they are toying with the ends of Draco’s hair. “I admit nothing, Malfoy.”
“That’s not going to happen. I love you, completely and totally. You’re my missing piece, and there’s no other shoe that’s ever going to drop.”
“Task completed. Am I done now?” Malfoy whinged at Harry, stepping back and crossing his arms over his chest.
“And at night, you can watch the stars,” Bobby explains. “No matter the weather, you’ll always be able to see them clearly. And you can ask your dads to move the view around, so you can see the Draco constellation and Leo, and even Andromeda and Sirius and any other of your star-named family members.”
“Your mum is having a baby?” Harry said unnecessarily loudly, causing Draco to wince.
“Are you fucking kidding me?” Malfoy suddenly looked rather angry. “You’ve wanted to kiss me for the past two years, and you’re only now doing something about it? You fucking coward! You took down the Dark Lord and you couldn’t admit to wanting to snog me? We could’ve been shagging this entire year!” Malfoy closed the gap between the two of them and unceremoniously pressed his lips to Harry’s.
“I suppose,” Draco said, pressing his face into Harry’s neck to hide his beaming smile.
“Want me to put these on for you?” I asked, holding them up in front of my pelvis, trying to gauge if they’d fit. They were a black, delicate lace, and were clearly made for men as they had more fabric at the front to accommodate a cock.
Jonathan laughs. “It’s hard to remember that you don’t have much contact with the no-maj world! Is that by choice or by necessity?”
“That sounds like a great plan!” Harry picks up a bowl of bright yellow powder and sniffs. “Is sambar spicy?”
“You’re just saying that because I let you fuck my mouth,” Draco said, smiling and looking around for his wand.
“Draco, love of my life, fire of my loins, if you don’t get out of the bathroom in the next ten seconds I will blast open this door!” Harry was waiting for his turn in the shower, standing starkers in their chilly bedroom save for a towel wrapped around his waist. It was useless to try and shower if Draco was in the bathroom and they actually had something they needed to get to, as their being naked in front of each other was a recipe for being late.
Draco gave her a weak smile. He tried to sit up a bit straighter, but immediately felt dizzy again. He gave into slumping against the wall. “What I mean to imply is that, well, I know I have a lot to say. A lot to … apologise for. I wrote you so many letters. All of you … Weasley. Potter,” his voice cracked at the mention of the name, but he continued on. “I never sent any of them. It felt wrong to try and convey my feelings through an owl instead of in person. And yet, I haven’t reached out to you in these past two years.”
Draco scoots closer to Teddy and Harry and wraps his arms around them both, squeezing.
I rise up slowly until he almost slips out of me before slamming myself back down again. I repeat that move a few more times, relishing in the groans I’m eliciting from Harry. I’m done teasing, though; my own cock is throbbing and I shift my angle around, trying to find the spot that will make me see stars.
And I wouldn’t have it any other way.
“I... I suppose I should be going, then.” Harry pushed his chair back, wincing at the squealing of the metal chair legs against the tiles. “I don’t actually have a clue where I am, though. I went on a walk without really planning on it...”
Harry clutches at my hips and runs his fingers along the garter belt and straps, holding my arse open for him. He throws his head back and swears when I’m flush against him. “Fuck. Don’t move for a second, OK?”
“So, what? Salazar help you if you’re about to insult my private choices.”
“Oh, Harry. It’s cute that you even have to ask.” Draco climbed off the bed and pulled his pants on. “Are you coming?” Draco looked behind him, quirking his eyebrow.
(He won’t.)
Potter walked down the short hallway and turned left at the foot of the stairs, taking them into a bright, airy kitchen. To their right was a large sitting room with several cosy-looking couches. Every available space was covered with photos: some were magical, but most were clearly muggle. Draco stepped forward and saw scenes of smiling Potter children at various ages; a man Draco recognised as Saul and a woman he imaged was his late wife Sophia were featured in many of them, looking lovingly at each other while visiting famous landmarks around the world.
“Don’t I know it. He’s a wizard with getting people to open up about their emotions and engage in some personal growth. In addition to being a literal wizard, obvs. Ha!” Jonathan beams at Harry’s reflection in the mirror. He starts snipping here and there, measuring strands with his deft fingers. “I think I’ve been a very polite, good little Jonathan so far, but it’s time to put on the kettle and spill the tea. We are in England, after all! What is the deal with you and Draco? Are you lovers in the night or what? The tension between you two is so thick and steamy I would have to put on my wellies and a raincoat to wade through it!”
“Lily, why don’t we go find something more suitable for you to wear to dinner? I bet you’ve got loads of beautiful dresses,” Draco said, kneeling down to speak to her.
“You are such a bloody drama queen.” Hermione raised her hand, palm up. “I solemnly swear that I will not tell a soul that you two are engaged.”
[Teddy confessional/interview: I love to cook with my dads! I’m not allowed to use the big knives yet but usually Draco helps me chop while Harry tells us what to do. Mostly I just like being all together, even when Kreacher grumbles about being allowed to do his duty to the Noble House of Black.]
“I promise that I will endeavour to remind you much more often how much I adore you,” Draco says, pressing a kiss to Teddy’s head.
“It’s not so different than what would have happened to all the Muggle Born witches and wizards, Harry, if you hadn’t defeated You-Know-Who,” said Sophia. “From what the Prophet was reporting, there were already registries and laws against us Muggle Borns. Same thing with the Jews, the gypsies, the homosexuals, the dissenters! It happened in Germany, it happened here! Oy vey izmir, what a mess we humans make of the world.”
“You’re right I’ve been so lucky to get to spend the previous fifteen birthdays alone, locked in my cupboard or up in my room. If I was lucky, I’d at least get ignored and not have to get screamed at for something stupid.” Harry spoke without malice, only minor sarcasm. Yet, when he met Malfoy’s eyes again, they were filled with something Harry couldn’t place.
It was also in these moments that Harry often dwelled on his two best friends and how he wasn’t exactly being completely honest with them in their correspondence of letters. Not that Ron minded much, he didn’t really ask about Malfoy, or even write too often. But of course, Hermione was insistent and often concerned about him, and how the bond was affecting him, or whether or not he and Malfoy were getting along. Harry regularly dodged these questions or supplied the bare minimum of information; just enough to keep Hermione off his back.
As Malfoy got closer, the dull ache began to dissipate, leaving the rest of his body and settling down in his stomach alone, giving him some relief. Harry found himself almost longing for Malfoy to hurry up and get closer to be rid of it altogether. Malfoy seemed to have the same idea as his steps got a little larger and instead of going over and getting into his own bed, he strode right over to Harry’s bed standing next to him, turning back to face the two adults who were following close behind.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco idly watched as first year’s struggled between the unfamiliarity of leaving their families behind and the awe that seemed to encompass them as they feasted their eyes on the Hogwarts Express for the first time. He watched house friends reunite and felt sudden dread lurch over him at the thought of seeing anyone from his own Slytherin House, but felt it’s looming imminence, nonetheless.
He’d been missing Harry all evening, he did his absolute best to keep up with Mrs. Weasley, and he could tell he already liked her very much. How could anyone not instantly love her? However, in those moments where she tended to get lost in her own rambling, Draco was left to wonder what Harry was up to. He so desperately wanted to bury himself in the warmth of Harry’s neck, breath him in, and stay forever.
“Fuck, you’re amazing Potter. If this is what looking after you entails, I’ll do it for the rest of eternity.”
Harry awoke the next morning with a dull ache that seemed to take root in his gut and reverberate through the rest of his body. It wasn’t at all like the pain he had experienced in the dungeons during class, but it was definitely unpleasant. Harry slowly sat up and ran his hands over his face and through his hair before reaching around for his glasses, finding them on the small table beside his bed. After placing them back in the normal space on his face he noticed that Malfoy’s bed was empty; ‘that explains the pain’ he thought to himself.
“What about your family, what happens after the summer…I still meant what I said yesterday Draco, I want you beside me.”
Draco felt that returning to Hogwarts was really the only way for him to begin to move forward properly. With his father in Azkaban and his mother on house arrest, he needed to get out and away from all the things that reminded him of the horrible things he endured the last year and of all the reasons why he shouldn’t carry on.  He needed reasons to carry on, he wanted to give his mother someone to believe in and be proud of, and he wanted to be that for himself as well. He had put his faith in the wrong people from the beginning and been indoctrinated to look at life a certain way. The last year had been full of painful lessons that left memories he didn’t think would ever fade, and he was determined to make them mean something. In the past Draco would have been loud, he would have wanted to make it known he was there, always the one with the upper hand, always the one with something to say even when it was wrong. This is why when he boarded the Hogwarts express to embark on his eighth and final year of school, he decided to stay silent.
“We don’t have much time before someone comes to find one or both of us,” Harry whispered out. “And I desperately want to see you come.”
“You don’t have to get me anything, this is still one of the best birthday’s I’ve ever had, trust me,” Harry spoke sincerely eyes searching Draco’s.
Harry’s mind was reeling. He was in love with Draco Malfoy, Draco Malfoy was in love with him. He stared at the blonde in front of him, and after a moment of gazing pulled him close, tucked him into his chest, and kissed his head. After a moment, he felt the other boy nuzzle in closer and wrap his arm around Harry’s chest and stretch up to place a kiss to his shoulder.
Of course, Harry’d buggered up his mind all summer creating a blinding, murky haze whenever he’d been bothered to think about going back to school. It had always felt like they’d still had so much time, like summer would last forever. He’d been stupid, of course he knew the summer would end he’d just been too keen to let Harry sodding Potter distract him with his green eyes, bronze skin, lips, lips, lips, lips…
Harry turned to look back at their room one last time, just in time to watch as Draco stood at the open door, gazing in at the small shared space. It was almost as if he could hear the blonde’s thoughts, ‘it hadn’t been much, but it had felt like so much more.’ It felt true for both of them, and Harry couldn’t help but smile as Draco turned to face him with sad eyes, turned soft, once they locked with Harry’s.
