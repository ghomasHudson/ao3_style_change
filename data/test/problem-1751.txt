Harry’s eyes sparkled appealingly, for a moment. “Alright, Draco, next time I receive anonymous chocolates by post I will give them to you and Neville.”
,” Harry said, still looking guilty. A number of items in his office trembled for a moment. “Whoops. I think I’m still having a little trouble focussing.” He looked at his wand, cast aside on his desk, as if it was the reason Harry’s magic was all over the place. It didn’t respond, but if any wand had ever looked haughty, Harry’s wand did at that moment. In fact, it looked downright miffed.
“No, no,” Harry replied, setting the spoon aside and opening the oven to remove a loaf of bread. “I’d forgotten how much I love cooking. The kitchen at Number Twelve was brilliant, you know. And I…”
century. No one cares. But he’s never talked about it, you know?” Ron had wondered, though. Harry spent most of his holidays with Charlie, and…
When Harry stepped out of the Floo, Draco was dusting the ash from his pale Healer robes. The lights around the sitting room had begun to glow as soon as he passed through the wards, and the house was as beautiful as he remembered it to be.
At the foot of the staircase, Harry and Draco said their goodnights. But just before he headed for the stairs down to the dungeons, Draco paused.
“So is this,” Draco replied, raising the book before his hand lowered again, in stages, like he wasn’t sure what to do with it.
. I remember this being a lot easier when I was seventeen,” she grumbled, as she settled her arms around her belly. “I didn’t want to say in front of everyone, Harry. But the house looks lovely.”
“No, I’m sorry. Please, Harry — that wasn’t what I wanted to talk about.” She sat up straighter. Harry looked tense, and ready to run. “I — Draco.”
“I hope Aunt Bella heard you say that from the afterlife,” Draco replied, finally getting his breath back, and casting a quick cleaning charm on his shirt.
The guilelessness of the very young was charming, always, but Harry’s heart clenched tight at the memory of Hedwig, falling lifelessly, and —… he closed his eyes.
my magic back. I came here — Merlin’s bollocks, why am I doing this? — I came because. Because you were here. Because there hasn’t been a day since I was eleven years old when I haven’t thought about you. Because I wanted you to be my friend even when we hated each other. Because I saw the way you looked at me that night in the club, when I’d said goodbye to magic forever, and I —“
The moon was out and bright, the gentle cloud cover distributing the light. It was a frightening place nonetheless. The graves were overgrown, the statues damaged and inhuman looking. Draco refused to look at a statue of an angel with its nose broken off, for fear it would turn into the ghost of Lord—
The day after the last of the term was outrageously busy. Hundreds of students to send through the Floo network or to send home on the Hogwarts Express. A handful were collected outside the gates by parents who used side-along apparition or had organised a Portkey.
Draco swallowed. His voice came out weak and cracked. “I’m sure he knows. And I feel quite sure that he is very sorry as well.”
Harry was fit to burst; no one invited anyone into his room without his say-so. And yet, as four people, two witches and two wizards, poured into his classroom and stood blinking in horror and intrigue at his room, he realised there was no point in arguing.
Draco’s hands were folded together in his lap. He looked down at them, and realised how tightly they were tangled together. They ached. He released them, and smoothed down his pale grey robes.
It was shortly after nine when Harry heard a knock on the door of his classroom and stepped out of his room to cross the cobbled floor and open the door to Draco.
Draco nodded. “I’d like to arrange for some work to be done there. I want it clean, repainted, and fit to live in by the time I wake Harry up.”
Everyone helped, in their way. Molly cooked too much food and baked a great deal of bread. It was only days later than Arthur Weasley told Hermione very quietly that Molly had been the one to end Bellatrix’s life. The two women had left, mysteriously, that afternoon, and returned with red eyes and some kind of new and profound understanding. The nightmares, though. They stayed.
His family arrived, and they transfigured his bed into a stone coffin to be placed in the Ollivander crypt. They sat around it, sharing stories, laughing, crying sometimes, and they never asked Harry to leave; they welcomed Ron and Hermione, as well, who sat on either side of Harry and comforted him, though he wasn’t sure he needed it.
Draco frowned, and then narrowed his eyes, and laughed, and frowned again, and Harry seemed to shrink away, his expression wary but resigned.
It was the week after the new school term started that Harry arrived at Ollivander’s one morning and knew that there was something wrong. He called out, once, twice, three times, and there was no reply, not even a shifting in the air upstairs. Harry climbed the stairs slowly, with pain in his stomach, already quite certain of what he was going to find. Ollivander had seemed so at peace, the last few weeks. He hadn’t worked at all. He’d drunk cups of tea, eaten nothing but cake and biscuits, and sat on his little stone bench in the courtyard behind the store, eyes closed, soaking up the air and sun and wind.
There was something else, though, too. And since Draco couldn’t figure out what that might be, he decided that the best course of action was to show up unannounced in Harry’s room to make a pest of himself and pretend to mark homework.
It hadn’t really crossed his mind before but the moment the statement slipped from between Harry’s lips he knew that it was true.
The finality in his voice was unmistakable, and the two of them stood, Headmaster McGonagall brushing a finger over Malfoy’s arm and Madam Pomfrey checking his temperature once more. Harry brought a chair up to Malfoy’s bedside, reached for a book, and settled in to wait.
Harry sold twenty-two children their first wands, that day, and felt a warm glow every time their eyes lit up when they found the right one. Nine of them bought wands Harry had made himself, not that they knew it, and Harry floated home in the evening on a cloud of satisfaction.
at the pan, and while it ruined the pancakes, the amount of smoke billowing in the air reduced significantly.
“Wait,” she said, hurriedly rushing for her desk. She pulled out a small leather satchel. “I made you this. You said you wanted to take some things from the house. And maybe from his office. I’m rather good with Undetectable Extension Charms. This will make it easier to get everything back.”
Hermione frowned as if it was only now dawning on her that it might not be an especially restful way to spend a holiday.
The Hogwarts Express was pulling away from the station, and Draco had reached his absolute limit. Harry could feel it. Andromeda, too. Draco’s lip quivered a moment and he dissolved into tears.
“In some ways, Draco, you haven’t changed a bit,” she said, shaking her head. “I’ll tell Blaise you said hello.”
Late in the evening, Luna looked up as if startled; at what, Harry didn’t know. The stars, the trees, one of her, er, more imaginary creatures, perhaps. “Oh,” she said. “It’s that time.”
“Well, it’s gone,” Blaise said. He took two impossibly fluid steps and settled himself behind Hermione, one arm around her chest and the other, her hips.
Madam Shacklebolt’s face was serene and kind, and absolutely serious. And Harry wanted to paste a smile on his face, lie through his teeth, and say that every day was a fucking joy and a privilege — but she was, after all, the head of the Auror Office and rather well primed with a bullshit detector that was famous across all of Europe.
“Oh, you mean when I said I was going to make you my husband? Yes. I meant it. I don’t know what the future holds here except that we’ll be together in it.” He reached across the bed to tuck a strand of Draco’s hair behind his ear. It was so soft.
“Please don’t go,” Draco murmured. “After all of this — I keep imagining what it might be like if you wake up. If you wake up with me. What it might be like. Fuck, Harry, you complete tosser. I know you don’t like having anything nice for yourself but perhaps you could see this as a gift to me. Not a gift. Something I need like Neville Longbottom needs plants. Don’t forget. Please, don’t forget, what it was like. What we were like. What we
“You could be a part of this life,” Harry murmured, and when Draco choked, leaning in, Harry wrapped him in his arms and pulled him close. He kissed Draco’s shoulder, his neck, his jaw, and when Draco let out an almost mournful cry and leaned for Harry’s lips, Harry kissed him properly.
Asleep, Malfoy was even prettier to look at than he was when he was awake. His hair had darkened a little as he’d gotten older, and now it was a dirtier blond, long enough around his shoulders to pull back into a knot when he was so moved, and when free it curled gently around his face. His eyes were still the colour of an unquiet sea but they didn’t have the same anger in them, and that suited him very well.
“Not with my mother and two dozen guests downstairs. Have you no decorum?” But Draco was smiling, teasing, and Harry looked exasperated and fond, and when Draco cupped Harry’s jaw
Suddenly it seemed like such a crappy present, but when Harry managed to meet Draco’s eyes, he didn’t look like he thought it was a crappy present. He looked… intrigued. Even awed.
Molly gave him a firm hug. It took Harry back to the very first time she’d done it. The first time he’d learned what a really motherly hug was like. “Thank you. For everything. Including that. And so’s you know, I decided that this year my resolution would be to see if I can find myself a nice bloke to settle down with. And before you ask — yes, that includes letting you set me up with your friend’s brother’s nephew, or what have you, alright?”
She flushed. It had taken years of living outside the Muggle world to really understand that there was no kind of stigma. And still, she found herself assuming that everyone was straight until proved otherwise.
“I’m looking forward to it,” Harry said. His newest wand was finished. He made a notation on the end of a long box (19” WN DH), laid out a soft piece of cloth, and nestled the wand gently into place. “I know no child ever forgets the first time they wave a wand. I want to learn everything I can.”
“I,” Harry said, his mouth and throat dry. “It was kind of your mother to… I just.” He looked down and tried to follow Draco’s feet. “I learned to lead.”
“Three house-elves and suddenly he’s all bossy,” Draco complained, reaching for a pinch of Floo powder.
“Just for a few weeks. But I don’t think he’s ever forgiven himself for that. I don’t even know if I have ever forgiven him, quite. But Harry wasn’t even angry. All he remembers is that Ron came back.”
Draco snorted limoncello out of his nose. It burned like acid, and his eyes watered. “Blaise, please.” He wiped his face with a napkin. “Perhaps you’re happy slumming it with Gryffindors—”
It was probably almost twenty years overdue, really, and the almost hilarious thought struck her that Draco really had to be a very good psychiatrist. She was not, however, expecting to hear his chair move closer, or expecting him to slip his arms around her body so that she could cry into his shoulder.
Hermione had won, of course, and she, Ron and Harry all returned to Hogwarts in the autumn to finish their NEWTs. Eighth year students from all houses shared a common room, and a strange collection of bedrooms (singles, doubles, a dormitory; strangely well arranged, actually, and it turned out that everybody’s preference fit precisely within the odd collection). There were fewer students than Harry had thought there might be, and only two Slytherins. They kept themselves to themselves for the first two weeks but after a relentless campaign of inclusion by Hermione they had conceded defeat by the end of the third.
“Good,” she said. “That’s good, Harry. I know it won’t be easy for you. But I think Draco was right, you know.”
“Thank you, Rubino. And you, Draco,” she said, and followed the swaggering elf toward the guest rooms on the upper floor.
“Er.” Harry wasn’t sure he could call her by her name, but he vowed to try, as uncomfortable as he was. “Is there something I can help you with, Mrs — Narcissa?”
Draco followed him up the stairs to the guest room, and though Harry didn’t want to ask if he was anticipating Harry falling, he couldn’t shake the feeling that Draco was bracing himself to catch him if he did. He wondered if that was what it would take for Draco to put his hands on him. He wondered if that was what he wanted.
“My feelings have nothing to do with it. Now, can we please change the subject to something far more pleasant? With what charity are you salving your conscience this week? Or we could return to an old favourite, and you could remind me about my appalling behaviour in my early twenties.”
“Yes,” Draco replied. “Just one thing more. And then you can wake up. You don’t need this place. You don’t ned to pretend. You’re so fucking strong. You know you are.”
“We’re not children anymore, Potter. But I shall dream up some stingers for when you’ve slept more than six hours in a week. I hope you didn’t lose your edge in the DMLE. Do you still spend a lot of time with Weasley? Because if your comeback for everything is ‘well so’s your mum’ I shall be very disappointed. As will Mother.”
Draco had already seen the thin mattress than had been shrunk down to the size of a novel and placed on a shelf. He wondered who had done that. Maybe they didn’t like the idea of anyone knowing that this was where he’d gone to sleep, on his day off, and never returned.
Potter actually smiled at that. Snickered, even. Relaxed, crossing his arms on the bench and meeting Draco’s eyes with something that might have been guarded optimism. He was still watching Draco work; trust wasn’t something that came easily to either of them, but it was still somewhat disheartening. He’d been looking forward to the possibility of… well, not a friend, but someone to talk to who was under the age of seventy and not obsessed with plants. Not that Neville was a bad sort, and he had won puberty roulette with flying colours which made him awfully nice to look at, but he was hardly a challenge.
He intended to call out, but his voice seemed to drop just an inch from his lips, and the name disappeared into the night. Draco was trembling, his head aching. How he had envied Harry. How they had all resented him. He saw Ron’s betrayed expression in his brand new memory and wanted to slap it from his stupid face, before he remembered that he’d been so much fucking worse, so full of resentment that he’d spent hours making those stupid pins that read ‘Potter Stinks’.
He was dressed and ready for the dinner before Hermione arrived, in a rush, already tossing her shoes aside and asking about what colours Harry thought were appropriate. Harry was calm, though. Calmer than he thought he’d been in a very long while. He lowered himself onto the couch, and after a moment’s hesitation, swung his legs over it, stretching out, relaxing. He didn’t care if the robes got creased. He really didn’t. He grinned at the thought, actually.
His finger slipped inside before Draco’s impatient nod was even finished. To the first knuckle, and then the second, laughing as Draco’s hips rolled again, struggling between pulling away from the intrusion and fucking himself down onto Harry’s fingers. Two fingers, then, and he took Draco’s cock back into his mouth while he scissored them, stretching, but not wanting to stretch too far.
“I’m sure all of those Italian families will be happy knowing their little ones aren’t all the way in France,” Luna said. “Just as I’m very happy for you and Draco, Harry. He’s very pretty, and these days his aura is much less prickly. Not prickly at all, really. I don’t think he could have helped people that way.”
Harry snorted, and it hurt, so he elected not to do it again. Hermione returned from the downstairs bathroom with a wet facecloth. “Clean yourself up,” she said, not unkindly. “You’ve got blood all over your face. Now, what happened?”
“Since it doesn’t look like you’re planning to AK me for trying to hand your skinny arse over to the Dark — Vol —“ Pansy flushed. “You might as well call me Pansy,” she said.
Harry’s throat ached. “I didn’t want to change it,” he admitted. “For a long time, because Sirius —”
know. His eyes were open, darting from Draco’s eyes to his mouth as they broke the kiss again, clutching at his hip, his other hand slipping from Draco’s forearm to his upper arm, to his shoulder, to his neck, into his hair, bringing Draco closer and making him groan with need.
When he finally did, his last thought was that if Draco Malfoy had indeed changed, Harry would have liked the chance to get to know him. But it was too late. Malfoy was gone, and Harry sincerely doubted that he would ever see him again.
He had happened upon his collection of feathers the week before, and that first wand with Kneazle whisker. He had begun to make notes about the attributes of various cores and possible cores and had begun planning a research study. He was considering getting permission from the Ministry to requisition certain materials that were otherwise difficult to get hold of. His mind had run away with him, over the last several days. Understanding what he did now about how a wand did nothing but focus power — and that there was some sympathetic vibration between the wand and the bearer — he was now wondering if there might be wands that would be fit for specific purposes, like healing. Healers might use one wand at home and another at work, for example. And so much more. What if the right wand could grant limited magic even to a Squib? Or someone who had lost their magic due to illness?
, anything at all. Harry could feel it. He felt the dragon herself. She had been old, strong, fiercely protective over generations before she’d died in a dark, cool valley surrounded by her daughters and granddaughters and great-granddaughters. It had been Charlie Weasley who had sent Harry the heartstrings. There had been tears blurring words on the parchment. Charlie protected and helped the dragons and they in turn let him harvest the parts of themselves that were useful to Wizardkind, before the family burned the remains.
Malfoy looked rather like he’d prefer not to have the conversation again, and only grunted. Harry wondered if he agreed at all, or if he’d learned to ignore Neville. He served himself some lunch, and had only just begun to lean over it possessively when Malfoy gave him a pointed look.
Oh, how Harry wished he understood why Mrs Malfoy used his first name, why she was so friendly. It ruined all of his assumptions. He lay in his comfortable bed at night, looking around at the homey furnishings, and wondered why she would have bothered with such a thing. Even worse, why Draco might have asked her to. He loved it,
“Giant prat,” Draco said, satisfied. “Fine, I’ll marry you. But not until you’ve grovelled adequately over the whole stalking me across Europe thing.”
The tip of Draco’s tongue slipped out to wet his lips, and Harry was mesmerised. He could — and then he’d… and he’d never kissed anyone before that he’d
He was almost back and Hermione’s house when he found himself in front of a Tesco. Abruptly, he realised that he hadn’t cooked in a very long time; in fact he rarely bothered to make himself anything more complicated than a sandwich. He stood gawking at the produce for about ten minutes. And then, in a flurry of inspiration, he bought the ingredients for a risotto dish that he knew Hermione and Ron had both loved, back in the days when he often cooked at Number Twelve Grimmauld Place, when they were trying to find their feet again as friends.
“Thought that was you,” came a familiar and jovial voice. Harry smiled at the figure coming up the street. “I’ve just come from the Leaky.”
Draco met Harry’s eyes in the mirror. They were sparkling, and so were Harry’s. “You did, you beast. While I was all fucked-out and floating on a sea of hormones. No, I promise you, I’m here of my own free will. ’Til death do us part, and all the rest of it.” He was supremely satisfied to see Harry’s expression darken hungrily for a moment.
He didn’t anticipate a visit before lunch, but he couldn’t pretend he didn’t feel a little thrill of something when Malfoy stuck his head in the door.
When the cats lost interest in him, Harry walked on. He found a sunny park, and sat on an ancient bench carved with hearts and letters, and let the sun warm his face.
“As long as you don’t piss in my shoes, I think I’ll survive.” Harry crossed his arms under his head, and sighed. Draco was so close that Harry could smell his skin, the lingering fragrance of whatever cologne he’d put on that morning. The gaslights on the walls made the shadows flicker, golden and lovely, sharpening Draco’s cheekbones until Harry imagined that if he was to reach up and touch one he could cut himself.
Ron and Harry had to agree. They knew what she was doing. Trying to bury herself in work so that grief couldn’t overwhelm her.
He could have reminded Potter again that he was rubbish at potions but twice in five minutes felt a little fourth-year, if he was honest. Plain old-fashioned ignoring seemed like a better option.
“I feel that I’ve given enough,” he said, at last, with a smile. It was a good smile. Not his bright ‘camera in my face, better look presentable’ smile, not his ’Teddy’s hair is the most wonderful shade of teal right now’ smile. It was a sure, adult smile. And it brooked no argument, despite the way that Robards’ face was going slowly purple.
He managed, this time, to make his way across the grounds and exit through the gate. The cool air was so jarring, and so pleasant, so crisp and real — like a cold apple in the middle of the spring — that Harry walked for almost two hours before he apparated back to the castle.
It was almost a relief when Ron and Gabrielle took the children home. As much as Hermione loved them, she could see the toll that it was taking on Harry to have to be so alert and responsive to the girls; she knew he wasn’t sleeping well, but that wasn’t the same as being worn out while he was awake, and rest at least was necessary. He curled up in the corner of Hermione’s couch when they were gone, cup of herbal tea in his hand and his eyes fixed on the flames in the fireplace (the fire wasn’t really necessary, the summer almost on them; but the house could get cold, and Hermione knew how much Harry loved the flickering of the flames, and the scent of wood smoke).
When they stepped out of the Floo at Twelve Grimmauld Place, Hermione’s mouth dropped open in horror.
“Kingsley and I had a cousin,” she said, kicking off her shoes and leaning back in her chair. “Guin. She worked at St Mungo’s. She was a good nurse. But as the years went by, she seemed to hollow out. Do you understand what I mean? Do you have any Firewhiskey?”
. Draco crumpled the note into a ball, and moved to toss it into the fire, awful illegible scratchy handwriting and all. And then he smoothed it out, cast a quick ironic charm over it, folded it, and slipped it into a drawer in his private potions lab.
This was partially true. But mostly a load of horse shite. Few knew better than Draco how important it was to take proper rest, to recover and recharge. But somewhere between his brain and his tongue, his essential self had seen the opportunity to make an excuse for the rest he really needed.
“I don’t think I really want to be, though. I think I just want to sleep. I don’t think it’s so bad, sleeping. Sirius said it, you know. He said it was faster than falling asleep.” Harry closed his eyes. “Thank you, though. I think I’ll sleep better than I would have before. But I really do think I’m done.”
to turn out all of the lights. And he made his way up the stairs to his bedroom. He thought he’d read for a little while and then go to sleep.
one was actually focused on his uni studies and genuinely as big a nerd as his glasses advertised, which was quite appealing.
to. He dropped the potion onto Harry’s tongue, and then his own. He stretched out on the bed, and slipped his fingers, vibrant and wanting, into Harry’s fingers, cool and slack. And then he closed his eyes.
The morning was fucking horrible, too, and Hermione was missing Blaise like an internal organ. She felt sick at the thought of summoning Kreacher, so Parvati led her down into the bowels of the ministry, to the kitchen, where he was resentfully rolling out pastry and muttering about his Master.
“So far, you git, but am I going to get a blowjob this morning, or do I have to make you breakfast first?”
Harry tensed. “We don’t all require large rooms and fancy carpet, Malfoy. We didn’t all grow up in mansions. You and I don’t share tastes, and that’s fine.”
“Not at all.” But he drank, and he seemed impressed. “Lovely. And you were mostly right, you know. Well, you do know. It’s a disaster. And I’ve supervised Healers who fell in love with every patient they were ever attracted to — and Topher, it happens, there is no point in denying it — but I’m curious because it’s not something I’ve ever heard you so much as hint at. You have a satisfying sex life, am I right?”
“I’ve never seen a man so direly in need of a drink,” Blaise said, shaking his hand. It as almost strange to see him in Muggle jeans and a t-shirt with a sweater over the top; but probably, having to spend all day every day at work in those robes and with a hood he needed to feel as distant from that as possible.
After supper on Friday night Draco met his mother for a drink in Hogsmeade. The weather was getting colder by the day. It would be a bitter winter. He kissed Narcissa’s cheek and pulled her chair out for her. They ordered mulled wine; it was very fine, flavoured with cinnamon and apples, cloves and cardamom. A little port to warm the blood, while the steaming glasses warmed the fingers.
They were silent a while, the fire seeming to hypnotise Potter, and Potter having a somewhat similar effect on Draco.
“There’s only one way to make me stop,” Draco snarled. “Fucking… Gryffindor idiot. You’re so fucking brave — show me. Show me how brave you are. One more time, Harry, and then you can stop, and you never have to be brave again.”
just to get a break from his loud, frequent overanalysis. Maybe he should talk to Pansy. He could spend another afternoon in Dublin on Saturday, he thought.
“Oh,” Harry said, and though his tone sounded pleased, his expression was guarded and cautious. “Well.”
“We’ve done rather a lot of talking already,” Harry said, tossing his own robe over a chair. He could almost feel Draco itching to hang it instead but he didn’t. “Do you really want to talk more? We have all the time in the world,” he promised, but Draco was already slipping his shoes off. His pupils were wide and dark and his face was beginning to take on a little bit of pink. “But if you do want to talk… I have a question of my own. An important one.”
Harry’s stomach twisted uncomfortably. “How could I be? I’m busy. I have you two, and Teddy — and I’m not a hermit,” he added pointedly. “I see my friends. Neville, and even your incorrigible friend Blaise… did you know Pansy and I have coffee together at least twice a week? I’m not lonely, Hermione.”
“I had no idea,” Harry said. “I’m sorry they weren’t interested in — I mean, of course, everyone needs to follow their own hearts, but…”
“Alright, Harry. Four drops. I’ve set an alarm so I can’t get lost, but I’d appreciate you not pushing me out, this time, if you can help it, alright?”
“At least once more, Mrs Malfoy,” Harry said, unconsciously trying to press his hair into submission.
Harry was regularly invited to Ministry events of all kinds. He felt an obligation to accept them, until the night that Hermione let loose on him and accused him of treating himself the way others had treated him; like a pawn, a really shiny and expensive pawn who’d never been able to make his own choices, and who had no more obligation to the Ministry than any other Hogwarts student did. She’d yelled, he’d yelled, Ron had threatened to summon Molly Weasley, and then they’d all ended up on the couch together, laughing, crying, their fellow students silently brewing tea and bribing the house-elves for another round of dessert.
“You’re a superb Healer, Draco,” he said, forcing himself to meet Draco’s eyes. “I think… I think I would have died.”
The following day, Hermione told Auror Robards that Harry had returned to England. It was an idiotic thing to do; within ten minutes, the man was barking orders left and right to arrange a formal dinner at the Ministry to welcome Harry home. By the time Hermione was back at the house, spitting venom left and right and trying to explain to Harry what had happened, he had that faraway look in his eyes again. As if he was ready to curl up into a ball and go back to sleep. He didn’t want to visit the house, anymore; he closed the door to the bedroom he had been sleeping in for almost a month now and Hermione could do nothing but fret and pace and fume.
“Do you know,” Hermione said, running a finger around the rim of her glass, making it sing. “There are days when I think I’m healthy.”
It was a sense of the dragon that told Harry what sort of a wand he was making. Long and inflexible, sanded until it felt almost like metal in his fingers. A square base of only about a centimetre, and tiny flames that Harry carved around the lower shaft over several hours. It reminded him a little of Sirius’s wand.
Which was why, with Harry downstairs making breakfast without sausages or anything else that might be found in the larder, he stepped through the wall.
“I’m going to be a much better Auror than Harry Potter would ever have been,” he told his girlfriend. “How d’you like that? I’ll be Head Auror one day, see if I won’t.”
The Chosen One. And he’d never had the chance to choose, not really. And never, never for himself. Plunging into the dark water and trying to remember that he was breathing through gills, and not drowning. Dodging Grindylows and worse as he swam — and he wasn’t very good at that, either, the buoyancy of his limbs fighting him every step of the way —
“I don’t know what’s come over you either,” she said, laughing as he twirled her around. “But I like it. Let me owl our guests some invitations, and I’ll bring some bottles of wine up from the cellar.”
She couldn’t take her eyes off the two of them, the kitten working very hard to chew off Crookshanks’ tail and failing utterly, but she dutifully tasted Harry’s stew. It was unbelievably tasty, and her moan was probably more than enough to tell him that it didn’t need anything extra.
“Now, pay attention,” Harry said, to the twenty or so students collected in the room. He wondered if the group would shrink or grow over time. “There are rules to duelling. You are not here to defend yourselves against the forces of evil. We are not at war.”
And he could feel it — the way Harry wanted that too. The pull of his magic, the way his skin sang. The frustrated little murmur when he chased the kiss a second time and found Malfoy had stepped away. The set of his jaw, the quickening of his breath. But he didn’t step closer. He didn’t reach out, or smile, or tease. He looked, in fact… quite miserable.
of that.” Harry laughed, but the laugh was hollow and humourless. And then, nothing. Harry stood leaning against the beautiful old chest of drawers and Draco’s expression hardened into a mask of professionalism.
He even found himself getting terribly drunk with Professor Saltzman, the History teacher, one night. His misery seemed to amuse the man.
Harry laughed, and took Draco deep, thrilling to the way he had to hold Draco’s hips down to stop him from thrusting into Harry’s throat. The way he kept muttering Harry’s name — names, actually, he kept drifting from
Draco folded his arms. He glanced at Blaise, but had to assume there were no secrets here. He shrugged. “I’ll do it.”
She sobbed into the handkerchief for several minutes, trying not to shrug away Draco’s gentle hand on her shoulder. The implications were horrendous. Either Dumbledore hadn’t known what was happening at the Dursleys’ house, because he had never checked in, which made him neglectful himself. Or he knew and did nothing, which made him complicit. And after all of that, Dumbledore had used him as a weapon.
“You lost your wand?” Hermione said, sharply. They were both so used to Harry’s wandless spells, many of them non-verbal, that she hadn’t even known there was anything wrong with it.
“Thank you,” Draco said, sounding strangled. “I’ll give that some thought. It’s a very kind invitation.”
“Don’t look so appalled, Harry. You know I was on house arrest for a year while the rest of you were nursing Hogwarts back to health. I mastered a few spells. I was desperately bored without you to taunt.”
Harry stood up. “I’d better go,” he said. “You, too, if you’re going to make your film. What are you seeing?”
Draco couldn’t possibly know that there was nothing the three of them didn’t share, but she nodded. Let him double up on answers. Ron would be happy to show him through the house again, as long as he was wearing this face, and not the other one.
Harry wanted to help him walk back to the potions classroom and his rooms beyond, but he was too hurt, and embarrassed, and angry. So he nodded tightly, and Malfoy left.
Draco hesitated, and then lifted his right arm to show Harry. “I designed them to hide the Dark Mark. I tried to get rid of it. It scarred, and I still… I
“Ah. You need to make sure they have plenty of snacks. I will have one brought from the storeroom for you for next lesson.” One, Harry thought, that he would ensure had no scribbling in the margins.
Draco laughed, and shot out ahead of Harry, only to curse as Harry slipped past him, making a face, just barely avoiding a tree on the edge of the lake as he shot high up into the air.
Ron’s delight at having Harry back was palpable. It ached, a little, though. Ron wanted to act as if Harry had been gone for a couple of weeks, and wasn’t interested in hearing any kind of details. Harry knew not to try to share them, but the scene made Hermione ache for the days when the three of them had never had a single secret from each other.
Hermione moved her chair closer to the bed, thoroughly chastised. She took Harry’s hand in her own and watched his chest rise and fall.
in his dreams. I assume that when I am not there, he is enjoying a very vigorous sex life with a figment of his imagination, but I have been rather too preoccupied with attempts to open some of the doors around the house and keep him talking to take him up on his repeated and passionate offers. Are we clear?”
“I told her I would be delighted,” Harry said, finishing his last piece of sausage. “Now, if you’ll both excuse me —”
That night Harry slept in Ron and Hermione’s guest bedroom, quite unnecessarily, and they took a slow breakfast around noon. Bacon and eggs on toast, mug after mug of coffee until they decided they’d never sleep if they didn’t switch to tea, fresh orange juice and sharing stories about the day before.
“I was thinking it might be time to sell her. The house. Or give her away, perhaps, though I would clearly need to get rid of that bloody portrait. D’you know someone who could help me with that?”
That night, Harry sat on the couch at Ron and Hermione’s house and admitted the story, haltingly, and without enough detail for Ron to get nauseated. He had both hands wrapped around a crystal whiskey glass, warming the Firewhiskey inside with his hands until he could smell it, the low honey notes and the faint smokiness. Ron and Hermione’s home was nicer each time Harry visited; piece by piece they had decorated it, painted it, added tiny treasures and more photographs until it was beginning to feel like an extension of the Burrow. Which, while not fully recovered into its former glory, was still the homiest home Harry had ever known. Quilted blankets and cushions, mismatched teacups and plates from thrift shops around London; Harry loved it, here.
a good line, though. It’s good to know you’re not out of practice,” Draco promised, and then moaned obscenely when Harry gripped his cock and began a slow stroke. His hips snapped automatically, fucking up into Harry’s hand, his cock hard as diamonds and throbbing. A trickle of pre-come escaped from the tip and Harry brought his hand to his mouth, to taste. “Merlin’s tits, Harry. Do you know what you look like right now?”
“Well, spit it out. This had better not be you begging for remedial Potions lessons. As much as I would enjoy your debasement, I’m afraid there’s nothing to be done for your appalling lack of ability.”
“It wasn’t a hardship,” Draco muttered, when he could, glancing at the floorboards. “I’ll leave you to get some sleep. I eat around seven. If you’re awake, you’re welcome to join me. Otherwise, Rubino can make you breakfast in the morning.” Draco nodded tightly. “Sleep well, Auror Potter. Tomorrow we’ll discuss a recovery plan.” And then he turned on his heel, and he was already closing the door and heading down the stairs before Harry could stir himself to reply.
Hermione sat straight in her chair. “He said he can’t teach anyone to make a wand if they don’t already know how, didn’t he. Oh, Harry — did he?” Hermione’s eyes were wide with excitement. “What did he say?”
He tossed his own wand to the ground, startled by the hollow, wooden sound it made as it clattered on the tiles.
“You love your life, don’t you?” he asked, but it was less like a question than a wondrous understanding. “You really love your life. This shop. Your friends. Your… family. You figured things out.”
“I’m sure I don’t know,” Draco said. “You can go. Please tell Auror Lisbon to join me in twenty minutes.”
Draco pulled the sleeves of his cardigan — Harry’s cardigan — down over his hands. “Aren’t you going to ask me what I’m doing here, Potter? Haven’t you got a handful of nosy Gryffindors downstairs waiting for the gossip?”
The bathroom was unpleasant. No one used this one, which was precisely why Draco did; when he had started confiding to Moaning Myrtle he wasn’t sure, but at this point in his miserable life she was the only person in the world who understood him. Who knew what was happening.
. I had so many howlers on the second day that my ears were ringing for days — almost as many as Headmaster McGonagall.”
Draco barely registered Harry’s gesture before the Warming Charm enveloped him. He didn’t want to let out the treacherous, contented little moan, but he’d been caught unaware. He wondered if Harry even realised he’d done it. Perhaps, perhaps not. He was still smiling, but he looked wistful, as well, letting his gaze fall on the castle.
. He liked his hair longer. The bit that always stood up was heavy enough now to stay down, and though he wouldn’t have admitted it out loud, he thought it made him look rather rakish.
Black is taking Master Potter to his Villa,” Rubino said. He produced a slip of parchment and handed it to Hermione before bowing so low his little nose almost touched the ground. “Minister and her friend are to use the Floo.” He disapparated with a crack, and Hermione was left with her mouth hanging open.
Mrs Malfoy waved her wand again, and Harry realised that it wasn’t lazy, just… elegant and economical. A plate of macaroons appeared on the coffee table. She lifted the plate and offered one to Harry, her expression expectant. Harry didn’t need a macaroon.
“I want to get your mother a Christmas gift,” Harry said, abruptly. “Do you have any idea of what she might like?”
Shortly after dawn, Hermione emerged, her hair a fascinating great mess and her cheeks pink. She kissed Harry’s forehead and made herself a cup of coffee, as well.
Hermione nodded. “Yes. It took some time. The castle herself helped, of course, but there was a lot of work to do. Harry and Ron and I were there for months, helping, until Ron and I went to Australia, to —”
“I fail to see the relevance,” he said, coolly. “As you may recall, Professor Snape loathed Remus Lupin to the core of his being, and yet for the year he taught Defence at Hogwarts he faithfully and immaculately brewed him the Wolfsbane Potion every month.
“Funny,” Topher said. “Figured the Hero of the Wizarding World would have been the one to get the girl. Cheers, on behalf of the little guys. Well played.”
“Harry has constructed a world in his mind. It is very consistent. It is very secure. And he doesn’t want to leave. Every attempt that I have made to work against his wishes has resulted in some catastrophe or another. I am pushed out of his head, I am attacked by a basilisk. He has doors in the house which he has sealed closed in various ways and until I can find a way to get him to talk about them I am completely stuck. It’s been a month since you brought him to Naples, Hermione, and the only real progress I’ve made is figuring out some of the reasons he doesn’t want me to make any progress.”
“Every door in this house, every window, and a few… extra spots — they contain something that Harry doesn’t want to think about anymore. He’s locked them up, and now he’s pretending that they’re just not there. His life is precisely as he wishes it, so long as he doesn’t have to think about the things that he’s hidden away.”
Potter looked relieved for the change of subject, and he reached for his glass. “If we’re going to sit here and talk about clothes all night, then sod the Dreamless Sleep. You
Harry startled again, and when he looked down the hallway, there was Kreacher, looking utterly starstruck (or at least as starstruck as it was possible to be, for an elf of Kreacher’s disposition).
,” he said, waving a wand at all of the mess. It felt as if his eyes might be watering from the pain, but he widened his smile and patted her shoulder.
He loved the long evenings of the summer. More than the warm weather, he enjoyed the way the day stretched out like the shadows, the way the sun was coming up when he opened his eyes. He cast a quick
“I think I can manage all of that,” he said, sounding remarkably prudish, enough so that Harry had to laugh. “But I need you to do me a favour, too, Harry.”
“It’s Sunday,” Harry said, a few minutes later, settling himself on the windowsill beside Draco. Draco didn’t respond. “I’ll be heading for lunch at the Burrow. I thought — I thought you might want to come with me.”
On a Friday night, eating Thai food in the kitchen with the WWN on for company, Harry handed Hermione an envelope. “I keep meaning to give you these,” he said.
There was a clap in one corner of the room, and the clapper stood up. Bit by bit, confused people clapped their agreement, or at least their understanding, and soon, most of the guests were on their feet; the applause became deafening. Harry was startled. He had assumed that they would be angry, as Robards (still in his chair and still pulsing with fury) so evidently was, or positively thriving on the scandal of it. But instead he saw a dawning comprehension, and respect, gratefulness, and maybe… maybe even
He placed it carefully in a long box, marked the end, and set it aside. The owner of such a wand would be an unusual person indeed; no need for it to be placed with the general stock.
Potter looked like he wanted to hide under that old invisibility cloak of his. He shook his head, but he didn’t take a step, which was telling. “You envied me? If you even knew how cracked that is —”
Emrys laughed out loud. “This isn’t a tea conversation. I’m not even sure it’s a supervision session.” He paused, and raised his eyebrows, and looked very deliberately at his teacup. “Topher. I thought the implication was very clear.”
But instead he found himself meandering aimlessly down a street in Muggle London. The day was unseasonably warm but there was a nice breeze. Harry found an old black cat with one eye patrolling the front steps of a small house set close to the footpath, and crouched down to pet it. It spent an appropriate amount of time staring at him disdainfully and tolerating his gentle hand, and then curled around Harry’s feet, demanding to be petted. One cat soon became three, all looking for attention.
“You’re still in there, then,” Draco said. “Good. I’m not thrilled with the idea of doing another swan-dive through hell, but I’ll do it, as long as you’re prepared for a chat at the end. Definitely time we made some progress here, though. I wish I had some idea of why you’ve got me in there with you. If it’s just because I’m the one visiting, or…”
Harry reached out, and settled his hand on Draco’s knee. Draco tensed, and relaxed, and seemed to slump. A little, and then a lot; he unfolded himself and dropped his cheek onto Harry’s thigh, letting Harry run a hand over his spiky hair. It felt so strange, and so right, and Harry felt his heart race and then slow again. The sky brightened from black to dark blue, and then the beginnings of purple crept into the shadows.
The first kiss was not perfect but it was very nearly so, and perhaps it was more perfect for its imperfection. It was warm, and tentative; affectionate and wary.
“I’ll call his lawyers,” she said at last. “You mustn’t grieve too terribly, Harry, he had a very full life and he knew what was coming.”
of May, 1999, the first anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts. It wasn’t a good night, and no more needs to be said about it here.
“No, you shouldn’t,” Draco disagreed, letting his gaze flicker from Harry’s eyes, to his mouth, and back again. “Not everyone here is looking for a bride, Harry.”
Draco had been there, and seen it, and worse, he’d played along with it. Used Harry’s feelings for him to coax him out of his head. Which was probably entirely reasonable from a therapeutic point of view, but that didn’t make Harry’s stomach hurt any less.
“I told you. A very comfortable guest room. Plenty of time to rest. Good food, the healing powers of the ocean — the air is warm and the water is cool, at this time of year. If it makes any difference to you… I work long hours. You would have the place to yourself, for the most part.”
He held Harry’s gaze for a minute, for two. Harry searched his face for something — Draco couldn’t guess what. A sneer, a sprinkle of mockery, a pinch of cruelty.
“It’s lovely,” Harry said again, shuffling across the shiny floorboards to open a window and let the sea air in. The room was circular, the four poster bed piled up with what looked suspiciously like old, comfortable, handmade quilts. Not very Malfoyish, if he was honest.
“It’s another super-hero movie,” Ron said, his eyes shooting up into his fringe. “X-Men. They’re like Wizards, except they can’t do as much, poor sods. And it’s because of… er… blood things. Merlin, Muggles come up with funny ideas. I’m in it for the popcorn, really. And a bit of a grope.”
“Just follow my movements,” Draco said, and Harry wondered where exactly the nearest volcano was. “When I step forward, you step back, and so forth. I promise not to dip you. I wouldn’t want all the blood to rush to your head and make you swoon.”
He gave the little girl gripping Pansy’s hand a smile, but she was too busy staring at the mountain of wands to notice him.
Harry had been cooking up a right snit, but it felt pointless, suddenly. He didn’t care about any of it; he was just happy for some good company in a warm pub. He was even happy to have Draco by his side, laughing and snickering and tossing out rude comments at every opportunity.
“Oh, Harry,” Hermione said, dropping into the armchair by the lamp in Harry’s office. She wanted to tear herself into pieces. She wanted him back — the DMLE needed him back. Harry had been refusing to take up the post of Chief Auror for years, because he always said he needed to be in the field, but that didn’t change the fact that he had been running the place for almost a decade. And that his extraordinary success rate had seemed to make pursuing Dark Magic significantly less attractive than throwing oneself into more legal and satisfying pastimes. Auror Robards was a signature, these days, and everyone knew it, including him.
“Don’t be foolish. If any family had more than one a year the whole of society would assume they were trying to marry off a troll. The Bulstrodes are hosting the next one. Millicent has been married for years, but her younger sister is of age.” Draco spoke primly, and with feigned disinterest.
“You thought what, I’d come in here and shout at him for abandoning us, bully him into explaining where he’s been the last few years? Shout at him for being such an inconsiderate numpty?” Harry raised his eyebrows. “Right. Fair enough,” Pansy said, and dropped her shoulders. “But why did he come here?”
Finn and Luna had spent a couple of weeks helping to re-home a colony of Striped Copper Moles (previously thought extinct by Luna and imaginary to almost everyone else in the Wizarding World) as their cave system was about to be demolished to make way for the tennis courts at a new seaside resort for Muggles. Grayson had stayed at home, working on his novel in a Muggle overcoat (“terribly smart, but itchy on the bollocks when you’re sitting down”), pretending to be tortured (“because what if that’s why I didn’t finish my first novel? I wasn’t tortured enough? I think the itchy balls are probably important for the torture”).
Malfoy tightened his hand around Harry’s, and tensed, beginning to open his eyes. Harry waved his wand lazily and the chair began to straighten into a chair again; still lazy and easy, but not longer flat for sleeping.
Draco didn’t look at him. He sipped his tea, instead, and glanced at the breakfast tray. Harry might have wondered if he was about to say something rude about the service here (which would be ideal, as it would give Harry the opportunity to toss him out on his lily-white arse) but a moment’s consideration suggested something else. Draco was starving hungry, ravenous: he just didn’t think he could eat.
Professor Bennett left shortly afterwards; she complained that she had to unbox thirty teapots for practical work the following week, which Harry thought didn’t sound like too much work, until she added that they were in a classroom that had fallen into disuse because of a doxy infestation. Harry promised to help her, if she didn’t mind him keeping the doxies for a class the following week. Professor Bennett accepted cheerfully.
“It’s alright,” Harry said, crouching in front of him, forgetting the entire clan of Weasleys were watching. He healed Draco’s hand, and repaired the strings, and though Draco looked doubtful for a moment he tried again to tune the guitar and this time the strings held.
“Don’t get your knickers in a knot,” Draco said, but when she looked up Draco was actually smiling. “Just a bit of boyhood fun. He seems to be rather settled. Can’t believe he… well.” Draco sipped his whiskey.
“Nah. He’s worked with most of us at some point or another. Probably hard to get anyone to put up with him in the long term.”
“A gift from a fan.” Malfoy sounded like he was trying to make a joke, but he was obviously in terrible pain, and Harry realised at once that he had a fever. The object in his pocket looked, for a moment, like a simple crystal ball, quite lovely at a glance. But the oiliness of the dark magic writhing inside it was very far from lovely. Even through the dragon hide gloves, Harry felt it reaching, reaching —
Draco took a deep breath, and reminded himself — in his mother’s voice, no less — that he was from a very long line of pureblood wizards and knew how to comport himself. He stopped at Potter’s shoulder. Maybe Potter had grown up, after all. He looked tired, he looked… he looked like a man who’d barely survived a war, is what he looked like, and as Draco knew what that was like he couldn’t begrudge him the shadows under the eyes.
“I think it’s fair to say that we are friends, at this point, and colleagues. Neither of us has committed bodily harm against the other, unless you count a jelly-legs jinx. We’ve even progressed to first names. Happy?”
“I’m dessert tonight,” Harry said, and he pulled two of Draco’s fingers into his mouth. Draco snickered at him, but then, very annoyingly, he wrestled Harry to his feet. Standing there in front of the fire, in his home, with Draco’s hands cupping his face, Harry should only have felt safe and happy, but something stirred deep in his stomach.
“No,” Harry said. “I’m no bloody good at it. And I’m a disaster, you know that. Not right in the head, and that was even before the war. Now I’m even more rubbish at things. And I — and he — I’ve mastered the art of a dirty weekend, but he’s really not the sort, and anyway, I don’t want that.”
“Harry, darling,” Mrs Malfoy said, taking his arm to help him out of the fireplace. “I’m so delighted you could join us. Please, Draco, bring our guest to the parlour.”
Mrs Anand nodded. She looked as if she’d been surprised, and then decided she shouldn’t be, and then decided she was, just the same. “Very good, Mr Potter. I know they are not used in Britain.”
. Despite the tiredness and the shaking hands.” Harry wanted to say something sharp in response but Draco’s expression suggested that this was familiar territory for him — a Healer, who would ever have imagined that — and that he wasn’t being scolded like a mortal enemy but jostled along like any other pig-headed patient.
“You’ve never really talked about your…” Family was the wrong word. “Your Muggle relatives. I know they weren’t kind.”
“Please, Harry.” Draco stepped closer. He seemed taller, suddenly, or else Harry was shorter. Something. No, he was shorter — shorter, and skinny, and his glasses seemed to be doing their best to fall off his face. He pushed them further up the bridge of his nose, and pulled away again.
“Alright,” Harry said. He hadn’t been expecting an apology; he really hadn’t. The silent understanding they had arrived at the previous week was as much as Harry was ever going to want or need from Malfoy and he was quite sure Malfoy felt the same. “Malfoy — what are you going to do?”
“No,” Harry said, forcing a smile, and he escaped to the kitchen. Maybe some hot chocolate. He hadn’t had hot chocolate in a long time. Yes, hot chocolate. Except he also wanted to climb under the dining room table and imagine it was his old bed at Hogwarts, curtains keeping him in and everything else out.
They apparated to Grimmauld Place, and Harry immediately thought of Number Twelve. And then there she was, elbowing herself into place between the neighbouring houses.
Malfoy turned to Neville. Neville was calmly eating, pretending he hadn’t just kicked Malfoy in the shin, but Harry felt his face burn. There were not a lot of people who knew about Harry’s childhood beyond having been raised by an Aunt and an Uncle. Neville could relate, as good a woman as his Grandmother was. But something about his misery at the loss of his parents had led Harry to tell him a little more about it, one night when they were sitting on the windowsill of their dormitory unable to sleep, watching the sleet fall. The cupboard under the stairs. Feeling hungry all the time. His sneaking suspicion that the reason he never got as tall as his father was as simple as never having had enough to eat.
“He’s behind, of course,” Hermione admitted. “But he loves to go to Romania and spend time with Charlie Weasley, and the dragons. There’s always so much to do. And he enjoys it,” she almost shouted, afterwards.
“It’s just, it’s what we were going to do together,” he said. “I thought we’d do it together, graduate together, be partners for our whole lives —”
“You were. You are,” Hermione said, and they spent a long time clinging tight to each other, before Ron pulled away with a shy smile and disappeared into the green flames. After a final look around Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place, Hermione followed suit.
“My clothes are in the wardrobe. My books are in the shelves.” He shrugged, beginning to feel annoyed. “If this is the way you express your gratitude for my having prevented you from dying looking like an old raisin —”
Harry nodded, and turned to Madam Pomfrey, who was loosening Malfoy’s clothes and cooling his forehead again. “Is he alright?”
typical for a late July day in London, he took a long, aimless stroll in the general direction of things that made him happy. A man stopped him in the street and asked the time.
“There’s no rush, Harry. I don’t want you to come home and just wish yourself into a mystical coma again.”
“Harry,” Professor McGonagall said, clearly distressed, enough so she could ignore how tired she was. “Do you know how this happened?”
He didn’t like the way they looked; he never had, really, and he didn’t know why. He wore jeans and t-shirts beneath his practical Auror robes as often as he could, and he always had. Sometimes he wore a suit, if the occasion or job required. He hated formal robes, but for this particular occasion, they did seem appropriate.
Draco looked at Harry’s wand, raised, ready. He could still attack; but would he have? All of those years ago — would Harry have struck first? Or had he only been defending himself?
Ron looked disappointed; Hermione looked like she knew he was lying. To her credit, she didn’t say a word.
“In this weather? It’ll be packed to the rafters and it’ll take two hours to get fed. We’ll just eat here.”
He stared at the fire, the light dancing across his pale features, and sipped the whiskey. Hermione wondered if he even remembered she was there. They were supposed to be talking about Harry, and yet, she wanted —
Blaise didn’t argue. He followed Harry inside, and up the stairs to the lit fireplace. “You doing New Year’s Eve this year?”
“Of course I don’t,” Draco said, raising an eyebrow. “I spent the war eating bonbons and going to Pureblood courting dances.”
“Your father’s ghost just woke up screaming in horror,” Harry said, but Draco didn’t laugh. “And isn’t it really up to me, to decide who’s good enough to be a part of my life?”
“I can’t wait to hear,” Emrys replied, in his thick Welsh accent. He was attractive — tall, and heavy-boned, and utterly comfortable in his skin, a trait Draco had always envied. If he hadn’t been married — and straight — Draco might have found himself crossing that line as well. Apparently these days there were no lines he could claim to hold sacred.
, all the time, living with him, sleeping with him, bickering with him. He wanted Draco’s morning breath and his snide comments and his sparkling eyes. He wasn’t sure he could even look at his bedroom knowing that it would always be half empty. And knowing that Draco had to have described all of this, in enough detail so that Kreacher could make it happen. As if he’d cared. As if he’d wanted Harry to make his home here again.
“I’m going,” Neville said, from Draco’s left side, waving his own invitation. “I’ll be delighted to go! Draco, will you let your tailor see to me, too?”
“I know you don’t want to hear it, mate, but he is exactly as good as they say he is. Probably better.”
“Any day, now,” she said happily. “Fit to burst. Harry. We’ve all done things we regret, every single one of us. Some worse than others, but isn’t that all a matter of circumstance? Oh, she’s kicking again. She’s an athlete. She’ll play for the Harpies, you can bet. Or, if she’s a Squib, perhaps she’ll play football.” She looked up at Harry. “We all need to remember that there are no guarantees. About
“You must know Peregrine Derrick is the most indiscreet man in the whole of Britain. I cannot believe you shagged a
“What’s it going to take to get you to use my first name?” Harry asked with an affectedly mournful tone.
“Well, I don’t know,” she said. “I was going to say ‘elephant’ but that sounds so Muggle-ish. We’ve been in this world for so long. It’s hard to think about the old one.”
“Thank you,” he said. He opened his mouth again, as if to say something else, but shovelled a mouthful of peas into it instead.
“Well, I think I can keep it brief.” Draco tipped his head on that beautiful long neck and his eyes, which had darkened a little since he was young, sparkled warmly. “How are you feeling?”
And then the plates vanished again, and everyone present turned to the front of the room, ready to listen.
Draco woke to find Harry half-sprawled over his side. Head on Draco’s shoulder, arm across his chest, hand tucked securely under Draco’s body, just above the jagged cut of his hip.
“You’re still as pig-headed as ever, and you’ve made up your mind what you’ll do. You’re not interested in my advice, or my rather expert opinion. So why would I argue?”
Potter had been standing by the side of his chair, there at the Wizengamot. He didn’t look down, didn’t make eye contact with Draco once. He looked as if he hadn’t slept since the Battle of Hogwarts and perhaps he hadn’t — certainly, Draco hadn’t. He was afraid to, afraid that if he slept he would dream that he was in Azkaban.
At last, they started coming out, with amplifiers and a drum kit and a tonne of things Harry didn’t recognise. A huge black tote bag full of… wires. Cords. There was probably a different word for them. Everything was piled into the back of a van with mismatched panels. Finally, Draco came out of the back door as well, a guitar case in each hand. He flipped the driver the bird, and the driver laughed, and the van was gone. And Draco Malfoy was lighting a cigarette in the rear alley behind a Muggle bar in Camden in leather pants that looked as if they’d been painted on. He dropped a backpack off his shoulder and fished out a hoodie that had seen better days, pulling it on without dropping his cigarette.
“I’m not going to be able to brew your dreamless sleep tonight. Not like this. So I need you to come back here and let me talk you through it. You can go, now, Harry. I’ll rest a while; I don’t have classes this afternoon and I’d like to sleep a little. Thank you for your assistance. Goodbye.”
; he’d never slipped into his own head in any of these memories, he realised with a start. Only ever feeling Harry. Harry’s feelings, Harry’s memories.
“Yes,” he said. “I told you that the stasis spells can only do so much. It’s getting harder to stay on top of the dehydration, and I am concerned about the potential for atrophy. Of his muscles and his magic. It seems too soon for any of that, but… Harry is an exceptionally strong Wizard, as you know all too well. I hadn’t considered the potential impact of being cut off from his magic for so long. I assumed that with his great strength that we’d have more time, but I think it means we may have less.”
“Anything,” Harry promised, slipping his hand under Draco’s t-shirt and thrilling to the way Draco whimpered in response. “We — bedroom? Please. I want to look at you.”
. The Ancient and Most Noble House of Black has a staff again.” He put his arm out to press against the shoulder of the elf wearing the pillowcase. “Hennie,” he said. Hennie stood up very straight, trembling slightly. “And Gertie. Gertie is wanting to be paid, Master Potter.”
“Your owl is very lovely,” he said, rather than cause the poor child irrevocable trauma. “What’s their name?”
Harry wanted an owl. It had been twenty years since Hedwig had died, and if there was a part of him that had never wanted to love another creature so much, that part of him was gone, now. He wanted an owl who would close their eyes when he scratched his fingernails through the feathers at their neck, and hoot softly and nip affectionately at his fingers. Maybe he’d get a cat, as well. Or a Kneazle. They were so smart.
“Bet you I’ll drop the soap!” Draco called down the stairs. “Here I go! Whoops, there go my pyjama pants.”
friends. When he wasn’t studying he worked in one hospital or another. He was good with children and he was kind and smart and funny and mean, and he knew which of those to use and when. I liked seeing him. Sitting near him in a quiet café or the library, just watching him exist. And then he went to Italy, studied in Rome for a couple of years. And then to a hospital in Naples. Eventually, it wasn’t enough to watch him; I had to speak to him. I’m quite good with Glamours myself, thanks to my work. My previous work,” he corrected. He looked ashamed, but determined, and hopeful.
“You old flirt,” Draco said, languidly. “Yours. I’ll bring the wine.” And his nose was back in his book, and Harry returned to his food, and pretended that Neville wasn’t boring a hole into the side of his head with that look.
Time to stop feeling sorry for herself. Hermione climbed to her feet, and opened the scroll of parchment.
Between courses there was an operatic quartet. Harry hated it, but he couldn’t deny that they were good, and he clapped louder and longer than most.
Draco was sitting up in the bed, white as a ghost —… well, whiter than usual, despite the smudged eyeliner. Or maybe that made it look worse, Harry wasn’t really sure. He had the mug of tea in his hands.
There had been so much to do, though. Rebuilding Hogwarts took months — it was far quicker to rebuild than a simple Muggle castle would have been, since the castle was determined to help, but the castle couldn’t do everything itself — it was injured. It had been mortally wounded, and for the first few weeks people wondered if it had actually died.
There was a spike of something in his demeanour; dishonesty, Harry thought. It had really only been a line, and he’d intended to follow it with a smooth ‘then do you want to get out of here?’. But Lucas was watching the band set up. He liked them. Or he liked one of them, anyway. Harry started to think he might be barking up the wrong tree. He bought a round of drinks.
Minerva nodded, and gripped Harry’s shoulder a moment. “The students arrive in four days,” she said. “Neville should be able to help with anything you need, until then — but don’t hesitate to come and visit, or to ask me any questions you may have.”
“I’ll certainly give that some thought. Thank you,” he said, and there was another tug behind Draco’s bellybutton. He was folded through time and space, sleep an wakefulness, across years and continents, landing in a hospital bed alongside his very vulnerable and very unconscious patient.
The dragon, the enormous snake — Draco forced himself to look, this time, and it was so much worse. Dementors rushing at him. It seemed a little excessive, if it was intended to keep someone out, but Draco hadn’t ever experienced anything like it. He felt the sharp pain of the dislocated shoulder and the smack to the back of the head, and he felt himself go entirely numb.
husband one day. And then he’d go and visit Granger and the Weasel and tell the story and they’d all laugh until they had tears running down their cheeks.
She sighed, and picked vegetables out of her noodles. “You stopped going out. And I know I wasn’t the most supportive of you just… shagging random Muggle boys…”
“Come on. We’ll be alright. I love you,” Harry said. “I’m sure we can borrow a couple of kids whenever you’re in dire straits. Rose and Hugo. Rose loves painting over your tattoos.”
He could feel the twinkle in his own eyes, and when Harry looked up to see whether he was being teased, or really criticised, he relaxed quickly.
“Oh. No, no, I refuse to think about them having sex, let alone kinky sex. In fact I have already decided that they sleep in separate twins beds and only kiss on special occasions. Because otherwise I’d keep throwing up all over everything and everyone for all eternity. Which I might do right now, actually,” she said, looking across the tables to where Draco and Harry were still dancing, as if they hadn’t noticed everybody else had decided their feet needed a rest. She made an appalled face.
, tying it to Narcissa’s owl’s leg and feeding her a large piece of fruit bread, before scratching the back of her neck just as she liked, and calmly returning to his breakfast of… salt, and grease, and something approximating meat.
Narcissa smiled coyly. “I shall have them sent to you tomorrow.” She took a sip of the wine, and closed her eyes a moment, savouring it. An older couple paused by the table to give her a disgusted look, and she smiled aristocratically at them, before turning back to Draco. “Don’t, darling. We will never stoop to their level. Remember who we are.”
Draco spluttered his own glass of wine so badly he nearly choked. It took him a good two minutes to get his breath back. His mother spent those two minutes examining her nails and taking another sip of wine. And to compound his fury, embarrassment, and other emotions that were making his face go from pale, to pink, to tomato red and onward to something that was probably rather better characterised as aubergine, she didn’t even bother to follow it up with an apology, or a clarification, or anything at all that might predispose him not to surrender her to the Janus Thickey ward to live out her last hundred or so years.
, and break his fucking heart, and I have to start all over again.” Draco dragged his fingers through his hair repeatedly. He pasted the map to the table with a temporary sticking charm, and lit his wand again.
Draco’s footsteps paused in the kitchen, and Harry held his breath. Maybe Draco wouldn’t notice. But of course, he did. He pushed aside the curtains.
,” Draco scoffed. He levitated the platter onto his bedside table, and climbed over Harry, straddling his hip, slowly rocking against him until Harry was getting hard. “You still have a great deal to learn about me, Harry Potter. Boy Who Fell Asleep.”
“I know.” Hermione ran her finger along the timeline again. “The troll in the dungeon, in First Year?”
“If you’re not ready very soon, it will be too late,” Draco said, pressing in close. “You need to trust me. I know that’s hard. I know I was an utter shit, to you, to all of your friends. But we grew up. Right, Harry? My love? We grew up. We’re not those boys anymore.”
“D’you want to see? What it was like? He didn’t want to do it, you know. When he realised what was happening in your head. He showed me a memory in my pensieve, and told me I had to decide if it was alright for him to… I can show you, Harry. What he was like, when he started to think he couldn’t wake you ever.”
Harry was so stunned by the question that he immediately stood up, wand in hand, looking around at everything of value he owned. Mad-Eye’s old foe glass, milky with age, alongside the new one that Ron and Hermione had given him for his birthday. His broom; it had been a while since he flew it, but it was the very latest, a rare indulgence. His cabinets were locked, and they were warded, and if anyone was daft enough to try to rob an ex-Auror they were in for a terrible shock. He tucked his wand away in the pocket of his robe.
A tear fell from the corner of Harry’s eye, but when he looked up and met Draco’s eyes again, the expression was one of guarded hope.
Harry sighed in relief. “Fine.” He stood slowly, as if he was still exhausted, and Hermione thought he probably was. “Can I invite Ron around for dinner? I just want him to know I’m alright, and apologise for worrying him.”
Harry and Ron and Hermione hadn’t waited very long before they started helping to rebuild Hogwarts, and there was something extremely satisfying about physical exhaustion. Hogwarts herself helped, of course. She wanted to be repaired, she just couldn’t do it by herself, so it was common to find that the stones that had been levitated into place on a destroyed wall would be firmly mortared into place by the following morning. A lot of the community came to help. Most of the Weasleys were there, including Charlie for a few days at a time before he started worrying about his dragons, and that was family.
“Harry Potter,” Pansy kept saying. She was full to the eyeballs of her own whiskey, and, Hermione hated to notice,
Teddy’s hair turned abruptly white, like Draco’s, cropped close to his head. “Harry,” he said, reaching for Harry’s nose. “I’ve been thinking about certain things and I think we should go for some ice cream.”
She had accepted it, delighted, and declared herself a free elf. And then she’d gone back to work, refused to leave the house, the silly thing. She still wore it today, kept it clean and pressed and carefully covered it with a smock while she worked in the kitchen. And she had been very solicitous of Draco’s favour since.
me, mother. And if he doesn’t, it’s only because he’s learned to tolerate me. We need each other for work things, that’s all. My…”
“Oh,” he said. “I hadn’t given it much thought. That Muggle café near your school with the brilliant steak and mushroom pies?”
“How on earth did I convince you that we should do this in England?” Draco growled, fretting over his tie in the full-length mirror and unnecessarily adjusting his formal robes. The latest thing, they’d said, a cross between a Muggle tuxedo and Wizard robes. Draco wasn’t convinced he liked them but he was convinced that he wanted to get married in the latest thing. Kreacher was shining his shoes and muttering under his breath.
When Hogwarts was standing, and the required work became much more fiddly specialist magic, Harry and Hermione followed Ron to the Burrow. Molly didn’t say a word when Hermione moved into Ron’s bedroom, and Harry himself commandeered the comfiest couch near the downstairs fireplace. And everything was lovely.
Perhaps he’d sneaked down the street to buy pastries, but Harry didn’t think it likely. Perhaps he’d gone to visit Pansy or Blaise? No. It was that time of the morning when Diagon Alley was just starting to get busy, people lining up at apparition points, calling hello to their neighbours. Smaller children were being herded off to nursery school. Draco wouldn’t have left while the streets were that busy.
Draco crossed his arms over his body, and Harry dropped his line of questioning. A couple of minutes later, Draco eased himself elegantly onto the wide windowsill, still looking out over the street. There was snow, of course, not real snow, but the sort that everyone wanted to see at Christmas. Settling on the window panes and crunching beneath people’s feet on the cobblestones, not dreary and grey and soaking into their boots as it melted.
Draco raised his eyebrows, daring Blaise to argue with him, but Blaise’s expression only softened into a warm smile.
Draco didn’t look up. He could brew this particular potion in his sleep, but he took his time. This was the first time he’d been alone with Potter since the term had started. But whatever it was he’d been planning to say, he had clearly decided against it, reaching for his glass, instead. Draco was gratified that he noticed it wasn’t the ugly crystalware from the kitchens, but a Malfoy heirloom. Potter turned the tumbler in his hand, admiring the rainbows cast within.
“This Glamour of yours is a bit of alright,” Blaise said, gesturing at Malfoy’s face. “You really just wear it all the time?”
Harry snorted, despite himself. “Alright. I can sit on my arse a little longer. I could probably stop invading your, uh, home, though.”
Draco nodded, mentally noting the locations in his head, and snickering quietly at Hermione’s cautious tone.The next line was significantly more difficult to decipher.
“No. He doesn’t like it to be disturbed. You’ve seen the sign on the door. He’s on holidays. You can ask him to show you when he gets back.” Harry gave Draco what felt like a very shaky smile and tried to pull away.
“He’s my Mind Healer. Was, anyway. That’s all there is to it. All there can be. All there ever should be. He’s come a long way, ‘Mione. He’s a good man doing good work and he doesn’t — he’s good. I don’t —”
“We agreed I could come back. He’s sending my files to St. Mungo’s.” He smiled, but Hermione knew Harry well enough to know when he was lying.
“Do you really think I imagined I’d be able to appear in Diagon Alley, at your shop, and avoid your friends forever? I might be an idiot, Potter, but I’m not stupid. I
“You love it,” Harry said, laughing. “Come on, Floo time. I want to take you home and keep you awake into the small hours of the morning. Best ask Rubino to pop in with snacks later.”
Merlin’s balls. He could go back and try to sneak into the fireplace. He could try to climb over the fence, and hope that the wards didn’t go too high.
“You never win,” he said. “Not because you don’t make good moves, because you do. But you’re not willing to sacrifice any of your pieces. I never noticed. But I win while you have more pieces still left on the board. You’ll use a knight to protect a pawn.”
Harry was just relieved that their conversation the night before hadn’t left any awkwardness to float around between them. “Yes, please. Because I am so intrigued, and also, really fucking hungry. You’re up early,” he said.
“Oh. No,” she said. “They were unkind, but it wasn’t — like that,” she said, relaxing slightly. Though only for a moment. “Oh, Draco. No.”
“Come on, Daisy — oh, would you stop trying to pull your hair from its braid, you look like a werewolf!”
“Ask him back, and tell him to bring a couple of friends. Make him the boss. That elf might be a thousand years old and quite possible demented but he knows this house better than any Witch or Wizard that has ever lived here could hope to. I can’t imagine he’s been happy being sent away.”
Back at the Burrow, after celebrating graduation with the Weasleys, Harry, Ron and Hermione lay on the warm grass under the fading sun.
Harry’s lips curled into a small smile. “I think it’s very fair to say that we both had our moments.”
Harry dropped his head back onto Draco’s shoulder. “I love it when you call me darling. I love you, you know. Do I say it often enough?”
Harry looked around the workroom. There were things he could do, plenty of them, but he had learned to trust when his body felt ready to be finished for the night. It was after eleven, after all.
He didn’t turn to address Blaise directly, but he was quite certain the man was there, tacked away behind a disillusionment charm, or perhaps a simple notice-me-not. “Do you know anything about that case?”
“I’m a posh git by profession, not preference,” Topher said, and Ron laughed, dropping into a chair by the small kitchen table. Seemed barking mad that the thing could fit thirty people when it needed to, but it was being small, for now. He took the mug, and bumped it against Topher’s.
He wished he could offer a reassuring touch of some kind. Brush Harry’s hair away from his face the way his mother would have done it, once. Held him, perhaps, until he fell asleep.
He was missing Draco. Not ready, but missing Draco, like an internal organ, like a lung. There was a lot of talking to be done. There were lies to uncover, and lies of omission. Harry was fairly confident that there was some selling that needed to be done, and definitely some apologising. And there was every chance that wen all of the smoke had cleared, Draco might ask him to leave, and never return.
Once he was presentable, he summoned the Healers that would take care of Harry’s physical needs and spoke to them for a few minutes about the dehydration, Harry’s weakening muscles, and ordered some more of the potion for his skin. Legs, this afternoon, he thought, before he slipped back into Harry’s dream. But for now, he had notes to take and a light meal to linger over. He needed time to think, and time to meditate, and time to plan.
Emrys made a face. “You are hilarious. My point is — if you fell in love with that person, and if years or decades later you suffered a potentially fatal heart attack — would you want them to be the one to take care of you?”
“Draco,” he said, wondering. “Always Draco. Even when he’s angry.” He elected not to add that Harry sometimes called him ‘Malfoy’ when he was trying to talk him out of his clothes.
“You know as well as anyone… better than most,” Blaise said, letting her slip from his grip. “There was nothing but evil, the last year that Malfoy Manor existed. Pansy tried to talk him into selling the land. She thought Muggles might not be able to feel it. That ugliness. And he needed the money — he didn’t inherit the Black fortune until years after he’d disappeared,” Blaise said.
laughter. The kind where tears were soon pouring from Harry’s eyes, and Ron was blinking in amusement. “What? What did I say? ‘Mione? Hey! What did I say?”
When they had gone over every door and window in the place, Hermione could see the problem. If each was a riddle then each had been solved.
“I have to go,” Hermione said. “I nominate you to do the washing up, and then you’re under orders to spend at least most of the day doing nothing at all. I’m very afraid Draco Malfoy is going to show up at the Ministry and hex me, and I’ll deserve it.”
,” Draco said, suddenly alarmed to have Hermione’s arms around him. Hermione’s arms? The Minister for Magic’s arms? A Gryffindor’s arms? “Granger? Hermione? I’m not sure this is the time. You can give me a hug when you’ve paid my bill,” Draco said.
“Seven hells you will,” Ron said. “Come on, Gin, leave him alone to get used to the idea of eating a civil lunch with a bunch of Gryffindorks. You can chop something.” He dragged her by the wrist out to the kitchen and Harry sighed again, and sat down.
He carefully cast the diagnostic spells. On waking, Harry had thrown off the last of the stasis spells, and everything else was returning to normal. His heart rate wasn’t what Draco would have liked. A little thready. But some food, plenty of fluids, and getting up on his feet soon would all help with that. There was damnably little research on the recovery process for people who had managed to wish themselves into a magical coma, though Draco was already planning to write Harry’s case up for publication — with his permission, of course, and carefully distorted so that no one would ever gasp into their freshly delivered
“I have no moral code anymore,” Harry agreed earnestly, his eyes wide. “If that doesn’t work, I have a list of ideas in the pocket of my robes.”
was returning — they were all there. I wanted to take Draco and leave, hide in Norway or perhaps Hungary, where I know distant relations would have taken us in. But I couldn’t leave Lucius, and he refused to follow. He still thought Riddle was the answer to all of our problems. As if we truly
and back again, insensible. Hands tangled in Harry’s hair, controlling his head, which was also all kinds of hot. Apparently, they were going to take a similar approach to sex as they always had to Quidditch. Competitive and snarky.
. We were sitting in front of it. Mirrors have reflections, so it stands to reason that I was sitting there like an idiot with my arms around my ex-nemesis while he sobbed through his childhood trauma and then found some fucking peace. I wasn’t staring at it every second, but I think I would have noticed if it made a rude gesture or something. What?”
When she arrived back in her office, her eagle owl Persephone was perched on the back of her chair. She untied the parchment from Persephone’s leg and fed her a strip of dried meat.
The year after the Battle of Hogwarts had been a terrible one for everyone. There was little anyone could talk about then who they had lost, and who had done what. He’d spent that time, right up until their unprecedented eighth year at Hogwarts sharing a room with Ron and Hermione at the Burrow, and they’d all woken each other up with nightmares at least a few times a week.
But it was only a fucking bird, and Draco Malfoy was a Death Eater, and soon he’d be hunting down Muggles and Muggleborns and he’d be doing so much worse to them. He had a soft shell. He needed to do something about that. Couldn’t run crying to a bathroom over a bird. Or over Katie Bell. She was an idiot. She deserved all that she got.
Harry woke in the morning with absolute awareness of everything that had happened. No long, slow moments before he remembered, no gradual recollection; he woke, and he immediately knew that Draco Malfoy was in his home, and that he needed help.
“You did the right thing. Even when it was idiotic. Even when it was dangerous or illegal. You weren’t following a thousand years of Pureblood law and honouring the commands of your father,” he said, with some weight, hoping that one day, this might be a conversation they could have more seriously. “I hated you. But you were my hero.”
“Where do you think Malfoy is right now?” Harry asked, idly. Neither of his friends answered. He hadn’t really expected they might.
It was almost a relief, when Draco felt the tug of it, somewhere there behind his bellybutton. Just to be away from that overwhelming fear. He didn’t even care if he was going to something worse. He’d have welcomed death like an old friend, but knew he would wake up, instead.
Draco turned back to the television. How many times, Harry wondered, would Muggles re-hash the tales of Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson? He wasn’t really watching, but it was a comforting sort of noise, and the sound of the rain by itself might have felt too sad right now.
“Veronique Pueplier says her daughter has joined your duelling club,” she said, when the niceties had been addressed. “I didn’t know you still had an interest in duelling, Draco — or did you agree for other reasons?”
Draco grinned wider. “Oh, I manage. I’ve charmed the mirror to remind me of how handsome I am while I do other things. Same time next week, Professor Potter?”
November was colder than usual. Colder than anticipated. No snow — there was almost never snow this early — but there was cold rain, and sleet, and hail. Harry closed the shop. It wasn’t the time of the year to buy wands, and anyone in need of a replacement sent an owl to arrange an appointment. Harry was happy about it. It had been some time since he’d been able to truly bury himself in work; the workshop was a riot of wands in various states of unfinished, and Harry was working on a new wand of his own, as well. Holly, slightly springy, 13-1/2” long, core of Hippogriff feather.
Harry laughed. “With luck on my side, sooner or later he’ll be my husband. But we’re old and crotchety and I’m not in a rush any more than he is. Don’t make that face. He’s not going to go running off to find someone else. He knows I’m coming back. He really does know. He’s waiting for me to be ready, and when I am… I’m ready to make the life we both deserve.”
“Unlike you and your dreadful Muggle relatives who didn’t even know how to treat family, let alone a guest, I have manners, Harry,” he said, pushing himself upright and almost floating in the direction of Harry’s quarters.
Draco knew he had changed, in a lot of ways, and most certainly for the better. But there were things that had not changed, and among them, this:
He woke on his bed fully dressed and wishing he had some hangover cure. Although he probably deserved this.
Potter turned away, and Draco followed him across the classroom to the door. The lock on it was a secret one that Draco had invented himself, knowing how students liked to pilfer ingredients. He slipped the lock with a non-verbal incantation and a jab of his wand, and opened the door.
Draco thought for a long time. About long lazy afternoons stretched out on the bed. Harry submitting so sweetly to him. Or holding him down, fucking him until Draco could barely speak. Evenings on the couch in front of the fireplace, talking about nothing of any consequence. Playing stupid Muggle board games (snakes and ladders? Was that supposed to be funny) when Harry suddenly remembered where he’d seen one. Beating Harry at chess, over and over and over again because Harry was all flash and strength and no strategy.
Draco seemed to bristle at that. He closed his eyes, and took a deep breath. And another, and another. When he opened his eyes, he looked relatively peaceful again. Calmer, at least.
“This is your home,” she said, very simply. “I think it’s good that you want to stay here. And you should come and go from my home as you please.”
Ron and Harry looked at each other, and Harry felt a thrill of genuine excitement for the first time in months. He had a house; it was not in good repair, and he certainly didn’t think he could spend the rest of his life there, but it would be a good and useful thing to do for now.
The long dining table. Once, Lucius had sat at one end, and Narcissa at the other. Draco in the middle, miles from either of them. Now, he and his mother crowded one end so they could talk. And talk she did.
“Usually. It’s been strange not wearing it as much, the last few months. There are people who know who I am. Professor Piedemonte. A couple of others. He’s not interested in who was on the wrong side of the war. Only in what people do now. It’s refreshing. I still think I’d probably be on the receiving end of an entrails-expelling curse if I showed my face in Diagon Alley anytime in the next century or two.”
And there was Potter. Not pushing forty, as they both were. Perhaps thirty. Stretched out on the sofa, asleep, in this beautiful home that was nothing like the reality. Potter opened his eyes, and smiled, and stretched, with an expression on his face that was so fond that Draco felt something inside him break.
“Is this outfit of yours all in one piece?” Harry growled back. “Or is it finished with a sticking charm of some sort? There’s
Draco spent the day catching up on other things, and occasionally checking to see if Harry had made any further progress towards waking up. He Owled Hermione Granger to tell her that Harry was awake while politely swearing to break both of her legs if she came to see him before Draco had given his permission. He notified essential hospital staff of Harry’s condition and since he was on a roll with the threats, he promised to break all of
Hermione’s expression was unlike any that he’d ever seen on her face. Honoured, and tired, and grateful, and in pain. The glorious tapestry of being human. He didn’t regret that he’d said things that hurt her to hear and that seemed like an incredible breakthrough all on its own.
“I won’t,” Harry said, catching the cups in midair and easing them down onto the table; they seemed eager to participate, and it took a moment and a gentle stroke to calm them down enough to pour the tea. “I think we can all agree that I’ve had a good long rest. I’m eager to catch up on the progress of the Department.”
Harry lost track of the time. He often did. Outside in Diagon Alley the rain fell heavily, and the thunder clapped, and lightning made the street as bright as day for a moment at a time. The dragon who had given her heartstring for this wand was pleased by it.
Draco straddled Harry’s hips, and leaned down until their faces were close. Close enough to kiss, but he didn’t, not yet, even when Harry licked his lips in anticipation.
“So then, one day last year as the weather was getting colder, I… I needed a day off. I don’t know how long it had been since I’d really had one. Probably back when I’d been sneaking a Portkey all the way to Italy when I had time. Perhaps sometimes I had a day where I wasn’t as busy and I could finally get around to doing things I’d promised other people I would do, but not… a day
“Your finest garb, I see.” Draco gestured at a comfortable armchair by the fireplace. Potter looked momentarily embarrassed by his Muggle clothes, but too tired to care all that much. “What on earth are those? On your feet?”
“Oh, good. You blame yourself, Harry doubtless blames himself, I’m sure even Ron has found a way to make it all his fault. A little self-centred, I think.”
“We should do this again.” This time, Harry met his eyes, and the hopeful slant to his chin made Draco want to step closer, bury his face in the crook of Harry’s neck. Or possibly wade into the lake and hope to be eaten by the giant squid. One or the other.
like that. It was exactly like that. He was mad about Draco Malfoy, and though he sincerely doubted that the feeling was mutual, he wondered now if there was a reason that Draco had shown up at his shop. His home. How had he even known where… anyway —
He was no less a part of the family, though Molly did occasionally lament that they would have had the most
Draco raised an eyebrow and looked pointedly at his shaking hands. “So I see.” He sighed. “Alright, let’s try something more specific. Any muscle weakness?”
He tried to ignore Harry as he hesitated over the envelope. It felt like being students again. Watching Harry, trying to guess what Harry was thinking or planning to do, trying to interpret his body language. Until someone (usually Pansy) cast
“I can’t,” she said, now, miserably. “I can’t. Look how it bubbles, Professor Malfoy. It will splash me.”
Luna tugged him closer to the stream, and steered him towards a large rock that had apparently been soaking up the sun all day. They sat in silence for a while as the sunset pinked up the water, and Harry was amused to see the way fish, butterflies, and even a couple of birds drew near. Of course, this was Luna.
“There’s one idea,” he said. “It’s mental, but… remember the Chamber of Secrets? When we went down there. There were passages in the back. Where the Basilisk hid. You remember?”
Blaise held his gaze, waiting for him to continue. Draco was finished, though, mouth set in a firm line until he raised his glass to his lips and almost drained it.
It had been over a week since Draco had appeared at breakfast; and for dinner, he was so painfully polite and distant that Harry wanted to shake him. But he didn’t. Instead he was just as polite, and just as distant. Draco attended Duelling Club but never stayed to chat afterwards. He didn’t invite himself to Harry’s quarters to drink his tea and drape himself invitingly on the furniture.
“If you repeat one single word of this to anyone, I’ll hex you,” Draco growled ineffectually. Neville didn’t look concerned. “No, I’ll poison everything in the greenhouse and set all your Mandrake roots free.”
Draco disenchanted his window and looked out not into the fake starlit sky, but the lake. Glowing an eerie green, seahorses galloping their way across nothing at all, manes and tails flying out behind them. He heard the low sound of the giant squid somewhere in the distance — when it displaced enough water, there was a sound almost like a trumpet in the lake. Draco sat on the windowsill and looked out into the murky depths for a long time, trying not to think about it.
Draco turned around, something of the old nervous teenager on his face again, biting his lip, unsure what to do, where to put his hands. He slipped the robe off and hung it on a coat-hook next to the fireplace.
“You should have told me,” she said, dropping the paper bag on the counter and crossing her arms. No one that diminutive should have been able to look so threatening.
“I hope you didn’t have to listen to all of that. He’s not that bad, really. Just persistent. I don’t know when I realised my late twenties had become my… very,
Draco was quiet. Hermione wished he would ask more questions; she could feel the way a realisation she had been trying to avoid was beginning to well up in her chest.
“I am,” Ollivander said. “You can start as soon as you like. I have a great deal to teach you.” He coughed into a handkerchief, and it took him long moments to calm his breathing again. “And I don’t believe I have all that much time to do so.”
“But I missed him, you see. And those times I managed to scratch out a few hours or a couple of days for myself, without work, without the Ministry, without my charity events — suddenly, I hated those hours. With nothing to do, I… you know, I’ve never had much of an imagination. And I didn’t have much experience with relationships, not really. But sometimes, when I couldn’t sleep, or when I had a couple of hours to myself, I started to imagine what it would be like. If I’d been able to summon up the courage to go to him after the war and offer my hand in friendship, the way he had done so long ago. Or if I had found a way to let him stay in England without fear for his life. I couldn’t do any of that, though; so we became friends in my mind. And I started incorporating all the things I had learned about him, letting us both grow up in my burgeoning imagination. How he looked when he was being so incredibly gentle with a patient, or pausing out the front of the hospital to collect a couple of flowers. How he could be cutting and funny but also tender, and full of love. All of that, I took it, and I imagined…”
According to the roster which Hermione had made and stuck to the pantry door, it was her turn to cook. But seeing as Harry suddenly had the afternoon off — and would begin his apprenticeship the following morning as soon as he had told the DMLE that he wouldn’t be continuing his Auror training — he though he might do it himself. He hummed tunelessly along with the wireless and smiled as he chopped vegetables, pausing from time to time to pop a piece of something small and delicious into his mouth, or to reach into his pocket to reassure himself that the heavy iron key Ollivander had given him was still there.
“On second thought, it’s probably simpler to simply Owl for them. Leave your supplies to the students. Goodnight, Malf… Prof…”
“You underestimate the DMLE. You'd be surprised at what they've managed without him. And you work very hard yourself, Hermione,” Blaise said, reaching to take her hand, but she wasn’t in the mood to be reassured.
It really did feel incredibly European, lounging naked in bed eating tiny pieces of meat and cheese and sipping wine (Harry was almost beginning to get an appreciation for the stuff, after a few months back in Hermione’s company).
He wrapped a heavy robe around himself and descended the stairs in the pre-dawn dark. He was surprised to find Draco wide awake, staring out the window with wonder in his eyes.
“Why did he do it, Blaise? It was a house, a… I know it was alive. How could he kill it? All those Pureblood things…”
“I think I might be having a terrible allergic reaction to the universe,” Harry told Neville, strangled.
“Romantic tosh,” Draco said happily. “Don’t think for a second you’re shagging me on the couch, Harry Potter. Stairs. Now.”
Hermione shrugged uncomfortably. “To tell you the truth, he’s never shown much interest in sex at all,” she said.
The morning was cold, and crisp, and the dawn was barely kissing the sky, when Draco mounted his broom and pushed off into the air.
“Of course not!” Draco’s expression was dark, stormy. Harry knew in that moment that he shouldn’t say another word. He looked away. “Listen,” Draco said. “I’m not an idiot. I’m also not a child. Umbridge — my father told me to get on her side, and I came by my megalomaniacal tendencies honestly. And my eagerness for self-preservation.” He glanced at Harry’s left hand. The old, worn, white scars still read
Hermione’s eyes brightened wetly for a moment. “Put them with Buckbeak’s feathers,” she said, and turned her attention back to her noodles.
He needn’t have worried. When Harry was in a good mood he was charming enough, and he was too Gryffindorish to be intimidated by this lot. Narcissa kept the conversation light, appropriate for the holiday, rolling her eyes if things became political, drawing the ladies into speculation about the fashion directions likely to reveal themselves at the New Year’s Eve celebrations the following week. The food was outstanding, and Harry’s hand didn’t curl around his plate once.
“Of course,” Harry said. “And we’re not at war, Draco. This needs to be challenging, and fun, not frightening.” He sat quietly for a few long, drawn out moments. “You care about them, don’t you. The children.”
“Nothing of any consequence. I would be a friendly stranger, sit with him in a bar and ask about his day. Or a gardener trimming hedges at hospital, offering potions ingredients I had gathered along the way. I don’t know what I was looking for. Maybe at first I told myself I wanted to know if it was an act. But I already knew it wasn’t, I’d seen enough for that. After a while, I went just because… because I wanted to
Harry sat back in his armchair and clasped his hands in his lap. Ron was right. He’d never noticed, but Ron was right.
There would be time for proper lube in a little while. Not yet. Harry’s pupils got even wider and darker as he fellated Draco’s finger.
“I have something else for you,” Draco said. Harry wanted to sink into the carpet. This gift was far too much all by itself, even worse compared to his own. He wanted to argue, but he’d learned enough about Pureblood etiquette — even the simple Wizard courtesies — to know to keep his stupid trap shut. He swallowed hard.
Draco raised the wand, and seemed to take a moment to settle himself. He straightened his back, tipped his chin back, took a moment to recall a memory — and then he cast.
“I think my bollocks have crawled back up, I’m so cold,” Draco said. He was glad he’d remembered gloves, but his fingers still felt as if they might be frozen to the broom.
“You are much too pleased with yourself,” he complained, with a twirl of spaghetti cooling on the end of his fork. “It’s terribly annoying, Potter.”
Draco spent a long morning with his patients. He was grateful for the Glamour; he was beyond exhausted and beyond worried. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d slept without slipping into Harry’s head. And Harry’s health was fading.
Draco’s expression was difficult to interpret, but if Harry had to put a galleon on it he might have said that it was the expression of a person who knew he had no right to be hurt, but was nonetheless hurt. He had offered his hospitality. Harry would be a monster to refuse it.
It seemed to take a very long time for the cauldron to fall, which did give Draco enough time to Summon it slightly so it didn’t splash Amelia. That did, unfortunately, mean that it splashed all over his hands and over his trousers as well, some drops hitting his face.
Strange, though, how he was suddenly hungry for things that might make him smile like that. His mood lasted days, he was happier in classes, stopped worrying so much about getting it right and started running his lessons a little looser. The children laughed, he laughed, and his third year class, some of whom were utterly terrified of Boggarts, had a wonderful time turning one into things that made them roll about in helpless laughter. He was having fun. He
Whatever wandless, non-verbal spell Harry was using to cool the blistered skin was working beautifully. The careful gestures would have been spellbinding even without Harry’s determined expression, but Draco watched him carefully, eyes flickering between his hands and his face, and wondered when he’d become ‘Harry’ again.
“Wouldn’t you like to know,” Draco replied, sneering. “I won’t explain it, you’re altogether too stupid to understand the intricacies of a Slytherin plan.”
“Er,” Harry said. Really, he should have grown out of that by now. No, he should never have been allowed to grow into it. Those rotten Muggles. “Define a lot?” And then he shook his head. “I’m only supposed to receive post from people I know personally. Sometimes something slips past, though.” He looked embarrassed, despite his good-natured barbs. “It’s fine.”
“One day I hope you get past the whole idea that everything is about owing someone. Look, they’ll leave, if I ask them to. You’re bound to be asked a thousand difficult questions, and…”
“This was my fault,” she said, with a sigh. “I worked him too hard. I let others work him too hard. I didn’t see the signs, I… I’ve spent the last several months carefully cataloguing everything that I’ve ever done wrong where Harry is concerned and it is a very long list. I want to tell him to leave the DMLE and, I don’t know, become a baker, or — become nothing, spend his days lazing in the sun or something but the entire Department is a mess without him.”
Draco edged nearer. An inch, two, five. A foot. And then close enough to brush his fingers over Harry’s side and make him shiver.
Draco flipped an hourglass and looked balefully at Potter. “It will be. Your suspiciousness really is not your most endearing trait, Potter.” He took off his robes, and hung them on a coat hook near the door. Underneath, he wore a pair of silk trousers in a pale grey with a matching waistcoat, and a pale blue shirt. He loosen the tie, blue again if a darker shade, and enjoyed the furtive look Potter gave him. Potter hesitated, and followed suit, hanging his robe alongside Draco’s. It was very warm in the room. Draco folded his sleeves up to his elbows, and nodded pointedly at Potter.
“Yes. But not at the expense of everything else. We’re not heartless. Harry’s my friend. Auror or not, he’s my friend.” Blaise’s expression was severe and serious and Draco believed him.
She handed him an envelope. She handed it over with such gravity that Harry felt his bones harden and his eyes widen. He recognised the handwriting on the front, though he couldn’t place it, and when he turned it over to see the seal on the back — the heavy, ornate ‘H’ set into the wax — his heart thumped in his chest.
“I’d forgotten what it’s like,” he said. He didn’t turn to look at Harry, he just stared. Of course, a rock guitarist — or whatever it was that Draco referred to himself as — probably didn’t bother with Christmas decorations. Harry walked silently past the counter and stood by Draco.
He pulled his own gift out of the air, realising too late that it meant that he had summoned it through several walls, wandlessly and without a word. Draco seemed to have become accustomed, though. He held Harry’s eyes for a long moment, and then unwrapped the gift. It was a book. A small book, a
Late that Friday night, as he lay in bed, wondering when sleep might come, he found his gaze drawn to his broom.
“It was Tom Riddle’s fault. They know that.” Harry shifted, back to the window, facing the shop counter with his elbows on his knees. “You lost a lot as well.”
Harry felt something ugly coil in his heart. He pointed to a photograph of himself and Ron and Hermione, in a small frame on the desk. He had a few others, but they all hurt too much to display. The Order of the Phoenix in 1981, his mother’s softly curved belly and Sirius’s proud smile. He was barely able to look at them, the way they reminded him of everything he had lost.
Potter looked as if he had something to say to that, but in the end, he shrugged and returned to his breakfast. His arm was curved around the plate again, but he seemed to notice Draco noticing, and pulled it back a little.
“Humble,” Blaise exclaimed, glancing Heavenward. “Alright. I wouldn’t even be here, if you’d gone to Naples weeks ago the way you know you should have. You’re not waiting, any more. You haven’t bee for a while. You’re
of it, so very much, and still he couldn’t understand it. The soft couch and the beautiful curtains that surrounded his bed, the rug that felt like the softest, densest fur under his feet (and did occasionally almost seem to purr).
felt when he focused all of that attention on them. But I didn’t think he could ever trust me. Not as
Some of them were big and obvious; he and his mother were free to disavow his actions, and as much as Narcissa had loved Lucius she had hated him, too, especially towards the end. Draco didn’t hate to come home, anymore, even though the walls held memories of things that could never be scrubbed clean.
It really wasn’t; even Draco knew enough to know that sort of thing really wasn’t okay. He knew instinctively that saying anything of the sort would either turn Harry mulish or send him hiding. Best to stick with what he knew; being, as the saying went,
nice; Draco had put some real effort in, the first year, nudging walls here and there, expanding bookshelves and carefully selecting wallpaper and carpet. The window, as large as it was, looking out over a starry sky, was entirely artificial but no less beautiful for all of that, and there was always the scent of nutmeg and cinnamon in the fire. Mother had helped, of course; there wasn’t a witch in England with her style, and as complicated as their relationship could be at times, Draco had enjoyed having a project for them to work on together.
“Oh,” Hermione said. For a moment there was a fuzziness in her eyes that Harry recognised, the threat of being pulled back into that nightmare. “Thank you, Malfoy.”
Harry grinned, and shook his head. “You’re a big softie, Draco Malfoy. But how did you get her to accept it? Kreacher gets so cross — I have to keep Hermione away from him, he’s sick of being lectured about servitude. I got him to accept some old blankets, but if I try to pay him or give him clothes he goes into a right snit.”
He conjured images of Ginny in his mind, trying to remember what it was like to want soft curves in his hands, and all he could imagine was a hard body, slim and tall and taut, wiry blond hair in tight curls around a prick he could only assume was as gorgeous as —
“Thank you for,” he said, gesturing at the curse box, and the phial full of filthy, greasy magic. “I didn’t mean to be rude about your room.”
Draco set the cup on the table. Not a teacup, actually, it was a mug, and it wasn’t full, which could only mean that Draco had seen how his hands shook. It was very strange, seeing Draco Malfoy behaving in a way that was so acutely considerate and careful. Or perhaps not. Perhaps it was only that Harry hadn’t seen that gentle care turned on himself in this way. Not outside of…
Draco had opened a drawer, and he was staring into it, looking almost green (the effect of someone almost paper white actually getting paler) and strangely perturbed. After a long moment, he shrugged, and withdrew a small package wrapped in gold paper with a big white ribbon.
“I perfected my… Muggles call it ‘gaydar’ but I don’t really know why. But I perfected that the year after my father died, when I was busy being famously terrible in the papers. So I don’t think I got that wrong.”
“I’ll marry you, then,” she said. “Since you asked so nicely. Just don’t imagine I’ll be changing my name.” She settled between Blaise’s knees and he took her hand, carefully sliding the ring over her finger until it settled like a promise.
Topher looked around the room. He looked less like he was trying to find something than like he was taking measure of this and that, but what Ron didn’t know about psychiatrists… he didn’t want to ask, or disturb. He just wanted Harry back.
Everyone was wearing freshly knitted Weasley jumpers in a riot of colours. Apparently Molly had grown weary of sticking with house colours. Victoire was decked out in yellow, pink, and aquamarine; Teddy in purple and lime green.
Draco closed his hand over Luc’s wrist, stopping him before his fingertips could curl into the waistband of Draco’s trousers.
He took a breath. He didn’t like the way his tongue was tripping him up. He acknowledged his irritation with himself, though, and then he let it go. Dwelling wouldn’t help.
Harry snorted. “Yeah. First time I went to the Burrow, the summer after first year, I felt the same. Everyone happy and shouting… I didn’t know families could be like that.”
He glanced at Draco as he said it, and immediately wished he hadn’t. Draco had so many regrets. He offered up a weak smile, and Draco adjusted his stance. Harry waved in the direction of the chalkboard.
“Do you think,” Draco said, his expression torn, “that we should — I don’t know, make a pot of tea? Talk a while?”
“That’s what —” Hermione bit her lip, heart racing. Hadn’t Draco used almost those precise words? “No, I know. And when we get him back, things are going to be different, Gin.”
It took two days to make the arrangements for Potter’s hospital room to be attached to Draco’s office. This sort of work would mean long days, even if he did spend a significant portion of them sleeping, in between treating his other patients and no doubt responding to more enquiries than anyone should have to as regards Harry’s condition.
Harry took a breath. No one had asked him this. Not yet. He’d been dreading the moment it would happen.
Hermione was struggling to find something to say in reply, and then it was too late. Harry was gone.
“I haven’t, much.” Harry joined Draco on the couch, sitting near his bare feet, long and pale with a dusting of gold hair. “I suppose I’ve slept enough for about a year.”
But he didn’t bother; he was about done repeatedly stabbing himself in the heart. Draco was a terrible glutton for punishment, these days, but he did have his limits.
“Seekers do it better. At least according to Derrick.” Harry’s face burned. Draco rather enjoyed it; Harry had a number of rather excellent looks, but squirming in discomfort about his sexual history was one that Draco thought he’d like to provoke more often.
“Don’t kink-shame the happy couple,” Ginny said, tossing a cherry at Pansy’s face and dropping into the seat beside her.
Harry lifted a frame from his desk, and turned around, resting against it. He made a small, impatient gesture which made Draco’s heart flop suddenly, and Draco cautiously approached him, shifting alongside and leaning against the edge of the desk, peering over Harry’s shoulder.
“Harry Potter, cursed as he was with a conscience, a destiny, and far too much responsibility for any one person to bear, had less choice than any of us.”
“I’ll do it, if you like,” Harry said, following him out the back. It wasn’t the main kitchen, just a tiny table, a kettle, and a small pantry full of tea and biscuits. Ollivander didn’t answer, but he sat gratefully at the table and watched as Harry made tea, coughing lightly from time to time. “I hear you’ve been ill. I’m very sorry to hear it. If there’s anything I can do —”
“I’d tell him I’m sorry I violated his privacy,” Harry said. “And I’d ask him not to hate me for it — because he’s so much a part of me now that I couldn’t stand it.” Harry’s expression softened just barely and his eyes searched Draco’s face, twice flicking to his mouth.
Draco didn’t ask if he was thinking of the moment he’d disapparated from the bloody balcony of bloody Malfoy Manor to avoid being kissed. He felt inordinately proud of his restraint.
Blaise Zabini was a dedicated professional who managed to holiday with his famous girlfriend every year.
“We need a table,” Draco said, and he marched to the kitchen without looking up, unrolling the map as he went. He Scourgified the table while Hermione did the lights, and they bent over the map.
. Draco cringed. There had never been a Malfoy, nor a Black, who had a particular respect for the privacy of others, but she had found Harry’s other photographs and framed them. Harry seemed to be spellbound, and only the sudden tremor in his shoulders told Draco that he was choking back a sob.
“Come in,” Harry said, without looking up. When the large, distinguished form of Delilah Shacklebolt came through the door he was instantly alert and on his feet. “Madam,” he said. “I apologise. I didn’t expect to see anyone this late.” He tried in vain to press his hair into submission but it rebelled with all the passion it could muster. She shooed his concern away.
Harry’s lips brushed over Draco’s hair. “You didn’t. I shared it. Not on purpose, but… I suppose it was just… a magical night,” he said quietly.
“Draco,” Harry said, yawning and stretching. He was careful to shift on the couch in just the way that would make his jumper ride up at his hip, exposing a little skin. “There you are. Missed you.”
“I have ideas,” he corrected. “I might have the very beginnings of plans.” He smiled to himself. “I’m not ready to share them. I hope that’s okay.”
It was hot in the club but Harry felt suddenly cold. Very, very cold. Gooseflesh rose on the back of his neck and his arms, and his mouth went dry. He swallowed the rest of his pint in a couple of mouthfuls and turned to order another one, but somehow, turning away from Draco was damn near impossible to do. So he didn’t bother, just stood leaning against the edge of the bar and watching.
“See you at breakfast,” Harry called, waving absently as he headed in the direction of his quarters.
“You’re just a man, Harry. You’ve achieved extraordinary things, but you’re just a man. Nothing more should be expected of you than of anyone else. It’s time this was over.”
“I’ve tried to free him. If I offer him clothes he runs away and sulks for weeks. I’m barely here — he keeps it clean, mutters about his Mistress… I’ll ask him if he wants to come with me, but I expect he’ll just insist on staying here. He’s over three hundred years old, Hermione, he’s not about to change his ways. But... every year he takes flowers to Dobby’s grave. I expect that’s the most character growth I’ll ever see. And honestly — that seems like a lot.”
Harry spent a long time, that night, exploring his own home. He wasn’t sure he really needed to. He knew it — he had designed it, mapped it out, and this was a very faithful reconstruction of the way that it had been in his head. And best of all, the house was happy to see him. He wasn’t sure he would ever get used to the idea of having three house-elves, but he couldn’t deny that they seemed pleased with themselves. He would have to ban them from punishing themselves — no house-elf was going to iron their ears under Harry’s employ — but for now, he was content to be grateful to them.
“Harry?” he called, louder this time. He stepped around an ancient-looking mausoleum and into a sort of clearing, with an enormous cauldron in the centre. Wisps of smoke from a long-dead fire vanished into the breeze.
After lunch, Andromeda did her best to squeeze recipes out of Molly for things picky children might be convinced to eat, as Teddy had recently stopped eating everything that was put in front of him. Molly did her best, but as all seven Weasley children had been very easy to feed, she had little advice.
All of these things needed to be true. They had to be, because his father was infallible. And if his father wasn’t infallible, then Draco was in much worse trouble than he’d feared. He leaned over the sink, and draped his tie over his shoulder; he was going to throw up what little there was in his stomach. Katie Bell was a twit, but she hadn’t deserved…
They were settled back into their armchairs a moment later, Harry staring into the flames and Draco pretending not to stare at Harry.
The thought of Ron and Hermione moving away to their new house near the Burrow set off all sorts of contradictory feelings, when he let himself think about it at all. He had loved living with them so long, but he knew that after the wedding in February they would want time to be alone. Meanwhile, the shop was starting to feel more like
“Hermione,” he said, with a warning in his voice. “I don’t think it’s safe, here; I don’t think this is real.”
Hermione poured herself a glass of dandelion wine (Harry knew she didn’t generally enjoy it much but this particular wine was flavoured with raspberries, and she seemed to like it) and fretted around the kitchen counter. Harry, on the other hand, felt supremely calm.
“Professor Sprout says I’m a natural at it,” Neville said, blushing proudly. “The Herbology part and the teaching part both. You don’t think she’d say that just to make me feel better, do you, Harry?”
He felt a smile curl his features. He didn’t really need to do anything but watch, now, and be ready to steer when steering was needed. If it was needed. And in the moment he made that decision, he felt everything warm a little more. His robes, his skin, the tattooed marks over the backs of his hands and his shoulders, his ribs, all the marks that helped him to ease into the most curious of conundrums, seeking answers to the deepest mysteries, unraveling labyrinths and seeing into the souls of things.
“No,” Harry said. He looked at his shoes. They were not the sort of shoes that worked in Malfoy Manor. He wished he’d polished them.
“Well, I am. And I’m a disaster, and the Dark Mark will never really go away, no matter how I mutilate it. He’s the hero of the Wizarding world, and I’m an ex-Death Eater. And one,” he added, noticing the clock above the hearth, “who needs to head back to the castle and get some sleep.”
“You’re beautiful, you know,” Draco said, and Harry murmured some sort of objection, the skin around his eyes going tight. “No, don’t argue. You’re beautiful. It makes me — it makes me want to take care of you.” Draco felt his throat tighten. That hadn’t been exactly what he intended to say, but there it was. He tipped Harry’s face away so he could get at his neck, that pale skin, unscarred. Harry as he wanted to be. How had he not thought about that before?
He managed to sidle in amongst a group of good-looking Muggles about his own age. He was filing away details of their outfits — costumes, really — those two were definitely writing novels, these two were doing art they described as edgy and subversive and that involved gluing a lot of doll parts together.
She didn’t have a name, yet. Or rather, the Shopkeeper at the Magical Menagerie said her name was Lenore, and she was much too goofy for a name that sophisticated. She was a lovely tawny thing with enormous eyes which were very, very expressive, even for an owl.
They found their way to simpler topics, and Hermione slept in the spare room. She didn’t like being alone, when Ron was away.
“I think he would have been a good deal happier had you stayed,” Mrs Malfoy said, quietly. “Perhaps growing up with Muggles taught you some sort of prejudice…”
“He saved my life just as sure as anyone else’s. We’ve worked closely together at times, and Draco, he’s as good as they say and then some.”
Harry startled briefly as Crookshanks leapt up on the couch alongside him. “Hello, you,” he said, scratching deep into his fur. “I have to tell you about my day, Hermione. I met these cats…”
Harry dropped onto the couch as if he had been waiting to fall over since he’d first stood up. Hermione sat beside him, smoothing down her robes and forcing a smile.
The owl hooted gently, and then took off, disappearing through a window that Draco would have sworn had been closed.
They didn’t allow each other advantages; everything was a vicious battle of wills and joy and the students kept up cries of support. Harry and Draco kept their eyes locked on each other and Harry wondered a hundred times if his eyes were as bright as Draco’s.
“My wank fantasies never involved all this worryingly clean dirty talk.” And then he let out a needy cry, as Harry shifted far enough to lick the tip of his cock and then swirl his tongue around the head. “You fucking
Harry didn’t have an answer for that. For any of it. For a moment last night he’d thought maybe Draco had come because he wanted to be in Harry’s life, because he’d seen something there that he wanted. That like Harry himself he’d eventually started wondering if all of those years of mutual obsession and pigtail-pulling had been a veneer. He’d wondered if they might have another chance, if the help Harry had failed to offer Draco when they were sixteen years old and the world was on fire might be something he could offer now.
“I might have just the thing,” he said, waving at one of the upper shelves until a long silver box floated demurely into his hand. He removed the wand, and handed it to Daisy.
year. I told them there was no way to let anyone in, and for some reason, they believed me. Meant I could escape.”
“Trust me,” he said. “Hangover cure. Best in the business. You’ll wish you were dead, for about thirty seconds, and then you’ll be fresh as a daisy — except you’ll stink, and you’ll need a good long shower.”
“Your father was not a happy man,” she reminded him gently. “I don’t want that for you. And he didn’t have his emotions under control as much as you think. He gave in too easily to the wrong ones, mind you. Certainly I never saw him laugh until his sides ached.”
“Molly,” he said, when a familiar face came into sight. “Mr Ollivander passed away in the night. I think I need your help.”
Harry stepped closer still. His face was wary, but he had slipped his wand back into his robes seemingly without thought.
Draco looked sad, and there was no sad in this house. No thinking about work. Just love, every kind.
“Topher,” said Luc, brushing ash from his leather pants. “I cannot believe you locked me out of your Floo.” He pouted for a moment, but his attention span was as short as his t-shirt was tight and soon he was stepping uncomfortably close. “We’re going dancing in Rome. Come with.”
“How do they do it? How have thousands of parents — every year! — Just, goodbye, we’ll see you at Christmas. And now he has his Sorting, and what if he’s afraid?” Harry and Andromeda looked at each other a moment and then forced themselves to stop. After weeks of the two of them being upset at the idea of Teddy heading off for his first year and Draco declaring them both utterly pathetic, here he was with his nose running.
,” he corrected. “There was a bathroom, in the dream. At least I think it was a bathroom. It was enormous, though. And there was a snake. Huge! D’you have any idea what that might have been about? Is he afraid of snakes?”
Neville beamed at Harry. “It really is,” he said. “G’night, Harry. G’night, Draco. Cheers for that.”
“I won’t leave,” he promised Draco’s now-closed eyes, in case he was still awake, or semi-conscious. He pressed a warm hand to Draco’s cold cheek. “I’m right here.”
“There’s no Firewhi— oh,” Potter said, when a bottle and two glasses came to rest at the end of Draco’s personal work-bench.
The band appeared as the lights went out, to be replaced by the typical strobing, flashing, colourful mess, and the lead singer (who had to be the focus of Lucas’s lusty gaze — well, fuck it, plenty of fit bodies in here tonight) grabbed the microphone, bringing it close to his face.
“I should go; I’ve taken up far too much of your time. Please, I can see myself out,” he said. “I wanted to apologise, that’s all. I didn’t mean to stir all of this up.” He stood awkwardly, and Mrs Malfoy stood as well. Harry’s desire to be elsewhere was so strong that for a moment he fancied he was going to disapparate by accident again. Merlin, but he needed to work on his involuntary magic.
. It was surprisingly comfortable and while far from shabby, it was worlds away from the cool, threatening air of the rest of the manor. Harry felt at home immediately. And he really, really wished he didn’t. This room was like Draco’s rooms in the castle, he realised. He’d never quite noticed before that although the furniture was of good quality, it was also comfortable.
“Alright,” he called, hurrying now. He pictured Ron, hurt. Hermione, afraid. Andromeda, suddenly trapped with a four-year-old werewolf. He hurtled down the stairs, shivering, and stopped short at the front door. The blinds were closed from the inside.
“I’ve given a lot. My entire life, I’ve given a great deal. As the Boy Who Lived, and then as the Chosen One, and then — well, as an Auror. I’ve given a lot. I feel…”
Blaise had learned very early in his career that there was nothing more important than thinking. Making sure he had the time and space to think. Prioritising time spent in deep thought.
“I… think you’ve passed. No more interrogations. And now,” she said, carefully, “what is it that you’re waiting for? To go — to go back to Draco?”
“Certainly not. We have more class than that. Imagine a nice dinner somewhere. Pansy knows all the best restaurateurs in Dublin. Muggle and Wizard alike.”
She had a lot on her tray, and Harry had to remind himself that House-elves were enormously strong. He took a butterbeer, and then thinking at the last moment took the firewhiskey as well, knocking it back and returning the glass with a wink.
He brought his wand down close to Harry’s face and checked that his pupils were still responsive to the soft
What possessed him to do it, Draco would never know — but he reached across Harry’s back, and settled a hand on his shoulder, and gave a small squeeze. Harry either barely noticed, or (and this was what Draco hoped for) didn’t mind. Maybe liked it.
He hurried back to his room, careful to look like he was not hurrying at all. Once in the privacy of his classroom, he opened the letter.
The light had almost disappeared, now, but what was left of it painted the walls a soft tangerine colour which was rather fetching. Draco had a powerful urge to kiss it off Harry’s face, but they weren’t finished, not yet. Tired, perhaps. Harry let his gaze drift out the window.
Whether he was lying, or genuinely couldn’t tell when he was keeping things from himself, Hermione didn’t know. But she smiled weakly at him, and they set about searching the house.
He spent a long time at the edge of the lake, feeding the ducks. There were three or four that always made a point of coming close enough to be petted, their lovely long necks stretching out in the sun. He named them. He never remembered the names. He named them again every time.
“You’re still a bloody brilliant flyer,” Harry said, turning back to Draco. Draco hoped the flush of his cheeks could be attributed to the warming charm, and not the sudden rush of want. He hunted around for an insult, something that would make Harry laugh, but when he opened his mouth, what came out was “Not too bad yourself. For a Gryffindor.”
“It’s that time of the year, you know,” he said, looking out the window into the stormy streets. “Summer storms, and then… children from all over Europe will come to our store looking for their very first wands. I’ll finally be able to teach you.”
“Well, I’ll call my tailor in,” Draco said, like the enormous poncy git he was. He was smiling, though, and bumped Harry’s leg with his knee, under the table.
“Harry’s worst memory. Worse than the people he’s lost, the people he saw die. Worse than dying himself. Something he did that made him see himself in a completely different light. Something he has so much shame about that he’s never spoken of it again.”
“Once I was at Hogwarts, I found a new family. I didn’t need you to know about the old one. You knew I didn’t like being there; that was enough.”
“Please don’t hate me when you wake up,” he begged, quietly. “You’re so much a part of me now that I couldn’t bear it.”
“Harry,” Draco said, just as Harry thought he might drift off to sleep again. “There’s something I’d like to try, if you’re up for it.”
Hermione shook her head. “I didn’t. I… oh, I feel as if I should ask him back, but his little heart will break. What should I do?”
He felt almost dizzy. He’d loved duelling. He really had, and long before it had been a life or death skill. Take that, Hermione. Take that, Ron.
The anger presented itself. He acknowledged it, and let it go. He knew it had something important to tell him, but it wasn’t the time for him to listen to it. Not then.
“I know where to find you if I need more of that sort of colour commentary, Zabini. Much appreciated, et cetera. I don’t particularly care how good an Auror Potter is. My job is to figure out why he’s playing possum in the middle of his own psyche. But thank you for your pearls of wisdom. Who do I have to shag to get a decent cup of tea around here?”
In the third week of February, Ron and Hermione got married at the Burrow, protected from the gentle snow by warming charms and surrounded by everyone they loved. It was a simple ceremony. Hermione cried a little because she had never been able to bring herself to fetch her parents back, and she missed them, but Ginny and Luna and Fleur took good care of her, like the lovely obliging bridesmaids they were. Harry, Bill and Charlie were Ron’s groomsmen — Percy had his hands full with two small children and a tired-looking wife, which was fortunate, as Ron hadn’t really wanted to ask him. They were leaving their honeymoon until Hermione graduated in May and got ready to start her two-year legal internship.
He dabbed at his eyes with his napkin again. “Merlin, why did you make me snort that rubbish out of my nose? Now I…”
“I need a House-elf,” he said. One apparated with a loud crack, and squawked. “Get me Professor Potter.”
The days got longer, and warmer. Spring sprung, bringing with it flowers and new life, the promise of children coming home from Hogwarts for the summer, long days swimming at the shore. Ron and Hermione had talked about going on a holiday, and would he come with them? (Maybe. As long as it was early in the season, long before the children started shopping for wands.) Since January, Harry had been on four dates with very nice men, enjoyed their company and known right away that there was nothing more to it. He’d spent an additional four nights in Muggle London, intending each time to find someone fun to go home with, and each time, he’d gone home alone.
Harry frowned, and then understood. “What? No! No, it’s not — I couldn’t explain this to someone I knew, I certainly can’t make you understand. Why are we
There was a lot of chatter as the students moved around, some excited, some angry, all at least a little bit intrigued. A few students ended up sitting next to someone they well and truly loathed. Two boys in the middle of the classroom, one in Gryffindor robes and one in Slytherin sat with their chairs as far apart as they could manage it, looking murderously at Harry. The Slytherin boy had hair red enough so that he had to be related to the Weasleys one way or another, and the Gryffindor boy had skin such a dark black it shone under the candlelights.
“But Draco had a point. About the way I grew up. You know, he told me… a while after he found out about… well, Little Whingeing. We were in the sitting room at Twelve Grimmauld Place. Every pillow and cushion in the house was piled up in front of the hearth, and so were most of the blankets. He told me that when we’d first met, he expected me to have spent the first decade of my life being reminded how special I was, and how important, how I’d defeated the Dark Lord — his words, not mine — and that I’d be every bit the entitled brat that he was.
“Merlin’s arse,” Draco said, frowning and looking up. He was six feet tall himself; the history professor was being simply
Harry felt guilty, for a moment; the last few months he had seen less of his godson than he usually did. But Teddy appeared nothing but delighted to be in his arms, not grumpy or resentful, delightful child that he was, chatting animatedly about the kittens in the backyard at Twelve Grimmauld Place. Draco, unaware of Harry’s guests, threw the door open and began to descend the stairs, babbling about laundry before stopping to gape, his face purpling.
“No, really. Will you go and find a couple of bottles of wine? I need to talk to you both, and there’s garlic bread in the oven and risotto on the stove, and I think a nice bottle of celebratory white wine would be perfect. I promise not to let you get drunk.”
“I don’t know if he knows about the flowers,” Blaise said quietly, holding Hermione’s elbow as she picked her way across the space. “But the Malfoys never really got rid of anything, and there were old food stores and mattresses in one of the cellars. Far as I can tell, the mattresses were stuffed with grasses and seeds and once the enchantments were gone and everything started to fall apart, the seeds struck.”
There was a blotch at the beginning of the next line, as if Harry had spent a long time debating what else he could write, and had ultimately decided to sign off with just a
He looked over the map for a few more minutes. No way to know if he could choose one just yet, but he wanted to remember as much as he could about the rooms in the real house, so that he might be able to anticipate what the house in Harry’s mind might be concealing.
Draco flicked his wand, and the collection of gifts that Harry had brought in one of Molly’s carpet bags found their way under the tree. “Don’t be vulgar, Harry. I know you were raised by wolves, but half the point of gift-giving — at least amongst snobs like these — is to sneak them under the tree as subtly as possible, argue that they’re only a trifle, and then spend the next year complaining about how no one else spent as much money as you did. But I see you’ve been sensible — that looks like a tin of Molly Weasley’s biscuits, if I’m not mistaken. Wine…” He cocked his head.
There was a scuffle in the hallway, and Hermione looked up. Really, she didn’t have time for nonsense today; she had barely slept, and poorly at that, and she had a pile of work to do that was taller than her head. She stormed across her office and opened the door, already shouting for everyone please calm the fuck down and get on with the day.
Harry realised afterwards that he should not have dropped his guard, but he did. He had a moment to reflect on the unmistakable crunch of a broken nose as Draco punched him right in the middle of his face. By the time he had regained his balance, Draco was gone.
Harry shrugged helplessly. “I don’t know what to do,” he said. “I keep thinking I should call a Healer. Or Pansy. Or Blaise, I don’t know. Someone. He’s doing better than he was, but I still don’t know why he’s here, and I can’t help him except by… I don’t know. Food, shelter, clothes.”
Saturday night, Harry ate Chinese food at Grimmauld Place with Ron and Hermione. The two of them were going to see a movie, afterwards, enjoying the last few weeks before Ron sat his exams and became a fully qualified Auror, and his hours became much less predictable. Harry, on the other hand, was planning to hit Muggle London and find himself someone to waste an evening with.
He felt the warm brush of Harry’s magic before he opened the door, and closed his eyes, letting it warm him. Harry, apparently, was healthier than he had been in some time; the crackle and glow of that singular signature was unmistakable.
Draco indicated the settee, and took the armchair. “How are you feeling?” he asked, trying to keep calm.
“Famous Harry Potter, Saviour of the Wizarding World, a house-elf?” For a moment Draco sounded dismissive, and then his expression shifted to wariness. Harry could barely see it from the corner of his eye but it was there.
The following Saturday, Draco met his mother outside the school gates, where she had apparated with a chest full of Merlin knew what and this time, just two of her minions. Though it was still only early Autumn, the day was cool, and she was wearing one of her better fur-lined coats. Draco kissed her cheek, and took her arm, and led her into the castle.
“I don’t have one of my own,” he said, trying the note to the leg of a school owl. The little boy had an owl of his own, and Harry was surprised to notice it was an Australian Boobook owl.
Harry sat up. “Are you sure you’re alright? You haven’t been Obliviated? Not getting sick or anything? Day off, Draco. Day off! You’re not allowed to feel like shite on our day off.”
Harry’s fingers traced the curve of Draco’s cheek. “I can’t wake up to find you’ve gone without a word again.”
“Is there something you’d prefer?” Harry asked, quietly. Draco looked away from the tray, and shook his head. “You should try to eat a little. Or drink the juice, at least. The sugar might do you some good.”
“Just needed something to do with my hands,” Harry said, standing. He rested against the countertop and crossed his arms over his body. “Are you alright?”
. He had begged off his afternoon and eaten a large meal, so that the weekend’s berries and grains wouldn’t sap him too badly. He read over Hermione’s latest missive. There were photographs, this time, photographs of the house, with the walls the right colours and the floors freshly carpeted — better than that, the rooms that had been abandoned and walled off in Harry’s head were now fresh and clean and new. Sirius’s room would be indistinguishable from the way it had been when he was a surly, rebellious teenager. The horrible tapestry, full of burned holes were the faces of unsatisfactory family members had been scorched away, was fuller than ever; Harry was there, linked to Sirius, and Teddy’s young adult face was patrician and kind. There was also a photograph of Kreacher, Binks and Malinda, standing tall and proud. Binks and Malinda looked at each other every few moments, unable to believe they were employed in such an important house, and Kreacher gazed proudly at the camera.
“You don’t need a shower,” Harry said, shaking his head. “I’m just going to get you all sweaty again.”
Right now, she had three fingers of Dwarvish Scotch in a crystal tumbler for him. He smiled, and took the glass, and rubbed her head the way she liked. She preened, and wandered away, smoothing down the skirt of her pretty dress.
with. No strings, no stupid attachments, no garbage childhood resentments, no war — I have people I go out with and eat dinner with and get drunk with and sleep with and they know who I am. They haven’t created some kind of fucking…”
The bottle topped up both of their glasses, and Draco turned the potion in the cauldron seven times, with a silver knife, watching as it turned a shimmering silver.
“Ginevra Weasley, I can puke at will,” Pansy said, waggling a very drunken finger at Ginny’s face, before staring openly at her breasts. “Is it true you’re still letting your freak flag fly, Gin? You should come and stay with me and Greg sometime. All the whiskey you can drink.”
Sadly, Draco didn’t have a lot of confidence about that last one. Although, maybe he needed to prepare to let himself be surprised a little more often. He closed the paper, and looked at Harry’s expression on the front page. Calm. Confident. So fucking handsome that Draco’s chest ached and his cock twitched. Back to page three, and the photograph of Harry and Hermione embracing. She’d come a long way. Draco was impressed, not that he would have admitted it under threat of girl-Weasley’s famous bat-bogey hex.
“I’ll wait to hear about the arrangements, then, Minister,” he said, and with a nod to Blaise, he took his leave, anger thrumming behind his breastbone.
“I haven’t asked you yet,” Harry answered, drily. “I’ll get the curry. You can eat or not, it’s up to you. I thought you might need a wand.” He gestured at the boxes with his free hand. “I remember the resonance of your —”
“Before… well, the Owls, and Hagrid, and finding out that I was a Wizard, I wanted — I needed magic to be real. It was an escape. And I could borrow from the library, because it didn’t cost any money and they couldn’t… couldn’t
“And then there’s my third theory, which is just that you had a shit childhood living in a cupboard and eating whatever leftovers you were allowed, and then spent seven years being treated like a weapon, like a living fucking sacrifice to save the world — a job which I assume you didn’t think you’d survive. And then you joined the Aurors where you worked eighty hours a week. And you have no fucking clue what you’re doing, and you assume you’ll fuck it up.”
He pulled an envelope from his pocket. “This is the specifications for the renovations, once the house is clean. Paint colours, carpet, everything. Just give it to Kreacher. He’ll take care of the rest, and he’ll make sure it’s done perfectly. And for the love of all that is Harry, Granger — Kreacher is too old to be alone. I know it hurts your sensibilities to hear this but this is an ancient Wizarding house, and it needs at least three house-elves to keep it in state. They like having the responsibility of a home. Stop inflicting your ghastly white human feminist cultural world-view on other species. It’s insulting.”
And then came a Saturday afternoon when Harry, ensconced in marking seventh-year essays on the difference between shapeshifters and werewolves, heard a knock on his door. The classroom door; he had been taking great pains to ensure it was locked, just then, since he had a number of fairly nasty things about the place and no desire to let any student set them free.
“Just so’s you know, I haven’t told anyone you’re here. Not even Blaise or Pansy. It’s up to you, really. But you should probably know now that they are friends of mine, and they tend to show up unannounced.”
“He’s protecting you, Hermione. It’s all he’s ever done, protect everyone around him. It’s what he was trained to do, and you all let him do it. The first time any adult in his life showed him any kind of affection they began immediately to mould him into a weapon against Tom Riddle. Dumbledore made him believe that his entire purpose was to defeat a Dark wizard — I shan’t say lord — and that if that ended in his death it would be the greatest thing he could possibly achieve. With no thought to what he might do afterwards.”
The mood in the room was shifting. Hermione reached up to brush her fingers over his hand. Everyone was tense. Worse than tense. Harry could feel it; not only the discomfort but the agreement. There were many in the audience who would have killed one person to save others, rather than save one to risk others. They hated themselves for it, a bit, but they still felt that way. And there were others who could not have made that choice. Who would have fought for every life, no matter how many that choice cost them. Hermione sat with tears sparkling in her eyes. Harry reached down to squeeze her shoulder, flashing a smile before he looked up at the rest of the room again.
“Don’t bother pretending that you haven’t had feelings for this man for most of your life,” Emrys finally said, quietly. “The fact that you barely mentioned a patient who took up most of your time for months had me paying close attention. It’s not like you. I decided to wait, and let you come to me when you were ready, and I suppose that day has come.”
Harry kissed Draco’s forehead. “My life would be so much easier if I did.” His body hummed; not with arousal, with something else. A promise for the future, maybe. At least, a promise to try. Which was the only promise anyone could ever make.
“Versatile,” Draco quipped, pulling his shirt free of the waistband of his jeans. Harry did the same, laughing, letting his eyes drift over Draco’s lean figure, taking in a huff of breath when Draco reached up and for a moment there was a strip of skin peeking out and just begging to be kissed.
Get us out of here,” he said. “Show me how you tear those wards into pieces. This time, because you want to be with me. Show me.”
“Not as much as we’d like,” Neville replied. “Isn’t that right, Draco. Me and him, we’ve been saying it for for ages, now. There’s nothing wrong with the house system, but it shouldn’t limit who the students make friends with. Isn’t that right, Draco?”
“And then there was… Tom Riddle,” Harry said. “I fought him for the first time when I was eleven years old. No one believed me for years. It’s alright,” he said, raising a hand. “I do understand, and it’s not a problem. But it’s true. And Albus Dumbledore… he took actions that would only ever ensure that I would live long enough to defeat Tom Riddle. He expected that I would die. And I did, as well.”
“I’ll let you know when and if there is anything you can do. In the meantime — just try to act as if Draco
In late August Harry stepped out into the courtyard to hand Draco a mug of coffee. Draco flashed a smile at him, teasing the purring cat with her sardines.
Draco poured himself a glass of Firewhiskey. He wasn’t in any sort of state to slip into Harry’s dreams tonight anyway. He spent a long time rubbing the potion into Harry’s skin, and speaking soothing nonsense. This weekend. This weekend, Harry would wake up. Draco would draw him out of his self-imposed prison and he would at last have the chance to start to rebuild himself.
“You could let me forgive you,” Draco murmured, with his lips brushing against Harry’s ear. “You could remember that I was about to cast an Unforgivable curse on you, and that you — against all laws of rational behaviour, forgave me.”
Harry didn’t move from the couch, with Rose in his arms, for a long time. He realised fairly quickly that he wasn’t the best company. He couldn’t get out of his own head, and the only person who didn’t seem to be concerned about that was Ginny. She had a hundred stories to tell, of matches all ove the world; Brazil, Australia, the USA (“they call Muggles NoMajs!”), Kenya, Denmark. She babbled about the Seeker on the German team whom she had been seeing for the last few months, kept everyone laughing, and left space for Harry to help Molly in the kitchen.
It appeared that Persephone wasn’t going anywhere and Draco didn’t know what she was after. He fed her again, and offered her a window, and then yelped when he saw Hermione’s face in the Floo.
Snape was silent, just raising one eyebrow and letting his lip curl viciously. Draco turned away, ready to lock the door to his rooms and imagine that Snape might find another painting to haunt.
“If he can ditch the creepy cloak for an hour, I’d be happy to host you here for breakfast. Seven-thirty, if you please. I have a lot of work tomorrow. And you and I need to discuss something else before you leave. Something I think Harry would prefer Blaise wasn’t present for.”
“At the very least, you could try to wait until you’ve been awake twenty-four hours or so before you attempt to argue for a hasty escape.”
“I thought there would be more people,” Harry said, quietly. Including the five of them, there were a little over a dozen, and two were Ministry officials of some sort. None of Malfoy’s friends from school were there. Pansy’s family had disappeared to France, Harry knew. Gregory Goyle was in hospital; he hadn’t coped with the memory of the Fiendfyre, or Vincent Crabbe, at all. Theo Nott, Blaise Zabini — Harry had no idea. But there was no one here for Malfoy, and Harry felt ill.
Draco sighed. “I still don’t concede that’s a foregone conclusion — but I think you’re probably right.”
He wondered how long she’d been holding this in. He could say it, just say it. Out loud. He could say, ‘I saw Draco Malfoy, and he broke my nose again’. Tell Hermione about his soft-looking buzz cut and the cigarette he’d held between his fingers and the way he’d poured all of his rage into that guitar. The way he’d flipped off the driver of the van — Harry couldn’t even remember, now, if it had been the drummer or the singer — and the way his eyes had narrowed.
“I’d still like to do something nice for dinner. I’ll cook. Let’s go down to the larder, see what looks good. Perhaps we could pull up a couple of bottles of wine.”
“Well. It was too late. And by then Draco wore the Mark as well, and I believed we would all die. If we’d left, I am sure he would have killed Draco and Lucius. If we stayed, we knew we had only the slimmest chance of surviving. It
“I look forward to having input on the design of my statue in the Ministry,” Draco said drily. “Next, the windows.”
“Nah, but he’s Harry Potter, isn’t he? They need him available to trot out whenever there’s a camera in the street. Or something flashy to be done. That’s not what Auror work is about, you know. It’s not all duelling, and breaking up illegal potions rings. I’m an investigator, right?”
Harry nodded. “Yes. Otherwise, the signatures can get tangled up.” No need to tell her that a deep understanding of the function of wands had made them almost completely unnecessary for him. He raised his eyebrows. “Is it — the core. Is it the quill of a peacock feather?”
Someone should have told him; someone should have said. This was not just a party. This was courting. Pureblood families by the handful, all the girls decked out in dresses that probably cost a few hundred Galleons each, and men looking like they were determined to find brides amongst these beautiful girls who ignored them prettily. Harry, having no interest in finding a bride, felt as if he was marching to the guillotine. And he clearly had Malfoy all wrong. He burned with the humiliation of it.
Emrys laughed. “Alright. So does that mean I should tell you what’s on your mind, or just call you out on it if you lie to me?”
“Let’s go back to not talking about it,” Harry said, sitting gingerly as if he was afraid that wild magic of his might tear the lovely old couch to pieces. “You can tell me about that ring of yours.”
They were busy, though most people were polite enough to let it be a moment for their children and leave Harry alone. He shared warm words with people he knew. He let himself be introduced to a series of awestruck eleven-year-olds, from as close as homes down the street to as far away as France and Turkey.
