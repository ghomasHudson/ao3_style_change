Yaxley leaned forwards, and his lips twisted into what could only be described as a grin, evil and heinous as his eyes, eyes full of such dark, dark mirth it would have made Draco’s stomach twist were it currently not already in knots. The Death Eater leaned forwards, until there was only about ten inches between his face and Draco’s, and Draco could see every scar marring his face, every chipped off tooth, every particle of dirt staining the man’s skin and hair.
. So sorry for disrupting that, by the way. Won’t happen again.”
“Exactly,” agreed Blaise, nodding sagely.
“You really don’t?”
He’d just started reading through an especially interesting case Ron and he had gotten just weeks after having finished their training, when a tap sounded on the window across from where Harry sat on his favourite armchair. He looked up to see a tawny-feathered barn owl sitting on the windowsill, an impatient look in its beady black eyes.
grin.
Draco’s anger tempered slightly. “But he
“Anyway, I got it!” Lavender cried, effectively wrenching Harry from his deliberations, her face split into a grin so large and brilliant it nearly completely concealed her scars. Harry felt immediately worse for having forgotten about Dublin; Lavender had almost given up on her lifelong dream of being an actress due to those scars, only to say to hell with it and pursue the profession anyway. Now she was getting role after role, and Harry couldn’t even be bothered enough to remember her auditions. “The best part is it’ll premier here in London, so I’ll be here for at least a few weeks, maybe even longer! Isn’t that fantastic? And the other cast members are just so kind and talented. Merlin, I can’t believe this is really my life.”
But Draco didn’t want the Chosen One, he didn’t want the Saviour, the celebrity everyone made the great Harry Potter out to be—he just wanted Harry. Harry, who was loud and brash and oblivious and ignorant, who was reckless and stupid, who was kind and compassionate and attentive and good.
Harry snorted. “I promise I won’t tell a soul that you have an actual heart, Malfoy. But don’t think I’ll forget anytime soon.” Malfoy huffed crossly, and Harry laughed, a large, genuine smile twisting its way across his face. “Also, I think if we’re going to be flatmates and have deep conversations like this one, then you really ought to start calling me Harry.”
, Potter. What if I’d been sleeping?”
However, eventually (still far too soon, in Harry’s opinion) Draco pulled back again. Harry had expected at least a hint of a smile on his boyfriend’s face—he knew he must certainly be grinning like an idiot.
But his throat felt constricted, and he croaked out, “Isn’t it too late for that? Hayes asked him out on a date, you should know. And he accepted.”
Silence. Complete and utter silence.
However, before any new surges of worry or dread could fester, a door on the other side of the hallway opened up, only to reveal a tall, willowy woman in white robes, donning a tight bun and even tighter expression.
And before Harry could so much as process those words, Draco surged forwards and kissed him.
But Harry only shrugged again. “So you’ll have an easier time beating me. All you have to do is use that Slytherin cunning of yours, and voila, you win. Imagine having bragging rights that you beat Harry Potter in a duel.”
But then, Malfoy spoke again, his tone unfamiliarly strained, “It shouldn’t bother me anymore, I know that. All she said, about me being a disgrace to the Malfoy name, and how my father should disinherit me for betraying him and leaving him to rot in a cell in Azkaban—it’s rubbish, I know. Lucius got what he deserves, after all he did in the war, after all the lives he helped ruin. Mine and my mother’s, included, I like to think. But…” He made a frustrated little sound, so un-Malfoy-like in every aspect imaginable that Harry looked up and blinked at him, startled. “It’s such fucking bollocks, and yet, there was a time, directly after the war, when I thought the same. Sometimes, when I’m at my worst, it still happens. And it just makes me so confused and angry, because I
After a few moments, Malfoy gave a terse nod, and the silence resumed as they walked, the beat of their dragon-hide boots and trainers respectively on the cobblestone below the only sound. Until, that is, Malfoy said, “My mother wanted me to see a…a Mind Healer, too. She could’ve used it herself just as badly, if not more so. But I…refused. Didn’t think it would help. After all, what good is talking about my past mistakes when nothing I say could ever possibly change them?”
Ginny looked at him almost accusatorily. “Yes
Harry could only gape, mind suddenly a racing, reeling storm of thoughts, each more fleeting than the last. “I…
However, the universe, it seemed, had other plans.
, nor
Draco could only sit there in mute astonishment, both at the soulmark and the story and the fact that Yaxley was telling him this in the first place.
Instead, Draco cleared his throat and said, “Yes, well, it might have slipped my mind. But, as you can see, Potter is fine, so no harm done.”
It wasn’t that Philomena’s words surprised him—no, he’d anticipated them the very moment Potter had suggested Draco try convincing the old shopkeeper to help them with the investigation. Rather, the opposite was true; he had known the words would come, as he had known they would since that day of the battle, since he defected from Voldemort’s side, from his father’s side, from the side he’d been brought up to choose always, no questions asked. At the time, the fact he might die trumped the idea of being scorned and reviled by his fellow purebloods for all eternity, but afterwards, as he’d sat with his mother on the crumbling steps of Hogwarts and watched as Lucius was taken away in chains, cold inside as Narcissa Malfoy, who had never shed a single tear in front of her son her entire life, wept into his shoulder, and wept and wept and
. Where was the Draco that stress-baked chocolate cakes wearing a pink, flower-studded apron?
“So,” Lavender said, glancing at Parvati mischievously, who was once again blushing furiously. Yup, Harry thought sympathetically, dimples alright. “Are you two…?”
But Harry shook his head furiously, whirling around to face Draco. “So you thought the best course of action would be to be an arsehole right back? What are you, five? I thought you said no more pettiness."
He stopped speaking, and he started screaming.
Harry was still immensely confused—which, honestly, seemed to be
And before Harry could so much as blink, a familiar tugging sensation rose up in his chest, and then they were gone.
She was looking better, he was endlessly grateful to be able to say. Not good, no, not by a long shot; she was too thin, her collarbones too pronounced, her limbs too frail. Her skin was shades and shades paler than it ought to be, less ivory and more ashen, and the contrast of those dark circles hanging underneath her eyes worried Draco. Even her hair had lost its usual sheen.
girls.”
“There, I showed you my soulmark. I told you my story. I dare say, my boy, it’s your turn now.” He grinned, exposing a row of chipped, yellowing teeth, all of them unnaturally sharp under the harsh lighting of the room. “And what an interesting story I’m certain yours’ll be. I’m curious, did you realise before or after you betrayed the Dark Lord that you wanted to fuck the one person you were supposed to hate?”
He was still waiting.
“Oh my god, I forgot all about that. I can’t believe you honestly had a
Something—be that Draco’s no doubt panicked expression, or his sudden and uncharacteristic inability to string together a simple sentence, or maybe just his hyperventilating—caused Blaise’s face to harden with determination, and he said, “Fine. I’ll take you to him. But remember what you promised.”
to take her vague-worded warning to heart. Now, however, he knew better.
The hospital room was impossibly quiet, so utterly silent you could have easily heard a pin drop. It was like they were somehow suspended in time, like the whole world was under a stasis charm more powerful than even Avada Kedavra.
Now it was Harry’s turn to let out an exasperated huff. “He’s not
Harry’s blurred shape stepped closer again, and Yaxley’s grip on Draco tightened some more, and in that moment, several things happened at once.
The sort of moment that was life-changing, and in the most beautiful of ways.
So there. Our two idiots finally got over themselves...only took them about 90k words.
It was only when Yaxley’s harsh, cold laugh sounded again, and the Death Eater said, “See, Mr. Potter, I know you,” that Draco looked up to see Harry, at least a full step nearer than he’d stood moments ago, eyes wide and mouth slightly agape, the hand holding his wand having briefly dropped a full five inches.
Harry nodded, only at the back of his mind thinking he should probably be more worried by all this. Only—some homicidal madman trying to murder Harry in the most agonizing way possible? Same old, same old. Whoever was up there, pulling the strings, really ought to come up with something a bit more creative next time.
Harry was stunned. “You…saved me?”
Harry barked a laugh. “Imagine how he’d react if he knew we were dating.”
Because he was a
"So, are you from the States?” Harry asked.
“That won’t be necessary.”
Draco made a muffled sound somewhere between surprise and delight, and that broke the very last of Harry’s resolve. He melted into the touch, the feel of Draco’s lips on his, of the hand gently cupping his face, and slung his arms around the blond’s neck, pulling him closer, nearer, until there was no space at all left between them, until their chests were touching and Harry could feel the pounding beat of Draco’s heart to match his own.
And although Draco had immediately flushed crimson-red and vehemently shushed the girl—after all, they were in
“Don’t you ‘Head Auror Robards’ me, Harry,” she said coldly, and Harry felt like he was getting emotional whiplash here. Had Ginny’s moods been this erratic when they’d been dating? He didn’t think so.
doing here? I can’t imagine Clarisse let you all in here, especially not in the state you’re in.”
Draco had to hand it to the youngest Weasley—she could be quite an intimidating sight when she wanted to be. A spitfire, much like his mother and Pansy. Honestly, Draco wouldn’t be surprised if that was one of the main reasons Harry had gotten together with her in the first place; the Chosen One truly did seem to be unnaturally drawn to the dangerous.
“Blimey, Hermione, we could have just Apparated instead of walking here all the way from the Thai place.” The redhead groaned. “My feet feel like they’re about to fall off.”
, there will be no dates of any sort, not today or in the foreseeable future. Oh, and if you would kindly fuck off now, that’d be much appreciated.”
hate Lucius for it, Harry truly couldn’t understand.
“Right then,” she said, looping one arm through that of her fiancé (again, inexplicable). “Now that we know Harry’s back safe and sound, we’d better head off. I’ve a meeting in an hour, as does Ronald here, though I have no doubt he wouldn’t mind missing it.”

But when the waitress came over to where they sat well away from the pub’s other occupants, ready to take their order, and Harry said, “One Butterbeer for me, please” Draco’s eyebrows snapped together.
Draco glanced once more at Harry before leaving, because apparently he had about as much self-control as Ronald sodding Weasley. When he did, he was both surprised and delighted to find Harry already staring up at him, though the Gryffindor looked away again, flustered, the moment their eyes met.
“What a ponce,” he muttered under his breath as he flicked his book back open, quiet enough it was possible Harry wasn’t meant to hear it, but also loud enough he probably was.
He was already halfway across the kitchen when he glanced over his shoulder and called out to a still dumbfounded-looking Ron, “You coming?”
He already knew.
Draco could feel his throat grow tight. “I…I won’t. Promise.”
Right then, Draco almost wanted to hug the pea-brained git. He reached out for Harry’s hand and grinned even wider, if such a thing was even possible at this point. “Sure are.”
for the life of him be angry at. To an unnatural extent even: the joy, the thrill, it all felt too large to stay trapped within him, locked in with no way out. He felt like he might just explode with the feel of it, burst with sheer emotion.
“I know,” Ron interrupted curtly. But he didn’t sound angry or vindictive, and instead his tone was uncharacteristically gentle. “Look, I’m not trying to guilt-trip you right now, I promise. I just need you to understand that I know you well enough by now to recognise whether or not someone is right for you. Ginny, as much as it pains me to admit, wasn’t.”
, the both of you!” he hissed. “You’re such bloody wankers, I have no idea why I’m even friends with you lot.”
Harry was rudely wrenched from his own self-pity, when a knock sounded on the door of his apartment, followed by a familiar voice. “Harry,” Hermione said through the wood, her voice far too cheery for his current mood. “We brought Thai.”
Draco’s heart hammered in his chest, and he didn’t care he must look like a fool, that he was giving the Death Eater all the confirmation he could possibly need. All he could think was that
If not for the blond’s murderous expression and the overall static tension in the air, Harry might have laughed; no one did I’m-too-good-for-you-so-bow-you-lowly-peasant quite like Draco Malfoy.
He laughed against Draco’s lips, and Harry could feel the Slytherin’s smile through the kiss, could feel his approving hum as it sent a shiver down Harry’s spine.
Harry huffed another particularly long, pitiful sigh.
just sitting there, staring right back down at Harry with equally startled eyes, as though he were in a Body-Bind and not perfectly capable of
him here, not when there was no guarantee the next stranger assigned to his side would do whatever it took to make sure he stayed safe.
Harry opened his mouth to disagree, to dismiss the worry, the fear in his soulmate’s wide grey eyes. But he couldn’t lie to Draco. Couldn’t, and wouldn’t, not today, not tomorrow, not ever if he could help it.
a creepy stalker, nor was he, contrary to what Pansy always said, mindlessly obsessed with Harry Potter.
of course. Potter, with his stupid inability to stay still, even in sleep, and his stupid love for grilled cheese sandwiches and his stupid messy, adorable bedhead.
There were a few chuckles, and Weasley had the good sense to look at least slightly abashed.
Malfoy’s grey eyes darkened, as did his scowl. “Why, you're recovering from attempted murder, of course. What did you think you were doing here, Potter? Enjoying the five-star accommodations? Perhaps the gourmet food?”
Draco’s mouth quirked into the tiniest of smiles, and although it was hardly anything at all compared to the humongous grin he’d worn plastered across his face during their play-duel, it made Harry instantly glad he’d held on.
Eventually, however, he set down the mug and made for the living room. Why, he couldn’t say, for he didn’t expect Harry to be there, sitting in his designated armchair and smiling and laughing like he would have a mere day before. No, Harry was either in his room, or gone entirely, perhaps out with Nic already, and—
Harry nodded vehemently. “Oh, yes. Very, very urgent.”
Draco looked absolutely radiant, and the smoothness of his cornsilk hair, the softness of his skin, of his expression, they contrasted the intensity of his quicksilver gaze so intensely Harry found it difficult to look away. So he didn’t.
Even he could admit begrudgingly that Harry wasn’t to blame for Draco’s near-heart attack. It wasn’t Harry’s fault he’d been gone when Weasley and several other colleagues (whom Draco really ought to know the names of by now, but alas) had burst into the flat all frenzied and hectic, making Draco nearly spill the contents of his errands all over the kitchen floor. Harry’d simply left at the wrong time, left without ever saying where, left with that absolute
He stopped dead in his tracks, causing Draco to very nearly crash into him. The Slytherin cursed, but Harry could only stand there on the dimly lit sidewalk outside the restaurant, an unmoving stone in the sea of Londoners rushing down the sidewalk to get home, eyes wide and mouth agape.
“Wait, how
The silence had gone on for what could have been only a few seconds or a few long minutes. Looking around the table, each of Harry's friends looked deep in thought, and judging by the muted pain in their eyes they were all currently reliving the same things Harry was.
that washed over him. The soft pull of warmth he’d felt earlier was like a beacon of light now, streaming through his chest like a tiny sun. Not to mention how wonderful it felt being pressed up against his boyfriend, skin-to-skin, the soft pounding of the Slytherin’s heart like an echo to Harry’s own.
after all, because, as he’d already stated before, that would just be awkward. But…a
He chuckled slightly and was glad when Draco smiled as well, even if it was a far cry from his usual humongous smirk.
. And then Harry had kissed back because…well.
Harry swallowed, and when he did, he found his mouth entirely dry.
At the door, Hermione and Harry traded looks, and although she was obviously trying very hard to keep a serious face, Harry could tell Hermione was holding back a grin. “Honestly, Ronald,” she said and wordlessly thrusted the takeout into Harry’s open arms. “You’re so melodramatic. It was only a few blocks.” Following the example of her fiancé, she strode across the room without a second glance back at Harry, the latter of which shut the door again, amused, and placed the Thai on the kitchen counter, before joining his friends in the living room.
(See the end of the chapter for
It made him seem infinitely younger, softer, like he would perhaps look in a world where Voldemort hadn’t murdered his parents at the age of one, where he hadn’t had to fight for survival every year since in a world where everyone either wanted something from him, or wanted him dead.
Blaise opened his mouth, then promptly shut it. Opened it. And shut it again. Eventually, he set his jaw, and within seconds it was back—that mask of calm composure, of cool indifference, the façade every pureblood knew from infancy to put up if ever a challenge caught them off guard.
Of course, the moment Malfoy realized that last fact, his eyes went wide and he started spluttering as though someone had hexed him, robbing him of the ability to form coherent sentences. “Bloody hell, Potter, I knew you had no taste whatsoever—that much is painfully obvious in the way you dress—but
But it was still
Draco growled—honest-to-Merlin
“No buts!” Harry proclaimed, and then he was tugging at Draco’s hand, pulling the lagging Slytherin back through the kitchen and into the living room. “Uno makes everything better, promise. You’ll be smirking that Slytherin smirk of yours again in no time at all.”
But neither Hermione nor Ron asked for any further details, bless them, instead simply looking sympathetic. “To be honest, I wasn’t sold on the idea of Malfoy watching over you at first,” Ron said, and had it not been for the sombre atmosphere, Harry would have snorted aloud at that slight little understatement. Ron looked over at where Draco still slept peacefully, a thoughtful look on his face. “But if he hadn’t been there… You’re lucky, Harry. Really damn lucky.”
And then there was the second option. That Potter’s soulmark would not be a
So, yeah. That really just happened. To everyone who commented in earlier chapters that Nic was kinda sus—you were right! Yay! You can now officially say your judgement is better than Harry’s (not that that’s hard to manage lmao, Harry is, as we have already established, an idiot)
Draco had already opened his mouth to interrupt, but all words evaporated into thin air at that last sentence, and instead he felt himself flush crimson red. He shut his mouth and did his best to regain some semblance of composure, but judging by Blaise’s humongous grin, the effectiveness of his attempt still left much to be desired.
And yet that still didn’t warrant Harry’s reaction. He’d taken all the progress they’d made just hours before and shredded it to pieces, all with a few harsh words and well-aimed insults—none of which had been necessary. Granted, Harry had always been one to lose his temper fast, but
Harry’s frown deepened. “No. Why did we go to Diagon?”
For a split second, the flat was quiet again, stunned into silence.
Wait a second.
. Sure, Ginny was great, but he’d broken off their relationship for a reason. If fate now suddenly decided to go ‘nope, you’re destined to be together forever after all’…well, it would be awkward as hell, to say the least.
“I—you—Draco, you fucking loon! Let me
Draco?
“Merlin,” said Harry, slightly breathless. “You weren’t kidding when you said we needed to hurry. Bloody hell, you’d think Yaxley was right on your heels, that’s how fast you—wait, where are you going?”
Whichever it was, Nic’s lips thinned in obvious displeasure. “Yes, actually. I’m apprenticing in Ancient Runes there.” Draco was sure he was only being civil due to Harry’s presence. Well, the feeling was mutual.
Through a pair of large double doors.
“And you’re such a Gryffindor.”

“Draco,” said Harry, surprised. “I didn’t think you’d be back so soon.”
to doing it right.
Nic’s gaze remained downwards for another few seconds, silent as he stared into his glass, watched the little bubbles of carbonated water shoot out of the cup.
Ron gave a curt little nod, and he still wouldn’t look Harry in the eye, still sat there across the table, perched awkwardly on the edge of his seat, wringing his hands, expression one of intense discomfort.
Harry liked to think of himself as brave—after all, he was a Gryffindor, an Auror and had managed to kill the greatest dark wizard of all time—but when placed in that sort of setting, he had no qualms admitting he’d been scared shitless.
Before Hermione could do much other than smile warmly at Harry and open her mouth, Ron staggered into view behind her, all the while coughing and sneezing violently. Hermione pursed her lips as she regarded her fiancé, and Harry was sure she was going to start scolding him yet again to
And the worst part of it was that, this time, Draco couldn’t even blame Potter.
. The one word Draco had not let himself use, not let himself utter, not even let himself
The blond smiled, and it was a smile of such pure joy that Harry found his heart stumbling a beat and his own lips tugging upwards into a gigantic grin—a grin that only grew when Draco repaid the favour with a deeper, much longer kiss that had Harry’s insides writhing like a bundle of flobberworms.
Draco didn’t know what to say, how to react. All he could do was stare.
“Shit, I’m sorry,” breathed Ron, drawing back so fast one would have thought Harry’s injuries were contagious. “You must be in pain. Harry, I’m…I’m so sorry. Really. We never should have gone to Diagon, and I never should have left you alone. I should have paid more attention, I should have—”
Draco scowled, confused, and he was about to snap at the man to please at least try to keep up, the utter imbecile, invisible stomach wounds notwithstanding. However, before he could, Jennings’ words sunk in, as did his own.
said,” hissed Harry, “I’m not. Going.
In. Out. In. Out.
The other man was an Auror as well, judging by his red robes and overall presence in the destroyed mess that had once been Renaults and Co. The department had closed off half of Knockturn Alley, and there were currently at least two dozen Aurors out combing the surrounding area for Yaxley’s accomplice/murderer.
So that was a rollercoaster. Lots of ~feels~ and thoughts and a bunch of other stuff. Hehe. I'm evil, I know.
idea how worried we were? You can’t just do that, Harry, leave without telling anyone where you’d gone, especially not at a time like this! How is it you still can’t get into that thick, thick skull of yours that
Footsteps sounded, and Harry tried to roll over, to move, even if it was just an inch. His wand was on the other side of the alleyway, so there was no getting that in time, but if he could just catch Nic by surprise, tackle him and take his wand…
He nodded and turned to the waitress as well. “I’ll have a Butterbeer, too, please. Extra cream, and with that delicious caramel drizzle on top if you have it.”
Just like that, Harry’s thoughts shuddered to a stop. Fucking hell, what was
But Ron was already continuing, “I know that, you know that, hell, even
Malfoy fixed his grey eyes on Harry, lips twisting strangely. Then, however, he inclined his head once, quickly looking back to the fireplace. “Err…thank you. You’re not half bad yourself.”
And that was one thing he had never wanted to do.
don’t make the mistake of waiting too long. Because people don’t stay single forever, especially not when said people have the name and face of Harry Potter. Right now, it’s just you and him. But once Yaxley’s caught and everything goes back to normal, it’ll be you and him
He wasn’t sure what he’d do if a
“Her name was Carlota,” said Yaxley, and the piercing clarity of his voice finally made Draco tear his eyes away from the scarred soulmark and look up into the Death Eater’s cold eyes. What he found there was nothing short of delight. “She was a half-blood, two years under me in Hogwarts. A Hufflepuff, if you’ll believe it. From the moment I met her, I thought she was too good for me.” The man gave a wheeze, but Draco couldn’t tell whether it was derisive or rueful. “We were good together for a time, Carlota and I. Very good, in fact. But you should know, my boy, everything ends.
As a matter of fact, Harry thought, Ron would make a great dad himself one day, and Hermione a great mum. Harry, though…well, he wasn’t so sure.
Except Draco had had a shite childhood as well—how could he not with Lucius Malfoy as a father—and yet Harry had no doubt
Plus, if Potter already considered Lucius a raging blood purity-fanatic, he was sure to

But the insults never came, and when Harry glanced over his shoulder, he nearly dropped his spatula.
do that, would stay by Harry’s side and duel Yaxley a thousand times over if that’s what it took to protect him.
care. Harry, of course I—”
,” he heard himself say, and just like that the silence evaporated again, an excited buzz overtaking not only their table, but those closest to them as well. Apparently, and Harry really should have seen this coming before speaking, there had been more than just his friends’ ears listening in.
“Really. I always found it hard to believe, as well. Your soulmate is supposed to be the one person in the world who will love you always, unconditionally, despite everything. I guess it’s possible he did love her, in his own bizarre way. But it always seemed cruel to me, nonetheless.”
Instead, though, Harry simply said, “It went well then, I take it.”
He stopped dead, the sentence trailing off right alongside his thoughts. For it was then that Harry noticed the figure standing at the feet of his bed, all tattered, dirty robes and dishevelled hair and skin ten times its usual pallor—which was really saying something, in the case of Draco Malfoy.
Nic was still watching him with unconcealed amusement, and it made Harry’s cheeks flush pink, which in turn made his eyes snap up to scan the nearby tables for any obvious eavesdroppers. Which was naturally entirely pointless, seeing as everyone around them was muggle, and Muggles didn’t give a rat’s arse that Harry Potter was currently on a date with one Dominic Hayes.
“That’s very considerate of you, Ma-…Draco.” Although evidently still surprised, Hermione’s words were warm and heartfelt.
he remember?
However, before Harry could shoot anything back, Weasley pulled away, hands all the while still gripping Harry’s forearms so strongly Draco was fairly certain that’d leave bruises.
There was a moment of tense silence, and Draco could feel his chest tighten painfully, whether due to fear or anger or hate, perhaps all three.
But then she hissed, “I don’t know what you’re playing at, Malfoy, but don’t expect me to believe even for a second that you’ve
made of wood.
He fell abruptly silent, and Harry hadn’t thought it possible for Draco’s usually so pale cheeks to get any redder, but they did. It left that fluttering feeling in his chest growing and growing and expanding and expanding, until he half-expected to be sick.
“Salazar’s balls, Potter,” groaned Draco. “You did not seriously pester Pansy about her soulmark?”
, to say the least. “Know is one word for it. But yes, I’m…familiar with Renaults and Co. My father used to do business with them. The owner, Philomena Craigs, is an old family friend of sorts.”
“Perfect,” she said and crossed her arms. “I’ll precedent this by saying that I don’t particularly like you, Draco. Not really, not yet. You were too cruel to me and my friends all those years at Hogwarts for me to completely forgive you any time soon. But the thing is, Harry
And he reached out and took Harry’s hand.
The latter could do nothing but stare up at the familiar hard features he’d never thought he’d have to face again, features that wrenched his thoughts deep, deep, deep under into memories Draco had long since buried and written off as past and forgotten. His mind reeled in a desperate attempt to stop panicking and
. Was going on.
doing, exactly? Avoiding the issue, maybe? Trying to divert my attention so that I’m angry with you and forget I appear to have just hit a nerve?”
Yaxley scowled, putting more pressure into his wand currently digging into Draco’s skin. “Well who do we have here. Draco Malfoy. Always knew you were too much of a weakling to serve the Dark Lord, but I hadn’t expected you to stoop so low. Harry Potter’s Auror bodyguard? Filthy blood-traitor.” Unbridled hatred and disgust radiated off Yaxley as he first spat the words, eyes blazing, and then proceeded to spit on the street next to Draco.
Draco looked down at the apron, but instead of tearing it from his body, sneering and screeching about mudblood filth and blood-purity and all that shite, he simply frowned slightly and said, “Granger’s? Hmm, yes, that does make more sense than it being yours.”
And in his hesitation, he could only stand there, startled, as the seemingly unconscious man leapt up and lunged at Draco. And as he collided with the cobbled stone below, the air knocked out of his lungs, his head roaring in protest as pain exploded at the back of his skull, all Draco could think was that he had, once again, reacted too slowly.
to tell you.”
“You’re making me sound like a cockroach.”
. Is there something you’d like to say, Ginevra, or shall I try piece together your motives myself?”
Ron frowned but nodded. “Yeah, that. They’ve got the best inquisitors in the force working on him, as we speak.”
He’d go somewhere else. But where? Malfoy Manor was out as well, for the same reason as Harry’s flat, as were all his friend’s apartments, and—
, and it was going to take more than him losing his temper and being an arsehole to negate that.
“As though you’d already found your soulmate. And I was thinking, if it’s not too much to ask, whether you could, err, tell me a bit about her.” Potter was staring at the floor, as though the kitchen tiles were the most interesting thing invented since Quidditch. “You see, I don’t really know a lot about this whole soulmate-business, and judging by the way you reacted when I mentioned your soulmark, it seemed to me as though you had already found whoever it was whose name is on your wrist. I honestly don’t mean to pry, I’d just really like to understand what it is I’ve gotten myself into, you know?”
Beside Harry, Granger actually snorted.
Harry blinked, looking equal measures surprised and relieved and…touched? Merlin’s beard, Draco didn’t have the emotional capacity to handle this.
waiting, now would we? It’s funny, I never even considered you might be bent. But I suppose the right person’s all it takes, right?”
“Pansy?” Draco said beside him, surprised. “What are you doing here?”
to tell him, to jump up, shove back his own sleeve, wave around his soulmark and tell Harry the truth, that he’d been in love with him since they met at age eleven. Except that’d just ruin everything, wouldn’t it?
“Robards is Head Auror—if he says it’s safe, we can trust it is. Plus, you won’t get into any trouble if he’s already on board with the whole thing,” Harry continued. “All I’m asking is an hour or two. Come on, Malfoy, where’s your sense of adventure gone? It’ll be
At least Angelina and George were safely at St. Mungo’s now. Ginny had sent a Patronus to let Ron know she’d be over in no more than ten minutes, but the latter had already done an amazing job calming the little one down.

The next waited for him behind those large and imposing cherry wood doors.
want to witness.”
What.
And then his eyes landed on the fireplace.
Harry thought to have glimpsed the barest hint of surprise flash across Nic’s face, followed by something else, something too fleeting for him to possibly place. But then his expression became one of sympathetic tranquillity.
Draco scowled as well. “If there’re no further objections from His Highness the Chosen One, I’d very much appreciate it if we could
Harry said it with a twinkle in his eye and a shit-eating sort of grin that would usually have Draco rolling his eyes right about now and replying dryly something along the lines of ‘You wish, Potter’ or ‘Ha, that’ll be the day’.
, always have, always will, even if said care is misplaced. Behold, the foolishness of the sentimental.”
made Draco feel light-headed, although, rationally, he knew Harry would never be his. Maybe
“Nothing at all,” said Draco, voice just as delightfully lacklustre as his smile. “I simply said I’m sorry for your loss. That must have been terrible, having to go through that. The death of a family member is unbearable, especially if you were as close as you and your sister undoubtedly were. Anyway, there are no hard feelings, of course. Know that I don’t blame you for acting like a petty, smallminded buffoon, not under the circumstances. It’s all in the past now. Water under the bridge.”
All he cared about was the person right in front of him, and that was all he’d ever need.
Both Hayes’ and Draco’s gazes snapped back to Harry, whose expression was now one of vague confusion as opposed to his initial absentminded trance. Draco’s boyfriend cleared his throat, and repeated, “Honestly, I don’t remember a thing. Last thing I recall, Mione, Ron and I were at the flat, and Draco was at the Ministry. Apparently, I lost my memories of a full day.” He frowned. “But, Nic, I should apologise about last week. The date—”
He rolled behind the next available object—a display case filled with what appeared to be numerous enlarged snake skulls—flattening himself against the floor just as a curse shattered through the glass, raining little crystalline shards and chunks of bone down upon him.
.” Draco’s hands fisted around the mattress he was currently perched on top of, and for the first time in the last half hour, the ripping pain in his stomach became secondary. It had settled into a dull sort of ache, but while he wasn’t doubling over in pain anymore, the sensation certainly wasn’t comfortable either.
For a moment, nobody moved. Nobody breathed—at least Harry knew he sure as hell didn’t—and instead all they did was stare at each other where they lay in an awkward heap on the living room floor, Harry flat on his back and Draco right on top of him, silver eyes as wide as saucers.
When he saw Draco’s sour expression, Blaise’s smile morphed into a truly shit-eating grin. “Disappointed much? I know you’d rather I were someone else, say, someone with a lightning scar and horrendously ugly glasses—but must you be so obvious about it? It’s wounding, really. I save your life, and this is the thanks I get. Consider me wounded.”
Harry only stared at him for a long moment, and there was shock visible on his face, in his wide eyes, so ridiculously green they made Draco temporarily forget the emotions thrashing within him. There was shock, and there was hurt, and Harry looked like Draco
sitting at their table—a person with dimples.
“But—”
Granger’s smile widened ever so slightly. “I know.”
Harry chuckled. “Oh, come now, they’re no sillier than Ravenclaw, Gryffindor, Slytherin and Hufflepuff. I mean,
But Pansy was as much a Slytherin as he was, and, after years and years of friendship, had become irritatingly immune to Draco’s remarks, so she simply rolled her long-lashed eyes. “I’m serious, Draco. I know Potter’s the most oblivious being in this world and the next, but you can’t bank on that forever. Sooner or later, he’s going to notice something, or, worse still, someone else might.” Her smirk twisted higher. “
Harry nodded cautiously. “Err, sure. Yeah. Sounds good.” He hesitated. “Mind helping me put the furniture back in place? I’m not letting you sit back and watch again while I do all the work.” It was meant as a joke, but he couldn’t quite bring himself to grin.
Waited another few moments. Still nothing.
Draco clenched his jaw. Salazar, they were going about this all wrong. Philomena Craigs was an extremist when it came to blood purity, sure, but she’d stayed well away from Voldemort and his Death Eaters during both of the two wars—why the hell would she go out of her way to willingly assist Yaxley now? She was all bark, no bite. Anyone in their right mind could see that!
the baby’s coming. I’m going to—Fred, stop crying, mummy’s going to be alright, I promise—I’m taking Angie to St. Mungo’s now. Get over here and take care of Fred, will you, the boy’s terrified, and I can’t very well take him with us. I already sent Mum and Dad a Patronus, they’re headed to the hospital. Ginny’s on her way, too, but you’re closest, so get your arse over here
But it was indeed Dominic Hayes standing there, staring at them with a mixture of surprise and…something else. Despite being a natural at reading people’s expressions, Draco couldn’t for the life of him figure out what that ‘something’ was, and it darkened his mood even further. Which, it should be stressed, after having a perfectly good snog with his soulmate interrupted by none other than
.” Harry didn’t know why his heart was beating so fast right now, why his lungs felt so constricted, why his heart suddenly hurt so very much, like it was being squeezed to death by a pair of invisible hands. “We have each other now, right? You and me. So what does it matter what happened in the past?”
“You know what?” asked the Death Eater, an unpleasant smirk contorting his face until it looked just about as human as the red-eyed, snake-like thing Draco would often awaken to in the middle of the night, sweat-drenched and shaking at the memory of Voldemort’s monstrous features. “On second thought, I think I just might.”
Harry snorted.
Harry nodded, dazed. “Cool.”
Harry quickly blinked and looked away, his olive skin doing little to hide his blush. “Nothing. You didn’t have to order that, you know. I just personally don’t like not having complete control over myself. But if you wanted something stronger, you really should have gotten it—”
“Harry,” Draco said again, and the Gryffindor didn’t know what was going on right now, but still that smile alone loosened something in his chest, making it easier to breathe again. Some might say it worked like magic. “Harry, oh my
So, Harry hadn’t spent much time considering how Malfoy must feel about this whole situation, but now that he actually thought about it, he couldn’t imagine the blond was delighted either. Did he still hate Harry as he had in school? Harry had long since stopped hating the Slytherin, and although their relationship still wasn’t near friendly, he’d always made it a point to greet Malfoy whenever they passed each other back at the office.
Narcissa frowned at her son. “I wish I knew. He wouldn’t tell me anything either, only said it had something to do with a job he’d been tasked with during the war, one I’m guessing he and Yaxley did together. He kept mumbling something about the Order of the Phoenix, too.”
But then he also thought of Harry, of the hurt in his face when Draco had lashed out, of the disappointment and disgust he’d known even then he deserved.
Secondly, Harry knew for certain Draco was not made of wood, for the git, in his apparent surprise to see Harry in front of his door, had evidently forgotten how to correctly put on a jumper. That was the only explanation Harry could come up with, because there Draco was, silver-blond hair still damp and curling at the ends, grey eyes wide and…currently semi-shirtless.
, now that I’ve actually seen you two together, I think it’s safe to say the situation isn’t nearly as hopeless as I’d feared. If you were to just tell him…”
“With a face like this,” the blond deadpanned, “it’d be a shame if I didn’t.”
“Oh, Merlin’s balls, Draco, don’t tell me he’s managed to project his ineloquence upon you. It’s been
Harry laughed, and the sound instantly calmed Draco’s residual anger. “Quit talking about Gryffindors as though we were the Dark Side of the Force and Slytherin were the Light. If anything, I’d say
So much for no more awkwardness.

And without another word, Draco shouldered past Harry, not looking him in the eye as he passed, not looking at him at all, and marched into the kitchen to get himself a bloody cup of tea.
(See the end of the chapter for
But before Harry could say anything or even raise a hand in greeting, the fifth and last of his newest guests emerged from the Floo.
On the ground a few feet away, Yaxley was grinning from ear to ear now. “I told you not to underestimate him, did I not? I
And when he looked back up at Draco, who was still staring down at Harry’s soulmark like it was the eighth world wonder, Harry didn’t even care he was crying. He didn’t care he must look and sound like the biggest fucking sap of all time, didn’t care that he was still bruised and battered and being hunted by some maniac killer.
Malfoy looked at him with that same flicker of surprise as before, but then he averted his gaze and hastily complied, and although he looked more like a stone statue perching there at the edge of the seat, back once again ramrod straight, it was better than standing awkwardly by the door.
in turn probably looked like a waterlogged albino rat. In an ugly bright-red poncho.
Harry fingers clenched around his glass.
But Ron, much to Harry’s surprise, simply held up a silencing hand, his expression turning from uncomfortable to sombre in the blink of an eye.
Draco turned back to his friend, brow furrowed. “Am
Draco lifted his eyebrows. “Why on earth would you think that?”
“No,” he said simply, although the more appropriate term would have to be ‘hissed’. And as if that wasn’t suspicious enough on its own, the blond then glanced once over his left, once over his right shoulder, and when his robes swished open for just a split-second to reveal his right hand clutching his wand in a death-grip, Harry put two and two together.
Draco had just been sent to wait in a hospital room when the door across the room flew wide-open and one frazzled-looking Blaise Zabini came bursting through.
Draco may be an arrogant, pretentious toff, but he was
“Ron,” Harry wheezed. “You’re suffocating me, mate. Ease up, will you?”
And so when Yaxley suddenly leapt up, wrenching Draco up with him so that Draco’s body formed a definite and corporeal shield against any curses Harry might send their way, a dagger pressed into Draco’s throat where moments ago the tip of Yaxley’s wand had been, a little gasp was the most profound reaction Draco could manage. When had he become so utterly
“Better pessimistic and alive than optimistic and dead,” Draco snapped, reverting to insults as was his default, because it was just so, so much easier to pretend when he didn’t have to be civil to the beautiful prat. “This is stupid and reckless and absolutely insane. And with
“And I don’t suppose you’d be willing to give them up? If you don’t do so now, I feel obligated to remind you that we do have other, far less pleasant means of extracting information.”
Harry didn’t know how long he stared at the writing, didn’t know how long he stopped breathing, didn’t know how long time and space seemed to come to a screeching halt as his world rearranged itself around him, breaking apart and reassembling itself in the most magnificent way.
A bed, on which the sleeping, mussy-haired form of one Harry Potter lay sprawled across the red covers, one leg dangling over the side of the bed, chest rising and falling in slow, soft breaths. The sight robbed Draco of his own breath. Even when in the company of his closest friends, Harry never stopped being alert, guarded, as though someone might come jumping out of the shadows at any moment and start wildly flinging curses. After all Harry’s been through, it was no wonder.
what this is all about. The crux of the matter, if you will—
However, much to Draco’s approval, Harry completely ignored his friend. Instead, he kissed back, not caring that his two best friends were watching, and it generated such an intense rush of joy within Draco that he threw caution to the wind and deepened the kiss.
Harry opened his mouth to decline, after all, he’d had a few bites of bread back at the restaurant—except his stomach took that very moment to gurgle particularly loudly, sending Harry’s cheeks flushing bright red and Draco’s eyebrows lifting in amusement.
to vent his anger, to ease the chaotic, searing bundle of emotions twisting and writhing within him, if only briefly.
“Yes, because that’s essentially my only function,” Draco drawled, and Harry was so thankful he didn’t glower back at Ginny, although there was no way the Slytherin had missed the intensity of her narrow-eyed gaze. “Draco Malfoy, the baking slave who lives to serve Gryffindors.”
He took a deep breath, gripping Harry’s hand, if possible, even tighter. “You see, it’s…about my soulmark. My soulmate, to be more precise.”
And just like that Harry was thinking about Draco again, of all the times they’d sat across from each other in the living room, the Slytherin curled up by the fireplace, reading that leather-bound book of his, always reacting annoyed when Harry interrupted him or asked him something or even just breathed too loud. Except then Harry would say something to provoke him, and Draco would slam his book shut with a sneer and launch into a volley of insults, and then Harry would respond in sort, and then after a few rounds of to-and-fro those insults would get so ridiculous one of them would inevitably crack up, and then they’d just sit there in the living room for hours on end and joke and laugh and talk, and—
Being a Malfoy no longer held the same glory it perhaps once had, before the war, before Voldemort. But at least it no longer warranted a handful of death threats a day owled to the Manor.

Enjoy!
His gaze darted to Draco as he uttered that last sentence, and although he was smiling ever so slightly, something in Hayes’ eyes made the Slytherin tense up. Without meaning to, Draco’s right hand gripped Harry’s, who in turn squeezed back immediately.
Fuck. Harry may not have been a Healer, but he knew coughing up blood was never
not after the battle—but late nights in the Slytherin common room, chatting and laughing and playing games under the faint glow of the lake outside with all his friends, were still one of his fondest memories. There had been no judgement there, no light and no dark side. Just children enjoying their childhood in a world that sought to destroy said joy.
Harry scowled, feeling suddenly defensive, although he couldn’t quite say why. “I know the war’s over, Mione. And I have moved on.”
She huffed angrily. “No, I came to
people—can’t switch emotions like that. Or fake them, for that matter, at least not that efficiently.”
Harry glanced up, just once, just for a second. Or that was what he’d planned to do. Instead, he found himself staring at the sickly pallor of Malfoy’s skin, more grey than its usual ivory, and the way his blond eyebrows bunched together, and how his grey eyes glimmered with uncertainty, a sight Harry had never, not once in the near-decade he’d known Draco Malfoy, ever seen happen. And he suddenly found it very hard indeed to look away again.
“Nothing.”
, you dim-witted moron, understand? Friends stay at the hospital overnight if someone they care about recently had a brush with death.
So, Harry simply said, “I never claimed you weren’t. Obviously, you are, otherwise Robards wouldn’t have assigned you to me.” He stood, and Malfoy looked up from where he’d once again fixed his gaze on the empty fireplace, eyes wary. Harry stretched out a hand. “Look, I know we’ve never really gotten along. But I’m willing to let bygones be bygones, if you are, too. I think we’ve both outgrown such childish petulance, right?”
Draco shrugged. “None taken. The feeling’s mutual.”
However, he’d also kissed Harry Potter the evening before, and Harry Potter had kissed him back. Multiple times.
“Yes, yes, alright, you win, Potter. My sincerest apologies for being a snobbish, stuck-up, self-important twat.” He shot Harry a half-hearted glare. “Happy now?”
It was likely just his imagination, but Harry thought Malfoy actually flinched a bit at that last part. Yet the Slytherin’s typical mask quickly covered it up. His voice, however, was especially cool as he sneered in response, “Trust me, Potter, I would love nothing more. But I’d rather be rid of you because I did my job right and the culprit’s caught than because you’re
Draco barked an entirely mirthless laugh, and it echoed off the cold, bare walls of the interrogation room. “Are you, now? So you didn’t point-blank refuse to give up your accomplice yesterday, because, and I quote, it’s ‘simply too much fun watching us squirm’? Was that your evil twin who said that?
Blaise ignored the comment which was, again, very un-Blaise-like and, again, very unsettling. He said simply, “Good. Now, remember what you just promised.”
together, by Salazar’s beard, as though they were friends. Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy—friends. The concept was so wrong, so absurd, so utterly ridiculous, so incredible and unbelievable and heart-warming and profound, so right in so many ways. Draco had, if only for a moment, had what he’d always wanted, since that first day of First Year, when he’d held out his hand with the very same wish in mind, and been sent crashing back down to earth, to reality, where a Malfoy and a Potter couldn’t possibly be anything but enemies.
And although the fluttery something in his chest had been smothered with fierce determination, with a fire so powerful it took over most of Harry’s mind, the look Draco fixed him with then made him melt just a bit, made his heart skip a beat and his mind go fully and entirely blank.
Potter watched him, mouth slightly agape, but then nodded, and the look of sheer bewilderment still etched into his features made Draco want to shout a someone, preferably Potter. “Alright,” Potter said. “Agreed. Do you, err, need my address?”
The moment their eyes found Harry, the two of them froze.
“I don’t remember.”
. Why, I have half a mind to drag you home myself and put a sticking charm on the bed if that’s what it takes to get you to get some goddamn rest for once in your
At this, the corners of Nic’s mouth quirked upwards a bit. “She was.”
But Harry knew the feeling, knew it far too well, and so he nodded understandingly and said, “Of course. Don’t feel pressured or anything. She just sounded brave, is all I wanted to say.”
living with Draco and holding his hand and kissing him—it didn’t sit well with Harry, to put it mildly.
. But it was still frustrating to know his two best friends simply thought he was overreacting when tomorrow could very well change his life.
He grimaced and pulled up the collar of his shirt, sending the Slytherin a glower over his shoulder. “Do you have to walk so bloody close? Merlin, I swear I’m not going to run away.”
was—so they didn’t deserve his politeness.
But this, right here, right now, kissing the man he loved—it was one thing he could control, one thing the outside world could not take away. Harry may not yet realise the scope of Draco’s feelings, may not understand how serious the situation already was, but
Draco’s heart missed a beat and a surge of alarm trickled down his spine. Something was wrong,
Potter’s face was tight with repressed anger, but Draco finally shook himself from his momentary daze, mentally chastising himself as he pulled his features back into tight infallibility. He stepped forwards, snatching an empty vial from one of the cluttered shelves framing the room and extending it to the shopkeeper, and replied smoothly, “That’d be much appreciated. In here, if you will.”
No, the question Draco couldn’t stop asking himself, hadn’t for years now, was far simpler:
The absence of him was suddenly so intense Harry had already opened his mouth to protest. But after levelling one particularly murderous glare at him, Draco collapsed onto the bed beside Harry, where the latter had already made room for him. The Gryffindor found that, all of a sudden, it didn’t hurt as much to move anymore, not when it meant being able to inhale more of that wintry scent Draco seemed to carry around everywhere he went, despite it currently being the end of summer.
“Well, that’s certainly not the reaction I was going for,” he said. “But I’ll take it. Besides, I suppose I really shouldn’t be surprised, you
“Well.” The blond sighed and raked a hand through his hair, which resulted in remnants of both flour and chocolate sticking to the usually so immaculate silvery blond strands. Harry’s eyes suddenly found the floorboards very interesting indeed. “I went to see my mother yesterday, to see how she was holding up. She essentially told me I could either quit my job as an Auror entirely and move back into the Manor, or haul ass back here and make sure no one tried to murder you in your sleep. And I happen to quite like my job, so I’m afraid it wasn’t much of a decision at all. Afterwards, I didn’t have much to do, seeing as Blaise has to work, and Pansy’s with mum, the latter of which threatened to hex me if I asked her how she was doing one more time. So…chocolate cake it was.” He paused. “Err, I hope you don’t mind me using your kitchen.”
apology, no Slytherin half-arsing it—would likely go a long way.”
For the first time all day, Blaise’s grin completely disappeared. “It’s not new-found and you know it. Look, I realize Potter’s…important to you, but those of us who love you are worried. You woke up a minute ago and now you’re already raring to throw yourself back into danger. You haven’t even considered your mum yet, have you? She’s worried sick. Even came here to see you last night.”
Suddenly, Draco’s hand let go of Harry’s wrist, and Harry exhaled a relieved breath, already shifting to take a big step away from the blond with his weird eyes and weird words and weird…weirdness.
But now was decidedly
But she couldn’t, because she was currently in all likelihood locked in some holding cell under the Ministry, awaiting questioning. After all, the fact that she had been supplying a Death Eater’s accomplice—sorry,
“Ah, yes,” muttered Lavender sarcastically, although she was still grinning. “Because harpsichord players always make for the coolest celebrities.”
“Yeah, actually,” he said. “I do.”
. Harry hadn’t been outside once since the Horrid Hayes-Fiasco, and only Draco, Harry, Hermione and Weasley knew they were dating. Draco hadn’t even told his mother yet, nor Pansy, nor Blaise, though he had no doubt those two would find out sooner rather than later.
This time it was Healer Hodkinson who spoke, looking uncertain. “But—”
Harry grinned and gave Draco’s chocolate-stained hand a little shake. “I hope you realize this means you have to accept my apology. Friends do that sort of thing.”
Draco frowned at him. “You asked, did you not?”
Draco snorted. “And wherever would be the fun in that? Not to mention, I feel like this so-called law of yours should at least extend both ways, it’s hardly fair if—”
However, Narcissa only frowned, eyes once again shifting to Harry, as though uncertain whether or not to say anything in front of him.
“He’ll make a full recovery,” Harry answered instantly, repeating Healer Hodkinson’s words. God knows he’d had the man recite it often enough. “Bunch of bruises and cuts and a mild concussion, but nothing the healers couldn’t take care of. He’ll be out cold for a few more hours, though, sleeping off the healing potions. The main problem was the Moonroot. Yaxley’d coated his dagger with it, and when he cut Draco it seeped into his bloodstream. It was…a close call.” He wasn’t sure he could say much else, not without his voice becoming pitifully strained.
That didn’t stop him from doing it.
Ron stared at him with so many warring emotions Harry couldn’t even begin to place them. It would have taken too much energy anyway, energy Harry at this point in time did not have enough of as it was, so he didn’t even bother trying.
But that’s just it; this wasn’t ‘anyone else’—this was
Harry opened his mouth as if to argue. But then he shut it. Looked down into his lap. Frowned. And finally, gaze still averted, he mumbled, “Fine. But you’re not going to like this.” He sighed. “It’s about your soulmark.”
Thankfully, Draco was already continuing, “Does Granger do all the baking, or do you have any idea how to do this?” He shot a sullen look at the cake batter, which, now that Harry had gotten over his initial shock, he realized was for the most part located
Jennings’ eyebrows went up. “But aren’t you still assigned to Potter?”

this much.
He glanced over at Draco, who still had his wand raised, expression hard. It was obvious he wasn’t exactly pleased by Ginny’s sudden and unannounced arrival—neither was Harry, to be perfectly honest. But when their eyes met, the Slytherin sighed, motioning for the door.
because he knew Harry would never be his. It was wishful thinking, but Draco would much rather spend the afternoon daydreaming than fretting about a possible third assassination attempt.
Christ.
Well.
“If anyone isn’t deserving here, it’s me of you. Haven’t you forgotten, you’re a Malfoy! The best of the best, purest of the pure, most superior of the superior. You’re practically wizarding royalty. An arrogant, pretentious toff through and through.” Harry grinned, dropping his hand long enough to squeeze Draco’s. “Except I wouldn’t have it any other way, because you’re
For a moment, all Draco could do was stare, and today truly was the most horrific day in his life, because who had decided it would be
Draco inhaled deep, centring himself. “Okay. Fine. We’ll start at the beginning, then. So, essentially, a soulmate-bond in its most basic form is two people with two matching magical cores, right? This doesn’t necessarily mean the extent of their magical power is identical. It just means their cores fit together, sort of like puzzle pieces. But for a soulmate-bond to flourish, there also needs to be a certain level of emotional understanding between the two parties.”
Draco huffed and flicked his wand at the cake batter, magically adding the eggs, like he should have done from the beginning. “It’s not that bad,” he muttered under his breath.
Instantly, his eyes widened as he looked down to find his feet suddenly kicking and flailing about in what Harry liked to think of as the best performance of a Dancing Feet Spell since…well,
“You know what,” he said, wrapping his arms around the Gryffindor, “I think I’ll go with option two and just continue to stare at you.”
yet, but surely those would come.
He cleared his throat, and Harry could only stare in amazement, because Draco didn’t look angry anymore, he didn’t even look frustrated—he looked, simply put, exhausted.
Draco opened his mouth. Closed it. Opened it again. “I—thank you, Granger. And…” He swallowed hard. “And I’m sorry. Truly.”
Draco glared at Yaxley, who simply smiled back.
“Oh, shut up.” He tried to sound annoyed, but it didn’t quite work, not when his cheeks were flushed so spectacularly. “You know what, forget I ever said anything, it really doesn’t matter.”
Harry grinned slightly. “Oh really? You sure about that, Mr. Bodyguard?”
the idea of someone else being there for Draco throughout it all, throughout life, watching their children grow up and then ultimately growing old together.
At that, Pansy’s face lifted again, and she hurried over to give Draco a quick peck on the cheek. “Oh, chin up, lover boy. It’ll all work out, just you wait.”
“You want Thai, Malfoy?” Harry called over his shoulder. His stomach was already grumbling furiously, and although he’d only been at St. Mungo’s for a day, he was still eager to eat something that wasn’t, well, hospital food.
“Yes,” Draco said stiffly. “Yes, he has. Do you understand now why it’s of the utmost importance you get home immediately?”
The thought that Draco had once loved this mysterious someone whose name would forever be etched into the skin of his right wrist made Harry want to break something, especially knowing how much pain this nameless, faceless tosser had inflicted on Harry’s boyfriend, if that very first conversation over breakfast all those weeks ago was anything to go by.
Never in his life had a single sentence sounded so utterly right.
He did not, however, back off. If anything, Harry had the feeling he drew even closer, matching Harry’s pace with ease. It made Harry’s cheeks flush and his heart do very bizarre things indeed.

“Enough.”
Harry braced himself for a glare, but the moment Harry spoke, Nic’s posture lost a bit of its edge, and the man smiled, evidently relieved. “Oh, hey Harry. Sorry for intruding. Parvati said she’d talked to you, and since you weren’t replying to any of my owls, I thought might as well drop by.”

He needn’t have worried however, because at that moment Draco himself seemed to realise what exactly he was doing—staring at Harry Potter with

Hayes had stiffened as well. “Yes? Is something wrong?”
Silence fell over the table.
Draco breathed a laugh. “Salazar, Harry,
Granger merely shrugged. “Then you just have to show him you two suit each other better.” A small smile broke out across her lips. “Plus, an apology—and I mean a
“Yes,” breathed Draco immediately, voice nothing but a whisper. Out of the corner of his eye, he could see Weasley nod frantically, blue eyes hauntingly wide, while both Blaise and Ginevra remained quiet and still as a statue.
for Harry as well.
And without waiting for Harry’s response—because Draco wouldn’t put it past the git to stay out in the rain just to spite him—he once again gripped Harry’s hand, ignoring both the Gryffindor’s smothered gasp and the pleasant zap of warmth the touch sent up his arm, and dragged the other man up the front steps.
Now, Draco had never been especially fond of the second youngest Weasley before. But right then, seeing the fierce protectiveness glinting in the ginger’s blue eyes, the undying loyalty to Harry, who deserved all the love and affection in the world…
“Yes,” said Draco dryly, but he was grinning again, a beam so huge and bright it made Harry’s heart melt all over again. “I gathered as much.”
The alleyway was oddly dark for such a bright mid-August afternoon, and Harry could feel chills race up his arms despite the sweltering weather as he slowly crept further down the alley, gaze never leaving the figure, not for a second.
you. I can tell when something’s wrong. Like right now, for example.”
The stranger uttered an entirely mirthless laugh, and it sent goosebumps hurtling up Draco’s arms.
Harry stopped walking, and when Malfoy realized this, he, too, came to a standstill, looking nervous as he glanced from the ground to Harry and back.
Granger blinked and glanced up at him, her dark brown eyes assessing as they studied his. Draco had no idea what she saw there, whether what she found was an answer to her unspoken question, whether said answer was good or bad or something in between.
Harry didn’t even care that he was staring at Draco again, not when everyone else was as well. Besides, it warmed something in Harry’s chest to see the prideful Slytherin so open for once, open and…vulnerable. For him to apologize and admit he’d been in the wrong and genuinely mean every word of it.
“No. Harm. Done.” Her voice was like steel on steel, grating and unforgiving. “
The stranger shook his head. “No. There are no other ways to go about it. There is only the one, and this here is it. But I wouldn’t expect the likes of you to understand.”
We’re slowly but surely nearing the end of this beast of a fic. To everyone who’s still here, reading, leaving kudos and/or commenting: I LOVE YOU WITH ALL MY HEART. Y’all make life bearable.
To Draco’s right, Pansy slurped loudly at her cappuccino, the black-lacquered pinkie of her right hand hoisted into the air as though the three of them were at one of her mother’s infamous tea parties instead of a packed, poorly lit, not to mention
Which Pansy, that she-devil, naturally commented on with a bright, “Salazar, Draco, you are
“Whatever do you mean?” The git had the audacity to sound bored.
“You were supposed to

Blaise, ever the composed gentleman, answered immediately, voice calm, “I work here. What are
But then there was also…something else. A pensive sort of something, like a deja-vu moment, only ten times stronger.
Harry scowled at him but, honestly, how was Draco supposed to take the man seriously when he was looking like
“What.
Instead, though, he repeated his earlier question, “What letter are we talking about here?”
And, with one last worried frown in Harry’s direction, Ron did.
“Unfortunately, no,” she said to Blaise, still grinning. “Not quite there yet, I’m afraid. Give it another week or so.”
Both Jennings and his partner had already started talking again, their expressions absolutely livid. Draco didn’t listen. Instead, his eyes bored into Philomena Craigs, and when he strode forwards, back straight, shoulders back, ever the haughty pureblood heir he’d been brought up to become, the shopkeeper’s eyes immediately swivelled to him. As did, he noticed, the eyes of everyone else in the room. But he didn’t give himself time to appreciate the attention, for when Draco spoke, his voice was cold as ice. Colder.
Harry was busy making himself a cheese sandwich when the Floo sounded.
It was like a Crucio, only ten, twenty, thirty times worse, and instead of rippling through his entire body, from his head to his feet, it remained focused solely on his stomach-area, burning his skin and clawing out his intestines and ripping him to pieces second by second.
that I said all those sappy things, Potter, I swear I’ll—”
—whatever the fuck
Harry could feel his own heart split in two, and he reached out before he could even make the conscious decision to do so, intwining the fingers of his right hand with Draco’s. The latter looked up, surprised, but his expression softened almost immediately as their gazes interlocked.
Quite the contrary, Draco knew that, while Harry didn’t love him, not yet, there were undoubtedly feelings of some sort there—otherwise Harry wouldn’t have allowed yesterday to happen. And that knowledge alone was enough to make him burst into a smile all over again.
Was he?
Not for the first or the last time, Harry wished he had Hermione’s brilliant intellect or Ron’s great judgement or Draco’s quick-witted ingenuity, or even just the necessary intelligence to be able to string together a halfway-decent sentence without five minutes of stammering preparation beforehand.
that had, seconds later, morphed into the three words Draco had tried his entire life to avoid thinking about. The name he’d somehow, deep, deep down, known would appear on his wrist that day, a name he’d heard so often over the past nine years any rational person should be sick of it by now. Except Draco was known to oftentimes be quite irrational.
Under the sheer cataclysm of relief that flooded him at that moment, making him feel light-headed and giddy, Draco felt like either laughing hysterically or just flat-out sobbing.
“Well, surprise,” said Harry, grinning. A grin that only widened when Draco pulled a face, making him laugh. “And here I thought you’d be glad to see I did, in fact,
Draco was sure his ribcage cracked a bit under that mesmerising gaze, under the concern therein, and he pushed the crushing intensity of it into another dizzying kiss.
Parkinson made a sound halfway between a gag and a scoff. “One more word, Malfoy, and I’ll go after you with a kitchen knife myself.”
Harry crossed the living room to grab a biro, all the while chuckling despite himself, and penned a quick letter to Robards, telling him about Malfoy’s family connections to Craigs, and requesting they tag along. He conveniently left out all mention of Malfoy’s hesitance, making sure to emphasize what an asset the Slytherin would be to the investigation. When he was done, he folded it and headed back towards where the barn owl was still sitting more or less patiently by the windowsill.
Salazar, he thought wryly, wouldn’t that be a hilarious image.
just to apologize, Potter.”
Draco didn’t know why the wheel of fortune had decided to align their fates, why he was destined to love someone he really shouldn’t, why he had let himself fall so hard. He doubted there was a proper answer to any of those questions anyway.
, to show Ron just how much those words meant to him. His throat felt oddly constricted, and his eyes burned.
“Harry Roacher. Cockroach Potter. Does have a nice ring to it, doesn’t it?”
“And that Craigs woman!” she continued exasperatedly. “Before, I’d have said she must have purposefully withheld Yaxley’s identity when you went to question her, Harry. Only I’ve seen her memories of the Acturin-deal, and there really was no recognizing him. It could have just as easily been you or me. So, either he’s gotten incredibly skilled at Disillusionment Charms, or he’s got a stash of Polyjuice. Which, when you think about it, is so much more concerning, because that means he could come waltzing in here disguised as Healer Hodkinson and we’d not know to be alarmed until Harry’s slumped dead in his chair!”
Sometimes you just want to murder your flatmate/sort-of-bodyguard/maybe-friend-but-evidently-not-really-because-friends-don’t-act-like-that-or-judge-you-or-make-you-feel-so-bloody-awful. Right? Happens to everyone.
So, yeah, while pointed glares and switching topics usually saved him from too many awkward conversations and less-than-subtle attempts to set him up with Seamus' sister's boyfriend's ex or whoever it was this time...well, suffice to say Harry knew none of that would save him tomorrow.
And although Pansy refrained from commenting—thank Salazar for small mercies—the way her dark eyes danced with blatant glee overtop the rim of her mug conveyed her thoughts quite sufficiently.
What an odd experience,
And then, before Draco could so much as form another thought, the man pushed at his manacle, pushed and pushed until his skin was red and scuffed, and Draco momentarily panicked, sure Yaxley would somehow escape now, and it’d be on Draco for letting him, for just sitting there, and Harry—
. I’ll end up jumping out of the window myself before they’re caught.” And then an idea came to him. “Look, what if I ask Robards? If he says no, I’ll stay here and won’t utter another word on the subject.” Malfoy snorted incredulously, but Harry persisted. “I promise. You won’t hear a single more complaint from me. At least, err, concerning Renaults and Co.
can manage to entertain himself for three whole days, then I’m sure you’ll manage for an hour, Pans.”
Draco grimaced faintly, but it looked so ridiculous Harry could only laugh.
A beat of silence ensued, and Harry found it unusually difficult to read Nic’s expression. He’d expected anger of some kind, after all, it was Nic Harry was on the date with Draco had so vociferously disapproved of. Plus, he’d never gotten the impression Nic much liked Draco, apology notwithstanding.
They’d been in the pub now for a few hours at least, both currently nursing their third, maybe fourth, Butterbeer—Draco hadn't had this much sugar since he was
“Ginny,” he said wearily, “can you please just tell me what’s going on? Please? If you do, I might be able to help y—”
of that bastard. “Funnily enough, that’s none of your business—”
It had taken his mother and friends an entire hour of comforting and coaxing to get Draco to unlock the door and let in his mother, and only his mother. He’d silently held out his wrist for her to read, still feeling far too nauseous to utter a single word. But he hadn’t needed to. She’d taken one look at the clumsily written name and proceeded to envelop him in a bone-crushing hug the likes of which Draco hadn’t even been sure his mother was still capable of, whispering again and again that it was alright, he’d be alright, everything was alright.
“Well,” said Draco at long last, and Harry chanced a glance up into his face, only to find the Slytherin’s eyes shining something fierce as they in turn regarded him. “In any case, I suppose I should thank you, then. After all, it’s not every day the Boy Who Lived Twice compliments cold-hearted, corrupt ex-Death-Eaters such as myself.” He said it with a grin, but something in Harry, something deep and fierce and fiery, bristled at the words.
Harry snorted, shaking his head. “Of which humility clearly isn’t one.”
“What?” asked Harry, and Draco turned to see him standing in the exact spot he’d left him, arms crossed, looking disastrously handsome in all his early-morning glory, a gentle smile coasting across his lips as he regarded Draco with what could only be interpreted as affection.
Draco shifted in his seat right beside Harry, practically pressed against his side, and at least had the decency to look guilty as he answered, “I, err, might have written Lucius a letter the other day.”
The man’s answering scowl was immediate, and Draco found himself silently pleased at how easily and effectively he’d distracted the redhead with only a single vaguely snide comment.
“And?” Draco could hardly breathe anymore; his lungs stopped working, his airways constricted, his chest felt like it was being squeezed to death by his own ribcage.
Harry fixed Hermione with a small but utterly genuine smile. It was a little sad, but when Hermione looked up, the way her shoulders relaxed, a sliver of tension leaving her misleadingly dainty form, made it instantly worth it. “We’ll get through this, Mione. We got Yaxley imprisoned once; we’ll do it again. Besides, after Voldemort, he’s nothing.”
“They can stay.” Harry gritted his teeth in an effort to keep from yelling the words.
Hayes, still tense, simply nodded. “Yeah. See you around.”
Malfoy still had that indecipherable look in his eyes, but he shook his head and barked a small laugh nevertheless. “Fine. But if you ever say a word to
And yet, he hesitated.
“The blade’s laced with poison, of course,” said Yaxley then, his tone matter-of-fact but laced with definite glee. “I quite like poisons, as I’m sure you’ve realized by now. Death by curse is too quick, and personally torturing people was never quite my style. Don’t like getting my hands dirty, you see, much like your father, Draco. But poison…” Yaxley gave another crazed chuckle. “Poison will do all the hard work for you, and all you have to do is simply administer it and sit back and enjoy the show.”
It couldn’t take
And just like that, Draco’s senses returned, and he opened his mouth to shoot back an insult of his own. But before he had the chance, Robards fixed Weasley with a glare so scathing even the hot-headed Gryffindor winced. “Auror Weasley, that is
“You’re doing it again.”
Again, Harry was happy for them. But that did nothing to reduce his own fears. Because, unlike Ron and Hermione, he hadn’t met his soulmate at age eleven, promptly becoming inseparable for the rest of their lives. And there really was no guarantee Harry would ever meet someone like that, someone who was his better half and he theirs. So Harry’s stomach constricted tighter every time his thoughts started to wander in that direction.
Anyway, I am SO sorry I didn’t update for a whole month, life was just particularly chaotic. I’m not going to go into detail, but it was 1) a shit-ton of school-induced stress, 2) an even bigger shit-ton of family-induced stress, and 3) all in all a really, really horrible time for my mental health. But things are looking up rn (I’m hoping) and I’ve finally had some time to write. Yayyyyy!
,” he repeated, “Potter is such a confused, oblivious mess that I doubt he’d realise my feelings for him aren’t just platonic if I whacked him over the head with it. Trust me, it’s a real, legitimate issue of his.” Draco couldn’t help but be reminded of that very morning, when Nic The Bastard had showed up and almost driven Draco to murder before he’d even gotten his morning coffee.
. Was that really so fucking impossible a task? You couldn’t send one of your five dozen other siblings to babysit? You had to drag Harry into it?”
Hayes gaze dropped to their intertwined hands, and his mouth twitched, but he said nothing.
“Okay, I think he gets it!” exclaimed Harry, voice much higher and squeakier than normal, and Draco laughed as the Gryffindor’s face once again flushed to match the walls.
Hermione didn’t speak to Draco, didn’t even glance at him for longer than a second as she and Weasley passed him on their way out of the kitchen. But in that split-second that her eyes met his, the knowing look and message woven therein could not have been more obvious:
Deep breaths.
He leaned forwards and pressed the softest of kisses onto Harry’s lips, light and chaste, the exact opposite of all the confessional, claiming ones of the evening before. The latter started in surprise, green eyes wide as they lifted to Draco’s, but once again he didn’t pull away, not even a fraction of an inch.
“And I first.” Harry just grinned wider at the death glare Draco shot him and shrugged. “Just putting it out there.”
was why he never dated—he was bloody awful at it.
Harry blinked in surprise, nearly dropping his chocolate. “Really?”
“But, honestly, fuck it,” said the Slytherin, voice hoarse. “Here goes nothing. Harry, you should know, I’m—”
His name.
Harry drew back abruptly, lips still tingling faintly, and said weakly, “But the Thai…”
Harry could only stare. Eventually, he got out, “Why…why are you telling me all this?”
“Well yes…” But for some reason the thought of Draco, quote unquote, ‘not taking it particularly well’ made Harry’s heart do all sorts of ridiculous, absurd things, made him feel oddly light-headed.
Naturally—because when had things ever been even remotely easy for Draco—Pansy heard. At that point, her smile was so wide it was a wonder her whole face didn’t collapse under the strain.
Draco was certain he must have misheard the man. Because this couldn’t be the same bloke that had interrupted them that first night at the pub just to bat his eyes at the Boy Who Lived for thirty minutes straight, who’d come to their flat with the sole intention of flirting with him and giving him a basket of bloody
“Draco, who is—” Harry began as he made his way into the living room.
“And here I thought you were just glaring at me so hatefully because you didn’t like my shirt.”
Those were all true, suitable responses, and Draco knew he should just pull himself together and tell Harry already, get over his irrational fears and confess to the one person he wanted to tell the truth to most.
Draco gave a snort at that, but Harry steadfastly ignored the blond, instead smiling at Nic and nodding. “Will do. Thanks again.”
“Well, Ginevra,” Draco said in his most cool and level tone and offered her his most toothy smile. “There’s a reason for that.”
Draco blinked pathetically.
“Hiya Harry,” said Parvati cheerily, and Harry realized he’d been staring rather mystified at where Ginny still stood awkwardly, half-hidden behind Lavender and Parvati.
Harry’s. Soulmate.
Neither spoke for a long, long moment. Draco still wouldn’t move from his spot at the other end of the bed, and Harry didn’t dare speak, didn’t dare breathe too loud lest he somehow scare the other man away. It seemed a genuine possibility, too, what with the Slytherin’s wide, almost haunted-looking eyes, raking over every inch of Harry’s skin as though half-expecting him to fade away any second.
This—finally—elicited a real reaction. “You? Cooler than me?” The Slytherin scoffed, eyes incredulous and disgusted and haughty, and Harry could only grin wider. “You
“Know what?” Draco scrunched up his nose. “And quit looking at me like that. I’m not a pureblood, remember?”
“I suppose that answers my question,” the blond said with a little laugh, and the sound of it, light and smooth and as elegant as the rest of him, set something in Harry’s chest into motion, something soft and fluttery that wouldn’t stop squirming.
“They’re likely still working on him,” he warned, but Draco didn’t care.
The man inclined his head, and then, without another word or glance in Draco’s direction, turned on his heel and walked away.
Draco hummed softly, and Harry couldn’t tell whether it was a hum of contemplation or approval or delight, not without looking back into those piercing, soul-shredding eyes of his. And that was, very decidedly,
,” Pansy cooed into her coffee with a snort, smirk positively Cheshire, but both Draco and Harry ignored her.
When Draco hesitated, the stranger hissed in indignation, and for a split-second the pressure of the wand disappeared—except, before Draco could so much as move a muscle, two jets of green light blasted into the ground just inches away from his feet, causing the dark, rotting floorboards to shatter and spray chunks of wood in all directions.
.” She shuddered, and whether it was simply for emphasis, because god knows Slytherins always had to be melodramatic, or due to genuine bone-deep revulsion, Harry couldn’t tell.
“Hey, err, Malfoy, right?”
Three heads and six eyes swivelled to face Harry, all equally shocked by the sudden outburst.
Draco grinned and answered, because Harry was obviously still too mortified to do so, “Yes. Yes, you should have.”
Draco’s gaze travelled around the room. From his vantage point behind the desk, he could only see half of the office, with the door located on the exact opposite side of the room. And with Yaxley currently situated in the middle, that was one exit eliminated.
Said fit imbecile turned to Draco with that confused look that simultaneously made the Slytherin want to strangle and kiss him. Prick. “Why didn’t you Apparate us into the flat?”
“A few blocks,” Ron muttered darkly under his breath. “It was far more than
It was a challenge, of sorts, and judging by Malfoy’s narrowed eyes, he realized that, too. But he pursed his lips and, for the second time that day, took Harry’s hand. His fingers were cold, but when he briefly shook Harry’s hand, that same feeling of content came washing back over the dark-haired Gryffindor.
He subconsciously run a trembling hand through his hair yet again, scowling when he realized he must have already completely messed up the hairstyle he’d spent an hour that morning meticulously perfecting. But it was too late now, seeing as he’d already raked his hands through it more times than he could count.
. “It’s lovely to finally meet you, Harry. Properly, this time.”
It was probably stupid, he knew that. Nothing but pesky, irrational nerves, dialled up to the maximum after one particularly sleepless night. He hadn’t gotten more than two or three hours in, and although Draco had become well-accustomed to such circumstances since the war, something still felt off. Only he couldn’t quite put his finger on what, and that grated on his nerves to no end.
Jennings began, “Now, see here—”
And yet here he lay, for once wholly and utterly at peace.
, this something they had right now—it wasn’t so bad either.
Not that Harry would ever dare voice such thoughts aloud. Merlin, if he did, it wouldn’t matter one bit that he was her best friend’s soulmate—Pansy would skin him alive.
Draco, too, started in surprise, smile slipping as worry clouded over his face instead. “Shit, is the pain starting back up again? I can go get one of the Healers if you want, I can—”
“Nuh-uh-uh,” the brunet said, tutting. “None of that. Behave yourself.” He leaned forwards, eyes raking over Harry’s arm. A frown overtook his pallid face, and while, at first, Harry was confused, it dawned on him just as Nic said, “Still just a D? I must admit, I’m disappointed, Harry. I thought you two would have worked things out by now.”
“That…was absolutely horrible.” Draco shook his head, trying to look aghast, but failing miserably because he couldn’t stop laughing. But it was worth it to see Harry’ grin, restored back to its normal intensity. “Shame on you, Potter.”
Both his and Nic’s eyes shifted to where Draco still sat, straight-backed and glaring. A glare that only intensified under the combined weight of their stares. But at least he didn’t say anything cruel, instead simply narrowing his eyes and tapering his lips and huffing contemptuously.
“Oh, err, well,” said Healer Hodkinson, “maybe not
“He’s fine, I’m positive,” he said, hoping his voice sounded as calm and unaffected to Granger as he meant it to. “I can’t tell you where he is exactly, whether he’s in his room or out with
And although, judging by the way Harry drank merrily from his Butterbeer, afterwards wiping his mouth with his sleeve and launching into some conversation Draco was only barely aware of, the Gryffindor likely hadn’t put much thought into that last word—
Harry blinked at him in silence for a long, long moment.
There was another wave of silence, and when Draco looked up and saw Potter looking at him thoughtfully, a sad frown tugging at his lips, he—not for the first time—wished he could make that frown disappear instead of always causing it.
Nic blinked, surprised. “Yeah, owls. I sent, like, ten letters, give or take? I just thought I ought to explain myself regarding the other night.” His mouth tugged into a pensive frown. “You didn’t get any letters? At all?”
At least it was the weekend, Draco mused as he waited more or less patiently for Pansy to finish trying on clothes. He’d been waiting outside the fitting room for what seemed like hours now, and while his patience was far greater than, say, a certain Gryffindor’s with messy hair and a lightning scar, sitting there with nothing to do but stare at the dresses Pansy had thrown out and try to determine just by looking at them which was the most expensive pushed even his tolerance.
And so, when Draco looked up to see none other than Corban Yaxley staring down at him, those familiar dark eyes blazing, all he could do was gape up at him in horror and shock.
a lot—of work, sometimes even inordinately so. They demanded a certain type of awareness, a harmony of sorts between two separate, different people, one that was neither easily gained nor maintained.
, Harry was sure of it—made him, if possible, even more gorgeous in Harry’s not-so-humble opinion. Especially when it clouded over the worry, the fear, the tension, clouding over and replacing them.
“Thank you.”
“And you can’t remember going to Diagon Alley with Mr. Weasley?” asked Healer Preedan.
Draco set his jaw.
But Draco had given up too easily last time. He’d taken it as a personal affront and sulked and pouted and decided that, if he couldn’t have Potter’s friendship, he’d secure the boy’s attention some other way.
Save for a twitch in the corner of his mouth, Draco didn’t react at all. He just stood there with all his annoying three-inches-taller-than-Harry-ness and stupid silver eyes. This only soured Harry’s mood further, and he shouldered past the blond with perhaps just a tad bit too much force, making him stumble a step.
And yet.
“Sorry, sorry,” Harry said and loosened his death-grip around his water glass. “My mind’s a million miles away. What were we talking about again?”
Healer Preedan, though, was still frowning. “I really don’t think—”
“—you’d be home by six. Yes, yes, I heard you the first time,” Pansy quipped, smoothing out her black bob as she studied her reflection in the mirror, eyes narrowed critically.
And he did. Usually, the colouring of Nic’s skin was similar to Harry’s, if perhaps a few shades lighter. But right now, in the dark of the alleyway, where not even the warm, golden rays of summer sun could reach them, Nic was practically as white as a sheet, with dark smudges discolouring the area right below his eyes, making him seem years older and wearier than he actually was, beads of sweat unmistakable as they trickled down his brow.
“Yes, well,” Harry said dryly, “it didn’t exactly come with instructions.”
Draco pursed his lips. Under the watery glow of the streetlamps, the sharp angles of his face were even more defined than usual, and Harry couldn’t help but think he looked rather ethereal.
When the Slytherin drew back again, his smile was even brighter, and Harry couldn’t help but grin as well; it wasn’t his fault Draco’s smiles were so infectious.
Even through the dark and with the black cloak, Draco could make out the crimson red staining the man’s robes as he lay motionless in the broken shop window. Draco knew he himself was likely not much better off, but he ignored the pain, shoving it to the back of his mind, focusing instead on the man in the shop window. He would bet his favourite pair of dragonhide boots this was the same man who’d used the Acturin to nearly kill Harry on his birthday.
For a brief moment, there was silence. No more bursts of colour shot through the air, no more cabinets were blown to pieces. For a moment, the wrecked interior of Renaults and Co. was at peace.
Draco showed no reaction. Harry didn’t know whether to interpret this as a good thing or a bad thing. He simply sat there and impaled Nic with that glare of his, and if it weren’t for the slight occasional twitch of dislike at the corners of Draco’s mouth, Harry might have guessed someone had put a Full Body-Bind on the Slytherin. Harry inwardly sighed. This was going to take a while.
Harry cleared his throat, deciding enough was enough. “Right then, about Draco—”
Then all hell broke loose.
“Honestly,” Weasley continued, sounding utterly exhausted, as though Harry and Draco had singlehandedly taken ten years off his life, “I guess I sort of did. I’m not sure why I’m even surprised right now, you were both extremely obvious about it. Bloody
“Well shit.”
Draco had the audacity—
He needed to stay calm.
“So,” said Pansy, rolling her stiletto-clad ankle. “How much longer until the Healers get here to do their final check-up? Didn’t you say they were supposed to be here by noon? We’ve been waiting for an hour at the very least. I’m
He didn’t care they weren’t alone, that there were other people in the room, most of which had no idea that Draco was Harry’s boyfriend and Harry his, most of which weren’t supposed to know, lest they go running to the Daily Prophet and the news be all over Britain by tomorrow morning.
, it’s Healer Preedan during work hours. And as for you, Mr. Potter”—those dark, razor-sharp eyes focused on Harry, and he instinctively winced. Yes, McGonagall indeed—“you are far from healed. I’d advise you to abstain from any further attempted feats of strength. Otherwise, so mark my words, you’ll be staying in this hospital for the next two weeks.”
Harry shook his head. “Sorry, sorry. I’m fine now, really, just…still recovering, it seems.”
A dull ache, sort of like an echo.
He strode across the kitchen, steps large and purposeful, and before either of them could so much as utter another word, he had captured Harry’s face in his hands and was kissing him again, kissing him with all the intensity of the unsaid words and unspoken emotions crowding his head, the chaotic mess of thoughts and fears and worries pushing and shoving at him and refusing to let go.
Pansy grinned mischievously. “What can I say? I’m just too good at this.” But then her eyes found Draco’s through the mirror, and that grin turned into a concerned frown. “How are you holding up, by the way? You know, what with tomorrow being you-know-who’s birthday.”
Harry stood frozen, unsure and, quite frankly, unable to move, to react. Because surely if he said something, that’d ruin this, right? Whatever
But not all the Gryffindors were merrily conversing by the fireplace. The Girl-Weasel hadn’t stopped glowering at him darkly since his friendly little bickering with Harry. And although some part of Draco preened at the notion of Harry’s ex-girlfriend being jealous due to something
Oh Salazar.
Harry nodded, and out of the corner of his eye he saw Malfoy’s scowl deepen, though he couldn’t for the love of Merlin say why. Harry was
I accept your apology,” Draco continued, oblivious to Harry’s disbelief. “How could I not, after you put so much effort into it. Writing all those letters—such a regrettable loss—and then coming here yourself. And, oh, it looks like you baked something, too. What a thoughtful request for forgiveness.”
“Malfoy!” he shouted, a grin already twisting its way across his face. “Malfoy, come here. Robards wrote!”
“No,” Harry bit out. He didn’t, however, pull away or make any signs of dissent, so Draco continued peppering him with kisses, one for every day he’d spent wishing he could but ultimately refraining.
Harry clenched his jaw and jutted his chin out defiantly. “No.”
, regardless of how strongly you may believe the opposite. So, when I joined the Dark Lord and she disapproved, I knew I needed to cut her loose. She was always too much of a muggle-lover anyway, wanted to ‘fight for what’s right’.” His eyes glinted jet-black. “Carlota was much like Potter, in that regard. I believe she would have even joined Dumbledore’s Order, if given the chance.”
He just
But then she, too gave a curt nod. “Just wanted to make sure he was alright. He seemed to have everything under control, and then Nic came by and. Well.” She didn’t elaborate, and Draco would have been thankful for that, were it not for her piercing, relentless gaze, the type that penetrated a person’s very soul, exposing every and all of one’s secrets.
, after all, Draco didn’t know the man, nor did he find himself particularly keen on getting to know him ever—hadn’t even glanced Draco’s way once since coming over to their table, interrupting a perfectly good conversation.
Harry’s mouth formed a perfect O, and any other time Draco would have spent minutes on end marvelling about the sheer brilliance of his green eyes. But there was no room for awe inside him, not under the combined weight of the panic and horror and
to see the two of them actually getting along for once wasn’t unexpected.
should have made Draco move, snap out of whatever daze he was suspended in, leave the cell, leave the Ministry. Go back to Harry, take him where no one could reach them, no one at all. “Something I think you’ll find very interesting indeed.”
Ron was wearing his scarlet Auror robes, which, as Ginny had always loved to point out (before she started avoiding Harry like the plague, of course) clashed horribly with his hair, while Hermione’s hair on the other hand looked even frizzier than normal, as though she’d only just rolled out of bed. Which, Harry thought as he took in his friends’ bleary-eyed faces, actually seemed entirely possible.
“We met once before a few weeks back,” the man said. “Right here, as a matter of fact, investigating the Acturin deal. Name’s Jennings.” When Draco still didn’t react, the man added awkwardly, “I apprenticed under Joachim Heind?”
Draco groaned. “I thought you were kidding! You’re not seriously considering having Potter accompany us? A group that consists of exclusively Slytherins? Who he hated all through school?”
He only later realised Draco had never actually answered his question.
“I’m sorry,” whispered Draco, strangled and broken. “Oh Merlin, I’m so, so sorry, Harry. I shouldn’t have—”
Fortunately, there was no mention of what else had occurred that night, nor of Potter’s brief stay at St. Mungo’s. Draco was glad the press hadn’t gotten wind of it. With Potter’s would-be murderer still running loose, such coverage would do far more damage than any actual good.
Draco didn’t need to look down; he already knew the sight that would await him. But Harry didn’t, and so his eyes went comically wide as he gaped down at Pansy’s wrist, at the name written thereon, irritation forgotten.
A rattling sounded, like chains clinking against each other, and sure enough, Yaxley’s hands, previously hidden beneath the metal table, lifted until they lay in the free space between them, wrists adorned with thick, silver manacles.
arrogant, pretentious toff, and the Gryffindor intended to keep it that way for as long as Draco would have him.
Draco’s lips twisted into a frown nonetheless, and he glanced back towards the still closed door. A short pause ensued, until Blaise spoke again, this time sounding much more cautious. “Are you, err…are you alright?”
could have seen—
“Now,” the voice said softly, but the increased pressure of the wand digging into Draco’s skin betrayed their calm. “Drop the wand now—or else.”
And before the stranger had even finished speaking, Draco was flung backwards, and the world went dark around him.
. You say that now, Potter, only because you’ve never met Philomena Craigs before.” He lifted his chin slightly, sniffing primly. “And, just so you know, I am a very adventurous individual when I want to be. Just ask Pansy.”
, all crooked but perfect in its imperfection.
“Now,” Harry gritted out. “Please.”
Harry pivoted in his seat to glower up at Draco with all his might, because what the ever-loving fuck gave the git the impression he could just barge in here—while Harry was on a
“—you alright, Harry? Harry?”
His eyes narrowed at Draco and he wrenched his right sleeve down further. “Why does everyone care so much about my bloody soulmark? Everyone has them, right? So why make such a fuss about mine!”
Draco chuckled despite himself. Out of all Harry’s friends, he’d always been fondest of Granger. Although it had infuriated him to no end back at Hogwarts, she truly was the smartest witch he knew and one of the smartest people, period. But it warmed his heart to know that Harry had someone like her to take care of him when the Gryffindor was too busy saving the world to do it himself.
Either Hayes was pretending not to care, or something else was going on here. Either way, though, the bastard was acting suspicious, and Draco didn’t like it one bit.
There were bandages across his chest, and he was in a semi-comfortable bed, staring up at a ceiling so clean and white and bleak he had to be in a hospital room. The dull memory of pain still crackled through his body, and when he tried to sit up, spots instantly engulfed his vision, forcing him to lay back down, head buzzing.
But the man was too late, Draco thought with bitter triumph as the flames rose higher and higher and the office started to blur. And then Draco could feel the familiar tug in his stomach, and the office faded away, and—
Except then the light froze and solidified, started shrinking and shaping into a small, winged creature, hazy at the edges but indisputably recognisable as a Patronus.
But tomorrow, Draco knew, was Potter’s twentieth birthday. And, just like that, all those worries resurfaced again.
Immediately, both Healers’ gazes snapped back to him. But he didn’t care; Harry had a whole list of things to worry about right now and, needless to say, being polite was not at the top of it.
Just to be clear, Draco was
Harry looked so frazzled, so utterly
Then again, he’d just made a painfully sincere apology to said pack of loud, obnoxiously chatty Gryffindors, so his sanity was bound to be called into question anyway.
now. You don’t. Ergo, I’m cooler than you.” He cocked his head to the side. “I thought you said you liked it yesterday? The earring, I mean.”
Draco lifted an eyebrow. “Still an evil Death Eater?”
Blaise chuckled softly. “Wouldn’t dream of it.”
Draco huffed something under his breath, glare boring menacingly into the mattress, but Harry wasn’t concerned.
from a Ministry holding cell. Least of all people with direct ties to one dead Dark Lord, people who killed without a second thought, without remorse—people whose names were
Draco grumbled something under his breath, but one look at the blond and Harry was once again surprised to find such obvious affection shining bright in those silver eyes, lighting up his whole face, softening its usually sharp and angular edges into something far more gentle.
that? Of course I was out of line! Everything we’d discussed before, the progress we made—I acted like none of it ever happened! Why aren’t you pissed?
A long moment of silence passed, in which Draco seemed to be considering the offer—Harry certainly hoped he was considering the offer—all the while wearing that godawful mask of inscrutability again. Until, eventually, finally, the blond threw up his hands. “You are
, on the other hand, an
“I’ve always known you have the tactfulness of a blundering buffoon, Weasley,” he hissed, “but you spent all those years making sure everyone knows Harry’s your best friend—do at least try to act like it now, will you?”
And Harry was infinitely glad for that fact, because the sight made his heart soar.
“Look,” Harry began, feeling both progressively confused and frustrated, “I really don’t know what you’re talking about. There’s no need to be all cryptic; just tell me why you’re so angry and we can—”
—just like Pansy had said. And, really, that was all that mattered.
What more could he ask for.
Nic, who looked as surprised as Harry but at the same time also incredibly sceptical, opened his mouth, eyes narrowed suspiciously at Draco. But before he could say anything, Harry said, surprised, “You baked?”
Harry could only blink and manage a dazed, “Yeah. Yeah, sure.”
, so, really, Harry’s options on the matter were limited.
Draco narrowed his eyes and replied harshly, gaze interlocked with Harry’s and glinting ever so fiercely, “Frankly, Potter, I would rather eat this bloody book than give your precious Nic another chance.”
Instead, however, Draco nodded earnestly. “Oh, yes, it was. Alas, that’s his hero-complex shining through. Just can’t help it, the poor bloke. But since I’ll likely be staying here for quite some time, I suppose I’ll have to come to terms with it. Might as well do so sooner rather than later.”
Draco grumbled under his breath, “Again: wankers.”
He could have refused, could have told his mother she was being silly, that she’d met Harry plenty times. Except Draco couldn’t bring himself to feign any annoyance, not when he couldn’t even tear his gaze away from the man in question.
Also, I asked myself the other day how long this story's going to be, and it turns out I have no idea. So yeah. Unfortunately, I'm much more of a pantser than a planner. Sorry!
“Draco?” repeated Healer Hodkinson, voice an octave higher. “As in Draco Malfoy? Former Death Eater Draco Malfoy?”
Except he had, and a part of him—a far greater part than he’d ever care to admit—still
Draco gritted his teeth, but instead of letting Yaxley get to him again, he forced himself to concentrate. Compose himself.
Well, fuck.
Nic's blue-eyed gaze jumped to Harry, and he sent him a small grateful smile, one Harry was happy to return. “I was born here in London, actually, but my parents moved to New York when I was three. Mom’s a half-blood, and Dad’s a No-Ma—err, muggle. Lived there until just a few months ago, as a matter of fact. It's beautiful, but London's pretty nice as well." Ah, and there they were again, the dreaded dimples.
But on the other hand—and this was the option that quickly consumed most of his thoughts—Weasley could easily be right. Perhaps this

She didn’t reply for a few seconds. Then, however, she gave a little huff and said, “Enough. More than enough.”

He did not, however, like the way the sneer darkened and twisted Draco’s entire face and made him look chillingly different from the man Harry now thought of as a friend—different, and distressingly similar to the person Harry’d once called an enemy.
when using the Floo.
I want to be your boyfriend.”
The others started supplying names, none of which Harry thought were very probable. Daphne Greengrass, some bloke named Danilo that'd apparently been in Luna and Ginny's year, a fellow Auror named Daisy, Seamus' cousin's friend David.
“So, yes,
The man raised his wand again, this time pointed at Draco, and said, “Everte Statum.”
Wow. Just wow.
“How much?”
—and here you’ve gone and done it in half a week. Good on you. Who knows, maybe in a week or two, you’ll be holding hands. Baby steps, darling.”
Harry forced himself to look away, instead smiling over at Parvati. “Hey, Parvati. Lav, Ron, Mione. Ginny.” He didn’t sound weird or surprised or alarmed in any way. He really didn’t. “What’re you all doing here?”
. You don’t get to act like you care, Malfoy, not again. I actually started trusting you for a minute there, you realise that?
“Several Aurors came to the flat the moment news of Yaxley’s escape broke. Weasley, his partner, a few others. But you weren’t there. And I…I didn’t know where you were, did I, save for the fact that you’d gone on a date with that—with

The reactions were mixed.

Then he shook his head, looking at Draco with such anger and disappointment and
Malfoy again gave a theatre-worthy sigh, but in truth Harry didn’t think the Slytherin was all that annoyed. Much more likely, he was just being his usual overdramatic self, physically unable to

Minutes or hours later, they were both near-wheezing from both breathlessness and restrained laughter. Harry shouted, “Tarantallegra!” and Draco, who’d just hit Harry with an especially devious Tickling Hex and was currently busy laughing himself silly because of it, was hit squarely in the chest.
Him, Harry Potter, worrying about Draco sodding Malfoy.
“The letter?” he asked a bit breathlessly. “Did he reply?”
Yes, he had always been beautiful. But now, right now, as he came walking into the café, looking sheepish but radiant at the same time, he was absolutely stunning.
Harry frowned. “Yes, I got that part. What does that have to do with anything?”
Harry had chosen his apartment because, for one, he liked the location, so close to the Ministry that, were the sudden urge to overtake him, he could walk there every morning in less than ten minutes. Secondly, there was a bloody brilliant Thai place just a few blocks down, the very same one Hermione and Ron had brought takeaway from the night before Harry’s birthday. And thirdly, because, with the help of Dean’s artistic ingenuity, he’d managed to decorate it in a way that looked almost exactly like the Gryffindor common room back at Hogwarts.
He couldn’t have spoken even had he known something to say, and so when Potter stepped towards the shopkeeper, thankfully not looking Draco’s way, his green eyes mirroring that same immutable determination that had awed Draco since they first met, he was grateful.
to do as well.”
“As a matter of fact, all my living relatives are terrible people, and they treated me horribly. To be honest, I think that’s one of the reasons I disliked you so; after all, here I’d been, alone and clueless, at Hogwarts for the first time, entering into this beautiful new world of possibilities, so sure I’d left all the bullying behind me, so sure this place with all its wonderful, magical people would be better,” Harry said. “Then I met you. In a way, you reminded me of them, and I hated you for it.
