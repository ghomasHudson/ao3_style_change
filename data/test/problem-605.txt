my eyes
I shrug, “Sorry.”
“What are you doing?” I ask, confused but Draco just casts a
Potter appeared at the last second, obviously out of breath with Granger and Weasley at his side. He saw me and Draco but we both just rolled our eyes from our usual seat at the Slytherin table. The three of them sat at the Gryffindor table and at that moment, Dumbledore spoke up.
A booming noise startled him and he glanced up at the sky to see a burst of red fireworks. He watched the firework show with awe, ooohing and awwing when appropriate, and felt sad when it ended a few minutes later. The Prefects and Head Boy/Girl began dismissing everyone but as he walked down the stairs he couldn’t help but ask Gemma a question.
Blaise shrugged, “In some other compartment. We thought you guys were with Vince and Greg but when they turned up saying you two hadn’t shown up, we decided to go search for you. Daph, MIllicent and Theo stayed back.”
Young me sneers at him, turning my head away because I can’t move.
Gabby :)
Draco huffs, “Blaise, Theo, Vince, Greg and I can be one dorm.”
Hawthorn wood was different, it was more suited to healing magic but they were adept at curses as well. It found its home with an owner with a conflicted nature or passing through a turmoil. The wood is hard to master and is only given to people who show potential and proven talent. They also have a happency of their spells, when handled badly, backfiring. The unicorn hair core was something their father would not be happy about. Unicorn hair was the most difficult to turn to the Dark Arts. The wands with this core are very faithful but the unicorn hair can 'die' if mishandled which will need to be replaced.
I don't know if you can notice but I got reaaaaal lazy towards the end of this which is why the dialogue doesn't flow that great and there are a lot of time skips :3
Professor McGonogall hands the letter to the young Granger instead of the parents who are flabbergasted.
I cheer because I’ve wanted to go down to the Slytherin common room since we got here. I miss the mermaids and the darkness and the green, “Hey Potter, you’ll get to see the common room for the first time.”
The cursive of the note reminds me of the signature of the Headmistress Madame Maxime of Beauxtrons. I have only seen it once and that was in the letter of acceptance to Beauxtrons which I then burned and replaced with a rejection letter so I could get into Hogwarts. I had believed back then that I could change my brother into a better person but I discovered I myself was not a better person either and that our father had a bigger influence on us then I thought.
At the door is Professor McGonogall, holding a letter in her hands. Most of the muggleborns gasp and a collective of “You got McGonagall!” and “The best teacher to pair with her.” filled the room. I roll my eyes.
science of all -
I can tell Hagrid is sniffling again and even Potter looks like he will cry. He forces it down though, by the way his face goes from smiling to cold. There’s something going between him and Dumbledore. Perhaps a grudge for keeping him in that terrible home with those muggles. I assume Dumbledore was the one who kept him there because of the beginning of the movie and what he just said to Hagrid.
That makes me spit out my drink but before I can tell her that may not be the best idea, she’s already standing up and she yells, “I’m gay!” right when everyone stops talking. Her face goes bright red but she does not show her embarrassment on her face, instead, she huffs and sits back down. Everyone stares at her but then they look away, though Granger’s eyes seem to linger a bit longer than everyone else’s.
Draco nods, “Yes. Weasley. Your little brain should be able to grasp that concept, you have twin brothers yourself. It must be hard though to keep up with all your siblings, though.”
Diagon Alley was probably one of Cassiopeia's favourite places where she could enjoy the wonders of the wizarding world. She never expected the day when she would be going intot he shops and buying things for Hogwarts to come so quickly.
"Yes." He replied, resisting the urge to roll his eyes, but he didn't say anything else and silence stretched between the two. It seemed the conversation ended there and her brother was waiting for more questions but the boy had nothing else to say.
“What!” I yell in outrage, “The owls will notice me and start making noise and I’ll get caught.”
Draco froze, his back straight and his cool, collected facade goes up and Cass instantly knows something is wrong. Then she senses it, the presence of two extra people walking up to them. She turned her head slightly and out of the corner of her eye caught a glimpse of red hair. The only people she can think of with hair that astonishingly bright colour are the Weasleys and the only Weasleys walking around in a pair would be-
“Êtes-vous un idiot?”
with our fears
“And stay out!”
Grace stares at their headmaster in shock from further down the table, “This is our headmaster?!”
He rolled his eyes but did so, “-Don’t worry, they don’t have any connections with the other houses. There’s no way they could get pumpkin juice from them, we’re fine.”
Yet here she was. Helping her brother make friends and then realising you forgot to ask their name, getting her first wand and experiencing the thrill of magic run through her bones and even buying her first pet, a ginger cat. If only she could be doing all of this by Draco's side as his sister and not have to pretend to be a distant cousin. Things would be so much easier if they didn't have to pretend.
The owner tried to protest, telling her the animals were dangerous but the glare from the woman shut him up. He gathered all the necessities needed for the two cats, put it in a bag and told her the price. The two cats along with their stuff was paid for and then the three of them left. It wasn't until they were outside that Draco pondered the new name for his cat. Cass was happy with Diana but Cecilia only reminded her that she was blind. He thought about it the whole way to the broom shop. Then in the middle of the alley, he blurts out.
“Hey, Draco,” She said to her brother who was inspecting the letter, “Do you think Matthias would let us borrow his owl?”
“Go get dressed boys, we’ll be in the common room,” Pansy shooed Draco into the bathroom to get ready and then leaves with Cass.
The friends she loved with all her heart have been with her since her childhood. Either from meeting at pureblood mother tea parties or the annual Christmas/Yule Ball, she has been stuck with them for a long time. Some of them she isn’t as fond of but the few she likes are the only other people who know about her secrets. Like the fact that she is actually Draco’s brother and that they both are metamorphmagus. Cass wonders if any of them would be able to recognize her with her new look.
My younger self whispers to my brother.
As they walk through the opening in the wall, the Prefect hands them a slip of paper which he realises is a list of his schedule for the rest of the year. He is surprised when he glances up by the look of the common room. Draco had been told it would be leather couches and damp with a cold atmosphere and a green, eerie feeling. However, the couches looked leather but the students sitting on them sink into the cushions and look comfy. Lights are everywhere and a fire is crackling in the fireplace. Blankets are everywhere and there is an entire wall that looks out to the water of the Great Lake.
She laughed at the meaning as well, the name very crude. Draco poked a finger at the black cat and when the cat responded with a snarl, baring its teeth, he smiled. "I think I've found my cat."
Pansy elbows me in the side, getting my attention, and says, “You should do it too, it feels good to be out to everyone.”
“Could we also get a vial of crushed dragon scales from his potion cupboard?” Blaise wondered but Cass already knew the answer to that.
“Hurry or you’re going to miss the train!” Their mother yelled when the train blew its first whistle, signalling for all its passengers to get on board with their luggage.
Draco and Cass headed to his dorm room to keep the book there so they didn’t have to carry it around the whole day. They hid it in his trunk, locking it shut with a spell his Father taught him that would only open to him.
My brother tries to shush me but it’s too late, Flinch must have heard our footsteps going down the back stairs because Mrs Norris was at our feet, Flinch coming down the stairs. My face flushes and I hide the owl behind my back as Flinch stalks over to us.
At that moment, Dumbledore looks at the Slytherin table and winks which makes me freeze.
It’s so sincere that I don’t know how Hagrid doesn’t burst into tears. The other Slytherins pretend to gag at the moment but I just sit in my seat in silence. These heartfelt moments were unknown to us so we laughed at it. Thought it was a weakness. Whatever our parents disapproved of was not allowed: muggleborn friends, hugs, touching, even smiling for stricter families like mine. Showing emotions, like love, was prohibited. I wondered sometimes what it would have been like to grow up in a loving family or at least have someone in my life like Potter had Hagrid and Granger and the Weasley’s. It hurt to think of what could have been.
My brother freezes at that and looks like he is going to murder her but Potter lets out a chuckle which makes Rosa turn to look at Potter before going back to Draco. She smirks, “Ok, we’ll meet you at eleven at the great hall. If you aren’t there exactly at eleven, though, we are leaving.”
The two lay on the grass, panting but laughing, enjoying their life as kids even though this was only a fraction of their childhood, the rest full of manners and punishments. It was nice, just them two and no one else but Cassiopeia knew they would be separated soon. Their mother wanted to send her brother off to Hogwarts, the British wizarding school, while she was expected to join Beauxtrons, the French wizarding school. She would not get to see Draco at all throughout the year, other than winter holidays and summer. She did not know how she could be apart from him that long and for eight whole years since Beauxtrons went for an extra year than Hogwarts.
All the other Gryffindors laugh as well and Granger huffs, “There’s nothing wrong with liking books.”
They stopped in front of a portrait of a fruit basket and George said, “All you have to do is tickle the pear.”
- once the sun asked
I realise how Professor McGonagall hasn’t changed at all throughout the seven years, still looking as mighty and strong as she was before, but not as young. She had more wrinkles now too. The war was hard on everyone.
They all laughed but once the laughter subdued, the group shuffled into two with practiced ease; Draco, Cass, Blaise, Pansy, Millie on one side and Theo, Daphne, Vince, Greg on the other.
The hall broke into whispers, everyone staring at the messy raven haired boy walking up to the stool. People around the twins pointed at him and muttered to their friends if that really was Harry Potter. Cass felt this was a bit much and could tell the boy himself looked rather embarrassed. Harry was mumbling something under his breath and Cass swore it looked like he was saying, “Not Slytherin, Not Slytherin.”
“I’m Harry Potter.” Robe shop boy said and all three of the purebloods spin their heads to stare at him.
There was silence and she wished the other girl wasn’t a pureblood. Most of the supremacist purebloods would know that there were no Black that wasn't dead or in Azkaban. Hopefully, no one was that interested in figuring out who she was. With her new look, people would assume she was another girl, nothing special about her. Her father ordered her beforehand to change her hair colour to a golden blonde along with adding a slight tan to her skin. Now, she didn't look like Draco's sister but only a distant cousin. The girl didn't seem to notice anything strange, grinning and sticking her hand out to her which Cass shook.
“We need you to sign a permission slip to get a book from the Restricted Area of the Library,” Draco waited for an answer but when he got none, he added, “please.”
So it was in alphabetical order by last name which didn’t give her much time since Black would be next after A. Draco seemed to realise this and he scooched closer to her.
Everyone groaned, hoping Potter would have been able to get the answer out from Hagrid. No such luck it seemed. Not only did they want to know who got into Gringotts and tried to steal something and how but what they wanted to know what Hagrid had to get for Hogwarts. What was so special about it? It didn’t look like money. Why was it a secret?
One of the next few names called after was, “Longbottom Neville.” The Longbottom family were part of the Sacred 28 as well though they were known as blood-traitors. The boy looked like he was going to pee his pants. Draco felt bad for him except when the hat surprisingly yelled, “GRYFFINDOR!” and Longbottom ran to the table with the hat still on.
Real life Hagrid starts sniffling and tears appear in both their  eyes. He clears his throat and he pulls a tissue out of his pocket and blows his nose.
>I nod, "Our father made it very clear to us that if we made a fool of ourselves or dissapointed him, we would be sent away to Drumstrang, or worse."
She whispered in their ears, “They’re half-bloods but they don’t know who we are exactly. Be nice to them, we’re trying something new.”
Their father smiles and the two girls cheer.
“Always got a weird feeling being ‘round Quirrell.” Hagrid says, shuddering.
“Of course complex magic came naturally to the Chosen One as a child. What else could you do, aperate?” My brother sneers under his breath but it isn’t as low as he thought since the others hear.
“Cass, you took the wrong handbag!” She says to me before pulling me off to the side so the trio cannot hear her.
Monopoly was banned from the Slytherins after that incident and we were stuck with doing puzzles for the rest of break. When Headmaster Dumbledore called everyone back to their seats, the tension on the Slytherin side was noticeable to everyone, even the oblivious Gryffindors. I had hoped no one would bother us while we waited for the next CD to load but that was impossible when you befriend Hufflepuffs.
The two of them look at me, waiting for me to tell them what I’m going to wear today. I walk over to the closet and forage through my side of clothes. I decide on a white shirt tank top with lace, a blue and white plaid skirt and a blue cardigan. I show it to the girls and they smile, liking my outfit. I pick out a necklace with the Cassiopeia constellation on it that my brother, Draco got me. I had gotten him one as well, with the Draco constellation on it and he never took it off, wearing it underneath his robes.
“Yes,” Cassiopeia responds, “That would be good, Dobby.”
Young Draco replies,
Next were the Slytherin boys- Blaise, Theo and Gregory. This was going to be a bit hard to do since Blaise and Theo roomed with Draco but Greg was with Matthew White, Leon Sanchez and Chris Rogers. It was against what Dumbledore said, again, but you couldn’t just not include them? Draco and I must have had the same thought because after we talked to both dorms about going to the great hall at eleven, we told Greg to tell Matthew, Leon and Chris to go as well. Oh well, Dumbledore should know not to trust a Slytherin to follow the exact rules.
He laughs nervously at that for some reason, “Yeah… first time.”
That’s when I remember the Quidditch match. Draco smirks, “Oh, you’re on Potter.”
“Come on guys! Let’s go!” Cass called them, her arms stuffed with the cup, the scarf (which they found in their dorm when they returned. No one knew how the twins put it there though Draco suspected the house elves) and the bird book.
- chemisty between people
She hopped all the way to their mother, who gave them a nod of approval, and then proceeded to bounce to the counter. Once they reached the front, the owner's eyes widened at the site of the cage the girl was holding. His face drained of colour and he frantically shook his head, "Those, those cats are not for sale."
There is an awkward silence until Blaise speaks up. “Do you think a muggle zoo is the same as the wizard one we went to for Draco’s seventh birthday?” He doesn’t talk loud but the others hear what he says. I don’t remember going to a zoo for any of our birthdays.
“She tolerates me.” I say and I wish our cats were here so I could snuggle with Diana. She was always much friendlier than her fellow cat. It made sense though. The two misunderstood, cold ones who had a warm centre were together.
“Still, out of all the boys here, Draco is the best looking. Even with his hair gelled back.” Pansy says and I have to agree though I knew many girls who would fight to say Blaise was the best looking.
More laughter fills the room at Petunia’s face and everyone agrees with Dudley. The atmosphere changes to a more somber feeling along with the setting change on the screen. I gasp and hear Draco’s breath hitch next to me.
They all looked around for the culprit and saw Theo and his group waving a bottle of pumpkin juice at them before disappearing into the crowd.
She had guessed from the ginger hair that he was a Weasley but didn’t want to ask in case it came off offence or she was wrong. There were plenty of red-heads on the train but their father talked a lot about the Weasleys. How the lot were blood-traitors and stupid Gryffindors with too many children to feed and worn down clothes.
Sorry if this chapter was a bit stiff. I wrote this in my free time and wasn't really sure what to write. Yes, the letter they wrote seems like a fake but I don't know how to formal.
It was quiet in the room as we waited for the next clip to start but nothing happened. Headmaster Dumbledore noticed and he pressed a button on the box and a pause symbol showed up on the screen. He stood up and looked at me for a second before gazing around the room.
Neither of the twins were paying attention though, used to their father complaining about the old coot but also distracted by the food that had popped up on the table in front of them. There was roast, steak, kidney and shepherds pie and even mashed potatoes with sausages. Looking down the table, Cass spotted even more dishes of food. If this was the meals everyday, well, she could get used to this even if she had to listen to Dumbledore.
“... Where are the kitchens?”
Pansy pouts, “The only boys I knew were Blaise and Draco before Hogwarts and Draco was the only one who would have tea parties with me. Even though it took a while before he warmed up to them.”
I frown, what rumours was she talking about?
Pansy shushes everyone and we focus back on the screen, much to my dislike.
Two twins pretending to be cousins, the girl holds onto a cage with two sleeping cats inside, walking hand in hand to their fate. Or the broom shop. Their destiny isn't the broom shop, it's something bigger. They don't realise it but that one letter they changed also changed their fates. A million different timelines sprouted from that one action. Ones where their father did send a reply to the school, resulting in Cassiopeia still going there. Others where they receive different wands or different animals. It still wouldn't change the fact that their destinies are intertwined like fingers. Hand in hand their destinies walk, knowing whatever the future holds, they go through it together.
Draco sighed, hugging the letter to his chest. Matthias was perfect but if only he wanted Draco. He was only ten, though, perhaps when he was older Matthias would want him. His sister did not know of the incident that happened a year ago when he tried to court Matthias and Draco got rejected. It was embarrassing and he had been punished by his father and so he did not repeat to his sister. He hadn’t given up though but maybe he should.
She beamed and bounced up to the stool. Draco was sure she would be a Hufflepuff. He was surprised once again though when the hat yelled, “SLYTHERIN!” Grace jumped off the stool and skipped over to the Slytherin table. Katrina was actually grinning and the two sat next to each other. Cass and Draco shared a look across the hall. It wouldn’t be long before it was his turn.
The hat sighs,
We reached the area where the owls were and I survey the owls. Draco stands guard at the entrance as I ponder, which one? I could be boring and pick one of our friend’s owls like the sandy yellow owl named Sierra was Susan Bones’ owl but I feel like Pansy would be disappointed if I went all this way to not have some fun. So, I slowly creep up to a white snowy owl and hold my arm out. Surprisingly, it flies up and lands on it but I quickly stun it and catch it in my arms.
I raise an eyebrow, “Why are you getting this worried? We’re just going to meet Pot- oh! You have a crush!”
Potter and his gang seem to wince at the fact. They will be surprised at what emotion Severus can show. I glance up at him sitting at the table and he catches my eye, the corner of his mouth lifting upwards. I smile back.
We all sigh, only in a perfect world would Gryffindors and Slytherins like each other. Pansy won out of all the others for game ideas so Truth or Dare it is. Pansy is the first to go because she thought of the game. She grins and rubs her hands together, grinning evilly, “Ok, Cass, truth or dare?”
I glance over at the two boys who are in a deep staring contest,
It seemed odd for the blinds to have been closed when it was such a nice day outside. That’s when something caught her eye. Sitting next to the candle was a black book, a journal. Draco walked over to it, a foul stench wafting into his nose from the book, and flipped open the book cover. Inside was written:
So with a heavy heart and his sister next to him, he felt himself drift off to the dream world beyond. His eyes closed and with his hand in his sister’s smaller one, he fell asleep.
Theo ponders, “Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws are out because I don’t think they would want to play with us. Ravenclaws don’t seem like the party type and neither do the Hufflepuffs. Which leaves… the Gryffindors.”
“Perfect, now what is symbolic for each house?”
The young Longbottom sighs. It must be his eleventh birthday but I couldn’t see any streamers or cake like in Susan’s house. His grandmother continues speaking but in a low voice.
“A bottle of pumpkin juice,” Cass replied and then George repeated the order to one of the house elves. The house elf apparated back to them with a bottle in their hand and Cass took it, whispering a ‘thank you’ to them.
They all think for a moment before they share their ideas.
“Just wait.” Is all my brother says. I remember this day like it was yesterday and I guess my brother does as well.
“One flaw though, they hate us.” Draco points out.
“Well, we best we going,” George said and the twins pushed open the portrait again.
She smirks and I know I’ve chosen the wrong one, “I dare you to sneak up to the Astronomy tower and kidnap an owl.”
Cass nodded, “We duplicated it.”
Weasley speaks up, “What rumours?”
We won’t be getting anymore conversation out of her so I motion to Draco that we should leave. The next-door down is Tracey, Sally, Jessica, Emily and Grace ’s dorm room. The Slytherin girls are an odd number so our dorm has four people while there’s has five. I knock and wait until someone opens the door. It’s Grace there and she grins when she sees me. She was one of the first friends I made here, other than the ones I knew before Hogwarts. She’s a half-blood and was the reason I don’t believe in stupid pureblood superiority.
“Of course,” I say, rolling my eyes and Draco laughs, looking over my shoulder before saying the password, “Rosica is endgame.”
“To make things a bit more interesting, the first group gets to prank the others. Sabotaging is allowed.” Pansy smirked at her fellow first years, already planning how to restrict the others from winning.
Potter eyes me curiously but in the end shrugs, “Yeah, sure.”
“Is that me, sir?” Potter asks Dumbledore.
Happy Valentines Day everyone! Hopefully you guys are spending time with your loved one/s but if you're reading fanfiction (like me) today then you're probably single. Oh well...
The mermaids enchanted me and learning sign language to communicate with them was one of the quickest things I have learned. I longed to know their secrets and because of some bored kid who had patience and smarts, we now could. My brother along with our friends learnt the language to keep the tradition alive. It’s been an ongoing rumour if the mermaids can be communicated with, so far everyone thinks its false and we’re not going to tell them if it is or not.
On their way to their compartment, Cass bumped into a girl with bushy hair who was reading while walking. She stumbled backwards while the girl fell on the floor, “Oh, I’m so sorry!”
Cass grinned, “It’s okay! I’m Cassiopeia Black and this is my cousin, Draco Malfoy.”
“You’ll get the scarf by this afternoon,” Fred added and then they were gone.
“Sure but by the time it was my turn, I had already been there four times for the others. Besides, most of my stuff was hand-me downs.” Weasley replies and he sneaks a glance towards the Slytherins. No one says anything against his family and their amount of money so he relaxes back in his chair.
Draco’s head snaps his head to stare at him, “Would you like to repeat that Blaise?”
As the two of them headed back with the book in their arms, Cass wondered how the other half of their group were doing. Hopefully Blaise wasn’t bothering Pansy too much or Millie’s strange Muggle idioms weren’t annoying them.
“Your attention, please.” Professor McGonagall says and the students turn to see Dumbledore rise from his chair.
Now that his friends were going to be undergoing this change as well, he would have someone other than Cassiopeia to remind him when to be nice. And, he would be able to show Cass he knew when to scold others too. There would be some people he would openly express his dislike for but he would keep the teasing to a minimum to satisfy Cass.
She shrugs when he doesn’t reply, “Well, I’ll just write a let-”
“GRYFFINDOR!”
“Are those your pet companions?” Grace asks, her hands twitching by her sides.
“Malfoy?”
She hadn’t imagined Draco in a different house. There was no room for doubt or imagining in their family but inspecting him closer, she realised he would make a good Ravenclaw. He was witty and clever, always eager to learn more and begged their father to hire multiple tutors to teach him many things, not in his year level. The other two houses were out of the question and the blue on his robes would match well with his eyes if he was worried about colour matching. Cass didn’t think she could bear her brother being in another house and she knew Slytherin might be their only chance to be together.
Pansy looks at Blaise with disgust, “Then we got together. Which only lasted for a few months so it wasn’t that big of a deal.”
Draco frowns,
We laugh together before I point at Millicent, still fast asleep in her bed, snoring. “Shouldn’t we wake her up,” I question, feeling bad if we just leave her sleeping.
Draco rolls his eyes, “Professor Snape is our godfather.”
"Peresphone!"
And then he was off, walking out of the door so he could aparate away. Our father addressed us with an approving look,
Millie gestured with her head to the other group, “I think they know what we did.”
She points straight at us and I almost want to go up there and just snap her finger in half. Potter scratches the back of his neck, “Yeah I can’t tell you why but Dumbledore needs all four of you in the great hall at eleven. Everything will be explained there.”
I can tell the Weaslette is not buying it but she agrees along with her two friends and Matilda. She glances at me and raises her eyebrows but I nodded, telling her what he says is true. She shrugs at me and the four of them walk away. Draco slings an arm around my shoulder and walks behind Potter as we go down the stairs from the Gryffindor common room.
The library doors shut behind them with a bang and all five of them flinched at the noise. Madam Pince was not to be messed with and they learnt that the hard way. Who knew such an old lady could hear that well? Or maybe they were just loud. Sitting on the steps, they all sighed in unison.
“You got it already?” Cass was surprised, she thought it would be at least another two hours before they got it.
"Oh," Cass said, looking into the cage from the top at the black cat snuggled next to Diana, "I didn't see it there. Have you found a cat yet?"
It’s young Hannah next, her blonde hair in two pigtails, and she’s standing on a stool in a robe shop. I look over at Hannah and we share a look. Hopefully this isn’t the part where Draco and I come in and insult her house choice. I speak too soon because the door chimes sound and two children walk through the door. Its my brother and I.
“Ready for our trial?” Cass cheered and Draco tried not to let the anixuety show on his face.
It’s different in the Slytherin dorms, there was no waking up to the chirp of birds or the sunlight streaming through his window despite the curtains. The windows beside his bed are all underneath the Great Lake so the light that does make it into the room was a soft light that shimmered across the floor. All he can hear was the mumble of the non-understandable chatter of the mermaids.
The students were getting anxious. Draco could tell everyone was waiting for one student. Harry Potter, the legend himself. So maybe he had had a crush on the boy when he was younger but who hadn’t? The boy in person wasn’t as extraordinary as in the picture books and stories but he was still funny. But Draco didn’t
She excused herself politely and left the table, Draco following shortly after. The two sat in Draco’s room together, leaning on each other’s shoulders, their fingers intertwined. She took a deep breath, in and out. They had gotten one wish, they were both going to Hogwarts together but not as siblings, just as complete strangers who didn’t know each other’s third favourite animal and second to least favourite food. But they had gotten this far, they couldn’t give up.
Weasley and Potter laugh and he says, “Of course, ‘Mione wanted books for her birthday.”
(See the end of the chapter for
I sigh and say, “Listen, Weasley. What do you think would have happened if I told my father, the death eater, that I didn’t agree with his ways, do you think he would have taken it kindly?”
a soft epilogue, my love
he chastised himself,
That surprised Cassiopeia. Never before had her brother expressed doubts about what house he would be in. It was always going to be Slytherin and there was nothing that made him change his mind. It didn’t help that their parents reminded them constantly that Slytherin was the only respectable house for them to be. But even without their reminders, he constantly talked about what the common rooms would be like and who he would share a dorm with and how he always looked good in green which would make her laugh. But now, getting closer to their chosen compartment at the very back, he seemed relatively anxious and seemed to think he could be in another house.
I appear on the screen first. Sliding down the hallways with socked feet is a young girl with platnium blonde hair and blue eyes. A few gasps are heard and I wonder if it's from people who know me or if they assume it's my brother. That would be hilarious but I know Draco would not find it funny. It’s Hannah’s voice that I hear.
“I’ve got it!” He shouts, “The answer is ‘A circle has no beginning.’”
The Malfoy twins have done it. They have written a letter from Beauxtrons saying Cassiopeia did not get in so that their parents have no choice but to send her to Hogwarts. He will finally get to be himself with her out in the wizarding world and make his own friends.
She smirks, “Effrayée, Dray?”
They all agreed that was a smarter choice than stealing from Professor Snape who would probably kick them out of Slytherin just for stealing from him, if they even got that far. They decided to spilt up as well to, as Millie would say, ‘kill two birds with one stone’.
The two siblings share a look and Draco speaks up, “Oh, here father,” He pulls the book out of the pockets of his pants, “I saw it and was going to return it to you when I saw you next.”
Draco sighed in relief and handed the hat to Professor McGonagall. He walked down the stairs with his head high as the hall clapped for him. His sister was even whistling from where she was standing. Draco sat down next to her and she squeezed his hand.
She and I plus all the other Slytherins, have a group where we talk about Draco’s obvious crush on Potter and how to make Potter jealous. So far, Pansy has been the only one to get even a small reaction out of Potter and now, she’s done it again, because I can see Potter clenching his hands into a fist by his side.
“Yeah, but remember how he took this vacation the year before us and he came back all stuttering.” Anthony replies.
“Slytherin, easy; Hufflepuff, easy; Ravenclaw, not too difficult; Gryffindor… “
The shop was crowded and their mother waited near the front while her two children searched the room for their future pets. To Draco they all looked sort of the same but Cassiopeia was much different, inspecting each cat. But despite there being many cats to choose from in the shop, none of them felt right for either of the twins.
that never goes out
The section of the CD cuts off and Dumbledore pauses it as Potter comes out of the room, his eyes red and puffy around the outside, with Granger and Weasley following after him.
Finally we see that Draco (and Cass) and Harry are not going to be friends after this :( but Harry doesn't have much of a reason to hate him so he will still try to be friends :)
I walk into my dorm to see Daphne searching through our shared wardrobe and Pansy sitting on the floor painting her toenails with maroon nail polish. She glances up at me and bursts into laughter at my onesie and then quietens down and continues to paint her toenails. I frown, not seeing Millie until I spotted a large lump in the bed across from mine on the right. I roll my eyes, of course, she’s still asleep.
Greg shakes his head and stops Vincent from going any further. He turns and smiles at Draco, “Well, we’re here for you mate.”
The other twin, Fred, joins in, “It gave us a shock here, imagine what the muggles must have thought!”
“How did you get the book?”
“Now, before we begin, Headmaster Dumbledore would like to say a few words.”
I agree with Hagrid. Goblins were quite smart and the best for the job in Gringotts but they weren’t the most kind. Our father liked them since they were straightforward and didn’t question what his business was in Gringotts. Our aunt on the other hand found them useless, probably because you couldn’t negotiate with them like other people.
A few minutes later, I saw four girls come down, two redheads, one blond and the other a brunette. The Wesalette and Matilda were redheads but I did not know which of the other two were Spinks and Rogers. Chris had dirty blonde so perhaps Sophia had blond hair too but I was not sure. The other student leaves us seven alone. Matilda gives a small wave at me which I return, trying not to attract any unwanted attention to us.
“Aw, Harry!” Granger sighs and hugs Potter who is sitting next to her. He hugs back, mumbling something to her and soon Weasley is joining them with the rest of them as well.
I glare at them. I wasn’t trying to start a fight, I was just pointing out the obvious. Tracey, who always loved Quidditch even though she didn’t play, smirked, “You’re on. Next break, let’s play a match. Gryffindor vs Slytherin. You can choose your team as well, and it doesn't have to be the old ones cause you might want to replace a few people on your team, Potter.”
Luckily when the sorting hat opened its mouth, out came, “SLYTHERIN!”
I have never been the main concern of our parents before. Of course, they wanted me to behave and get good grades but if I chatted with a Hufflepuff, I would get a warning. But if my brother did, he would get letters and letters and maybe a howler and once we got home, he might even get a beating, depends on how serious my brother acted out. I know that my brother sometimes took whippings for me and it frightens me. They did this because he was the heir to both the Black and the Malfoy and I was female while he was male, the Malfoy line will continue on his end while mine it would not.
Mother had told him about the creatures living in the water and had even mentioned that they would learn how to communicate with them using muggle sign language. It was quite strange and he had hesitated about it but when he had learnt his father had refused to learn so because of it being a muggle technique, he was on board along with his sister.
We all say goodbye, Potter still confused, but he doesn’t say anything as we make our way down the stairs from the Ravenclaw common room and off to the Gryffindor common room to pick up some of the younger students. Slytherin is last and there’s no one in Hufflepuff we need that are not in the eighth year.
Draco shook his head, “Rien, juste, et si je ne suis pas dans Slytherin?”
Millie stands up and places her blanket on her bed, sending a glare our way, before hurrying off into the wardrobe to get ready for the day. I don’t have time to go and help her or apologize because there is a  knock at the door. Pansy, who I just noticed was holding a bag of makeup, tightens her grip on it, “If that’s you, Jess, I’m not giving you back your makeup. The colours in your eyeshadow go with my outfit perfectly and if you think I won’t risk our friendship for the perfect outfit then you are wrong.”
She leans in close and smacks her brother on the arm, “balise!”
“We didn’t go to a zoo, Blaise.” Draco says, raising his eyebrow at him. By now, everyone else is listening into our conversation.
Gabby :)
Cassiopeia held the letter in her hand and realised they had one problem, how would they give it to their father? An owl would not work for the only ones accessible to them were their own owls which their father would easily recognize. Unless she asked one of her friends if she could borrow their owl.
“Hoffman, Katrina.”
Potter shrugs, “After getting my house trashed with owls and letters, this wasn’t that weird.”
“And fourth: a token from all four houses”
She just hopes nothing from their childhood is shown.
Draco rolls his eyes, “Do you really think I would start a fight with them after the war? No, it was some Ravenclaw who blames me for their uncle dying. Couldn’t even put up a fight because if I did, I would be expelled.”
The two siblings held their breath, waiting for the last rule. “I have assigned you two under different last names, from now on at school, you will be Draco Malfoy and Cassiopeia Black. No one will know you are siblings, twins are bad luck in the pureblood world and I can’t have that on my reputation.”
This was it, as soon as Draco and Cassiopeia completed their trial they'll become a true Slytherin along with the rest of their friends. They were so close and all they needed to do was collect four things by 7pm, easy. But with sabotaging friends and a stolen bottle of pumpkin juice, the question is: is everyone really their friend or are some of them pretending for their reputation?
(See the end of the chapter for
Later that night at dinner, their father spoke up, “I have sent a letter to Dumbledore about Cassiopeia’s circumstances but I do have some rules if you are going to Hogwarts together.”
“Hufflepuff is simple, we can just get one of those replicas of Helga Hufflepuff’s cup from the library.” His sister says and Draco turns down a different hallway, adjusting their course to take them to the library.
Cass gulps. The professor clears her throat and calls out the first name, “Abott, Hannah.”
“Malfoy, Draco.”
Cassiopeia laughs, shaking her head, "That is a very complicated reason behind the name but I like it. Diana and Peresphone. Best friends for life."
Potter speaks up, “Well, should we get ready for our match? Or are you Slytherins too scared to lose?”
Theo creases his eyebrows together, “Now my interest has peaked.”
“Ew,” Draco cringes, “It’s bad coming from Pansy, but from my sister, it’s just disgusting. Never say that again.”
“She’s an 8th year Weasley, can’t you see that she has all the houses on her robe, unlike the younger years,” Draco points at the little picture on my robes.
We crack up harder than before until Dumbledore hushes us and we focus back on the movie. The incident was a while back when Justin had taken a fancy in me after puberty hit me. I told him no of course but he didn’t seem to get the hint so Draco and I played a small prank on him and he ended up with pig ears and a tail and a snout.
Everyone cheered, exicted they were able to relax until Madam Pince shushed them all and told them to quiet down or leave.
Draco knocks on the door but I don’t wait for an answer and barge in, it is my dorm as well. Millicent is the only one there, Daphne and Pansy must have already left for breakfast. She looks up as we enter, “Can you do me a favour, Millie?”
“Who’s our team gonna be?” I ask Draco, who was technically our captain.
Hannah says, smiling so wide that I can see the gap between her two front teeth.
Tracey stops when I look at her but Katrina stares at me. It’s intense and I suddenly wish I hadn’t started this because the other girl could go for minutes without blinking. Pansy pushed Katrina’s face away, rolling her eyes, “Stop it you two so we can continue the movie.”
“If I remember correctly,” I say to Theo, “they get together in fourth year.”
Hagrid glances at Dumbledore who only smiles, “It’s all in the past now, Hagrid. I thank you though for doing what I did not. I should have taken Harry out of there when he was younger but I was being selfish, thinking it was the only way to protect him when I knew it was not.”
“It’s all very secretive,” Draco says, “I don’t like it.”
>A few more first years get sorted into Slytherin, including Theo, and then it’s Pansy’s turn. Draco wasn’t as close to the girl as Cass was and when he was younger, she annoyed him a lot. Now, he joined her for tea parties though he never really liked them but he enjoyed her company. Maybe when they got older she would be less, well, girly.
Hope you enjoyed this. Luna, Cass and Draco are cousins btw :) I like that idea since they have similar hair colour (in the movies, not the books). Luna's mother is Draco's father's sister. Leave kudos and questions in the comments. And bookmark this too!
“What is he holding?” Vincent asks, pointing at the gun in Vernon’s hands.
I nod,
She shrugged, "I don't know. I'm not buying it though, only Diana. Mother wouldn't let me anyway."
the little things were
He turns his head to me and a large black eye stares back at me and I wince, “Oh. Weasley again?”
It’s silent in the room and Potter stands up and goes into the side room. My eyes are wide. Of course this was about Potter but I didn’t think we’d watch what happened that night. The screams of his mother… I don’t know how I’d handle hearing my mother’s death, not alone, people watching it.
They nod and Severus sighed, “Wait here.”
Sneaking a glance at Potter though, he doesn’t look extremely happy at what is about to be shown on the screen. I must admit that if my life was on the screen, I wouldn’t be excited either. My brother would be but that would depend on what parts were shown. The good parts of course but we all wish the bad parts of our life can stay in the past and just forget them. It seems for Potter, that won’t be happening.
“I told you we’d do it.” She smiled and Draco raised his eyebrow at her.
Sofia asks her sister.
Cassiopeia didn’t reply but sent him another glare,  huffing as her tailor finished fitting her clothing. She didn’t go to pay yet and sat in the chair next to Draco as he walked up to a stool. He looked uncomfortable as the lady measured him but she giggled whenever her brother got stabbed with a needle. It made her forget she was even mad at him. So what if he upset one girl, that doesn’t mean she won’t make any friends. There had to be someone out there who didn’t cower or sneer at the Malfoy name besides her friends.
I gulp. This could go two ways: if I said Truth, she would make me spill about my not so secret crush on this girl in Gryffindor which I don’t want to talk about to her and if I said Dare, it would probably have to do with her or some stupid dare that results in me going out. I decide the second one is better because Draco would always help me if it was something I didn’t want to do. “Dare.”
Sitting on the edge of the shore, my feet splashing in the lake. Fish jumped up and down and I laughed as one sprayed me with water. The cold was refreshing since it was late summer, the end of September. The Great Lake frightened people, the unknown beneath the surface, the creatures hiding that no person would ever see. But, if you had grown up next to it for seven years, waking up to seeing mermaids and small sharks next to your window, then the lake was just another place wizards had yet to explore.
Cass frowned, “Would it be cheating if we asked Severus to sign a permission slip?”
Severus pinched the bridge of his nose, “I’m guessing this is for your trial.”
Draco and Pansy went off to find the most Ravenclaw book they could find while Cass and the others went to go duplicate the cup. He was looking for a blue book but that proved harder than he thought. In the end, Pansy found a book about birds and they deemed that close enough.
othing much new in this chapter but Draco does have a cat instead of an owl in this book. I hope you like the names :) They sort of match. Idk, I realised that they do when editing. Also I just love the names.
“That’s because it's embarrassing.”
Tracey non subtly glances at a few choice students that were on the Gryffindor Quidditch team before.
I’m not sure what to do and I can tell neither do any of the Slytherins. For the past seven years, Potter’s been our enemy and even if he wasn’t directly my enemy, he was Draco’s and everyone knew Draco was the face of Slytherin. Now, that was all over but it still didn’t feel right to comfort someone you barely know, someone that not long ago you were teasing and making fun of.
“Finally!” I shout and it isn’t until everyone snaps their head to look at me, I realise I said it outloud. Draco sits me back down and glares at anyone who looks at me weirdly.
I don't know if I mentioned last chapter but Vincent is still alive in this bc i forgot he died (oops) so I'm just saying he was found later and had very bad burns from the fire. (perhaps he couldn't die bc he casted it and can only be controlled by him?)
“I’m Hermione Granger.” She stuck her hand out for Cass to shake.
Neither of the girls' expressions changed at the mention of his last name so they must be muggleborns or sheltered half-bloods. The girl with the glasses relaxed, “I’m Grace Kelly and this is Katrina Hoffman.”
“That was a lot to handle, especially for some people, so why don’t we all take a break. There are snacks on the tables and restrooms to the left.” He sits back down.
Most of the Great Hall were now watching, anyone would if they saw a Slytherin walking over to the Hufflepuff table. Thankfully, Cass was friends with one of them, Susan Bones. Her aunt, Amelia Bones, was quite popular in the Ministry and so her father knew her, of course. He soon had her children become acquainted with his. Luckily, Susan and her younger sister were nice and they became friends.
AN: Sorry that this chapter is short. Hopefully, I’ll make the next one longer. Will everyone give me their opinion on whether or not you want me to turn this story onto an mpreg? This will help me determine how long this story will be.
“What do you mean, you were blinded?” he asked again digging into his Gryffindor bravery. This new Harry made him feel like a failure.
AN: Hey Everybody!! Sorry I’m so late on this. During Thanksgiving Break I greeted sleep like an old friend and it didn’t want to let me go. This update still technically counts as the November update in my book, so expect a December update sometime in the future. And no I am not abandoning either one of my fics. I have decided that you guys will decide the familiars for Draco and Aidan. Just send me a comment or PM saying what the animal is, it can be magical or nonmagical, and maybe why you picked it. Whoever’s I pick will also get to decide on something else they would like to add into my fic as an incentive. Hope you like the chapter!!
/Hello! It said excitedly as the bond snapped into place./
“Of course. If you would follow me.”
Draco took a deep breath, not used to an irritated Dark Lord.
After Draco finished, there was complete silence.
“Avada Kedavra.” He says as he aims his wand at himself.
“Okay, Okay, I’m cool. I’m calm. It’s just, I wish they would all just die.” Aidan says with a sigh, putting his head on Draco’s shoulder.
AN: Updated 2-16-15 Happy Presidents Day readers!!
(Here he shows me his hand were it says ‘I must not tell lies’)
“I’m right here Harry,” Tom said moving towards his son after getting the okay from the goblin. As he reached down to help Harry up, Harry raised his hand and placed it into Tom’s.
RS: What was wrong with Ms. Umbridge? Minister Fudge says she did a great job and that Defence Against the Dark Arts scores where at an all-time high that year.
“And who’s this handsome fellow?” They ask, their magic body – as he was now calling his way of seeing people – gesturing towards where his father was.
“Of course!!” Draco yelled throwing himself at Aidan. Aidan, not expecting it, fell on his butt, but thankfully he managed to catch Draco and make sure the box that held the ring didn’t fallout of his hand.
“They will see you now.”
Metamorphmagus Block – 100%
Aidan knelt down and let his hand rest on the cage so that the animal could sniff it.
“What’s in the box?” Lucius questioned, already having a small idea of the mystery inside it. Or more correctly, the jewelry inside it.
“You have to agree to not talk about this conversation, or anyone that shows up, to anyone without my express permission. You will print whatever I tell you to print in the light I want you to, and you can’t tell anyone where you are.” He says listing off things that Tom and he had discussed earlier.
“Hello Harry.” That was definitely Tom’s voice.
“Uncle Sev, hurry!” Draco exclaimed, running towards the bloodied form that was on the ground. There was a puddle of blood underneath the figure that had already soaked through the tattered bare clothes Potter was wearing.
Lord Emrys (magical inheritance)
After grumbling about taking one, both agreed and gulped one down.
PLEASE SEND HELP TO #4 PRIVET DRIVE.
Was this pregnancy the act of two people in love or
“Yes! You’ve joined the dark side.” The twins cheered together.
“Can you describe how my new familiar looks?” Aidan asked petting him. The wolf-like animal barked and snuggled into his hand, happy to get out of the cage and to have a bonded familiar.
Draco walked in behind them and stopped, looking at the sight. Then he breathed the two words that they were all thinking, “Dear Merlin.”
(Readers, this is where if you are a little squeamish or hate violence, you may want to stop reading. There are some very graphic things going to be said.)
“Ready?” a goblin to Harry’s left asked one last time.
“Ready.” Harry says firmly with a nod of his head.
“Fine. What do you want me to agree to?” she says albeit reluctantly.
He slowly made his way into his bathroom with his hands out in front of him. When he reached the door, he opened it and made his way to the sink to brush his teeth and get ready.
“I can’t believe you think that we did this!” They exclaim at the same time. “Sure we play pranks like this, but it wasn’t us this time.”
“Yes.” Bill says stoically, no emotion showing on his face.
The remaining Order members found them with Draco underneath Harry with blood pooling underneath him. Their hands were laying on top of each other and a serene smile on Harry’s face. There were no life-threatening marks on Harry, so they knew what had happened and knew that they were….
Sorry for taking so long to update. School has really caught up to me and I didn't have the time or the motivation to right. Hopefully I'll be able to update at least once per month. We'll see though.
Harry reached deep into his mind like he used to do when he was younger before he was obliviated and found his core. It was a pulsing light green and blue ball. He could see that there was another person’s magic over half of his core and that core was almost black. Harry pumped his magic to full strength and the other’s magic weakened a little but didn’t come of completely. He was going to have to ask for help.
“What are you still doing with this death eater Harry? He’s brainwashed you into thinking you’re a faggot. Come back to me so that our son isn’t a bastard. You told me you loved me when we conceived my baby, why are you going back on it now?” Ginny said, making the growing group of wizards murmur to themselves.
And last year, if he had just known about the prophecy, he could have realized that something was going on with his dreams and not have fallen for the trap so easily. Sirius may be alive if he had known.
When Draco made a slight hurt sound for being called a faggot, Aidan spoke up for the first time since Ginny called out to them, “Listen here you skank. You will not, I repeat NOT call my boyfriend a faggot. I don’t know who you slept with and frankly I don’t think you do either if the rumours in the school are anything to go by, but I am not the father to your child. If you are even pregnant. I have never, and will never have sex with you.”  Aidan got close up and whispered in her ear, “If you ever bully and/or mess with my boyfriend again, I will call in the life debt you owe me and I assure you, what I would make you do, you would not be happy about.”
“I think we should go back to Britain and talk to Fred and George. They obviously have information that we need to hear. I’ll send them an owl to tell them that we’re coming. You can stay overnight so that we can leave in the morning.” Charlie decided after a minute of thought.
“When I went out looking for that thing you wanted me to get for Draco, I had the goblins pull it out of the vault as well as layer it in more protective charms and to make sure that no one but you could take it off.
“Perfect, between them all the total mounts up to 5,684,954,729 galleons. And that’s without interest.”
(The easy-going and light atmosphere shocked me readers, considering the legendary fights they got into at Hogwarts.)
"I think we're done for the day," Draco said suddenly, his face even more pale than usual. "I have no intention of vomiting in this office."
Draco did most of the talking. He didn't mind. At least Harry seemed to be paying attention. Draco talked about his parents, his apothecary and his friends. Harry even laughed quietly while Draco ranted about Pansy's ridiculous matchmaking attempts.
The medi-witch slipped back into the room once the healer had left. She stepped up to Narcissa with a sly smile. "Did it work?" she asked quietly.
Draco turned to look at Harry with red-rimmed eyes. His face was every more pale than usual. "I'm so dizzy," he whispered, just before his knees buckled.
Draco made a soothing cooing sound, gently nuzzling Harry's cheek with his nose. "Just relax Harry. Everything is fine," Draco murmured, reaching around to smooth down Harry's feathers.
"What?" Harry asked, pressing closer to Draco in concern.
"Only the best for my family," Harry said softly. He stroked Draco's soft white feathers, his eyes focused steadily on Draco's face.
Draco let out a sudden burst of surprised laughter and hugged Harry excitedly. He met his father's eyes over Harry's shoulder. "Thank you," Draco said quietly.
"Ew," Scorpius pronounced, wrinkling his perfect little nose. Neville carried him off, shaking with mirth.
"How's that for an answer?" Draco asked, giving his hips a slow, exaggerated roll.
Draco shook his head. "It's fine Harry," he soothed. "I wanted you. Badly. I don't regret it and I hope that you don't either."
Draco sighed, shooting a final glare at Pansy. "I'm sorry," he muttered, kissing Daniel's face gently. He tickled the little boy's tummy. "I can't believe you tattled on me to your mummy," he said in mock indignation.
Ron cleared his throat uncomfortably. "Pansy came over to my place last night," he admitted.
"Harry and Draco share traits with birds," Luna said, carefully inspecting her popcorn. "Many animals, birds included, groom one another. A mating pair might do it, but it's also common with family groups." She glanced toward Draco and Harry. "I imagine it's rather soothing."
"It's a bit excessive," Draco agreed lightly. "But we do have a few extra people coming for breakfast."
HPDM~HPDM
Harry walked over to the bed, carefully arranging pillows and adjusting blankets. After a few minutes he cocked his head to scrutinize his work. He'd made a sort of nest. It wasn't perfect, but Harry found himself eager to climb into it. So he did.
“I never said I was enjoying it,” Ron retorted stubbornly, letting out a sharp yelp when Hermione elbowed him.
"You don't have to cook Ron," Harry protested. "I can do that."
Harry winked at Ron before pressing another sweet kiss to Draco's lips. Then he shuffled back and helped Draco to sit up. As Draco got to his feet, Harry picked up their egg, dropping a little kiss to the shell. Draco looked rather pleased by the gesture, smiling to himself as he grabbed the little nest.
“I feel awful,” Hermione told Pansy.  “Draco looks so hurt and disappointed.”
Harry looked back at Draco with a loving smile and Ron nodded in understanding. "Seriously, I get it," Ron assured the blond. "I'm just glad that you're allowing me to help. I get to hold the egg and hang around here. It's an honor really. It's not a bother to cater to your needs."
Harry whimpered and shifted away from Ron's hands. Tears filled his eyes and his lip wobbled with the threat of heart breaking sobs. Ron withdrew slightly, frowning in concern. If Harry was two years old, he would have memories of being under the care of the Dursleys. Had they mistreated him so early in life? After a moment, Ron decided that he wasn't particularly surprised. He should have guessed that their depravity wouldn't draw the line at a baby.
"Of course," Harry replied. "That was brilliant." He kissed Draco lightly, snuggling into Draco's chest. After a moment of comfortable silence, Harry pulled back to look at Draco. "We're getting married," he said with a grin.
Harry scowled at him. "Don't be a prat," he retorted impatiently. He grabbed Draco's hand and placed it on Draco's abdomen, guiding his fingers. "Right there," Harry said. "Just a new opening. Nothing to panic about. It's probably mostly useless to us. We still have... you know, human parts."
"Neville has asked Hermione to go to dinner with him," Pansy said quietly, pointing off to one side. They could see Hermione and Neville neatly stacking the gifts and talking with blushes on their faces.
"It's mostly just a bit embarrassing," Harry explained with a wry smile. "We make sounds that humans don't. We can actually communicate with each other to an extent."
Harry wasted no time in complying. They stumbled up the stairs together, hands seeking whatever skin they could reach. They paused in Harry's bedroom to bring their mouths back together for a deep kiss.
"That's... decent of him," Ron commented hesitantly.
They made it to the new restaurant without a word and Harry and Draco were ushered inside. Luna and Pansy were sitting at a large round table, sipping wine. Aside from the staff, the rest the of the establishment was empty.
"I even begged once," Draco added.
"I felt guilty," Harry admitted. "You lost your brother. Hermione was tortured. But I'm the one thats..." He trailed off miserably. After a moment, he sighed. "Now, you've started a family and that's got to be your priority. I love Rose and I'm thrilled for you. But it's a reminder of the family that I lack. And Christmas just makes me feel... so alone. I live alone. I sleep alone. I can't handle the crowd at the burrow, and... It's all too much and I'm horribly lonely. But I'm too much of a wreck to change it."
"This is Draco," Pansy said, patting Draco's arm. She giggled when Harry gave her a disbelieving look.
"If you are happy Draco, then you have my blessing to pursue this," Lucius said somberly. Narcissa slipped her hand into his with a pleased smile.
"I know that," Ron agreed. "That's why I'm here and the others are out there. We're all just glad to be here for you."
"Of course," Neville agreed solemnly. Then he smiked. "As long as you weren't getting pregnant at the wedding, it's fine."
"Yeah well, he's an auror," Ron responded. "When he's not working he's donating money to war relief funds and such. He's still everyone's hero-" he trailed off, swallowing hard.
"What the hell for?" Blaise asked.
The restaurant staff were polite and efficient. A few got caught staring at the gray and white feathers, but they had the grace to flush with embarrassment and look away.
Harry and Draco were released from the hospital the next morning as planned. Hermione would be monitoring them with house calls, just as a precaution. Harry was just glad to be out of the hospital and able to gain better control of his wings.
“I’m happy for you both,” Ron went on.  He met Harry’s gaze with a meaningful look.  “Honestly.”
"Come on then," Harry said softly. He coaxed Draco toward the hallway, looking at Pansy over his shoulder. "Pans, why don't you make some tea? We'll be back shortly."
"I forgot about that," Draco muttered. "Why would she help us?"
Draco snorted. "I look ridiculous," he retorted, resting his hands against his belly with a sigh.
"So, now you spend your time lying on the ground like some sort of ruffian," Lucius sneered.
"Well, that's no good," Pansy muttered. She looked at Draco with a frown. "Your muse is one of the people in need of cheer."
"We appreciate your patience," Harry said calmly, knowing perfectly well that Rita wasn't patient. "Please have a seat."
"Then why are you crying?"Draco asked, gently brushing the tears away.
Harry turned his head to look at Draco.  “Me too Draco.  Happy Christmas,” Harry said quietly.  It was tempting to say how much he loved Draco, but Harry decided to wait.  There would be plenty of time for that.
"Of course," Ron nodded.
"I'm not sure that's an accurate description of this emotion," Lucius muttered, looking flustered.
"It's a little early," Draco said hesitantly.
"You enjoy that sort of thing?" Draco asked. "Movie full of people making cow eyes at each other?"
Draco had no words for that moment. Harry and Luna had set up a nursery, and it was beautiful. Draco really didn't want to cry. He really hated to cry. Stupid hormones.
Harry offered a slightly watery smile and a few moment later, he was alone with Draco again. Draco was looking down at his bowl with a contemplative frown. "I didn't intend to upset you," he said, lifting his gaze to focus on Harry.
"Oi! I'm supportive but take pity on my eyeballs," Ron groaned. "I can't unsee that."
Draco clenched his jaw and then forced himself to relax. "We were warming our feathers," he said, waving one hand dismissively. "It felt nice, so we fell asleep."
Harry considered the idea. It would allow him to see all of the Weasley's without the overwhelming crowd. He glanced at Ron and then at Draco. "Is that feasible?" he asked.
"The baby isn't the only reason," Harry insisted. "You've been here for a few months, but... I want it to be official. I want you to make this your home, permanently."
When Harry reached for Draco's wings, Draco stopped him. "Can I?" Draco asked uncertainly, reaching for Harry instead. Harry chirped and then blushed before turning away from Draco.
"No," Draco said firmly. "You need to talk. You can't keep doing this."
Harry thought his heart might melt. He was sure that Draco would be very glad to be rid of the remainder of the weird pregnancy hormones, but Harry fervently hoped that he'd never see an end of these beautifully sentimental moments. As prickly as he was sometimes, Draco possessed a tender heart that Harry adored.
"Good boy," Harry said softly.
Draco wasn't particularly interested in the romance part of the film. Why would he want to watch someone else fall in love? They did stupid things and there was always a betrayal or some sort of misunderstanding that was utterly ridiculous. But, the comedy part sounded promising.
Harry did as Ron suggested, flinching only slightly when the ancient, and slightly mad, house elf appeared. "Master Potter, young Master Malfoy," the old elf croaked. He shot Ron a suspicious look. "Blood traitor."
It was exhausting. But Draco steadied his breathing and pushed himself to flap his wings harder. He laughed breathlessly when he was able to rise. He squeezed Harry's hands excitedly. "We did it!" Draco cried, impulsively throwing his arms around Harry for a hug while keeping his wings going. Harry returned the embrace exuberantly.
"I will not."
"Father is furious," Draco said, his wings starting to droop as if the anger was draining out of him. "I've tainted the Malfoy bloodline."
Love Potion – 50% (develop a mostly serious crush)
As he did so, he saw a flash of light and he felt the magic around the ring change to accept him. It did the same with the Riddle heir ring as well.
“I don’t know Gred.” George sighed “The attraction is apparent in their every move. Hopefully whatever it is that Sirius did will make them recognize it.”
After all, it was one thing for someone to tell you that a person was totally different and another to see it for himself.
He was furious. How dare they steal from him! He went back to his room and quickly wrote a note to Gringotts to say that he could make it.
“Dragon, what’s the problem?” Aidan asks confused.
Dear Charlie,
Mauled by Muggles, the survivor of the Killing Curse
“And?” George asked from his position leaning on the bedroom door.
“Tom’s all bark and no bite.” Harry says in a stage whisper, trying to relieve Draco’s tension. “Nagini says he’s grumpy without his tea which he should’ve been having right about now.”
“What?” Tom asked tilting his head a little.
“Okay.” He says as he uses his emergency portkey that would take him to the house infirmary where he knew his mom would be set up waiting.
“That THE Dark Lord-”
(Readers, I have to say I was completely shocked here. How could it not be Sirius Black?)
'Yes I am. Lucius Malfoy’s son, Draco, and I are going to Gringotts and since I am blind, I need to make sure Dumblefuck and his Chicken Club don’t try to do something to me.'  Tom choked a little in shock at the nickname Harry had given Dumbledore and the Order.
/I like it. Thank you for my new name. Now I can feel how powerful you are, and you need to have another familiar. I can’t help to control all of it. We need another./
Fred and George’s mouths were wide open staring at him in shock. Nobody had been able to explain how they could tell the two of them apart so matter-of-factly before.
“Harry…. You know we don’t care about that. We knew that it was only a matter of time before you went dark. Actually, the reason we were looking for you just know was so that you could take us to the Dark Lord. We’ve had enough of the so called ‘Light side’. We’re tired of them forgetting about us or thinking we’re useless. Just today our own mother couldn’t tell us apart. We’re just sick of it.”
Father’s Name
Now, they were cuddling and waiting for Voldemort to attack Hogwarts so that they could end this once and for all.
“My life’s doing fine right now. And we’ll see about the love thing.” He said with a smirk towards Draco. Even though he couldn’t see it, he knew Draco was blushing due to the way he ducked his head after that comment.
Narcissa, whom had been the one to shout, was bouncing up and down in barely restrained joy. Lucius and Tom smiled proudly, while Severus still sat in his chair, not really knowing how to respond.
“What heavily affects me?” Harry says starting to get rather annoyed.
He knew for sure about one thing though, he was never going to fight for Dumbledore again. He decided that after the will reading he would contact Voldemort and ask to join his side.
“Yes, that would be preferred.”
“Great. I’ll call you Cor. It means heart as well, but in Latin.” Aidan said thinking about the name.
“What did you tell her?” Draco asked with a curious tone to his voice.
Harry and Draco were surrounded by well-wishers the second they walked towards Gringotts. After a while of smiling, unknown touches, and answering questions, Nagini got tired of being surrounded by people and hissed.
“But if you can find it in your heart to love me then I shall cherish your love forever and strive to do the best by you for the rest of our lives.”
“I’m going to kill him.” Aidan said calmly, like a window hadn’t just shattered.
Harry blushed and looked down as he answered, “I knew what I wanted in a ring for Draco so I had Father ask the goblins to search for a ring like this. The closest I got was a rose gold snake, but that didn’t perfectly symbolize my Dragon. So instead I had father write down everything that I wanted for Dragon’s ring and commissioned the goblins to melt down the rose gold ring and make this one. I added the stones to remind him that our love would burn brighter and hotter than even dragon flame.”
He would have to up the love potions to keep her from complaining so much. All that was left was to wait for Harry to walk out of Gringotts so that he could get him, using the voice activated portkey that he had to take him back to Grimmauld with him.
“Well, after the meeting I shall talk to her. Get her to realize that Harry has sadly corrupted them.” Dumbledore said with a fake sad expression on his face.
“I’d love to! I always wondered what happened to that necklace.” Aidan said, happy that Tom was accepting him as his son fully. “Now about that gift for Draco…”
After doing so, the goblin said something in Gobblegook, there was a sharp gasp when he finished. There was a rustle of paper showing that the goblin had given the paper to Draco. There was another sharp inhale, this time from Draco.
“We should leave him to his thoughts.” He vaguely heard Malfoy’s mom say to the others as they all left the room, closing the door with a silent thud.
Harry Potter Inheritance Test
“I don’t understand why no one else bothers. Even though you two are twins, you are different people. There’s a reason why identical twins are considered one soul in two different bodies. Two bodies, two people, two personalities – no matter how similar the personalities are. Calling identical twins the same person would be like saying that soulmates are the same person as well. They complete each other yes, but they aren’t the same.” Harry said explaining his reasoning.
RS: You still haven’t asked my first two questions yet. What disability was Draco talking about and why are you hiding from the Order?
“Of course sir. Right this way.”
To Fred and George Weasley, I leave a copy of all the pranks that the Marauders have ever done as well as a few we never got around to. I also leave you 3,000 galleons for you to do as you see fit. Thank you for being such loyal friends to Harry. I ask that you continue to be great friends for he will need them in the future.
“Do you mean the invalid one that Dumbledore and Mrs. Weasley made that they had no right to as neither one of them are Harry Potter’s legal guardian in any way, shape, or form?” the goblin said with a sneer in his voice.
“Aidan!! Congratulations you two!!” she squealed and ran to them hugging them both very tightly.
“How in the world am I going to carry around so many keys?” Harry said shocked at the amount of keys that showed up at the table.
“If it’s for the reason I am thinking of, then yes, but only if you get Mr. Potter’s permission. This does heavily affect him.” Ragnarok said.
He got to the floo as fast as possible without running like a maniac and simultaneously yelled out Gringotts and put on a complex glamour as he stepped into the floo. The complex glamour was so that in some odd chance, Dumbledore saw him, he wouldn’t be recognized.
'So you are the ‘impertinent brat’ my master Tom always complains about.'
“Come on Neville. We must leave Draco and Aidan alone.” Luna said leading Neville away before anyone could speak.
She was cut off by an amused Severus because both Tom and Lucius couldn’t stop laughing at the horrified expressions on both of the boys’ faces at how fast Narcissa was speaking and what she was talking about.
The adults all smiled to each other and backed out to give the new couple a chance to be alone.
“Professor Dumbledore!” Hermione shrilly shouted, her being one of the smart ones that had conjured herself a robe, “Grimmauld Place has ejected all of us!”
Albus Dumbledore popped into complete madness.
“Send some Death Eaters to his house and wait for his relatives to get back. Then capture them and put them into the dungeon.” He said looking at his two followers.
“Ready to go Harry?” Draco says coming in somewhere from Harry’s right.
“I said Dragon, you’re getting married. I got the marriage contract earlier today.”
“It’s actually really simple if you pay attention and really want to. Before I was blind I could tell by a few cues, like Fred was a little softer than George. Fred would also be the start of the more mischievous ranks to get everyone to laugh. George is usually the start of the pranks made to specifically humiliate and embarrass people.
“WHAT?!!!! How dare that old goat!!!!” He exclaimed. “I can’t believe he put that in the paper! Like that bitch would ever be something like that with Aidan!! When I get my hands on her, she will wish she was! Maybe then he would stop me from killing her!”
(See the end of the chapter for
Lord Potter (blood adoption and Potter Will)
“Cissy please. They just got engaged wait a week before you start planning a wedding.” Severus placated.
“I don’t know my lord. The car was gone but most of their things were still there.” Severus said sitting in one of the chairs in Lucius’ office facing towards him. “All of his school supplies was locked in the cupboard under the stairs. His wand, a photo album, a map, and his invisibility cloak were underneath a board under his bed.”
“What?!!”
“Well, isn’t that… interesting.” Draco said as he finally walked into the room. “Before we do anything else, don’t you want to make sure that Dumbledore and his sheep can’t access your vaults without your explicit okay?”
It hurt. Every part of him screamed and he could barely move. Something softly bumped against his hand and as he struggled to open his eyes, he heard cooing.
“I don’t know.” Harry said just as shocked. “I could just feel your hand move closer to me and raised my hand to reach it. Except it wasn’t really your hand I felt, it was more like your magic.”
To Hermione Granger, I leave only one book about the true meaning of friendship. I am ashamed of what I have found out about you. I thought you would always be Harry’s friend but it seems I was wrong. I have left a note for Harry that, if he ever forgives you for what you have done, tells him what you get from my will.
He repeated the sentences a few more times before canceling the spell.
Harry woke up to the felling of someone running their hand through his hair. He froze, not used to such a nice sensation. As he froze, the hand stopped and moved away from him. The hand and the soft bed underneath him made him realize that he wasn’t at his relative’s house anymore and he shot up into a sitting position. With that motion, he realized that he wasn’t in pain anymore, but he couldn’t see. He lifted his hand to his face, and he felt the bandages that wrapped around his eyes.
Gringotts.
“When you were taken from me, they also took off the necklace that was given to you as a baby. I had had it put into the vault on a pedestal simply because I couldn’t have it near me to remind me of what I had lost.
“Unless you mean a marriage contract between Harry Potter and a name that will not be spoken of at this moment because of current company that was already sent off to the parents of said unnamed person the moment everyone was in the room and the will was stated, then there was no other marriage contract.”
“You are most welcome, Harry and please stay here as long as you need. We are, after all family.” Narcissa says with a smile in her voice. “Your grandmother was a black just like I was. And please, call me Cissa.”
Emily Granger
“We will just have to make do.”
Harry James Potter
“Not really. When Sirius died, Grimmauld Place barred the Order from entering because he just let them borrow the place. So when he died it wouldn’t let them in. Tonks, still having Black blood, can allow them in until I officially take over as head of house though. But I suspect that it’ll take them a while to figure that out. I’ll just tell them that I was able to get in and I found Draco there and we settled our differences. It would give me a reason to ask to get resorted into Slytherin. After all, what better way to get the evil Slytherins to change their ways and fight for the light, then to be ‘one of them’.” Harry said as he ate.
When he calmed down, he started to speak to the two people in the room.
RS: You’re blind!
“What are you talking about?” Draco injected confused on what they were hinting at. “And would you please stop calling him Harry? His name is Aidan. Aidan Salazar Riddle.”
There was a huge explosion as everything stopped.
“Sure let me write a letter to Rita in your name.” Tom says with his chair scraping away from Harry, so he assumed he was getting up.
HP: I did tell someone. I told Professor McGonagall. She just told me to keep my head down and not get in trouble. After that, I assume the other kids saw how none of the teachers helped the Boy-Who-Lived and didn’t even bother trying to ask. What’s worse is by the end of the school year, I had been tortured with a blood quill, almost drugged with Veritaserum, and threatened with the Cruciatus Curse.
Crack! The window in the dining room that overlooked the garden shattered at that announcement. Everyone looked towards Aidan who had an extremely icy expression on his face.
“Sirius Black, Harry Potter’s godfather wrote a marriage contract between the two of them. Since he is legally the guardian of Harry Potter, the marriage contract is legit. Even now, after you have claimed him as Aidan Riddle, the contract still goes under effect.” Narcissa explained as she stepped away from Aidan and Draco who still had there stunned expression on their faces from the revelation.
“Yes, my lord.” Both Malfoy’s bowed and left.
“Father! Calm down. You forgot it shows that nothing except the Metamorphmagus Block is at one hundred percent. Hopefully, we’ll be able to take off the blocks without me being damaged.” Harry said trying to calm his father down.
Hermione sat in a corner of the Headmaster’s office contemplating all that had happened. In her hands was a letter from her mother.
Shaking his head, Fred walked to the door and looked to see who it was. Recognizing his eldest brothers, he cautiously opened the door.
Charlie was washing up after a vigorous day at work when he got two owls, one from Fred and George and one from his mother. Out of habit, he scanned them both for anything wrong, not expecting anything wrong. Surprisingly, only one of the two letters came up as clean. The letter from Fred and George was that one. Molly’s letter had a Compulsion Charm, and a Loyalty Charm on it. The Compulsion Charm was keyed to Molly while the Loyalty charm was keyed into Dumbledore. Outraged, he dispelled all the charms and also did another general dispel just in case he missed something before he opened it.
End Flashback
Even Tom was shocked at the thought that Harry had put behind the creating of the ring.
“Gred! Forge! How’s life?” Harry said with a laugh, eyes sparkling as he talked to the twins.
Ginevra Noname
HP: Dumbledore was the one who placed me there. He left me on their front porch step along with a note telling my Aunt that her sister and her brother-in-law where killed and that she had to take me in and raise me as well as raise her son too. At the end of first year and the year after that, I begged him not to let me go back there. He always brushed me aside and told me that I had a vivid imagination or he told me to stop making up lies about my relatives, that they were great people. After a while I just stopped asking and the punishments just got worse. I thought that at least at Hogwarts I’d get a reprieve. That changed my fifth year when Umbridge joined the staff.
Draco’s yell snapped Snape from his frozen state, and he sprang into action. “Lucius, I need you to go home and tell Narcissa to prepare a room and make sure that she has all the potions in the manor available.” Snape rapidly said as he pulled out his wand and started casting diagnosis spell after spell.
After hearing that they both stopped laughing and looked angrily towards Dumbledore.
To Draco Malfoy, I know your secret. The hand Draco had on Harry’s arm clenched a little tighter, telling Harry that Draco had paled up a little. Don’t worry, no one but me knows so don’t worry. I’d advise that you tell. He is completely daft and won’t get it unless it is spoken plainly to him. He will be more open to it then you will think. I name you second in line to the Black name. If, for whatever reason no matter the excuse, the person I have chosen as the new Black Lord cannot be at this will reading, then the right of Lord Black goes straight to you with no other inputs or suggestions.
I'm sorry for the late update!!! RL has got me truly stressed and I didn't have any time or effort to write.

“Me thinks I see some drool.” George said sneering at Draco.
“You are correct heir Malfoy. I would advise doing both though, your lord rings may not accept you if your under any compulsions.” The goblin adds.
“Little brother?”
As luck would have it, they both managed to find their familiars together. They both felt a connection inside the fox section of the store. Their familiars were obviously going to be mates and were curled up and entwined one on top of another.
“Let’s check upstairs for Potter before the Order comes.” Draco suggested.
“Malfoy! What are you doing here?” That was definitely Ron.
He was cut off by a loud “Harry!” being shouted from across the street.
AN: Updated 2-17-15
Charlie nodded yes as he sat down on one of Bill’s two couches in the living room.
“Yes. She is a very smart bird.” This time a new voice was speaking. “Heir Potter, my name is Narcissa Malfoy, I’m Draco’s mother. Could you please explain to us what happened to you?”
“Now, I can tell by both their vocal patterns and by their magic. When Fred speaks, he’s totally thought about everything he is going to say. When George speaks, it’s more spontaneous and he speaks with more of his emotions than Fred, not to be rude to Fred or anything.
“D-D-Dr-Dragon?” The blond stuttered his voice showing his shock at the new nickname.
Compulsion Spell – hate Severus Snape
Lord Evans (eldest born of Mariela Evans line)
“As great as that sounds, I’m going to have to answer with a no and add that the next time Dumbledore tries something like another Compulsion Charm, I might just kill him myself.” Bill answered just as sarcastically.
Trust Spell – Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, Ginny Weasley, Albus Dumbledore, Molly Weasley, Arthur Weasley
“Alright. I better not catch you two in each other’s rooms!” Cissy shouts at the two blushing boys as they make their way to their rooms.
“W-w-w-what?”
“I now I’ve only been betrothed to Draco for a little time now, but I want to make sure that everyone in the world knows about it. So I am asking for your permission to ask for Draco’s hand in marriage?” Harry was slightly shaking as he opened the box and gave it to Lucius for his approval.
When he reached where Lucius was sitting he cleared his throat again and began speaking.
Pain.
For familiar speak it's: /speaking/
“You and Rita did an amazing job with the article, Harry.” Tom said somewhere to Harry’s left.
From pranksters extraordinaire, Gred and Forge.
“It was awful.” She said, starting to tear up. “He had cuts covering his entire body. Most of the bones in his body had been broken at least twice. There was evidence that his bones had never been set properly in his life. Two of his ribs had punctured his lungs. The worst part though is that his eyes had been damaged, and I can’t fix it. He’ll be blind for the rest of his life.” She finished upset because she couldn’t fix all of the damage. Lucius wrapped himself around her, trying to give a bit of comfort to his shaking wife.
“WHAT?!!!!!” Tom shouted after all the information sunk in. “How dare they put Aidan under all of those spells, potions, and blocks. Thank Merlin for the size of his magical core. Anyone with a smaller core would’ve died by now. Especially since he’s been through so many ‘adventures’.”
AN: Updated 2-18-15
“Smart girl.” I say softly trying not to breathe because all it did was increase my pain. I slowly slid my hand to the puddle of blood I knew was forming underneath me. I dip my quill into it and slowly write
“Wouldn’t it cause the most drama considering the fact that I am rumored to be living in the Malfoy house?” Tom asked confused.
RS: With all the other rats?
“Draaaaaaaaccooooooooooooo!!!!” Narcissa rushed in and threw her arms around Draco, making him let go of Aidan’s hand.
“Before we get to the keys, let’s make sure that the rings accept him as lord of the house or, in the case of Lord Riddle here, heir. All you have to do is put them on. The magic will either accept you or not.”
“Today, you have made me one of the happiest people in the world. I vow to always show you the love and affection you deserve.”
“My baby’s getting married!!!!” She yelled throwing herself onto Lucius.
“Harry, I know what you mean about this happening very quickly. I have also loved and admired you for a long time now. I would gladly spend my days with you for the rest of our lives.”
AN: Updated 2-17-15
“Now, The magical Test says:…..”
“Come on Neville. We must leave Draco and Aidan alone.” Luna said leading Neville away before anyone could speak.
After getting a secure hold around Potter, he touched his heir ring and said, “Malfoy Manor” and the portkey transport him home.
“Yeah and let’s not forget the fact that Albus Dumbledore is draining his magic.” Draco hesitantly added not really wanting to rile the Dark Lord anymore than he already was.
“In order for me to tell you anymore, you have to give a magical oath you’ll follow the agreements that I have for you.” Harry said not willing to give out any more info without that agreement."
Pansy accepted, taking the seat next to Ron. She was delighted when he pressed a soft kiss to her cheek.
Harry groaned, sinking to his knees. His wings drooped and he braced himself against the wall, blood oozing from a ghastly wound on his abdomen. "Harry, just hold on," Draco urged him, shifting to shield Harry. "Hermione!"
"They're the best daddies," Maddie informed Narcissa proudly.
The aurors used disillusionment spells on themselves and began to move to surround the dark wizards. It was fewer aurors than Ron was comfortable with, but they'd had few options. Grant had a lot of friends in the DMLE, and Ron couldn't risk betrayal.
They didn't usually touch for the sake of touching. There was grooming and comforting. That was it. Harry was a little confused. He certainly wasn't going to complain, but he wasn't sure of how he was supposed to feel about it. He sighed softly, deciding to just enjoy it for the moment.
"Thank you," Harry said quietly.
"Indeed," Narcissa agreed. "I'm looking forward to seeing this child."
Harry flinched slightly, frowning unhappily. "I guess I can try," he murmured.
Draco forced himself to draw in a deep breath. "Gender aside," he said, "it shouldn't matter. We haven't..." He looked at Harry with a light blush staining his cheeks.
Draco rolled his eyes at her. "I'm well enough," he amended. "I was... overwhelmed. And I'm not accustomed to..." He trailed off, wringing his hands together. He had no idea how to phrase it without sounding ridiculous. To anyone else, it would sound odd.
"You're going to be exhausted," Draco informed him, tilting his head to give Harry more room.
Harry had been allowed to take Draco home that same evening. Hermione had given them potions for nausea and promised to check on Draco daily.
"She said that I was having a boy," Pansy told them, "and Hermione confirmed it yesterday."
Ron nodded slowly. That explained why the feathers looked so clean despite the gore in the room. "Can it be reversed?" he asked. "Can you take the wings off?"
"I see you're still disgustingly in love and happy," Ron joked.
Ron smiled. Grant was really a good bloke. It made Ron feel even worse. "Sure," he agreed cheerfully. "I'm sure Harry at least will appreciate it. Malfoy is driving him batty." Even more lies. For a moment, Ron wanted to kick himself.
"Hi," Hermione replied with a grin. "How are you both doing?"
"Daco," Harry mumbled sleepily, maintaining a firm grip on Draco's sleeve.
Once Draco had finished drinking, Hermione transfigured a quill into a cot and placed the little boy on it. He drifted off to sleep, curled under the blanket Hermione placed over him.
"Ah, Mr. Potter," Trelawney nodded. "I knew that I'd be seeing you. Tea?" she offered hopefully.
Harry watched Draco, admiring the sound of his laugh and how lovely his smile was. Draco was beautiful, with or without wings, and Harry suddenly felt ridiculously, stupidly lucky. He pulled Draco closer, their naked bodies pressing together.
Draco's orgasm was exquisite. There could be no other words for it as far as Draco was concerned. Once Harry swallowed, Draco yanked him up for a kiss, his tongue catching remnants of his own release. Draco took hold of Harry's aching cock and stroked him to orgasm, allowing it to spill over his stomach in white rivulets. Then Draco hugged Harry close, not caring that Harry's semen was being smeared between them.
“Hmmm.”
Padma speaks up, “So I won’t find out until later?”
He rolled his eyes but his sister smiled back, not bothered by the girl’s lack of observation. “Yes, I am. My name’s Cassiopeia Black.”
“No one should be alone. Not after that.” Granger responds and yanks her arm out of his arm, walking over to the room. Weasley follows afterwards with a sigh. The movie continues once they leave.
Draco immediately perked up, “Harry Potter? THE Harry Potter?!”
“Gemma, check this would you?” The Head Girl passed the vial to one of the Prefects, Gemma, who casted a spell over the vial.
Blaise and Theo groan but Daphne brightens up, “Alright then, share it.”
From behind her she hears the girl she bumped into, Hermione, whisper, “It’s not real, the ceiling. It’s just bewitched to look like the night sky. I read about it in Hogwarts: A History.”
The wand shop didn't look as impressive as she expected. It was dusty and the windows were covered with stacks of wand boxes. Their mother was already waiting inside so they both headed inside. An old man in the back turned around to face them as the bell signalling their arrival sounded off. He grinned and walked out to greet them.
They seemed surprised that a Slytherin thanked them and Cass nudged her brother, who mumbled a thank you which created a ripple effect, each of her friends thanking the twins.
Sorry I haven't updated in a while, this chapter was a real slug for me because nothing interesting happens in it for me. I put the train and the sorting all in one because I was too lazy to seperate it. Hopefully you guys like the OC's and that I didn't change any houses. Also there are a lot of students in each year in each house because this is the wizarding school for all of Britain but I think other students from other countries also go there too sooo idk
Cass laughed at her brother's reaction, “I forgot about your childhood crush on him.”
I am thankful when they move away from the snake and retreat to a different animal. What I don’t expect is for Potter to start talking to the snake. I would have laughed at this if I didn’t know from second year that Potter is a parselmouth and if I didn’t do the same thing when I was young. There were many animals in the forest that I talked to when I was lonely.
I peek a bit at Draco and he shrugs, which means I can tell them my full name, “I’m Cassiopeia Malfoy.”
It’s silent again so the Headmaster keeps going, “Keep your temper down as well, we do not want to start any fights. And, I don’t think we need to remind you but please remain in your seats. I will allow some switching to go on and if anyone needs to, there is a room in the back if what is shown gets uncomfortable for you.”
“Still, best present I’ve ever gotten.”
"Sorry about him, are your parents muggles?" Cassiopeia asks. It was the only reasonable answer to why the boy wasn't immediately launching into conversation about Hogwarts.
“You only ask that after he sits down and gives you a cake?” The girl Weasley says, giving him a look that I often gave to my brother which meant, ‘Seriously?’ or ‘How dumb are you?’.
“Of course Potter had fans as soon as he came into the wizarding world.” My brother snarls quickly to himself and luckily, none of the Gryffindors hear. I nudged him again but this time, it’s more softly, a concerned look on my face. He shakes his head. I know something is bothering him but I don’t want to push.
The girl they had met in the robe shop walks up to the hat. She looked nervous but as she sat down, a few seconds later the hat yelled, “HUFFLEPUFF!”
He shook his head, "What's the black cat's name?"
Daphne holds out a cute white dress with yellow daisies and green leaves on it, “Would this dress look good underneath my robes?”
“Yep, it’s real.”
Draco was standing next to Pansy and Blaise and stepped to the side to let the girl with bushy hair past. That was the girl his sister had talked to on the train. She mumbled under her breath as she passed, “Just relax, it’s okay.”
“We’ve got to go after them!” Millie exclaimed but Pansy shook her head, “No, as much as I’d like to hex Theo, I said sabotaging was allowed. I never thought I’d be the one sabotaged though.”
“I’ll write it!” Draco yells, interrupting her, “I mean, let me write it since I’m better friends with him than you,”
“Quelque chose vous tracasse?”
“When did you get so wise?” Blaise said and Cass couldn’t help but laugh.
Draco sneers, muttering, “That’s a terrible name to give to a child.”
I mentally facepalm, “Oh… right.” Draco nudges me, silently laughing so I just step on his foot which shuts him up.
My eyes widen and I say, “Did that snake just speak?”
Millicent lifts her own hand, “Someone is about to get slapped.”
As Mr. Ollivander gave it to him, he said, “Now, this is a peculiar wand. 10” made with hawthorn wood and unicorn hair core.”
Potter flinches again at the loud volume and a few of my fellow Slytherins do as well. I try not to think of why but my mind goes to the many times my father was ashamed of me. The feeling of the palm of his hand against my cheek or the pain he could put on me with only a flick of his wand.
“Family!?” Potter exclaims and I have to stifle a laugh.
Plus, if they got to blame more things on the Gryffindors in the future, he wouldn’t mind staying here at all.
And then she spills it all, the speech and the reaction their father would have and the end result, both of them together. The girl expects her brother to say no, he is still thinking that their father is great. But perhaps she is rubbing off on him because he smirks back at her. He sits up on his elbows and opens his mouth.
Again, really sorry to leave you guys alone out there with no more of this awesome fanfic to read lol but here is another chapter.
Draco is still mean as well because well like it says in the summary, old habits die hard. I also fixed the mistake with adding Vincent. In this, Vincent held on still and Cass ran in and stopped the fire. Vincent survived but severely burned so he was sent to St. Mungos and got out in time to go to 8th year. He doesn't blame Draco but Draco does.
“But how?”
the darkness inside of me
This was Harry Potter? The legend that killed You-Know-Who as a baby and survived the killing curse? He was wearing baggy clothes and looked like he hadn’t had a proper meal in a while. Cass knew the look. Sometimes, if her brother behaved badly he was sent to the dungeons for a few days. The longest had been a week and Draco had come out shivering and skinny. It didn’t surprise her why Draco didn’t openly show his tolerance for all types of blood because he knew the consequences. Cass had never been sent to the dungeons but she had gotten different punishments.
We stroll up to the 8th year common room together, the other Slytherins leave us to make their way to the dungeons. We make a few jokes here and there until we reach the painting. I’m about to say the password ‘lemon tarts’ when it swings open and Potter, Weasley and Granger exit. I’m not exactly sure why I use their last names because I never really spoke to them. I once asked Granger for help with a Transfiguration essay because no one else was around and she glared at me away so maybe that's why.
Draco sneers at the screen and I fight back the urge to do so as well. If I want to get better, I have to stop acting superior and thinking places that others go to that purebloods don’t, like the Leaky Cauldron, are disgusting. I elbow my brother in the ribs, letting him know his reaction is unnecessary. I wouldn’t bother usually but in a room full of Gryffindors, it’s risky showing emotions, especially negative ones. Those always get twisted against you.
He leaves to go to his study, their mother trailing after him, messing up her daughter’s hair with a rub before she leaves. Cassiopeia huffs, trying to flat it back down while Draco wraps her in a hug, squealing, “We’re going to Hogwarts together!”
“What, more Slytherins?” Pansy asks.
The large man, who apparently was called Hagrid, led them out of the boats and inside the back entrance to the Castle. Candles floated above them lit up the hallway. In front of them were large doors and she could hear students chattering inside. That must be the Great Hall where breakfast, lunch and dinner were held as well as the sorting and end of year ceremonies. Draco gripped her hand tightly when a cold breeze entered the room.
Everyone starts laughing when hundreds of letters shoot out of the fireplace. I wished I had something to take a picture of Vernon and his family’s face. Potter chuckles softly as well.
It’s silent and Pansy sighs, “They probably did. Why do I even bother?”
Grace points at the animals in the window of a shop, getting her sisters attention.
“Er, sorry ‘bout that. Just didn’t expect to see them, or that night.” Potter says once he’s sat down.
Headmaster Dumbledore grins, “We are fortunate then that there is a spell for that.” He mumbles a spell and directs it at the box with the CD in it. I hope it doesn’t work and I can Draco does as well. We are unlucky, though, because my younger self’s voice fills the room again but this time in English.
She asks her parents.
It will change once they get to Hogwarts since Draco still bullies Harry in this one but in the other one, he doesn’t. Also, Cass is still kind of mean but I feel like the SLytherins are closer in this book since in the other au, Cass and Draco also have the golden trio.
Weasley growls, “That still explains nothing!”
Draco looks down his nose at him, “That’s none of your business, Potter.”
Dean Thomas holds her back and goes to say something when something strange happens on the screen. I gasp. It was accidental magic but how was Potter at age ten able to make glass disappear completely?
“And my offer still stands.” Millicent grins at him, holding her hand up.
“And I’m guessing the snake is for Slytherin, red and gold scarf for Gryffindor, the book about birds for Ravenclaw and the… Hufflepuff’s cup?”
“That’s already a red flag, refusing a handshake.” Anthony Goldstein says.
It switches to us in the dining hall with our mother and father sitting on the other side of the table from us. A cake sits in the middle.
Bright red eyes appear at the top of the stairs and a hiss escapes the cat’s mouth. I immediately recognize the cat, Mrs Norris, as makes her way towards us. She hissed at me, obviously not over the incident in her first year. I tried to feed her cat treat but they were bird pellets and she got sick for weeks. Now she hated me which is why I never went on any of Draco’s adventures because she was out for my blood. Luckily no one ever retraced the bird pellets back to me so Flinch didn’t seem to think the hatred his cat felt for me was more than a coincidence.
He clinks his spoon against his goblet, says some random words and announces, “Let the feast… begin.”
I almost groaned out loud, of course, there were rules. What possibly could we mess up? Dumbledore continued, “The first rule is, there will be no spoilers from you about the future during these CDs. I understand that we have already gone through all of this but some people weren’t as updated as others. If a major spoiler is about to be said, you will find yourself unable to speak until you talk about a different topic.”
Then he hands us both a letter. It has the Hogwarts stamp on it.
There are a few 8th years in the common room but we go unnoticed, no one cares about us or what we do anyway. I push the painting open and the two of us step out. The stairway is lit up with a few lanterns but not bright enough for people to see us. We stride down the stairs in silence, skipping any of the purposely squeaky stair steps that alert teacher or students of you going down. The hallways are deserted at this time, only one or two students out who are either prefects or have detention. Our blonde hair stood out but one quick glance at the green on our ropes made people immediately look the other way. It was a curse and a blessing.
“SLYTHERIN!” The hat shouted and Cass cheered, grinning. Draco clapped for Katrina as well and quieted down when the next student was called.
“Firs' years this way!”
On the screen, the scene switches to a different house. It’s still not mine so I can still breath. Draco’s grip around my wrist loosens. A little bit chubby boy walks into the living room and there is a groan from the Gryffindor side of the room. I look over to see Longbottom with his head in his hands. I stifle a laugh at how upset he looks.
Millie sat silently until an idea popped into her head, “Could we owl a potion shop for it? We need to be back by 7 right? That would give us enough time.”
The painting swings open and as I step in, I ask, “Can we get the Hufflepuffs?”
We pass Potter, who gives us the thumbs up, telling us that the guys from the other two houses will be there. Draco and I decide to visit the Hufflepuff guys first so he knocks on their door. Ernie Macmillan answers the door and we tell him the same thing we have told everyone else and he agrees to go along with Oliver Rivers and Justin Finch- Fletchey.
Gabby :)
He sighs, looking over to her, “Je ne sais pas, mais nous allons envoyer des lettres à l'autre. Peut-être que nous pouvons même persuader mère et père de vous envoyer à Poudlard aussi avant que nos lettres viennent! Ensuite, nous n'aurons pas à s'inquiéter.” ‘
It was night time and there were few stars in the sky but the light reflected off the lake, making the water shimmer. The castle was what caught her eyes just like many of the other students in her year. It was grand, much larger than their manor in France, and gave off an enchanting atmosphere. There would be many mysteries and adventures in there and she couldn’t wait until they were inside. Their father said it was bland but their mother had commented that it was as amazing as it was on the inside as it was on the outside. Cass hoped their mother was correct.
Draco sighs deeply and it ricochets through my spine, “Maybe.”
She then turns to Draco, fluttering her eyelashes,
They found Cass, Blaise and Millie in the back of the library where the glass cases filled with antique artifacts were and in Blaise’s hand was a Hufflepuff’s cup. It was a duplicate of course but not like the one in the case was real either. Draco knew from eavesdropping on his parents conversations that his aunt, Bellatrix, kept the cup in her vault in Gringotts. Why she had it made no sense to him but he was never concerned with the reason.
He rolled his eyes, “Please like anyone else is going to knock on an ex-death eater’s door.”
I hadn’t told Draco this but I had heard a rumour that someone heard the teachers discussing putting Potter and Draco in the same room but Severus’s portrait had swung by and pointed out that the two had been through a lot and didn’t need the other annoying them. Headmistress McGonagall and Dumbledore had argued against that but in the end, they sided with Severus. I couldn’t imagine what Draco would have done if that happened.
“SLYTHERIN!”
I roll my eyes, “I’m not dumb, Dray. Don’t worry your secret's safe with me. Also, wear blue, you never wear blue.”
“Nice,” Pansy said and the two high fived silently under the table.
“She’ll be a Slytherin, just like Malfoy. All Malfoy’s and Blacks are sorted in Slytherin,” Cass hears Weasley whisper to Harry and she rolls her eyes. Had they never heard of Sirius Black? He continues in hushed tones, “They’re bad, the whole lot. Not one person who went bad wasn’t in Slytherin.”
Cursing, the boy watches as his sister darts off out of the forest and across the field. He sprints off after her, his boots spraying dirt when they land on the ground from the speed he is going at. The girl is sadly not as fast as she thought and before she even can do anything, she is tackled to the ground by her brother, covering her dress in even more dirt.
Terry Boot yells, “Hey! What about us?”
“Remind you of someone, Dray?” I whisper to him and he swats me away though he looks more flustered than he was before. Thankfully, the Gryffindors weren't really paying attention to us though I knew that
P.S. thank you all for the comments about how much you like this fanfic :) even the ones asking me for updates is sweet to know you guys still like this <3 means a lot to me
I sigh in defeat and pick my wand off the nightstand, tucking it into my robes. I push myself off the floor and I am about to leave when Draco grasps my wrist, “Wait, I’m coming with you.”
"The two look very attached," Draco replied and then read out the information from another plack on the back of the cage. "The cat is a female, her personality is cold and not friendly, she's blind in one eye and her name is Cecilia. Terrible name."
I snicker, “Of course you wouldn’t notice me. I just so happened to be in your Potions class and Charms class for seven years.”
“So…” Theo says, directing his question towards the prefects, “How are dorms sorted out?”
I will sit there with you
“Zabini, Blaise.”
Blaise laughed and the five of them left the kitchen though Cass knew she would be going back there soon. And she knew that there would be many midnight snack runs in her future.
McGonagall responds this time, “1981.”
Potter is the one holding the list and he reads off a list of names to a random sixth year who wouldn’t let us in any further because we were Slytherins, “Um, Ginny Weasley, Ava Spinks and Sophia Rogers.” Other than the Weaslette, I have not heard of any of the others. I do wonder if Sophia Rogers is related to Chris Rogers, a Slytherin in our year. Draco looks at me and I know we had the same thought.
She cursed herself for being so gullible. Cass was trying hard to be nice to everyone but it was tiring. She couldn’t please everyone yet everyone wanted something different from her. Her father wanted her to stay in the shadows, her mother wanted her to be the perfect housewife, the public wanted her to be evil just like her family and she just wanted to be kind. It was only with her brother that she felt like herself. Cass sighed, watching Potter at the Gryffindor table. She had liked him and she knew Draco did too. She would be nice to him but she wouldn’t go out of her way to do so. He had shown hate against her house which he knew nothing about and had never even talked to one of them. Potter was not her friend and would never be, unless he proved himself different from the other Gryffindors.
Theo stares at Draco, “Your mother called you dragon, Draco.”
Weasley glares and is about to challenge Draco when Granger sees me holding the painting open and says, “Only 8th years are allowed in there.”
“That’s how you told him?” Daphne asks from behind me, flabbergasted, “My parents sat me down when I was little and had a proper conversation about everything.”
They couldn't say anything else because the tailor fitting Draco finished. The two twins couldn't stay any longer and had to pay for their robes. They both waved goodbye to the boy and left the shop after paying. The robes were folded into a bag and the twins went off to find their mother. It wasn't until they were halfway on their way to the wand shop where their mother said to meet that Draco realised something.
Finally, he told them to have good grades and if they got into trouble, to make sure they didn’t get caught with a wink in their direction. Cass wasn’t sure if he was actually being a proper father for once or if it was just the act he was putting on for the muggles and the families so they believed they were a happy family. It didn’t matter which one it was though because even Cass had to smile as their mother hit him on the arm for that comment and told them to behave at Hogwarts. There were times when Cass felt like part of a normal family with the parents hopelessly in love and both adored their children and was always there to take care of them and not the house elves doing everything. Those times hadn’t lessened as they got older and the two of them were moulded into how they should be, perfect heirs to the Malfoy line.
Definitely a muggle-born, she hadn’t heard of that last name before but she smiled at the girl, “Cassiopeia Black but you can call me Cass.”
“Hey, you knew me!” Theo says and Vince and Greg join in too.
I nodded, “It would be better with more people.”
The Quidditch match will be the first thing in the next chapter and I will probably make Slytherin win their match but who do you want to win the other match? Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff?
When Katrina sat down across from her, there was a small smile on her face and the two nodded at each other. They weren’t close friends after the trip on the train but they were at least acquaintances. She watched as Katrina swivelled her head to look at the first years still waiting, her eyes catching Grace’s. Cass went through the alphabet in her head. Grace should be one of the next students and she was right when Professor McGonagall called out:
“Hey Slytherin! Why don’t you slither your slimy ass back over to your own table!” A Gryffindor yelled at her, the rest of them chuckling at his hilarious joke, but she ignored them.
There is a sadness that drifts through the room at Potter’s words. He never got to know his parents and lives in a cupboard with horrible relatives that treat him like dirt. My parents are alive but as a child, they ignored me and favoured my brother more for the simple fact that he would carry the Malfoy name and I wouldn’t. They couldn’t even accept the fact we were twins, making me switch last names throughout my seven years at Hogwarts. Since my father was now gone, my mother had no control over my personal information so I changed back. I understand what it's like to be treated less than others which is why I never understood that muggleborns and half bloods were bad. The way my father acted towards them was the same way he acted towards me when we were alone and I was a pureblood so it made no sense. My brother took a bit more convincing to switch mindsets.
Pansy and I stare at each other, our answers completely different and confusing the two boys even more. We start laughing.
It’s casual conversation after the introductions, Draco even joining in a few times. They’re not instantly bonding and becoming life-long friends but at least the two aren’t shutting them out. She found out that they are both half-bloods. Grace has a little sister, two years younger, and an older sister in third year in Ravenclaw. Her mother is a muggleborn witch and her father is a muggle and they all live in a muggle town which explains why she doesn’t know the Malfoy name. Katrina is an orphan, living with her foster mother and didn’t find out she was a witch until her birthday last October. Apparently, the two knew each other from school and recognized each other at the station.
The question was aimed at Grace and Katrina. Cass rolled her eyes, of course she wanted to know what house the two wanted to be in. It didn’t matter too much which house they were sorted in, that could easily be brushed aside, but which one they desired to be in. That showed what values they respected more and their personalities. If these two really wanted to be in Gryffindor or Hufflepuff, it would be harder to be friends with them. Cass didn’t really care to ask them but Pansy had to figure out who was on her friends list. It was most likely her parents had asked to be sent who she allowed to be her acquaintances.
Harry climbed into the nest, his wings flapping slowly behind him. He kissed Draco softly, sliding his tongue into his lover's mouth. He pulled back, his hands trailing down Draco's neck in a gentle caress. "Tell me what you want," Harry whispered. "I'll do anything you want."
Kingsley left shortly after that. Draco hadn't spoken a word through the whole visit. "Want to talk about it?" Harry asked softly.
"I'm a healer," Hermione reminded him. "It's my job to examine you."
"Draco?" Harry asked, fear creeping into his tone.
Harry's eyes were intent on the screen. A wistful little smile tugged at his lips. It wasn't terribly noticeable, but Draco spotted the expression anyway. Harry wanted romance and to be loved. Seemed like an obvious thing, but it hadn't occurred to Draco before. Why would it? They were auror partners and friends and the last two months had been spent dealing with their... condition.
All three men choked.
There was a sharp knock on the door before it was thrown open. In stepped Hermione Granger, looking flustered. "How are they?" she asked.
Ron carefully placed Harry back on the floor, settling himself on the carpet as well. Draco smiled and promptly began to babble at Harry. Ron didn't understand any of it and thought that maybe it was mostly sounds of excitement. Harry seemed bewildered and slowly pulled his thumb out of his mouth. Tears spilled over his cheeks and he sniffled pitifully.
Harry blinked in surprise. "I assumed that you'd want to go shopping or something," he said. "We rarely leave the house."
Harry and Draco didn't return to the aurors. After all that had happened, they were content to set that part of their lives behind. Their son was precious to them and they didn't want to miss a moment him.
After a few cleaning charms, Harry gathered Draco into his arms for a cuddle. A glance at the clock told him that it was past midnight. Christmas Day. "Today is our anniversary," Harry said softly.
“Please don’t,” Harry panted, tilting his head and pressing another hot, open-mouthed kiss to Draco’s neck.
"You have no idea," Harry murmured.
Kingsley pulled a small bottle of veritaserum from one pocket and poured three drops into one prisoner's mouth. A moment later, the wizard's face went slack and his eyes became glassy. Satisfied, Kingsley looked at Ron expectantly.
Protuding from Harry's back were a pair of enourmous wings. They were large enough that Ron was sure they would drag the ground when Harry stood up. The feathers were mostly a pale gray with the edges lined in a darker gray. The wings almost looked silver in the light.
"This is Harry," Ron said, smiling softly as Harry began sucking his thumb again.
Of course, Grant had later asked about the couple later on in the day. Ron really hated to be dishonest with his partner. The relationship between auror partners was important. They had to rely on one another and trust was essential. But Ron had shrugged off his guilt and assured Grant that the couple was simply waiting out the mysterious dark wizards.
It was brilliant. Draco was flooded with pleasure and contentment. It was almost overwhelming.
The sun was setting, painting the sky in pink and orange. They'd been outside for hours.
Draco bit his lip, shooting Harry a hopeful look. Harry grinned. He'd had a difficult time denying Draco anything before, but now that he'd witnessed his lover carrying and then birthing their egg... Draco pretty much got whatever he wanted. "Would you like that?" Harry asked, leaning close to press a warm kiss just behind Draco's ear.
"What's the catch?" she asked with a scowl.
"Would you bring us some tea?" Harry asked.
A knock at the door drew their attention and Kingsley opened to reveal Pansy Parkinson. "What has Potter done to Draco?" she demanded loudly.
"I feel like an idiot," Draco grumbled, leaning his head against Harry's.
Harry chirped loudly in alarm. "Calm down," Draco chuckled. "I'm putting you to bed. Tuck your wings in."
Draco sighed, moving to pull Harry's little hand away. He stilled when Pansy hissed at him. "Let that little darling hold on to you if he likes," she commanded in a whisper. "Just look at that sweet face."
"Thank you," Draco responded. He hummed happily as he but into one of the eggrolls. After swallowing, he glanced at his egg pensively. "It's strange isn't it? This consuming love for a tiny person you haven't even met yet... I just can't get over it."
"I don't know how women do it," Draco sighed. "I already feel swollen and hideous."
Draco adjusted his clothing with a sigh of relief. Any time now, he'd be pushing a huge egg out of his body. If the experience was as horrible as it sounded they probably wouldn't be having any more children. Harry would just have to be content with one.
Harry had just finished his lunch when there was a loud knock on the door. He went to the door and opened it cautiously. He threw it wide open when he saw Draco.
"Your magic has adapted to the changes in your DNA," Hermione said. "It seems that..." She paused, biting her lip.
“We were waiting all bloody night!” Blaise shouted back looking annoyed.  Seamus, Dean, Neville and Hannah all nodded their agreement.
This was a common complaint from Draco. Harry just rolled his eyes and summoned the quilt that Draco had come to favor. Harry dutifully draped the quilt over Draco's body. "Completely spoilt," Harry murmured, though he sounded amused instead of annoyed.
"Massive," Draco replied with a weary little chuckle.
Harry nodded in understanding. Molly and Narcissa had assured them that they'd stop feeling horrifically guilty ever time their son so much as whimpered. But so far, Draco and Harry were struggling.
"The story would be so good that she likely won't complain much about you restricting her... embellishment tendencies," Pansy commented.
"Er- That's obviously not grooming," Ron said softly, leaning a bit closer to Pansy.
A few minutes later, the medi-witch returned and marched right over to Harry, handing him the other twin. Harry froze for a moment, but relaxed when the baby reached up and tried to grab Harry's glasses.
"We've stabilized them," Hermione said, her voice wavering. "There was... an unexpected complication."
Kingsley stared at Harry and Draco with an unreadable expression. It was his first time to see the wings for himself. Robards had seen them just after their release from the hospital and the man hadn't been exaggerating. Their wings were lovely to behold. As for the men themselves...
"Yes, that was the day the men at fault were arrested," Draco said. "But not before they attacked our home. Harry and I were keeping them away from the egg and Harry was nearly killed."
Draco's own attempt was even less graceful. He wasn't flapping hard enough to keep himself in the air. But Harry caught his hands and kept him up. "Flap harder," Harry panted in encouragement. "You can do it. Just focus on your wings."
Draco frowned. "You?" he asked.
Draco carefully picked up his squirming son, his heart twisting at the sound of James' pitiful cries. After a week, Draco still couldn't bare the sound of his baby boy crying. It made Draco want to cry as well.
"Don't call him that," Harry said sharply. He rolled his eyes when Kreacher simply turned his back and proceeded to ignore Ron's presence entirely. "Please take Malfoy and myself to my home." He shot Room an apologetic look. "We'll stay put."
"They said that we were testing it," Harry remembered suddenly. "We were test subjects." Hermione pursed her lips in disapproval.
"Oh my god!" Draco wailed, burying his face against Harry's shoulder again. "Stupid cow!" he cried, though his voice was muffled by Harry's robes.
Draco stared at him for a moment before his mouth fell open in surprise.  “You sneaky bastard!” Draco exclaimed, swatting Harry’s chest indignantly.
Until Draco swiftly removed Harry's trousers and tugged down his pants. Before Harry could make a sound, Draco's mouth was on Harry's cock. Harry's groan was loud and delightfully shameless. His knees nearly buckled as pleasure burned through him.
As promised, Draco returned to Harry's house carrying with a basket of food. Harry watched silently while Draco set up bowls of hot soup, fresh bread and butterbeer. They sat down at the dining table and started eating.
"What are you waiting for?" Harry teased. He turned and sauntered up the stairs with Draco on his heels.
Lucius remained silent for most of the meal. He'd switched out the wine for firewhiskey, wishing that he could drink away the whole absurd situation. Draco was also nursing his own firewhiskey, fantasizing about snogging Harry on the dining table just to annoy his father.
Pansy squealed in excitement. "That's wonderful!" she enthused. "I need to go get some things so I can spend the night."
Ron was relieved when the healers finished cleaning up all the blood. He sat down on a chair near Harry's bed, determined to be there when Harry and Draco woke up.
Draco gave a little huff, looking down. "I swear, if anyone else makes me cry today, I'm going to kill everyone," he growled.
"Hard to imagine that the savior of the wizarding world came from such humble beginnings," Pansy murmured, handing each of the boys another biscuit. "That someone so important and powerful was neglected and despised by his own family. Harry's a good boy," she added sweetly, pleased that it made Harry grin at her.
"It was nice seeing you," Hermione added as Ron began to lead her away. Draco watched them go before departing himself.
Draco moved to open the window, huffing in annoyance when the owl landed on the counter top and tried to preen Harry's feathers. "That's my husband you feathery git," Draco grumbled. "Do your job and get out of here."
"Thank you," Draco said, hugging Luna briefly. Questioning it was pointless. And Draco was honestly delighted. He turned to Harry with a smile. "We're having a girl!" he cried out joyfully, laughing when Harry let out an excited trill.
Pansy scrutinized the two men sharp eyes. "Are you really alright?" she asked, noting the faint redness around Draco's eyes.
Harry nodded in understanding. "Why don't I work on that while Hermione examines you today?" he suggested. He raised a hand to forestall Draco's argument. "I know you can do it, but I would really like for you to relax. Just let me at least try."
Draco stared at Harry with wide eyes. Thoughts tumbled through his mind, fighting to gain his focus. After a few moments, Draco placed his hand next to Harry's on his stomach, where their child rested. "So, I guess we're doing this," Draco managed to say with a watery smile.
"Harry Potter, if you propose right after that ridiculous conversation, I will castrate you," Draco threatened.
Pansy was one of Draco's closest friends. So, naturally, when Draco was made Harry's auror partner, Pansy felt that she needed to be supportive. At first she suspected that Harry was going to sabotage or humilate Draco, but Harry had won her over with surprising ease. Draco had been shocked and a little annoyed about that.
They found Draco at the stove, stirring the tomato sauce and gently rocking the egg in one arm while he talked quietly. "Your daddy is a bloody idiot sometimes," he said softly. "But he takes care of us. He loves us so much. And your Uncle Ron would never let anything happen to you." He drew in a shaky breath. "We'll be alright," he added, as if the egg needed the reassurance as much as he did.
A white crib, with looping vines etched into the wood, stood against one wall. There was a mobile attached that had artificial birds hanging from it in pastel colors. A matching bureau rested along another wall and a toy chest sat in the corner.
“Here.”
Draco rolls his eyes, “Yes, Potter. Luna is our cousin on our father’s side. Her mother was my aunt.”
“I did NOT have a crush on him, I just thought he was cool.” Draco crossed his arms over his chest, pouting, but there was a tint of pink on his cheeks.
Theo and his group passed the common room and Draco made sure to give them his worst stink eye. He didn’t care if Vince and Greg were part of that group, Theo was going down. He and Daphne were never close with the rest of them when they were kids as they preferred doing things alone rather than with everyone else. That was fine, Draco even understood sometimes, but that didn’t excuse the rude behaviour he always had towards them which he had ignored since they had known each other since they were in diapers.
She rolls her eyes but says nothing else as the CD continues. A motor sound blasts through the speakers and I jump up from my seat, startled, causing Pansy to hit her head hard on my shoulder. She’s annoyed with me but my eyes are glued to the screen. I realise it’s one of those muggle contraptions, a motorcycle. Hagrid here brightens up at seeing himself.
Susan grinned, “Sure! Take as many as you want.”
Up at the teachers table, Professor McGonogall smiles, “Your parents were probably my most easiest parents to convince.”
One thing as well is that the people who came back from the dead or people who just appeared are: the Weasleys (including Fred but not the parents), two OC's named Lucy and Rachel, Oliver Wood, Marcus Flint, and just other random people or students that already graduated. The Dursely's are not here though. In the later books, Sirius and Remus, Tonks, etc. will appear. The teachers for that movie will appear as well (except Quirrell cause he died)
She switches the bags with me, “I heard from Daphne that you had to do something with Potter and if you’re associating with Potter and Draco in the same room, it can never turn out good so I just wanted to wish you good luck,” I smile and that and give her a hug, when I let go she adds, “But seriously, you can’t have a blue handbag with all that other blue, it’s too much.”
I stare at him, “I’m gay David and aren’t you dating this guy in your year?”
Justin scowls, “Shut up, Malfoy.”
“Oh,” Dumbledore said, “I do believe these seats are uncomfortable so,” He swishes his wands and we all are levitated and the seat change into movie chairs and we are placed back down. We are more compact now into a group but I am still next to my friends and brother.
My brother groans and so does Potter. I shake my hand at them, “We got through a war, I think we can do this.”
On screen, our mother opens her mouth to reply but is interuptted. The floo sounded and someone entered the manor. The two kids turn around and grin at the person. He was dressed in all black and held two presents in his hands along with a letter. They run up to hug him.
The screen goes black and then turns back on. A young boy with dark brown hair to match his skin was staring at the Nimbus 2000 broom. Dean Thomas groans and Finnigan laughs, patting him on the back. The scene doesn't last long, he talks with another boy who he doesn’t seem to know very well about wishing he had the broom. It quickly changes.
I stare at him, “They’re nice animals. You’re just angry because one of them bit you when you three.”
“Sounds like you.” Blaise mutters under his breath.
Cassiopeia had finally made it. She was going to Hogwarts with her brother! It was like a dream come true. Now all she needs to do is: 1) get sorted into Slytherin, 2) make her parents proud enough that they don't disown her, 3) make sure no one finds out her true identity, 4) make more friends, 5) stop Draco from annoying Gryffindors and making a fool of himself (*cough* Harry Potter and his friends *cough*), 6) help Draco become nicer (a must!) and 7) re-establish the whole idea of Slytherin House.
Gemma magicked the stuff away and they returned back to their seats. The other groups left got checked and then it was over. Draco looked over and saw Theo and his group looking proud of themselves so they obviously passed. He wasn’t disappointed since he didn’t want Vince and Greg to be laughed at but he was still upset over the pumpkin juice. Telling from Pansy’s pointed glare at them, he wasn’t the only one.
“What if it hadn’t been me knocking and it was some other my house and they saw you shirtless?” I asked, teasing him.
“Don't forget the juice.”
Somehow, the Gryffindors hear and Potter chuckles, “It fits him then. A terrible name for a terrible child.”
but i flicker from
Finally, we reach a table in the back where Rosa Parkinson, David Zabini and Astoria Greengrass are sitting. They see us and grin, David flips his hair back and winks at me, “Hey there gorgeous.”
“How can you be a banker and
“Why were the fireworks red? Aren’t our colours green and silver?”
“That little-” Draco growled, his hands balled into fists at his side.
Gabby :)
Young Draco and I grab our respected presents and rip them open. I’m more gentler than my brother but he gasps as he holds up a book. It was about psychology and the wizard mind when spells are applied to them. I wasn’t interested in that stuff but at a young age, Draco would read anything he could about it. My gift was a plain bracelet with pendants on it. There was a snake, a crown, a flower and a cat. You could buy more but I loved it already. But then I noticed the small bag which when I opened it, held a necklace. The pendant on it was a healing crystal. Those crystals inhanced healing spells and coud cure small injuries. I gasped and with a stern look from Severus, I hid it from my parents piercing gaze.
Cass shrugs, “Mother never said we couldn’t.”
Over at the Slytherin table, Cass watched the other first years go up to the stool and get sorted. Around her were the other Slytherins that had so far been sorted here. This included Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle, Millicent Bulstrode- a half-blood though her family were part of the Sacred 28-, Daphne Greengrass- another family of the Sacred 28-, and Tracey Davis.
The girls wouldn’t know but after this moment, the three were destined to be friends for the next seven years of Hogwarts. It slightly worried Cassiopeia about the difference in blood for if her parents found out she was associating with people lesser than her, they would not be happy. She knew her friends wouldn’t mind and they just needed to be lectured about how blood purity was ridiculous and be told off when they were mean but that didn’t mean all the Slytherins would like it. A few older students would probably be checking up on the Malfoy twins to report back to their father so she and Draco both would need to be careful with who they were friends with and how open their friendships were.
Her brother understood this but she could tell he was disappointed that their father was not here. It would all go away when their father bought something expensive for him. Draco would brighten up and all would be forgiven and her brother would be back to admire their father. She knew her father saw it as well and she worried about how easily Draco could be persuaded. She worried that one day her words would not be enough and the darkness would suck him into it where their father was waiting.
Greg pats my shoulder, “Just do it, if you leave a bunch of treats after the kidnap, it won’t mind, hopefully,” He looks over at Vincent, “Do owls have anything against us Slytherins?” Vincent shrugs and we all roll our eyes, most owls don’t care but there are some that are picky. I’ll just have to pick the right one.
There was no doubt what house Weasley would be in. The red head sauntered up to the stool and within a minute, the hat was already shouting out it’s answer.
“Well that was rude!” The girl Weasley, Ginerva, yells at the on-screen Dudley.
“We can play spin the bottle?” Millie asks innocently.
Cassiopeia doesn't question his weird taste in cats and grins, "Brilliant! Let's go show mother so we can pay for them."
“Wow.”
for you -
Her mother wraps her arm around Hannah’s shoulder,
Tomorrow’s going to be one crazy day.
“Ex-death eater.” I correct, “And that’s why we’re watching these CD’s. Perhaps after, everyone will know us as misunderstood children who had no choice.”
I hear Draco mutter, “Properly from another one of his adoring fans.” and I’m thankful that no one hears it. Just from these glimpses in Potter’s life I can tell he wasn’t as loved as we believed him to be.
Cass and Draco whooped and hollered for their friend and patted him on the back when he sat across from them. Pansy was even clapping for him which was a shock since the two didn't get along that well. This was a nice end to the sorting, two Slytherin’s in a row. There were plenty of new Slytherins this year, Cass counted 18 students including herself. All their friends were here with them and they would be sharing a common room with them for the next seven years.
The words are in French and I relax into my seat. No one will be able to understand us. This was a relief. Unfortunately, other people are not as happy as us.
Also, Cass has been changing a lot through the chapters, she was nice in the other one but I bit meaner in this one. I would like to just say that she is still a Malfoy and though she knows that not all muggles are bad or that stuff, she still doesn’t like the Gryffindors. Also in this chapter, there isn’t as much drarry because I forgot that the two had a crush on each other (i thought they were still oblivious).
“Hogwarts robes, dear?” The lady asked and Cassiopeia nodded, telling her exactly what her mother said to get.
Both me and Draco were not happy to see Justin’s name on the list since he once tried to get me to date him several times but we weren’t just going to go against Dumbledore’s orders and just exclude someone. Though, we did just add five extra people but adding and subtracting were two very different things.
His sister peered over her shoulder as he continued to flip through the book. Nothing was written on any of the pages, it was just blank. He decided to research it later so he tucked it into his pants back pocket. All of this giving him a bad vibe but he wasn’t sure why.
Cass and Draco clapped to be polite but there was really no need because half of the Gryffindor table was the Weasley’s family and they were cheering like crazy. Weasley flustered under the attention when he sat down and his brothers all clapped him on the back or brought him into a hug but Cass could tell he was enjoying it. The Great Hall quietened down and the next name was read out.
“Hey, you’re up early. Thought you’d need all your beauty sleep for the first day.”
Weasley snorts but Draco and I don't even snap at him, just sunk in our seats. Pansy rests a hand on my shoulder and its comforting but not enough. Some of the Gryffindors, including Potter and Granger, glance our way but I ignore the stares that pierce through my brothers and I's skulls.
That bottle of pumpkin juice he stole would not be forgotten.
“It’s ‘early bird gets the worm’ but you used it correctly.” Millie threw a thumbs up in Daphne’s direction to which she beamed at. Daphne had always been fascinated by muggle things and since Millicent was a half-blood, she had the perfect teacher.
“Welcome little snakes, to the kitchen,” One of the twins said but Cass wasn’t paying attention to them anymore.
Hannah spins her head over to him, sitting on a chair near the window. She eyes him before saying, “Do you have something to say?”
I shrug, “They would be more fun than the other houses.”
The others lightened up and Pansy shook her head, “No, that’s just called being smart.”
Blaise grinned, “Yep, let’s head back it’s- wow, it’s already 4pm.”
Blaise scoffed but didn’t argue, “Okay; First: a book from the Restricted Area of the Library”
And I know they're pretty mad at Theo for stealing their juice (even tho they said sabotaging allowed) but when you 11 years old, don't lie, you'd have done the same.
"Ah, Ms Black and Mr Malfoy. I do not remember there being a child of a Black but I am not up to date with recent events." The old man, Ollivander, says and Cass lets out a sigh of relief, "Do, come in. I'll start with Ms Black first. Step right up dear and hold out your dominant hand."
He says. His sister may be pushing him out of his comfort zone but she was right in the end.
I give him a side hug, “Because they knew you would win if they didn’t threaten you with expulsion.”
A few people laugh at the comment but the silence comes. I can only assume this is what a zoo is. It looks different from a wizarding zoo because we have different animals but the muggle zoo has the same concept. Animals kept in cages or areas for people to come and look at.
I must warn that this may bring up old memories and feelings but hopefully, the end result will be worth it. If anything goes wrong, do not hesitate to call out my name and I will appear as a ghost-like figure.
“Are you like cousins?” Potter questions but I grasp Draco’s arm, “Well, look at the time. Let's go Draco.”
I nod, unable to speak. I had never seen anything like it and neither had Draco so I assumed it was a muggle object. It interested me so I was sure to search up ‘projector’ later. Dumbledore told us to take a seat at our table so we did and soon, students began to fill in, all of them people I remembered were on the list. I was searching for students who weren’t on it but it seemed no one that wasn’t on the list were interested in coming.
Hagrid, who is sitting on the teachers table, frowns at this and tries to make eye contact with her but she seems to be trying to avoid it.
I don’t say anything back. Thinking about it, there are plenty of people who got a good family and looks. Most of the Slytherins, well at least the purebloods, were in the second category. There were also a lot of ones that had the worst of both worlds.
Pansy huffs, “Don’t act all annoyed Cass, you cheated too.”
Hannah smiles widely again and leans into her mother, giving her a half hug,
He was leading them to the lake and she could spot multiple boats in the water. Were they meant to row to Hogwarts? The view would be spectacular but if they were supposed to do it themselves then she would much rather go on the carriages with the other year levels. It was four to a boat so Pansy and Blaise clamber into a boat alongside Cass and Draco. Thankfully the boats were magicked to sail by themselves and so Cass positioned herself to stare up at the huge castle on the hill.
Draco awoke with a gasp, sitting up from the couch he had fallen asleep on. Perseus was perched on the armrest along with another owl, a letter on his leg sealed with the Blanc stamp, Matthias surname. He spots his sister sleeping on the couch opposite and grins, they must have fallen asleep while waiting for Matthias reply. He grins as he takes the letter of the owl. Ripping it open, he reads in his head the letter.
“The stupid hat told me you made it promise you we’d be put in the same house.” He says.
I make my way to the three of them, Draco following behind me. I don’t even glance at the other two, just stare at Potter, “Have you told your little friends already, Potter?”
