“Andromeda’s,” Draco mumbled, still keeping his eyes closed, not wanting to open them and see who was in front of him. But he knew, which made him even more determined to not make it real. Draco could hear Harry sigh, as he guided him off the chair and into a standing position. His legs were wobbly, and he could hear someone behind him laugh as Harry took a firm grip around him so that he wouldn’t fall over.
As they stood by the elevator, Harry grabbed Draco’s hand again, intertwining their fingers. It was a confusing feeling, the one that spread through Draco, but as they stepped into the elevator he couldn't help but to lean into Harry, placing a kiss in his hair. Harry looked at him with that look on his face, that Draco had been fortunate to see only once before. Harry looked contented.
“Draco, dear.” Andromeda hugged him tightly at the door. “I’m glad you could make it. You shouldn’t be working during the Christmas holiday.” She shook her head at him.
“You’re drawing attention to us, Bert. Remember how we said that we should keep a low profile?” Harry whispered.
He took a quill and a piece of paper, and he wrote down a short message for Ron, deciding to send it by owl later that evening. He looked around the store, let a hand sweep across the counter. He paid for a tiny fire-breathing dragon, the one that he and Ron had joked about. Maybe he could give it to Scorpius. Then he left the store, not knowing what would greet him when he came back.
“I’ve thought about this.” Harry whispered in his ear. “Thought about you, bending me over your desk. Your precious papers flying everywhere.”
Remembering what Harry told him, to not contradict Narcissa’s beliefs, he nodded in response. “I’ll call the Aurors, but you have to come inside to make your statement.”
Draco tried to feel happy about getting the bed to himself, but he couldn’t help but feel that it was wrong somehow. He started to unpack and put his clothes in the closet. He picked out his outfit for the day and slipped into the bathroom. With the new outfit on, he was just about to ask Harry if he was done, when he turned around and dropped his shoe that he was holding.
know that. He looked pleadingly over to Malfoy, trying to convey with his eyes that he should come up with an excuse to save Harry’s sorry arse. But he just smirked in response.
“Zabini? Zabini is your brilliant idea how we’ll solve this?” Harry asked Draco with a frown. “No offence, Zabini!”
As he approached, he saw Blaise talking to Potter, and they stood awfully close together. Draco could once again see the beads of sweat breaking out on Potter’s forehead. Potter was clutching his glass in his hand, holding it so tightly that his knuckles were whitening. Blaise was leaning into Potter and had a hand on his lower back, stroking it up and down. A really bad feeling spread through Draco. He felt like he tasted something terribly bitter, and that he was going to be sick. He refused to examine that feeling any closer, but something told him to break up this encounter immediately. Anyone with eyes could see that Potter was uncomfortable. He didn’t know why he cared or thought that he could solve this situation, but his body made the decision before his brain caught up. He squeezed himself between the two of them and nodded at Potter before he turned to Blaise.
“I didn’t go that far. I came here.” Potter seated himself on the edge of Draco’s desk. “I was thinking that you might show up.”
Draco scoffed, but he smiled as Andromeda let go of Scorpius and pulled Draco in for a hug instead, just a little too tight for comfort.
Harry couldn’t help the giggle that escaped him. He was so occupied with laughing that he didn’t bother to correct Seamus about the “fancying Malfoy” thing. He was just a great partner, that was all. A great, fit partner. With beautiful eyes. Pretty much everything one could wish for in a work partner. And now was the most perfect time to tell him.
He didn’t seem to mean it in a bad way, and Draco still clung to the words that Harry actually didn’t hate him. “Is it bothering you?” he asked gently, instead of lashing out which he would’ve done in the past.
“Really, Potter?” This he could do. Giving snarky responses to stupid questions. He didn’t often fall back to his old ways, but when there came a chance to save his own face, he took it. “What does one do in the restroom at this fine establishment?” Draco turned and washed his hands before continuing. “If not gossiping with friends, I mean?” He looked at Potter again.
“You keep telling yourself that.” Pansy smiled, a bit softer this time. “I need to go, Ginny wants a nightcap.” Pansy winked at Draco. “Sleep tight, darling.” She blew him a kiss and ended the call.
“She has never forgotten her journal before. She writes in it everyday,” Draco said, almost daring his father to contradict him.
Two hours later Draco could feel his head spin. He’d been talking to the wizard Shacklebolt wanted him to meet, and though he loved his job, there was a limit to how much time he could spend on explaining something that the other party clearly didn’t understand. He excused himself after agreeing they would continue this over owl, and headed to the bar for some much needed alcohol.
Harry took care of the cleaning charm and then draped the cover over both of them. Draco was almost asleep when Harry kissed him goodnight.
Draco’s body made the decision for him before his mind caught up, and he spurted come all over Harry’s bed, clenching hard around Harry’s cock while he was still pounding into him. He slumped down on the bed again, arse still high in the air when Harry groaned as his cock throbbed inside of him. Draco almost felt too full, but he kept rocking backwards until Harry stopped him and slowly withdrew himself.
Harry looked over at him and smiled. “I take the couch, of course. I crash on yours all the time. I’ll be fine!” He went in and threw his bag on the floor beside the sofa and started to rummage through it.
Draco winced at the words, but he knew that he brought this on himself so he nodded in response. “What’s in the boxes then?” he asked.
Draco’s eyes widened, but he took Harry’s hand and sat down. Harry let Draco fasten his seatbelt and then took his hand again, stroking his thumb over Draco’s knuckles.
“I’m sorry, Mr Malfoy,” she said, not sounding sorry at all. “There’s a long waiting list for all of our Healers. Perhaps try to call back after a couple of months or so?”
“He thinks that you don’t like him,” Ron shrugged. “You never talk to him when you see each other, and he says that you make it rather clear you don’t want to spend time with him. You even rejected him after Hermione’s party when he wanted to ask you out, he told me about it after you went home.”
Harry was a wreck the next day. After an embarrassing quick wank, he’d managed to get a couple of hours of sleep, dreaming of slender hands and ropes being tied too tight. At least he was alive, he told himself, looking at the image of himself in the mirror next morning. He wasn’t a pretty sight, but then again, he never thought he was. He met up with Hermione and Ron in the great hall for breakfast, both looking at him with worried eyes, then at each other, having what they thought was a discreet conversation with raised eyebrows and nodding of their heads towards Harry.
“Of course, Andie. She should’ve gotten an appointment right away, I only did what they should’ve done.”
Harry was trembling on the desk, he parted his legs as much as the trousers around his ankles let him, and pushed back on Draco’s fingers. “Stop being such a fucking tease and fuck me already.”
“Back to Weasley, are we?” Ron snorted. “And Harry knows you have changed. He talks about you all the time, sometimes I need to ask him to shut up and ask you out already, but he’s too chickenshit to do it. He just thinks that you hate him.”
Draco slammed his folder down on the table, “Dora! Harry Potter is not fat. And even if he was, so what? The man saved the whole fucking world, can we please let him be? His hair is fine! His beard is fine! And I’m pretty sure he’s also a very fine lover!” Draco slumped down in his chair and dragged a hand over his face. Dora looked at him with wide eyes.
There was a loud ringing in his ears. He could see Potter’s lips moving, but he couldn’t understand the words he was saying. His mother’s hand was gripping his own tightly, tears slowly making tracks down her cheeks. Beside her, Andromeda looked serious, as she clasped Narcissa’s other hand.
“Please don’t be late tonight Draco. I want you to meet with a friend of mine from Estonia, he’s been dying to meet you and quiz you about the analysing system you came up with.”
“My father sent her away and I didn’t even notice.” He shook his head. “How long has she been here?”
Draco put Scorpius in his bed before he went and got himself ready for the night. He would have to have a conversation with his parents in the morning about not letting Scorpius stay up this late. When he was done, he slowly let himself under the covers so he wouldn’t wake Scorpius, but when he put an arm around him he turned towards Draco, still awake.
Draco didn’t know what to say. Somehow Potter thought they were involved. And though Draco knew that this was probably something he wanted, he couldn’t help but feel it was wrong. Like a decision had been made without him having a say in it, and he couldn’t deal with feeling like that ever again. Draco shook his head. “I need to figure this out, Potter! This isn’t right. I don’t remember this.” Draco waved his hand between them, indicating what he meant.
Hermione snorted. “You mentioned work already, Harry. Maybe you’ve had enough to drink for tonight?”
It was the third Ministry charity ball in just as many weeks. It had something to do with raising money for plants this time, Draco thought. Or was it war orphans? He had no clue, he got the invitations and attended no matter what, like a good Ministry boy.
They arrived at an empty Portkey office. Harry looked at Draco like he was contemplating something, but said nothing. He gave Draco a brief hug without saying a word, then he apparated before Draco managed to hug him back.
They sat in silence for a while, Narcissa still crying, and both Draco and Andromeda holding on to her for dear life. When the silence had stretched out for too long, Draco cleared his throat, “Potter, could I get a word alone?”
He was head down on a carpet at Harry’s place, never had he been more mortified in his entire life and Harry didn’t want him to go anywhere. This was awful. He didn’t know how long he was lying there before he felt Harry’s hands on him again, helping him up and then lowering him down on a couch. He could feel a phial being pressed into his hand, and he gingerly lifted it to his mouth and drained the content. He had a firm grip on the couch with his other hand as the potion made its way through his body. He was sweating by the time it started working.
“Fine! I’ll go find her myself.” Draco pushed away from the counter and began walking down the corridors yelling for his mother. He could hear Moira calling after him but he ignored her. He was going to find his mother and he didn’t care if she sent the guards after him. What he hadn't accounted for was Harry running towards him, dragging him from the door he was banging on.
“You only said the truth, and that’s all I ask for. I reacted badly, I shouldn’t have stormed out of your office like that, and I’m sorry for the chair.”
Ron let out a whistle to get attention from Kristoff, indicating they were leaving. Draco didn’t think the man could scowl any deeper but he was sorely mistaken. He could almost see the smoke coming out of his ears. Ron was out through the door first, but Kristoff slowed down before he caught up with him. He stopped by the door, he looked at Draco and then he kicked over an umbrella stand before rushing out, several snake umbrellas started to slither around on the floor, scurrying away before Draco could catch them. He was in for some overtime today it seemed.
Draco was sitting at his desk looking over some papers Shacklebolt had left him. He was deep in his reading when the door to the office was slammed open, and a furious Harry Potter stormed out. He was halfway through the room when Shacklebolt appeared in his doorway.
Potter startled and took a small step back, making his drink slosh over his hand. Draco could feel his stomach clench with the urge to grab Potter’s hand and lick the liquor off his fingers. He shook his head to make the images go away, and turned to Shacklebolt.
Harry shook his head at the flight attendant who was heading her way and pulled Draco’s arm down. “We haven’t even been in the air for an hour, perhaps you should stick to water from now on.”
“Malfoy?” A hand was placed on Draco’s shoulder pulling him back. He turned and was met with Potter’s worried expression. “What’s going on? Are you hurt?” Potter turned to the receptionist. “What’s going on here Moira? Why hasn’t anyone helped him?”
Draco could only blink, trying to make sense of the words he had heard before and after he zoned out. He cleared his throat before speaking. “I’m sorry, Potter. Why wouldn’t she be able to live at home?”
Draco hummed in response. Finally, he opened his eyes slowly, letting them get used to the soft light around him before he turned his head towards Harry. He was leaning against the couch, his head only an arm's length away from Draco’s, Harry’s warm green eyes looking at him.
“My feelings?” Harry tried to steady his gaze, but Ron was sliding in and out of focus. He shook his head and swallowed a couple of times, because his throat felt very dry. But, thinking about drinking something made Harry’s stomach turn ominously. “I have feelings?”
“It’s been a while,” Draco huffed out on the pillow, moaning when another finger slipped in alongside the first one.
Just when the dragon was opening its snout, Ron tossed the thing away in Draco’s direction, he caught it midair and put it down on the window shelf again, the dragon puffing smoke out of its nose.
“Draco? What happened?” He stroked his fingers gently over Draco’s cheek, where he must still have a red mark from one of his mother’s rings which he’d forgotten to spell away.
Malfoy kept mostly to himself buried in books as far as Harry knew, so Harry had many opportunities to look his fill without Malfoy noticing him. His hair was longer now, and it shouldn’t be so mesmerizing Harry thought, he should be appalled by Malfoy growing out his hair like his father. But Malfoy didn’t resembled Lucius at all. All his features that Harry before had named pointy and annoying, were now everything that made Malfoy so bloody gorgeous. His paleness, his sharp cheekbones, his long fingers that Harry wished could touch him. He always imagined Malfoy being cold, and was curious to see if he’d been wrong about that amongst everything else he’d been wrong about.
"Harry wanted to be alone for a little while. I think I'm going to go for a walk, I'll see you guys later." And with that he walked out of the portrait door, sighing in relief as he leaned against a wall. Not even seconds later he felt something tugging on his hand, dragging him forward. He freaked for a second, and, remembering it was Harry, let him drag him up to the kitchens.
"What's wrong, Harry?" a voice asked him. Draco's voice. All Harry could do was hold up the hand that was still holding onto the letter, and the blond carefully removed it, then read it.
"I don't even think he realized I was in there. He just ran in, grabbed his invisibility cloak, and ran back out."
"We have excellent reasons. Hermione, how would you like to become a part of Operation Drarry?" The boys smirked, though they were nervous that she wouldn't help, that she'd hate the idea even.
Ron took his last breath, and with that, he was gone. He fell to the floor carelessly, landing in a position that couldn't have been comfortable. But it didn't matter, did it? Because he was dead, he couldn't feel pain anymore. But it didn't feel like he was dead. It felt like he would get back up, and start laughing with Harry about the dumbest things. Because he wasn't dead, he couldn't be.
"Well...uh, you see, I was on the seventh floor. I was walking in one of the corridors, when I saw Harry fall against a wall, near the Room of Requirements. I walked over and he was panting and shaking. I picked him up, and ran to the hospital," he said, tweaking the story just slightly. Hermione eyed him carefully, before nodding her head, and sitting back down in the seat next to Draco.
Harry stared down at the now full plate of food. He felt sick just looking at it all. Harry shook his head, and pushed his plate slightly forward.
"Harry," she began, making him jump a little. "Did you hear? We're going back to Hogwarts!" She tried to sound cheery for her friend, hoping to see a smile on his face, something he did so little nowadays.
"He-hem." The two turned to face Umbridge, disgust on both of their faces. "Since Mr. Potter has failed to meet the requirements of our meeting, I'm afraid-"
Hermione cleared her throat, and the boys broke apart, both blushing. "I came to check on Harry, since you seemed so worried," she said, mostly to the Slytherin. "May I ask why you were so worried to begin with?" Harry shifted uncomfortably, eventually just sitting down on the couch.
"Don't lie to me. Now, take them off." With a side glance at Hermione, he sighed, grabbing his wand. Hermione held her breath while Harry took the spell off. "Now take your shirt off."
"Your turn, Goldie. Who's your horrible soulmate that you apparently hate?" Pansy slowed her pace as she spoke, a realization coming to her head, both a blessing and a curse. She prayed she was wrong.
"So...his looks. You didn't mention one single thing about his personality, just his physical features."
"But I want to talk to you. Ginny told me about the breakup, and I was just wondering how you were doing. It must be weird, her liking someone else while she was dating you. Unless, of course, you liked someone else too." Hermione smirked again, waiting for Harry's eyes to widen, or some sort of sign. But there was nothing...he just looked puzzled.
Ginny nodded carefully, getting up to retrieve Luna. Hermione retreated back out the doors. Pulling out her wand, she sent a Patronus to all the Weasley's saying similar things. She then set off to the eighth year dorms, feeling quite alone.
"I freed him Draco, or rather tricked your father into doing it. Didn't he ever tell you? Besides, Dobby works in the Hogwarts kitchens, so I see him all the time. He even gave me socks for Christmas last year," Harry laughed, throwing his head back. Draco blinked at him.
Draco had no idea what the Gryffindor could be dealing with that Pansy needed to help him with. He seemed to have the idea that the boy's life was sunshine and rainbows, where everything was perfect. Apparently, he'd either been wrong, or Harry was overreacting about something stupid. Of course, that didn't sound like him at all. So, as much as Draco hated to, he accepted he must have been wrong about something.
"I can hear you!" Ron shouted, which made them laugh harder. Harry liked laughing again, it felt good.
Hermione was about to respond, when the door opened. "Sorry I'm late Harry. Pansy needed help with-" Draco stopped talking when he saw Hermione.
"I'm filling in for Ms. Lovegood, who had to tend to her daughter, who was feeling a bit ill today."
"Harry, mate. You were doing it again. Come on, Hermione found us a carriage with Neville and Luna." Ron gave Harry a worried look, before leading him to the carriages. He looked around. It seemed the thestrals were getting a lot more attention this year.
"Ow," the ginger cried, cradling his head in his hands. Blaise picked up the thing that had hit him. It was a strange black box, with two white circles in the center. It was odd, and Blaise had never seen anything like it before. "Oh, I guess the accio did work."
"That boy is gayer than Merlin himself. Well, bisexual actually. That's what we think anyway," Dean said, trying to calm himself after his fit of laughter.
"Oh," the blond said, before rushing off to his room. Harry's eyes widened, and he turned to the other four.
"Fine," he sighed, sitting back down, "but this doesn't mean I've agreed to anything yet." The three Gryffindors told him the plan, and after much consideration, persuasion, and yelling, Draco Malfoy agreed to this horrid plan.
Harry took a deep breath. What was happening? He loved Ginny, he knew that. It was just so different now.
"I love you too. Wanna go have a juice box?" The other boy nodded eagerly, and the two walked off, still holding hands. Narcissa made a mental note to tease Draco about this when he was older.
"You don't have to hate each other. Hermione and I are friends, and Draco and Potter aren't fighting, though they don't really talk to each other much. Besides, it would make the rest of the year a lot easier if you and your roommate weren't at each other's throats constantly."
"Draco!" his mother cried, causing the two to pull away from one another, Draco with a devilish grin and Harry with an innocent smile.
"Oh come on Malfoy, we're his family. And you're there," Ginny said, peering behind Draco's shoulder for a glimpse of the boy.
"So...you're leaving." Harry nodded, turning around and leaning against the bed frame. "Thanks for, you know, pretending to be my boyfriend." This time it was Harry's turn for his cheeks to heat up. He had totally forgotten they were pretending. It had felt so real, to him at least. "Oh, I have another present for you."
"Oh, would you look at the time? Class will be starting shortly, and I'm afraid I have to get to Potions before Slughorn has a fit. See you!" Pansy stood up, smoothed her robes out, and walked away. Harry scrambled up from the floor, running after her.
"Don't you ever call him that, Ron." Ron gulped and nodded. Harry turned to Draco, and after deeming him alright, faced Ron again. "To answer your question, the reason your not my best mate, is because I see you as a brother." This only seemed to embarrass Ron more, as he flushed and hung his head.
It had been a day since Harry had got released from the hospital. Luckily, Theo and the other two had just ignored each other the whole, otherwise the hospital wing would have most likely been set on fire. Now that Harry was back, the others were ready to take action on Operation Drarry. The first step would be all Hermione, and possibly Draco.
Harry slipped out of the Gryffindor common room and began the far-too-long journey to the Slytherin dorms, where he figured Malfoy would be. The halls were nearly empty, and they were far too quiet for Harry's liking. It wasn't after curfew, but he still felt as though he had to sneak around to avoid being caught.
The couple then went knocking on doors, taking note of everyone. Some were quite annoyed with them, but they felt that this mystery was far more important.
"Harry!" This got his attention, and he looked up to see the flash of green headed his way. He couldn't move, couldn't breathe, he just stared at it. That is, until he felt himself get shoved, and he fell to the ground. Harry looked up just in time to watch the Unforgivable hit Ron square in the chest.
"But he's a Malfoy..." Ron started slowly, looking at the two. They were sitting so close their shoulders were touching, and Ron wondered how they were so comfortable around each other if they hadn't seen each other in eight years.
He caught his breath a bit, then entered the abandoned bathroom. The small dot stopped pacing and looked up at the door that had just opened. "Mischief managed," Harry whispered again, clearing the map.
"How stupid of you. Now go back, tell him you like him, and then ask him to Hogsmeade or something."
"What's wrong?" Pansy had a way of getting information out of people, one way or another, and her friends were no exception. It's how she'd found out about Voldemort living in Draco's house,  Blaise's mum, and Theordore's dyslexia. So she'd figure out what was up with Harry too, and just maybe discover all of his darkest secrets along the way. Not that she'd ever share them, she wasn't evil after all.
"He is welcome to stay in the castle, as long as you can keep him under control. He could sit in with you or Mr. Malfoy during classes, or I suppose Filch can always take care of him."
"We have matters to discuss with you," Dean said, pocketing him want back in his robes. "Sit, why don't you?" The Slytherin nodded, taking a seat at the nearest table, the others doing the same. "Let's get straight to the point, shall we?"
"Now look at what you've done, you've got us caught," Dean said, walking out from the hiding spot, Seamus following.
"You knew Dobby? Well, I hate to break it to you, but some git freed him, so you won't find him here." Harry laughed, and Draco gave him a puzzled look.
"Homophobic? No," Seamus said, looking amused. Now that he looked around the room, so did Dean and Hermione.
"Ok, I have a few things to say. One, this silence is unbearable. Two, Ron, I cannot believe that your hungry right now," she said, acknowledging the noise his stomach was making. "We ate a few hours ago. And three, this thing between us and Malfoy is stupid, and it needs to end right now." Harry and Ron were quiet for about another minute, before Harry spoke.
"No no, that wouldn't be necessary." McGonagall raised an eyebrow, but didn't comment.  "Um...I actually have to get home soon, and I should probably talk to Draco about this thing, so..."
"You're still a kid, Malfoy. And all you did was say nasty things, it's not like you ever hurt any of us. It was Ron who tried to curse you with that disgusting slug curse, and Hermione who punched you. If you think about it, we're a lot worse than you are."
"Dr-draco?" His eyes were wild, lost. They frantically looked around everywhere, moving so fast it made Draco's head hurt a bit. Finally they landed on Draco, and stayed there.
"Ok, so I kinda kissed Hermione, and she probably hates me now. I'm like, ninety percent sure she's straight, and she has a boyfriend. I probably ruined their relationship, and I just...what do I do?" She rushed everything she said, so it was almost impossible to understand her.
"Oh, and yours is SO much better, golden boy." Harry scoffed. "Alright, what's the most embarrassing thing that's ever happened to you?"
It was after those three restless hours that Harry finally did wake up again. Draco was the first one there, for the rest had been pacing the room waiting.
"Guys, Nott's gone too!" Hermione said running up to the three, Ron trailing behind her. He shared a small smile with Blaise, before Harry interrupted.
"That was in a duel, Malfoy. Are you really trying to come up with excuses for me to hate you?" Draco mumbled something inaudible, and the two boarded the train. There was the awkward moment of where to sit, and if they should sit together or not, before they both silently decided they'd rather not be alone for the trip, and went to the nearest empty compartment. They sat down facing opposite each other, then sat in a very uncomfortable silence for a few minutes, until Harry grew tired of it.
"Everything." And with that, the two fell asleep, though Harry woke only two hours later from the nightmares that plague his sleep daily.
Harry walked around the school, just going where his feet were taking him. Eventually he ended up by the lake. It reminded him a bit too much of the one he almost died in less than a year ago. It had been a freezing, icy lake, that he'd almost drowned in. He would have to, if Ron hadn't saved him. Harry was starting to think Ron should have just left him there.
"Well, it turned out fine," Dean smiled, giving Seamus a small kiss on the forehead. Harry nodded, although something else caught his eye, or rather someone. It was Malfoy, walking along the platform, head ducked, people yelling and spitting at him as he walked past them. One man even tried to trip him.
"Too late, it's settled." Draco huffed, crossing his arms. Harry rolled his eyes, what a drama queen.
Post traumatic stress disorder. More commonly known as PTSD. Harry Potter had PTSD. Wait till that got out, he'd make the front page of The Daily Prophet for a week. He groaned at the thought.
It had been three hours since the six arrived at the hospital, and the five conscious ones were a nervous wreck. They hadn't spoken much, except for the first few minutes when Madame Pomfrey and the others questioned Ron about what he'd seen.
Harry scrambled away, running out of that damn house as fast as he could, Ginny following. They apparated away, and Harry thanked Merlin it went better than he thought it ever would. He was free.
Ron got up from the floor, and walked backwards towards the door. "I'm gonna...Harry...yeah," he said, before darting out. He really did go to Harry's though. "Harry, help me. I am having a sexual identity crisis!"
"Madame Pomfrey," he yelled, clutching Harry like the raven-haired boy was his lifeline. Ron and Hermione were frozen in place, looking at the shaking boy in Draco's arms. He turned, and saw the two. "What's happening to him?" Tears started blurring his vision, so he turned before they could see. Madame Pomfrey came rushing in, and her eyes immediately fell on Harry.
Turning the broomstick around, he ignored Ron's cries and flew towards the little ferret, wincing every time he nearly fell. Extending his hand for Draco to grasp, Harry leaned forward slightly, coughing when he engulfed a large whiff of smoke.
"Yes, I'm doing just great, Draco. My parents are dead, so how could I not be?" Draco sighed, and pulled Harry into a hug. Harry relaxed, not realizing how tense he'd been. This was how Hermione found the two when she walked into the room, not knocking because the door was still wide open.
"You've been staring at Malfoy for the past three minutes," Dean answered, holding back a laugh by the looks of it.
After a few moments of thought, Harry concluded that he was supposed to retrieve one of them and that none of the other champions had made it yet, seeing as there were still four. Harry swam up to the hostages. He recognized Hermione, Cho, and Malfoy, but there was another girl, who Harry deemed to be Fleur's sister. The sliver, glistening hair made it fairly obvious.
"Harry, Draco is a boy, like you. Boys don't marry other boys," he stated, smile long gone. Harry looked up into his eyes, tears already threatening to fall.
"Well, because we had good reason to be studying you. And besides, it not like we found out anything new. Dean and I have known you were bi since like, third year."
"Yes, and I live on mars," Draco said, rolling his eyes. He folded his arms and tapped his foot to the ground impatiently, waiting for Harry to get up. Harry still took forever, so Draco picked him up bridal style and carried him out of the room. The smaller boy yelped in surprise. Hermione followed, but froze as she saw Harry's arm.
"Papa! Aunt Hermione and Aunt Pansy are here!" Teddy leaned in closer to whisper in Harry's ear. "Auntie Pansy gave me three whole chocolate frogs, but I'm not s'posed to tell anybody."
"Do you think he's alright? What if he's hurt? Oh, Merlin, what if he's dead? Are we positive Theo took him?"
"We're friends now," he said without looking up from his bag, now searching for a quill and some fresh parchment.
The sight he was greeted with when he approached the ferret's room was...surprising, to say the least. And yeah, he knew Malfoy had his hoodie, but he didn't think it would be
Harry was disgusted with himself. He hated that he was depressed. He hated that he had PTSD. He hated that just looking at food made him want to hurl. He hated his so called friends, that told his biggest secret. He hated all the guilt, and the grief. He hated all this self-pity, because it was sick. He'd had enough. He just wanted the pain to go away.
"N-no, it's not like that. You see, Ron...he's..." Her voice was unsteady, and she just couldn't say it. She motioned for them to go in as she sank to her knees. She hated how weak and vulnerable she looked. When Molly opened the door and saw Ron, she immediately rushed over to him, the rest following. Pansy looked up from where she was seated with Blaise, and her eyes locked on Hermione. She stood up and walked over to her, helping her up. Hermione took shaky steps into the room, her eyes never leaving Ron's body. He was pale now, very pale. As she reached his bed, she lightly held his hand in hers. His fingers were cold and stiff.
The train pulled to a stop at the station in Hogsmeade, the carriages waiting to take then to the school. Harry remembered one of his most recent visits here, that happened just hours before the Battle of Hogwarts.
"First of all, why are you looking for me? You guys don't get to talk after you betrayed me like that. And Ron, are you off you rocker! Malfoy and I didn't hug, and he definitely didn't call me Harry," the boy lied. Ron looked confused. Was he really imagining things now?
Harry walked into the Great Hall, took a seat in between Ron and Hermione, and didn't even bother with breakfast.
"Harry, what's the meaning of this?" she said once a sock landed on top of her hair. She pulled it off, making the mistake of smelling it before dropping it in disgust. Her nose wrinkled, and she made a mental note to scold Ron about it later.
Hermione was crying, and even Draco teared up a bit, though he would never admit it. "I'm sorry, Harry. I was just..." She took a deep breath, trying to slow the tears. "No, there's no excuse for what I did. Just know that I only want what's best for you, and that if I could take it all back, I would."
"Whatever," Draco muttered before throwing a stinging hex at the other boy, and walking out without a second glance. As much as he hated Theo, he didn't have it in himself to seriously hurt him, or anyone really. Draco hated violence and pain, and he hated being the cause of it. All of his fights were verbal, with very few exceptions, this being one of them.
Hermione and Ron watched as Harry stared at the compartment they had occupied in third year, no longer moving. He just...stared at it. A single tear fell and rolled down his left cheek. He hasn't noticed. After five minutes, Ron shook Harry's shoulder lightly, causing him to come back to his senses. He looked over his shoulder at Ron.
Ginny still couldn't wrap her finger around it. She always half-expected to see Ron every time she turned a corner, or during meals. Ginny had only cried once though, and even that was unexpected, because she hadn't cried in years. But Ginny was doing better than some of the others, because she had Luna. Luna, who looked for the good in every situation, who always had the strangest, yet best things to say. So Ginny looked for the happiness, trying to see things as Luna did.
Suddenly there was a hand on his shoulder, startling Harry. He looked up to see Neville, the worry on his face only growing. Why wasn't he at lunch?
"There is, actually. You see, I'm supposed to be visiting my father for Christmas, and I told him I was bringing my boyfriend with me." He struggled with his explanation, speaking too fast, then too slow when he tried to fix it. Merlin, why was this so difficult? He tugged the sides of his coat together, nervous and a bit cold.
"I'm fine. Really I am. Just not very hungry. I think I'll be in the garden of anyone needs me." And with that, he got up, and walked outside. Then he just thought, about everything. He thought about the war, and his friends. He thought about treacle tarts, and his parents. Heck, he even thought about Malfoy.
She scanned the Great Hall, looking for a certain Slytherin, standing up when she found the girl. Hermione made her way over to Pansy, smiling as she watched her girlfriend talking with her friends, loving the smile across the Slytherin's face. Pansy noticed the girl as she got closer, and instead turned her attention over to her.
"Harry, you didn't let me finish. Your like a brother to me, I love you like a brother. And besides, I kinda like someone else." Harry perked up.
"Don't tell me I've been replaced with this good for nothing death eater scum," Ron said, not realizing the weight of the words as they left his mouth. Hermione gasped quietly, the playful smile faded from Harry's face, and Draco looked at the ground.
"Um...hi, Granger. And no, but I believe he was with Longbottom out in the courtyard last I checked."
"Well at first he showed up at my Aunt and Uncle's house, and got me in loads of trouble with both my relatives and the Ministry. He kept telling me not to go to Hogwarts because I was in danger. When I didn't listen, he blocked the barrier that led to Platform Nine and Three-Quarters, and Ron and I nearly got expelled for taking that bloody car. Then he messed with a bludger in a Quidditch match, the one against you actually, and I broke my arm."
"Harry, have you been crying?" Harry stilled, willing the tears already welling up in his eyes back down.
"I was just informing you that Draco isn't an asshole. Also, are you sure you don't want to be with him?" Pansy questioned, smirking at his expression.
Luckily, it was only about five minutes before Ron found Harry there, covered in a scary amount of blood. He hastily picked up the unconscious boy, and made his way to the hospital wing.
Draco stared at his friends. Finally, he spoke up. "Hello Pansy. Blaise." He nodded his head to each of them. "Glad you found me. Oh, and these three and I have decided to set aside our differences. So if you could refrain from the crude nicknames, that would be most appreciated." Then they gazed at each other some more, before bursting out in laughter. Harry, Ron and Hermione shared a confused look, but ignored it after a while. In all honesty, Draco, Pansy and Blaise weren't sure why they were laughing either. It just felt so good, so they kept on going.
"Harry James Potter, if you think I'm just going to give in and...drop this, as you said, then you're dumber than I thought." Harry rolled his eyes, then yawned again.
"Ron, what are we going to do? He's going to hate us now, me especially." She choked on her words, the heavy tears already falling.
"Ron, I think you've gone insane. Malfoy and Harry hugging, seriously?!" Neville said. Dean and Seamus shared a look.
Draco made his way back to the hospital wing, calming down a little more with every step. So when he got back, looking calm and relaxed, it surprised everyone else. He silently walked back to his seat by Harry's bed, and sat down.
"I know, but mother says I can't change it. She says I'll like it one day, but I don't believe her," the blond whispered loudly, causing his mother to chuckle. The two boys were just adorable, but she was afraid their friendship wouldn't last more than a day, seeing as the Potters and Malfoys never got along too well, and while she had no problem with it, there were always Lily and James.
"Not mad anymore, I see." Harry scowled at her, but didn't stop walking or anything, so Pansy took it as a good sign.
Harry had been somewhat avoiding Draco all day, which was extremely difficult, seeing as all the eighth years had most classes together. Draco noticed, but didn't push it. He figured Harry needed some space for a day or two.
"Her lovebirds, if you don't mind, we kinda have to find Draco, so can you do all that lovey stuff later?"
Harry had almost messed up the potion three times now, Draco just barely stopping him. He never got mad though, even when Harry did mess it up. Draco just sighed, and went to get the ingredients to fix it.
Hermione waited for Harry in the common room, reading a book on one of the couches in the room. After a few minutes, he came down the hallway, and Hermione handed him his potion. He drank it, his nose crinkling at the taste. It tasted like old socks, and he should know, having plenty of gross socks shoved in his face before.
"Yes, I suppose she did. Have you eaten today?" Despite everything that had been going on, Harry had continued eating, and could eat a lot more now. It was still considerably less than what would be considered an average meal, but he was getting better.
Draco woke with a start, almost falling out of his chair. He looked around, and his eyes landed on Harry, screaming and thrashing around in the bed. The blond's eyes widen, and he tried to wake the smaller boy up. Harry gave a blood-curdling scream that made the hairs on the back of Draco's neck stand. Finally, after a few more screams, and a couple kicks to the face, Harry arose, his eyes filled with fear. He hugged his pillow, rocking back and forth on the bed. Silent tears leaked from his eyes, and he mumbled words under his breath.
"What were you doing with Parkinson?" Hermione asked, making Harry smile a bit as he remembered just who Pansy's soulmate was.
"Seriously Blaise, it's so obvious. You fancy that bastard." Blaise could feel his cheeks burning up, from embarrassment of course.
"Well, yes actually. I was just planning on breaking up with him. Do me a favor, would you?" Blaise nodded. "When Ronald comes back, go easy on him tonight."
"Harry calm down, your acting like a real git." Ron didn't approve of the way Harry was talking to Hermione and him. They were just trying to help.
"Not back actually. Dean met my parents...that part made me a bit of a nervous wreck, to be honest."
They sat in silence while Madame Pomfrey preformed countless spells, though not many seemed to be working. Hermione knew what had happened, she'd seen it happen before, at the burrow. Harry had had a PTSD attack, and a bloody awful one too.
"Alright class, today we'll be working in groups of three," Slughorn said as he finished writing the instructions for the potion they would be doing on the board. Harry, Hermione, and Ron shared a look and smiled a bit. They hardly ever got to work in groups of three in this class, it was mostly pairs or by yourself.
"Okay Pretzel, I think that's enough. Why don't you go tell mother we've arrived, and we'll come inside in a second, alright?" Pretzel nodded, and apparated away, leaving the two of them alone.
When he reached her, she shoved the potion down his throat. It was hot and immediately warmed his insides up. He sighed, relishing the feeling. Someone cleared their throat behind him, causing Harry to turn around. It was Malfoy, enveloped in the thick blanket.
Just then two people walked in, looking exasperated. "There you are Draco. Blaise and I have checked every compartment on this entire train looking for you." It was only then, that Pansy noticed the other three people with them. "And I find you here, with Potter, Granger, and the Weasel."
"Told me what? Harry what's going on?" Tears of anger and sadness silently escaped the boys eyes, as he took a shaky breath. This was it, this was the end. It had been a lovely few months, but it was all over now. Draco, Harry's best friend (Ron and Hermione were family, obviously), would leave him after this. After he saw what a mental freak this boy was. This unwanted freak, who's own Aunt and Uncle didn't even love him. He remembered the summers there, filled with chores, cooking meals, few hours of rest, and beatings. So many beatings.
"No it was something more, you never mentioned anything about his parents when we talked. Not even once," she replied, confusion clearly written over her face.
"Me, blackmail? How dare you Potter, I would never," Draco answered dramatically. Harry laughed, and Draco felt his stomach twist.
It was then, that Theodore Nott walked in, wincing at every step he took. Madame Pomfrey reluctantly walked over and tended to him. As everyone else except Harry glared at him, while Harry avoided even looking in his direction.
Avoiding the blond became evidently impossible, because Professor Slughorn partnered the two together for Potions. Harry walked over to the table where Draco was seated. "Malfoy," he said with as much malice in his voice he could muster.
They continued driving for a while. Harry had absolutely no idea where they were going. Although that was normal for Harry. He was quite oblivious. He was so oblivious, that he was oblivious to the fact that he WAS oblivious.
"Master Draco is homes! Master Draco is so kind to Pretzel, always saying thanks you and telling Pretzel she is a good house-elf." Pretzel hugged Draco's leg as he chuckled softly.
"Yes, Hermione, that is what all this is about. It's my favorite one," he pouted, causing Hermione to roll her eyes.
"Huh?" He looked over to the sleeping boy, then at Harry. There were dark circles under his eyes, he looked as if he hadn't slept in weeks, which, he probably hadn't. "Oh, sorry. Harry, when was the last time you slept?"
"Of course I do, I've been using my mother's for months," he gave Harry a bone-crushing hug, though Harry really didn't mind all that much. "Thank you. Merlin, I love you so much," he whispered into Harry's ear.
"Come on Harry, just a few bites?" Harry looked at her, a war inside his head, before he finally nodded and picked it back up again, this time taking a small bite. By the time breakfast was over, Harry had eaten a little less than half the piece, and Hermione was satisfied enough, so she let him leave.
"Why'd we stop here?" Blaise asked, carefully watching the tree that was now thrashing it's branches around freely.
"In my defense, that was unintentional." Harry smiled as the two continued bickering, while Pansy tried to make her daughter human again. Yeah, his life was weird, and a bit messed up. That had been decided for him the night Voldemort killed his parents. But Harry liked his weird, and a bit messed up life.
"Be careful dear. Make sure you eat, and try and get some sleep." She gave his shoulders one last squeeze, before hugging Ron. Harry looked around the platform. He looked around for anyone familiar, trying to see who else was coming back for the year.
"Didn't you guys play chess just the other day?" he said, a smirk playing on his lips. Blaise cursed the other under his breath, and Hermione, Pansy, and Draco all turned to look at him in shock, then at Ron a few tables away.
When Harry woke, it was still dark. His clothes stuck to his skin, and his hair was wet with sweat. His hand was being held, so he looked over to see who it was. Draco? His heart sped up without meaning to. From the attack, he assumed.
Ginny truly did love Harry, she really did. But she knew it couldn't be romantic. Harry didn't make her feel the way Luna did. It had taken Ginny a few months to realize that what she felt for Luna was more than just a friendship. She didn't know if she was lesbian, or bisexual, maybe even pansexual. All she knew, was that it was Luna, and not Harry, that she loved.
"I know, it's just...nevermind. Anyway, how are you, Pansy. I feel awful coming in here and blabbing about all my problems."
Harry looked up from his homework when there was a knock at the door. Draco was supposed to be coming, but he never knocked. He mostly just barged in, since Neville was always gone when he came, and Harry left the door unlocked.
"Well, that was odd." Pansy said, puzzling over his strange reaction. Hermione looked at her, studying her face. But all she saw was perplexity. Funny, she could have sworn Pansy had had something to do with Harry's strange departure.
The whole world was against Harry Potter's happiness, it seemed, everything good always coming to an end. Harry knew he couldn't be with Draco, it would hurt to much when it was over, or Draco died. Because Harry knew it would happen, eventually, and it would hurt a million times worse than it would right now. He could just walk away, forget about him, move to America or something. But he couldn't, he just couldn't do that. As much as he wanted to, disappearing and starting a new life just wasn't an option.
Ginny and Luna had been spending an immense more amount of time together than the years before. There was just something about Luna, something special. Ginny would spent nights thinking about Luna right before she went to bed, only to wake up and have the blonde be the first thing she thought of.
"Harry, just answer the bloody question!" Harry mumbled something under his breath, but it was only loud enough for Draco to here. The blond got up angrily, and walked out, leaving everyone else stunned.
"Well, you can start with taking the spell off." Harry nodded, and closed his eyes. A moment later, he felt lighter, but still terribly tired.
"Well, Harry and Hermione showed me these things muggles watch, called movies. One of the muggles movies has this little baby deer named Bambi. I could show you if you want."
"Let me get the boys, I'm sure they'd be happy to explain everything," Narcissa exclaimed, waving her hand in dismissal. It was only when Narcissa had awakened both boys, and the blond one lifted his head from Harry's shoulder, that she realized it was Draco Malfoy, Narcissa's son. Sighing, Lily waited for James to have the same revelation, and prayed to every god out there that he wouldn't do anything that would hurt Harry.
"You and my picture. I got all the colors wrong, I'll have to start over. Sit right there, I'm going to draw you."
The four walked out of the library, Draco walking behind them so they didn't raise too much suspicion. They were walking back to the common room, when they saw Ron carrying a bloody and unconscious Harry Potter.
Harry spent his nights doing homework, or lying in bed staring at the ceiling. He spent the days going from class to class, unable to pay attention from the lack of sleep. His grades were dropping, he distanced himself from his friends, he skipped every meal.
"Think she already is," Draco muttered into Harry's ear, but Pansy heard, and gave him the nastiest glare Harry had ever seen.
"Well, I hope you like lasagna. Mrs. Weasley is a fantastic cook!" Dora gave a warm smile, and Harry led her inside.
The day was happy and positively perfect for everyone. Well, everyone except Harry. He didn't know why, he just really wanted to be alone. No reason, he just felt like it.
"You're gay?" Ron inquired, glancing at Harry, expecting him to move away, so they at least weren't touching, but he didn't do anything.
Blaise slowly opened his eyes, awaking from the best sleep he'd had in forever. Odd, he thought, since he had fallen asleep on the couch. Suddenly he felt wide awake, and he hastily tried to get up, knocking a certain redhead to the floor in the process. Blaise stared at the lump on the ground with wide eyes, his heart racing more than he'd care to admit.
The door opened and closed, but Ron had hardly noticed. He couldn't get it out of his head. he missed him, he missed him loads. The jokes, the pranks, the smiles. he missed anything and everything about him. But he had left, and he wasn't coming back. Fred was gone.
"Excuse me! Obviously straight! I'll have you know that I am very much gay, thank you very much. I am also deeply offended."
Harry could hardly sit still, he was so jittery and nervous. The second task was in a few hours, and Harry still had no idea what he was going to do. Hermione had left about an hour ago, leaving Ron and Harry to search the many books in the library by themselves. The ginger could barely keep his eyes open, and Harry felt bad for keeping him up so late.
"Well, to tell you the truth, I might fancy her." Harry was happy for the two, really, he was. That being said, he ignored the sinking feeling in his chest, and smiled.
"Dr-Draco? W-what are y-you doing h-here?" he panted, clutching the pillow, his knuckles turning white. Draco opened his mouth to say something, but closed it again. The explanation was much to long, and Harry needed to calm down.
Her next idea, was that they were dating, but that made no sense. Harry was straight, and even if he wasn't, he wouldn't date Malfoy. She laughed at herself for even considering it.
Harry turned around, and walked out of the hall, going to the library before Transfiguration. Meanwhile, Hermione was walking over to Pansy. They had decided to come out to the entire school this morning, but Pansy wouldn't let them make a plan. "It'll be more fun if we wing it," she said. Hermione had just rolled her eyes and grabbed the girl's hand. Now here they were, with no idea of what to do next, and Hermione was mentally smirking. That was, until Pansy stood up on the table, dragging the Gryffindor up with her.
"STOP IT!" Harry's voice cut through Hermione's, putting a stop to whatever she was going to say next. He pulled his legs up, hugging his knees, and resting his head on top of them. "Just stop the arguing, and mind your own business Hermione."
"Well, we deserve it, Ronald," Hermione scolded. "We were out of line to say what we said. Harry's got every right to be angry with us."
"Right. Wait, you know what we could do? Let's go around looking for everyone who's not here right now. There would probably be a few names, and they may not be in eighth year, but its worth a shot."
"Preferable? Who else are you considering?" At this, her face formed something of a scowl, though it was hard to tell.
"Oh my Merlin, did you just apologize? Wait, why are you apologizing for saying my name? It's not like you did anything bad." Why had Draco apologized? God, what was Potter doing to him?
Harry awoke to something painfully poking his side, and he grunted, looking up. Dobby was there, his face inches from Harry's. Harry jumped back and fell off his chair.
Dean and Seamus didn't mind Harry's company, but it gave them less time to work out their plan. Obviously they couldn't work on it with Harry around. Though, sometimes he would just mysteriously disappear, and they had no idea where he would go.
"Hello, Harry. My name's Narcissa, and I'm going to be taking care of you until your mommy and daddy come back. Does that sound alright?" The lady seemed nice enough, and Harry nodded timidly. The nice lady's smile grew.
"Why?" Draco tried to break free, but she had a surprisingly strong grip. Draco needed to find Harry right now, before he did anything rash.
Blaise paced the room, waiting for Weasley. It had been about a half hour since Hermione and Pansy had left, and Ron still wasn't back yet. It was then that the door opened. Blaise turned around, and there was...Theo?
Harry awoke a few hours later, Draco sitting in a chair reading nearby. He sat up, rubbing his eyes and yawning. Draco looked up at the noise, and closed his book when he saw Harry awake.
The train ride was quite uncomfortable for the four. About halfway through, Hermione gave in, wanting to breaking the troublesome silence. She cast a quick muffliato charm around the trio.
"Yes, take a seat." Harry walked over to the spare chair and sat, feeling awkward sitting there like he had so many times before. "How are you?"
"Everyone, I have an announcement to make," Harry said, standing up. "I'm going to be the new DADA professor starting next year."
"Yep," Harry replied, standing up. He walked over to the two lovers, and they apparated to Platform 9 3/4.
"A DOCTOR! SERIOUSLY HERMIONE! I'M FINE!!!" He was, in fact, not fine. He was so angry, he just wanted to punch something. Harry screamed in frustration. He'd never even been to the doctor before. The Dursley's never took him in for check-ups or whatever they did here.
Draco rolled his eyes as Pansy left before turning to Blaise and raising his eyebrows. Blaise really didn't want a part of Draco's creepy obsession with Potter, so he followed behind the girl with a quick wave goodbye.
"You know what, screw this," the raven-haired boy said, grabbing Malfoy's shirt and pulling him into a kiss. He let go after a few seconds, and turned around, walking over to Hermione as though nothing had happened, leaving Malfoy stumbling backward slightly with wide eyes.
Draco grinned at Harry's expression, and nudged his shoulder with his own. Harry turned to him, seeming to come out of his daze. "Want a tour?" Harry nodded, and Draco grabbed the boy's hand, leading him up the stone pathway to the doors.
"Potions." Harry made a face, making Draco laugh, and hard. Harry could have sworn it was the most angelic thing he'd ever heard in his life.
He can hear the door open, feet shuffling, and muffled voices, but he doesn't bother to go see who it is. It's really none of his business who Andromeda's talking to. Well, he didn't think it was, until there was a knock on his door.
Harry also decided that he should be more concerned with everyone else. They were all worried about him, but he could see no reason why. He was fine. they needed help. They needed Harry to be the comforting friend they were used to. So he put on his old, happy, face, and he went down to breakfast.
Mr. Wormtail wishes Harry to know that he is sorry for the pain he caused him. 'Great,' Harry thought, 'now I can add another death to my guilty conscience.'
Draco hesitated, then looked back at Harry. Harry, looking defeated, sighed and nodded his head. He opened the door wider, letting them all in, and Merlin, there were a lot of them. Hermione was also with them, but the three boys had not come with them. Taking this as a family matter, Draco debated leaving them alone. It wasn't as if the Weasley's enjoyed his presence anyway. He could only begin to imagine the things Ron and Ginny had said about him.
"Draco Lucius Malfoy, you get back in here right now, or so help me, I will hex your bollocks off!" Draco walked back in, quite honestly scared. He'd seen the girl in action before, and she'd been a fourth year then. He shivered, not even wanting to think of what she could do now. Closing the door behind him, he shuffled to the corner of the room. When he looked up again, practically everyone's eyes were on him, except for Harry, who had taken to dropping his head onto his knees once again. He shifted uncomfortably under everyone's gaze, wishing he could disappear. It wasn't a bad idea, and Harry's cloak was right next to his feet. So he grabbed it, and threw it over himself, not caring how stupid he must have looked.
Dean and Seamus were ecstatic all throughout the next morning, but no one seemed to know why. Truth is, they were up late last night, working on Operation Drarry, which is what they decided to call their plan to get Malfoy and Harry together. The plan had been going slow before, and they still hadn't really known what they were going to do. But then they saw the blond with Harry and Hermione yesterday, changing everything.
"Dean, your a genius! Alright, common room first." Dean grabbed a piece of parchment, and the two left for the common room. They wrote down everyone who was there. Pansy Parkinson, Blaise Zabini, and Theodore Nott were studying at one of the tables. Two Hufflepuff eighth years were on the couch, and a Ravenclaw was walking to their dorm room.
"Yes, sir. It's going fairly well, though I do need the occasional help in Herbology, and sometimes Potions, though Harry and Draco are always helpful there. Your son is actually quite good at Potions, did you know?" Ginny asked, trying to cover her small slip-up.
The four made their way to the Hospital Wing, where all the Weasley's except for Charlie were there, along with Luna. Hermione hated this, she hated being the one to tell them. Fred had died a few months ago, and now they were losing Ron. It just didn't seem fair.
"Need something, Malfoy?" Harry asked. Draco couldn't seem to find his voice. He was far too nervous, that wouldn't do. He cleared his throat, and stood just a bit straighter than before.
"Well, off to the hospital then." Harry let go of Draco's shirt, which he had previously grabbed fistful's of. He hadn't even realized it, to be honest.
"What? I never said I liked them!" Harry rolled his eyes, which were red and bloodshot from the lack of sleep. "Harry, I really think you should get some sleep."
They were doing their homework in Dean and Seamus's room one evening, when all the sudden, Harry shouted, "Merlin's beard! I'm so late!" He then proceeded to run out of the room, not even bothering to take his homework with him. On his way out, the two heard him mutter, "They're gonna kill me."
"Birthday? What are you talking about? Its not my..." It was definitely his birthday. Harry had forgotten his own birthday. "Ok, it's my birthday. What are you and Luna doing here?"
Ron gave a small, yet sad, smile. "Tell that that to Harry. You know him, the guilt is probably killing him. When will he realize that none of this is him fault?" He buried his face in Hermione's shoulder. "I'm worried about him 'Mione."
Draco, on the other hand, was going quite insane spending all this time with Potter. It was all he could do not to kiss him, or hug him, or hold his hand. He had to keep reminding himself over and over again that Ha-Potter was straight. Still, the friendship was intoxicating, filling the blond's mind with unrealistic hope.
"That we are. How are you and Ginny doing?" Dean responded, grinning at Seamus before turning back to Harry.
Harry and Neville made it to their dorm, before they burst out laughing. They laughed until they got stomach cramps and they had tears in their eyes. When they had finally stopped, Harry and Neville checked out the room.
"This might be harder than we thought, D." Seamus said as the walked into the common room after Harry and the Slytherin's little dispute.
"Harry dear, it's great to have you. Happy Christmas," Narcissa says, a big smile on her face. "Come in, you two must be freezing. Your hands are shaking." Harry looked down at his hands. They were, in fact, shaking, just not from the cold as Narcissa had assumed. He scowled at them, willing them to stop. They didn't. This was it, the feeling of being broken and helpless, and Harry was feeling it again. Happiness can never last forever.
"Just where do you think you're going, Mister Malfoy!" Mrs. Weasley said, pulling away from Harry and putting her hands on her hips.
"Well, get on with it then. I haven't the time for this." The Slytherin snorted and tapped her fingertips against the side of her robes. She was nervous, Harry realized.
"Harry, you need to stop thinking about everyone else for once in your life, and just think about what
"Do you think, we could take a break, to figure ourselves out. Not breaking up officially, just a break."
"Whatdoyouwant?" he said quickly, his words becoming one. Blaise had no idea what he'd just said. He gave the ginger a puzzled looks, tilting his head slightly.
"I was abused," he whispered, sighing when the headache stopped, lingering for just a few seconds. He shut his eyes in content, causing the salty tears to fall from his eyes. And then he could feel the potion wearing off, and he cursed himself, knowing he could have just held out a little longer.
No one seemed to notice Harry's mood. He was getting exceptionally good at hiding how he was feeling. The only time he couldn't hide it was after one of those horrid nightmares. He shuddered just thinking about them.
"Oh. Wait, what do you mean betrayed you? Are you still on about our fight? Harry, that was a week ago, can you just let it go?" Harry and Draco both glared at Ron.
"You were serious about that? Harry, you can't change your soulmate, it's impossible. You don't have to date them or anything, nothing is saying you have to end up with your soulmate. But, if you don't, just make sure you aren't ruining their life in the process. And, unless they already know, you should tell them. They at least deserve that." Harry exhaled, and leaning against the wall while Pansy gave Harry's shoulder a comforting squeeze.
He scooted closer, so that their arms and legs were touching. The breathing stopped, and Draco could feel Harry tense up even more, before relaxing slowly and breathing again, this time much more evenly.
"I'll throw in a good word with Ron, yeah?" Apparently, it was that simple, and he was in within a matter of seconds. Merlin, that boy must have it
"Something actually came up, and we'll have to meet up later." At this Draco faced the bushy-haired girl.
"Seeing as you want me to pretend to be your boyfriend for the next few weeks, I kinda think it is." Draco opened his mouth to retort, then closed it. He sighed, then began explaining.
When Harry first saw Draco walk into the library, his eyes immediately went to Draco's chest, where the scars were. Draco noticed, so he just blurted out, "Will you stop staring at the scars?" It sounded a bit angry, but needed to be said regardless. In a nicer voice, he said, "I've already forgiven you, and it's time you do the same."
"And how did Harry feel about you being together?" Hermione looked confused at their random questions, before a look of shock replaced it.
"Hey beautiful," Pansy smirked, loving the blush that found it's way to her girlfriends cheeks. "Ready to go?"
"Hermione, don't be ridiculous. First off, I was completely fine with Ginny liking Luna. She's like a sister to me, and I hardly ever saw her, of course she was going to find someone else. Second, Ginny and I were technically on a 'break' so we weren't actually dating. Third, I didn't and don't like anyone. Why would you even think that? And fourth, why are you being so...weird?"
"Yeah, ok," Harry replied. Malfoy nodded and moved to the seat farthest from the three, bringing his knees to his chest and wrapping his arms around them. He stared out the window, deep in thought.
Halloween was just around the corner, and everyone was getting excited. Well, almost everyone. There was one boy in particular who dreaded the day. As a child, he'd always loved Halloween, but that was before the weight of the day fully crushed him. For it was on this day, that his parents had been murdered, leaving Harry James Potter an orphan forevermore.
“Pansy,” while there were indignant gasps emitting from the nothingness that held Granger and Weasley, Cassius had poked Pansy, “no slurs, remember?”
“Why did you do that?” Wolfe screeched, trying unsuccessfully to salvage the garment from the flames. “The nice jumper! Seeker, you idiot!”
Indeed, the opening behind the portal unveiled pitch-black murk of the liquid kind, waves gently rippling over the vertical surface behind an invisible barrier.
“Thank you,” the Ronald-Weasel said sincerely, taking the wind out of Draco's sails. The redhead gazed tenderly at his wife. “Love can make you do crazy thing, but in the end, love always wins, doesn't it?” Draco's brows furrowed. Something about this sentence... But he had no time to pursue the thought, as the ginger continued: “Speaking of The Burrow – you're still coming for lunch tomorrow, yeah?”
The raven-haired rider frowned and pulled on the reins, making his ghost horse prance in a half circle. It seemed as if he considered coming down and Draco wished desperately he would. Yet a moment later, the huntsman went on, urged on by the gang of Draco's deceased peers.
This was his secret though and he would not share it with anyone, least alone the cause of his emotional dilemma.
Snowdrop landed back on his shoulder, nibbling lovingly at his left ear, while his unnamed new companion huffed warm air into his right one.
It took a full bag of George's Unicorn Powder to spring Harry from the clutches of well-disposed witches and wizards and get him down a hallway, into a quiet corner.
Draco rubbed his neck. It was late afternoon and he was standing in a brightly lit hallway of St. Mungo's, waiting for the lift. Three doors down, he could hear his Slytherin friends' voices singing off-tune:
His back hurt and he was stiff all over.  When he rubbed the sleep off his face with ink stained fingers, he could feel the indents left by miscellaneous writing utensils which lay spread across the blank pages of a notebook. Bloody hell, he must have fallen asleep at the desk last night.
So, right after breakfast on Boxing Day, he bade his parents goodbye and returned to Grimmauld Place.
“No.” Harry shook his head vehemently. “This is what I want. I always want to be with you. Berchthold said I could, the night he came for you. If we go together we can be reborn together. Isn't that right, Holle?”
BraveHeart's eyes were sparkling at the thought, but Seeker snorted. “Yeahhhhh, sure. And trees grow upside-down. Look here, B, with all due respect to your enthusiasm: This story sounds totally fishy. If Holle's Pond is really the door to the netherworld and she is as mighty as she appears to be, then she would never have allowed people to steal a piece of it.”
Draco jumped up so quickly, he knocked the scrapbook (along with Howard) off Potter's lap and smashed his own tea cup on the floor. “Holy shit! The baby! I fucking forgot about the bloody baby!”
There, in the crown-topped seat across from Malfoy (which had been empty until a second ago, Harry could have sworn) sat a boy that eerily looked like Harry.
This seemed to amuse the boy who lived to drive Draco crazy. “So? You are wearing mine. That way it's fair, don't you think?” He wiggled his eyebrows at Draco who gaped first at him and then down his own front where, to his horror, he saw a gold and red Gryffindor crest. Draco must have grabbed the wrong shirt by mistake earlier.
Ouch. Right, so what Draco with his quick wits had instantly picked up on was the fact that if Death and Life had their fingers in the pie, Draco's ability to remember Harry was maybe merely because Holle had decided to not blind Draco with her breath. Plain and simple. It  could also mean that there was no strongest (love) connection at all. Not that it mattered, Harry was sure about his feelings, deeper magical meaning or not. But what if Draco wasn't...?
Beauxbatons was right. And the Weasley girl was right. Draco had done so many terrible things to this family. What reason should they have to listen to any story he told them?
“No, thanks. I was in the papers enough for a lifetime. With the trial and all...” Malfoy shifted uncomfortably and pulled his knees up, resting his arms on top of them.
,” a detached hand gestured at nothing, “is necessary. If you insist though, fine. Just – are you not coming in here?”
The Weasel had told Draco that those two so different siblings had surprisingly become very tight during the last year. Maybe the missing brother between them made them stick closer together.
“Merlin, your pride’s gonna kill you one day. You could’ve asked for help sooner, you know?” Harry chided, but then relented, asking tentatively: “Are you alright?”
Panicking wasn't helping though. He had to be pragmatic about this. So what if Potter had picked up on Draco's
? Can't you bloody give the whole story for once!” Harry hadn't meant to yell, but he was sick of it. Always just bread crumbs, never the complete loaf. He was angry to find, once again he'd been manipulated by greater forces. Now he wanted answers and he would get them, goddammit.
He never got his happy ending, but he left us when the snow fell and I hope that he went with The Hunt.
“You treated him like shit. He was constantly hurt!” Harry felt his anger rising like bile. “How about I shut
“Brr, terrible that lake. Oh, hello, Harry! Long time no see.” Moaning Myrtle, squat and bespectacled as always, pretended to shake off water like a dog. “Good thing you gave some light signals or I would have stayed in there for the whole night. Got flushed, you see. Oh, Draco, hi!”
“That's the single-most stupid thing I've heard all day; and I've just spent some time with Potter.”
That wasn't planned at all, it just happened. Mostly because The Wild Hunt is a lore with many facets and versions.
So, that's what they had meant. He literally was unable to leave The Hunt behind, he couldn't even get out of the area.
Draco was startled by the sudden change in conversation and eyed Weasley warily. There had been an underlying tone of seriousness in the other boy's voice that made Draco believe that this was a genuine offer.
“How can dead children be a good thing?” Uh oh, Seeker's voice had grown loud. He should work on his temper.
Without reducing the speed, they bolted out on the other side. Which was why it was too late to dodge for the person suddenly standing in the middle of the road outside the house.
was supposed to mean. He hadn't got around to ask yet, with all that had been going on. Now was not the time however since Malfoy, wand drawn in precaution, had in that moment put a hand on the handle of the perfectly round, red door.
Ron emerged from the Invisibility Cloak and took the other side of the corridor. “Not that I care much what happened to
It was over before it really began. Harry was back with the others and they were getting ready to leave.
There were pictures of all the big and little things they'd seen on their travels. Draco revelled for a moment in the memories of sunscreen and sea water, crowds and postcards, vineyards and pizza places, Rome and Paris, Harry and Draco.
There were thousands of tiny little rhinestones set in the walls and they shed a diffuse sort of dim glow that lit up the round, well-like hole they were
But nothing would console Draco today. He had found The Hunt. He had found Potter – and he had missed holding onto him!
Draco had seen Potter around the castle, patching. But aside from a few tense nods here and there they hadn't had much contact. They were civil – but civil didn't mean friendly.
“Yeah. What did you think? That we fly up to the roof on carrots? Come on, Malfoy!” Potter had turned heel and was already bouncing towards the doors.
Maybe Draco was a bit peeved about Potter's reaction to the former's partaking in the latter's best friends' nuptials. Maybe that's why the meaner, older part of him resurfaced. “Oh and guess what else? Beauxbatons – Fleur – and Bill are expecting, so in summer they will have a... ba... by...”
“Argh! What the–” His hands disbelievingly touched the magic wall. Oh no. This was a gate point to the area, here ran the border, which meant...
: How could you have arrived at The Hunt only a few months before me if The Hunt only rides during Yuletide? Or did you insinuate, you joined the winter before I came?” That would have been a weird way to phrase it then though. After all, a year was a year and not a few months.
Two posh-looking envelopes came flying in through the door, landing safely in Draco's outstretched hand. He gave each of them the one with their respective names on it.
“You know, that is a good thought,” Malfoy allowed and stomped on Harry's foot under the table when the latter opened his mouth to protest. “How about you release the Sticking Spell and we'll send Potty here packing, what do you think?”
Mabel looked at him as if he was quite gormless. “Personal hygiene is no matter of living circumstances, Malfoy.”
Finally Ada seemed to pity them (or maybe they just were too slow for her) and allowed Draco onto the back of her own horse, so he could hold on to her (something he decidedly did
The flight instructor scanned the task board for a one-man-job as Draco approached, and tilted her head. “No luck, we don't have any single-missions at the moment. How about a nice team play for once, hm?” she smiled like a hawk. Damn her.
Soon the whole hunting party had gathered in a loose circle around a big pile of hay, stacked up under a crude wooden cross jutting crookedly out of the ground. Harry noticed that the set-up was on an unreaped stripe of the field that still displayed traces of left-over crop under the thin layer of fresh snow.
“Yeah.” Potter's brows furrowed. “But if this was here, how could you not have known this was my bedroom? With all my things lying about.
The addressee, a second ago very busy with distracting himself from a question-cascading BraveHeart, went rigid.
“They have a cooler flag,” Ember had grinned, when the gang had asked him and Seeker had once again been hit by the feeling of deep unease regarding the big, broad-shouldered boy.
Picking up the Marauder's Map, Harry watched his little ink self as the tiniest speech bubble appeared next to his figure. The words inside said
“Oh, yeah, I love them. I have my own at home, Fury. She's old, but such a cutie.” Seriously, someone should teach that blabbermouth Cassius that just because people could not spill your secrets that didn't mean you ought to offer them up for free.
He swallowed. He hated to be here. Yet it somehow comforted him to visit the site. When he walked between the crosses, it was as if he could hear the echoes of their memories.
Seeker's eyes went big as saucers when Draco started doing magic (what else could it be?), burning little doodles in the sand – a lightning bolt, round glasses, a heart...
emotions changed, too: from guilty outsider to accepted part of the group. Taking you was punishment and reward – for both of you.” He winked. “Oh and yes. We know all that about you, Draco, because we kept an eye on you. Let's just say
There was a moment of pause when everyone thought about that, then Pansy slowly nodded at the same time as Weasley did.
Nope. Not even the prospect of Malfoy's glee, docking who-knew-how-may points from Gryffindor for catching Harry after hours, would make him go down this death trap. Nuh-uh.
Parkinson flinched back involuntarily and that was all the proof Hermione needed. The Slytherin prefect knew about the bloody business of writing toady lines.
“There's nothing more, is there?” Weasley turned his book on its head and back. “Nothing in the footnotes or end-of-book-references?”
There was a faint grunt and Harry wondered how many more new people he would have to meet today until he could finally get some rest. But still, his curiosity got the best of him and he peeped over his marshmallow-on-stick that Wolfe had just handed him, at the mysterious 'Amber girl' that must have been sleeping behind the horses.
has taken more than just my daughter. As if there is another piece – another person? – missing. There are things that make no sense, as though parts of my memory were incomplete...”
Granger took the hint. She straightened. “Good, so, new plan. Malfoy and I will go to Grimmauld Place and Ron, do you think you'll be alright going into the Manor alone?”
. If we ever capture her, the world will start anew. A new beginning. The eternal circle,” Half's words carried effortlessly over the storm.
“She was really nice, sat me down and said that she felt like my heart wasn't in it anymore. Hic. She, she said that it was better to be just fr-friends.” The words were muffled as Potter's face was still pushed into Draco's chest.
Hermione's guess that the temporary, alternating (or shared?) ownership of Draco's wand made up that the strong link needed, was the best they had come up with. But maybe it was time to ask an expert on the matter of wands.
“Your sister has gone up to the surface. She and her friends are riding alongside The Hunt on the waves, as you could have guessed yourself.” An elderly merwoman had spoken with the authority of a leader. Somehow, she looked like Mabel, but wilder and more ferocious. The tips of her dark green hair whiter than snow and her eyes somewhat glowing.
Hermione rolled her eyes fondly, when her fingertips brushed against a door frame. “I think I have something.” She popped her head out from under the Cloak. “Behind this Gobelin.”
She stopped in front of Berchthold – a small figure before the giant on his mammoth horse. She seemed forlorn, so alone in the circle of silent watchers. Harry felt the urge to help her, but he held his tongue. Somehow this was not the time for him (or anyone) to interfere. This was Berchthold's time.
Snorting, Malfoy turned to face ahead again. “If you call saving me from breaking my neck 'for nothing', then sure.” He paused. “I guess, you'd rather have me dead anyway.” The seriousness of his voice and sudden dark turn startled Harry. “You know what? Don't answer that.”
“Impressive.” Granger didn't sound condescending. She really meant it. That was... nice. Acknowledging someone else's talent so easily, maybe the know-it-all wasn't as big of a snob as Pansy had always thought her to be.
Harry blinked. Weirdly, the word 'partner' in connection with him and Malfoy made his stomach flutter. If he was brutally honest with himself, he'd been feeling increasingly often fluttery around the blond wanker as of late. Good thing Harry was a master of pretending. Therefore, he pushed that strange notion away and averted his gaze.
Harry rolled his eyes. His appetite for jokes had dried up. He wanted answers. “Okay, now, why don't you start at the beginning? What is The Hunt? Witness to what? Why do you think you're all dead?” Harry sat demonstratively back down on the ground and after a second the others followed suit.
Harry looked at Half with a smirk, ready to tell him 'I told you so', but the words dried on his lips when he saw the odd expression that had frozen the redhead's face in place. It was a complicated feeling somewhere between painful sweetness and agony of the worst kind.
But Draco instead ran a hand through his hair, his short sleeves revealing a tattoo on his left forearm. It was a skull with a serpent protruding from its mouth like a tongue.
“I'll take that as a yes, so you better not complain later. And when we'll get found you'll say we got stuck here
He hadn't forgotten about the advice. It just had turned out pretty much impossible to heed, as Seeker had to find out that the sky was barely to be seen between the thick branches of the forest trees and normally a cloud was covering the whole of the encampment's clearing at Holle's Pond.
“It's not all white though. This knot's red. What does that mean?” Wolfe had the scandalising knot between her delicate fingers and looked at Half questioningly.
She and Ron had only come back from Australia a week ago and boy, had Harry missed them both. Letters could just not substitute for a live meeting. He was beyond glad they were back.
Stepping back into their circle, Ember frowned at the incredulous faces. “What? Did you think I'd hide her or something? She gets to live, that's a good thing. Why would I not want that for her, something good?”
Meanwhile, Malfoy had reached the bottom of the heap and jumped down the last bit. Only to immediately fall down to his knees with a surprised “Ohmpf”.
Harry chuckled. “Oh, of course we are, silly. All cemeteries are crossroads of life and death. And look,” he pointed at the location, “they're already here to pick me up. It's time for me to go.”
He looked at the other two. Not that he needed their permission, but if they made a fuss he might not be able to live here after all.
Their eyes locked, taking them both back to the agonising moments of eternity when Potter had indeed been dead for Draco. To the snippet of infinity when, after all hell had broken loose with Potter's 'resurrection', they had passed each other in the crowd. Just a split-second they had held each other's gaze. Blazing green eyes on tear filled grey ones and Draco had known that Potter had understood that Draco had been crying for Harry. Because that one time, in all of Draco's life, Potter had been Harry to him, in the seconds when Draco's last remaining piece of happy childhood had shattered to smithereens with Harry's death.
Mabel's face brightened. “Lobster quadrille!” Without asking, she pulled Draco by the hand towards where the crowd was now conglomerating.
She frowned. “I wonder where I heard about a case like this? I really don't remember... Maybe from Purple? Anyway, the other, even rarer case, is–” she suddenly paused to give Draco a scrutinising once-over and he felt very much on trial; for what now, he wouldn't know.
Contrasting against the black cat, Draco noticed a stained handkerchief wrapped around Potter's wrist. He started. Wasn't that a tiny D in the corner? It couldn't perchance be the one he'd given Potter the summer before last? No, impossible. What a thought. “I also have an owl, upstairs. This is Howard.”
Potter rolled his eyes. The audacity. “Oh, come off it, Malfoy. I just wanted to talk to you in private, is all. Besides,” here, he grinned bitterly, “what's there to touch anyway? You're only skin and bones.”
Despite it being months now, he had not given up yet. Yes, it was bothersome and yes, it went slowly, not much novel knowledge dribbling in from the few sources he could find. The important thing however was that there still
The other Harry's words didn't have quite the desired effect though as Malfoy physically recoiled at the action. He glanced at Harry and then back at the imitation. “Don't get ideas, Potter,” he barked, defensively, at Harry's scowling. “That's not my doing. I mean, look at him, he's a right queen.”
The first thing Draco noticed when he entered the kitchen was the delicious smell of festive roast. It hit him with an unexpected wave of nostalgia, memories of childhood Christmases bubbling up to the surface of his mind. He quickly blinked them away. Now was not the time to reminisce. Even though his stomach growled a bit and reminded him that he hadn't had a proper meal all day, that could wait, too.
Draco ran a hand through his hair. “I'll just have to make him then, right? After all, I'm not chasing storms all around the globe to come up empty-handed. I'll drag him back with me even if he's kicking and screaming. Yeah.”
The girl cocked her head and contemplated that for a moment. “I believe there is or more like, I know there is. See, when Voldemort” (Draco shuddered.) “tried to make himself immortal, he divided his soul to create so-called Horcruxes. That is indeed what we and Pickle did when we were on the run – search and destroy said soul pieces to make V–
The fact that several (vaguely familiar?) ghost riders followed shortly in Potter's wake, scooting around Draco in most adventurous ways in order not to hit him, he only noticed hazily. Because of his own shock, the riders’ speed and the sudden onset of dense snow, Draco couldn’t make out any faces anyway.
Somewhen Things... Harry had the strange feeling he should probably tell the others that not only the wreath was glowing for him but also the pond. But there was something else that had caught his interest. “Hold on. Does that mean – do you guys also not remember your life before you came here?”
Suddenly, Harry found himself buried in arms and bodies, faces pressing into his cheeks and hair, all accompanied by the ever-present Hunt scent of horses.
They had reached the school now and saw that a bunch of little merpeople were currently underway of rounding the stone circle, some slow, some at break-neck speed, but everyone was joking and guffawing all the while.
It was all too much. The close succession of so many powerful feelings had Draco choking. “I don't understand. How can you even like me?”
then?” Harry flinched ever so slightly. Indeed had he just thought that... just for a second... that...
Draco swirled around just in time to see a towel clad, still dripping Potter carefully close the door behind himself. With him came a cloud of the scent of Draco's best shampoo into the room.
“Mhm,” Queen Harry licked his lips, “I'd please you real good, if you let me. But, after the game – and as for your request: No can do, sweetheart, not even for you. Rules are rules. You taught me so. Now, time to part with
Harry bit his lip. This was his chance to get out all the questions he never asked before. “But, since we're at it: I've been wondering about how the cloak came into the possession of my family. Are we really related to the original three brothers from the story? Do you know?”
The Gryffindor tried to wiggle his feet, to no avail. He leant forward and pulled at his legs – or at least he attempted to as Malfoy's behind was sort of in the way. “Oi, dumbass, could you move your dumb ass a bit, so I can free my feet?” Harry had the wild (and fleeting) thought of giving that git a nice spank, but he didn't. That would be too weird, wouldn't it?
The two Gryffindors gave her hard-to-decipher looks and Pansy decided she didn't need to know so badly after all. “Never mind. So,
Malfoy seemed to think similarly, since he’d taken a deep breath and then let it out slowly, without responding.
Potter nudged a bit closer, ruffling the sheets. “You were so brave in facing a dangerous supernatural phenomenon, but now you can't even look at me when you lie about your feelings.”
. Any depiction of mental illness is certainly not meant to be disrespectful or tactless. If it comes across as such, I very much apologise. Please no one take offense.
“Because, my good boy, Seeker here sees what we all see: You are attached to the kiddo and she (and her dog) to you. So you should dub her.” Half wiggled his eyebrows. “Coal, maybe? Blaze?”
Harry startled when Malfoy sat down next to him and gently pried one of Harry's hands from his face, without saying a word.
“It's rather cold out tonight, isn't it? Would you like to come in?” Mrs. Weasley's tone had reverted back to its usual warmth. She sounded like the mother Draco had caught sight of at Platform 9¾ occasionally and he was now quite surprised to be the recipient of that friendly voice.
He made a move to swim up and Mabel's spear was once again pointed at him. “No. It's not safe. I won't let you.”
Draco eyed her with a mix of pride and remorse. Greengrass had never really been part of their inner circle and yet she was here. Because that was their Slytherin motto, wasn't it? 'Real Friends', like the Sorting Hat had sung back in their first year.
“Well, hullo there.” Seeker's head snapped up. Standing right in front of him was the dragon boy, sunlight gleaming on his blond hair like a halo. He smiled. “Are you lost?”
“They were right here on the map and then they weren't and now I can't find them anywhere on it. Can you?”
A great horned owl sailed gracefully down towards them and perched herself on Cassius' broad shoulder. Pansy patted her gently.
For a moment, they all looked at the baked gem then Granger cleared her throat. “I was thinking this before but could it be Ron and I remember Phyton in a non-memorial way? As in not with memories but with, I don't know, gut feeling? Maybe the crone's blinding breath really does blind, but in a more metaphorical sense? Like making people unable to
“Yes, he is. But that doesn't change the fact that Malfoy is, too. We will get into trouble, but so will he.” She leant a bit closer towards her adversary and lowered her voice. “Do you know what happens in detention under Umbridge's watch?”
Whichever it was, Harry was relieved that they had worked it out before awkwardness and old habits could muck this up.
“Will you stop shouting? And that just happened because you,” here Malfoy hesitated, obviously unwilling to admit that Harry had tricked his father, “corrupted Dobby. You basically nicked him.”
The male snake sounded very annoyed already and they hadn't even started trying to get anyone to notice them yet.
Harry bit his lip, grinning. Although the claim of having thought about kissing Draco 'every day' had been an exaggeration, Harry
wand. Or it used to be mine before Potter took it from me at the Manor (where he was with you as well). He seemingly utilised it from then on. I guess it was
The tiny boy smiled gently, while putting the finishing touches on a flame-covered mask that was certainly meant for Ember. “I simply like to capture what I see on a medium that I can carry around with me. Does that sound weird?”
Malfoy surprised him by continuing: “And as for Dobby. I won't apologise or some such nonsense, surely. Because he, well, he got treated like his kind is treated and he likes serving and I won't let you try and talk me into feeling bad about living a normal life, with culture,” he ranted and Harry got the distinct impression that perchance Malfoy after all felt bad just the tiniest bit. “In any case, what I will acknowledge – and that's all I'll ever say on that matter – Dobby is a good elf.”
What kind of flames were those, Harry wondered, flames of eternal servitude or even... flames of hell?
The girl giggled. “You mean you can't take LESS. It's very easy to take MORE than nothing. But, why don't you have some wine?”
That day, Draco had made a mental note to research some more about exceptions of human magic (for example Hunt magic) on magical beings and animals.
“Well, this looks promising!” Granger's eyes were sparkling with excitement. “How about you take the left side and I take the right?”
, for a lack of a better label. She left her alive body and now travels with The Hunt as mere soul. So, there you have it. Plymouth is a mind ghost type, a Hunt ghost and the infant is a soul ghost type, a soul ghost. Of course the Hunt's magic concerning them would be completely different.”
“Well, rumour has it that some Sunday Children, that is magic doers, once stole a piece of Holle's Pond and spelled it into a stone archway.” With the backside of his brush, the artist drew an ancient looking archway with a ragged veil into the soil. “But they couldn't control its power and everyone walking through the archway never came back, so they hid it in a secret place.”
Somehow, deep inside his heart, deeper than any enchantment could reach, he had known that there was someone special out there. He had recognised Draco's handkerchief as important, even before he had remembered. Also, quite tell-tale, The Beginning, which supposedly showed you what you most desire, had looked like a dragon to Harry. If
“So, did Padraig really beat Voldemort,” (Draco shuddered, but it didn't reach his heart – for once he was almost happy.) “with that wand?” panted freckle-face.
“Oh, the giant squid lives in here. It's mostly harmless, but at times, it gets hangry and starts eating anything within reach. That's why you won't see many fish in the cave, at best some nebby porpoises. Ah and crocodiles, they don't fear anything, haha. But don't worry. I'll protect you.” She winked and Draco recoiled. Ugh.
“We didn't,” Ron promised earnestly, yet couldn't help himself but to add: “As sure as ferrets are ferrets.”
In the meantime, DAIS had: travelled down into the dungeons, squeezed into the dingy lumber room that held the Mell's entrance, looked at the well-opening from all sides and tried various spells without avail.
called Carl?). Even though the redhead was just as bad as Draco (he'd seen the ginger talk to the my-crow-wife), Granger fondly rolled her eyes at both of them an equal amount of times.
Right, that was it. That was what they had talked about all those months ago. That was why the phrasing had felt familiar.
“Yep, we'll be enjoying the bachelor life together, with the mothers gone.” Zabini slung an arm around a blushing Nott. “Hey, maybe
He told Tonks and Lupin, side by side in the third line, about little Teddy's achievement of holding his head upright on his own and how Andromeda and him had had tea the other day.
Maybe that was better, after all the weird thoughts Harry’s brain kept providing in view of… well, the
He attempted to steer Lightning out of the clouds, when a firm hand closed around his wrist, effectively stopping him.
“Sunburn. And rain,” muttered Ember, but no one paid him attention, aside from Scoffer who was always on his heels.
“I'm Draco Malfoy, part of the Inquisitorial Squad and empowered to deal out all kinds of punishments, so you better show yourself now before I tell the headmistress about you!” Malfoy's threat was partly minimised by the slight shaking of his hand.
“Sounds good?” Potter looked a bit bewildered, but went anyway in the suggested direction, followed by Hermione who up until then had been busy sending a Patronus message to The Burrow.
Now was the time to be supportive though. “I mean, you could probably win her back by showing her your heart is indeed in it and all. If that's what you want.” Draco paused, considering. Why did these words feel like acid on his tongue? “What
“Because I heard them,” Mr. Withane frowned, “...because... the window was open somehow. I remember calling, that it was The Hunt, though I guess in all the commotion, I have forgotten who I was talking to at that moment. Anyway, I heard them say:
In some of these photographs, Teddy was seen – either in Draco's, Harry's or Aunt Andromeda's arms – giggling gleefully at some birds or flowers on the way.
Seeker nodded and climbed up Lightning's back, holding on for dear life and feeling ill – and what's more, like he had forgotten to do something important. But The Hunt was moving on and his horse knew the way and why worry? He laid his head onto Lightning's neck and tried for a bit more sleep, another knot on his bracelet turning red.
“Look at that: Gold Harry and Pitch Crabbe,” Draco whispered the words so quietly into Harry's ear that no one else could hear. Harry snorted and shoved at him.
Draco suddenly became acutely aware that the look she was giving him was one of wariness. As if, any moment now, he could turn his nose on the library idea just because it was Muggle. He took a deep breath. Maybe she wasn't so far off. If it had been a few months back, he might have. But now, things were different. And a wizarding library sounded like a bloody brilliant idea. Too bad it didn't exist.
“Oh, take him to bed before he dissolves into tears, will you?” Half playfully nudged Draco. “See you again?”
go back to his life, but exploring The Hunt's freedom for a while first wouldn't hurt. Just until he was back in Britain.
That's why Potter had been acting so weirdly... Because he had known that Draco... This was beyond humiliating.
Yes, I'm aware, but frankly, I don't care. I'm a stickler for canon, if possible, but in this one instance I'm not. Why? For me the Harry Potter story is timeless, I don't see that is has to be placed in 199?. It can be anytime. So I made it now-ish, in that moment.
With a plop, a house-elf wearing a tower of knitted hats appeared on the table between them. Pansy had the vague idea that she'd seen him before. Somewhere.
This time, the door was embedded into the inner wall. Just as round as the other one before, though black.
Bloody Draco's luck that Mr. Look-At-Me-I'm-So-Perfect had to come here and take his bad mood out on an innocent tree planter.
“Hullo, Weasley,” Draco said evenly, refraining from using the spiteful nickname, “may I have a word with you?” If anyone remembered Potter, it would be his best friend, surely.
“You don't say,” bit Malfoy and stormed around the table to test the portals on the other side, while Harry stayed in winter.
Perching on the window ledge, Harry picked up a colourful Christmas card and jumped when it immediately started singing a Christmas carol as he opened it. Good gracious, George! Harry breathed out slowly, willing his heart rate down, but then flinched again at the sound of soft rustling and an annoyed hoot. He only relaxed once his searching eyes had landed on Draco's eagle owl, who had been sleeping on top of a bookcase.
Draco smiled. Here, in their memory book, was even a slightly blurry picture of the special occasion during which Draco's mother had come to tea at her sister's... and Draco had brought Harry as his date. To say it had been stiff and awkward would be an understatement, yet they had all very politely agreed to do it again sometime (far,
The bushy-haired girl gave her friend a sharp look. “Would you let me finish? I think I got it. With the highest probability I've seen it in
He really was. Although, of course, the scrapbook didn't show the downs of their relationship. It wasn't always sunshine and roses in Grimmauld Place. Because of who they were, Harry fought as often with Draco as Draco fought with Harry. Though after lots of yelling and sulking and occasionally a few tears, eventually they found back to common ground every time.
“Here we are, end of the cave.” Mabel pointed ahead and indeed, the water in front of them seemed somewhat lighter; an abruptly stopping, pitch black line overhead indicated the exit. “Hm, today's no hippopotamus here...”
“Perchta? You want to capture P– Now hold on, I thought she is that dog over there?” The Hunt's newest recruit was immensely confused.
Longbottom munched on a scone and grinned. “Yeah, look at Nick go. Good thing he's better now: Last time I spoke to him he was devastated because he had been once again turned down by the Headless Hunt. Shame, really.”
Balancing the hot beverage and an array of edibles on a tray, Draco went back to the study-slash-living-room and sat down at the desk. Though he'd been living here for months now, the room looked still rather uninhabited, with very little furniture in it.
Potter grinned at that. “Sure thing.” He gestured at the knocked over saplings. “Shall we finish this first though?”
(Draco's side note: Paradox? Also said to bring good fortune! Same as the leader being described as a demon, yet protector of the poor?)
The night went on. Conversations were fluctuating. Winky had joined Kreacher at their table and now they were coyly holding hands. Draco started eating some more, even though he had been convinced to be full after The Burrow.
Harry smiled ruefully. This would not be easy for the big boy. “This is her father, Em. We came to bring her home. So that she can wake up again and grow and have a life, you know?”
Seeker slumped down at the bottom of the statue and just sat there, while people came and went, like waves at the shore.
A small cloud of soft light floated preceding The Hunt in a distance. Simply looking at it made Harry feel whole, as if all the little holes in his heart were patched. It was an ethereal glimmer that enveloped every part of him, all while being far away. It was immemorial yearning, aching, wanting. In its centre was a shimmering dragon shrouded in feelings of home and safety.
So... yeah, that took an awful lot longer than anticipated. And it's definitely no longer weekend. I'm very sorry.
“Why are you asking?” BraveHeart lay on his stomach, his mask riding on top of his mouse-brown hair. While he couldn't let go of the mask completely, there were more and more times when he openly showed his face. Seeker couldn't be prouder.
They had been playing this game for a month now and yet the right name hadn't popped up so far. Or maybe it had and Draco had just not recognised it. Worst case scenario.
They were closer now and finally Draco could hear them too: noise, terrible, screeching, maddening noise. Rattling, screaming, hooting, yelling, wailing, groaning and grunting from a hundred throats. Followed by alluringly wild melodies and the din of thousands of sweet silver bells. And over all that the
Death slowly clapped his hands, deafening like cracks of thunder. “Very good, Master Harry. Yet you missed one thing. Nosy people that call themselves knowledgeable often claim that the Elder Wand's core is a Thestral tail hair. That's only partly true; it's a tail hair from Sleipnir.”
Nervously Draco wiped his hands on his cloak, his eyes darting around in the little room. “Hagrid and Madame Maxine, eh? Isn't it about time they tied the knot?” He was stalling and he knew it.
Draco braced himself. Well, it would have been too easy to get an uneventful day. His fingers wrapped themselves around his wand. He would not attack but at least try to protect himself.
There was no movement between the four silent people standing vis-à-vis. Harry thought that his swallowing was as loud as a gunshot. Taking Death's place... becoming Death.
Half cleared his throat, trying to look important: “Perchta is Holle, is Selden is Mallt-y-Nos, is Diana is Artemis, is Persephone is Hekate, is many others. She has lots of names. We all call her the name she had when we first met her, so for us, she is Perchta and for you, she is Holle,” he clarified.
As if to prove a point, Kreacher used that exact moment to appear at Draco's elbow to point out his Master should not forget to brush his teeth later.
They had then proceeded in hanging up the painting in Sirius' old bedroom on the fourth floor and Harry and Draco both went up occasionally to say hello.
That seemed to brighten Parkinson's mood, because she suddenly leered. “How about a group name then? For one night only? DAIS:
To his surprise though, Granger positively beamed. “That is a great idea, Malfoy!” She turned to Weasley. “It would be just like old times!”
are ridiculous. Seeker, this is real!” Half huffed exasperatedly and rolled his eyes. “BraveHeart, do you think you could make us some masks for tonight?”
Finally, Ember spoke, his voice low and dangerous: “Try touching her and I'll break your arms.” Scoffer growled agreement as a warning.
“I'm throwing you off,” Draco grumbled and was secretly delighted to see Potter's small smile before he drew himself back up.
“Let me,” Harry coughed and produced the (teensy version of the) knife that Sirius had given him Christmas before last, the one that opened any lock. Good thing he'd packed it when he'd gone to fetch his spell book, in case the door to the Charms classroom would have been locked. In a flurry, he'd pushed it into the keyhole and the door swang open, revealing–
Life smiled and she looked younger than ever. “Because if we don't, who would care for the riders and the moss folk? And who would hunt The Beginning, for a restart of all life on earth? If we didn't go back, it would break the circle of life.”
Harry lifted his wand but was interrupted by a tsk-ing Malfoy who shook his head. “You have to point from slightly above – no, not like that, you berk, a shallower angle, yes, like so – and then say the incantation and at the
Just for fun, Harry tried the glasses and found that Draco's eyes were way better than his own. Placing Draco's glasses atop of his head, Harry lazily opened the notebook.
“What's your name now, hm?” The owl flapped its wings. “How about I give you one, would you like that?” He received a tender nip on his index finger. “Alright. So are you a girl or a boy? Er, I think girl.” An affirmative chirp. “Right, so... how about... Snowdrop?” Snowdrop seemed delighted and rubbed her head affectionately on the boy's biceps.
Zabini's face with the high cheekbones went even more ominous. “She had a nervous breakdown last week. Couldn't deal any more. Mother took her on a spa trip to quote unquote
After he had gotten his wand back from Potter following the trial, Draco could've tried to find employment somewhere, but he didn't need the money and he also highly doubted that someone would actually hire a former Death Eater.
rather dazzling, so I guess that's understandable. But you really should have your stalker tendencies looked at someday.”
Malfoy made an undignified noise and pulled an exaggerated sulky face, which made Harry smile involuntarily.
This is a flashback chapter. A glorious idea my super-creative super-beta umbrellaless22 came up with.
It was really difficult to decide on one storyline while giving credit to all the opposing pieces of lore. Which characteristics to give to whom? What to include/exclude?
When I started out I thought of reading a Wikipedia article on The Hunt and be done with it, but there were references and links left and right and I spent hours puzzling together the information I used in the end.
Teddy quickly took a step forward and grabbed Harry's arm. “What if you didn't? I mean, you're not even... you don't have to die yet!”
“Yes. It's the only place Dobby cannot sense. Because, well,” he shuffled his feet and stared at the tabletop, “because Winky... Winky is still drinking. The other elves sometimes look at Winky like they might send Winky down the Mell. And sometimes they look at Dobby that way, too. Because Dobby likes to be a free elf. So, Dobby and Winky is afraid of the Mell and have turned off messages from down there indefinitely.”
“Okay,” Draco said thoughtfully, “let's say this goes as planned – no one knows where to look for this supposed mythical stone. What makes you think it's in the Forbidden Forest?”
So his parents had decided to start anew and to permanently relocate to their summer residence in France. They both had felt they needed the physical distance to work through everything they'd lost: their beliefs, their dignity, so many friendships and of course a sister and a sister-in-law.
He reached the kitchen and fumbled with the kettle. Making tea, sleeping in comfortable beds, even showering earlier – all those things were familiar in a way and yet they felt foreign. He  really had lived an entirely different life these past months.
At least he found out from studying an area map that he was at Windsor Great Park. But that was barely anything.
Life hummed in agreement. “Because there wasn't one until just now. Okay, so listen up, I'll only explain once how it works. Like so: You have to stand in the middle of a crossroads and then the Key will show you the current location of The Wild Hunt.”
They'd decided to take the photographs with them (mostly for Ember/Crabbe) when they would visit The Hunt gang the next time; which was on New Year's Eve, before the big party at the turn of the year.
Queen Harry snickered, but quickly sobered when Malfoy directed a glare at him. “He drank the Time-Out Tea. It's supposed to calm people down when they are upset, by showing them a different perspective,” he explained.
There had been bickering and biscuits and they had all clinked glasses of non-alcoholic beverages to celebrate Greengrass' announcement of her sister's engagement.
“So we did: We built a little hut on the shore of the island of Inishtrahull, between here and there, between Scotland and Ireland, between land and sea. We took our vows with just the wind and the water as our witnesses.”
Even as a grotesque dog-thing, it was unmistakably Holle, the old crone, her aura radiating around her.
is! Hunt magic. Biscuit?” BraveHeart, the gang's secret food storer, had opened a bag of assorted sweets and was offering them to everyone.
Then the dragon boy's face softened. “Is it crazy that he's always on my mind? Even before... See, he got himself kidnapped by The Wild Hunt and now
“Moo-vee? Forget it – you simply thought of her and she materialised? But this is impossible! You're having me on.”
Right, so Harry had heard: The big circular, observational window into the lake had been shattered during The Battle of Hogwarts. While immediately fixed in order to not flood the whole castle, the spell that had been used had turned out to have the permanent effect of leak-proof but
Harry tried really hard to regain his composure, but by now, tears were running down his cheeks and he had trouble breathing, clutching his stomach.
“Hang on,” something had just occurred to Draco, “the rider, Ada, is your daughter?” He turned to Mabel. “And she's also your sister, which makes you...”
“Not much choice, hm. Catch!” Draco was abruptly pulled out of his musings by a broom flying his way.
“I don't need you to tell me,” Draco grumbled, but nevertheless started unsteadily to paddle towards where he assumed the surface. It was no use to dwell on his (totally non-existent) one-sided...
Harry was glad he had faced his doubts and opened the bedroom door. Maybe it had been knowing how close he'd come to lose Draco forever that had made Harry act. Or maybe it was the fact the The Wild Hunt with its laissez-faire attitude had rubbed off on him. Not to mention the knowledge of Draco's secret feelings. But most probably it was a mix of all of that.
Harry sighed inaudibly and slipped out of the bed, carefully making sure not to wake Draco. Although the blond boy looked healthier and overall better than the last time Harry had seen him, the dark circles under Draco's eyes spoke volumes about the (non-)amount of sleep he'd been getting lately. So maybe it was better, not to disturb him now.
The girl sniffed. “Well, you can be sorry later. But now you have to come with me. It's Greg.” With that she grabbed his arm and Disapparated them both with a
Now, almost done. All that was left to store away were a few robes and clothes. Draco opened the antique wardrobe and stopped short. In the otherwise empty closet hung a lonesome garment. The thing looked peculiar. Draco reached out his hand hesitantly to the shining, silvery cloak; it was strange to touch like water woven into material. Or as if one would hold a hand into a cloud. Especially the part where said hand disappeared from sight. Draco blinked and pulled back. All fingers accounted for.
His gaze slipped back to Potter who was unnervingly still looking at him with that weird expression. What do you say to someone you had hearty loathing for for seven years and then had some moments of silent agreement with during wartime?
At some point the anecdotes bled into Hunt research. Harry merely scanned the many foreign names and cross references, only stopping here and there, to properly read a promising passage or bullet point:
Seeker smiled sadly. Their betrayal would stick with him for a long time still; he knew as much. But he understood that their endeavours had come from a place of friendship and he would do his best to see it that way – even if it would take some time until he could trust them again.
Indeed, Draco Malfoy's little ink self was right on Harry's heels as the Invisibility Cloak fluttered around Hermione's shoulders and Ron yanked her up on the elbow. “Let's go. If Malfoy gets him, Harry'll do detention for the rest of his school life. We have to help him!”
Clearly unfazed, the snake hissed impatiently and started slithering away, yet paused to casually remark:
“Thank you,” he croaked, “and thank you for,” he made a vague hand gesture, “all this. And... for saving my life. Twice.” The last words were barely a whisper.
There, cuddling with Picture Parvati, was Lavender, face still pretty and unscarred. Back in school Harry had constantly thought her a bit silly. He knew better now. Yes, she was still a giggler, but she was also smart and caring and brave and wonderful.
The redhead huffed exasperatedly and flopped himself onto the table they had all been sitting around for some time, talking in circles. “Research, ugh. I thought I was done with school work for a lifetime! Is he really worth all the hassle?”
Ron ignored her though, looking thoughtfully back towards the Entrance Hall. “Wasn't that bad, really, was it? I mean, they tried.” He shrugged.
When they reached the stone, Ada led them to a hole that had approximately one metre in diameter. “This is it.”
To Harry's only-half-conscious surprise, Malfoy reacted immediately and turned to the summer tree painting, ripping the camouflage cloth aside and revealing a narrow iron door.
Draco pulled his idiot into a kiss that set off fireworks in the kitchen and although they had a long day ahead of them that would start fairly early, they didn't get much sleep that night.
“Let's hope Harry sees this and has the means (and mind) to answer. Ad interim, I want to have a look at this clock,” Hermione announced. “There's just something about it...”
So that had put another take-care-of thing on Draco's agenda, but he hadn't minded. The initiative was smart and necessary and now, ten months later, it showed how greatly it had been needed. A complete success. Draco was so proud of Harry for coming up with it.
“...I did, yes. In anticipation. Would you like some?” She gestured at a group of armchairs at the fire which, with the flick of her wand, had roared back into life.
Draco recoiled by the sound of the hated name. Still, he managed to send both of them incredulous looks. “You lived in my ancestors' house?
What Draco had tried to do was to draw his wand, what actually happened was that Potter  moved at the same time which ended with Draco's elbow hitting Potter full in the face.
“Perchta is their 'mother',” the others had explained. “They serve her and take care of Holle's Pond and food and all these things, for her and The Hunt. They even heal riders should they get injured. But the moss folk themselves don't ride with us. They just wait during the Yuletide till we settle somewhere for the rest of the year. We saw them last time, when we laid low at Hoher Meißner in summer and autumn. They are a fun little people, but most of them only come out at night.”
To his horror the boy underneath him started sobbing. Thick, painful sobs that told of big inner turmoil. As if the aggressiveness hadn't been enough of a sign of that.
“Hysterical,” Harry grumbled and rubbed his aching belly. Now he would have contusions in his back from the stairs and in his front from bloody Malfoy and... he peeked gingerly under the uplifted hem of his trousers. Yep, angry, purple bruises around both his ankles, just grand. As if they had waited for him to look, they started throbbing with a dull ache. Better than dead though.
His current residence wasn't very big, so Draco only needed a few steps into the adjacent kitchenette. He whooshed his wand to get the tea making started and frowned a bit. Who would have thought there would come the day that the heir of the Malfoy name had a home-cooked Weasley meal for breakfast.
The dame harrumphed and dropped the topic. “By the way, I promised myself I'd get you a thank you gift. You know, for saving us all from a maniac.”
Smiling softly, Draco revelled in the memory of twelve-year-old Potter being all flustered. True, the song was ghastly, but what fun it had been to see Potter go red like a tomato. “I won't forget that,” Draco vowed to himself.
After The Battle of Hogwarts in the summer of this year, things had been chaotic. Draco and his parents had been arrested and charged with various Death Eater related acts. They had been tried in front of the freshly reassembled Wizengamot and would have probably all been sent to Azkaban if Potter himself had not made a surprise appearance and spoken for the defence. He had pointed out Draco's age and reluctance, Lucius' indifference towards the Dark Lord's cause just before the end and Narcissa's lie that had effectively saved Potter's life. Luckily for the Malfoys, his word held a lot of weight within the wizarding community nowadays (and also Lucius' inside information had been highly welcome).
Coming out on the other side of the passage, he heard hastened footsteps behind him. Harry glimpsed backwards and almost ran head-first into a rattling suit of armour crossing his way. He had to do a little half-circle dance to not lose his balance.
In the meantime, Hermione went on: “But even he started to forget about you gradually. Therefore, we didn't remember anyone living here and  as we needed a space for research, Draco thought it would be best if he stayed here, so he, er, moved in?” She ended in a question, carefully watching for signs of an impending eruption.
There was no more wind, no sound, no nothing. Only a face. A laughing face framed by tousled black hair, with piercing green eyes behind round glasses.
They were all talking at once: “We thought you had an accident!” – “Someone said they saw you falling off of Lightning.” – “We were so worried!” – “What happened?”
', thought Pansy, but she held her tongue since she'd caught on to Granger's plan and really that was the easiest solution.
“Easy there, Pans.” Cassius laid one of his big hands soothingly onto her arm. “We'll find him. Don't worry. We'll look for, mh, maybe blueprints? Or something.” He squinted at Granger.
"Oh my god, Harry? I thought I'd never see you again," Draco sighed, grinning. Harry grinned back and scooted over so the blond could join them. Ron was looking between the two, confused, causing Harry to chuckle softly.
"Happy Christmas, Hermione," he said, returning the hug just as tightly, knowing they both needed it.
"Draco?" Harry asked, trying to squash the rapidly brewing hope in his chest, just in case. He hadn't seen the blond since he was three, but it'd be impossible to forget such an encounter. He couldn't just forget his husband, now could he?
By now, Cedric had made his way over, his head in a large bubble, making his head seem wider and more misshapen than it really was. He raised an eyebrow at Harry and the merman, but said nothing and took out a knife, freeing Cho and dragging her to the surface.
"I do, but he's not there either. Come, on, I'll take you." She started walking and Harry jogged a bit to catch up with her. "So tell me, golden boy, why would you be looking for him?"
"Are you sure you're alright?" she asked. Harry nodded, pressing his heels against his eyes as he tried to fight off the fatigue that was rapidly consuming him. It was then that Draco decided to walk back in.
"Hello Pretzel," Draco said, beaming at his house-elf,  "can I help you?" Draco had received her when he was six, and could you blame him for naming her after his favorite food at the time? Of course, now he much rather preferred apples, green apples to be specific.
" Till we go to Hogwarts of course! Oh Harry, everyone will be so happy to see you." She pulled him into a bone crushing hug.
"Let's go find an empty compartment," Harry commented, and they left Ron's parents with a final goodbye, getting on the train. Looks and whispered followed the three as they looked for somewhere to sit.
Harry, who had gotten used to lying in situations like this, easily responded with, "Well Neville, obviously. You do know we're roommates, right? Now, what are you doing here? I don't really want to talk to you."
"Where's Luna?" Hermione asked, scanning the common room for the familiar blonde who had been present just twenty minutes ago when Hermione had first left to pack.
Pushing aside his anxiety, he walked over to where they were sitting in the common room  one night after dinner. "Guys, I need to tell you something." The two looked up from their work, and Harry took a seat next to Hermione. It was silent for a few minutes, Harry trying to get the words to leave his mouth, Ron and Hermione waiting silently.
"Well, you see, Ron and I only just broke up, so I may be moving along much too fast. But I don't believe that for a second, because when two people should be together, why wait?"
It was different, nothing Harry had ever experienced before with Cho or Ginny. He didn't know if it was because it was a boy he was kissing, or because it was Draco he was kissing. The kiss was soft, sweet, everything Harry needed in that moment. He forgot about Ron, forgot about the world. In that moment, it was just Draco and him, nothing else. Of course, that was all ruined as soon as Harry pulled back, instantly feeling guilty again.
"Because you're Harry Potter, the coolest kid in the whole world! One day, we're gonna be married," the boy said confidently, putting his hands on his hips and giving a firm nod. Harry thought back to what his parents had said about being married...
"Master Draco told Pretzel all about Harry Potter. He saids yous has the prettiest green eyes, and that yous were very good on yous broomstick." Harry smirked, glancing at Draco.
The ginger sighed in defeat. "Alright Hermione." Hermione nodded, stood up, and went to her room. Pansy was there, doing her potions homework. When the bushy-haired girl walked in, Pansy looked up, a smile forming on her lips.
Hermione sighed. " Harry, I really am sorry about what I said a few weeks ago. And I'm sorry I told Madame Pomfrey about your P-"
Mrs. Weasley nodded, then looked at her family, before her eyes found Hermione again. "We want to see him."
"Like hell you will, I'll be doing the question-asking!" Harry looked over to Draco, who actually looked a bit scared. Pansy didn't want to deal with all this drama, so she conjured two little cups, scooping small amounts of the potion into them, and holding them out to the boys.
"But I have to say, the best part had to have been when he got turned into a ferret." Apparently Draco's parents were not aware of this, because they suddenly became VERY interested in the conversation. Draco groaned.
They didn't have time to discuss it though, for Hermione was going to miss the flight to Rome if she didn't apparate to the airport soon, and she still had to make the walk to Hogsmeade for that. With a final goodbye to the others, Hermione walked away. Draco left soon after to return the paper as he'd promised.
"No actually, I'm here for you Granger. It's Wealsey. He's in his bed crying. I figured you could help comfort him or something, seeing as your his girlfriend and all."
"Neville, we were a bit busy, if you don't mind," Seamus said, crossing his arms and staring at Dean's swollen lips.
Ignoring the blond, Harry eyed Hermione and Cho, questioning which was the one he was supposed to take. Malfoy was probably Krum's or something, and Cho was most likely Cedric's, so Harry went for 'Mione since that was clearly the most logical answer. He didn't even like Cho much anymore, it had only been a small crush, nothing serious.
"Theo used the killing curse on him. It was supposed to hit me." And this was when he finally broke, allowing the tears to fall, full on sobbing. Neville panicked, he'd never been good at comforting people. He ran out of the room and down the hall a ways, knowing Dean and Seamus had skipped lunch as well.
He stopped, and looked up when he heard a series of laughter from the room next door. He snorted, then pulled out a book to read. Theo was already asleep on his bed, snoring softly. That man really did love his sleep. Draco sat down on the couch, and read, laughter starting again in the room next door.
"Yeah..." Draco said, looking at the dark circles underneath Harry's eyes. He carefully stood up, carrying Harry in his arms to a nearby couch.
"Maybe she just realized how horrible your N.E.W.T. scores were, and she wants you to repeat your seventh year...again." Harry shoved his shoulder, though he was laughing.
"I have no idea what your talking about." Harry tone had a finality to it, ending the conversation. " I'll see you guys later." Harry walked back over to Ron and Hermione.
"Well, yes, but you have to understand that I tried to stop you from coming, you just wouldn't listen!"
When Harry's head broke the surface, he gasped for a breath, taking in all the air he could, and coughing slightly. Malfoy opened his eyes, spitting out some water, then turned to glare at Harry.
"I'm fine," he said in between coughs. "Just coughing, no big deal." He was feeling a bit dizzy, so he walked slowly into the front room, taking a seat on the couch. Almost instantly he was asleep, snoring softly in a position that couldn't be very comfortable. Draco, who had followed him out, Teddy in his arms, frowned. He shifted Teddy so that he had one arm free, and used his wand to fix Harry so that he was lying flat on his back across the couch.
Narcissa smiled as they walked off hand in hand, and the corner's of Lucius's mouth turned up slightly, before he cleared his throat. "If the Dark Lord ever finds out-"
"Why? So he can leave me like you and Ron did? So he can finally see me for the freak I am? So he can try to get the 'old Harry' bad because this one just isn't good enough? Why do you hate me so much, Hermione? Because if the roles were switched, I would have never said those those things about you, even if I didn't think you were there. I wouldn't have have spilled one of your deepest secrets, just because you were helpless in a hospital bed. I would have helped, I would have cared, I would have been there for you, instead of running away when you needed me most." Harry had tears of anger flooding down his face.
Everyone laughed. The air was light and happy, even George cracked a smile. The whole family had come to dinner, even Percy. The family had decided to forgive him for being a stupid git for a few years.
Food appeared, lining the four tables. Harry hardly noticed, not that he was hungry anyway. After Hermione had filled her plate, she began piling foods onto Harry's plate.
"It's what we're calling our plan to get you and Harry together. You know, because Draco and Harry together is Drarry." Draco rolled his eyes, and stood up to leave, because he did not need help from any Gryffindorks.
Harry used the rock to free the blond, and pulled him upwards, scowling the entire way, ignoring the funny feeling in his chest, or how he liked having the boy in his arms. When they were near the surface, Harry could feel the effects of the gillyweed wearing off, causing Harry to push just a little harder. The champion was now struggling for a breath, his lungs on fire and screaming at him. The water was slowly becoming icy again, prickling Harry like a thousand knives.
"No, I actually hadn't thought about it that much. Guess I forgot," he lied. Ginny sighed, rolling her eyes.
Harry awoke to Ron shaking his shoulder, although he hardly notices. All he can see is the pool of blood surrounding Dobby as he takes his final breaths. He presses the palms of his hands to try and remove the image from his eyes. He's panting, and covered in sweat. Ron's still trying to calm him down, when Hermione comes running into the room, followed by Ginny.
Harry groaned playfully. "Fine, let's just...talk." Draco nodded, and the two sat side by side on the bathroom floor, talking for nearly an hour, about everything. Well, almost everything. Neither mentioned, the war, their families, and Harry avoided anything related to the Dursley's. Myrtle even came to join them for a little while. It was nice, being there with the two. Myrtle wasn't even that bad when she wasn't whining. Finally, around one in the morning, Harry and Draco headed back, Harry under his invisibility cloak.
"How would you know if I've changed, I've never even done anything but insult you. And Harry and I don't even talk to each other, so your little plan probably won't work," the blond says, pointing a finger at the three.
"Yeah?" Harry followed Hermione's gaze all the way down to his arm, and he quickly tried to hide it, though the damage had been done.
He wasn’t even going to ask what it was he was doing here. To be honest, he wasn’t even sure he wanted to know. It wasn’t decent. Their kiss had been improper considering Draco acted as Potter’s financial advisor during his divorce - and showing up like this, here - on a Friday evening as if they were the best of mates, or even, as if they were dating, was highly improper and Draco was fairly certain Potter wasn’t thick enough not to understand it. But as usual, the Golden Boy played by his own rules - fuck everyone else.
Albus, the little shit, has drawn what looks like an extremely naïve interpretation of the London skyline with crayons all over the kitchen drawers whilst Harry’s sitting with James at the kitchen table, trying and obviously failing to help him with his preschool home assignment.
“Come on, Potter. I’ll get you home.” Draco said and Harry wasn’t sure if he was supposed to laugh or cry. Instead, for some bizarre reason, the only thing he could think of as Draco hoisted his business satchel over his shoulder and gripped Harry’s arm with both hands, was David Bowie’s ‘Changes’. He didn’t even know where the thought came from, or where he’d heard the song. Maybe one of Sirius’ old records, who knows?
And he’d been so vulnerable back then, crushed from the war and confused. He was facing trials that could have possibly put him in Azkaban for the rest of his life. His father was already there, the Kiss pending. His mother sat alone in the manor, once a home wrecked by dark magic and lost lives - enemies and friends alike.
It seems Harry needn’t have worried as much as he had. Draco, dressed in the same expensive suit with a robe over his shirt and the golden pocket watch in place, extended his hand without a sliver of doubt. His face was still blank and utterly professional as Harry looked into his grey eyes and his cold hand was steady, no-nonsense.
“Liffy!” and the elf popped in, watery and large eyes noticing Potter immediately before turning to Draco.
He'd worked the whole weekend, doing his best to cover up the left-overs of his mental and physical breakdown. He hated being confronted with feelings that weren’t supposed to be there, feelings he was still convinced he didn’t feel properly, and yet - he did. He tried to ignore the intruding thoughts of Potter and the bloody Friday evening that had completely gone to shit. It was hopeless. And when Potter’s owl had turned up at the bank as Draco was still sat at his desk, working late and doing everything in his power to regain some control of his life and himself, his world almost toppled over again.
"I meant to the hospital wing, you prat." The four rushed back up to where Ron was, and he paused to look at Malfoy.
"Oh, well I'm not completely sure, but I think so. He was always disappearing and whatnot. But Hermione forbade me to ask about it."
"I figured it out about a week ago in the library while were doing homework together." Hermione nodded.
"No, this is what he wants, not what he needs. One day you'll realize the immense difference between the two. Now let me go!"
"Wow Potter, you hate your soulmate that much, do you?" Pansy said, walking beside him as they strolled to the library.
She looked up at the two, and nodded before going back to her meal. They smiled at each other, before also devouring their food.
"That's awfully sweet of you," Lily said with a smile, trying to prevent things from getting out of hand. Why couldn't the Potter and Malfoys just get along?
Wormtail walked in, and Harry and Ron threw themselves on him. Wormtail began to choke Harry. But a split second of hesitation cost him his life. Another death. They rushed up the stairs. Bellatrix put a knife to Hermione's throat. Dobby dropped the chandelier, and they all barely escaped. But not before Bellatrix could throw the dagger, which found its way to Dobby's chest. Another death.
Harry took a deep breath, and knocked on the door of the manor, then turned to Ginny and grabbed her hand lightly. A house-elf answered, and Harry gave a polite nod it's way before leading the Weasley into his house.
Harry closed his eyes, taking deep breaths. "I'm bi." He opened one eye to see their reactions. Hermione's eyes were sparkling with delight, and Ron had gone back to his Charms assignment. He sighed in relief, and opened his other eye.
"So, Parkinson, how are you?" Pansy looked up from her trunk, which she had been rummaging through, and took a seat on her bed so she was facing Hermione.
"Harry!" Ron came running out the door the second he and Hermione had apparated there, like he had been waiting at the window. Honestly, he probably had been. Another bone crushing hug was given.
Malfoy looked at him like he was insane. "Do you really want me to answer that? Do you not remember our first six years of Hogwarts? Do you not remember right now?"
"Right, let's get Finnigan with Nott and Weasley, and Thomas with Goyle and Longbottom. Harry, why don't you work with Malfoy and Parkinson?" Harry couldn't help but feel this was all going to turn out horribly somehow. Things got even worse when he realized just what they were brewing that day. Veritaserum.
"I'm not sure. Maybe bringing to the manor wasn't such a good idea." Narcissa nodded, looking at the Gryffindor with a worried expression.
"Oh look, the lovebirds showed up. And where is Blaise, he's fifteen minutes late! I'm starving, and you do not want to see me hangry!" Pansy groaned.
"Nothing." Pansy rolled her eyes, shoving Harry's shoulder lightly and making him stumble a few steps to the side.
"Right, sorry." After the queasy feeling had passed, Harry opened his eyes, and his grip on Draco's hand tightened. "You took me
Draco threw open the door to his room, to find Theo there, looking like nothing had happened at all. Draco slammed the door shut, his hand grabbing for his wand. Theo looked up at the sudden noise.
Mr. Moony says that Harry of all people should know the correct password, seeing as he is who he is. Harry gave a quiet chuckle.
Happy Halloween everyone! May James and Lily rest in peace, and may Sir Nicholas have an excellent Deathday!
"He was Sirius's, before I got him. Oh, he was dreadful, but I wasn't allowed to set him free, he knew too much. Turns out, all I had to do was give him a fake horcrux for him to start being decent." Draco nodded, and the two began their meals. Harry had finished before Draco, and started making a mini snowman out of mashed potatoes.
"Harry! Harry!" Draco crouched down to Harry's level, shaking his shoulders. He panicked, he had no idea what was happening or what to do. Harry was sweating, his body as hot as a furnace. He checked Harry's pulse, which seemed to be beating way too fast. Trembling slightly, Draco picked up the smaller boy, one are under his knees, the other supporting his head. He bolted to the hospital room as fast as he could, almost crashing into two people arguing before they moved out of the way quickly. Eventually, Draco burst into the room, a slightly better Harry in his arms, but still trembling and now seemed as cold as ice.
"...and finally," she called, "Parkinson and Granger." Hermione's mouth dropped. She looked over at Pansy, who looked just as shocked. This year was certainly going to be interesting.
He did what he could to occupy himself. He went to work, dealt with documents he’d pushed back for ages because they were boring and he just didn’t want to. He joined a few of his co-workers on the field, even though his post these days where more administrative than anything. He’d missed being on the field. Ginny had been scared it was too dangerous and begged him, for their kid’s sake, to take on more office work. Harry considered asking to be put back in the field.
“It’s true. Apparently, Potter’s absolutely shattered and I can very well believe it. Shacklebolt was one of his closest mentors during the war and after when he went on to become an auror. I mean, I haven’t spoken to Ginny, she has another solicitor - but it seems as if it’s a rather amicable split, nonetheless. No explicit infidelity or anything, but it doesn’t have to be when it’s messy from the beginning. Especially considering Potter is beyond wealthy and Ginny has next to nothing. I mean, just look at it. She marries him quickly after the war, pops out a couple of kids and a few years later, goes off with half of his fortune - shacking up with the bloody Minister for Magic.”
Jim Morrison’s voice was gritty and penetrating as he sang of changing and loving and needing badly, and Draco sank down in his armchair, pulling his legs up. With a flick of his wand, a couple of lights went on, as well as a couple of candles. The wine tasted sweet and light on his tongue as he thumbed the book, and all felt well, for once.
His father looked at him with a raised eyebrow, his cane with its snake’s head resting between his fingers, gleaming in the shallow morning sun.
“Kreacher would never, master Malfoy!” Kreacher bowed and Harry looked at him with surprised eyes, his mouth having fallen open in slighted shock from the elf’s reaction. “Kreacher will make lunch. Of course, of course.”
“Harry,” Draco said, his voice hoarse, frail - and Draco had to clear his throat, still hiding himself against Potter’s neck as he spoke, holding on to his robes as Potter’s fingers wound themselves in Draco’s hair.
He smiled as he watched Draco move about in the kitchen, actually preparing something instead of having his house elf do it for him. Harry still suspected Liffy to be called upon to make the main, as Draco was stacking crackers and some kind of bread sticks on a large wooden cutting board and pulling what looked like finely wrapped cheeses from the fridge. Harry would have been happy with a normal cheddar and some bread - but, as he’d just established - Draco was a bloody snob.
No, of course not. Then again, they both knew what they did when they married. He’s not sure Astoria knows he’s gay, but she knows something’s not right. But it’s the way of things. Marriage. Children.
Draco gives a sharp nod, squeezing Harry’s hand before letting go and instead threading his fingers through Harry’s wild, black curls.
Draco felt his hands shaking. He stuffed one hand inside a pocket and clutched his cigarette with the other as he watched his father, his cheeks feeling warm.
“Shut up, Potter.” Draco sneered, pushing back and letting go of his throat. Harry was afraid he was going to leave. Instead, Draco shrugged of his coat and hung it on the wall to his left as Harry sagged against the wall. He didn’t remove his shoes, but Harry didn’t mind. He seldom did either. The house was too big and dark still to notice.
He’d done whatever he could to just press it back, too afraid of becoming so bloody vulnerable again. Reducing his urges to quick shags in bathroom stalls and one-night-stands which meant nothing. He’d done it because he was the same bloody coward he’d always had been. A narcissistic coward who preferred to blame his own short-comings on other people instead of fucking facing reality like a normal human being.
! Harry hissed to himself as he pushed away from the door and half ran down the stairs to the entrance, taking two steps at a time in the serpentine stairs.
“Potter’s having dinner with me.” Draco drawled with a sigh, turning his glass of wine between his fingers.
Draco snorted. “Wizard music is terrible. I’ll never admit to having said it, but with music, muggles do it better. By far.”
A hand touched his shoulder and Draco almost lashed out, his elbow thrown up in defence before he saw his assistant standing at his side, looking somewhat frightened and worried. He could see her lips moving as she watched him hesitantly. It took him a moment to realise he was still wearing his headphones and Lou Reed’s voice mixed with Mick Ronson’s piano was drowning out what she was trying to tell him.
Draco’s face fell. Hi? Was that all he was going to say? ‘Yes, hello. What the fuck do you want? How did you get into the building to begin with? What the actual
Potter pulled away from him, looking wrecked as he stared into Draco’s eyes. Draco stared back at him, his face blank and his chest moving up and down, constricted, painful. Potter said nothing more before he stumbled away, out from Draco’s kitchen and out of his flat - and, maybe his life?
Pulling on his gloves as he reaches the pavement, Draco looks up into the sky, and beyond the wet mist, he can see the sun trying to find its way through the clouds as Bowie’s voice sounds in his ears.
“I loved Ginny,” Potter continued and Draco rolled his eyes, still shivering from the strong liquor, “I still love her. But… I’m not attracted to her anymore. I don’t know what to call what I am. Queer, sure. Gay, no. Gender… It doesn’t bother me.” Potter eyed his half empty pint, but pushes it away. “I didn’t realise… Before. What we did, I mean - it wasn’t like that. I don’t regret it. I was just confused, you know?”
Friday, Harry had decided to call it. He didn’t know how else to think on it and he’d rather not remember it at all, if he was perfectly honest.
“I know,” Draco said as smoke rippled out in waves from his nostrils and mouth. “I’m still deciding.”
“Mm,” Harry hums, giving him a wink before he turns back to James and his assignment. Draco looks back over his shoulder and is pleased to see that Albus has indeed started on Harry’s settlement papers, but with every other stroke of his crayon, he misses the paper and just draws on the table instead.
“I-I’m-“ His assistant stuttered and Draco whipped out his wand, slamming the door shut in her face.
Then, Draco’s expression mellowed and he reached for a pack of fags lying on the counter. Harry didn’t mind his smoking - inside nonetheless - but he didn’t like it. Though, he said nothing. Lighting the cigarette and taking a deep inhale, Draco looked up at Harry. “I’ve quite frankly been feeling like dog shit, Potter.”
“I’m in love with someone else,” Ginny had said, her red hair bound in a loose knot on her head and her normally happy eyes dark and serious. Harry could see how tense she was, and her words didn’t register at first. Only that she was looking at him, intently, as if trying to force him to understand the strange words that left her mouth.
Draco was silent for a moment, seemingly contemplating Harry’s question. Then, with a crease between his eyebrows, he shook his head. “It’s for Scorpius’ sake. I wouldn’t want him to grow up being harassed for circumstances that’s beyond his control.”
When Draco pulled back, Harry was dazed and maybe, he’d even forgotten how to speak, if only for a moment or two. He was also impossibly hard.
Harry smiled and leaned forward, carefully pressing his lips against Draco’s, loving every second of those thin, cold lips against his own. His hand reached out and stroked Draco’s neck as he flicked his tongue against Draco’s lower lip in a plead for him to open up. He did, and Harry deepened the kiss without hesitation. It was lovely. Draco tasted salty from the food and sweet from the wine and he smelled like spices, cinnamon and cloves mixed with musk and Harry found he adored it.
He found enjoyment in this sort of sadism, letting her suffer. He supposed it was a remnant from his school years, the bullying - making himself feel better by acting like a condescending misogynistic arse towards others. It wasn’t that he hated women. He didn’t actively hate his mother and he certainly didn’t hate Astoria, he simply loathed the insipidness of some women. The lack of ambition and the fact that they would be happy to do a meagre job like his assistant under a man like him. He could basically ask her to do anything, and who would she go to? The goblins didn’t care and Draco knew for a fact his colleagues were worse than him. At least Draco didn’t force her to suck him off. Not that he would even want to, even if he would have been straight. Her blotchy cheeks and too round face had no character to it. She was what he’d consider ugly, for someone so young. Perhaps if she learned to take better care of herself, use a little make up and actually do something about that horrid hair of hers, she might not irritate him as much. She was completely insipid and it disgusted him.
Draco spluttered, honest to god - spluttered, where he sat, dressed in sodding joggers and a Deep Purple t-shirt. After Potter had asked him if he wanted to fuck Potter.
Looking back at Potter, Draco twirled his glass of wine in is hand, trying to handle it like the frail thing it was, without just losing his shit and throwing it into the wall in pure frustration.
Draco had always liked Daphne, Astoria’s sister back in school. She’d been a good enough friend before the war, so when Astoria showed interest in him, he’d begun dating her. One thing led to another and soon they were married in a large and sumptuous ceremony in Wiltshire. Astoria fell pregnant shortly after, thank the lord.
“You sure?” Harry asked breathily as he drew his fingers down towards Draco’s crotch. Draco squeezed his cock, making Harry groan as he leaned in, letting his lips wander over Draco’s neck.
“Mr Potter,” Gemma said, clasping her hands on the table. “We all wish to believe the best of our former partners, but we must also prepare for the worst. It does little to show up unprepared and it is mine and Mr Malfoy’s job to make sure you are as protected as humanly possible. This is what you pay us for. It’s unfortunate this only came to our knowledge this late, however, both Mr Malfoy and I are very much prepared for any kind of possible situation.”
“I haven’t forgiven you yet, Potter.” Draco said as he rose back up to his full height. “It’ll take some time, but…” he looked away for a moment before sighing. “I’ve come to terms with the fact that I might enjoy you as much as I hate you.”
Suffice to say, even if Ginny took half of Potter’s assets, which Draco and Gemma would be able to quite easily prevent as it looked right there and then after Draco’s initial briefing of Potter’s papers, he would still be one of the wealthiest men in all of Britain.
Potter looked at him for another silent moment, his eyes glimmering as he seemed to savour his wine. “I’m fine with whatever, Malfoy. Do you want to bugger me instead? Is that it?”
“Where’s Potter?” Draco looked around the hall, but couldn’t see his tousled head of hair anywhere. People prattled about, hurrying from one end to the other, some standing like he and Gemma, talking silently to each other. Then, another set of red hair showed up and stopped beside Arthur. Ginevra.
