Ginny's once angry expression turns soft. "I understand. I'm sorry if I stressed you out."
"I never am." He blurts out again. He doesn't know what he's saying.
He peaks at the scene before him. He sees his Aunt whispering to a Goblin.
He opens it at lightning speed. He opens to and notices the same handwriting from the present.
"But-" Harry begins.
"I want to talk to you... about, well... many things." Blaise says.
Draco stand to his feet and gives Harry a scowl. "Are you serious?! Do you ever keep your nose out of anything?!"
"I like your laugh." Neville blurts out. He grunts in frustration. "I'm sorry."
"Good job, Neville." Blaise says to him.
Draco chuckles as well. "Seriously though, that's terrible. I ought to hex them."
Blaise laughs once more, "Thank you. I'm sure if you laughed, I'd like your laugh as well." He smiles at him. Neville blushes even worse this time. He tries to hide his face but fails miserably.
Draco looked at him, not knowing how to respond, "T-thank... Uh, thanks?"
Harry took many deep breaths, while Draco sat there in shock once again.
Draco looks at Harry with a grimace, feeling like he was in first-year again. He took a gulp. "H-Harry? I-I'm... So-Sorry?" It felt weird calling him Harry and it surely felt weird saying sorry to anyone.
He suddenly realizes that Neville really is happy with Hannah. He can't take that away from him, that wouldn't be real love. Besides, seeing Neville happy is the only thing that gives him joy. He decides at once that he is fine with them falling in love if that's what Neville needs. After this present, he will never interact with Neville ever again, that's his promise to himself. If he truly loves Neville, he will keep that promise.
He thinks of a crazy idea... one that makes him sick to his stomach but also sounds perfect.
"Never?" Neville asks.
So much had gone on that she had nearly forgotten Draco's little crush on Harry. She noticed them giving each other strange looks. Ron seemed to notice as well.
"Draco? Are you ok? Merlin, you look like you've seen Myrtle in her underwear!" Blaise shouts.
"Leave!" Draco shouts at him.
Then, he realized that it was because that toast oddly enough make him feel included. It made him feel like he was apart of this perfect family that loved each other and maybe, if he was apart of it as well, they would all love him too. But that was unrealistic. They just formally met for the first time after he insulted all of them for years along with his father.
"I think I might love you..." Neville says again. He smiles wide. It felt right, but not entirely. Everything inside him told him to say what he really wanted to. He couldn't hold it back. "No... I do love you. I love you." Neville says, his smile growing wider. Perfect. It sounded and felt perfect.
Greyback goes over to Bellatrix, waiting to get Hermione.
He have a crush on Harry Potter?! Oh good Merlin!
Blaise follows him after and begins unloading the basket. Blaise pulls out various foods like blueberries, apples, treacle tarts, and a container of various cheeses.
He walks quickly and gracefully toward the dungeons. "Holly berries." He says clearly and the door to the common room opens immediately. He strides in to find Pansy sobbing in front of the fireplace. She stops as soon as she sees Draco.
He heard more moving on Harry's end, though he willed himself not to look. How perverted was he?!
"Are you sure I should be here? I mean, I'm not too friendly with the Weasley's..." Draco says.
"Why are you here?" Draco asks.
"Yes, grandmum. I know what I saw. He saw it too!" Neville gestures to Blaise. "We really like each other... He... He loves me!"
"Yeah... Been a while." Draco responds.
The judge says, grabbing his gavel and speaking again, "Due to information I was given recently, I hearby declare Draco Malfoy not guilty." He says, slamming his gavel down onto the sound block. "You may escort Draco Malfoy out of the court room."
They all notice Harry walking towards them. "Harry, mate! Are you alright?" Ron asks.
"Mister Malfoy?" says a nurse who interrupts their conversations, "Not meaning to intrude, but your mother insists that we get you something to eat as soon as possible."
He knocked on the door. "Enter." says his father sternly. He slowly opens the door and gulps. His eyes are met with his father's cold ones. He sat as still as a tree in winter, which only made Draco more nervous.
"Yes, my lord." Snape replies, swiftly making his way towards the Dark Lord. They whisper to each other then exit the room alone.
"Thank you for that. I really appreciate everything you do for me. I'll try my best to be better to myself. I'll talk to you later, yeah? Be safe, please. Eat good food and stay warm.
"What?" Harry asks with a sigh.
Blaise closes the space between them. His lips were soft and delicate against his. He couldn't help but feel jealous. His lips were chapped and rough, yet Blaise still kissed him. He didn't think he'd ever understand that.
"Hi. I need to talk to you please." Neville says.
Harry walks to the front of the classroom slowly, looking back from his classmates to Professor Lupin. "Go on, Harry," Lupin says.
"Oh yeah, surprise! We're going to the Weasley's for a nice dinner with everyone." Blaise informs.
He rushes towards her and sits in front of her.
Draco looks over at him, shocked by how close they were. "You did?" He says quietly.
"No, it's ok. I just didn't expect it... I mean, you can be..." Neville says.
"I'm still a Slytherin! What did you expect, my darling?" Blaise asks.
"What's the theory?"
Suddenly Draco stands up and begins to do the Irish jig. The whole hall erupts in laughter. Harry's face slowly lights up.
"S-sure..." Neville says softly.
"Hey, how's it going?" Blaise asks, taking a bite of a chicken leg.
Neville held Trevor closely as he walked back to the Gryffindor tower. He kept trying to slip out of his hand, like always.
"Ouch!" Harry holds his chest dramatically, which earns a chuckle from Ginny. He smiles and puts his hands in his pockets. "Merry Christmas, by the way."
Neville's POV:
"Yes, indeed. I know it's probably rude to eavesdrop but... It just seemed like something important to tell you." Pansy says.
"How long have you been doing this?" Harry asks him.
"So," He drawls out the o before continuing, "You can't just throw love away! Chase it! Don't let it die!"
"Wow, I didn't know you were such a Hufflepuff," Draco smirks.
"Now I have to look at this STUPID mark for the rest of my life!" Draco shouts, banging on his leg. Harry wonders how hard he was hitting his leg, but it looked like it was hard enough to leave a bit of a mark. "I just want to get rid of it." He sobs, "It makes me even more disgusting than before."
No, no, no! He tears the paper in half and buries his head in his hands. He's a coward, isn't he? But maybe it's for the best. Neville might have his eye on someone else and telling him he loves him will ruin that. He instead gets a fresh piece of parchment and shames himself for wasting the other one. He writes once more.
"Trust me, I won't." Blaise promises.
"Ah, not enough liquid. Try to add some more lemon juice and vanilla extract." Hunter suggests, which Blaise does.
"No. Not leaving." Harry says, crossing his arms over his chest.
"Well..." Blaise rubs the back of his neck, "I..."
"No! No. I..." Draco glances at the door, making a plan to make a break for it.
"Who is it? Tell me now." Harry demands.
Arthur gives both Blaise and Draco a warm smile. They both smile back at him, but Draco feels like he gave more of a wince.
"Fine... Deal?" Draco holds his hand out.
"Class dismissed!" Snape shouts, scaring him out of his thoughts.
Draco snickers, to which Blaise gives him a glare. "What?! It's funny."
"Uh..." Draco responds.
"What do you mean?" Draco sniffs.
"You're just going to invalidate your feelings like that?" Harry asks. "You know, the brain is a weird thing and considering the things you've gone through recently, it's not completely irrational to cry over it. To be honest, I cried the other day because Ron and Hermione gave me a hug. You could say that was pretty stupid too. A long time ago Ron cried over getting a gold Godric Gryffindor card. George laughed at him for weeks... But my point is, you aren't stupid for crying over this and you shouldn't tell yourself otherwise."
Hands grab his shoulders, making him jump. "Merry Christmas, Harry!" Fred and George say at once.
"Uh... How are you feeling? Did Madame Pomfrey discover what was wrong with you?" Harry asks.
Harry looks down at his other arm, the dark mark clear as day. But, what else was that? There was something else. Draco follows his gaze and gasps. He pulls his sleeve down quickly and holds his arm close to him.
"No, because you will stay away from her!"
"It was Blaise, wasn't it? That's the person you're talking about?" He asks.
"Can we speak alone?" He asks the woman beside Draco and Gregory Hullons. They both nod and walk away from them, leaving them alone in a silent hallway.
The Hall erupts in cheers at the sight. He doesn't know whether to smile or feel scared.
"It's- Wait," Harry says with a smirk.
"Alright." Blaise grabs the book Neville laid down, presses the parchment onto the book and writes: 'Don't be afraid to speak your mind, brave one.'
He could hit himself, that always seemed to stop it. But then again Harry was right beside him and he would definitely notice. Not to mention if Luna on the other side of him happened the notice she would then be concerned too.
However, the thoughts wouldn't stop. It was making him crazy. Is he really this fucked up?
Draco finally decides to talk to him, but doesn't once look at Harry.
Harry sits and thinks for a bit, mostly about Draco. In short, if he wanted to forget about him and the mistake kiss that happened, he had to date someone else. Ginny wasn't too bad, she was beautiful indeed. Did he like her? He wasn't so sure. All he needed was to forget about the kiss, which was enough for him.
Between the stares, sad looks, and that strange encounter at the Three Broomsticks, she was convinced he had been enchanted.
"Great..." Harry replies sarcastically. Draco awkwardly put his books back in his bag. "See you later, yeah?" Harry asks.
He heard as the bath started. He sighed once more and walked out of the room with his book in hand.
Blaise is right! His grandmother can't tell him who to love or see! She sure can keep him from it, but that can't stop him.
Ron looks at Blaise as well and walks towards him.
Blaise rolls his eyes, "You don't understand. He will never ever love me back. It's just some stupid feeling that's useless. It doesn't get me anywhere, especially when the feelings aren't reciprocated."
"I can't believe it." Blaise whispers. "I never thought I'd hear those words from you."
"No, those things are disgusting!" Draco shouts, pushing them away.
"Yes, really. Go away." Draco demands. "But first give me back my wand."
"That's really nice... What is it?" Draco asks, his voice almost back to normal.
"I don't know if that will work. I tried to talk to him in class and he didn't say a word. Maybe he hates me now."
"Alright, Zabini, see you later! Good work today!" Hunter says, giving him a much unexpected hug. Blaise couldn't tell if he appreciated it or wanted to push this boy far away from him, so he did nothing except stand there until Hunter pulls away. "Good luck with love!" He runs out of the kitchen with the tray in hand and Blaise slowly follows him. He sees Hunter dip into his common room for a split second.
Blaise pulls away with a smile on his face, "Of course." He walks away without failing to look back at Neville and wave. Neville waves back awkwardly and notices Luna and Blaise walk out of the Great Hall together.
"Maybe it's not true?"
Draco gives him a suspicious look but still lowers the wand slowly and puts it in his pocket.
"From this day forward... your faith will be had in me." Voldemort says with a smirk, his pointy fingernail gesturing towards himself. "Step forward... come join me. Or die." He threatens, awaiting those to step forward.
Blaise grins, "Don't worry, Nev, I'll be the most bestest friend you can ever have!" He says dramatically. Neville snorts behind him, making his heart swell and his lips curl up into an even bigger smile.
Finally, he knew what he needed. He struggled to reach into his pocket and grab the bracelet, but it falls onto the floor. He grunts in frustration and agony.
"I will. I'm worried he won't tell me what the issue is, so please enlighten me."
Draco looks at him with wide eyes. "You're kidding..."
"Fine! But you have to tell Harry how you feel." Blaise says.
But he didn't want to think about that, it only made him hate himself more. So instead, he drowned his sorrows with firewhiskey.
"I... I'm glad you're safe." Harry speaks.
"Right, sorry... Well, who is it? Is it that Weasley girl?"
Draco remembers his father coming out of the room, his teeth barred and trying desperately to get away from the Aurors holding him back. He didn't remember anything after that except a dreadful fear that his father would get loose and beat him to his grave.
He leans back and Blaise gives him a look. Not a particularly bad one, but it still made Neville feel insecure. He looks back at the desk then leans back as well and crosses his arms over his chest.
"It's your feelings and it's nothing to be ashamed of. If you have feelings for a Slytherin, then great! Even if you can never ever be with them, these feelings can teach you something. Perhaps this person can teach you something. Every feeling and person you care for is there for a reason. A friend told me that, a very dear friend."
Neville smiles wide and looks at Blaise who is giving him a smirk. "You didn't believe me did you? But I was right, huh?"
He follows closely behind her and they meet outside with the Knight Bus waiting for them. Someone must have called for it.
"No!" Draco shouts again.
"Good evening, Bellatrix... What a delight to see you here." Dumbledore says calmly. His Aunt just giggles.
"Avada Kedavra!" He hears Crabbe shout back. He runs away, only to notice Ron running after them.
They both stop for a while and stare at each other. Harry is looking at him with wide eyes. Draco, on the other hand, is going back and forth from an angry expression to a confused one.
Draco was finding his way back in the room after visiting the common room. He wanted a nice quiet place to study, and the Slytherin common room seemed to be the right place. Shockingly enough, only a few people were there, which made it even better.
His frantic walking was stopped by a hard thump into another person... Harry Potter. "Dammit, Potter, do you know how to bloody walk right?!" He shouts.
Neville's POV:
"You know what I mean, you evil little-"
Neville's POV:
Draco smirks, he knows it's the time. "Blaise is just mad because you thought he'd ever even think about hurting his boyfriend."
Draco's POV:
"To be honest, Xavier, I care nothing about Neville. It's my subject I care about, so shut it." Pansy demands.
"No... he'd think I'm lying. Besides, it won't be true because well... it's more than like. But if I said I love him then that would just be worse. He'd think I'm some freak."
"Hey, Neville!" Another voice says behind them.
Draco takes a deep breath and says, "I don't know... I was just sitting there realizing just how different my family is from theirs. I mean, my family has all these table rules and we have to be silent at the table and sit up straight. The Weasley's have none of that. My family is small and lonely and theirs is big and welcoming. I started to get jealous, you know. How could I have ever insulted a family like that? Then they made a toast and I... I felt included in their family almost... Even though I'm probably not at all." Draco says. "And I felt like someone was seeing me, you know. No one ever sees me really... Unless I make a big scene." He chuckles shortly.
"Y-yeah. What is i-it?" Neville asks softly.
"Neville!" Seamus says.
"Draco?" Draco jumped a little and his eyes met Harry Potter's.
"Well... me and Harry kissed and... Ron saw it." Draco informs.
"You know that boy who sent you the gift?" He asks and Neville nods. "I... Uh, I'm the person who send it to you."
"O-oh... Sure." Neville hands her a second pair of gloves.
He whispers something to the judge and he nods.
Blaise sighs loudly, "Even Neville thinks I'd harm him... I just can't believe it! The audacity to claim he's going to care for Neville when he doesn't even bat an eye when someone picks on him!"
"Oh, guys did you hear Longbottom got a girlfriend?" Goyle says.
She was certain this would work. Only time would tell. If she was lucky, she'd see them together by the end of this week. Unless of course they'll be their classic stubborn selves.
He grabbed Blaise by the robes and dragged him outside. Oh no, Draco thought. The last time this happened was to Draco when he kept giving Snape sneers and dragged him outside the room by his ear and shouted at him for thirty minutes straight. Harry seemed to know the feeling too. Harry stared at the door in horror. Something bad was going to happen.
"He was breathing really heavy! I was worried he'd kill over!" Blaise shouted.
"Well... I've never told anyone so this is a little nerve-wracking." He chuckles once more, "So... There's this boy who has always kinda been you know... Kinda an underdog I guess you could say. He's always so nervous it's kinda adorable." Blaise grins wide.
Draco sighs once more. "I... I think I like someone." He says feeling childish. Seriously, he's having a panic attack and the only thing he can say is 'I think I like someone.' What was he, six?!
The council stares at them both in shock.
"Get up!" Draco shouted.
Once again, as if trying to torture himself, he slowly sneaks another glance. Once again, Blaise is looking back, his smile now gone. Neville quickly looks back down, grabs his book, and walks swiftly out into the quiet halls of Hogwarts.
"Oh, hi Neville!" She whispers.
He examines it before giving him a smile, "A lion, huh?" Blaise looks at the floor, not daring to utter one word out of fear that his secret will be given away. "I will enchant this for you before the break begins. Consider this your Christmas present, Blaise." Dumbledore says with a smile and a twinkle in his eye.
"Thanks, Professor," Neville says softly, walking back to his desk with his head down.
He ran a hand through his hair with no essence of gentleness. He wanted to pull his hair out. He would never be good enough, would he? Now the Slytherins as a whole would destroy him and so would the rest of the world. He kept wondering why, oh why, was he in Gryffindor. He wasn't worthy whatsoever. If only that wretched dusty hat put him in Hufflepuff. That's exactly where he belongs. Besides, all the Hufflepuffs are seen as weak failures, just like he is. He was perfect for it, yet he got Gryffindor. It made no sense.
"Blaise." Luna informs.
"Blaise... Please let's get to the common room." Draco said, taking hold of Blaise's arm. He simply nods and they walk down to the dungeons.
"Well... I don't know. After this present I'm gonna try and get rid of these feelings." Blaise informs.
Snape gives him a look of knowing but it instantly is turned back to a stern seriousness. "This is no joke, this isn't something to put off. I will help you with your quest if you need me to, but you must do it yourself. If you don't, you and your family will be in grave danger. You must cooperate with me, Draco."
Draco's POV:
"Because..." Blaise sighs, "Because I want to. It's my responsibility to be on the good side. I can't let my school down."
"Well, not mean but maybe you should've said it better." says Hermione who takes a seat beside Harry with a tea cup in hand.
His father glances at Draco with anger. He steps into view, pulling up his sleeve and pointing his wand at the mark.
They step in and Blaise lets it all fly once more.
"Don't change the subject either!" Draco says back at him, slightly angered.
"Neville!" Blaise shouts, running to him.
"Good work!" says Lupin. The class continued on and only a couple of people managed to form a Patronus. Hermione Granger, however, didn't manage it and remained upset for the rest of the day.
"Yes please." He says. His grandmother walks over to the chair, reaches on the floor and hands him four pages of crinkled parchment.
All he had to do was get to Luna's house. But how? He needed a broom... Of course, his grandmother's old broom!
"Nothing." Neville replies, turning his gaze to the blanket below them. Everything is quiet until he realizes how close Blaise had gotten to him.
Draco's POV:
"Say it or I'll do this forever." Blaise sings.
Harry sighs, "Fine."
"I'm not that great..." He says with a fake chuckle, "I should be thanking you actually. You helped me out."
"But you do! It's hard to be nice when you get no respect at home! If anything, I'd say you were simply afraid of being disrespected at school as well." Myrtle says, "At least that's my guess."
"What? No, everything is fine... I need your help with something else." Blaise says.
They both roll their eyes and continue to talk amongst themselves.
"I'll tell you later." Luna says, which only worries him more.
Blaise put his hand on the back of Neville's neck, deepening the kiss. Goosebumps ran across Neville's arm at Blaise's touch. Blaise pulls away and lays his hand on Neville's cheek delicately.
"I've been a third wheel with Ron and Hermione for seven years." Harry chuckles, "It's not fun, but even if they are preoccupied with each other, they still care for me and love me."
"Let's get him to Saint Mungo's." Narcissa says, holding him up bridal style and carrying him away. Either Narcissa is incredibly strong, or Draco is incredibly skinny. He hopes for Narcissa's strength to be the reason.
"Neville, you have nothing to worry about. Just relax, alright? Everything is ok." Blaise says softly, giving him a kind smile. "I'm not Professor Snape, you know."
"Draco?" Harry's once mischievous expression turned concerned.
Blaise takes his pointer finger and places it under Neville's chin, lifting up his head softly. Neville stares up at him, eyes filled with a look of innocence.
"Can you hand me the aconite?" Blaise asks. Neville had almost forgotten what his voice sounded like. That strange feeling appeared again and he forgot what was happening around him until Blaise says, "Nev-Neville?"
He tried to breathe as to not cry or scream, or whatever his body might try to do to react to this fury he felt inside of him. After everything that happened between them?!
"It's ok. Thanks for telling me this." Draco replies awkwardly.
Draco looks skeptical, but does as he is told. He slowly stops shaking and takes a deep breath.
"I wanted to tell you but I was afraid you'd be mad or hate me or... ask me about my sexuality." Neville says.
"Very smart of you Draco.... Now listen to me. I knew someone just like you. He was special, had a good heart. But he made all the wrong decisions. I know what you're going through. Please, let me help you."
"Well, hopefully, you have fun with your candies!" Harry says with a smile.
"There's a letter in there!" Parvati says, picking it up.
"I... I-uhm. I was wo-wondering if you would... wanna go to the library- I mean! The ball! Wi-with me?" Neville asks her, wincing at his failure to speak correctly.
"Ronald! Listen, you never know. Yes, Malfoy has been horrible to us, but maybe he is finally growing up. But, we still need to be careful around him. Watch your back Harry, alright?" Hermione warns.
Draco chuckles at him, "Whipped."
"Go apologize then." Hermione says.
"Blaise," He whispered. Blaise looked over at him and this time, he could truly see the anger. "Uh, let's go to the common room! I need your help with my homework." Draco says, standing up and allowing Blaise to follow him out.
Draco bites his lip before saying, "I... I don't know... Maybe someone else can go first and I'll go last?"
Neville gulped and took many shaky deep breaths, but didn't feel any better.
He pulls Harry closer as their lips move in sync.
Not that he doesn't have his own mother. They have been bonding recently, him and his mother. But her hugs seemed slightly colder than this one.
Blaise rolls his eyes, "You'll never understand the extent of how innocent he is! He isn't your typical Gryffindor." Blaise sighs dreamily.
He looks back at the box, still holding onto the bracelet as if it was going to dissappear. He then notices not only various herbology suppiles but a letter. It was sealed with dark green wax that was stamped with the letter Z on it. He let out a "hmm" then picked up the herbology book. He was thrilled that it was indeed a book he hadn't read before. He pushes back the rest of the supplies and notices a small bag tied with twine.
"Hmm.... Nope! Besides, I had a valid reason."
"Your face says otherwise." Myrtle giggles.
It didn't take sense, none of it made sense! Draco said that Blaise liked Neville, right? Not Draco! Then again, Slytherins are great actors and Blaise has been around Draco a lot lately, almost non-stop. But, it didn't matter. After all, he didn't care about Draco like that. He hated him! That kiss meant nothing and they both know it. It was all just some freak mistake. Besides, if Harry did happen to act on these so-called feelings of his, Draco would most likely use it for his personal gain anyway. All Slytherins do that. So why on Earth was he moping around in the library with Draco Malfoy raiding his every thought?
"Hello, Professor," Draco replies nonchalantly.
Draco stares at him in shock. He couldn't say he wanted to laugh, he was just in wonder. If anyone were to like, or in this case love, Neville Longbottom it would've been Luna Lovegood.
Blaise sits in front of him with a smirk plastered on his face. "How are you?" He seemed to lose all sense of thought and the English language.
He opened it and began to read and Draco decided, to make it less awkward, he'd do the same. However, it was hard to reach with all of Harry's spell casting.
So him and Blaise sat alone together in a lone compartment, as silent as they can be. He could tell they both didn't want to be doing this.
"Who are you?" His mother asks.
"Fine." Neville snaps quietly. That seems to shut Blaise up.
Draco hugs himself and stares at Dumbledore's wooden desk. "Now, what happened exactly? And no arguing, speak one at a time and let the other speak their truth." Dumbledore says.
"What are you going to tell me?" Draco asks.
"Uh... What do you mean?" Neville asks, giving him a furrowed brow.
He instead stares at the book that was open on the table. The lesson was about Rowena Ravenclaw and Neville thought that, maybe if he'd listen it would be interesting. However, it's always hard to listen to Professor Binns's boring, monotone voice. That only made it harder to ignore Blaise.
"But Draco-"
"They said you were welcome here. They even asked your mother what you'd want to eat." Harry says.
"No!" Neville shouts.
They find a seat and both order hot chocolate.
Stop! He is a boy and so are you stop feeling all jittery and happy! But damn, his smile is great. "I'm... Glad you accept the apology. Uh, good morning by the way."
"You didn't need to do this, you know. But it's very kind. I'm just worried you'll break your arms."
When they finally get there, they walk in and Draco immediately notices Harry. It took everything in him to not walk right back out and run all the way to Antarctica.
He sighs and hears footsteps coming towards him. He expects Madame Pomfrey, but instead gets Blaise.
Harry was holding his hand... His hand. Not because they were fighting and he was pushing him away but because he reached for his hand... His hand!
"Yes, m-ma-my lord." He stuttered. He could feel his father's deadly glare aimed at him from behind.
"No one cares if you're fine or not, Potter." Draco sneers.
"Y-yeah! How about you?" Neville asks.
Draco nodded back at him and walked out. His mind went blank. Maybe now everything will be ok? Though, a part of him felt sick to his stomach even more so than before.
He rushes in Defense Against the Dark Arts, almost completely out of breath. He takes a seat, noticing Blaise still isn't around. After many minutes of staring at the table and tuning out Professor Lupin, the door creaks open.
He is pulled away from the castle and the other death eaters join them. His Aunt apparates them back to the Manor where his parents and the Dark Lord sit there waiting for them. He gulps.
"Wanna tell me why you're here, Neville?" Dumbledore asks as he pours himself fresh coffee.
"Draco, finally." Father lifts up his sleeve and reveals his dark mark. He points his wand right at it. A sudden fear washes over him. He wasn't prepared for this.
Blaise does what he is instructed to do once again then continues, "He has a girlfriend now."
"Too bold? Was that bad?" Neville asks nervously.
"Neville, don't go! Look, I'm sorry. I can't help it. I don't... I don't mean to be weird. I just... This isn't even the time, is it?" Blaise says.
"Now, back to this one," His Aunt smirks, holding his wand out to Hermione.
Myrtle takes her hand off his back and slowly floats off into the ceiling. Draco pulls his knees to his chest and starts sobbing again. He reaches for his left sleeve and pulls it up. He looks at his wrist for a while and Harry decides it would be a good time to come out.
"No! Nothing is wrong!" Neville shouted to Madame Pomfrey.
The judge sits in silence and reads the letter. He looks up at Draco with sad eyes.
Draco laughs so hard his chest hurts, "You blew her up into a balloon?" Harry nods while trying to hold back a smile. "Bravo, Harry Potter!"
"Uh..." Why did Potter care about him? "No. Get out." He demands. Potter didn't care, it was all a ploy.
Blaise takes hold of his hand this time. Neville suddenly feels a strange warmth not to mention a funny, but nice feeling rushing through his stomach.
"So... you're saying Draco and Narcissa Malfoy saved your life?" The judge asks.
They climb up many stairs to stop on the fourth floor in front of an oak door.
He finds his way to the entrance, remembering the password that was given to him. "Sherbet lemon!" He says. The gargoyle moves away to reveal a spiral staircase. Dumbledore is living large, huh?
Once his father knows he failed something he'll be upset. Of course, he may try to help him, but then Draco would fail again and again and finally his father would get fed up and call him stupid and throw curses at him, seeing how he could dodge them. In the meanwhile, he calls him weak for not blocking the spells quick enough. He wants to be what his father wants: a perfect wizard who knows all the spells without having to be taught much, doing it with ease. He never will, though. This school teaches him nothing!
The doors slammed shut and Snape stomped toward Blaise with fire in his eyes. You would've thought he was going to murder him.
Draco did the only thing he knew to do: follow him. Who cares what Madame Pomfrey would say?
"Hey, Draco," Pansy says, she softly touches his arm and giggles.
"Neville Longbottom." Neville says, earning laughs from Voldemort and his cult. If it weren't for Luna, Blaise would be storming towards them and hitting every single one of them with a hex right about now.
Then, Blaise walked over to him. Panic washed over his body and he quickly diverted his eyes at the table in front of him.
He grabbed the Marauder's Map, said aloud, "I solemnly swear I am up to no good." And tapped his wand to the page.
"Shut up!" Draco scolds, making Blaise cover his mouth.
"Ok. We can get you help. Me and Harry will figure something out, ok?" Blaise says. He can feel Draco shake against him. He wishes he could stop it for him, but he knows he can't.
"How do I know I can trust you?" Harry asks.
"Of course! It already is awkward. I tried to be his friend, then a bunch of Slytherins bullied him and he blames all of us. But, I can't say he was wrong in that. He is just protecting himself. Besides, we never would've worked out." Blaise finishes sadly.
He bumps into someone and his things scatter all over the floor. Draco grunts in annoyance. Oh no, it's even worse... It's Harry Potter he ran into. He knows he promised to be nicer, but that doesn't mean he can't hate him in silence.
Draco sighs but gets up anyway, making his way to the front of the class. "Remember, think of your happiest memory." Professor Lupin reminds.
"Why are you saying it like that?" Blaise asks.
"Yes," Neville replies.
"It's just as good as I imagined!" He says to Harry. Harry grins at him as he takes many more bites of the pie. He doesn't even realize that he abandoned his table manners almost completely.
"Oh, really? You don't seem to be wearing it right now." Dumbledore points out.
Much to Neville's dismay, Snape appears in his vision. Just at the sight of him, his palms get sweaty and he worries he'll do something wrong. He does everything wrong.
"You aren't, you can't be! It just isn't possible. You're a Slytherin! You're strong, Draco. I can see that in you. You're not like Filch, that's for sure. Don't put yourself down. And don't forget that I am your friend. If they don't care and if that dud in there doesn't care, then I will. You can count me on that. You can always come to me when you need someone, whether that is someone to rant to or a friend, I'm here. I will never ever not keep that promise." Blaise says.
Harry is baffled. They're the ones who took the potion?! Not to mention they're doing it all to humiliate Neville. He wonders if Blaise is in on it. He wouldn't put it past them.
"You didn't want any?" Blaise asks, holding out the box to Draco.
"I missed you too!" Neville says, holding onto Blaise for dear life. He took in his scent. He smelled of flowers, pine, and chocolate. He missed that smell.
The boy groans, "I can probably make him do something. Maybe make him confess to the whole class who he's in love with or if he wets the bed every night. Or both! I bet he does wet the bed." The boy chuckled.
"Says the boy with pictures of naked men in his drawer." Myrtle giggles.
"You're sneaking out to see that boy, aren't you?" She asks. Neville stares at her. He was glad he had his bracelet on, or he would probably start wheezing right about now. She walks over to him and sits beside him. She takes a deep breath and asks, "How do you really feel about his boy?"
"I understand now. Thank you." Blaise says.
He gulps and hesitantly walks toward him. He slowly raises his left sleeve. Without warning, he points his wand to the arm and a stabbing pain is sent through his veins, making him grunt in pain. Slowly, almost as if black ink was running over his arm, the dark mark made its way into his skin.
Harry smiles softly and kisses him gently. "You know," He whispers, "I used to think about this a lot. I'd ignore it though. I thought it was just some weird intrusive thought, but I realize now that I've wanted this for a long time."
"Yeah, of course." He says back.
Before he had another chance to go in circles with his thoughts, a hand slams onto his shoulder.
"For... No one! Just answer!" Blaise begs.
Neville chuckles softly, "Uh... I can't think of anything."
He sits dumbfounded. Is he implying that the guy he's thinking about is a Slytherin?! His heart races, but he reminds himself not to get his hopes up. He writes back quickly, his handwriting more messy than before.
"Well... Maybe it'll sound incredibly cheesy and sappy but... Neville does! He's always so adorable with his clumsiness and he has the cutest smiles. I just love him to death." Blaise can almost be certain he's smiling like an idiot. "Maybe you should go now, Draco."
Before his next class, he quickly grabs his bracelet from his dorm and rushes toward the classroom, only to realize he is pretty late. He kicks himself at his lack of time managment, but manages to run fast enough where he's only a couple of minutes late.
Draco's POV:
"That's ridiculous." Ron says.
"Well uh... You dress pretty nice... You smell nice..." Neville says nervously.
"What are bargyles?" Neville asks.
"What was on your arm?" Harry asks him.
Harry pulls Draco around to face him. Their chests are nearly touching. "Draco... Please talk to me. That's all I ask."
"No! Just drop it!" Draco shouts.
"You'll see Draco humiliate himself as well, so look forward to that." She smirks. She wasn't doing this for the same reason Xavier was, she didn't want to prank Draco and humiliate him. It was an upside, yes, but it wasn't the reason. Don't think she didn't notice how he looked at Harry.
"Do... Uh, do you want a hug?" Blaise asks.
"I know you more than you think," Blaise says. "I know that Snape makes you feel like crap and well... So does everyone else. I also know that you like Cauldron Cakes and Chocolate Frogs freak you out."
For all of his life, the dinners with his mother and father were completely silent and with many rules, most of which the Weasley's were breaking.
"Close your mouth!" Molly Weasley scolds.
The door opens to reveal Luna. "Good morning, Blaise. A letter came for you." She says, handing him a blank envelope.
Goyle joins in, "Good because the little prat deserves some shit thrown at him. He can't even put in a simple ingredient in the potion. That idiot almost ruined my whole grade! What a halfwit!" He shouts.
"Yes, I am." Harry says confidently. "I even have a letter Snape had written to Draco before he died." Harry says, reaching into his pocket and handing it over to the judge.
Harry momentarily looks away from his book to give Neville a glance of curiousity. "Which means?"
"I wouldn't know anything about that. He can't be in his little home you made me build, I destroyed it after he left."
"Oh, now you seem to know everything about me?! You know nothing! Nothing!" He shouts.
"Huh?" Draco said on instinct. "Why are you telling me that?"
"Uh... I think you should tell him." Neville chuckles nervously.
"May I have your attention?" Professor McGonagall says, interrupting Neville's sentence and the rest of the great hall's talking. "Professor Snape wishes to make an announcement."
"Me neither... Hey, Neville, you got a date yet?" Seamus asks, a crooked smile plastered on his face.
"What do you mean?" Blaise asked. His 'innocence' was rather hysterical. He wasn't going to get away with this.
He hid his face and felt a hand squeeze his arm. He looked up quickly to see Blaise discreetly gripping his arm.
He drew his wand, holding it tight in his hand and pointing it at Dumbledore. All he had to do was say Avada Kedavra, then everything would be ok.
"Let's go." His grandmother said, grabbing his hand and walking out the door. "You can throw that wrapper away, it's just trash."
Draco took a look around. It seemed cluttered and chaotic, but oddly comforting in some way. He didn't know how to explain it. It for sure wasn't anything like his home.
"What do you mean?" Blaise asks him.
Blaise's dark eyes dart from Neville to the table. He could tell he was making Blaise uncomfortable, but he couldn't take his eyes away.
Draco drops his shoulders, "Fine... But only a bite." Maggie perks up and hands Draco the fork.
Blaise slowly leans in, only to have the space closed instantly by Neville.
"I'm sorry." Harry says, looking straight into Blaise's eyes.
"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make things awkward." Neville blurts out once more. Wow, genius, you just made things more awkward.
Due to Neville's silence, Blaise's smile seemed to fade. "Well... I'm going to go then." He purses his lips together and puts his hands in his pockets. "Good luck." With that he walks away, leaving Neville to sigh in relief. He escaped the possibility of being a joke to someone once more.
Draco couldn't believe he did this! He just used his own curse from the dueling club against him!
"It was all Neville's doing." Luna says.
"I was confused by it for a while... But now that I said it to someone, it just feels right. It feels true." Blaise says, giving Draco a smile, "I'm glad I told you, even though I'm still terrified to tell you who it is..."
- Harry: Bisexual Biromantic with a preference for boys.
They make their way through the room and come face to face with Harry. They all draw their wands and hold it up to him. They honestly expected the Weasel and Mudblood.
Draco stares at him in wonder, not knowing what to say. Harry sighs and straightens out his glasses, standing up, and beginning to leave. "Potter!" Draco shouts at him.
The blueberry grows wings and flies away.
"Oh, maybe it's from Hannah!" Lavender Brown theorizes.
"The ball?! Oh, of course!" Hannah says happily.
"Accio teapot," Dumbledore says, pointing his wand at his desk. A teapot appears right in front of him and he takes two teacups and begins to pour the tea. "Here you go." Dumbledore pushes a teacup toward Draco and he sips it nervously. "You may be wondering why I kept you here... Well, I know you have been very upset recently and I know what Harry said must have hurt you."
Harry walks towards him and grabs his hands. "Stop that. Come here." He whispers calmly, pulling Draco up.
"Well..." Draco sighs, "I don't know. See, when I got back to my dorm, it was completely silent between me and Harry until today when he said we should 'just go back to normal' and that the kiss meant nothing." Draco finishes staring at the covers of Blaise's bed.
"Well, if this boy, whoever he is, doesn't like it then he is an ungrateful troll. However, I'm sure he will appreciate someone going out of their way to do something like this for them. By the way, what other things are you planning to get for this person?" Hunter asks.
Draco sighs, "But it makes me feel better."
There, sitting in all it's glory was a banoffee pie. He'd never seen one in person since he was twelve and it sat on his father's table, taunting him. He would beg for a piece, but father would never let him have one.
Draco watched as Blaise walked into the infirmary with a wide smile plastered upon his face.
Luna begged him to apparate to her home after they'd buried Dobby. So, that's what they did. They showed up in her garden and he noticed the tiny house that was beside their own was now gone.
It had been weeks since he had seen Blaise. He didn't realize it could hurt this much. His grandmother would yell at him to come out of him room, but he refused. He only ate after his grandmother would go to bed and then he'd creep through the house and snack on blueberries and crackers. But even blueberries made him feel crappy. The only thing he could think of was Blaise, no matter what he did.
"But... I don't remember who that was..." Neville says.
"Woah, you alright?" Harry asks him.
"What do you mean?" Snape asked.
"That's quite a hypocritical sentence for you, huh Potter?" Malfoy smirks.
"Alright." His grandmother says with a sigh. He knew she wanted him to be normal and not carry around every piece of trash she throws at him, but it's the only thing Neville has of his mother. Even if she thinks she's depositing trash to a nurse.
"H-Hi, mum." Neville says.
They zoom off into the sky and back to his house. At this point, it was pretty dark and Neville was pretty tired. As soon as he got home, he plopped onto his bed and fell asleep.
"Yes?"
"Open it!" Ron urges.
"Hi, Neville! Oh, you're carrying a lot of stuff." She points out.
After a few minutes, the cookies were almost perfect. "Good! Now, just one more try."
"Oh, yeah! Come on, Blaise." Pansy says, walking out of the great hall with Blaise following behind her.
"Thank you," Blaise says softly. "Are... Are you cold?"
"Maybe we can talk after lunch? Tell Hannah I said hello by the way." Luna says.
"I've been thinking about what happened the other day... you know, the k-kiss and uh..." Harry trails off before speaking again, "Well I talked to Pansy about it and-"
Blaise gives him a warm smile and squeezes his arm, he guesses as a way to comfort him. What Blaise doesn't understand is that it only makes it worse. But, again, a part of him doesn't mind it.
"Or what?" Draco said, smirking with confidence.
"What are you doing here, Potter?" Draco sneers.
"Helping a student that you bully!" Blaise shouted.
"I uhm... I need to confess something." Blaise gulps.
Soon enough his owl comes with a new envelope in her mouth and drops it on the desk. He was also thankful that this owl wasn't as greedy as his last one. She never pecked him continuously for food, but maybe that's because he was able to give this owl actual food.
Draco looks at Blaise, who is now staring at the floor. He gets up and closes the compartment door, casts muffliato and sits back down. "Everything will be ok," He says, not only to Blaise, but himself as well.
He covered his eyes, a single tear falling down his face. He could still hear the screams, but he wished he would go deaf. Suddenly, the screams stop.
"No. Not at all." Blaise gives a nervous chuckle.
- Ginny: Horse (happiest memory: first time she rode a broomstick)
Blaise's heart flutters inside him. He had just done some of the things he's wanted to do for what seems like ages. It felt like a dream, but he hoped it wasn't one.
Harry stares down at the floor and Draco tries to hold back a snicker. However, he doesn't hold back his gigantic grin.
"This is serious!" Blaise nearly shouts.
"Do you need to go to the infirmary?" Blaise whispers. A shiver goes down Neville's spine. What's happening to me?
"I don't think I will... Why are you upset?" Draco mocks Harry with a soft voice.
She holds up a clutched fist and opens it, something falling from her hand. He looks down and notices that it's a bubblegum wrapper. He pockets it before dropping his mothers ring onto the table beside her. It seemed useless, it's not like they'd realize it was their engagement rings. His grandmother insisted that it would be something that would make them happy in the long run, but he seriously doubted it.
"We'll always be here for you, especially me. Every single one of us will be here. I promise. You're my best mate and I'm not gonna let you deal with this alone, ya hear?" Blaise says.
- Neville: Demisexual Demiromantic (discovered by Harry's child Albus, an aroace, telling him what it is.)
"Boys, leave some for the guests!" Molly Weasley scolds.
Harry was sure of it now. He was wrong. He still tried to convince himself he cared nothing about Draco even as a soft smile found a way onto his face.
"How do you feel, mate?" Blaise asks, grabbing a chair and sitting beside the bed.
A knock was heard on his door once more. He stumbled up from his bed made of blankets and pillows to see who was at the door. He opened it to reveal Maggie.
"Yeah... Hopefully, I didn't embarrass him." Blaise says.
"What do you assume?" Draco says softly.
"Professor, we had to go speak to Professor Dumbledore," Harry says confidently.
"We need to know where Neville is and if a boy named Blaise has been here." Luna says.
She came into the hospital wing the next day after she had begged Neville to go there and get tests done.
Without another word, he rushes towards Ron and talks to him about, what he expects is the dinner. He watches their mouths move and soon enough Harry comes back to say:
"I hear you want to impress someone with my cookies. For my services, I ask for at least ten galleons, if not more." Hunter says. "It takes a lot of work to get past the house-elves. They hate me cooking in their kitchen."
"Can you say that louder, please?" Hannah requests.
"Well, then who?" Ron asks.
"It doesn't quite work with me... It's my mother's. It doesn't really... understand me." He gives a sarcastic grin.
He heard footsteps and looked up to see Neville carrying a big bag from Honeydukes.
"Shush!" Madame Pince scolds.
He lights his wand again with the spell and a small flame appears. He brings it to his arm, but before he can reach it someone shouts.
"Get out!" Draco shouts, putting his free hand onto Harry's chest and pushing him out. Harry grabs his hand to stop him and his back hits the wall.
"What is his fear?" Blaise asks nervously. He feels as if he should leave, stand up and run out of the great hall, but his legs wouldn't move.
Before he can walk away, Harry grabs onto his hand and holds onto it tight.
"Blueberry nougat." Dean says, his voice lacking any emotion. The fat lady opens the portal without another word and as they all step inside the common room Dean speaks, "Merlin, it's almost time for the Yule ball and I still don't have a date!"
"Don't worry. I'll make sure to not let any Rita Skeeter's know." Harry jokes. "I'll make sure you're safe and happy, I promise."
Draco felt his whole body heat up and go stiff. This isn't real.
"Due to your words I assume you don't like me back?" She says sadly.
"Uh, the nurse said you'd be able to go home soon now that you're healed and awake." Harry informs.
Harry sighs, "I'll take the left one?" He asks awkwardly.
"The traitor? Really?!" Crabbe exclaims.
"You think I know nothing?!" Harry shouts.
"You hate me!" Harry shouts.
He took a few bites of the chicken and that's when he realized just how hungry he was. Before he knew it, he was practically inhaling the food.
They apparate away and right in front of the Hog's Head.
"I still don't believe he had good intentions." Her father says and Luna gives out a sigh.
Draco laid awake in his new bed thinking about his father, Voldemort, and his quest. He imagined every possible outcome. Each one seemed more horrific than the previous one.
He knows he doesn't want to see this, but his legs won't move.
- George: Heterosexual Heteromantic
"You couldn't have heard it unless you entered the bathroom, idiot." Draco insults. "Why are you here?"
"Longbottom!" He heard a shout from behind him.
"George told me." Neville says.
He gets back to the Gryffindor common room entrance, only to realize he has once again forgotten the password.
"Where are my glasses?" She asks, not paying any attention to what he just said.
Harry's POV:
"My grandmother wanted me home like... a long time ago." Neville informs.
"Well it's two things, one is about Harry and the other about Neville." At the mention of Neville's name, Blaise's eyebrows raise.
"Fine... But can I at least help you out with this?" Harry asks him.
"I'll see you later, my darling. I have business to attend to." Blaise smirks and pulls Neville into a hug that makes Neville want to melt. "I love you. Be safe, alright?" Blaise says into his shoulder.
"Draco?" Goyle speaks, coming into the door room.
Ron and George were already filling up their plates and Arthur Weasley was already taking bites of chicken.
"Trevor." Blaise corrects.
"We aren't dating, I'm just going to the ball with her. I won't do anything." Harry promises.
"Don't think about them. Focus on the scent, focus on us." Blaise pauses for a minute, thinking of how to distract Draco, "Here, let's talk about something. Maybe... What makes us the happiest and why? You go first, Draco." Blaise says.
"I betrayed you. I knew you were on the good side, or at least you would be, but I went ahead and did what father wanted." Draco says.
Blaise stares at his shoes and rubs the back of his neck. "Oh uh,"
He finally hears, "Aha!" And Dumbledore shortly after comes back into view holding a bottle of a very pale purple liquid. "We will cover it in this." He sits back down at his chair, and hands Blaise the liquid. "Do the honors?"
Harry feels like he shouldn't be hearing this all, but he can't seem to move.
"You don't have to worry about me," Luna says, making Blaise look at her strangely.
As if on cue, Harry comes walking into the hospital wing once more. "Draco, I need to talk to you."
"No she didn't!" Blaise exclaims, "That's what her little smirks were for?! I honestly suspected that she knew I had a 'thing' for Neville. I didn't expect her to think it was you." He sighs in exhaustion.
As if on cue, his potions Professor stepped into the room. For once he was glad to see him. Something about his presence at this moment made the situation seem much less terrifying.
Draco scoffs, "He'll think Ginny sent it. Besides, I don't care for him anymore, especially after he attacked me! You're just simply too obsessed with Longbottom and being a lovesick little-"
He smiles to himself and sends the letter off. A response comes a lot later than he thought it would. He even was able to have an awkward breakfast with Luna and her father before it came back. He opened it and it said:
Now he could hear Leona Spickle calling him "fat" from the Slytherin table just behind him. Now that they all knew his insecurites there was no way it would stop. Considering Blaise has done nothing to take up for him just confirms his suspicions. He was such an idiot!
He decides to not go after Blaise, but instead to go find a place to rest and hide upon Crabbe's wishes.
He feels Blaise's arms wrap around his neck. This time he really can't hold back the tears. He sobs the same way he sobbed in his room when his father striked his shoulder with his cane. He is almost tempted to, in Maggie's words, "punish himself" to make it stop. But if he did, Blaise would've thought he was insane.
"No!" Draco shouts.
"O-oh. Sure!" He says back. "Where would we go?"
"Hi, Luna." He replied quietly.
They travel on Hannah's broomstick with Neville holding tight onto her waist and they soon make their way to the Three Broomsticks.
"Last night in the common room I couldn't help but overhear Draco droning on and on about you." Pansy says.
"What? Oh, yeah." He reaches for the aconite and hands it to Blaise. Their fingers touch momentarily and Neville unknowingly smiles. Everything in his body told him to reach for Blaise's hand, but logic told him that was ridiculous and weird. He would also probably be ridiculed for weeks, maybe months if he did that.
His hand shakes as he gives it to his owl and it flies away. He lays back down on his bed and cries more. He didn't understand why it hurt so much. Why did it feel like he was going to die?
"I am your mother." His grandmother tells her. She looks confused, then doesn't respond to his grandmother any longer. "Come on, Neville." His grandmother says, pulling him to the same spot she was in.
Let's be real here, Blaise and Malfoy would be great for each other! Both confident Slytherins with rich backgrounds. Not to mention Blaise most likely had a very good family. Draco wouldn't want him. He has just as bad of a family as Draco, if not worse.
Blaise playfully rolls his eyes, "Yeah," He chuckles. "Well, even when I did meet Neville I still didn't feel anything. Then one day I just started thinking about him and how clumsy and shy he is. Every little thing he did played in my mind. That was the first time in a while that I truly smiled. I really thought I just paid him that much attention because I wanted to find a way to prank him you know, mess with him a little. Well, that's how it started, then it just turned into me observing him, then admiring him. Funny how those things work."
"Finite incantatum!" shouted an eerie voice before him, making Malfoy stop completely and stand there hunching over and trying to catch his breath. No one other than Severus Snape stood before them. Not only did he stop the dancing, but he also made the whole room go silent.
He quickly grabs a quill and parchment. He dips his quill in ink and begins to write shakily.
Even though the Slytherins were a pain, he missed his dorm. Being here with Harry was worse than hearing Parkinson whine about every little thing. However, it was a close contender.
"O-oh... Ok." He looks over and sure enough, Luna sat there holding the newest edition of the Quibbler with her.
Blaise looks at him weird again, so he hands him the heavy school bag. However, he doesn't stop looking at him like he's crazy.
Great, now Harry is worried about Draco's well-being again. He blamed it on hero complex, which made his fears dissipate a little.
Malfoy was up to something, he was sure of it. Katie's friends told him all about Katie's run in with some deadly necklace. If he was correct, it must have been Malfoy considering how he ran away when he saw him talking with one of Katie's friends. Him and Ron talked about how strange Malfoy has been acting and Harry quickly forgot about all the supposed feelings he must have had for him. He must've known it wasn't a "truth" potion at all. If anything, he ingested the potion at the last minute to make Harry seem foolish, to embarrass him later on. Maybe... just maybe it's also something more sinister. Malfoy and his father weren't much different. Not to mention that no Slytherin ever has had good intentions. He only hoped Blaise was an exception.
"Why? Isn't this bathroom free for everyone?" Harry asks.
He felt incredibly lonely, but at the same time he wanted it to stay like this forever. He deserved it after all.
"Pr-Professor!" Goyle said shakily.
Harry, even though he felt embarrassed and guilty, rushes after Snape.
Neville takes a deep breath, grips his hands onto the broom and kicks off softly. He gasps when he notices he's floating and not flying all over the place like he did in first year.
He presses his lips together in confusion.
Blaise's breath catches in his throat. No, this can't be true. Luna squeezes his hand and he squeezes it back.
"No, not at all. Never think that. I honestly stress myself out. I should've just said no in the first place. I'm sorry, Ginny."
Draco's POV:
"Your husband did this?" The Auror asks.
"Yeah right," Ron says.
"W-well... Who is it?" Draco asks, worried about the answer. What if it's Harry as well? I mean, every girl has a crush on Harry. It wouldn't be surprising if all gay men liked Harry too. It's not like he had a chance with Harry, but having another person over the moon for him made him worried.
Oh. No. "Huh?"
She knew he'd never say anything himself, so she devised a plan. But, Xavier had found out she had gotten a veritaserum potion and offered her money if she shared it. She couldn't turn it down! The only other thing she needs to do was make Harry jealous.
Blaise raises his eyebrows and lowers them before shaking his head with a soft chuckle. "You know nothing, Potter."
"Get the fuck away from me! Never, ever talk to me again! Not in potions, not in herbology. I don't give a damn if we're partners, never say another word to me again!" Draco shouts.
"Sit." His father demands and Draco quickly obeys. "Sit up straight." He demands again, and Draco obeys once again. "The dark lord will be here soon. I expect you to be obedient and respectful. You will do everything I ask you to and what ever he asks you to. No negotiation. Understood?"
"Thank you so much. You've been a big help." Luna says with a smile.
"Just please, get him help. That's all I want." Neville says with pleading eyes.
Draco's POV:
"Yeah... I was studying. What's the issue with being gone long while studying?"
"A nurse will escort you." The lady says, gesturing to the nurse coming up towards them. They follow her and they lead them to the same room they've been to many, many, many times.
Neville's POV:
"Try it again, but with more voice," Lupin advises. Draco raises his wand once more and tries again.
"No, I didn't. Harry can handle criticism, plus I speak to him quite a lot. You are a different story. I don't know you much, but I know your father. I know he must be hard on you." Dumbledore says, taking a sip of his tea.
"Jealous, Malfoy?" Ron teases back.
The only issue was that Pansy and Goyle kept pestering him about where he was.
Pansy eventually became good friends with Blaise, Neville, Harry, Draco, and Luna. But, Luna is her best friend. She now runs a match-making business and is called Match-making Pansy. She is pretty popular, actually, but Draco and Harry get annoyed with her constant brags about getting them together. She remains single and happy in her small, but comfortable, flat/apartment.
Neville quickly grabs an ingredient and pours it into the potion. As he stirs, the steam gets bigger and bigger and the bubbles grow higher and higher.
He blushed. How could he be thinking this way?!
"Luna! I haven't seen you in a while, dear. What are you doing here?" She asks, laying her book down.
"What things?" He asks nervously.
"Get out here, now." Blaise demands.
"He didn't do it, Severus did it!"
"You should probably get your wounds checked out, Neville." Hermione says.
"Nev?! What the hell is that?!" Draco teases.
Luna lives alone at her childhood home. Her father died a few years after the war, but Blaise was able to help her get to her feet before he moved in with Neville. She owns one cat named Beatrice and has a butterfly who visits her everyday in the garden that she named Frank. She is also single but very comfortable with it and enjoys running her shop with Blaise, who she ended up calling her brother after a few years of living together. It seems to make Blaise smile. She was also given the title of godmother from Neville and Blaise and babysits Naya whenever Blaise and Neville go out somewhere or they have to work. However, when Naya was a baby she'd often cry for Luna because she'd have to watch her so much. Naya is still very close to Luna and often comes to her for everything, but eventually had gotten close to her fathers as well.
"Ha-Hannah?" Neville says, catching her attention in the library.
Madame Pomfrey sighed. Neville did this many times. "Come on, Neville." She grabbed his arm gently and pulled him away from Blaise.
"Are you blushing?" Blaise whispers.
"After the Yule ball, or whenever I find the other things to give... It just seems so empty without something else. I don't know what else to do, though." Blaise sighs.
He looked back to Blaise and noticed a soft smile on his lips and a twinkle in his eye as they sat down with the Slytherins. He made it a goal to tease him about it later. However, deep down it made Draco happy to see someone like that. It's not like his father had shown much love to his mother ever. Even though it made him feel much shame, seeing someone look at another person that way with such love made Draco feel hope again.
"Get everyone inside! We have to kill the snake!" Harry says to them.
"You want payment, huh?" The owl nods its head once in response. "Well... I don't have much but I have some crackers. They aren't good though... I tried them. You want those?" Blaise asks and the owl nods once more. Blaise sighs, grabs the crackers from the kitchen and lays it in front of the owl. The owl nibbles on the crackers as he reads the letter.
He's shaking as if he was standing naked in the freezing cold. Blaise couldn't stand to see him like this.
Suddenly the pressure on his chest vanishes and he can breathe again. He takes many deep breaths and closes his eyes.
"I am happy to help. What can I say, when you're as old as me you learn many things to pass onto the people who need it most. Just so you know, though, I am proud of you for being so generous to Neville. He really needs it. You can be assured that he is very thankful, even if he has no idea it's you." Dumbledore tells him, going up to him and handing him a bag of sherbet lemons. "That's for your time." He gives him a kind smile and pats him on the shoulder.
"Your voice... That smile you've giving me right now... I must be making things weird." Neville says.
Draco's POV:
"I'm fine. I'm fine." Neville says, breathing heavily.
McGonagall throws the first spell and Snape just blocks it. The more she throws at him, the farther he moves back. Neville watches Snape jump out the window and vanish.
"Yes. But, you are grounded for a week." His grandmother says.
He walks over to his owl and puts it into her beak. She flaps his wings and flies off into the wind. He had gotten a new owl since he wasn't able to bring his other owl with him, but he didn't mind. His old one would just remind him of his old home and he'd rather not remember that.
"That was after you had fun with them." Myrtle giggles.
"Now, we will be continuing the practice on the Patronus charm today." Professor Lupin says to the class. "Since Harry did it yesterday, why doesn't Draco come up and do it?"
When he knows he's gone, he sighs as well as a single tear rolls down his face.
"Come on, Mister Longbottom, let's get you checked out." Madame Pomfrey says, helping Neville to his feet and moving him over to a hospital bed.
Hermione steps towards Harry and sits beside him. "You don't seem too enthusiastic."
"Oh, great. Uh, I'll be outside." She says, stepping outside the room and going into an empty bathroom.
I wonder what I'll smell after it's finished. "When you are finished, if done correctly, the potion will be a pearly pink color," Snape says.
Harry takes a deep breath and raises his wand. "Expecto Patronum!" As Draco expected to happen, a bright blue light pours out of his wand, making the class gasp and Draco rolled his eyes once more. A stag struts around the classroom, running past Draco only inches apart, making him jump a little.
"You're right. What is wrong with his face?" His Aunt jokes.
Draco strutted down the hall in silence, thinking about why Harry suddenly was acting as if nothing happened. He felt angry and wanted to forget all about him, yet he also wanted to chase after him like a mutt. It made him hate himself much more. Only idiots would chase over someone like Potter.
"Sure..." Draco replies, dropping his head in shame for both his weakness and his rudeness.
"Ok, now add the blueberries into the mix." Hunter instructs, pushing the blueberries over to Blaise.
They both look towards the foot of the bed to see Harry standing there quietly.
The sun beat down on him, highlighting his dark locks and the light blue of his sweater. He looked beautiful. Blaise drinks in the sight for a few seconds, admiring the boy on the grass before moving from his spot and standing in front of him.
He could notice hesitation from Draco as he stalks towards him, grabs his arm and pulls him away from the Great Hall.
"Hi..." Harry says quietly.
"Well, now it's different," Draco says.
"Fine... Fine, we can try to get along..." Draco says, making Harry smile a little. "But don't get all weird and try to be my friend."
"Yes... He would sometimes beat up our house-elf instead of Draco... but other times he preferred to hit Draco." His mother admits. His eyes widen. He never expected his mother to ever care about this.
"Well done!" Lupin says cheerfully as the stag disappears into the wall. All the Gryffindors cheer while the Slytherins stay silent.
"What the hell is your problem, Potter?" Draco growls. "Don't you understand that I don't want you here?! I don't want anyone here! Leave!"
Draco sighs, "It's not you, that's for sure. I know why you didn't stand with me and I'm ok with it. But I honestly feel like you shouldn't be talking to me."
"Dear Draco,
His clothes were wrinkled, his hair a mess, his face and eyes red and covered in tears, and him rocking back and forth while violently scratching his arm.
"Hey, Longbottom," The Slytherin whispers.
All Draco can do is fight the urge to hex everyone in the room and run off with Harry. To tell him he'll protect him and everything will be ok. Instead, he does the next best thing.
Harry felt sad for the boy in front of him. He never really got a break. "Well, who is it?"
"You brought a Slytherin here?!" Ron shouts.
Harry leaves the room feeling much better. Maybe now things won't be so weird between him and Ginny. Then again, he kinda fueled this fire. He fueled the fire with Draco, now look where he is. He can only hope this fire dies down as quickly as it started.
"If you're wondering about Professor McGonagall, I'm sure she was thinking the same thing for you. Don't worry, just go relax." Dumbledore gave him a warm smile and gestured to the exit.
Harry rubs his neck and looks at the ground. His cheeks are tinted pink. "No I'm just curious."
"Potter, hold your tongue!" McGonagall ordered, making both Draco and Harry sit straight up. "Now both of you, go to your room! Professor Snape will assist you in finding it. If there happens to be any quarrels of any kind, there will be tremendous consequences."
"I-I meant to say that!" Draco shouts. No, he didn't!
Their potion turns pink slowly then shines like a pearl. He smiles at their victory and Snape comes over to look at their finished product.
"What's wrong?"
She feels heartbroken, but it was the right thing to do. It was weird between them anyways.
Snape sighed once more, "Look if you and Harry remain partners..." He got closer to Draco and whispered, "Perhaps then Voldemort will give you a pass. Perhaps then you can help him get to Potter instead of having to kill Dumbledore yourself. Perhaps... Just maybe, you'll be more well-liked by him."
Harry cut his eyes at Blaise and sighed, "For who?"
"Now get out." His father demands. Draco walks out, shocked that he managed to make it out of there without pain.
Lupin handed Harry a uniform to disguise him and they rush out the door but hide at the sight of marching students. Harry boldly runs forward, blending in with the other students and impressively not managing to get caught. They march into the Great Hall and once they're all inside, Neville and the others rush to the entrance, standing right outside and waiting for the right time.
An explaination of everyone's futures.
Draco leans in to take a whiff. It was hypnotizing, he almost forgot to speak. "I... I smell wood, broom polish, grass, and... Something else. I can't quite get." He says.
"Sorry," says a voice in a whisper. He looks back to notice Blaise. Great.
"You h-have... yo-your own pro-problems." Draco says through sobs.
No one else moves, at least not for a few seconds. Until he watches Neville limp forward and Blaise rushes toward him, only to be pulled back by Luna. He shakes his head in disbelief. Not Neville, please no.
He laid there alone that day, wishing his brain would stop working. He had a few letters come to him, but his grandmother always took them away. Perhaps if his owl was quieter and more stealthy, then he would be able to get the letters. Instead, he read through Blaise's old letters. Well, the one's where he didn't know it was Blaise.
"N-no! I c-can handle it!" Neville claims.
The soft music plays but is relatively covered by the loud chattering and laughing all around.
His chest tightened and he felt a lump form in his throat. He can't do this, not today. He reaches into his pocket and quickly slips on the bracelet. Blaise takes notice to this, but says nothing at all. His muscles relax and he takes a silent deep breath. Everything is ok.
"It doesn't matter," Neville replies, softly petting Trevor.
"Thanks, Harry." Draco says with a real smile this time. "I guess it is less stupid than crying over a card." He jokes.
"You just ate dirty sock and you're still smiling like a buffoon."
What Snape said rings in his head. He really does mess everything up. He really is stupid. He finds a bench and plops onto it. The more the words ring in his head, the worse he feels. Why did he think he could do all of that on his own? Maybe he should've stopped moping around and let Blaise do the potion. Maybe then everything would be fine. Maybe then he wouldn't have made things worse. Maybe if he wasn't such a loser he would have friends. So many things he should've changed from day one that are the source of all his problems now. The only way he knows how to make the problems go away and make his feelings disappear is food. It's the only thing that kills his mind. What else can he do, drink firewhiskey?! Definitely not. His grandmother would have his head! Blaise made it go away for a short while whenever they were together, but that wasn't real. He just wanted to make him look like a fool. Perhaps he knew all about Neville's horrible relationship with food. That might be why he bought him all that candy. He hated himself for eating all of it in one day.
Before Draco could say another word, Molly's voice booms through the house. "Dinner is ready!" She shouts.
"What do you want?" He groans.
What she doesn't understand is that nothing ever goes his way. Every friend leaves him or just ends up ignoring him until they need a favor. So far only Luna has stayed with him this long. He isn't so sure about Hannah, especially after he trusted Blaise. He still beats himself up for that.
Oddly enough, he seemed the most comfortable around Luna! He never expected that, but then again he felt comfortable around Luna as well.
"Thank you." He says and she gives him a nod.
Of course, his father never called himself Draco's father, he wouldn't dare! He's embarrassed them too much to be their son. But, maybe, just maybe if he goes through with this he will be accepted from them once again. That's all that matters, right? Plus, it's not too bad anyway. This is the way it's supposed to be. This is the right way to live.
Draco touches his cheeks, feeling that they're wet. He wipes his eyes quickly. "I'm not! Now go away you disgusting creep." He insults.
"Since after the war. We had been talking before this. I began to have feelings for him before that... But then we had the same patronus and-"
Draco sighs. Passing out over something that stupid? Really? His father couldn't even get to him and he passed out?!
Draco gasps, "Professor Snape said he was missing veritaserum!"
"Don't take this the wrong way. I understand what you're going through. Sometimes I wonder... if I wasn't alive anymore then maybe I wouldn't have to deal with all of this. Maybe I wouldn't be forced to do things I don't want to and be someone I'm not and maybe... maybe I wouldn't worry about feeling loved. Everything would just go away." Draco admits, almost seeming to talk to himself more than Blaise.
"Yeah..." Blaise trails off and smiles to himself.
Another voice came in from behind him, "He's too stupid. Or perhaps he's just too nervous around his little crush."
Blaise reaches forward again and leaves persistent kisses upon his cheek playfully, "Say you're handsome right now!" Blaise teases.
"Honestly, I'm surprised he still goes here? Isn't he a squib?" Another boy who was in fourth year asks.
He could feel the room darken as the Dark Lord entered. He stared down at the dark wood of the table.
Draco jolts up in his bed and sees Blaise beside him. "When did you get here?"
"Neville?" A soft voice said beside him.
"What?" Harry said, slightly angrier than he meant for it to sound.
Neville looks up at him and nods, "Hey, Harry," He says softly.
"Well... thanks." Draco says awkwardly.
He walked towards the black lake with Blaise coming into view. He noticed him with two broomsticks and rubbing something off his shoulder.
"Someone came into my office, a young Gryffindor. He had that bracelet in his pocket, the same one I enchanted. It may be some coincidence, but if I'm correct I'd say you gifted him that bracelet, yeah?" Blaise simply stares at the floor, debating whether or not to run away. "Just so you know, that bracelet helped him in a time of need today. He might've passed out if it wasn't for your gift. That's very kind of you." Blaise smiles at this. "But I'm assuming you didn't simply do it to be kind?"
"Sod off, Potter. Your life is great. You're praised for everything, even laying a brick in the loo." Draco jeered, making Harry huff in anger.
"Yeah... So much." Blaise smiles with a happy sigh, "Anyways, what about you?"
- Blaise: Lion (happiest memory: moments with Neville)
He stood still out of shock. Draco laid there crying, blood seeping out of his stomach. He hears heavy footsteps running towards him, but he can't move. Cold hands push him out of the way and lean down towards Draco. He quickly notices that it's Snape. He looks up at Harry with a look that Harry can't seem to put down before he picks up Draco in his arms and rushes out of the bathroom.
"Give me a break! What are you, a girl?" His father scolded. "Stop it this instant!" But he couldn't. The harder he tried the harder he sobbed. He could barely see anything, his face burned from embarrassment, and his head pounded. He could barely breathe. "Snap out of it!" His father shouted, slapping his cane across the side of Draco's body. He stumbled back, nearly falling off his bed but managed to catch himself. Oddly enough, this snapped him out of it.
"Let go of my hand." Draco demands threateningly.
"Ten?!" Harry shouts.
Neville furrows his brows at him, "Well, go on then."
"You won't regret it. Besides, you killed that snake. I'm sure you can take on this broom. Come on." Blaise says, gesturing for him to get on the broom. He does so, his nerves threatening to explode at any moment. Luckily enough, he had that life-saving bracelet on.
"What?!" Both Harry and Draco shout in sync.
Blaise smiles, "Huh... Well, it can't be Potter..." Draco blushes even worse and gulps. Blaise's eyes widen, "You don't mean to tell me-"
Myrtle giggles, "They were pretty exciting."
"Draco, you're here!" says Harry with a bright smile.
"Hi, Neville!" said Hannah Abbott in front of him.
"Very good." Dumbledore compliments. Bangs could be heard from the bottom of the tower. "Oh... you aren't alone. How'd you get them in here?"
"Now get a hold of yourself. You're embarrassing us all." His father sighs and pinches the bridge of his nose, "Why couldn't I have had a normal son? Or better yet no son at all?! Just had to be lucky enough to get you, huh?" Draco stares at the floor. "Sit up." His father demands and Draco fixes his posture. With a deadly glare, his father turns away and leaves Draco alone in his room once more.
Draco's heartbeat quickens. He didn't expect that. He didn't even think Harry knew that he knew.
"I didn't hear anything. I just hear someone crying and there you were." Harry lies.
The flames morph into a dragon-like figure and roar at him and Crabbe. Goyle continues to throw flames from his wand with little care. Crabbe and Draco try to get away from the flames and climb up various objects to get away. The flames only get higher.
Neville is staring at the ground and twirling a piece of hair on his finger.
Draco takes a shaky sigh, "I... You... Look, I can't tell you. No one knows ok. If anyone knew I'd... They-"
"Then what were all those brags about daddy's money about?" Harry steps towards him. "What, do you have a sad pathetic life, wasting away in a dark dingy bedroom sleeping on a lumpy mattress?!" Closer. "Does your daddy not give you enough hugs? Oh sad, poor little Draco." He was right in his face. He wanted to punch him square in his nose, but he didn't. He actually felt quite nervous. "You're pathetic."
"Well... I don't know. But I'd like to maybe... try to be together. Maybe we can go to the Yule Ball together next week?" Neville suggests.
Draco's POV:
Blaise narrows his eyes at him, "Aren't you supposed to be in that bed until they figure out what's wrong with you?"
"Fine, but after I tell you, we turn back to the original subject. Got it?" Draco nods to him and he takes a deep breath, "Neville and I are together."
"I shouldn't have said that, huh? Look, I apologize if this upsets you. He really cares about you, but this is one of the reasons, at least I think, that he keeps his distance. The other, according to his letter, is due to you dating Hannah. He doesn't want to ruin anything for you because he cares for you. Trust me, even though it may seem bad that a boy likes you, he won't act on it I promise." Luna says.
"I honestly just think you two went through some traumatic events and now because you endured it together you both think you have feelings for each other."
"I'll get you, Draco Malfoy!" Myrtle shouts after him as he falls into the hallway.
"I know." Neville squeaks. "Wh-why are you being so nice?"
"It's ok. I'd rather change the subject. May you tell me who it is?" Neville asks.
The room felt warmer, which made him feel worse. He tried to hold it back, but he couldn't stop. Tears formed in his eyes and slowly trickled down his face. No, no, no. There he goes again, embarrassing himself.
"Hello, Professor. I'm here to ask a question." Blaise says, feeling pretty small all the sudden.
"No, Zabini, I haven't."
"Only people we know. Don't worry." Blaise assures him and puts his arm around his shoulder.
Happy memory, Blaise. Happy memory.
"Well... I wanted it to be personal. I wanted to... well, make them on my own." Blaise says.
Draco sat in the stall, trying not to cry. Malfoy's don't cry.
"Moly plants..."
He waits until he gets back to his room to take a deep breath. Though he failed to realize that he had much bigger issues to deal with than his father.
"Oh..." Harry trails off, now looking worried himself.
A knock on his door startled him. He opens his closet door and quickly goes to open his bedroom door. He is relieved to see that it's only the house-elf Maggie.
"Are you alright... dear?" The Fat Lady says, speaking almost fearfully.
"Clearly." Blaise laughs softly. "Where are you headed to?"
Draco's POV:
What?! That can't be true! Unless...
"Yeah! I mean, surely it didn't mean anything. I mean, perhaps the veritaserum was messed up... there is no way we'd like each other. Right?" Harry asks.
"It's fine..." He replies awkwardly, covering up his chest with his arms.
Giggles could be heard as soon as he entered. "Yeah-- Draco?" Pansy says from the left corner of the room. She walks towards him quickly. "Oh baby--"
"Don't worry, whenever you and Potter get together I'll get you back."
The next day she strutted down the halls and stepped right up to Harry and his little group of Gryffindors.
Draco held his breath as it slowly opened and out came not only his father but Voldemort himself.
"How are you?" She asks.
"Uh... Are you ok? You've been like... Staring." Harry says.
Harry looked at him, shocking him at how soft his expression was, "I would never... We don't even have to talk about it ever again if you wish!"
"Sure thing." Seamus says with a smile. "Hey, fat lady!" Seamus says, turning to the entrance of the common room.
"Of course! We can go ahead and coat it in lavender to start off." Dumbledore steps away from his chair and goes up some steps across the room. Blaise can hear the opening and closing of drawers, but can no longer see the man.
"Well, she says that you told her." Draco says.
"Expecto Patronum!" Pansy shouts, but nothing happens. She looks down at her shoes.
He smiles and opens up the letter. He smiles wider at the familiar handwriting.
"Uh... Professor McGonagall t-told me to wait here for her." Neville announces.
Snape called him over and talked to him. Blaise then glanced at Neville. Oddly enough, the sensation he felt was different than when Snape would look at him. Both felt scary, but Blaise's glance felt... Different. Neville couldn't put his finger on it.
"Draco... come." Draco's father urges. He looks back and notices Draco standing amongst the crowd. He almost missed him. He watches as Draco's eyes dart around the crowd. Blaise saw a hint of something on his face, perhaps sadness? Dissappointment? Regardless, he didn't care. Draco betrayed him and all of Hogwarts. "Come!" His father urges again and Draco quickly moves from his spot and towards the crowd.
"You're quite early today." Professor Snape points out.
Draco still stood his ground, "Oh no, big bad golden boy's gonna hurt me! So scary!" He mocked. A couple of Slytherins giggled.
"Of course! Would it be ok for me to tell Hermione or Ron?" Harry asks.
The more he looked around, the more the thoughts dissipated. They finally dissappeared with his eyes found their way towards a familar looking couple. One with long red hair, the other with messy black hair. It can't be... it was. Ginny Weasley and Harry Potter.
Blaise's POV:
"You kissed?!" Blaise exclaims.
"And why is that?" Blaise asks, sounding a bit pressed.
"Yeah, I heard them talking! Pansy and some Xavier guy. They plan to humiliate them both! What a great friend you are!" Harry shouts.
"Blaise Zabini!" His mother's banshee voice screamed. He jumps up from his seat and stares at his mother with wide-eyes. "Turn that revolting music down and- have you been drinking?!" She shouts, "Answer me!"
"Let me in!" He pleaded with the Fat Lady, tearing streaming down his face.
After a moment of silence, Harry speaks up, "Goodnight, Malfoy."
"Well... I'm sure you'll know soon... the whole school will so... one of the Slytherins started pestering him about a lot of things and well... being under veritaserum you can see where this is going." Harry sighs.
Draco's eyes soften and he gives the Professor a nod before walking out. 'He's just trying to get you on his side.' Draco tells himself, 'He wouldn't actually help you, no one would.'
"Don't lie to me, Potter. What did you hear?!" He shouts, his wand still pointed at Harry.
"You need to concentrate more. The wand doesn't control you, you control it." Lupin says to Neville.
"Th-thanks." Neville says, smiling fakely. "Well, I... I am going to bed now."
"Really now?" Draco smirks.
"So..." Blaise started. "I guess we're partners now."
"I d-don't need i-it." Neville stuttered.
"Yes he can." A voice says behind them. He turns around and smiles. Many people from the Order of the Phoenix including Professor Lupin, Mister Weasley, Misses Wealsey, and many others. "We've got his back." says Tonks with a smile.
They walked up to him and Luna let go of his hand while Neville held on.
Neville's POV:
"Not the time!" Blaise stands up and rushes out of the hospital wing leaving Draco to himself.
Draco's POV:
He does just that and is relieved to notice the broom slow down. Blaise slows down beside him.
As if his body finally got a mind of its own, he rushed over to Harry's bed and began to shake him awake.
"There was something else... I'm curious!" Harry says genuinely. Maybe if Draco shows him his arm he can compliment Draco and make him feel more confident? Even if the picture is traumatic for him. Then again, he didn't want to be treated like charity. Not that Harry was doing it for 'charity'.
Draco takes a deep breath and opens the door. He attempts to appear like everything is fine, yet Harry narrows his eyes at him.
"Harry... I uh, I think he needs to calm down before we take him anywhere. It might be bad for him if anyone sees him." Blaise says.
He was happy to be at the Burrow for Christmas instead of with the Dursley's, but Ginny kept sneaking glances at him and freaking him out. Not to mention the terrible nightmares that won't go away. However, some of them now involve Draco. It's either Draco getting hurt or dying, or Draco killing or hurting him or his friends.
How crazy was she?! Neville didn't even act like he had feelings for Blaise and he never will act that way. She seriously had a problem, he knew that for sure.
"No!"
"No. Blaise, seriously, I can't." Neville says.
"What in the world are you grinning about?" Draco asks.
"It doesn't matter anyways." Blaise sighs, "But hey, at least I can show how I feel before I dump it all away. I don't know who I'd love after this though."
"Oh! Now grab the scooper and first put the wax paper onto the cookie sheet! Anyways, why?!" Hunter asked.
"Are you alright?" He whispers.
"Not as sad as you accidentally proclaiming your love to Potter and ending up here because he thinks you're crazy," Blaise says, popping in another bean. "Ugh, ear wax!"
Harry interlocks their fingers and gives him a warm smile. "That's great! Would you want to keep it secret for a while until we get comfortable or..."
Harry rushed into the hospital wing.
"Really? Are you sure you didn't see it wrong?" His grandmother asks with an eyebrow raised.
"Thank you. Keep him safe please. And no, no Blaise. If he happens to show up I'll tell you." Augusta says.
"Now, Harry go on along, I want to speak to Draco." Draco's heart pounds as Dumbledore finishes his sentence. Harry gets up promptly and almost leaves running. "Well Draco, I've never talked to you before. Would you like a cup of tea?" Dumbledore asks.
Unless...
"Get to class! You don't want to be late." Professor McGonagall says, walking quickly past them. "Quickly!" She says right before she turns the corner.
"Blaise, come help hold him up." Harry says, putting Draco's arm over his shoulder. Blaise does the same with his other side and they start to walk him over towards the exit.
"What thoughts make you do this?" Harry asks him.
"Yes, Neville?" Hannah asks, a smile growing on her face and her cheeks turning a light pink.
"Hi... Uh, why are there two broomsticks?" Neville asked.
Draco rolls his eyes at her annoying voice. "Yeah me neither, we get it it's terrible. Can I enjoy lunch without being reminded of it?! Thank you." Draco finishes with a fake smile.
"I don't think I can mix it." Blaise says.
Instead, Blaise rolled his eyes and grabbed his things along with Neville's. Without another word, he began to walk out the door, only to be stopped by a spell swirling towards him.
"H-harry..." Neville says softly.
He sighs and places the letter onto his desk. He should've known it was stupid to try and guess. Great job, Blaise! You idiot! He plops onto the bed, just to be asked a few minutes later to lunch with Luna and her father.
"Hey, Draco!" Harry snapped his head over to see Blaise Zabini sporting a cheeky smile.
Without thinking, Draco whispers, "Kiss me,"
"What?! It's not like I was just going to sit there and let us drift apart... I couldn't." Neville says.
Draco laid on his bed pretending to read, however, he was simply trying to avoid Potter's conversations. Mainly conversations about what just happened and how he, being the weakling he is, fears his own father and Voldemort. What a bloody joke. He might as well told Harry all his secrets!
"Definitely. We'll always make sure you get the help and love you deserve. That's a promise." Harry says.
"Nothing? What do you mean?" Blaise asks awkwardly.
"No absolutely not! I'll... break something! Or fall or... I dunno. I can't fly!" Neville says.
"Please tell me. I'll do anything." Harry says.
Blaise looks at him in silence before saying, "Are you alright, mate?"
Neville furrows his brows at him. They suddenly hear a scream and both rush to the noise.
Blaise's POV:
Neville chuckles and rests his head on Blaise's shoulder. They sway together in the moonlight. He loved how he felt in Blaise's arms. He never wanted to let go. Suddenly, a thought enters his head. But no... that can't be right. But when he said it in his head it did feel right.
Madame Pomfrey gasps as well, "I must speak to him. Be right back." With that, she speeded out of the infirmary, leaving Draco all alone to plan his revenge on Blaise.
For a while, it felt to him as if he was laughing with his family. What he failed to realize was that this is his family after all and will be until the day he dies.
"We must change that. Clearly, he is not a good candidate for you."
He heard voices. From who, he didn't know. He made his way up the steps as saw Dumbledore standing there alone, looking at the sky.
"A secret. I'm sorry if that upsets you but... If my father found out I'd..."
Blaise's POV:
He suddenly looks up to notice the once dead-end now has a grand door staring him down. Logic had told him to not open the door, yet something so powerful continued to pull him towards the handle.
"Who are we talking about here?" Harry asks.
"Those are for you." Blaise says with a smile.
Suddenly, Neville's face pops into his head. A bright smile etched onto his face. Him holding Neville and watching him blush in front of Blaise. Them going to Honeydukes together and seeing Neville's face light up at the sight of it.
"What? You were what, Draco?! Afraid?! You know how ridiculous you sound?! How weak you sound?! You didn't even try to control how you spoke! You embarrassed me and your mother. How dare you?!" He whispers.
"Neville!" Hannah almost shouts, snapping him out of his trance. "What's wrong with you?"
Veronica giggles, "It's so embarrassing. Apparently your ways of making him think you want to be friends with him are working. He told Xavier how worried he is that you're lying to him and that all he wants is to have a real friend like Blaisey." Veronica mocked. "Honestly, if that's how he thinks, I bet we can make everyone think he has a crush on you."
Draco simply nods and continues to stare at the table. He then feels that odd feeling of being watched again. He slowly turns around, only to realize he was simply being paranoid. Until...
"I need a hug." He says, tears falling from his eyes. Harry lets go of Draco's hands and Blaise pulls him into a hug.
Blaise gives him a sideways glance, "It's Neville, and how would I be able to fix that?!"
Draco blushes heavily. This is terribly awkward. "Uh... Yeah." Draco laughs awkwardly.
"Hurry." He says, walking ahead of them and leading them towards their new quarters.
Crabbe and Goyle convinced him to run after Harry. They both had decided not to fight but came back to help him duel Harry and get his wand back. Not like it would help him feel safer or more confident about it at all. He felt like a monster. But what was the point? He didn't have much to live for anyways.
- Hermione: Otter (happiest memory: moments with Ron and Harry)
"Dumbledore? Professor McGonagall? Anyone at all." Harry says.
"That's final, Mister Potter." She says sternly. "In fact, your belongings have already been moved to your room."
"I understand. I, too, dislike myself very much." Moaning Myrtle says, her voice echoing off the walls.
"I don't know." Neville sighs once again.
"What do you want, Pansy?" He snaps.
"Get up, Crabbe. Let's go." Draco says, grabbing Crabbe's hand and helping him up. "I have to find Blaise."
"I... I am!" Neville says with a soft giggle. The broom dips down and he gasps. He tightens his grip on the broom and tips it up slowly and finds himself back in his spot and in control of the broom. "I did it!" He says, "Yeah!"
"I don't know..." Instinctively, he squeezes Blaise's hand. He warmth of his skin felt nice on his. Without meaning to, he says, "You're warm."
Shortly after the book, Draco does get counseling along with Harry and they both overcome their mental health struggles and Draco never harms himself again.
Neville jumps up and hugs her tight. She squeaks in surprise. "Thank you!" He shouts with a bright smile on his face.
"You know, you should open that. It may be from Neville." She smirks, "By the way, we're making cookies later after breakfast. I'll bring you some. And no negotiation! You can't get out of these."
All he does is stand there, staring at her. "Get out!" She screams, her voice nearly shaking the walls.
"As a date?!" Draco whispers back, a smile slowly creeping on his face.
"Don't do that guys!" He scolds.
"But it's almost Christmas... I'll ruin his holiday!"
He notices Neville's eyes grow wide at something behind him. He turns around and notices a dementor coming right for them.
"Don't worry. Even if you do, that'll only prove how much heart you have." Harry says with a smile. "Come on," Harry says, grabbing his hand and leading him back inside.
"Maybe if I wasn't such a pretentious prat." Draco chuckles.
"Yes, but it's not his doing! None of this is his doing. He's just a good person who needed a home. He fought them, you know." Luna says and her father rolls his eyes.
"Traitor?" Draco asks.
Blaise walks down the hall, trying to find where Neville was. The Hufflepuff said he went this way, Hufflepuff's don't lie, right? Surely he was right. But, that didn't make him feel any better. Far down the hall he watched as Hannah Abbott and his one true love hold hands while Hannah lays her head on his shoulder. First he felt nothing, then a wave of sadness washed over him. He can't cry, especially not in front of Neville. Not in front of anyone! Slytherin's don't cry.
Draco sits there in silence, his mind too occupied with what just happened to realize that Harry took his wand with him.
"Don't pity me, Potter. I'm fine." Draco stated with an eye roll.
"I'm sorry... H-Harry..." Draco finishes nervously.
"Great! See you there!" Ginny says happily and skips away.
Draco couldn't help but feel shocked. What in the hell did Blaise just do?! The whole class seemed to feel the same, especially the Slytherins.
He felt silly, but he needed someone to talk to. With his quill in hand and parchment on his desk, he wrote to the mysterious gift-giver.
"None of your business..." She stays silent for a while, "Ok, it's Draco." She blurts.
"Nothing! What? No I meant uh... They wanted you to come hang out with us." Harry says and shouts at himself silently. Even if it was true, Draco wouldn't want to considering everything he said to Myrtle!
"Uh, what-"
"Draco, say it like you mean it," Dumbledore says with a smile.
Blaise gives him a sideways glance. "I'm sorry if this makes things weird..."
"Yeah... Uh, well my partner left his stuff in class and didn't come back so I thought I'd help out." Neville grunts and drops the books on the floor.
"Well?!" His Aunt asks.
"Oh... hi Hannah..." He responded.
He feels suddenly comforted by the familiar office.
"Don't feel bad! You did a perfect patronus before. You have power, I know you do!" Blaise encourages.
The Fat Lady looked at him in fear. Suddenly the entrance opened and he rushed in.
He slowly opened the door, knocking to make sure he didn't walk in while Harry was naked.
Then, in Defense Against the Dark Arts, nothing seemed to change. Goyle still looked like he was ready to kill Neville Longbottom. Draco didn't care, but Harry seemed too invested in it to pay attention to the class.
"You dare to take a witch's wand?! You dare to defy your masters?!" Bellatrix shouts.
Blaise stares after her in wonder. Damn Ravenclaws. They're the only ones that could be a match for Slytherins. It's like they know everything. It was damn horrific.
"Keep it down!" He whispers, "And no, I don't like blokes."
"I totally am! See, me and my family always go..." The sight of dark skin and dark clothes catch his eye and make him tune Hannah out completely.
"I suppose whenever we make the move. However, Draco is in the hospital wing. There's no way I could get it now. But maybe you could get your chance tomorrow?"
After many hallways and staircases, they stopped in front of the infirmary. Blaise slammed the doors open just like he did the classroom doors and dragged Neville inside.
"No! Absolutely not." Blaise says.
He lays down, slides his new bracelet on his wrist and curls up into his soft brown blanket. It was paradise, yet he could only think about this person more and more. He decided to guess what they might look like. He guessed dark skin, short hair with tight curls, maybe he was tall? He kept thinking of a familiar face, but who was it?
"Draco, what cologne do you wear?" Harry asks.
"I know... but you live here, so that makes you my master. Anywho, I am here to bring you some warm food." Maggie says, holding out a steaming plate of chocolate cake. "I made this today, specially for you."
"Is everything ok?" Blaise asks.
"Night, Luna." He silently walks up the steps as he stares down at his feet. Well, at least he was getting cookies.
A woman in dark blue velvet robes grabs his arm and pulls him out the door. He sits there alone with the woman in disbelief, but overall happiness.
"Good Merlin, fine!" Blaise sighs and leans in to whisper, "I hugged Neville... And we went to Honeydukes together."
"Oh no! Neville that was supposed to come way later!" Blaise shouts. Suddenly, the cauldron explodes and the potion sprays all over the classroom. Luckily for them, the potion had no effect. However, they were all covered in smelly potion ingredients and so was their books.
"Impossible!" Neville giggles.
Everything seemed great for everyone... but there was only one problem. Harry had brought to his attention that Draco was having issues. He was harming himself!
"I just wanted a good laugh. I don't care too much for dating him anymore." Pansy says, grabbing a nearby book.
Blaise suddenly walks out with a sneer painted on his face and is followed by Draco. Maybe Blaise hates him now?
"Come on, Draco. Get them, now." His Aunt demands. He grabs them without a second thought, doing his best not to look at Harry. His Aunt giggles. He watches as Harry's swollen eye returns to normal. "Well, well... Look what we have here. Harry Potter all shiny and new. Just in time for the Dark Lord... Call him." She demands. Draco glances around, not wanting to be the one to do it. "Call him!" She shouts.
Draco looks at the paper Blaise was holding earlier and notices it's a receipt. "It says you bought nine of them!"
"Yeah?" Draco replied, still staring blankly at the letters on the page.
Blaise sighs, "Promise not to laugh?"
Blaise shots up from his chair and rushes towards him, but Neville steps away, avoiding Blaise's touch.
Draco drops everything he is doing. "What happened?! What did she do?"
"Yes."
"That's pretty sad." Draco jokes.
"Hi, it's Neville. Thank you for the Christmas Present. I really enjoyed it and the blanket really helps, as does everything else. By the way, where did you find that bracelet? It's really nice. As for your feelings, I've talked to my friend Luna about it and she says they're real and she also says you're a boy. If you're wondering how I feel about that, I'm ok with it. I'm also ok with you giving me a present. You seem like a really nice person, maybe we could be friends? If not, that's ok I just needed you to know that I am very grateful. Those cookies were delicious. I assumed you were Hunter Bruton from Hufflepuff, but Luna assured me that I was wrong about that. Maybe you're a Hufflepuff? I really wish I knew who you were. I may not feel the same, but I'd love to talk to you in person at least once. Regardless, thank you for everything, especially the letter. It did make me feel special."
"I uh... I was looking for... for you." Harry says awkwardly. "Well... not me looking for you. Blaise was looking for you... And Ginny... And Ron... And everyone else..." He says quickly.
"Yet you sit there and talk to me like I'm some scared toddler," Draco remarked.
Draco nods in response then the room goes silent once more. Draco debates in his head for a while on whether to ask the question, then he finally decides it would help. "What's wrong?"
"Yeah, I am. Why do you ask?" Blaise questions?
"Here comes the little Weasel to save his boyfriend." Draco teases.
"Well, I'm sorry about... Yesterday. You didn't do anything I was just... Not having a good day. I shouldn't have taken it out on you. I always do and it's wrong." He says looking right into his eyes. It made him nervous, but he needed him to know he was genuine.

"Sit wherever you want," Blaise says, gesturing to the blanket. Neville slides his shoes off his feet, showing off his clean socks and sitting down on the blanket.
"No you aren't. This has happened before. You like someone other than Ginny, don't you?" Hermione asks.
"Go away!"
"I will!" says Pansy Parkinson, stepping up towards the front of the classroom happily.
"Yes, yes I'm fine." He gulps. Seriously, what the bloody hell was wrong with him?
"No! Eww, never in a million years!" Draco shouts.
"You're wondering what he said? Well... I don't think I could tell you... You might be upset."
"Yes. Bargyles swarm this person, especially when he is around you. Seemingly, you make him a better person." Luna says.
"Of course, Misses Malfoy." Blaise responds.
"Really?" Draco says, standing up and grabbing his wand, "Leave or I'll hex you."
"I'm sorry." He apologized, looking up to see that he was much more familiar. He was face to face with Blaise Zabini once more.
"What?!" Draco shouts back. "What do you want now?!" He couldn't stop himself, he had to shout or else he'd give all his secrets away.
"Uh... Just a few things." Neville's face turned red.
"No problem, please sit." She says, gesturing to the chair in front of her. He takes it and leans over to her.
His head was spinning. He almost relaxed and let his mind take him away, but the logic in his brain kept screaming at him that this was wrong. He began to wheeze. Oh where did he put that bracelet?!
"Let me tell you a story. When I was fifteen, I dated a boy named Rufus. He went to Durmstrang. But, when my mum and dad found out, they shouted and lectured me for a good few hours because they thought all students at Durmstrang were dark wizards. They were wrong... He was the sweetest boy I had ever met. He would help out anyone and everyone that needed it without a second of hesitation. But, because my parents didn't believe that, I wasn't able to see him anymore. And I didn't... Not for a few months at least. Until I decided to do exactly what you have been doing. I snuck out to see him, but I got caught... You wanna know why I did that, though?"
"No way! Just, try to explain how you feel. Maybe even tell him you like him." Draco suggests.
"Regardless, Slytherin's don't do that. If anything that's what Hufflepuff's do."
He falls onto his bed afterward, feeling exhausted. Tomorrow he has to get the dark mark. This is it.
Draco groans, "Answer the bloody question!"
"It's-" His face burned at the squeak he made. He clears his throat softly then whispers, "It's fine, I d-don't need a thanks."
"I'll be fine." He says, picking up the books and finally being smart enough to put them into the school bag. "See! Problem solved." He says, putting the bag over his shoulder. It was actually quite heavy now.
They stood there and watched as Voldemort threw spells left and right at Harry, only to have them be missed. Slowly, the cowardly death eaters began to file out.
"You passed out in the Ministry." Harry says.
However, he couldn't help but feel somewhat angry when he saw Draco take Blaise out of the Great Hall. But, once again, he feels nothing for Draco and both him and Blaise are perfect for each other. So... what was the big deal?
Draco simply continued to stare. Why couldn't he stop?
"Well, I'm glad. I should be thanking you, you know. I could've been starving without you." He smiles at him.
"Y-yeah... me too." Neville smiles back crookedly.
Draco blushes, "What?! No! I... You just s-sc-screamed really loudly..." Now he was stuttering?! Good Merlin.
"I can't believe him! How insulting! I'd never lay a finger on Neville!" Blaise shouts.
"I don't know... Not long ago. But I did once hit myself to stop myself from crying after father hit me... I didn't do it again though until this week. It's been making everything shockingly easier." Draco says. "Now will you let go of my bloody hand?"
"Well, it's time for dinner. Wanna come with me?" Blaise asks.
Neville cocked his head at the Professor, but all he does is pour a cup of tea.
"You don't owe anyone anything, let alone the Gryffindors. The only person that needs to know about this is you and the only person that has the right to tell you what to do is yourself."
Neville smiles wide and writes once again.
"Neville... I must ask," Luna says, stepping towards him, "Has Blaise Zabini been here?"
Side-note: I did write this on wattpad before I got an account on here. My username there is @azorafreakingsmokes I don't write much fanfictions there but more of my work is there. Thanks to anyone reading here though! Seeing people interacting and liking my stories makes me day all the time. To be honest, I might make a switch here. Probably because I read an amazing Richie and Eddie story. One more chapter to go though with extra information on the characters (my headcanons of course along with a couple of actual canon things).
Harry is silent for a while and then Draco feels a warm hand reach his cheek.
He sighs happily and almost skips towards the dungeons.
Draco's POV:
"W-well... I wanted to! And I do what I want..." Blaise said nervously.
"No, my lord. I promise. I will get it done as soon as possible." Draco says quickly, proud at his lack of stuttering this time.
Pansy's POV:
"Malfoy?" He heard a familiar squeaky voice ask.
"But-"
"What about Blaise? Where is his apology?" Draco asks, folding his arms across his chest.
"I feel alright." Draco replies, paying close attention to how he is eating.
"Then he just stopped talking to me. I don't know why." Harry says. Pansy holds back a laugh. He is such a terrible liar.
Draco knew what was coming soon. Harry was about to be seventeen, which means he had to kill Dumbledore fast, or the Dark Lord's plans would be ruined. If his plans are ruined, that means he'll either die or be tortured for the rest of his life. Or perhaps both.
"He's not just a boy!" Blaise says, his brows furrowed in anger.
"Wow. A lot has been going on for you, huh?"
"I'm not that great. I'm just like everyone else." Harry says.
"No worries. He's just trying to keep you safe. I'd do the same." He smiles back.
Both Voldemort and his father looked over at the person. The boggart shifted, turning into a dementor. But... The only person whose boggart was a dementor-
"Yes I was! I was arrogant and mean to everyone. But why? It's not like I'm special or perfect enough to act like that. Father was right, I am girly and whiney. I am weak! Why can't I just look and act like a normal, perfect person?!"
He looked at the page and saw the words: Dreamless Sleep Potion.
He groans in pleasure and snakes his arm around Harry's waist. He could feel Harry smile against his lips.
"Wait! Did you tell Blaise what happened when we started talking about him?" Veronica asks.
Madame Pomfrey, sadly enough, healed him quickly and he was able to go home that day for the holidays. Snape even told him he didn't have a choice and that he had to finish his assignment after his father had a chat with him. Whenever his father wanted to "chat" it was never good. He was frightened but forced himself to forget about it. If he wanted to survive it all, he couldn't show or feel fear. It simply wasn't an option.
"Oh, by the way I apologize for my father's prejudice. He just hasn't met you yet. I'm sure if he did he'd love you." She smiles.
He walks off without another word. He locks himself in his bedroom and lets the tears flow out. He cries and cries with his blanket over his head. He holds it tight to himself, worrying if this will be one of the only things he'll have left of Blaise.
"Says the girl who eats like a troll whenever the cupcakes come out." George says with a playful scowl.
"Great things take time, you wanker." Pansy replies.
"Because apparently he thinks I did something bad... Or he just wants glory. That's all every Gryffindor wants."
Neville's POV:
Blaise seemed just as shocked as him. "I'm sorry." He says back. However, he doesn't move from his spot.
Harry looks back at Draco with a glare. "What's your damn problem, Malfoy?!" Harry retorts.
"So?" Blaise asks.
"Thank you. You are all so kind." His mother says with a smile. He nearly rolls his eyes. Why would he need to be looked after? He isn't a baby. Besides, he may be hungry but, really? Three times a day? It's not like he hasn't been eating at all. Well, if you don't count the times during the war. But, she's seen him eat! What's the big deal?
He took shaky deep breaths, trying to calm himself down as Snape continued his lesson.
"Does this mean... You're gay?" He mutters. Draco simply stares at the blanket. "Well... I-if you are that's ok..."
"B-but you're holding me." Neville blushes.
"No one can harm you, Myrtle. You can hide away easily and not have to worry about your own father killing you for not being perfect in front of company. Or maybe worse, beating you brutally! You have an easy life if we're being logical here." Draco replies with a scowl.
Why does he care?! Neville nods in return then covers the left side of his cheek with his hand at an attempt to hide his blush from Blaise.
"Oh... Yeah, I remember now." Draco says.
"What?!" Did his grandma send a gift early? No, that didn't make sense, he was going home for the holidays. He steps to the tree and looks under it. Surely enough, a single present was laying there. It was quite large, mainly in length but a bit in width. It was wrapped in gold wrapping paper and tied together in a bow with a black ribbon. A note lays under the ribbon and written in a neat cursive hand writing.
"Y-you... You noticed?" Neville asks, slowly smiling.
Draco drops his gaze to the floor and opens his mouth to speak, but Greyback speaks instead.
"N-no. I'm fine." Neville says, taking a deep breath and walking towards Hannah.
For whatever reason, as soon as he saw one of them carrying a box of Every Flavor Beans, an imagine of Blaise Zabini popped into his head and stayed there, as if there was some magnetic force connect his very brain to the imagine of him.
"Hurry!" Harry shouts, running away from him and up the steps.
"What do you-"
Blaise gets on his broom and kicks off the ground. He flaats off the ground and stays there.
Of course, it was only because Neville needed a friend, but Blaise could dream. Oh, Merlin, could he dream.
"But he could-"
He stands up and tries to run away, but is kicked down by his father. He glances back at him when he is halfway up, but it was a big mistake. His father takes his cane and pushes it into his back, pulling him back down to the ground and definitely leaving a bruise.
He looks over, noticing Goyle grabbing a chair, only to fall right into the flames. His heart stops, but he has no time to waste. He continues to climb along with Crabbe. He slips, but quickly grabs back onto a metal bar.
"Everyone except Longbottom, get out." Snape demands.
"Mister Goyle!" McGonagall shouted. "What in the world do you think you're doing?!"
Neville's POV:
"What?! Why?" Ron asks and his eyes widen, "What if he's planning to kill Neville?"
Neville reaches over and grabs it back, "I think I'd rather keep the letter private, just in case." He says.
"Fine, what?"
"I really don't think you should go home. Maybe we can tell Dumble-"
Blaise looks at him with wide eyes before smirking at him. "Didn't expect that."
"Very well, boys. This here is a perfect amortentia." Snape says. "Twenty points to Slytherin."
"No, grandmum. Really! He's had feelings for me for a long time and-"
He kept replaying in his mind what Harry said. He really thought Slytherin's were all that bad? Is Draco just some demon from hell to Harry?
Draco blushes. "What the hell, Potter?!" He physically shudders. "What the hell?!"
"I love it!" Neville smiles brightly. The small beady eyes of the toad almost making him giggle.
"Ask away." Dumbledore says, putting down his quill and linking his hands together under his chin.
He opened it up and smiled.
Draco's eyes go wide. His father must have told Snape to look after him and make sure he does as he is told. Draco says, "I'm sorry! I just got distracted by homework and... other things."
Hermione sighs angrily, "Fine. Don't tell me what is truly bothering you."
"You can! You're strong, we know you are. Try talking to us about it." Harry says calmly.
Then, he realized: They switched partners.
"Oh, good." Draco says. He hears the clanking of heels getting closer and closer. Coming towards them was his mother.
He watches a few tears fall from Blaise's eyes. "You love me?"
He's silent. His mother grinds her teeth. "You're just like your father. A drunk! A dark wizard! I hate you!" She screams. "I hate you! You know what, get the bloody hell out of my house!"
"I'm sorry I just-"
"Sure is! But... one more thing." Blaise says, grabbing his wand and holding out his hand in the air. "Accio picnic basket."
"Oh! I didn't mean to interrupt." Luna says, trying to hide the smirk on her face. "I just came to tell you that lunch was ready. It might be a bit uncomfortable sitting on the floor, but it's still the same food." Luna says.
Blaise suddenly drops his face down to the ground before looking back up at him, "Perhaps... Longbottom?" He asks with a smile.
He sends off the letter once more and soon gets one back.
"Blaise, what a surprise!" Dumbledore smiles up at him. "What is your concern?"
Hannah furrows her brows at him then continues to eat. Neville, however, just sits there and allows the image to burn into his brain. Oddly enough, it didn't bother him.
"Yeah." Blaise chuckles nervously.
"No, I'm ok," Neville says.
"Right..." Draco stands up, putting his bag over his shoulder, and grabs his things, leaving the classroom as soon as he could. If he keeps acting like this, people will know. He has to be stronger than this. He could hide everything else, why can't he hide this better?!
"Whatever." Neville says playfully.
"No it isn't! You should've seen his face. People constantly make remarks at him and he just seemed completely out of it. He didn't talk once or look at me. Well... maybe he did once but, he didn't speak at all. I'm still worried." Blaise exhales and places his chin into his hand.
Isn't his life amazing?
"Really, nothing upset me... The toast was all-" Draco stops talking as his voice cracks.
Neville's breathing gets heavier and more rapid. Without another word, Blaise grabs Neville and drags him out of the classroom. Neville could feel the eyes on him. It only made things worse.
"Well, I'm sure we'd all love to hear what you have to say." Voldemort replies.
"He's still alive!" Harry informs.
"Painful." Draco says emotionlessly.
"No, I didn't mean it that way! I just wanted you to have something nice. Think of it as a way of asking..." Blaise gulped, "I-if we could b-be friends." He wanted to smack himself on the head. He was more confident than this yet Neville made him a fumbling idiot.
"I'm telling the truth! Look, I'll prove it to you. Next time Blaise is here I'll say it just so you'll see his reaction." Draco says.
And so Harry screamed and screamed. Draco began to breathe shakily. All of this was so overwhelming. What the hell was happening?
Day's like these were drinking days for Blaise. Well, any day at home was a drinking day, but especially today. It all started last night, but he didn't expect that run in with Neville to trigger anything in him. But as soon as his body touched Neville, his whole mood shifted. He worried Neville was afraid of him because of the way he acted and the intense thoughts and emotions he had that night drove him so crazy that he was thankful that he bought lots of firewhiskey.
"Yeah." Neville says, stretching out his back. "So... this is the place?" Neville asks, taking in the picture of the flowers beside the lake.
He turns to the gargoyle once more. "Uh... Sherbet lemon?" The gargoyle turns around to reveal a stunning spiral staircase. "Woah..." He reluctantly climbs up the steps and soon is met with a large room.
Draco looks at him, his tough act completely dissolved. "I suppose you're right." He sighs once more and says, "What about your family, Potter? What are they like?"
"Oh yeah. That's rough, friend. Scoop out parts of the dough and put it on the sheet! Anyways, what if he finds out who you are? Won't it be awkward, especially with the Gryffindor and Slytherin rivalry?"
Neville cowered in fear. This was the end.
"If it makes you feel better, I will be the one to help this person. But, I can't tell you who it is. That would be betrayal. I'm sorry."
"Well, let's go then. I suspect his followers will be here soon." McGonagall says, strutting out the door and into the silent hallways.
He feels himself falling asleep and before he knows it, he opens his eyes once more to see millions of stars in the sky above them.
"Huh," Draco got up and sat down beside Harry. He looked over his shoulder to look at the page, noticing it was transfiguration. He looked over to see that Harry's book from before had turned to ashes. "Oh, I see. Look, all you gotta do is..." Draco picked up his wand and reached over to grab a quill to experiment on. He waved his wand gracefully, watching as the quill turned into a dove. He then smiled and looked over at Harry. Their eyes met and Draco gulped. They were way too close.
Blaise gives him a look of shock and worry, "Uh, what happened?"
"No worries. I understand. How are you and Neville?" Draco asks.
He was terrified, though. Terrified that Draco was in trouble, terrified that Neville would die or be horribly injured, and most of all he was terrified of you-know-who taking over. If anyone knew where his loyalities lied as a pure-blood Slytherin, he would be dead within minutes of his reign. Then again, if Neville died, would it really matter if he did as well?
"I was concentrating!" The fat lady says, her pitch so high it nearly broke your ears.
He takes off the bracelet and rushes into the next room. "Hi." He says as he sees Hannah.
"I know what you're thinking about..." Myrtle says, "I know because last time you looked just like this."
He hears the door open but stares straight ahead.
"Take it. It's the least I can do. You've been so respectful and you deserve it!" Dumbledore pushes it into Blaise's hand and leans back into his chair. "Now, get to the Great Hall. It's almost lunch time!"
He rushes to the shed, opens it up, and pulls out his grandmother's broom. It had dust and cobwebs on it, but he just brushed them away and and steps onto the broom.
"Just answer me!" Blaise cries urgently.
"Trust me, he wouldn't even think about that." Luna assures, but Ron simply looks at her like he's crazy. Harry can only hope she's correct. Even if Blaise had proved his intentions before, he knows Slytherins can easily manipulate. I mean, look at Draco. He played him like he was a game of Wizard's Chess.
"I just... I don't... I don't believe we are working out. It's awkward and well, I just don't think we have good chemistry. I'm sorry. I gotta go." She says, leaving him without another word.
"Just wanted to say hello," Harry says.
He looks at her and sneers, "What are you on about?"
"Ya know, you two canoodling in the stairwell," Seamus says with a smirk.
"Not even Hannah Abbott?" Fred teases with a smug smile.
They all rush towards her. Draco felt awkward having any physical contact with Hermione, but he still grabbed onto her jacket.
Draco's POV:
Blaise chuckles, "Thanks, Draco."
Draco reaches towards them both and hugs them close. They talked for a couple more minutes and then they both walked him to the Great Hall where many different people would talk to Draco.
"No! You were both busy and I'd just be... a burden!" Draco sobs.
He sighs sadly and closes up the letter. He wishes he could help this person, but without knowing who they were made that impossible. So instead, he rushes out of the dorm and towards the Ravenclaw common room.
Meanwhile, his father's words also rang in his head. One's about how boys who like boys are sick, disgusting people that deserve to die with the "mudbloods." What if his father was able to get out of Azkaban and he had gotten together with Harry? He'd be dead for sure. That wouldn't be an exaggeration or a figure of speech, he would seriously be dead.
"Mr. Potter... What a delight." Snape says sarcastically.
He reached into his pocket, only to realize he had forgotten his bracelet. He began to panic, but the eyes he felt on him made him push it all down.
Blaise laughs, "No, never. I get it. I agree, I am pretty hot."
Harry stares at him in shock. "I... I'm sorry I didn't mean to upset you, Neville."
"No, anything you need to say to me you can say in front of them." He gestures to Luna and Blaise. Blaise is giving her a glare while Luna has the same calm composure she always seems to have while giving her a friendly smile.
"You're opening up to me, right? There's nothing wrong with that. In fact, I welcome it. The thing of it is... I'd have to disagree with you. I've seen you do magic before and you are completely capable. Your wand just seems to fight against you a lot, but that isn't your fault. Seamus Finnigan always blew things up, but he's still skilled at magic! A part of the problem can simply be your nerves. Whenever I was angry or nervous my magic would always be more hard to control... You're wearing that bracelet today so... Perhaps try a spell?" Blaise suggests.
"It was nice. I hope you find a guy much better than me soon. You deserve it." Harry says with a smile.
"It's not pity!" Harry shouted.
"Hi, Blaise!" He heard a soft voice say.
"Yes!" Blaise groans, "I need to know what Neville wants for Christmas!"
"How'd you do it, Draco?" His father says, a look of pride on his face.
The chaos of both his mother and her boyfriend's voices still rang through the house. He covers his ears and huffs angrily. He'll definitely have to buy some food on his own later. Or eat those crackers. He was just lucky that her boyfriend was irresponsible enough to let his galleons slip out of his pockets and into couches and left on counters. He was also glad he was dumb enough to not realize Blaise was taking it.
"You really think it's any of your business?! News flash, Potter, you don't need to know everything. Not everyone is your friend who will tell you their life story."
"I told someone..." Draco says.
"That reminds me! He also said how self-conscious he feels in potions because he can't measure things correctly and how worried he is about never finding a wife. How lame is that?"
He brushes it off for now and says he will ask a teacher. He grabs the bracelet from the pillow, puts it in his pocket, and walks away.
Harry holds his hands up, "No need. I'm not here to fight."
"So... The book said that we need to find you some healthy coping mechanisms. Some examples were to swim or exercise or even talk to someone. They also say that you need to recognise the triggers and make a plan to stop your self-harm before it starts. They also suggest distracting yourself, which could probably also tie in with a coping mechanism. I don't remember it all but I'm sure I can get the book and we can look through it."
"You're hopeless." Draco says, his eyes widening as he read on, "Are you trying to fatten him up?!"
Draco's face turns pale. No one is supposed to know about that. No one is supposed to know about his fantasies about men. No one is supposed to know he's a freak.
"That is pretty strange. Maybe if we weren't so stubborn maybe we could've been friends, you know."
"Draco!" shouts Crabbe and Goyle.
"How is he strict?" The man asks.
"Our new friends!" Everyone else says, clinking their glasses with his own and drinking from them.
"You walked into me you-- You're a pain in the arse, ya know?" Draco gives him a glare. "I try to make amends and you continue to be an insufferable spoiled little prat. Fuck you, Malfoy."
"Draco, believe it or not, I am your friend. You may not like me, hell I know you don't, but I promise I won't tell anyone what you tell me. I won't even say I saw you today. Now I want to help you so please tell me what the hell is wrong with you." Blaise begs. "Seriously, you're kinda scaring the daylights out of me."
"I can't." He blurts out.
"Go defend your man!" Draco whispers. Blaise rolls his eyes playfully and walks over to Pansy as Draco makes his way upstairs.
Draco steps out. "What is wrong with you?"
They both drop their wands with a clang to the floor.
"I'm a terrible person!" He sobs, "I called you a mudblood, I bullied everyone for years, and now everyone's acting like I deserve forgiveness?! Even bloody Ron Weasley is being nice to me... me! Blaise should hate me! I mean, I basically helped people try to kill the love of his life! Yet, he forgives me! They all forgive me... But why? Even you do! Why?!" Draco shouts.
"It's the least I could do. Didn't think you could, did you?" Blaise asks.
"Oh, what are you doing here, Neville?" She asks.
Everything is fine. He has never been and never will be attracted to Harry Potter, or any guy for that matter. He is a Malfoy! Malfoy's are not gay.
Not to mention Draco and Harry finally got together! Even though they were keeping it secret, they still managed to look cute when they were together without even having to do "coupley-things".
Oh no, it's Blaise Zabini! Why is he always around?! He looks away, trying to hide his face.
He steps back into his closet and shuts the door. Maybe he can survive if he just stays right here forever.
He watched as Harry began fuming. Oddly enough, it made Draco very happy to see him this way.
He was at least relieved to know that people seemed to have forgotten about the embarrassing things he revealed to them under the truth potion, but then his nerves went all crazy for no reason at all.
Greyback grabs his arm and pulls him down the steps. Meanwhile he's trying his best not to freak out. Dumbledore just died... right in front of him. Professor Snape killed him!
"I'm still upset about that." Neville says with a sharp tone. "But hey, at least you're safe now." He looks at the ground and speaks again, "I need to tell you something else... That boy I was talking about in the letters... It was you." He rubs his neck and blushes again.
Harry smiled once more, but somehow differently. "Well... I apologize. Get some rest, I'll be fine."
"Ok." Arthur says, a mouth full of food.
"I'm still figuring that out. But I did find this really soft blanket that's pretty big, then herbology supplies and-"
His eyes at met with Hermione's. She's crying and a single word is carved into her skin, seeping out red: 'Mudblood'. His breath hitches.
He slept in his closet once again. What could he say? It felt much more safe then his actual bed. He never understood why, it's not like his father ever checked on him at night or at all. If he ever came up to his room it was because he did something wrong or something was needed of him.
Blaise gives Neville a sad look, to which he only stares at his desk, before walking away.
"It's normal to feel heartache. Don't feel so bad about it. You only felt jealousy because well... Neville's never dated literally anyone until now. Again, it's completely understandable why it's so hard for you." Draco says.
He begins to grab his stuff in a hurry, putting them all in his trunk. When his mother isn't looking, specifically holding her head in her hands and muttering bad things about him, he sneaks the bottles of firewhiskey in his trunk. Then closes it up and pushes past his mother.
Draco's POV:
He turned to Harry, who also seemed surprised.
He enters the classroom and sees four words written on the board ahead. 'Sit with your partners.' This day can't get any better! Draco strides over to where Harry was sitting, making his presence known by loudly moving his chair and speaking. "This will be exciting, huh Potter?" Draco smirks at his sarcasm.
Draco looks at Blaise, his arms still shaking violently. "Blaise."
He thought for a second. He didn't ever really care for the ball, other than being able to spend time with Neville. Well, evidently that was never going to happen. All he would have there was heartache from watching his true love and some girl fall in love right in front of him. Maybe even kiss. There was no way in Hades that he was going to that wretched ball.
Draco smirks at him, making him feel a strange swirling feeling in his stomach and shivers down his spine. He noticed the great contrast of Draco's skin and his lip color. His lips were pale pink whereas his skin was pale white. It was quite attractive, really. They looked so soft, his lips. However, so did his hair. He never noticed how silky it looked even without the gel.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Professor, i-it's ok," Neville spoke quietly.
Suddenly, much to his dismay, he begins to sob. Blaise grabs his arm and pulls him towards an empty classroom.
"Expelliarmus!" A girl shouts.
Blaise puts some on his fingers and rubs it onto Draco's wrist and neck. Draco looks at him like he is crazy, but he continues on.
Tomorrow was Christmas break and Draco was once again in the hospital wing and failed his first attempt at the assignment. He hasn't very hopeful for his trip back home.
"Hey, it's alright! Don't be ashamed."
Blaise leans in to kiss Neville once again, only to be interrupted by a soft voice.
Harry gulps. He didn't expect that question. "Uh..."
"Thanks..." Blaise whispers back, taking the bag from Neville's hands. Their fingers brush once more and Neville turns away at an attempt to not let these weird emotions show.
"G-gryffindor tower," Neville replies, staring down at the floor.
"You were, weren't you? Luna must be lucky."
"Oh, there you are!" Arthur says happily, "It's time for dessert!"
He sat in the second floor bathroom once more. He stared at the dark mark on his arm that now had bright red cuts all over it.
"I wonder who got this for you..." Seamus says.
"I should be disgusted! I keep having these thoughts about this one boy, but I shouldn't! He's basically off limits completely and it wouldn't work out anyways. We're most definitely complete opposites. Besides, I'm just some clumsy dork that got sorted into Gryffindor by some freak mistake. He'd never like me back. He wouldn't like Gryffindors at all! He might be able to trick you into thinking you could be his friend, but then he'd turn on you. But the worst part is, I can't get these thoughts out! I shouldn't like him at all. I should despise him! But every time I try to forget about him, these thoughts just get worse and worse. A part of me loves it, then another part hates myself for it. I mean, just imagine if he did like me back, what would the Gryffindors say?! They already think of me as a dork, but then they'd see me as a traitor. I can't do that. Now I guess you would know what house they are in. You might be dissapointed in me. I'm sorry for that. But I understand, I'm dissapointed in myself. It makes me feel like I'm betraying my entire house! Maybe even all of Hogwarts. I mean, he could be a supporter or you-know-who. Sorry for being such a downer and I'm sorry if I ruined every chance at friendship with you for saying this. But it does feel nice to get it off my chest."
Harry's POV:
He looks at the sky to see a basket flying its way over to them. Blaise catches it flawlessly and opens it up. He pulls out a blanket and lays it on the ground below them.
The hand reaches his hair and runs through it. Draco sighs in content.
The color drained from his face, "You wouldn't!" If his mother discovered that he helped a Gryffindor, not to mention a boy, he'd be living on the streets. Or, perhaps, in Hogwarts for the rest of his miserable life. On top of all that, he actually had feelings for that certain boy. Just thinking about him turned his insides to mush. The way he stumbles over his words and stumbles over his own feet is just beyond adorable to Blaise. He's intrigued him since third year. Now, if his mother knew that, he'd definitely not be living at home.
