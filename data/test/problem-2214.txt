“Scorpius went to one after his mother got sick.  I’ve got their details somewhere.  They’re based in Great Ormond Street Hospital and were very good.”
“I have to try.  It’ll nag at me if I don’t.”  They’d had this argument multiple times over the years.  Ron just wanted to forget all about Harry.  All he could think about was the betrayal.  Hermione still held on to the good memories.  Besides her curious nature didn’t like unsolved mysteries.  Despite their differing viewpoints, each of them felt the disappointment every time a lead came up blank.  For Hermione it made her more determined, whilst it made Ron surer that pretending Harry had never existed, was the right path.
“Where he grew up.  He didn’t like the place very much though, so I doubt it’s there.  The only other place I can think of is the place his family came from.  I think it was called little Hangleton.  I was there once, although I can’t say much about the place.  The graveyard was hardly much of an advertisement.  In the memories though there was the place where the Gaunts lived – they were his family on his mother’s side.  And he stayed in Riddle Manor for a while when he was waiting to be resurrected.  We could try there for the ring.”
“The Lord thing is just seats in the Wizangamot.  You know, like the house of lords, but for wizards.  It gives us some political clout – or has the potential to do so.  And being head of the family, or even heir to the head of the family, gives you certain control over blood wards, family estates and finances.  Weren’t you ever told?  I mean I know Hogwarts refuses to teach us anything about it, as most of its really only relevant for a handful of pureblood families – and heaven forbid they teach anything about blood magic, but I would have thought someone would have told you.  Given the Potter family is one of the few it’s relevant for.”
“It would be easier if I could produce one.  That way we wouldn’t have to risk it being recognised.”  Draco said, sounding small and sad.  Harry wrapped his arms around Draco a little tighter.
This kiss was less ferocious and more languid.  Draco leaning over to keep the rest of his body away from Harry’s. Despite every effort, Harry’s hands started to develop a mind of their own, finding Draco’s hips and pulling Draco back in towards him.  Harry knew before too long, they would be all over each other again, and it seem unlikely this time that Draco would be able to pull away.  Harry knew that he couldn’t.  Then there was a cough at the door and the two of them sprang apart. Angelina was stood there looking at them with a bemused smile.
“I don’t dance.”  Harry remembered his own miserable attempts at dancing at the Yule Ball with Parvati Patil.
“This number will be working for the next 5 days.  Message me and I’ll meet you.  If you need more time, email my publisher.  It might take a while to get to me, but I do actually read my fan mail these days.  Drink the potion.  It’s not poison.”
“That sounds lovely.  I don’t know how I’d manage without you.  My Son in Law and Daughter definitely made the right decision naming you as Godfather to their son.”
Harry shifted and sat more upright, no longer propped up on the pillows.  He put his arms around Draco before he could get up and leave the bed.
“Good, now we can get on with the much more pleasant activity of eating some fabulous food and you telling me all about how your Father’s are getting on.” Pansy said this with a wicked grin, eager for gossip.
“I’d like to see you do any better” Scorpius said.  Al picked up a stone, finding a smooth flat one before throwing it towards the lake.  It skipped 5 times before sinking.
“Lily, I know your mum and I separating is very upsetting for you.  I’m sure you noticed we didn’t seem very happy with each other over the summer.” Her Dad paused then, and Lily nodded acknowledging the statement.  Scorpius just sat still, his arm remaining round her shoulders, his thumb moving gently and reassuringly stroking her arm. Her Dad continued.  “This has nothing to do with how much we love you.  Your mum made a mistake because she was unhappy, and I wasn’t very available for her to talk to.  She isn’t having the baby to replace you, or James or Al.  You are all too important for that.  To both of us.  And your mother would have come to talk to you all today too, but her healer wouldn’t let her.  She’s waiting at home though, and Professor McGonagall has given you permission to go and spend the night at home so you can talk to her if that’s what you want.” Her Dad stopped again at that point, seeming to struggle to find more words.  She thought she noticed him keep looking towards the corner where the pillar with the writing on was, but she couldn’t be sure as it was behind her.  “Since your mum told me about what she’d done, I’ve done a lot of thinking, and have been talking to someone, a professional, about my feelings.  We’ve talked about all of this and about some of the things that were making me unhappy with mine and your mum’s relationship.  You were right when you said I had secrets too.  All people have secrets and it’s not necessarily a bad thing.  But sometimes keeping secrets can hurt you and the people you love. Do you understand baby girl?”
Harry sniffed loudly.  He wanted to speak to Blaise; before they went to the home they’d been living in together for the last eighteen months.  He felt Blaise lift him and he wrapped his legs around his waist, his arms clinging to the other man’s neck.  They started moving towards the floo.
“Do you think you’d be able to go with them Draco?”  Harry asked quietly.  “It will be a lot easier and quicker to find If you can take them straight to it.”
“Neither do I.  We can learn together.  We just do what feels good.  And if you want to stop or it’s too much you just tell me.  I want you Harry.”
“I think it happened at mine at New Year’s.  The kids know not to do magic at mine outside the holidays.”
Draco stepped into the bright and airy room, untouched by darkness.  There were neatly stacked piles of paperwork awaiting his attention on his desk, but when he sat down to try, he couldn’t keep hold of his thoughts long enough to attempt any of it.  Work was normally an effective distraction for calming him down, but his mind wasn’t letting him.  He rummaged through the top draw and pulled out his emergency pack of cigarettes and his lighter.   Lighting one and taking a deep drag, Draco closed his eyes.  He was better than this.  He was not going to let Potter do this to him.  It had been years since he had felt so close to the edge of a panic attack.  He hated feeling like this, he needed his control back.  He finished the cigarette, stubbing it out in the crystal ashtray sat on the desk.  He picked the lighter back up and lit it.  He stared at the flames for several minutes, watching as the metal heated up, before snapping it shut and extinguishing it, placing it back on the table in front of him.  Closing his eyes and taking a deep breath Draco made a decision.  He pushed up his sleeves and looked down at his arms and started counting the scars, touching each one as he went.  The scars were all old and faded.  He found touching them comforting somehow.  It was a trick he’d picked up years ago.  Sometimes concentrating on each mark and thinking about them was enough to bring some of the relief making them in the first place had brought, in a less destructive way.  He picked up a quill and dipped in the nearby pot of ink and started outlining each of the scars.  Bit by bit, the near panic he had felt since leaving Fortescue’s eased and Draco could think normally again.  It had been several years since he had had a panic attack or felt those urges as strongly as they had just been.  He was a grown man, not the anxiety ridden and traumatised youth he had been.  He could deal with Potter and his family without being sent into a spiral.
Al, Lily and their Dad left the robe shop shortly after to finish their shopping, whilst Scorpius was being fitted for new school and dress robes.  As soon as he was done, he rushed to the bookstore to meet his father.  There weren’t too many new books on the 5
Harry kissed Draco goodbye not long before lunchtime, and left the Manor feeling happier than he could have imagined possible, given everything that was going on in his life.  He’d owled Doris whilst they were sat eating breakfast together, explaining to Draco that he wanted to see her by himself before they arranged a session with her together.  He felt it was important for him to talk over everything that had happened in the last two days, and he’d missed the appointment that she’d left open for him yesterday whilst he was seeing Pansy.  In the past he’d always pushed talking to her aside when he was happy.  Although to be fair he also tried to avoid talking to her even when he wasn’t, even though he knew it helped.  Talking to Pansy, and then Draco, had made him realise that if he just rode the wave of joy he was currently feeling, eventually it would crash, and he’d end up back where he started.  Doris’s reply had come whilst he and Draco were walking around the Manor’s gardens, enjoying the beautiful early spring day.  She’d had an opening for that afternoon, which was why he was now flooing back to Grimmauld to get changed before he went to his session.
“We’re going to Tescos.  Don’t you think you’re being a little…”?  Harry tried to distract Draco, but knew as soon as he’d started, all he was doing was digging himself into a hole.
“Ummm…yeah.  I think technically it’s been mine since I was a baby.  It was in trust till I turned 17.  This is the first time I’ve been here though…had to wait for school to break up.”
“It was a mutual whisking away.  Could you imagine Draco being married to Tori? It would be a complete disaster.” Harry laughed.  “And you and her are perfect together.  Your wedding was beautiful. Hardly a dry in the house.  Everyone could tell how much in love the two of you were.  I just hope mine and Draco’s is the same.”
“Fine.  If that’s the only way I can have you then we can try.  I…just…please… Can you kiss me one last time?”  Harry couldn’t let the last time they kissed, be the last time.
Harry took a deep breath. “I think I’m going to celebrate my birthday with my friends and family.  We are all going to drink too much, because you won’t let us do it any other way.”
“No.  Lucius is still being held for questioning according to this.  No.  There was a Death Eater attack last night…”  Remus stopped seeing Harry’s face go white.  Harry had realised they had overlooked someone else they could have saved.  Someone who was also going to grow up without loving parents.
“None taken.  And from what I can tell, he absolutely was a spoiled rich kid.  But… I always thought I’d be able to protect Draco from Lucius’ temper.  Hide the things he does…did… to me.  From what Draco says, he always knew.  When he came to the Manor, to get me and little Draco, he showed me his left arm and told me in no uncertain terms what the future would hold for little Draco if I didn’t get him out of there.”
The kitten really wasn’t being very helpful, much like the human Malfoy.  Harry picked the kitten up, and it snuggled into his arms.  It was quite cute really, if he didn’t think about who it really was. Shaking those thoughts from his head quickly he turned from the room, holding the small bundle of fur.
Draco spoke again.  “I don’t think you should break up with her.”  It wasn’t what Harry expected to hear.  “Don’t misunderstand me.  I do not want you to be with her.  If I could have my way, she’d be out of your life completely.  And I seriously do not want to even think about you and her having sex.  If you break up with her, however, it will raise suspicions. Especially with
“Well you can put up.” Draco replied, snootily.  Something about the way Draco said it grated on Harry’s nerves.
Harry stroked Draco’s soft hair.  The other boy was warm in his arms.  He couldn’t believe it had only been just over a week since he’d found Draco crying in the bathroom in Hogwarts.  Now he was here in a house with his godfather and Draco’s mother, little Harry and Draco, and of course his Draco.
‘Don’t say it.  You can and you will.  I will not let you sacrifice yourself for me.  You’ve sacrificed too much of yourself for me already.  I can’t let you do it again.  I love you too much to let you do that.  If you try, I will say you’re lying.’
“No.  I don’t think she even knew about Blaise before he wrote.  Not quite sure how we’re going to deal with that.  But I don’t think we’ll make it through the day without Draco’s magic going wonky at least once, so I can’t not be there, even if I wanted to stay away.  It’s also why we can’t use a muggle funeral director, although we did discuss it.”
“I know.  I read in the papers it was bad, but I never know how much to believe from them.  They exaggerate too much.  I don’t think you should tell Draco how bad it really was.”
“Harry you haven’t listened to a single thing I’ve said all afternoon, then you just stand up and try and leave.  What the hell is going on?”
“No, just George.  Don’t blame him for not telling you, we begged him not to.  And we would have told you ourselves without his prompting soon anyway.  I’m pregnant.”
“No.  You don’t love me like that.  I’ve found someone who does.  And I love him too.  It’s better this way I think.”
“Hey mum” Al said bounding down the stairs, the toothbrush still in his mouth muffling his words slightly. “You coming to Diagon Alley with us then?”
“Fucking Gryffindor.” Draco admonished, then before this strange truce came to an end. “Do you have any more detentions with that bitch?”
“It wasn’t.  You didn’t tell anyone to send you a Howler.  In fact, you and Blaise have gone to extensive efforts to prevent them from getting into your home.  Just like the two of you set the house elves up at Grimmauld to prevent a similar reaction.  Think positive.  It lasted less than a week this time. How long was the last episode?”
“Yes. She wants to see Draco.  I guess we should have expected this.  What with the funeral this week.”
Every logical thought tells him not to go but he can’t resist.  His mother had finalised his engagement that morning.  He should be staying as far away from Harry as possible, but despite his best intentions, Draco finds himself apparating from the Manor, via several locations, to the front door of number 12 Grimmauld place.  The lights are all out and there is no one there.  He should turn around and leave but instead he walks up to the door.  It opens to his touch and the wards feel warm and welcoming.  The house wants him here.  He walks straight upstairs to Harry’s room, ignoring the suits hanging up in the living room and other signs that Harry is imminently getting married.  He waits.  After tomorrow Harry will be lost to him forever.  There will be no more reconciliations.  He knows this is a mistake, but this is the last chance he has to be with the man he loves.  Tomorrow he’ll change his number and block Harry from the wards at the Manor.  He’s proven to himself that he’s not strong enough to resist if Harry contacts him.  For tonight though, for the very last night, he’ll be Harry’s and Harry will be his.
“I’ve had a few weeks to think things over. Congratulations by the way.”  Harry was sure that if Lee’s skin tone hadn’t hidden it so well the other man would have gone bright red at that comment, and although Harry didn’t feel any of the anger he’d had when he’d first found out, he found it quite satisfying to make the other man squirm.  After all, he had had an affair with his wife, no matter the appalling state the relationship had found itself in before that had started.
“Makes sense.” Harry kissed Draco lightly on the forehead then continued.  “I think we are going to have to move soon.  I’m starting to ache from being in this position too long.  Do you want to stay?”
“Draco and I will go either side of you.  That way you shouldn’t have to do much, just hang on.”  Harry said, a little more gently than the berating his husband had just given his father.  Harry wasn’t quite sure why he was trying to be gentle.  He hated Lucius.  Something about the broken man clearly brought out his protective side though.  “We’ve stopped here too long as it is, I really don’t want to add another jump into the mix.”
“Well I don’t think anyone is going to believe it’s mine.  Look, just go be with him.  What you said yesterday was more sincere than this. This is just you panicking about what people are going to say when they hear you cheated.  I’ll go and tell the kids at the end of the week, then we can announce to the world that we’re getting a divorce”
“Why? Do you need me to help you back to the library, or are or trying to tempt me to stay a little longer?”
Ten minutes later a nurse bustled in to check on Lily and the baby, waking both of them up.  The baby started crying and the nurse picked her up.
“Draco.  I shouldn’t have told you like that.” Harry grabbed Draco’s arms to prevent him from falling to the floor.  “Someone.  Elf.  Crap why can’t I remember any of their names.”
“Hey, if you weren’t ready, you weren’t ready.  I know what Hermione’s like, and it’s definitely worse now she’s pregnant.  Please don’t tell her I said that though.” There was genuine fear on Ron’s face as he said this sentence, and it had all come out in a slightly garbled rush.  He swallowed once before he continued.  “She probably shouldn’t have pressured you into talking in the first place if you didn’t want to.  Glad you told me now though, mate.  Still, desk work. You hate desk work.”
“I suppose.  Don’t tell her about the ward.  She won’t like it.  And don’t tell her about why I quit work.  I’ll tell her myself.  I’d rather her not work herself up into a state about it.  Especially not with the baby.”
“We’ll give them all another half an hour of chaos, then do food and fireworks,” George added.  “Join us for drinks, everything is under control.  Harry was going to tell us a story about checking out Oliver Woods arse in the quidditch changing rooms back at school.”
“Thanks Harry, I’ll clean it up whilst you sort her out.”  Angelina replied whilst trying to tempt a fractious two-year-old to try some sliced red pepper.
The kitten purred at him contentedly, seemingly wanting to do nothing more than curl up on Harry’s chest and fall asleep.  Harry walked back to the living room, carrying the kitten.  He got a book from the shelf and sat on the sofa, making himself comfy.  The warm furry little creature curled up on his lap now he was seated.  Harry was just getting to a good bit in the book when the fire place lit up green, startling him and making him jump up, forgetting the kitten was still curled up asleep.
“Sure, Malfoy.” Harry rolled his eyes.  “This is how it should always be though, coming home to you after a crap day at work.”
Harry sighed and put the kettle on the make a cup of tea whilst opening his mail.  It was mostly junk, but there was a letter from McGonagall asking him whether he’d had any further thoughts about the DADA position.  He briefly wondered why it hadn’t come straight to the Manor before dismissing the thought.  The two of them hadn’t officially made their relationship public and certainly hadn’t advertised he was all by living with Draco at this point.  McGonagall had obviously just addressed the Owl to the address she expected him to be at.  He hadn’t had much time to think about taking up the position but on brief reflection he knew that there was no way he’d manage it.  His leg barely managed the couple of short days at the centre, and if Lily and Scorpius really did allow him and Draco to adopt the baby, he’d have no time.  Besides, he wanted to spend time with Draco, not stuck at the school with a whole lot of unruly children and adolescents.  He’d need to go up to the school and tell her in person.  It didn’t feel right sending a rejection to Minerva via letter.  He respected her too much for that.  Besides going up to the school with James’ to not only make sure he got there, but also to spend some time with him, seemed like a good idea.
When Harry didn’t return by the Monday morning, they filed an official report with the Aurors.  The first new bit of information they heard was that Harry had been seen running through the Ministry the Friday evening he’d left.  He’d disapparated from the official point in the lobby.  The Aurors had tried to trace where he’d gone to, but it looked like he’d hopped between several locations once he’d left the Ministry.  They’d managed to follow his path through the first three but after that there was no sign of him.  Harry had purposefully covered his tracks, which was disturbing.  It was a trick that all Aurors knew.  It was often utilised by people trying to cover up illegal business deals.   None of them could work out why Harry had felt the need to keep his movements untraceable.
“I kind of forgot to get in contact with them.  They went to Grimmauld and freaked out that none of my stuff was there.  Hermione sent a Howler.”
“The current miscreants at Hogwarts may have nothing on the exploits of you and I, but they still keep us in good business.  Never try and visit the shop in Hogsmeade when the kids are allowed into the village.  You can’t move in there for the sea of children.”
Harry waited as Draco went through the final page of the piece, finishing the rising crescendos with a flourish before he got up.  Harry followed Draco to the little potions lab and obediently took the little bottle of lavender potion and drunk it when it was handed over.  Draco had started drifting back out of the room when Harry grabbed his hand.  Draco looked at where their hands connected, seeming slightly dazed.
“The sheets Hermione.  Merlin, you’re usually better than me at this stuff.  Do you just not want to see it?  Those sheets were covered in the evidence that Harry had sex with whoever this woman is.  My guess is she walked out that morning and told him it was over, and Harry blocked up the room as some kind of disgusting shrine.  Can you think of any other explanation?”
The impossible album was the last one.  With each glimpse into Harry’s life she had forgiven Harry, just a little.  She didn’t know what was going to happen next, whether Harry would ever truly come back, but if he did, she would make sure it went differently from last time.  It was Rosie’s 17
Harry woke to a knocking on the door and someone shouting.  For a second he panicked, thinking he was back at the Dursleys and had overslept and forgotten to make breakfast.  Then a warm arm pulled him in tight and he remembered.  He wasn’t at the Dursleys.  He was in bed with Draco.  In 1981.  There were no Dursleys.  No Voldemort.  No old man and a prophecy saying he had to become a murderer or die trying.
“Umm… that Mister Potter comes into the Ministry for testing and clearance from any spells he’s under, and that Mister Malfoy comes in for questioning.  We also need to inspect the property for any dark artifacts that we believe are being used in order to entrap Mister Potter into this so called… relationship.” The last word was practically spat out.
“There’s also something strange with the wards at Malfoy Manor.  As we had Lucius and Draco Malfoy in custody we didn’t check until after the escape.  Narcissa Malfoy is definitely living there.  She even came to speak to us at the gate, but we couldn’t get in, and it seems that she can’t get out either.  Not that we think she’s trying very hard; she knows we have a warrant for her arrest too.  It was just until the escape she was deemed relatively unimportant, so no one was actually looking for her.  The thing is, if what the curse-breakers say is true, she’s not lying about not being able to leave.  Someone activated an incredibly powerful ward linked to the Malfoy line, and they aren’t breakable.  The only people who could do that are Draco and Lucius Malfoy, and Narcissa said that she’s been locked in since just after the battle, which has been confirmed by the curse-breakers who examined the wards.  It’s not a likely place for them to go, as Harry wouldn’t be able to get in however, only the two Malfoys.”
When bedtime came, Harry tried again, although he knew it would be in vain, to put the kitten into the bed he’d made in the kitchen.  The kitten mewled so pleadingly that it didn’t take long for Harry to give in and take it to his bed.  It was quite nice falling asleep with the kitten on top of him, stroking its small furry head.
“Voldemort came back when I was 14.  He was gaining power when we left.  We have no idea how the war would have ended, but even if we knew he’d be defeated with how things were, there is no way either of us could have done anything differently to how we have once we were given the chance.”
“Yes.  Do you think anything else would set Ron off quite like that?  It didn’t say much though.  He said he was sorry.”
It was only when Harry stepped through the floo, that Blaise realise that Harry wasn’t quite as together as he had been making out.  He hadn’t gotten changed before leaving and was still covered in dried blood.
“Right before he vanished.  He said it will only work for a few days, but his publisher knows how to get in contact with him if I need more time to think about it.  He said he doesn’t want to see you or any of the others though.” Hermione reluctantly admitted.  “I think this is actually as hard on him as it is on us.  But he trusted me with it.”  Trust was the thing that they had really lost over the years, the photos and postcards gave them memories and time, but not trust, and even this small morsel felt like a huge deal.
“My relatives don’t like me much.  The stuff they do…  well I’m used to it now.  And I was able to get out of there after a few weeks.”
“We are not letting Blaise and Pansy loose in my Ancestral home.  It may not be my favourite place in the world, but Merlin knows what they’ll get up to.  I’ll floo Tori.  I’m sure she’ll agree, and the kids will love the grounds.”
“Why can’t we just run away together.  Have all our nights end like this.”  Harry murmured into Draco’s ear, and started kissing his neck.  This was it.  He wanted more time.  He wasn’t ready to do this.
Harry watches in awe as Malfoy very deliberately undoes the button and fly of his trousers, and eases himself out.  Harry doesn’t think he’s seen anything more beautiful than Draco Malfoy slowly pleasuring himself in the entrance hall of his ancestral home, surrounded by pots of paint, with the early evening sun shining on him.
“Doris is always sensible about these things.” Draco replied, enjoying the warmth of being nestled on Harry’s lap.
“Draco I’m going to carry you to the hospital wing.  Potter you are going to walk next to me and keep hold of Draco’s hand or something.  When we get to the hospital wing you are going to have to let go of each other.  At least for long enough for Pomfrey to examine you and get you into beds.  The second she leaves we’ll spell the beds together.  I’m going to stay with you so that I can separate you whenever someone comes in.  Fuck this is giant mess.”  Blaise sighed loudly.  “And I’ll also have to figure something out to explain why you’re wearing my clothes Potter, and how Draco got changed.  Potter, you will have to think of your own bloody story as to why you ended up back here in the first place.  And something that will stop people linking Draco’s illness to you.”
The three of them had managed to make a significant dent in the rather nice bottle of Scotch George had picked by the time Ron and Hermione came back downstairs to join them, about 45 minutes later.
“That’s good Draco.  I’ve always told you that sharing with friends is an important part of you keeping your mind healthy.  I’m afraid our time is up, but I would like you to book another session in with my receptionist before you leave.  And Draco, make it for six weeks.  I think you could do with a little more support right now.”
They made their way back towards the dining room where they’d had lunch, detouring slightly to Scorpius’s bedroom so he could change.  Lily waited outside Scorpius’s room, knowing if she went in the probability of them being significantly delayed was high.  The trousers he had changed into were nearly identical to the other pair, so she doubted any of the others would notice.  All of the others were sat in the dining room eating cake and playing exploding snap when they got back.  They had all clearly given up looking a while ago.  Hugo gave her a conspiratorial glance as they walked in.  She noticed Al raise his eyebrows at Scorpius.  They both grabbed a slice of the enormous Christmas cake the house elves had left on the table.  Lily gave Scorpius’s hand one last squeeze before letting go and moving to watch Hugo and Lysander playing snap.  The rest of the afternoon was fun but uneventful.  The group remained in the dining room and played a variety of muggle and wizard games.  It was around 4.00pm when Mr Malfoy entered the room to let them know it was time to go.  Lily thought it was probably the first time she’d seen Mr Malfoy smile, when Al and Scorp had both collapsed into a heap as he had entered, effectively ending the game of Twister they were playing.
Lily nodded, but she wasn’t sure she really did.  Thinking about her parents as people separate from mum and dad wasn’t something she’d ever had to do before.  She saw her dad look over towards the back of the room again.
Harry brightened slightly.  Clearly the thought of reacquainting with old friends and family wasn’t completely out of the question, but then his expression changed to one of resignation.  “I don’t know.  I’d want Draco with me, and I don’t think he nor the Weasleys are going to be ready that any time soon.  I doubt any of our old friends would be prepared to see him…” Harry paused before he spoke again.  “Maybe the two of us can arrange to meet again somewhere like this though and you can bring both your children.  I’ll even drag Teddy along so you can meet him properly.  I’d like to bring Draco too but I’m happy to wait until you’re ready for that.”
“No, whenever I see him, he’s with Al, and I can hardly go up to Scorpius in front of my big brother and be like ‘hey, want to ditch your best friend to go make out with his sister’.” Hugo laughed at this statement and Lily continued.  “Well I guess I could, but I’m not sure it would go down too well.”
“It’s okay Scorpius,” although she thought her Dad looked like that was the furthest thing from what he actually felt.  “If Lily wants you here you can stay. I can see you’re very close.”  Lily felt guilty and a little ashamed at the way she had spoken to her Dad whilst he was being so nice.
“I’m sorry.” Draco said, softly, feeling a little ashamed, although wasn’t sure exactly why he admitting to feeling bad about the way he behaved towards Potter.
“I think pretty much, if you’ve been seeing her anyway near as long as I have.  She’s one hell of a therapist.  And this certainly proves her discretion.  There’s no way she didn’t know, if you’ve been talking about me, that is?”
“What the fuck was the ferrety, failed, Death Eater doing in your house, and more importantly why was he wearing what appeared to be one of your jumpers?”
I know this chapter is a little all over the place, especially in terms of characterisation.  I'm trying to work out a way to show the balance in their relationship and I'm not sure I've quite got it right.  Draco is meant to be a little erratic at the moment in terms of moods going up and down at the drop of a hat, and his anxiety is off the scale.  Harry is not quite with it because of the huge amount of potions he's having to take.  Blaise is basically stressed to almost the point of breaking trying to hold everything together.  I hope this comes across.
The knock on the door made Harry jump.  He’d gone ahead to Grimmauld to wait for Andi and Teddy to arrive.  Draco was in a panic, and Blaise was dosing him up with calming draughts to get him into the floo.
Draco woke with his back feeling like hell and very disorientated.  He couldn’t work out where on earth he was.  Sunlight was coming in in a very unfamiliar way.  He was used to the muted light that came through the lake into the Slytherin dormitories.  He sat up and looked around.  He was still in the classroom he and Potter had met up in.  On the next desk over Potter was still asleep.  The bowl he’d been soaking his hand in had tipped over at some point and its contents spilled onto the floor.  Draco looked at the time and swore.
They headed to the library.  Harry was amazed when he stepped in and saw the wealth of knowledge around him.
“Scorpius, where have you been?  I was getting worried.” Al said, then he caught a glance at Scorpius’s face. “Fuck, what the hell’s happened?”
“No you’re not are you.” Draco murmured, and Harry moved so he was on top of Draco and kissed him, pressing their crotches together, where both their erections were growing.  Draco began to move, increasing the friction and pressure.  It felt wonderful.  All these years together and Harry could still do this to him.  Still make him feel overwhelmed with his presence.
“Really, you need to see this.”  Malfoy reached into the bin and grabbed out what looked like a paper.  Harry couldn’t imagine what could be so important that the aristocratic blond had reached into a bin in a muggle neighbourhood and pulled out a paper.
Kingsley Shacklebolt was pacing his office in agitation.  He couldn’t work out what the hell had happened.  Somehow two Death Eaters, and two of the more notorious ones at that, had escaped Azkaban with the aid of Harry Potter.  To say he was furious was an understatement.  Underlying that anger were the even worse feelings of frustration and utter bewilderment.  They had managed to trace the initial apparition and then the next couple of jumps as far as Nottingham, but then nothing.  The escape had clearly been planned down to the last detail, and the only person that could have done that was Harry Potter.  It just didn’t seem possible that the boy who had defeated Voldemort would help the Malfoys escape justice.  A knock from the door dragged Kingsley out of his tangled thoughts.
“Mother.  I need you to be strong and stand up to father.  I know you can do it.  You were always strong enough to protect me from Father when I was little, but if you don’t do this for me now, then there will be a day where you can’t protect me.  Where I come from the Dark Lord is back… He’s living here in the Manor.  So is Aunt Bella.  I’ve been held under the cruciatus curse by both of them.  They threatened you and made me take the mark.  They gave me an impossible mission that I was meant to fail.  They were going to torture and kill both of us.  Mother… Please….  Bring little Draco away from here.”  Despite the awful things Draco was confessing, he stayed calm, and Harry had to give him credit for that.  He’d been nowhere near as calm explaining to Sirius.  Narcissa was in turmoil.  This boy was calling her mother but her only child was Draco.  Draco was the only child she would ever have thanks to Lucius.
“That was an easy answer to the change of form.  You match.  I’m assuming because of whatever link you share.  Also, how is it fair that Draco gets it on his first attempt, and I’m stuck with this shimmery mist.”
“But it hurts.  It hurts now and we haven’t even met her yet.”  Scorpius said, finally admitting to Lily what he didn’t even want to admit to himself.
.  This was one of the times he was very glad he was a wizard.  He knew muggles had to get to Paddington (a faff from this part of London) to get back to Wiltshire by train, and even if that wasn’t the case, the last train of the night for muggles had left hours ago. He could get on the train from here and be a short floo trip from the station back to his home and his bed.  He supposed he could have gotten in the taxi and flooed from the Leaky, but he didn’t really feel like making small talk with Daphne and Hannah whilst drunk and tired.  This way he avoided it.  The train was also a lot more comfortable than rushing through fireplaces for miles on end, feeling worse for wear.  He might also avoid vomiting on the hearth rug, an inevitability if he took the floo all the way from London to Wiltshire whilst drunk; a bonus even if the journey was slower.  He found a seat in an empty carriage, and let the conductor know to alert him just before they arrived at his stop.  Then, casting a cushioning charm behind his head and a warming charm around him, he closed his eyes and promptly fell asleep. He didn’t know whether it was conversations of Potter or the sense memory from the train moving that triggered him to dream about taking the Hogwarts express back at the start of the Christmas holidays during his eighth year.  When he woke, just before his stop, the dream was still playing over and over in his head.  It followed him into the Manor, up to his bedroom and between his silk sheets, where he laid down and tried to fall back to sleep.
“I just want to protect you.  You’ve dealt with enough.  I managed to keep my temper at least, unlike him.  I played it just like you would have, not like the foolish Gryffindor I am, and when he told me to get out, I did.”
“Where are the boys?”  Narcissa asked.  Remus and Sirius looked dreadful.  Little Harry was asleep in Sirius’ arms, oblivious to the chaos around him with the potion still strong in his system.
“Okay.  Tara’s coming at 3pm on Friday.  Think you can be home then so we can do it with her there as well?”
“I love you too.  You can’t do this again.  You can’t shove everything away and pretend it isn’t happening.  It isn’t fair.”
Someone wrapped their arms around him up and they felt warm and comforting, but they weren’t they right person.  Harry felt tears starting to prickle in his eyes.
They remained silent after that.  Waiting and watching the house.  At 11.40 pm they the headmaster come round the corner.  Even in the dim light of the streetlamps he couldn’t be mistaken for anyone else.  He approached the house with the cat sat outside.  They saw an amused twitch on the old man’s lips when he spotted the cat.  Then he got something out of his robes and the streetlamps went out one by one.  It made it very hard to see what was happening.  They were able to tell when McGonagall changed from cat to human, but not much else.  They also couldn’t hear what the two of them were saying.  Harry wished he had one of Fred and George’s extendable ears to hand.  A rumbling sound came from the sky and they spotted a light coming towards them.
Harry got up and left.  He still had another half an hour left before he was meant to leave for the day, but he couldn’t be arsed to go back to his desk.  He was too angry at the way Kingsley spoke about Draco.  He knew people forgiving Draco would be hard, but nobody but him seemed bothered to even try to see the person Draco really was.  All anyone seemed to see was the mark on Draco’s arm.  The mark he regretted.  The mark he was forced to take when a mad man took over his house and threatened his family.  He knew it was probably hypocritical of him to think this way.  He’d only bothered to get to know Draco after he’d been all but forced to by the Ministry.  He had been so naive about what they were doing then, but it had only taken a couple of these meeting for him to catch on.  He had really thought that they wanted to help Draco.  That when he’d been given only a probationary sentence in his trial, they meant it.  He knew now, they’d been forced into it by Harry’s testimony, and since then they had been trying to use him to put Draco where they all thought he belonged.  Draco’s self-imposed isolation didn’t exactly help matters either.  He refused to go out anywhere where they might be seen by others from the magical community.  They were never going to accept him if he just hid his whole life.  Harry was convinced that if Draco started going out in the world, and let people see the person he really was, they would eventually be able forgive.  The whole stupid situation left Harry frustrated.  He didn’t spend most of his childhood fighting against a prejudiced tyrant, just for more prejudice to replace it.  He decided just to leave work early.  It’s not like anyone would say anything, even if they noticed.
Harry woke to the chiming of the floo, announcing someone’s arrival.  The music had stopped at some point and he looked down to see Draco leaning against the sofa and holding his hand, fast asleep.  He leant down and kissed Draco’s head.
“My Godfather lives in London, so it’s closer to St Mungo’s.  There are also a fair number of protective wards over the place so it’s a relatively safe place for me to be.”
“You poor sheltered thing.” Teddy joked, then looked up to see the waiter approaching.  “Ah, I think that’s our champagne.”
Harry stop and turned.  “Hi, Ron.”  He replied, smiling at the happy expression on his friend’s face.  They hadn’t seen each other since Harry had turned up to his and Hermione’s place and shouted the two of them out about the howler.  It had been a long time since they’d gone that long without seeing each other, and he found he missed his friend.  He’d been far too wrapped up with the ups and downs causing chaos in his home life he hadn’t even realised until now.
“Ronald Bilius Weasley.  What the bloody hell did you think you were doing?  You know I’m trying to get to know Harry again.  He’s never going to trust me again after this.”  Hermione could just picture Harry’s face when he learned that it had been her fault he’d been betrayed.  And their relationship was so tentative at the moment, it wouldn’t take anything for it to slip straight back into nothingness.  She wouldn’t be surprised if the two of them decided to disappear again after this.  Then she might never get her chance to have any kind of friendship with Harry.  She missed him, and each time she’d seen him only confirmed that more to her.  And she knew Ron missed him too.
“He’s rolling in his grave, I’m sure.”  Draco smiled as he said this, before kissing Harry lightly on the lips.
Harry followed her into her office.  Again, the room had barely changed.  He sat down on the old comfortable armchair he’d spent so many hours in previously as Doris made herself comfortable on the one opposite.
“Doesn’t matter.  It’s the company that matters, and I happen to like yours.  In fact, I’m not really ready to be done with your company this evening.”  Teddy said, flirtatiously and letting his foot rub gently against the other man’s ankle.
This wasn’t how this was supposed to go, and Draco was unsure of exactly how to answer her.  The only thing he could think of was to bring up his mother.  He had planned to mention her and the invitation, but not this soon. “Well, yes.  But mother said you were in contact again and I thought this would be a good excuse to come and see you in person.  I wanted to come and extend you an invitation to the Manor for dinner this evening.”
“Don’t feel like I’m going to throw up or pass out either.  The pain is better, I think.”  Draco tried to reassure, although his words came out a little too casually for that.  His voice was actually a little disturbing, as if he still wasn’t quite there.  If he was honest, Draco didn’t feel quite there.  He felt like he was somewhere else.  Or in two places at once.  But the split in two feeling was easing, as long as he let his instincts carry on taking control.
“I’m the one who kept you away.  I should have listened to when you said to run that day, instead of both of us going through those extra months, only to run anyway. You have nothing to apologise for.  We’ve been over this before and digging it up doesn’t help either of us.”
“Noble and Most Ancient.  Also Harry and Draco have a thing about cheap alcohol.  I grew up with it and it’s kind of stuck.  The wine cellar is original, and I really have no clue as to exactly what’s in there. The whiskey stock is whatever Harry abandoned here.  My family are weird, but I’ve learnt to love them anyway.”
“Okay.” He looked almost comically relived at this.  “I didn’t really think that you were… but something is wrong?”
“Hey, Nev” Harry said as he entered the living room, announcing his presence.  He stopped abruptly when he saw it wasn’t Neville in the room.
“I see…” Remus replied.  Again looking between the two teenagers and their toddler selves.  There was definitely something he was missing.
“That’s fantastic.  I’m glad you’re making plans for the future.  I want to go to University too.  I’ve talked about it with McGonagall in our private sessions.  I want to work in advanced transfigurations, which probably means working for the Unspeakables eventually.  But I think I want to do a biochemistry degree first.  I’m going to have to take loads of extra classes to get up to scratch with the muggle components of it before then though.  My therapist says that making these kind of plans helps.”
“Won’t be too bad.  I’m going to have press at the gates for weeks.  Not just me either.  Anyone who knows you is going to be bombarded with reporters.”  Narcissa still sounded cross but looked a little less like she was going to murder the two of them.
She apparated to the square and made her way towards the house.  She should still be able to get into the property.  If they hadn’t yet left, she’d be able to catch them.  It came as a surprise when she couldn’t get up the steps.  The wards had been changed.  Only Harry had the ability to do that and it wasn’t a particularly quick process and could only be achieved from within the property.  Maybe it was just her bad luck that she was the first person he’d removed when he entered; although why Harry would come home and block her from the wards was beyond her.  Then it clicked.  Of course, the bank papers.  It wasn’t just his accounts that had been changed; something had been done to the property too.  They’d asked Bill and Fleur to head to the bank as soon as the papers had come through.  Hopefully, they could find out exactly what had happened, she’d have to ask them later to look into the property as well.  Well if she couldn’t get in and see whoever was in there, she’d just have to rely on her back up plan.  She got the coin out and looked at it.  Five more minutes and she’d have readings on who was in the house.  She waited impatiently as the seconds ticked down.  The coin started heating up in her hand.  That wasn’t supposed to happen.  It got hotter and hotter.  She dropped it, unable to hold on any longer.  As soon as it left her hand flames enveloped the coin, then she saw a serpent rise out of it and dive down before the fire vanished.  The coin was gone, just a blackened patch on the pavement remained.  She stood stunned, staring at the blackened patch.  She recognised fiendfyre.   The smell, heat and chasing demons were ingrained in her memory.  Whoever was in the house had been able to not only use but control one of the most destructive forces in existence.  She knew Harry would never have had the control to so precisely destroy her device that way.  Very few wizards even knew how to produce it at all.  She apparated back home with dark thoughts on her mind.  Harry had obviously gotten himself into serious trouble.  She couldn’t think of any other explanation.  The problem was there were still no leads.  There was nothing to research.  Her friend was gone, and she felt lost.
“You’re not allowed up there.” The two girls chorused, before they both skipped off into the main common room.  They seemed to have come away from the collision without a scratch, much to his irritation.
“Love you too.”  Draco starts moving his kisses down to Harry’s neck.  He eases Harry out of his t-shirt.  He kisses each of Harry’s scars, some old, some from his most recent accident.  “You are absolutely gorgeous.  You know that?”
of June 1980.  Look at him… He’s 16…. Look at him… he’s too young to be Lucius…  He has the Black family eyes.  He’s like me….”
“Little Harry will need to be in the room when we call him to us.  We need to do the soul calling spell again.  This time you and little Harry will need to be conduits too.  It’s actually safer this way as far as the spell is concerned.  You won’t end up collapsing with pain as the ritual won’t be calling to the horcruxes in you.  But it does mean that when he arrives, little Harry will be there.”
Harry left then.  He’d mind was swirling with the breadth of emotions he’d dealt with.  Malfoy was at the forefront of his mind.  He both missed the bastard and was furious with him.  It was his son that had gotten his daughter into this mess.  He knew it was irrational to blame Malfoy for this, but he wanted someone to shout at.  Someone to vent his grief and rage at.  Briefly he thought about sending a howler.  Ranting every hateful thought he could think of into it.  Having Malfoy wince at the screaming red letter.  He pushed this thought aside though.  Harry wasn’t sure whether it was just that he thought it was unfair for Malfoy to receive such major news like that, or whether he just wanted to see the man.  Instead of apparating home to vent his rage into a letter he apparated to the Manor.
The three of them spent the next hour in a state of pleasure that made them forget the awful events of the evening and fell asleep tangled together sticky and sated.
“I regretted it the second I did, and I came back as soon as I could.  You’ve been gone for 15 years and you don’t exactly look like you’ve been torn up about leaving us all behind. Why did you even come back?”  Ron had asked one of the questions that had plagued her since she’d seen who was on the doorstep.  The niggling in her brain, that she needed to find out the truth about the past, had been her companion since that tumultuous day fifteen years ago.  Harry showing up posed a whole new series of questions.
“Invisibility cloak… really Harry.  You’re a complete bastard you know that.  That’s how your head appeared in Hogsmeade back in third year.” Draco scowled at the memory of mud being flung at him by the shrieking shack.
That small squeeze carried Harry through the entire excruciating wait at St Mungo’s before the healer called him in. The clinic was running twenty minutes behind – which wasn’t as bad as it could have been, but still longer than Harry liked.  The appointment itself was relatively quick though.  The healers were pleased with how everything seemed to be progressing.  He was given a new bag of potions supplies, along with an appointment for the following week.  He noticed that the there were fewer of the purple potions and that there were now several of phials of lavender potions in the collection.  He hadn’t told the healer that he’d already made that particular switch already.  It pleased him though that Draco had known how the potions step down worked.  Draco could have had so many opportunities open to him with his various areas of expertise had the war and his health not taken them away from him.  He was just walking out when he spotted a familiar bushy haired witch heading towards him.  He glanced around looking for somewhere to hide.  He did not want to face Hermione and was annoyed that she was even here.  Clearly someone had blabbed his appointment time and she’d decided to stalk him.  Before he managed to duck away, she called to him.
Hermione didn’t feel too great herself, but she wasn’t going to tell Ron that.  Molly and Arthur had taken the kids off them for the night and they’d both drunk a bit more than usual at Dean’s New Year’s party.  It had been nice to let loose and not to be a parent for the night.  She thought about asking Ron to grab her a potion as well when he got up and stumbled up the stairs to the bathroom but decided against it.  Instead she made do with a very large cup of coffee.  She made Ron a cup too, then proceeded to make the two of them a cooked breakfast.  They still had a few kid free hours left, and breakfast with her husband seemed like a good way to spend them.  Maybe they could share a shower after and spend a little time together in bed if they had time.  The morning paper arrived whilst she was cooking.  Ron had paid the owl then slumped off to the living room to read, leaving her to finish up the cooking alone in the blissful quiet of the kitchen.  Her peaceful morning was disturbed far too soon for her liking though.
“Draco, sit.” Pansy commanded and he obeyed, his foot twitching up and down, eyes darting around the room unable to look at her. “Breathe Draco, you need to calm down. I can see you digging your nails into your palms.”  He hadn’t even realised he was doing it.  Pansy had seen him have panic attacks before but not for several years.   He unclenched his fists and looked down at the nail marks.  At least he hadn’t broken the skin.
Harry let both Blaise and Theo buy him a shot each, which he quickly necked one after the other.  He thought back to his previous bachelor party, back in London.  He’d been utterly miserable about what the next day would bring.  He’d been surrounded by people who he’d considered his friends and family but felt completely separated from it.  Here he was surrounded by those, who back then, he would never have thought would be his friends.  This group had accepted him and kept his secret.  To them it hadn’t mattered that he was Harry Potter and that they’d been rivals at school.  What mattered was that he made Draco happy.  Not a word had ever made the press about his whereabouts, despite the fact that he did not live the isolated life he’d expected when he’d run with Draco all those years ago.  They may have been Draco’s friends first, and their loyalty to him was what had kept them from spilling Harry’s location initially, but they were his friends too now.  Harry watched, enraptured, as a blonde man who’d changed his life, made his way off the dance floor towards him.
After Draco had gone Pansy tried to go to bed for a bit and catch up on some of the sleep that had evaded her the night before.  It wouldn’t come though.  The same thoughts that had plagued her during the night continued to do so now.  What she really wanted to do was give Potter a piece of her mind.  Not about the mess Draco and his children had gotten themselves into.  That wasn’t really Potter’s fault any more than it was Draco’s.  Teenagers were stupid.  Much had changed in the world since the 90s, but not that much.  She had learnt the same lesson Scorpius was learning in the same hard way back then, through her own stupidity.  The recklessness and invincibility of being young and alive making a for a spectacular fall, when the realisation that she wasn’t exempt from things going wrong.  But Potter needed to know what consequences his actions had on her best friend and she was the only one in a position to tell him.  Draco never would.  Summoning a quill and piece of parchment she wrote a letter.  It was brief and to the point, she just hoped Potter would come.  Once her owl had whisked it away, she settled back down into bed, setting an alarm for an hour before the meeting she’d just arranged, and this time she managed to drift off.
The waiter left and Teddy looked towards the door.  There were still ten minutes to go before Justin was due to turn up, so he wasn’t expecting anything, but just as he was about to turn his eyes away again, the man walked through.  Teddy couldn’t help the wide smile that spread across his face when Justin caught his eye.  He gestured for the man to join him, and Justin hurried over to the table.
“Top cupboard.  I think there are chocolate digestives.”  Harry says, not looking away from Draco, who is starting to really panic.
He knocked on Neville’s door as he arrived at the cottage, hoping that his friend would be in and happy to see him.  He probably should have given him some notice, but the whole Hogwarts visit had been a little spontaneous.  The door swung inwards and he took that as an invitation.  He walked into the house, calling out.  There were voices from the living room and headed that way.
“Okay, so you two are going to be spilling secrets to each other as well as being unable to go more than five minutes without touching.”
“Thank you.  And I meant what I said about calling me Narcissa.  You are important to my son.”  The tone of her voice was different than it had been the day before, and this time Harry believed her.
“Yes, mother.  And…”  He shoved the fear into a little corner of his mind to be let out and dealt with later.   “And I’m sure Harry would love for you to stay in Grimmauld for the time being… and… you can send a message through the floo from there.  I’ll get Harry to make sure you can do that.”
“I love you too.”  They were kissing again.  When they managed to take a breath for air.  “I promise.  I will never ever leave you.  Did I hurt him badly?”  Harry looked softly at the still unconscious blond in Blaise’s lap.
“I want baby Harry to grow up knowing his godfather though.”  Harry didn’t know quite why it was so important.  It just felt that way to him.
“I have something else to say to all of the venerable people in front of me.”   Every part of his being screamed at him to stop, but he couldn’t.  The last fight with Draco had made it clear that this was the only way forward.  “Without the devotion, even in absence, of the woman next to me, I would not have made it through the horrific year leading up to the final battle.”  The insincerity of the words tasted fetid.  Like his tongue was rotting at the betrayal of his own wants.  “Therefore, in front of every being and creature here in this hall, I would like to declare my own devotion to her.”  Wishing that he would spontaneously combust, so he wouldn’t have to take the next step, Harry moved onto one knee and pulled the box out of his pocket.  The box that contained the hateful ring he’d bought.  “Ginevra Weasley, would you do me the great honour of becoming my wife?”
“I’m not sure I want to see those photos.”  Hermione replied, interpreting the look and guessing at what four drunk adults had gotten up to reliving their youth in the castle.
“Well that’s something.  You should get in contact with all the people Harry has been photo’d with.  Make sure they reinforce their wards as well.  They deserve some warning too.  Maybe we can stop this from being a complete and utter disaster.”
“Of course I love you, you prat.  And I know all about your exhibitionist streak.  I spent 6 months dealing with you publicly pawing at me across half the globe.  It feels different in England though.  I keep expecting someone to come over recognise us.”
“Here, let me take her.” Harry said smiling at the young girl and walking over.  He leaned his stick against the wall so he could hold the baby properly.
“It’s going to hurt.  She might not even be here yet, but I already know I love her.  If we were giving her to strangers.  If we were never able to see her again, I’d have to think about it differently.  But we are going to be in her life.  It may not be in the way that in an ideal world we’d like, but it will be in the best possible way that we can manage under the circumstances.”
Harry couldn’t believe how useful the Goblins at the bank could be.  He’d never had much interaction with them in his previous life.  In fact, he’d only actually been to the bank before his first year.  Even in third year, when he’d spent weeks in the alley, he hadn’t been.  Someone else had always somehow ended up dealing with it for him and either buying his stuff, or giving him the gold to do so himself.  He didn’t even have his vault key.  Hagrid had had it that first year, and hadn’t given it to him after they were done.  He guessed Dumbledore must have been keeping it and dishing it out to whoever was tasked with assisting Harry that summer.  It didn’t seem fair somehow, especially with the greater understanding of how things worked in the wizarding world that Draco was slowly but surely teaching him.
“Oh god, you had to sit through that.  Through everything he had to say?  It was bad enough that he put us through that…”  Al had started smiling.
“You’ll need to show me.  I didn’t know the first spell you did, let alone this one you seemed to have been able to come up with in less than 5 minutes.  I have no idea how you did that.”
“Can I sit?”  Harry asked.  He was unsure of the protocol in this situation.  He wasn’t even sure there was a protocol for this.
“Okay…Well you know now and that’s what’s important, and I can explain exactly what it means when we’re not stood in a park in the middle of the night.  For now, planning what to do next is more important and the first step is to go to Gringotts and claim the Potter Estate.  We then need to make sure we get back here in time to grab baby you tonight and find somewhere to hide out until my father’s arrest that’s safe and secure for us and the baby.  Then we take mother out of the Manor and get her to testify against my father.  When he’s sent to Azkaban then I can take over as head of the Malfoy family.  I’m sure there are other things as well, but I think those are the priorities”.
“I don’t get the how the whole first cousin, second cousin thing works.”  Harry said, trying to keep the mood light.  Like Draco being introduced to Teddy wasn’t the monumental occurrence that it was.  “And I bought him here, didn’t I.  Of course you can meet Teddy.”  Harry smiled widely at the blonde propped up in bed.
It was after 10am when Draco finally left the hospital, Scorpius and Lily in tow.  He was exhausted, ached all over, and felt decidedly grubby from the hour or so’s sleep he’d managed to grab in one of the waiting room chairs.  It had been decided sometime in the early hours of the morning that Harry was going to collect Al and James from the school rather than them having to travel back on the train and had flooed straight from the hospital about half an hour ago.  Ginny’s new baby, Fred, had been born at a little after 5am.  Draco had stayed back when everyone had gone to coo at the baby in turn.  He felt a little like he was intruding.  Scorpius had gone in with Lily when she went to meet her baby brother and had been pleased to finally be introduced to Lily’s mum as her boyfriend.  When they arrived at the Manor, he sent the teenagers up to bed.  He briefly thought about insisting on separate rooms but then decided he couldn’t be bothered with arguing about it.  It’s not like they could make anything any worse.  Rather than heading to bed himself, although he was beat, he decided instead to shower and try and get some work done before Harry arrived.  Harry was planning on dropping his two boys at the hospital and then come back here.  Lee was going to send the boys over later.  With the new baby the plan was for all of Harry’s kids to stay Grimmauld for the holidays.  For today though, it was easier if everyone came to the Manor.  They could deal with proper sleeping arrangements tomorrow when everyone was less tired.  Once he was sat in his study, he called one of the elves to bring him the paper and a couple of scones and some tea.  The elf popped back with a tray laid out then quickly left.  Draco thought the elf had seemed apprehensive about something but shook it off and poured himself a cup of tea from the pot that had been stewing form him.  Thinly spreading a layer of butter on one half of the scone and taking a bite he leant back and finally picked up the paper.  It had been folded in on itself, so the front page hadn’t been visible until he picked it up.  Draco dropped the scone he’d been holding.  Half the front page was taken up with a photo of him and Harry kissing on the rooftop.
“I did something dreadful after you left, and I don’t know how to undo it?”  Harry started, taking the conversation down the path it had to go, but that he wished he could avoid.
“I’m a free man.  All very straightforward.  The aurors are now looking for Wormtail instead of me.  They apologised for the inconvenience.  The whole story will be in the prophet tomorrow.  Probably accompanied by that picture of you, Harry.”  The picture of Harry that seemed to be almost constantly in the prophet was a bit of a sore point for Harry, Draco and Sirius.  It could only have been taken and given to the press with Dumbledore’s blessing.  He was the only one who had had the opportunity to do so after little Harry had been attacked.  The lightning bolt cut was prominent on the baby’s head and still bleeding in the photo.  It made them all a little sick.
“You’re right,” Draco sighed.  “It just feels so good having you here with me.  Having you talk to me openly for once.”
“Just a photo you are absolutely not copying for the Weasleys.”  Draco said handing over the album so Harry could see.  It was the page dedicated to their Diagon Alley escapade.  They’d gotten ridiculously drunk that day wondering through the hub of wizarding shopping in England.  They’d kept their clothes on, most of the time, but once the place had been mostly deserted, they’d held their little dance party in their underwear in the middle of the street.  Things had only gotten more chaotic from there.  Draco still can’t remember who suggested breaking into the Ministry, but that was where they had ended up.  Both couples had ended up completely naked in the fountain in the foyer splashing water at each other.  The particular picture that had amused Draco was of him and Harry kissing under the flowing water.  How they hadn’t gotten caught was a complete mystery and was probably due to a great deal of luck.  It had been a fantastic day, however.
They apparated near the long-abandoned Riddle Manor.  The house wasn’t quite as large as Malfoy Manor, but they could tell it was going to take an age to search.  Even with the four of them.  Narcissa was at home with the babies so it was Harry, Draco, Remus and Sirius on this mission.  They walked inside and Harry froze.  His breath coming quicker as he was thrown into a memory he didn’t even realise he still had.  He remembered the old man walking through this house in his dreams.  Of finding Voldemort talking to Wormtail in front of the fire.  Of Nagini reporting to her Master.  His legs went from under him as he felt a phantom pain in his head start to burn.
“They were in our classroom…” Alcohol was making it all too easy for Harry to confess everything to Malfoy and the conversation all too quickly had gone from light and amusing to bringing back every painful memory.  Tears had started to form in his eyes, so he closed them.  Trying to hide the fact that he was so close to breaking down.  This wasn’t how this evening was meant to go.  Then Harry felt a warm hand on top of his.  The slender fingers all too familiar.
“Okay, that’s enough about your marriage for now.  Let us move on to your mystery person.  Have you seen them at all in the intervening years?”
“I love you too.  And as for going back, I don’t know.  Sometimes I try to imagine what it would be like to step near my old life again.  But I can’t see it.  I’m not that person anymore.  Even if we went back, it wouldn’t be the same.  I think one day I might be strong enough to let them know the truth though”
Harry walked into the flat.  He followed the sound of what he thought was a passage from Tchaikovsky’s first piano concerto.  Harry leant against the door frame and just watched and listened when he reached the music room.  Draco was scowling at the music and going over the same few bars over and over.  Harry couldn’t hear anything wrong, but clearly Draco could.
Collecting the Horcruxes turned into a much simpler task than any of them could have imagined.  Certainly an easier task than Dumbledore had made it out to be in the future.    Harry and Draco collected the cup the following day from Gringotts.  They already had plans to go and decided to kill two birds with one stone.  They spent about an hour with the Goblins confirming Draco as the head of the Malfoy family, as well as the Lestrange one – that trial had been rushed through and the brothers and Bellatrix were already sentenced to Azkaban, leaving Draco free to take up the title of head of the household.  This, most importantly, allowed him access to the family vaults, where, as Narcissa had predicted, in the Lestrange vaults, the cup was located.  They also sorted themselves new identities.  They were now much safer under the guises of Orion Malfoy and Henry Potter.  The other thing they were able to do was to name their little versions as their heirs, ensuring that they had legal guardianship over them.  It meant that if Dumbledore ever did find out that little Harry wasn’t where he’d put him, there was very little he could do to take him away from them.  They wanted to avoid that confrontation if they could, however.  There was one thing Dumbledore had gotten right about his plan for little Harry to be raised by the Dursleys.  Little Harry was probably better off not being raised in the spotlight, and if Dumbledore tried to fight for custody, there was no doubt in their minds that it would end up as media circus.
“That would definitely be worse.  Umm… I do have one odd observation at the moment I want to ask about.  Zabini, it’s about you stroking Draco’s wrist.”
Harry moved so Draco was lying underneath him.  He kissed Draco hard.  Draco responded eagerly. Harry could feel himself getting hard and felt embarrassed.  He pulled back from the kiss.
“Come on, sit next to me.  I bought a bowl this time so you can soak your hand.  It will work better that way.”
“Fuck Draco.  I don’t know what to do.”  Blaise was biting his lower lip and his right hand was worrying anxiously at the back of his neck.
“So, your friend caught you and this man in a… delicate position?”  Doris said when Harry stopped talking.
Harry left Andromeda’s with the nagging suspicion that Andi wasn’t telling him the whole truth about these tests at St Mungos.  That this was something a little more serious than she was letting on.
Harry and Draco walked back in and were again hit with the aura of black ooze.  Harry closed his eyes and concentrated.  He could almost feel where it was coming from.
“Most people don’t.  Me and Draco did a lot of things to hide our identities.” Harry looked guilty as he said this, but then brightened, and Hermione had the suspicion that Teddy had spent his Hogwarts years having to pretend to be someone else in order not to be traced back to Harry and Draco.  It was probably a bit overkill if she thought about it.  She doubted anyone would connect Teddy Lupin to Harry Potter.  It was only by chance that she had when she first bumped into him.  “But he was head boy in his 7
At that moment, Al’s Dad walked through the door and nearly bumped straight into his Father who was stood impatiently, looking reproachfully at the two boys.
“That’s the blood ward keeping mother and me in here down.  We can apparate up to the main house now.  It’s a bloody long way to walk.”
“I’m having a cigarette.  I don’t care if you hate me smoking in the house.  I think this is a good enough reason to do it.”  Sirius declared.
“They were meant to come with us, but they had childcare issues and are running late.  Not really sure when they’ll get here.” The woman said, looking completely taken aback at being drawn into the passive aggressive row between the headmistress of Hogwarts and Harry Potter.
Justin thinks carefully about his first question, trying to work about the best way to get the information he thinks will make a good story within his limited questions. “You haven’t been seen in England for over 20 years, what are you doing back here now?”  It feels like a good start, and none of the men he’s talking to seem to take objection to it.
“I’m going to go and contact their mind healer for you now.  She’ll be able to fill you in on the two of them.  Harry should be okay in an hour or so.  This doesn’t happen very often for him, at least not when he shuts down completely.  I’d request that you don’t touch him at all for the time being.  I will be back in ten minutes, and if you need Harry moved at all to treat Draco, I’ll do it.”
“Might not be so bad in Wiltshire?”  Draco said, although not with much hope.  The sky had looked just as heavy back at home that morning.  They bundled up Teddy in the buggy and put the clear plastic hood down to make sure he stayed dry.  Blaise, thankfully, found two large umbrellas in one of the bags Andromeda had packed for Teddy.  Draco and Harry hid him whilst he got them out, so as not to make any muggles suspicious at the umbrellas coming out of a bag much too small to carry them.  It sort of made Harry want to watch Mary Poppins.  Teddy would probably enjoy the singing, even if he didn’t have the attention span to watch the entire film.  With Blaise under one umbrella and Draco holding the other over himself and Harry, who was pushing the buggy, they ran through the rain back to the apparition point.  They had to faff in Grimmauld for a few minutes to get Teddy added to the floo back to the Manor, but he was remarkably good about allowing the little snake on the fireplace prick his finger.  The weather in Wiltshire, was, if anything, worse than the weather in Oxfordshire.  They all quickly got changed into clean dry clothes.  Harry sorted Teddy out.   Blaise had obviously managed to get Teddy to use the toilet at the play centre, as his pull-up nappy was still clean and dry.  Teddy wasn’t doing too badly with potty training, but there were still more than a few accidents, especially when Teddy got enthralled with something.
“I can see this is hard for you, and I’m not saying you have to tell me, and I’m certainly not saying you need to talk about this now.  But this is a 20-year-old secret, and secrets held this long have a way of festering.  I want you to think about that between now and your next session and I would like you to be able to explain fully what acknowledging this relationship to someone else means to you.  I will move on though as we don’t have much time left.  There are a few other things I want you to think on before our next session.  Firstly, think about the worst-case scenario and the best-case scenario if someone you trusted explicitly knew that you had had a relationship with this person, both back then, and about what happened last night.  Next, I want you to think about what it was that was stopping you having an enjoyable sex life with your ex-wife.  From our previous sessions and from what you’ve said today I don’t think a lack of interest in sex generally is the problem, so there must be something else. It would also be useful to think about how this might have made Ginevra feel. Thirdly, I would like you to find a meaningful way of occupying some of your days. I don’t care if it is work, volunteering, a hobby even, but it must get you out of the house and preferably involve the company of others.  Lastly, I don’t think it is a good idea for you to have any alcohol before I see you again, and absolutely do not drink by yourself.  I know you have managed moderation for a long time, and I’m assuming with no other blips of solo binge drinking, but until you feel more balanced you should probably try to abstain as much as you can. Is this all clear.”
“No.”  Andi admitted.  Cissa looked appalled.  Harry had offered but she had refused.  She knew the special treatment it would allow her wouldn’t make any difference to her prognosis, and it felt like an unnecessary expense.
Harry didn’t see his Draco for the rest of the day.  He knew his friend had spent the entire day brewing, only leaving to give Narcissa the potions she needed as he finished each one.  Harry ended up going to bed early.  Watching two toddlers was exhausting.  After the breakthrough with the toys, little Harry and little Draco decided that they were inseparable.  Harry had even had to put them in the same cot, little Draco hugging the toy dog and little Harry the dragon.  He crawled into bed, and promptly fell asleep.  Harry woke up when Draco crawled into his bed.
“Not really.” Harry didn’t want to tell his friends where he’d been today.  They didn’t know that he was seeing Malfoy for work, let alone voluntarily spending time at the Manor.  Ron, in particular, was still very angry about the war.  Not that Harry could blame him.  Fred’s death had hit the whole Weasley family hard.  Hermione was more reasonable, usually, but he knew that anything involving the blonde Slytherin was likely to cause her temper to flare too.
Harry just sat there in stunned silence.  Draco could practically see the cogs whirring in his head. Eventually Harry spoke. “Draco… I don’t know what to say.”  It wasn’t the most forthcoming of statements, but it was words, which was a start.
The storm was still raging outside and the two of them were curled up on the sofa under a heavy blanket, clothes abandoned around the room.  It was well after midnight.
“Blaise it was awful.  I was awful.  I should have refused.”  Draco managed to croak out.  “I don’t deserve you here trying to comfort me.  You should go find him.  He deserves you more.”  Draco’s thoughts felt disjointed.  “The look he gave me when he saw me next to Pansy.  I don’t think he knew which one of us sent the trip jinx.  But it wasn’t me.  I promise it wasn’t me.  Everything is starting to hurt.”  It felt like someone was squeezing something in his chest with bruising force and he felt himself starting to panic.  “What if they expel him?  He can’t leave the school.  I need him…”
“Yeah it was.  Let’s go in properly and we’ll raid the whiskey and get dry.  Or if you’d prefer, I can go down to the wine cellar and grab a bottle.”
It was more difficult for Blaise to go to Grimmauld and let someone in than Harry, but Harry didn’t protest.  Harry used his wand on the inside of his forearm, to draw out a small phial of his blood.  He handed over both the wand and phial to Blaise.  He needed both to allow Narcissa in through the wards at Grimmauld without Harry there; it wouldn’t work for anyone who wasn’t a Black being let in, but it should for Narcissa.  Or at least he hoped it would. Harry didn’t want to leave Draco’s side again.  When Blaise left, Harry and Draco were curled up in bed together.
“Harry, you have a pack of future brother in laws sat downstairs waiting for you to come down to breakfast.  This afternoon you are marrying their sister.  What the damn hell did you think was going to happen this morning?  That everything would change, and we could suddenly be together.  The Weasleys would have no compunction about lynching me if they knew I was in here.” Draco said this through gritted teeth.  Harry knew what he said was true. Today was the day the world would see him marry the girl everyone always expected him to.  It wasn’t what he wanted though.  What he wanted was impossible.
“Sod off, Malfoy.”  Harry chuckled in amusement, glad that Draco had bounced back from his near panic attack.  He heard Draco leave the room, and Harry continued putting the breakfast together, grabbing the smoked salmon from the magically cooled cabinet that served as a fridge.  Until he had moved in with Blaise and Draco, Harry hadn’t really understood the magical adaptations to kitchens.  He’d never bothered using the one at Grimmauld place, and usually relied Kreacher, takeaways or going to the Weasleys.  There was something depressing about cooking for one, so he’d avoided it.  Living with Draco and Blaise though, he found his love for cooking.  Making food for people you cared about and seeing them enjoy it was a very different experience to being forced to cook for the Dursley’s as a child.  Draco reappeared dressed smartly in a pair of grey trousers and a shirt with the sleeves rolled up, just as Harry laid the two plates on the counter.  He eased himself up onto one of the stools with only a slight wince where the movement sent a jab of pain through slowly healing ribs.  After they had finished Draco went and grabbed some towels and a bowl of warm water and set up one of the stools so that he could try and fix Harry’s hair.  Harry relaxed as Draco’s skilled fingers washed his hair and massaged his head.  Harry hadn’t noticed how bad the headache had gotten until it started to ease under Draco’s ministrations.   When his hair was clean and conditioned, Draco proceeded to use his wand to carefully style Harry’s hair into something that hopefully didn’t resemble a train wreck.  Grooming charms were some of the few pieces of magic Draco ever did these days.  When he was done applying the final product of what felt like a hundred to Harry, Draco took a step back, nodded in satisfaction, before kissing Harry on the forehead.
“So, you sneaking out on my little sister.  Do I need to sit down and give you the big brother talk?”  ‘Shit’, Harry thought to himself.
“I guess.  I just would have liked to know before now.” Pansy pouted.   “Please tell me about the close-run thing.  It’ll make me feel better.”
“…Sirius fell through the veil and then I was chasing Bellatrix Lestrange.  She was mocking me about Sirius’ death. I tried to cast the Cruciatus curse on her, but it didn’t work.  I wanted to cause her as much pain as I felt but it still didn’t work.  Then Voldemort appeared, and then Dumbledore. The two of them fought.  They destroyed most of the Ministry atrium.  At some point in the battle Voldemort tried to possess me.  It felt horrible and invasive and wrong and…”
“Very well.  If you can get in contact with his mind-healer I think that would be the most useful.  You can stay as long as you need, obviously.  I’ll go grab Mr Potter one of the stronger calming draughts.  He’s not on anything that might interfere with them, right?”
“If you think it’s best to talk to your mother first, I’ll accept it.” Harry conceded.  “And I was thinking about going with Henry.  At least it won’t seem too odd if people call me Harry then.”
“I can’t.  They’re… They’re all wrong.  Everything is all wrong” Draco looked close to tears.  “Everyone hates me.  They’ll think it’s brilliant that I’m killed by taking these…
“Nothing, for the time being.  I want to take some time to decide what I really want to do with my life.”
Harry closed his eyes then.  Picturing Draco carving their names into the wooden pillar in the far corner of the room.  Seeing the two of them curled up under the large silver and green blanket Draco had brought down there.  Harry thought back on these happier memories of the room.  He told Doris about all of this.  Trying to work his way up to the fight and the pain that room flooded him with now when he thought of it.  Although he and Draco had shared a bedroom in eighth year, they had both been too scared to do much there.  The proximities of their respective friends, and their propensity to come in without knocking made it too high risk.  Instead they had used a series of empty classrooms around the castle before stumbling on the long-abandoned room near the kitchens.  Draco’s transfigurations skills meant that they had been able to make the room relatively comfortable, and they had managed to sneak a few pillows and the large blanket down not long after they had claimed the room as their own.  Down there they could lock the door, knowing that no-one would disturb them.  This room was their safe haven to touch and talk in without having to put up guards.  Draco had carved their initials into the pillar just before the Easter Holidays using Harry’s wand and not wearing anything, whilst Harry had been lying exhausted on the sofa completely spent by their afternoon’s actives.  That was one of the best memories.  Two weeks later it had all gone wrong.
A disturbance upstairs told them that Teddy was awake, and Harry went up to get him.  He was greeted with a rather slobbery kiss from the toddler.
“You said blood wards.  Your aunt would have been able to take you from the step in the morning.  That’s what likely linked the wards to her.  But you’re definitely the closest blood relation to you.  You could pick yourself up and then the wards would attach themselves to your blood.  You could pick up baby Harry and we could take him away.  He’ll never see the inside of that house.”
“Maybe.”  Lily knew it wasn’t just his father and Callie’s relationship he was thinking about as he said this.  It was his own relationship.  The one he had with his little sister and how it would be different if she were daughter.  She knew he was still a little conflicted over their decision, but she also knew they’d made the right one.  She knew whenever she received letters from Scorpius telling her all about his studies.  She knew when she was able to hang out with her friends and stress over exams rather than managing sleepless nights and potty training.  Mostly she knew when she saw the little girl with their Fathers’ and the love between them.
“Tank you, Blaise.”  Teddy says, in the politest tone the toddler can manage.  It makes all of the adults smile.
Harry felt guilty.  Extremely guilty.  Sirius had been so good to him, cared for him whilst he was sick, and he’d just abandoned him without a word at Christmas.  He needed to talk to Sirius and explain.  He didn’t know how it was possible though.  Umbridge had blocked all ways of communication from them.  He didn’t want to talk to Hermione and Ron about Sirius though.  The only people he wanted to talk about his godfather to were Blaise and Draco.  He shied away from the topic and Instead he talked about the other point Hermione had made.
“Me and Draco will be just fine without you.  We’re perfectly capable of not killing each other if left to our own devices.”
Draco shoved Harry off the stool he was sat on.  “I think that means me.  You’re very bossy for someone who isn’t talking.”  It pleased Harry.  The more bossy and playful Draco got the closer he was to speaking again, and although Harry would happily accept Draco like this if he never recovered further, he still missed the sound of his lover’s voice.  Even if it meant a return to the arguments and teasing that came along with it.
“Then why did you come with me, and then put the potion on your hand, without any guarantee it was safe?”  Actually that was a fair point.  Why did Potter trust him with this?  For that matter, why did Draco decide to help Potter in the first place?  And why did his hand feel better when Potter applied the potion to his own hand.  Draco had a bad feeling.
“Yeah, so shoot me.”  Harry replied.  “Do you think it was worth it?  Given all the trouble it’s causing.”
“If we thought that Blaise was in that kind of danger then would either of us hesitate for even a second to go and try and rescue him.  Sirius had the potential to be like Blaise.  He never got to be.  But he could have been. Maybe not exactly the same, but just as important.  I don’t blame you for going there.  Trick or not.  It would have been unbearable.”  Draco said, eyes a blaze with conviction.  “Sirius may have only been yours, but he could have been ours, like Blaise is.  And we could have been his.  You are not to blame.”
“It’s okay love.  You go back through the fire to mum and tell her I’m coming.  I’ll get dressed and be right behind you.”
“Harry Potter…  Is that really you?”  Flitwick eventually managed to say.  Of course it would be him who was addressed first.
“Don’t worry about it, Son…”  His Father seemed to forcibly change the tone of his voice from the depressed depreciating tone he’d had before he spoke again.  The chirpiness was definitely forced and sounded wrong in the context of the conversation they’d been having but Scorpius had no idea what to do about it.  His Father continued speaking.  “Let’s go to the hospital wing.  You have some more serious conversations ahead of you and only so much time to have them in.”
Draco was sitting in the common room lazing on the sofa reading a shitty novel when there was a sharp pain in his hand.  He jolted up, looking down at the offending limb, but there was nothing wrong with it.  Just as the pain was easing off it started again.  ‘What the actual fuck was going on’, Draco thought to himself.  He tried to settle back down with his book.  For over an hour he tried to concentrate and ignore what was happening.  It was no good, the pain was getting steadily worse.  In between the sharp bursts it was now throbbing unbearably.  Still when he examined his hand, it seemed perfectly fine and none of the healing balms or spells he tried had any effect.
The meeting with Narcissa went better than Harry expected.  When he’d walked into the room, she’d looked shocked, but quickly schooled her expression, although not without a telling look towards Draco.  He’d obviously not told his mother who exactly was coming.  Once the initial awkwardness had passed, they’d all sat and eaten the light meal the elves had brought and made small talk about the various places Harry and Draco had been, as part of the muggle integration programme.  Harry had excused himself and Draco not long before 7pm, saying that they had an outing planned for this evening.  Narcissa had kissed Draco goodbye, and then surprised Harry by kissing each of his cheeks as well, telling him that he was welcome here whenever he wished.  Leaving the Manor, the two of them had made several apparition jumps around the country, before reaching the cinema they usually went to.  It was in one of their favourite towns in the Cotswolds.  The building was art deco, with a sculpted façade of dancing silver naked ladies above the entrance.  When Draco had first seen the place, he’d been fascinated by it.  He wanted to bring the elves there so they could see and create something similar in the Manor.  Harry had managed to persuade him not to, but only on the promise that they bring a camera and take photos for them soon.  He wanted his very own Odeon room at the Manor.  They didn’t have a camera with them today though, they were mostly just here to be together.  They ended up watching a very unrealistic film about two witches and a family curse.  They shared a large pick and mix, and Draco had amused Harry the whole way through with his comments, making him glad the theatre was mostly empty, and they didn’t have angry patrons trying to enjoy the film shushing them.  They walked out into the dark street once the film was finished.   Harry knew that they should go home, but he wasn’t ready for the day to be over.  He needed more time with Draco.
“Sorry, I never got your letters.  Um… there was a thing and I’ve been here for the last week.”  The block on letters was definitely a significant inconvenience of the ward.
“That’s all right, Harry dear.  I understand.”  Andromeda replied, standing up so she was no longer crouched in front of her sister’s chair.
“For the same reason I never loose my wallet or keys when you can’t go a day without wondering round the house in frustration having misplaced your handbag.  It’s just how it is. I get this, you get to be able to read, absorb and understand the multitudes of books and facts that just go over my head.  I don’t get why Harry thought that was such a major event though, other than it probably being the only time Malfoy was ever spotted in a wizarding area after the war.  Unless Harry was already with the bastard.”
“I know.”  Harry felt completely disheartened.  He didn’t know what he could say to make this better.  This was the entire problem with their relationship.  It worked perfectly within their little bubble, but any hint of the outside world and it cracked.
“They won’t.  They all have this idea of me, and I’m not allowed to step out of the lines of their expectations.  I’d rather leave them all behind.  I don’t know how much longer I can manage like this.”
“Sure, sure.  Head back and I’ll be there in…let’s say 10 minutes. I just need to get rid of my house guest.”
“What husband are you on currently?  You have to be approaching Blaise’s mum in number of ex-husbands now!”
“Well if that’s all, I should probably go.”  Draco started to stand, but Harry grabbed his wrist to stop him.  He needed the mask to drop.  He couldn’t have his last interaction be with the ice dragon he was currently confronted with.   He wanted to see the real Draco.  Only getting half the man wasn’t enough.  The problem was, he didn’t know whether anything would ever be enough.
“Like you’re one to talk Mum.  It’s not like you exactly planned to get pregnant with my little half sibling there.  You’re such a fucking hypocrite.”
“Shit, I’m getting blood and tears all over you as well now.”  Blaise said when he looked up from Tara’s shoulder, although feeling better for crying.
“They have an 8-week notice period on a rolling contract currently, would you like for me to write to them to day to commence this period.”
“Cussin Cake.”  Teddy says softly, hugging Draco fiercely.  In the instinctive way small children and animals sometimes can, he knew his cousin needed comfort.
“We should head back.  Shower here or in the dorms?”  Blaise asked.  The room answered for them, vanishing the door to the bathroom.  “Dorms it is.”  Blaise grinned.
She saw her Dad flinch slightly at the spiteful words she’d thrown at him before he calmly continued to talk to her.  “I know you’re upset, sweetheart.  But it’s not like that.  Your mum loves you very much, so do I.  There are somethings I still need to explain, and I hate seeing you hurting like this.  You’re my baby girl and I want you to be happy.”
“Al?...Are you in there?”  Scorpius said, knocking on the curtains.  In reply the curtains opened slightly, and Scorpius took it as an invite to come in. Al was sat with his knees pulled into his chest.  He looked like he might have been crying earlier.  “Al, are you okay?”
“My feet are really starting to bug me now.  Where is Blaise… he needs to do something to fix it.”  Draco whined slightly.
“Blaise.  You holding Draco’s hand feels nice.  If he didn’t want to do it, then it would be making at least one, if not both, of us feel ill.”  Harry answered.
“She probably would.  But my family aren’t the deciding factor here.  My mother knows I’m gay and any marriage I have with a woman will be one of convenience.  If I told her I wanted to marry a man then she’d accept that, even if it would be more difficult and mean going against tradition.  You being that man wouldn’t be a problem either.  She likes you well enough and have more than enough prospects from her point of view.”
They didn’t get a choice in the matter.   As they were making their mind up to escape into the winding and moving corridors of Hogwarts, the doors to the Great Hall creaked open and Professor Flitwick walked out.  He stood there, frozen in shock, when he caught sight of them.  The five of them looked between each other nervously, unsure as to how their old professor would react.
“Yeah.  If I’m going to live there, I thought it would be better if the place actually looked like a home.”
“Hey, don’t be melancholy, this is a happy day.”  She teased and took his hand in hers and squeezed in affectionately.
Draco was asleep, curled up in the hospital bed.  Harry and Blaise were still awake though.  Harry sat on Blaise’s lap in one of the comfortable armchairs in the room.
“Of course it does.  I made it.  I’m hardly going to skimp on the good stuff when the only thing that stops my hand hurting is making yours feel better.”
By the time he finished the last cigarette, he’d reached Tower Bridge.  He’d gone over what Pansy had said so many times in his head it hurt.  He started across the bridge, towards the nearest of the towers and the apparition point through a hidden door.  He knew what he needed to do.  It was what he had been so reluctant to do all his life.  He’d spent too many years being told to ‘make no noise and pretend he wasn’t there’.  He’d learnt young and well to supress his feelings, outburst of anger being the only real exception.  That he wasn’t worthy of getting what he really wanted.  The war and its aftermath had amplified this, and he’d spent years pushing away or avoiding anything that might have made him truly happy.  Now he knew that all that had led to was his own misery, and worse, pain for someone he loved.  He hadn’t lied when he said wouldn’t have changed things if it meant that he didn’t have his kids, but he couldn’t help but wonder about the life he could have had.  If he’d had the courage to follow Draco to that bathroom instead of sending Pansy like the coward he was.  Would he have got there soon enough to stop Draco?  If not, could he have been the one who supported Draco through everything.  Openly and not in secret.  Could they have had a happy life together?  Would they have had their own kids running around the Manor or Grimmauld.  Would they be the ones who’d wondered round London enjoying the sites and laughing at each other’s antics.  He couldn’t change the past, but he could change the future, or at least try.  He wouldn’t let his own stupid hang ups and fears keep from telling Draco how he really felt.  This time he would make him believe.  Make him see past the insecurities that caused to Draco put his defences up.  Insecurities that Harry had known were there but kept on choosing to ignore.
Justin didn’t know what to say.  He was intrigued by this confident young man, and it was completely separate from the intrigue that came from the connection to Harry Potter and his husband.  From the moment he had first seen Teddy Lupin in the park, Justin had wanted to get to know him.  He wasn’t sure exactly why, but there was something about the wizard who laughed with and teased the Saviour of the wizarding world and Death Eater like it was nothing.  It was bewitching.  Which was why he found himself saying yes and following the man to the bar.
“If it were different you might never have ended up here, and I know I wouldn’t change that for anything.  Draco wouldn’t either, you know.”
Blaise immediately abandons his task and runs to the potions cupboard.  Usually they have calming draughts scattered throughout the house, but with Teddy staying, they had stored them away securely.
“Sorry honey, we seem to be all out”.  There was a slight look of disappointment on Lily’s face, but she carried on making the toast.  She had cut the loaf of fresh white bread into thick slices.  Al and James could devour a loaf by themselves.  When the first four slices came out of the toaster Harry put a warming charm over them.
“Biscuits.  We were running low.  And they won’t be out of the oven for another 10 minutes, and then they have to cool before I can finish them.”  Draco replied, knowing Harry would want to eat the hot shortbread as soon as it came out of the oven.
“Harry, it didn’t look like nothing, and since then you’ve changed.  We’ve all noticed.  You’ve been avoiding everyone.  I think I’m the only one of the family that’s seen you since New Year, and even I’ve barely spoken to you.  And frankly, you look an absolute mess.  Ron says Grimauld looks pretty bad too, from what he’s seen from the floo when he’s tried to call you.   I think it has something to do with what I saw.  Harry, I don’t think that was the first time you and Malfoy have ever been … in that situation.”
“Harry, how are you doing?  I’m so sorry I didn’t tell you about Lee and Ginny.  It’s just… it wasn’t my place to spill their secret. “
“That’s… I saw him trying to sneak out of the house that morning.  I told how happy I was about the two of them.  I even teased him about mum finding out about him spending the night in Gin’s room.  Why didn’t he just tell me?”
It was pouring with rain the day he made his way to her office.  His mood, that already wasn’t brilliant that morning, was further depressed by the prospect of getting cold and wet walking through London.  In an attempt to minimise his exposure to the weather, rather than apparating into one of the wizarding areas nearby, he apparated straight into Bloomsbury, aiming for one of the alleys opposite the hospital.  The alley he apparated into was empty as he cracked into the space under a disillusionment charm.  He was lucky and there were no smokers there to disturb.  The weather had obviously dissuaded them from that particular habit.  Removing the charm, he exited the alley and walked across the street into the hospital.  Even the short walk had soaked Draco through to his underwear.  He hated the feeling of wet socks in his shoes.  Draco was already starting to feel like the day was against him.  To sour things further it took nearly a quarter of an hour before the 3
“Again, be grateful for my pure-blood training.  We can shove up the one of the family wards.  Doesn’t matter what enchantments they’ve got over the place, they’ll all be overridden.  Using those no one but the people we invite will be able to access the property.”
The four of them, two teens and two babies, were sat in the café between the Regent arcade and Cavendish house.  Little Draco was sat on Harry’s lap, whilst little Harry was with Draco.  For some reason mini-Draco had quickly become incredibly attached to Harry, whilst Draco was clearly little Harry’s favourite.  They’d spent the morning wandering around shops and buying whatever Draco took a fancy to.  Draco had even managed to make sure Harry made good on his promises of the morning, and Harry was now sporting a new haircut.   Harry still thought Eighties fashion was weird but Draco had eagerly embraced it, and the style he’d chosen for Harry suited him. Strangely enough, his slightly wild hair lent itself to what was considered fashion right now.  Harry didn’t mind the music so much though – as long as they stuck to the muggle stuff.  It seemed wizarding music was pretty awful no matter what era.  Or at least he thought most of it was okay.  The Birdie song had been on the radio the other day and Sirius had then proceeded to torture all of them by singing it over and over to the babies.  They didn’t seem to mind it, little Harry had in fact just giggled at his Pafoo’s antics.  But older Harry and Draco had seriously considered murdering Sirius before the day was out.  There were also a couple of pairs of glasses being made for him that would be ready in a few weeks.  Harry was definitely looking forward to getting those.  His prescription hadn’t been updated since he’d gone to Hogwarts and the Dursley’s no longer had his school breathing down their necks about getting his eyes tested.  Draco had also insisted that he not just pick from the NHS frames, as he’d always done before – heaven forbid the Dursleys pay anything for his glasses – so his new glasses were going to be a lot nicer than his current ones.
‘No.  You have to let them do this to me.  You have to let them sentence me.  You can go to Blaise.  You and him can be happy together.’
The phone turned on after 10 minutes charging.  Ron and Hermione sat on the floor, the phone still attached to the wall, whilst they looked through its contents.  They looked at the last message received first, the one that triggered him leaving.   It was confusing.  It was the only contact Harry had ever had from that number and the message didn’t tell them anything.  Obviously, whomever sent it assumed that Harry would know who it was from and what it meant.  They could tell the three words ‘
Draco looked appalled at the suggestion.  Harry stared at him wide eyed and pleading.  He needed Draco to do this.  Eventually Draco nodded.  Harry and Draco handed their wands over and Sirius stood there watching with narrowed eyes, as if expecting this all to be a trick, or an elaborate joke.  Harry didn’t blame him.  If he were in Sirius’ position, he wouldn’t have trusted them either.
They were all sat at their own house tables for dinner.  Although the houses often mixed tables for breakfast they nearly always spent dinner separated.  Scorpius kept catching Lily’s eye across the room.  They’d made plans to meet up straight after dinner.  Scorpius had mentioned to Rosie quietly earlier, that her and Al’s prefect rounds might want to avoid their usual hangout spot that evening.  Lily had said she’d ask Hugo to keep the others away as well.  Scorpius didn’t fancy and an embarrassing interruption again.  Scorpius had finished eating and was just getting up to leave when he saw his head of house coming towards him and Al.  He sat back down.  Looking over to the Gryffindor table, he could see Professor Longbottom, who was head of Gryffindor, going up to Lily and then James.
“Tara, how’re you doing?  Looking lovely as ever.”  Harry said with a smile, hugging her briefly and kissing both of her cheeks.
“Harry… I don’t think there is another way.  If we leave him out of the room then the spell will pull the horcrux anyway and it’ll hurt him.  Just like it did before.  And I’ll have to hold the spell a lot longer.  Me and Siri will be there just to protect him.  He’ll be in a powerful protective circle.  He’ll be safe.  Or as safe as he could possibly be.  If there was any other way.  Harry, we need to get those things out of the two of you.  We’re doing this for Harry.  Not to him.”  Remus said.
“Susan is working for her father in an estate agent up near Kings Cross.  She seems to like working there.  I’ve never really seen the appeal of working full stop, but each to their own.  She did tell me an interesting story whilst she was over for dinner last weekend though, about a certain untidy black-haired Gryffindor.  I’m sure you know who I mean.”  Pans raised her eyebrows and looked at him pointedly as she said this.  Draco didn’t dignify her with a response, not that she expected one.
“This one is a child and adolescent therapist.  Doris thought it was better if I sent Scorpius to someone that specialised in young people.”
“Hey, you look like you’ve seen a ghost again?”  Despite her resolve to stray strong, memories had hit Hermione again, walking into this place, but she had a better handle on herself this time and didn’t think she was going to faint.
“Yuck.”  Draco exclaimed pulling them apart.  “Remind me to cast a cleaning charm before we fall asleep next time.”
“You have been rambling, but I like it.  And I think I get it.  You’re saying, let’s not try and avoid the mountains being together will no doubt bring.  Let’s help each other climb up them so we can share the enjoyment of the view from the top.”
Draco looked over to the dark-haired man lying next to him.  This man, lying reading in the sun, bore almost no resemblance to the exhausted, drained, wreck, who’d run off with him.  Thinking back, Draco knew that he’d looked no better then, either.  That first night at Blaise’s, after they’d given their host the low down on what they’d done and assured him that there was no way of tracing them to his, they’d practically crawled into one of the guest bedrooms.  They had spent a day running on nerves and adrenaline and when they’d finally stopped, they’d collapsed, completely exhausted.  Their nerves had still been on edge though, resulting in them both waking in the early hours, reaching for each other.  They had taken comfort in each other’s bodies.  Needing to reassure each other that this was real.  Eventually they’d fallen back to sleep, wrapped in each other’s arms.  At breakfast, the following morning, Blaise had teased both of them about how shit they looked.  Draco just shook his head and rolled his eyes at this, and Harry had thrown a piece of toast at him, complete with jam.  The resulting food fight had them all in hysterics.  Blaise managed in one night with refuge, a poor joke and some thrown food to secure the friendship with Harry that Draco had longed for when he’d first arrived at Hogwarts.  He almost wished he could go back and tell his younger self this, but when he looked over at Harry and saw the love in his eyes, he realised he wouldn’t change what they had now, however difficult it had been over the years.  They’d stayed at Blaise’s nearly a week before deciding what to do with themselves, recuperating in his beautiful home.  They’d scoured the papers daily to reassure themselves that no one had picked up on their trail.  After that week they’d started on their world adventure, going anywhere and everywhere they fancied.  Blaise had joined them occasionally.  Sometimes allowing himself to be seen with Draco, to try and give the impression they were travelling together.  Most of the time though, it was just him and Harry.  Draco knew they’d have to stop soon though, travelling was wonderful, but if they were going to make a life together, at some point they needed to stop.  They couldn’t spend the rest of their lives travelling, despite how tempting it was.  There were things they needed to do if they were going to ensure that they stayed hidden longer.  He was worried that if they continued the way they were, eventually someone would spot Harry.  Neither of them wanted that to happen, the fallout of Harry’s disappearance alone would be catastrophic; that he was with Draco would only make it worse.  That was why he’d suggested coming to this island.  It was going to be their last stop before they decided what they were going to do with the rest of their lives.
Harry had to force himself to let the words wash over him like they meant nothing.  To pretend that he hated Draco as much as they did.  He wanted to disapparate straight out of there.  Straight to the Manor.  Straight to Draco.  He wanted to tell him how brave he was for coming here.  That he was proud of him.  Instead he had to put up with an hour of his friends’ derogatory commentary about the Death Eater that escaped Azkaban.  When he finally managed to escape them, he felt disgusted at himself.  He’d had to say that bumping into Draco had ruined his day in order to be allowed to leave early. It wasn’t even a lie, but that made it worse.  Seeing Draco like that had completely wrecked any attempt he might have made to be happy hanging out with his friends.  It just wasn’t in the way they all assumed.
Draco didn’t have the will or the energy to resist.  If he was being honest with himself, he wanted nothing more than to curl up in bed with Harry.
“Then show me.  This is more important than what the Ministry thinks is good or evil.  The Ministry approves Umbridge and we all know she’s a slimy evil little toad.”
“Yes.”  There was nothing else Blaise could say.  He couldn’t lie about this to Harry.  There was no way to soften the blow.
“Are you sure?”  Harry asked coyly moving his hands to Draco waist and pulling them tightly together.  Draco could feel his traitorous body responding, despite how tired he was, as Harry kissed him.
“It will work better if the little ones’ blood is used too.”  Harry’s face fell.  Draco spoke again before Harry could object.  “Only a drop.  Having two versions of us muddies things, but if their blood is used too it will counteract that.”
Hermione got up and followed the boy into the house.  His comment about the milk was interesting.  It told her that the house was almost definitely in the same state it had been in when her and Ron had left it for the last time, the day they’d entered the attic room.
“We couldn’t get in contact with you and when we went to Grimmauld to check on you, like Ron told you we would, you weren’t there.”
“Fuck!” Harry shouted to the empty house before swallowing the last of his drink.  Things were meant to be easier now Voldemort was gone, instead he was a mess who felt hollow around everyone but the stupid blonde Slytherin.  Before he’d started going to the Manor, he’d thought he was coping well with everything, but looking back he knew he hadn’t been.  Every week that passed following the final battle, he felt a little less like the person he used to be.  He was tempted to get another drink but decided against it and headed up to bed.  That night his dreams were filled with the blonde man.  The two of them dancing together in the library, smiling and laughing at each other.  The walls sparkled with glittery paint.  Sunlight streamed in through the open curtains.  A cold swept through the room, the atmosphere changing dramatically.  The curtains closed themselves with no warning, and the room was plunged into darkness.  He could feel people around them watching.  They weren’t smiling.  They were glaring.  Harry could feel fear pouring off the man in his arms.  He tried to place himself between the hostile crowd, which was getting larger and larger, and the frightened man.  Then the people in the crowd were grabbing at him, dragging him away.  The mob was shouting at the blonde man curled up at the floor.  He tried to free himself, to go back and protect the man on the floor but there were too many of them.  There was a flash of green light and a scream.
“I love you too, but it’s bedtime now.”  Draco replied, noticing the gleam in Harry’s eyes.  “And not that kind of bedtime.  It’s time to sleep.  I’m exhausted.”
Scorpius burst into tears.  The last time he’d cried had been at his mother’s funeral.  He couldn’t help crying then, with the fresh burst of grief and seeing the stoic pained looking on his father’s face.  He couldn’t help these tears either.  These tears weren’t fuelled by grief though, rather stress, guilt and uncertainty over what would happen finally bursting through the dam he’d tried to build to be strong for Lily.  Scorpius wasn’t sure how it happened, but Al’s arms were around him, wrapping him in the blanket and pulling him onto the sofa.  Scorpius just sobbed and shivered while his best friend let him.  Al sat at quietly next to him, clutching his hand to let him know that he wasn’t alone.  The shivering stopped first, then the tears.  Scorpius still stayed silent, knees pulled up to his chest, eyes closed, and one hand clenched in Al’s. He felt Al move to kneel in front of him and move his legs so that they were no longer blocking his face.  It was a position that he’d taken with Lily when she’d been upset before.  With her it had been an intimate position.  But this was Al and he knew that Al wasn’t thinking about intimacy.  That wasn’t something the two of them felt for each other.  It was friendship, pure and simple.
“I’d just try not to think about it too much.  Thinking about parents that way with anyone is a good way to traumatise yourself for life.”
Scorpius hadn’t told his father that the reason that he wanted to come here today, was because he had plotted with Al.  Normally his Father insisted on going school shopping as soon as the Hogwarts letter with the booklist came.  This year Scorpius had managed to procrastinate and delay the trip in order to go the same day Al had said he was going.  He knew neither Father, nor Al’s Dad would agree to go on the same day.  During the brief encounters he had observed between the two of them, Scorpius could see the animosity on their faces.
“Sorry for interrupting.  I didn’t realise Harry wasn’t alone.  George is about to set off the first fireworks.  Do you need a few minutes?” Angelina’s eyes darted down to the very obvious bulge in Draco’s trousers.  Harry’s own erection was only not visible to her by the virtue of him being sat down, with the arm of the chair blocking her view of that area.
Scorpius felt life couldn’t get more perfect than those first few weeks of term, despite the amount of homework the Professors were piling on them.  Over the next two weeks however, things started changing.  Lily stopped wanting to spend time alone with him.  At first, she just kept insisting that they should spend more time studying, managing to keep Hugo with her at all times, so she was never alone.  When he tried to talk to her about it, she’d just kiss him and tell him everything was okay and that she was just stressed with the amount of work she had to do for a transfiguration project she’d been set.  Something about the tone of her voice and the way she would avoid looking at him when she said this made Scorpius think that she wasn’t telling him the whole truth.  Then he’d noticed her looking unwell at mealtimes, often running out of the Great Hall before even managing to eat.  Hugo would normally follow after her, but when Scorpius tried to find out where she was going, following them out of the hall, the younger boy would tell him to go away and that Lily didn’t want to see him right then and that she’d talk to him soon.  Scorpius was sure it must be something he’d done wrong, but he just wasn’t sure what it could be, and no amount of quizzing Hugo got him any answers.
“Sirius, you’ll be fine.  Me and mother will be with you.  And when we all get back here this evening, Harry will be waiting with the mini duo.”  Draco reassured.
“We should get the wards on this place set up.  It shouldn’t take long.  Then I think we should nap for an hour.  We can get Tawly to wake us.”
“Hello, Dobby.  Is there any chance you can tell us where Mother is?”  Draco replied to the little excitable elf.
“You’re meant to be resting.” Ron was now sounding almost as cross as Harry felt.  “And it wasn’t just that you weren’t there.  None of your stuff is there.”
Narcissa apparated away, presumably to Grimmauld Place, and Harry raced back to the house.  Andi and Teddy were in the living room with Mary Poppins playing from where they’d left off yesterday.  There were penguins dancing on the screen and Teddy was in hysterics at Dick Van Dyke with his trousers pulled down doing a penguin impression.  Harry passed them by and headed to the bedroom, where Draco was lying in Blaise’s arms.
Lucius’s eyes went wide with fear.  “They…. But they can’t… he was a child.  Everything he did was to ….”
Harry kissed the blond man, pouring every feeling he’d had over the night into the kiss.  He dragged Draco to his feet and pulled him toward the bed.
“Yeah.  Maybe my hands will behave better tomorrow.  I can’t see me getting that bloody passage right today.”
“Why shouldn’t I be angry with you?” Draco’s shoulders slumped and his tone didn’t match his words.  It didn’t hold any of the fury that had been directed at the furniture minutes ago.  It was sad.  It spoke of pain and despair.
“I’ll buy you five new ties.  Now go pick a crap film whilst I order fish and chips and open a bottle.”
“I like sweets.  And trust you to notice.  Stalker.” Draco stuck his tongue out at Harry, and he had to fight the urge to giggle.  “Go on then, what fabulous new thing are you going to show me today?”
Harry and Draco debated bringing up the horcruxes over breakfast the next morning, but decided against it.  It would be better to have this discussion with the babies safely tucked up in bed.  Instead it was with all of the adults sat round the fire with a drink that Harry and Draco brought it up.  Remus and Narcissa both looked horrified, whilst Sirius ended up spitting up the mouthful of whiskey he’d just taken out and spraying it all over Remus, who was sitting next to him.
“Do you feel up to explaining?” Blaise asked gently, shifting himself and Harry so Harry was sat between his legs and could lean back on him.  He wrapped his arms around the dark-haired boy.  Draco sat up too and leant against Blaise’s side, tangling his hands in Harry’s.
Scorpius began kissing her again.  Slowly and tenderly at first, then with more passion.  His body was pressed into hers, one hand was on her breast, the other still on her hip.  He was moving, creating friction between the two of them.  She could feel how hard he was in his trousers.
Andromeda smiled at the little boy fondly.  “I’m sure Blaise won’t mind. Now can you give me a big hug and a kiss before I go?”
Harry felt extremely resistant about doing so, but knew they wouldn’t drop it unless he told them something.
“Then I followed you out and asked, ‘to bum a fag’.” Harry laughed at the memory.  “Merlin, what I would have done had Ron not come and interrupted us.  You sat next to me in the pub made me want you so much.”
“All his stuff is packed in the buggy.  And I’ll be here at 5pm, for dinner.  Make sure he goes down for his nap at 2.30pm, otherwise he’ll be miserable all afternoon.  I can’t think of anything else….”
“I didn’t realise… I assumed you were awful to him….”  Harry said sheepishly.  Draco may be his friend now, but a lot of his old assumptions about the blond who used to bully him were still there in his head.
“Yes.  How did you know it was me?  We’ve never met.” Draco hadn’t been expecting this on the doorstep.  He’d hoped to get inside before he told her who he was.  No escaping it now though, he just needed to continue on.  It wasn’t the end of the world.
“Andi!” Harry jumped up in surprise.  He hadn’t noticed her approaching.  Teddy hid his face in her shoulder, shy and nervous around the strangers.
“Me too.  I feel like any second someone’s going to see us and shout that Harry Potter is walking down the street with Draco Malfoy.  That they’ll drag us off and keep us apart.”
The three of them poured over the book for an hour, before they decided that they had the details of the ward straight.  They’d have to sort the illusion charm another night, as it was already past 1am, and they guessed it would be another pre 6am wake up.
“I don’t really fancy walking back up that hill, it was hard enough coming down.  Why we had to end up back in a winter where it is actually bloody cold and snowy rather than the usual mild drizzle I don’t know.  It was one thing up in Scotland to have weather like this, but not here.”
“Fine.  I’m not happy, but fine.  Just please promise me that if you’re in any kind of trouble you’ll tell me.  I want to help.  I’m your friend and I can keep your secrets.”
“There was a portrait in the Ravenclaw common room of Rowena wearing it.  I think I can draw it.”  Sirius said, helpfully.
“That’s more like it, Potter.  Really you should be worshiping me for how fantastic a friend I am.  Who else would have opened his home to the poor Gryffindor escaping the cold hostile horror of England so he could run away with the love of his life?”
“Actually, you have to organise the funeral.  I can’t, unless we want the world to know about how close I am to Draco.  And this one…” Harry rumpled Draco’s hair, earning a scowl.  “We talked about it with Tara.  Draco decided he shouldn’t be the one trying to make decisions about this.”
The joy Harry felt at Mafloy’s words caused him to beam at the other man in happiness.  This was exactly what he’d wanted out of the day.
Hermione couldn’t help the tears pouring down her face.  He’d shown them all the years they had missed.  He had told her how he stayed hidden. Finally, Harry had told them where he lived.  He was right about it not making any difference.  This wasn’t a declaration that he wanted to rekindle their friendship.  Whatever she might wish, they had missed more than twenty years now.  She didn’t know this Harry, and from his letter and actions she didn’t think he was willing to let them get to know him now.  He’d done all he could to try and ease the hurt, and it had worked.  It had helped.  Now he was saying goodbye.  The goodbye they should have gotten when he walked out the first time.  It hurt, but not as much.  Not anymore.
“You sure?  It’s dark and shouldn’t we try and head straight back to Hogwarts, or try and get in contact with someone?”
Harry left Molly in the kitchen and went to the living room where the rest of the Weasley’s that were here had gathered.  He felt slightly proud of himself for walking away before he and Molly started truly arguing.  Everyone did fuss over Teddy, and it did take a bit of the attention off him.  Still it was loud here.  He’d almost forgotten how loud it was.
Draco looked at Harry, needing to know whether he was happy with Blaise knowing the truth of what had been going on between the two of them – or at least as much as they understood, which admittedly wasn’t a huge amount.  Harry looked over at Blaise, scrutinising him for several seconds, and then shrugged in assent.  Draco answered.  “It started back at the start of term.  Or at least that’s when I realised what was happening.  It had been happening over the summer too, but I didn’t recognise it.  Basically when one of us gets hurt, the other feels it.  It seems to extend to lack of sleep and hunger, as well as physical injuries.  At first, I thought it was one way.  Then we had that fight at the Quidditch match, and it became apparent it’s a two-way thing.  Before the fight, things actually weren’t too bad but after that Harry started ignoring me.”
The two of them quickly washed and dressed in clean clothes.  They’d fallen asleep in what they’d been wearing the day before.  When they got to the breakfast table everyone was already seated around it.  Little Harry and Draco were chattering away in their usual baby talk to each other.  Draco kissed them each on the head before kissing Narcissa on the cheek and sitting down.  Harry did the same, although he wasn’t quite sure why he kissed Narcissa on the cheek.  He barely knew Draco’s mother.  It didn’t seem to matter though, as she appeared pleased with the guesture.
“So I might be able to see Teddy?”  Harry’s smile was infectious, and Draco found himself grinning too.  The risk of being found was worth it to bring this kind of happiness to the man he loved.
“Finished the ballroom.”  Draco said enthusiastically, like a child bringing home a picture to their parents, delighted with themselves and wanting everyone to see what they achieved.  This Draco, the bubbly, happy, enthusiastic Draco, was all it took to shake away the last of the bitter mood, Harry’s day at work and meeting at the Ministry, had left him with.
“I am feeling your fucking pain. Now get your hand back in that potion before I hex it to stay there.”
“Yeah…” Harry whispered.  “It’s you…”  They were suddenly kissing passionately stood with snow up to their calves, outside a house that contained a fragment of evil.
This was precisely what he didn’t want.  He wanted a nice evening with his friends where the world could see them as they were.  He didn’t want to be displayed like a prized trophy at the front, for all to gawp at, and to have to spend his evening talking to stuffy politicians.
They sat drinking and chatting about life easily until dinner arrived.  They all stuck to easy topics until they were full, and the leftovers and dirty plates moved into the kitchen.  Harry grabbed a second bottle of wine out of the fridge, him and Hermione having finished the first, as well as a fourth beer for Ron.
“Leave the bottle.  You can leave us.”  Draco seemed to be regaining control of himself as his dismissed the house elf who quickly left. “Potter grab me my cigarettes.”
“Technically I’m not even one and a half right now according to my birth certificate.”  Malfoy said with his old drawl.  The one Harry remembered from school.  It made him happy to hear Malfoy talk like this.  Unlike every time he’d heard Draco speak like this before, he was in on the joke, instead of the butt of it.  Just like the plotting, it was much more fun to be this side of the table when it came to the sneaky blonde Slytherin.
“I guess that makes sense.  And it will be an amazing achievement.” Harry said and paused, taking a deep breath “Okay I’m ready.  Let’s go for it.  Don’t blame me if I scratch the furniture or something.”
“Come on then Daddy, your princess wants a dance and you’re not going to refuse her, are you?”  Draco said to Harry, a teasing smile on his face.
“There.”  Harry pointed and opened his eyes.  He was pointing at a floorboard in one corner of the room.  Slowly he made his way towards it.  Examining it closely he saw a small etching of a snake.  Just like the one on the sink in Moaning Myrtles bathroom.  The one that led to the chamber.
of October that Harry was finally able to get up to the school.  He had sent McGonagall a letter earlier in the week to let her know he was coming and to ask to use her floo.  Ginny and he had hashed out what he was going to say the week before, along with him letting her know that he was planning on moving out of the family home and back into Grimmauld place at the beginning of December.  Ginny was going to move back into the house then, meaning the kids could spend Christmas with both of their parents.  Harry had also had Ron and Hermione over that week.  They’d both reacted as predicted when he told them.   Letting him know that they still loved him and didn’t care what gender he found attractive.  Hermione in particular also spent a fair proportion of the conversation chastising him for not telling them earlier.  They’d all gotten very drunk that evening.
All the colour drained out of Malfoy’s face then, and he looked like he was going to faint.  That look of vulnerability was all it took for Harry to change from anger to anguish.
Blaise shook his head at the two of them.  “Very well your highness.  One bowl of popcorn coming up.”
Lying in the dorm, imagining Lily as she had been in her room, Scorpius eased off his pyjama bottoms, and allowed his hand to tease gently, before settling into a rhythm, picturing what he and Lily had done.  In no time at all he had found his release and drifted off to sleep with the girl he was sure he had fallen in love with filling his dreams.
“Yes.” Blaise admitted, though didn’t elaborate further on it.  “Harry isn’t feeling too good at the moment, so I insisted he lie down.  He wouldn’t, however, until I promised to bring you cake.”
“What the fuck?”  Malfoy said, sounding just as annoyed as the kitten had the day before when Ginny had appeared. “How the
“I know we weren’t going to, but I don’t think I actually expected him to turn up.  Watching him with Malfoy was like looking at the photos, and I just thought, what do I have to lose by talking to him.  He actually apologised, well sort of.  He did admit he behaved like a git by running, and that he probably should have trusted us.  He told me he missed me.”  That had been the bit hurt worst, looking back at the evening.  Harry had just been Harry for a while.  Awkward and missing her.
“There just isn’t much information available.  And nothing on horcruxes being kept within a living vessel.  The only way to destroy a horcrux is to destroy its container beyond magical repair.  Which means we can’t destroy the ones in you or little Harry.”
This picture is of Harry and Draco, a three-year-old Teddy held on Harry’s hip.  They are stood outside a large house smiling at each other.  On the back was written in the neat writing, the same writing as on the back of many of the photos that she assumed was Draco’s,
“Well then they don’t know that there is nothing to be done then.  I am a Black, and I am nothing if not stubborn.”
“The reason that mine and Ginny’s sex life wasn’t working was because I am gay.  The main reason I haven’t told anyone about the relationship I had back then was because it was with another man.”
Harry winced.  “Not really, once the kids were born, it sort of gradually ebbed away to special occasions only.”
“But when we talked about it, it was either getting rid of the baby or keeping it.  Not this third option.  I’d just about gotten my head around not having the baby when you threw this at me.”
“Harry, come in.  Congratulations by the way, sorry I haven’t manged to speak to you before now, I had to leave the Anniversary event early, but I was so pleased to hear about your engagement to Miss Weasley.  I know you’ve always considered the Weasleys family.  It must be wonderful to be making it official.  Have you set a date yet?”
Tom scowled at Harry.  Draco closed his eyes and looked up to the ceiling, frustrated by both Tom’s stubbornness and Harry’s ineptitude.  He loved Harry and he knew Harry had forgiven him for the little shit he’d been in school, but he didn’t think pointing this out to Tom was particularly useful.  What he’d done to Harry and what Voldemort had were eons apart.  Draco had personally tormented Harry for years out of jealousy and the indignation of having his friendship rejected.  He’d gone out of his way to make Harry’s life miserable.  And now he knew that Harry’s childhood had been as fucked up as his own, especially after the visions, which also included some of his best hits of bullying Harry, he couldn’t work out why Harry had forgiven him anymore than Tom could.  If it wasn’t for landing in this completely fucked up situation and having only each other to rely on, him and Harry getting past all of that wouldn’t have happened.  Depending on each other, and learning about their shared awful childhoods, had bridged a gap that shouldn’t have been possible.  Even in the bathroom, when Draco had gone with Harry, he had never actually expected help.  He was just desperate.  But being stuck in the past had grown that little sliver of trust they’d managed to forge back in Hogwarts in 1997 exponentially.  As far as he was concerned once Tom had split his soul then he wasn’t in complete control of what he had done, and by the time he’d tried to kill Harry, he wasn’t even human.  Those deaths weren’t the ones that Tom had to forgive himself for right now.  Those weren’t the ones that Draco could see were eating at him.  They were just the ones he was choosing to throw in their faces as they were the most personal and the most recent.
His life changed.  Slowly but surely.  He saw Blaise, and sometimes his other friends, once a week, along with his therapist, in Tuscany and started to get his own semblance of self, back together.  There was still Potter though.  Even with his ever-increasing feelings of self-worth, he wasn’t able to stay away.  The day after his third therapy session, a particularly brutal one that had left him feeling dug out and hollow, he was the one who caved and messaged.  They had met at their favourite restaurant and after a decadent meal, had relaxed in the spa.  Seeing Potter fully dressed Draco had found him hard to resist.  The swimming trunks had been too much, and before he knew what was happening, they were booking a room in the attached hotel.  The sex was still just as breath taking.  Being around Harry, close to him in any way, just as intoxicating.  One slip was all it took for them to fall back into their old patterns.  Their relationship had changed though.  He didn’t know whether it was a conscious effort on his part, but he found he was become more distant whenever they were together.  The sharing of joys, jokes, pain, and regret petered out, and at the back of his mind a clock was counting down.  Harry’s wedding was approaching.  However much he wanted the man, he knew that when Potter was married, this thing that was happening between them would have to stop.  That eventually he’d be unable to cope with the deception and secrecy, or Harry would, and they wouldn’t be able to do this any longer.
They walked slowly hand in hand to the living room.  Harry’s legs weren’t up to his usual pace, and Draco seemed determined to not let him go.  Blaise had put a pouf in front of Harry’s usual spot on the sofa so he could prop his legs up.
Harry closed his eyes.  He wanted to cry.  Draco was already hurting, and he was just making things worse.  Yes, part of the reason for him quitting his job had been because of Draco, but that was only a small fraction of it, dictating the timing but not the reasons.  Draco had been brave enough to spill the secret he’d been holding onto since that day.  He deserved no less from Harry.  So Harry spilled.  He told Draco about how bad his flashbacks had gotten at work.  How Tara had told him more than once that he wasn’t fit to work in the field.  How he’d ignored her because he was scared to leave.  So scared not to be the person the public and his friends expected him to be.
“I’m far too comfy right now to move.”  Teddy said, nuzzling into Justin’s neck.  He felt warm, a little tipsy, and completely sated.
“I know.  And I know he doesn’t love me any less just because sometimes you’re the only one who can help him.  It’s just the way it is.  Besides, you two wouldn’t cope without me in this relationship.”
“I think I’m going to ask you about that one later, Harry.  Look, come on Blaise.  We had an idea about the link and you stabilising it.”
Harry hugged both Tabitha and Hattie goodbye before heading back to the office to talk to Angelina.  As usual there was a pot of tea waiting for him as he entered.
Before Blaise could say anything else Harry quickly interrupted.  “I quit my job.  I told them why I couldn’t be an auror.”  Harry felt tears welling up in his eyes.  The break down he’d been hold back was hitting in full force now he was back with the people he felt safest with.  “I need to get some cake for Ron.  He’s waiting.”
