The walls were a light tan, with the sunlight coming through a window.
"so what is the Malfoy boy doing here. I thought we didn't like them?" Remus pushes Sirius and gives him a death stare. "what, I missed 12 years. I did my waiting 12 years-" Remus pushes him again causing Sirus to fall off his chair.
Oh, fuck no. No. No. No. There is only one explanation as to why I was in Harry Potters's body.
"yes, you idiots" Remus mutters. Both of us give him the same death glare
~~~~~
I wake up to the sounds of the door creaking open and a soft voice "Harry dear are you awake?"
"Narcissa" Dumbledor spoke. I didn't notice that the clock had hit noon. Before anyone could move to stand up, I spotted myself next to her. clearly confused at the situation and the people in front of him. Without even thinking, I ran towards him, all the fear rushed away and all I could feel was a relief. I rushed towards him
~~~~~
"pads, I swear to god if you say that one more time, I'm gonna kick your arse back to Azkaban"
I run all the spells, curses, and potions that could do this through my head, but nothing could do this. Not even dark magic. I run my hand through my head, trying to come to terms with this. I always knew pansy was lying when she was saying she got a hint about me, but I never thought about who or when I would meet my soulmate. Honestly, I didn't think I was gonna be alive at this point, never less much anytime far in the future. The lord would never let me live longer. He thinks that I don't believe in him, no matter how many times I try to prove it to him. It's doesn't matter if I believe in him because I don't have a choice. That's when it hits me.
~~~~~
"Harry dear" she puts her hand over my mouth "please don't freak out"
"Draco will explain when we get there" she assured me. "have you used the floo network before harry" I nod my head I follow her in and before she could say anything, I hear the doorknob shake. It was Lucius, Narcissa's husband, Draco's father, and Voldemort's right-hand man.
I seal up the letters and tie them to the owl praying he gets them there as quickly and as safely as possible. I release the owl and go to take a shower.
Sirius stands up, whipping off the dirt from his pants. With a smirk, he says "I bet you would love that moony wouldn't you" Remuses face grows red.
"Pads, That's Narcissas boy remember, I told you about him" Remus explained
I rolled my eyes, already done with this situation. After a few moments of silence, Sirius speaks
I run towards Harry's desk and grab a piece of parchment and look for a quill but all he had were those silly muggle quills.
I seal up the letter and put it to the side and start my letter to Dumbledore, knowing that it wouldn't be long until that screaming voice came back
"Dobby comes back later, I'm sleeping" I roll over to the other side, finding myself face-first on the ground. I wince in pain and stand up, only to find that I couldn't see anything. I reach my hands around trying to find my position in my bedroom until my hands run over the cold metal frames of what seemed like glasses.
~~~~~
I feel Narcissa's body go rigid. I squeeze her hand telling her she is ok. I feel bad for her. I can tell that she didn't want any of this for her or her family.
"Sirius, how does it feel to be a free man," dumbledore asks, trying to end the death stares coming from professor lupin. From what I heard When Sirius got sent to Azkaban for Voldemort's crime, dumbledore convinces lupin that Sirius was guilty, so when Voldemort returned dumbledor pressed the ministry to release the charges on him. Beatrice also once told me that they were together, like dating.
Malfoy turned and, to Harry’s surprise, grinned at him in a similar way to the child, only there was something else hidden in the look. Harry glared at the man, whose expression turned to confusion as he began a ramble that Harry couldn’t possibly process in his current state.
Hermione sighed, placing her hand on his shoulder.
“You can stay.”
The Healer remarked that he hoped Harry had gotten everything he wished for, and upon the uncomfortable looks from the three others in the room, coughed uncomfortably and informed the group that the reversal potion could be administered on the next proper day for such magic.
“Teddy,” Malfoy spoke softly. “Please bring your siblings upstairs, love. I believe your father has had another one of his bad dreams.”
Harry stared at the man in front of him, this spectre wearing Draco Malfoy’s face, and in that moment, all he could think about was the bathroom. He thought that, perhaps, Draco Malfoy knew what it felt like to expect danger at every corner. He thought back to the wish he had made, the thought that he wanted nothing more than to be happy.
Malfoy rubbed his temples, another tear escaping, then another, until he sat on the couch, head in his hands as he sobbed.
I wish this were all over and I was happy, he thought, and then thought it was silly of him to make wishes like this when he knew it would get him nowhere.
Draco’s puffy eyes filled with tears as the Healer explained that, until then, Harry would be unable to remember anything from 1997 until then because, due to the magic being wished-based, and the lack of Harry wishing to remember his life, he technically did not have any of those memories hidden in his subconscious.
Harry looked at her, puzzled. “1997, why?”
“Edward Remus Lupin you listen to me right now,” Malfoy spoke slightly louder. Harry’s head whipped around to look at him as soon as the name had left his lips. Teddy broke from his trance and brought his siblings, two of them crying, up the stairs.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Dad?” The boy spoke, looking at Harry for some reason. Harry caught sight of the hazel eyes he had seen so many times on another face, and for a moment his wand dropped slightly. “Why are you pointing your wand at them?”
Harry moved, pointing his wand at the children as he did so. “Let me guess, you have Parkinson posing as the little girl, and then Zabini, Crabbe, and Goyle as the others? Pathetic, Malfoy, that you thought I wouldn’t see through your Death Eater schemes.”
He wished for it all to be over.
“Darling,” Malfoy spoke excitedly, “Lily has just surpassed James in their dancing game and -”
Harry watched, still glaring, as Malfoy pulled out his wand and lit up the room with a patronus - a stag - and whispered something to it. Not moments later, a familiar girl with a familiar head of bushy hair was stepping out of their floo, not looking up from the bag she was rummaging in as she spoke.
Malfoy seemed to choke up even more after that, excusing himself to go into the kitchen for a moment. Harry and Hermione waited for him to come back, a decision that was definitely all Hermione, giving Harry what he felt was the perfect opportunity to ask her the most pressing question to him.
“What kind of trick is this, Malfoy?” Harry ground out, his jaw clenched. He vaguely noticed the ‘children’ from earlier turning off the television and staring at him from behind Malfoy.
“Eighth year?”
Wish Magick, they called it. Magic that had to be performed at a specific hour on a specific day or it wouldn’t work. It just so happened that Harry had managed to make a wish on May 13 at precisely three in the morning, the perfect time to use such magic, and upon his mention of watching a star during the time, the magic became even more complicated.
“Harry,” the girl spoke softly, “what year is it?”
Malfoy turned, looked at Harry, and smiled.
Harry almost spoke against her, but between her glare and Draco making his way back into the room with a gruff  “let’s go,” he didn’t dare to.
Hermione stood, looking softly at Harry as she offered him her hand.
“That’s preposterous!” Aunt Muriel declared. Harry stepped in, trying to keep a level head.
"It's already a mess! You're just making it worse!" Draco smiled and smoothed it down, placing a kiss on his temple.
When they landed, Harry knew he was wrong. Cedric immediately got to his feet. He wasn't prepared for it, so he didn't land gracefully like he did at the World Cup. Harry clambered to his feet as well. They looked around cautiously. It was a graveyard. There was a massive cauldron the size of a bathtub next to one of the graves. Harry read the inscription on the tombstone under an angel statue. Tom Riddle. Voldemort's father. Cedric's wand was at the ready and Harry's scar felt like fire. "Cedric! Get back to the Cup! We have to get out of here!" A figure shrouded in a black cloak appeared. They were carrying a bundle of fabric, they looked like robes, with something writhing inside. Harry's scar hurt even worse. "Cedric! Come on!"
Hermione was the first to say something. "Draco, what happened to your neck?" Ron elbowed her and motioned for her to be quiet.
“No. We’re not playing spin the bottle,” Draco declared.
“Wow,” Draco sighed. “That was intense.”
The figure waved their wand again and Harry was thrown into the air. His back smashed against the angel statue above Tom Riddle's grave and ropes wrapped around him, binding him to it. The figure waved his wand once more and a flame started under the cauldron.
Vincent looked up from his plate. “So that’s why Snape has been so angry with you the past five Divination lessons! You’ve been sneaking out!”
Cold air blew against Harry’s cheek. He tugged the flaps of his hat down and shivered. Draco was asleep in their room thanks to a well-placed sleeping draught in his pumpkin juice. Harry managed to slip away to buy Draco’s Christmas present. He walked out of the castle and down the trail to Hogsmeade.
“Where are we?” Harry turned over and buried his face in Draco’s chest. “It smells like you.” Draco laughed and it reverberated through his chest.
“Come this way.” Harry and Draco followed Moody a little ways away from where they landed and Moody pulled a piece of paper out of his pocket, handing it to Harry. Harry noticed that he was still Disillusioned. “You and Malfoy both need to see it, but don’t read it out loud.” Draco wrapped his arms around Harry’s torso and tucked his chin on Harry’s shoulder to read the paper.
“Yes, now shut up and hold still so I can pick you up!” Draco snapped. Harry laughed and kissed Draco’s cheek. Draco lifted Harry into his arms bridal style and stood on the window sill. Harry closed his eyes and wrapped his arms tightly around Draco’s neck as he jumped out the window.
“That’s lovely, Harry! Ron and I are as well!” Hermione added. She elbowed Ron and he grunted.
“So you’re having an elf apparate us?” Draco sighed and dragged his hands over his face.
“The Headmaster had the idea to have all of the students perform this spell at this exact time. I would appreciate it if you would all take this time to track down your Soulmate.” Draco’s heart thrummed with excitement. He was finally meeting the one. Who would it be? Would it be Pansy? Maybe it would be Daphne Greengrass. Draco walked out of the class swiftly, the string tugging hard on his wrist. He rounded a corner and ran straight into someone.
“It’s just Tonks!” Tonks protested.
“God, Harry. I love you so fucking much. I want to take care of you, but you never let me. It hurts me every time I find out something you didn’t tell me. I wouldn’t have harmed the Dursleys if you asked me not to, no matter how much I want to.” He carded his fingers through that untamable hair. Harry leaned into the touch. “God Harry, you really will be the death of me. I would take an Unforgivable for you.” Harry’s sleepy eyes opened for a second. He saw Draco, smiled, and cuddled in closer.
When I was first writing this, I was going to forgo the Christmas scene, but several of my friends and a few reviews requested that I write one. I ended up writing one, not to please them, but because it would have been sad to leave out Harry and Draco's first Christmas together.
"The Sorting Hat almost put me there, actually. I didn't want to because you were such an arsehole." Pansy heard this and doubled over in laughter.
Yes, I know it’s short. Like I said at the beginning of the chapter, life has been really busy. I started this chapter forever ago and just started again after a lengthy break. Just within the past few days, I was exposed to COVID-19 and now I’m on precautionary quarantine for 12 more days now. Fun. I’m high risk because of my health problems, which has me scared… Please leave a comment telling me what you think about this chapter! I need some positivity right now…
“What kind of trick is this?” Harry continued, his wand shaking ever-so-slightly. “What, you wanted to get me back for yesterday? Wanted to take an aging potion and kidnap me for some kind of revenge?”
“Malfoy,” Harry trailed off, unsure of how to phrase his intentions.
Harry sat on the windowsill, the textbook clutched tightly in his hand as he watched the night sky. That morning had been horrible, and he wanted nothing more than to change it. He wished he could go back and stop himself from hitting Malfoy with that curse. He wished he could stop Katie from being cursed, or stop Malfoy from getting the mark. He wished for it to be over.
Harry, still unsure of what to do, stood still as Draco swooped the boy into his arms.
“What?!”
“You told me you fell in love with him during our sixth year, and hid it until after the war. Something about realizing he had never had a choice and that everything was forced on him by his father. It was completely true, of course, but no one completely understood how you went from cursing him in the bathroom to kissing him everywhere you could during eighth year.”
“Harry it’s currently 2017.”
“Everything is going to be okay, Teddy,” Hermione spoke softly, sounding slightly reminiscent of Molly Weasley. “Your dad had a bit of an issue with some magic and he can’t remember much, but they’re working on fixing it now, and it’s going to be completely over in a few weeks, okay?”
Harry raised his wand, pointing it directly at Malfoy just as he had the day before.
“How dare you,” Harry whispered. “How dare you do this to me.”
“C’mon Harry,” she whispered, “time to go to St. Mungo’s”
Harry felt confused, more than he ever had, as Hermione spoke to Malfoy, calming the man down as much as she could as the blonde sobbed into her arms. Since when were the two friends? Since when did Malfoy call her ‘Mione? Since when did they forgive each other?
(See the end of the chapter for
He heard noises from downstairs, voices laughing and carrying up to where he was, and dishes clanging from where he presumed the kitchen was. As he moved, he got the sinking feeling that he knew this place, what with its winding halls and dark architecture. He knew that, with the addition of a screaming portrait and some decapitated elves, this would be identical to the home Sirius had grown up in. He thought that, perhaps if he took a slight detour, he would find a wall covered in a family tapestry, Sirius’ head burned off in anger.
“What?”
I know this is a shorter chapter, but I wanted to end it here instead of in the next scene since it made more sense to me. Let me know what you guys think so far :)
“Why is Malfoy here?”
He watched the stars, watched as one of them glimmered slightly brighter than the rest, and thought of Sirius and of his desperate need for family. Finally, after an hour of clutching the book to his chest and watching that star continue to grow even brighter, he cast a quick tempus, saw that it was three in the morning, and glanced up again.
The Potters take a trip to the zoo.
“Edward,” Malfoy whispered.
Malfoy, of course, dramatic git that he was, took this as Harry wanting him to leave, and breathed in deeply before nodding and standing up. He shook his head for a moment, Harry watching him, and began to walk away when Harry spoke.
"Avada Kedavra!"
“What do those names mean? He’s always calling us ‘poof’ and ‘fag’.” Harry turned his head so he could look at Draco.
Draco fanned his wings out on either side of him and laid on his back. Harry burrowed his way under Draco’s arm and into his warm embrace. “I love you,” he crooned.
Harry pushed his trunk across the floor and over to the foot of his bed. Thanks to Sirius, he was allowed to do this. The Dursley's feared Harry's godfather, the convicted murderer who escaped wizarding prison, now more than they feared magic itself. Harry closed his door and sat on his bed in exhaustion. His trunk was extremely heavy, but his thoughts seemed heavier.
“Yep. We need to be careful. Filch is just a few corridors away.” Harry took a turn down a corridor Draco had missed in the low light of the torches. They walked in companionable silence for a few minutes until Harry stood in front of a portrait. The thin man in the frame had long black hair with a few streaks of grey and a well-kept beard. His robes were emerald green and his face was long and sullen.
The first thing he noticed was he could smell Harry. Grass, leather, and rain. He looked around eagerly before spotting Harry. He was walking down the street some distance away. Draco smiled and ran over to him, being careful to keep his pace normal and not Veela speed. “Harry!” Harry saw him and ran towards him as well. They embraced in a hug and Harry buried his face in Draco’s neck. Draco breathed in the scent of Harry’s hair as Harry placed gentle kisses on his collarbone before looking into his eyes.
“We followed a strange beetle that isn’t native to Ireland and it turned into Rita.”
“I highly doubt it,” Draco smirked and draped his arm over Harry’s shoulders as they walked back to the park. They took a seat on the park bench and linked their hands. “Why didn’t you sleep well?” Harry stared at his tattered shoes.
A few times, the voices sounded exactly like Draco's calling his name. He ran towards it, only to find himself at a dead end every time. He started ignoring it, but it was hard. God, Harry missed him. There was a scream that sounded a lot like Fleur, and he ran to find her. He nearly passed her when he noticed her unconscious form on the ground, the hedge slowly pulling her in. Vines were wrapped around her and she was slowly disappearing. He cast one of the curses Draco taught him and the vines recoiled. Cedric came around the corner just as Harry finished unwinding Fleur.
“There, that should do it. We should get downstairs before Moody tears my head off,” Tonks joked. They walked downstairs and into the kitchen where everyone was convening.
“Are you okay?” He carefully lifted Draco’s head and sat down, then placed Draco’s head in his lap. As he stroked the blond hair, Draco relaxed and leaned into Harry’s touch. “Is there anything I can do to help?” Draco nodded.
“I love you,” Harry whispered.
“Shut up!”
“I don’t want to talk to that old windbag. He probably won’t do anything about it anyways.” Draco crossed his arms in protest.
“There’s an aquarium near here, we can go there before heading back.”
"Harry! What bit you?!?!?" Hermione squeaked.
“Oh! I remember now! I was reading about them in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. How are they different from regular Soulmates?”
Harry and Draco's first Christmas together.
“You need to get some sleep, we have Astronomy early tomorrow,” Draco murmured in Harry’s ear.
“It’s a book, obviously, Potter. I thought even you would be able to tell that much,” Draco teased. Harry could hear the joke in his tone and playfully punched his shoulder.
“You’re as bad as Mr. Weasley. Yeah, it’s kind of like a quill, only you don’t need to dip it in an inkwell and they don’t break as easily. they also don’t drip ink or tear your paper.” Draco pretended to be miffed when he heard the Weasley comment, making Harry laugh.
"Your mum wants us to be together?" His lips quirked up at the corners.
“I’m fine, Dray. I just went for a walk,” Harry lied. Draco frowned.
Draco made sure to stay high in the clouds where Muggles wouldn't see him. It was dark, but you could never be too cautious. He flew for miles, watching the scenery pass by below him. The lights of the cities slowly faded away to reveal black countryside and Draco dipped closer to the earth. A few minutes later he saw the dark outline of Malfoy Manor. He passed through the thick wards and landed in front of the door. He felt the presence of two other wizards when he passed through. Death Eaters. As long as he stayed out of their way, they'd leave him be. The manor was big enough for that...
Draco sighed. He'd barely gotten any sleep last night, he was worried about Harry too much. When he finally fell asleep, he was rudely awoken by a nightmare. He had been in the Forbidden Forest with Harry, and there was some
“Or a cafe in Paris,” Draco added.
"Faster, please! Draco I need you!" Harry finally pleaded, giving into the need that was clawing at him from the inside.
In other news, the D&D group I'm in is going to be campaigning tomorrow and as the DM I need to be there. My family is also cleaning the house tomorrow until it is time for me to leave so I'm posting two chapters today. I'm posting two because this one is rather short.
Kudos and Comments breathe life into me!!!! Find me on
“Of course! That looks fun! Are you sure you can carry me?”
“Who’s this, Potter? He another freak like you?” More jeers from the boys.
“Come on, love. You need to wake up,” he murmured. He found out waking Harry up gently was easier and less stressful than waking him up with loud noises and shaking. He kissed Harry’s hair and ran his fingers through it once more. Harry leaned into the touch and opened his eyes.
“You don’t. We have to wait at a bus stop.” Harry pointed to a bench under an awning on the sidewalk where several people were waiting for the bus. Draco sighed dramatically.
“I know, but I want to.” He put a chocolate chip muffin on the plate and handed it to Harry. Harry stuck his tongue out stubbornly as he took the plate. Draco filled his own plate and began to eat.
“Okay.”
“Draco,” He murmured. He wrapped hooked his leg around the other boy’s and wrapped his arms around his neck. He let Draco press him onto the side of the tub and they bumped one of the knobs. The faucet it turned on poured an oily liquid into the water that smelled like chocolate chip cookies. The water became slippery.
“What’s it about?” Harry corrected.
“No. Draco, please. We don’t have time to argue about this,” Harry pleaded
Harry tugged at Draco’s pants, trying to get them off. Draco huffed a laugh and helped him, then moved to take Harry’s off. Soon, they were both naked, and Draco wrapped his long fingers around both of their stiff cocks. He found a rhythm and soon Harry was thrusting into his fist. Draco buried his face in the crook of Harry’s neck and sucked a love bite onto the skin there. Harry cradled the back of his neck and pressed his cheek against his hair. Draco ran his thumb over the slit of Harry’s cock.
He took Draco’s hand, which was still connected to his own by the silver thread. “Let’s start over. I don’t want to fight if we’re going to be Soulmates.”
Harry turned to his aunt, who was regarding the letter in her lap as though it were a highly venomous snake. “That’s a Howler. If you don’t open it, it’ll open itself,” Harry warned. “Just get it over with.” She shook her head.
"Dray," Harry murmured. "It was awful."
” he continued. “Who’s Draco? Is he your boyfriend?”
"Harry! It's she okay?"
"It didn't have to burn completely, just enough to kill the spider," he grumbled. Harry rolled his eyes. That reminded Draco of the cupboard in the hall. Harry wasn’t afraid of spiders. Why was he afraid of that cupboard?
The news reporter started off telling of travelers stuck in airports because of some strike that had apparently gone on for two weeks. Harry did his best not to sigh. If there were anything important, it would have been on first, but he continued listening just in case. The newscaster continued on with news about the drought.
“I’ll miss you,” Harry said shakily.
“I know. I love you,” Harry whispered. He walked Draco to the door.
“Trying to undress me, are you Malfoy?” Harry slurred. He was going to have a massive hangover. “I thought you would wait until we got to the room. You clearly have no restraint.” Draco sighed. He pulled his Mate upright and removed his shirt, then gently lay him back on the silk sheets. He unbuckled his belt and undid his trousers. After some effort, he successfully undressed Harry and himself. Draco hefted him completely onto the bed, lay down next to him and covered them both. He laid his wings out behind them. Harry instantly rolled closer to him and Draco wrapped his arm around Harry’s tan waist. Harry buried his face in Draco’s chest. His breathing finally evened out and Draco watched him quietly. He stroked his cheeks with his soft white feathers.
Harry peaked at the clock and groaned. "Malfoy! It's only seven in the morning! We have plenty of time!" Draco tutted behind him. He felt the bed dip with Draco's weight and hot breath grazed his cheek as Draco straddled his hips. Harry bit back a groan of another sort this time. Draco's fingers danced over Harry's back and dipped under the waistband of his briefs. "D-Draco," Harry whispered. He felt the cheeky git's soft lips press against his neck and couldn't hold back a moan.
Draco Malfoy, Harry learned, could be quite a crier, especially when it came to Harry himself. Draco’s eyes remained puff throughout the entire consultation with the Healer at St. Mungos.
“STOP CALLING ME THAT” Harry shouted, not allowing Malfoy to explain or answer any of his questions. “You drug me, take some kind of potion, charm your little Slytherin buddies to look like younger versions of my parents, and call me Harry and love and darling? What on earth is your problem, Malfoy? I know I fucked up with that curse yesterday but need I remind you why we were in the bathroom in the first place? Should we ring Myrtle and have her recount the situation?!”
Draco stood and walked over to Harry, softly grabbing onto his hand before guiding him over to the couch. Harry realized with a start that, in his inward struggle, Hermione and Teddy had left the room and were nowhere to be found.
“You married him because you bring out the best in each other. If you just watch how he speaks to you and interacts with you, you’ll see it. He loves you so much, Harry, and you love him too. As for the children, Teddy is Remus and Tonks’, but since you’re his godfather you got custody of him as soon as you graduated. The rest belong solely to you and Draco, although he claims they’re more his since he carried them.”
"Are you in high demand then?" Harry asked, a curious edge to his voice.
Harry grinned. "She liked the flowers then."
"McLaggen's gone and offended the gate," he said, waving his bouquet rather forcefully towards the group in front. "Now, it won't let us in and no one knows how to make it open."
"No," Cormac said, "he doesn't."
"What's the matter?" Harry asked. "Is my reputation too scandalous for you?"
"But why?" Draco said, his voice oddly calm. "I've heard you say you won't marry but you've never said why."
"Interesting news this morning," Narcissa said when Draco put down the pamphlet.
That plan had been too elaborate, Harry thinks now, as he moves against Draco, all the hard planes of his body pressing up against Harry's front. Draco's cock is hard between them and with every other push of Harry's hips, he can feel the smooth velvet slide of it.
Draco looked offended until he caught sight of the smile on Harry's face. It was no secret that the Malfoys had lost a large part of their fortune after the War but even so, they remained among the rich families of Wizarding society. Though these days, Fred and George Weasley were giving everyone a run for their money.
"No, I don't think so," Draco says, grinning as he leans back on the arm of the sofa. "I'd like to watch."
He stood next to Mrs Weasley, his arms crossed as he looked brazenly back at Draco. He didn't even try to pretend he hadn't been watching Draco and Gregory. He simply refused to back down, his mouth a thin line as he dug his fingers into the muscle of his arms.
Draco shuddered, thinking of his own mother and the list of potential husbands she'd handed to him before escorting him into the ballroom that night. He kept his eyes away from the left side of the ballroom, knowing perfectly well that his mother was there conversing with other mothers. She'd be working him into conversation, trying to gauge his chances with the son of whatever unfortunate woman happened to be in her way. The other mothers would be doing the same for their children, and he could imagine the vicious mob that would form once Potter arrived.
"Who?" Harry asked, his mind already on Gregory Greengrass, pureblood, rich, handsome.
"They'll stay away if they think you've picked someone," Draco said. "Even Elise Abbott isn't shameless enough to beg for entrance where she isn't wanted."
They look good together is what it means, mismatched but complimenting heights, Harry in hues of brown and black, Draco, blond and grey-eyed. Both of them polished and pristine, recognisable for contrasting reasons that they've done their best to leave behind. They help each other, a nice back and forth that's easy and comforting.
"Popular tonight?" Draco asked.
Harry stops but he can tell it's too late because Ron's leaning forward and Hermione looks concerned but curious.
"I just don't understand why this man thinks declaring his love to his best friend's wife was a good idea," Harry says, halfway through the movie.
Harry's sure he's seen
"So you've been with women before," Draco said, his eyes going down to Harry's arms for a moment before he caught himself.
"Don't I already owe you a dance?" Draco asked, knowing that he didn't but offering just the same.
He groaned low in his throat, as he reached out to drag Harry closer, whispering between kisses, a rough, "Please, just like that. Don't stop."
"Listen," she says, "All of this is much simpler than you're making it out to be. Just go home, find Draco, and tell him."
He moved his hand up and down his cock, imagining Harry's mouth on him, that voice right next to his ear, telling him all the things he'd ever done to other men. He could imagine Harry on him, pushing his legs apart, sliding his hips close. He knew how things were supposed to go, knew Harry would work him open slowly, competently.
They clearly weren't alone and their audience was just growing in size the longer they stood there. But Harry wasn't about to contradict Mrs Abbott when she looked ready to murder him on the spot should he even twitch in the wrong direction. He eyed the door to his left and saw someone step purposefully in front of it. He was effectively trapped by a group of overeager mothers, and just as he had resigned himself to spending the next couple of hours politely declining courtship proposals, he heard a familiar voice call his name.
Harry watches Draco walk away, and he supposes that the night isn't so bad after all.
"Is that what you had in mind?" Harry asked. "An introduction?"
He spared a glance for Cormac, but the man had never been kind towards Ron, so Harry didn't feel particularly charitable towards him.
The Prophet photos at that time had been particularly eye-opening. Though the Prophet had only nice things to say about Harry's casual going-out clothes, he'd been able to see the difference between how he and Draco dressed immediately. And though Harry had thought he'd hate the extra effort needed to get everything hemmed and cut, he'd done it anyway because he'd felt like it was worth it to put in the extra effort. He hadn't hated it in the end, particularly because Draco had sat with him and eyed him up and down until the witch at the shop had shooed him away.
Finally, when Draco yawns, Harry says, "So, would you want a romantic gesture?"
Harry pulls him in, lets the relief at finally getting the words out wash over him. He's half-laughing into their kisses but Draco just throws an arm around his neck and pulls him closer, kisses him again and again. Until Harry's sure they're going to be late to dinner.
He'd been in a much better mood after Blaise's visit, so much so that he decided to dress in his family colours for the Greengrass ball. He'd worn the chain that Gregory had given him without a thought to how that might appear, only remembering to take it off right before he walked into the Greengrass Manor. He wasn't meant to show favour to anyone aside from Harry yet. There was a delicate balance to these things, dances other suitors had to beg for, gifts they should impart. They had to fight for him to make it believable that Draco would give up a match with Harry Potter. Otherwise, Draco would come out looking like the idiot who let Britain's Most Eligible Bachelor get away, and Draco wasn't an idiot.
With a small smile, she put her hand on his back and urged him forward alone. He had no choice but to step through to the balcony that overlooked the ballroom. There were steps on both sides leading downwards, and as Draco took the right set of steps, he noticed that the group of people closest to the bottom were looking up at him. He didn't understand the interest until he noticed Gregory and Cormac McLaggen deep in conversation, Cormac's hand laying proprietary along Gregory's arm. Behind them, a little to the left, stood Harry, resplendent in deep red and black, his hair tousled just so. He was glaring at both Gregory and Cormac, and when his gaze met Draco's, he raised an unimpressed eyebrow.
He turns back to Draco and answers as honestly as he can. "I dunno," he says. "I reckon it might be nice to be appreciated."
Malfoy Manor had one of the largest sitting rooms Draco had ever been in simply because his mother liked large windows and natural sunlight. It was the one room in the house that wasn't decorated in the family colours of green and silver. It had lighter wooden walls and everything within it, from the couches to the curtains, was in a myriad of blues and whites. That morning, the curtains were thrown wide open so that everywhere Draco turned, he could see the sprawling green of the Manor gardens and the far-off trees that lined the edge of the property. To his left was the marble fountain in the centre of the garden, blooms of various sizes and colours surrounding the area.
"Be careful, Draco," a voice close to his ear whispered. "People might start to think you like the Greengrass cousin."
He expected Harry to already be at the ball when he arrived. They'd agreed that they wouldn't arrive together at events, but that Harry would be there first, waiting ever so patiently for Draco to show up.
"Draco," Gregory said. "You look ravishing."
He sighed. He could feel his mother's concerned gaze even as they walked. He didn't want her pity just yet, didn't want the burden of her sorrow when he finally explained that he and Harry had broken off their courtship. It'd be better to let her think that he called off the courtship because someone else had caught his interest, better that she believe Gregory was a love match. She'd always wonder, but his mother had always cared more about his happiness than she cared about him nabbing the greatest catch of the season.
Harry looks at him long enough to acknowledge the warmth spreading through his chest at knowing that Draco is in his home and his life. The way Harry can feel the work week getting farther from his mind as he sits there with Draco. Then, he focuses back on the screen and watches Mark gather his things to declare his love for Juliet.
"Well, you've clearly been introduced to the dregs of society," Draco said. "And you haven't even noticed, especially if they had you thinking for even a moment that your only purpose was to be their saviour."
"I know what to do with men," he said, taking one step forward.
She was watching him as they were announced to the room, a blank look that nevertheless found a way to be assessing.
"Let's hope Potter is smart enough to attach himself quickly," Draco said.
Sometimes he thought Draco might feel it too. In the moments just after a dance finished and they were pressed close, Harry thought he saw Draco's eyes drop to his mouth. He could swear Draco pressed a little closer when they made their turns around the lake, could swear Draco was trying to hide a smile as he leaned his head closer to Harry.
"Pansy seems to think you were lying to me about your reputation," he said.
He inhales, lets himself really feel the way his heart is thumping. He thinks of mornings with Draco, of the way Draco had laughed at The Pheasant, how everyone in any room always has eyes for both of them, for how they fit together. Harry likes knowing that he and Draco make a good match, that they complement each other, because it means that he and Draco fit. And for a long time, Harry hadn't thought that was possible.
Draco yawns again and pulls away from Harry. "Merlin, no," he says, leaning against the opposite arm of the sofa and rearranging the blanket. "Can you imagine?"
Harry handed her the bouquet and in a voice that carried throughout the sitting room, he said, "I saw them in the store and couldn't help but think they might be to your taste, after yesterday's ball."
Draco tightened his hand around himself and imagined Harry above him, those arms caging him in, that body pressing him into the mattress. He remembered the heat of Harry's hands the only time they'd touched, how the feel of his fingers had sent a jolt of electricity up Draco's arm and to his spine.
"Well," Ron says, settling back onto the sofa. "Now that that's done, how's about you show me this poem?"
"Something like that," Harry said, openly grinning now. "Except it's not just debutantes."
He'd held on until he didn't know how to do anything else. And when he finally looked at what he'd built, he found nothing. He hadn't known who he was without Ron and Hermione, without the Weasleys. He'd been about to ask Ginny to marry him when he opened his eyes and was unable to recognize the man in the mirror.
He sighed, leaning against the pillar by the entrance. Ron stood to his left, slouching against the wall in his messy dress robes. Ron was doing it on purpose, ruffling his hair so that it wouldn't lie flat, so that it was obvious he didn't belong with the rest of the group. Harry, on the other hand, wore neat midnight-blue dress robes and his hair, so often unruly, lay tamed for once. He stood at attention next to Ron, tension running across his shoulders as he did his best to look without being seen.
"I wrote you a poem," Harry says, knowing that if he stops, he's going to start feeling the nerves and it's important that he gets this right. "Actually, I may have stolen it from Ginny. She wrote me something similar in Second Year. I asked and she said it was all right for me to use it. Oh, I also may have told Ginny...well, that's not important. The point is, I'd like to read you a poem and then tell you something so, just stand there for a bit."
"Okay," Harry said. "Enlighten me."
And that's when the regrets began.
He wants to tell Draco how much he wants him, how much he needs him. How Harry feels a sort of desperate burn, something hidden so deep in Harry's chest that it will burn him alive if he doesn't give it room. Harry inhales, ready to tell Draco how much he loves him, how good he feels, how everything is perfect and warm.
Draco did stop then, drawing himself to full height. "Are you going to deny the rumours about you and the Muggles in the countryside?" he asked.
He thinks better of it, knows that the pounding in his chest is just nerves, that there's nothing to worry about here. But just because he knows these things logically doesn't mean that Harry can stop the way it's harder to breathe all of a sudden. He's not prepared but he knows what he wants to say, knows that it's nothing at all like Mark from
Harry grinned. "A pleasure as always, Malfoy," he said, eyeing Draco up and down more purposefully, his gaze landing on the chain at Draco's neck. "I'd ask where all the gold in Gringotts had gone, but I can see for myself."
Parkinson Manor's high ceiling was alight with floating bulbs filled with bright white flames that looped together to form three large chandeliers. Between the intricate wall carvings framing the windows and entrances, sconces covered more bulbs, turning the whole room into one large overly bright spotlight. Everywhere Draco turned, the light bounced off long trailing necklaces and glittering diamond earrings, off exquisite tie pins and cufflinks. He blinked and the sparkle remained, so much openly displayed wealth on every witch and wizard in the room that he was starting to feel sick to his stomach.
"But you think this reputation of yours might make my mother second guess leaving us alone together," Draco said, fighting back a smile. "What? Are you supposed to be a sex hungry madman? Are you out deflowering London debutantes?"
Draco's fingers were light on Harry's skin as they went, the leather of his glove just brushing against Harry's arm. Everywhere else, Harry could feel the scratch of fabric from Draco's outer jacket, the touch feather-light, as though Draco wanted the least amount of contact between them. They said nothing as they went, Harry content to know that Draco's eyes were on him and not on anyone else.
How to explain it, Harry thought. What words existed to describe the horror of living with the Dursleys, of the years where he was told he was less than nothing. How could he ever explain what it was like to finally mean something, to be someone, to have value outside of how fast he could cook bacon or how hard he could scrub a toilet. He'd given himself away to the first person who'd been kind to him and he'd still been left all alone in the end. He'd always been what others needed, first with the Dursleys, then with Dumbledore, and finally, with the entire Wizarding World. Becoming a person, becoming a fully-fledged human being outside of what others needed had been one of the most painful things he'd ever had to endure. And after all the pain he'd gone through, after all the nightmares, he was never again going to let anyone tell him who he should be.
Harry turned to Draco and gave him a small bow. "I'll see you soon," he said.
"Just open the damn box," Harry says.
"What are you doing?" Draco asked.
"It's fine now," Draco said. "I fixed it."
"Don't," he said, his voice rough.
"We didn't really get to enjoy dessert last time," he says. "I thought it might be something you'd enjoy. Especially because you have mentioned that you like romantic gestures every once in a while."
"It looked official," Harry says. "There were a lot of titles. And you try saying no to Ginny."
"You look really good in the sunlight. I don't know what it is about you and the sun and the way it just makes you look like you're glowing, even though we both know if you spend too long in the sun, you'll burn. As clichéd as it sounds, when Bartholomew from your department drones on and on and you look at me, I don't care anymore. I like that you're annoying about the types of clothes you wear and that you like it when I try. And I promise I try because I like how we look together and how the Prophet can't figure out whether they love us or hate us together. I like who we are and I like you."
"I don't care," he said, the words breathy as he gave in to the feeling of Harry's body so close to his own.
Draco's lips twitched as he tried to hold back a grimace of distaste. He was still deciding whether Pansy was complimenting him or not, when he spotted Justin Finch-Fletchley. He wandered the room in a three-piece suit, handsome in black and white, and so obviously Muggle-born, he should have stood out. Except that after the War, after the trials and the reforms, the debutante balls had opened up to anyone who wished to attend and could afford the fees. And Finch-Fletchley, Muggle-born though he may be, came from wealth and good breeding, and much as Draco was loath to admit it, Finch-Fletchley was his greatest competitor.
In what, Harry hopes, will one day become their home.
"You are missing a group of adoring suitors," Harry said, biting back a smile.
"Thanks," Harry said, dryly. "Really appreciate it."
It wasn't that Cormac was a bad match. Quite the opposite. He came from a family of well-connected Ministry heads, and his Muggle mother had brought a sizable fortune to the family when she'd married his father. He had a full head of bright blond curls, brown eyes, a straight nose, and he was a good head taller than Harry, though Cormac was built bulkier than Harry was. He would have been fun to spend time with, if he didn't carry around an air of superiority that made everyone within hearing distance want to punch him right in his attractive face.
He straightened, reaching up to smooth the fabric of his dark black and gold dress robes when he spotted Pansy making her way across the room towards him. She was dressed in soft pink dress robes adorned with lace, hundreds of small glittering diamonds lining the edges. She walked with purpose, her steps far too long to be perfectly graceful, her head tilted just a little too far past arrogant. She was a vision, severe beauty coiled tight and ready to strike, everything about her deliberate and defiant.
"I didn't have a home before Hogwarts," Harry says, looking at Juliet opening the door on-screen. "I have a home now and I know what that feels like and I wanted to let you know that I feel that with you. More than that. When we're together, it makes me want to do crazy things like bake you cakes and write 'I love you' in icing. I want to do what Mark's doing except, of course, you're not in a committed relationship. But I get it? The need to make it a grand gesture and to just let you know that I like you so much in the mornings."
Draco smirked. "Meet me outside in the gardens in ten," he said.
"Barely," Harry said.
Harry inhales and glances at that back of Draco's head. Draco's still standing by the stove and there must be something in the air because Harry can't take his eyes off him. He stops thinking about the poem and imagines walking over and pulling Draco into a hug, kissing the back of his neck, burying his face in Draco's shoulders. They don't need to have breakfast yet. There are so many things they could do instead.
, Harry thinks as he looks down at Draco.
Pansy was wearing a silver robe from Madame Malkin's over pink, half-finished dress robes. Her hair was pushed away from her face by many tiny silver hairpins. She took one look at Draco and her mask of indifference fell to reveal a flash of anger.
"Hey," he says instead. "Thank you."
He moved without thinking, his thoughts not yet fully formed in his head. All he knew was that he had to get to Draco, to see him. He'd know if he saw Draco. If he saw Draco, everything would settle into place.
"Just like that," Hermione says.
The man was looking for a husband or a wife. He had money, he had looks, and he was a war hero. Not so talked about in the Prophet, but rich enough to matter, and if Draco had thought he stood even a minuscule chance at getting Finch-Fletchley's attention, he would have been over there in a heartbeat. But alas, there are some things that can't be bought and chemistry was one of them. No matter how much effort Draco might have put in, Finch-Fletchley was a hard no, and so that made him Draco's biggest rival for the attention of other well-off wizards.
"I just want to be happy," he said, his words a little harsh, a little desperate. "Let me be happy."
He'd do anything to know the warmth of Draco's skin beneath his lips, to hear the sounds he'd make when Harry had him laid out on a bed. He'd give Draco the world for just a moment alone, away from prying eyes and the looming sense of responsibility that came with Wizarding society. Harry would give him whatever he wanted. And so, he knew it was time to let him go. Better to end things before anyone got hurt. Better to have Draco marry someone else than to go back on the promises Harry had made to himself.
There's also an iPod Nano that Harry borrowed from Dean and some headphones he'd picked up on his way from work. The little white rectangle holds all of Dean's favourite songs and though Dean hadn't said anything, Harry's been extra careful with it. He knows Draco will like it because ever since he'd had to give Hermione her iPod Shuffle back, he'd been contemplating getting something for himself.
He knew that the longer he stayed with Draco in that bubble, the harder it would be to remember that they'd snuck away for a reason. He had to keep the conversation on track, to get it over and done with so that he could go out into the fresh air. He needed to feel the wind and have it wash away the heat he could feel emanating from Draco's body. It reminded him of how much he missed the feeling of someone beneath him, of the satisfaction of an intimate embrace. But it was neither the time nor the place, and Draco Malfoy wasn't a Muggle in some pub in the countryside.
Draco shrugs. "Hermione didn't teach me how to lower the volume," he says.
Kingsley had conceded the point as due to those same shortages, Draco had been present for the meeting, acting as the Secretary for the Head of Intoxicating Substances. Harry's still not sure why that particular department had been present for talks about Dementors. But it had meant that just as he was about to lose his mind, he'd looked across the room and Draco had rolled his eyes and thrown his head back in exasperation. Just like that, the meeting from hell had been just a tad more bearable.
"True," she said, sniffing daintily. "But it doesn't really matter, does it? As soon as he steps through these doors, every single mother will be fighting for a chance to introduce their eligible children to him. It's really only a matter of whose will is stronger, a debutante's mother or Wizarding Britain's Greatest War Hero."
Harry stepped back, running a hand through his hair and tugging. "That's not what I mean," he said. "I only…I'm not very good at ignoring what people say."
"You," Draco started, licking his dry lips as he tried again. "You don't have to be ashamed of anything."
"I'm not marrying Gregory," Draco said again.
Draco raises an eyebrow. "Are you forgetting lunch with my mother last week? Nothing is ever just dessert."
"I should go," he said to Draco, but his eyes looked for Narcissa.
and tells them anyway.
Hermione does a lot of official note-taking. Harry doesn't say that he still has no idea why they even need the Department of Intoxicating Substances at a meeting about Azkaban. Bartholomew makes a lot of snide comments. And Draco avoids Harry's eye the entire meeting. All in all, it's not a bad outcome and though they run past regular office hours, by the time everyone heads home, Harry feels like they've accomplished something.
Draco laughs, the sound carrying in the empty room. It's happy and carefree and it makes Harry want to kiss him.
He was still smiling, looking at ease in Draco's sitting room, his back against the couch, legs crossed as his gaze wandered around the room. Draco watched him as Harry took in the rest of the bouquets, lingering on the slope of Harry's shoulder, the way his red jacket fit perfectly over his dark shirt. He wore sensible shoes, polished and worn but not excessively so. He sat on Draco's couch with his bouquet in honour of Draco's outfit from the night before, an expected gift that Harry had managed to make both intimate and droll. It was flattering and charming, and presented with Harry's smile and his twinkling green eyes, it would have been more than enough to win Draco over. If they were really courting.
When he goes down, Draco's standing by the stove near the window, his back to Harry. This side of the flat has a partial view out to a small park and Harry watches from the doorway as the light hits Draco. It brings out the golden hue to Draco's hair, bright and warm.
"Who's going to bully you?" Harry calls from the kitchen. "You'd just scare them away."
It was an astounding display of talent, how she was able to convey a clear disinterest in Ron without saying a word. She effectively shut him out with nothing more than a side step and a turn of her head. Harry caught Ron's eye over Mrs Abbott's shoulder and knew that Ron was leaving him.
Harry raised an eyebrow. "What reputation?" he asked.
"Uh, Draco," Harry says. "Are you...is everything okay?"
He could kiss him right there in the posh restaurant with its floating bulbs of light and its string quartet. He almost does it, lost in the moment as he reaches across the table for Draco's hand.
They wanted everything, so he could give them nothing.
"I wanted to give you something," Gregory said, pulling a small box from the folds of his clothes. "It's not an engagement ring. It hardly seems proper to propose now in front of all these people. But I wanted you to know that I am serious in my intentions, and if you'll have me, I will provide for you and your mother for the rest of your lives."
“Est-il possible que votre mère soit Madame Apolline Delacour?”
“Come into your inheritance did you?” She smirked.
Kudos and Comment to tell me if you liked it!!!! Follow me on
“Yes, much thank you.” Draco stood and helped Harry to his feet. He gathered lifted the bag with the egg inside and guided him to the Prefect’s bathroom. “Cedric told me the egg has something to do with water. Do you want to solve it in here?”
Harry stood on the edge of the dock. Neville had given him the ball of gillyweed a few minutes ago, and he was waiting for the cannon to fire. Moody stood next to him, and Neville stood on the other side. “Remember, just keep moving down. Make sure you move fast. You never know what creatures are going to pick a fight.” Harry nodded. He was still wondering where Draco was when he glanced down at his wrist where the silver sparks glowed. They trailed into the water and disappeared into the murky depths. He glanced at Cedric’s and then Viktor’s wrists as well. Each string of sparks led into the murky depths. Fleur was the only one with a bare arm.
“They won’t.”
“Try it, I dare you,” Draco snarled.
“You just want to steal it.”
“I’m a Malfoy, the rules don’t apply to me,” Draco said without turning away from healing Harry. When he finished, he turned to look at the Dursleys. “Let’s take this to the living room, shall we?”
“I’m really getting married, aren’t I?” Harry asked with a giant grin. “This isn’t just a dream.”
Harry's name is pulled out of the Cup for The Triwizard Tournament.
Harry huffed a sigh of annoyance and pulled the shirt on over his head. Draco took one of Harry’s shirts from the dresser to wear and slipped on a pair of jeans from his bag. He adjusted the shirt with a tailoring charm; he liked wearing Harry’s clothes but he didn’t want to look like a homeless person. Harry was still searching for clean jeans when he was finished dressing, so Draco sighed and threw a pair of his jeans at him.
Harry shook his head and continued looking at his shoes. “I’ll tell you later. I don’t want to say anything here.” Draco nodded and squeezed his knee supportively.
“I, Harry James Potter, stand before you, Draco Lucius Malfoy, because you have won my heart and today I choose you to be my husband. You are my life partner, the only one I pledge my love to. I will listen to you, and be open and honest with you. I will be your trusted partner and stand by you through good times and tough times. I promise this now and for all the days of my life.” The tears that were prickling Draco’s eyes spilled over his lashes and down his cheeks.
"Every time I look at you while we're there, I won't be able to think about anything but that anyhow, what's the point?" Harry asked with a grin.
“Shut it,” Dudley growled. subconsciously, Harry knew he should stop, but he wasn’t thinking of the consequences, only of how angry he was.
“I’m just anxious about the Challenge. I don’t want to lose you,” Harry murmured.
,” it said. Its voice was nothing like the sweet melody of the egg. It was harsh and raspy. Harry tried to protest, but only bubbles floated from his mouth. The merpeople laughed and jeered at his struggle.
“My father was a wizard, and my mother was ‘alf Veela. She was from ze eastern tribe.”
“What are you doing?” Harry gasped.
“B-but, Petunia…”
“Yes. I think it’ll take my mind off everything.” They stood and Draco lifted the egg. “I think we should open it under the water. When I threw it in the water earlier, it started singing.” Harry nodded and Draco handed him the egg. He submerged it and twisted the latch, it opened and sweet music filled the air. When he couldn’t make out the words, he took a deep breath and ducked his head under the water as well.
“Mine,” Draco whispered. Harry nodded minutely.
He was covered in a cold sweat and the sheets were tangled around his legs. Harry angrily pushed them away and sat up. The horizon was just barely showing a bit of pink where the sun would be rising. Harry huffed and took some clothes from his dresser so he could take a quick shower.
“Fine. I was out getting your present because you refused to leave me alone in Hogsmeade so I could go get it then!” he huffed. Draco smiled even wider. He placed a kiss on the cold nose and chuckled.
!!!!!!
"Aye, Professor Dumbledore."
(See the end of the chapter for
As he filled Harry’s plate with all of his favorites, Hermione burst out, “Harry, do you have something planned for the challenge? Ron and I are worried about you. People have died—” Draco put his hand up to stop her.
“You worry too much.” Harry picked up his fork and started eating. “Dray, I promise, I’ll be fine.” His reassuring smile made Draco’s shoulders relax and the worry lines in his brow smooth out. Harry smiled and gave Draco a kiss on the cheek.
“What are those books for?” he nagged, gesturing to the massive pile of books next to Draco.
The reception was held in the backyard of the house just off the garden. The house was anything but small and Narcissa had been strongly opposed at first, insisting it could be held in the ballroom (Harry still had no clue why there was a need for a ballroom in a summer home but he had given up trying to understand Pureblood standards) but Draco was adamant on the reception being held outdoors along with the ceremony. When Molly mentioned using tents as a compromise, Narcissa agreed.
"Have it your way." There wasn't the slightest waver in his voice. Draco would be proud. Fuck, Draco! Harry felt a swell of both fear and strength. He would fight to save Draco as well as himself.
“Harry, you’ve never played truth or dare until you’ve played it with drunk Slytherins,” Theo promised.
“You’ll like it, Potter. I have excellent taste,” Pansy sleekly said. Harry reluctantly pulled away from Draco.
Harry tried to stay in the park. He really did. But after fifteen minutes of sitting on the only unbroken swing (Dudley and his gang must have broken the other when he was away), he got bored. He left the park and wandered around aimlessly for a bit until he found himself at the entrance to the Underground. Might as well buy a paper and have some lunch then. None of the newspapers or magazines showed anything of interest, and after eating a quick sandwich from a vendor, Harry wandered on.
“I thought you said there was going to be ‘dangerous company’ for a few days.” Draco smiled and Harry felt Draco’s invisible wings brush his cheek gently.
“That sounds tedious.”
At that thought, warm arms snaked around his waist and a firm chest pressed comfortingly against his back. He leaned into the touch as Draco's familiar scent filled his nose. He tilted his head back and met those stormy grey eyes with his green ones.  "You were able to sneak away."
"Play nice!" Harry ordered. Draco smiled innocently and kissed Harry's cheek sweetly. No one seemed to have an appetite after that, except for Ron, who always had an appetite.
“What isn’t?” he asked.
"I've heard young Draco had discovered his Soulmate to be Harry Potter. I believe that can be used to our advantage. If we can convince Draco to join our cause, then we will have easy access to the boy. I want you to let him be with the Potter boy, just for now. Allow their bond to strengthen. When you bring him to me next year, I will use this as an incentive. If he wishes Potter to live, he'll help me. If not, I'll kill Potter. The Boy-Who-Lived will die either way." He cackled. Lucius smiled tightly. He didn't think Draco would cooperate so easily, but he didn't say anything.
Harry was the first to wake up. The first tears of dawn were streaming through the window, setting Draco's hair aglow. The white feathers of his wings shined in the morning light, giving Draco the look of ethereal beauty. His face was calm and soft. Harry relished that he was the only one who got to see Draco like this. As Harry took in the sight before him, he noticed the love bite he left was still visible on Draco's collarbone. Harry practically glowed with pride. As he became more aware of his body, he noted his legs were tangled up with Draco's, and their fingers were interlocked. Draco's arm was clutched closely to Harry's chest, and the fingers were unconsciously stroking Harry's cheek.
“Yes, along with his gang so we need to leave before they see me.”
“I love you.” Draco still was confused but didn’t ask the questions running through his head.
"No! You saved my life! You take it!"
Draco sat at the desk and doodled with Harry’s muggle ‘pen’. He was too tired to even attempt convincing Harry to do something other than obsessing over the news. When he ran out of room on the silly paper with lines, he spelled the ink away and restarted. He decided to take down the silencing charm on a gut feeling so he could hear if anyone was coming.
"Well, you aren't that subtle at hiding when you've been fucked. You walk funny and sit funny. Weasel will notice and I'll have a good laugh at how he'll react. He's not subtle either and everyone is bound to know before the cake is brought out." Harry turned bright red and smacked Draco's arm playfully.
“What is this? Petunia?” Vernon was now very quiet, silently begging his wife to explain.
“Yeah, I guess it was a bit petty.” The train pulled to a stop and they stood. Harry led them off the train and they left the Underground. Draco looked around in amazement as London came into view. “Harry, what is that?!” He pointed to a giant Ferris Wheel.
“Scared, Potter?” he challenged.
Harry awkwardly held the clothes before muttering, “I don’t have any briefs.” Draco sheepishly nodded.
"Great! The Dursleys let me send Hedwig out after they found out about Sirius. I told them he's my godfather who was arrested for murder, and he checks in on me to make sure I'm happy." Draco smiled. "It's not a lie!" Harry laughed.
"No. This isn't your fault. It's that crazy Death Eater. He put your name in the Goblet of Fire! If he hadn't, none of this would have happened." Draco rubbed Harry's back gently. They were quiet for the rest of the walk and Harry fell asleep.
“It doesn’t matter. I don’t care what they think. I’m the one who should be sorry, it was stupid of me to care before.” Draco pressed his lips against Harry’s, squeezing his hips softly.
They set a neck-break pace, slamming their hips together without care nor coordination until Harry came with a scream. Draco slumped over him further and pounded into Harry's spasming body as he rode through his orgasm. They collapsed into a boneless heap and Harry groped for a wand on the end table, managing to grab Draco's, and cast a gentle cleaning charm. They lay panting like that for what seemed like eternity. Draco lay on Harry's chest, their breath mingling with chaste kisses as they played with each other's hair.
Draco rested his head against Harry’s chest and closed his eyes. Harry tucked his chin on top of Draco’s head, holding him closer as if Draco was the most important thing in the world to him. Draco smiled against Harry’s chest and replied, “I love you too.”
“M’m not tired.” Draco picked him up and looked to Pansy, who was now staring at Blaise in happy disbelief.
“Yes, you are. Stop arguing and go tell the Dursleys you’re going to a friend’s house for the rest of the summer.” Harry sighed and trudged downstairs. There was no arguing at this point.
“I love you too.” Harry pulled away and dug through his trunk for some parchment and a quill. He soon gave up after finding he had no ink and all of his parchment was either used or torn beyond repair. He sighed and walked over to the minuscule desk in the corner. He opened one of the drawers and pulled out a Muggle spiral notebook and a pen. He sat on the bed and started writing a letter. Draco sat next to him and inspected the paper.
