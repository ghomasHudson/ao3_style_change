Draco cleared his throat before his mouth curved into a smile which was evidently meant to charm and soothe. “Have I mentioned how much I love you?”
Draco’s eyebrow rose, displaying his scepticism. “I think there’s a lot of things you believed about Weasley that didn’t turn out to be true.”
“The stationer who purchased a lot of the Manor’s trinkets wants me to help him evaluate and source rare objects to sell in his shop.” Draco sighed almost wistfully. Very telling, Harry thought, but he didn’t comment yet. “I’ve been thinking about that one for a while now. I haven’t said no to that yet.”
All of that other stuff wasn’t what he should be thinking about, Harry hastily tried to convince himself. What he should be focussed on right now was his breathing.
“I could take you hard and fast right here over your desk, and I can make sure that you’re extremely
Flinching, Harry began to turn to face his desk, but was clearly not fast enough. Malfoy closed the sparse distance between them, raised his hand to grip Harry’s upper arm, spun him round, and with one hand in the middle of Harry’s back and the other around the nape of his neck, he
Confused about the replacement of the comfort which had so recently been taken from him, but keen to regain some points for better behaviour, Harry stuffed the pillow back where it was.
Watching Potter’s expression sink further into hopelessness, Draco realised that no, he didn’t. It just wasn’t… Potter, to do something so calculated and selfish.
But Harry did venture for something further. He knew it would be over the usual line of his submissive role, but he was well over that tonight anyway and he thought Draco would like it.
So, Harry had spent a couple of hours last week testing wand components for compatibility with the woman’s magical signature. It’d been interesting to take note of the different reactions. What had also been interesting, although more due to shock value than appeal, was a detailed offer of sex and fruit scones. Unprepared for the proposal, Harry had accidentally tipped over a whole box of wood samples. And although Madame Deetry was gracious about his politely stuttered refusal and hadn’t mentioned it again, she’d made it clear that the offer would stand for any time in the future when Harry was feeling horny or peckish.
Draco couldn’t hold in his laugh at the sight of Potter’s mortified horror, but his amusement was cut short when he turned his head and noticed the scroll.
will be my pleasure,” Malfoy declared as he snapped his hips forward. “I’m going to fuck you through the bed.”
it. It was also okay to let people protect him the same way that Harry worked to protect them. People
Potter didn’t respond. In fact, it took Draco three increasingly loud repetitions of Potter’s surname (and a pointed nudge of Granger’s elbow into Potter’s ribcage), to provoke Potter into acknowledging Draco’s voice again.
Harry didn’t think any of his attributes were particularly irresistible, but as the tickling changed to more of a gentle caress in the region of his crack, he decided that was probably not the relevant issue. Or perhaps it
Harry tried to suck in air; it hurt as he struggled to gain control. He couldn’t fill his lungs. Couldn’t find any sense of equilibrium. His file cabinets started to rattle against the wall. He tried again to breathe normally. Still didn’t work. The cabinets rattled harder, and numerous other items in the room were beginning to violently shake in accompaniment.
Draco had also learnt that ignoring the call habitually led to unwanted drama, so he dutifully replied, “What, Potter?”
. Or so he’d thought, anyway. But for just a few glorious seconds, Harry imagined how differently that might play out with Draco. And Harry
Harry was face down with his right cheek on the mattress near his bound wrists, stark naked, bent legs tucked tight under him, and his arse in the air while Draco lounged in a chair near the bed, equally nude with one leg draped over the other. Draco was paying close attention to the transparent length in his hand, applying what was surely enough lubricant to fuck an elephant and criticising Harry’s lack of respect for fine fabrics. It felt like Harry had been listening to detailed instructions on correct garment folding techniques for quite a while. The jeans and other clothing which Harry had
Harry turned to see that Draco had moved to stand beside the bed. That seemed optimistic of him. Or knowing them… predictable. But after today’s events, Harry wasn’t sure yet.
Even through his anger, Harry could see that suggestion had validity. He envisioned some of his magic encasing the office within a box, strong and impenetrable.
Put that simply, it was tempting. But there wasn’t just Harry to worry about. There was obligation, expectation. And Malfoy’s employment. Harry doubted that the next Minister for Magic would choose him as willingly as Harry had.
Potter didn’t immediately answer. Sensing that this could be an important moment to assuage his curiosity, Draco waited.
Malfoy smiled. So different from his father now that he was free from oppressive influences. “Thanks,” said Malfoy, leaning forward to peck Harry’s cheek with a kiss. Harry felt his face flush while he involuntarily grinned. “You know, Potter… this is a sturdy piece of craftsmanship,” Malfoy observed as he tried to shake the piece of furniture using a hand on either side of the wood. It didn’t budge. “Permanent sticking charm’s still in place. This thing isn’t going anywhere. I’ll probably need to bring the bloody wall down to get rid of it. That means it’d take quite a beating though. Imagine how affronted my father would be to witness poncy behaviour over his precious bureau.”
Harry thought he was doing relatively well until a little while later when a distinct, steady vibration began in the region of his arse, and he realised that he was
?” Harry’s voice was breaking with the shame of not realising something so crucial. Maybe the Wizengamot was right; Harry couldn’t be trusted with important things. If he couldn’t successfully organise his own life, how could he run a country? He forced himself to speak the rest. “I’m legally required to be Minister until the next election. And there’s another four years before they need to hold another one. I’ve essentially only served three years of a seven-year sentence. I’m screwed until then.”
From his perfectly pillow-propped viewpoint, Harry was mesmerised as Malfoy’s tongue delicately tasted him: sometimes with a pointed tip to explore a contour, sometimes flattening out against the sensitive length, often lapping at the precum liberally appearing from Harry’s slit. And it was torturously
So, Draco had grasped the chance to leave his family, although he knew this was only a temporary reprieve. Not even that. Draco had fled from the cauldron into the fire.
, to be free of them. He needed this piece of magical bonding to mean nothing to him. He needed to be
“I’m appropriately dressed and prepared,” Draco replied, voice smooth and hopefully betraying none of his inner turmoil.
Impaled by what felt like just the tip of Malfoy’s erection inside him, Harry had a way still to go. He gingerly lowered himself, using his thigh muscles to control the movement. Malfoy’s hands remained on him but offered no further assistance to his descent.
context, anyway. Malfoy preferred him to be a neat little whore. Harry chuckled as he pondered that thought, causing Malfoy to quirk a brow at him. “What?”
Brushing Malfoy rug fluff off his jeans, Harry asked, “Should I deal with… that?” He pointed to indicate the covered portrait.
The sight which greeted Harry was Draco’s face close above his, studying him with familiar scrutiny.
. Let’s just drink. Not going back to the office today.” He’d had enough. Enough work, enough expectations, enough judgment.
He remained silent, pondering the sensible benefits of walking away. Harry had turned his back to do that by the time Lucius spoke again.
Harry could detect the subtle hint of self-mocking. And he knew Draco well enough to know that the best way to react to it was with humour.
Reviewing his reaction to Potter’s act of salvation, Draco had an urge to do something entirely genuine.
Harry became aware that neither Ron nor Draco were looking at him anymore. Following their gazes, he realised that they were both watching the fruit bowl on the coffee table as it violently rattled against the wood. A red apple toppled over the rim of the bowl, rolled across the table, and thumped onto the carpet.
Letting his cheek sink into the mattress, Harry minutely adjusted the spread of his thighs so that his legs were wide enough for balance, but not sufficient to overly pull at his muscles. He didn’t know how long Draco would be gone, so he needed to make sure that he could hold this position. Once he’d sought as much physical comfort as he could in the circumstances, Harry resigned himself to patience.
Having achieved the demanded position, Harry once again found himself waiting, his panting breaths loud in the otherwise silent room.
It took Draco only seconds to reach Harry. His worried, questioning gaze rapidly examined Harry’s face, roamed down his body and fixed on Harry’s hands.
Draco was suddenly aware of how wet and weary he was, and how entirely tired of the need to strategize. “Because no-one else seems to,” he answered honestly. Draco wasn’t used to such openness. If Potter laughed at him, then Draco would wash his hands of it all.
Harry went with it, relinquishing Draco’s buttocks as his wrists were grasped, brought up and together, and pushed into the mattress above his head. He spread his legs wide and smiled as Draco settled into the gap. So
Caught in the intensity of that cold, relentless stare, Draco believed he might be witnessing a hint of the determination that’d won Potter the war.
by themselves. Completely trusting someone else though, that was a trick Harry was struggling to master. Harry used to have friends that he'd allowed himself to rely on, as they could rely on him. Still
As Harry hovered inside the kitchen doorway, Draco joined him, but stood strategically behind Harry. Draco’s short jumper wouldn’t be hiding anything from the waist down. Harry’s cock was certainly deflating, but not as quickly as he’d prefer. He wondered how Draco was fairing.
Thankfully, he knew that he wasn’t Luna’s type, but Harry had a hideous vision of being chased by hordes of randy pensioners.

, in one way or another. Friends, fuck-buddies or… other.” It was far too early to tell. “I don’t know. We’ll both need to wait and see what each of us wants. Maybe we’ll just want someone available to hurl therapeutic insults at.”
Malfoy’s fingers were around Harry’s wrist again. Closing his eyes, feeling steadier, Harry Apparated.
Draco had now stomped over to stand directly in front of the portrait and was silently watching the corner burn, although he had set the tiny fire to spread gradually. To Harry, that was a hint that Draco didn’t really want to burn it. If he had, it’d be ashes by now. Harry decided to intervene.
Michael before he’d been able to succeed to that extent. But the boggart had been close enough to what Harry imagined would’ve occurred if he hadn’t broken Michael’s curse, and it’d taken Harry a fortnight to face going back into a bed.
Harry would’ve felt like a better man if he weren’t taking so much satisfaction from the fear that he could see blossoming on Michael’s face. But Harry vaguely recognised that
That must’ve been the last push that Malfoy needed, because a moment later Harry’s hips were shoved flat into the mattress as Malfoy roared out his orgasm. Harry
“That’s more than fine. You don’t have to do anything you don’t want to. Neither of us do. We shall be two sexual beings, living in each moment, interested purely in pleasing our own special brand of spontaneous carnal lust.”
it. “I wasn’t who he’d thought I was. And it wasn’t the only time that’d happened. People tend to already form such a strong idea of who I am before they’ve met me. But I thought
Potter rolled to face away from Draco, incidentally bumping Draco’s hip with twin arse cheeks but not making any move to leave the bed. Heartened by Potter’s continued presence, but cautious of speaking again while his tongue was doing its best to assist him in celibacy, Draco stroked what he hoped was a placating palm down Potter’s side and risked only one word.
“Thank you.” Harry wasn’t sure whether he was grateful for the lube, or the pain that would still be sure to follow when Malfoy forced his cock into Harry’s unstretched anus, but he knew that his shivering was born of anticipation.
“So domineering,” Draco laughed as he turned and slid off the edge of the mattress to stand beside it.
Draco smiled in a parody of naïve bewilderment. “I’m merely making pleasant conversation with your… friend.
“Yes, I can. It’s my job. In more ways than one now. As your Personal Assistant, Minister, it is the essence of my role to ensure the smooth running of your professional life. Attending more meetings today is evidently not in the best interests of either yourself, your governmental aims, or the officials that you are scheduled to meet with. I fear that the damage could be catastrophic.” Harry could only stare dumbly at Malfoy as he continued, “And as your… whatever, it has become my high priority to ensure your personal wellbeing in other ways. Therefore, for the rest of the day, your office is closed.” Malfoy reached over to pluck Harry’s nearby robe from the floor. “Did you marinade this robe in coffee, Potter? It reeks.”
bit. His erection was not wilting in the slightest and it seemed a shame to ignore it when everything he wanted might be here.
Once Malfoy had evidently deemed that Harry had waited long enough, he enquired in a low voice, “Are you sorry that you disappointed me?”
The moans from above him sounded encouraging and with the thrill of pleasing Malfoy, Harry struggled more to hold onto his composure. He was not allowed to come. He would
“Yes, I’m glad I didn’t need to do that bit. I don’t think diplomacy is my thing. I did have a lot of other stuff to do though.”
But he seemed ready now, so Harry ventured, “You only signed the paperwork on the estate this morning, Draco. There’s no rush.”
Draco answered with a demanding tongue, and the arms around Harry tightened as Harry reinforced his own grip, finding fistfuls of wool to anchor him as he thrust his hips against Draco’s cock. He revelled at the hard heat pushing back against his own, the unshakable strength of the man in his arms, and the mouth that could bestow derision, snark and sweet terms of endearment. The pressure in his cock tipped over, and Harry happily lost the game. Or won. Harry might even be disqualified for breaking the rules.
Harry chuckled, that might brighten his day. Before Harry could answer, Malfoy stepped behind him and uttered a low but commanding instruction in the tone which Harry
Wrong, wrong, wrong. Harry had felt like utter crap; dirty and ashamed of his desires and he could barely look at Oliver afterwards. But Harry hadn’t admitted how much the words had hurt. He’d masked it with indifference towards the relationship instead. And he still wouldn’t tell him, especially not with an audience.
Harry wasn’t interested in how Michael might respond. Releasing the magic holding Michael in place, he let the ward fall and instructed, “Go away.”
The Ministry’s post-war sponsorship programme was designed to vigilantly control inconvenient people like Draco; he wasn’t expected or permitted to
Malfoy used his fistful of hair to yank Harry’s head backwards, lifting his face from the desk, and resumed thrusting at that same angle. Harry could imagine the satisfied smirk above him as Harry’s control started to shatter. Harry was doomed to failure. Harry was going to come all over the floor and earn himself a much harsher punishment than the one he was currently receiving. The further punishment would probably be worth his while, but he really didn’t want to disobey.
Potter waved Draco’s wand again and the curtains parted. Thankfully, the other occupants of the room were still snoring soundly. It apparently took a lot to rouse a pack of slumbering lions.
“Why?” Draco snapped, perhaps just a little too sharply. “What’s ruining your perfect existence, Potter?”
The Burrow was exactly as Harry remembered it; a place full of life and constant activity, but also frozen in time. The décor hadn’t changed, the layout of furniture was the same, and the smiles and embraces were just as welcoming.
Potter’s denial was wholly unconvincing. But perhaps Draco had it the wrong way round. For his future plans, he hoped so.
“Puffs have always been popular though. Kids like them and they make good pets for taking to Hog -” Harry stopped, remembering the odd sensation in Draco’s trousers. “Is that what’s in your
“Yeah,” he replied, turning it around as he admired the hues. Mostly a rich red, with hints of burnt orange running up the main length… and veins of pink, he decided. “The red is unusual as a main peacock colour. It’s pretty.”
Potter’s increasing attempts to initiate conversations beyond the boundaries of their thrice daily meetings were beginning to grate on Draco’s nerves. His study times in the evenings were marred by Potter’s furtive glances and mindless chatter as he tried to involve Draco in conversations.
Harry didn’t stand though; he was still assessing Draco’s reaction. That had been… a lot of information. Even Harry was trying to decide what to do now.
“Because you seem so miserable when you look at that scroll,” Potter said, and Draco wondered how transparent he was becoming. “I wanted you to know that whatever he’s written doesn’t need to matter. But it’s up to you whether you read the letter. It’s all up to you. You needed to
Harry decided that he needed to take Malfoy at his word on that. After all, many of Harry’s ideas hadn’t been so brilliant, either. And Harry shouldn’t expect Malfoy to understand him if he didn’t explain things about himself. “So, can we move on now?” Harry whispered.
Working for the stationer sounded like a job which Draco might enjoy. And something that he’d be good at. But it wasn’t for Harry to decide.
“Look at me.” Harry reluctantly raised his gaze to regard Malfoy's face. Angry grey eyes filled his vision as Malfoy’s hand stroked Harry’s neck. “Do you want me to give you a list of all the things you've
But that resolute brand of dominance never failed to please Harry. Contemplating his plight, Harry knew that he could easily liberate himself from this predicament, but he was enjoying it too much.
. Throughout their other role playing, Harry was consistently denied the right to come without permission. And Malfoy knew that it was a constant battle which Harry fought hard to win; if Harry came, he had lost and would incur a penalty. This was the complete opposite of their usual games.
The fuck he was. Malfoy was a condescending, overcritical blight on Harry’s life. Harry often had to remind himself that he’d
Draco noted that Potter hadn’t corrected the statement about his virginity and inwardly staggered for a second with the realisation that despite being the most eligible bachelor in Wizarding Britain, Potter couldn’t manage to achieve the basic task of getting laid. It’d likely be wise not to mention that though. Or to sound too keen. “I don’t know… maybe. Unless you have delusions of becoming a top.”
“No, thank you,” Harry ground out through clenched teeth. “But I’m very grateful for your concern,” he added, hoping to appease.
“I think that’s your job,” Harry grumbled, nudging the file away from him as he tried to resist the urge to hurl it back where it came from. He should’ve misused his reluctant authority to relocate Malfoy far from his office by now. Preferably to another country.
Draco looked sincere, but maybe also upset. Harry’s foolishness had upset Draco and he hadn’t even made it to the main event yet. Harry wanted to make amends. And he wanted to run away. But he also still wanted to do this, despite his uncertainty.
As Draco tried to absorb the information and Potter’s current behaviour, the reason became suddenly clear. Draco couldn’t contain his gasp of disbelief.
But as he let himself understand what Potter had done for him, there was only one right thing to do.
“Yup. To be honest,” Draco sighed again. “I’d been thinking that it would’ve been a satisfying sort of retribution if Weasley lost the promotion to Corner.”
Draco was confident of his upcoming tactics. Potter didn’t appear to be good at recognising subtle hints, so Draco intended to be blatant. He didn’t much care whether the rest of the students realised his intentions, it was not against any Ministry decree to have sex at the age of eighteen, even if it was with their saviour. Shagging a sponsor might be a grey area, but Draco was prepared to take the risk. He trusted Potter’s hero complex to catch him, even if it all went to shit. Faith in Potter was an odd belief, but Draco tried not to analyse the cause.
With his hands out of productive action, there was nothing Harry could do about the issue as he recommenced his task. He moved, watched and prayed.
Draco had received many letters from his father during this term. None of them had contained a single sentence which hadn’t chilled him to the bone. And this was the second one to be sent during the night, although Draco hadn’t been awake then to open the window, instead discovering the unamused and shivering owl upon his early rise. And almost losing a large chunk of his hand in penance for his inattentiveness. Draco suspected that his father was losing his grasp of respectable social timescales. Isolation could probably do that to a person.
That should be much better news than it was. “Good. Because I wouldn’t like you to get the wrong idea.”
At the very least, Harry had expected that for his first try he’d be set with the task of creating a wand for the general stock, one that may or may not ever choose a wizard. But no, Luna had asked him to create a custom job for Madame Deetry, an overly enthusiastic member of his faithful pensioner fan base.
“No,” repeated Harry. “I’m not sure. But I’m going to do it anyway. I need to, I think. For me, for us.”
Harry sighed. He would. In fact, he’d really like not to go into the office at all. Perhaps ever again. But instead of voicing those thoughts, he asked, “Are you hoping that the Ministry might push me out of office for neglect of duty, Malfoy?”
Potter. Gifted with the most prestigious position in Britain and you couldn’t handle the pressure. Maybe they should’ve employed you to clean the lavatories instead. All that power, all that
Relieved to be on more familiar ground, Harry’s hands began to shake with excitement as he released them from behind his back and brought them upwards to the button of Malfoy’s trousers. He aimed to comply quickly, but not to rush. Harry must cautiously handle what he’d been gifted with, less the privilege be taken away from him. That had happened before when Harry had appeared too keen.
“Mr Malfoy.” Snape’s voice cut through the air with its time-honoured effectiveness, and Potter stopped talking. “Is this meeting nearing a conclusion? I only ask so that I may proceed to breakfast unhindered by loitering students.”
Harry watched him go. He felt oddly numb. Harry had been avoiding any possibility of that confrontation for years. It wouldn’t have even
Potter ceased his movements, but only relinquished Draco’s erection when Draco pulled more sharply at the roots.
“I’m sure it would,” agreed Draco. “But I personally feel that the most thorough method to polish a wand is to insert it into a tight anus.”
. “Let me ask you this… if you removed anyone else’s demands or needs or expectations or whatever from the equation, what would you have wanted to do last week?”
until Draco’s back arched further and Harry’s fist was pumping through semen. The sensation encouraged Harry to thrust harder, pushing between plump arse cheeks until he spurted against Draco’s anus.
“I believe that you didn’t have a choice,” Potter said. Draco didn’t know why Potter would have that kind of faith in him, but he wasn’t going to comment on it. “But couldn’t your father -”
Harry slowly lowered his body and sat, feeling self-conscious as his bum rested upon Malfoy’s thighs. Being on top, even in this manner, felt too much like the type of sexual encounters that he’d allowed himself to be pressured into before by other men. Harry on top. Harry in control. He hadn’t thought that this was what his deal was with Malfoy. Had believed that Malfoy understood that. Harry wanted to be on the
it was. But you were loud enough to make it all the way downstairs and through the open Floo. Perfect timing has always been a speciality of yours.”
“Unless you’d prefer to stay,” Harry offered with fake graciousness, gesturing towards Draco. “I think Draco would appreciate being able to properly catch up with you.” Michael still didn’t depart but Draco nodded, eyes shining with chilling eagerness. “If you don’t go now, I’m going to keep you here while I let him.”
“…get on your knees?” Draco supplied as a conclusion to Potter’s abandoned sentence. One more step and Potter was trapped between Draco and the wall.
“Good. Now I’m going to show you what will please me. Pay attention, I’ll only show you once and then I’ll expect you to execute it yourself.”
Prising the lid off and placing it on the mattress near his knee, Harry registered the sound of rapid, anxious breaths and realised it was coming from him. He tried to regulate his breathing into something more moderate. Better. Harry set the open jar next to the lid and dipped three fingers of his right hand into the cool lubricant, rubbing his slippery fingers against his thumb to warm the liquid.
Draco thought at least that last part sounded real. Indeed, Draco wasn’t at the top of anyone’s list of priorities to care about. Or even
Harry leant to the side and gave an answering whisper of, “Me too,” into Draco’s mouth before he slid their lips together in a kiss.
That seemed promising, and Harry would be more than ready to accept a cock by this point, but Harry enjoyed allowing Draco to fuck him without any preparation at all, so he was reluctant to use himself as a base reference for anyone else’s pleasure. Harry didn’t know Draco’s preferences well enough within this context to presume anything, so he practised further caution and added a third.
At the moment, the reason for Snape’s inattentiveness to impending disaster was obvious: Snape was far too busy criticising Draco to notice anything else. Snape had paid Draco more attention during the last thirty minutes than he’d done during the rest of the year so far, but Draco would’ve been grateful to receive none of it. In fact, Draco was beginning to fondly reminisce the time when his Head of House had preferred to ignore him. Draco wondered if Potter’s presence had previously been providing a buffer for Draco here as well.
“Well, I think that things might have a chance of returning to normal if you’re snogging a man in my mum’s pantry.”
Draco was no longer looking at the wall and appeared slightly… lost to Harry’s perception. His eyes were strangely unfocussed down towards the floor, as if Draco couldn’t quite decide how to feel, or what to do next. Frankly, neither could Harry.
“Fuck it.” That hardly seemed an appropriate response to Draco’s well-considered argument. Draco was about to say so when Potter continued, “But I’m still curious… why would they admit you as a student when you have a Dark Mark?”
“Yes, Potter… I could be the Auror, and you could be the nefarious criminal. How do you feel about handcuffs?”
, Harry thought, surprising himself with the strength of his conviction. Harry would usually be ecstatic at the prospect of Draco using him. And he’d be happily willing to spend all night begging for it. But at the moment he wanted something… else. He wanted… he
“I… I don’t… know what I’m doing,” whispered Harry, feeling that was a running theme today. “I mean, I
bothered. Most of Harry’s short relationships had simply fizzled out with stifled disappointment, but Oliver had been extremely vocal about his opinion.
That hardly seemed the point to Harry, but fair enough. Draco’s complaint about Harry’s lack of appreciation for interior décor was a promising sign, so Harry continued, “You abruptly removed an ugly ottoman from the world and were more enthusiastic about speedy undressing than usual, but that was it.” Draco still didn’t look assured, so Harry tried to explain further. “The part which was… unsettling me was that I couldn’t find a connection with you.
With an effort, Harry called his wayward magic back into his core before he stomped back over and around his desk, stopping to loom close to where Malfoy stood, chair providing a feeble barrier between them. Harry glared. “Maybe you should have the
“I don’t do chit-chat, Potter. If you want to spend time with me, then you’ll need to provide a better incentive.”
Draco had hoped the prospect might prove daunting enough to prompt Potter to flee. Instead, Draco’s stomach did an oddly erratic, somersaulting flip when Potter worried his bottom lip between his teeth, apparently considering the suggestion.
bad,” Draco growled as he crawled onto the mattress, between Harry’s spread legs and over his torso to peer down at him.
At half-past ten the next morning, Harry was peering over a large steaming mug, trying to convince himself that he was awake. Brunch was an idiotic concept. He should have asked for an extra shot. Or two.
Draco delved deeper within himself to find further reserves of restraint. It wasn’t Potter’s fault, he reasoned; Potter was evidently either losing his mind or developing a death wish. The ease with which Potter detached himself from reality was frighteningly surreal. And if Draco was honest, what he really thought was both frightening and surreal was that no-one was
Draco straightened his spine and aimed to portray unflappable, graceful self-confidence. “You think so? Finnigan, are you busy right now?”
Harry could hear a strange, distant rumbling that seemed to be coming from far away. Caught in a swirling mass of anger, uncertainty and ever-rising anxiety, he didn’t move to comply.
people’s.” Draco tugged him into an embrace and effectively messed himself up as much as Harry was. This proximity also emphasised to Harry his nudity compared to Draco’s fully-dressed attire. Harry liked that. “Only yours. And you know I won’t. No matter
“Tell me about your upcoming week, Harry. What’re you going to be doing with the delightful Miss Lovegood?”
Recalling the earlier interminable lecture and demonstrations designed to torment him, Harry laughed, but still didn’t move.
“Degradation?” The casualness with which Malfoy threw out the word caused Harry to inhale a gasp. His cock needed out.
“Look at it.” Harry looked up. Malfoy’s trousers were tented outwards towards him, tantalisingly close to Harry’s mouth. He licked his lips as he anticipated the treat that he knew was hidden beneath the cloth. “Do you think you deserve the right to touch me? To
The latest mouthful of water which Harry had begun to drink spurted out of his nose. Thumping the glass onto the nearest bedside table, Harry spluttered, suddenly worried about Hogwarts’ shocking lack of sex education. Or perhaps he’d been too busy slaying a Dark Lord that day to catch the lesson.
Allowing himself a snort of laughter, Draco stepped outside into the downpour. The force with which the rain was falling was more than a bit of moisture, but Draco wouldn’t be deterred. The cold was strangely refreshing, it helped to clear his mind. And he was hoping it’d do the same for Potter.
were willing to force me, then what would someone else be prepared to do to me if I didn’t act the way they wanted?” Harry’s harsh laugh held no humour. “And
. As if they were still friends. Like Ron hadn’t dismissed Harry when he’d needed support. Harry hadn’t intended to ask Ron to do anything; hadn’t wanted to take action, even then. He’d only wanted someone to talk to. And Ron had taught him not to do that again. But Draco was teaching him differently.
“Are you sure you want to tell them?” Draco asked. “I mean, you know I think you should, but I don’t want you to feel pressured into it.”
“Oh. In that case… piss off,” Potter instructed the bird, flicking his wrist in a haphazard shooing motion. Taking the hint, the owl rose and flew through the gap in the drapes. The gap swished closed under Potter’s wanded direction.
And in Harry’s opinion, no customer should be allowed within the premises while he was attempting to combine magical raw materials into something powerful. However, Luna did not agree and was carrying on with business as usual. It was Monday morning
“Then leave me alone.” Draco leaned forward to breathe his next words against Potter’s clenched jaw. “But please note that it would also be worth
Harry opened his eyes, slid his right hand from his thigh, extended his arm and reclaimed the contract.
do. Your presence is expected to attend a date in about…” Draco turned to look at the clock if the bedside table, “twenty-three minutes.”
Not Malfoy. Harry hadn’t been angry with Draco, not really. He’d just been the only person available to yell at. Malfoy didn’t appear to be pushing him for an answer, so Harry reviewed his options. Harry did have a vast team of lawyers within the Ministry… but it was probably unlikely that they’d help him to work
Harry had previously noted that the object expanded into a round ball at the base, large enough to be held in a palm to serve as a handle, and he was certain that was what he could now feel separating his buttocks. Draco muttered a charm behind him, but Harry was too distracted by his bum full of glass to catch what it’d been.
And oh, shit, Potter was going to kiss him. Draco swallowed, held his position and tried to control his breathing. He needed Potter to make this move, didn’t trust himself with it. The first contact from Potter’s lips was a brief brush against Draco’s mouth, with the tip of a tongue peeking out to sample only the edge of Draco’s lower lip, as if Potter was reacquainting himself with the taste.
not the one to has to shag him. And he’s not so bad anymore. Kind of funny, now that he doesn’t rant on about blood status.”
Luna smiled as she walked over to the low cabinet which Harry was sitting cross-legged in front of, stock book and pencil in hand. Harry liked that she didn’t share the wizarding world’s frequent snobbery regarding quill use.
about it. But Molly’s words were so similar to what Draco had said, that Harry was overwhelmed by a strange sense of déjà vu. It didn’t change his answer though.
Malfoy sounded far too hesitant for Harry’s comfort. There was so much more he hoped they could discover together. Worried that he’d inadvertently ruined this, he tried to sound confident. “Don’t stop pushing my boundaries just ‘cos one idea went to crap. That’s what we have the safe word for, Draco. And it worked fine.”
For a fleeting moment, Draco considered stripping himself naked as a distraction, but his previous arousal had been dampened by the recent event.
insisted on them. After the events that’d occurred in the Ministry during the war, it seemed prudent to be able to monitor dangerous criminal activity within the building. But Harry was concerned about something.
There was also an owl perched on his windowsill, Harry recognised as he looked up. He blinked at it. It blinked back at him.
It was frightening how much Draco wanted to. Which was precisely the reason why he wouldn’t allow it.
“The wording must’ve been drawn from me.” Maybe Harry hadn’t done well enough. “I’m not a lawyer. I’m sorry,” he added.
Drinks were quickly poured and slowly sipped, and Malfoy seemed content. Until of course, the inevitable questioning began.
needed to turn around but he still couldn’t force himself to do it, even as Michael’s hands rose and rested on Harry’s shoulders. Michael’s wand was held in his right hand. At the sight of it, Harry forgot how to suck air into his lungs. The pane of glass in front of them started to tremble, distorting the reflection.
Struck by the possibility of a mid-morning caffeine-fuelled duel, Harry said, “Maybe Hermione will be a calming influence.”
“Kneel over here, facing me. Keep your hands where they are,” Malfoy shortly ordered. Harry moved to comply, turning his head to see where he was being directed to. “Faster, Potter.”
Harry hoped it’d be his turn in a minute. It wasn’t always within these roles and being denied could be every bit as fulfilling.
At the mention of the surveillance spells, Harry wondered if he hadn’t screwed up so badly after all.
They reappeared in the bedroom a few seconds later, Harry having decided that it would be the handiest site for locating him some clothes. He stepped away from Draco and headed towards the wardrobe. After he’d swung open the doors, Harry considered that this storage was simply not big enough for the both of them. He could magically expand the space, but he didn’t want to fiddle with it. Maybe they could get a second one.
Harry tightened his grip, fixed his gaze on the wall in front of him and got on with it. Looking at Malfoy’s derisive sneer would not keep Harry’s orgasm at bay. And after the first few repetitions of the required manoeuvre, the predicable difficulty set in. Harry had been demanded to fuck himself on Malfoy’s cock with a movement he was sure had been designed with particular care to consistently stroke against Harry’s prostate if he did it correctly. Naturally, Harry would endeavour with all his being to do it correctly. This was sadism at its very worst. Or best. Harry was in control, but at the same time, he
“Exactly. I’m not ashamed to admit it. Not all of us are you. Although Weasley does assure me that it’s the best.”
A few hours later, Potter rose to Draco’s challenge. Sitting in silence together during the tedious torture which was listening to the new Transfiguration teacher drone on about theory, a small note was inconspicuously and wandlessly slid from Potter’s side of their shared desk to stop in front of Draco.
Naturally, Harry didn’t want to talk about it. But he was learning that refusing didn’t help. The more that Harry bottled stuff up, the more his magic attempted to react on his behalf. And in this instance, since Draco knew where Harry had been, it wouldn’t take much effort for him to ask Hermione. Since Hermione didn’t know the real reason why the subject was so sensitive, she wouldn’t likely think there was any cause not to tell him. She might even think that Draco could persuade Harry that the meeting was a good idea.
. That didn’t make any sense. Nearing the end, Harry gritted his teeth and finished with, “It was close. I was… I’d managed to get an erection and I’d started to push
Ron’s squealing rose in pitch as he tugged his hand, trying to dislodge it from the box. Avoiding Ron’s other flailing arm, Harry moved nearer and peeked over the rim; as expected, Ron’s finger was stuck in a glowing blue, pulsing light. The light, Harry knew, was reading Ron’s magical signature. Gathering information to be used later. The box was open because Draco had been comparing its magic to that of the four other boxes on the desk before he’d gone to answer a Floo call in the fireplace within the drawing room next door. It wasn’t harmful, but the questing magic wouldn’t be a comfortable sensation. But it also wasn’t deserving of quite the amount of fuss Ron was making.
Harry exhaled slowly and looked back to Draco, feeling oddly accomplished but still uncertain. He’d refused something which had been requested of him by someone he cared about, and they hadn’t pushed or insisted. George hadn’t even sounded
The creaks and rustles of fabric from behind Harry indicated that Malfoy had settled again on the couch. And the faint slosh of liquid suggested that he’d poured himself a drink.
“This is how the game will commence,” continued Draco, alert eyes watching Harry’s every reaction as he uncurled his fingers. “This,” Draco said, gently manoeuvring Harry’s cock and balls from cotton trappings, “will come out to play with mine. Hold onto Daddy.”
“That’s right. It’s not as if we even argue,” Harry replied, trying for a deadpan delivery of something blatantly untrue, but failing to hide his snort of amusement. A rumble from his stomach waylaid what would’ve been his next statement and turned it into a question instead. “Is it too much to hope that you actually
“Later, then.” Draco nodded again, lifting his thigh against Potter’s palm. “Just set the place and time.”
Again, Draco berated himself for ruining a simple strategy. But attraction to Potter, he reasoned, was not detrimental to the plan. In fact, it should surely add to Draco’s satisfaction. Sex, that’s all it was. Nothing more, and certainly nothing less.
The next barrage of insults from Lucius ramped up a notch from before, mainly focussed on the negative influence which Harry’s presence was having on the sole Malfoy heir’s priorities. Lucius had some oddly specific ideas about Harry’s sex life; Harry had never once seen a flock of sheep in his bedroom. Or conducted a Muggle and half-blood integrated midnight orgy. Or used leather shackles… but Harry took note of that particular notion for possible future experiments. He didn’t quite catch what he was supposedly doing with his Firebolt, but he could guess… and only Draco was allowed to call Harry a whore. Cringing, he suspected that wasn’t going to be well-received.
At that, Potter returned to silence. Draco listened to snippets of chat on either side of the table and nodded to the occasional cheery Gryffindor greeting as he waited, debating which approach might be best to try next.
But now that the moment had passed, Harry’s actions towards the end felt self-serving. “I was supposed to be taking
stop as he thrust his hips into Malfoy’s face, riding through the intensity of his orgasm. Draco held him through it, fingers in his arse, at his balls, and his cock lodged where it
“Malfoy, if you’re fishing for a reciprocal list, I’m going to need a pencil,” quipped Harry, reluctant to discuss the topic of Ron.
If George had told Ron enough to enable him to leap to that conclusion so quickly, Harry might need to reconsider George’s genius.
Harry tried not to laugh at the mental image of Draco walking unsuspectingly into that brand of ‘busy little boy's room’. Best to get to the point instead in case Draco commenced a hasty retreat back to the main room. And if he didn’t return within an acceptable timescale, Harry would want to go in there and get him. Just for a brief peek, of course. “Why would you want to ask me something?”
Malfoy took a step back and extended his arm in a graceful arc of almost theatrical encouragement. A silent gesture of trust that Harry had regained enough control to safely accomplish the task.
As if anything would be considered beyond the Saviour of the World. Potter could probably achieve the lowest NEWT results in the history of the school and still emerge vaunted by the masses for his genius.
“Indeed. Harry Potter… talented in provoking spontaneous eruptions. Twice in one day too. You’re unstoppable.”
skittish, but his gaze was travelling over Draco’s body in a way that betrayed his remaining interest.
Harry’s legs ached, protesting the wideness of the stance which he was forcing them to maintain: thighs stretched as far apart as he could physically manage, soles of his feet planted firmly upon the mattress while lifting and slanting his hips up off the bed to allow access to his hole. Forbidden to wrap his legs around the man impaling him, it was an excruciatingly difficult angle; in fact, Harry had been surprised that it’d worked. But he was not to touch Malfoy; Malfoy would touch
Harry was not amused in the slightest. He ground his teeth in anger, but not at Ron. Those spells were meant to
He shook and twitched and shivered and tried to focus on anything other than what was happening to him, but everything that was happening to him right now had become his whole worshipful world.
Getting out of the study seemed a wise first move, so Harry again reached out, relieved this time when Draco removed his right hand from his pocket and fingers interlaced with Harry’s.
The future Harry had decided on was terrifying. But whatever happened, he was confident that it would be an improvement.
Delaying earned punishments wasn’t like Malfoy. But Harry was probably in an unexpected predicament. Perhaps reasonable allowances could be made.
Draco’s eyes were filled with concern. Harry hated that he so often caused Draco to look at him like that but accepting others’ concern was also important. So Harry had been advised, anyway. Although Harry was severely struggling with that. But it was okay to ask for help. And it was okay to
He spread his legs and allowed his body to be guided onto Draco’s lap. It was surprisingly nice as Harry’s bum settled onto firm thighs. When Harry was tugged closer and his cotton-clad erection neared Draco’s exposed cock, Harry decided it was
“Well, you do have the full and hefty might of all the Ministry departments to use at your whim, but that’s probably not going to help you with this problem.” Malfoy sat back, placed the re-rolled contract on the desk and seemed to consider the issue. “Hmm, I’m failing to come up with a brilliant plan at the moment. But I’ll think of something.”
Malfoy slowly nodded, but he didn’t look convinced. And Malfoy wouldn’t be Malfoy if he didn’t have a pertinent question. “Is this… person someone I’ve met?”
“I was,” Draco nodded. “But we’ve plenty of time. You especially, since he neglected to request that
Draco hoped his nod was assertive, but not overly dismissive. “I have studying to do.” Crawling backwards, he began to retreat from Potter. “Are you coming downstairs?”
Hermione’s brow furrowed in what might have been confusion at Harry’s tone but smoothed out quickly. “Now that your schedule’s finally cleared up to allow you a social life, I think you should expect an invitation to dinner from Molly.”
Holding the scroll within his clenched left fist, Draco imagined the scornful instructions and cruel judgments which he predicted his father would’ve penned. They were always much the same. But thanks to Potter, he didn’t need to read them. The plans that Lucius had for Draco could be irrelevant. They
For some reason, love seemed to be a recurring theme of today. Harry hadn’t had a great experience of it. Maybe Draco deserved to understand Harry’s reluctance.
Harry was still screaming when Draco pushed against Harry’s hand still grasping Draco’s left wrist and used the leverage to flip them both over.
Harry had no idea. This was beginning to feel like Luna’s repeated probing of Harry’s apparent ‘instincts’. Harry thought she was being overly optimistic about his ability to offer input, but she had been pushing him more and more during the couple of months he’d been employed at Ollivanders. And although Harry was enjoying the work, he found it frustrating that he couldn’t always provide a logical reason for his preference for one material over another to form a customer’s wand. A lot of it felt like guesswork. But Luna
As per Ministry requirements, Draco would then be subjected to questions regarding his day’s plans or accomplishments. The same routine was followed at each mealtime, a pointless exercise, since Potter could clearly witness Draco’s activities for himself during the course of the endless days. Potter insisted on sitting
So, instead he enquired, “Why were you in the shop though?” Harry doubted that Draco had gone there seeking a pet.
And the only part of Malfoy that moved was his right hand, towards Harry’s erection. But the hand didn’t make contact, that would be far too easy. Malfoy’s fingers fluttered above Harry’s neglected cock, back and forth along the thick length, so close that Harry could feel the disturbance of air. At Harry’s whimper, Malfoy chuckled.
that it was instincts born from the individual way Harry accessed his magic. And recently, Luna had been encouraging Draco to have the same misguided faith in him.
But the ground was trembling now. Almost lurching beneath Harry’s feet. As with many times before, Harry fought against the tide. Control his breathing and his magic will calm… he knew how to do that; Draco had taught him. Draco. Draco was in the shop; no more than twenty feet away. But Harry wasn’t going to scream out like a damsel in distress. Harry was more than capable of dealing with this
“Draco’ll be entertaining her with detailed descriptions of fancy kitchen equipment he found in the Manor. Possibly not your cup of tea.”
Arms came up to embrace Harry, Draco’s right hand resting on Harry’s back, the left finding the nape of Harry’s neck, fingers stroking in a soothing gesture.
But this was apparently the evening for wishes to come true. A juddering shudder beneath Draco preceded Potter’s orgasm, and that was the last straw for Draco’s tenuous control.
Potter’s expression was a squint of bewilderment as Draco peeled himself up to a sitting position and slid to the edge of the mattress.
Harry didn’t see why that would interest the goblins. “But… the goblins don’t care about Wizarding legal issues. Or the government. They only care about money.”
Malfoy swallowed, swallowed, swallowed… throat muscles deliberately contracting around Harry’s cock, squeezing unbearably as Malfoy’s fingers pressed into Harry’s prostate.
“Perhaps my rates have gone… up,” Harry replied, enjoying his own pun as his hand rose with his last word. “If it’s
“Yes,” declared Draco with a smile, “I polished Harry’s wand. And he polished mine. And Harry’s was so
“No, no…” said Hogswhistle, “It needs… a gentle touch. Persuasion.” Harry had an awful idea of who’s ‘persuasion’ Hogswhistle had in mind. “I was wondering whether the young Minister could… have a look at it.”
“Mr Plonkengarret requires a wand made of this extremely rare wood.” She pointed to an approximately wand-shaped piece of wood on the table. “It’ll be good for helping him to cast with his arthritic hands. But I’m having trouble matching the wood to the most effective core for his specific magical frequency. The samples I made have turned out… iffy.”
tell me stuff like that.” Sometimes Harry was amazed at how efficiently Draco could read him. Harry tried to push the guilt away. Draco briefly brushed his fingers over Harry’s left cheek in silent support of Harry’s attempt. “So, Weasley?”
Although Harry had suspected that he’d be reprimanded for making another noise, Malfoy didn’t acknowledge the infraction. Perhaps he was too busy.
Draco’s patience paid off when Potter began to speak again. “Because they need to believe that everything’s fine. They don’t understand why I’m not. But it’s okay, go down, they’re starting to accept you now. That’s a good thing.” Potter’s smile was subdued, but seemingly honest.
When they were both spent, Harry released his hold on Draco and flopped onto his back, panting from exertion.
Draco stretched his neck, shoving his head back into the pillow as Harry continued to thrust. Harry could feel the effort Draco was putting into reciprocating each forward snap of Harry’s hips. Not an unusual response, but it seemed to Harry that the rolls of Draco’s hips were not only deepening; he was trying to raise himself off the bed.
He doubted that Snape considered himself to be Draco’s Head of House anymore. And McGonagall certainly didn’t. She had welcomed Draco into her fold with frosty reluctance but made it abundantly clear that she wasn’t responsible for him. So, Draco dwelled in limbo between the Houses, given accommodation by one, accepted by none.
. He would’ve been able to anticipate the consequences of asking me to help Michael. He didn’t have all the details, but he
He wasn’t disappointed. Malfoy wasted no time in lining up his erection with Harry’s anus, but paused. Malfoy turned his head in the direction of one of the bedside tables, clearly looking for something.
“Yes, I’d love to taste your cock.” In fact, he was longing to beg for it, but begging was not always well received.
Buried deep beneath the duvet, Draco stretched, the long length of his body creating an intriguing mound before he relaxed back into the softness.
A sinking feeling began to settle in Harry’s stomach. It disturbed him enough that he broke rank and nervously asked, “What do you mean?”
Staring into the light, the memory assaulted him again and the tugging increased. Harry was struck by a knowledge which he had no logical basis for: things would be
“The prospect of having an inexperienced Gryffindor cock like yours ripping my anus open is not appealing.”
Snape’s derision of Draco during class hadn’t improved. Although Draco had noticed that his marks were always honestly high.
That was a better description. Harry had a lingering issue with anything that highlighted how different the activities he enjoyed might be from expected behaviour. But Harry knew what Draco would say about that if he voiced the concern.
voice, and it reverberated all the way down Harry’s spine. “Are you going to beg me for it like a good little whore?”
Draco’s expression was the picture of innocence. Well, as innocent as flushed arousal could be. “Me? Manipulative?”
Malfoy pulled out to the tip before slamming back in; a classic move that Harry expressed his great appreciation for with a moan of delight. After that controlled start, Malfoy abandoned all caution in favour of a rapid pummelling that curled Harry’s toes with its intensity. Malfoy didn’t pause for effect or finesse; he was clearly aiming for sheer force. Exactly what Harry wanted. The pace Malfoy set was brutal. Wood creaked and shuddered as he fucked Harry into the table, just as he’d said he would. And all Harry could do was keep his hands clasped behind him, close his eyes and hang on for dear life.
Harry still didn’t speak. He had no clue what to say. Instead, he discreetly reached out a hand to steady an ornament that had started to rattle on the sideboard beside him. He didn’t want to break anything in the Burrow.
. As so often before during sex with this man, Harry refused to allow himself to orgasm, but this time for entirely different reasons. Not yet, not
the groan of approval. Encouraged, he did it again. The fingers stroking Harry’s neck clenched momentarily, before sliding higher into Harry’s hair to tease the strands.
Even through the fluffiness of the duvet, Harry could see the bump created by Draco’s hand as it travelled down to his groin.
“Hermione, she…” Harry began and, unsurprisingly, stopped. Just because Harry was aware that he needed to talk about certain things didn’t always make it any simpler to do that. But although it might often take him a few attempts, he was improving. He tried again. “Now that I have all this free time on my hands, Hermione wants us both to go out with her and Ron. Molly wants me to go to dinner at the Burrow. And neither of them tend to back down once they get an idea into their heads.”
. And I think they… might be. If they’re not,” Harry glanced at Draco. “Then I still won’t be alone. I have someone who thinks I’m
“I could offer you Pensieve memories of all my covert ogling. But I think that might be a bit creepy.”
Harry did his best, he really did, but he couldn’t completely prevent quiet noises from escaping his mouth when the sadistic git above him began to rock. Just tiny movements, an infinitesimal, graceful rolling of the hips as if Draco was riding him like the gentlest jockey. Draco wasn’t touching Harry’s groin, but he didn’t need to be, each motion was still designed to create friction, driving Harry’s arse into the bed.
Having his groin exposed for Potter’s close scrutiny was thrilling, but the notion of doing this without protection from prying ears made Draco feel nervous. “
That seemed quite a few things that Harry hadn’t been aware of. A little confused and concerned about Draco’s secrecy, Harry decided to tackle the part that’d bothered him first.
Returning to the lounge presented a debate of where to sit. He eyed up the couch, but that would be a bit near to Malfoy. Maybe the chair, although Harry didn’t usually prefer that. He could…
“Not very often. And you haven’t set foot in the Burrow since you were elected. It might even have been before that.” Venturing into risky territory had felt like a foolish manoeuvre to Harry. Still did. “But,” Hermione continued in what Harry privately labelled her ‘appeasing voice’, “I’m glad things are going well with Malfoy. Maybe all four of us could all go out together sometime soon.”
He’d thought the answer to Potter’s question was obvious. But Potter, for all his own valid struggles, hadn’t experienced what it’d been like to live in the Manor. Before, during, or after the Dark Lord’s residence. The oppression never ended.
Potter rose from his seat and wandered over to where Draco sat. Draco tried to resist the temptation to hurl his heavy book at Potter’s face.
As Potter brazenly absorbed himself in his task, something didn’t seem right. Draco couldn’t decide what it was or why he should even
Harry was sobbing openly by the time he felt Malfoy’s body tense and finally still above him, followed a second later by Malfoy’s reverberating, bellowing growl of release. The fingers released their hold on his hair and Harry’s head thumped softly back to the desk as he panted, trying desperately to regain control.
“Talking to you is often akin to having a conversation with a celibate monk, Potter.” Draco attempted to be even
Yearning indeed. Harry wanted every inch of Malfoy in his mouth; it was becoming a burning need. He wanted to be
Draco bit his lip, clearly pondering that. His eyelids fluttered wetly at Harry, as if he were trying to recover himself.
No light in Potter’s eyes. No reaction at all. Which was odd, considering the effort Potter had been putting into his stalking. Draco tried a different approach. Extending an arm, he laid his hand on Potter’s right shoulder.
“I suppose. Your accidental magic gave you exactly what you wanted. And Weasley provided the rest,” Draco snickered.
“Fair enough. I need a pint,” announced Ron as he suddenly stood. “We’ve got time before dinner. Which Mum expects you both to attend, by the way. Come on,” Ron urged Harry.
Come to think of it, Draco knew the book which he’d found in the Manor library had once belonged to Snape.
This was confirmed when Malfoy said, “Wow. Have I mentioned how hot it is when you do things like that?” Harry didn’t think that he had. And Harry had no idea how to reply. “Come on, Potter. We should go before I mess up your nice newly-tidied house with your discarded clothing.” As if Malfoy would ever allow Harry to carelessly scatter his clothes while he disrobed. Well, not within
There were loads of feathers in the drawer for Luna to choose from, but she seemed more interested in watching Harry. Keen to appear as though he was doing a good job, he returned his attention to the stock and decided that he may as well check and itemise the peacock feathers next. This productive style of work was a refreshing change after his previously demanding role.
It didn’t take long before Malfoy tensed behind him and came with shuddering pumps of his hips which Harry did not allow to inspire his own climax. Only just though. So
Draco’s eyes indicated surprise at the apparent reversal of their roles, but he made no effort to prevent it.
Ron accepted the ceramic jar and whispered, “I’m really sorry, Harry,” before he retreated from the pantry and quietly closed the door behind him.
“I broke the windows,” Harry replied, aiming for simplicity as he still monitored his breathing. Although the danger appeared to have passed.
But Draco wasn’t going to be accused of pressurising Potter into anything. Indicating the bottle still clutched in Potter’s hand, he said, “Use it, if you want to.”
Potter regarded him for a little while before a quirked grin lifted the side of his mouth. “Insecurity is kind of appealing on you, Malfoy.”
Draco wanted him to stay as he was; therefore, Harry would do that. Softly humming with the delight of being decisively put in his place, he examined the situation which demanded his attention: cuffed, impaled, and abandoned. How frustrating, humiliating, and
“What’s with all the racket?” Draco demanded as he strode through the open door to the study. “I had to cast a silencing charm before all the screaming scared what’s-his-name out of buying the estate. But thankfully, I think it only made him more intrigued.”
Harry closed his eyes and tried to ignore the irritating tapping on the windowpane. The owl could ruddy bugger off or wait out there until an hour more acceptable for a Saturday. But there was no chance of that, he knew. Owls were selected for their persistent dedication to postal duty and would not be dissuaded merely because they were ignored.
It wasn’t far; Malfoy was seated again on the couch and was pointing to the same spot between his legs that Harry had knelt in earlier. Gingerly, with aching limbs, Harry shuffled over as quickly as he could and bowed his head. Looking down, he regarded his reddened cock and wondered if he would be happier if he was allowed orgasm today or denied it.
. On edge, nervous and dragged down by more guilt and regrets after each time he talked honestly about himself, he felt far removed from the man who’d headed Britain not so long ago. Harry used to juggle dozens of different demands at once, never shirking from a necessary task just because he didn’t like it. Hating his service as Minister for Magic hadn’t made him unable to
,” Harry surprised himself with the laugh that the suggestion pulled forth. “Well, it might. But it’s not going to happen.”
pressure here and loads of other things we can do. Including having a cuddle instead of shagging if that's what you’d like.”
. I liked the idea of being submissive from the time that I started to learn about sex. Long before I’d
“Perhaps a cleaning charm first,” Malfoy suggested. “For both of us,” he added, examining the mess on his shirt.
I'm hoping you know that as well. I also hope you know that you can trust me. I’m… going to stop rambling now.” Malfoy looked at him expectantly. Hopefully, maybe.
Malfoy's fingers brushed across the wetness on Harry’s left cheek, a light touch so different from anyone else’s. It was the same touch that Harry had sometimes felt in quiet evenings, when he’d been exhausted from his demanding schedule and on the brink of sleep, too tired to contemplate anything other than to lie in Draco’s arms.
“That’s it,” said Harry once he’d expelled the coffee from his lungs. He glared at Draco. “You’re no longer allowed to speak to
it would take that recent, upsetting experience and pull it free from Harry. The light would go in and back and find them all… all the bad things… take them and keep them safe. Everything that Harry didn’t want to remember… he only needed to
Draco raised himself to all fours, straddling the motionless body as he peered down, wishing he could see Potter’s face.
Harry felt a kiss to his earlobe before it was released, and Draco’s face came back into view. “Yeah, and half of those are uttered by
“No, I wouldn’t have. You know that," Harry sighed. “Due to a lack of being remotely interested anymore.”
The skin of Malfoy’s back and buttock became firm anchoring points under Harry’s palms as Draco began to thrust their clothed groins together and Harry held on for the ride. Shallow rocking at first, becoming longer, stronger, more insistent, and Harry enthusiastically lifted his hips up to meet each downward movement from the man above him.
For some regrettable reason, it hadn’t occurred to Draco that they’d end up in this position again. Draco had concentrated too much on getting Potter out of the common room. And talking. About anything. He hadn’t thought far enough ahead to form an escape clause before Potter could have another chance to confuse him with those fumbling physical attentions.
, Draco. Only that… that’s what he does. That’s why he approached me today. And what caused… the other thing.” Even after the recent confrontation, Harry still struggled to think about it without shame. An unpleasant notion was brewing for Harry. “And what Ron can’t do, not to my knowledge, is shake off
His mind still thrumming with questions, Harry pulled back before the urge to slide them both back together to the mattress had time to take hold. Harry suspected that the result of that action would be sleep this time though. Hopefully soon. But questions first
“How do you feel?” asked Harry, wishing that the question didn’t sound so clichéd, but wanting to know.
That was too absurd for Harry to believe, but his cock gave an enthusiastic jerk. “No, you haven’t.”
. Harry had finally been given permission, but the incredible things that had been contributing to Harry’s looming orgasm had been taken away.
“Mm,” Martin grunted, and didn’t look up from his notes. Draco noted that a paper airplane had not come for Martin.
When it was time, Draco’s brain caught up with where he was, and what he was about to do. He had to get
Ellingsworth was just clearing her throat at the bottom of the amphitheater when Draco scooted in through the doors. She was a tall witch, perhaps in her late forties, with sandy hair that was never out of its severe ponytail. He dropped to sit in the back row. There were a scattering of other Curse-breakers there, in their dark green robes. Moreover, there were an equal number of scarlet-robed Aurors, all straightening their shoulders to attention when Ellingsworth began to speak.
It did sound good. “Thank you,” Draco confirmed, and Dandelion disappeared again with another crack. His flat wasn’t particularly large. It was… big, but more modest than the Manor had ever been. There was two bedrooms, an office, the sitting room, the kitchen, and a loft over the main foyer that mostly sat unused. He imagined that Dandelion had taken it for her own and made a little nook up there with trinkets she found pleasing that had been brought back from Draco’s field assignments.
Draco sat up a little straighter. He wondered if he was summoned to this meeting by mistake. It wasn’t that he was a poor Curse-breaker. He was
but that didn’t stop the guilt and the nightmares and the knowing that he could live to be a hundred and still not quite reach the redemption he owed.
. Draco followed the stairs up. They were noisy under his feet, but the sound seemed to become swallowed by the residual magic that lingered from the curses.
“Well, Mr. Malfoy, it’s a right pleasure,” Yeltz said, reaching his hand out. Draco shook it, a little confused. It only occurred to him after Yeltz had dropped his hand that his surname didn’t carry much, or any, of the same weight that it did back home. It was fully possibly that Yeltz had never heard of him. Potter, sure. Every witch and Wizard their age or older knew his name. That was sensible. But who knew the minutiae of names involved in a war that didn’t even happen on your continent?
“I trust there will be no issues with the arrangement?” Ellingsworth asked, her voice sharp. Potter shook his head, his expression surprisingly blank. He hadn’t grown in height since the last time Draco saw him, sitting for their N.E.W.Ts together in Defense Against the Dark Arts, after everything, after
Passing the metal gateways was harmless. In fact, nothing even beeped. He gathered up his things on the other side and felt brightly accomplished.
“Field assignments,” Draco said, standing up from his seat and grabbing his Ministry-issued robes from over the back of his chair. They weren’t as nice as ones he would have tailored for himself, but he supposed that kept him humble.
Potter didn’t seem as squished, but then he had considerable less leg. Despite having traded his Muggle world for the Wizarding one, Potter seemed far more comfortable than Draco thought he had the right to. He was navigating every new situation that left Draco’s head reeling with enviable ease. Draco wanted to shout at him to look a little confused, please, for his own dignity. Draco watched as Potter stuck the key into a slot, and twisted it.
, but now he found himself to be muted. He tried to call up some of his more rancorous behavior from his school days (the good ones, that is), but he was just
for your positions.” Her eyes glowered over them all, and one of the Aurors was shifting uncomfortably.
He was feeling less certain by the second.  It was common knowledge that Ellingsworth was a… had been… her parents were… Draco’s brain shuttered through several different iterations of what he was trying to parse through, jerking to a halt before he finished a purist thought.
Shutting the window, Draco went to pamper Hekate, giving her a treat and rubbing his fingers through her feathers until she forgave him for even so much as looking at their earlier intruder. Then, he settled on his couch and looked over the documents and field notes that Potter had sent over. He found, folded up awkwardly underneath some of the more important bits, a sloppily written guide on getting to the Muggle airport, and how to get onto the plane. It certainly didn’t look like Ellingsworth’s handwriting. He wondered if she’d gotten herself a new assistant. If so, she really ought to complain.
The wand was a tricky business. The note had said to cast the same glamour over it, and not touch it until he’d gone through security. It was shoved into the leg of his boot now, just sitting hidden underneath his trousers. When Draco got to the front of the line, he fumbled quite stupidly handing over his boarding pass and the falsified identification card. The tired Muggle working his side of the line didn’t even glance twice, and waved him through.
. Wisps of white-blond hair were falling unattractively from the plaits of his braid, and his face looked paler than usual. He took a moment to stare, displeased, at the deepening bruises underneath his eyes. Looking at himself made him
, it was only one in the afternoon when they landed in Charlotte, North Carolina. Getting off the plane was more of an ordeal than getting on, because all of the Muggles stood up as soon as the plane had pulled into the gate, which effectively caused the whole aisle to get backed up. Draco took back all his earlier marveling at the Muggles’ ability to create the flying machine in the first place, seeing as they couldn’t form an orderly queue to save their lives.
. Well, no. The whole contraption was big enough, but inside Draco felt the need to duck his head just a tad as he shuffled awkwardly down the middle aisle, rows and rows and rows of seats on either side of him, and then one more on the left-most side. The seats went nearly all the way to the back end of the space. The first few rows were much roomier, and Draco’s stomach sank the further Potter lead them back into the plane towards their own seats. Each row seemed to get smaller and more cramped than the last.
At least he was smart. That, Draco could say with certainty. He’d gotten marks in seven N.E.W.Ts and that was enough to slap down on Ellingsworth’s desk in a hope that maybe he could get by without a big to-do over his name. Everyone
Draco wanted to ask if he could feel it, but for the most part, Potter seemed unfazed by the house. It was making Draco dizzier than he already was from the flight and lack of sleep, and the regrettable feeling as if he had traveled backward in time. He sidled past Potter in the foyer, following the creaking hall further back into the rest of the house. The floor plan opened up into a small sitting room, opposite of which was a cramped doorway into the kitchen.
. But he had grown in width, broader in the shoulders than Draco remembered. They hadn’t spoken back then, and it seemed as if Potter was about to see if he could make it through this situation without speaking to him now, either.
Draco’s fitting punishment had been a slap on the wrist, and confiscation of his wand for eight months. In comparison to some of the other Slytherins caught up in the war their parents had begun, it was practically a vacation. In comparison to his own parents, it had been nothing at all. Father was gone. He hadn’t repented, in the end. To the very last, he had dug in his heels and even when it was over, even when he could have lied, he held his chin proudly (Proud of what, Draco often had to wonder?) and accepted the Kiss with misplaced dignity only the Malfoys were capable of.
The conversation dropped off, after that. Draco preferred the silence, so he didn’t bother to try striking it up again. Potter didn’t seem keen, either, and so they sat with their three chairs between them, each staring out over the tarmac and waiting for the Muggle announcer to tell them it was time to start boarding.
“Where are the field notes?” Draco asked, peeking over his shoulder into the back seat of the car where Potter had tossed his backpack. He reached behind and pulled it into the front seat, wedging it down between his feet.
“So, we mapped everything out for you on here,” Yeltz said, opening the map. “Don’t you worry none, this baby is charmed to let you know if you’re goin’ off path. Figured it couldn’t hurt none, long as no Muggles get a hold of it. Course, woulda done the same to the car, but… well, best not risk it.”
, because on the other side of the line there were… Draco could only picture them as gateways. They looked like metal and plastic door frames that were stood side by side, with lines of people waiting to go through them. Down at the end, one beeped loudly, and the Muggle trying to shuffle through stepped back and dug in his pockets before dropping a clatter of Muggle coins in a basket, sat on
When the plane rolled itself for a while, there was a heavy rushing noise as it began to pick up speed, now in a straight line. The momentum made Draco feel as if he had left his stomach several hundred metres back on the asphalt. When the whole nose of the plane tipped up, Draco gave into instinct and slammed his eyes shut, breathing embarrassingly deep through his nose. He couldn’t
He’d been acting under something else, too. Maybe just a little. Something that Draco was worried might still be inside of him, generational, passed from father to son. Something dark, something evil, that he wouldn’t otherwise be able to escape. It was the starring number in the many nightmares Draco had found himself plagued with since the last dregs of his teenage years. His own hand, lifting his wand, doing things he couldn’t fathom to speak in his waking hours. He often thought that it said something about him, something
There was lots of standing about in an airport. There was standing about to get into the damn place, and then more standing about to get on the plane, then standing about inside the plane, and now there was standing about waiting for the holes in the wall and the looping conveyor belt to spit out their luggage. Draco’s wand hand itched. He could
Hannah Ellingsworth was the head Curse-Breaker. She was also every bit as inconvenient as she could possibly be when it came to making sure that Draco had only the barest amount of time possible to finish the unwieldy paperwork that came along with each new field assignment. Draco was sure that Ellingsworth wasn’t very fond of him. Which, well… fair. There were few and far between that were fond of Draco by his family name alone. He’d only just begun to have small talk about the weather with Martin, and they’d been sharing an office for just over a year now.
his father, and Draco couldn’t bring himself to feel much more than a hollow emptiness every time someone said, “Oh,
average intelligence. And yet, a Muggle airport was proving to be even more challenging than the fourth-year hedge maze. Even thinking about it, even in such vague terms, causes a twinge of displeasure at his temples.
Amphitheater 16 was a bit of a walk from his office, which sat tucked at the very end of a long series of halls of his particular wing. Of course, like most things surrounding him these days, Draco was entirely sure that this office placement wasn’t by chance. His name was on the office, after all, right underneath Martin’s. No one wanted to walk by the golden-font
Potter’s face scrunched up unpleasantly. “I noticed that,” he said. “I read through them last night.”
Their gate was all the way at the end of one of the long, window-lined halls. They found seats facing the tarmac, and when they sat, Draco allowed there to be three seats between them. There was a flat, black box hanging on the wall with information that was already printed on their boarding pass:
nights ago to Draco, now. But he supposed that was the dregs of Ministry work. He hoped after they looked about the crime scene in Laurel Fork that they could immediately find some place to rest. He wouldn’t say no to being unconscious for the next twelve hours. “Before or after you realized you’d stormed out of the amphitheatre with my copies and had to send them to my flat by owl?”
was his element. And even if Ellingsworth had chosen him to go to America as a punishment, he wasn’t about to let that stop him from doing what he was, quite frankly, excellent at. Even if he had Potter breathing down his neck the entire time, waiting for him to slip up and do something… evil, or whatever it is people thought he was up to, these days.
“Gracious of you.” Draco traced the red line of the map with his finger, intending to follow from Roanoke to the next town, but just as he was, the map made a pleasant ringing noise.
“Young and Travis,” Ellingsworth began to read. A Curse-breaker with brown skin and sleek black hair popped up from her seat, as well as a barbarian of an Auror, twice the width as Draco in the shoulders. They greeted each other rather shyly before Ellingsworth handed them a file, and gestured for them to sit back down and start going over it together.
was just a little smattering of buildings, more like, located along the highway. It wasn’t even in North Carolina, as far as Draco could tell. According to the map, they would drive right across a state line into Virginia to get to it. As he tapped the map with his wand to show a miniature of the town, the state of the town didn’t look promising.
A hand touched him plainly between the shoulder blades. The touch was so unfamiliar that it took all of Draco’s muscle control not to jump out of his skin. It was brief, this touch, only long enough to gather his attention to the man sidling up to his left. Potter looked far more at ease and put together than Draco could ever hope to have managed. He had some kind of bag strapped to his back, with more comfortable Muggle clothing than Draco had thought to wear. It took Draco a moment to really comprehend that Potter was there, standing by him, looking less furious than he had the night before at the assignment briefing.
Finally, Draco turned his head to look at him, and found Potter staring right back. His expression behind his glasses was calm, maybe amused. Draco still couldn’t suss out what it was about Potter’s face that made him feel as if he was being gently mocked. The three seats of space between them seemed excessive now, but Draco wasn’t about to be the one to move. So they sat, at an impasse, staring at one another in an increasingly uncomfortable silence.
Muggle car together for Merlin only knows how long. So, why don’t you continue not thinking about me, and I’ll continue not thinking about you, and in three months, or
at what he did, but Ellingsworth didn’t seem to want to bother with all the fuss that it would be sending a Malfoy out onto the more extreme cases. Draco had spent the last year and a half toiling through domestics and old, feeble family curses.
“Gruesome, these curses, aren’t they?” Draco said, more to himself than Potter. The sun was inching through the sky, getting fatter and heavier, and it came hot through the window. Potter had rolled up the sleeves of his shirt, and the sun fell through the window across them, putting them in danger of making them browner than the rest of his skin.
The sweaty little man got all red in the face as they approached, nearly dropping his sign. “Mr. Potter,” he said, in a voice that had the strangest, rolling accent that Draco had ever heard. It was almost impossible to understand him with the way he drew out every single vowel. “Well, if we aren’t pleased as peaches to see you here.”
“Right,” Ellingsworth said. “Martinez and Harper, you’ll be partnered. We’ll discuss Apparition for the two of you. The rest of you will be expected on flights to America and Canada in the morning. I trust each and every one of you remember that earning marks on your N.E.W.Ts in Muggle Studies was
Draco watched as the Curse-breakers began to pair off with their Aurors, and his eyes flickered over the remaining few. From his seat in the back row, he couldn’t gauge much about the rest of the Aurors, but he was hoping for what looked like a slight witch with pale blond hair in a high ponytail, if only because she seemed pleasant and eager to be there.
printed across the front. Draco did his best to stamp down any annoyance. He was here, too. In fact, he was imperative to helping out the American Bureau of Magic. Potter was an Auror, he probably couldn’t break some of the most common curses. It wasn’t his forte. Draco, on the other hand. It was his
There were so many signs that pointed exactly nowhere. Draco considered himself intelligent. In fact, he was certain that he was
Draco managed to work out where to go with his luggage- charmed, of course, so that any Muggle looking at it would find it to be perfectly average. His scribbled note had said the Muggle workers would peek inside his baggage while he went through security, which Draco found a touch obscene. Still, he took it to the Muggles behind the counter, and stood in awe at how slow and inefficient this whole ordeal was. When he finally had his baggage checked, a line at his security gate had formed, and was moving at a crawl.
Thank you Julia for tirelessly editing all of the times I misspelled "breathe" and fixing all of the mistakes that come with typing up an entire chapter almost exclusively while not even looking at the screen.
“What don’t you understand?” Draco asked, irritated that he had to play along with whatever game Potter had devised in his head to torture him for the remaining hour of this drive.
The car roared to life, but Draco was expecting that, at the very least. His seat rumbled under his legs, and he leaned heavily against the back, blinking stupidly out the front window. To his credit, Potter did seem to know what he was doing as he backed the thing out of the spot it had been parked in, and managed to get them going front-ways again. It was
Draco made a noise in the back of his throat, and leaned his head back against the seat. The knots of his braid pressed against his skin. It seemed every aspect of this was designed to be as uncomfortable as possible. He kept his eyes shut and tried very hard not to think about the miniature London just below his feet, or what the ocean might look like when he would, inevitably, look out the window again.
was wrong with Muggles that they kept inventing metal contraptions for transportation and making them the worst experience known to man, magical or otherwise? His stomach twisted unpleasantly every time the car went vaulting forward, and then slowing to a quick and shuddering stop.
that Potter still held onto grudges from the war. The fact that Draco couldn’t figure out what he was doing or saying that caused Potter to go from polite to cold didn’t matter either. They were stuck together, and they would have to just get their job done as quickly as Muggle transportation allowed so that they could go home and resume their previous lives of never running into each other. He folded open the map again, following the little red line from Laurel Fork to the next town: Roanoke.
It felt quite like cold ice being thrown down his spine. He didn’t know what to say to that, so he said nothing. And what
Draco wished he wouldn’t say that so loudly. They were moving through an open atrium now, towards a small office door that none of the Muggles seemed to notice. Yeltz let them in, and inside there was a cozy little space with a few desks, and, thankfully, another few wizards working at them.
“Do you know where we’re supposed to be meeting Yeltz?” Draco asked, following after Potter through the crowds of Muggles.
Yeltz didn’t seem all that soothed, but perhaps it was the novelty of the bloody Savior of their World standing right in his office, just another body to boss around, that brought his attention away from Draco. Yeltz’s face stayed red and damp as he began to fold the map back up. “Well, alright then. These here are some useful Muggle technology,” Yeltz continued as he pointed to the two little rectangles with screens. One was grey, and the other was a garish pink.
I still don't know anything about Virginia or what Joanne says about American Wizards! Hope you're in for a fun time with me!
Draco thought, irritated. He wasn’t going to dignify that with a response, so he just kept staring at the suddenly illegible words of Roanoke’s field notes. He couldn’t focus, what with the blood rushing so hard in his ears.
As they came out of the terminal, a short, squat man with dark hair and a sweaty face was holding a little sign with
For Draco’s part (small as it was, in the grand scheme of it all), he had sat on a very tense and uncomfortable trial, seventeen and frightened and squirming while his bare-bones character witnesses testified that he had been acting under the duress of his parent’s wishes, and threat of death. Which he
Thank you so much to Julia for all of their hard work in editing this chapter and keeping me from getting discouraged during the writing process! I'm sorry this took so long, but the story wasn't done being told, which means there's a fifth and final chapter being written and on the way.
He might still not get a scone, but Harry felt certain that something interesting would result from an imaginative suggestion. There were lots more things to explore. And Harry might even be brave enough to make a few suggestions of his own. Starting with appropriate usage of that vibrator. Hmm, Harry wondered if George stocked restraints. They hadn't tried that yet. Could be a nice combination.
Neither was Draco, he supposed, but that didn’t stop Draco from stroking his fingers along Harry’s cheek before he nudged him to keep walking.
“The joke shop from Hell?” Harry asked, suspecting he knew exactly where Draco was referring to, but surprised enough that Draco would willingly go there to want to confirm whether he was right.
“Do you want to pick up where we left off?” Harry asked, incredulous at how quickly Draco could appear to recover. But appearances weren’t always true.
confused, he had no idea. Maybe it’d been the crawling. Or the uncharacteristic praising of good behaviour. Or the mention of playing with something. Or Harry was just losing his mind. Whatever had caused the anomaly, Harry hoped he’d be lucky and Malfoy wouldn’t have heard.
But that didn’t seem right. It hadn’t been unwarranted. There had been a reason, Harry was sure. But Harry shouldn’t be concerned about that.
If Harry leaned back much further, he was going to be horizontal. But he gave it a try, surprising himself by how far back he could go while keeping his feet on the floor. It became much more difficult to maintain any leverage for rocking his hips, and Harry’s stomach muscles burned with the effort of maintaining the steep angle. But he
More shuffling. Draco was contemplating the use of a foot-sticking charm just before Potter started to mumble, his head bowed to the floor.
He looked around his limited view, searching for something to divert his attention. Draco’s Pygmy Puff was still on the bedside table, squeaking contentedly to herself while Harry fought to find internal stability. Jemima appeared to be completely at one with her own happiness and serenity.
Harry had no issue with destroying the portrait if that was what Draco wanted. “Okay. Just let me know… when.”
When he reappeared at his destination, he shivered in the cold air. It was a pretty morning; the promise of sunshine beginning to permeate white, fluffy clouds. Harry strolled around the corner to the café that he was sure Hermione would already be waiting within. Probably impatiently tapping her watch.
Although dressed in the uniform of a Slytherin, Draco wasn’t regarded as such by any members of his house. Draco’s attempts to sit at the Slytherin table had resulted in open hostility, and he couldn’t imagine a more welcoming response from any of the other houses. So, Draco retreated to the kitchens or the library during mealtimes. It was easier for everyone.
Harry shifted his legs out from under him, muscles cramping from holding their position. Inevitably, he was spurred on by Draco’s growled impatience.
Standing with his bum cheeks cupped in Draco’s hands, surrounded by a shelved assortment of food products and the door leading to the Weasleys to his right, Harry wasn’t sure how to react.
. I can’t get it to respond to me, and I’m not selling it unless I figure out exactly what it is. Our personal Auror would be upset if I unleashed something unfortunate onto the Wizarding population,” Draco added with a smirk.
, Potter.” The grey eyes indicated affront, but Harry wasn’t that easily fooled; the corner of Draco’s mouth was twitching with amusement.
“I might be many things, Potter… but I’m not that. This,” he indicated the bottle in his clenched palm, “merely helps things to… slide a little easier. I use it for wanking, mostly.” Draco hoped the admission would help to steady Potter’s nerves.
. Wanting Harry where he was ‘meant’ to be. A more sexually assertive Harry. Harry Potter: in control. And if Harry didn’t want to be in control, it was fine to
Once Harry and Draco had both reached the covered portrait, Draco put a hand on Harry’s shoulder and positioned him to stand next to Draco at a deliberate distance from the wall.
