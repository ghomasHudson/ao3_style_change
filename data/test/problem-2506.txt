Going over the available healers, Harry imagined that not one of them would want to treat Lucius Malfoy. They would, of course, because their oath demanded it, but with great reluctance at best. Molly Weasley was the next that came to mind. As a mother of seven, she certainly knew how to treat dirty scratches. Yet, considering the animosity between Arthur Weasley and Lucius Malfoy, Harry did not want to put her in a position where she had to care for someone, who insulted her husband on a regular basis.
−−O−O−−
Though Neville was brilliant with plants, his knowledge of healing spells was only marginally better than Harry’s.
"Thank you," the older wizard replied earnestly. "For making the effort. Now go. You have drawn-out … your lunch-break enough."
The platinum-haired pureblood could not help but feel a tiny bit proud of his son, for having the guts to so openly ignoring the wizard who commanded his … well, actually, all of their fates, and being appalled at his lack of manners. He and Narcissa had raised him better! Lucius pondered if he should remind his son, but was concerned that he would be overstepping his boundaries.
"I can't give you a wand, not yet anyway. But I can make sure you are protected."
"Be my guest," he replied tonelessly.
Strangely enough that detached downright cold description made her partner chuckle, "I see, so when you play with Sandy's little rascals, that is just you being a good guest."
--O-O--
"No, it doesn't," Harry sighed, frustrated because Draco seemed unable to let go of the past. "But all Teddy knows of you is that you are named after stars. That you were nice to him. And that you brewed him a potion. What you have done in the past, is of no importance, only what you do now matters."
"And you did not think to tell me!"
After a few moments of silence, Severus inquired, "Why are you so worried?"
"Thank you."
After Hogwarts and magic and Horcrux versus Hallows, Harry had troubles reconciling everything that had happened with the picture of an arbitrary god, that guided everyone's fate. Also, it was easier not to believe in an almighty, divine power that allowed a baby to lose his parents and then be abused, in what was supposed to be his home for ten consecutive years.
With a sigh, the raven-haired sank to the floor, pulling both Emerald and Kreacher into his arms. The later moved rather stiffly but gave up his resistance after a few moments. "It's okay. I know the two of you have tried your best. Kreacher, stop punishing yourself. We'll find another way." Looking up at his colleagues, he repeated hopefully, "We will, won't we?"
"Not really," the raven-haired shook his head, somewhat apologetic. Neville seemed to feel uncomfortable with the entire topic, and that had certainly not been his intention.
When the panic receded a little, so did Harry. But that was the opposite of what Severus wanted. He could not be alone again or go to sleep. He was weak, and his occlumency shields were virtually non-existent. He had been reduced to this pathetically whimpering creature, that used its last strength to reach out to his best friend's son in the pitiful attempt not to be abandoned. Regrettably, his strength was barely enough to make his fingers twitch towards the young wizard. And Harry was misinterpreting the gesture entirely.
"You turned your back on our master!"
When Lucius looked at him puzzled, the young man smiled again. "And you don't understand either, do you? Even though it is
"Your governess?"
"It's a potion!" Teddy insisted, pointing at the stove. "See, he used a cauldron."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Of course. Harry has shared your qualification in detail."
"Thank you, professor," the couple replied. Handing over the unicorn-hair for safekeeping, Ron chuckled, "You know, most of the time, I forget that Flickwick is part goblin and then he says things like that."
When he stood before her, once more, body glistening with oil, hair bone-dry, and perfectly coifed, she shook her head and made a noise of deep disappointment. "It seems that you are not as fast on the uptake as I have hoped. That was thirty-two minutes, and your eyeliner is black." Weaving her wand, Draco's hands snapped to the small of his back, and he was frozen before he could utter a single word in his defense. "We will try your front this time. Maybe seeing the marks in the mirror will help you to better yourself."
Laughing slightly hysterical at the absurdity of the situation, the raven-haired challenged, "You know how I feel about your future husband, yet what you chose to chide me about is my crude language?"
"This artefact belongs to the Library!" Christopher Pendragon bristled, but Alexander Pince secured it in a belt-pouch. "And it will be returned to the Library, as soon as everything is back to normal. Do your research, Mr Pendragon. No more shortcuts. We will support you to the best of our abilities, but I cannot allow you to interfere like this again. Messing with time is dangerous, and your research now expands beyond these walls."
He met Draco's evaluating gesture at his last statement with a barked laugh. "Let us say, he is mostly sane. After all, he is helping a family that held him captive once."
"Harry, I don't think you should, …" Ron had cautioned, but his friend had already touched the canvas. Magic shimmered over the surface, making all the colours much more vibrant and then … then the Potters had blinked and tilted their heads as if waking from a long sleep.
The next few days continued in the same pattern. Draco exhausted himself with physical labour, with little sleep on the side, or so Lucius presumed from the dark circles that bloomed under his son's eyes. Their master even forced tea and chocolate on him once, before cruelly shooing him back into the garden, after the boy had barely touched his meal, asserting that he was not hungry.
Behind them, the Lady Malfoy was not as easily convinced to take something that was not hers. "Blood will work, Harry. You don't have to …"
"Scourgify," Harry cast, banishing any lingering traces of dirt, shaking his head.
Unable to meet his liege's burning gaze, the former Lord lowered his eyes while admitting quietly. "Yes."
"Be that as it may," she brushed off the rude interruption. "Tell me something: If our situations were reversed, would you allow me to work in front of a cauldron with possible volatile ingredients?"
"Not from himself." Severus agreed reluctantly. He did not like it, but it was true, nonetheless.
"Don't you want another pet around?" Neville gazed at his friend, before studying the map over his shoulder.
"But …," the young Auror contradicted helplessly, gesturing towards his vassal. Still, he knew that the Head Auror would not have come, were it not important. Drooping, he mumbled, "What about Malfoy?"
“I could, he didn't hurt a vein after all, but I’m not sure if I should. I don’t want to give him blood poisoning, by sealing wounds that have not been cleaned properly.”
"Are?" Harry supplied.
"And you think tonight will be dangerous?" She returned to spelling Luna's hair to stay put, no matter the amount of running and dodging about to happen. Augusta only hesitated for a heartbeat, when the girl nodded with an unusually severe expression. "Follow me, child."
Neville had a hard time to suppress the horror that crept into his voice as he replied. "Because that is not something we do. It would shame not only the couple but their families as well. And who would ever associate with a divorcee?"
"Basically," the witch agreed. Judging the condition of her patient, Emilia revealed, "He has grown stronger these last two weeks. His vitals are a lot more stable, but you should not risk straining him. Even if the young Mr Malfoy can brew the antidote, his body has a lot of healing to do. Not only due to the coma, but also because the last months of the war took nearly all his magical reserves. He is going to be incredibly weak, Harry."
−−O−O−−
Twenty minutes later, Neville Longbottom found Luna enjoying the spring sun while hanging upside down from the big oak tree in the back garden of Longbottom Manor. She had already changed out of her work clothes, wearing an overall and a lavender shirt with little daisies. With the golden sun illuminating her, Neville took his time to savour the moment. His beloved's golden locks were brushing over the leaves on the floor, and the happy smile on her face just added to the serenity of the scene. He mirrored her smile when he approached. "Professor Snape sends his greetings."
Nodding, the woman replied, with a benevolent smile. "That would be lovely, thank you Mr Longbottom, Mr Potter."
"St. Mungo's," the young man whispered. "She and Frank had been admitted to the Janus Thickery Ward, not long after Neville's first birthday. I don't know the details, because Neville doesn't like to talk about it. All I know is that Bellatrix Lestrange tortured them with the Cruciatus … and it went on too long."
Sampling the wine he had been served, finding it to his liking, Lucius took another sip, before joining the dinner conversation. "Those were the only times you were allowed to use a goblet instead of your usual water-glass, Draco. You insisted since you were allowed a 'grown-up-drink' as well."
Shoulders slumping, they all looked at the sleeping boy. He had inherited his mother's metamorphmagus-gene, but today proved that his father's lycanthropy had also been thrown into the mix. Nobody could say how strong the werewolf-curse would be … whether he would ever transform. But it was a smart move of his grandmother to ensure the services of one of the best Potion Masters in Britain.
Rising on his elbows from where he had relaxed on the carpet - he loved that carpet, red and gold and black suited the room so much better than the dull grey colour scheme it had had before - Harry tousled his unruly strands. "You know, that might even work. I guess it all depends on how I voice my questions."
"An O in Defence against the Dark Arts and Transfiguration. An E in Herbology and Charms, but only because Neville and Hermione tutored me."
Once the door had fallen shut, Harry explained, still on his knees a foot away from Astoria. "I will call my house-elves now. One will prepare some tea, and the other will fetch Narcissa Malfoy."
Pulling his wand, Harry cradled his former professor's hand and hissed at the leather-cuff he had made for Severus. The older wizard's quiet groan had him look up, alarmed, "Is it hurting you?"
"Now hold still," a wet voice berated him.
"Don't worry, Lady Malfoy." Ginny put the hostess mind at ease. Holding up two brown paper−bags with a mermaid on one side. "George and I brought enough refreshments for all of us."
The 'golden trio' and Draco were the last to lounge in the living room. Only when the final embers of the fire sparked out, did Ron sigh, "I guess it's time to go to bed."
Nodding, Charles confirmed that. "It seems probable. And having gained her blond prize, it seems unlikely for her not to make use of him. Evidently, she's been after him since Yule."
"Not really, it's just …" Harry trailed his finger through his hair. "Some things have a way of leaving a mark on your soul. Until now, Draco was …," he sighed. "I just wish it didn't have to be him. But I must admit that I am glad that he found the courage. It was the right thing to do."
After a moment, where Draco had merely stared at his plate, hiding his trembling fingers under the table, he added in a mere whisper, "I am sorry, my Lord. I did not mean to anger you."
Resigned, the blond admitted, "I'm at the end of my wits. While I may theoretically have an idea on how to stabilise the poison, I lack the means to actually try it. I need some basics. Without them, I'm virtually useless."
"But this is a muggle library!" Prince sighed, and Harry added, "From everything we know, Chris Draca - the second librarian who got abducted here - was not even a squib. Nothing justifies magical concealment."
Astoria chuckled, "He knows you are the best carver for wands there is. He will lay off in the end."
Allowing the young man to help him back to bed, not admitting - not even to himself - how drained he felt, the Potion Master sank back into the pillows, shaking his head, "That is not … what I have asked. Are you happy?"
Thinking back to the day the Auror had gotten buried under a house, the young pureblood shrugged. "It wasn't all sunshine and roses. But you were in good hands. Father had managed to convince himself, that he could support you best if he tried to help with the case. It got better when you came back to Grimmauld Place."
The pureblood pondered this for a few moments, before swearing, "I will do everything I can, so you won't regret giving us this chance. I will work hard to prove you right." Because, despite everything, this young man had suffered in his short life, he still thrived to make their world a better place. After the horrors Voldemort had put them through, Harry Potter was able to push away prejudice that had been as natural as breathing for Lucius Malfoy his entire life. He had even overcome any sense of pride that might stand in the way of convicting a felon, by accepting help from a former enemy. Lucius could see that, between the two of them, Potter was the better man and that simple realisation would help him in days to come to bend to his will, even without the vow.
"Of course," Draco added quietly, not looking up.
Once at the ministry, Harry had sent a message to Hermione. Friday morning after breakfast, she and a baby−Auror had knocked at the Manor, ready to escort Lucius to the Ministry. Though Narcissa had offered tea, Harry had barely had time to bid them goodbye. Still, before he had left, he took a moment to hug his best friend. "Thank you, Hermione. I don't know what I would do without you."
"I thought …," the former Lord explained quietly, but was interrupted, "Charlie, thanks for bringing her around, but …"
Draco's glanced to the side before smiling as he tilted his head. "You are welcome. It is easy to find the correct answers if the right questions are asked. You have learned a lot since Hogwarts."
Once both had claimed comfortable seats, Severus stated, "I would request you not adding a picture to my décor. I don't feel entirely comfortable with the idea of being watched."
Instead of answering right away, the raven-haired clutched his best friend's robes and rode out another wave of pain, before he was able to reply. "It didn't fit the design."
Twisting from side to side, Harry asked tense, "Excuse me?" He might be an Auror, but him hearing voices never boded well.
Only sheer determination held Lucius Malfoy upright when flooing to his doom.
"Yesterday, you said …"
Baffled, the blond wizard burst out, "You have got to be kidding me!"
With Teddy vanishing into Mr Lovegood's home and Neville showing the Malfoys around, Harry circled the house. On his second round, he found Luna perching over the front door in a knitted dress with warm leggings but bare feet. "Hello, Luna, how are you today?"
--O-O--
"Ruby cannot tell the wizards of any of Mistress' guests. Mistress does not entertain guests in her home!"
Shrugging, Hermione reminded him, "He is courting Astoria."
Hermione saw through him obviously, knowing him too well, but she still nodded. "Sure, … great … see you later."
"Three days ago, you questioned me."
Turning towards the carpet, the older woman slowly started to connect the dots. "Sirius is not part of the family, so Harry can't be either … not in the eyes of magic, never mind that his claim is entirely legal." It all made sense now. All the times Harry had spent on erecting new wards. The begrudging acceptance of the house elf that refused to call him 'Master'.
Hesitantly reaching out, as if he was unsure if he was even allowed, Harry covered Severus' trembling fingers with his warm, steady hand. "For the same reason I did everything else: So, you would have a choice after you woke. It's no different from this room, Draco's 'inheritance' or the Order of Merlin. If you want to brew again, I knew you would never be content with pepper-ups or dreamless sleep. Given the time, you can create something amazing, I know it! You only need the tools of your trade. In this case …" he gestured over the magazines, "a jump-start to get up to date on recent developments. When you feel confident enough to step in front of a cauldron again, we'll find a way to make that happen."
It was past seven already. Draco's words pulled him out of his frantic thoughts when reminding him. “I should go back to the Manor. I … if …, I have nothing else to offer. I’m sorry I woke you.”
Well aware of the Weasleys' financial situation, Griphook demanded, "How?"
"I will leave for the Manor right after breakfast," Harry stated the next morning.
. So, what happened? Why are the two of you not together, raising the statistically 1,17 perfect children, our couples have on average, in the perfect house, with the white picket fence your fairy tale books are all about?"
“Because of your one redeeming quality.” Rising, Harry prompted. “Let’s go. We have a lot of work ahead of us.”
Sighing, Harry sat up, "Fine, what's wrong?"
"Not really."
Smiling like the viper she had become, Astoria challenged, "Try and stop me."
"Dinner is ready."
Hugs and Kisses to all of you. I hope you liked it ;).
"Warden of the South, guardian of the heart, protect us!" Harry finished, closing the circle.
Instantly handing back the laptop, Arthur joined his wife on the living room floor. Though he looked excited, he chided his children, "We all agreed that you lot would not spend any money on us."
“And why would I do that?” The pureblood reared.
"What?" Hermione snapped irritated, not enjoying being left out. Immediately she claimed the book. "Valerian Root? All we need is Valerian Root to stabilise the damn poison?"
"That's something entirely different," Astoria protested. "Those are your nieces. And they are a delight to be around."
Four days into his recovery, his mind finally made the connection: What was Draco Malfoy, a former Death Eater doing in Harry Potter's home? And it was clear that he was not around to visit on Severus' behalf, since he barged into his quarters every hour of every day, in various states of dressing. Once he had even entered in his pyjamas, shouldering Potter aside, who had woken him from his latest nightmare, pouring dreamless sleep down his throat. The former spy had not been able to puzzle out the relationship between the two, too grateful to get at least a few hours of undisturbed rest.
Pulling his wand, Harry cradled his former professor's hand and hissed at the leather. The older wizard's quiet groan had him look up, alarmed, "Is it hurting you?"
Make it stop.
Frowning, his father recalled the children's tale. "They are from 'The Tale of the Three Brothers'. It's a story from Beedle the Bard. >There were once three brothers who were travelling along a lonely, winding road at twilight.<."
Calmly, Draco turned towards his father. "Of course, I did. Who else would I built it for?" After a moment, where nobody said a word, the young wizard held out his hand. "Leash and collar, if you please. I assume you followed your liege's instructions to the letter."
Tears rose in Hermione's eyes, as she whispered, "Have you ever considered that he simply does not want to live this way? Think about his situation. He was always self-reliant, navigating the demands of Dumbledore while pulling the wool over Tom's eyes. He was ready to die in the war, maybe even hoped for it, for the chance to see your mum again. But now he is lying in that bed, unable to walk, to talk, to use magic. He is dependent on others for the simplest things. For a man like Severus Snape, that must be torture."
Looking at the grown-ups, the young boy inquired. "Is Harry sad because Sirius has no leaf?"
Trying to regain his composure through the horrors of this tale, it was really no surprise that their Lord had been utterly mad in the end, the pureblood shook his head. "But that does not explain him dying. Narcissa said that he was alive after Vol… Voldemort hit him with the curse."
Rubbing the bridge of his nose, Severus stated, "I assume Harry made that rule?"
"Yes?"
"No problem, Lord Potter-Black. Please, come in. Have you had dinner yet?" Astoria guided Harry into the small, yet tasteful living-room of Daphne's apartment.
"You are beyond reason!" Snape accused, throwing up his arms.
how our first conversation of the week should have gone. And why should I care about Dolohov anyway? He's a convicted Death-Eater who messed up his probation."
Hermione's trial on Wednesday went rather well too; cementing Lucius Malfoy's position at the Department of Magical Law. So, Harry was looking forward to a lazy Friday and his first relaxing weekend in more than a month. Of course, all of his carefully laid out lack of plans were shot to high heavens, when someone pounded on his door in the small hours of Friday morning. Growling, he made his way down the stairs, catching up with Draco on the second landing. Irritated, the blond asked, "What, by Merlin, is going on?"
"And that you shared her warmth since you were a hair's width away from hypothermic shock," Narcissa added, running a wand over his slightly trembling form. The moment the parchment from the diagnostic spell detached from its tip, she handed the wand back to Ron.
This time, the memories brought tears to her eyes. Still, Hermione nodded as well.
Incredulous at this man’s cruelty - letting someone starve was never a suitable punishment in Harry’s eyes - the young wizard leaned over the desk and stated in a dispassionate tone, “Since the former Lord Malfoy is back home, you will double these rations. You will add twenty eggs, five pounds of flour and seeds for various vegetables, as well as a book on how to care for them.”
Clenching her husband's hand, his mother wanted to know, "How did you survive?"
"Not yet," Draco shook his head. "Believe me, Astoria, I am honoured by the proposal. But this concerns not only myself. I need to talk to Harry as well as my parents."
An hour later found the four men in the kitchen. Lucius and Harry had returned to their work so documents littered half of the kitchen−table. On the other half sat the toddler in his accustomed high−chair, bent over a long scroll, explaining to the blond, who was stirring a smoking cauldron on the stove. "And he was the guard of the pear−tree …"
"And mine for the last four," Emilia replied.
"Preferable," Draco and Harry corrected in one voice.
"No," Harry assured immediately. Then, as if to probe an aching tooth to see if the pain got worse, he repeated, "What about Peter?"
Taking notes, the brunet requested, "We need the name and address of the apothecary or the name of the Potion Master who provides your potions. Also, the bottles you both took from last night."
"Sorry," Harry mumbled sheepishly, slipping into the room.
Around seven the same day, Daphne and Harry parted ways in the Atrium of the Ministry. Neither had found any more rest that night, so they had decided to go in early. The young Auror headed for his department with but a departing nod, while the Inquisitor went … wherever she went.
“What? Why?”
we succeed, we will want to shout it from the roof of Hogwarts. Telling you will be no hardship."
"Yea," the young wizard sighed. "I just don't like it."
"Of course, she did! You are part of the family now."
Leaning over to kiss his forehead, Andromeda smiled. "You are welcome, nephew."
Draco's steadily softening speech was harshly interrupted, by Harry setting down his cup with unnecessary force. Icily, he glared at his opposite. "This witch is one of the few people I trust. Not with my life but with something infinitely more valuable. If you ever come across her again, you will politely step out of her way. In the unlikely case that she asks you for something, you will provide it and you will never ever interfere with her again. Have I made myself clear?"
Offering a word of caution, Lucius inquired, "Are you sure it is wise to leave a pregnant woman alone with a possible adversary who can clearly cast very advanced magic? With but one Auror for protection?"
The moment Lucius had started bleeding, trying to keep himself in check, she had been anxious.
Hesitant, since he could not think of anything of common interest between Harry and himself, Severus pushed back the lid. His fingers started trembling when he took the first magazine out of the box. 'Potion Practisers - A Magazine for Master and Apprentice', May 2005. Directly beneath it, he found the edition of April, March, February, January, December 2004 … 2003 … 2002 … the last magazine in the seemingly bottomless box was dated January 1997. Overwhelmed, Severus looked at the young man, who smiled sheepishly while trying to keep about a hundred issues of one magazine from slipping down to the floor.
When he had finally stood before her, eyes lined with black charcoal, skin porcelain smooth and lips the inviting colour of rose-pedals, she had nodded approvingly and Draco was ashamed to admit now, that he had been relieved. Without the thought of resistance, he had put on the clothes she had lain out for him with barely a minute to spare. He had hated himself for trembling ever so slightly, as he had stood before her, presenting himself. Even more so, when she had gestured at her feet, and he had kneeled, without so much as a thought about defiance.
"Upstairs, in my trunk, as always. Why?"
With a sigh, Alexander Pince confirmed that. "No matter how little I like to admit to it, but your pet Death Eater is right, Potter." Gesturing towards the few pure-bloods in the room, he sneered, "You want to change our way of living with your 'modern ideas'. But you will never succeed if you ignore where we are coming from. But now stop blabbering about politics. That's a topic you can entertain in your free time. Robarts gave us forty-nine hours, and too many have passed already. If we don't manage to find a new lead, he'll be forced to shut us down!"
Half an hour later, they had four forgotten pears wrapped up in their pockets, contently making their way home. Teddy was diligently studying a small flyer the shop assistant had given him that detailed the growing circle of a tree.
"You are doing paperwork. You
Swallowing around a constricting throat, the young man could not help but secretly peek at Sirius and his dad, who were barely able to hide their grins at his apprehension.
To keep up appearances, Harry had remained unmoved, but still had replied quietly, "If I ever hurt him, I will offer you my wand to do it."
Rubbing his hands on his trousers, the blond continued, "I tried to ask her what she was doing … told her you do not wanting anybody up there. But she merely stepped around me and went upstairs. I tried to follow, but …"
He admired the ingredients in the shelves, Harry had acquired, sorted alphabetically rather than by use. Well, he would have to resort them anyway. Both to familiarise himself with what was available and to categorise them by plant, animal, elemental and other origins; then by volatility; just like Severus had taught him. Looking forward to this task, he turned around to inspect the desk next, leaving the brewing station for last. The place where you could actually make the potions was the best part of every lab, in Draco's opinion. He knew that a place to store and prepare the ingredients was as important at least, as was a spot where you could make notes. But the fireplace and the cauldrons … this was where the magic happened, and the blond knew that he would not be able to turn away from it, once he allowed himself to get close.
jumper," Bill explained.
"Ready, mate?"
“Fine,” the young Auror gave in, stopping a young witch, who was carrying a bunch of files. “Violet, could you please be a dear and pop up to Hermione Granger and tell her I need her in my office immediately? I’ll bring these to Hillston for you.”
Slipping into the open-floorplan house, he came by in the middle of an argument between Molly and Hermione about the Weasleys-parents sleeping arrangements.
Once the two wizards were gone, Pansy scrutinised Hermione and Ron. "He gave him that scar, didn't he?"
As soon as the last syllable had left his mouth, magic started to congeal in the room, making it hard to breathe. The power they had conjured, combined with the countless useless attempts of Harry and Narcissa before them, sunk into the fabric. It felt like their spell was fighting with the intricate magic of the carpet and, on instinct, Narcissa reached behind herself when it peaked. Offering the spool with the golden thread she had used so liberally before; the power seemed to reach out for it, making it dance within her grip. After a few moments, the thread began to unravel and wave into the green carpet, forming leaf that simply read 'Sirius'.
Straightening the book in his lap, the blond did not reply beyond an abstracted, "Sorry."
--O-O--
"Yes, Sir-Master-Harry!"
Though Harry's words were meant to soothe her, the Lady Malfoy, née Black, could see the pain of her cousin's absence from the family-tree caused the young man. Her sister had taken this boy's last family member from him. The least she could do was help him honour Sirius' memory. Still, she was fresh out of ideas, so she gave the tapestry one last glare and agreed, "Maybe".
When Teddy's chin began to wobble, and tears sprung to his eyes, Narcissa had to fight down the urge to hug and comfort him, since she did not know if such a gesture would be appreciated. Helplessly, she looked at her sister. "What's wrong?"
"People participating?" Hermione mused. At Snape's confirming nod, she revealed, "Seven, including him."
At Draco’s pained noise, Harry briefly reached out and brushed his thumb over the blond’s wrist. “Yes, I could,” he agreed readily. “But what good would that do? You have extensive knowledge of our laws and a unique insight into the minds of Death Eaters. You can do a lot of good. What would I be if I denied you that chance?”
When she sank back on the loveseat, her husband brushed his fingertips over the sleeves, "This feels quite precious."
"I am grateful that my son is willing to fulfil his duties towards his family. However, I do not expect him to live a life without love. Especially not if he might have found it already." The pureblood sighed and looked out of the window. "It has been different in the past. I have been looking out to increase our families glory so much that I did not even see what was right in front of me: that I was leading us down the wrong path. At one point, I was even willing to sacrifice my son's happiness, for it. But today … I would like to believe that I have learned. Now, I am grateful that Draco is willing to do is duties and wish for him to be with whomever makes him happy otherwise."
Holding him tightly, only the slightest of tremors revealed Severus' own relief of seeing Draco healthy and whole. Gently he caressed his godson's blond hair, before handing over a bag. "Go shower and change. There is a lot we have to talk about, and not much time. Oh and put this on and don't take it off, until your mother asks it back."
--O-O--
"Draco, Lucius, please, leave."
"Strictly speaking," Pince gave food for thought, "this is not our problem any longer. The case was closed. Yet, it might be a good idea to keep an eye on things. Especially when they reach the stage of human testing. Potter, keep an ear on the ground through your Death Eaters. Longbottom, does your grandmother still take tea with the head of St. Mungo's?"
"Tell me about it," the Auror to Harry's left replied drily. "These executions are always either mostly ignored or made into a spectacle, blown completely out of proportion."
"What if I mess this up?" He asked concerned. "I don't know the first thing about childcare, even less about house-elves."
"Mum, what are you doing here? Is everything alright? Is father okay?" Anxiety written all over his face, Draco looked at his mother who had just entered the library. He stood in front of a massive tome, that sat on a separate table at the side of the room.
"And I told you, it's no trouble at all," Hermione insisted. "We traded the bedding and the pillows for yours, so you will be comfortable.
"Much appre …," Severus started, but stopped himself just in time. "dank you."
"Yes, mommy," Rose confirmed seriously.
"She's a convict!"
"You are not taking me seriously!"
Icily, the Minister of Magic shot Ron down, "This is an investigation of the Auror Department, as it concerns two convicts and one Ministry employee. And you, Mr Weasley, have a choice: either you sit down and shut your mouth, so my people can do their job, or you can be escorted from the premises, because you are obstructing a Ministry investigation. What will it be? Do you plan on being an asset or a hindrance?" When Ron sank down on Harry's chair, folding his arms stubbornly, the older wizard nodded. "Very well, Auror Longbottom, the timeline, please." Once they had established their frame of reference, Kingsley nodded. "Alright, whom do you want?"
"Polyjuice is an O.W.L. potion!"
Looking after her in-laws, the young witch turned in her husband's arms and kissed him lovingly. "Thank you."
--O-O--
"I would, …" he started, but drooped after a moment. "I don't know," he admitted. "I could have asked the snakes on the mantle as soon as we arrived, they have a pretty good idea where everybody is, but … it didn't occur to me.
Once the children had started their quest for proper animal food, Harry allowed Lucius to help him to his feet and then remove his cloak, when they entered the burrow. In a way, it felt wrong to have the older pure-blood act like his servant. However, since Lucius did not seem to think anything of it, Harry but nodded gratefully, at the support. In the end, he had his arms full of frightened fox anyway.
"But that's exactly the point," Draco now spoke up. "Being a 'pureblood' isn't feasible any longer. With two wars, the need for inbreeding would be too high, and despite producing powerful offspring, such gifts often come at a price."
"None," Pince snapped. "Honestly, Potter, we have been over this. Do pay attention. This case is important!"
Gazing at his friend and partner in the Auror department, the wizard he trusted with his life in any situation, Neville reached out and turned the map upside down, or upside up more accurately.
"But not less powerful for it." The witch agreed. "Harry sent me this book on earth-bound magic from Australia … no, New Zealand. The natives there have a much more 'down to earth' approach for their magic. It was quite a fascinating read."
Unable to contradict that particular argument, Harry thought it safest to change the topic. "Drink?"
"What about Malfoy Manor?" Harry suggested after a while.
"I'll take these, dear. I think you should sit down."
And all of a sudden, a door was there. It had always been there, Draco realised. He had seen it, from the corner of his eyes, because the dark, highly polished wood seemed so very familiar. But until now, a Fidelius Charm, entrusted to a house elf, had kept it concealed. Then the reality of what Kreacher had just said slammed into him. "A lab … a potions lab?" Draco asked hopefully, turning towards Harry.
I have to admit that my last few weeks were a little hectic, but I promise you that I am putting as much love into this story as ever, just not as much time. But I will do my very best to keep up my posting schedule of two weeks, to reward you for your patience.
It always came back to drinking games. And though the famous Gryffindor courage had abandoned them on occasion, especially when faced with Slytherin cunning, nobody was prepared when Ron challenged, "Favourite scar," after draining his third beer, in addition to the two shots he had already had.
"My pleasure, I'm Gina."
"The cornerstone being the foundation of every building," Harry recited from memory. "In times of old, the year the building was constructed, was carved into it. And for wizards' buildings, the first wards are anchored there?"
His duty was to serve Potter. The other wizard had held up his end of the bargain; had saved his father from the Dementors and so much more. Despite their former rivalry, and fighting on different sides of the war, the 'saviour of the wizarding world' had made an effort to save Draco's family as well. No matter that he had owed them nothing after what the Malfoys had done to him and his friends. Draco had willingly accepted the mark of a madman, to protect his parents, serving Potter was nothing compared to that. He could set aside his own desires in favour of his new master.
Adjusting Teddy and Rose, leaning against her husband, Narcissa shook her head. "Not at all."
"He broke the wand?" The pureblood choked, before clearing his throat embarrassed.
"What?" The man rasped flabbergast, prompting the young wizard to prepare a cup of tea with honey, as per Emilia's instructions. After his cautious first sip, he was not ready to be drugged by the sneaky, little elf again, Snape tilted his head in a reluctant grateful gesture, before he prompted the other wizard to explain.
Looking at the file in his hands, Lucius slowly shook his head, obviously having a hard time to catch up. "This is not …"
What a strange new world Severus had woken up to. But inexplicably … comfortingly, one thing had stayed the same: He still felt honour bound to protect Harry Potter from the hair braided schemes the boy had gotten himself into once again. However, now, it was not out of a reluctant sense of duty for his former best friend. No, it was because the young wizard had proven himself an honourable man and Severus felt endebted to him. And, as a Slytherin, he always paid his debts.
"And you pinpointed the location of the item in Westwood Gardens."
Chuckling, the raven−haired shared, "She worships the ground he walks on. Honestly, he could pick up a pebble, wind a string around it and she would wear it proudly. To Victoire, Teddy's metamorphous abilities make him the most impressive wizard she knows, and she won't let him slip through her fingers. As soon as she learned how to write, she set up a bethronal agreement."
"Then how can you take on the responsi…bility of me being seen, if I chose to spend the afternoon in the garden?"
Suffocated by the horrible consequences this man could heap upon his family with but a word, Lucius could not keep the fear out of his voice, when he breathed, “Please, my Lord, I did not mean any harm.”
"The librarian on duty, when checking out a book officially, can … I don't know, supress that trace until the book is returned." Harry concluded his initial idea.
to offer praise and worship to the spirit of magic."
With a tiny smile, Narcissa toasted the two conspirators. "Not the slipping, merely the change of colour."
As it turned out, Neville could not integrate the portrait into the wards. The magic was too foreign for him to manipulate, but he was able to guide Harry through the process. They relocated to the salon, after putting up Walburga's painting again. Now the two young wizards stood before the portrait of the Potters.
"It's a booster of the elements our world is made of," he recognised, "but what spell do you want to fuel with it?"
−−O−O−−
Something in the elf's attitude had seemed strange, mostly that he had avoided eye-contact. Hence, the Potion Master demanded to know, "Has my godson eaten today?"
curse-breaker but
"The first brother got killed after taking his revenge and boasting about it. The second killed himself because while he could see his lost love, he could not be with her since she was dead, and he wasn't. But the third brother attained a great age and only removed the cloak when he was ready to greet Death as an old friend."
Of course, Draco had recognised her immediately, since not only had Harry told him about Dolohov's execution and the witch whose acquaintances had attacked him, the Daily Prophet had also published quite an elaborate article where Lydia Blackwood had featured on the front page. She had looked at him like he was a little puppy, not yet housebroken, but adorable still. Ignoring the havoc he had caused, she had ordered him to clean himself up, dress in what was provided and expect her in an hour.
(See the end of the chapter for
Regression to the mean. At least for one pairing.
Now, he was faced with formulas that proved that his idea could actually work. It was a two-component solution, making it a lot harder to discover then a 'simple' poison. The question was, did he actually want this? No matter if someone else would have to administer it. The effect would be Draco's responsibility.
First of all, sorry about posting so late. I had the weekend off and spent it with some friends.
"Ahm, … maybe the salon?"
"Harry. Mum asked me to remind you about Sunday. The local newspaper has her convinced that you've all survived some kind of apocalyptic death trap and now, she wants to convince herself that everyone is fine. And you know how she usually does that."
him cast?"
At the Ministry, Leewood dragged him into one of the observation rooms. "Longbottom decided that giving you a go at her will be our last resort. For now, he and Pince started the interrogation."
Three days later, Draco and Harry sat in the kitchen at dawn, staring into two cups of tea. Draco had tossed and turned all night, and the young Auror had just come back from a raid. His arm had bled sluggishly as he had stumbled through the floo. However, a quick 'Episkey' had taken care of that.
Disoriented and aching all over, Hermione stumbled as she was roughly shoved into a dark room. Fortunately, strong arms caught her and gently lowered her to the floor, as if the person knew about her head spinning and her stomach heaving. She could hear an unfamiliar voice, leer, "Don't worry, witch. You'll get out safe and sound after the next eclipse. You're just here because you couldn't keep your nose out of other people's business. But I'm sure, your Death Eater whore will make your stay here as comfortable as possible." Then the door slammed shut and was locked audibly.
Unsure of how his vassal was fairing these days, the young Auror tried to pick up queues from his best friend. But either Lucius had not discussed their fallout with her, or she had already explained Harry's point, and the pureblood was finally on his way to getting where Harry was coming from since both Hermione and Lucius were acting pointedly normal. The former Lord seemed considerably more relaxed in the cafeteria of the Ministry than in the kitchen of Grimmauld Place.
petty.
Of course, Narcissa had followed her husband, as soon as the screams had woken them. However, since entering the room, she had but watched and listened. So, she had noticed Draco’s bedding, only thrown back partially, because Harry weighted down the other half. She saw both young men wearing their pyjamas, despite their host’s being half torn to pieces, him scratching his naked chest subconsciously. But most prominently, she observed the thinly veiled terror in Harry’s eyes, when his gaze dashed from Lucius, to Draco and back to himself, before he began the circle anew, as if unsure what was about to happen.
"Apple−tree," Harry corrected absent−minded, pointing out one of Lostrife's statements to Lucius.
"Leave the door open," she had commanded. So, in full view of that sadistic bitch, Draco had torn off his bloodied clothes and stepped into the shower. However, on an impulse he had pulled the platinum cufflinks Harry had lent him off his shirt, and hid them in a small niche between counter and wall. As soon as the water started, his clothes had vanished. He knew that he had no chance to stop the bleeding. Fortunately, as Draco discovered, all whip-marks had been rather shallow. One Episkey and they would be healed. Sadly, his wand had not made it into the room with him. All he could do was hit the cold, letting the icy spray slow the bleeding. He had doubted that she would accept blood on his clothes as 'proper attire'.
After starring at the blackboard for another minute, scratching his greying fox that had wound it's way around his neck, the young pureblood shook his head. Brewing it would do no harm. The rest … he could think about later.
At times, his liege and his son acted more like a couple than several purebloods pairs he knew, who actually were in a relationship. Even without - at least Lucius fervently hoped so - intercourse added into the mix. It was the strangest bond he had ever witnessed. And now, somehow, Severus Snape was around as well. Lucius had no chance of predicting where this was going, and it unsettled him.
"I know." Looking up, Draco offered a small smile, barely holding back his tears of finally being given back the man who had acted more like a father to him than Lucius at times. Neither of them had ever been the type to display signs of physical affection after Draco's eighth birthday. That simply was not done in their circles. Yet, when Severus opened his hand, inching it a tiny bit closer, the young wizard instantly laced their fingers, claiming a place at the foot of the bed. For a few minutes, they just sat there, basking in the proximity of a cherished person, one who had finally been ready to take their fate into their own hands.
Watching the door fall shut, McGonagall smiled to herself, topped off her tea and returned to her grading. If anybody could get Hogwarts to open the sealed chambers, even temporarily, it would be Harry Potter.
"We're locked in here. What do you intend to do?"
"I do indeed, and don't worry, Harry. Ron will get his due. Regarding money and appreciation of his services." Then George rose from the breakfast-table. "I'll see myself out. And you should check on your pet-dragon. He barely at a thing."
Once the pair was gone, Harry turned towards Narcissa, unrolling the diagnostic, "Explain this to me, please."
Harry also tried to take the Malfoys’ and Andromeda's advice to heart and make himself available for the members of the pure-blood society. The first invitation he accepted came at Andromeda's recommendation. The Bones family had prepared a nice garden-party and had invited Harry along, since he had been in school with Susan. A lot of the 'light' pureblood elite was present, and Andromeda knew the majority of them, since they had children in Teddy's age. Since there were not many tutors available that were up to the standards of 'pureblood society', the elderly witch had conferred with many of her peers to find the beast teachers for her grandchild.
Thinking about the question, Harry suggested, "Research?"
Looking down, Harry paled, and his fingers started trembling. "No … NO! … I left this in the woods for a reason! I can't … no one should have this. It's too dangerous!"
Situations like these had occurred in the past. Draco's dreams becoming so vivid, spilling over into this semi-awakened state. Sometimes, the raven-haired had learned; it was better to ride out the waves of the bad memories. Sometimes, it was better to wake him. But what was the best course of action tonight? The decision was taken out of his hands, when Draco opened his eyes again, noticing a smudge on his eyeliner and forcefully, started rubbing off the offending colour. Softly, Harry reached for the other's hand, promising quietly, "We'll make sure everything is perfect. Let me help. Come on."
And that pisses me off!"
Having stepped up to his wife, who had so easily defended their way of living, Lucius interrupted quietly, "To a Lord of one of the sacred twenty-eight families, ignorance is never an option."
“You are the only one I’m able to trust around here. All the others are either overzealous or to deferent to be any good. You at least call me out on my shit.”
Thinking about it, Harry still stood by his decision. "I imagine they would have shone like mum's eyes. So, I would like for you to wear them, Draco. If you are amicable."
Frowning, Hermione explained, "Of course Mr Pince has a personal interest to find his aunt. What I am concerned about is, that this might conflict with his professional interest as an Auror to find all of the missing persons."
He was an Auror, used to efficiently going through the dirty laundry of anybody, in search for clues. But Snape was not a case. He was Harry's … guardian, the saviour of the wizarding world realised. The closest thing he had ever had to a father figure. Severus Snape had watched him grow up and had made an effort to keep Harry protected, no matter how strenuous the endeavour, or how thankless the task. Snape had done everything to keep Harry alive, even fought with his mentor when he understood that his charge was about to be slaughtered like a pig.
"Lily Evans," Harry had whispered. "They look like silver, far less precious than any others, but he seemed to have worn these more often than not." He had slipped both into the pockets of his trousers, before going on.
"Yes," Draco admitted, "Emilia said that you are really pushing yourself and that she is worried that you will do yourself more harm than good. So, I looked into a few of Regulus old books and tweaked the formulas a little. Taking it, won't impair your ability to talk. It will just relax your throat."
With a tired sigh, Harry turned to look at her. "If not him, who else? Who could I trust with this secret? Who would put as much effort into helping Severus Snape as his own godson? Not because I tell him to, but because he wants to!" Once Sirius' name had been returned to his rightful place, Harry had acquired a new painting to offer Walburga access to this room. It might have been a little vindictive, but Harry felt that he had the right, after all the time and effort he and Narcissa had put into the family tree. Hermione had found him this one, called 'Dogs Playing Poker' sharing that it was somewhat famous … or more infamous, in the muggle world. Seeing it, Harry had instantly known that his godfather would have loved it, as one of the shaggy black dogs looked suspiciously like Sirius' animagus form, though with shorter fur.
Fidgeting with the sleeves of his robe, Harry avoided his partner's gaze.
"I always hoped you would win," Lucius breathed quietly.
As it turned out, the family-tree looked exactly the same, with the Lady Malfoy brooding in the armchair. The sewing kit sat open on the small table beside her, obviously having been used. Confused Harry wanted to know, “Are the tools not sufficient? Do you need anything else?”
"With a marriage proposal and quite possibly the only way of continuing my family name."
Literally understanding only half of what Harry was saying, the Lady merely tilted her head, to not betray her obliviousness. "That is very much appreciated."
"There is … at the Ministry, we have a psychiatrist, who specialises in extreme cases. There is a muggle word for that, it's called PTSD. He works mainly with Aurors, but as far as I know, he has office hours every other week."
"But compulsion spells on that level are horribly hard to predict," she sighed. "When you allowed your vassal to work for me …"
Having just left the library, Narcissa came face to … well, she actually had to look down at the house elf that had served the Black−family for nearly a century. She could not help her smile since he, despite being considerably older than the last time she had seen him, still wore the same grumpy expression she remembered, "Kreacher."
"This is the only Christmas your family has ever had," Hermione had shared quietly.
"So, if I am in a tiff, Lucius suffers for it."
Taken aback, Snape clarified, "You want me … to teach Harry … about love?"
"Then look at it this way: some of the most potent healing-draughts can be found in there. In my profession, I can only benefit from someone with such in-depth knowledge at hand."
Looking up with all the scepticism a 4-year-old was able to muster, Rose demanded, "Prove it!"
“You won’t have to,” Harry vowed, hugging his friend.
Both Ron and Hermione assured him that all business transactions were in order. Harry had never had that good of a hand with money. Mostly he just tried to spend as little as possible. On himself, at least, when buying gifts for his friends, he had no such compunctions.
Ron's words were like sandpaper, grating on Harry's oversensitive nerve endings. When he tried to turn away, he noticed that his head was resting on something soft. Oh, … Ginny's lap, that was nice. Her hands were keeping his head tilted to the side, gently caressing his hair. At least until the raven-haired tried to move, then they turned into steel clamps. An angry voice … Hermione … hissed under her breath, "Hold still, you fool, so I can stop the bleeding!"
Sighing, Harry shook his head. "So, I should cut their price in half and start negotiating from there?"
In Korea, Japan and finally China he learned about the inherited magic that lived in the very stones of the buildings that had been erected hundreds of years ago. About ancient creatures so tiny you could not even see them, but that thrived on the emotions of the inhabitants of their homes. Luna would have loved them, and Harry had purchased several paintings and books to send to his friend.
−−O−O−−
Forty-nine of the most potent witches and wizards of their village cast for several hours, then Harry was pulled through – what seemed to be the centre of the Earth – and landed on wet grass, surrounded by stone monoliths. The British wizard fell to his knees, ready to weep. He had not known, had not understood how much he had longed for the magic of his home, until Harry felt it surrounding him again, caressing his skin, his very soul now that he was back. Looking around, he wanted to chuckle, because of course, where else could he land but in the centre of Stonehenge, the stone monoliths surrounding him like sentinels of a time long forgotten. He sent back a small, wet stone, as they had agreed upon, something infused with the magic of his home before the connection closed all the way. Something easily transportable because it had no life.
--O-O--
Turning in his seat, the blond spotted the young witch between the rose-bushes. It was beyond him, how someone, so detached from reality, could be so successful in her line of work. "I don't think …" Draco started, trying to come up with an argument of why Harry should stay when Luna entered the kitchen. There would be hell to pay if the Auror had a relapse just because he was too stubborn to stay put!
At Harry's confused look, the pureblood explained, "The equivalent of Diagon Alley in Calais. For those witches and wizards who can't afford to shop in Paris, it's the next best thing."
Snape's glare was back full force. Regrettably, Emilia was not a student, dependant on his good will to pass her classes. Hence, she did not even flinch when he hissed, "You would not."
happened, but not
Draco, who had merely poked at is sandwich, reared back, as to not get juice all over his robes. "Potter, what the hell?"
"Obliviate!"
"Less alone?" Severus suggested. He knew the feeling but had never had someone to indulge him.
"Harry!" The blond finally snapped, reaching for the wildly gesturing hands of his companion, holding them fast. When he was able to meet the raven-haired's eyes, he emphasised with forced calm, "You are scaring Inari."
Aware that he would only be in the way, Harry confirmed, "So, you should be ready around four."
The two Ministry workers exclaimed at the same time, but the librarian had already started a discussion with Mdm Pince and was ignoring them pointedly. Looking at his fellow colleagues, who smiled before minding their own business, the raven-haired sagged and mumbled, "Alright, Greengrass, let's get you up to speed. It all started with the ritual we did at the British Library."
"Yes, Uncle Sev," Draco replied breathless, opening the second book he had brought with trembling fingers, reading in a somewhat wet voice, to tide over his emotions. "There was a law in the city of Athens which gave to its citizens the power of compelling their daughters to marry whomsoever they pleased; …"
He could hear the quiet chuckle, before the other acquiesced, "Yes, Draco."
"This building only has two floors beneath this one," Harry recalled the building plans.
"Sectumsempra," Ron admitted. "Our boy was obsessed with yours in sixth year and was stupid enough to use a spell he had read in a book, without knowing what it would do."
"I … ahm …" looking at his father for help, Draco shrugged. "Yes, I guess I do."
Supporting himself with the pillow, the raven-haired rolled his eyes. "That's not what I meant." He defended himself, but at the same time was pleased with his words, since Hermione's eyes lit up with such unbound love for her husband.
Well ... mostly ;).
"Going after a baby …"
Astoria nodded, "Strong as in Severus Snape, Dumbledore or You-… Lord Voldemort himself."
"No, you wouldn't!"
"How do you know?"
"We'll apparate." The young Auror held out the cloak for her.
Right?
"Since nine a.m.," Kreacher grumbled, hovering the empty plates to the sink. "Master applied silencing charms at the beginning. Forgot about them recently." After another moment, the house-elf snapped, "The Animal is scratching the door!"
Cleaning away the dishes, Kreacher revealed, “Sir splays out in bed most undignified after nights like these. But Kreacher will change the covers come afternoon and freshen up Sir’s closet.”
"Was Nana very mad?" The child asked in a small voice.
'Debatable,' Harry thought, while Astoria continued, "I take a herbal remedy, containing Belladonna and various other soothers. They … ahm … help me when I'm clumsy."
"As your governess."
"It's the cut," Draco stated, rising after Harry to follow his godfather. "I tried it once, but I looked like a girl."
Pondering the question, Severus shook his head. "Soon. Not yet." The truth was, though he honestly enjoyed the life he had here at Grimmauld Place, the occasional peace and quiet with only Draco and Harry - and of course that dreadfully determined witch who praised him for every little progress - for company, he missed seeing other people. Missed being part of their world. He had picked up reading the Daily Prophet two weeks ago, and though he was unsure how and where he would fit in in this new millennium, a part of him was eager to find out.
Extremely torn, Severus shook his head in the end. "I'd prefer if you didn't."
Crouching down, Harry sighed.
"Whatever," Harry yawned. Still, his wand was at the ready, before he even reached for the doorknob.
"Alright," she yawned, curling up in his lap to preserve some warmth. "Thirty minutes, then it's your turn to rest."
“See, love, nothing to worry about.”
Alright, so, it turns out, I'm afraid of heights. Well, not hights exactly, more walking over moving platforms at great hight. Today my family convinced me to join them on the rope climbing parkour in the forest on top of Kahlenberg (Lower Austria). I've never done that before since I was heavily overweight until two years ago (280 pounds). Now being only 154 pounds (after a stomach operation in 2017) I thought, why not. "I AM FUCKING TERRIFIED THAT HIGH UP! THAT'S WHY!!!"
--O-O--
Neville offered his finger, where a cactus he had tried to replant at Longbottom Manor had turned out to be a hedgehog. The little guy had not thought it funny to be pulled from his nest.
Allowing himself a glimpse into Severus' bedroom, Harry felt the anxiety he had carried all day fall from his shoulders. His former potions professor slept deeply and restfully. The difference between the wizard resting now, compared to two days ago, where the somewhat irregular breaths, intercepted by a subtle twitch of his muscles. Harry wondered if he had a nightmare again, but decided that it could not be helped, even if that was the case. Some things just needed time and the mind always healed at its own pace.
advanced potion texts for one of my essays. However, when I boasted about my outstanding mark, he snatched the paper and discovered the plagiarism."
Nobody noticed the black-haired witch who had been following them ever since Teddy had shared his story.
"So, while we might moan to receive yet
Much slower was the progress the librarians were able to make with their squibs. Chris Drake had already demanded back his time-turner twice. However, fortunately, both times Draco had been able to come up with new ideas when, yet another rune-potion combination had literally gone up in flames. Drawbacks and unsuccessful developments were the steppingstones of every scientific improvement. Nevertheless, Narcissa was worried about how long the head of the Arthurian Library would remain patient before he took desperate measures. Measures that would draw the wrong kind of attention towards her family. That could make them lose all ground they had gained with the Ministry. Also, Drake was well aware that he could not keep his research team away from their 'day jobs' indefinitely. And once they were gone, progress would be going even slower. Something he seemed determined to avoid at all cost. Case in point, he was currently arguing with Irma Pince in their 'ritual room', where Hogwarts' Librarian was documenting their latest failure.
“Alright, now do me the favour of explaining –
"They are sorry." Severus had repeated incredulously. "The wards have told you that they are sorry."
(See the end of the chapter for
In the end, however, after going over the available information three times, they decided to risk it. "Kreacher!"
Another No.
"Draco sold his life to me, in exchange for my intervention. Am I a horrible person for being glad that he did that? At least I can keep him here now, instead of sending him back to that horrible place. You should have seen him when he talked about returning to the Manor. It was not even 'home' anymore. I had only seen him this distraught twice, once when I saved him from the fiend−fire and before that … well, you know what happened then. You saved his life after all. Did I ever thank you for that? I always thought that using your spell made you responsible. Now I know that I was just like my dad … like James Potter, careless, even cruel without any concern for the consequences of my actions. I understand now why you hated him so much. Still, I was but a stupid child and had you not been there, I would have become a killer. So … I'm sorry and … thank you, for saving Draco. And for looking out for me, I guess."
Frowning ever so slightly at the worried look, the witch pondered, "It's not about the ring. This is a token, similar to Lucius' cane. Where did you buy this?"
When Ron hit Harry at the back of the head at his non-challant question, the raven-haired sighed, "I get it … revenge for me. Geez … Ron, that hurt!"
With trembling fingers, Draco closed the second to last journal. He had not wanted to believe that Potter would betray their teacher’s trust, but proof to the contrary lay spread out before him. The blond had spent quite some time these last few weeks rationalising away similarities between the recipes in these books, and the potions he had been taught at Hogwarts. But now Draco was at the end of his tether. One way or the other, he and Potter had to come clean.
"What are you doing, little moon?"
Taking a steadying breath, Narcissa nodded and then prompted, "Now, let us see if we have some old armour around. I distinctively remember your grandfather being partial to dragon-leather outfits, Lucius."
was the problem. It would all be so very easy. "After all, the former Lady Rosier is not that skilled of a brewer."
I'm currently on holiday with my family, and it's brilliant! Sun all day long, a pool, too much food and wine, basically I'm in heaven. Still, I remembered to prepare a chapter for you in advance, so enjoy :).
Pulling up a chair, Harry shrugged. "You've eaten normally for the last five days. I think it is safe now. Also, I ordered but a dash of whipped cream and your milk is skimmed."
Reaching out, stopping herself shy of her child's face, his mother whispered, "I will try my very best. But now you have to give him the stone, love."
Gently pulling back, the pureblood shook her head. "The wand chooses the wizard, Harry," she reminded him. "It should not come as a surprise that some can defend themselves after their owner is gone."
"Kreacher"
Studying his host, the Minister decided to keep his opinion to himself. It was true that the Potters had been quite well off, and as one of the sacred twenty-eight, the Black's had been rumoured to have been obscenely wealthy. Harry could do so much with his money, political influence and power. Yet he seemed determined to work as a 'simple' Auror. Kingsley felt there was more behind that decision than Harry just not liking the Wizengamot, or not wanting to flounce his wealth around like the Malfoys in their best days. Eventually, he would have to look into that. The boy, … young man could do so much more than chase dark wizards. And while his campaign to raise pureblood and muggle children together was a good start, Harry Potter had the potential to change their world, if he would only step up and do it.
"You stole it?"
"All money will go to the Ministry," the goblin warned, but pulled out a standard rental agreement. "Let's see, parties involved, … object to rent, … how big would you say is this lab, Master Snape?"
"You have been tortured here as well."
Drooping, the raven-haired looked at his bushy-haired friend. Since it was after hours, she had freed her hair from the professional knot she wore during the day, now using her hair barrette as a shimmering ornament. She looked so much like her younger self - the witch who had brewed Polyjuice in a girl's bathroom - that it hurt to look at her. Why could he not go back to those simpler times, where his most significant problem had been the gossip of Hogwarts? Well, actually, it had not been the gossip but the fifty-foot basilisk in the walls. His life had never been easy. His problems had just shifted. Straightening, he nodded, "Alright, let's work our way up from the inheritance vaults and end with James and Lily Potter's family vault."
Raising one arm, pulling back his sleeve, the former Death Eater displayed his Dark Mark. "This is a chain that will always bind us to the wrong decisions we have made. It will never go away.  But we can still decide if it is the only darkness we carry into our future or one of many."
Close to tears, the house-elf admitted, "Kreacher has not managed to make a single thing Master Draco liked! He has ironed his hands as the young Master has given him permission to do so."
“That’s Ariadne,” Ron mumbled around his food. “She comes in every fortnight. Her mum died during an attack six months ago, leaving her and her baby-brother to their dad’s care. We think she buys the Goo for the baby when he can’t sleep for a few nights in a row. She told me once that her dad can sleep through her brother’s giggling but gets really sad when Theseus cries. George decided that we offer her a fifty percent discount. She pays for one ounce but receives two.”
Once Lucius had departed, a slightly bored voice stated from the doorway, "You look dead on your feet. You did not argue with Jenkins all afternoon. The guy is a jerk, but I doubt he's a match for stubborn old you. What's really going on?"
"Severus," the raven-haired replied. "As long as Professor Snape is with him, Draco will be safe!"
"Narcissa needs protection," Harry concluded.
Kneeling before the elven-child, Harry caressed her head and stated gravely, "I have a very important job for you, sweetheart. Draco's life might depend on it!"
Briefly chewing on is bottom-lip, Harry nodded in confirmation before he hurried towards the Atrium.
"Nobody expects you to like it, Harry," Neville eased his friend. "But at least he's moderately safe, right now. Let this be a comfort and let's go home. I don't see what we can do right now. Lucius and Hermione are safe, and we could all do with a full night's sleep."
Though it tore at his heart to suggest something like that, to put his godson willingly in danger, Severus nodded, "Yes. From the insight Lucius has gained during his torture, we know that tonight the probably biggest gathering of these Children of Hecate will occur. With the elves tracking Draco, you would be able to identify the location of the ritual and gather your forces there. You know that this group is a danger to every man, woman and child on the British Isles, not just the magical community. Can you really let this chance of cutting them off at the root pass?"
"Will it make any difference?"
With forced smiles on their faces, the two young wizards entered the living-room. And while Narcissa greeted them with an indulgent smile, Arthur merely called a greeting into their general direction, before they continued his and Lucius' battle on the computer screen. The platinum-blond, however, seemed a little more subdued. Respectfully he nodded in Harry's direction but clearly forced himself not to get up and greet his master properly. He knew that Harry considered the burrow his second home, not standing on formalities whenever he was here. Ron and Hermione, however, saw right through them. Allowing them to greet Draco's parents properly, they called out, "Come on, we have an idea for Inari's shack," guiding them behind the Burrow. The moment they were out of sight, Hermine pulled Draco into a comforting hug, while Ron did the same with their best friend.
"She was," the young wizard shrugged, choosing a deep green cover from the wardrobe, "And I was what she thought she wanted. The ideas we had about each other, about how our life together would be, helped us to push through. But once the war was over, … I don't know … nothing was how we imagined it to be."
Forcefully, Neville breathed out, shaking his head stubbornly. After a few heartbeats, he admitted, "You know, it actually makes sense …"
Folding his arms before his chest, Draco glared, “Because Potter has the right. I offered myself in exchange for your life, so even if he wanted to shag me over the kitchen table, he would
Severus nodded. Interests in the same sex were as common in the wizarding world as everywhere else. It just was not talked about in polite company. As long as the children did their duties to their families, namely ensuring the family name by providing offspring, if you had enough money and influence, nobody bothered with what went on behind closed doors. Well, they bothered, of course, affairs were always a hot topic, with or without gender-preferences. The blood-status, social influence, job prospects and the size of the vaults of the potential 'relation' was of much more interest than wether the potential lover was male or female. Of course it was also expected that women took … preemptive measures against bearing children out of wedlock. But, like in ever other society, even the wizarding world had developed ways to ensure that.
Unsurprisingly that sobered them all up a little, and Harry rose after a moment. "I'll go and get some ice-cream."
After a moment, Neville sighed and reached for his robes. “I’m coming with you.”
"Yes," the Minister nodded. "And one day I hope to include you to that list. I am trying to lead this country out of the Dark Ages. Though it helps to have Harry Potter and his friends' innovative ideas on my side, I am not one to heap the responsibility for our entire world on the shoulders of a boy his age. It's time that he wakes up and does what makes
"You are aware, Auror Potter, that this is, in fact, a department of the Ministry of Magic and not a day-care centre for former Death Eaters?"
Toying with his glass of pumpkin juice, the Harry nearly startled when his former teacher inquired, "Did choosing these links really take up most of your day?" The young man looked dead on his feet. Apparently the sleep he had gotten at George Weasley's had barely been enough.
"Help, Bill!" Harry wheezed as he tried to stabilise the heavy painting.
"Potter!" Massaging his temples against an upcoming headache, the blond explained somewhat strained. "The Blacks have been a dark family for centuries. In here you will find more books on dark magic than even in the Malfoy library."
Watching the horizon and the slowly dying fire, the adults vanished the couches and went into the burrow, to collect their children. Once more, they claimed the places, Arthur had invited them to before. When everybody was present, the patriarch reached out to take Lucius and Harry's hand, waiting for the circle to complete.
"Well, … yes," the young Auror admitted. "But that does not mean that I have to like it."
“Yes, Sir,” his house-elf confirmed. “all in your office.”
Once the witch had taken the cardinal point, facing her husband, Arthur continued, "William." Chuckling under his breath, the older wizard shook his head. "I have been afraid many times in my life, but the day your mother told me she was pregnant, I was terrified beyond compare. Never had I imagined myself being a father, let alone a good one. But the moment the medi-witch put you in my arms, I knew that I would do everything in my power to protect you and make sure you have a good life. You, coming into our life, marked a new dawn; the beginning of this family. Please, take your own family, and claim the cardinal point of the rising sun."
Tonelessly, Harry asked, "Is that really how you feel? Does all this mean nothing to you? All the people, Emilia, Draco, Ron, Hermione, Minerva, Poppy and me … all the work we have done … all the effort we have put into your recovery … it simply does not matter?"
"The Deathly Hallows, and that makes you …"
Not even bothering to hide his revulsion at the uncultured comment, the elf sneered. "Indeed, Sir, the chicken with potatoes. Would it please, Sir, to fetch Master Draco for dinner? I'm afraid he will sleep through it otherwise."
--O-O--
"That I can do." The current Lady Greengrass decided, strolling out after offering a brief hug to Draco.
--O-O--
When Harry woke from his involuntary nap, he found Lucius Malfoy behind his desk, with Narcissa standing by his side, sorting through the mail. "There are at least half a dozen invitations for Halloween and several more for the social gatherings leading up to it. I wonder how our young Mr Potter juggles his public responsibilities between his work and guarding us."
"Oh," she stated baffled. "Astoria is very … discreet in her arrangements. None of us had any clue. Is this a recent development?"
Realising that none of these 'light' families would snub her, as her fellow purebloods would have in the past if they had a more prestigious invitation, Narcissa acquiesced. "That seems to be the polite way to go about it." Since they ate at Grimmauld Place regularly, she would even have resources for a decent meal. Nothing as sophisticated as she had served in the past, but certainly enough for a few guests. Relieved, she offered, "Do you need a hand with dinner preparations?"
Having listened to the desperate rant helplessly, Harry took the wind out of the blond’s sails by stating dispassionately, “Yes.”
"I don't," the blond stated casually. "I know you far too well to assume that you will go on a mad power-trip."
With a shrug, the raven-haired admitted, "I don't have a clue. That's why you are here." Looking at the smartest witch of their age, Harry prompted. "But I want for our kids to attend a school, where nobody even knows the meaning of the word 'mudblood'."
--O-O--
Nodding, Harry looked around, only to panic after a moment. "The vial. Where is it?"
"I know," Neville interrupted calmly. "But now is not the time to go into that. Harry cares for both of them; is connected to both of them. But to make use of that connection, he needs to calm down!"
"Master has hollered?"
Apparently wrapped up in this fundamental question, Harry did not notice his companion's bafflement until Draco exploded. "But I thought you didn't like pets?!" All afternoon he had tried to come up with possible arrangements for the little she-fox. He had not wanted to assume anything or impose on his host in any way. Harry was incredibly accommodating, so Draco had not wanted to add any kind of burden. The arrangement Granger had proposed, had seemed like the most sensible solution so far. Not that he had been happy with the idea of Inari being alone for most of the day. But Draco had honestly not seen any other way. And now, Potter made it sound as if it was no trouble at all to bring her along.
They whirled around until Draco started sobbing, tears streaming down his cheeks. Pulling the exhausted wizard into his arms, Harry looked at Ron helplessly. His friend, however, merely smiled and shook his head. Putting a steadying hand on the blond's shoulder, Ron whispered into his ear, "You did well. You can be proud of yourself." Then he left.
Slowly, Teddy shortened his steps, then came to a halt. Worried, the two wizards traded a glance before they nudged the child to climb a wall, so they could all be eye-to-eye. The boy, however, fidgeted with the lapels of his shirt and avoided looking at them. Gently, Harry caressed his small face. "Teddy, cub, what happened?"
At Teddy's encouraging nod, he and Victoire lit the golden candle at the centre of the small altar, while the girl whispered, "Blessed be."
The faint smile that grazed his lips when thinking about Ron and George’s antics melted away, when he arrived at Number 12 Grimmauld Place. He looked up the façade as the house pushed itself into view, briefly squeezing his eyes shut when the sunlight reflected on a window on the top floor. With a sigh, he opened the door.
A vast amount of stolen goods not being life-threatening, they even made it home in time for dinner.
An hour later, Harry indicated a kiss to Astoria's hand and shook Regina's firmly. "Mrs Greengrass, Miss Charl-ton, thank you for having me. It was truly an enlightening evening."
"I'm counting on it." the brunet chuckled, ruffling the boy's dark strands.
"With all our strength and weaknesses, Hopes and fears we come to you now, Lady Magic. Fill us," he pleaded.
He wouldn't … couldn't allow that. With Lucius Malfoy prancing around Grimmauld Place, he had to get better and fast. Because, every day he was not able to keep an eye on that foolish boy, was one where his fellow Death Eater could sink his claws further into Harry. The young Auror was in danger and not even willing to acknowledge it. True, the pureblood was bound to him. Severus had to give it to Hermione Granger to find the most efficient solution to that particular problem. But being physically not able to attack his liege certainly had not rendered Lucius Malfoy harmless. Far from it!
And at that moment, Severus knew this to be true. Not because Harry owed him. Not because of all the help he had - however reluctantly - provided over the years. Not even because of the friendship he had shared with the boy's mother. No, Harry Potter would not let him fall, because it was in his power to prevent it. This was who this young wizard had become. Hence the Potion Master tilted his head and prompted, "Then let us … go," before rising from the bed.
"Magic," the witch whispered as if sharing a secret.
Once Luna and Neville were gone as well, Draco looked at Harry, who was just putting on Teddy's helmet, the boy had tried to go around, before adjusting his saddle once again. Helpfully the child explained. "I think your mum and dad are having fun."
"Yea," the young man whispered. "But when I make mistakes, people die."
"Your father."
Raising his eyebrows, Severus challenged, "Other masters would be a lot more liberate in their … affections. Considering what my godson has told me about your … performance at the Yule Ball at the Ministry, you heavily insinuated such an arrangement to the general public."
“Now get out of my office. And I want an extensive summary of that conversation.”
Sheepish his friends let go, and then Harry turned to the side and mirrored their gesture with the youngest Malfoy. For a few moments, the blond hesitated, but then he gingerly wrapped his arms around the other wizard. When they pulled apart, Draco's eyes seemed glued to the floor, faint red colouring his cheeks. Grateful that the others were giving them some space, Harry pulled the other man aside and cast a privacy spell before tilting Draco's head so that he could catch the blond's eyes. Reluctantly they were met.
(See the end of the chapter for
Scrutinising her former friend, Daphne folded her arms. "You have become very loyal, very fast, Draco. Have you already joined the 'Chosen one's' fan club?"
"We're out of dragons, you know," a goblin scoffed from behind.
Exchanging a look with his partner, Neville iterated, "Leewood, Pince, the Lady Malfoy … and Boleyn."
--O-O--
On the way to the interrogation room, George had shared his impression of the spell he had just analysed. He described it as some sort of compulsion combined with a blabbermouth spell. He and Ron had experimented with a toffee that carried something similar. It was supposed to make the 'victim' very talkative about whatever came to mind. It was supposed to be a joke of no consequence to create a distraction, but in Lucius' case, it had been combined with … something else. Something that had forced him to reveal secrets not his own; something that had hurt him when he had tried to fight it. George was at a loss. While he admired the sophisticated spell, he abhorred the consequences resistance had for the victim.
When Harry had shared his troubles during dinner, Narcissa elaborating on the details, Draco had merely rolled his eyes. The raven-haired had grumpled, irked at his concerns being dismissed so easily by his companion. He was spending hours furthering this cause, Draco ought to know that! The blond, however, had merely kicked his shin before he could make an even bigger fool of himself, stating drily, "Potter, you are an idiot," before meaningfully glancing at the ceiling in the direction of their convalescent house-guest.
was damn personal, and she would act accordingly!
Sitting down beside his friend and partner, the other Auror knew better than to suggest for them to hand over the case. This had long since become far too personal to not see it though. "What about we crack this case, throw some wizard into a deep, dark cell where the sun never shines, and then you apologise to your pet potioneer?"
The youngest Weasley beamed happily, upon entering, when she saw him sitting up. "Harry, you look better. What are we doing today?"
"Add to that the fact that they are utterly besotted with each other …"
"Tell me what kind of spell Lucius is under."
Picking up the cup that had appeared before him, Harry noticed that it was the herbal mixture Luna had created for him to starve off stress−headaches. When he looked up to thank his house-elf, Kreacher was already gone. Neville may be right, his and Kreacher's relationship was strange, but he was taken care of. What more could he want?
"How do you know?"
Regina nodded in agreement.
Slowly, the raven-haired had relaxed and started inspecting the contents of the vault. His parents' wands were there - as promised - retrieved by Remus and stored in a beautiful display case, along with several others. The young wizard touched them, but beyond the realisation that he and his parents had too different personalities for their wands to work for him effortlessly, nothing had happened. Poor Neville. Harry did not even want to think about being forced to use one of these wands; not experiencing the warm safety he had felt whenever he reached for his phoenix-feather wand.
"Mother?" Draco mumbled sleepily before shooting up from the couch wide awake. "Mother! Are you alright? What happened? Did someone hurt you?"
They had supervised so carefully every information shared with their patient as to not distress him, that they had forgotten that Severus had not been brought up to speed on Lucius Malfoy and his current position.
After an endless minute, where the former Lord barely dared to breathe, his wife agreed reluctantly. “Yes, my Lord.” Clearly, Narcissa knew that something was going on, but decided to follow Potter’s order not to get involved.
"I … what?" The raven-haired stammered, scrambling after his taller friend, fighting with the massive quill as to not drag it over the floor. "Ron, what do you mean by 'oblivious'? What am I missing?"
"He did not?"
"For eleven years, nobody cared and at Hogwarts your friends were … fickle at times. I get it. I really do. But, Harry, you have us now and we have your back unconditionally. Of course, I get angry if you keep secrets or lie to me. But that does not mean that I will abandon you when you need me!"
Coincidentally, father and son shared the same plight, though Draco's day could not have been more different from Lucius'. Sleeping with Potter had definitely helped for a part of the night, but around five a.m., Draco had shot up from the bed, panting, memories of the Dark Lord drowning him. Not wanting to disturb his companion, he had slipped out of the of the room. After an extensive shower - where he had tried to wash off the stench of that snake-faced bastard - had retreated to his new laboratory.
Putting down the book he would never admit to being too heavy for him, Harry chuckled. "Yes, I think that happened after Ron and the twins rescued me from the Dursleys between first and second year. When we entered the Burrow, Molly screamed at them, while welcoming me. Which was really weird. Then she made sure that we were all unharmed and served breakfast. That was the first time in over a month that I had not felt hungry after a meal."
With a brief smile, Ginny rose and inquired, "Kreacher's still elusive, so I'll make breakfast. Anything you want?"
With a grateful nod, he dismissed his colleagues, before turning towards Lucius. "Hermione tries to convince Lady Greengrass of the advantages of a shared day-care. Please, assist her in that endeavour."
Ignoring the incredulous looks of his fellow Aurors at the dead man walking, the brunet nodded. "Alright, let's relocate to Grimmauld Place. We'll fill you in there. Harry, look around Hermione's office. Take Ron with you. As you've pointed out before, the two of you know her best."
Harry sighed audibly.
Finishing with the bed, the raven-haired replied quickly, "I have a house that finally accepts me, thanks to Narcissa's tireless work. Ron and Hermione are expecting again. You woke, and the Malfoys are doing better. Things are finally looking up."
It was … black, no surprise there. There were green fabrics, and silver edges decorating the furniture. One would expect such dark colours to make rooms gloomy and depressing, but nothing could be further from the truth. The black leather of the couch looked buttery soft and incredibly inviting. The black fixtures were - despite their lack of use - polished to a shine. Deep green armchairs offered a place to read in front of an open fire; and silver-grey curtains draped the glass-windows that seemed to look right into the lake, as well as a lovely picture of a summer meadow, with a gurgling stream running along the lower edge.
"No," the pure-blood contradicted softly, placing a comforting hand on Harry's bouncing knee. "You did not leave me alone to deal with my nightmares, at the beginning. I won't leave you alone with this. It's just for one night. I am sure I can suffer through it." He sighed dramatically, sounding so familiar from the blond prat they had known at school that it made them smile involuntarily.
a good elf," Draco corrected reflexively.
Bitterly, the blond interrupted, "That hardly makes up for everything else."
(See the end of the chapter for
Then, as always after bouts of affection, they turned away, avoiding each other's eyes, returning to their chosen tasks.
“Exactly,” the woman nodded, stepping up to the fabric to caress the charred edges of the hole. “But it is possible – not likely, mind you, but possible – that I could.”
As if sensing his inner turmoil, his host assured him one more time, "It's okay, Draco. Stop overthinking it. Just close your eyes and go to sleep, you look like you need it." Harry wanted to do more, needed to ease the other wizard's anxiety, but since the blond had made it clear that he was not to be snuggled, this was the best he could offer.
"What could be that important?" Neville wanted to know.
"How?" The Potion Master demanded to know.
Antivenom {suitable for magical beasts (Nagini?)}
"I've heard he is quite wrapped up between work and his new boy-toy."
"Very well, you have half an hour, and if you meet my expectations, I might consider healing you. You want that, don't you? For me to make the pain go away …"
Four, nearly five weeks had gone by since the ritual. Weeks, where Harry and Draco had made every effort of not talking about what had happened. Weeks, where the boys had finally given in, accepting that there would be no recuperating rest for either of them, as long as they slept in different rooms. Weeks where they worked at the Ministry or on a potion, followed by nights where they inevitably ended up wrapped around each other come morning. Weeks, where nothing had been discussed as not to endanger the status quo where Harry and Draco slowly, finally started to feel happy. Harry felt like the worst bastard, not only wanting, but actually taking what was not his.
"Out of duty, not out of love." Lucius shrugged. "My son is aware of his duties. Despite that, I have to admit that I am glad to know that he has found someone to give his heart to as well."
When the brunet Auror returned half an hour later, Narcissa was perching on the edge of their sofa, hands clenched so tightly that her fingers were white. That, however, was the only indication of her distress. Her face was an impassive mask of ice.
"It was not your fault," Harry had tried to ease her, reaching out again, but stopped just shy of touching the canvas. "It was Voldemort, he …"
"Oh, my love," Lily had sobbed, pressing her hands over her mouth. "I … I'm so sorry."
"Teddy, cub …," Harry started achingly soft, as he brushed a strand of mousy hair out of his godson's face.
Harry could not help but chuckle when overhearing that conversation. Could practically see the blond's eye-roll and the platinum's carefree smile. "You are not going away, are you?"
Hermione could not suppress a shiver. Wrapping her arms around herself, she wanted to know, "Can you actually do that? Summon a higher power?"
When Severus pondered the question, Harry answered with a small smile, "The Half-Blood Prince's Apothecary."
"You are getting better!" Emilia reminded him softly. "You have made such amazing progress in just one week, that I seriously consider letting you stand before the weekend. But your body can only take so much. You have to give yourself time to recuperate your energy. Otherwise all this hard work will be for nothing."
Opening his arms for his overly excited godson, the young man laughed. "That's great, Teddy. Look, there is Neville. Say hello."
--O-O--
"Yea, sure," he mumbled. The dim light that fell through the windows told him that he might be late already. Probably. But Neville would cover for him. He was a good pal. "Jus' a few more minutes," Harry slurred.
Gesturing towards the food, Harry prompted, "Breakfast first, then we'll leave."
Entering the room, inspecting the plant, Severus placed a gentle hand on the boy's forehead, finding it clammy and hot. "How long did you smell these blossoms, Edward?"
give me the job, straight way, but also expected me to finish my N.E.W.T.s before allowing me in the field."
"Because it's the right thing to do."
Slipping into the room, Neville mirrored Pince's confusion. The older Auror, however, was the one who inquired, "Why would someone steal books that can be found in bookstores or are available per owl-order? Why would their kidnappers have any need for everyday tomes, at all?"
Cleaning his nose with his sleeve, Teddy nodded. However, after a moment of pondering, he injected, "But how will it work if it's not even a real spell."
Two blinks.
Harry was … exaggerating. Draco would be taken care off at Grimmauld Place and one way or the other, he would find a way to help Lady Malfoy as well. But Lucius’ son was close to breaking, and Harry would not be able to get his father out of here if the pureblood saw any other way to protect his family. Harry had watched him during the initial trial, four years ago. He had barely reacted, obviously already resigned to receive the harshest sentence, maybe even the Kiss. There had been a brief burst of prideful indignance, but now he appeared willing to go through with whatever insane plan Hermione had come up with. Good, otherwise the Wizengamot would never believe Harry a suitable liege for a former Lord if Lucius didn’t bow to him on his own.
had a hidden agenda. Gazing at Draco, his mind only now caught up to the fact that his godson should not even be here. Grimmauld Place had been safe! But now, Death Eaters had invaded it. Desperately, he tried to reach for the boy. He had to make him understand! Even with Voldemort gone, there was no way to foretell which Death Eaters would hold a grudge and who would not. Just because the Dark Lord was gone, Lily's son was not yet safe!
"What can Sero be doing for Master Potter?"
"Kinky!"
Shaking his head at his father's question, the young man admitted, "Not exactly as planned."
Chuckling, the bushy-haired witch revealed, "It has a small extension and featherlight charm and will only open for you. The real present, however, is inside."
"The last part is not from the tale. Who said that?"
Studying his former pupil, Severus nodded after a few moments. "Good, then let us return to the matter at hand. I think Mr Manson and Mr Welsh are on to something. Yet their research on plant-based core-strengthening potions is rushed and - let us be honest - incredibly sloppy. I would advise them to look into mineral bases. Maybe even animal ones. Feathers of an Occamy, combined with powdered Lapis Lazuli might help to align newly concentrated magical powers. An amethyst thrown into the cauldron at the beginning of the brewing process could increase the strength of the potion overall. Maybe even serve as a focus for the squib later on."
A little girl, with pigtails down to her pink, frilly skirt beamed up at him and at once dug into the paper bag. Giggling already, she replied, “Thank you, Mister Ron. Have a good day.” When she passed Harry, she smiled brightly, revealing a missing front tooth. “You too, Mister Mister-Ron’s-friend.”
The Potion Master wondered for a heartbeat, how he could have known that this armchair was fit to make a bed for his two former students. But inevitably, thoughts of Lucius Malfoy warred for his attention. Despite everything he had heard, not for one second did he believe his former friend shackled and leashed. Lucius was too proud, too Slytherin to take anything like that without an agenda of his own. That was simply not how the pureblood worked. So, Severus found himself once more with the duty of protecting Harry Potter from his own naivete. And this time, not only Harry, but Draco as well, since he had seen in the boy's eyes how much he wanted to believe in his father's redemption.
"No," Lucius insisted, "Why did you turn your back on us?"
"Then, how?"
With a chuckle, Harry concluded. "One blink is 'No'; two mean 'Yes'."
"With you!" Harry corrected her irritated. He had thought his best friend aware of the fact that he had not 'handed Lucius over' to yet another master throughout the day.
Draco's arrival the next morning had been a blessing. At least with his godson, he knew where he stood. The boy had outlined the stasis ritual, without going into detail. He had shared Potter's decision of bringing him here, to Grimmauld Place, paying a professional medi-witch to take care of him. The young wizard had ensured his well-being in every way imaginable. Draco had revealed details of the last battle, how many they had lost on both sides. About the Saviour-of-the-Wizarding-World becoming an Auror, displaying his 'Gryffindor heroics' - Draco's exact words - with disturbing regularity in the line of duty. He recounted the numerous dark wizards the young Auror had put into Azkaban. His godson spoke about many things, but Severus could not shake the feeling, that there was this Hippogriff in the room, the blond was determined to ignore. And since Severus' ability to speak was nearly non-existent, he could not even ask.
"Okay," Harry looked between the two women, who appeared exhausted but distinctively happier than before. "In that case … good night, I guess. Oh, if you need anything …"
There was a knock. Severus barely had the time to cast a 'Notice-Me-Not', before the door was opened, revealing a concerned Ron Weasley.
"Are you willing to testify under Veritaserum?"
"I think Mrs Belfast's assistant was close to tears as well when we entered her office at the British Museum. She always seemed so easy-going and care-free, as long as she was with the other librarians. But let me tell you, she's frighteningly efficient in her own domain. I stayed for a mere hour, but in that time, Cynthia went through everything she had missed and was already halfway through reorganising the museum's next exhibition," Neville shared between bites of his sandwich.
Once the two friends were gone, Severus held out another vial. When the young Auror tried to pocket it, the Potion Master demanded, "Drink it! Now!"
"Here is milk," the young witch pushed a gallon-canister into his hand, after entering his living-room. "And some decent tea. The last one left a lot to be desired. Where is the food?"
"Hello, Georgie, long time no see."
"So," Neville clarified. "None of you were abducted. You are all here out of your own, free will?"
--O-O--
Having learned to pick his battles, Harry nodded, "I apologise."
Having watched the entire scene from the hated dog-painting, Walburga stiffly stepped around the card-table and studied the last Lord Black. "Of course. And, so do you."
Through his work in Egypt, Bill was the one most familiar with such wide-spanning spells, hence, he took the lead. At first, they had been concerned about how to coordinate their efforts, when they were too far apart to hear each other casting. However, as soon as Bill started chanting, the magic seemed to travel along the walls and over the floors, actively connecting them. It hit Ron first, since he was closest. And when he began his part of the spell, Kingsley joining in a few seconds later. Their combined energies seemed to join the race. Harry felt it as well, but knew better than to start the binding, since half of the participants were still missing. With several wizards casting, their energies felt electric and undoubtedly strong. But the 'By Who Lived' nearly staggered, when the magic of Ginny and Hermione slammed into him. It was hot, nearly burning, lighting up his nerve endings so fast it bordered on becoming painful. Yet, at the same time, Harry go this impression of compassion and care that echoed through every syllable of their spell.
"No, Draco," his godfather interrupted. "I did not ask about your duties but what you
So, he stopped, toppling to the floor like a puppet whose strings had been cut.
"Great," the older wizard rolled his eyes. "Exactly what I wanted to hear."
Confused, Harry looked at the others. "Is he supposed to be able to do that?"
Looking inquisitive at the little house-elf, who sat beside his plate, levitating some cutlery in-between topping off their mugs, the little elven-girl shook her head. "Master-Draco-Sir had the shimmering flower drink, though, Sir-Harry-Master."
"Professor?"
Looking down, Harry mumbled something unintelligible.
--O-O--
The patriarch of the most noble and ancient house of Malfoy had decided that he was not nervous, on the morning of the hearing. As his father had taught him at a very young age, such emotions were unbecoming for a Lord, even a former one. So, he merely tilted his head respectfully when his liege joined him and Narcissa for breakfast and forced himself to enjoy the egg his wife had prepared for him. The only sign of his not−entire−calm demeanour was his hands repeatedly straightening the slightly threadbare seam of his robes. For the last few years, no member of his family had spared any concern for their wardrobe. So even the most elaborate dress−robe he owned, was about ten years out of date.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Is that really a risk you want to take?"
Aware that Harry was too stubborn for his own good, Ginny waved her wand over one of the visitor's chairs and changed it into a long, luscious couch. Despite his weak protests, their patient was deposited upon it and wrapped in the blanket she had fetched from the living-room. Despite his exhaustion, Harry tried to ease the purebloods, who looked at him with various degrees of concern.
--O-O--
While the purebloods merely tilted their heads, Harry greeted in an even tone, "Hi, Charlie."
"Five minutes give or take."
"You have an inkling," Neville deduced, "Harry, do you know where this ritual will be?"
"Did he die there?" James asked in a thick voice.
As soon as Emerald was gone, Draco scrambled for the hiding-place, getting out the cufflinks, fastening them on his sleeves.
"How you have passed your N.E.W.T.s is beyond me." The redhead sighed.
When the pureblood had started spilling details about their current case, she had been angry.
"No, I prefer beer with Chilli."
"She's a she!" Charlie confirmed with a chuckle, handing Draco a bowl of raw meat. "Put that in the corner, and she will be in there faster than you can say 'Quidditch'."
"And you noticed," he reproached his wife.
Rolling his eyes, trying to rescue the sleeves of his robes from sharp teeth, Kingsley rolled his eyes. "Believe it or not, I can see that. That still does not answer the question as to why she is trying to eat me."
And though Harry very much wanted to protest, to walk on his own, his spinning head told him that that would not be the best of ideas.
Clenching his fists, Harry rose and promised, “I’ll find a way to make this right. I swear!”
He tried to avoid the stabs against his chest, with the Death Eater’s wand, adopting an innocent expression. “I have no idea what you’re talking about, Mister Longbottom. I was just following a suspect.”
"Nobody else?"
Approaching the overgrown wall, the muggle-raised gently touched the leaves and blossoms. "This is an altar?"
Surprising no one but the platinum-blond wizard, Justin simply accepted the handshake, but Hermione brushed away the gesture and went in for a hug. "You are most welcome, Lucius. I know you will put it to good use."
"Well, at least we can be sure that your Draco is properly cared for," Pince stated after a long day.
Glancing at Hermine, Ron shrugged, "We can ask Percy or George to switch."
Calming herself, Narcissa gathered her composure before turning around while lifting her head. "Good afternoon, aunt Walburga."
−−O−O−−
"I'm kind of glad he did."
will decide when we start with human testing."
"And adding something?"
The spell that had targeted him specifically burst at the shield his colleague had cast. Within moments, the offending wizard was captured and dragged away so they could portkey him to the Ministry's holding cells. Regrettably, Aurors couldn't identify the witches and wizards who had cast the initial spells.
"I see …," the former Death Eater mumbled, before continuing his explanation. "Anyway, not every witch or wizard has enough mental discipline to master that art. Prayers are … they are a way to clear your mind and find inner peace. Even if you can't occlude. It often helps to put things into perspective."
It seemed that the youngest Weasley sibling had developed a possessive streak a mile wide. From the grin they all shared, the entire family approved.
"Give!" Neville demanded, capturing their colleague's notebook, so he could add Leewood's list of missing books to their board. It was the general consensus that Neville's precise letters were the easiest to read. Something they had to 'thank' Augusta Longbottom for, who had tortured her grandchild with endless hours of calligraphy training while young. At Hogwarts, Neville had tried to rebel, but where Harry's notes resembled chicken scratches when he was in a hurry, Neville's actually became neater. Sooner rather than later the boy had given up, seeing as it was easier to study with clear notes than with purposefully messed up ones. Hence, while he updated their spread-data, Harry gave his colleague reason for doubt with the simple question, "A book being checked out and never returned. Without a note? In Mdm Pince's domain. How likely is that?"
"Neville?"
The Malfoys looked surprised when the little boy slipped into the kitchen again.
one. Closing his eyes in defeat, he sagged into the chair. No. Please, no! Obsession during school was one thing, but infatuation now … by Merlin. This was a disaster!
arrogant to his face. In retrospect, Charles had sounded a lot like Severus Snape that day. Maybe that had been the deciding factor for Harry to finally break. From all the people in the Auror Corps, aside from Robarts, Young had been the only one who had not treated him as if he were someone special, entitled to certain privileges, simply because he was fate's favourite toy.
Now there was a chance for Inari to become the same for Draco. Harry wished for this to come true. His companion truly deserved it. However, before the little fox reached maturity, they could not know. "Do you think Draco's cage is sufficient?"
A while later, they were pulled out of a light doze when a twelve-night cake and a few mince pies - leftovers from the feast - as well as a pot of freshly brewed English Breakfast Tea, appeared on the table. Trading a smile, both young wizards called out in one voice, "Thank you, Kreacher." Despite the house-elf remaining stubbornly out of sight.
"No, but the general area."
Sighing, because what she was about to say could hardly be considered common knowledge, Emilia only started to speak when she felt her patient's inquisitive eyes. "To be completely honest, not all wizards, who have been in a long-term coma regain the use of their magic."
Harry traded a worried look with Ron, but before they could reach out to Hermione, Lucius picked up the tale. "The second part is me talking … attempting to talk about the Hecate Case. It has not officially started yet - as you are still investigating the conspirators. However, if anybody got the impression that not everything is done by the book, we could lose the case before it has even begun!"
--O-O--
The man was apparently hesitant to let his wife pull him out of the room, but knew better than to defy her when she used that tone.
For the first time, Severus realised that the famous scar really was not all that different from his Dark Mark. Only, he had taken it out of his own - however misguided at the time - free will. Harry had received his as a baby, without the slightest input on his part, suffering for it for the majority of his life. "You used to hide it as well."
Looking at the display, as if pondering how he could beat the wands into submission, the young man still nodded after a heartbeat. It was evident that he was concerned. Still, he allowed her to proceed. What she might experience here, was nothing compared to what
Chuckling, Neville gestured towards a small plant at the side, "Your Lupines introduce a high amount of nitrogen into the soil. To benefit from this effect, you need plants that thrive in nitrogen-enriched earth. Roses do. But if Charlie is concerned about your kit hurting itself, we can find an alternative. Strawberries are great, and I think your little fox will like them."
May your heart embrace, the return of the light!"
−−O−O−−
Whipping his glasses clean, James mentioned, "By the way, it seems like you have got a Malfoy in your library. Did you know?"
"Oh."
"Shhh … it's okay," she whispered, caressing the weeping man. "It's over, Harry. It's over."
When the blond stumbled after Harry’s house elf, the owner of the house nodded to himself. He knew Draco to be exceptionally skilled with magical artefacts and was aware of his love for books. His current assignment should keep him busy until the situation was resolved, one way or the other. Looking at the clock, Harry stormed up to his room, cast a cleaning charm and threw on some clothes, suitable for a hearing at the Wizengamot.
The problem was, in front of him was nothing but stone.
"Draco."
Clenching tighter for a heartbeat, Draco then let go and roughly scrubbed his face. "Sorry, it's just … the last time you did not come home, Hermione told us that you were at St. Mungo's because a house has exploded around you."
"Nana told me to put it down in the hallway. I've got everything
There was some shuffling, before the other wizard continued, in a much quieter tone. "I wish you could advise me in this. You were Lucius' friend once. God, I wish you were awake."
So, I will change this story into a series, though I can't predict when the second part will even start.
"Draco has gone missing Saturday night, and Harry and the other Aurors think that he is held on a property of one of these Children of Hecate."
It turned out that Irma Pince had been the fifth librarian that had been abducted since the beginning of December. The problem was, all victims had been kidnapped from their workplace with virtually no struggle. There was even a suspicion that Christopher Pendragon was missing from the Arthurian Library. But since the last guardian of Merlin's secrets only emerged once a year, they had no way of knowing, since the entrance to the library was usually sealed 360 days a year. Just the current head of the Ministry, with the backup of a member of the Crown, could make a request for immediate entrance. However, after discussing the situation with Mr Blayr, Kingsley and the current Prime Minister had decided that, for now, they did not want to bring the Windsors into it. Especially, since they have no proof either way.
Chuckling, Neville pondered, "Green is apple, red is strawberry, violet is plum, orange is …" he sniffed one, "… peach?"
Offering an elaborated bow, Harry replied, "Yes, your highness," before dashing out to avoid the stinging hex Draco sent after him in retaliation.
The young wizard shrugged. "Literally
"Can you squeeze my hand?"
"You wouldn't."
"Something that now includes us."
Handing over the diagnostic, Narcissa gratefully accepted the cup of tea Draco poured, sharing in a grave tone, "The young Lady Rosier has decided to return home before her husband could wake. Apparently, he is in a particularly bad mood if his wife does not join him for breakfast." Though her words only contained little judgement, her tone was heavy with it. "She has, however, agreed that Harry can keep her diagnostic-parchment."
"I'm fine. I promise." Harry assured a concerned Narcissa before the Lady allowed her husband to guide her out so they could retire for the night. This was Auror business, and the Malfoys had learned not to intrude any more than requested. Fortunately, Malfoy Manor had been reconnected to a few, chosen locations, as per the Lady's request and Head-Auror Robarts pulling a few strings within the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. Working for the Auror Crops had allowed her to negotiate the Burrow and her sister's home to be included in her 'house arrest'.
Trading a triumphant grin with the other Auror's, Harry called out, "Emerald!"
Fortunately, he did not notice the trembling of Harry's fingers when he handed the book over, recalling, "Severus Snape was your godfather …"
Stepping back from the bed, the young man drew a deep breath, when he spotted Kreacher from the corner of his eyes. "Good night, Sir."
Reluctantly, the two young men had given in. Some days you just felt a little 'off'. Why shouldn't a child be allowed the same? So, they had served the requested porridge for breakfast and then left him be.
"So you cheated," the former professor accused coldly. How could the Ministry be so reckless? Aurors needed the knowledge that came with Potion N.E.W.T.s. It was vital for their survival on the job! Of course, Severus considered potion making more of an art-form than mere science. Any idiot should have been able to follow a recipe - especially one as detailed as those in the text-books they had used at Hogwarts. But even the basic theory of it would be needed when facing trials and tribulations on the field. There were countless ways to make or break a wizard on a case. Snape considered writing a stern letter to … whoever was in charge of the Auror Department these days, ignoring the fact that he was supposed to be dead when Longbottom's voice interrupted his contemplations.
With a dejected sigh, Harry nodded carefully before admitting, "Also you would have to shield all by yourself for the duration of me casting the spell."
Reaching for his friend, noticing him shaking, Harry admitted. "You're right." There was something he might be able to do, but it was a risk. For one, because he had never done it before and for another, he could poke a hole through the rumble as easy as tear the remains of the house to pieces. The problem was even if their colleagues were looking for them, it could take hours to make it to their position. That was time he and Neville definitely did not have. "Look, I might be able to … well … I …" Harry started, shaking his head, groaning at the pain, because thinking got harder by the minute.
"Cookies!"
"What if I told you," Hermione had commented offhandedly during tea that day, "that I still don't trust you? That I am merely tolerating you because Harry asked me and that I feel the need to triple-check every information you give me since you were a death-eater and therefore not trustworthy."
Sinking back into his seat, wearied, the former Lord asked tonelessly, "Shall I await the arrival of the Aurors then?"
For a second, Harry froze until his colleague motioned for him to come along. "I … I did not know that" the young wizard admitted.
As was proper, Kreacher had positioned the Malfoy family at the end of the table, with Lucius at the small side with Narcissa and Draco framing him. Harry, as always, occupied his chair at the head of the table, leaving a good fifteen feet between the attendants of this dinner. When everybody was seated, he looked at the distant Malfoy family and suddenly could not contain his laughter at the absurdity of the situation. The stress of the last twelve hours finally found an outlet, and when the Malfoys joined him with chuckles of their own, he only laughed harder until tears streamed down his cheeks. Pulling out his wand, he gestured for them to step back before casting, "Deminuere."
"So, you're selling us out for our hero-status." Ron deadpanned. "Low blow, mate, really low."
Despite reaching out for the bracelet, Narcissa reminded him, " We could still stay at the Manor."
Popping up beside the bed, Kreacher berated quietly, "Bad Emerald. Putting a potion into Potion Master's tea."
−−O−O−−
"Arthurian Library," Daphne concluded thunderstruck, "Bloody hell, Potter, you really draw in the exotic ones." Glancing over her shoulder, she noticed the Aurors' surprised look.
Ron interjected, "And if these traditions were that important, the families of the purebloods would teach them to their kids anyway."
To say that Narcissa Malfoy was worried would be an understatement. In the beginning, she had been delighted to have her medical expertise requested. It had been a challenge to catch up to the current developments in the field of the treatment of squibs. Also, it had increased her family's reputation in a few circles, thus improving their situation overall. She had studied diligently. Had done everything she could think of to be a good host and had used her mended relationship with her sister to help start up the first day-care for little witches and wizards, be they muggleborn or not. It was a slow-going project. But with the interviews Harry had given to the Daily Prophet and The Quibbler, along with his monthly 'newsletter' in the Lovegoods' magazine, where he mentioned the childcare facility regularly, the popularity of that publication and their service had mounted steadily. By now, they had eight children under their care. Of course, four of them were Weasleys and one her own nephew Edward, but it was a work in progress.
Severus was just about to explain where Pendragon could shove his 'legacy', when Draco entered the room with a tray, approaching his mother, who sat on a desk, studying the potions both Severus and Draco had created, regarding possible side effects. When her son offered a cup of tea, she accepted gratefully.
For a while, the two wizards sat at their desks. Neville back at the paperwork, while Harry digested what he had learned. After a while, he inquired, "Can you chose any deity, from all over the world?"
Having risen to approach his vassal, Harry cupped the distressed man's cheek. "What have I told you, Lucius, time and time again?"
keep the site shielded.
At Harry's confirming nod, Griphook opened the last Potter vault. "I'll be upstairs. Trigger the wards when you're ready."
"If there is a written word on a containment, binding or enslavement spell, rite or ritual, you can bet your last gallon, that the Black Library at least contains a passing remark. Especially since you have returned all the books that were confiscated during the war. My mother's family was known for getting their way … as is my mother, now that I think about it. I wonder what that says about my parents' marriage." He added on an afterthought.
Shocked, Snape starred at the face of Potter's first friend. He had realised, even at Hogwarts, that Lily's boy had not lived the comfortable, pampered life he had imagined for him. But the Potion Master had never thought the scars of Petunia's neglect to run so deep. "Surely, you …" he started, and the boy nodded his head frantically. "Of course, we do! All of us. The entire family, and Harry is not so ignorant as to not see how much Rose loves him and how Teddy worships the ground he walks on … but the truth is, we all do have families … parents and children and though we all love him, in his heart he still does not put himself on … on the same level, I guess? Does that make sense?"
Comforting, Harry assured her, "They evacuated the Dursleys in advance. I did not keep in touch, but when I became an Auror, I looked them up. They live in Eastbourne. A city with the lowest wizarding population in England. Of course, most wizards live in their street. First their presence was a safety measure during the war, but they seem to enjoy the city. So three families remained."
Confused his servant slash pet slash boy-toy shook his head, "What for?"
Slowly rising from her chair, Narcissa shook her head as if waking from a dream. "Dromeda, would you …
"I've never seen them this … playful."
The next day was Saturday, and since Harry's colour had returned a mere day after barely interrupted sleep, the blond dared to present his choices. He was quite disheartened when the other brushed all of them aside. However, when Harry requested for him to fetch a specific tome, Draco's jaw hit the floor. ">To Harm or to Heal - A Master's Guide to Potions<. Are you mental?"
"No, by bringing them into our society as soon as they showed the first signs of magic. To give them a chance to be proud of what they were by integrating them into a world that understood them. Who they were and what they could do. Our Lord wanted to preserve our ways, our traditions. Make us strong again, by bringing us out of our degenerated ways, into a world where …"
"Show me!" Severus rose swiftly, storming out of the kitchen with swirling robes.
Once his brain had caught up with what had just happened, the raven-haired scrambled after them, stammering, "But, … but, …"
"Emilia?" The blond wondered but then turned back towards the man on the bed, studying the pale form, the barely scabbed over bites at his neck, he concluded. "The medi-witch that comes in every day."
Her son shrugged, "Hermione explained it to me once because Ron's obsessed with one of the shows."
"Emrys."
"I should have been faster," the Auror growled, gazing at the door as if contemplating to knock it down, going after Dolohov despite the Death Eater having been taken into custody already.
"… Harry. Harry?!"
That accusation, however, was the last straw for Harry. With both hands, he shoved back so strongly that Draco landed on his backside in the middle of the corridor. Towering over him like a vengeful titan, the raven-haired screamed, "I entered a ritual I knew nothing about, in the hope that it would keep him from dying! I remodelled and charmed an entire room to fit his needs. I have talked to every bloody newspaper in this damn country to secure his status and financial future! I hired a highly skilled medi-witch - and let me tell you, witches of Emilia Nightingale's calibre don't come cheap - to look after him. All the while working a full-time job and investigating every antidote known to man, in my free time. So, tell me, you snotty bastard, which one of these actions say: 'Oh, let's mess with the professor. I'm sure he deserves it.'"
"I am not a charity case!" Astoria snapped sharply. "I came here with a proposition. One that benefits us both! You are well aware that your chances of courting an eligible witch are slim to none. And I certainly have no desire to become trapped in yet another marriage, where I am nothing but a trophy wife and target of my husband's ire if he feels so inclined! The Malfoy name needs an heir, and I need a purpose beyond looking pretty."
"Coq Au Vin with glazed Pomme de Terre and a glass of Pinot Noir, 1995 if it pleases."
"Your great-great-grandfather?" Harry piped up, fishing for information.
Assisting the women, the other two librarians shrunk the majority of their notes and white-boards and followed through the floo.
Furiously the blond growled, "Don't think for one second, that your silly parselmagic tricks will keep you safe! You are in my domain now, and nothing can stand against me. Accio Excalibur!"
"I do not like you," Snape glared, but Emilia just threw her head back laughing, forcing even the corners of her patient's mouth to twitch. "Thank you. The feeling is entirely mutual."
Smiling at her twelve-hour-younger self, Mdm Pine pulled at the chain of the time-turner around her neck. "If you don't go now, Christopher will test his pretty sword against a parsel-shield. Not something we want to experience. This time, we have to take a leap of faith."
Then there was dancing, and despite his protests of being too full, and not being that good of a dancer in the first place, Ginny managed to pull Harry to his feet. It was all in great fun, with the children joining in, using the couch table and the sofa to dance upon. George had even managed to rope Draco into dancing a few minutes to midnight. Once the clock struck twelve, the music morphed into a slow dance. Trading a glance with his sister, George and Ginny met on the dancefloor, trading partners with a simple, "Switch!"
"Did you know that your mother is my godmother?" The raven-haired inquired cautiously
Reaching out, squeezing her hand comfortingly, Harry still had to try, "Is it bad?"
When the other two wizards left the room, the witch held back the Potion Master one last time, offering her hand, "Thank you, Master Snape."
With a relieved smile, the raven-haired inquired, "Do you want to tell me?"
School, for example, would become skuhl because ‘sch’ is spoken as ‘sk’ and double ‘o’ sounds like a long ‘u’.
"One hour," Harry enforced, before letting go.
Rubbing away his oncoming head−ache, Harry sighed. "To bring her down, she must do her own cooking, with substandard food that is never enough. As if locking away her husband and forcing her to live in this awful place is not punishment already. Fine, warm soup is still better than nothing."
"Sorry," Harry chuckled sheepishly. "I couldn't resist." Finishing the hissed incantation, he tapped the buckle with his wand once, watching the band snuggle up against the other wizard's skin. "There, all set. Is it comfortable?"
"Hedwig was my pet. More than that, she was my first friend. She was there for me when I had no one. Hedwig stayed with me when it would have been so much easier for her to give in to her instincts and flee. She never had an influence on my magic, but I would have rather starved than see her hungry."
"Master Draco has had breakfast."
Marcus Flint, who had merely watched from the sidelines until now, stated evenly, "They want to sacrifice a pureblood, thinking that it will give them even greater power."
"Because he fulfilled the requirement."
"Pudding!"
Of course, he was not able to lift his entire upper body off the bed. To expect that would be borderline stupid, and Severus Snape might be many things, but he certainly was no fool. Still, he managed to lift his head and shoulder-blades. Impressive for a coma patient of five years.
Draco threw his arms into the air. When he spotted his godfather, he demanded, "Tell him, Uncle Severus, tell Mr Manson that my potion will work! The combination of roots, shells and powdered crystals, brewed in a lead-cauldron are strong enough to instigate a reaction. Even in a squib!"
"After." The man finished for him when the boy seemed reluctant to continue.
I hope this story has entertained you and will continue to do so. I know these are challenging times. I feel so incredibly fortunate that in Austria our politicians initiated the shutdown (and social distancing) before our hospitals started to overflow. I shudder when I read stories about Italy and Spain and most of all New York. My heart goes out to everyone who struggles. Please now that my good thoughts are with you.
Draco felt both relieved and disturbed when his mind caught up with reality. He was about to live here, at Potter's command, twenty−four hours a day, seven days a week. The thought was daunting. On the other hand, despite his father being with them again, he would rather live at Grimmauld Place and not in a house where a mad−man had poisoned the very air. And that idea was utterly exhilarating.
Trying to take a deep breath, to expel the dust from his lungs, Harry winched from pain. Inspecting the back of his head, he hissed when it hurt like hell and his fingers came back sticky. Knowing his luck, the young Auror resigned himself to yet another laceration and possibly a concussion, judging from the way his brain throbbed. Still, they had more pressing matters to attend to. "Why?"
"True," The curse-breaker grinned, relaxing a little. "Just, … try to be more careful. I can't … we can't bear to lose another brother. Not after Fred. Please, don't make us."
−−O−O−−
"Not de book."
Chuckling at the affronted look of her husband, Hermione replied, "I will try my very best, but I would not hold out too much hope. Rose seemed to be the exception to every rule and in the end, wouldn't you be bored with a school full of well-behaved studious pupils, professor?"
"I'll keep the books for now, but the bag … maybe your bedroom?" Hermione suggested.
After sharing their findings, Neville shook his head. "Go home, everyone. Let's meet back here for lunch tomorrow … today. We've been awake for nearly 24 hours and can't afford to make mistakes due to exhaustion."
Putting away his wand, Harry indicated a bow. "Baron, sorry. I'm looking for Professor Snape's office."
Gazing at her son, Draco seemed to mirror her conviction and - to a certain degree - so did Andromeda. Teddy was the cutest, glaring at the carpet as if ready to go to battle with it. "On three," Narcissa commanded, and her sister started counting.
"Harry," Leewood stated alarmed, "You are bleeding!"
"What?" The blond looked from Harry to the front door to the bottle and back.
Looking at Harry, the blond repeated with a little more determination. "I said I am working on it."
The very air was boiling, magical energy charging it like a lightning storm. Standing in the middle of the group of cultists made it all that much harder for the Golden Trio and their friends to defend themselves. Noticing that Britain's 'Saviour' stood amongst them, the Children of Hecate concentrated a considerable amount of their forces on them. More and more often, the parsel-shields woven into his friends' artefacts flared up, and Harry realised that they would inevitably lose if nothing happened soon.
Massaging the bridge of his nose, the Auror sighed, "Alright, George Weasley, what do you have?"
"Wait!" The young wizard held her back. "I made something and wanted to know if it might be safe for Uncle Sev to take."
The former Lord shot to his feet, paling when facing his liege. Harry, however, was beyond caring for his vassal's sensibilities, so he claimed the chair facing him and stated, "Let me make one thing crystal clear: I hate the man you were, the Death Eater, the follower of a Dark Lord who cared but for blood status and arcane power."
Or not. Unable to hold back any longer, Severus shouted at the other wizard's face, "You can't just shove a random potion down a hapless squib's throat, Draca! We don't even know what side-effects it could have!"
"Correct," the inquisitor confirmed.
Helping herself to some toast and honey, Luna shook her head. "Harry and I have not spoken since St. Mungos."
"Yes, Sir."
With a soft sigh, Harry looked up at her. "I wish you had been there. I mean … the only memory of you I actually have is you screaming when Voldemort tried to kill you; from the graveyard and finally the Forbidden Forrest. You were …" the young man was searching for words, as his parents clutched each other's hands, looking at him with so much love and heartbreak that it brought tears to his eyes once again. "At the graveyard, something called Prior Incantatem happened. Images of all the people Voldemort had killed appeared. You were distracting him, somehow trapping him in a cage of spectres, so I could escape. It was only for a few seconds, but it was enough. And in the Forrest, I used the Resurrection Stone. I was so scared, but Sirius assured me that I did not have to be. That dying was easier than falling asleep. You were there … your souls, I mean and … I don't think I could have gone on without you. Seeing you there. Knowing that death was not the end. That I would somehow, someway see you again, gave me enough courage to take the Killing Curse. And after Dumbledore … I mean Death, I wanted to give life a chance. Without an insane megalomaniac behind me. Without the Dursleys …"
The problem now was that the Auror Corps had virtually nothing to go on.
--O-O--
Confused, Draco pondered, "I did not hear anything. Did you have the elf fetch you?"
"And unofficially?"
Hesitating only for a heartbeat, Severus nodded, "Alright, show me your kitchen."
"He bit off my head and chewed me out for the incredible amount of self-pity I am wallowing in. Then he made me memorise a complete list of everything our little Ronikins has done for our shop and me and drove the message home of how much of an ungrateful bastard I have been for taking him for granted. Basically, he told me the same you did, just in greater detail, with the thread of a few hexes thrown in for good measure."
After the tea, Harry helped the child to blow his nose, and finally, Teddy seemed calm enough for a sensible conversation. "Teddy, what made you think that I don't love you more than anything in this world?"
When they were about to part ways in front of the muggle entrance of the library, Neville held his partner back for a second. At Harry's inquiring look, the brunet mused, "How did they know that Narcissa was tightly involved in the investigation? Sure, you mentioned her, but the extent of her support can't be known to them. So why does … Chris Draca or Mdm Pince or both, want to invite her?"
She clutched her wand … hard. No way was she letting someone taint her magic!
Forty-eight hours later found Harry, Neville and the rest of their team at the office, staring bleary-eyed at their evidence wall. Robarts had given them a deadline today, and now they were more desperate than ever to find new clues. Even Lucius had joined them after his workday, since Narcissa had insisted on going over the latest missing books once again before departing for the night. The old ones she already knew by heart already. It had shocked Harry to learn how easy it was for the pure-blooded witch to memorise texts. How could a society demand of a brilliant witch as her to become a 'stay at home' mum?
Peeking in through the window - the eldest Weasleys had worked tirelessly, for the last hour, to set up a pavilion with sufficient warming charms to hold all guests - the dragon tamer asked baffled, "Is that a snow fox?"
You always only looked out for yourself! It's what you do, and the rest of the world be damned! You are clearly going behind Harry's back. I heard you! Don't even try to deceive me! I know you, Lucius!" Inari was bounding from the kitchen to the living-room, but Severus had no desire to think of what had roused the fox this time.
Something flew past the young Auror's head. The blond caught it out of the air and handed it over with the barest hint of a smile, "I do."
"What happens on the 21
Once again, the young wizard's spell reflected upon heaps of shining gallons, mountains of silver sickles, and troves of gleaming copper knuts.
"But you don't want to bind your fate to that of an inquisitor? Do ministry workers live too dangerous for your taste?" It was a valid concern. Marriage was all about producing enough offspring to carry on the family name. A hazardous occupation was diametral to such an intent if the bride-to-be would not retire to care for the children.
Though the blond could not decipher the meaning behind this sentence, an unspoken agreement seemed to pass between the three Gryffindors. Wordlessly they rose and changed. There seemed to be little thoughts of privacy between the three of them; a concept Draco could not share. When he emerged from the bathroom, they stood in the central area of the tent, looking around. Hermione held their night-clothes while Ron clutched the old wireless and the electrical candle. Harry was carrying their horrible burgundy chintz bag when they stepped outside.
"And lastly," Hermione spoke over both of them, "Ste… Sandorn abused the trust we placed in him as a Department. All of us leave our wand on or in our desk on occasion. We have to, because of the Department's Regulations. But though we have drawers with locks, barely anyone bothers to actually engage them. He broke our trust …
"Listening to stories is a punishment?"
Harry but rolled his eyes at the thinly conveyed insult, apparently not bothered by the rudeness his elf displayed. Not even when Kreacher asked, "Where would Mistress like to take her tea?"
"What?"
"The look that says: How can I get that imbecile to not run into danger … or worse," Ron added after a moment. "How can I make him see that he is not responsible for the entire wizarding population of the United Kingdom?"
"You believe that they will be able to call forth their goddess?"
"Excuse me?"
"Yea," Draco sneered, shaking his head. "Somehow, Potter is the exception to every rule."
"Yes?"
--O-O--
As expected, the house−elf was by his side in an instant, "Yes, Sir?"
After a deep breath, Hermione picked up the thread. “We demand Lord Malfoy to undergo the Rite of Compulsory Surrender.”
"I would never threaten Draco! What makes you say that?" Harry replied confused.
"Right now?"
Since he too had come to care for the boy, if only by proxy, Severus Snape confirmed. "You have my word."
When they sat in the living−room of Grimmauld Place for a nightcap, Lucius breached the previous topic. "So, Harry, you have been suspended because you helped me."
"Me included." Harry nodded a little but didn't comment. They had talked about their shared past at length. No use bringing the topic up again. "But, these days, you wear it like a badge, showing it off on occasion."
Getting up from the floor, Neville claimed one of the comfortable garden-chairs and took a sip of his beer. "It might not be the smartest idea," he admitted. "But Malfoy has advised our Department of Magical Law on two more cases since Lostrife and thought he last one wasn't a rousing success; he was distinctively helpful. Wasn't he, Hermione?"
"I would like a pot of peppermint tea, if possible. I feel a little bloated. Oh, and a shower would be nice."
"I will cover my Dark Mark."
"Very good, Emerald, you may go now."
"A potions lab, … sure … no problem!" Harry sighed, splaying over the chair at Snapes' bedside. He did not want to begrudge Draco time he spent with his previously presumed dead godfather. But it had been after midnight when the blond had finally gone to bed. The young Auror had taken his place after but a few minutes, exhausted but too wrapped up in his own head to find any rest. He had never realised how much he needed these little 'conversations' to calm himself before bed.
