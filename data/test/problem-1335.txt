He was interrupted by the both of them squeaking and getting up to give him tight hugs – Narcissa being much more graceful than her sister through the whole ordeal.
“Well, you just needed to be gentle with it” Harry’s head snapped up with the cold voice of Draco Malfoy, who was holding his own book with only his bare hands, and it was showing no signs of trying to snap them off. “The book is almost a creature itself. I thought it was a good first lesson”.
It was before he started school that Draco learned all Trelawney had to teach about understanding and controlling his magic, and all he had to do ever since was practice. Now most of what she teaches him are things she can’t even do, but she knows enough theory about it to understand how it should work - like, how to detect defense wards and activate or enable them, change them or manipulate them, turn them into a curse or apply them to self defense. Besides these theoretical lessons, she would also teach him some advanced spells, that were always pretty fun to learn.
The letter also stated that there was no reason for alarm, because nothing would change overnight – that line helped calm Draco down a bit -, and finished with a request for patience regarding him specifically. It was wrote that there were vital things in play that he didn’t know about yet, but would be soon revealed over Christmas Break, so he should proceed with caution. Very ominous and - now that he felt level headed once again, he could admit – a tad dramatic. But he went with it.
“No, that was me” Pansy admitted, while checking her manicured nails - this week they were silver with black and violet pansies.
“Probably nothing” she set her shoulders “Do you want me to get the Cloack from Tessa? I know she has it right now”
magic. She was performing spells better than the kids that grew up with magic. But her colleagues weren’t impressed. They got worse, actually.
“So, she asked Malfoy if he has a girlfriend or not” Harry started, he didn’t know why he brought it up, but he just really wanted to talk about it.
Narcissa gave Cygnus multiple tours of the grounds after her marriage, but he was still as enchanted by them as he’d been in his fist visit.
When they revealed their marriage intentions to their families, the reaction was surprisingly positive. They got married after Hogwarts.
The party was overall a success, only finishing once Professor Sprout recruited help from Peeves to disperse the students back to their Common Rooms. Before Blaise got into bed that night, he thought about how nice it would be if the students could be friendly like that all the time – but immediately shook his head and huffed in amusement,
They were getting close to the entrance of the Great Hall when Harry spotted his sister by the large doors, giggling in a circle with Ginny Weasley and some other second years. He followed the gaze of the gossiping girls to the opposite side of the hall, and met no one other than Draco Malfoy and his Slythering possy. Harry narrowed his eyes and came to a halt, observing the scene, Ron and Hermione stopped beside him.
to study in the same place his family did, with so many knowledgeable and powerful wizards! But he kept his cool. He was a Malfoy, after all, and Malfoys don’t squeak – it’s undignified, or at least that what his aunt was always saying.
“I just don’t get it” Harry said, after a while “Why come after me now? He has nothing to gain, nowhere to run, and Voldmort is long gone. You always said he was just a coward. How did he even broke out of Azkaban in the first place?”
It took about half an hour for Bellatrix to finish the whole basin, and in the bottom of it, rested a large gold locket, with a serpentine ‘S’ made of emeralds in it’s center.
“I was saying, dear Harry, that in life, not everything comes easily. Sometimes you will have to struggle to find, or ever realize, what is important to you”
“I didn’t think he would actually try to hex you!” she added, Ron nodding along to her words “Yes mate” he contributed “I don’t know what has gotten into him!”.
Draco marched down the corridor, enduring the annoying birds that were flying around his head until he entered the Great Hall, where he stood silently, waiting for it’s occupants to notice him in the entrance – which happened fairly quickly, swarm of loud paper birds considered.
Bellatrix tried not to flinch with every screamed order and banged door. It was easier to do that than to control her shaky hands - those had been a real problem for some time now, and the increasing anger from her Dark Lord wasn’t helping.
Vernon, Petunia and their son Dudley were the only remaining relatives on Lily’s side of the family, and after her death, James made a point of keeping in touch - and that included a yearly dinner around the winter holidays.
It was Ravenclaw’s ghost, Harry realized, a young woman with long dark hair and a old-fashioned dress. She had a kind expression on her face while looking down at the boy.
Harry was still snickering after Malfoy stomped out of the Great Hall, small white flowers leaving a delicate trail behind him. Down the Gryffindor table, Tessa’s face was bright red.
Snape had been the double agent that brought the Prophecy to the Dark Lord, the same one that caused the death of dozens of babies. Draco also remembered what was shown to him in the Pensieve, how Snape claimed to love Harry’s mother, but had no qualms about allowing her husband and son to die.
“Malfoy. What are you doing here? How did you find me?”. Draco looked a little insulted at that, and a little mad, but the last part didn’t seem directed at Harry. The blond boy looked down at the cat sitting besides Harry.
“It’s good to see you too, kiddo. Yeah I talked to her right after the game. Nice catch by the way, your Dad would be impressed”.
Once he recovered from the shock, Harry started tearing the wrapper rapidly, while looking up at his godfather and continuously repeating variations of “no you didn’t” and “it can’t be”. But lo and behold, there it was. A
Blaise Zabini was actually very good at Herbology, he would probably be ahead of her and Draco if he wasn’t being so overzealous – or if he had any assistance from his partner. But Pansy Parkinson left him in favor of rotating between the attention of the other boys of the class – she would lounge and make conversation and be a bother, with her skirt shortened inappropriately and make up that a thirteen year old shouldn’t be using. Hermione wondered if Zabini wasn’t angry about being left to do work by himself, but she caught his exchange with Malfoy, of fond exasperated looks, rolled eyes and small smiles.
dumb – and that also bothered him, but he didn’t have a lot of options to work with. “I’m a bad student” he said it again, now mustering his embarrassed face, which was very easy because he was embarrassed “No need to rub it in my face”.
“Flint. Focus. Of course it makes sense” Miles pointed again at the open DADA book in front of the other boy.
The answer was unsatisfactory, to say the least. No one knew the exact origin of the creatures, what they actually do, or how they do it. Their history is tied to Azkaban itself - rumored to be born out Dark Magic and the despair of it’s first residentes. They supposedly fed of happy memories and souls of wizards, leaving only the shells of what a person once was. It was all very depressing.
The boy was sitting with the rest of his housemates, and wasn’t doing anything noticeable, really, just babbling about with Pansy, Blaise and Daphne – but every time he moved, his
“Well, it was a pleasure talking to you, dear boy. I’ll keep a watch for the great things I’m sure you will accomplish” the old man smiled warmly, but Draco couldn’t help to see a warning in his words. The boy smiled sweetly and stood up to leave, glad that Dumbledore didn’t confront the fact of Draco being where he was in such a inappropriate time, and as he was about to thank the man for the conversation, he felt a very faint nudge on his
In the aftermath, Harry was sweaty and tired, his cheeks hurting from smiling so much. He was feeling light and happy, before he turned and saw James and Sirius smiling at one another, both flushed and sweaty. Ordinarily, it would be a normal occurrence, but the event of the night before - that Harry had pushed to the back of his mind - came back with force, and made him uncomfortable and irritated.
Draco always had a rather loud personality. It involved big displays, loud reactions, demands of attention and shameless demonstrations of love. It was entertaining, annoying and endearing all the same.
Malfoy deflected it wordlessly “I thought you were a seventh year, Miles” he sounded bored, maybe amused, but if you paid attention, he had his fist clenched around his wand, his posture stiff and nervous. He countered with
He met kids that got bullied for 'looking gay', and heard plenty of nasty conversations about it. Dudley told him, once, about how a new coworker of his dad was rumored to be dating another men, and he was fired once the rest of the office figured it out. One time, when he was younger, some older kid was teasing Harry when he was walking back from school, because he had picked up some flowers to bring to his sister – she had had a tantrum that day, ever the drama queen – and Daniel had defended him, telling the other boy that Harry was not a 'fag'.
“Now, these are very proud animals. Easily offended. Yeh walk up to them and bow, and yeh wait. Let them make the firs’ move. If I tell yeh to go back, yeh go back, ‘cause tha’ beak is no joke”.
Snape just raised his eyebrow and muttered “Typical” before turning back to the front of the room and kept on trying to fit as much werewolf knowledge as he could in one lesson. Draco’s eye twitched.
After that, they both finished their tea over lighter topics. They talked about the Quidditch try outs – Theresa didn’t want to participate, to everyone's disappointment, but she swore that she would be up for it next year – and about Sirius coming back home.
After a while, Draco arrived, changed from his Hufflepuff colors into a pastel pink fluffy cardigan, that made him get into an argument with Pansy about good fashion sense - Blaise was only able to distract them from it with spiked punch.
Later, during defense class, Draco approached him “My name’s Draco”. Harry just stared at him, his mouth slightly open.
“Yeah, the War sucked” Tessa declared, pulling Harry out of his internal turmoil. It took a while, but soon they were able to shake the gloomy atmosphere of the air and get back to their excited conversations.
Narcissa felt alone and scared. Playing gullible housewife had been enough up until that moment, but when she found out about her pregnancy, she started making plans of running away. She could find Andromeda, or even her little cousin Sirius. But she never made it that far.
By the time it was Draco’s turn, the students were cheery again, but it wasn’t for long. A large Dementor materialized for the boy, whose mouth had gone dry.
As they were leaving, Cedric’s friend raised his hand and waved widely back to Draco, that was still sitting on the grass with Genevieve in his lap.
away, to take the prophecy to his parents. He usually would never expect her to go such a long distance for just a letter, but she understood that the situation was out of the ordinary.
Draco was a very powerful wizard – he knew that. He mastered defensive and offensive spells that even trained
“Talk about what?” he said, innocently, bating his eyelashes to the other boy, who just gave Draco a flat look.
“Stop it! This is Hagrid’s first time teaching, and we need to be supportive. It’s not like the Slytherins are going to go easy on him” Harry and Ron agreed hastily, feeling guilty about not thinking about this themselves.
After that, the lesson went quite well, besides a few snickers and snide comments from the Slytherins, that were promptly met with defying Gryffindor glares. Overall, everyone was at least curious about the Hippogriffs (that was the name of the creatures), paying attention with various levels of amazement to fear of the beasts. Malfoy, Harry noticed, was squirming a little bit.
It was now Draco’s turn to frown. What did Harry have against him? Ever since the school started two days ago Draco made a point to be accessible and nice, particularly to Harry, but he was only met with coldness.
Draco conjured more butterflies and giggled delightedly to his father “look daddy, how pretty auntie Tix’s magic is” and then all the furniture started to dance.
Draco let go of her wand and outstretched his little hand - and suddenly the previously vanished butterflies were flying around again. Bellatrix straightened her back and looked incredulously to her nephew, 'that was
Whatever was happening, Harry didn’t like it. By the sound of things, Malfoy was trying to stop it, so, if that meant helping Malfoy – well, it really was a exceptional circumstance.
After getting ready for the day, he and Ron met Hermione in the Common Room, where she was already buried under books, reading frantically. “What are you even studying?” Ron exclaimed “It’s only our second day!”.
Draco was thinking if it was something worth reporting to Trelawney, when he accidentally focused on her. It caught his attention because what he felt wasn’t her regular steady flow of energy – but a anxious indistinct ripple that was fragmenting and putting itself together. It was frightening, and before he had time to reconsider, he touched Genevieve's back firmly. The cat
After the end of the War, some resemblance of normalcy returned to their lives, mostly prompted by Draco’s upbringing and the consequent sense of unity that it brought to the family. Most days, it was easy to ignore any darkness that loomed around the edges of their day-to-day life. Today, though, was no such day.
“Aand, the last one's for Harry” Sirius said, after a while of opening more gifts, and pulled a long rectangle box from under the tree, barely concealing the excitement from his face. Harry opened the box to find a unmistakable broom shaped wrap inside it.
Draco was happy with the interaction. Genevieve’s blessing was usually harder to attain, and Cedric getting it so earnestly made him trustworthy in Draco’s eyes.
Dementors weren’t really discussed, since basically all of them stay in Azkaban. But they are really dark and mysterious creatures, and there’s really just one way to defend yourself from them, and without it, nothing else is effective.
She agreed with Lucius that allowing Draco to see the memory was the easiest way for him to completely understand how that night happened, from the Prophecy, the killing curse, his Grandmother’s death, the massacre of the remaining Death Eaters... everything.
“Maybe he really should start a activity to put some meat in those bones” Lucius mused, moving to stand next to his wife.
When Narcissa Malfoy was sixteen, she performed the spell that permanently changed her hair from dark brown to silvery blond. It involved a tricky to brew potion, and her scalp remained tingly for days afterwards, but it was worth it. Lucius had proposed to her in the week prior, and he was nervous about their parent’s reaction to the whole ordeal, especially since they were both promised to different people.
The Malfoys might seem reformed and all of that, but it never hurts to be careful. Tessa knew that too. So instead of arguing and telling Harry he was paranoid, like some people would sometimes do, she just nodded, defeated. “Okay, I get it” she smiled softly at him, resigned.
He let a cold stare wash over the now silent tables, lingering on anyone that was blushing or avoiding his eyes, before lifting up his wand, and letting the enchanted birds burst into flames around him.
Blaise’s family had been neutral in the War, and his mother was a very powerful and rich woman. So much so that if The Dark Lord were to make a return, he’d have to be mad to try and damage a single strand from Blaise’s curly hair.
“My apologies Milord, I’ve been distracted, there’s been so many new developments in our front today... hard to keep up” she managed to keep her voice still, while trying desperately to keep her mind blank and protected from any
Cygnus instructed Rodolphus to get her a strong calming drought, before going inside the Manor to find a wide eyed Lucius writhing his hands anxiously “Is she better?”
Soon enough, they were all sitting around the fireplace, catching up before dinner - Harry noticed years ago how much his aunt and uncle loved to talk, mostly about boring subjects. They were bragging about a promotion Vernon got at work, then about a vacation to Majorca they were planning for the next month, about their car, how Dudley was doing at school and his new diet, they mentioned their neighborhood's new gossip, and even about Petunia’s new book-club. Honestly, Harry was about to snore right then and there. He looked over at Dudley, who was looking at the wall with no expression on his face – the poor boy was desensitized. James seemed to actually be paying attention to what they were saying - he always put extra effort to welcome them – but Harry noticed that he would occasionally send, very discreetly and wandlessly, light stinging hexes towards Sirius, who every now and then blinked for a little too long. Tessa was squirming, and gave Harry a look of pure agony, to which he was very sympathetic.
“Oh, I’m sorry” Draco feigned concern, putting a hand on Cedrics shoulder worriedly “Want to sit in front of a fire a sing some songs about it?”
“Drink of Despair” he declared, in the voice a teacher would use to lecture his students “You can’t vanish it, transfigure it, charm it, dilute it, or change it’s physical state. It’s protected from any physical or magical means of retrieving what it guards. You can’t by-pass it.”
“Ron, that’s not true. My Cheering Charm was absolutely unsatisfactory and my body-binds are almost always noneffective” Hermione screeched, her voice going very high.
When he woke up, it was about 3am. The ghost of the excessive amount of food he had forced down his throat during dinner came back to hunt him, and he felt the need to get up and walk it off. He put on his fluffy slippers and his red and gold robe - it would have been really weird if he weren't selected into Griffyndor -  and went down the stairs to the kitchen, meaning to get himself a big glass of water, maybe a mild potion, before trying to fall asleep once again. But when he got to the living room, he froze in his tracks after hearing voices from the kitchen. He stood in silence for a second before relaxing – he recognized the sound of Sirius and James talking.
Soon, when there were only a few presentes left, James nudged Harry with his elbow, and gave him a pointed look. Harry sighed, acknowledging his cue. He got a poorly wrapped, lanky gift from under the tree, and gave to Tessa. She just raised her eyebrows and looked from Harry to James, noticing the out of the ordinary exchange.
really smart, and she needed to study more and more if she intended to keep up. Ron had patted her shoulder, divided between amusement and fear, and Harry got angry - ‘
“Well, it wasn’t suppose to be. They should only patrol the edges of the property, and not even be seen by students. That’s why there wasn’t a oficial announcement about them to the public”.
“Oh, I haven’t even asked about how you too have been doing at school! Good grades, I expect?” Harry’s aunt asked. Her smile was only a little strained – Hogwarts was one of the other things her and her husband fought with James about. It was difficult for them to understand wizarding culture, and the importance of a wizarding education. They still barely had a grasp on it, but through the course of many years, anger and disgust turned into mild disapproval and even a little bit of interest. Dudley, most of all, seemed fascinated with magic, only paying attention to the conversation when it was brought up.
Marriages were arranged to stabilize their position, and Narcissa and her sisters were promised to other prominent pureblood families. Bellatrix was the oldest and had her engagement officialized once she graduated from Hogwarts, but Andromeda, ever the rebel, ran away as soon as she could and was rumored to be in a relationship with a
“I’m sorry headmaster, for the inconvenience, but Genevieve here was a little restless in the dorms, and I decided to accompany her in a stroll. I assure you it won’t happen again” Draco flashed a charming smile, that got him out of trouble many times before. He knew that Albus Dumbledore wouldn’t believe him, but maybe Draco could tire him out of prying.
James landed the vehicle in a empty dirt road close to his suburb, and made his way slowly to the large four story state that was his childhood home. The gates opened for him and he parked in the large garage that also kept Sirius’s motorbike.
“What!” Harry was stunned. Dementors were the single creepiest things he ever heard of. He only knew about them because of his Dad. James sometimes needed to go to Azkaban for work, and even though he knew the defense spell to repel the creatures, he still returned home shaken and spent, just for being near them. And now those things were in Hogwarts? “Isn’t it dangerous for them to be near students?”
So, even if Harry had suffered a bit of paternal pressure to befriend her at first, they were good friends now. Hermione, Ron and Harry were closer then the boys were with any other students - even Seamus and Dean -, and it made her so
While in his way through the castle, Draco had to change his route to avoid Filch and his cat – with his regular magical sensitivity, he wouldn’t be able to sense the man approaching, since he was a squib, but Draco was on high alert tonight, so he noticed him trough his emotions instead. He was technically allowed to be out after curfew, but it would be a stretch to explain why he was leaving Trelawney’s privet quarters at two in the morning – and Draco didn’t need that type of scandal.
“He was spotted in Albania” Tessa explained “The Dementors are leaving the school, and you are free again. Surprise!”
It was the last week before Christmas break, and Harry was ready to go home. He loved Hogwarts, he really did, but he just wanted to get away for a while.
They’ve been playing soccer in Oliver’s backyard for about one hour. And since there was only three of them, it was really Daniel and Harry competing for the ball while Oliver attended the goal. The boys were having fun, but since the cold air wasn’t forgiving, they decided to go back to the house.
Draco was expecting a Dementor, but he wasn’t completely surprised about it. The Boggart wasn’t exactly
Harry was flying languidly over the Quidditch Pitch, occasionally dodging the bludger that the Ravenclaw beaters would send his way, and searching for signs of the Golden Snitch. So far he had no luck. He blamed Draco Malfoy – just a little bit.
“How appropriate” Draco laughed. He thought about all of those convenient articles that would pop out of the blue and give his family the upper hand of multiple situations in the past. He guessed that there were good advantages to uncovering a stray Animagi – his Mother could name three more, of various lines of work.
Everything after that was a big mess. They told him about the carefully balanced power dynamic they had within the Ministry, and how it would all fall apart once the Dark Lord returned and told all bloodpurists that the Black-Malfoys were the responsible for his downfall. And how they would never be fully absolved by the Order of the Phoenix (You-Know-Who’s opposition), mainly because they were unwilling to reveal Draco’s position as “Prophecy-boy”, since Dumbledore apparently didn’t have the strictest moral code when it came to winning wars. Figures.
Harry woke up to something weighting down on his chest. He froze, trying not to move. After a while of nothing happening, he slowly lifted his head up, squinting in the dark to try and make out what was on top of him.
pretty obvious Harry” she gave him a coy smile “You aren’t exactly subtle. Did you talk to Draco? Did
Narcissa and Lucius Malfoy had hired her because although very knowledgeable, she was also inconspicuous. She had been Narcissa favorite teacher from Hogwarts, and even if she had untraditional methods, they were the right ones for Draco. She was his tutor during the summers, and throughout the year, a array of professionals also taught Draco whatever they could to help him control his magic, but also what could help him become a powerful wizard, after all, the Malfoys never underestimated the future.
“Miles. Maybe this wasn’t such a good idea” responded a female, hesitant and quieter than the others.
Draco laughed and hugged them once again, really happy to have such good friends in this new school. As they bickered with one another, Pansy and Blaise introduced Draco to the rest of their class and a few other students. Some of them he already knew, and most of them he at least heard of, after all, the Slytherin house is known for having either pure-bloods or families of high social standing, and he was familiar with those. He noticed that most of the students were curious about him, probably because they heard about the Malfoy family before. Draco knew that he had a reputation to uphold, but he didn't bother to put up a cool exterior when meeting his housemates, that was for outsiders. /p>
He raised his head and let the warm light wash over his face. He was feeling so comfortable in the soft grass, with his furry Familiar on his lap, that he decided to ditch his afternoon lessons – they were independent studies anyway – to take a nap under the Sun.
if it’s not something very new? If they are happy, isn’t it all that matters? It’s been twelve years since Mom died. I think Dad deserves to love again”
of not spilling the family’s secrets – and at least 10 months of the manor being under constant lightning storm, with random earthquakes and nasty curses flaring up the place – courtesy of Draco – but eventually, all the years of suppressed discontent and grudges from childhood expectations, meaningless traditions, bottled resentment and misunderstandings were brought to light, and the Black-Malfoys finally started to heal.
“I’m telling you, that’s not normal” Ron’s voice made Harry jump. He sat down hurriedly besides Hermione and across from Ron. “What?” Harry asked. “I can’t even remember the last time I
Cignus was in his home in Grimmauld Place, roaming through some old files, when Rodolphus came through the floo, looking flustered, and hastily explaining that was figured out that the necklace Bellatrix retrieved with Abraxas was not the original one.
So he walked calmly, with his back straight and chin up, making polite and insightful remarks only when it was required. Although he was pretty much drunk from all the magic round him, it was still not enough for him to be oblivious of the tension between his parents and the Hogwarts Headmaster and the other teacher. His father had explained that Draco’s family was not in the best terms with the school’s staff since the war, that was one of the reasons Draco was sent to Beauxbatons in the first place. But now that he was here, he was not going to let old grudges that had nothing to do with him get in his way, so he was extra charming and well behaved.
Draco stopped in his tracks, and then continued to leave, but before he was gone, he answered over his shoulder, “It’s Genevieve”.
Sirius didn’t have answers either “Well, for a part of my life I also thought I could trust him, so I guess I just don’t know the man. I don’t know why he is coming after you Harry – maybe it’s revenge, maybe he want’s to finish what he started... There’s no way for me to know.
On the other side of the greenhouse, Ron and Harry were having some trouble completing the assignment. Their Vampiric Vegetation was agitated and biting at any attempt to get close. Ron’s calming spells were unstable and Harry’s gloves were all torn up already. He got a particularly nasty bite when Draco, still working with Hermione, threw his head back to laugh after his own joke. Harry snapped his head up at the sound and stopped paying attention to the sharp fangs near his fingers. Ron slapped him in the back of the head, deciding he would now do the extractions while Harry tried the charmswork.
Neither Ron nor Hermione were eager to approach the subject of Malfoy’s parents, so they redirected the conversation to the lesson. Ron was glad that Hermione insisted in coming to the great hall to study instead of the library, since, apparently, Malfoy took a more practical approach to the spells. After pestering them with weird directions about intent and state of mind, Ron was actually able to reproduce all the spells he was having trouble with, and Hermione was also happily babbling about how she never though about doing things that way.
“How convenient for them” Harry’s eyes narrowed towards the Slytherin table “And I am not overreacting”. The white-haired boy had a bored expression, barely moving his mouth while talking with the other people on his table. Harry cringed as he saw that a lot of the great hall was looking at the boy, gossiping furiously, a lot of people were paying
– Harry knew his name, but it sounded so good with his posh accent. The boy gave a small frown and Harry realized he hadn’t said anything, he had actually forgotten what Draco had said...
2. Snape has more trauma in this one (James raising Harry and dead babies and losing his chance to save lily etc).
On top of the stairs that Ron and him carelessly stopped in front of, there was - besides his Head of House and Headmaster - a man and a woman with silver-white hair, perfect postures and joined arms. But his focus was on the boy in front of the couple. He was about Harry's age, with hair and posture matching of the adults behind him. He looked interested, but also guarded, the corner of his mouth bending in a small smile and eyes glimmering. Harry was curious about them, but he was quickly brought back from his musings by McGonagall’s reprehension and point deductions – at least it wasn’t detention – followed by Dumbledore excusing them back to the great hall, where the rest of the students were still finishing the feast. With flaming cheeks, Harry watched the boy being gently pushed forward by the woman, as the group continued their walk through the corridors. In the Great Hall, he sat with Ron in the Gryffindor table, in front of a angry faced Hermione – this time it was Ron’s turn to blush – and was quickly engaged by Seamus’s congratulations on the prank, Fred and George also joining the conversation. Distracted, Harry forgot all about the strange boy, only thinking about it before falling asleep, when he remembered those silver eyes.
Harry tried to figure out why the boy came to Hagrid’s defense - did he not know that his classmates weren’t exactly fond of the gatekeeper? Overall, Harry appreciated how the boy intervened, but he still had the feeling that he had bad intentions. Harry was so caught up with his own thoughts about it that didn’t notice the class taking a step back behind him.
“Well, would anybody like to hear about that time Tessa had a acidental magic situation when we were in the
He zoomed back to the Manor, remembering they were due to attend a Ministry party at seven. That was also a big part of the contingency plan his family was working on – building as many useful aliances as possible, with whatever time they had left. And these events were great for networking.
The Malfoy Forest was also known for harboring rare potions ingredients, - which made one of the steady side incomes for the family, whenever Potioneers bid them high prices for the precious and high quality components – and a few ancient plants. Before the forest, there was also a large lake, of deep blue waters and rumored to be so filled with creatures that Cygnus never dared get too close to it.
And furthest away from the Manor, in the limits of the property, loomed a large and dense forest, supposedly filled with a variety of animals and magical creatures – as a child Draco would always babble about how a Hebridean Black dragon lived in a cave deep within the forest, but Cygnus never received a confirmation about said dragon from any other members of the family.
“A Familiar?” Harry looked at the grey cat on his lap, who was also staring up at him, with her head quirked sideways “What does that really mean? I mean- how can you tell?”.
After promising to meet Hermione and Ron in the Gryffindor Tower, he went to the locker rooms to shower and change out of his sweaty uniform. Oliver Wood was still gloating about their new point advantage when Harry finished and left. He was running his hand distractedly over his wet hair, lost thinking nonsenses about the other seeker and even indulging in some weird wondering about whether or not Malfoy ever played Quidditch when the figure of a tall man appeared in front of him.
“Oh, I see why you’ve been having trouble” Trelawney said, sparking his interest “Don’t think of it as exposing your happy memories, but as taking ownership of them” she finished, simply. And just like that, it all clicked in Draco’s head.
history when it comes to the reliability of its teachers...” the students nodded and mumbled with each other, only Malfoy looking a little bit confused “... but we’ll try to make the best of it. This year, I thought we could focus on dark creatures” he pointed to the Grindylows in the aquarium behind him “Can anyone explain what those are?”. Hermione eagerly raised her hand.
- That! He had said his name is Draco. Harry was about to open his mouth to say he already knew his name too, but the boy continued, probably thinking Harry was retarded or something “Would you like to me my partner in this assignment?”. Draco had a very cute inquisitive face and Harry said yes before he gave himself time to process that last thought.
“We have DADA and Herbology with the Slytherins, Charms and Transfiguration with Ravenclaw and Potions with Hufflepuff. Which electives are you taking?” Hermione asked. “Me and Harry will take Divination and Care of Magical creatures. Those are with Slytherin too” Ron announced, making Hermione frown “You picked those because they are the easiest ones, didn’t you?” they shrugged. “Harry! You know you need Ancient Runes for Auror training!” she yelped “And that is no way to choose subjects! I’m disappointed with you both!”.
Professor Snape had taken over the Defense Against Dark Arts class for the day since Lupin had a “illness” that left him indisposed for a couple of days each month – to Draco, Remus Lupin being a werewolf was
“Ohh, I see” he gave a Harry a conspiratorial look, who got confused really fast and turned to Hermione with a questioning side glance, but she had a rather condescending, if not amused, expression.
very impressive” she said, simply. “And what did he say?” Ron asked suspiciously.“I wanted him to teach me some things, and he agreed, he said we can meet sometime” Ron almost chocked before Hermione could finish speaking. “Oh stop it, you can come along” she said pointedly, but Harry wasn’t convinced.
He heard a chorus of “Harry!” and “Mate!” from Ron and Hermione as he went, but that didn’t make him stop, he didn’t want to talk with any of them in the moment. He felt betrayed. They knew how Harry felt about Malfoy and still insisted in playing besties with the slytherin, as if there weren’t hundreds of other students in the school they could hang out with, they
The Malfoy Manor had vast, exquisitely decorated grounds. Every Malfoy generation left a contribution to the land – a tradition that made their state incomparable and fascinating.
“Hum, I don’t know” Harry looked around “I’m close to Ravenclaw’s Tower, I think, so I can find my way back”
– oh shite – where a bunch of horses? that where half chicken? (nevermind what they were, since they looked threatening anyway) were waiting for them.
Already feeling much better after his little walk, Harry was about to make himself noticed and get his water, when his eyes almost popped out of his face.
“Shut up” Hermione laughed a little too, blushing “But you’re probably right, I haven’t thought of that” she said, before going into her disciplinary tone and adding “and stop bringing up the Minister thing, he said it when he was angry and you keep making him feel embarrassed”
Draco was disappointed, because he really had been curious about the boy, but he refused to be mistreated for things he had no control of. And besides, he learned a long time ago that he shouldn’t let others negative emotions reach him. So, he decided, Harry was just not worth the trouble.
Draco knew that they would like to keep discussing the matter even further, but he didn’t feel like having this conversation, so he shrugged dismissively and said “Well, it was nice talking to you children, but if you would excuse me, I have some other matters to attend - world domination and whatnot” without waiting for a goodbye, he started making his way back to the castle, but before he was inside, he turned to tell them, while walking backwards “And please, do put your friend on a leash next time!”.
In their free period after lunch, Harry sat Ron and Hermione on a couch by the corner of the Common Room.
The faceless monsters moved towards him, and Draco grabbed her hand tighter. Although the creatures weren’t even close enough to touch them, she could tell they were doing something. It was as if they where sucking the breath out of Draco from afar, almost pulling his essence with it – that just wouldn’t do.
“I see” Dumbledore’s eyes were twinkling under his half-moon shaped glasses, and Draco found the man’s emotions at the moment quite interesting. He was curious, but in a analytical type of way, like he was trying to assemble a difficult puzzle, and Draco was a hard to place piece. “Your Genevieve is a very special animal, indeed. You know, is very rare to see bonded Familiars nowadays” he pointed with his head towards the Phoenix in the other side of the office “Besides Fawkes here, I haven’t seen one in many years”.
“I guess I’m upset because, they kept it a secret, for Merlin knows how long. And, I don’t know, it’s just... I never thought about Dad finding someone. He always talks so much about Mom, about how they loved each other. And Sirius too, about how great she was. And, what? Now Dad’s gay? And for how long? And- and with Sirius? That was
“What is it” Tessa budged closer to look inside the box, gasping when she saw it “No way” she said – very original with her commentary, was his sister.
“Thanks Tessa!” he jumped down from the windowsill, quickly hugged her and ran down the steps of the Clock Tower excitedly, trying to catch up with his friends, she assumed. He seemed free as bird, like the emotional turmoil he had carried for months never had existed in the first place.
On his way there, he was quickly intercepted by a grey fuzzball with blue eyes, which had become quite common over the past couple of weeks. Harry didn’t even hesitate in picking the cat up (that he figured out was a little lady) and carrying her along. After their time together, he had realized that she was very demanding, very loud and attention seeking. He was charmed.
“You’re so full of shit Malfoy” Harry started, his anger getting the best of him once again “You think you’re so great, walking through the hallways as if you own the school, as if you’re better than everyone” he started making his way back to where he came from, but Ron and Hermione had warning looks in their faces, which made Harry falter in his step, as well as upsetting him even more – it was like they wanted to protect Malfoy from Harry. That only made Harry more irrational. He redirected his gaze from his friends to Malfoy, who wan’t smirking anymore, but still didn’t look disturbed at all. Didn't Ron and Hermione understand it yet? Draco was from a filthy family that supported the man who ordered his mom's death. He was from the family that had kicked his Godfather to the streets. He was suspiciously powerful, probably trained in Dark Magic. He was selected into a House built in prejudice. He lurked around in the halls after curfew - and was never caught - and his cat always followed Harry around. And now he was squirming his way into a friendship with
Harry was in the large windowsill of the main alcove, laying on his back, with his backpack supporting his head and knees folded up. His hair was the usual birdsnest, and he had his glasses on – of a thin rectangular dark silver frame. It was rare for him to wear them, since there was a potion that corrected eyesight temporarily. He always drank it growing up, and brought vials to school.
That became obvious after ten minutes of class. It was surprising, though, since all the other teachers seemed so taken with the boy. Draco wanted to like Snape for it, but he realized that he couldn’t, not when the anger was so misplaced.
“What is happening here!” Narcissa Malfoy walked in the room alarmed, going towards Draco and pulling him away from her sister. “What is the meaning of this” she picked him up and hugged him tightly, looking between the three adults. “He stole my magic Cissa. I-I know it doesn’t make sense, but-but I just can’t...” Bellatrix panted. Narcissa looked from her hysterical sister to the men in the room, that looked helpless and struck.
He and Pansy knew how powerful of a wizard Draco was. But they were also childhood friends with him - therefore, seeing the boy sensing magical auras and performing complicated spellwork wandless... lost it’s impact throughout the years.
, although that was what it might seem to the unobservant eye. The fake Pansy had a more arrogant posture, a cold look and her eyes and a slightly down turned moth; if Draco could bet, he would say she would also have a Dark Mark in her arm. But there wasn’t much time for analysis, since Pansy – the original one – raised her wand at once, only muttering the incantation, and caused the black hair of her copy-cat to light up in flames, and the Boggart melted like a candle. Professor Lupin urged the now silent class to move forwards, but even him seemed a little shaken after Pansy’s performance.
Two weeks had passed since third year had started, and things were going well. Since Draco had transferred from Beauxbatons, Pansy rekindled her friendship with him and Blaise. Although they all pretty much grew up around each other, and were the best of friends when younger, when her and Blaise started Hogwarts they drifted apart to different friendgroups. She still loved and appreciated Blaise, but he got closer with Theodore, while Pansy connected better with Daphne Greengrass and Tracey Davis.
For the rest of the night, they practiced spells and studied. Pansy showed them some accessories she received by owl that day, and proceeded to add animated spells to them - Draco brought her a pair of his socks, and she made little blue stitched dragons fly around on them. Blaise gushed to them about the new book he was reading, and also showed them a plant he had stolen from the Herbology greenhouse. Draco listened intently while petting Genevieve, who was purring ferociously. When Draco went to bed, he was satisfied with his day.
“Sure” Draco nodded, and watched Cedric sit with crossed legs and look over the view of the Great Lake.
Lucius and Rodolphus were instantly up from the dancing couch, wide-eyed and muttering spells to make it stop. Lucius sat on the piano bench with his happy son, “I got it Bella” and signaled for her to help Rodolphus with the moving furniture while he started to speak softly with his son.
Cedric bit his lip, looking conflicted, but he then seemed to make a decision, and opened his mouth to say...
Angrily, he had gone to Trelawney, asking her to continue the lessons in the annoying spell - to what she agreed, looking unimpressed.
Harry was laughing and cheering with his friends, very proudly showing the Snitch to Ron and Hermione, who joined him in the ground. Before he got down, Harry saw a glimpse of a head of very pale blond hair leaving in the direction of the castle.
One way Draco’s endless affection would manifest through the years was in his unrestrained number of crushes. Cedric was the latest in a long list that included childhood friends, famous wizards, multiple Beauxbatons students, even one or another Ministry employee from random galas he attended. Even Blaise had been in the list – a dark period in their friendship history. Either way, Draco was no stranger to gushing, babbling, staring and daydreaming - watching him look less than dignified doing any of that was more than enough for Blaise and Pansy to get over whatever weird admiration had developed after Christmas.
So they were very encouraging, smiling and nodding while Hagrid introduced himself and led them to the edge of the freaking
She scooted closer and wrapped him tightly in a hug. She barely saw the cat jump away before he returned the embrace. For some reason, she was crying too.
Bella was half-heartedly sending the animated cadavers back into the water as she tried to listen for whatever he was reciting so intently. He didn’t acknowledge her or the undead army until one of them got close enough to grab onto his robes. He gave her a disapproving look as she propelled the creature away with a jet of fire.
“Didn’t I just tell you about my standing in Potions Studies?” he said, making her eye twitch again as she refilled the goblet.
“Now, I want to be very clear with you Harry. Everyone is concerned about capturing Pettigrew and bringing him to justice,
’ – Pansy heard a wide-eyed Hermione Granger parrot the term earlier, and took to repeating it in mock-wonder every time people from different houses would so much as look at each other.
“Your aunt can help you with that son, but she needs her magic first” Lucius cut in when Bellatrix’s face scrunched up, and crouched down in front of his son next to his sister-in-law “can you give it back to her?”. Draco didn’t say anything, but the lights and butterflies that he had created disappeared, and the furniture stopped moving. The room suddenly very quiet and dark. Taking that as a cue, Bellatrix got up and tried muttering “
“Confusion is a part of life” a soft voice spoke before him. Harry open his eyes quickly, to find a tall translucent figure looming above the ground “However, it is important to try and find the answers to what matters to us”.
“But, you know, they love us very much. Even this tension, it’s only here because they’re so worried about us getting hurt. You know that, don’t you? Dad cares about-“
Both got back to looking at Draco expectantly. He just sighted. “I suppose I can give it a try if...”
that dared to come out of the water, the only sign of their previous existence being their dying screeches and putrid smell.
While he waited for his friends to come back from Hogsmead, Harry sat down by the lake, with his kitty friend still in tow, and thought about all the things he learned that day. The dementor thing still had him creeped out, although, he was reluctant to admit, it was assuring to know that there were measures in place for his safety. He was also sad to not be able to go Hogsmead. Part of him wanted to sneak out through one of the secret passages he had learned from the Marauders Map, but he knew how mad his father would be if he heard about it, so that impulse was easily denied. The whole Familiar thing also got him thinking – if the cat didn’t want to bond with him, what was she doing following him around like that? Up until this day, he had only ever heard about these animals in old stories, and now he had one glued to his side. Harry didn't really know what to think of that.
That being said, since Draco returned with the news, one of the things the trio were brain-storming on was how to protect her, worst comes to worst.
charm even before he got a proper wand. He was fascinated by James’s glimmering stag, even though he only knew the spell for it’s communication purpose. His father finally decided to teach it to him in the end of his second year, even though it was a tricky spell. It took Harry the whole summer to learn, but he got the hang of it after Remus’s help. Right now, he felt assured about knowing the incantation, since those creatures were roaming around.
charms yet, and hoped the heat of the arguing would be distraction enough for them to analise the situation without being noticed.
we shouldn’t have included him. Consider yourself lucky that I already sent Flint on his way before you arrived”
Tessa giggled and Harry gave a sheepish smile, thinking about the times he almost got caught with it.
suddenly, so cold. “Draco, we should go” Pansy whispered, but realistically, she also couldn’t bring herself to move. She didn’t feel scared anymore, the fear gave away to hopelessness, like she had already lost whatever battle she was expecting to fight.
your Dad. Extreme measures were taken to make sure you are safe while this whole thing unfolds, and one thing we
Now she thought that the best strategy was to ‘bring your enemies closer’, and plastered on the least threatening smile she was able to produce, before asking him to be her partner. It wasn’t a really good strategy – she had very few classes with the slytherins – but she figured he at lest could give her some good tips on the ones they had.
Hermione also pointed to other students out of bed, names she vaguely recognized as older Slytherins, in the hallway of the DADA classroom.
How long had this been happening for? Were they ever planning to tell anyone? Were they doing it while Lily was alive?
“He transferred from Beauxbatons this year” Harry said “How do you know him?” he asked, confused. Sirius never mentioned knowing the Malfoy’s before. Actually, whenever James would ever mention them (usually something about their interference in the Ministry), Sirius was quick to show despise for the whole family.
“What made you change to Hogwarts, then?” Ron asked, genuinely curious. Malfoy seem to consider the question for a while, before answering.
“What are you going to do?” his aunt challenged him “Duel me? Argue? Not fight me – I would break you in half” she smiled.
they never went behind Mom’s back. I just know it. And, they’re friends since Hogwarts, and Sirius put his whole life on hold to help Dad when Mom died. And, Dad was a wreck after she was gone, for
Before Draco was even three years old, the family realized that it was unlikely that anyone could stop Draco’s magic from manifesting, so they opted for the next best thing – get a hold of the emotional environment of the Manor. It was then that they started the infamous Black-Malfoy Therapy Sessions.
“Uhmm” he bit his lip nervously “I don’t know. I got a letter from them not long ago, but I haven’t gotten around to reading it yet” he shrugged.
He let out a deep breath and sunk into his seat, running a hand through his unkept hair. The failure of the night still loomed over him. He thought about his childhood memories of Pettigrew, how the man always seemed weak and incapable of executing even a mildly difficult spell – he cursed his memories. He wouldn’t underestimate that traitor again. He would never let his children have the same fate of his wife.
The prophecy was about Peter Pettigrew – that was just obvious – and although his parents never seemed particularly worried about the rogue convict, the man was not the interesting part of the prediction. No, no, Peter Pettigrew was absolutely
“Wait! I got a condition!” he managed to say though the embraces “It has to be after this school year. There’s no way I can do this right now”
In all fairness, Harry’s behavior towards the Slytherin improved drastically after the Holidays. Harry realized that he was being much too intense about him, so tried to keep his distance.
It took a while for Blaise to get used to it – well, he still wasn’t completely used to it. His mother wasn’t the most affectionate or available woman, and he never got too close to any of his temporary – and now deceased - ‘father figures’. So Draco’s unrestrained tenderness was off putting, at first, to say the least.
. He literally could feel the flow of magic round him - for Morgana’s sake! Nonetheless, Draco’s skin wasn’t very thick – he was mature enough to admit that. And that stupid Gryffindor had hit a sensitive spot, the spot that always questioned why Draco’s parents had such high expectations for him, how reformed were his parents - it always hurt to think of the War, his family's part on it - that Draco was actually inferior to everyone, and everything he thought made him stronger, would be his demise. Merlin, he was so boring in his depressions.
He he threw himself at Sirius’s opened arms, thanking him, and his godfather hugged him so tight he felt his lungs get squeezed inside of his chest.
He considered if the boy was doing it on purpose, just to distract Harry, and make him lose the game. Honestly, it was a possibility.
here” she had said, with a face red as a tomato. But after a while she had recovered, and now was curious about the other guests.
“Go ahead pup” Sirius encouraged her, and she tore through the packaging, and pulled out the fluid and transparent fabric. “What is this?” she asked, while inspecting the cloak closely.
Genevieve found Draco shortly after he stomped away of the Great Hall and out of the Castle. Moments after he sat himself in a nice patch of grass in the outskirts of the Great Lake, she came running through the grounds meowing loudly, only quieting down after propping herself in his lap.
Her sisters eyes widened, and with her next muttered words, all the doors and windows closed with a bang. Death Eaters measured each other out, trying to understand the commotion, as the Malfoys and Blacks silently prepared to fight in fewer numbers - but they were powerful and this home was theirs, and so, their heads stood high.
However, there were other things about the boy that the others didn’t seem to notice: Draco Malfoy - the perfect poster child for the First Families, Pureblood Traditions and Old Magic... didn’t care about blood purity.
They said goodbye to Sirius’s relatives first, Dora ruffled Harry’s hair and promised to update him in her Auror exams soon, she also winked at Remus before stepping into the fireplace, leaving him positively red. James and Sirius made fun of him for it, before McGonagall recruited Remus to help her guide a mostly unconscious Hagrid back to Hogwarts. The Abbotts then said their goodbyes, followed by Augusta, whose tall and extravagant hat was lopsided in her head. Hermione’s family were the last ones to leave, through the front door, after having watched with wide eyes all the other guests being consumed by green flames.
“Sorry” Harry muttered. Right “Okay, hum. What do you guys think about... I mean, I know the Wizarding Society doesn’t really have a
Everything exploded during Halloween night, when her worst fears came true. The night that his now thirteen-year-old son was watching on a Pensieve.
Peter Pettigrew, because death would be too easy for him. He deserved to rot away with dementors feeding from his pathetic soul. So he left him, with the mark in his arm exposed.
When the game ended with whooping a 300 point advantage to Hufflepuff, the students invaded the pitch in commemoration. Going along with the crowd, Blaise would have missed how Potter stomped angrily back to the locker rooms if it weren’t for Pansy pointing it out for him while cackling.
On top of the constant worry for his family and friends, Draco was getting more lessons than ever before, perfecting his dueling and charmswork. His mother insisted that he also bettered his healing arts and potions. Plus, the physical training. As a result, Draco had little free time and was always exhausted. He started getting frequent headaches and was blocking more and more of his everyday sensory overload, to preserve his sanity.
There had been a large brown toad with a red bow waiting in his seat for Arithmancy Class – professor Vector wasn’t pleased. In between classes, a Howler thrown his way screeched a poorly composed poem in a ‘whisper-scream’ voice, that felt more threatening than flattering. Shortly after that, he was chased the rest of the way to the Defense Class by a cloud of dusty moths that were dripping some sort of glitter. He only got away with the last one because Potter also brought his own swarm of moths into the classroom – apparently Potter’s moths were a much grater deal than Draco’s moths, to Professor Snape.
“Thanks Tessa, I appreciate it” he hugged her, tucking her head beneath his chin “What d’you ask him, anyway” he asked, letting her go. “I just introduced myself” Harry raised his eyebrows,
“You’re lucky that I really like these robes” he huffed, adjusting his dark green vest, that had silver embroidery along the sewing lines. Bellatrix cackled but he ignored her, pretending to analyze the ongoing chess game.
As a additional thought, before he passed out, he made a note to himself to stay the hell away from Harry Potter.
In the Headmaster’s office, the Sorting Hat was brought to determine in which house Draco would be in, and although he was pretty much sure about how it was going to go, he still beamed at his parents when the hat announced “Slytherin” before even touching his head.
Draco was talking quietly with Blaise Zabini and Theodore Nott while turning to the Great Hall entrance, and for a second, he lifted his gaze and met Harry’s. For that moment, Harry felt something weird in his stomach, but he didn’t get much time to analise it, because Draco’s focus got redirected to Theresa, who was now in front of him, spluttering something with rosy cheeks.
The thing is, all these Valentine Day’s shenanigans weren’t even that stressing – Draco was just constantly on the edge of a mental breakdown, or at least that was he felt like most of the time.
For a wild moment, Draco wanted to roll around in the grass and just enjoy the fluttering feeling in his stomach, but he remembered he was a Malfoy and should have some self respect. He settled for going after Blaise and Pansy to force them to hear him gossip about Cedric for many hours.
It was a September evening, and Bellatrix was teaching Draco how to play the piano, a fairly new hobby of them, while her husband was playing chess with Lucius Malfoy in front of the fireplace. After her and Draco dissolved in giggles over a little song they made, Bella conjured a few colorful butterflies to fly around the piano, leaving Draco open-mouthed as he admired them.
“...and we want to add another ability for you to start working on. Now, I have to warn you, it’s a demanding and tiring process, so you’ll need to really apply yourself if you want to go through with it”.
Ever since the man’s escape from Azkaban, James would wake up screaming from nightmares featuring Lily’s lifeless body laying on the ground. Not even the warm tea that Sirius would prepare for him after he got up was enough to put him back to sleep. Actually, lately the tea would only make it harder, making the desperation in the pit of his stomach mix up with guilt, the ever present guilt.
Her intense purring combined with the warm sun-rays on his skin were enough to calm him down after the absolute humiliation of the flower-bomb letter.
The three of them rushed through the halls, hearts beating fast and trying to keep silent. Harry wanted to intercept Malfoy right away, but he was already very close to the other older students. Eventually, they stumbled upon Zabini and Parkinson, both wide eyed and with casual robes thrown on top of their pajamas.
, throw a killing curse towards his one and only son, his hate was nothing. He never felt a emotion so devastatingly strong in his entire life, he was going to die from it right in that moment, he was sure.
He leaned his back against the wall and slid to floor with closed eyes, cradling his hand, that was slowly bleeding from his knuckles.
The cat meowed languidly, before getting up and rubbing her side on Harry’s leg, all while looking at Draco, who seemed aggravated. Harry was also feeling a little insulted, he thought. “Do you know her?” he got up, cleaning the dirt from his trousers. The cat huffed and walked slowly towards Draco, that was looking at Harry like was really dumb.
However, a handful of student’s knew better - and the ‘better’ had more to do with Cedric Diggory winning then with Harry Potter losing.
“Oh that’s no problem at all!” his Mother patted his cheek “We were planning for the lessons to happen in the summer either way!”
Narcissa sat Draco on the couch, and got to her knees in front of him, holding his little hands in hers “It’s okay son, we know you didn’t mean it, no one’s mad at you darling” she wiped his tears away and asked Bellatrix to give him her wand “What?!” she squeaked. “Maybe he can reverse by touching it again Bella, I am as lost as you are, but we have to try something”.
Draco’s dark cloud didn’t went away for two weeks after that, he was constantly chased by at least a drizzle, and drying charms were noneffective. After it went away, his parents had to call a private healer due to a harsh fever he developed.
“Oh Harry, it’s just, we know the war was specially harsh on your family...” Hermione started, looking understanding “but remember that not everyone is like their parents”. “Yeah mate” Ron continued, looking a little apprehensive “and I heard that the Malfoys are one of the few families that tried to have a change of attitude since then”.
magic, and Harry’s was welcoming and reliable, it felt good to be engulfed by it in the bubble, it felt warm.
“I’ll be right there!” he screamed back to the Hufflepuff student from his year that was standing close to the castle, before talking to Draco in a lower voice.
“It would be more easily justifiable” Hermione raised her brows “Not that I would condone it” she added quickly after.
“Cissa? What does that mean? What news?” Lucius was trying to look her in the eyes but she just- her heart was beating so fast and she felt about to- she would rather
His mind apparently didn’t get the memo to “not think to hard”, and was reeling while he zoomed the corridors.
“It will happen tonight. The Dark Lord lies alone and friendless, abandoned by his followers. His servant had been chained and tonight he set out to rejoin his master. The Dark Lord will rise again with his servant’s aid, greater and more terrible than he ever was. Tonight... the Servant... to rejoin... his master...”
I'm sorry this took so long, I was seriously stuck with this chapter. I'm still not completely happy with it, but I think it turned out alright.
Being invested in her courses was also a great motivator to having good grades, not that lack of interest ever got in her way before – she had been top of all her classes for as long as she could remember. Hermione prided herself in being smart, it was what propelled her to puff her chest, raise her chin and speak up, even when she had no friends, and people whispered behind her back.
how to do that, but it was important to label all the different types correctly, Trelawney had said, so he could differentiate what was magic that could help him, or protect him, or even harm him.
Hermione was blushing, Ron noted bitterly, but she quickly recovered and asked “Is Beauxbatons much different? I’ve always been curious about how other wizarding schools work, there are so few of them”
“That’s Augusta Longbottom” Harry explained “Her son and his wife were Aurors and friends with Dad. They were hurt during the War, so now they have to live in St. Mungos, their minds... they were never the same” Hermione’s face was tinged with horror “They had a son, but he was killed – he would be about our age, now”. Harry didn’t want to add that he was almost killed for the same reasons as their son was. He didn’t know if Hermione had read about all those kids that died because they were born in July, but now it wasn’t the time for that conversation, especially since he would have to get into how he survived, and his Mom, and...
“We’ll tell him once the plan is already mostly executed” he started, trying to find a way for the outcome be the same even if Malfoy tries to interfere.
When Draco’s parents told him that they had sensitive information to reveal to him during Christmas Break, he knew it would be serious. He mentally prepared for it. He expected some dirty secrets about their involvement in the War, maybe even some concealed-from-the-public facts about He-Who-Must-No-Be-Named. And technically, that was what they told him. But, just... also... so much more.
He hoped he would never need to have this conversation with the Malfoys, but obviously the stars hadn’t heard his pleas.
He watched as a large painting of a landscape slid sideways in the wall in front of him, showing a metal door carved full of runes glowing red. The door opened, and Draco walked in to see a simple black book jump from one of the cramped up shelves into the floor in front of him.
“And you still believe you’re not dramatic?” Pansy raised a perfectly arched eyebrow. Draco didn’t dignify the remark with a response.
“Tessa?” the girls jumped and turned to him, some of them – including Ginny Weasley – blushing – which Ron wouldn’t aprove of one bit. “Yes?” Tessa frowned, it wasn’t weird for them to talk, but it was weird for Harry to interrupt her hanging out with her friends over it “Is everything okay?”.
all the gryffindorkish antics” she looked a little appalled. Draco rolled his eyes “Tell me more about him”.
. He felt the air shift in the back of his head, and turned to find the Ravenclaw seeker doing a last minute maneuver trying not to bump into him.
“Sirius!” Harry hugged him tight “I missed you!" he looked around "Have you talked to Tessa yet? She’ll go crazy, it’s been too long-“
“What?” she asked, distractedly, as she was moving away “Does he have a girlfriend” he held his breath. “Oh, no, he doesn’t”.
He closed his tiny fingers around her wand, shutting his eyes and sighting. “I love you auntie Tix” Draco said, and Bellatrix hugged him tight “I love you too little dragon” – because that was now a common thing for the family, casual declarations of love and appreciation. What
Quieting down, Draco looked around the room, to the wary faces of his family, seeming to notice for the first time the mood change. His smile died down, and he looked from the frantic face of his aunt to the floor. “I think I have a stomachache” he said, his voice barely audible.
“A little? Sometimes they are a little touch-y with each other, and like an old married couple, but I never, like, really thought about it. I just thought it was funny, maybe sweet”
Everyone went silent, the only sounds were Draco’s quiet sobs and the storm around him. Bellatrix raised her hand and muttered “
He reached Harry’s bedside, and touched his face carefully, brushing away his wild hair. After checking with Madam Pomfrey that the boy was indeed alright, he looked over his son’s classmates. James was very similar to Harry, even though some of Harry’s features were more harmonic, others softer – his mother’s influence, she suspected – but James’s eyes where from a deep brown, when Harry’s were green.
She pouted at him, but not for long, since a cackling Blaise swoop in with an arm around her shoulders. The two of them kept going to the Great Hall in a discreet fit of giggles.
The blond boy came out from behind the trees, seeming very tired and spent, with poorly concealed dark circles under his eyes, and his usually impeccably styled hair all messed up. He looked a little surprised to see Harry, but he recovered rapidly, standing a little straighter “Potter” he greeted him. Harry quickly shut his slack jaw.
When Blaise and Draco met her, the Sun was already setting, and they hurried back to the castle, since Draco was nagging them about needing to go to the library after the feast.
Harry exchanged a glance with Ron and Hermione, before tailing the Slytherins. Hermione, bless her, casted a silencing charm on their feet to avoid creating any noise.
with it, but growing up I heard many different things about it, you see, so I’m just trying to situate myself here...”
“I cannot believe the degree of sheer stupidity that went into orchestrating such a disgusting display of ignorance!” Harry was surprised to hear the nasty tone being use on someone other them himself.
“Have you figured out how you want them to pay it?” Harry asked, slightly ducking from one of Ron’s limbs.
They were de-fanging Vampiric Vegetation, one of their last subjects before the exams. It was a complicated process, if one wanted to maintain the good quality of the fangs, not upset the plants too much, and keep all their fingers intact.
As he turned around to follow Severus’s line of sight, James got hit with whatever spell Pyrites had been muttering, and was thrown to the ground. Snape didn’t spare him even a glance.
“Well, you see... It’s no big deal, really, I just – I...” it was hard to put into words. How do you explain that you discovered that your Father has a secret relationship with your Godfather and you are torn up about it? Jesus, it even sounded a little incestuous, ‘father and godfather’. Even if they aren’t related. But the Wizarding Society never really showed a big taboo when it comes to that – thinking about it, with how old the Malfoy Family is, Draco is probably all kinds of inbred. Wait. The Blacks are also a really old family. Could Sirius...
“Are you sure? I can get someone for you, if you’d like” the boy asked again. He was older than Draco, taller and with broader shoulders. Draco now recalled seeing him outside of school too, maybe in one of those excessive Galas his family frequented before, but still didn’t remember his name.
“Homo-what?” Ron interrupted. Harry was glad for it, since his cheeks were on fire and didn’t really like the clinical way Hermione was approaching the topic. She explained the word to Ron and was jumping back into the explanation, but Harry had already gotten the gist of it.
Harry observed the exchange. Although Malfoy’s expression stayed interested and polite, with a subtle smile, Nott and Zabini were raising their eyebrows and stealing glances at one another, sometimes looking at the rest of the second year girls that were still by the door. When Tessa came back to her friends, her face was beat red and she was panting, as if she just ran a marathon. Draco went to breakfast as if nothing had happened, but with the other boys laughing silently behind him.
“Yeah, you probably should” Draco kept smiling as the Hefflupuff went back to the castle. He met with his friend –
“And how is Lycanthropy transmitted?” Snape looked over the class, making a point of ignoring Hermione’s raised hand. “Mr. Potter, maybe you can enlighten us” he drawled.
” Draco asked, pointing discretely with his head to the boy sitting in the Gryffindor table across the Great Hall, it was the one he saw the night before. He had pitch black hair, tanned skin and very beautiful green eyes; Draco was already interested.
relationship with magic. No one could explain it,or even really understand it. He drifted towards magic in the same frequency he ran away from it - they later on realized it had to do with intent, and that Draco actually had a complicated relationship with
“I could ask you the same thing” he answered, letting his face become blank and emotionless. He learned how to seem detached a long time ago, it was a way for him to spare his energy and emotion for only those who were deserving of it.
“Hello, are you ok?” the boy had a soft voice, and ran a hand through his brown curls as he spoke. Only then Draco noticed his own face was cold with tears, and felt a little silly.
“Were your Herbology classes in Beauxbatons same as ours?” Hermione asked Draco, after they filled their first jar with the white sharp teeth.
But Harry was fine, and very cute, and actually smart. He was pretty advanced on the spell, and the jinx was a difficult one, Draco himself took a long time to understand it. Of course, his own relationship with magic was different from other wizards, and he was heavily trained to perfect it, so things came easy for him. Draco could

Harry had gotten a Nimbus 2000 when he joined Griffyndor’s Quidditch team back in first year. When he kept his keeper position during second year, his Dad gave him the new model, so Harry gave Tessa his old 2000, since then he had been using the 2001.
“She seems to be leading Malfoy towards them” Hermione noticed how they were moving away from the dungeons.
“Yeah. Ron, Hermione, Seamus, Dean, Fred, George, Lee... Basically everybody went” he fiddled with his sleeves, sounding upset.

The small and rocky island was now surrounded by the skeletal grey figures that were climbing out of the lake’s tarnished water, the sheer amount of corpses only visible in the light of her fire spells, and otherwise concealed by the darkness of the giant cave they were in.
There, his mother and his aunt were talking quietly over some tea. He sat down at the remaining chair around the patio table, and as soon as he was accommodated, a house elf appeared by his side, asking his tea preference. Kreacher was a very old and grumpy elf, an ugly looking thing, but constantly pampered and fussed over by the remaining Blacks, since he was almost as old as the house itself. After the elf brought him his beverage, his mother and aunt decided to include him on the conversation.
, but at least her reaction was much better than Ginny’s. Maybe now her friend’s crush on Harry would fade away - Tessa hoped.
“Sorry, again...” he backed away slowly from Cho’s bright smile, and she waved as he left. When he turned away from them, he felt a blush creeping over his cheeks.
Why did he have to room in the coldest, most humid, lowest level, furthest away part of the castle? He was so busy muttering curses under his breath that he didn’t realize that he was walking past the entrance to the headmaster's office.
friends with the Potter’s father. If the Head Auror is keeping his mouth shut about a rogue werewolf being a teacher... Snape apparently has taken the matters in his own hands. Think about it Marcus, the man has done everything but announce it in the Great Hall!”
He was allowed to be out of bed despite the curfew, because of his extra classes during the night. At first he was worried that the Headmaster wasn’t going to allow him his extra lessons, but Dumbledore was understanding and seemed very curious about how Draco was so advanced and required tutors in so many different subjects that weren’t in the curriculum. With his eyes twinkling, he had asked for them to meet sometime for tea and talk about it, and Draco agreed promptly – after all, Dumbledore was a very famous wizard and the boy wanted to learn more about him. His parents weren’t so excited about the meeting, but Draco reassured them that he knew how to be discrete, and they allowed it. Now, he was only waiting for the Headmaster to make the appointment. Draco was aware, of course, that Dumbledore was a very important person and was very busy, and he wasn’t in a hurry either, but he was a impatient boy, so naturally he was counting the minutes everyday and –
“Oh, yes, don’t worry about me” Draco gave Ron and Hermione one of his special shiny smiles, to make sure they wouldn’t get worked up over it.
“We also call the students to the halls. We need a lot of people to see him, so the news can get out and Dumbledore won’t be able to keep denying it” Amanda completed.
Ron Weasley was sighting loudly while Hermione opened multiple books and parchments and arranged them on the table.
Is not like he thought that the boy has plotting the demise of the Wizarding World or whatever Harry was delirious about, but still, Ron just didn’t trust him. Was it because a lot of girls payed too much attention to him? Maybe. But he told himself that the other boy was also suspiciously good in class, and that whole distant attitude was strange.
“Thank you, thank you, thank you!” she tackled Harry once again, who was still recovering from he previous violence, but hugged her back anyway. “It was Dad’s” he managed to explain, and she let him go to in favor of hugging James.
Luckily, Draco was nonsensical as much as he was impressive, and their friendship soon stabilized. The trigger, this time, for Blaise and Pansy’s ‘admiration’ to tone down was Draco’s devotion to Cedric Diggory.
“Ok. Yeah” he looked at his friend again, but as he was getting up he turned to Draco again, and sat back down “Look, what do you think about –“
“I’m sorry dear, no taking things off the list. Quite the contrary” he looked back at his Mother, who was suddenly looking excited “Me and your aunt have been thinking...”
“Look at this question” Daniel pointed at the one that was crossed over with red marker “If you, with all of those expert teachers and extra classes, can’t figure it out, it means we were totally justified” he said expectantly.
“He tried. Multiple times. He was fascinated by the process, by the transformative magic, even by the aspect of a animal that represented your true-self. He often searched for validation through magical conquests, I noticed. But this one he never achieved”
“I’ll have you know that I have my first Arithmancy lesson today, and professor Vector is known for being strict” she gathered her books and accompanied them to the Great Hall “Well, let's now worry about keeping all our fingers intact. I’m afraid of what Hagrid will find appropriate for a Creature’s class” Harry answered, suddenly gloomy. “Tell me about it, mate”, Ron shivered beside him, probably having Fluffly flashbacks.
“Where is the rest of your loyal followers?” Draco asked, noticing that there were no other Hufflepuffs in the vicinity, which was unusual, since Cedric was rarely seen without a large group of people – part of the reason Draco and the other boy didn’t have more of these alone moments.
“Dear, I would really like for you to consider this” his Mother asked “I understand you have a lot on your plate, but we really think this is the type of thing that could make a difference”
When Draco re-emerged from the Pensieve, the boy had blood red eyes streaming with tears and a look of hopelessness. The room they were in sizzling with his magic.
Draco was still shivering when he started to mutter energy and restoration spells to wake Trelawney up. He had left his wand in the dormitory, but that never stopped him before.
Harry huffed, a little insulted, but also a little embarrassed “I’m not going to run after him”. Remus took a sip of his tea, raising one eyebrow and looking unimpressed “I’m not!” Harry assured him. “So, I can’t go to Hogsmeade. What other 'extreme measures' were made?” he asked, trying to change the subject. It worked, since Remus squirmed a little in his chair, making Harry very curious.
He honestly considered letting it go by as 'internalized trauma', but he remembered all those times his sister called him
He was woken up a few hours later, with Genevieve on his chest and the arm he had placed under his head uncomfortably numb. The sky was still bright, but with the Sun much lower in the horizon. Beside him, a Hufflepuff boy was crouched down and shaking his shoulder. He stopped once Draco was awake.
Harry was extremely content by the time they were practicing spells, he had practiced the Revulsion Jinx during the summer, and was one of the few students that had already mastered it during class, only needing a few tries to get it right, while Ron could barely make it work. He was about to ask Hermione to be her partner for the Ebublio Jinx when someone stopped by the side of his table, making him look up. Harry froze when he met eyes of molten silver.
“What were you saying? You know... before? I didn’t quite catch that” he ran his hand through his hair, feeling stupid for asking, and even more stupid when he winced in pain for trying to use his hurt hand. But the Grey Lady just smiled.
"Are you making her follow me around?" Harry let the question slip, because this whole 'magical cat in tow' situation seemed a lot less fun and much more suspicious when she was reporting to Malfoy.
and Draco would be delighted to indulge him, but no – Harry just petted his owl a couple more times, gave her a treat, and turned to leave. He gave Draco a very stiff and slightly hostile nod and left without looking back.
He paced back and forth for a while, taking shaky breaths, trying to calm himself down. He didn’t even know why he was so worked up over Draco bloody Malfoy. It was like that damn boy just knew which buttons to press to piss Harry off, without even trying.
She moved across the room to go in front of a mirror, before going under the cape and disappearing from view, her giggles being the only indication of her location. Sirius and James were also laughing at her amusement, and turned hysterical when Harry began to be tackled and pushed around by his invisible sister, who he was defenseless from. It took a while before she finally settled and took out the cape.
Around the house, there were other parallel conversations taking place, adding to the happy, welcoming atmosphere. Professor McGonagall was catching up with Andromeda and Ted Tonks - Sirius’s relatives - while their daughter, Nymphadora was in the other side of the room, talking with Remus excitedly and making him blush. Hermione and her parents were also there, after James’s insistence. Mr. and Ms. Granger were talking to Augusta Longbottom, who seemed content in explaining some wizarding history to them. Hannah Abbott, a Hufflepuff in their year, was also there with her parents and younger brother, who was the same age as Tessa. Mr. and Ms. Abbott were both Aurors who were close friends and worked with James, and had lost the rest of their family to the war, so it was customary for them to be invited to the Christmas Feast.
Ron splayed the Map on his lap, and used his elbow to poke Harry in the ribs playfully “So how is miss Chang doing tonight, hm?”
After giving the school owl a treat, Draco was leaving the tower when he came face to face with a certain dark-haired boy. “Oh, hi” he said to the slightly taller boy, quirking his head sideways. “Hello” Harry glanced away nervously before dodging Draco to enter the owlery, attaching a letter to the leg of a snowy owl and petting it fondly.
She jumped out of her thoughts with the feather light touch of Rodolphus’s hand on her own, and went to scowl at him for showing weakness, before accidentally meeting the stare of her Dark Lord, who was bubbling with anger while looking at her. She also noticed she was feeling a slight headache, that vanished when he broke the eye contact. Oh no.
“Hum”. Harry didn’t really know how to respond. He was distracted for the rest of the conversation because of it. After he said his goodbyes and accepted a pocket full os rock-cakes, he promised to come back with Ron and Hermione.
Moments later, the rest of his family had mounted the brooms that were in the shed, and Harry was no longer alone in the air.
But today, it was hard not to think about it, with all the lovey-dovey business happening all around him. There where couples everywhere, and those annoying poems and declaration spells and Malfoy covered in glitter from those moths... It was difficult to keep his problematic thoughts at bay.
“Ohh, Harry...” Hermione’s expression turned pitying. Harry hated it. He looked at Ron for support, but the other boy seemed conflicted, if not confused again.
“Wow wow wow” she put a hand of his arm again, interrupting the line of thought. “Don’t go there. Of course Mom and Dad loved each other. Dad would
“Of course he is capable! As long as it adds to his dramatics!” Blaise Zabini also made his way trough the wave of students that entered the common room, grinning and giving Draco a bear hug. “Did you know he would be here?” Pansy questioned him, now scowling. “No, I didn’t dear” Blaise rolled his eyes .
. Harry cleared his throat and read the question, which was stupid, since he absolutely never studied that before. But they were expecting him to
“He’s really pretty” Draco said, softly. Harry freezed before continued petting the owl “It’s a she, actually”, he said, without turning around. “Oh, sorry” Draco mumbled, “...my family has a few owls, mine is named Volturus, but I could only bring one pet, so he stayed at home” he was babbling, but Harry was giving him
Harry’s pained face echoed the hurt Tessa felt after saying that last sentence. She knew it was true, but it was difficult to say. It was like she was betraying her Mom – even though she didn’t have any memories of her, Tessa still loved her.
“Oh, fuck off” Ron echoed Harry’s own thoughts at the audacity of the short girl, telling them what to do. The problem, though, was that Ron’s exasperation was louder than it should have been, and it echoed softly around the shadows. They five of them froze when a laugh broke the rhythm of the duel happening before them.
Severus Snape appeared shortly after, seeming reserved and strict, walking fast and not allowing too much conversation. He had greasy hair and Draco was pretty sure that the man was using a spell to make his robes flow dramatically around him – Draco really wanted to ask about it, but he had a feeling the man wasn’t going to appreciate it very much, so he stayed quiet. And soon enough, Draco was alone in his common room.
