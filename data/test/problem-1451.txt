“Only one speed,” Griphook said, before they took off once again, but this time it seemed that he was pushing the cart as fast as it could go, taking sharper turns and a longer way back, just to make the giant sick it seemed.
“YOU FREAK!” He yelled slamming down his utensils in disgust, as if the mere presence of Harry was revolting. “What are you doing here?! This place is for normal people like us!” At this point the man had gotten out of his seat, and was making his way over to the table the wizards and witch sat at. At this point the Malfoy’s had seen their Harrys reaction, and how the fat muggle reacted to piece things together.
“Sir, your Christmas present, as I said, could not be wrapped, this is because for you I would like to share my past with you. I-I am unable to share everything with you at the moment, b-but all I ask is for you to g-give me time. A-also I would not object if I went to see a mind healer, in the future.” His hands where trembling at this point, either from nervousness or just plain fear of having to think back on the time spent at the Dursley’s house or a combination of both.
After many stops, Lucius and Severus decided it was time for them to take a leave, and head down to another ally way leaving the boys alone with Narcissa, who dragged the boys off to
Harry looked up at the head table and saw Severus giving him a small toast, and the Headmaster looking in shock, not believing in what he heard, it seemed. There was another teacher Harry did not know looking at him, sending shivers down his back at the darkness he seemed to have, when Harry made eye contact Harry’s scar began to burn. He hid the pain the best he could, but of course a few wondering eyes noticed his grimace.
“Oh, joy ending yet another one squabbles.” Severus said in a sigh, yet another fight between of course.
, Harry thought to himself a small smile twitching on his lips, the longer the red head just sat there, the more annoyed Severus got.
The week seemed to fly by, Harry was enjoying the time that he got to spend with everyone, as well as studying for the upcoming school year. Of course that wasn’t his idea, it was Severus’s, saying that it would help him the first day at Hogwarts if he read at least the first chapter in all of his classes. Harry didn’t just study the whole time though, he hung out with Draco and met some more people that were also going to be in their year such as; Blaise Zabini, Pansy Parkinson, and Theodore Nott, who all were at Malfoy Manor one day. They helped him understand more of what was to come, and didn’t say anything about the way he looked or acted. Theodore, or Theo as he liked to be called, was interested mostly in some the muggle things Harry had to share. They all had a good afternoon, Pansy telling Draco and Blaise the latest gossip, all the while Draco filling Harry in on every bit so that he didn’t feel that left out. Harry had wondered if this was what it was like to have friends; he would’ve liked to ask someone, but he didn’t want to seem to strange by asking that sort question.
“Yes that does sound like a wonderful idea, strong names for the strong young ones, I do hope that you find something soon, and I know it will be that will fit them.” She said with a smile, “Ahh yes South America,” she said now switching back to the topic that we started with, I couldn’t help but smile. She was still the same old Luna.
Severus sighed, “yes that is still his fear, even after how many times I have told him over and over that he is not going anywhere that he is stuck with me until the end of time. I’m hoping that we can bring those monsters to justice here soon; but that will not be possible until Harry is mentally better and ready to face them.” Knowing that the court would want proof of everything, and that would include Harry’s memories of the events that took place during his time there at his “families” house.
I hoped you liked the chapter! :D I would really love it if you guys leave comments and kudos for me it makes me all soft and warm to read what you guys think of the story! If you are shy email me! :) and I would get back to you as soon as I can, demondog136@yahoo.com
like you could fit a house in there big - but really, it wasn’t a surprise. These are the original vaults, and only the most ancient of houses could have one of these vaults. The cart slowly came to a stop at the end of the line, one I thought I would never see, with how big Gringotts is. I looked over at Draco and he too was in shock with the vaults.
Draco just nodded and accepted what I told him, “Do I have to worry about you falling for this other guy?” Draco said in all seriousness. I could feel the slight jealousy through our bond.
“Thank you Harry. Thank you for giving permission,” Alec said pulling back Harry a little to see his face. Gently he took his thumb and wiped away the tears in the bright green-eyed youth. “Now I am going to use some of my magic to send you into a dreamless sleep for tonight, if that is alright with you Harry. You have missed so much sleep that if you continued you are going to end up making yourself sick.”
Once again, I met the goblins harsh stare flinching back into myself, “I-I’ve never received something like that either, sir. This is only my second time to be in your bank since my first year at Hogwarts.”

Harry only nodded, not really wanting to anger his new friend, and quickly made his way over to the bathroom. He found that robes where confusing to put on when you don’t know how. Just before Harry could step out of the bathroom, Draco called out, “Come on what is the hold up?” Harry gulped before existing the bathroom, for the first time in his life was he wearing something that was his size. It felt nice, but at the same time it was new to Harry, who always had worn baggy looking clothes.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Great, it’s a bloody riddle!” Gemma let out a sigh, “This is something I was never good at.”
Harry hear Draco laugh and was about to get all huffy at him laughing at his confession when, “Thank merlin, I thought I would need to gather up some Gryffindor courage and tell you I liked you, but thank merlin you are still such a lion.”
Levi said to the boy, using their mental link. He was keeping a close eye on the man in front of them, unsure if he trusted the man just yet. He and the Headmaster both smelt of death and lies; but there was something more dangerous to the Headmaster than to the man in front of them. The man in front of them smelt sick, but not the type of sick one was used to, Levi was unsure of what that meant so all he could do was watch afar and make sure that his Hatchling was safe. Harry relaxed knowing that he was not alone anymore, he took the tea from in front of him, letting the warm drink also work its magic, letting it warm him from the inside out.
“I don’t know sir,” The boy said, finally finding his voice instead of sitting there like a fish out of water, mouth open and gasping for air.
Well enough from me! Enjoy the chapter!
I didn’t even take a second to recover from the almost fall before I wrapped my brother up into a hug, squeezing the life out of him, “Nev! I’ve missed you so much!” I cried as I just held on to my rock and my support system. Nev took everything in stride and laughed while hugging me closer. I closed my eyes and enjoyed being close to my brother once more.
Levi said before Harry felt a rush of warm power rush into his mind. It gave Harry enough strength, to sit up and pound his little hands against the door a couple of times before it left him dry.
“TROLL!” Quirrell shouted until he got to the middle of the hall, staring dead at the head table. “Troll in the dungeon! I thought you ought to know.” Before falling to a dead faint, right then and there. The hall was quite for a few seconds as the news started to sink in before the whole room started to scream in terror. Draco was still in shock, troll in the dungeon and so many thoughts were going through his head. First was where was Harry, in all the commotion he had forgotten that Harry went in search for Hermione. Second was that their house was located in the dungeon, where were they supposed to go?
“No, No baby! Don’t think like that. We where waiting until we got the all clear from Alec, we would like you to be there, since I will be putting you as Heir to the prince line. Since the blood adoption was done, we can put you down. But we didn’t want to take you out too soon.” Severus tired to explain, he didn’t want Harry to think it was his fault.

Hello lovelies and welcome to chapter 8! There are more new face in this chapter, and this was such a fun chapter to write :) I do hope you like it! As always thanks goes to my amazing Beta!! <3 they do such a lovely job at looking after my work! anyways that is enough from me! On to the story!
Hello lovelies, sorry about the long wait yet again, I was having difficulty with finding time to write between my classes and homework; and when I did have time I just didn't have the inspiration. The semester is coming to an end next month, so hopefully I can have a more reliable updating schedule instead of being willynilly about times and how long I go without posting. Lots of Love and thanks to amandadubose88 on here for being my beta and reading over this chapter; couldn't have done it without you sweetie! And all of you lovelies and your kudos and awesome comments and being so understanding about what takes so long, so thank you. :)
“I am sorry Dray, but I am too nervous about today. So I went took a shower and put on the robes Milly brought for me.” Harry turned around giving Draco a shy smile, “You can go back to bed and I will go to the library, or go down to the dining room to have some breakfast.” Harry said, blushing now as Draco stepped fully into the bathroom instead of leaning against the doorframe.
“No! He isn’t going anywhere! I am not letting you people teach him any more freaky stuff!” His Aunt said back to the man, “it is hard enough already with him, he doesn’t need to know more, GO AWAY!” It sounded like she tried to close the door in his face, but the door was caught.
He stroked the door with his spider like fingers, and the door before them started to melt away, as if it had never existed. Hagrid got out the cart and stepped inside the ancient vault, which was holding only a small, brown, badly wrapped package. With that done they sat back down in the cart.
I brought my eyebrows together in confusion, “There is a potion for this?”
10/7/2020
By the time I was finished, it seemed that Draco had his own tray delivered, and had most of what had been on mine, but he also had additional fruit upon it. I stared at the fruit. There was some on his plate that I knew of, such at strawberries, watermelon, cantaloupe, but a couple I’ve never seen before. That was of course being that the Dursleys would never have fresh fruits or vegetables at the house, they weren’t known for eating healthy. So when I did get to eat fruits, it was at Hogwarts but they never offered off-season fruits; or had too many since many of the students tend to stay clear of the healthier foods provided.
Severus snorted, “Lily a drunk? No never, Lily, your mum, never liked alcohol that much and while James had a few drinks every now and again, he had a job that required enough motor skills as it was without being impaired. Besides, Lily would never let anyone drive with you while impaired.” Harry only nodded at the older man.
“I-I-I don’t think that y-y-your Head of House w-w-would mind.” With that the Professor led him back to his quarters. Harry was freaking out thinking, this might be like his Uncle, but he was powerless to stop anything from happening.
“Sev~” Harry whispered, the man stirred a bit in his sleep but not fully waking up, “Sev.” Harry tried again poking the man’s check this time. The man’s eyes popped open glaring at the person who dared to wake him up. Harry had to bite his lip from flinching, even though he was used to it most of the time, it was just a few days ago he ran in
Ragnok nodded at Mr. Malfoy’s request, stood up and made his way out of his office, leaving us there to think about what has happened today as well as what is to come.
The wedding went off without a hitch, Hermione and Blaise did a hybrid wedding, while the nature was magical Hermione wanted to keep to her muggle roots and convinced Blaise to at least wear a tux and her a wedding dress; and to say she was gorgeous would be an understatement. The yule ball had nothing on her now the dress was made of silk, because Blaise wanted to spoil her of course, the top part was an intricate lace work of flowers with silver sparkles dancing around her chest, the dress clung to her figure until her hips when the dress started to cascade around her. The dress was a high-low so the front half just brushed above her knees while the back was Just brushed the floor when she wore her heels which were a lovely gold. Her hair tamed of the frizz formed two soft ringlets framing her face the while the rest where done in a French braid placing flowers into the braid itself. She was so beautiful Harry almost cried from his spot as her father walked her down the aisle. With a glance over to Blaise, Harry could tell his mouth was dry looking upon his soon to be wife.
“You will have to wear your lordship rings all the time to prove that you are the Lord Potter-Black. As for you heir rings, no you can just put them back in the vaults as soon as they accept you,
Heyy lovelies I hope you all are doing good. I am sorry for how short this chapter is I have been busy with college ^^' but hey at least there is a chapter <3 this is probably going to be the last chapter with Alec in it, might have him in the background such as after sessions and everything but yeah, I kinda of want to actually get into the story. And have the legal system deal with those rotten muggles. I do hope you like the chapter <3
“Now Petunia, that isn’t how you treat a guest, just go get the boy and we will be out of your hair until next summer.” The man’s voice snarled at his Aunt, if Harry wasn’t in a world of pain he would have laughed to see his Aunt spoken to that way.
“Happy new year Harry,” Draco whispered as the drew back.
Before the woman could say anything the Man reach down and carefully life the small child into his arms. He was startled at how light the boy was, and only grew angrier, at these muggles. How dare they treat a child in such a way and they were blood related as well! It enraged the man even more.
“As you know, Harry has been having very vivid nightmares…” Alec began looking at the two, “these nightmares were just the beginning of bringing up suppressed memories.”
Lets start off with I am sorry for the long breaks between my chapters and updates, I wish I could give you weekly chapters like I use to and have a schedule I could follow, but my life at this moment can not handle it. My college degree come first, my well being comes second, family comes third, then my free time for writing. This is also not my top priory to update and write, I wish it was I love this AU a lot, but what comes first is MNW and DSS and if I have more free time to write then bits and pieces of this one which hasn't happen sadly. I think the reason being is I am at a point in this writing I don't want to be at, I personally have not gone through something like this (I have no clue why I wrote something like this) so it makes it difficult to write, but I will try my best. So yeah I am sorry about the long periods of no updates even though it deserves some loving here.
Harry scowled to hide the blush, “You’re just jealous I would look better in a dress then you would Malfoy.” Draco jaw dropped his face turning a bright red as he imagined Potter in a dress.
“Next time Harry please find me, and tell me, I was very worried of where you went.” Draco said softly, eyeing his friend in concern. Harry couldn’t help but smile at his friends concern, happy that for once in his life that he had someone worried about his health and well-being. He was reminded that Draco was safe, the twins were fun to be with, but they were new. Draco, however, he knew, and he knew the blond wouldn’t hurt him.
“Oh!” The man exclaimed in excitement, “I guess you never seen me like this, I am the Lord Voldemort,” Harry’s eyes widened in fear, but if what happened down in the belly of the school was anything to go by, he could not trust this man! He tried to move away from the man, leading him to scoot too far and tumbled out of the bed on to the floor.
* * *
“Good now I wish you a good day and see you tomorrow at dinner.” Narcissa said with a smile before taking her leave, leaving the boy and man alone to figure things out themselves.
I hoped you liked the chapter! :D I live off of comments and kudos lovelies and would love if you left some for me; it makes me all soft and warm to read what you guys think of the story! If you are shy email me! :) and I would get back to you as soon as I can, demondog136@yahoo.com see you lovelies soon!
It was now New Year’s Eve, and everyone was getting ready for the party that the Malfoy’s throw every year in celebrations. Harry knew that some of their friends from school would show up, since their parents and the Malfoy’s where good friends, but there were some other people that Harry has never heard of. This would be the first party that Harry would even attend, and he was very nervous about it, he was worried that he would mess up so how; and that Severus nor the Malfoy’s would like him anymore. It was at this point two red heads poked their noses into Draco’s room.
Hermione’s tears dried up some, Harry heard the latch of the bathroom stall move and the door opened to reveal a red eyed Hermione, sitting on the floor of the bathroom. Harry gave her a smile and handed her the napkin of food, “I thought that you might be a little hungry, since you are missing the feast.”
My nerves settled down to just background noise when Draco gave my shoulder a squeeze, and a sly smile, he always knew what needed to be done. Maybe I am just a burden to him; he would be the perfect mate for anyone.
Severus had enough of the talking that was going between the man and boy and came to the boy’s rescue once again, picking him off the floor and placing both himself and the young wizard into a chair. He shot Lucius a look telling him to keep his mouth shut.
Heyy lovelies, how have you been? I am very sorry about leaving you guys hanging for a long time, I really didn't mean to take a long break. But it was needed, I was unsure of how to write the next chapter and I just got a major writers block. I am still very unhappy with the chapter I am going to post, but no matter how many times I go back and fix it I still hate it. I hope you guys like it, and I hope I can pick back up on writing for this fic once again since I have finally made it past this chapter. Warning this chapter was not beta, there might be a lot of mistakes. I did try to read over it, but it got to the point all the words start to run together. If you see something that is wrong post it down in the comments so I can fix it when I have time.
Harry barely got any sleep last night, Severus was to come to Malfoy manor sometime later in the day and then they would go through the process of adoption. It wasn’t just paper adoption either, Severus brewed a potion for blood adoption. This would not only make Harry his adopted son, but also make him his blood son as well. He would gain some of Severus’s features, at the same time keeping some of his parents’ features.
Lucius rolled his eyes at his longtime friend seeing that he forgotten the promise he had made, “Well you did promise Narcissa that you would be at the manor for dinner tonight, along with Draco who was looking forward to seeing his godfather.”
It was just a few doors down from his own, he carefully slipped the door open before making his way to the slumbering man’s bed. Severus looked much younger when he was asleep, all the worry and anxiety seemed to melt away from his face; making him peaceful in his sleep.
“Well done Draco, your Father would be proud of you, I just know it. Now for everything that is to be done, is quite simple. As you know we are after the stone that is here within the walls of this school; but that old fool has it under lock and key, of course I can get to it myself, but I feel like this would be a good chance to test our young Mr. Potter to see what side he really is on. Harry already knows all this; I must say that he is not happy with being tested by not only myself, but also the stupid headmaster of yours.” Harry stiffened at what he heard. He didn’t think that the Dark Lord knew of his dislike due to being forced into something like this, or that he was very unhappy that the Dark Lord was being just like the headmaster. The Dark Lord, picking up on Harry’s uneasiness said, “Yes, young snake, I knew from the beginning that you were not happy with this, but this is the only way to know what side you truly on, if you are willing to turn your back to the light, or turn your back to the dark. This is a test to show your true colors.” Harry just gave the Dark Lord a nod, knowing there was nothing to say in his defense seeing as the Dark Lord could easily read him like a book. “Where was I, ah yes, I will give you a sign when it is time for you to act. I will not tell you what it is, you must keep your eyes and ears open so that you will know, it could be at any moment. I will let you three begin planning the way you want to go about this, since it is your mission, but no asking me for help.” The three young snakes nodded to the Dark Lord in understanding. “Very good children, now seeing that everyone understands, I will let you three get to planning everything. Let’s hope that you do not fail me at this.” Hearing the dismissal, all three students jumped out of their chairs and more or less ran out of the room. Of course, all snakes would deny something like that if asked about it directly. The Dark Lord smiled darkly at the retreading figures. All there is now is to wait and plan.

I sighed as I open our front door calling out to announce I was home, I was bending down taking my shoes off before I heard three pairs of feet come running into the hall. Two quickly jumping on to my exposed back and the other one just stopping short.
“Say Fred, can we keep him?” George asked, Fred looking at Harry then back at his twin.
“I think tonight we are having chicken alfredo, sound good?” I called to her from the kitchen.
* * *
“Sev, I am not mad,” Harry interrupted, before he continued, “I-I was just surprised at first and a little mad, but Alec explained to me that your where concerned; I’m still a little peeved at what was done, but there is nothing to change it. I-I am j-just really happy that someone was concerned about me. I-I will try this.” Harry mumbled unsure of himself. That was all Severus needed to hear before sweeping up Harry in a hug. He hadn’t noticed the tension that was in his body before the day started, but he now felt it leave his body. He was happy to hear that his
“Gemma! I have a question.” Harry said, looking a Gemma with a no longer innocent smile.
“Don’t worry we will have him back in one piece,” George said with a mischievous grin, “Harry do you want to hold him for a bit?” Asking his little kitten, holding the tarantula out to him.
As soon as that sentence left Alec’s mouth the world seemed to be put on pause. The room became deadly silent as both men looked on in shock at what was just told to them. Unsure if they could believe what they were told was true.

Both boys nodded at the advice, before taking their schedules for their first year at Hogwarts. All the first years had the exact same classes and days since they didn’t have the choices of electives just yet; so they said that they would work together as often as they could. Both the boys and the girls in their first year had already grown a strong bond with one another, and would help one another no matter what. Harry couldn’t wait for his first week of school, and was looking forward to certain classes. Also the aspect of having people there looking after him was something new to him, and something that he would never change for the world.
“No sweetie, I do not want you to go anywhere that Freak has been.” She said to her son. Harry sat in the back yard the sun already high in the sky, there was no source of shading in the backyard for him to escape so he was forced to endure the summer’s full heat.
When his uncle was done, he pushed Harry into his cupboard once again, slamming and locking it from the outside. Harry sat there a burning pain in his arse as blood dripped down his skinny thighs. Ohh how Harry wished that he could leave this place once and for all, before drifting into the darkness of unconsciousness.
The private room that was provided by the goblins was very nice to say the least. It was like the rest of Gringotts, showing off how proud race they were, having mounted swords and war harmers on the walls, the desk was a granite table top, but seemed to have gold specks inside of it gleaming in the warm light in the room. There was one empty chair behind the desk and three, plump cushioned, chairs set in front of the desk providing the seating in the room.
“Why am I not surprised to see you awake?” Severus asked, an eyebrow raised at the younger male.
Harry leaned back resting his head on the couch, his legs stretched out underneath the coffee table. Draco was smiling happily, leaning back into the couch cushion, closing his eyes happy that he no longer had to worry about the assignments and due dates. Severus noticed that the boys where done set aside his book.
Draco pulled away breathing hard gave Harry’s neck a small lick as to apologize at his roughness. Harry head rolled on his shoulder his eye very tired. In the mirror he look sated at the situation, his belly bigger now from the extra cum that was filling him once again. He purred and his hands went to his stomach stroke the tender muscled there.
I do hope that you liked the chapter! :3 please leave comments and kudos or send me and email at demondog136@yahoo.com
“I-I can’t Alec,” Harry hid his face in Alec’s shoulder, “I-I just can’t, I can’t face their disappointment in me…” Harry said the last part softly into Alec’s shoulder.
Harry smiled at his snake, happy to have him there, knowing someone would watch out for him.
For the voting I have now closed the voting I know who and what Nev's mate is! So thank you for posting what you want to see, as well as some very lovely descriptions. I will give hints here and there, and hopefully in a chapter or two you guys will met him :)

Calm young one, it seems that your magic was helping you heal, and has trapped you within your mind, so you wouldn’t feel any pain
Draco took the wand that was thrusted upon him, he felt a warm breeze and magic pouring around him, yet no one saw this save for Ollivander who was smiling like a lunatic. “Ten inches Hawthorn wood, with a unicorn hair core! Perfect for young Draco.”
“Huh?” Harry said out loud, looking down at the large hissing snake, then up to the older Slytherin. Draco was covering his mouth to keep from laughing. “Oh I am sorry Gemma I should have told you, this is Levi. He is my familiar and he will help us sneak around the school.”
“Yeh’ll get yer firs’ sight o’ Hogwarts right over there.” Hagrid said pointing out a huge castle sitting on top a mountain, as they grew closer to the shoreline.
Harry started to doze off at this point, of course he had grown up with no money so all this is new to him and he was unsure of what he is supposed to do. Of course he was not left alone in this, he had the Malfoy family helping, as well as Severus who will teach him everything that he needed to learn to properly function in the wizarding world. He was just thankful for that, but what about the other muggle born students. It seemed that magic just didn’t pop up in muggle families it came from somewhere in their family lines. It would also be the reason why so many other “muggle-born” students came through each year, but would that mean that they also have family lines that where not known of? Why has no one thought of this, or if they have, not helped them integrate into the wizarding world? It would mean that less is lost in the wizarding world, but at the same time new things are being brought in at a controlling way; instead of the pure blood looking down their noses, and the muggle born feel like they have to prove themselves.
Harry found the note odd, and handed it over to his Father then proceeded to remove the wrappings. Inside was a cloak that felt much like water in his fingers and that had a silvery misty color to it. He looked at Severus which had his eyes narrowed at the object, but hasn’t said anything about it. Harry then wrapped the cloak around himself. A gasp from Severus made him look at himself, what he saw had him in shock. His body has seemed to disappear! Harry began spinning around, making himself look like a fool doing so.
Professor McGonagall stepped forward when the hat stilled, holding a long rolled of parchment. “Now when I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted.” She said before unrolling the large scroll and started to call names, “Abbott, Hannah!”
Harry just smiled at Levi, missing the conversation they had right before Hogwarts started. “There isn’t much I can do Levi cats have a mind of their own.” He said, walking into the living room and taking a seat on the couch.
“Draco?” I called sleepily reaching my hand out in search for him.
“I will give it, but I need an answer soon, my little spy. Harry, I will give you time as well, but I have a quest when you do.” The Dark Lord said, his voice soft echoing the room, as if he knew that was going to happen, but held hope that it didn’t.
(See the end of the chapter for
At the first turn of the hall, he ran into a smiling Draco and a half awake Lucius and Narcissa, “Good morning,” Harry mumbled to the pair giving a small smile. It was kind of funny to see the adults not fully awake and lacking a morning cup of tea, they looked like death warmed over walking around eyes half open.
After getting back from the dinner, Harry had been completely shut down, the happy boy that they had grown use to now was completely numb. Severus sat Harry down on the couch and turned his back for a moment to fetch a calming potion, and when he turned back around the boy had disappeared. Severus was disappointed, the boy had taken off and hadn’t talked to him, and it hurt him. He had shown the child that he had cared for him, and at the sight of those muggles, had Harry back into his shell hiding from everyone again. Severus went in search of the young dark haired wizard, determined to show him that he was such more than what those muggles said.
Harry took a couple steps back from the professor, he no longer knew what to think, nor what to believe. His head was killing him, all he wanted to do was escape from here. ” I-I-I d-d-don’t know!” His hands came to his head his fingers tugging at his hair, “I-I-I can’t!” Tears were still streaming down young Harry’s face and he was all but heaving in his breaths, “What’s real anymore? G-g-give me time sir! P-Please!”
“I’m sorry Papa, Tom for waking you up.” The boy broke the silence, feeling a little foolish about his reaction to his dream. He knew he needed to write it down in the journal that Alec left him; but in this moment, he needed the comfort that could only be found in his Papa’s arms.
Harry had been given so many great gifts from the Malfoy’s he was given clothes and books, from Draco a broom and cleaning supplies. Severus was the best when he came to his gift it wasn’t wrapped like the others, no, it was in an envelope, from the ministry. In the envelope was the papers that they had been working for a while to get done. It was now in front of him in black and white; he was now Severus’s son, Severus was his father, it was both in every legal aspect now that he belonged with Severus! He also gave Harry the potion that would even make him his even more so, but it was up to Harry if he wanted to take it. Harry would have jumped at the chance to take it right then and there, but he felt like he owed Severus some information. First, he felt like they have done enough for him, but yet he has told his new father nothing. It was time that he broke his silence about what happened at that small, quiet house. So for Severus, his presents couldn’t be wrapped liked the others, no, he would share with him his memories, as much as he could anyways, when the Christmas was over with. Then, and only then, if Severus still wanted a freak like him, he would become his son in every way.
"Evening, beautiful.", a deep voice whispered into his ear, giving every hair on his body a reason to stand up. Draco's hand was trembling. To not receive any attention he quickly put the plate on the table, before he broke it.
"I don't care Ron. We need to have a talk.", Harry breathed out through clenched teeth, great pain visible on his every feature. Even though Ron didn't look all too pleased, he pushed his best friend in a separate room and into a chair. Possibly a break room. And a bloody uncomfortable chair.
"Theodore Nott... my... my ex-procurer.", Draco whispered, silent enough to let only Harry hear it. Theo, though, had other plans apparently.
"I'll take it as a compliment.", he moved around on his chair once again and started the motor. "It's Harry, by the way."
One long lazy blink answered his question, earning an even bigger smile from Potter. Malfoy watched the other man for several moments, before eyeing the water bottle with desperate eyes. Harry, being the observer he was, caught on immediately and helped the blond male to drink a few sips of water. The slender male practically inhaled every drop, licking them off his lips as if he was never to drink it again.
"So... Malfoy. You like it here? I mean, it must be nothing to what you are used to from your childhood, but then it's quite a tad better than Azkaban...", Harry frowned at his stupidity, probably he shouldn't mention the prison right away in the first real conversation. But Malfoy merely eyed him very amused over his shoulder, relaxing slowly into the bathtub. He barely shrugged. A small laugh escaped Harry's lips at the posh Slytherin, causing Malfoy to smile in contentment as well.
A furious growl left the Healer's throat, sounding more like a Humgarian Horntail than a human being. "Don't talk about him like that.", he snapped, wave of magic almost kicking Ron off his feet. "I was called to Azkaban for a job. Decided to go so noone else had to visit that hellhole. I ended up finding Draco,
"Dray. Draco, look at me.", he demanded, voice stern and eyes not leaving those of the guy. The blonde started trembling as he slowly moved his gaze to Harry. Looking back into tear-filled eyes caused new rage to boil in the Healer's stomache.
"Madame... I must ask you to be careful with my patient. You are hurting him.", Harry told her hesitantly. Angela immediately let go of the blonde, who looked at Harry with a thankful smile.
Lips dried out and infected multiple times;
Draco formed a small smile on his lips, before nervously biting at his nails. Narcissa looked as if she was about to say something, but kept her mouth shut.
"Oh come on, Draco. The thing is made for you. I'm pretty sure you even are the angel from my dream. You will look like one of the models on the red carpet."
Draco started smiling again. After being freshly dressed, the blond boy moved his head to lean against Harry's arm, what immediately caused warm butterflies to erupt in the older one's stomach. This feeling was definitely something he never had felt and this was incredibly scary, but beautiful at the same time.
Strong pneumonia to both lungs, no coughing possible;
"Excusez-moi!", she gasped, delicate hand on her mouth. Draco waved her off with a grin, head cocked to the side. The Slytherin looked genuinely happy, nothing like the scowling and sneering git Harry knew all too well. Coming to think of it, Harry rather liked the smile on the angular face of his former enemy. After all those years, he finally looked like a small boy again. Malfoy lost the innocent, child-like look somewhere in third year. He was still happy at occasions, like Harry almost getting roasted by the Hungarian Horntail, but it was fading all the time. In sixth year the young Slyhterin looked lost and depressed, Harry shall know after his obsession over this year. And, well, seventh year was truly another brand.
Narcissa Malfoy now looked at Harry, a grateful expression on her face. "Thank you.", she whispered under her breath, relief audible in every word. Harry gave a curt nod and walked into the other room. The other boy had crawled out of the closet and now sat on the edge of his bed, bare feet on the cold ground. He had his arms wrapped around himself in an attempt to fight the shaking from his worn out body, weak from all the crying. The pirate held out a hand to the boy and smiled sadly. "Come on. Your parents are waiting.", he whispered softly. The boy slowly took the offered hand and carefully tip toed over to the door. At the sight of his parents he let go of Harry's hand and ran over to his parents, crying in relief when they hugged him tightly to their chests. Remus frowned at the picture, obvious discomfort playing on his features. By now, Harry knew it was guilt. Remus loved children, he had been a teacher before Sirius, Peter and, to everyone's surprise, Harry started their little rampage. Sirius always had been a pirate, but he got Captain only some months ago, when the other Captain died and made him his follower. Peter joined Sirius after seeing the amount of gold he could get and possibly because he enjoyed the power he had over other people way too much. Remus on the other hand only joined, because he felt responsible for Harry and for Sirius. When Sirius allowed Harry to join them on the ship, Remus was forced to follow, just to look after the two stubborn, reckless boys. He was the last one being able to do so, and he took this responsibility rather serious. Therefore, he never really approved of hurting other human beings, always argued with Sirius if they needed to be killed or tortured and often got his way. But now having a child involved, he would throw a tantrum.
This time, he wasn't afraid to walk over the plank.
pretty depending on the display of his very beautiful arse though...
Malfoy seemed torn between freezing into a life-size sculpture at Harry touching his naked body, bursting into flames through the heat that seemingly erupted from his cheeks and crying his heart out because he felt so incredibly vulnerable right there. Somehow none of these really sparked joy in Harry, even though first and second would have definetly given him a good laugh at school. The latter sparked memories Harry didn't want to relive. So the Healer quickly decided on engulfing his patient in stupid Small Talk, something he was fairly bad in.
"You sneaked out? On your own? Are you crazy Teddy?", he whispered, inspecting the younger for any injuries. But the small boy only grinned at him, eyes sparkling in the light.
One blink.
"I would appreciate a lantern Sir. I can't heal someone in complete darkness."
Rustling of paper reminded Harry that he was actually in a room full of important people, therefore he sat up straight again and led his  gaze to Robards, who was looking through the papers the boy from before brought him. The bushy eyebrows of Head Auror Robards were furrowed and his mien got serious. Harry's interest piqued, those logs held the answer to one of the most important questions he had since he left Azkaban. Who was the bastard that has hurt Draco so brutally.

@Lillyfox5522 I hope you like the design of Angela XD. I have a lot of fun writing her French accent and I hope you still understand what she is saying.
"I lost my beautiful muse and now I have to see it bitching around with Mister Potter. Do you really think I'd let you go that easily my little whore?"
"Not to interrupt your moment, Malfoy, but I should start on washing the rest of your body. I do also have a few other patients to visit once in a while."
"Hey handsome. Up for some fun?", he asked in a flirty demeanor, eyelashes fluttering at the other. Draco realized the guy had startling green eyes, almost as green as venom or those green diamonds he forgot the name of. They gave the guy some mysterious aura. These green eyes did not quite look at him, more like behind him and his expression was concerned.
Just because the situation gave it away and he had to pay back Draco for his actions earlier, he gave the blonde's nipple a short twist, causing the other to soundlessly yelp. Again, watching Malfoy react to stuff in his current state was more than amusing, causing Harry to bark out a set of laughters, just like the day before.
The men looked at each other with a strange look, gritting their teeth before showing Harry to the entry hall, where a port key was placed on a small table for their leave. Dementors watched carefully when Harry approached the small object, being held back only by the permission in Harry's pockets, which allowed him and his patient to leave to St. Mungos when needed. Without another glance to the other men Harry ported to the hospital, directly into the room it was connected to. Malfoy still levitated beside him, sound asleep and completely knocked out from exhaustion. The healer quickly moved the blond into the hospital bed, covering him with a thick blanket and connecting some charms to him, so he would be alarmed if he woke up or something was wrong. Another charm showed his vitals on a board.
From one moment to the next, Malfoy's smile fell, his eyes going blank in a matter of seconds. He looked down on himself, his chest, his hands, his long and knotted hair and licked over his teeth. 'Foul teeth', Harry remembered reading on the diagnosis parchment. With a small sigh Harry pushed Malfoy's head back into the sink and stood behind him.
The face he achieved from this explanation was worth an Oscar. Malfoy had his eyes drawn open at the words 'they cut them open' and seemed positively throwing up by the time Harry finished with the image of just taking out an entire organ. To say he was terrified would be an understatement. As one could expect when their former enemy told them they would cut them open to rip out something in their throat, Malfoy shook his head vehemently and moved slightly back from Harry, showing him the bird all in the process.
They rushed up the many flights of stairs to get to their room. “I can’t wait for the feast,” He turned to Harry, jogging backwards. “Like, how much food is there even gonna b-“ Ron bumped into another boy, his body jolting back.
“Yeah but you should know that.”
“Hello,” She softly greeted the two.
“Pansy,” Blaise brought a palm to his face.
“Eh,” Ron brushed it off and walked to a corner on his side of the room to change. “You think Malfoy’s gonna start a fight with you?” He said, his voice mumbled from a distance.
“Let’s play truth or dare,” Pansy ignored Harry’s comment. “Draco first, truth?” She turned to the pale boy who leaned against the wall with his hands deep into his pockets.
“Put him in,” Hermione told Draco who carried Harry, along with Ron as they carried Harry into the car.
“Your parents never told you about those things?” Harry remained quiet. “It’s alright, it’s a lesson in a way. I hope Pansy gets what she deserves. Don’t hang around that crowd,” Ron told Harry, climbing out of his bed. “I thought that Malfoy did something,” He added. “Nearly got in a punch on with the git.” Ron sat on Harry’s bed, placing his hand on his shoulder. “You scared me.” Harry pulled Ron in, wrapping his arms around his neck and the two stayed in that position for a few seconds.
“Mate why would you take that? Always make sure you get your own drink at a party, and it’s Pansy Parkinson.”
“She’s in our house mate, that’s the girl,” Ron nudged Harry in the arm. “She’s beautiful,” His words were slurred as he watched Hermione sit across them.
“Of course. Everyone does at some point in their lives. It’s just a matter of whether you want to be positive or negative about it.” Silence surrounded the pair, but Draco liked the silence.
“Why would Pansy do this? You did it.”
“Dear God, what was that?” Hermione flattened down her dress. “It’s like he’s looking for a fight.” Harry ignored her comment, watching Draco chatter to Blaise and Pansy. Draco’s gaze fell onto Harry, and Harry instantly looked at Ron.
“Yes,” Ron muttered, rolling his eyes.
An old man who was formally dressed up with a suit stood before all the students and the hall went quiet. He had a long beard and long hair that rested on his chest in the colour of ash. “Students, may I all welcome you to the college of Hogwarts,” He announced, receiving an applause from everyone. Many other professors stood beside him, eyeing the audience. “I am Professor Dumbledore, and may you all be introduced to your professor’s when you attend your classes. This may be confronting, that I do understand but it is also a new chapter.”
“Ah, Potter is here,” Draco appeared looking down at Harry.
“Maybe talk to her tonight,” Harry suggested, removing his grey shirt from his torso and putting a plain, black jumper.
“Ah, yes. Those times are a struggle but hey, you’ll overcome it.” He listened to her.
“I’m not talking to Pansy now, because I hate what she did. We’re not friends but at least I’m bloody trying here,” He rose his voice.
“Thank you and thank you so much for putting all of this together,” Harry answered.
“No, no, it’s fine,” He yelled, grasping a beer bottle. “I just wanted to welcome a new year with a party, so have as much fun as you want, get piss drunk or go dance!” Hermione joined them, handing them two martinis.
“Guys!” Cedric Diggory greeted them with a big hug. “I haven’t properly spoken to the both of you but I’m Cedric Diggory as you know. It’s great to have you guys in Hogwarts,” He grinned with rosy cheeks.
“Honestly, not really. I just remember being in a car. I feel like we went home so early, was the party terrible?” Harry questioned.
“Blimey… it’s beautiful ain’t it,” A voice spoke. Harry turned to his side to see a boy with bright coral hair. It was honestly hard to miss the boy. Harry parted his lips to speak, “Oh, I’m Ron Weasley,” The boy introduced himself before Harry could talk, reaching his hand out.
“Trying what exactly?” He scoffed, following with a smug smile. “Ever since you helped me that night, I suddenly have to thank you.” Draco looked down at Harry, his piercing grey eyes staring at the bright green in Harry’s, but he didn’t say a word.
“What is this?”
“Are you alright there, Weasley?” Hermione giggled, clasping her roseate lips.
“Pansy, what kind of shit is this?” Blaise asked her. Ron took a deep breath in, wetting his lips and walking away from the group.
“Who’s asking?” The Slytherin student mumbled, not turning around once. Harry came to his side but kept his fair distance. Draco’s gaze averted to Harry. “How dare you speak to me,” He said through gritted teeth, standing still. Harry cleared his throat, looking anywhere but at Draco’s face.
“I know it has been a process to get everyone in their dormitories, so after this is done you will be treated with a large feast in the main hall.” Ron’s face lit up, and he was going to speak again but then he remembered he’d better not. “The sorting house ceremony will commence later in the day. May you all continue,” Professor Dumbledore finished, walking away.
“What did Ron do to you? He accidentally bumped into you one time, god what is wrong with you?” Harry was scrunching his expression.
“Do you need something?” Hermione sneered, her arms out. Draco’s gaze shifted to her, and he shot her a rather deathly glare.
“Sir, I’d feel more comfortable being paired with someone I know,” Pansy cocked an eyebrow at the Professor.
“Students,” A man spoke up with a heavy tone. “Professor Snape, your chemistry teacher,” He added, eyeing the classroom with absolutely no expression on his face, in fact he seemed rather bothered. “Open your textbooks to page 532.” Harry listened, but his mind was pondering on the encounter with Draco, and he was still furious. He glanced at him and saw Draco whispering to Pansy. The two eyed Harry, and that only infuriated him even more. He didn’t want to start a scene, especially on his first day but he knew the two were bad mouthing him.
“Harry, I’ll do it again,” Hermione huffed, causing the young man to sit right up again.
“Relax, it’s okay,” The boy told him.
“Harry, Ron!” Hermione shouted from afar, running up to the two.
“This is Ha-“
“For fuck sake at least I’m asking you how you are!” Draco took a deep breath in through gritted teeth, running his slender fingers through his shiny hair. He hated that Harry knew that he cared. He didn’t want to show him that, so he felt better to convince himself that he doesn’t care. “I won’t bother anymore.” He left.
“Let’s play a game or something,” Harry suggested.
“And you think I’d believe you? After your coldness towards Ron and I who haven’t done anything to you.” Draco listened, but didn’t have an answer to that.
“I- I um, I don’t- I think I’m going to go back to Ron and Hermione,” He stuttered. Draco eyed the brunette who moved slowly with tired eyes.
“I’m not asking for a thank you I’m just asking for you to believe me,” He finished, pushing the door open and leaving Harry in the bathroom. Grabbing his clothes and throwing them on, Harry thought about the meeting ahead with Pansy, first week of college and things were already crashing.
“Alright, sweet I have liquor too,” Blaise responded, “And nah, I’ve run out.” Ron scrunched his face as he listened to their conversation.
“Harry Potter,” Professor McGonagall read from the paper, and Ron jolted from his seat.
“I can go if you want, I’m not sure why she brought me here,” Harry said, receiving a deep chuckle from Blaise.
“You know, you don’t have to tell me, Draco.” He blinked at the sound of his name leave her lips. “You don’t know me, and I don’t know you. So, we can just sit here.” A slight weight was lifted from his shoulders, and the tight knot pitted in his stomach unravelled.
“Draco Malfoy,” Professor McGonagall added. The white-haired student got up, his hands in his pockets.
“Um,” Harry muttered, grabbing a denim jacket from his closet. “Maybe try this instead of that jacket.” Ron changed his jacket, staring at the mirror.
Everyone got up, meeting with their friends, walking around the college and returning to their dorms before class starts. “So, who’s your roommate?” Ron asked Hermione as the three walked.
“I don’t like people. I don’t like your friend,” Draco sternly answered.
“Well, can’t I come?” Hermione asked.
“Well, let’s go tonight,” Harry agreed, swinging his legs off his bed.
“Well that’s why you have a map in your hand, is it not?” Draco slightly raised his tone. Harry parted his lips to speak, “Or are you just stupid?” Harry’s eyebrows were knitted. He was open to being acquainted with the Malfoy, but he knows where he stands now.
“I’m Harry Potter,” He lightly grinned, gently shaking Ron’s hand.
Arriving at the college that was about an hour and a bit away from his home, Harry found a spot and parked his car. He turned his key, analysing the very large building before his eyes. “Hogwarts College” it read in bold letters. The building was beautiful, and it had a vintage look to it. Harry breathed in, opening the door and grabbing his suitcase and extra bags. The parking lot was filled with cars and there were students walking around, chatting and standing near the building. He walked in the building, receiving a few glances from students. The ceilings were far too tall, and the rooms were gigantic which made Harry even more excited to see the dormitories.
It was odd, because he doesn’t know how to open up to anyone, especially a girl he has never had a conversation with, but for some reason he wanted to talk to her. He wanted to stay here.
“Ron, that’s not really nice,” Hermione shot back at him.
“Thanks mate, let’s go.” The two of them rushed down the stairs, down to the parking lot and hopped into Ron’s car.
“I quite actually like the uniform,” Hermione spoke, fixing her black skirt and her red sweater, matching with her striped scarf which had the Gryffindor colours.
“You know what happened last night, right?”
“Whatever,” Draco mumbled, flipping to the task page from his textbook. Harry didn’t exactly know what that meant, but he decided to stay quiet and do his own thing.
“Well, let’s make this night a good night.”
“I’m sorry about chemistry last time, I just didn’t think you’d react that way, but you were asking for it if I’m going to be honest.” Draco kept his eyes on Harry as he took a swig from the bottle he held. He reeked of expensive cologne and alcohol.
“Harry Potter,” Professor McGonagall called out. He turned to see Pansy Parkinson, Professor Dumbledore and Professor Snape standing together. He walked toward them as McGonagall made her way to her office, and they all followed. Pansy glanced at Harry, tugging on the sleeves of her hoodie, but Harry didn’t look at her once.
“Hold on.”
“Oh, yes I was confused for a second but yeah I read about that, don’t they base it off your personality traits and all?” Harry said. “I remember we had to give a detailed description of our traits and what not in our college application.”
“Thank you, Aunt Petunia.” She got up, gently brushing the sides of her knitted skirt.
“Friends with the enemy now?” Ron tilted his head on an angle.
“Hermione, I was just getting a crack outta you,” Ron shook his head and Hermione playfully rolled her eyes.
“I didn’t do anything!” He barked at Ron, stepping forward and leaving the smallest gap between the two.
“Harry, that’s wonderful then. It’s better to start the year like this,” Hermione grinned, her smile leaving when the Malfoy’s conversation grew louder. They all watched as Lucius toned his voice down, standing in front of a very still Draco who almost appeared afraid.
“Harry, come play truth or dare with us,” Pansy approached him. Harry turned around to his friends who looked like they were having the time of their lives. He was confused, he thought Pansy disliked him and something didn’t feel right. He didn’t see Draco or Blaise with the Slytherin.
“Good luck Potter,” Vernon spoke, a small smile on his face.
“Yes,” Hermione confirmed.
“Harry,” Ron said. “Her face, that dress and those heels… she’s an angel.” Harry let out a deep chuckle, patting his back.
“Well, I like books, science, sport and many other things,” Harry answered, “and you?”
“Yeah, he’s a nice guy. Where is this party though?”
“Harry Potter,” A soft voice said which startled him. He turned around to see a pale girl who wore a pastel yellow matching set with a top and a frilly skirt. Her long locks of platinum swayed behind her. “I saw the catastrophe that happened yesterday, and I just wanted to ask if you’re okay,” She smiled. Harry cocked an eyebrow, thinking the drugs must’ve hit him hard because he had no clue who this young woman was.
“About forty minutes away,’ Ron answered, his attention falling off Harry. A girl with light hazelnut locks that ended just above her shoulders waited in the front of a line. She wore a button up shirt under a washed-out denim jacket with black jeans and converse shoes. “Take a look at that one,” Ron sighed.
“We’re not friends. I’d say we don’t dislike each other anymore though. We’re neutral,” The Gryffindor hummed. Hermione and Ron paused.
“I know she’s beautiful, I can feel it.”
“Draco,” A voice echoed through the hallway, capturing many of the student’s attention. Draco watched his father approach him and Harry.
“Yeah, I’m guessing that’s it. I’m not sure what the best house is but I hope we’re in it.” Ron paused for a bit, fiddling with the zip of his jacket. “If I’m going to be honest, I miss my family… I mean I know all my siblings are also here but my mother and father.”
“Would you sod off, Malfoy? What- are we suddenly friends because your best friend fucked up?” Harry snapped. “You don’t care about me; you care about what’s going to happen to her.” Anger boiled in Malfoy’s veins. Rejection wasn’t something he usually felt and coming from Potter, it fuelled him up even more.
“You what?” Hermione shouted. “You drugged him? Are you bloody sick or what?”
“Hermione Granger is a very pretty name… very nice,” Ron nodded, smiling with a clenched jaw. Hermione wore a look of confusion, following with a low chuckle.
“Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy,” Professor Snape moved on, still glaring at Pansy who was looking at Draco with a guilty look. “You can stay after class. Don’t think I’d allow that behaviour to slide, that’s ridiculous,” Snape spat, leaving Pansy without a partner.
“Hermione Granger,” The Professor added, watching the young woman make her way to the front. The ginger haired boy watched her, his eyes dazed as he remembered her from earlier. She glanced at him with clasped lips, collecting her uniform.
“For fuck sake,” Ron groaned, looking at Hermione with groggily eyes. Hermione stood before them, with a mischievous smirk painted on her lips. Harry stared at the ceiling, his eyes beginning to slowly shut.
“How do you be positive?” Draco bowed his head.
“Okay, okay we’re up. What’s so urgent?”
“I don’t know. I just didn’t think about it properly. Forget about it, thanks for being there I guess,” Draco scrunched his expression when Harry said that.
“I don’t ever go to parties much, I just didn’t think of it.”
“Oh fuck off,” Draco spat at the Weasley. “Pansy,” He added.
“Why would I be asking you what happened? I’d just ask her. You should be thankful that I’m even trying here.” Harry’s expression lit up, with widened eyes.
“What do you mean? You don’t have a type?”
“Why thank you,” She replied, pushing a strand of hair behind her ear. “Let me get you some drinks.”
There was a dead silence between the two, until Harry scoffed and nodded. “You’re very shallow. How sad is that.”
“I don’t kn-“
“It’s a Saturday, why would you want to sleep your day away? Anyways, Cedric is throwing a party tonight, care to join me?”
Later that night, all the students of Hogwarts college began to get ready and leave to set up the party. “I wonder if people are going to drink and all,” Ron mumbled to Harry as the two jogged upstairs.
Draco was quiet. He wanted to talk to someone, and Luna Lovegood surprisingly made him feel at ease. But he didn’t know her either which made him hesitant, but he just wanted to breathe. Usually, he’d be reluctant to even speak to someone, but it was different this time.
“This kind of makes me nervous,” Ron mumbled, following Harry into the party. A few people were dancing, and couples were making out in different corners of the hall.
“It is. How far do you live from here?” Harry asked.
“I just asked a question because I’m just a bit lost.”
“What in God’s name is going on?” Professor Snape barked, rushing toward the pair. The rest of the class intently watched. Draco’s chest was rising at a fast pace as he huffed. “The two of you separate immediately. Mr Malfoy you will meet me in my office right after class and Mr Potter I will contact Professor McGonagall about this,” Harry gathered his belongings, shifting to another table.
“I don’t have a type,” Draco looked at Pansy who didn’t look satisfied with that answer. Harry felt drowsy, and his eyes were suddenly heavy.
“You be careful out there, young man,” Harry nodded, it isn’t something he’s ever done, but he wanted to in this moment. Harry stepped forward, embracing her into a hug. She closed her eyes, holding him and then pulling away. Dudley and Uncle Vernon stepped outside, watching Harry.
“Goodbye, I will visit on my break,” Harry spoke out before he stepped in his car and shut the door, leaving his neighbourhood.
“Don’t you find it odd though that we have to wear uniform in a college?” Ron questioned.
“But what are you doing besides ask me how I am or what happened?”
“Harry Potter.”
“We don’t have to work together we can just pretend we are,” Harry muttered, looking at Draco sit beside him. He got a whiff of vanilla and amberwood from the boy as it lingered in the air.
“He’s a higher year than us, right?” Harry mumbled, rubbing his eyes.
“Are you alright?”
“So tell me about yourself, Harry. What are your interests?’ Ron asked, making a conversation as he eyed the long line that awaited.
“You speak in my classroom?” The Professor said, eyeing the two Slytherin students. Harry turned his head, along with the rest of the students as they all fixated on Draco and Pansy. “Slytherin… what a disappointment.” Draco’s eyes fell on his books. “I will assess you all a partner, you will work on the task from the page number I have given you, do not speak to anyone else but your working partner,” Professor Snape explained, holding a piece of paper.
“Hi, Luna. It’s nice of you to do that, I appreciate it. I’m fine thanks I’m just a little lost,” He spoke, gripping onto his bag of toiletries, “Well I’m going to have a shower, it was a pleasure meeting you,” He waved to her and she did the same. She watched him rush off, wishing she had time to have a conversation with him. He entered the empty bathroom, setting his bag down and taking a breath. He removed his pyjamas and stepped into the shower, letting the warm water trickle down his face. He hadn’t seen any teachers yet, but he knew that he’d be questioned about what happened last night. He felt anger about what Pansy did, and it only made him question if Draco Malfoy was in on it too. After he scrubbed himself and was finished drowning in his own thoughts, he dried himself off and wrapped his towel around his waist, stepping out.
“Believe that everything is going to be okay. Surround yourself with people that make you happy, talk to people and do something you love,” She told him.
Ron’s mouth parted into an ‘o’ shape and the thought of Harry finding out he was drugged made him feel sick. He didn’t even know what was ahead for Pansy.
“Holy shit… that one isn’t happy,” Ron chuckled as Harry shook his head with a grin. His first day was already interesting. The college he goes to is the size of a castle, he made a friend already and he had a not so pleasant encounter which all just made him even more excited for the days ahead.
“I just- I didn’t think of anything about the drink.”
“I don’t know,” Draco answered.
“There’s a big hall he rented about forty minutes away from here. We’re allowed to leave the campus on weekends, so he decided to do it there,” She explained, pulling out her phone to show them the text from Cedric.
High school was one thing, but college was another. Being a young adult, becoming independent as a person and financially. Being responsible, it takes a lot. And it’s something Harry wasn’t very prepared for. Living with his Aunt and Uncle, Vernon and Petunia and his brat of a Cousin Dudley, wasn’t much of a joy for him and in a way, he was quite relieved to go off to college. He reminisced about his childhood and his high school years, and how it all went by too fast. What broke his heart was that he wished his parents would have seen their son grow into a young man, but deep down he knew that they were looking down on him. They’re watching the man he’s become.
“Morning,” Harry mumbled, causing Ron to dump his phone away.
“Have a drink, loosen up,” She passed him a drink and Harry happily took a sip of which tasted like lemon and vodka, mixed with a heavy bitterness.
“Of course, I just didn’t know if you wanted to.” The two continued to chatter, and Harry watched Draco, Professor Dumbledore and a tall man with white long hair speak amongst themselves. He assumed the man was Draco’s father, azure eyes, pale skin and white hair. They got to their lockers, opening their locks and grabbing their books for their first class.
“I like this,” He lowly mumbled. Perhaps this would be the start of a friendship, maybe a friendship Draco Malfoy never knew he needed. Even though it wasn’t much, sitting in silence next to someone who brought him unexpected comfort made him want to stay in this moment, forever.
“He’ll be fine with us,” Ron told the Slytherin who frowned.
“Harry, truth or dare?” Pansy asked.
“Dear lord you’re fast,” said Luna Lovegood. Malfoy stopped walking, reaching the top of the stairs to see the petite blonde girl looking at him.
“Well who was your first kiss?” Pansy tilted her head to a side.
“What happened?” Pansy shrieked as Hermione and Ron rushed toward the scene. Harry faintly heard the footsteps and voices of Hermione and Ron, but it became more and more of a blur each second. The rest of the students began to watch and approach Draco who had panic painted across his face.
“Cedric…” Ron trailed off, turning to Harry who looked just as confused.
“Oh- Harry, Harry Potter,” He let his hand out, gently shaking the man’s hand. Draco eyed Harry who interrupted him, but not on purpose.
“Do you go through those times?” He innocently asked her.
“Do you see how he presents himself?”
“What’s the matter?” He asked. Harry turned to Draco who he couldn’t clearly see. His vision became a blur, and Draco’s voice echoed in his ears. He felt the weight of his body tip, and he was about to meet with the ground until Draco caught him.
“I- Yeah, I don’t feel so good,” He breathed, gripping onto the rail of the staircase and bending his knees to sit down on the steps, and so did Luna. This young lady was a bit odd to the Malfoy, and he felt strange talking to someone he barely knew.
“Harry, we’re going to get you back to the college. Pansy Parkinson drugged you, mate. You’re okay we’re going home,” Ron reassured him. Harry couldn’t even process what he was being told, he was completely lost.
“If you’ve got an issue with me, you can go ahead and say it,” Harry breathed out, grabbing a flask.
“Sit down,” McGonagall ordered, her eyes not leaving Pansy. “I’m extremely disappointed to hear this news. It’s the beginning of the school year, and Lord help me you will face serious consequences as a result of your actions,” She spoke to Pansy. Harry’s eyes fixated on the brunette girl. “Mr Malfoy and Mr Zabini have explained to us what occurred that night. Mr Potter,” McGonagall laid her palm out towards him, “I’m very sorry that this happened. I have contacted your Aunt and Uncle about it. They are fully aware.” Harry swallowed, thinking about how stressed Aunt Petunia probably was.
“Made it myself,” She pointed out, a smug look painted on her face.
“Are you serious? Why would I-“
“We’re next in line,” Ron whispered to Harry as the professor shot him a stern look. Ron swallowed, giving all his attention to the old man.
“Did anyone give him a drink? Or see him pick something up? Did he take something?” Hermione spoke quickly, locking in Harry’s seatbelt and snaking her arm around him. Draco listened to Hermione, looking at the ground. Ron watched him intently.
“Harry Potter and Pansy Parkinson.”
“I did see twins with red hair… they’re your brothers?”
“What is with that tall, dark and handsome nonsense,” Ron muttered, wetting his lips, “I don’t know who he is.”
“Malfoy?” His words were slurred. Draco remained quiet, swallowing hard.
“Jesus fuck,” Draco breathed, “Just hold on,” He told Harry whose eyes were slowly shutting.
“Good lord,” Ron muttered, watching her run in five-inch heels. She threw her body against Harry’s embracing him in a hug, and then gently gave Ron a hug.
The boy was startled, and he didn’t look happy. “Watch where you walk,” He sneered, brushing his black turtleneck. He was tall and lanky, and he had platinum blonde hair that slightly fell in front of his face. His hair wasn’t much different to the colour of his skin, pale and faded.
“Lavender Brown,” The Gryffindor student replied, “She’s a bit of a chatterbox… but she’s fun,” Hermione said. “She’s helped me plenty, she’s very beautiful.”
“Is everything alright?” Harry asked him. Draco fiddled with his ring, his eyes searching his surroundings.
“Fucking prick,” Draco snapped, jumping from his seat. Harry didn’t flinch, instead he also stood up.
“He’s a git anyway, don’t you worry,” Ron huffed, grabbing his car keys. He paused and cocked an eyebrow at Harry, pointing to his outfit which was a black and white plaid jacket thrown over a black tee shirt and jeans.
"Today? Are you serious? How am I supposed to-... God fine! I'll be there. Yeah. Bye.", Harry ended the call with a hateful look to the small electronic device, as if it was reason for every misery he had to endure. Draco looked at him with a questioning look and the shorter caught on. "My boss. He wants me to show up at a Christmas dinner party with some important people from New York. With a date. Today.", a groan escaped his lips. "Sometimes I wish I could quit."
Emerald green eyes found the deep brown eyes of the Minister, holding a stare for several seconds. Eventually, Harry looked away and sighed. "I told you he was."
After a short pause Malfoy nodded and lay back. Harry took his chance and finished bathing Malfoy, careful on the broken ribs and not touching any intimate body parts. Not that he didn't have to touch those parts anyways, because he had to put some salve onto the infections sooner or later, but something about his incredibly gay being didn't allow him to do that just yet. Maybe he would tell Val to do it. Well, maybe not Val, she would probably ask Malfoy some really uncomfortable questions. Tara? Tara would probably ask even worse questions. Merlin save him. Worst case scenario, he would tell Malfoy's mother to do it. Maybe that was appropriate. But he couldn't just owl her.
A snort escaped the blonde, at least he was as much of a cheeky badger as usual. The first comment though made him look to his left where Harry stood. Indeed, the Raven looked like he was watching the love of his life before him... maybe that wasn't even exaggerated? At least Harry stayed the whole time with him, risked his job for him and even started a beating. Probably seeing Draco with a child did the last thing for the smaller. The way Harry stalked nearer and pulled Draco into his arms, hands caressing his high cheekbones and pink lips spoke more than thousand words or thoughts could.
"Deep breaths Harry. Whatever it is, I am sure we can solve it. Give yourself a chance to calm down and think.", he whispered into his friends ear, hand fisting Harry's jumper. Slowly, very slowly, Harry started breathing normally again, falling right into Ron's arms with his vision blacking out.
"I-... No.", the guy ran a hand through his wild locks as Draco's face fell a little bit, but he gave an apologizing smile. "Look, there is quite the storm coming up and I'd like to advice you to go home? Before the storm comes."
"Do you... have a weapon?", he whispered really quietly. A smile formed on Harry's lips, the small boy was a curious little one after all. From underneath his linen shirt he drew his small dagger, a gift from Sirius when he joined the crew. Stories were told it was an old Caribbean dagger, the handle out of pure gold and the blade of silver. To prevent it from cutting into his stomach, Remus made him a leather scabbard. The pirate moved the scabbard further off the dagger, so the blade reflected the full moon above them. Draco whispered a small Wow, so Harry handed him the small weapon for further inspections.
As a kid, Draco often had been to Paris, his second home in a way, as his ancestors had lived here and the Malfoy's still owned a beautiful small Manor just outside of the large city. Now that he was back, a tinge of nostalgia turned his exhaustion into excitement. The Eiffel Tower stood high and elegantly in the far distance, the Seine parting the packed city just enough to make a nice view from where Draco sat on his balcony. A warm breeze caught the shoulder length hair of the blond boy and ruffled it delicately, just enough to not ruin the perfect curls.
He didn't use a spell, however, but instead wrapped Malfoy up in his arms again, giving the blond Slytherin a form of protection and stabilization he surely missed from his days in Azkaban. Harry knew all too well from long nights with nightmares that even the biggest war hero needed a pair of arms around him to make him feel safe again.
"Don't you worry. He is always like that.", the blonde cleared with a smile, his hands pressed together firmly behind his back.
Harry's inner tantrum was rudely disrupted by Malfoy tapping his shoulder, his lips forming the word 'parchment'. Why Harry could lip-read? Andromeda teached him soon after she lost her hearing, because she became very involved with other deaf wizards and witches, who mostly couldn't really talk. They formed words with their lips and did sign language. And after five years of talking to these people at weekends, when he took care of Teddy, he was able to read lips and talk in sign language fluently.
Draco complied with a bright smile, drawing the old woman into his arms and kissing her cheeks the way French people did. To his own surprise, the gesture didn't disgust him that much anymore by now as it had done when he had been a small boy. Something about kissing strangers just hadn't felt right to his childish mind.
With these words he casted a stasis charm on Malfoy's back and gently lifted the blonde into his awaiting arms bridal style, careful to not put pressure on any of the injuries. Malfoy grabbed Harry's robes again with his bony fingers, seemingly afraid to be dropped. Of course Malfoy couldn't fully trust Harry after only a few hours of civility, but that doesn't mean Harry's heart ached any less. It would take ages to get Malfoy to trust him, what if there was no time for that. What if there was not enough time for Harry to fully heal Malfoy, mentally. Harry wasn't a Mind Healer. He was only there to cure physical damage, but that didn't seem enough. It didn't seem right. Right there, when Malfoy clung to his robes with fear in his eyes, Harry decided that he was way too far gone to be only the Healer. He was already more than that. No matter how, he would he there for Malfoy until he was fully back.
"You are looking way too sexy for your own good.", Harry rasped, pulling his man closer to place small kisses on Draco's neck. The blonde tilted his head to give the smaller more room to work, smiling at the butterflies erupting in his stomach. All contrary to the acid that had risen in his throat most of his life at similar actions of other men.
Sweatdrops clung to Harry's forehead as he finally threw open the door to Ron's office. Two heads immediately whipped into his direction, one even more surprised than the other. Ron, on the one hand, look surprised about Harry being in his office as his best friend never dared to set foot into the Ministry, while on the other hand Blaise Zabini hasn't seen Harry since school, even though he was Ron's partner at work since Auror training.
"Darling, that's a bit too much.", she drawled, eyes glued to the five bills he had dropped next to the boxes.
And right then, in front of the ridiculously big Christmas tree in Harry's arms with a job in clear view and his cousin next door, Draco knew. He knew he had found his knight in shining armor. And maybe, Harry even found his angel.
So, with a lopsided smile, he stood up and slung his arms beneath Draco's body, easily picking him up bridal style and moving him onto the bed with one quick motion. Harry carefully placed the other men's legs so they wouldn't be in the way, before walking around the bed and lying down next to the blond. As he was already denying some wishes of his patient, Harry was ready to test his luck and carefully move his arm beneath Draco's head, so the blond lay more comfortable and could maybe even cuddle up to Harry. Even though the way Draco's whole body went still at his action made Harry wonder, if he didn't already cross a thick line.
The Ministry was, as always, filled with dozens of people, all rushing around and small enchanted paper planes flew around to deliver messages. The picture reminded Harry of third or fourth year, he could never tell when these things happened, when Malfoy blew a paper bird into his direction. It wasn't a plane like these, but it had a similar function. Back then, he was annoyed. Now, he wanted to see that cocky smile on Malfoy's lips again. Without the pain in his eyes.
A reporter caught eye of Harry, moving quickly into his direction. To avoid people to notice, The-Boy-Who-Lived pulled his hat down more and hurried into the other direction to the elevators. One of the doors stood open, so he quickly moved inside and the door closed behind him. Nothing more than a small breath of relief left Harry's lips, as he waited for the elevator to take him to his desired location.
"I know there are no dentists in the Magical World. But we could visit a Muggle dentist, if you'd like to. They can do a lot of stuff with your teeth when you have the right amount of money.", Harry explained softly, letting warm water flow over Malfoy's head for a moment. The blonde closed his eyes slowly, relaxing into the warmth of the water. Harry decided on washing the Slytherin's head first and giving him a chance to relax, before moving down to the rest of his body. So Harry grabbed a bottle of shampoo, irony hit him when the scent was that of green apples, and gave some of it on his hands. He then started on rubbing it into Malfoy's hair, beginning at the top of his head and moving down slowly to his neck, rubbing slow circles and massaging his scalp delicately. Malfoy's mouth hung open at the sensation of Harry's hands spoiling his head like that. Owing to the ragged breaths leaving Malfoy's mouth, Harry could have sworn the Slytherin would have moaned, if been able to.
How can people be so gruesome? How can a human being, which works, which has a family, probably even kids, hurt a defenseless man in such horrific ways. Harry did not kill a Dark Lord and did not die in the process, only for people to act how not even the darkest wizard of all time dared to.
Draco chuckled lightly, remembering the old woman telling him she would work long enough at the bakery to see him get equally beautiful children as he himself had been. "May I talk to her then?"
"You came to see me? Pray tell, is Draco Malfoy concerned about Harry Potter's well-being?", Harry teased, his eyebrows wriggling in anticipation.
The blonde nodded into his date's shoulder, slowly stepping back and throwing Harry a flushed smile. The Raven winked at him, lopsided smile on his own face as he moved the Harley into their driveway and shot a warning glance towards the window, where surely a man with equally black hair and glasses stood, grinning wildly at his son and waving. Harry rolled his eyes and gestured for the door, which was shortly after opened by a red haired woman wearing a beautiful green dress, behind her, the father bounced up and down, hair flying wildly as he did so.
"Explain to me why the Moony guy is chasing down the Padfoot... dog... for eating his chocolate... who even
"Well, you are behaving like a teenager with a crush and an anger problem.", Hermione stated, her voice strong and steady. Mione was the only person on this planet talking him down like that without being afraid. And Harry needed it.
"Did you vomit before after eating or drinking?"
"Harry? Are you a pirate?", he asked, voice nothing more than a shy whisper. His left eye shone with curiosity and fear.
Angela giggled in her melodic voice, a polite wave of her hand in Harry's direction made it look like he made the best joke of the century. "Oh Potter, you reelly 'on't kno'? 'Is fazer could probable tell your food favorite. Ze treacle tarte? C'est correct?"
Harry was sure this exact life flashed in front of Draco's eyes, the second his feet slipped on the wet wood and he cried out in agony. The young pirate reacted immediately and grabbed his arm with both hands, holding him tightly. With a small huff he pulled him back up and to the ship. The young boy was halfway drenched in freezing seawater, a shocked look on his perfect face. Lucius and Narcissa stared at them in terror as they reached the boat. But Draco stayed silent, trembling hand still in Harry's as he moved obly a little bit closer. Harry couldn't help but smile.
There was a moment where silver eyes just looked into emerald ones, up until Malfoy carefully moved his head to rest against Harry's chest. His hand still clung to the light blue robes, but the small action of trust sent a rush of ecstasy throughout his body. "Make the best of the moment you live in and don't worry too much about the future.", an advice Remus left Harry whenever he was close to a full moon. "The future is not planned yet, you yourself have the power to change whatever obstacle you might see when you live the moment in the best way possible." With that in mind, Harry pushed aside all of the thoughts concerning 'after Malfoy is healed' and concentrated on 'how can I help Malfoy the best right here and now'. He carried Malfoy into the big bathroom connected to the main room and sat him on a small chair, placed there to help the Healers with their tasks in cleaning a patient properly. The bathtub was formed so a person could sit upright and lay their head back on a small sink, where their hair was washed. It looked somewhat like a sink at a hairdresser's saloon, connected to a weird looking bathtub. But charms made the whole thing very comfortable, the hard material of the bathtub was charmed to feel like a big chair and the sink felt like a pillow, so it was ultimately perfect to relax and calm down.
"Oh shut it woman. Robards took it in for some inspections after I brought that Bradshaw guy in.", Ron explained, sitting down on a chair Hermione transfigured for him out of a plant standing on the window sill. "It was weird though. The guy didn't say a single word. He just let me arrest him as if he did nothing wrong. But, well, he obviously did. Maybe he just accepted his fate.", he continued, handing Harry one of the boxes and Draco a full can of soup. Indeed, the little fighting worried Harry as well, not as much as the way he had looked at Draco though. There was something wordlessly communicated between the two, it felt like a last promise or last order. Harry couldn't tell. But he was more than ready to find out. Surprisingly, Draco ignored the talking about Bradshaw, and instead threw Ron a suspicious glance after being handed the can, as if he might try to poison him. After not receiving any reaction from anyone, he carefully decided to try the soup. The way his face lit up was almost comical.
Harry laughed nervously, a hand rubbing the back of his neck. "Normally, I am. You make me nervous for some reason."
"Is your plan to make me meet your parents with a hard on?", he whispered then, his hand curling around a hot nape and head tilting to side, giving Harry more room to work his wonders.
"Draco. There is no need to be afraid.", he whispered, fingers tracing the sharp and high cheekbones of the older. "You might think you look terrifying. You might think you look ugly and disgusting. But I don't care.", grey eyes met green, uncertain of the truth behind their intensity, "I don't bloody care Draco. You have been through so freaking much and all I do is being immensely proud of you. Your appearance is a part that we can get back to normal. It will take some months, maybe years, but we will get there. Your heart changed though. I mean, don't get me wrong, you are still the bloody git from school. But now, you are a bloody git I really, really want to get to know better.", a shy laugh left Harry's lips, black locks blocking his view for a second before he managed to throw them back. "What do you think? Can we be friends?", the Healer asked, hand held out for Draco to take.
"I'm so glad you don't think I'm crazy. I just saw it and... thought of you? You are just so elegant and posh, you would look great in this stuff."
"Is that how being in love feels like?", he whispered, eyes searching the emerald greens of his opposite. Ha, he finally remembered the crystal's name.
"You came.", he whispered, tracing his fingertips over the high cheekbones of the man he loved from the bottom of his heart.
"You, Sir, are wasting my time! I need to work, god dammit! I need money, if you haven't already realized,
Even with his sleepy mind Harry realized how weird this comment was. Malfoy talked about him? And from what he said this women expected him to be happy about Harry being his Healer? Honestly, Harry was quite sure of Malfoy hexing him as soon as he tells him about some of the treatments they have to go through. And as soon as he got his voice back he would tell Harry off for not helping him out of Azkaban and whatsoever. He was just weak from starving and all the pain, so he didn't complain as long as he got better.
Harry might have imagined the tension running through Malfoy's body, though it was quite foreseeable. He would have reacted the same way. Still, the Healer didn't want to distress his patient.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Oh he is practically married to our Captain. We don't really care. One can be whatever they want, we go with it."
?", Draco shot at him with more force in his voice than necessary. It almost sounded furious. Harry winced, his dark skin tainted red on his cheeks.
"What she said.", she added, leaning back against a counter in the potions-section.
Harry honestly thought it was quite obvious, but instead of questioning his coworker's eyesight he simply nodded.
Harry answered with a small snort, before giving Draco a careful squeeze to warn him of his following joke. "Something in the mirror must have really insulted Draco. I am pretty sure it's the hair. He almost looks like Lucius on that ugly yearbook picture."
A shaky laugh escaped Harry, his big hand running through the mess of black hair on his head. "No wife. Let's not make things up, I would be a horrible husband. I would be quite happy to have some company over Christmas... it's lonely here... Draco,
"Would you like to know something about being a pirate?"
It did take Harry a few seconds before he realized the hidden insult. If it even was there. There was a lot of room to interpret a snort. Maybe too much room for Harry's muttered  to be appropriate, still, the other let out one of his signature smirks. It really had been his intention to give back some snide remark, even if he couldn't talk. The fact that Harry actually understood him was sort of scary.
"Stay here for a second, I'll talk to them real quick. Then you can go back to your Mum and Dad, does that sound alright?" Draco nodded slowly, hope building visibly. The boy must have thought they'd kill them, hurt them in every way possible and him probably right after. But Harry wouldn't make this boy suffer for the simple reason of revenge and greed and he definitely wouldn't make this boy an orphan like himself. With these thoughts in mind he ran back to the other room, pushing through the lot of pirates surrounding the married couple. Blood already covered Lucius sleeping shirt, all from small cuts and one deeper wound at his side. His face was swollen from punches, but it wasn't all too bad, only minor injuries. Mrs. Malfoy was crying in fear, clenching to her husband's arm and hiding behind the strong man. Nobody really touched her, for her being so fragile they feared she would break at a little cut. Harry immediately stepped in front of them, holding his arms out defensively to stop the men. Pettigrew and Remus looked at him with a questioning glance, the others only huffed.
Harry simply laughed at the reaction, for a matter of fact, the surgery on tonsils was one most Muggles did as infants or children. To see a grown man, who almost served death sentence in the deadliest prison on earth while being starved and paralyzed, reacting as if someone just told him they would cut his head off, was fairly good comedy.
"What time?", Draco answered, his voice a breathless whisper.
The thoughts about a present for Dobby remained prominent, even as the Malfoy heir finished dressing in very good fitting shorts, which made his legs look impossibly long, and a fitting green t-shirt to not leave him sweating in the unforgiving July sun. His father would have been horrified at the casual wear his son mostly chose to present himself in since he got older, but the older Malfoy carefully kept his mouth shut as Narcissa absolutely loved her son's change of style in comparison to his father. Lucius would never leave the house in anything less but a button down shirt and dress pants, but even that was a rare thing. The three piece suit was dressing of choice. Even when there was nothing more planned than a walk down the Seine, Draco wasn't surprised to see his father in a startling white suit with silver tie. As always, Lucius kept his expression carefully blank when bidding his son goodbye, but there still was a warmth to his eyes only Draco could differ. The boy hugged his mother once more, a brief kiss to her cheek before they apparated away, leaving Draco to smile to himself for a second. He loved his family.
"Stop this! There's a child in the other room and he's scared to his bones. We didn't plan on killing them either way. No more torture, you go and bring the stuff to the ship and I stay with Moony and Wormtail. We'll follow short after, but inform the Captain of the change.", Harry explained, relaxing at the pitiful looks on most of their faces. The crew wasn't heartless, nobody here wanted to hurt a child or traumatize it. So all of them left quickly, grabbing the bags full of gold and other things on their way. Pettigrew still pressed the cutlass to Lord Malfoy's throat, but he didn't look so filled with hate anymore. Remus pulled out a coat from a cabinet to his left and threw it at Lucius, signaling him to put it on.
"F-Forget what I said Harry.", she whispered, closing her eyes for a moment. "We should leave you alone. Madame Allard, would you like a coffee?"
It took the young healer several seconds to get out of his unconsciousness again. Ron had a look of serious concern on his face. "Harry, we go to Mungo's. You haven't had one of those for years. Mione will kill me if I don't bring you to the hospital after such an attack."
Anxiety and panic attacks;
Malfoy sent a death glare into his reaction, one of those combined with a full on sneer. Oh, how Harry had missed their bickering.
from the redhead.
"Well, I guess I can imagine you don't want to talk about it. After all it has barely been one day ago you were sitting in that cell. But... I thought you might feel better knowing how bloody great you have done. And that I'm really fucking proud of you.", Harry rambled, the tips of his ears growing more and more crimson by the second. Draco on the other hand didn't seem to really listen. His shoulders were clenched, his fingers fisted into Harry's jumper and his breathing was ragged. The Healer couldn't make out the reason for the stiffness though. For once in his life, Harry decided to use silence to observe the whole situation. Normally, he wasn't one to just look, but obviously Draco was not in a situation to acknowledge anything that was going on. Maybe he was in pain?
He hesitated, one second, two seconds. He heard his heart beating in his ears, blood rushing everywhere. He breathed. In, out. In, out. And he knelt down in front of Malfoy, one hand on his bare knee, the other wiping away tears. And with tears on his own cheeks he pulled Malfoy in for an embrace, strong and steady. Malfoy buried his face in the crook of Harry's neck, nails digging into midnight hair. "It's alright Malfoy. You're doing so good. Don't be afraid, I got you.", he whispered into Malfoy's ear, gently combing his fingers through thick knots of platinum blond hair. And like that they stayed, for how long, they both didn't know.
The Healer opened his mouth in disbelief, shocked about a stranger making fun of him for his appearance. Even though he may really look like a walking corpse, strangers never made fun of him. He was, after all, the Savior of the Wizarding World and quite a celebrity. People usually refrained from talking anything but polite to him, the only ones making fun were Ron and his coworkers. But this women definitely had some of Malfoy's attitude.
The winning grin on the blonde's face was worth an award to make in reasonable, as he squeezed Harry's buttocks slightly to underline his answer. "I don't fucking think so, but I am more than ready to try."
“I’m sorry,” He kept mumbling, over and over, till he could speak no more. He was exhausted, his body felt so heavy. Draco tried to move Harry a bit from his shirt, but Harry wouldn’t budge.

“Whatever Harry,” was Draco’s reply, before turning to his own breakfast scowling at his friend, still peeved that he had such a rude awakening. Of course it was just morning and he had all day to forgive Harry, but Draco would be getting him back for making a Malfoy act like such a fool in front of so many others.
The Doctor was shocked at first at the reaction he received, before jumping into action. He took Harry off the bed and sat the small wizard in his lap. With one arm, he restrained the other’s arms.

3. Hermione
Until next my lovelies!
“It’s such a nice place,” Harry’s voice was above a whisper unsure what he should say since he never talked to someone his own age. Dudley always made sure that while at school that Harry was always isolated, even the teachers seemed not to notice him that much.
The snake seized its opportunity to escape this place once and for all; but at the same time not wanting to leave this young boy, no young wizard by himself. The snake lowered itself to the ground just in time for the glass of make an appearance as he made its way over to Harry, “Thanksss” The snake said to the young wizard, but not wanting to stay to long.
Pansy eyes widened at what she just said. Meanwhile, Draco was already taking action, pushing his way to the head table as the other students pushed to get out of the hall.
“Good morning Harry!” Alec said taking the seat that Tom or Severus sat on during the night when he needed comforting. Harry just gave his head a nod not voicing a hello back to Alec, setting aside his journal and turned to face the dark headed man.
“Harry of course you’re allowed, if you weren’t, I wouldn’t have invited you.” Harry opened his mouth to reply, but closed it when a shuffle of feet indicated that someone had entered the common room. They turned and saw Gemma coming into the common room, dressed and ready for the day, but not quite awake yet.
It was eventful getting out of the shop. The two younger redheads thought that as soon as we left the store, they could harass us more, but it seems the magic I used to kick them out of the store also applied to me in general. It was like an invisible barrier kept them from entering a distance of 10ft around me; While others could freely walk in and around us, the other two Weasleys seemed to bounce off like flies. Of course, that didn’t keep their shouting from reaching our ears; I swear they were like part banshee, much like their mother. How did Arthur put up with that woman’s yelling?
“Can you please explain these coins? I am not sure how to use them.” Harry said, still in awe over the vast amount left for him, but confused because the wizarding world had such different money system then muggles did.
I really do hope you enjoyed this chapter <3 please please! Leave comments and kudos I love them and they help inspire what to write next. If you are shy send me and email at demondog136@yahoo.com and I will try to get back to you as soon as possible. Anyways much love to all you lovely readers, and I will see you in the next chapter or in the Discord chat!
I took one of his hands that automatically wrapped around my waist and pushed the goblet into it, so it would be easier for me to cut the palm of my hand. Once secured, I swiftly made a diagonal cut, letting the blood flow freely into the goblet; the knife was sharper than what I thought it would be and I might have cut a little too deeply, but all the same, the goblet was quickly filled.
Pain was all Harry knew in his life, whenever he didn’t do as the Dursley said he was severely reprimanded. Of course Harry always tried to do as he was told not being a fan of pain, but they always found a flaw in everything he did. If it wasn’t done to the “T” he would find himself locked his cupboard nursing his wounds till the next day. Oh how he wished something would happen to the Dursley’s sometimes, for how they treated him, he wished that he could do something, but what was a “freak” like him supposed to do?
Harry took a handful of the ash like powder from the pot Severus was holding, before taking a step into the fire place. Levi quickly wrapped himself around his young master so not to be left behind. “Malfoy Manor,” Harry said, before throwing the powder, his view of Severus was interrupted by the burst of bright emerald green flames, before he was pulled and twisted, then spat ungracefully into a new place.
“Draco, can you tell me more about Hogwarts?” Harry asked, wanting to know what it would be like, for he hasn’t been able to even fathom such a place. Draco did try to explain what Hogwarts looked like and even some of the different ghosts, but Harry wanted to know more about the place that he was going to spend a lot of time at.
It was the next morning that Harry confronted Severus about what happened the day before. Harry did not go into detail about everything that took place in the room, in fear that Severus would do something that everyone would regret. Instead he told him that, the professor would like to talk to them about extra lessons, since Harry seemed to advancing more quickly than other students. That evening, they found themselves outside the DADA classroom, poised and ready for a talk that would change everything. The professor opened the door to let them in, sending out warm greetings and a smile, even offering tea as the two others sat down in front of the professor’s desk. As soon as they sat down, wards went up, ones that prevented people listening in, ones that prevented anyone talking about what happened in the office, and ones that locked the door so that everything that needed to be said was said, and that no one could storm out of the room raving mad.

The healer held up a hand to keep me from demanding answers, “There is no need to worry lad, as we said there was some complications, but everything is resolved.” With a smile the healer looked at everyone in the room, “Would you guys like to step back in the room, with a promise not to cause trouble, and see everyone?”
Harry stuck his tongue out at the blonde, “no that was what you said would make a good strip tease, I know assless chaps are the way to go.”
I want to thank you guys (the readers) for all your amazing comments, for almost 300 kudos and for over 5000 views in just 5 chapters. This means the world to me, and I can't thank you enough for all the support :)
“Yes, now come on, we are running behind,” Severus said while casting a spell to shrink Harry’s stuff, “I want you to keep a firm grip on Neit, Levi you keep a good grip on Harry, and Harry whatever you do, do not let go.”
Severus had to hide the smile that tried to make its way to his face. “Well, two things really. One, I was wondering if you would like to restore eyesight to your left eye.”
It was a very awkward time, silently sipping the cocoa, staring listlessly into the fire and thinking back on the war and everything leading to this moment. It’s hard to tell who broke the thickening silence first but someone did.
,” Draco said, sensing the question upon his friend’s lips when he heard the gasp behind him.
“What are those?” Harry asked, trying to hide behind Severus, trying to get out of straying eyes of these strange creatures.
“No, we must thank you for bringing in Mr. Potter here, we have been trying to get ahold of him to take on his heirship and even his lordship since he came of age after the Triwizard tournament.”
“I need everyone to leave the room now!” I was scared as I felt Draco’s hand leave mine, his face ghost white as he was pushed out of the room. I had no idea what was going on I didn’t want to be left alone…
“No duh, Potter! Do you see a fucking door?!” Draco turned his venom eyes at Potter in rage. This was not how he wanted to spend his Christmas. Like, seriously, if he wanted to be locked in a room he would have gone home. But the icing on the cake was being trapped with Potter.
“Milly can you shrink these down for Harry over there?”
Draco groggily opened his eyes at the sudden movement, unhappy at being woken up. This had to be one of the best sleeps he had gotten since the start of the war, but he too quickly acted and tried to jolt away. He fell asleep cuddling Harry bloody Potter! He too had a blush on his pale checks thinking of what happened that lead up to them here.
“Don’t worry, I have plenty of clothes, and most of them are going to be thrown out here soon anyways since they are going out of style.” Draco said before deciding on a dark green, almost emerald robe that would go perfect with Harry’s eyes.
Draco smirked, knowing that his friend was getting tired of all the attention, but he was wondering why Harry was getting tired of it. It if it was him he would enjoy every second of it, but then again he didn’t grow up being a ghost, as Harry descried it.
The man was worried about the young boy, he had tried everything he could possibly think of, and yet three days after taking responsibility of the young one he still has not woken up. Here he was pacing in front of his fire place thinking of what to do, to ensure the safety of the boy. Of course the headmaster said that he had no idea of the goings inside that house, but he also seemed upset that the potions master had removed the small child from his relatives. The man took a heavy seat in the chair just before the fire, a glass of brandy sitting beside him that he had been nursing for most of the night. He had his head in his hands when the fire before him turned an emerald green and a blonde male took a step into the parlor.
The smile quickly left the boy’s face as he knew that he did something freaky, something that he would truly be punished for.

“W-“, Harry tried to talk but his voice cracked and his throat was so dry that he ended up in a coughing fit. The man helped Harry sit up patting his back until the fit passed. He then held a glass to his lips. “Drink a little bit, that should help.” Harry did as he was told, the liquid, he found out, was just some ice water, and greedily guzzled it down, to sooth his dry. angry throat. The glass was empty and removed before Harry once again turned his attention back to the man that has been helping him, “W-who are you?” His voice was scratchy from the lack of use, but the water had helped in allowing him to speak.
“You really need to do something about your exit of the floo.”
“Call me Harry, I mean we aren’t in school anymore and with how close we’ve been this year I think you have every right to call me by my name.”
With that out of the way I do hope that this is fine with you guys, and I do hope that you keep reading! A shout out to my beta once more for reading over this! Enough of this I will let you go on to reading!
Levi chuckled from somewhere in the back of the boys mind,
To say that he was mad was a lie, he was more curious of why the younger wizard had done something so peculiar.
Draco ran up to the Head Table, making his way up to his Head of House, grabbing the sleeve his robe. Severus spun around as he was going to making his out of the hall to help like every teacher was going to do. “Draco what are you doing up here? You are supposed to making your way to safety with the Prefects!” Draco tried to steady his shaking hands as he looked up at Severus.

Draco gave a small chuckle at what I said. “No worries, there are people who can’t make the floo trip, it has something to do with the inner ear, and balance. It mostly affects those who have or are prone to ear infections. Same can be said about apparition, those two ways of travel affect the inner ear way more than a broom ride. It just seems strange with how you ride a broom that it doesn’t affect you while up in the air,” Draco said, giving me a peck on the cheek. “I will make sure next time to have a potion on hand that helps with this sort of thing.”

Harry frowned “
Severus almost regretted this, “If I settle the squabble will you leave me in peace for the rest of the evening?”
Now on to the chapter!
Harry shivered at what Ollivander said, not sure on how he felt, that the murderer of his family, carried the brother of his wand. He thanked Ollivander and payed for the wand before stepping out of the shop, lost in the dark thoughts that now entered his mind because of what Ollivander had said. It was late now, and Severus and Lucius had joined back up with the group, it was then that they called it a day. With goodbyes said, they departed Diagon Alley, and returned home to see the treasures the trip had produced.
“Sev? C-can I know h-how everyone knows for sure that the D-dark L-lord killed my parents?” Harry asked the man, now relaxing a bit into the hug after the day he had. Severus tensed, why was the boy asking something like that? It was something the boy never asked about, at least not since Severus explained everything he could to the young boy.

I smiled, she had become a sort of spokesperson for lesser known magical creatures having caught a few on camera and writing stories about them. Sadly with this job she was a way traveling a lot, poor Neville he was always worrying about her, but he knows that he can’t stop her from doing what she loves.
Levi’s voice said, and Harry started doing just that, reminding himself that he was no longer at the Dursley’s.
Harry said, recalling the newspaper saying that is was empty,

Harry sorted through his thoughts of Christmas, or what is known as Yule in the wizarding world according to Draco. It was planned, recently, that Harry and Draco make a trip to Malfoy Manor where Harry would stay a couple of days before Severus joined them, from there they would start the arduous journey of adoption. Harry was both excited and scared, excited because this would be his first time he would have a family that would love him, but he feared that Severus would turn on him just like his Uncle did. Of course that was ridiculous to think of, since the older wizard went through the trouble of rescuing Harry from his relatives, but that didn’t stop the fear since that is all he has ever known of a home life.
