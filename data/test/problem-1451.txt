“So you’re trying to rope another wizard into the business?” Harry snorted, earning a heavy glare from Ron. The brunet would probably have been a little nicer if Ron didn’t choose his day off to come to his house and talk about business, “Okay. I’ll be serious now. What do you expect this guy to do?”
“That’s all in the past mate.” Ron stated firmly, “And ‘Mione has been telling me that you’ve changed. So why don’t we just move on from it?”
“Yeah. I’ll be able to get money from selling potions to apothecary’s, and writing books.” Draco answered, “Do you think that Severus would be willing to help me?”
“We have one of the area managers visiting tomorrow.” Draco explained, “I need to make sure that everything is okay before his visit.”
“You’re lucky that you’re my baby cousin or I would have probably hexed you by now.” Sirius groaned, “I guess we should get going.”
“I’m surprised you still haven’t asked me why I’m staying here.” Sirius grinned, “Could it be, that you actually like me?”
“Ah, young love. Do you remember when we were like that?” Sirius asked Remus, “Those were the days.”
“Moony.” Sirius greeted, there was a slight tremble in his voice but it wouldn’t have been noticeable to anyone else. Draco felt protective. From his previous talks with his cousin, he was aware of how Remus was still a sore topic. Draco couldn’t even imagine what Sirius was feeling now that he was actually face-to-face with the other wizard, “It has been a long time.”
“Please don’t.” Sirius groaned. Draco had no idea where the wizard was hiding. But maybe it was a good thing that he finally showed up, “Look I love you both. But that is not something I’d like to see. Ever.”
“Because I am your guardian,” Severus answered flatly. He was giving Harry a very careful look before he continued to talk. The problem with that was Severus was going to know immediately that he was not in the right mindset, “And I did adopt you. Are you drunk?”
“Thank you.” Ron thanked, “You’re really doing us a huge favour. We haven’t been able to get that much time to ourselves lately with our new jobs.”
“Thank you.” Draco thanked, “I know I don’t deserve your help. But I really appreciate you doing it anyway. Living as a Muggle isn’t actually as easy as I thought it was.”
“Well, I don’t really know how to bring the magic of a house back.” Harry responded, it was a curious concept. He never really had to deal with the magic of houses. Harry knew that Hogwarts was magical, but he didn’t consider the magic of every other wizarding house. He watched as Draco sat on the armchair and the fireplace lit up, “The house seems to like you?”
“I’m not doing much. I have a job interview later and after that, I’m going to try to clean up the place a bit more.”
“I’m far from perfect. That’s why you love me.” Draco grinned. It was moments like this that made Harry wonder if Draco was a mind reader of some sort. The blond always seemed to have the ability to say what was on Harry’s mind.
“I’m pregnant.” Pansy answered. Draco felt like the air had been knocked out of his body. What was up with his friends? But at least Blaise was in a relationship with the girl he knocked up. He had no idea what Pansy’s situation was, “It’s a Weasley.”
Draco wasn’t sure where Harry had gone, but it was nice to finally take a break from the pictures. A glass of wine was everything that he needed right now.
“How was I supposed to know that you would do something like this?” Harry questioned, “You told me you only really drink wine. So I wasn’t really expecting this you to go on the piss.”
“You fight dirty.” Claire complained, “I wasn’t planning on telling anyone. I mean you didn’t even have to tell me what you were going to do.”
“Why are you here?” Draco asked them both, “I haven’t finished the book yet, and I’m sure we haven’t arranged to meet up.”
“Well. Not all the time.” Blaise laughed, “Sometimes I’m my own wingman. I’m a charming Italian man with ridiculously good looks.”
“Guy. I found this little guy.” Sirius beamed, thrusting a kitten into Draco’s hands. It was an ebony cat with the clearest green eyes that Draco had ever seen. The blond was smitten straight away, “Harry, why are you looking at me like that?”
“Okay. Drake it is.” Draco agreed, he definitely did not want to get asked too many questions, “I guess I’ll see you around.”
“N- no. I was staring at your socks, not your feet.” Harry defended himself, “They just look really cosy.”
“Please come in.” Draco insisted, if he was going to get hexed, he’d rather it be inside, “Do you want anything to drink?”
“Of course, my shirt’s inside out. You almost gave me a heart attack.” Harry complained, he definitely did not know that his shirt was on inside out. It was annoying to think that Draco of all people would see him dishevelled like this. It was a hit to his ego, “The next time you call me, can you at least tell me what to expect.”
“Well, your name isn’t really common around here. So unless you want to explain the origin of your name all the time, I would stick to Drake.” Claire grinned, Muggles were definitely odd creatures.
“You’re not going to end up crying too are you?” Sirius teased, staring at Draco, “Oh dear Merlin, you are going to end up crying.”
“You must really care about her if you’re putting her needs above your own.” Draco smiled, “And I think you should let her decide for herself. Who’s this girl you’re pining for?”
“I don’t know Harry, this really isn’t the time to make movie references.” Blaise joked, “But yes, I have seen it. Why are you looking at me like that? It’s a classic! I’m Italian for goodness sake.”
“You know you can say you missed me too, father. It won’t make you any less of a patriarchal figure.” Draco snorted, this was probably the best time to confront his father about what was happening, “Now, can you tell me why you and mother agreed to let Harry Potter court me? Did you not think to contact me before agreeing to something so drastic?”
The tell-tale signs of someone apparating into the house made Draco bite his tongue, this conversation needed to be continued another time. Sirius Black’s beaming face appeared and it was obvious that there was update with Remus.
“Nope. But I’m all up for a brew.” Draco smiled, “You do know that your shirt is inside out, right?”
“Er. Hi?” Draco greeted awkwardly. He was sure he looked like a deer caught in headlights. But how else was he supposed to react to a sudden appearance?
“So what’s a mango lassi?” Draco asked curiously, and Harry couldn’t help but find his inquisitiveness quite adorable. This whole Muggle exploration thing was bringing out a side of Draco that Harry had never known about. And he rather liked it.
“Why do you want the Weasley’s to like me?” Draco asked, “Why are you working so hard on making other people like me?”
“Don’t let your mother hear that.” Sirius laughed, “But she was a crazy bat that one. And don’t tell your mother that I said that.”
“What guy?” Draco frowned, trying to catch sight of the guy Claire was talking about. He searched the café before his eyes fell on familiar green eyes, “Yes. I know him.”
“I know that you’re not completely comfortable being in the presence of Remus yet, but it should get better if we ease you into it.” Severus tried, “You were best friends and I’m sure it’s possible to get to that stage again.”
“You seriously need to give people a heads up when you’re planning on dropping by.” Sirius grinned, “And Draco. I swear to God if you use my name as a pun again, I will hurt you. It's not funny.”
“So the blond hasn’t made their way into your bed yet.” Ron noted, “You know what’s really weird? The blond kind of looks like the ferret. I didn’t know your type was prissy blonds.”
“Ha-ha very funny.” Draco snorted. It was a wonder why the wizard didn’t make that much of an effort every other day, but it was understandable in a way. Draco had been depressed before. He barely left his bed and it was an accomplishment for him to shower and brush his teeth on some days. He had a feeling that Sirius was fighting his own demons. Azkaban would destroy any wizard/witch’s mental mindset, “But you clean up pretty well for an old man.”
“Merlin. She was right.” Ron spluttered, “Y-you don’t need to do all that mushy stuff. It’s all behind us. I forgive you.”
“Yeah. I don’t mind at all.” Draco smiled, Teddy didn’t seem unsettled by him. So that was always a good sign, “Are his parents aware that I’m going to be watching him?”
“Don’t fret. I’m Draco.” The blond smiled, recoiling at the flash of the camera. He wasn’t expecting the pictures to be taken so soon. Harry stared at Draco sheepishly, rubbing the back of his head, “You’re lucky you’re cute.”
If Sirius had told him who his dream-mate was before this dinner Draco would have made sure that something like this would not have happened. The dinner hadn’t even started and it was already going to hell.
“And what’s that?” Ron queried, the redhead looked like he already knew where Harry was going with this. And that was good. If they were on the same page, it would be easier for Harry to get what he wanted, “What do you want?”
He let out a long sigh and debated on whether to wake Harry up or not. Draco turned his face to take a glimpse at Harry’s face. The brunet’s eyes were bruised. And that could only mean one thing. He hadn’t been sleeping well.
“I ran into Ron yesterday. He asked me if I could watch Teddy.” Draco explained, “He told me that he was a nuisance, but he hasn’t caused any problems. So I’m not entirely sure what he was talking about.”
“I know. Thank you for stating the obvious.” Draco snorted, stubbing out his cigarette and throwing it over the edge of the balcony. It was always funny when someone else pointed out that something was bad when they did it themselves. Hypocrites.
“My Godson. How very peculiar.” Sirius smiled, “This has always been a part of the Black family, my dear cousin. Not a well known secret and we would like to keep it that way. Can you imagine how many people would try to force their ways into our dreams? There is power in a name. Especially the Black name.”
Draco considered every one of his friends to be attractive. Pansy with her very chic look. Blaise with his very sophisticated fashionable style. They were all fashionable.
“Stop being so dramatic.” Narcissa laughed, “And I should probably let you know that we have invited Harry over for dinner. We originally thought that the two of you would be coming together.”
“Are you definite that it’s okay for me to go back there?” Harry questioned, “Ginny throws some nasty hexes, and I’m not sure I really want to deal with that right now.”
“Or maybe we could work on it. Like a different room every week?” Draco suggested, “But I refuse to have sex in the kitchen. That’s super unhygienic.”
“Can’t let anyone know what?” Harry asked, popping out of nowhere like normal. Harry finally took notice of Sirius, “Hey Sirius, I didn’t know you would be here.”
“Hermione’s punched me before.” Draco pointed out, “And I'm not sure if I should mention the bathroom incident.”
“You usual work morning shifts, don’t you?” Harry asked, “Does that mean that you’re going to be closing up?”
“In other words, you got bored and came here hoping that I would be the same.” Draco teased, “Are you going to stand there all day, or are you going to take a seat.”
“I can’t see myself starting a family with anyone else.” Ginny smiled, holding Blaise’s hand. Draco just felt like it was too soon. But maybe wars had this effect on people, “I wanted you to be the first person to know because you brought us together.”
“Are you just going to continue to stare at me and play with my hair the whole night?” Harry smiled bemused, one of the main features that Draco loved about Harry was his eyes, “Or are you going to tell me how much you love me?”
“Only if it was completely necessary.” Harry sighed, “I don’t go around beating people up, you know. And I am living a perfectly normal life. There’s only so much I can do, saving the wizarding world from Voldemort kind of acted against me.”
“That’s not it.” Draco admitted, “I’m not worried about you telling him. But yes. I figured it out.”
“It’s not like you would understand.” Harry snorted, earning a glare from his friend, “What? It’s not like you’ve ever dated anyone in the long run. Your longest relationship was with Hermione and that didn’t work out well.”
“You want to date me?” Harry asked, sounding way too surprised, and Draco couldn’t help but find it adorable, “I -I. Er. I guess you could ask me out?”
“Sure.” Draco smiled, pressing his lips against Harry’s own in a chaste kiss, “Yeah. It didn’t feel as weird as I thought it would.
“Harry, I didn’t know you were a regular visitor here.” Sirius said, Draco couldn’t help but snort at that. His cousin was well-aware of the fact that Harry liked to visit him. Everyone was aware of it, “Did you know that Draco can do wandless magic?”
“What. This can’t be happening.” Draco complained, “Can I just go. I don’t think I can deal with him so soon.”
“I am never drinking again.” Draco stated firmly, “My head is killing and everything is still spinning. I think I might be sick.”
“The dreams have stopped,” Draco repeated. He didn’t even realise that he had stopped seeing Harry in his dreams. In all fairness. Draco hadn’t really been sleeping considering the fact that he had found out that he was sharing them with someone, “I didn’t even notice that they stopped.”
“I’ll use that as my slogan.” Harry laughed, “I’ll leave you to it. I’ll now be taking pictures from a distance.”
“Are you seriously trying to tell me that you wouldn’t have tried to knock him out?” Draco questioned, “And this exactly what I’m talking about, you have this whole hero thing going on and I feel like you should try to ease into living a normal life.”
“You’re either asking for Blaise or Pansy.” Ginny guessed, “I don’t believe in the whole house rivalry thing. My best friend is a Ravenclaw. So, I wouldn’t mind dating a Slytherin. Just them to make sure that they ask me out.”
“Because I don’t think she’ll be interested in me.” Blaise answered, “And I’m a Slytherin. I don’t deserve a girl like that.”
“Nope. But I’m all up for a brew.” Draco smiled, “You do know that your shirt is inside out, right?”
Draco had now lived in his apartment for over a year. There were still some things that he still didn’t quite understand, like the way he always seemed to somehow lose a sock if he put them in the washing machine. The blond had learnt the hard way that sometimes it was better to hand wash clothes, so he usually washed his underwear and sock by hand, while the rest of his clothes were thrown into the washing machine. But that wasn’t something to think about right now.
“He knows.” Blaise cut in, Draco could not help but appreciate his friend. He knew that this was not going to be easy. Draco was raised with magic and he had no idea how he was going to live without it, “And if he really struggles, he can always contact Potter.”
going to fix this?” Draco smiled, he still wasn’t quite used to the fact that he and Harry were now a we. It wasn’t his dream anymore. This was his reality, “So what do you think we should do?”
“I’m quite definite. I mean his hair colour changed.” Draco grinned, “Maybe I’m just better with children.”
“Oh has he now? A friend of mine has mentioned your son in passing and I came across a picture of him. He’s a handsome fellow.” Harry smiled, so Draco hadn’t even told his parents that he was back in England. Maybe he could try and get Lucius’ approval to court Draco. That would make it easier to get in touch with the younger Malfoy, “I want to know more about him because I fancy him and I intend to court him.”
“W-what?” Draco spluttered, “You’re an idiot. Can you get this over and done with already. This is going to painful.”
“Ginny, what are you doing here?” Harry asked curiously, before turning to look at Blaise, “I wasn’t aware that you were friends.”
It took Harry a good few minutes for him to try to comprehend what Draco was saying. As soon as his ears and mind seemed to start working together, Harry shot straight out of bed.
“And once she told you about that, you remembered that you did meet someone through a dream a long time ago.” Draco smiled, “You eventually shared it with her, and you both came to the agreement that it wasn’t fair on the three of you if you remained married.”
“No. I think he would love it.” Severus let out a laugh, the older wizard had a feeling that the relationship between Harry and Draco would be perfectly fine. He was definite that they would compliment each other. They would be a powerful couple, “Harry if you ever feel like this again. Please call for me. I’ll always be here for you.”
“I had a feeling you weren’t.” Draco snorted, “You just ordered the first thing you saw, didn’t you?”
“No one even knows we’re dating. Wouldn’t it be weird for me to just move in without you telling the Weasley’s and your friends that we’re in a relationship?” Draco frowned, “Once you’re ready to tell your family and friends. Then maybe I’ll consider moving in with you.”
“Maybe we shouldn’t christen the house.” Harry said offhandedly, “I mean there are a lot of rooms in the house.”
“But you don’t have these socks.” Draco said firmly, stretching before slipping off the sofa. The blond disappeared for a few minutes before reappearing in the living room with a pair of red striped socks, “You can have these.”
Harry groaned as his phone continued to ring. He had no idea what time it was, but he definitely knew that it was stupid o’clock. He could just feel it in his bones. Harry’s hand groped aimlessly in the dark in search of his glasses. As soon as he found his eye-wear and popped them on his face, he peered at his phone.
“It’s a good idea.” Narcissa added, “Maybe it’ll help Draco with his potions. If he’s planning on selling to Apothecary’s, he’ll be knowledgeable about side effects and what not.”
“Because he hasn’t seen Remus in a while.” Draco pointed out, “That sounds like a man that’s running away from his problems. And I’m sure he’ll feel a lot better if he just talks to him.”
It took a moment for his parent's words to sink in. The knowing looks from everyone, Hermione, Sirius, and his parents. They all seemed to know something that he didn’t know. And now it made perfect sense. He finally understood what was going on.
“Andy. I’m supposed to be visiting with your area manager tomorrow.” The man supplied, “I own this business.”
“Can we not talk about this.” Harry groaned, blushing brightly. The tips of his ears were red and Draco thought it was adorable. Damn it. He just loved Harry ridiculously, “We don’t have a voyeuristic relationship in that sense.”
Draco ran over to Harry’s collapsed body and started incanting every healing spell he knew, anything to make sure that Harry would be okay.
“Because I like you.” Harry declared, “And I think it’s time that everyone else saw that you’re actually a likeable guy.”
“Really? She seemed fine when I saw her.” Ron said offhandedly, Draco was starting to like Ron. But if Ron was cheating on Hermione, Draco wasn’t going to be too happy, “I’ve been meaning to get her number, do you think that you can give it to me? I don’t think she’ll appreciate it if I try to floo her.”
“Do you remember what happened last time I came a little late?” Severus snorted, getting the dishes cleaned. The older wizard was a bit of a neat freak. But it wasn’t necessarily a bad thing. It just wasn’t something Harry was, “You drank through my entire fire-whiskey collection and got alcohol poisoning. It was one of the most terrifying experiences I had ever gone through and I don’t want a repeat.”
“I think you’re exactly what Hogwarts needs.” Luna smiled, “And I’ve been well. I would like it if we could meet up for tea sometimes.”
“Okay.” Draco sighed, “I’ll talk to Ron as soon as I can. But I’m going to need you to calm down. I’m sure it isn’t as bad as we think it is.”
“Wait. If you didn’t figure out that Harry is in love with you, then what did you figure out?” Hermione frowned, seemingly confused by how the conversation was going.
“Shall we go to bed?” Draco asked. He knew how he sounded. But he just hoped Harry wouldn’t take it the wrong way. It would probably ruin everything, “Or you could go home.”
If you asked Draco Malfoy where he thought he would have been ten years ago, it definitely wouldn’t have been where he currently was. He was renting a shitty apartment with a girl he had met through work. They had both worked part-time positions in a café and somehow formed a friendship through their love of books and being generally awful people. If his parents could see him now, they would be scandalised.
“Can we not talk about this?” Draco asked. He didn’t like the conversation. The idea of Harry dying twisted his chest painfully, “So tell me what’s going on with you? You haven’t mentioned any women or men for a while.”
“That’s Harry Potter.” Blaise smiled all-knowingly, “And he does work for me occasionally, so it’d be better for business if you didn’t shag him.”
“No one that gets hexed is happy.” Hermione teased, “So do you want to tell me what you’ve been doing? Everyone seems to think that you’re keeping secrets.”
It was the tell-tale signs of someone apparating into the house that made Draco’s eyes widen considerably. He had no idea how he was supposed to act.
“Really? I don’t know what I’m even supposed to say to that.” Harry laughed, “Are you sure that’s Teddy?”
“It’s not even messy.” Harry pointed out, also looking around the place. It was clean, too clean for a single man living by himself, “What job are you interviewing for? Is it somewhere near? Is the pay good?”
“My mother’s planning it. And it’ll be worse for us if we have a child out of wedlock.” Blaise answered, “We’re going to see Ginny’s family as soon as we’re done here.”
“No. I insist.” Ron grinned, well the redhead was going to get the shock of his life. It was better for them to get it out of the way now, rather than let it drag.
Can y'all say a little prayer for me or wish me luck because I am in need of a new job? My experience with work has been the worst.
“Harry. Can you do me a huge favour and watch Pan for me?” Draco asked curiously, “She’s going to be staying over for the night. But I need to make someone a quick visit.”
“What do you mean?” Harry queried, not completely understanding what Hermione was implying, “What’s going on?”
“I’ll see you around,” Harry said softly. He was in need of a haircut. Just a little trim, as it was a lot more unruly than usual, “Thank you.”
“I’m going to make some breakfast. Something to hopefully make you all feel a little better.” Harry snorted, “If you’re drinking make sure that you don’t mix different alcohols. You’re just going to feel like shit.”
“I am never drinking again.” Draco stated firmly, “My head is killing and everything is still woozy. I think I might be sick.”
“Does this have something to do with how Draco suddenly decided to live like a Muggle?” Hermione asked curiously, “Because I’m not entirely sure who else would willingly help him integrate into the Muggle world.”
“You’re absolutely shit-faced,” Harry stated, Draco’s eyes peered up at the brunet and he could not help but feel confused. The blond was almost definite that he did not invite Harry Potter to the housewarming party. It wasn’t that he hated the guy per se, he just didn’t want Potter to have to deal with Pansy or Blaise. His friends were crazy. If Draco occasionally felt like he needed to throttle them to behave, he had no idea how Harry would handle them.
“Don’t worry. Let me put that on your bedside table. You might get a little peckish later on.” Harry voiced, “I’ve got a house elf to just make sure that you guys don’t choke on your own puke and end up dying. But I’ll be back in the morning to check up on you.”
“I never did apologise for that,” Harry said sheepishly, it was one of the low points of his life. Something that he would probably never forget, “I threw up in your cauldron.”
“I won’t forget anything.” Draco promised, “As soon as I’m ready to come back to the wizarding world, I’m actually hoping to become a potions master.”
“I don’t know if I should tell you.” Blaise started, Draco couldn’t help the stern look he gave his friend. If Blaise got to know everything about Draco, then Draco should also know everything about Blaise, “Okay. Don’t laugh. But it’s Ginny Weasley.”
“Of course.” Lucius agreed, giving Draco a knowing look. Draco was tired of all these looks now that he finally knew what they meant, “So Harry, how do you feel about chicken. Draco’s always been so particular about his meat.”
“Fucking hell. ‘Mione was right. You really do have it bad for Draco.” Ron frowned, “Can you at least let this blond down nicely? I mean I wouldn’t want to explain to them that you’re using them because they remind you of someone else.”
“I always thought you had a bit of a thing for him.” Ron frowned, “But thankfully he wouldn’t look at you twice.”
“Fried eggs, bangers, and beans,” Draco answered flatly, it sounded like a pretty heavy breakfast for 3am. But Harry was not going to judge him, “With buttered toast.”
“I never really ever found out what happened to Harry Potter after his parents passed away.” Draco admitted, changing the subject. It was a good opportunity to find out more about Harry from someone that he actually knew, “I’m assuming that you managed to adopt him?”
“Okay. So are there any allergies that I need to know about?” Draco continued, “Does he have set sleeping times? What is he not allowed to eat? What does he not like eating? Is-“
“So that’s why you’ve been avoiding the Weasleys.” Hermione sighed, “No one is angry with you. Even Ginny isn’t angry with you. Sometimes things like this happen. That’s how life works.”
“Hey.” Harry greeted, taking the seat opposite of him, “As you’re so insistent on living as a Muggle, I decided to pick out some sweets for you.”
“I guess we are.” Draco beamed, kissing Harry’s lips. He absolutely adored him, “Let’s this get out the way?”
It was always weird to think about how messed up everyone’s lives were because of Voldemort. And now that he was gone, they would finally be able to live the lives that they had always wanted to live.
“I know.” Harry smiled. He loved his little family. He wouldn’t trade Severus, Sirius, or Remus. They raised him to be the person he was today and he would always respect that, “Thank you for coming here at the drop of a hat. I really appreciate it.”
The latte Draco gave him did not taste like coffee at all, it was almost as if he was drinking a hot chocolate that had a little hint of the coffee flavour. But it was odd because it had a fruity taste to it as well. It was a pretty unique flavour.
“I actually have no idea what he’s talking about.” Harry said sheepishly, “But I can confirm that he did talk to Remus.”
“So where did it go wrong? What happened that made you think that it wouldn’t be possible?” Draco asked curiously, “What aren’t you telling me?”
“You’ve always been ambitious. I’m glad to see that hasn’t changed.” Sirius laughed, “So your parents have also told me that you refuse to move back to the manor and that you are currently looking for a place to stay. How would you feel about moving in with your cousin?”
“You’re dating someone! Admit it!” Pansy screeched, “There’s no other reason you would put a book down. You’re the type of guy that doesn’t put a book down for anyone.”
“I am so sorry. I believe I have the wrong person.” Draco blushed, hanging up the phone. He stared at the phone and looked at the number that he dialled and the number that he was given. It took him a few minutes to realise that he had actually typed in a six instead of a nine. The idea unnerved him. The fact that one mistake meant that you would end up calling a completely different person was daunting. He tried again, this time triple checking that the number that he had typed was actually identical to the one on the paper. As the dial tone continued, Draco’s heart sank further into his stomach and he was almost tempted to hang up. But then the other person on the other side of the line decided to pick up.
“You haven’t started a fire again have you?” Harry queried, looking for his shirt. He didn’t want a repeat of last time where he showed up without a shirt and left with a nasty burn.
“What were you going to use it for?” Harry questioned curiously, “If you didn’t know what to do with it, why did you and Blaise decide to try it out?”
“You’re the first person that has told me that.” Harry commented, “You’re basically telling me it’s okay to be selfish.”
“He’s not my friend.” Draco said softly, earning an incredulous look from Harry, “H-he’s my boyfriend.”
“Aw geez. You made him all sappy.” Sirius teased, wrapping an arm around his younger cousin, “Don’t forget that Harry has three fathers and we will all end you.”
“No. We ran into each other at the Leaky Cauldron.” Ron frowned, “Why would you think that Draco had anything to do with it?”
“Er. Why is Ron here?” Harry asked, looking at Pansy, Ron, and Draco, “Wait. Is Ron the reason Pansy’s so upset?”
“Okay. I’ll be there in a second.” Harry responded, finally finding a shirt to throw on. As soon as he apparated to Draco’s place he looked at the blond in confusion. Nothing seemed to be amiss, “Okay. So what am I missing? Nothing seems to be on fire.”
“Well. I’m sorry for trying to be a good partner and actually helping you with cleaning duties.” Harry snorted, earning a little laugh from Draco, “I thought you were raised with house-elves? Does that not mean that you should be pretty shit at cleaning and cooking? I was a little shocked when I found out you could actually take care of yourself when it came to things that weren’t Muggle.”
The day had started off pretty normal, he had bought all the necessary foods and drinks for a party. But he did not even consider the fact that Pansy and Blaise would also bring alcohol. And it didn’t help that Harry bloody Potter had purchased quite an array of Muggle alcoholic drinks for him to try. His apartment had enough alcohol to satiate a small town. It was a surprise that they were not dead considering the amount of alcohol they consumed.
“There are plenty of people that don’t like you.” Draco pointed out, “You can be such a plonker sometimes.”
“What if I’m not good enough for him?” Harry asked Severus, “What if it burns out and I’m left in the ashes?”
“Why are you eating toast this early?” Harry asked, trying to catch his breath from laughing so hard, “Jesus. That dial thing on the side of the toaster. Make sure it’s not at the highest, go for the second or third number to have your bread toasted.”
“Why are you eating toast this early?” Harry asked, trying to catch his breath from laughing so hard, “Jesus. That dial thing on the side of the toaster. Make sure it’s not at the highest, go for the second or third number to have your bread slightly toasted.”
“Harry is perfectly fine with chicken.” Draco sighed, “I think it was kind of unnecessary that you had to bring up the whole food intolerance thing.”
“I’m going to spruce it up. Don’t tell anyone.” Draco stated sternly, “Because I will tell Tom that you’re the one who keeps eating the croissants.”
“You do have a pretty face.” Ginny agreed, “But what did you want to see me about? You’re not the type of person that would drop by for a friendly visit.”
“Can I talk or are you still going to kick me out?” Harry asked curiously. Draco rolled his eyes at the comment. Harry just beamed at him in response to his annoyance, “I’ll take that as a no. But we’re going to have to start with your parents and my guardians.”
Harry turned the dial to the toaster, to the lowest and watched as the bread pitifully jumped out of the machine. It was clearly a little too late as there was no way to salvage it.
It took Harry a few minutes to realise that Draco was probably still stuck in his wardrobe and probably heard everything that Ron said. Harry cautiously walked to the closet, opening it. And of course, giving Draco the invisibility cloak, meant that Harry couldn’t see him at all.
“Follow me.” Draco smiled, “I should probably get you a toothbrush, do you need to borrow some clothes?”
“Actually there were plenty of bonds between different houses. I think it’s just a pure-blood thing.” Hermione said offhandedly, and Draco couldn’t help but agree with it. He had seen so many inter-house relationships, “But I’m glad we were finally able to put a stop to it.”
“You’re really violent.” Harry noted, “I’m not the type of person to complain about free food. Do you want me to bring wine? Your mother gave me a crate.”
After catching up with the blond in the short amount of time his break was, Harry felt a little better. It was good to know that Draco was doing good. It was also good to know that he still wanted his help.
“I don’t think Blaise’s pride would have been able to handle it.” Draco commented, “I don’t think I’ll see him for a while. He was rather embarrassed”
“A single shot? Or double?” Draco queried, getting the cup out of the dispenser, “Do you want anything else with the order?”
“Well. I think it’s a bit of a lost cause.” Draco snorted, indicating around the house, “Don’t worry. I’ll sort it out. It’s a surprise Harry doesn’t just use magic. It would make life a lot easier.”
“So are you going to tell me how you got into my dreams?” Harry asked, glancing at the blond’s lips. Damn it. Harry wanted to have a taste, “What kind of sorcery are you doing?”
“It’s nothing to do with your current living arrangements.” Draco sighed, “And you can stay here as long as you need to.”
That’s why Draco had to pull Harry off of the guy. If he had it his way, Draco would have let Harry continue to beat the shit out of Andy. But he didn’t want Harry to get arrested.
“Can we not talk about this?” Draco asked, wanting to change the subject. This was not something that he wanted to talk about. He just wanted to leave everything that had happened in the past. This was supposed to be a fresh start. A new beginning where he would not have to think about anything and could just start again. Maybe he should not have contacted Harry. Maybe he should have just moved to another country like everyone else.
“My father renounced Voldemort?” Draco asked, he had left as soon as all charges were lifted off him. He didn’t have any clue as to what was going on in the Wizarding world. And his parents decided that it would be best to just talk about everyday things.
“I would like to see that very much,” Pansy said offhandedly, Draco couldn’t help but laugh at that. Of course, Pansy would be blunt about that sort of thing, “I think it would kind of be hot.”
“I just thought I would pop in and say hi.” Harry said, “I haven’t seen you in a while and I just wanted to make sure you were okay. You haven’t been having any troubles with anything have you?”
“Actually, it was within minutes of meeting you. Lucius Malfoy ran into me when you decided to apparate off without agreeing to have a conversation with me.” Harry corrected. The brunet was going to do everything in his power to make sure that Draco would not get away from him this time around. The dreams continued, but Harry wanted this to be a part of his reality, “Your parents have invited me to Malfoy Manor to discuss courting arrangements.”
“Everything’s spinning.” Draco groaned, tried standing up only to stumble back down on his arse. Harry looked at him with a bemused expression, “I can’t make it stop.”
“We have to talk about this,” Harry yelled out after him. Watching Draco walk away. The blond didn’t even bother turning to look at him before he apparated. He made it look so smooth. Harry couldn’t help but feel pissed off. They were going to talk about this one way or another. The brunet would follow him to the ends of the world if he had to, “Shit.”
“Oh. You’ve got most of it right.” Harry smiled, before clicking a switch, Draco withheld the temptation to tell Harry not to touch the switch because he still had no idea what it did. But as the kettle spurred into life, Draco stared at it curiously. Muggles were confusing. And to think that he mocked their lifestyle previously, “So you see the switch? It makes sure that electricity is transferred to whatever you're using.”
“He’s trying to hide something. I’m not entirely sure what though.” Draco snorted. He had been thinking over the last few days how Harry always looked at him like a deer caught in headlights and it didn’t worry him, but he just wondered what the wizard was trying to hide from him. Draco was definite that Harry wasn’t cheating on him, so that wasn’t really something he would even consider. But that probably meant that Harry did something he felt guilty about. Like, break a plate or a family heirloom. Or maybe it was something to do with Draco’s birthday coming up. Harry often insisted on throwing surprise parties, “I know he’s not cheating on me, but I’m just wondering if he’s broken another family heirloom. He should know by now that magic can basically repair everything.”
“It’s okay.” Draco laughed, “What is up with you Gryffindors in hitting me in the face? You know that’s my selling point, right?”
“I thought you weren’t easy?” Harry smiled, pulling Draco into his arms. It was comfortable. Something that felt right, “So you never did tell me how you stopped the dreams.”
“Sorry. We can change the subject, but only if you promise me that you won’t continue to beat yourself up.” Harry stressed, “This is a new start. You need to accept the past and not run away from it.”
“I’m not going to bother Potter.” Draco frowned, crossing his arms. He was uncomfortable with the idea of relying on Harry for help, “He’s done enough as it is.”
“What do you mean you messed up? Are you pregnant? Do you have an STD? There are potions that can help.” Draco said softly, petting her hair, “It’s not the end of the world.”
“I- I’m not drinking. I have a kidney infection and my Healer told me that I won’t be able to drink for a while.” Pansy sighed, Draco admired Pansy’s lying abilities, but he was definite that Harry was going to figure it out at some point tonight.
“The key word in that phrase is elders.” Draco grinned. It was always fun to annoy people, “If you’re older than me, you’re an old man.”
“Okay. I’ll be there in a second.” Harry responded, finally finding a shirt to throw on. As soon as he apparated to Draco’s place he looked at the blond in confusion. Nothing seemed to be amiss, “Okay. So what am I missing? Nothing seems to be on fire.”
“Teddy. I’m babysitting Teddy. There are a lot of blonds out there that aren't my children.” Draco answered, “Now. Instead of acting all weird, why don’t you just sit down.”
“Of course, you’re the one that was dallying about.” Ron snorted, earning an incredulous look from the blond. It was a known fact that Ron was the one that usually tried avoiding events like the plague. And Draco didn’t blame him. The blond hated them too, “Don’t give me that look mate.”
“Cissy darling, I think Draco is right to try to experiment.” Lucius smiled, “If we were all to suddenly lose our magic, Draco would be able to teach us how to survive.”
“Calm down. I’m ready.” Sirius snorted. Now he understood what his mother meant when she had told him that his cousin was a heartbreaker. It was the leather jacket that caused the heartbreaking. It was so bizarre to think that a leather jacket over a simple grey shirt and black jeans would make someone a hell of a lot more attractive, “Close your mouth, you’re going to let all the flies in.”
But the only problem was that Hogwarts brought up a completely different side to them, their personalities were awful. Draco had a feeling it was to do with the fact that Slytherins didn’t really fit into Hogwarts. They were automatically labelled as the evil house and they were alienated from the rest of the school. It was a rather awful experience.
“It was just a punch.” Draco snorted, “You, on the other hand, looked like you were going to kill him.”
“Can we not talk about this?” Draco asked, wanting to change the subject. This wasn’t something that he wanted to talk about. He just wanted to leave everything that had happened in the past. This was supposed to be a fresh start. A new beginning where he wouldn’t have to think about anything and could just start again. Maybe he shouldn’t have contacted Harry. Maybe he should have just moved to another country like everyone else.
“And I thought Hermione was bad with book references.” Harry laughed. He could deal with Cathy, it was definitely better than Cat. He kind of liked it, “But I like it. Cathy.”
“I’m sorry for assuming.” Draco smiled, this made things better. But it still wasn’t entirely great that Pansy was pregnant, “Ron. I think you need to contact Pansy. As soon as you can. Because she made the same assumption as I did and she’s rather distraught.”
“Enjoy your last days of freedom.” Claire laughed, in turn making Draco snort. Muggles had a strange sense of humour, but Draco could definitely get behind it, “Have fun!”
“You do understand what you are asking?” Lucius smiled, he didn’t seem too opposed to the idea and that was always a good sign, “Courting is rather complicated and you will have to get approval from both parents.”
“Why waste the time?” Draco asked rhetorically, “It takes less time for you to just apparate here and see for yourself.”
“That’s our cue to leave. We have a honeymoon to get to.” Draco laughed, “And a lot of sex to be had.”
“Sure. Why the hell not. It’s not like you even go to work.” Ron pointed out, “You call in sick the majority of the time or come up with some excuse to not come in.”
“Christening the house? What does that even mean?” Draco frowned, “Is it some religious thing? Harry, I'm not a Christian.”
“It’s nothing.” Hermione assured him, “But you do look a lot healthier now, have you been sleeping better?”
“Not talking about it is going to ruin everything.” Ron pointed out, “You’re going to both have to confront it, that way you can move forward with it.”
“Harry, that’s not the problem here. It was pure luck, anything could have gone wrong.” Draco explained, “I’m not a trained healer.”
“That’s why I’m here.” Hermione smiled, “I was hoping that after you finished with those books, we could talk about them.”
“We’re exactly the same as we always were.” Remus snorted, “And we’re not that old. Wait until we get to the same age Dumbledore was.”
“I swear. There’s something about those Weasleys.” Draco said offhandedly, “I mean it can’t be a coincidence. Pansy and Blaise are going to have children around the same time. They might even go to Hogwarts together.”
“No. I think he’s a shut-in like you.” Draco sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. This was going to be a lot harder than he expected. He wasn’t even supposed to be in England this long. The blond would have to contact his secretary and tell her that they would have to relocate here. This was going to take time and Draco wasn’t going to let his business suffer in the long run,  “It looks like I have two wizards to work on. This is going to be eventful.”
“Severus dear, can you please show Sirius the wine cellar? My dear cousin had a recommendation but I, unfortunately, can’t remember the make or year of the bottle.” Narcissa smiled, “And Draco. Can you follow? I don’t want Sirius to get a hold of my other wines.”
“Of course mother.” Draco agreed, Harry was looking at him curiously. It was clear that there was something going on. Sirius didn’t look so good. Draco would have to explain what was going on to Harry later, but right now he had to make sure that his cousin was okay. Maybe having the dinner today wasn’t such a good idea, “I remember what happened last time.”
“Are you okay? You never used to care about changing in front of me.” Ron pointed out, walking into his room. The redhead stared at Harry in a way that suggested that he was trying to figure him out, “Does this by any chance have to do with that blond you’ve been pictured with?”
“Ron and Hermione are supposed to be babysitting him tonight.” Harry voiced, “How did you end up babysitting him?”
The blond was glad. But he had this nagging feeling that Harry had something to do with it. He was almost definite that the other wizard had done something.
“It wasn’t about Voldemort. It was about Blaise and Pansy.” Harry started, earning a curious look from Draco, “It’s not what you’re thinking.”
“Draco, it’s nice to see you.” Luna smiled, “I didn’t get the chance to talk to you at Ginny’s wedding. But I was hoping that you would be okay to talk now?”
“Why do I feel like I’m in trouble?” Harry frowned, “The nurse did just say that you did everything perfectly fine.”
“Why waste the time?” Draco asked rhetorically, “It takes less time for you to just apparate here and see for yourself.”
“There’s paracetamol and water on the table.” Harry laughed, “That might help you a little bit. But I’m afraid you’ll probably be in bed most of the day.”
“What the fuck? Draco why is the dishwasher full?” Harry frowned, staring into the dishwasher. The majority of the plates looked surprisingly clean. He was sure that he had just loaded the machine, “Are all these dishes dirty?”
“Excuse you. That’s not a choice that you can make for me.” Sirius frowned. Draco just looked at the older wizard, and Sirius couldn’t help but feel like his cousin was probably going to embarrass him, “I can have sex in my own house.”
“H- hello. Who is this?” An elderly woman responded, and Draco was definite that the owner of the voice was not Harry. For one thing, Harry was not an elderly lady.
Draco couldn’t wait to start this new journey with Harry. This was something that he had never thought would happen in his lifetime, and he couldn’t help but feel grateful that he was blessed with the presence of Harry. Everything was going to different. They were going to eventually start their own family as well as face many other challenges. It was a very welcoming change, and Draco wouldn’t want to do it with anyone else.
When he was sober enough, he was going to murder Pansy and Blaise. It was their fault he was in this state. Draco was not even sure if he had experienced being this drunk in his lifetime.
“Oh thank Merlin.” Harry breathed, kissing Draco firmly, “If you tell anyone, I’m sure that they would enjoy the fact that you don’t entirely speak English either.”
“As funny as that is.” Harry started, “Please call me if you’re not sure how to use something. Something bad could have happened.”
“TMI.” Sirius groaned, in turn making the wedded couple laugh, “I don’t need to be hearing anything about your sex lives. Ever.”
“Harry? Are you okay?” Draco questioned sleepily. The blond looked up at him with bleary eyes and Harry was immediately smitten.
“Because you would have rejected it vehemently.” Blaise answered flatly, “We know you well enough to not get involved when it’s not necessary.”
He was suffering from a bad case of vertigo. It was this moment that made him remember why he withheld throwing a housewarming party to begin with. Slytherins were ruthless when it came to partying. Everything was done in excess.
“Claire? Of course not, she won’t stop eating the bloody croissants.” Draco complained, “Why would you think that I would want to date her?”
“Now Harry, how on earth am I supposed to know that?” Draco snorted, “I can assure you that Blaise will not knock Ginny up out of wedlock. They still probably have a couple of years until they even start to think about children.”
“What makes you think that’s something’s going on?” Harry asked, taking a seat. This was going to be an eventful conversation, “Why did you never fully adopt me? Why did you act as my guardian?”
“Fine. She has a promising career ahead of her, and if someone were to find out that she was even talking to me, well all of that hard work that she put in would go straight to hell.” Blaise corrected, “I am not going to ruin it for her.”
“That’s only if the other party is difficult.” Lucius snorted,  “But I will discuss it with my wife. I will send you a letter and I will also have to address one to my estranged son.”
“Well if it’s any consolation, I definitely did not like Andy.” Draco said firmly, “The only reason I agreed to go on a date with him was that he was kind of charming, But there was no connection. I didn’t enjoy the date and we didn’t have anything in common.”
“I can’t impose on you like that.” Harry said shyly, “I already feel bad for dropping in unannounced today.”
The blond smiled as he popped the croissant and latte in front of Harry, the brunet looked a little confused at the croissant.
“You can use it to clean places that you can’t reach or even your drapes.” Harry explained, “Wait. How have you cleaned your place for the last few months?”
“This is surprising even for me.” Lucius admitted, “I was almost definite that you two were in a relationship. I thought that he was courting you.”
“Shit. Are you okay?” Harry asked Draco, tilting his chin to take a look at his face. The blond probably had a bruise forming. He was always one to easily bruise. Something to do with pale skin and his genetics. He really didn't know why, and he didn't really care at the moment.
“Can you shut up.” Draco groaned, “And the both of you out. I want to enjoy my first day here alone.”
The sound of someone apparating into his apartment almost gave him a heart attack. The blond wasn’t used to people suddenly appearing whenever they pleased and the sight of Harry Potter in a pair of pyjama pants and a comfy looking shirt was unsettling. Unsettling enough to make his mouth drop.
“Well. Isn’t this a surprise.” Fred laughed, “I don’t think I’ve ever seen Harry react like this to anyone. Have you two met before?”
“No. The only way we can try to move on from this is if we confront it.” Draco stated, “What I did was not right. And I will accept it completely if you don’t forgive me for it. But I just need you to know that I am truly sorry.”
“I didn’t do anything special.” Draco frowned, “Do you happen to know what to do? I mean I do love kids, but he can’t stay here.”
“Yes. We had sex and now I’m pregnant. Can we move on from that?” Ginny laughed, “Draco. I wanted to tell you first because we want you to be the Godfather. Luna’s already agreed to be the Godmother.”
“Erm... All the types of bread are good, but I personally prefer naan.” Harry offered, “But you have plenty of time to try all the others someday.”
“Of course, my shirt’s inside out. You almost gave me a damned heart attack.” Harry complained, he definitely did not know that his shirt was on inside out, but he wasn't going to let Draco know that, “The next time you call me, can you at least tell me what to expect.”
“Yes. Go to a fitting, wear something that would look good on you.” Ron sighed, “Tomorrow morning. Eight am sharp.”
“Don’t worry Sirius. I don’t think I’d even be able to get it up with you in the room.” Draco grinned, earning a loud groan from Harry, “But it’s nice that you’ve finally made an appearance. You and I need to talk.”
“You’re not dating?” Narcissa repeated, her eyes widening considerably, “The way the two of you look at each other. It’s like you’re both in your own world.”
“I will do.” Draco grinned, “He’s worried about ruining your Quidditch career with his name and status.”
“Draco? Are you okay?” Harry asked. The fact that Harry knew it was him straight away confused him. It made no sense for the spectacled wizard to know it was him.
“But you were disowned too, does that not mean that you should not have experienced them either?” Draco frowned, he had no idea how this thing worked. But if he were to start a family with Harry he needed to have some kind of idea as to how he was going to tell their children about this, “Are you definite that those who are disowned will not experience the dreams?”
“The joys of having seven brothers.” Ginny said offhandedly, and Draco took note of how she seemed to add an extra person. Which could only mean that she considered Harry to be similar to an older brother? The blond almost let out a sigh of relief before stopping himself. He didn’t want to draw any attention to himself, “Harry. I’m going to tell everyone soon. I just wanted to tell Draco something.”
“I might have to do that.” Draco agreed, “It’s not that it’s becoming too much. But there’s this guy-“
“Of course it’s okay. You’re family.” Hermione smiled, “And Ginny will probably be too busy concentrating on Quidditch.”
It only took a few seconds for his parents to apparate into the apartment. His mother rushed over to Harry to check his pulse.
“Don’t be a dick.” Remus grinned, bumping shoulders with Sirius, “But maybe you should leave the planning to Draco’s parents as I am sure that you’re both ready to marry?”
“Don’t talk like that.” Draco frowned, “Harry’s not dead and I don’t want to even humour the idea of him dying. I’m definite that even if he weren’t to have met me, there would have been someone else to help him.”
“Okay. As much as I do like this whole romantic thing going on. It’s kind of 360 of you?” Harry frowned, seemingly confused, “Are you okay?”
“Look at me Draco. Do I look like I pursued the person I was dreaming with?” Sirius asked, “You always have a choice. But don’t think that dreams are forcing feelings. You know who Harry is, you’ve done things other than sex. You’ve probably talked and shared secrets. Don’t you think it’s time you let love win?
“It is the end of the world!” Draco yelled, cutting his father off. The blond wizard finally lets his parents see his face. They already witnessed him realising that he cared for Harry a little more than you cared for a friend, it surely couldn’t get worse than that.
“Really? Our first kiss was just you checking to see if it was awkward?” Harry complained, “How does that even work?”
“There’s nothing to worry about. You are a wizard and I’m sure you’ve seen the number of sweets that Dumbledore used to eat.” Draco laughed, “So why are you here?”
Draco liked to experiment with drinks and he hoped Harry had similar tastes because he was going to make him his favourite drink. They weren’t allowed to sell it as it didn’t follow company recipes, so it was something that Draco had often made for himself. When he was finished with the drink, he threw in a croissant onto a plate and watched as Claire’s eyebrows raised in an offended manner. Of course, the girl would have one less croissant to nibble on, but that was the whole point.
“So that’s what you did.” Sirius voiced, “You spoilt him with kindness! You made him fall in love with you!”
“It takes time for him to be sexual with people.” Pansy tries to explain, “Like he needs to have a connection with them. Gender isn’t really that big of a deal for him, it’s all about the bond he has with the person. Does that make sense?”
“I’m sure they’re already regretting it.” Harry grinned, “They’re currently both passed out on an air mattress in your living room.”
“Ah. So does everything electrical work like that?” Draco questioned. He hated himself for having to resort to having to actually call Harry to help him. The blond looked at the clock and realised that most places were open for breakfast around now, “I’m sorry for calling you so early. Do you want some breakfast?”
“Of course not. I was sent to Azkaban. I may have been acquitted, but my sanity was of great debate and they refused to let a toddler be in the company of an insane man.” Sirius explained, laughing bitterly. Draco could not even imagine getting wrongfully convicted of a crime you didn’t commit. Especially with being framed by someone Sirius considered a good friend. Draco wouldn’t be surprised if the wizard had trust issues, “Severus adopted Harry. He made sure to prove that the muggles that were raising him were a bad fit. They were abusing the poor kid. He was living in a blood cupboard underneath the stairs. It wasn’t until he was about eleven that he was transferred into Severus’ care.”
“Huh? Then what was bothering you?” Sirius questioned, “This entire time I was thinking that you were uncomfortable around me because I may have kissed your father back when I was young. This was way before you father married Cissy.”
“They broke your heart,” Draco stated firmly. It was the only thing that would explain why the other wizard refused to tell him, “And that’s why you don’t want to talk about them.”
It didn’t take long for Harry to find the place Draco wanted to meet. The sight of the blond always threw him off. He wasn’t sure if he would ever get used to meeting the other wizard. If someone told him that he was going to be friends with Draco Malfoy a decade ago, Harry would have vehemently denied it. But Draco was a pretty cool guy. Entertaining and different to his own close friends.
“I thought I would drop in and see how you were doing.” Harry said, “Looks like you’re doing pretty good.”
When he finally caught a glimpse of the person that apparated to his place, Draco let out a little-shocked noise.
“You haven’t started a fire again have you?” Harry queried, looking for a shirt. The last time Draco caused a fire, Harry ended up with a pretty bad burn and that was because he didn’t have the extra protection of a shirt. He did not want to repeat the same mistake twice.
To think that Harry Potter was actually able to refer to Draco Malfoy as his friend was a little strange.
“You know that’s really bad for your health.” Pansy stated, taking a drag of her own cigarette. They were both leaning against the balcony and it was quite a sad sight. The two of them standing in the rain just smoking.
“And what should I be in awe with?” Harry asked, maybe he would be able to get more information about Draco from his father, “I hope you don’t mind me asking this, but why did Draco not attend Hogwarts?”
Draco looked like he was working on a potion. That was the best way Harry could describe it. And Harry couldn’t help but wonder if Draco would have worked on becoming a potions master if he decided to pursue a career in the wizarding world.
“I’m not dating anyone.” Draco repeated, “Why would Harry think I’m avoiding him? Did I do something to make him think I was avoiding him?”
“If you want to believe that I picked that particular pair because you’re a Gryffindor, I won’t argue.” Draco laughed, “But in all honesty, I just picked the next pair in the pack.”
“Well, I think it’s time we went to consummate the marriage.” Draco stated, “So enjoy the open bar, take as much as food as you want. Take the damn cake too if you want.”
“I was either. But I’m glad it was.” Draco laughed, he was glad that it wasn’t difficult, “Now let’s watch this little munchkin and hope for the best for those two.”
“Really? So who’s your dreammate?” Draco queried, it would be interesting to know if they had any control over who they dream-walked with, “Anyone I know?”
“Oh, honey.” Pansy whispered, pulling him into her arms. It was nice to be comforted. Draco hated feeling weak. But Harry getting hurt scared him, he hadn’t experienced this level of fear since Voldemort. The idea of losing Harry made his heart twist painfully, “I’m sure he’ll be okay. Are you heading over there now? Do you want me to come with you?”
“Draco.” Lucius started cautiously, moving to sit beside his son. The older man put a hand on Draco’s shoulder, “Son, it may feel like it is the end of the worl-“
So it wasn’t a surprise party. It turned out that he and Ron were actually ridiculously late. Harry had looked at him strangely, and Draco’s own father gave him a look that suggested that he would get a talking to later on.
“Maybe a little bit. Okay. Yes. I am drunk.” Harry frowned. His questions made a lot more sense in his head. But lately nothing seemed to make much sense, “I don’t know what I’m doing anymore.”
The brunet then found a table in one of the far corners of the café in hopes that he wouldn’t be noticed straight away. When Draco came back into sight, Harry couldn’t help but notice how he seemed very friendly with his coworker. And for some reason that made his gut twist painfully.
“No take backs.” Harry continued, “I think we’d have to alternate with the bedroom because you only have one room.”
“No. You don’t” Draco argued, “Your whole life has revolved around Voldemort and having to destroy him. It’s time you lived your life without the worry of things going to shit. There are so many strong witches and wizards. I think it’s their turn to take the torch.”
“I won’t tell anyone.” Hermione promised, “There was always something about Draco. I could never really put my finger on it. But I think I finally understand what is going on.”
“Were you a part of Harry’s life?” Draco had to ask, he knew that his cousin was awful to Severus. His father had often commented on it and made sure that Draco wouldn’t grow up to be a bully, “Did Severus let you be a part of his life.”
“And what would I be thinking?” Draco laughed, “Maybe I’m not thinking whatever you think I’m thinking.”
“Really mate?” Ron snorted, “The last time I went to stay at your place the both of you were very vocal. It was that bad that I considered just going back to my mam’s. Seriously have you guys never considered using a silencing charm while you have guests?”
“And I’ll take the chicken tikka masala and I’d also like naan with it.” Harry smiled, “Can we both get glasses of mango lassi too?”
“If Draco wants to live you. Then that’s his choice to make.” Lucius said, looking at Narcissa, “We don’t disapprove.”
“No. I am fluent in French.” Draco corrected, “But I wasn’t aware that you knew that I was fluent. I’ll give these books a read in my spare time. I- I hope you don’t mind, but I do prefer to talk about books. There aren’t that many people that I know that enjoy reading and I don’t want to impose-“
“You’re as stubborn as a bull.” Ron sighed, taking a bite of his sandwich before he continued talking, “But I’ll drop it. You’re right this isn’t the time or place to be arguing about this.”
“Hello?” Harry grumbled into the phone, his voice even sounded like hell. Draco didn’t call him regularly as he was a quick learner. The blond had managed to figure out how the majority of things without any help. And Harry wasn’t going to admit this to anyone, but he did kind of enjoy it when Draco did call him. It gave him an excuse to spend a bit of time with the blond. They were becoming quite good friends.
“Of course I do.” Draco snorted, “You’re not so easy to get rid of and I’ve gotten rather attached to you.”
“That can be arranged.” Draco smiled, standing up. His fingers lingered on the arm of the chair before approaching Harry, “But not tonight. I need to cool off.”
“Suit yourself.” Pansy said flatly, it was clear that she was upset. The dark haired girl didn’t seem to understand that he couldn’t spend all his time with her, for one thing he was gay and there wasn’t going to be any other progression of their relationship. Draco knew that Pansy was attracted to him and was hoping for something more.
“Why do you think that you’re not good enough for him? Harry, you received both of his parents’ approval. Do you know how difficult it is to satisfy a man like Lucius Malfoy? There’s something about you that he liked, that he believed was good enough for his son.” Severus answered, “You don’t need to concentrate on the what-ifs. Turn that focus onto the now. Enjoy the courting stage of your relationship. There are always going to be ups and downs in a relationship. And if you ever feel that the fire has turned to embers, find a way to rekindle it. A fire can continue to burn as long as you work on it. Relationships take a lot of work.”
“We will see.” Sirius sighed, he seemed to be better, “I guess we should go back in. I’d grab any bottle of wine.”
“Thank you,” Draco said softly, collecting what would be his uniform. It was an ugly piece of fabric, but he wasn’t going to let her know that, “Why Drake? Why not Draco?”
“I’m going to make it right.” Remus stated firmly, “If I only knew beforehand, I would have never done anything to hurt him.”
“What the hell? This place still looks like a dump.” Harry said aloud. Draco couldn’t help but wonder if the brunet thought he was home alone. He could surely sense their magical signatures, right? Draco attempted to withhold a laugh, but he could hear Harry stumbling around muttering, “Shit. Where the hell is my wand?”
Harry would always be haunted by the shadow of Voldemort, there was always an expectation for him to be this perfect individual and it always surprised him to think of how he had managed to live with such a heavy burden on his shoulders. Even when he wasn’t aware of being a wizard, everyone else expected him to be their saviour. And in all honesty, Harry probably would have ended up dead if he didn’t have Hermione and Ron to support him.
“You don’t know that. Dreams are dreams. They don’t indicate anything of compatibility. We could be disastrous for all you know.” Draco voiced firmly, pushing Harry away from him. “And I’m not that easy Potter. Don’t expect me to bend backwards for you. We don’t know each other like that.”
“Ah. So you do know how this works.” Draco frowned. He had heard of elderflower wine, but he had never had the opportunity to try it. And wine and chocolates sounded really good right now. But there was a catch to the whole gift, “If I accept your courting gift, that will mean that I am allowing you to continue courting me.”
“Why a sudden interest in my son?” Lucius asked curiously, before humouring Harry’s question, “Draco decided that he wanted to attend Durmstrang against his mother’s wishes. She had always wanted him to study nearer, but he was adamant.”
What he wasn’t expecting was the sight of Harry springing onto the other man just to punch the hell out of him. There was a crowd forming around them and Draco had a feeling that the authorities were going to get involved.
“Oh my God. Is this like a family thing that you guys do? Because it’s super creepy.” Harry complained, “Just get to the point. Please.”
Draco stared at the book covers. The blond used to love reading when he was younger, but he wasn’t sure if he was going to appreciate Muggle literature. He flipped one of the books over to read the blurb and there was something that struck out to him, “These are all in French.”
Harry wasn’t even sure what to say to that. He bit his tongue and withheld the temptation to tell Draco that he loved him. It was far too early in the relationship to tell him that, he didn’t want to scare Draco away. One of the only good things to happen to him.
“Because you’re going through the same thing as me.” Harry stated firmly, “Now why don’t we help each other move on? Voldemort has made it practically impossible to live a normal life. This has probably been the first bit of normalcy that I’ve experienced in a while.”
“Harry, darling do you need a hand?” Draco yelled, hoping to make Harry aware that he was not in the house alone, “Have you checked the bedside table?”
“Fine. I’ll stop being a prick if you stop being vain.” Draco offered, Blaise appeared to think about it for a minute before laughing.
“I care for you too.” Draco sighed, “So next time someone hurts me, don’t do something stupid and get in trouble with authority.”
“If I didn’t know any better one would assume that you were talking to the air.” A voice snorted, it sounded very familiar. But Harry couldn’t put a face to the voice. The brunet turned around and came face to face with Lucius Malfoy, “Most people are in awe of being in my presence, but I guess things have to be been different for the infamous Harry Potter.”
“Yes. You will still get your wine and chocolates if you say no.” Harry answered flatly, his face was blank. But Draco had read enough people in his lifetime to know that the other wizard was panicking, “I’m not going to force you into anything that you don’t want.”
“Merlin. I would never do that.” Draco frowned, he was sure that Hermione had the best interests at heart. But that still did not mean that Draco agreed with her methods. Harry should have been able to share his ideas freely too, “If I ever do sound controlling or I’m just an absolute dickhead, please tell me.”
“Then what’s the point of having it go that high?” Draco frowned, “And I was feeling a little peckish. Buttered toast sounded pretty good.”
“Harry’s in love with me?” Draco repeated. Hermione’s eyes widened considerably at the question, “That’s why you were giving me those looks?”
“Yes, Lucius Malfoy is my father.” A voice cut in, “And yes, Malfoys and Weasley’s are not supposed to get along. But I’ve never been one to keep up with family traditions.”
“Not as weird as you thought it would feel?” Harry said defensively, “What’s that supposed to mean?”
“So how else would you explain what has been happening?” Harry continued, he wanted to get answers. He wasn’t going to get swayed by a pretty face, “Why would we be sharing dreams if we have never met before?”
“Sorry. We can change the subject, but only if you promise me that you that you won’t continue to beat yourself up.” Harry stressed, “This is a new start. You need to accept the past and not run away from it.”
“How do you know that I’m in love with Remus? I never told anyone.” Sirius frowned, “Well. The two of you are dating so it would be pretty awkward if you weren’t in love.”
“Ginny Weasley.” Draco repeated, “Well. I wasn’t expecting that. But you did say she was pretty back when we were at Hogwarts, so it’s not really that surprising. I still think you should go for it.”
“Of course.” The waiter smiled, “Your food should take be ready in about thirty minutes. I’ll have your lassi out in just a second.”
He wouldn’t be able to see Harry for the week. Which was kind of surprising considering the fact that the other insisted on trying to see him at least once a day. It was kind of endearing. But Harry was going to be on some Auror secret mission that made Draco feel anxious.
“At least I dated her.” Ron shot back, “Do you know how thick you’ve got to be to want to marry someone without actually knowing them? I’m surprised that his parents even agreed to let you court him. That’s the part that I don’t understand. You would think they’d have higher standards.”
“Do you think he will mind elderflower wine?” Harry asked cautiously. He had heard of Superior Red, but surely Draco wouldn’t be too happy being gifted the wine that his family manufactured, “Or do you think he would hate it?”
“You were the only ones in close proximity to me. The dreams started before I started attending Durmstrang.” Draco cut in, he really wasn’t in the mood to have to skirt around the subject. He needed his parents to get straight to the point. Tell him what was going on, “There’s no other reasonable explanation to this.”
“I know that now. I feel like death and I'm sure feeling like death is a lot worse than feeling like this.” Draco groaned, “You should have told me all of this before. This would have never happened.”
“You did all of that for me?” Draco questioned, “I can’t believe you and Hermione did this without telling me.”
“Okay, what don’t you want to talk about?” Blaise asked, “Does this have something to do with Potter? I am already aware of the fact that you’re pining for him. But you’re probably not dating yet, right? You were always a little slow when it came to your feelings.”
“Harry’s a numpty.” Draco sighed, relaxing a bit. The brunet could be infuriating sometimes, “It’s worse that you played along with it.”
Everything about Sirius Black reminded Draco of a cat, the way the other wizard could languidly lie across and nap on any surface without a trouble in the world would concern most.
“Do I get under your skin that much?” Harry queried, letting Draco take his hands in his own. His blood felt like it was on fire, he had never felt this way about anyone through touch before, “I’ll try to ease off.”
“I hope they’re suffering,” Draco said, startling another laugh out of Harry. The blond could be blunt sometimes.
“Yeah. I’m just trying to wind you up.” Draco teased, “I like to keep my sexual escapades personal. Thankfully I wasn’t influenced by Blaise like Pansy was.”
“I can give you a potion to sober you up if you’d like?” Harry asked, “Or I could get you a greasy kebab to munch on. It should help you feel a bit better.”
“I am perfectly well aware of the concept of not letting anyone know, dearest cousin.” Sirius grinned, “But Harry isn’t anyone.”
“Oh.” Draco breathed, “Er. So I’m going to need your help? I’m not entirely sure how these devices work.”
“Don’t tell that to Hermione because she will actually kill me.” Draco laughed, “I guess I should thank you for telling her to give me a chance at friendship.”
Draco smiled at Harry as they made their way around the venue saying goodbye to their family and friends.
“You want Draco to move into your house.” Lucius repeated, “Like you want him to live with you? Like in your house?”
“You’re an okay looking guy.” Ron muttered, “But Draco is kind of ridiculously good looking. If I didn’t know any better, I would have probably thought he was part Veela.”
“I’m thinking we should just elope.” Harry sighed, this was the third time this week that they were trying to plan the wedding. But they were failing miserably and the fact that it was a wedding between Harry Potter and a Malfoy added to the stress. Everyone expecting so much from them. And Draco didn’t want to make the wedding into some kind of social affair. But that was exactly what it was beginning to feel like, “Can’t we do something a little more intimate?”
“Yes, I’ll make you dinner. But you can’t complain.” Draco warned, “Because if I hear anything insulting come out of your mouth, I’ll sew your mouth shut.”
“Does that mean you’re going to be working tomorrow too?” Harry questioned, “Aren’t you worried that they’re going to overwork you?”
Maybe Draco did feel a connection to Harry from the moment that they had met each other. Or maybe it happened at another time. This was something he probably wouldn’t figure out until later. But for now, he was perfectly content with knowing that he was definitely in love with Harry Potter.
“What are you doing here?” Draco frowned, he was glad that he could still talk coherently. But he was sure that he still sounded rough, his mouth felt like it was stuck together, “Did I call you?”
“Okay.” Draco agreed, he never realised that Harry was also struggling with the aftermath of Voldemort. The blond could not even imagine what Harry was going through. They were two separate sides of the same coin. Experiencing the same level of attention, but for different reasons. Voldemort really did ruin the idea of living normal lives, “I think I can do that.”
I know it has been a while since I last updated. Life has been hectic, I have a new job and everything seems to be going right. I'm thinking of ending Muggled - Muddled, so the next chapter will be the last. Thank you all for being so supportive.
“Shit.” Draco whispered to himself as he searched the place for the paper that Harry had given him before he moved. When he eventually found it, it was five in the morning and he was sure that Harry wouldn’t appreciate being called at this time. And Draco wasn’t entirely comfortable using the Muggle device he had bought to communicate with his friends. In all honesty, he was beginning to regret this whole move.
“Harry, I think it’s a great idea. We don’t need to tweak it.” Draco responded, “Why are you doubting your ideas so much? I think they’re pretty damn good.”
“Okay. I’ll get you all some food.” Harry smiled, “I’m going to check on Pansy and Blaise and see if they’re okay. But it looks like I’m going to have to take care of the lot of you. You're all a mess.”
“The bread. It’s stuck.” Draco stated, staring at the toaster. The knife beside the blond made Harry feel relieved that the blond hopefully didn’t attempt to use it.
“I’m fine,” Lucius answered, walking towards the lounge room. Draco could only take that as a cue to follow the older wizard because he was known to not always express what he wanted, “It was awfully selfish of you to cut your family out your life. Your mother missed you greatly.”
It had been a month he last saw Harry. It wasn’t something that he had done intentionally, but life seemed to have other plans for him. Draco was promoted to store manager, it wasn’t something he wanted. They insisted that he was one of the best employees as he made drinks that seemed to please the consumers, and in all honesty, he had potions to thank for that. Potions was a useful subject. Because he was aware of how to follow instructions to a fault and alter if necessary, it made it easier to cook, bake, or even make coffee. He was becoming somewhat of an expert.
“Because of it, he managed to get his old job back.” Harry continued, “That’s why your parents like me so much.”
“I guess that’s true.” Harry sighed, in a way it did make sense. And it wasn’t like Draco would call him unless it was absolutely necessary, “So what are your plans for the day?”
They managed to make it just in time for dessert and Draco was okay with that, he felt rather guilty because he followed his instincts and they were completely wrong for the first time. The blond was definite that Harry was planning something and the surprise party seemed like the most obvious thing that the brunet would do.
“It doesn’t matter how long we’ve been friends for.” Harry argued, “It doesn’t change the fact that I care for you.”
“If I’m completely honest. I have no idea why it goes that high.” Harry admitted, “Do you want me to make you something? What are you craving other than buttered toast?”
“Yes, I did.” Harry admitted, “What’s in this? I don’t think I’ve ever had a coffee that tasted like this before.”
“Ron.” Harry threatened, he did not want to deal with this right now. He loved his friends, but he hated that they seemed to think that they were allowed to take charge when it came to seemingly everything in his life.
“Oh, sorry. I just assumed that you were fluent in French.” Hermione apologised, making a move to try and grab the books. Draco made a gesture for her to stop.
Hi. So I probably won't be able to update as frequent as I will be going back to work on Monday- I'm not going to lie, I kind of do wish I wasn't going back. It is going to be the worst.
“Well. He’s a pure blood and why would he go for you if there are attractive guys in Slytherin like Blaise Zabini.” Ron voiced, “And that’s only if we assume he’s gay. But there’s also Pansy Parkinson and she’s not a bad looking girl either. I mean he has plenty of people to date.”
“Please don’t.” Lucius sighed, nursing his glass of wine, “I’d rather leave the wedding not scarred.”
“Of course you can’t.” Sirius agreed, “But to answer your question, no. I’m not going to tell you who it is.”
Draco loved his mother. He really did. But the idea of marriage at this current moment was terrifying, the blond turned to Harry and noticed that the brunet had also paled at the comment. It was good that they were both on the same page.
“Touch him again and I’ll kill you.” Harry hissed at the man, letting Draco drag him away from the café. Draco kind of liked this side of Harry, but he wasn’t going to tell the brunet that. That would only encourage his reckless behaviour.
“Don’t pity me,” Draco said. This was exactly what he was dreading. Being pitied, “What happened is in the past. We shouldn’t dwell on things that we can’t change.”
“Meet up?” Draco queried, “I guess I can do that. Is around lunchtime okay? I’m thinking any time after twelve in the afternoon.”
“The dreams,” Draco said incredulously, it was now beginning to make perfect sense the reason his parents were so accepting of Harry Potter. They were the ones that had somehow linked Harry to him. Draco moved away from his mother’s arms before taking a seat on the chair opposite of his father, “Now the two of you have better have a good explanation as to what you thought you would gain from connecting my dreams with Harry.”
Harry was expecting a visit from Draco a lot sooner. Maybe Draco was really as estranged as his father made him out to be. But that didn’t change the fact that Harry wasn’t surprised when the blond finally did make an appearance outside his door. It gave him great joy to see that Draco finally appeared to be able to feign something other than indifference. Harry was going to make Draco regret leaving him in the alley.
“Erm... Well, all the breads are good, but I personally prefer naan with curry.” Harry offered, he loved bread. But he thought it would be best to try naan first. If they ever ate Indian food again, Draco would have the opportunity to try the other types bread, “But you have plenty of time to try all the others someday.”
It was weird to think that Hermione Granger was currently sitting on his sofa. He wasn’t quite sure how to take it. But he knew there was something that he was going to have to do. Draco Malfoy had to make amends.
“So when do you need me to be in?” Harry asked, deliberately avoiding the whole other part of what Ron was saying. He hadn’t realised that he had called in sick that many times. But now that he really thought about it, he didn’t actually remember the last time he was in the store, “Do I need to dress fancy?”
“I’m going to make some breakfast. Something to hopefully make you all feel a little better.” Harry snorted, before taking a moment to pause. He knew he had to say something to Draco, but he just was not sure what it was. It took him a minute to finally say something, “By the way, if you’re drinking make sure that you don’t mix different alcohols. You’re just going to feel a lot worse than you would if you only stuck to one type.”
“You want to announce our relationship?” Draco queried, looking far too amused and Harry couldn’t help but feel worried.
“Hello?” Draco said cautiously, he still did not understand how the device worked without the help of magic.
“If you say so.” Sirius snorted, grabbing Teddy. The toddler screamed bloody murder, tears running down his chubby cheeks. Draco felt awful for the second that it took for Sirius to apparate out of the apartment with Teddy in tow.
“Really? Because they were the ones that confronted me about you.” Harry laughed, “They seemed to already know about it. I think you need to talk to Blaise and Pansy.”
“Because I had you wrapped around my little finger and I was a good child,” Harry responded. He would need to visit his childhood home sometime. He missed it, “The smell of fire-whiskey reminds me of the time I almost died.”
“I was interested. But I didn’t see any reason to follow through with his crazy ideologies. You can be interested in things you don’t want to commit to.” Lucius answered, taking a seat on the armchair, “He didn’t manage to recruit me, your mother, or Severus Snape. So, all in all, he didn’t really have the strongest allies. He ignored the prophecy and got defeated by a baby. Not exactly the best thing to be remembered for.”
“I- it’s sex. It should be something that’s kept personal.” Harry said firmly, there was a suspicious glint in Draco’s eyes that made Harry regret his statement, “Like sex should be between the two of us.”
“Draco. Freshen up, take some time to compose yourself.” Lucius added, “Your mother and I will take Harry to St Mungo’s.”
“I- Maybe I shouldn’t have asked about this.” Draco said softly, he felt like he was prying into a part of Harry’s life that he wasn’t supposed to know, “I feel like I’m intruding.”
He was having an internal meltdown. Draco didn’t even want to look at Harry. If he could crawl into a hole and disappear for the rest of his life, he would. This was no how he wanted to confess his feeling to Harry. Life was just so cruel.
“He stopped using magic in his house just to see how you would feel.” Remus smiled, “Rather romantic, don’t you think?”
“You don’t seem upset by his decision?” Harry continued, but now it made sense as to why Harry had never met Draco Malfoy. They were probably around the same age, “Durmstang is the school to go to for the curriculum having an emphasis on the teaching of dark arts.”
“Harry. Don’t be so loud, he’s napping.” Draco scolded, “And he’s not my child. I don’t have children.”
It was a cold morning. Draco could see his condensation every time he breathed out. The blond was always partial to colder weather. The cooler air was always refreshing. There was something about a crisp day that always seemed to make Draco feel better. It was the perfect day for a fresh start. The wizard smiled to himself as he deposited the final box on the living room floor.
“He knows.” Blaise cut in, “And if he really struggles, he can always contact Potter. I’m sure he would be more than willing to help.”
“Great.” Harry responded, “This isn’t a regular latte. What did you add? It’s pretty good. And I’m not even a coffee drinker.”
“Blimey. ‘Mione was right.” Ron laughed, his eyes crinkling in a way that suggested that he knew exactly what Harry was hiding, “But yeah, I’m definite that he broke something.”
Harry was plagued by very vivid dreams. They were there for as long as he could remember, blond hair, grey eyes, writhing beneath him in total ecstasy. The brunet wasn’t complaining, the guy helped Harry through plenty of lonely nights, but it was rather difficult when he was in a relationship.
“I’ll see you on Saturday.” Hermione agreed, pressing a kiss to his cheek, “Take care of yourself, Harry.”
“No problem. I’m glad that you liked it.” Harry blushed, it was a rather adorable sight, “Maybe next time I can bring some Indian food.”
“And that’s why I love you.” Draco laughed, kissing Harry’s cheek. Sirius made a gagging noise at the display of affection, that just made Draco laugh, “Sirius. Shouldn’t you be going?”
He sighed, eventually relenting and deciding that he should definitely call Harry Potter. Just to have a rundown of how things actually functioned. He dialled the number on the paper and listened to the dial tune before there was a distinct sound indicating that someone had picked up.
Harry was not going to let him get away that easily. The brunet glanced at the twins before he made his way out to follow Draco Malfoy. It felt like the blond was expecting him to follow him, Harry managed to crowd him into a wall. There was no exit. They were going to have to talk about this weird dream thing.
Draco wouldn’t admit this to anyone. But his eyes did water a little at the sight of Teddy in tears. Draco was also a little attached to Teddy. It was going to be his little secret.
“Drake. You’re a real professional.” Andy smiled, going in a little too close for comfort, “Should I take you out tonight?”
“You mean you can’t believe that you’re in love with Harry Potter.” Blaise corrected, “It was bound to happen sooner than later. But looks like I won the ongoing bet.”
“Those fucking peacocks.” Draco laughed, they were mean birds and Draco was taunted by them when he was a child. It was only when he was older and managed to perfect the Malfoy glare that the birds eventually learnt to leave him alone. But he couldn’t say the same thing for Harry. Who managed to get attacked by them without even being in close proximity to them, “They’ll probably scare all the guests away.”
“Thanks.” Draco muttered, accepting the drink from Blaise, “But sometimes a shag is good for business.”
“Really? I could compile a whole list of everything bad that you’ve done.” Blaise pointed out, “I’m sure Potter would take an interest in it.”
“Harry’s right.” Lucius snorted, “You were telling me that you wanted to master potions. Being a healer will take a lot of time.”
“No, no mate.” Ron grinned, patting his back in a friendly manner, “‘Mione said that you’re like a hawk, you very perceptive.”
“You’re going to receive a response soon.” Luna promised, “But I wanted to tell you beforehand that she will probably offer you a position as a Potion’s professor. As you know, Professor Snape is going away for the year.”
“You. The boy who lived. The wizard that defeated Voldemort. You admire me?” Draco snorted, “There’s nothing to be admired.”
“You will be there for him.” Lucius continued, “But first you need to contact his friends, let them know what’s going on.”
“There’s paracetamol and water on the table.” Harry laughed, “That might help you a little bit. But I’m afraid you’ll probably be bedridden most of the day.”
“Cousin. Now, what kind of trouble have you gotten yourself into this time?” Sirius greeted, grinning like a Cheshire cat, “Narcissa and Lucius were rather insistent on us having a conversation. Please tell me this is not the sex talk?”
“Now we can finally prepare for the wedding.” Harry added, “If you still want to get married to me of course.”
“Sure.” Draco politely smiled, telling the customer the total and dealing with the whole cash register. After that, he made his way to make the espresso. It was one of the most simple drinks to make. Well, that’s what most people would say. But with an espresso, you had to make sure that the beans were ground correctly. If it was too coarse, the process would be a lot faster and would have a light taste. But if the grounds were too fine, then the whole process would flip around and it would take a lot longer.
“I’m pregnant.” Ginny said, “Blaise’s mother already knows, she was the one that suggested that I go to a healer. Just to confirm.”
“Oh.” Draco answered, “It’s not my place to tell you. Maybe when you find him, you’ll be able to have a well-needed conversation.”
“I’m very much decent.” Sirius snorted, entering shortly after. The man looked far too smug, and it was definitely a turn from when the man was miserable. Draco preferred it, “And please stop with the teasing.”
“Hello?” Draco said cautiously, he still did not understand how the device worked without magic. The idea of Muggles evolving to this point made the blond question why they did not learn about Muggle technology while they were at Hogwarts.
“But what’s am I supposed to do now?” Draco asked, “I don’t want to ruin everything that we’ve built.”
Draco smiled, kicked the back of Harry’s leg so that the brunet would fall backwards. In response, the other wizard let out a very frightened yelp before Draco caught him by the waist. Draco stared at Harry’s face for a few seconds before closing in.
“My mother gave you wine?” Draco repeated incredulously, “She really gave you a whole crate of wine?”
The tell-tale signs of someone apparating into his apartment made Draco set the book on the table. It seemed a little early for Harry to be back.
“I like spicy food.” Draco answered, before asking him another question, “So I guess I’ll go for the vindaloo. What’s the difference between the breads? Chapati, roti, and naan?”
“That I’m in love with Harry.” Draco supplied. For some reason that seemed to set Ron off, the redhead started laughing in a way that made Draco wonder how the wizard would react to actually being told a joke, “Why are you laughing?”
“I didn’t know that I was a friend.” Draco snorted, “But how would you feel about dating a Slytherin?”
“What look?” Draco queried, before smiling widely. Harry had planned a family dinner that Draco was sure had something to do with his birthday and all his friends and family were invited. The blond had a feeling that they were going to try to make it seem like a surprise, but Draco knew when his own birthday was, “I guess we should get going.”
“We’re not dating. It seems that everyone other than ourselves thinks that we’re dating.” Draco insisted, “And I can tell by the way you look at him.”
“Jesus Christ. You really are barmy.” Ron groaned loudly, he was making his displeasure about the whole courting thing very apparent, “Have you never heard the phrase do not mix business with pleasure? Can’t believe you just met the guy and you jumped straight into the whole I want to marry Draco Malfoy thing.”
“So what did you need help with?” Harry asked, looking around his place, “Do you need some help with unboxing? Or is it your phone?”
“It is okay to be selfish sometimes.” Draco confirmed, “Don’t you think it’s time you lived your life the way that you want?”
“Does telling yourself that make it easier to go to bed at night?” Blaise teased, “In all honesty. We don’t know what would have happened. But I’m almost definite that he would have died.”
“They are.” Hermione smiled, “But Harry has said such good things about you. They think it might be a good thing that you connect to Teddy. You are related, after all.”
“Wow.” The man grinned, “I haven’t had an espresso this good from one of our chains in quite some time.”
“Okay.” Harry snorted, letting out a little laugh, “Is there anything else? Would you like me to get you some freshly squeezed orange juice with that?”
“I’m still currently working on finding a place here before I tell my parents that I’m moving back to England.” Draco explained giving him a serious look, “And before you get too cocky, I was planning on moving back before I met you.”
But that also meant that he would have to do something else for the year, he had already quit his Muggle job and he wasn’t entirely sure if he should get another one, or try to get something in the Wizarding world. He had so many options to pick from.
“Anything’s possible with magic.” Draco smiled, “I do see myself having children with you. But not now. Give it a few years.”
Draco stared at the text incredulously. Claire had messaged him to let him know that Andy had been fired, it turned out that quite a lot of workers across England had come forward to say that Andy had sexually harassed them.
The brunet didn’t respond. Draco had a feeling that he was embarrassed, and surely enough the wizard came down looking a little flushed, wand in hand.
“Can you just kill me?” Draco repeated, letting out a pathetic whine. He was surely going to throw up if the room didn’t stop spinning. Why did he do this to himself? No. That wasn't right. Why did he let his friends do this to him?
“How the hell are you going to plan a wedding in a week?” Draco frowned, “Your family don’t even know that you’re together. Are you sure you want to get married so soon?”
“No, let’s go to bed.” Harry smiled, it was a flirtatious look. So Draco immediately felt a sense of relief.“Which one’s your room?”
“I think you should consider training to be a healer.” The nurse suggested, “Harry is known to avoid St Mungo’s when he’s injured.”
“What?” Draco frowned, both his friends were having children with Weasley’s? What on earth was going on? He was in shock, “You slept with a Weasley and now you're pregnant.”
“No. I was planning on getting a house.” Draco answered, “My neighbours have been a little loud lately, and I thought it would be better to get a place with more privacy.”
“You and Claire, you’re becoming quite good friends.” Harry commented, “Are you planning on dating her?”
“Ugh, how are we even friends?” Ron smiled, in turn making Draco smile. Jeez. This was getting corny, “You know I hate you, right?”
When he was sure that he had stopped the bleeding. For some reason Draco was reminded of how when he was younger, he used to always summon an object from the fireplace as a distress call. Draco knew his family didn’t have phones and he couldn’t exactly floo them and ask them to come. So Draco summoned the candle holder. He just hoped his parents remembered.
“Bye Drake. Enjoy your freedom while you still can.” Claire joked, before making her way back to the café. Muggles were definitely odd creatures.
“So you don’t want them to know that you speak parseltongue when I go down on you?” Draco commented, “Or that you’re a fan of a little rough play?”
That’s why he was going to wait for a year when Snape will be able to assist him in becoming a Potions Master. He would tell Harry when he was definite that that was what he was going to do.
“Did Draco have anything to do with the two of you meeting?” Harry asked, “Like he didn’t set you up, did he?”
It was only when the girl pointed him out to Draco that the brunet decided to look a little sheepish at getting caught. The blond gave him a curious look before heading over to what Harry could only assume was the machine that was going to make a latte?
“Yeah. I just needed to clean the place.” Draco answered, “My father said that I need to freshen up. How bad do I look? I can go by myself.”
“Oh shit. Hold on.” Draco groaned, running to his bedroom, Harry could hear everything that he was saying. It was sort of weird, “Yes. I’m working. But it’s not until the afternoon.”
It was cold. Draco could see his condensation every time he exhaled. It was refreshing in a way. A great way to start again. He smiled as he finally deposited the final box into his new apartment.
“It’s meant to suck things up.” Harry insisted, “Well. It’s meant to suck dirt up. It’s good for cleaning carpets.”
“Of course Harry’s brash. He gets it from his father, and it’s not like you would have talked to him soon. You would have probably left it for a few months before talking to the poor guy.” Sirius pointed out, “It’s not like you guys can talk anymore. The dreams have stopped.”
It was only after Ron left that Draco realised he never did ask the redheaded wizard what he was doing Muggle London. But that was something he could bring up the next time he saw the man.
“Of course.” The waiter smiled, “Your food should take be ready in about thirty minutes. I’ll have your lassi out in just a second.”
There was someone in his arms. Harry frowned before looking down. The sight of blond hair made his eyes widen considerably. Harry carefully slid his arms off of the other wizard. He would hate to think how Draco would have reacted if he woke up to this.
The young adult sighed before walking over to the piano. It was a beautiful instrument that definitely didn’t get treated with the respect it deserved. Draco’s hand pressed against the frame of it.
“Well, Harry. We should probably let you rest.” Narcissa smiled, composing herself, “Only family and partners can stay, so I’m afraid Draco will have to leave you too.”
“We’re talking aren’t we, cousin?” Sirius grinned, Harry did not like the expression on their faces. Why would they both be grinning at the same time? It was frightening, “Or do you want some advice? To spice things up?”
“Of course. Muggles have lived perfectly fine without magic.” Draco pointed out, “And this is better than having hexes thrown at me on a daily basis. I now have the chance to start a new life. No more pain or regret.”
“But knowing these two it’s going to take another few years to actually get them married.” Sirius teased, in turn making Remus laugh. The two wizards were everything Draco wanted him and Harry to be in the future, “Can you believe it? Gryffindors and Slytherins actually living in harmony?”
Through all the years of spending time with friends, he had never woken up from snuggling one of them. It was so bizarre because the blond didn’t even know when he fell asleep. It was all rather embarrassing and he wished he could get out of it. But as usual, life had a completely different plan. Harry was like a snake, which was pretty ironic considering the fact that he was a Gryffindor. The brunet was coiled around him so tightly that there was no way that he could untangle and act like it never happened.
“Did you pick red because I’m a Gryffindor?” Harry asked curiously, as he accepted the pair of socks. Draco stared at him for a good minute before he started laughing.
“He has allergies to pork?” Harry asked, now it made sense why Draco only eats beef or chicken sausages, “Wow. You learn something new every day.”
“I trust you take care of him.” Severus stated firmly, nursing his own glass of wine. Draco had insisted on the wine being elderflower and everyone seemed to be enjoying it, “Harry. He’s happy. You saw he was while everyone else only saw his name. I’m thankful that you proved all his doubts wrong. But Harry, I raised him and he is the closest thing to a son that I will ever get. So if you hurt him, believe me when I say that I will make the rest of your life a living hell.”
“Psst. The Godfather.” Harry snorted, earning a look from everyone in the room, “Are you guys seriously telling me that none of you have seen The Godfather?”
“Please don’t.” Ron snorted, apparating out of Harry’s place. It was only when Ron left that Harry realised how much of a pain this whole thing was going to be.
“This wasn’t a test.” Andy smiled, “I’m sorry if I made you feel that way. It’s just the store manager was bragging about your work and I wanted to see it for myself.”
The first thing he noticed when he went into Draco’s room was that the blond was sleeping soundly. But there was a kebab stuck on his face.
So he wasn’t entirely sure how it ended up like this. Draco was currently cuddled up to Harry Potter.
“You told me that you worked in café near your place. It wasn’t exactly hard to find.” Harry pointed out, “How have you been? I haven’t seen you in a while.”
“Of course I put books down for people.” Draco argued, the number of times that he stopped reading because Harry had decided to suddenly appear unannounced was proof of that, “And I am not dating anyone.”
The first night was difficult. Draco spent a good few minutes trying to figure out how to turn the kettle on. He even debated on whether he really needed tea or not. What started off as a few minutes turned into a few hours. The blond had somehow managed to figure out that you needed to plug the wire into the wall socket, but no matter how many times he pressed the button on the device, it wouldn’t turn on. He just didn't understand why it was refusing to work.
“That’s something you should probably ask a magical scholar. I can’t give you answers that I don’t know.” Draco responded in a straightforward tone, “I’ve heard of an infamous scholar, Hermione Granger. Maybe she’ll have the answers to your questions. Or if you’re really desperate for an answer, you could contact Albus Dumbledore. I’m sure he would probably know something.”
No. This definitely wasn’t happening. Draco stared at the red-haired man, before ultimately deciding he couldn’t deal with this now. The blond turned hoping that the other wizard would not notice him. But as usual, life had a different plan for him.
“I can’t even believe I’m even humouring your idea.” Draco sighed, running his hands over the furniture. If Harry didn’t know any better he was sure that the house was beginning to brighten up, “But such a beautiful house does need more wizards or witches living in it. Can you not feel the magic sing? You need to bring it back to life.”
“Why on earth would they call it christening?” Draco snorted, “But that doesn't matter right now. How would you feel about having sex in every room of this house?”
“I didn’t mean that. It was just a figure of speech.” Draco said, horrified. The idea of Harry Potter living with him was daunting and his friends would tease him relentlessly if it were to happen.
“Yeah, just get me something cheap. But no beer.” Draco answered, he hated beer with a passion. Blaise snorted before heading behind the bar to get Draco his drink. The blond tried to shake off the excess water on him, and he definitely felt like a wet dog because of it. His eyes roamed around the venue, it was no surprise that the place was empty. It was still technically closed. The sound of the door opening startled him, he wasn’t used to anyone being here at this time. He caught a glimpse of the man that came in and flushed heavily before turning away.
After drinking copious amounts of Elderflower wine, Draco fell delightfully tipsy. Harry was smart enough to bring more than one bottle and Draco was sure that they had probably drunk 90% of what Harry brought. It was a great first date, well, that was if it was considered a date. Who didn’t love eating chocolates and drinking while talking about everything and anything? Draco now knew who Harry’s closest friends were, what house he was in when he was in Hogwarts, and things Draco didn’t really think he needed to know. But it was nice to have a moment like this. Moments like this were rare.
“He eats everything and he has no allergies. He usually sleeps around seven or eight pm.” Ron cut him off, “You’re almost as bad as Hermione when it comes to the whole babysitting thing.”
“Your father’s got his old job back.” Narcissa beamed, “Harry’s been working so hard on getting everyone to treat us equally.”
For an espresso, you had to make sure that the grounds weren’t too coarse or too fine. Something that fell between twenty to twenty-five seconds.
“Wow. Ron. That’s actually good advice.” Draco said, he tried not to sound astonished, he really did. But luckily Ron didn’t seem to notice, “I still have no idea how I’m supposed to confront him about it.”
“Was I supposed to keep count?” Harry grinned, “It must be over a hundred now? We’ve been dating for over a year now.”
“That doesn’t make any sense at all.” Draco frowned, drumming his fingers on the arm of the chair. He had a feeling he knew exactly what she was trying to say. But he wasn’t going to accept something that he had never heard of before. Draco would need to see more evidence of similar situations. And he would probably have to find a way to discuss this with actual scholars, “I don’t understand what you’re trying to say.”
After Draco pulled the shot and passed it over to the customer. The blond couldn’t help but wonder if the man was a coffee connoisseur. But there was a chance that the guy wouldn’t even appreciate the coffee.
“Don’t you think that’s kind of excessive?” Harry frowned, at most, he cleaned his place twice a week. But three times just sounded a little too much for him, “If you’re not doing anything later, do you want to meet up?”
“I’m glad that you seem to be fine with this whole thing.” Harry sighed, “I can’t believe he hit you.”
“Jesus Christ. Can you just pay attention to what I’m saying at least once?” Ron hissed out, slamming his mug down on the table. Harry was startled out of his thoughts. It was moments like this that made Harry really wonder if having friends was really such a good idea, “Before you went to la la land, I was trying to tell you how we’re expecting a really important visitor.”
