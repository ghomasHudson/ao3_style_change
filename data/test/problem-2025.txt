Thank you for all the lovely comments!
George grinned proudly. “Everything! All ickle Ronnie’s idea!”
“Mrs. Malfoy,” Harry greeted gently. “Why don’t you sit down?”
Ron grinned. “Well, if Hermione and I had one, I could live with you. She could live with us on the weekends. I mean, we’d have to ask McGonagall, but she’s hardly going to say no – not to Hermione. I could apparate into Hogsmeade or Diagon Alley to work in the shop.”
“You follow American quidditch?” Harry asked Proudfoot and Savage.
“Doesn’t matter,” Malfoy mumbled numbly. “Potter, they’re not just titles, you know.”
Harry stepped through the DMLE floo seconds after an owl informing him of an emergency meeting had arrived, assuming he’d be the first. Instead, he was greeted by four accusing stares.
Hermione taught me how to kill the troll with
Harry sighed, knowing she wouldn’t like his answer. “Until the last death eaters have been caught, yes. I’ll decide what to do after that.”
Hermione kept grumbling as they joined George, Ginny and Mrs. Weasley at the table for lunch.
, hyper-aware of the shadows creeping in around him, but light was shortly provided.
“It’s hard to forget,” Harry mumbled, flushing bright red. “Malfoy, I- “
They continued in this manner for several hours, until all three of them were so tired they could barely keep their eyes open.
Ron pouted. “But when you’re Minister for Magic you can change that. Make me Your Excellency or something.”
“Come with me,” Robards said, leading them inside the Auror Headquarters, and into his large office at the end of a large room of cubicles. Several aurors glanced up at them and nodded, but quickly went back to great volumes of paperwork. “Please, have a seat,” Robards gestured to the three seats in front of the desk.
As he let the water run over his body, washing away the blood and dust and grime and dirt of the day’s fight, Harry tried to ignore the way his hands were shaking. A medi-witch had told him he had a mild concussion. That was the only reason he’d cast the Unforgivable. He was distracted. Wasn’t thinking straight. He wasn’t turning dark. Not really.
Hermione raised an eyebrow at Harry, glancing at the very vulnerable infant bouncing on his lap, before escorting Narcissa out of the room, asking a vague question about Pledging ceremonies. Harry considered for a minute before shaking his head and regretfully handing his godson back to Ron. It felt like eons since he had spent quality time with Teddy, but he really didn’t think he should be present for this particular conversation.
Kreacher started to twist his ears. Harry groaned, remembering Dobby in second year. “No! Kreacher you are never to hurt yourself,” Harry commanded firmly.
“No way,” Ron exclaimed, running over to a small television set in the corner of the room. “How does it work in here?” he asked the elves.
Harry nodded, but grabbed a blank piece of parchment. It was thicker than the stuff he usually used and picking up the quill resting in the ink pot next to it, he realised that it too was much fancier than the one he had found in the bottom of his school trunk. Glancing at the note to see how he should structure it, he wrote:
Harry shrugged. “Probably. Why?”
She smiled and pulled Harry into a hug. “You know it doesn’t matter, right? I know some muggles don’t like it, but wizards and witches are generally accepting,” she murmured.
Draco looked thoughtful. “You probably do have more evil in you than others – you spent seventeen years with a part of His soul in you. That has to add something to you. But I don’t think that makes you a bad person. Sure, you are drawn to the dark, but you actively aim for light – working against your own nature to do good is far nobler than just being good.”
Harry cast. A numbing spell. It was a kindness that perhaps the werewolf didn’t deserve, but Harry knew what his next spell would do. “
Harry smiled fondly. Kreacher had only been gone for a few days, but already he missed the elf – a sentiment that no doubt had Sirius turning in his grave. Without Kreacher’s annoying yet well-meaning reminders, Harry had only eaten twice in the time since he’d left and hadn’t slept once. “Is there anything going?”
“Right, let’s get down to business,” Hermione said, standing up, and Harry very gratefully gave up the attention of their small group to her. “Draco?”
Harry nodded. “I don’t want to join the training program. If Robards is okay with it, I’d like to find them with the rest of the aurors. After they’re caught and given a fair trial, I’ll decide what to do.”
Casting a quick monitoring charm over the crib, Harry made his way down to the kitchen.
Kingsley nodded in greeting at them, looking highly unsurprised at the company. “The night warden has just done his rounds on this level. He’ll be going upstairs now, so the hallways between here and the prison block should be empty, save for the guards outside his cell.” He clasped Harry’s hand. “Thank you, Harry.”
George clapped his brother on the back. “Always knew you had sense,” he said, reaching into his coat pocket and revealing a label-less bottle of light brown liquid. He slammed it on the table. “Give me the quill.”
Harry looked up in surprise. “Do you think that’s why I’ve become more powerful?” Draco looked at him with confusion. Harry sighed. “When I killed Voldemort, I took his magic. I don’t know how or why but ever since then I’ve been much more powerful. Is it because Voldemort used to practice the Old Ways?”
Harry frowned. “Actually, Draco, that gives me an idea. Can we use the dungeons?”
The room went silent as Harry realised what he’d just asked. He bit his lip. “I’ll explain in a moment.”
Harry winced. Where the woman had once been regal and frightening, she now in equal parts seemed weak and terrified – deathly pale with dark shadows under her eyes. Her pureblood rearing, however, seemed to not have faded as she attempted to curtsey low to Harry. He cursed and caught her other elbow as she nearly toppled over again.
Malfoy looked slightly apologetic but didn’t say anything.
Hermione rolled her eyes. “That’s America, Ron. We just call the Minister’s spouse ‘Mr. or Mrs.’”
Harry raised an eyebrow but ignored him. Turning to Ron, instead, he said, “You don’t have to be here.”
Roslyn smiled as she took their coats. “Pleasure to meet you, Master Malfoy,” she said, curtseying. She grimaced slightly but tried to hide it. “I have met many of your elves. The Malfoy family are neighbours to the Potters.”
Harry didn’t have the same luck. “Er… Lord Malfoy, I accept your offer of service to repay your three life debts. You may teach me the ways of the Old. So, mote it be,” Harry said in a rush, barely pausing at the end of his sentences.
“Gives you the heebie-jeebies,” Malfoy muttered under his breath. “Potter, I don’t care if holding the Elder Wand makes you feel like your body is on fire – you need to start using it. The occasional thunderstorm when you’re angry is one thing, but the more power you try to push through that stick, the more dangerous your outbursts will get. Someone could get hurt.” Malfoy rounded on Hermione. “Granger, how could you let this happen? You know more about wandlore than I do.”
“Wow,” Neville said, picking up the bottle. “What’s it taste like?”
Harry had left early from their gathering that evening at Hermione’s insistence. Her intention was for him to go home and get some much-deserved (and needed) sleep, but there was just too much to do before his expedition to the forest the following afternoon. Most notably, Draco and his mother were to move in by the following morning, and Harry hadn’t even thought of starting packing yet – not to mention the horcrux of Narcissa’s sister hanging in the basement.
“Trying to get rid of me, Potter?” Malfoy asked, raising an eyebrow.
“I would like to honour the ways of the Old. I owe Potter a debt. I can’t formally ask to repay them, as I am not standing up, but yes, I would like to repay them. I don’t want my magic to get any weaker,” Malfoy said quietly.
The lift chimed as they reached the second level, and an automated female voice declared, “Department of Magical Law Enforcement.”
“It’s your signet ring. You wear it on the pinkie of your non-dominant hand,” Malfoy told him, showing his own ring on the pinkie of his left hand. “When you send official correspondence, you’ll seal it with your ring.”
“And you’d be able to track them down,” Hermione surmised. “It’s an interesting theory. Do you even know how to invoke it?”
Malfoy nodded. “Traditionally, we were de Malfoie. The Potters were Purohit. I guess both families decided to anglicise when they moved to Britain.”
“I’d still feel better if we had some sort of contingency,” Hermione piped up. “I could write up a contract but I’d need longer than we have. The only other thing I can think of is an Unbreakable Vow.”
Harry frowned. “What do you mean?”
Harry frowned. He didn’t know if he just wanted people joining his family for his money, and Malfoy looked seriously dejected. “Well, I’ll end up paying for them either way. You may as well keep being the Head of your House. I don’t want to be in charge of that many people.”
Hermione blinked in surprise. “You told Arthur?” she asked Ron.
Greyback nodded. “Three safe houses.”
Malfoy waved him off. “Not your fault,” he grunted, gratefully accepting a cup of tea from Kreacher.
Bill waved him off. “I have several of my own,” he said, pulling open his jacket. Like a drug dealer in a comical muggle movie, the inside of Bill’s jacket was lined with gris-gris bags and other objects, including a variety of weapons. “I’m not strictly meant to have any of these, mind you, but most curse-breakers do,” he admitted.
“That’s the idea,” George grinned. “Ogden’s recipe. Tastes like goblin’s piss for underage wizards and witches. Still alcoholic, though. Don’t know why he wouldn’t just make it non-alcoholic for the young ‘un’s…”
The werewolf nodded at the piece of parchment. “What’s that?”
“AK!” Harry shouted, letting the other two know there was a loose Killing Curse in the air, as he flung himself to the ground. He rolled and was back on his feet in time to send another curse at each of the Death Eaters. Both sidestepped easily. Crabbe aimed the Cruciatus Curse at Harry while Jugson caused half of the wall to Harry’s right to shoot forward. Harry sidestepped the Unforgivable easily, but that put him in the path of the incoming chunk of concrete.
“Yeah, well, I should’ve left the Dark Lord alone. It’s over, anyhow,” Malfoy said simply, nodding at Kreacher aristocratically when his breakfast was presented. He smirked slightly. “Who would’ve thought Mr. Perfect Gryffindor could be irresponsible?” he asked sardonically.
Draco hissed, “Mother!” His cheeks burned red, and Narcissa patted his hand, as mothers were wont to do after embarrassing their child. In other circumstances, the interaction would be almost normal, but Narcissa’s hand shook terribly as she performed the action, and Draco was eyeing Harry far too nervously.
Remus, no doubt sensing the heightened emotions and wanting to ease the tension, broke the silence. “Ron, Hermione,” he nodded at the two. “Good to see you.”
Malfoy nodded once. “I’d rather not put my life into your hands once again, but I follow the Old Ways. I give myself willingly.”
“Goyle Sr.,” Savage confirmed when he toed over the body. He’d been standing by the door when it blew; he would have been killed instantly. Leaving the body, they crept forward, emerging from the dust to the main hall of the warehouse. There were piles of clothing in separate corners, clearly being used as makeshift beds. A kettle was plugged in at an outlet and Harry almost laughed at the concept of Death Eaters taking tea. He would have made a comment, maybe, but the image of Goyle’s cold body was front and centre in his mind. Where were the other Death Eaters? The room was quiet. Too quiet.
“Well, you were a bit busy,” Malfoy reasoned, surprising Harry. He’d expected him to go for an easy jab at Harry getting special treatment.
Ginny sniffed in disdain. “Why on earth would he be there?”
Harry glanced down at it. The amount of money sent a chill down his spine and heat rush to his cheeks. Quickly passing it to Hermione, he nodded his thanks to Grannuff.
With Ron’s nod, they both used their wands to slice their hands open. Grasping each other’s palm tightly, Harry drew another circle with his wand and cast, “
Mrs. Weasley nodded. “Ginny’s upstairs in her room, and, from the noises, I think George is inventing in the attic,” she smiled at Harry with watering eyes. George was clearly having a good day if his spirits were still as high as they were that morning.
Hermione nodded as they turned back to the castle. “Could you see the magic?” she asked excitedly.
Harry didn’t even have time to acknowledge his victory over Crabbe, before Jugson unleashed another Unforgivable at him. Harry dived backwards, landing painfully on a piece of debris from the wall. He sat up and hurled a few attacks at the Death Eater. They weren’t specific spells or curses or hexes, but they hit the man hard. Before he could recover, Harry leapt to his feet and cast a paralysing curse at him. It hurtled towards Jugson, who blocked it easily and responded instantly with a curse of his own. They exchanged curses at a phenomenal rate, which would have even stressed the reflexes of Viktor Krum. As soon as Harry blocked one attack, there was another on the way. It soon seemed he hadn’t managed an offensive spell in ages.
Harry sighed but steeled himself. "I won’t do anything here. Give me the afternoon. I will find a place."
“A lot of people have died,” Harry said finally. “I’ll do what I can to keep that number as low as possible.” He didn’t have to voice that he would kill again if it made saving the lives of many.
Harry handed off Teddy to him. “Can you pop him in his crib? Be careful,” Harry warned. He hadn’t really trusted Kreacher to hold Teddy yet, although he was fairly confident the elf wouldn’t hurt Teddy. The baby was a Black, after all. “Get some towels, a bowl of hot water and some bandages,” he added, ripping Malfoy’s shirt open without hesitation.
Hermione deflated. “No.” At their looks she perked up and started to explain. “Malfoy how many life-debts do you owe Harry?”
Harry nodded, passing him the piece of paper. After reading it, Mr. Weasley passed it to his wife. “Hermione sent a letter to Bill about possible other wards for the long term,” the older wizard said.
Harry nodded quickly. For someone who had spent most of his life angry at the Ministry’s corruption, he was certainly very quickly getting comfortable with it.
“The interrogation process can be pretty rough, mum.” Ginny came to the rescue. “Maybe he started to feel guilty.”
Harry attempted to control his emotions as he called for Kreacher to take Teddy to the nursery. “Let him have half an hour of tummy time. I’ll be up soon.”
Robards nodded. “We’ll train and plan for Battle until Friday. Don’t make plans for the weekend. Keep your mouths shut about Potter’s involvement in the team until then. Since I still have you all for the rest of the morning, though, partner up. Cragg with Potter. Elfie, Kai. Savage, Proudfoot. Duel until I call time. No serious injuries, though. Work on mind invasion and defence, too. The Lestrange brothers are both scarily good at
Luna shrugged. “I don’t know if it’s good or bad, necessarily. It looks like your worried or feeling guilty about something, though.”
to get Harry to ask Malfoy out.
Ron shook his head. “Yes, I do. For Lavender.”
Robards levitated the bodies of Jugson, Crabbe, and Avery – absolutely wrecked by Proudfoot and Savage – and left Harry and Savage to be fussed over by two medi-witches.
“Excellent,” Malfoy complimented. “Do you have enough space in the stables to host the carriages?”
“Yes, Potter, you can use the dungeons,” Draco said uncertainly.
When Hermione arrived back from Hogwarts, she was out of breath. Gratefully accepting a cup of tea from her boyfriend, she groaned. “That was horrible.”
“Here,” Bill said, handing them to him. Harry tried to bury the thoughts of where the fabric had come from deep in the recesses of his mind. “Hold them in your wand hand, and then say what you wish it to bring the wearer in your strongest language. End the sentence with ‘So mote it be.’”
Harry surged forward, ending the silencing charm and calling for Hermione and Ron. Malfoy’s shirt was drenched in blood. Quickly, he levitated Malfoy to the couch, calling as he did so for Kreacher.
“I wouldn’t worry,” Luna said mildly. “She found a glamour that can cover most of them last year.”
Hermione lasted four steps before glancing down at her feet. “Granger, eyes up,” Malfoy admonished. “I’ll say it out loud. Back, back, left, left, forward, forward. See, easy,” he said, doing the opposite with his feet. “You only have to do it for 12 counts, anyway.” He released her fingers and closed the gap between their other hands. With a flick of her wrist, she twirled out. “Go under my arm,” Malfoy said. “Now, pull my hand across your body to your waist.”
“I don’t want to do it again,” Harry said.
hadn’t been his brightest idea. He eyed Draco cautiously, unsure as to how to respond without incriminating himself or Ron or Hermione or Bill.
“Thanks, Ron,” Harry smiled grimly. “I’ll cast it after dinner. Hermione, will you take Teddy to the Burrow for a bit? He just had a bath so hopefully he’ll be down for a few hours.”
Bellatrix smiled at him in a way he was sure was not meant to be threatening. “Why, of course. A vassal is an extension of his lord’s magic. In the same way one can find objects and wards of their own casting, so too can a lord find a vassal.” She paused and looked at him critically. “For you to succeed in this, you must first become a true lord – you must accept within yourself that you are your vassal’s rightful lord and that they belong to you. Is my lord Potter up for this task?”
Elfie shrugged. “Witch Weekly said you looked most dashing.”
Ron clapped Harry on the back. “It went better than it could have,” he tried.
Harry jutted out his chin. “Fine, I’ll give Narcissa double. I have more than enough, and you don’t. Besides, aren’t you the Lord of the Malfoy House.”
The Peverell gem was a greyish-white but seemed to be iridescent under the light from the sconces on the walls. According to Malfoy it was a labradorite, and the iridescence was called labradorescence.
Harry blinked. He hadn’t even known there was such a thing. “Sorry. I didn’t know. Never passed my test.” He frowned. He should probably tell Robards. It was probably not good that a Ministry employee was regularly breaking the law by apparating without a license.
They sat in silence. Hermione looked crushed. Her faith in a new, uncorrupted, good minister shattered. Ron was much harder to read. It was he who broke the quiet.
Malfoy rolled his eyes but stood up. “Well, it was hardly graceful, but it worked. Thanks, Potter,” he said, shaking Harry’s hand firmly.
“It’s too vague,” Ron said after a moment. “Your command needs to be more direct.”
“Yeah.” Harry grit his teeth. “I thought so.”
Harry made a noise that could be considered affirmative, stuffing his face with some chicken, hoping she wouldn’t press him for more information. Thankfully, she didn’t, although she looked at him suspiciously.
“Yes! Oh Ron, you’re brilliant,” Hermione exclaimed. “You’ll still be breaking several wards, but I’ve no doubt that it’ll work. The only problem is, you are the only person who can break those wards. It’ll be incredibly obvious to anyone who looked hard enough that you were the one to break him out.”
“Ginny’s still sixteen,” Ron said cheekily, ducking to avoid the mash potatoes that flew across the table.
Harry groaned, and rubbed a hand over his face. “Look, it was just a one-time thing, alright? Kingsley asked me to do it. I’m not on some vigilante mission to kill all Death Eaters,” he whispered furiously.
“Fuck, Harry,” Ron said after a minute.
“Suffer greatly,” Roslyn said helpfully, snapping her fingers as the final boxes disappeared. Harry wasn’t entirely sure how all of these things had accumulated – he only really wore a rotation of three shirts, one pair of jeans, and a jumper Molly had given him for Christmas in his sixth year – although, he supposed Hermione had “borrowed” a fair few books from the Black family library, and it seemed Draco was determined to completely transform his and Teddy’s wardrobes.
Harry nodded at him. “It’s nice to meet you. This is Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.”
“The next bit we do is essentially a grapevine. Potter, Weasley, you will be on your partner’s left, holding their hand with your right. We stand in a circle,” Malfoy instructed, grabbing Harry’s hand and pulling him so that they were standing opposite Hermione and Ron.
in first year. Sirius died because of a
Kingsley nodded grimly. “I had a feeling you would say that. I’ll arrange the meeting for the two of you.”
Harry, Proudfoot and Savage gripped on to the boot tightly as they started to spin rapidly and blinked out of existence.
Harry nodded, extraordinarily relieved. He didn’t think he could face this alone.
Harry shrugged. “I guess we use the manor.”
Cragg nodded. “That’s why I was able to block it. When I used legilimency I could practically hear you shouting the spell in your mind,” he paused and looked at Harry with scrutiny. “You’re very powerful, lad. I shouldn’t think you’d need to do that. Just will it to happen.”
Harry grinned, but quickly sobered, considering his options. “So, a war council you say? What do I do?”
Harry nodded- it was one of the first things Hermione had told him about the wand.
He glanced at the aurors in this room. He wondered if they’d decide follow him, like Ron and Hermione and Ginny and Neville and Luna and all of Dumbledore’s Army and all of the Order of the Phoenix had. He had no right to expect this, of course – he’d only known them for two days. He didn’t even want them to, he thought. He’d always hated his fame, had always hated that those around him always seemed to have to risk their lives for his. He thought about Fred. Glancing at Elfie, he was reminded of Colin’s still body after the Battle. He was so young – had so much in his future. He would have made an excellent journalist. A real one – not gossipy and corrupt and biased like Rita Skeeter, or as fundamentally mad as Xenophilius Lovegood (he loved the man’s daughter but Harry was willing to admit that they both were a little strange). He thought of Teddy and wondered about the life that he would grow up to have. What would he be like? Would he be a professor like his father? An auror like his mother? A criminal like Sirius (Harry certainly hoped not)? Whatever he became, though, he would be free to choose. Unlike Colin, and Fred, and Lavender, and all the other students who had died fighting for the world they wanted to live in – a world where Voldemort and his Death Eaters couldn’t and didn’t rule.
Suddenly, there were gasps and shouts and cameras flashing. Harry looked grimly at Hermione and Ron. They smiled sympathetically. Quickly casting a silencing bubble charm around Teddy, he marched with purpose to the front gate, in front of which the reporters were gathered.
Robards poured them all a glass of water, and Harry took one gratefully. “How long can you hold out on Unforgivables?” the auror asked, waving at a QuickQuotes quill as it began to take notes.
In the end, they only kept five of the objects: a crystal bottle filled with dove’s blood, which, when written with, would make a magical oath more binding; a silver dagger, which could keep a victim alive forever but in excruciating pain; a golden snuffbox filled with human ashes, which could cause a person to fall into an enchanted sleep; and two gris-gris bags made from a human burial shroud.
“Statistics?” Robards asked, turning to Cragg.
Elfie clapped him on the back. “Potter’s qualifications include defeating a Dark Lord, Cragg,” she teased. “Where’s that on your resume?” The older man rolled his eyes at her cheek.
“I don’t know,” Greyback answered.
Without speaking, he sliced his thumb open with a slash of his wand, allowing a few drops to spill onto the grass. Wards, suddenly visible to him, shimmered with gold, and he stepped through them. “Ron, Hermione, Teddy, come in,” he said.
Harry nodded. Teddy stirred in his arms and his hair turned black as he smushed his face further into Harry’s chest. Harry sighed. “I’m doing it for you, Ted,” he whispered quietly.
Malfoy nodded. “I’ll teach you. You too, Granger, Weasley. Speaking of, you’ll need a date who can dance. Who are you taking?”
The witch clearly already knew Harry well enough to read him like a book. Her expression reminded Harry of Hermione and Molly, so he decided to use the same argument on her. “They’re looking for me anyway.”
They were both breathless when they stood up, and Harry had to blink a few times to clear his thoughts from Draco Malfoy’s red lips and flushed cheeks contrasting with his pale skin.
Harry and Ron made for the glass door. Greyback was sitting at a desk, his hands in silver chains, smirking at them.
Harry’s eyes flashed dangerously. The portrait cackled. “Who is it then? If you tell me, I might just let you through,” she teased.
Neville took a long draw of his pint. “Yeah, I mean, it’s not a common thing, but it’s old tradition for you to take ownership of the wand of a person who has wronged you. I don’t think Gran’d want ownership, but it’s a nice gesture, you know?”
to the chest. They’re taking him to Mungo’s. He’ll be fine.”
Harry stared at it blankly. “It’s a dummy.”
“Couldn’t get in. Bastards had this place down like lock and key. Lestranges caught up to us. Both got away,” Robards said roughly. Harry’s stomach flipped. “What was all that just then?” Robards asked, just as accusingly.
Malfoy coughed awkwardly. “Anyway, there’s also Marjory Boot, Terry’s mother. I’ve never met her, but her son is quite sensible. He fought for your side.”
Harry had only had takeout a few times in his life, but he revelled in it, as it always featured in his favourite memories. Nights when the Dursley’s went out for dinner, and Harry would scrape around underneath the couch pillows for a few coins, order some pizza or some Indian with the house phone, and watch something on the telly that he wasn’t meant to touch.
Harry’s shoulder slammed into the waist of the Death Eater. As they tumbled to the ground, Harry felt the man lose his grip on his wand. Harry grabbed it without pause. Turning his own wand on the man, he rolled away, back onto his feet. He ducked a stray curse flying overhead, before casting an extremely powerful stunner and incarcerous on Crabbe.
Harry, Proudfoot and Savage instinctively formed a small triangle, keeping their backs to each other as they eyed the room for signs of life. Harry was about to cast a
Potter opened his mouth to argue back, but a voice interrupted them in the doorway. “He’s right, Harry,” Hermione said quietly.
Harry stored that information quietly. “Do you know anything else?”
Harry breathed slowly through his nose and the thunder stopped, although the clouds remained. “I don’t want Malfoy to be forced to do whatever I say. That’s something Voldemort would do.”
Harry nodded. They looked at each other in silence.
Harry looked taken back. “Why not? I don’t need anything from them. The war’s over.”
Ron passed Harry a small bottle. “Fred and George’s hangover cure. It’ll sober you up in five minutes. Fair warning: it’s not pleasant.”
The Death Eater to Jugson’s left was holding the fiendfyre, Harry realised. Something about the way he held himself reminded Harry of someone.
“Don’t worry about it,” Harry said. “Plausible deniability.”
“Oh, Harry,” Mrs. Weasley greeted him with surprise as she walked into the kitchen, Mr. Weasley and George on her heels. “Staying for breakfast?”
Harry frowned. “I’m sorry,” he said quietly.
With a pop, the house-elf appeared. “Master called?” he asked, slightly sardonically, before seeing the body lying on the couch. “Young Master Malfoy,” the elf whispered.
Ron nodded. “Greyback is impervious to Veritaserum, and the ministry hasn’t been able to get anything out of him through legilimency. He’s claiming he only worked for Voldemort during the war under duress. Kingsley is concerned he’ll walk free.”
“He told you about horcruxes,” Harry offered gently, before realising he was not only attempting to
Neville frowned. “That’s a darke object.”
Draco looked at him curiously. “I appreciate your concern, Potter. I really do. And yes, it will be uncomfortable, and I will hate every moment of it, but that is not what I was talking about. We are walking into a war council, because every person in there is fully aware that you tortured and killed Fenrir Greyback,” he said in a matter-of-fact tone.
Harry’s cheeks were no doubt brighter than a tomato by now. His eyes started to water, but he blinked them away. He’d always considered Ron and Hermione his family, but it filled his heart to know they thought of him the same way. He wiped the formula on Teddy’s chin with a muslin wrap. “Thank you,” he said quietly.
Harry winced. Savage and Elfie looked distinctly uncomfortable. The war had left many with empty stomachs.
Ron gagged as Harry shrieked. “What does that even mean?”
Ginny grinned cheekily at him. “Plus, he’s really fit.”
“Exciting,” Malfoy smiled genuinely. He turned thoughtful. “I wonder how the people will react.”
The house-elf looked quite dejected. “Mistress Black is not being well, Master. Is raving and screaming at Kreacher. Master Malfoy is calming Mistress down with potions.”
Ron smirked. “Nope, I’m not. No one would be able to keep you, anyway,” he smiled, kissing her on the cheek.
Mimsey squeaked. “Don’t get too close to it! It’s under a void,” she said, looking at the piece of muggle technology warily. Voids were very dangerous, very rarely used outside of the Department of Mysteries, as they prevented all magic within them. Ron wisely stepped back, but Hermione edged closer, looking fascinated.
Draco sighed. “You literally control my life. I’d rather a bit more interdependence, if that’s okay with you,” he said quietly to Harry.
Malfoy looked thoughtful. Finally, he nodded. “I was raised my whole life to be a noble Lord. I know how Potter needs to act, and I think I know how to use Potter’s influence to restore the Old Ways in wizarding society. If we do this right, we might be able to prevent another war.”
Over breakfast, he read over the letters Malfoy had put aside for him. Two were from Kingsley, with updates on Greyback’s trial and details regarding the meeting with Robards. Malfoy’s response was concise but cordial, thanking him for keeping Harry informed and involved. Harry was surprised at how much Malfoy’s words sounded like Harry’s, if a bit more thought-through and proper. One was from Hagrid, inviting Harry to lunch sometime this week. Malfoy had hit the nail on the head with his response, asking for him to come to Grimmauld Place instead. Harry loved Hagrid, but his food left a bit to be desired. Harry copied the letter word for word onto a new sheet of parchment but replaced Grimmauld Place with Potter Manor and explained a bit about the property.
Harry clenched his jaw as he took out his wand. “Let’s go, Bella,” he said quietly, and cast a strong
“Right,” Malfoy started. “Bow to your partner,” he instructed. Harry felt heat rising to his cheeks but was determined to not give Malfoy the satisfaction of him failing.
Harry nodded and handed back the man’s wand. “Thank you.”
to the chest.”
Hermione and Ron nodded at him. They stood in silence a few minutes longer, before Roslyn cleared her throat.
Closing his eyes again, he reached for the links that he knew were present. “
“I think Rabastan’s the brains,” Neville said. “Rodolphus always seemed a bit stupid to me.”
Ron gratefully passed Teddy into Harry’s willing arms. “I haven’t got a ring yet, but Ginny said she’s going to help. I’d never find one on my own.”
Harry rolled his eyes but smiled, cleaning up the mess. “Glad to see you’re feeling better.”
“So, an impatient leader,” Kai said. “An unstable second-in-command who vies for the chief position, and four torturous lumberjacks for lackeys. I reckon that if we draw them into battle, they’ll probably underestimate us.”
Years ago – even half a year ago – Harry would have let Malfoy’s words rile him up, but now all Harry could think about was the man’s insinuation that he cared for Harry. Instead of commenting, however, he simply nodded.
Two chapters for you today! I've been swamped with uni stuff, and I'm about to go into exams, so, hopefully, this will tide you over until I can write more. I've amped up the flirting a bit, and also made Draco more Draco-ish. I hope you enjoy. Keep sending lovely comments and kudos!
“Of course,” Kingsley said brightly, waving at the fireplace. He looked significantly relieved, as if a large weight was off his shoulders.
George rolled his eyes good-naturedly. “Relax, Malfoy. Ogden didn’t want bad flavours associated with his brand. So, only the good Bertie Bott’s flavours.” He gestured at the parchments being signed around the table. No one had declined to sign yet. “Thought we might need something stronger than lager.”
“Mr. Potter, how does it feel to be the saviour?” someone called. “Who are you dating, Harry?” another asked. “Will Hogwarts be ready by September?” “Why did you refuse the role of the Minister of Magic?”
“Master,” the house elf cracked into the kitchen.
Leaving a mildly guilty-looking Kingsley to his paperwork, the four made their way through the abandoned hallways of the ministry. The holding cells were on the second lowest level of the Ministry, just about the Department of Mysteries.
“Why does Weasley sound like he’s stomping on the keys?” Malfoy asked, shrugging off his jacket and handing it to Kreacher, who was standing at attention.
Roslyn scowled. “The house was placed under stasis, Master, when your parents passed. We kept working the gardens and the winery and assumed you would return to us when you turned eleven. Mr. Dumbledore told us this was not possible.”
Malfoy nodded. “I have. The only way you’ll get them off your case is if you threaten them.”
“What was that?” Ginny asked mildly.
Harry nodded. He still felt uncomfortable, but he really didn’t want to see Draco in pain like he had the other day. “Erm. Open the door for me.”
“That’s disgusting,” Hermione said, quickly dropping one of the bags.
Harry raised an eyebrow. There was something different about this painting. Its magic felt different – stronger even. In that moment he was incredibly grateful that Hermione was standing behind Ron. She did not need to see her torturer’s face again.  “Hello, cousin,” he said drily. “We’d like to get through to the dungeons.”
Harry frowned. “No offence, Ron, but the ministry wards are probably insanely difficult. None of us have any experience with them, outside of Hogwarts. I don’t think we’d be able to replicate them.”
Harry closed his eyes. Instead of thinking
Harry ran a hand through his hair. “I don’t know,” he said honestly. He could have easily stunned and tied up Jugson without using the Cruciatus curse. He glanced down at the wand still clutched in his hand. He hadn’t used the Elder Wand to cast it, either. With a few cursory checks, the Ministry could easily confirm that he’d used an Unforgivable. He glanced up at Robards.
“I found it in Sirius’ old stuff. I gather Remus, Sirius and my dad smoked a lot when they were teenagers,” Harry explained, feeling a touch of grief. “Sirius had loads of old muggle stuff – I think it was to impress Remus.”
“When you’re done with her, Harry, …,” Neville trailed off.
Placing Malfoy on the bed, he stood back to think. He called for Kreacher. “Keep an eye on him,” Harry told the elf. “If he wakes, come and get me. I’ll be in the nursery.”
“She’ll be thrilled, Ron,” Harry told him confidently. Teddy seemed to think so, too, as he blinked his eyes open and started fussing.
Harry looked at them blankly. Even Ron seemed to know what was going on now. “Can someone explain please?” he asked helplessly.
“Of course. I’m pleased to hear that Ms. Granger is returning. I have to admit, I’m hardly surprised at any of your decisions, though,” McGonagall said wryly. “I thought I should mention that if you would like to take your NEWTs, you can still sit the examinations with the other seventh and eighth years in June next year if you still wish.”
Harry nodded, clapping George on the back. “No worries, mate. Besides, you’re needed here to come up with a baby range of Wheezes.” George allowed a small smile at that.
“Well, it seems that the elf has some sense, after all,” Mrs. Weasley sniffed approvingly. She didn’t like Kreacher – anybody who had known him when Grimmauld Place was Headquarters didn’t understand why Harry kept him around – but she seemed to be warming to him.
Harry raised a brow, interested. “I’ve been working on it a lot – it’s far easier to control than through my wand.”
“This is weird,” Ron declared as he collapsed on a chair to Harry’s right.
“Thank you,” Malfoy nodded. “Can I see the ballroom? Potter will be hosting a ball for Midsomer’s. I’m sorry we’re only giving you limited warning.”
“He’s impervious to Veritaserum. None of us can break him. We cannot, legally, use a strong enough legilimency on him because it would literally cause his head to explode - his mental wards are too strong. We have two options. And both require you to do cast one or more extremely illegal spells so that this son of a bitch doesn’t end up prowling the streets again,” Kingsley explained. “You will not – and cannot – be charged with anything illegal; you and I will be the only people who know what you are going to do, your wand is the only one on earth that cannot be monitored by the ministry, and you can claim deniability because you do not know the law. I took an Oath. I cannot specify what spells or actions you should use, but, I implore you, for Remus, for Teddy, to not hold back. We need his information. We do not need him. If you do not, he will walk free. We simply don’t have enough evidence.”
“Mum. She went to visit when Lucius died,” Ron explained, shrugging. “Said that no one deserves to be alone in grief. She volunteers at Mungo’s a lot now, to keep her mind off Fred.”
Harry eyed it warily, reminded of Rita Skeeter. “I don’t know. I can resist the Imperius curse,” he said truthfully.
Harry grinned at her. “I’ll try my hardest to stay safe, Molly,” he placated.
“Not too bad,” Kingsley smiled tiredly. “I was up all of last night questioning Greyback under
Malfoy scoffed. “Not all of us are blessed with the power to apparate to wherever we like. Normal people are required to use Ministry-sanctioned apparition spots.”
Harry nodded. “Okay. Let’s go find him.”
Harry made his way to the back room, from which he could feel magic radiating strongly, and which had the tell-tale deafening wall of a sound-proof privacy ward. He probably should have knocked, and waited for the caster to grant him entry, but the ward barely resisted him as he walked in. He winced when he felt the ward snap.
“Excellent form, Potter,” Cragg was saying. “I can see why Robards let you on the team without qualifications.”
Harry grinned. “Well,
“No,” Harry balked. “We can’t do that. If Ron says he trusts him, I trust him.”
Malfoy shrugged. “Sure,” he said distractedly, his forehead creasing as he read what appeared to be a particularly confusing legal document.
“Oh?” Harry asked, watching as Ginny painted his little finger. “Is it a baby product?”
“Of course,” Harry said instantly.
“I’m really sorry, Nev,” Harry said quietly.
Harry shrugged. “Apparently a lot of people do, according to Hermione. I’m not planning on following up on any of them.”
Harry looked at him with trepidation. “I don’t know, Malfoy,” Harry said, biting his lip. “I don’t even know how to dance.”
He signed before passing the quill to Hermione, who signed just as quickly.
“Fine,” Harry waved a hand. “Go get us drinks then, please.”
“I suppose you’re right,” Hermione sighed after a minute of deliberating. She jutted out her chin stubbornly. “I still don’t like it.”
In the front of Ron’s mind was Harry’s own duel with Malfoy in second year. Harry tried really hard not to see what else was in his friend’s head, but mortifyingly saw a memory of Hermione in the throes of passion before he could pull back. “Gross, Ron. I really didn’t need to see that,” he said.
“Subtlety’s not your speciality, is it?” Harry commented drily.
Hermione frowned. “I thought you hated the Fidelius charm?”
Kingsley nodded calmly. He never seemed particularly put off by Harry’s anger issues. Harry supposed that was because he’d been there to witness the episode in Dumbledore’s office in fifth year. “I can see you’re firmly against that plan. No matter. Your plans for the next year – I understand you indicated that you wanted to be an Auror?”
Harry sat straight in his chair, feeling a bit ridiculous. Malfoy nodded his approval and took a step backward. Looking a bit embarrassed, he shrugged and knelt on one knee before Harry. Harry was so startled that he barely heard Malfoy speak.
“Of course, Harry,” the minister said warmly, shaking his hand. “Before I let you go, you mentioned Draco Malfoy. Do you need me to send some aurors to ensure he doesn’t come back?”
Harry grinned and leisurely walked to the local place, revelling in the cool evening breeze. On his way, he popped into an off-license and bought some chocolate. Years of staring daggers across the Great Hall at Malfoy fortunately meant that Harry was quite knowledgeable of the man’s taste in food. No matter the occasion, Malfoy would nearly always be eating chocolate, and Harry suspected he hadn’t eaten it in a while.
Everyone simply nodded. He wasn’t wrong.
The elf nodded. “I am Roslyn. This is Mimsey,” she said, indicating the elf who had spoken before, “and this is Hokka.” The last elf was larger than the other two and remained silent as he looked at Harry with scrutiny but nodded in deference as he was introduced.
“What happened?” Harry asked, turning to Robards accusingly.
Harry had his wand in his hand before he even opened his eyes, and his attacker was in an
“Excellent. Robards is thrilled to have a full team again. I’m glad Cragg’s come out of retirement. It’s a bit of an honour, really. He left in 1959 when Ignatius Tuft took over as Minister and refused to come back until the Ministry was under a leader that wasn’t corrupt. It’s a low bar, but I’m glad he believes that I’m above it,” Kingsley said, indicating that Harry should take a seat. The Minister waved his wand in an arch and raised several privacy wards around his office. “You’re not going to like what I have to say next.”
Harry shrugged. “My mum and dad I guess. And Sirius and Remus.”
“Thanks, Robards, totally couldn’t have figured that out ourselves,” Savage said sarcastically, rolling up her sleeves and revealing a sleeve of moving tattoos on her left arm.
She blushed fiercely. “Honestly, Harry. You know I’d never. I’m just remarking that its interesting.”
“Merlin’s saggy ball sack,” Ron’s voice cried from downstairs. “What happened here?”
The man let out an unholy scream as he dropped to the floor. Just then, Harry heard the others – Robards, Cragg, Elfie and Kai – finally breach the door. Harry wasn’t paying attention, though.
Robards turned to Harry. “Potter?” he asked. Harry was surprised – he hadn’t thought he’d be involved in the decision-making process. “It’s your life on the line,” the Head Auror said by means of explanation.
Fortunately, Harry didn’t have time to respond because Cragg and Robards swept into the room.
Kreacher popped away and re-appeared with a tray of sandwiches and a large mug of coffee. “Kreacher and Roslyn is finished the packing.”
When it was just the three of them, Harry reached for his wand and cast every privacy spell he could think of. He was keen to follow Cragg’s advice to develop his wandless magic, but there was something comforting about the certainty of a spell cast with a wand.
As everyone agreed quietly, Harry refilled everybody’s glasses with a. wave of his hand.  “I need to tell you all something,” he glanced at Neville nervously. “Bellatrix isn’t dead.”
Fortunately, half of his problem had been solved already through the combined efforts of Kreacher and Roslyn.
Malfoy swallowed. “Erm, you need to help with interrogations,” he said quietly, instantly dropping his aristocratic tone.
“Speaking of, Ron, there’s a Weasley on this list,” Harry said, attempting to stop them from discussing just how depressing his family situation was. “Cedrella Weasley.”
Roslyn nodded. “This wall can be removed,” she suggested, waving a hand at a wall covered in mirrors. The wall melted into the ground, pooling before forming into a delicate marble staircase that led down to the gardens.
“Get something to eat and suit up. Portkeys leave in an hour.” Robards instructed and left the room, his dark red cloak flapping behind him in a way that reminded Harry – almost fondly – of Snape. Cragg followed with less flair.
Elfie shrieked with laughter. “I’d crush you, old man,” she called over her shoulder as she made her way to the showers.
“We will talk about this later,” Hermione growled, deciding against having a full-scale verbal spar outside the DMLE Headquarters.
. It will be a full trial from the Wizengamot, so you’ll have to be there,” Kingsley said. Harry nodded. He was going to be there whether he was needed or not. There was no way Harry was raising Teddy in a world where Fenrir Greyback walked free.
“By all means, embarrass yourself and your girlfriend, who is way out of your league, by the way,” Malfoy sneered. Ron scowled, but it was enough for him to begrudgingly place Hermione’s hand in Harry’s.
Harry nodded absently, his mind already filled with thoughts of vassals and lords. “Have you ever heard of the right of conquest before?” he asked as he dressed quickly in the robes Hermione thrust at him. “I think we may be able to find the Lestranges with it.”
Malfoy sat down on the couch with none of his usual grace. “She only just went to sleep,” he grunted, covering his face.
Bellatrix fell to both of her knees. “Please. I’ll do anything, my lord,” she begged, her head bowed in fear. “Please don’t let me die.”
“See you later boys,” Hermione said, stepping into the floo.
“Merlin’s tits, this is like watching kink negotiation,” Seamus scoffed, ignoring Dean’s elbow as it jabbed into his side. “Right, enough with all that. Let’s get drunk and talk about taking over the world.”
Draco smirked as the magic of the Debt settled over the both of them. “Never knew you were so possessive, Potter,” he drawled.
Bill thought for a moment. “Sure, I can do that. The wards in the prison block are fairly simple actually. I’ll need help though.”
“You have a baby,” Malfoy noted after a while.
Folding it in thirds as Hermione showed him, he poured a bit of dark red melted wax that was sitting in a small bain-marie onto the letter and pressed his signet ring onto it.
With a pop, Harry and Malfoy landed in a shady corner about five blocks from the muggle pub Neville had booked. He glanced at the blond questioningly.
Roslyn asked the three to stay for dinner, and pointedly asked when Harry was going to move in. “This house has gone far too long without a master,” Roslyn said sadly.
Harry shrugged. “Remus’ mum was a muggle,” he explained. “Sirius was a pureblood. I guess he wanted to show that he was interested in Remus’ lifestyle.”
“They were waiting for us. Someone must have told them you were coming,” Ron complained as he stepped in front of Harry in a show of support.
“It’s Hermione,” Seamus shrugged. “Worse thing she’ll do with it is make little voodoo dolls of us that make us study or be more organised.”
Harry nodded. They had discussed it at length. Hermione was keen to finish her studies, but both Ron and Harry were unsure. He thought about it for a bit. “How many death eaters are unaccounted for?” he asked suddenly.
Speaking of, how awesome does this place look? I'd kill to live here.
Harry raised an eyebrow. “That’s definitely confidential,” he said.
By the time Harry returned to Grimmauld Place, Ron took one look at his face before pulling him into a hug.
“If you want,” Harry shrugged.
Ron groaned as he stretched out on the floor. “But I’m comfortable here,” he complained. “And the kitchen is so far away.”
“I reckon it’s not the first time Harry’s had to do something he was too young for,” a shy voice attempted to drawl from behind them.
Harry gulped, remembering the magical dance they had shared that afternoon. Yes, he was. He was seducing Draco Malfoy.
Ron sighed wearily but nodded. “Alright.”
Harry was trying to burp Teddy in the kitchen when Malfoy made his next appearance the following morning.
“Oh,” Harry said, taken aback. “Sorry, I don’t know any French,” Harry admitted.
Harry shuddered as the magic flowed over him. “You dumb shit!” he exclaimed, pulling Draco to his feet. “Haven’t we got enough bonds and vows and debts? The magic will fuck with us, and I don’t want to order you around anymore. Do you not remember what happened the other day?”
Greyback shifted. “Potter,” he spat, finally blinking off the last of the confounding charms.
With a kiss on the cheek, Harry left Ginny’s room feeling lighter than he had in a long time.
Cragg frowned. “What do you do when you cast wandless magic?”
“Depends on how much Pepper Up you drank,” Malfoy said, frowning. “You don’t want to get too reliant on it, Potter. It’s addictive.”
Harry nodded and made his way over to Neville and Luna, who were sitting quietly at the other end of the table. He noticed they were holding hands and smiled slightly.
Harry didn’t need to be told twice. Without glancing down, he moved through the motions of a waltz, keeping his eyes on Malfoys. This new position required them to be much closer, and Harry let a smile grace his lips as he stared into the pools of silver that were Malfoy’s eyes. Malfoy released on of his hands. “Now, with the hand that was behind your back, Granger, move to hold hand through the diamond that your arms make in front of your face.”
“A lot of our adventures were fun at the beginning,” Hermione joked.
Harry grinned. “Thank you, sir. May we use your floo to depart? I don’t want to go downstairs again.” He asked politely.
Harry closed his eyes and felt out for magic in the air. Magic was always stronger in natural areas, but this area of Devon seemed so industrial that there was barely anything of note. He pushed his senses further. There. About two-three thousand feet ahead of them, an extremely powerful and darke ward stood erect, protecting the warehouse from anything the aurors may do.
Ron shrugged and wrapped his arms around him anyway. “You often do. Still need a hug sometimes.”
Malfoy looked amused. “What use could you possibly have for a muggle lighter?” he asked as they headed for Harry’s house.
As soon as Malfoy was returned to Harry’s side by a disgruntled Ron, he reached for the blond’s hand. Malfoy took it as if it were the most natural thing in the world. “Turn to face your partner,” he said. “Boys, with your left hand, hold their right above your head, like you did before. Granger, reach behind your back with your other hand and find Weasley’s.” As he spoke, he placed his other hand delicately in Harry’s. “Now, waltz,” he instructed.
Ron looked at him through the corner of his eye. “Actually, I wanted to ask you something,” he said, seriously.
“Hermione told me you got Avery, Jugson, Crabbe and Goyle,” Malfoy said.
Luna smiled up at him, not moving from her seat. “Sorry for not standing, Harry. This room is absolutely full with nargles, and Dad has a theory that they’re less likely to attack you when you’re seated.”
” he began quietly. “
“Your family rings,” Malfoy said by way of explanation. “Put them on your right ring-finger,” he said, showing Harry his hand. Placed on his right ring-finger was a silver band, much like those in the box, with a deep blue gem in the middle.
Harry calmed instantly. If Hermione was pretty sure it’d be okay, it would probably be okay. He sighed and raked a hand through his hair. He pulled Draco closer and lowered his voice. “The debt needs orders? Fine. No more stupid Oaths, Vows, Pledges or Debts unless you talk to me first,” Harry nearly growled.
Harry glanced down at Teddy, and, since his face was currently smushed into his chest, he unwrapped him from the sling and cradled him in his eyes. Turning his body sideways, he said quietly, “Look, Teddy. It’s our dads.” Teddy gazed at the portrait
Harry rolled his eyes. “I know that, Hermione,” he said dryly. Ron, Hermione and Malfoy looked at him in shock. Harry shrugged. “He raised me to be a slaughtered. He kept me at the Dursley’s because the blood wards were strengthened whenever I spilled blood on their land. I’m not exactly his biggest fan,” he laughed humourlessly. “He did what he had to, to kill Voldemort. So did I.”
“Harry!” somebody was shouting. He felt an arm on his elbow. “It’s over. Stop.”
The man growled and turned his attention to Harry. “Don’t talk about my son, Potter,” he said angrily, dropping the fiendfyre and shooting a stunner at Harry. “Stupefy!”
She avoided his eyes. “Okay, what you have before you are magical contracts, imbued with the power of a Wizard’s Oath,” she said, pressing on despite Harry’s splutters of indignation. “It’s really very similar to the contract I had you sign at the beginning of DA. Except, this time, the punishment won’t be some nasty pimples – it’ll be a fairly strong memory charm.”
“You bet. I’m starved,” Ron joked.
Robards let out a chuckle. “Fair enough.” He glanced down at his notes, before nodding. “Alright, Potter, you can join the task force. I’m not a huge fan of your plan, but I think it’ll be our best chance at drawing them out. Come for training tomorrow and I’ll introduce you to the team,” Robards said, rising to shake Harry’s hand.
“Fine,” Harry groaned. He shrugged on his cloak. “See you tomorrow,” he said to Robards as the three made for the door.
As a group, they poorly managed to do a very basic grapevine (or shuffle, in Ron’s case) to the right. “Again,” Malfoy said, moving in the opposite direction. Harry resisted the urge to look at his partner.
Harry raised an eyebrow. “Speak plainly, Malfoy.”
“Pansy?” Malfoy laughed. “She wouldn’t touch my dick with a 10-foot pole even if I wanted her to.”
“It’s never been cast on me,” Harry said.
Glancing at Ron and Hermione, he grabbed a handful of floo powder and threw it at the hearth. “The Ministry,” he said, trying to muster up some courage.
George actually shoved him then. “I want you to get your head out of your arse!” he shouted, forgetting the fact that their conversation was meant to be quiet. He lowered his voice quickly. “I’m not talking about Death Eaters. You know what I’m talking about. The ministry’s corrupt, Azkaban is easy to break out of, and Voldemort’s supporters are still out there. You say the Old Ways aren’t necessarily dark, fine. But I don’t want Teddy to have to go through what we did. Fleur and Bill are trying for a baby. There’s no way I’m letting those kids fight in a war. You’re in a position to make real change, Harry. So, do it. Change the fucking world. Or there might not be a world left.”
the plan?” Greyback sneered. “Your aurors couldn’t get anything from me. There are only a few legal ways to make someone break.”
Bill considered for a moment but nodded. “Yeah, that’ll work. I’m in.”
“No, you won’t be able to access thoughts you don’t want the other to see, but I just mean it’s a bit more intense than what you’ve already got. Not to mention, it’s ancient and therefore incredibly risky,” Hermione warned.
Malfoy groaned. “Weasley, come and dance with me. Granger and Potter can dance together.”
Harry smiled and went back to casting. “
Malfoy stood up and grimaced. “Next, we visit your manor.”
Harry perked up at that. “You really think I have any?” he asked eagerly.
Harry shuddered at the thought of the Lestrange brothers ‘belonging’ to him. “What about your life source, then? Can I locate it in the same way?” he asked curiously. “You told me it was in the Forbidden Forest, but I’ll need more information than that.”
They neared the last block. Draco paused, looking at Harry. “You are aware that we’re entering a war council, yes?”
Harry smiled tiredly. “That sounds wonderful.”
“Sorry,” he apologised to no one in particular. He re-erected the ward quickly with a wave of his hand (making sure that the ward would grant Draco access), before turning to face everyone.
“I should think so, you are their Lord,” Malfoy scoffed. “You might not have been raised in the Old Ways, but they were. I would recommend inviting them to a Pledge.”
Just short of an hour later, the three were dressed semi-formally, and were dropping Teddy off at the Burrow. Harry dressed as Malfoy had directed, and Ron and Hermione were both wearing plain black robes over some training blacks that Malfoy had procured them.
Harry blinked. He hadn’t even considered it. “I wasn’t thinking,” Harry admitted. “But anyway, the last time we did that without warning, Ron ended up splinched.”
Kingsley looked into Harry’s eyes with an expression he’d never seen the man wear before. “Harry. Greyback is a bad person. He’s killed hundreds, maybe thousands. Ruined even more lives by turning people. Remus was forever considered a second-class citizen because of what this man did.”
Kai shrugged. “Well, it was pretty cool – living in a magical castle and all that. From what I gather, though, it was a bit more like a normal muggle highschool than Hogwarts. We had to take a certain amount of non-magical subjects. Math, Literature, Science, Muggle History.”
“Harry Potter. Are you going to become an Auror?” a reporter asked. “Will you marry me, Harry?” a middle-aged witch shouted. “What do you think of The Weird Sisters’ new album?” “Are you going to complete your NEWTs?” “Are you going to run for Minister?” “Do you think the death-eaters should be given the dementor’s kiss?”
“I always have them on me,” he admitted quietly. Harry released a breath. He should have been just as prepared. Of course, someone else would know about horcruxes.
Harry’s nostrils flared angrily, but he tried to reign in his temper. “No offence, Minister, but I do not have much faith in the ministry to find a suitable home for a war orphan,” Harry said pointedly. “Besides, Teddy is a Black. He has no living family that weren’t death eaters. He’s my godson – Remus and Tonks made it clear that he was to be in my care, if they should pass.”
On the first basement level, Harry had Ron put out the lights. He opened the door silently and peeked around the corner. To the right stood two guards chatting quietly. They were standing in front of a large glass cell in which a snarling Fenrir Greyback was imprisoned. He let the door close.
Malfoy sighed, but shrugged. “If you’re sure.” He turned to Roslyn. “Can she borrow the Potter jewels?”
“Why would we discuss the Statute of Secrecy?” he asked, not wanting to think about the Dementors any longer than strictly necessary.
Harry grinned, feeling much better all of a sudden. “You’d really do that for me?”
Ron smiled grimly. “You want in?”
The page was soon covered in scribbles. There were more names than Harry could count. Ron looked sick as he read over Harry’s shoulder.
At Proudfoot’s nod, Harry opened the door just enough to peek through with a flick of his hand. At first glance, the room seemed empty, and Harry was about to push the door further open, but Savage caught his hand.
Malfoy shrugged. “According to Dumbledore, we should work with the muggles. Use their knowledge and power to develop and introduce them to magic so that they can develop too.”
Hermione grinned at Harry. “I think I would like your mum, Harry,” she said softly. Turning to Roslyn, Mimsey and Hokka, she asked, not unkindly, “Are you happy working here? Wouldn’t you rather be free?”
Roslyn led them down the stairs into a bright kitchen with a small dining table. Opening what appeared to be a regular cupboard, Roslyn stepped through to reveal a large potion’s lab. “She didn’t live here for long, but your mother spent a lot of time in here,” the elf said, her voice laced with regret. “Mistress Lily was very kind. She taught me to read.”
Dean rolled his eyes affectionately at his fiancé. “He was a bit nervous about seeing Malfoy,” he admitted, rising to clap Harry on the back. “It’s great to see you, though.”
“Let’s just cross that bridge when we get to it,” Hermione laughed. “What about you, Harry? Are you going to take up Robards’ offer?”
Malfoy managed to down half of the can before he started spluttering. His eyes were bright as he looked at Harry. Harry couldn’t hear what he was saying, however, too distracted by the sight of Malfoy. He looked dishevelled, but in the best possible way, with flushed cheeks, sparkling eyes, and the first few buttons of his shirt undone, exposing his long neck.
Harry leant against the wall, watching the werewolf carefully, waiting for the spell to wear off. He summoned a piece of parchment and a quill and scribbled on it.
Malfoy inhaled sharply and shook his head. “I can’t. I can’t control myself around Dark magic.”
Harry rolled his eyes. Fred and George had started bowing to him at the beginning of sixth year, despite his protests. It shocked him slightly to see George do it now, though, as he hadn’t seen the twin so much as smile at anybody since the battle.
“A portrait is but a glimmer of one’s true self. I do not wish to be trapped here in this temporary light. My husband commissioned this for me against my wishes. He did not know me very well,” she said. Harry understood, and he even felt a twinge of sympathy for the woman.
Harry almost spat out his pumpkin juice. “Excuse me. Who, exactly, am I bonding with?”
“From your reaction, I can see that you do. I tell you what. I am willing to strike a deal,” he said calmly. “I need to know the truth. Where is your soul? Your life source?”
Hermione took pity on him. “A family book is all of the written records pertaining to a wizarding family. You really should have been given the Potter and Black ones when you turned seventeen, but we were kind of busy.”
Harry nodded tiredly. He raised a hand and willed the privacy wards to drop. They did. “May I use your floo to leave, sir?” he asked with no trace of the malice that had been in his voice only moments before. “I can’t bear to face the crowds.”
Harry frowned. He hadn’t known Narcissa was quite that unwell. “Did Malfoy say he needed anything?”
Harry looked at him in surprise. “You thought I was testing you,” he said after a minute.
Turning to Ron, he smiled grimly. “I’ve removed it. Let’s do this quickly.”
“That’s how Lucius knew that the diary would open the chamber of secrets,” Harry muttered. It had confused them all when Lucius was interrogated. He had no knowledge of horcruxes. Bellatrix must have told him what to do with it. “Thank you, Bella. Let us through to the dungeons now. I will come back to speak with you later.”
Harry frowned, “Bonding sounds really extreme though, doesn’t it? It sounds like we’re going to be connected.”
Draco startled slightly, clearly still not used to being referred to by his first name. His cheeks went pink as he waved his wand and several pieces of parchment floated to each person.
Schooling his expression into one less of shock and one (hopefully) more cool and nonchalant, Harry greeted Malfoy with a nod, handing over his tea.
“Thirty-seven,” Malfoy said shortly.
Harry shuddered at the idea of Voldemort being his counterpart, but nodded at the goblin, allowing the subject to drop.
Harry took the stairs three-at-a-time until he reached Sirius’ old room, which, despite the new furnishings and a rudimentary dusting, courtesy of Kreacher, still had several inappropriate muggle posters permanently stuck to the walls. Wrapping his godfather’s jacket tighter around him, Harry collapsed into the large four-poster bed (jarringly Gryffindor-red and contrasting greatly with the moss-green carpet), downed two bottles of Dreamless Sleep, and let the darkness swallow him whole.
Harry rolled his eyes. Proudfoot’s snide remarks were almost as bad as Malfoy’s. “You weren’t in Slytherin, were you?” he asked.
Harry frowned. He’d ask Kingsley this afternoon if he had any ideas.
Harry wandered upstairs to have a shower. As he passed the place where Walburga Black’s portrait used to hang, Harry shuddered. He couldn’t wait to get out of this house.
George grinned and leapt up from the bed after taking another swig of firewhiskey. “I shall begin at once!”
Greyback’s face went blank. Harry ended the torture spell and waited to see if the werewolf would be able to break out. After two or three minutes, he turned to Ron.
The last question made Harry pause even as more things were shouted at him, but he could feel Hermione tighten her grip on his arm. Glancing up, he saw her shake minutely.
“Me too,” Harry said quietly. He’d have loved to have a family growing up. He supposed these people wouldn’t have been available to him, as they were all connected through the Black line, but still.
Ron and Hermione gasped as they entered the wards. “Bloody hell, mate,” Ron laughed, clapping him on the back. “You’ve got a bloody castle!”
“Right,” Robards said louder, calling everybody over. He pulled out three tiny shoes from his pocket and enlarged them to their normal sizes. He gave the croc to Kai and Cragg, the latter of whom held the neon green shoe out like it personally offended him. “Left-back.” He gave a bright red heel to Elfie. “Right-back.” Finally, he passed a black boot to Harry, Proudfoot and Savage. “Be sensible. Be quick. Bring them back alive,” Robards said calmly. He glanced at his watch. “10 seconds. Good luck.”
Harry felt mildly defensive. “No one took the time to explain it to me.” He glanced at the others at the table, and took his seat, feeling they were going to be here a while. “Since it’s so important, someone take the time now,” he demanded.
“Merlin give me strength,” Harry heard Malfoy mutter under his breath. The fireplace chimed, and Malfoy snatched Harry’s wand from his pocket. “Go and get the proper one. I’ll greet the goblin. Be quick about it,” he ordered, and paced off to the living room angrily.
“Your confession,” Harry supplied, passing it through the bars.
Robards blinked. “Very good. How about Cruciatus?”
Harry frowned. Kreacher had certainly never done that for him before. Glancing at Malfoy, he realised that it was the first time he had seen Malfoy’s left arm since that night on the Astronomy Tower. His dark mark was gone.
“Potter,” he snarled. “Didn’t expect you to be my knight in shining armour.”
Draco looked surprised but shook the offered hand without hesitation. He turned to everybody else. “Despite Longbottom’s generosity, I am not worthy of your forgiveness. I know I’ve already said this all in letters already, but I think it needs to be said out loud. I wasn’t just a right dickhead, Potter. I was a terrorist and a racist. Nothing I will ever do will atone for the sins I committed against you, against Muggles, against the Wizarding World and against humanity,” he said gravely.
“Hey Kreacher. How were the Malfoys?” Harry asked anxiously.
Hermione and Ron didn’t need to be told what to do. When they emerged several minutes later, both looked slightly grey.
Bill placed the body on the seat, and the papers on the desk. Together they fixed the wards and made their way up to Kingsley’s office. He wasn’t there. Easier to deny the blood on his hands, Harry supposed. He glanced down at his own.
This one was hard to write. It's all a bit exposition-y for me so far. I hope I can maintain your interest.
Walburga raised a thin eyebrow and looked at him with scrutiny. “Just because you’ve claimed your inheritance does not mean you are a true son of Black, boy,” she spat.
“Granger very kindly had Kreacher retrieve Potter’s family books for me,” Malfoy drawled, accepting a cup of tea from Hermione with a nod of thanks.
Malfoy smirked. “My cousin keeping you up at night then, Potter?”
Ron entered the room. He moved to stand next to Harry, arms crossed. “What’s the plan?”
“Are there any other magical creatures here?” Harry asked, thinking of Hagrid. He would love the gardens here, he thought with a pang of guilt. Since the battle, Hagrid had been working hard to rebuild his hut and care for Grawp, who had been quite badly injured. Harry hadn’t seen the half-giant nearly enough in the past month.
Malfoy sighed sadly. “It’s not just a saying, you know. Our magic becomes weaker if we don’t provide it with the proper respect.”
“Only if you call me Harry,” he said.
Looking at Hermione questioningly, she explained. “Ron has decided, instead of pursuing his education, to join George at the shop,” she looked mildly disapproving, but Harry knew she was secretly pleased. Glancing at the brothers, Harry realised he hadn’t seen either of them look so happy and relaxed in years.
Hermione smiled tiredly. “Nothing bad. Just reporters wanting me to answer some questions. A few had ‘volunteered’ with McGonagall to help with the rebuilding, but really they just wanted an excuse to get closer.”
Harry nodded. “Yes, yes, I know I got them like a month ago. But what about it is making Malfoy so stressed?”
“Not likely,” Harry chuckled darkly. “Let us through, Bella. Or I will destroy you.”
Ron rolled his eyes. “But mum’s made porridge!” he protested.
Harry frowned. “I can’t do that on purpose,” he admitted. “It’s accidental magic.”
This one is still a bit expositiony - sorry! Hopefully it's still interesting. The bonding will be next chapter. :)
“Impedimenta,” Robards cast. Harry batted it away with the elder wand and cast a strong knockback jinx instead, raising an eyebrow.
“Can’t apparate inside the Ministry, Harry,” Hermione reminded him gently, but she was looking a bit green too. “Maybe Kingsley will let us use his floo again.”
“Love can make people do terrible things,” Malfoy shrugged. “Anyway, don’t expect me to refer to Weasley by anything other than his last name, unless you want me to demonstrate my proficiency at coming up with fantastic insults. Besides, learning his first name would require me knowing which of the red-head brood he actually is.”
Harry raised a brow. “Why wouldn’t he be?”
“They’ll be fine,” Ron said with confidence, although he kept checking his watch.
Draco shrugged. “Not especially, but you need a few minutes alone with them so they can badger you with all the questions they won’t want to ask when I’m there.”
“Scared, Potter?” Malfoy smirked at Harry’s hesitation. His voice was so familiar, and baited Harry in just the right way.
Malfoy shook his head. “Just because there are no wizards or witches with the last names of Potter, Black, Peverell or Gaunt walking around, doesn’t mean there are now members of the houses. Anybody connected paternally to a family line, unless they are the heir or Head of another house, is under your protection. My mother, for example, is a member the Black house.”
Harry nodded in confirmation but frowned slightly. He wasn’t sure he wanted the public to find out about all of this just yet. The dressmaker reassured him. “Lord Potter, we have dressed and fitted the Heads of the most Ancient and Nobel Houses of Britain for centuries. We pride ourselves on our integrity and discretion. If you so wish, however, we can make an Oath that no one outside these four walls will hear of this meeting.”
"That should be possible," Kingsley said after a moment.
Roslyn smiled. “You will look beautiful, Mistress Hermione,” she said quietly.
,” Harry muttered, dragging the elder wand in a large circle. He could hear Savage and Proudfoot casting the same thing. Harry reached forward with his magic and started breaking the links at the top of the shield. “Argutus,” he chanted, hoping that by breaking each of the links individually, the death eaters wouldn’t have a clue that someone was bringing down the wards.
“Just tap your wand against your ring, and think of where you want to go,” Malfoy said. “It will be under stasis, so when you get there you’ll be the only one who can see it. You’ll have to bleed two drops on the ground, and then invite Granger and Weasley in. I imagine there’ll be house elves there. They’ll walk you through the rest.”
“Malfoy – “Harry grabbed the sleeve of Malfoys arm but paused, not sure what to say. “Your mother – she grew up here, yes?”
“Here,” Ron said, summoning two zip-lock bags from the kitchen. It turned out that muggles were far more advanced than wizards when it came to food preservation. He placed each of the gris-girs bags in them and put one in Hermione’s pocket. “I know it’s gross, but it’ll keep us safe,” Ron said, pocketing his own.
Malfoy looked at her appraisingly. “You continue to surprise me, Granger.”
“I wished that you and Harry could come to the Quidditch World Cup with us in Fourth Year. I was certain his muggles would say no,” Ron offered. “The next year, I decided to be a bit more vague.”
Harry shuddered, remembering the train station and Voldemort’s creepy toddler body. “Yeah, not sure I want to risk it.”
Harry frowned. He’d seen the Lovegood’s house and didn’t imagine they had much to share. “I will provide Narcissa with an allowance. And I’ll pay you for your work.”
When they had caught their breaths, Hermione turned to Harry. “What happened?” she asked quietly.
“What?” Harry asked. He blinked. He supposed, to Draco, it would be like a war council – not many people invited had particularly fond feelings for him. “If you don’t want to come, you absolutely don’t have to. But I promise everyone will be on their very best behaviour. There’s nothing a few drinks and conversations about quidditch can’t make less awkward. Besides, Neville said he’s on your side. And you know Luna, Hermione, Ron and I are.”
Harry made his way to his locker and opened it. Inside, along with his backpack and another pair of shoes that he’d brought the other day, a black vest had magically appeared.
Malfoy scoffed. “Of course not. That’s when you threaten physical repercussions.” At Harry’s look, he amended. “Not bad ones. And not overtly. Just do that thing that you sometimes do when you make it thunder or whatever.”
“We have managed to locate the blueprints for the warehouse,” Cragg said. “It last went for sale in 1968, so we can assume it has some pretty powerful protections over it, probably made by Voldemort himself. We should be prepared to have to perform blood sacrifice to see the building.”
Harry bowed low over Malfoy’s hand, his eyes not leaving the blond’s even for a moment. Malfoy’s cheeks were slightly pink as he ducked his head in a delicate imitation of a curtsey.
Hermione nodded. “I can ask George what he thinks of your idea, Ron.”
As they were making their way done the stairs, Ron turned to Hermione and asked, “You don’t really mind that I’m not going back to Hogwarts with you, do you ‘mione?”
Hermione walked in but paused in the doorway when she saw Harry. Harry blushed at her as he quickly stepped away from the couch.
Hermione and Ron entered, although they slowed down when they took in the scene. It wasn’t every day one saw Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy eating together, after all.
Everyone complied readily, but Draco muttered darkly, “Have you any idea about how many horrible curses can be cast with access to your blood?”
“I’d love to come, Harry,” she said, pointedly ignoring her boyfriend. “It’ll be fascinating.”
“The rose garden was a particular favourite of your grandmother,” Roslyn said, pointing to a small, blooming area encircled by ramparts. “They bloom year-round, and pixies can often be found there.”
Ron grabbed her suddenly and kissed her firmly. Harry turned his gaze to Teddy as he strolled off to the kitchen, leaving his two friends to enjoy their moment.
Not waiting for them to respond, he spun around and walked towards the lifts with Hermione and Ron close on his heels, the doors closing before any of them could think to follow him. “Bloody hell,” Harry complained. “I’m apparating home.”
“Jesus Christ,” Draco muttered.
When they got back to Grimmauld Place, Ron was playing piano. Hermione was spending the morning at Hogwarts, helping with the rebuilding effort.
Glancing down at the wand thrumming in his hand, he sighed. This was certainly going to take getting used to, he thought.
“Congratulations, Seamus,” Harry laughed. “You’ve had a few pints already then?”
Harry nodded, handing her the sheet of paper. “Come around whenever you like. Fair warning: Malfoy might be there.”
Harry shook his head. “It’s okay, I can see a snake,” he said, going back in. Ignoring the image of Hermione, which was now even further forward in Ron’s mind, despite desperate attempts from both of them to push it back, Harry could see memory-Malfoy cast a snake. “
Ron smirked. “I think you can be pretty confident in that.” They turned to Hermione, who now had her business face on.
Mimsey looked horrified and Hokka looked disgusted. Roslyn looked appraisingly at Hermione. “You are very like Mistress Lily, Mistress Hermione. She asked me the same thing.” Roslyn paused, but addressed Harry when she continued. “My family has been working for the Potters for over three-hundred years. It is an honour to be one of their house-elves. I served your grandparents and parents. I will continue to serve you, as will my daughter,” she said fiercely, waving a hand in the direction of Mimsey.
Ron nodded, shifting Teddy slightly. “I think I want to ask Hermione to marry me. When we find her parents, I want to ask for their permission. Ginny told me that’s a thing muggles do. Since you’re her family, too, I wanted to talk to you first.”
Teddy started to stir, and Harry knew it was time for breakfast. “We’ll leave you to rest, Malfoy. I’ll have Kreacher send up some breakfast.”
Grannuff glanced at the document he was holding. “According to our records, 500 galleons were converted to the muggle British pound and withdrawn every year since 1981.”
Savage continued. “If we battle, it’ll have to be near Ottery St. Catchpole, where there aren’t as many muggles. Memory modification will be too hard otherwise. Harry should be announced as a member of the team. We’d go on visible patrols. We’d have to stick to a schedule and look disorganised enough that they’d believe they have a chance.”
“Who do you want to toast?” Malfoy asked.
“They’ve invited us to dinner on the 5
Harry shook his head but raised an eyebrow at his use of Hermione’s given name. “Hermione? Not Granger?”
Harry sighed. “You know I can’t,” he said honestly.
Harry scowled. “Yeah, but they also might try to dose me with a love potion, so maybe not.”
“More than Voldemort ever did,” Harry grumbled. Not wanting to dwell on those unpleasant thoughts, he pulled out the small piece of parchment that had his address on it. “Read this,” he said, allowing Malfoy’s eyes to scan it before pulling out his muggle lighter and setting it on fire.
Harry nodded. He supposed he had the wand of the person who wronged him. Well, not really, considering Voldemort never actually had ownership of the Elder Wand, but close enough. He wondered if Tom Riddle’s old wand was still floating around somewhere.
“I know,” Harry whispered, his cheeks still red. He wanted to deny it but knew it would be pointless. “Thanks ‘Mione. It’s Malfoy, though.”
Kreacher looked very happy as he nodded. “Kreacher is getting Master an Eagle Owl. Master Regulus was having an Eagle Owl,” he said matter-of-factly.
“Late night?” Proudfoot asked, an eyebrow raised. Savage crossed her arms, and Kai looked at him with interest. Elfie was wearing an expression that Harry couldn’t read.
“Oh,” Harry said. “Okay. You sure you still want to come tonight?”
. Harry has no idea how to attend a ball, let alone host one.”
each other.
“Hey, mum,” George said quietly, wrapping her in a hug. Harry was thrilled. The war had broken so many hearts, and destroyed so much, but they were slowly healing.
Harry’s cheeks went red, mildly concerned. He didn’t want McGonagall to be disappointed in him. “Kingsley told you then?”
Harry decided to change the subject. “Kingsley spoke to me today. Robards is offering us all a spot in the training squad.”
Harry smiled. “Yeah. It’s good to see you, Bill,” he said, shaking the eldest Weasley child’s hand. “I haven’t had a chance to explore yet, but, listen, I have to tell you something,” he said gravely. “Is Teddy still at the Burrow?”
Half an hour later, Malfoy had disappeared through the floo, and Harry was holding a handful of green powder, nervously fingering the hem of his brand new auror robes (that had somehow appeared in his wardrobe yesterday) with his other hand. “The DMLE,” he said, not willing to face the crowds of that had been in the atrium the day before. "Good luck with the flat," he said to Ron before stepping into the flames.
“Could you tell me to open the door for you, please?” Draco asked awkwardly as they approached the pub.
Ron blushed. “Well, I saw in the Prophet that Zonkos is closing. I sent an inquiry on the off chance he’d be willing to sell. Turns out he is. I thought maybe George and I could expand Wheezes.” He glanced at Hermione. “Also, I wouldn’t mind living in Hogsmeade if Hermione was back at school.”
“Yeah, he’d been attacked. Snape had given him a portkey to use to go to a safe place if ever he was in danger and too injured to apparate. He didn’t know I lived there,” Harry explained. “It made me realise that I have no idea how many people have access to my house.”
Ron bit his lip but didn’t say anything. Harry cleared his throat.
Malfoy downed the potion proffered by Ron. Smoke blew out of the blond’s ears, but, somehow, he still managed to look dignified. When the potion’s effects seemed to have dissipated, he nodded his thanks and rose from the table. “Well, I can’t say I ever thought I’d be getting drunk and eating Indian with the Golden Trio, but it was actually quite enjoyable,” he drawled.
P.S. I thought I should mention that the movies 'Outlaw King' (2018) and 'The King' (2019) are two of my favourite ever movies and that everything I do is inspired by them.
“What happened?” Harry and Ron asked, immediately reaching for their wands.
Harry spent the rest of the night alternating between staring anxiously at Teddy and staring anxiously at Malfoy. At some point, he brought Teddy with him into Malfoy’s room and sat in the armchair next to the bed. Harry had no idea what Kreacher had done to make Teddy finally fall asleep, but, given that the baby was smiling in his sleep, the tuft of hair at the top of his head changing colour, Harry was pretty confident that it wasn’t some horrible dark magic.
“Do you want to stop by his place?” Harry asked, mentally kicking himself for not even considering Goyle.
Mimsey seemed to be bursting out of her dress with excitement as the three elves opened the large front door for Harry. “Master is home now! We is waiting so long!”
Malfoy fished for a list that he had written under a stack of paper. Handing it to Harry, he quirked his lips when Harry gasped in shock.
Harry closed his eyes and cast a silent, gentle
Harry found himself nodding. “I always thought it was strange that we didn’t have Maths or English.”
Ginny gasped as she emptied her envelope. “Quidditch captain!” she said, pleased.
he muttered, running his wand over the chest, attempting to siphon off as much blood as possible. “
A couple of things:
“Okay. We need a place to do this. I was kind of hoping this place had a dungeon.”
Kingsley raised an eyebrow. “Done. But, Harry, consider that you are planning on entering the field without proper training.”
McGonagall gestured for them to follow. “Quite well, Mr. Potter. I hardly think you need to call me Professor anymore. You too, Mr. Weasley.”
“You’ll probably find that you have several estates,” Malfoy continued. Harry looked up in surprise. “That’ll mean several house-elves, too. They’re a big responsibility…” Malfoy continued. “You’ll need a fitting with Malkin’s – you simply can’t wear
“Thank you,” Harry hesitated. “I’d appreciate it if this was not offered to Ron. He deserves every opportunity to join the training program – he more than deserves that – but I don’t want to put him into danger if he’s not properly trained.”
They spent the rest of the afternoon following Bill around the house as he sought out the dark objects.
“I think your friend, Miss Granger, is working on a petition for the Wizenmagot, actually,” Elfie said conversationally. Harry blinked. He was certain Hermione hadn’t mentioned that. He knew she had ideas for educational reforms, but had never really gone into that much detail.
“You want to try to come up with something that both sides will agree on?” Malfoy asked, raising an eyebrow. “I admire your tenacity, Potter, but I don’t fancy your chances.”
Hermione nodded. “The idea of not sharing a bed was making me a bit queasy,” she admitted. At Harry’s look she blushed. “Not like that! I just mean, I don’t get the nightmares that bad when Ron’s next to me.”
Hermione nodded with satisfaction. “I’m glad you know you were manipulated,” she said.
“Watch it, Whitby,” he growled fondly. “Otherwise you’ll be partnered with me next time.”
Hermione frowned. “No. But the charm would have faded if she ever regretted betraying us.”
The trio - plus Teddy – arrived in the Head’s office. McGonagall was waiting for them and nodded pleasantly when they arrived. “Ms. Granger, Mr. Weasley, Mr. Potter,” she smiled at them, glancing at the tuft of blue hair smushed against Harry’s chest. “Mr. Lupin.”
They exited the kitchen and made their way up the grand staircase to the right of the entrance hall.
Draco shrugged. “A Wizard’s Oath doesn’t have consequences, besides warning you if I actively go against it, and I don’t intend to ever work for the Dark again. It’s fine. Hermione said it wouldn’t interact with the Life Debt.”
Harry frowned but decided to drop it. “How did you get here? The house is under Fidelius.”
Malfoy gasped and fell to one knee. He lowered his eyes. “I did not seek out the darke objects, my lord,” Malfoy clearly wanted to stop talking there, but the magic in the air forced him to continue. “I don’t trust myself not to, though. I have always been drawn to the dark,” he added quietly after a minute.
Harry blinked, but smiled. “Great. We need all the help we can get.”
When Harry returned to his living room, he was treated to the sight of Draco Malfoy very carefully cradling Teddy in his arms as he spoke quietly to Hermione. Harry stood still and just watched, knowing he should make his presence known, but enchanted by the sight of his once-enemy – now friend? – war hardened, posh, stoic, Draco Malfoy, very gently, very carefully rocking his godson back and forth. It was the first time Harry had seen the man interact with the baby, and, although he looked highly uncomfortable, Harry couldn’t help but think Draco looked incredibly attractive standing in Harry’s living room, holding Harry’s godson, wearing incredibly tight black jeans.
“Harry’s already died.” Hermione frowned. “I’m not sure it works more than once.”
Harry was especially fond of Indian food because the Dursley’s hated it, almost more than they hated magic. Harry wondered if it reminded them of his father. The Dursleys had never said anything overtly about his ethnicity, except for one time in primary school, when Dudley had tried to copy one of his friend’s words for Harry’s skin colour. It was the only time Petunia had come to Harry’s defence, although she seemed less concerned for Harry’s wellbeing, and more concerned for Dudley’s reputation. “The Dursley’s are not racist, Duddykins,” she had admonished, although she glanced at Harry with disdain.
Harry reached a hand up to his forehead. It hadn’t so much as twinged since Voldemort died, and Harry had almost forgot that it existed. “No. Voldemort is definitely dead. It’s definitely gone,” he said firmly. He trusted Bill, but the trio had made a pact that they would never mention the existence of Horcruxes to anybody. The world was better off if the knowledge of horcruxes faded away forever. He glanced at Bill.
“It pays to have friends in high places, mate,” he said. He called out to the kitchen, “Back in mo’. Ask ‘Mione what she got in the mail!”
Malfoy growled in frustration. “You might not have any respect for Wizarding traditions, Potter, but I do,” he ground out.
“Noted,” Harry said, grateful for the excuse to collapse into a seat at the end of the table. “How’ve you both been?”
They practised for half an hour before Malfoy determined that they were advanced enough to learn the second half of the dance.
“He’s repaying his life debts by teaching me the Old Ways,” Harry sighed. “I don’t even know how it happened, but it turns out Malfoy and Hermione make quite the pair when it comes to big plans.”
“What’s a Pledge?” Harry asked.
Harry nodded, but didn’t make a move to go in. “I think I’m scared I’m turning into Him,” Harry said after a minute.
The Black ring was like its name, a dark obsidian jewel glinting under the lights. Harry slipped it onto his finger and it glowed, resizing to fit.
Harry, Ron and Bill spent the rest of the night in a whiskey-fuelled haze. Hermione had tried to confiscate their liquor at some point but took one glance at their faces before deciding to join them.
Malfoy gestured at the box in front of him. Harry opened it cautiously. Inside were five rings, each with a silver band, but with different gems.
“Oh,” Harry said. “Erm, well, I could meet you in muggle London? I know you probably don’t like going there, or whatever, but I really can’t go out in wizarding London anymore.”
Malfoy stretched his neck. “The Pledge will have to be before the 15
“Did you?” Harry asked again. “Did you seek out the darke objects?”
McGonagall nodded, looking pleased. “I’m confident we shall be ready to reopen by September 1
Harry swallowed. “Cheers,” he said, blushing. After a beat, he turned to Hermione. “How do you say cheers in Hindi?” he asked.
” The light went out as normal. Turning to a locked chest of drawers next to his bed that held his pictures of his parents, he cast, “
James smiled at them. “Thank you for keeping my boy safe,” he said.
Kingsley wasn’t fazed by his attitude. “Yes, well. I don’t just want you to sit in on my next interview with Greyback. I want you to interrogate him.”
“You should,” Malfoy said. “If it’s possible, you should host the Pledge and the Ball there. I assume you have a Ballroom?” he drawled aristocratically.
Harry smiled, but feigned indignation. “Teddy is going to love maths,” he declared. “And he’s going to be really smart and study and always be on time and never lose house points.”
Harry hesitated. “No offence, Kreacher, but why do you want to help me?” he asked, hoping he didn’t sound impolite.
Malfoy snorted softly but nodded with reluctance. “Yes. I do.”
“I do hope Malfoy is alright,” Hermione said, dragging Harry from his thoughts.
To Harry’s surprise, Ron was the one who answered. “What if you were to just explain the theory bit of it? You don’t have to actually be near it. Like Umbridge’s Defence classes.”
Malfoy looked as uncomfortable as Harry felt. “Three.”
The kitchen at Grimmauld Place looked like a bomb had gone off in it. Piles of papers were strewn everywhere, and, in the same seat in which Harry had left him in, Malfoy was scribbling furiously with a quill, ink splattered up and down his arms.
Malfoy sucked in a breath. Harry internally rolled his eyes, knowing he had broken some sort of pure-blood protocol. The goblin, however, smiled in a way that Harry was sure was not meant to be nasty. “You are wise, Lord Potter, to seek forgiveness from the goblins. Many wizards wouldn’t. The hole has already been repaired.” Grannuff paused, and then added, “The goblins do not interest themselves with the wars of wizards, but I am glad to be having this conversation with you rather than your counterpart.”
Harry gulped, but was half-glad he didn’t have to dance with Hermione – he wasn’t sure Ron’s nerves could take it.
“Be King?” Draco considered. “As a Slytherin, I suspect I’m meant to say yes. Ambition and all that. But, honestly, no. I’m quite content to be on the sideline, using their power for my own nefarious purposes. Besides, Kings have a habit of dying young, and I’m a Malfoy first. Self-preservation is the essence of my moral fibre.”
“Of course,” she responded. “I’m the best player at Hogwarts.”
The elf cracked into existence. “Master Harry is needing Kreacher?”
Seeing where Harry was staring, Malfoy sighed and quietly mumbled, “Glamour.” Coughing, he cast a
Malfoy gave him a distinctly weird look. “I didn’t think you’d want to do that. I sent him a letter. He’ll probably want to grieve alone tonight, anyway. I’ll stop by tomorrow.”
The older wizard narrowed his eyes. “Sting: 49% chance of capturing all of them, with 24% fatalities on our side. Battle: 87% chance of capturing all, 61% fatalities.”
“How did you know that would work?” Ron asked, looking at Harry with a mixture of surprise and disgust.
“Dad spoke to his cousin, by the way. The mind healer in Australia? He’s keen to help you,” Bill said warmly.
Harry frowned. “That won’t be necessary. He doesn’t pose a threat.” At Kingsley’s look of incredulity, he added quickly, “He’s too injured.”
“And – I mean, we got out…” Harry asked quietly.
Cragg nodded. “Potter’s right. Avery is a sadist, but he’s too volatile. If he’s been demeaned a lot by Voldemort in front of others, they won’t respect him. Jugson is the sensible choice. He’s quite calculating, but he gets riled up easily. Very impatient.”
“You too, Professor Lupin,” Hermione said, feeling very weirded out by calling a teenager ‘Professor’.
He smiled. Ginny had some headphones plugged in to a wizard’s radio and was bouncing a quaffle against the ceiling. “Merlin, Harry, you almost gave me a heart attack,” she cried when she noticed him.
Ron nodded. “Still, it’s a big house. You sure you’ll be okay?”
“I’m stuck,” Ron whispered, not wanting to wake Teddy.
“That’s not true,” Harry frowned. “It was unanimous.”
” Teddy stirred on his chest. Since Harry had first met him, he’d been reacting very strongly to magic. Harry couldn’t blame him – there was nothing quite like the feeling of magic in the air when a powerful charm was cast.
Harry nodded. He wondered how unsafe the house had been before, and, not for the first time, wondered if he’d been right to bring Teddy here.
Malfoy and Ron shuddered. Hermione just rolled her eyes. “Do you really think we’d let you do something like that? It’s fine, Harry, you just have to be really specific with the wording.”
“Yes, Master.” Kreacher said, his ears drooping. “It is not being fit for the home of a Black.”
Malfoy frowned. “I no longer live at the Manor. It was rather empty after all of our things were taken away. Besides, there were too many bad memories. Mother and I are living in a safe house.”
Harry groaned. “Ssh, he’s just outside. Can you keep nothing to yourself?” he complained, grabbing his friend’s pint and helping himself.
Harry nodded. Holding the bottom of the frame, he closed his eyes and willed it to come unstuck. It became heavy in his hands. Placing it on the ground and leaning it carefully against the wall, he took a step back.
“Shit,” Kai said. “I’m really sorry. I wasn’t thinking.”
“Hey,” the man exclaimed. “I have a very busy social life, I’ll have you know.”
Harry raised an eyebrow. “Since when were you religious?”
Harry smiled. Less than a year ago, he would have said yes, absolutely. But, with all that had happened, he couldn’t help but think that cunning and ambitious Slytherins were highly useful. “No,” he said honestly. “The hat was pretty confident I should have been in Slytherin, actually.”
Hermione rolled her eyes but ceased her arguments. “Fine. I only hope that tonight goes better than the last time we tried to break into the ministry.”
“Oh good, you’re ready,” Hermione said, noticing Harry. “Ron and I are going to drop off Teddy. Can you side-along with Draco? You have a concussion and I don’t want you apparating on your own.”
” Slowly a long thread of magic drew out of the wand, wrapping around their hands.
Malfoy nodded, sitting down at the table when Harry waved him forward.  “Thank you for fixing me, Potter. How did you do it? I don’t recall you being particularly good at healing charms.”
Malfoy paused. “We did when I was a child. Mother wanted me to be fluent in English before I got to Hogwarts, though, so I wasn’t allowed to after I turned 8 until I got my letter. I spoke French at home during my Hogwarts years, but erm… not at the end.”
Harry had suspected as much. “Pity,” Harry said. “You’re not going to like Plan B.” He closed his eyes, drudging up memories he had spent so long squashing into the recesses of his mind. Remus, screaming in agony as his bones started to break and reform into those of a wolf’s in his third year. His thin, frail frame and dark bags under his eyes after he’d been unemployed for over year, because of his curse. Bill’s face ripped open as he lay in the Hospital Wing, Molly weeping over his frightfully still body. Lavender’s body in pieces in the Great Hall. Teddy’s screams for his parents the first few nights after the Battle.
Ron and Harry looked at her with surprise. She continued, “The purebloods wanted to take them away from their families and raise them in the Wizarding World. That way, the culture is preserved, and no one is risking revealing magic to muggles.”
Robards shook their hands, too, and lifted the corner of his mouth slightly. “Reckon it’d be hard to not know your three’s names,” he commented wryly. “Sorry about downstairs. They’ve been here all morning. Probably Ambarella’s doing. I’ll have a word with her.”
Malfoy shrugged. “I’m into blokes. The wizarding world isn’t too fussed by that sort of thing, you know. Not like the muggles, at least.”
Harry couldn’t wipe the smile off his face for the rest of the morning, even as he was changing Teddy’s nappy.
Harry smiled grimly. “It wouldn’t be the first time. Besides, that’s the plan. I reckon if I make myself vulnerable, they’ll want to attack.”
“What’s your plan, Jugson?” Proudfoot spoke up. “There’s only six - no, five of you left. What do you possibly think you can achieve?”
Harry sighed. Hermione would go with Ron, and he was sure Ginny would ask Wilda Griffiths, her on-again, off-again hook up from the Holyhead Harpies. Luna would be going with Neville, no doubt. “I don’t really have anyone to take. Can’t I just go stag?”
Harry shrugged. “Er, I guess. It might be a good idea. If he’s okay with it.”
Harry grit his teeth but said nothing as Hermione and Ron attempted to clear a path for him.
“Yours too,” Harry said. At Robards’ shrug, Harry sighed. “Are you sure we can’t get more out of Greyback?”
Malfoy indicated for him to sit down at the head of the table. Harry did as he were bid and indicated for Grannuff to take his place.
Hermione ignored him and sliced her thumb open, letting seven drops of blood fall into the jar. “If you could all do the same,” she said. “Oh, and Harry, we need 14 drops from you.”
Mordecai nodded and smiled proudly. “I’m from Philly. Auror with MACUSA for five years. I moved to the UK just three weeks ago.”
Harry swallowed. In hindsight, casting
“Anything for you, oh saviour,” George bowed sarcastically.
“Well, he was doing questionable things before you were born, too,” Hermione continued. “In addition to the whole Grindelwald debacle, he changed a lot of laws about muggleborns. You know, once upon a time, we were told of our magic before we turned 11. The Ministry knows if you’re magical when you’re born. It makes no sense for us to be denied the truth. It puts people in danger.
Hermione didn’t say anything but smiled radiantly. She squeezed Ron’s hand three times.
Harry dragged his eyes away from the tapestry and followed her through the doors to a large but comfortable-looking sitting room.
Oh my god there are a lot of characters in this story. I promise more Teddy content will come soon.
As Harry turned onto Islington High Street, he couldn’t help but gasp when he spotted Malfoy walking from the station. In all the seven years Harry had known him, he couldn’t recall a single time Malfoy had worn muggle clothing. Yet, here he was, strolling towards Harry with the same confidence he’d always had, but dressed in black skinny jeans, a white t-shirt and a khaki and white plaid over shirt, long hair in a messy bun.
Hermione rolled her eyes and crossed her arms. “That was so dangerous, though. Why didn’t you apparate us?”
“I’m sorry?” Harry asked, surprised. They had been trying to remove her from the wall for years, unable to break the permanent sticking charm.
The room was quiet as people thought. Draco cleared his throat nervously. “Erm – Malfoy Manor?”
The eruption of debris filled the entrance hall and steps with smoke. The entrance was clear, but Harry couldn’t see inside. This was it.
Harry glanced down at Teddy. He didn’t really want him to be exposed to the attention. Looking up at Hermione, however, he saw her shake her head. She was right. He was going to have to face them eventually. Rolling back his shoulders he sighed, “It’s fine. They won’t leave you alone unless they see me. I’ll cast a silencing bubble around Teddy.”
” he cast again and again and again, his wand-hand shaking. Hermione started siphoning the blood off while Ron mopped it up.
“Well, it’s still exciting,” said Mrs. Weasley, sweeping Ginny into a big hug. “I’m proud of you darling.”
“Gamp’s law,” Hermione, Draco and, surprisingly, Ron, said at the same time.
“I hate this place,” Ron commented as they walked, the sounds of their shoes clacking against dark tiles echoing.
Ron put his head in his hands. “Let’s focus on changing the world first, okay love? Gender bias in dark overlords can wait.”
“Very well then, Harry,” Narcissa said, still smiling. “Your manners have improved drastically in the time my son has been working for you.”
Teddy was in Ginny’s arms on the couch. She blinked sleep from her eyes as the floo chimed. “You look like shit.”
Hermione frowned. “I think that’s be a great idea, Malfoy, but it’s only a month until the 20
Even Ron looked at him with incredulity. “Honestly, mate. I had no idea you were this clueless.”
” He glanced up at Harry, who nodded, and rolled his eyes and cast the spell again. “I don’t know that spell,” Robards said firmly. “You don’t know that spell.”
Harry frowned, looking at the can. He couldn’t help but think it probably wasn’t wise to drink this much the night before his first day at work.
Harry chided himself mentally. “Where are Jugson and the other death eaters?”
Ron shrugged. “We may be blood-traitors, but we’re still purebloods.
Robards raised an eyebrow. “But you own all three Hallows, correct?” At Harry’s nod, he continued. “I admit I don’t know much about it, but doesn’t that make you Master of Death?”
Roslyn nodded. “We have converted the secondary Principle Bedroom into a nursery for baby Teddy. There is a connecting door to Master Harry’s rooms, and there is plenty of space for him to grow up.”
“Harry!” cried Mrs. Weasley as he stepped through the floo. Despite her red eyes and the dark shadows underneath them, she smiled broadly as she wrapped him in a hug. “Good to see you, darling.”
“Cool,” Harry said. “Do you think they would meet with me?”
Malfoy’s fingers were cool in his palm as they started the waltz. Harry happened to know vaguely what to do here, having been Neville’s reluctant partner a few times prior to the Yule Ball, but had only danced the lead once. He held his breath as he remembered the steps. Forward, forward, right, right, back, back, he thought, refusing to look down. Malfoy smirked as they kept their eyes locked.
Harry sighed and drained the last of his coffee, before making his way to the kitchen and touching the door to the basement. Bella was waiting for him.
When he pulled away, Malfoy was staring at him with hooded eyes, but quickly blinked and looked away, as Ron cheered and Hermione suggested they play a card game.
Harry swallowed. “I have no idea,” he admitted. “Suppose I can’t – what do we do? Do I just try an unprotected floo?”
Ron frowned. “What about your portkey?”
Harry kept his wand sheathed, and marched forward with Savage and Proudfoot. As soon as they passed the barrier of the wards, Harry felt a ripple of Cragg’s protective magic envelop him and sighed in relief.
“Whatever you say, lover boy,” Ron wiggled his eyebrows from across the table. It seemed that he, Hermione, Ginny and George had been there for a while, while Harry and Draco had been talking philosophy.
“Alright,” Robards called from the front of the room, Cragg at his side. They gathered around. “Now that you’ve all met Potter, let’s discuss the plan. Our primary targets are the unaccounted-for Death Eaters Avery, Crabbe, Goyle, Jugson, and the Lestrange brothers. Based on witness accounts of recent attacks on a few towns just outside of Little Whinging, Surrey, and some muggle towns near Ottery St. Catchpole, Devon, we believe they are working together.”
Hermione flounced into the room and sat on the arm of Harry’s chair. She sighed, and Harry could tell he wasn’t going to like whatever she said next. “Look, Harry. Whether you like it or not, you are the leader of the Wizarding World,” Hermione started, rolling her eyes at Harry’s expression. Before he could interrupt, she continued, “Kingsley may be Minister, but only because you support him. You are the Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot. People respect you.”
“Merlin’s beared, Potter,” Malfoy said. “Accidental magic at your age?” he asked, but it wasn’t in a condescending way. He let out a low whistle. “That’s pretty impressive. What wand are you using?”
Hermione knew perfectly well that Harry was more than capable of apparating with a full head wound, but from the smirk that Ron was barely concealing, he knew it was part of her Plan
Malfoy nodded. “We’re betrothed,” he said by way of explanation. At Harry’s blank face, he rolled his eyes. “For heirs,” he said, as if it were the most obvious answer in the world.
“Answer him,” Harry said.
Harry shrugged. He didn’t think he was particularly clever, just often underestimated. “Do you have any other portraits?” he asked.
. Harry thought.
Harry shuddered, remembering Pettigrew’s cold voice in fourth year:
“Good to see you, Harry” Kingsley said genially when Harry popped through the Minister’s fireplace. Ron and Hermione had taken Teddy with them to the Burrow. He would never admit this, but watching Ron interact with a baby was one of Harry’s favourite things to do these days. He was both incredibly uncomfortable and unsure but also so gentle and happy whenever he was holding Teddy. Hermione seemed to love watching Ron with Teddy, too, and sometimes Harry felt as though he was intruding on a private moment.
Blood pulled around Harry’s shoes as Greyback let out one last, long death rattle. The body before them went still.
“Ron and I will come around next week,” he promised. “Of course you have a shot, you’re the best damn chaser at Hogwarts.”
They laughed and Harry glanced at the bottle of wine, and poured a little in the cap. “Do I have to say anything?”
Harry waved him off. “It’s quite alright, …”
“Me, of course,” Malfoy said nonchalantly. “I’ll pledge myself to you and then my life debt will be resolved.”
“Oh, Harry,” Hermione sighed. “It’s okay. You didn’t. But Malfoy is right. In any case, you shouldn’t be keeping the most powerful wand in existence in your sock drawer.”
She rolled her eyes. “I’ll look into it. I won’t be your secret keeper, though,” she said firmly. Hermione would always stay true to her morals.
Harry glanced at Greyback, who was still sitting quietly with an absent smile on his face. “We can’t do anything when he’s like this, anyway. You go upstairs and wait by the floo. When they’re back, come back down.”
“But that’s just … what we do,” Harry said. “I insult you back.”
Neville swallowed. “No, Harry, it’s really okay. You got the others, right?”
Harry grinned and returned the gesture. “You too. I promise he’s not that bad.”
Hermione and Ron both loved when they got takeout, so Harry excused himself from the three people in his living room. Hermione and Malfoy were nose-deep in parchment again, and Ron was feeding with Teddy. He ran upstairs to change into muggle clothes. As he made his way to the front door, he paused. “I’ll be back. Do you like spicy food, Malfoy?”
“Master Potter has returned home!” one of them squeaked, pleased.
“Me,” Malfoy shrugged. “I’ll be
Malfoy shrugged. “She’s destroyed her mental walls. She can’t compartmentalise anymore. It’s like she’s reliving all of her memories at once.”
The next morning, Harry woke up with the worst headache he’d ever had. For a moment, he forgot that Voldemort was dead and raised his mental shields, not wanting to let the bastard back into his head. “Ugh,” he groaned, realising it was simply a fierce hangover from the night before.
Harry hugged Teddy closer to his chest. “You are not turning my godson into a medical experiment, Hermione.”
Harry frowned. It all sounded so clinical. “What does Pansy get out of it?”
Kingsley sighed, closing his eyes again. “I know we just spoke of me not being corrupt, but I- you should know that the ministry cannot identify what spells you cast with the Elder Wand,” he said after a moment.
Hermione waved Malfoy off, but looked slightly pleased. “You’ve got a meeting with Kingsley at 10, and then your needed at Hogwarts to help repair the wards. After lunch you’re free.”
“Did Marietta ever get rid of those pimples?” George asked interestedly.
Harry removed his gaze from Draco’s and inclined his head. “Your son is a talented instructor, Narcissa,” he complimented, lying through his teeth. “And, as ‘your Lord’, I’d ask that you call me Harry, at least in private company.”
Bella rolled her eyes. “Foolish men,” she shook her head. Harry raised an eyebrow in surprise. He hadn’t known how she would react to the news, but he certainly hadn’t expected that. The witch folded her arms across her chest. “Their master is dead. They’d gain far more advantage if they attempted to align themselves with the new order, instead of making futile attempts to flee or resist. Regardless, by right of conquest, they are yours. They should beg forgiveness of their lord, as I have done.”
Harry’s cheeks heated up. “Really?” he asked. “I thought you’d want one of your brothers.”
Something shifted in the air. The magic that swirled around him didn’t feel like his usual out-of-control magic, although it still felt familiar. It felt older – almost ancient.
Harry shifted uncomfortably under her appraising look. “You think so? It’s not a bit much?”
Harry turned to Hermione, “So what’s this got to do with life-debts?”
Harry wrinkled his nose. “The ones where they take muggleborns away from their parents?”
Harry blanched. “No.”
, he thought again.
“Morning, Kingsley,” Harry said brightly. “How are you?”
Harry raised his chin. “This is not all of Grimmauld Place,” he said. It wasn’t a question. Hermione had speculated as much even back in their fifth year. The home of the Ancient and Most Noble House of Black couldn’t just be a modestly-sized town house. In fact, it was very strange that the Blacks would choose to live in Muggle London at all, when they could live in a mansion in a wizarding hamlet like the Malfoys, the Potters or the Weasleys.
Kingsley sighed. “I know. Which is why I want you to do it.” He closed his eyes as if he were pained for a moment. “You don’t know what the rules are.”
“Former death eaters,” Harry corrected. Kingsley paused but nodded. Harry sighed, “The Dursley’s house wasn’t under Fidelius, and I was safe there. Dumbledore used a blood ward.”
Harry sighed, running a hand through his hair. “Hermione, I can’t sleep knowing their out there. I can’t let Teddy grow up in a world where there are bloody Death Eaters roaming around!”
Kingsley stilled. “I’m sorry?”
Malfoy looked up in surprise. “We’re eating in here? Why? You have a perfectly good dining table in the kitchen.”
Harry shrugged. “I don’t know. Barty Crouch Jr. tried it on me in fourth year. It took a while, but I shook it off eventually.”
Harry blinked. “Oh, alright then.” Remembering his conversation with Kingsley, he smacked his forehead. “Actually, I have to recast the protective wards around the house tonight. Can I floo to Malfoy Manor to bring you back?”
“The same thing you did with the wards earlier. Just will the magic to do your bidding. Here, try to disarm me, but don’t think of a spell. Just will it to happen,” Cragg said.
“No, Potter. We’re betrothed. One day, when I find the person I actually want to be with, we’ll get black out drunk and have sex. Then, while Pansy’s pregnant, I’ll get married to my person. When the baby is born, it’ll be technically illegitimate, but I will recognise it officially as my heir,” Malfoy explained.
Proudfoot, Savage and Kai were arguing loudly over some quidditch match between two American quidditch teams.
Secondly - I've decided to rename the work from 'Strange Bedfellows' to 'Mos Maiorum'. It's a Latin term for the unwritten code from which the ancient Romans derived their social norms. It essentially means 'Do the Right Thing', which, for the Romans, was to obey and continue to uphold tradition. I'm a history nerd and found it in one of my readings for uni. It definitely fits the story much better. Also, there is another story on AO3 called 'Strange Bedfellows', which, admittedly, I haven't read but is undoubtedly much better than my writing.
Harry James Potter had, perhaps naively, believed that he would be living as a regular young adult after he had killed Voldemort. He was quickly realising just how wrong he had been.
Harry frowned. It sounded plausible, but Harry had no way of ensuring that she was telling the truth, beyond the threat of violence, and he thought she might be less willing to cooperate if he acted on those particular urges. He nodded absently. “Your husband and his brother escaped the aurors today,” he said, choosing not to highlight that he was one of the said aurors.
“What do you know of Jugson and the remaining death eaters?” Harry asked. Greyback struggled to answer and, for a moment, Harry worried that the spell was breaking.
“Oh Bellatrix, you clever bitch,” Harry said as they got to the bottom of the stairs. A large painting of the witch, albeit much younger, smirked at them from the brick wall that faced them.
Carefully, he allowed his magic to unfurl slightly around him. The candles in the sconces on the wall started to flicker and the desk started to rattle. “Never use my godson to manipulate me into doing anything again, Minister,” Harry said coldly. Kingsley tried not to look intimidated, but Harry could see his eyes widen a fraction. He pulled the magic back in. The lights flickered back to their normal warm glow, and the desk was now suspiciously still. “Accidental magic,” Harry said with a shrug, maintaining his glare. He paused, mostly for dramatic effect at this point, but then nodded slowly. “On one condition. I need a list of all who were orphaned in the war."
Harry remembered his trip with Dumbledore to the sea cave in his sixth year. From the protections on that location, he wasn’t hopeful that the only protection on this warehouse would be as simple as a blood sacrifice.
Harry blinked, finding Malfoy using muggle words to be exceedingly strange, but agreed readily. “See you tomorrow, Malfoy.”
“I’ve never eaten on the floor before,” Malfoy said absently.
“Head Girl?” Ginny asked with a grin.
“What could precious pious Potter need with some dungeons?” she asked imperiously. “Have you kidnapped someone? Are you planning on torturing them?” Bellatrix’s eyes lit up with excitement. “Hmmm, perhaps you have some of the mad Black blood in you, after all…”
“Sure,” Harry said, moving to help her with the porridge.
Harry crouched down so that he was at the elf’s eye-height. “Hermione, Ron and I are going to be moving into Potter manor soon. I really like Grimmauld Place,” he said, lying through his teeth, but not wanting to offend, “but I want to see where my dad grew up for a bit. There are three Potter house-elves – Roslyn, Mimsey and Hokka. I was going to ask if you would like to come with us, but I know you love this house. Malfoy and his mum are going to move in here, and I was wondering if you would rather stay here and help them?”
on the painting, before shrinking it and putting it in his jacket pocket.
The Gaunt ring was a green sapphire, according to Malfoy, deep in colour like a forest. Harry slipped it onto the same finger, wondering how all of them were going to fit. Glowing warm, the sapphire seemed to slip off the Gaunt band and squeezed next to the Black jewel on the same band.
“Books?” Ron asked, confused.
Malfoy raised an eyebrow. “I’m surprised you’ve not heard. It’s all anyone can talk about. Dumbledore proposed that it be removed.”
Ginny scoffed. “You’re an Auror, Harry. You will have to kill again. Probably many times. It will break you. And probably, one day it will start to feel good. That’s when you come to me, and we’ll run away to a tropical island. Take Teddy. Live as muggles or something,” she said this all as if it was the most obvious thing in the world.
Robards came up to him. “I should’ve warned you about the press.”
Malfoy looked at him in dismay. “Potter, you are the master of the Elder Wand. You can’t channel that much power through the wand you had when you were eleven!”
Harry frowned but didn’t press him. He had mentioned it was in Wiltshire. Perhaps it was too close to Malfoy Manor for his comfort. “How do we get there?” he asked, instead.
“That won’t be necessary,” Harry said quickly, but Malfoy frowned. “Let’s get started, yes?” he asked, trying to muster some enthusiasm for being pinned and prodded for the next thirty minutes.
Harry felt his face flush bright, but Malfoy was apparating before he could say anything, their bodies leaving Grimmauld Place with a loud CRACK.
Hermione sighed in sympathy. “Don’t worry, Harry. Teddy will be sleeping through the night soon, and everyone will calm down eventually. You’ll be able to have a love life again soon.”
“I’m glad Dennis has you,” Harry said. “Do you know if any more were orphaned?”
Harry nodded, his throat sticking slightly. He actually had no idea if Teddy looked like his grandmother, having only met Andromeda Tonks once and embarrassingly mistaking her for Bellatrix, but his godson’s wrinkled nose when he was grumpy certainly reminded him of Tonks, and Harry supposed she must have gotten the expression from somewhere. He sat down, shifting his godson to his lap, and waved his hand, transforming Narcissa’s chair into a rather comfortable looking wheelchair. “I was wondering if you’d like Ron and Hermione to show you around. I just need to talk to Draco about something quickly.”
Bill didn’t seem offended. Instead, he knelt on one knee. “I solemnly swear that whatever is discussed in this room will not be repeated by me to anyone, without prior consent of the members within this room.” He grinned cockily. “Sufficient?” he asked Ron.
Ginny nodded thoughtfully and passed him his cup. “I don’t think the war’s over. I’m not sure it ever will be – not for us. All we can do is make sure that its over for them,” she said softly, nodding at the baby in his arms.
Harry was surprised to hear he had jewels, although he was starting to think being surprised was fairly commonplace around Draco Malfoy.
Ginny shrugged. “Alright. It’s a shame I don’t have you all here to fly with. I need all the practice I can get – Puddlemere is recruiting when we get back to school and Minnie thinks I’m really in with a shot.”
“Excellent,” Harry said. He paused. He trusted that Malfoy wouldn’t hurt Kreacher, but he didn’t know Narcissa very well. To be safe, he said clearly, “Remember, Kreacher, I am still Lord Black. If you are ever hurt or put in danger by the Malfoys, you must come to me at once. That’s an order.”
A line of fire started at the far end of the room and snaked along each wall, coming towards them. Then, there was a soft whoosh as the two trails of fire joined at the door behind them, effectively sealing them inside. The flames danced threateningly up the wall, crackling softly, and providing light to every corner of the room. Fiendfyre. Harry’s stomach flipped.
By the time Harry made his way down the stairs, Hermione and Malfoy were nose-deep in paperwork across from a very dismayed goblin. The goblin gasped and rose when Harry entered.
Harry swayed on the spot slightly his head still aching with the effort to break the wards earlier. Ron pushed Greyback roughly into one of the cells and swung the door close. A chain wrapped around the bars like a snake and locked it in place. Harry took a deep breath and leant against the cold stone wall.
Harry looked at Hermione and Ron nervously. “I could have hurt somebody?” he asked quietly.
Robards frowned. “They have until the 2
“S’not true,” Seamus complained stubbornly. “I’m not nervous to see him.”
“Elfrida Whitby,” a middle-aged witch said, shaking his hand. “Call me Elfie.”
Thank you for your fantastic comments!
Walburga smirked. “You have brains, too, it seems,” she said, her brown teeth glinting.
Malfoy paused, but nodded. “That feature can be disabled, however,” he said quietly. Shaking his head, he turned to Grannuff. “Speaking of, do you have documentation of Lord Potter’s estates?”
Harry opened her mouth to reassure her but was surprisingly interrupted by Hermione. “He’s already a target for them, Mrs. Weasley. I fancy his chances better if he’s surrounded by a team of trained aurors,” she said calmly.
Mrs. Weasley gasped and spun around, “George!”
“I don’t fancy experiencing that again,” Ron said, rubbing his shoulder.
“Lady Macbeth,” Draco said. He quirked a smile. “I was about to offer you Richard II. ‘Cover your heads, and mock not flesh and blood with solemn reverence; throw away respect, tradition, form, and ceremonious duty; for you have but mistook me all this while.’”
Harry swallowed. Kingsley hadn’t said anything directly, but Harry knew that he’d expected them to kill him. Harry closed his eyes. Could he do it? He glanced down at the wand in his hand. The Death Stick, it was called. Harry wasn’t Voldemort – he couldn’t cast AK. With the Unforgivables, you have to want it to work, and Harry wasn’t sure he really wanted to kill Greyback.
Harry shuddered, reminded of the times he’d watched her cow before Voldemort. At least her pleas proved that she only had one horcrux. He pulled the basilisk fang away regretfully. “Who else knows of horcruxes?”
Kreacher nodded. “House being safe now, Master.”
Harry couldn’t help but quietly think that he didn’t have anybody to take, anyway. Ginny was still underage, and if he brought her people would no doubt ask about their non-existent relationship. George was still too fragile. Bill and Arthur were working. Molly would be babysitting Teddy. His heart sank a little as he remembered everybody else he used to have to guard his back was dead.
Next to all, except one, of the names on the tapestry, a small ‘d’ was inscribed. Beneath his parents, an eerily-accurate likeness of Harry appeared, although his tapestry counterpart didn’t have Harry’s dark under-eye bags.
Harry frowned, worried Malfoy was about to say something disparaging about his godfather.
“Anyway, Dumbledore changed the rules. I’m not really sure why, probably he hoped we would have an appreciation for muggle culture, unlike wizards like Grindelwald. All of a sudden, muggleborns started being introduced to the Wizarding World with no knowledge of the Old Ways. The purebloods weren’t happy. I mean, of course they weren’t, their culture was being erased. Hardly any wizards and witches today practice the Old Ways. People don’t even really celebrate the holidays,” Hermione said sadly.
Harry nodded. The two never really talked about their emotions, unless they were yelling at each other - part of what Hermione called their ‘toxic masculinity’ - and knew Ron was feeling uncomfortable being so vulnerable. “I don’t want to live by myself,” Harry said quietly. “I know you want to live near Hogwarts, so you can see Hermione. I’ll get used to it. I’ll just miss you both.”
“You alright?” Ron asked, frowning.
Harry smiled. “’Course not. Ron’s not likely to break her heart in any case. It’s actually disgusting how much he loves her.”
Harry ignored most of this interaction, jaw nearly on the floor. Large portraits crowded the walls, the largest of which was a portrait of four very familiar-looking young wizards.
Hermione nodded thoughtfully. “Would you like to repay them?”
“Narcissa,” Harry said, lifting Teddy high into the air before placing him on his hip, “This is your great-nephew, Teddy Lupin.”
Hermione giggled, but dutifully showed Malfoy how to hold the bottle as she pierced it. “It creates an air bubble, see?” she asked. Trust Hermione to explain the science behind a drinking method.
Harry grinned as he made his way to the Minister’s office, more than thrilled with his new team mates. Somewhere in the back of his mind, though, a quiet voice was chanting‘61% chance of fatalities’.
,” Harry cast, revealing a large dark red shield. Harry blinked. Although it was plainly obvious that both were constructed of similar magic, these wards were entirely different from those at Hogwarts. Instead of defensive and protective like the one at Hogwarts, this was overtly offensive. Harry could feel the malignant magic radiating off it deep in his gut.
, so you can host your ball the night before. I’ve already arranged catering and entertainment, but I’ll have to organise the other stuff with your elves. We should send the invitations by the end of this week. I’ll have to go through the etiquette with Granger, Weasley and you before then. You’ll need a date for both the meeting and the ball. Do you have anyone in mind? They’ll need plenty of warning.”
“The representative from Gringotts will be here any moment now,” Malfoy told him. “I imagine we’ll spend the rest of the afternoon after that visiting your estates.”
