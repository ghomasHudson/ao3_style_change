isn’t reporting on the Death Eater’s or V-Voldemort’s return, Harry…” Remus says quietly, resuming his seat at the table and refilling Harry’s coffee cup. ”They’re following the Ministry’s directives, and you know the Ministry’s stand on this matter is…”
… The idea of you seeing me in my wolf form makes me uncomfortable, as well”, Remus adds, avoiding his eyes.
A bright light suddenly bursts out of Draco’s wand tip and floods the small chamber. Within seconds, Harry feels the plant loosening its grip on him as it wriggles frantically and cringes away from the light. He pulls himself free, and quickly bends over Ron to make sure he’s okay. The redhead gasps and splutters, but he seems to be fine. Harry gives him a hand up and they join Draco over by the wall.
”— I am going to stay out of your way and keep to myself”, Harry continues coolly. ”I’m only here for a week, and then you’ll never see me again. While I
”Harry…” Draco shakes his head again, eyes shining. ”This is too big, even for you… but… at least promise me that, no matter what happens,
But Harry just shakes his head. He feels drained. Fawkes might have driven the basilisk poison from his system, but he has no strength or energy left… And on top of that, he feels pretty sure that he is about to be expelled and if that’s the case, he rather just get it over with so that he can go home to his dads and curl up in his bed and sleep for days…
Harry just keeps beaming and climbs into bed, putting the note from Draco in his nightstand drawer. Remus steps inside the room and starts to tuck him in, but Harry bats his hands away, ”Daddy… I’m not a baby…”
She gives him an incredulous look and opens her mouth to retort, but is interrupted as the music suddenly changes and
Slipping and stumbling, they follow Hagrid down a steep, narrow path. Nobody talks. Neville, the boy who has lost his toad, can be heard sniffling once or twice.
Staying true to his word, Draco continues to not-talk-to Harry all day, which suits Harry just fine. In fact, it gives him the chance to observe the other boy from afar to try and make sense of the two of them as a couple. Something that, even in this topsy-turvy world, seems like a ridiculous, if not impossible, idea to Harry.
”And the door to the Space Room — do you remember on which side of the room it was?” Granger interrupts him.
”He was doing everything to annoy his parents at that time, but he also wanted to cement his different views, he put Gryffindor banners all over the room as well, and pictures of muggle women and motorcycles… He even put permanent sticking charms on them, so Walburga wouldn’t be able to tear them down when he went to Hogwarts…”
his heart seems to skip a beat, as the pieces start to fit together slowly… Tapping the book with his wand again, Harry says ”Draco is pretty” once more and then waits with bated breath…
will”, Granger says, glaring at the woman when she starts cackling. ”I know some people won’t take him seriously, but the
”Harry, that’s enough”, Remus says. ”I’m sure Professor Snape will have a piece if he feels like it. Stop pestering the man.”
Harry huffs out a chuckle and pushes himself up to sitting, reaching blindly for his spectacles. Draco presses them into his hand and Harry gives him a small smile of
He doubles back and runs to the staff room in the other end of the same level. He knocks on the door, but there’s no answer. He hesitates for a moment, then with his heart hammering he decides to push the door open and peer inside.
Draco loops a leg over Harry’s and then an arm over his chest, bringing them even closer together and Harry tries not to focus too much on the feeling of Draco’s crotch pressed against his hip. He gingerly brings his arm up to drape over Draco’s, hugging him a little closer and concentrates instead on the comforting weight of Draco’s head resting over his heart.
”Harry… You can’t possibly expect me to go to the Ball with you… not after Mother sent me that letter…?” Harry just stares at him. ”Harry,
Harry gapes in astonishment as he looks around. The hall is panelled in polished, dark wood and lined with fireplaces through which several witches and wizards appear in sudden bursts of brilliant green flames as Harry and Sirius amble past. And as Harry gazes up at the ceiling, at first believes it to be enchanted like the ceiling in the Great Hall at Hogwarts, because it’s shade of blue is almost exactly the same as the sky in early evening and it appears to be full of twinkling stars — except they’re not stars at all, he realises quickly — but golden symbols that keep changing.
”Okay…” Remus gently interrupts him, putting a comforting hand on the blonde’s shoulder. ”Let’s just go home then… and it’s
”N-Nothing…” he mutters and quickly swill his cup around before thrusting it into Theodore’s hands then grabbing his cup from him in return and pretends to study the soggy tealeaves intently until the woman sweeps away again.
generous contribution to St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, Arthur”, Fudge says, clearly oblivious to the sudden tension. ”He’s here as my personal guest!”
, the wooden leg falls to the floor as a real leg begins to grow out and Sirius jumps back swiftly, out of the way.
If Harry had been helping with dinner, he’s sure the man would be itching to take over, Harry thinks.
If anything could convince Harry that his suspiscion was right, then Lockhart stating the opposite was at the top of the list. The more the man tries to persuade them all that the danger has passed, the more determined Harry gets. He will sneak out of the castle tonight and head into the Forest. He will take his invisibility cloak and he will find that spider — he will find out
”Shove off, Cadogan”, Seamus mutters, almost as out of breath as the painted knight after seven flights of stairs.
Harry startles and spins around to see Granger watching him from the the other side of the hallway with a bemused expression.
Harry follows Draco down to the dungeons, feeling an odd thrill at the familiarity. The blonde shoots him a sidelong look and tells him that he’s smiling again.
The last few days of the Christmas holiday pass surprisingly quickly once Harry starts hanging out with Ron and the twins. They spend the majority of the days outside in the castle grounds, pelting snowballs at each other and making snow men. One day the twins bewitch a few snowballs to chase after Quirrell and keep bouncing off the back of his turban, until finally McGonagall catches them and assigns them detention to be served as soon as term starts again.
The invisible blanket stays securely wrapped around Harry and the light, warm atmosphere of the cottage remains firmly in place as Christmas Eve rolls around. If anything, it all intensifies with the fire in the fireplace and the many candles hovering around the rooms, and the smell of mulled wine and gingerbread wafting out of the kitchen and seeping into the living room.
Ludo Bagman appears at his shoulder suddenly and whisks him away, steering him into position along the water’s edge ten feet from Krum. Harry can tell the older boy’s eyes are hard with focus and he’s got his wand clutched tightly in his hand, ready at his side.
”My second piece of general advice”, Moody interrupts him again, speaking loudly and clearly. ”Is to use a
Harry smirks, also rolling his eyes. Then, catching Draco’s confused look, he reminds him, ”His Patronus…”
Snape leads the way to his office at the end of the corridor and taps the lock with his wand before holding the door open for Harry who steps inside. The walls are lined with shelves, some of them filled with peeling old textbooks but most are stacked with jars and boxes of ingredients. Snape’s personal potions supplies, Harry guesses.
He’s actually enjoying himself so thoroughly that, when the book suddenly lets out very familiar screeching wail, it startles him so much he drops the book to the floor.
As if hearing Harry’s thoughts, the blonde turns to meet his gaze. His eyes immediately darkening a shade.
Seven minutes on the dot, Harry carefully lets two drops of syrup of hellebore fall into the mixture and then quickly stirs the the potion five times clockwise and lowers the flame under the cauldron and dumps the last ingredient — powdered porcupine quills — into the the mixture and then finally lowers the flame even further, before collapsing back into his seat with a relieved sigh.
Of course Draco sees right through him anyway, judging by the grim look on his face. And his friends as well, but at least he’s not a complete snivelling mess for all of his other housemates and Quidditch team mates to see, which is something…
Sitting up quickly, Harry peaks out of the bed hangings to make sure Draco is asleep in the other bed, before casting a quick Silencing Charm on his own bed and taking himself in hand. As he relaxes back against his pillow, his shuts his eyes and recalls the feeling of Draco’s long and slender fingers wrapped around him, squeezing him hard and pumping him with sure movements… Speeding up his own movements to match the pace of the memory, Harry feels the familiar pressure of pleasure as it builds…
”Fuck it”, Draco says and tilts his head back and sucks a deep, watery breath in. ”I definitely need another drink now.”
”Yeah, Draco is going to kick himself when his teacher demonstrates it next lesson. It’s really obvious once you know it… Look”, he leans forward and picks the contraption up. ”Bread slices go in there… This needs to be plugged into a wall socket of course—”
They keep flying as the sun sets and don’t stop until it’s got too dark to see properly. Harry races Draco to the ground and touches down first, cheering triumphantly while lighting his wand with a
Not wishing to waste any more time, Harry begins to swim towards the centre of the lake until he can no longer see the bottom or the shore in any direction. Then he dives into the dark depths.
”But”, Harry speaks before he can stop himself, as a sudden thought strikes him. ”I saw into the mind of his snake, not—!”
Harry listens carefully. Apart from the gentle drip of water, he can hear something as well… A soft rustling like wings, and a clinking sound…
and they run the last of the way to avoid the worst of it. Draco is just about to grab the door handle, when the door swings open swiftly and they have to stagger back to avoid being mauled by a very morose-looking Hagrid.
After a moment, Harry feels the weight of Remus hand on his shoulder again but he doesn’t tear his eyes away from the shrinking dot that is the Hogwarts Express until it’s disappeared completely in the distance.
”Mentioned Draco getting attacked by that hippogriff last year and then went on to say you were dealing with some dangerous creatures right now that he’d bred himself, illegally according to Skeeter, or so she hinted anyway…”
”I’m… beginning to realise that…” the older man says quietly. ”Mister Potter, please resume your seat.”
Suddenly, they can hear the faint rustling of something slithering over the ground, like a cloak trailing over dead leaves. Harry’s heart hammers hard in his chest and he holds his breath, straining his ears… but whatever it was, moves away from them and soon the sound fades into the night again…
The blonde starts to back towards the bed, pulling Harry with him. They both tumble onto the bed in a heap of sprawling limbs, without once breaking their lip-lock.
Harry swallows thickly. He doesn’t even know where to start… Finally he just tells Remus about what happened in Care of Magical Creatures and how scared he’d been that Draco was seriously hurt. Remus nods in understanding, then studies him silently for a moment. Harry looks down and nibbles on the chocolate bar.
Draco breaks the kiss again with a chuckle, then pins Harry with a heated look and murmurs, ”Sounds good to me…”
”Are you”, Dumbledore says pleasantly, smiling at him over the top of his stapled hands. ”Please, do sit down, Harry… I hope you’ve had an enjoyable first week back at school?”
”No, you wouldn’t”, the voice of Ron Weasley pipes up on the other side of the curtain separating their beds.
The two men turn to look at him in surprise, and the fight dissipates as quickly as it flared up, along with the tension in Sirius shoulders.
He jogs up to the castle and across the Entrance Hall, but by the time he reaches the stairs to the dungeons he slows down. He doesn’t want to enter the Potions Master’s office panting like he’s run a marathon, sure Snape has made sure he’d be late for the meeting.
and get caught, then he’d be breaking not only his promise to his dads and Professor Snape to stay out of trouble, but his promise to Draco too…
and, curious, Harry pulls it out and balances it on his knee. As it falls open, a piercing, blood-curdling shriek rings out in the silence and Harry shuts the book again in panic, his heart hammering wildly in his chest, but the book continues screaming.
”Yes”, Draco murmurs against the side of his neck, moving his grip around Harry’s throbbing cock gently a few times.
pass an OWL without serious application, practise and study”, Professor McGonagall tells them grimly. ”But I see no reason why everybody in this class should not achieve an OWL in Transfiguration as long as they put in the work — yes, you too, Longbottom. There’s nothing wrong with your work, except lack of confidence—”
They reach the judges’ table and Professor Snape finally lets go of Harry’s arm and he stumbles forward, splashing mud all over the Beauxbatons’ robes as he stomps to a stop next to them.
”No, I don’t think so”, Harry shakes his head. ”It’s probably just people who think I’m barmy and wants to tell me so… I get them at the house all the time, except my dads get rid of them for me… I hope this won’t happen every morning from now on, though.”
He slowly leans away from Draco and grabs his things. Draco is watching him worriedly and he gives him a shaky smile.
”I have not been able to find many memories of Riddle from his time at Hogwarts”, Dumbledore continues. ”I have my own, of course. But, as I have already explained, he gave me a wide berth and at the time I was only too happy to let him… I have tried to source the memories of those who were closer to him, but alas, very few who knew him are keen to talk about him; they are too terrified. What I have managed to find is mostly from his time after leaving Hogwarts; I have with painstaking effort searched old records, questioned Muggle and wizard witnesses, and tracked down one or two who knew him that I were willing to trick into talking to me. They would tell me that Riddle was obsessed with his lineage, his parantage in particular. Having grown up in an orphanage, this is only understandable… it seems he searched in vain for Tom Riddle Senior on lists of Prefects in old school records and the shields in the trophy room whilst at Hogwarts — it is my belief that once it became irrefutable to him that his father had never attended Hogwarts, he decided to do away with his name and that is when he fashioned himself the name Voldemort.”
”Is that why I’m here?” he asks eagerly. ”You think we can use occlumency, or legilimency, to contact the other Harry? Sir?”
Sirius seems to weighing his words, but says nothing for a long moment. Harry sighs and starts talking again, anxious to make his dad see what he means.
”…it was through his efforts that our young friend here could be with us instead — Harry Potter, my guest of honour”, Voldemort continues pleasantly. ”But I daresay he needs no introduction… I’m told he is almost as famous as I am nowadays…
Acting on instinct, Harry reaches up and grabs the other’s boy bum, feeling the cheeks flex and tense in his grip as the boy continues to thrusts gently and carefully against him. Harry opens up a little more, allowing him to thrust deeper.
He waits for the last stragglers to file out of the classroom before he hoists his bag onto his shoulder and makes his way up to the front of the classroom. Snape looks up and narrows his eyes at him.
”Oh, the next time I saw him it was obvious. He’s not like you at all. I mean, a little bit, I suppose. The way you can be in public sometimes, that’s how he was… like, all the time…” Harry says, even as the memory of dancing really close with the blonde flickers to his to mind’s eye.
All throughout dinner Draco is back to his earlier, silent self again, like the scene in the Charms corridor never happened at all, and when the two of them make their way to Umbridge’s office just before seven, Harry shoots him a couple of sidelong looks but Draco keeps his eyes firmly fixed on the floor in front of him, his mouth set in a thin line.
Draco is already in his pyjamas when Harry enters the dorm. He looks up and meets Harry’s eyes as if he’d been expecting him and Harry thinks he probably was… He climbs onto the boy’s four-poster bed and sits cross-legged at the foot of it, leaning back against one of the posts as he waits for the other boy to speak.
”Yesss”, the man says in what is barely above a whisper, then gestures tersely to the chair in front of his desk.
This is my last chance to, he thinks as they all file inside the Time Room with ten minutes to spare. As if sensing his tboughts, Lupin offeres to give the two boys some privacy and leads Sirius to stand a few metres away. Harry feels his heart pounding, not quickly exactly. Just hard.
to kiss Draco so carelessly now? He’d definitely give it his best try, but he doubts he’d be able to keep his emotions at bay.
”Which means…” Dumbledore continues slowly. ”That some form of Viktor Krum must have reappeared… am I right, Harry?”
Blaise just shakes his head and looks away as Professor Trewlawny continues to instruct them to pair up and retrieve a set of teacups from the shelves. Harry quickly looks at Seamus and Blaise, but they shrug apologetically at him. Scowling, Harry turns to his other side and comes face to face with a sour-looking Millicent Bulstrode who instantly glares back and says she’s pairing up with Daphne.
Narcissa hands their tickets to the Ministry witch who whistles when she sees their seats, ”Top Box! Just head straight up the stairs and just keep going as high as you can…”
The class divides into ten small groups, each grabbing a Skrewt and dumping it inside one of the boxes before nailing the lid on. But the Skrewts, as it turns out, do
Harry would feel hurt, but he figures this Severus Snape must have a very different relationship to Harry Potter, which makes sense if the other Harry was Sorted into Gryffindor.
”Oh yeah… If she’d have been magical I’m sure she would have made a great Seeker, she was both quick and perceptive! What about you, Mr Finnigan, Mr Zabini, do either of you play?”
”Some alchemist, apparently. We don’t know exactly. And we still have no idea what Fluffy is guarding, but there is someone out there in the forest, someone who’s not supposed to be there, and they want whatever it is… By the sounds of it, they’ll do anything to get their hands on it…”
Remus arms have tightened steadily around Harry’s body throughout the story. Harry can feel them digging into his back and squeezing his lungs through the ribcage. But he welcomes the dull pain of it. He feels exhausted still and although his mind has been cleared of the befuddlement charm, he feels his mind begin to collapse on itself again... too much information... too much pain and suffering, it's not fair…. he remembers the young, terrified boy from the Pensieve… calling out for his mother and his father…
”Yes, well”, Remus mutters. ”It’s a weekday, so… We might miss them, if we wait until ten, won’t we… I’ll use the fireplace in the sitting room, you start breakfast…”
Professor Snape says nothing, but his face seems to twitch with the effort not to and Harry wonders if his dislike of Slughorn is just on a personal level or if he also thinks of the older man as an inferior Potions Master.
”Calm down, meerkat”, Remus mutters, but his lips twitch a little. ”But yes, I think we’ll have to. But I do think you’ll have to borrow Harry’s Invisibility Cloak, Draco. I don’t want to advertise your whereabouts more than necessary…”
”Yeah, maybe a little”, Harry agrees carefully. ”But if you make the team, you should definitely tell him he can buy the brooms — just think of the advantage we’d have over the other teams!”
”Actually, I’ll come with you”, Harry says and gathers up his books. ”I said I’d meet Draco in the library so…”
Harry shrugs, ”Believe what you want, doesn’t matter to me. I’ll be out of here in a couple of hours.”
”Then I believe we need to get back to the office… We have a deadline, after all”, she adds with a hard glint in her eyes, although her smile never wavers.
”Welcome, Death Eaters…” Voldemort says softly. ”Thirteen years it’s been since last we met… and yet you answer my call as though it was only yesterday… we are still united under the Dark Mark, then!
The other two boys seem less interested in his stories after that, exchanging a meaningful with each other that makes Harry feel exactly like the scum he thinks they probably see him as. When they get a chess board out, effectively ignoring him, Harry returns his attention the Quidditch magazine he’d found in the trunk down in the dorm.
Harry looks around at the other beds to make sure the other boys are sleeping, then walks over and sits down at the foot of Draco’s bed and tells him everything.
They have half an hour to kill before dinner and since they have Quidditch practise afterwards, Harry decides to write his weekly letter home now instead of doing it before bed like he usually does, so when they get to the Slytherin Common Room he plops down in one of the sofas in front of the fireplace and gets a quill and some parchment out of his bag.
”Hey…” Harry says as a thought strikes him. ”Aragog said the girl was found in a bathroom. The girl that got killed fifty years ago, she was killed in a bathroom on the second floor.”
Besides the gifts from his dads, Harry has received birthday cards and small gifts from a few of his Hogwarts friends and, to his astonishment, Hagrid the gamekeeper.
” Remus snaps. ”He’s my husband. He doesn’t give consent either. This whole thing is ridiculous. Harry is fourteen years old.
He feels nothing. Just a slightly tickling sensation, like travelling by floo. He opens his eyes… and blinks several times, his heart stuttering in his chest…
”No, hang on…” Blaise murmurs, gazing at Harry with calculating eyes. ”Thestrals are invisible to most people… the only ones who can actually see them are people who have seen death…”
But again, there is nothing there. Just an old oak tree with steadily shrinking shadows around it. A soft gust of wind hits him suddenly and he shivers, becoming aware of the cold sweat coating his skin for the first time.
carefree and Harry doesn’t buy it at all. Sure enough, when he looks over his shoulder he immediately sees the tension in the other boy’s shoulders.
before you can access the Common Room”, she says, her voice carrying loudly across the room despite the music playing.
He squeezes his eyes shut and turns his face away, into his pillow… Soft, comforting darkness envelops him…
”Severus, you cannot pretend this isn’t happening!” the harsch voice of Professor Karkaroff answers, sounding anxiously hushed and not at all smarmy as usual. ”It’s been getting clearer and clearer for months, I am becoming seriously concerned, I can’t deny it —”
”Let’s go, let’s go —” Snape snaps and tries to physically propel Harry around, but he slithers away and continues to struggle against his Head of House until the man finally grabs him by the arms and bends down to stare into his eyes. ”
”Was it…” Harry trails off miserably, struggling to get the words out and Remus just watches him patiently. ”Just before the holidays, the night of Slughorn’s Christmas Party, Draco and I… We… We had sex. Was it about that?”
Granger and the Hufflepuff boy both turn to look at him as well when Ron waves back. Granger gives Harry small smile as well, but the Hufflepuff boy stops dead in his tracks and stares back like he’s just seen a troll, then turns and speeds off towards the nearest entrance to the castle. Harry feels his slightly elevated mood sink abruptly again. Like a boulder in the lake.
”Shower”, Draco says simply and puts his things away before hanging the towel up to dry next to his bed.
”They’re a death omen”, Blaise says, squeezed in-between Pansy and Daphne in the seat across from them. ”They look like winged horses.”
dear!” Umbridge snaps. ”Now, as I was saying, you have been introduced to spells that have been complex, inappropriate to your age group and potentially lethal. You have been frightened into believing that you’re likely to run into Dark wizards every other day, but…” she lets out another tinkle of laughter, except it sounds decidedly strained now. ”How likely is that, really, if you think about it, I mean… who do you imagine would even
”Well, she would be, married a Muggle-born, Ted Tonks — great guy — you’ve met their daughter a couple of times, I don’t know if you remember, Nymphadora Tonks, but she hates it —”
When Dumbledore dispels the crowd, telling them to get to bed, Harry begins to look around for a a sign of blonde hair and is just moving away from Professor Snape when the man grabs him by the arm and fixes him with a hard look.
”And how are you going to get the Gryffindors to play spin the bottle sober—?” the other boy counters stubbornly, dodging the clawing movements of the blonde’s hands.
Professor Snape seems to be thinking along the same lines, because he says nothing at first. He just warily watches as Sirius moves back into the kitchen without a word and when he returns a moment later with five glasses hovering in the air in front of him, all containing a generous amount of amber liquid, he inclines his head towards Remus and murmurs a
”Brilliant!” Draco squeals. ”This isn’t magic — it’s logic — Oh, that’s so clever! Most people haven’t got an ounce of logic, they’d be stuck in here forever!”
”You, my dear, for example”, she says to Draco, who immediately tenses up as she comes to a stop just behind his chair. ”Were clearly born under the baleful influence of Saturn… Am I right in saying, my dear, that you were born in mid-winter?”
”I’m sorry about all this, Harry”, Remus says. ”But did you at least have a good time before this happened? How was the match?”
and Harry is pleasantly surprised to find his black and white presence next to Lockhart’s plum-coloured robes and golden curls quite comforting.
”My God, what an eyesore”, a woman’s voice can be heard over the sound of the horses. ”Couldn’t your father have that hovel cleared away, Tom?”
”That’s amazing, Harry…” Remus says and bends down to give him a quick kiss on the cheek, before walking back over to the stove to finish up breakfast. ”Are you going to open your other presents as well?”
Sirius shuffles in a moment later, taking the seat opposite and blindly reaching for the coffee pot whilst scanning the
”Yeah, well”, Sirius says shortly. ”What does it even matter? Think I’m proud of having a relative like her? As far as I’m concerned, she’s not my family. None of them are. I cut my ties with the lot of them when I was sixteen!”
”That… is confidential”, Dumbledore responds reluctantly, giving Harry a sympathetic look when he glowers at him. ”I’m sure Draco will tell you himself once he wakes up tomorrow.”
After having broken down in Herbology, a tearful Hannah Abbot stammered out that she is clearly too stupid to sit any exams and then requested dramatically to be taken out of school immediately. Professor Sprout, Hannah’s Head of House, kindly refused this request and sent her to the Hospital Wing and thus she became the first of many students to be given Calming Draughts by Madam Pomfrey.
”Look…” Harry says finally. ”I don’t care about winning the Tournament. I’ll just be happy to get out of it alive.”
”I will give you a moment”, Snape says quietly. ”I’ll meet you in the Headmaster’s Office — The password is Fizzing Whizzbees…”
”—even if he’s only inviting Slug Club members, it’s not necesarily safe—” Harry says, giving Pansy a small wave to let her know where they are.
”Be quiet”, Snape snaps coldly. ”I was not asking for information, I was merely commenting on Professor Lupin’s…”
Pansy, on the other hand, seems to take this newfound interest and the association with Granger that comes with it as a personal insult. And even though she hasn’t said as much to any of them out loud, Harry definitiely thinks the girl’s eyes carries the furious glint of someone expecting an attack or conspiracy at any moment. As if Granger was the Trojan horse of the House of Gryffindor, come to steal Draco away.
Harry gasps as the blonde’s wand seems to explode, hurriedly steeling himself for the assault, but nothing happens… But the crowd gasps and a few students even scream and whimper. Harry frowns in confusion, but then he looks down and sees it… a long black snake slithers towards him on the floor. Harry blinks.
It hadn’t occurred to Harry before, but watching his boyfriend clamber out of the cart and scurry into the vault with quick, jerky movements and return seconds later, obviously desperate to get moving again, he realises the blonde must have been anxious about running into his father while down here.
He spins around and, ignoring the stares from the other students and the disapproving glare from Madam Pince, he storms out of the library. Harry swings the book bag onto his shoulder and it knocks against the small of his back hard enough to brusie, but Harry doesn’t care. In fact, he almost welcomes the dull throbbing… It gives him something else to focus on, something other than the fury that’s coiling inside him like some aggravated snake getting ready to strike —
”Oh…” Draco blinks in surprise, his gaze flitting to Harry’s right hand fleetingly. ”I don’t know. I think she might have been fired — I mean, the official story is she resigned because she was needed at the Ministry.”
—!” the shop assistant cries from the midst of the retreating crowd, murmuring and moving away from the fight like a herd of startled sheep.
”It’s the magic that knows”, Remus corrects mildly. ”Or rather, magic just is what is. We use spells to make sense of it or utilise it. Harry’s essence is like that of a swift, so when magic is asked to channel that essence into a shape — in my patronus or in Harry’s animagus — that’s the shape it goes for.”
”Oh yeah… We completely forgot about those…” Sirius says lightly, gently prying the empty coffee cup from Harry’s hand before he takes a seat on the sofa on the other side of him.
”Yeah”, Seamus says. ”I tried telling him… the others have been taking the class for three years already, so they have background knowledge that he’s missing. If he wasn’t so damn proud, I could help him.”
A big drop of ink falls from the tip of Harry’s quill and splatters onto his Potions essay and he swears quietly, moving the quill away from the parchment. His hands are trembling, he realises. For some reason that makes him even angrier, and he glares at the row of books separating him from the anonymous Hufflepuff running his mouth…
He remembers the Umbridge of the other world, frazzled and paranoid in the Hospital Wing and Ron Weasley telling him that the other Harry and Granger had lured her into the Dark Forest and got her abducted by the centaurs.
”Er… t-two un… unforgivables?” Dawlish repeats hesitantly, eyes flitting between Remus and Harry uncomfortably. ”That’s… that’s what Harry, erm, says happened, is it…?”
The stands erupt in cheers and applause, but all Harry can think about it the horrors that await him inside the maze and how he’ll have no way of signalling for help… how could he have been so stupid? He should have thought about this, he should have asked someone about it…
Voldemort pulls his hand back suddenly as if to slap the other man across the face, but instead the silvery mask covering it evaporates into smoke… for the first time, Harry can see Lucius’ deathly pale face. His eyes keep flitting between Voldemort’s chest and face, wide with fear.
Harry automatically bends down and snatches the Invisibility Cloak from the floor, before stumbling after his Head of House. He means to tell him there’s no point, he’ll have to forfeit the Second Task anyway… but the words don’t seem to want to form on his tongue.
”Well, kind of… My dads made me promise not to go sneaking out of the castle anymore and they made me leave my — Ehm — Yeah, anyway”, he trails off awkwardly, realising he probably shouldn’t start a rumour about owning an Invisibility Cloak, but judging by the knowing looks on the two older boys’ faces, he has a sneaking suspicion that their younger brother has already told them all about it.
”Oh of c-course”, Quirrell says with a slight nod. ”I’ve g-g-got to pick up a new b-book on vampires m-myself…”
”Mr Malfoy, please have a seat…” Dumbledore says calmly, indicating the chair next his own and waiting patiently for Draco to comply before turning back to Harry with a kind look. ”Harry, I must ask you to bear with us for a moment… A lot of things have happened in the last twenty-four hours, as I’m sure you’ll agree?”
Ron throws the Slytherins another venomous look, then storms back to loveseat he’d been sharing with Lavender Brown and grumbles something. The girl immediately nods in agreement.
Harry hurries to follow Riddle out of the office. They make their way through the castle, following the all-too-familiar path down to the dungeosn… Harry glances up into the other boy’s face every so often, still struck by his handsome features but also the tense look of determination on his face…
The bell rings, cutting the professor off finally and he holds out his arms as if to say, Alas, I cannot continue regale you with the stories of my victories! and Harry knows, because he’s said those exact words in the past, while raising his arms in this exact way.
”But maybe you’d actually have to be related to Slytherin to open it, so Dumbledore couldn’t —” Dean Thomas pipes up from the Gryffindor side of the classroom, but Binns has obviously had enough.
”Yes”, McGonagall says. ”We’ll have to send them all home in the morning… I’m afraid this is the end of Hogwarts —”
A large crimson and golden bird appears in the fire, its long tail feathers gleaming like gold and a brown bundle clasped in its talons… Flapping its swan-like wings, it soars down towards them… Riddle ducks, but the bird soars past him and lands on top of Harry’s shoulder instead, the bundle falling to the floor in front of them.
”Oh yes…” Moody whispers. ”I hasn’t been easy, I’ve had to use every ounce of cunning I possess to get you through these tasks… although I have to say, you improved significantly after the first one. I was very pleased indeed that I didn’t have to aid you at all in the second one. And I knew, as long as I got you in that maze, preferably with a head start, then I could get you to that Cup… you may have noticed you barely ran into any obstacles inside that maze, well that was because I was patrolling around it, keeping an eye on you…”
Harry watches curiously as the dial whirrs back to zero after each number Sirius dials, until finally, the sequence of numbers is finished and a woman’s voice greets them.
Selina appears in the doorway, stretching her front paws out in front of her and then twitches her back paws slightly as she pads over to him and rubs up against his legs with a purr.
Harry feels colder and colder the more Professor Snape speaks, his hands and face growing numb and his heart beating a steady tattoo in his tight chest.
Harry finds Seamus and Blaise still hanging out in the Common room and challenges the Irish boy to a game of Exploding Snap as soon as Blaise has slaughtered him in yet another game of Wizarding Chess.
Harry stretches out languidly, craning his neck over the rounded edge of a shoulder and squirming as he feels a familiar length of soft flesh hardening along the crack of his arse…
Harry turns around and stares up at the ancient statue of Salazar Slytherin. The massive stone mouth opens, wider and wider, revealing a huge dark hole… As soon as Harry senses movement in the darkness, he squeezes his eyes shut —
”Then I insist upon resubmitting the names of the rest of my students”, Karkaroff exclaims. ”You will set up the Goblet of Fire once more and we will continue adding names until each school has two champions! It’s only fair—!”
He’s not entirely sure where he’s going, he’s just desperate for a friendly face and the only person that springs to mind is Sirius so he decides to make his way out of the castle and try and find his way back to the little house in Hogsmeade where Sirius lives with Lupin. It would be easier to sneak out of the castle if he had his Cloak, or the Marauder’s Map, but at least he knows the secret passageways off by heart and he figures as long as he’s very careful to avoid ghosts and patrolling professors, he should be able to get out. But just to be on the safe side, he refrains from using a
”Indeed, Sir”, the house-elf confirms, nodding his head vigorously, his ears flapping and tears spilling all over his small face. ”I is hiding and waiting for Harry Potter to arrive and sealing the gateway — I is having to iron my hands afterwards —”
swirls to the front of Harry’s mind, of sitting at the kitchen table in Creirwyn’s Hollow drinking coffee with Sitius and idly watching Draco and Remus cook together, Draco carefully mincing a glove of garlic and Remus instructing him to crush them with the side of the blade first…
… He forces himself to drown the commentary out and starts squinting for the Snitch again. On the other side of the pitch, McLaggen is zipping back and forth above the goal hoops, clearly having been given different instructions from his team captain —
Miss Granger!” Snape snaps, then turns back to Longbottom again. ”At the end of the lesson, we will feed a few drops of your potion to your toad and see what happens to it, Longbottom. Perhaps that will finally encourage you to
He beams at them all in turn and although none of them smile back, he keeps grinning and bounces excitedly on his feet.
Sirius gives him a hand and Harry gingerly stands up and then sways momentarily as he gets his bearing back. Draco immediately slips his arm around his back and nestles into his side and Harry gratefully leans into him.
On Sunday evening, a large end of term feast is served in the Great Hall at dinner before the Hogwarts Express is due take them all home for the holidays in the morning, and you would think it’s the last meal of their lives judging by the subdued mood that hangs heavily over the Hall.
More students begin to titter. Harry himself is torn though, as much as he rather have Professor Grubbly-Plank back as their Care of Magical Creatures teacher, his hatred for Umbridge is significantly stronger than his dislike for Hagrid’s idea of teaching, and besides he does feel a bit bad for Hagrid. After all, even though he might be a giant oaf, he does mean well and Umbridge is clearly prejudiced against him because he’s part giant — or, as she would say,
Harry loses his balance and falls to the ground heavily. With his heart pounding in his chest, he begins to scramble backwards, kicking Mr Crouch off.
He keeps replaying the scene in his mind, trying to work out what it all means… Dumbledore looking right at him and saying he wouldn’t be
, Harry…” Dumbledore says quietly, leaning forward over the desk to give him a meaningful look over the rim of his glasses.
”Truth, I guess”, the boy says warily. ”If I don’t want to answer I take a swig? Is that how it works?”
When it’s time to go to Hogsmeade, Harry is one of the first students to queue up in front of Filch, more or less bouncing on his feet in excitement, much to Seamus and Blaise’s amusement. The three of them make the trek together, stopping by Honeydukes and Zonko’s before Harry waves goodbye to them outside the Three Broomsticks and makes his way to the other side of the small town.
”Fine. Malfoy”, Harry says pleasantly and closes the textbook again, and meets his eyes with a serene smile. ”Can I help you with anything?”
”What? What?” a haggard-looking Remus hollers as he hurtles inside the lounge, his sleep-swollen eyes flicking wildly around the room before they land on Sirius and Harry kneeling together in the middle of the floor. ”Harry!”
Giving his dads a nervous smile, Harry gets to his feet. The Slytherin table erupts in cheers and applause and he ducks his head, smiling shyly. Darting forward to give both his dads a quick hug, and discretely brushing his hand over the back of Draco’s arm before straightening up again, Harry gives his friends a final wave before he walks out of the Great Hall.
”Just ignore him”, he hears Granger hiss across the courtyard and she then pulls Ron away just as the boy’s ears start growing red.
Harry lets his own gaze linger on their undulating forms, veering over to Draco and noticing how his arms are decidedly thicker than his own Draco’s, thicker, firmer, muscles flexed under the flimsy fabric of his shiny shirt…
”Blaise — Harry — oh, and Draco, too — welcome, welcome!” Slughorn booms happily as they all approach, the red tazzles on his hat bobbing happily around his head. ”Come in, come in! There are so many people I want to introduce you all to — but first things first, let me greet your guests — who do we have —?”
Harry is suddenly pushed hard in the chest by an invisible force and goes flying backwards, staggering unsteadily as he tries to keep his footing, but almost instantly loses his balance and falls back against the wall of shelves behind him. He hears something
Snapping his head up in surprise, Harry blinks owlishly at his dad suddenly standing in the doorway. The man has got his hands shoved into his pockets and is leaning sideways against the doorframe, frowning at the floor between them uncomfortably.
Zabini gives him a taunting look, a perfectly shaped eyebrow arching delicately over one of his dark eyes. ”Now now Seamus… You’re a big boy, it’s time you had a shower all by yourself.”
Harry shakes himself out of his shock and immediately starts tearing the wrapping paper off, gasping as the brand new broom is revealed to be the new Nimbus 2000 and lets out a delighted squeal, before launching himself at Sirius who laughs as he hugs him back, ”I think he likes it!”
As if sensing his approaching presence, Sirius and Remus steps out of the front door to great him inside the small gate and Harry launches himself at Remus first and hugs him tightly. He realises too late that his daddy might still be in pain and quickly looses his grip again and stammers out an apology, but Remus just pulls him back in and tightens the embrace even further before burying his nose in his favourite spot on Harry’s neck to inhale deeply. Harry smiles happily.
”I need to tell my dads about Umbridge and the blood quill”, Harry admits and the blonde blinks in surprise. ”And I need to do it today, or Snape will tell them at half-term. But I’ll wait until it’s time for us to go back to Hogwarts and… and you can wait outside, if you want…”
”Oh, who cares”, Seamus mutters on the other side of Draco. ”He’s probably just here to see Dumble-bore and caught the Hogwarts Express for the free fare…”
Harry deflates a little. He knew that, of course. And he knew she’d be here even if he wasn’t, because she just wants to help. Because that’s the kind of person Granger is, she’s a helpful, goody twoshoes Gryffindor and, as much as Harry hates to admit it, that doesn’t disgust him half as much as it probably should. It’s annoying, but also pretty awesome.
He’s been sitting on the question ever since they made their way back from the Astronomy Tower, but it didn’t feel safe to ask it until now.
”We shall resume your lesson tomorrow evening. Same time. And you better do your exercises before bed tonight, have I made myself clear?”
Sitting up slowly, Harry twists around to face the other boy. Draco sighs heavily and props himself up on his elbows.
Both girls exchange a sly look and smile coolly, before darting their eyes over to Harry and he shifts uncomfortably.
Inside the dorm, Malfoy keeps pulling on his hand, obviously intent on heading towards Harry’s bed and as Harry let himself be lead, he feels like his heart might explode out of his chest at any minute. The blonde sinks down on the bed and gently pulls him down next to him with a smile.
He feels cool glass touch his lips and opens his mouth to drink the potion. It burns down his throat and fills him with warmth. He coughs a little and splutters, but manages to get it all down. His daddy murmuring encouraging nonsense to him the whole time and then gently lowers his head again. Harry feels his muscles relax as the shock and adrenaline is drained from his system. His mind feels thick and cottony inside his head, and waves of exhaustion travels through his body.
Harry glances around the classroom to see his classmates progress. Draco is already on to the next step, trying to cut into his Sopophorous Beans. It looks like they’re putting up quite the fight, slipping under the blade of the blonde’s knife. Harry can see that the other students who are slightly ahead of him are having the same problem. Granger is getting increasingly frustrated, her beans slipping and shooting across the desk as though trying to escape her knife.
of having Sirius’s fingers combing through his hair and Remus’s strong arms around his body, and of the
But when Draco giggles softly and his insides flutter pleasantly again, he thinks he would happily play a starved vampire and stuff his face with lettuce every day for the rest of the school year as long as it made Draco that happy.
He rights himself on the broom and ducks as the bludger makes one final attempt to hit him, then gently touches down on the ground, still clutching the snitch since he’s the last person to try out. He hands the small ball to Flint who gives him an appraising look.
”Yeah”, Goyle grunts, his beady eyes flitting over to Draco and Umbridge immediately turns to him instead.
”Harry”, Dumbledore says. ”Madam Pomfrey says she can’t find anything wrong with you physically, so I don’t see any reason why you can’t return to your dorm…”
In the next few days, Harry carefully goes through the motions of everyday life, maintaining his new, stiff smile throughout so as not to reveal his inner turmoil to Draco and his dads. But he probably doesn’t need to bother, considering they’re all so preoccupied with their own worries to really notice.
”My mother wasn’t a very nice woman, not very forgiving… We didn’t have any contact with each other after I told her about me and Remus. She didn’t like that, you see. It wasn’t in accordance with the pureblood tradition. But you know all about that…” he gives Draco a meaningful nod.
Harry swivels his glower around to him, but it immediately melts and he leans in for a brief but heartfelt kiss.
”But how come no-one’s been killed this time then?” Blaise says. ”They’ve all been petrified, no-one’s actually died… Did they not look in its eyes for long enough, or something?”
Harry gazes longingly at the door of the Three Broomsticks as they shuffle past. The golden glow of the fire and lanterns inside is spilling out through the windows, promising warmth. He’s just about to suggest to the others that they make a brief butterbeer stop in there before heading to Creirwyn’s Hollow, if only to regain feeling in his feet before continuing up the hill, but he’s distracted by the sight of Aberforth standing around just behind the corner along with another, shorter man.
”I think… that will do for now, Harry…” Dumbledore says softly, gesturing for him to leave the Pensieve again.
”You have done well to tell me this”, he tells the man. ”Very well… It seems I have wasted months on fruitless schemes… I only wish that you would have told me sooner… But no matter… We begin again, from now. You have Lord Voldemort’s gratitude, Rookwood.”
He straightens up with a deep breath and looks around curiously. They’re standing in the middle of nowhere. Technically, he supposes, they’re standing in a large field with an equally large forest next to it.
”, Madam Malkin exclaims. ”Young man, come back here this instant — let me do the stitching, before the pins fall out and we’ll have to start over—!”
On the morning of the fourteenth, Harry slowly wakes up feeling warmer and cosier than he’s ever felt before, with something nuzzling the back of his neck. He stretches out languidly and is pleasantly surprised to find himself cocooned in a warm embrace with a solid chest pressed against his back. Surprised, because he didn’t go to sleep next to anyone, but clearly Draco has decided to crawl into his bed at some point during the night — or maybe just now, to wake him up.
Harry stares at the man’s beaming face now and wonders if it’s real. Is he really that naive, or is it all an act? He’s been trying to help Harry all year.
”, she mutters to dry off the parchment, before rolling it up and tucking it back into her book bag.
”Harry, is everything okay?” Remus asks him worriedly, caressing the side of his face whilst peering into his eyes.
Draco immediately grabs Harry’s hand and gives it a gentle squeeze. Harry tilts his head back and looks up at him, his smile wavering as it suddenly strikes him how much the blonde has grown over the summer.
Ron nods his agreement and they make their way out into the Entrance Hall and walk over to the open oak doors for some fresh air. As they reach the doors, they notice several massive rose bushes that have been planted on the lawn over night, growing high and connecting at the top, creating a sort of grotto twinkling with fairy lights… In the middle of the grotto stands several statues of what appears to be Father Christmas and his reindeer.
But then it hits him… The foulest stench he’s ever come across, like a mixture of old socks and public toilet, washes over him and he almost gags.
”Me too”, Blaise pipes up on the other side if Draco. ”I don’t get why though… My essay was bloody brilliant. I even added
”I can tell”, Malfoy says immediately. ”Now I can. I didn’t see it before, because I didn’t know to look for it. But… You’re very different.”
, since the lesson just before lunch is in fact double Defence Against the Dark Arts with the Gryffindors — and he makes sure to grab a seat at the very back of the classroom, hoping to hide as much as possible without skiving off the lesson altogether, so that Lockhart won’t embarrass him further in front of everyone.
”I know”, Draco murmurs immediately, fisting the fabric of Harry’s robes at his sides and nudging the side of his head with his nose. ”I know, I just…”
”Hey cub… your dad said you wanted me to let you know I got back alright?” Remus whispers and Harry feels his fingers card through his hair. ”I’m fine, pup… go back to sleep…”
Draco follows his gaze and watches the two girls with an unreadable look on his face. Pansy is coolly sipping her drink and looking everywhere else but at the frizzy-haired Gryffindor girl next to her, until Granger says something. Then she pretends to notice her. She makes the same movement Harry has seen her make a million times whenver she flicks her long hair over her shoulder. Even though her hair is now done up, she manages to make the movement seem natural and Harry smiles fondly as she lets her whole body follow in its momentum, turning squarely towards Granger and fluttering her eyelashes in an
Harry finds his gaze wandering from the magnified stare of Mister Worple, back to the vampire by his side. Sanguini, although handsome, has dark shadows under his eyes and a slightly emaciated look about him like he hasn’t been fed in a while.
”Yes, yes, I see it”, Ogden says hurriedly, concerned for the young woman as she begins to gasp and splutter around her father’s tight grip.
”Of course you’ve looked death in the face before, haven’t you?” she says offhandedly, but her gaze remains intense and pinned on his, catching his every blink and every muscle-twitch in his face. ”Do you think that it was the trauma of your past that made you keen to prove yourself in this Tournament? To live up to your name?”
The night air seems to lose its chill suddenly and Harry coughs, clutching the darkness in front of him a little tighter and feels silky hair brush his knuckles…
They stay in the kitchen and keep chatting well into the afternoon, cradling their empty coffee cups as they exchange Hogwarts stories and for the first time ever, Harry almost feels like an equal to his dad, not just his kid but an actual almost-adult person, talking like friends… it’s not until it’s time for Sirius to go get Remus that he realises they’ve completely forgotten about lunch.
Sirius Side-Alongs Harry to the Apparation point around the corner from the Ministr’s visitors’ entrance, concealed inside a muggle communications’ cubicle called a ’fone-box’ and once they’ve crammed themselves inside it, Sirius lifts the top off the clunky muggle contraption and then carefully turns a dial halfway round, until his finger reaches the number six. He then lets the dial roll back to the beginning with a whirring sound, before he turns it again, this time to number two.
”That’s a good idea”, Narcissa says with another incline of her head, before she turns to Draco and places the tips of her fingers gently on top of his shoulder. ”Draco darling, why don’t you take Harry to Florean Fortescue’s for an ice cream… Mr Lupin and I will join you shortly.”
He’s immediately aware of stepping inside the Time Room, recognising the sound of whirring and clicking from all the clocks. This time, when he’s directed to stop, the blindfold disappears from his face again and he blinks in the sudden brightness.
Blaise seems to silently battle the inner turmoil caused by the girl’s comments for another moment, but then he gazes out in the room.
Flicking past the human languages eagerly, he begins to tap the creature languages with his wand, one at the time, and instructing the book to give him examples of what they sound like by giving it random sentences like
”I’m not that short for my age”, Harry protests feebly, but the small pile of presents at the foot of the bed is already stealing his attention and he eagerly scrambles over to rip into the first one.
”So you actually stick to it, do you, Harry?” Skeeter asks sharply. ”That He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back? You stand by all this garbage Dumbledore’s been telling everybody about You-Know-Who returning and you being the sole witness?”
Harry glances up and follows the girl’s line of sight. Krum is slouched at the end of the Legal Section, throwing surreptitious looks over at the table where Granger is studying with Ron and Longbottom, apparently oblivious to the small herd of giggling girls lounging half a bookcase away from him.
I know that Draco’s eating disorder was a bit triggering for some readers even though it was only mentioned briefly here and there, so I’ve already decided to not going to go into much detail about that even though it will continue to be a feature in Draco’s character arc. I have also touched on Harry’s issues and hinted at PTSD after the Triwizard cup already, and that is something I’d like explore further.
He wets his lips in anticipation and holds his breath as he waits… His heart is beating so hard, he’s sure Draco must be able to hear it… Suddenly soft lips brush against his own and it sends tingles all through his body. His fingers twitch uncertainly, unsure of whether it’s okay for him to reach out, to grab, to —
Blaise catches him by the fabric of his jumper and he twists and turns, ending up sprawled on his back on the floor, spluttering in protest. Blaise straddles him and plants a quick kiss on the side of his mouth, then lets him go roughly and stands up again.
”Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy, withdrawals”, he tells the goblin in a clear and steady voice, but no louder than absolutely necessary.
He finally drifts off to sleep, only to dream about rain-wet kisses in thunderstorms and long, slender fingers gripping him through damp robes… Like
Harry turns his face to peer down at his boyfriend, narrowing his eyes at the twitching smirk and glittering silver eyes.
The Great Hall explodes in relieved applause and giggles, just as the tables are magically filled with steaming hot meals. Harry’s stomach growls at the sight and smell of home-cooked food and he eagerly starts to fill his plate.
The twins set off for the Hospital Wing, accompanied by their friend Lee Jordan, all three of them still laughing hysterically. Harry and Draco watches them pass, Harry grinning and Draco snorting derisively (although Harry did see the corner of his mouth twitch.)
I think —” Remus says eagerly, moving over to the pantry and digging through the contents with an almost childlike enthusiasm that makes Harry grin. ”Yes, we do! Harry, do you want a piece?”
”Having a lie-in”, Sirius says nonchalantly and turns away to survey Harry’s half-packed trunk. ”Your breakfast is on the table, you go eat while I finish packing your school stuff, okay?”
They fly past Hogsmeade and straight to the castle grounds, touching down right next to the massive gates. Harry scrambles out of the sidecar, eager to stretch his legs and Sirius kills the engine but stays seated on the bike, glaring at the gates as he pulls off his leather gloves. Harry follows his line of sight curiously.
”Thank you, Headmaster”, the toad-woman says in a simpering, high-pitched voice that makes the hairs in the back of Harry’s neck stand. ”for those kind words of welcome…
Harry sticks the battered key into the lock and turns it. The door swings open, revealing a pitch black room. The three boys enter cautiously with their arms out-stretched to feel for any obstacles. But as soon as the door slides shut again behind them, light suddenly floods the chamber and they gasp as a huge chess set with life-sized chessmen is revealed.
The rest of the Potions lesson passes by without incident, which is quite remarkable for a class with Longbottom as well as Crabbe and Goyle in it.
”Yeah”, Draco croaks. ”He thinks the threat will be enough to make them reconsider and I won’t actually have to go through with it…”
Then suddenly, he feels a large hand grip his shoulder and give him a rough jostle, dislodging his grip from the thestral. He feels panic flare up in his chest and his heart begins to hammer wildly.
”So… if you’re tutoring me, but I’m not allowed to stay here, then… am I going to stay with you?” Harry says slowly.
The hooded figure snaps its head up and stares right at Harry, who can only stare in horror, rooted to the spot, as the figure slowly stands up, silvery blood from the unicorn dribbling down its’ front as he prowls around the dead animal and starts advancing on Harry…
Again, his mind is flooded with images of his dads; horrible fantasies of the look on their faces as his dead and mangled body is dumped on their doorstep, like some hateful special delivery in the green glow from the Dark Mark conjured over the cottage… and he imagines Dumbledore standing up in front of the whole school in the Great Hall and making a small speech where he tells them all, and then Trelawny nodding sombrely as if to say,
Suddenly said eyes flicker over to lock with Harry’s and for a moment he experiences the oddest sensation; it’s like someone has put both of their hands against his mid-section and forcefully pressed all the air out of his body.
”I needed to tell Diggory something about the first task — no, listen! — I found out something about the first task today and I wanted to let Diggory know, but we only talked for about five minutes! Then Professor Moody showed up and wanted to speak to me — I swear — Diggory went inside and I spent all that time talking to Moody!”
Heart lodged in his throat, Harry follows the now unmistakable sound of someone crying to the boys bathroom at the end of the corridor. The door is left slightly ajar and Harry inches closer to the crack. Someone —
”Is he always that nervous?” Harry asks quietly and Remus chuckles. ”Yeah, ’fraid so… He’s got a brilliant mind, so they say. As long as he was just learning about the Dark Arts through books, he was fine. But then he took a year off to get some real, first-hand experience and he’s never been quite the same…”
On the morning of the first of September Harry is abruptly awoken by a sudden explosion of light as the window blinds are pulled up. He groans and curls up, pulling the cover over his head to shield himself from the bright morning sun, but he’s barely managed to secure the fabric around his head when the whole thing is wrenched away from him.
The sixteen-year-old points lazily to something on the floor next to the giant statue’s left foot. Harry immediately recognises the diary…
”I’m asking for Hermione”, the Weasley girl says quickly, glancing over at the blonde as well and realising she may have stepped on some toes.
”Okay”, he says, nodding. ”Okay, let’s do that. If we do that, we can go to the party — actually it’s probably good that I go, I need to get closer to Slughorn, I forgot to tell you!”
Professor Snape seems even stonier now than he’d been during their Potions lesson before lunch. His impossibly white face looks drawn and he keeps pressing his lips together grimly.
literally explodes out of her mouth with such force that her hands fly away from her mouth, and she more or less dives out the door to a deafening roar of laughter that erupts from the students (and some teachers) behind her.
Remus lets out an impatient huff and waves a dismissive hand at Draco’s exclaimation, ”It’s not like you
”Caractacus Burke was not known for his generosity”, Dumbledore comments. ”But thanks to him, we know that near the end of her pregnancy, Merope was alone in London and in desperate need of gold, desperate enough to sell her one and only valuable possession, the locket that was one of Marvolo’s treasured family heirlooms.”
”Oh. He had to go to the library… As well… Seems like it’s the place to be these days… Anyway, how are you? How’s your sister getting on?”
”—but I know he secretly wanted to be Seeker all along. He told me once, back in First Year. He tried out for Seeker every year a well, but Bickering kept insisting she needed him as Chaser. So as soon as she graduated and James was made Team Captain, obviously he made himself Seeker — and he turned out to be a natural at that too! We were all astonished, and a little envious — weren’t we Moony?” Sirius turns to the other man excitedly.
Harry takes a deep breath, holds it for a few seconds and just sits in the sensation of his heart pumping desperately. Then he slowly lets it go…
Harry’s heart stutters; there on the floor in front of the statue’s feet, a small body lies crumpled. Harry would recognise the bright red hair anywhere.
”They’ve run plenty of horrible stories about Harry without my help lately…” Skeeter retorts, then gives Harry another sideways look. ”How does that make you feel, Harry? Betrayed? Distraught? Misunderstoo—?”
Heart sinking, Harry walks up to the window next to his four-poster bed and stares out into the murky darkness and tries to think… Where would Draco go?
But the fact of the matter is that Harry always struggled to absorb information from just reading books or listening to lectures (especially when they’re by the likes of Umbridge, who repels curiosity) and finds it a lot easier to connect the dots and memorise facts when he puts them into a practical context — and because Umbridge has forbidden them to actually perform any of the defensive spells they’ve been learning all year, there is a significant risk that Harry will fail the theoretical
He averts his eyes from a muggle poster of a naked woman and blushes in embarassment and Sirius snickers next to him and asks cheekily,
… We could invite the Weasley children, and maybe the Lovegood girl as well, and have an Order meeting at the same time—”
Sorry it's taken me so long to update -- I was away for a month, performing at Edinburgh Fringe Festival :)
Harry and Sirius are still engrossed in a silent argument over who’s turn it is to speak some sense into Remus, so they’re both pleasantly surprised when Draco pipes up, ”What about our morning classes, Remus?”
”Oh — no, Professor, see —” Harry tries to explain, but Lockhart just keeps shaking his head and grinning like a madman.
”Hi boys…” Diggory says in his best Lockhart impression, tearing his eyes away from Draco and sweeping them all over the group, leaving the blonde blushing a bright pink. ”Good to be back.”
”Dumbledore wants you taught what it feels like”, Moody says gruffly, his magical eyes spinning around and fixing steadily on the frizzy-haired girl. ”But if you rather learn the hard way, when someone’s putting it on you so they can control you completely, fine by me! You’re excused — off you go!”
The young man’s head rolls on top of his shoulders and a smile slowly breaks out on his face, his eyelids fluttering more than ever as if he’s remembering a dream.
The walk to the dungeons is just as tense as the walk from the gates and Harry wonders whether he should apologise to the professor for suspecting him of consorting with Voldemort last year, or if he should just pretend like nothing is wrong until it feels like nothing actually is. But before he’s had a chance to make his mind up, they reach the hidden entrance to the Slytherin Common Room.
”Eager though I know all of you are to bring the Triwizard Cup to Hogwarts”, Dumbledore continues after a moment of letting the news sink in and the students all fall silent once more and give him their full attention. ”The Heads of the participating schools, along with the Ministry of Magic, have agreed to impose an age restriction on contenders this year. Only students who are of age — that is to say, seventeen years or older — are allowed to put forward their names for consideration—”
Harry is so excited about the concert that he completely forgets about what’s about to happen, until Ron prods his arm insistently and he looks around to see the other champions and their partners standing.
Again, Dumbledore’s keen blue eyes are peering at him over the top of his glasses, but they aren’t twinkling so much as boring into him.
Embarrased at being caught staring and eavesdropping, Harry immediately looks down at his breakfast and doesn’t look up again until they’re all standing up to leave.
Ginny gives them a furious look and fumbles with shaking hands to retrieve her book from the floor, then spins on her heel and runs out of sight.
he thinks, feeling rather foolish for thinking so in the first place. They’re all addressed to different people, or maybe the same person but addressed with different pet names, Harry concedes. But whoever they are, they’re clearly in some kind of romantic relationship with Malfoy because all the pet names are sickeningly sweet and silly, like
Shadows exploding into light, bending, curving; Draco is getting on the Hogwarts Express, not turning back; it starts to drizzle;
The compartment door slides open again and Harry turns to see another red-haired boy with freckles, younger than the twins but almost as tall. Harry guesses he must be their little brother and he smiles awkwardly at him.
Remus just stares at him silently, his wide eyes unwavering and intense. Then slowly, he reaches into the inside pocket of his robes and retrieves his wand.
”It’s nice to he here when you’re not injured, for a change…” Remus says wryly. ”How about giving us a tour?”
”Yeah, he seemed to have a bit of a crush on him. So I told him he should go for it. You never know unless you try, right?”
Then taking a deep breath to steel himself, Harry reaches out his hand to brush his numb fingers against the one of the gleaming handles…
”You know, if the pink-eye curse fails and you can’t summon your broom, plan C could be to just chuck Draco at it…” Blaise says lightly.
Remus sighs heavily and keeps rubbing Harry’s back for a moment, then murmurs ”You scared all of us, pup…”
They’re halfway through the game, when the other two shuffle inside the room. Lupin is levitating four steaming mugs and a basket of buns in the air in front of him and Malfoy is clutching the blanket at his front. It trails behind him like a cape. They sit down next to Harry and Sirius and watch them play for a moment and with each move, Malfoy seems to shake his earlier state more and more, his facial features steadily morphing back to the sneering ferret face that Harry is used to, emitting tiny noises of disgust and protest whenever Harry gets one of his pieces killed.
The Potions Master disappears into an adjoining room and Harry can hear him tinker with something. He follows, but hesitates in the doorway. It’s a kitchen. A very normal kitchen. Snape is even filling up a kettle with water. In a way, Harry thinks the normalcy is even more bizarre than discovering that the man sleeps in a coffin or hanging from rafters.
Harry walks up to the mirror and Quirrell stands back to let him have a proper look. At first, there is nothing in the mirror’s reflection that shouldn’t be there. No invisible people standing behind Harry, like the last time he looked into it. Only him. Except… There is something slighty off about his face… Harry can’t be sure, of course, since he has no other means of seeing his own face, but it seems odd to him that his reflection is smirking… And also, there seems to be no streaks of tears on his face, but Harry can definitely feel the chill on his cheeks where some of the tears have yet to dry…
”That was brilliant”, Seamus chortles as they head down the corridor and the others readily agree with him.
Harry had hoped that he would get used to occluding the more he tried it, and get better at it. But it seems the opposite is true in this case as well. It seems to get harder and harder to force Professor Snape out of his mind again once the man has delved in, and it also gets harder and harder to endure the experience of having him in there. By his third attempt, Harry’s head is pounding worse than ever and he is shivering violently from the cold sweat coating his skin.
”O-Okay, okay, we’ll go see Dumbledore…” he says as calmly as he can. ”If you just… let go of me and get up, I’ll… I’ll take you up to the castle, okay?”
Harry can’t help but stare in amazement at the creature. He’s seen a unicorn once before, in First Year when he and Draco served their detention with Hagrid in the forest, but that unicorn had been dead already and it was so dark in the forest that he’d barely been able to make it out on the forest floor… not to mention Voldemort himself had been huddled over the creature’s carcass, drinking its blood at the time… this unicorn however is decidedly alive and so white that the snow around it seems almost grey in comparison.
”Hello Harry, we’re so pleased to have you visit our home… Draco, do show Harry to your room and I will have Dobby send up some treats for you.”
”Three and a quarter! Are you going to eat anything? Because we really ought to get going in about…” he glances over at the clock on the wall and takes a large gulp of coffee, hissing as it burns his tongue. ”Five minutes, so if you want to eat—”
Zabini continues contemplating his next move as though he hasn’t heard Harry speak at all, but Seamus head shoots up and gives Harry a questioning look.
And then he hears it… he hears it before he sees it… a low wheezing, like someone breathing… heart jumping into his throat, Harry wheels around in panic and stares unseeingly into the darkness… the noise draws closer and closer to him… it’s definitely someone — or something — moving quietly closer, its rattling breaths the only thing giving them away…
And then with obvious effort, he presses a shaking arm against the floor and hoists his shoulders a few inches off the ground and lifts his head to meet Harry’s gaze… Harry’s heart drops into his stomach, even as he hears another tinkle of cold laughter leave his mouth… His dad’s face stares up at him from the floor; it’s gaunt and stained with blood and despite the tension of pain around the eyes and mouth, he scowls in defiance.
He dusts himself off half-heartedly and approaches his daddy, but the man stays in the doorway and thrusts a small brush into Harry’s hands. Swallowing a sigh, Harry takes the brush and gives himself a more thorough dusting, until most of the soot is gone.
