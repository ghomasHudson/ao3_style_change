Harry's smile became gentle then. Sort of breath-taking. And Draco swore he knew what the other boy was going to say even before he said it.
Narcissa pulled back so she could look at him. “It's alright. Don't apologize, darling. I saw you with Mr. Potter earlier. So I knew that you were alive and unharmed.” She smoothed his hair back from his forehead and gave him a smile. “I'm so proud of you, my son.”
Potter removed his invisibility cloak, appearing just a few steps to Draco's right. He looked sheepish.
Draco hadn't even noticed that his boyfriend had entered the library. Once Harry spied him, he hesitantly came over and sat down in Luna's vacated chair.
“We’ve already established that the death eaters haven’t been able to enter Grimmauld Place so far.” Sirius reasoned. “They’ve camped outside, but that’s it. I doubt that’s going to change now. And even if it does, we won’t be there for long.”
He blushed once the words had left his mouth, remembering what he and Draco had done before Ron and Hermione had arrived. Judging by the blond's smirk and the colour in his cheeks, he'd noticed the double-meaning of Harry's words, too.
Harry wasn't happy about it, but he didn't protest either. For now there was nothing they could do. He knew that. With a sigh he slipped the locket around his neck.
“Have a little faith, will you? You’re Harry bloody Potter. I’m refusing to believe that your infamous luck has suddenly run out.”
Harry nodded and followed his godfather downstairs. While Sirius went left towards the kitchen, he padded down the corridor to the living room. Draco had stopped pacing and was now sitting in an armchair with a book in his lap. Harry stopped in the doorway and just watched him for a moment.
Ron was still recovering from getting splinched. He spent three days confined to his bed, which did nothing for his foul mood, even though they’d all agreed that he wouldn’t have to wear the locket until he was fully recovered. He actually had the nerve to argue against that, claiming they were leaving him out, which led to more than one shouting match between him and Draco and on one occasion even him and Harry.
Easier said than done. At first they tried using the invisibility cloak, but it wasn't big enough to cover all four of them, so Harry stuffed it back under his sweater. They ran down a staircase and found themselves in a corridor full off duellers. There were Death Eaters everywhere, fighting students and teachers alike.
“He did. It's in his trunk. He keeps using that one to cheat. That's the reason for his sudden brilliance at Potions.” the Gryffindor girl said accusingly, handing the book to Draco, who flicked through it and stared at the handwritten notes that littered every page.
Harry still felt a grin tugging at his lips when he climbed up the stairs to Gryffindor tower. True, that whole thing with Voldemort and his Horcruxes was still a big mess. But aside from that, his life had taken a definite upturn lately. He'd been allowed to leave the Dursleys for good and move in with Sirius, who was now officially his guardian. He had his weird, rag-tag group of friends, he could always rely on. And he and Draco were steadily growing closer.
Okay, this is it. The epilogue. I can't believe that I'm finally done with this series. Wow. A huge thanks for all the lovely and encouraging comments. They meant a lot to me.
“I don't want to hear them. And as long as they keep it to themselves, I don't really mind them knowing.” Harry mused.
He tensed when the curvy barmaid stopped in front of their table, giving him a critical once over. “Don’t worry, lad. I’m not out for revenge. It wouldn’t do to poison a paying customer.” she said. He couldn’t tell if she was joking or not. “I’m not saying I’m fine with what you did to me, but it was a war. Worse things happened. And as far as I’m concerned, your money is as good as anyone’s.”
He might have been able to talk his way out of it, if Lavender hadn't cornered Harry during breakfast and made him promise to go. And of course Harry argued that Draco couldn't leave him all alone with the girls. Faced with the Gryffindor's puppy eyes he had no choice but to agree to come as well. Neville and Hannah got bullied into tagging along, too. After all, they had all agreed on this trip during the train ride back from London.
The hall was packed with chattering, frightened students, some wearing travelling cloaks, others only dressing gowns. McGonagall was explaining the situation and coordinating the evacuation. Harry and Draco moved through the hall, still looking for Ron and Hermione. A lot of people turned to stare at Harry and there was a great deal of whispering.
“Of course we do.” the red-head agreed. “I don't get why it has to be Malfoy of all people, but if you're happy...”
“Mr. Potter! I am appalled. In all my years...” Draco ground out in a pretty perfect imitation of their headmistress, sending the others into another fit of laughter.
Suddenly there were loud noises from up ahead, bangs and yells and then running footsteps. The barrier exploded outwards without warning. Tonks was tossed back, but rolled and landed surprisingly graceful. Tiny professor Flitwick had no such luck. He crashed hard into the opposite wall.
“And you’d better use the floo. I don’t want you apparating in that weather.” his mother continued as if she hadn’t heard him.
Harry froze, staring at them in horror. They knew? But how could they know? Had Zabini let something slip after all? But Draco had been so sure he'd keep his mouth shut.
“Of course we're going to fight. As much as I enjoy kissing you, there are still times I'd rather punch you in the face.”
Draco wasn’t so sure, but he realized that there was nothing he could do to stop him. It was as he’d said. He’d chosen his path. “Be careful, professor.”
He held his breath as Voldemort dismissed Harry's words and finally raised the wand, casting the killing curse at the dark-haired boy. And Harry, of all the stupid things, responded with an Expelliarmus.
He had expected them to question or maybe even torture him, but so far they hadn't even looked at him. He'd only seen Wormtail once, when he'd brought Harry a pitcher of water and some stale bread. Aside from that his only company were the oppressing shadows. It was quiet down here. The only sound he heard was that of water dripping onto stone, somewhere to his right.
“He does.” Harry assured, feeling like a weight had been lifted off his shoulders, now that both his best friends knew and were okay with it. If only the problem with Slughorn's party would just as easily vanish, he mused when he spied Romilda Vane coming towards them with a box of chocolates.
In the evening he was carried back inside and locked into Malfoy's bedroom again. When the blond came back some time later, he fed Harry grilled chicken and combed his fur, complaining that the dog didn't look any less ruffled when he was done. Later he slipped into the bathroom for a while, reappearing in a pair of dark-blue pyjamas. He settled on his bed to read, while Harry curled into his side.
The werewolf seemed to sense this as well, because he didn't argue. Instead he flicked his eyes to the goblin meaningfully, before asking: “Did you at least get what we came for?”
Harry blushed, only now realizing what he’d said. He had just blurted it out without thinking, because it had seemed the obvious solution. But they had never showered together before. Of course they’d been sharing a bed for the past couple of months. And they snogged and fooled around a bit, but they hadn’t gone very far yet. Some frotting, a few hand-jobs, nothing more. They’d only seen each other fully naked a handful of times.
The red-head mumbled something under his breath and moved over to his own bed. Harry shook his head with a grin.
He forced himself to remain where he was, while he watched students filing out of the classroom, chattering among themselves as they headed towards the Great Hall for lunch break. A few of them gave him curious looks, but luckily most people in his year didn't take that whole Chosen One nonsense too seriously.
He quickly went over to intercept her before she could disappear towards the girls dormitories. "Hermione, wait."
Harry could readily guess what kind of questions they had been. Stuff about their love-life, probably. Or whether Draco needed any sex-tips. His godfather was embarrassing like that. He loved seeing people squirm and he really had no shame.
This time Harry managed to stifle his noise of surprise, although barely. Luckily the two Slytherins seemed too focused on their discussion to pay him much attention.
“Yeah, guess you're right.” Harry murmured. “She wasn't helpful at all, you know? Just gave me some calming draught and told me I need counselling sessions with her.”
Then Travers had reached them. “What are you doing here?” he wondered aloud. “I thought the inhabitants of Malfoy Manor were still confined to the house after Potter's escape.”
Fine, white scars criss-crossed over his chest and belly. Scars Harry had caused, with a spell he hadn't known the meaning of.
But he had no idea whether that was a good thing or a bad thing. Hermione gave him another smile and excused herself and Harry went back to his game with Ron.
Draco had spent some time chatting with his aunt Andromeda and her family, joined Ginny at the buffet for a snack and danced with Hermione. But the whole time his thoughts had been with Harry. His boyfriend had looked very put out when he’d suggested separating for a bit, so they wouldn’t arouse suspicion. He couldn’t help but wonder if another fight was brewing.
They stayed like that for long moments, clinging to each other, basking in the afterglow, while the water rinsed off the traces of their lovemaking. Harry sighed in disappointment when Draco finally pulled away and reached out to turn off the shower.
“I think we've got Remus to thank for that. He's really good at explaining things. And he encourages me to think about stuff, you know?”
He ran along the corridor blindly and only slowed to a stop once he reached the staircase. Taking a deep breath in an attempt to calm his racing heartbeat he pulled the Marauders Map from his pocket. He had started taking it with him all the time last week and now he was grateful for it.
“At the graveyard in Godric’s Hollow. It was on one of the really old headstones. I wondered about that, but I thought maybe Grindelwald had taken a liking to it and decided to use it.”
As it turned out, deciding to break into Gringott's and actually coming up with a plan to do so, were two completely different things. Harry and Draco spent the next couple of days making up plans, only to dismiss them again. The Gryffindor felt full of nervous energy and ready to just storm the bank and make it up as they went. But he knew that Draco was right and that they needed a solid plan first.
“Well, look on the bright side – in a couple of hours the whole thing is going to be over and you’ll be leaving for your honeymoon.”
They bypassed the church and headed straight for the graveyard, stopping just inside the kissing-gate. “I don’t know where… I’ve never been here before.” Sirius whispered apologetically.
The girl stared at him in shock. Her mouth opened and closed a few times, with no sound coming out. "Bastard!" she hissed finally, grabbing her purse and stalking off.
Draco looked around nervously, realizing where they were. Before he could say anything, Harry started pacing in front of the wall. As soon as the door appeared, he pulled the blond into the room, both looking around. The room of requirement had turned into a perfect copy of the Slytherin common room, just like Harry remembered it. He thought that Draco might feel more comfortable in the familiar surroundings.
He bent over the younger boy, fighting against the waves of pain he could feel through the bond. It took him a moment to realize that it wasn't only Harry's pain he was experiencing. His left arm felt like it was on fire. The dark mark hurt ten times worse than it had on the night he'd been branded by Voldemort. But even as his vision swam it wasn't his own pain he was concerned about. His last thought was: "Merlin, please let Harry be alright." before merciful blackness took him.
"You… Is that true? Please promise me you're not lying." He hated how small his voice sounded, when he had been aiming for demanding.
“Just a Death Eater.” a voice said behind them and Harry jumped in shock. He hadn't even noticed that Sirius was following them.
Draco was sitting on a stone facing the great lake, staring off into the distance. He had no idea how much time had passed since the end of the battle. He'd fled from the noise in the Great Hall. All those people celebrating their victory or mourning their dead. And Harry stuck in the middle of it all. The great hero.
“I don’t know. Neville said they were going to get something to destroy the horcrux. I have no idea what.”
“Gives light only to the beholder.” he whispered, wondering what the hell the other boy was doing with that thing. And then everything happened really fast.
Most of the other Slyhterins now treated Draco with a kind of cautious respect. He was still a prefect and their seeker, as well as one of Snape's favourites. The truth about Pansy's little accident was no secret either and no-one wanted to be on the receiving end of the blond's anger.
After a hurried lunch Harry and Ron went up to their dorm and Harry used the mirror to contact Sirius, hoping with all his might that everything had gone according to plan.
“I’ve accepted the fact that I get these … visions of him, you know? I mean, I still hate it. Of course I hate it. But I sort of … got used to it. It was just something that happened to me and even though I didn’t know why it happened, I could handle it. But now? Knowing that there’s a piece of him inside of me… It makes me feel sick. And … I can’t help but think… Back in fifth year, when I was always so angry… What if it was because of him? What if he’s … poisoning me from inside? What if I become like him?”
Harry sighed, massaging his throbbing temples, suddenly reminded why he spent half his time wanting to punch Malfoy. The blond looked at him and he tried to reign in his temper.
"That's okay. Since you came all the way here to congratulate me, it would be terribly rude of me to send you away, wouldn't it?"
"No, I'm not alright." Harry whispered, sinking deeper into the armchair. "It was a bonding spell. I'm bound to Malfoy."
“Exactly. Grindelwald killed many people. My grandfather for instance. This is his symbol. I recognized it at vunce.” Krum claimed. He looked about ready to jump up and attack Luna’s father.
“I'm going to kill Theo.” the Sltytherin muttered darkly some time later, after they had reached the top of yet another grassy hill, only to see even more grassy hills in the distance.
The thought of Hermione’s absence still stung, but it was getting better. “I’ve got you for that now, haven’t I?”
It was a good hiding place, located in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by nothing but empty fields, marshes and the occasional cluster of trees for miles and miles. The Order had placed strong wards all around the property and it was also protected by the Fidelius charm, with Mad-Eye as secret keeper. Harry suspected that Fern Cottag had actually been a really nice place once. But no-one had stayed here for over a decade, which meant that it was in almost as bad shape as Grimmauld Place had been. He still liked it better than Privet Drive.
“Don't look so smug. It's not like they're snogging in the common room or giving each other weird nick-names.”
Harry looked at him and strangely enough didn't see his childhood rival. He only saw a frightened boy, who had still had the courage to help him. A boy who had offered comfort and companionship when Harry had needed it most. The last few weeks had changed something between them. He wasn't sure what exactly they were now. He only knew that Malfoy was no longer his enemy. And that he trusted the blond, even if it was completely stupid.
“That was last night. We arrived on the outskirts of a tiny village. There was a house... It was destroyed and … his symbol was hovering in the sky above the roof.” Hermione continued. “We thought we had gone wrong or were too late, so... we went back. And then we tried again today and … we ended up here.”
“Yes. Shouting in joy, something like that. Harry thinks he finally accomplished whatever he's been trying to do in there. And now that Dumbledore isn't here... he was afraid that something might happen while they're gone.”
"I'm sorry if Malfoy being here makes you uncomfortable, Dobby. You can just avoid him next time, okay?" Harry suggested.
And in that moment Harry didn't care about Dumbledore, or Voldemort, or Horcruxes. The only thing that mattered was the blond boy in his arms and the love he could feel radiating off him. He had Draco and thanks to Snape they even had a future together. Everything else would work out fine. He was suddenly sure of it.
"Hmm.. I wouldn't give it too much thought. It's probably just your subconscious, trying to come to terms with the bond." Remus reasoned.
Harry was most definitely not feeling up to it. He actually felt close to a panic attack, truth be told. But if the last five years had taught him anything, it was to cope with unexpected things happening to him. He had learned that it was better to just go with it and get as much information as he could. So he nodded bravely, not trusting himself to speak. McGonagall disappeared for a moment, most likely to talk to someone, before pulling back the curtains.
Newly appointed Headmistress McGonagall had offered every student from Harry's year the chance to return to Hogwarts and take their NEWTs, since the war had prevented them all from completing their education. They would be called eighth years. Despite the now bad memories tied to his old school, Harry had immediately jumped at the chance to return to the one place where he'd always felt most at home. And he had thought that his two best friends felt the same.
Draco was surprised to find her glaring at the other three house tables as she said this. But maybe he shouldn't have been. He'd seen the dark looks directed at Slytherin.
The days following Dumbledore's death were strange. A lot of parents came to collect their children. Harry learned that the Patil twins had already been gone by the time McGonagall made her speech.  Seamus on the other hand refused to accompany his mother home.
Everything seemed to happen in slow motion. Voldemort raised his wand, but Harry was faster. He cast at the same time as Draco and the others. Later none of them would be able to say for certain which spells they had used. Whatever spells they were, they hit Voldemort at exactly the same moment. A sound like a cannon blast echoed through the silent hall. No sound left Voldemort’s lips, as he fell backwards, arms splayed wide. He hit the ground with a dull thud and moved no more.
Pansy looked up from her essay when her best friend sat down heavily next to her. She rolled her eyes at his whiny tone. He was such a drama queen. And so lucky to have her. Setting down her quill she focused her attention on him. "You're back early from your date."
“Harry’s busy calming Draco. He’s been fretting about NEWTs for the better part of two weeks now. Drives us all nuts.” he let her know.
When they reached the corridor he asked the blond to wait, while he paced in front of a blank wall. Draco's eyes widened in surprise when a door suddenly appeared out of nowhere.
While Luna had a nice chat with the witch, Harry and Draco looked around the shop. The Slytherin wasn’t the least bit surprised that Luna felt at home here. The walls were painted in different, bright colours and lined with shelves filled with anything from magical artefacts to Muggle trinkets. It was a bit overwhelming. In a corner they found a flowery headdress along with matching earrings and both agreed immediately that it would be the perfect gift for their Ravenclaw friend. So Draco distracted Luna, while Harry purchased the jewellery. Afterwards they asked her to pick some Christmas ornaments to hang over both their beds.
By the time they reached the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy and his dancing trolls, Ginny was seething and Blaise had gone strangely quiet, which proved how shaken he was.
Harry pulled out his wand, obviously ready to throw himself into battle and Draco reacted without thinking. He drew his own wand, gripped Harry’s hand and dragged him away from the fight. A death eater stepped into their path, but Harry shot a stunning spell at him and he went down. Draco blocked a jinx coming their way, took shelter behind a tree and pulled Harry against himself.
As soon as the door had shut behind her, Harry and Ron sat up again to continue their conversation, glancing over at McLaggen every now and then.
Only then did Draco realize that he actually felt ravenous. Harry’s stomach growled as if on cue. They both tucked into their sandwiches eagerly. Once the plates were cleared, Remus asked if they needed anything else.
Draco shivered when Potter suddenly reached out, trailing his fingers over the faded mark. No-one had ever dared to touch it before. People shied away from just looking at it. Even his own mother. But Potter seemed to have no such reservations. He was stroking the abused skin almost tenderly.
Harry thought about that for a moment. It made sense. He had tried to tramp down his anger, but there were just so many people and so many things that pissed him off. And he’d always had a temper. Yeah, preventing him from getting angry was impossible.
Hermione watched their bickering with wide eyes. This was a far cry from the fights she was used to witnessing between those two. They actually reminded her a bit of Ron and herself. Which was downright scary.
The answer to that was simple. In the room of  requirement, where he'd hidden Snape's old potions book. And with a sudden shock that nearly made him stumble, Harry remembered the ugly stone bust, on to whose head he had placed a wig and a battered, old tiara.
Malfoy made a big show of thinking and Harry felt the familiar urge to strangle him. How could this boy be so damn infuriating? He didn't like the wicked glint that suddenly appeared in the blond's eyes.
The teasing tone still surprised Draco. That Potter felt comfortable enough with him to tease and joke around, despite their history. It was a little overwhelming. And yet it was easy to return the friendly banter.
He knew that he couldn't go on like this forever. He hadn't chosen to come back from the brink of death for this. But he just felt so tired of it all. Everyone just expected him to move on with his life. To be okay again. Only he didn't know how. He didn't know how everyone else did it. It was only a little over a year since the war had ended and already people were going about their lives like nothing had happened.
Harry snorted and threw the new copy of the Daily Prophet into the trash bin. He'd told Kreacher a thousand times not to buy that stupid rag, but the old house elf never listened. He felt that Harry needed to keep up to date, which was just plain stupid. It wasn't like he actually cared what lies they printed about him any longer.
“You're looking like you expect someone to jump out from behind a tree any minute.” Harry pointed out.
It took a long time until she returned, but she was smiling when she sat back down. Draco contemplated telling her now. It was a good opportunity. They were alone in the house. Andromeda wouldn’t be back for at least another hour. They could talk freely.
And he looked nervous and hopeful and Draco couldn't quite believe this was really happening. But it was. His dreams were never this outrageous. Only a few days ago he'd scoffed at Pansy's idea of dating Potter. And now it looked like it could really happen. Still a little wary he allowed a small smile to creep onto his lips.
About a week before the end of term Draco received a rather frantic letter from his aunt. She told him that she’d invited Harry to stay with them over Christmas break – as he already knew. But she had only now realized that they didn’t have a spare room for him to sleep in. Her daughter’s old room had been turned into a nursery for Teddy and the two guest bedrooms were occupied by Draco and his mother.
“Don't let me stop you then.” the dark-haired boy murmured. Seconds later he found himself pressed back against the wall, while Draco proceeded to snog him senseless.
They returned home just in time for dinner, laden with shopping bags and wearing silly Santa hats and hungry again already, despite all the food they had consumed. Harry felt light and happy. As a child he'd never been allowed to visit the Christmas markets, so it had been just as much of a wonder for him as for the other two. He also couldn't remember the last time he'd laughed so much.
After ending the call Harry went down to the common room and played a game of wizards chess with Ron. He was in the middle of losing spectacularly (as always) when he saw Hermione enter through the portrait hole.
“She usually is. Which is very infuriating.” Draco pointed out. “So what exactly are you referring to?”
The Gryffindor finally seemed to realize where he was. His breathing eased somewhat and he nodded shakily. Then he slumped forward, resting his head on Draco's shoulder. The blond wrapped his arms around the younger boy automatically, stroking his back, murmuring nonsense assurances.
“No, we really haven't.” he argued. “If I remember correctly, Sirius' idea was: Get Tonks to pose as Bellatrix, disguise ourselves, go to Gringotts and we'll see from there. That's not a plan.”
Harry's face fell slightly. “I know. We'll find a way.” he promised. Reluctantly they both got up. Harry grabbed his shoulder and for a second they were so close. “Goodnight Draco.”
“Your great aunt Muriel doesn’t agree. I just met her upstairs. She said ‘Oh dear, is this the Muggle-born? Bad posture and skinny ankles.”
Harry shrugged. “Luna said I was in love with you. And when I realized that she was right, I just... it was overwhelming. I didn't know what to do. So I talked to Daphne and Lavender and they promised to help. And then Luna wanted to help, too. And Daphne must've told Pansy, because she sent me an owl and … I thought they probably know better how to do these things than me. I mean, I would've just blurted it out the next time I saw you, or something like that.”
Sirius pulled out his wand and stunned Umbridge. Yaxley jumped up in alarm, but he was too late and received a stunner as well. The Patronus vanished, which prompted the Dementors to attack.
Draco stared back. After a while he closed his eyes and shook his head, seemingly in defeat. But then he whispered: "No."
A gentle hand trailed over his back in a soothing gesture and he found himself arching into the touch, like a cat begging to be petted.
Harry jumped out of the way. The curse hit a bottle nearby, shattering it. Crabbe aimed again, but Draco was quicker and shot a stunning spell at him. Crabbe dove for cover at the last second and vanished behind a desk.
“Mistress Narcissa be telling Dobby to help. And to keep it secret, so the bad people don’t find out. Owls be too dangerous, she says.” the elf explained earnestly.
“I helped him. I guided him through the breathing exercises mother taught me when I started having panic attacks. And it worked. He slowly calmed down. Andromeda made him some tea and we … we talked. He told me about his problems with his powers and that he didn’t want to see a mind healer, so the Prophet wouldn’t catch wind of it. I suggested that he should talk to mother and he agreed.”
Kreacher was silent for a moment. Then he straightened up to look at Sirius with an air of defiance and simply said, “Yes.”
She smiled at him and he mused that she had actually turned out quite pretty, despite her size and build. If one was into girls that is.
“I can understand why she's your best friend.” he commented later, when they were just about to go to bed. “She's really fun to be around. I never would have guessed.”
“What a beautiful coincidence that I should run into you. Your father has been an even worse nuisance than usual lately. But I think losing his only daughter will put him in his place, wouldn't you agree? Not to mention that Potter will be devastated by your untimely demise.” Lucius mused cruelly.
Before she went to bed she sent a quick owl to Ron and Molly, letting them know that Harry was healthy and happy and that Malfoy seemed genuine in his affections. She fell asleep with a smile on her face, feeling lighter than she had in months.
"I just thought it might be a good idea to get to know each other better. You know, since there's a chance that this stupid bond is permanent! Forgive me for trying to be nice." Harry huffed.
And to Draco's utter mortification, he got comfortable on the bed and launched into an explanation: “Well, there are different kinds of lubrication spells. I'm sure you know at least one for wanking, right? Aside from that I can personally recommend ...”
Harry stopped to take a deep, steadying breath, before approaching the portrait of the fat lady and giving her the password. He knew that his two best friends would be furious with him for disappearing for half of the day without a word. True to form he was accosted by Hermione as soon as he'd set foot into the common room.
And while Aberforth was still sputtering and Draco wondered what the hell he meant with more people on the way, he had already climbed back into the tunnel. Sirius immediately followed suit, so they had no chance but to do the same. Draco marvelled at the stone steps, the brass lamps that hung from the walls and the smooth, earthy floor. It looked like this tunnel had been here a long time.
Then McGonagall entered the classroom and the younger boy forced himself to pay attention to her explanations. He jumped when Draco's knee bumped his under the table. As much as he hated to admit it, the contact felt comforting and he felt some of his tension slowly drain away. Draco seemed to feel it too, because he stopped fidgeting. They sat with their knees pressed together for the whole lesson.
The bell interrupted his train of thought. He had just enough time to call a house-elf and ask him to place the flowers into a vase and take them to his dorm, before he had to hurry to the Transfiguration classroom.
The portrait didn’t answer right away. He seemed to be weighing his options. Wondering how much to tell them. Maybe wondering if he would betray Snape by telling them. In the end his loyalty to the Black family won out.
The blond had never been so eager for the feast to end, but it seemed to drag on forever. He sighed in relief when the plates finally vanished and the students started to get up and head out. When everyone else had left, McGonagall stepped down from the platform and motioned for the eighth years to gather around her.
The day went pretty normal for Harry. At least what could be considered normal these days. When he went to the Great Hall for lunch with Ron and Neville (Hermione was still ensconced in the library), he even got a pleasant surprise. Katie Bell had returned from St. Mungo's. She couldn't remember anything about what had happened to her, but the healers had assured her that there would be no lasting damage.
“But... I don't want to lose you.” the blond whispered. And he didn't care if he sounded like a frighted child. They had only just really found each other. It wasn't fair.
"It all went perfectly." Sirius assured. "Kingsley arrested my dear cousin Bellatrix. After I've accidentally hit her with a stinging hex, that is. She's probably on her way back to Azkaban as we speak. After some consideration Moony and I took Narcissa to Grimmauld Place with us. She's reconciling with Andromeda right now. And Kingsley promised to send a team of Aurors round to Malfoy Manor. Maybe we're lucky and they can catch a few more death eaters."
“For now. But don’t worry, darling. We’ll make him realize that he’s head over heels for you. I’ve already got a few ideas.” Pansy let him know.
“I believe you. What Harry said is true. We don't know you like he does. But maybe … we can get to know each other.” Granger suggested. And though she looked like she didn't like the thought of spending time with Draco any more than he liked the thought of spending time with her and Weasley, he could also tell that she meant it.
“Harry should lie down. He needs rest.” she announced. “Draco, why don’t you take him home? I’ll be along shortly.”
“I’ve packed all the important stuff into my bag, in case we have to take off at a moment’s notice.” Hermione went on. “Did you clear things up with Sirius and Remus?”
After what felt like an eternity he reached the entrance hall, where the great oak front doors had been blasted open. There were smears of blood on the walls and even more terrified students cowering on the floor. Draco ran past them, out into the night, where he could hear more shouting. His heart was hammering in his chest and his breath was coming in short, painful gasps, but the fear for Harry drove him on.
Aside from Luna he probably hadn't come into contact with another human in over six month. Which suited him just fine. He liked staying at Grimmauld Place, walking through the house at odd hours or sleeping the whole day away on those rare occasions when he wasn't plagued by nightmares. Sometimes he only went to bed in the morning and then had breakfast instead of lunch. Kreacher did the shopping for him and sometimes kept him company. He had freed the old house elf shortly after the war, but Kreacher had chosen to stay and Harry was secretly glad for it.
Before he could say anything else however, their conversation was abruptly interrupted. Something large and silver came falling through the canopy over the dance floor. The lynx patronus landed lightly in the middle of the astonished dancers and opened his mouth, speaking in the loud, deep voice of Kingsley Shacklebolt.
Draco snorted. "You're mentally scarred? What about us? We have to endure you snogging Lavender all the time."
Unable to voice his thoughts, Harry did the only thing he could. He cuddled even closer and allowed Malfoy to bury his face in his soft fur. It didn't take long for the blond to doze off and Harry too, soon fell asleep, feeling more comfortable and safe than he had in ages.
Parkinson reached out again and Harry forced himself to hold still this time. Somehow it felt a lot less weird to be petted by Malfoy, even though she was surprisingly gentle.
There had been a large article in the Daily Prophet yesterday. The goblins claimed that the beast had broken its chains, while assuring the wizarding public that there was no need to worry about the safety of their money.
He remembered how fond the other boy had been of chocolate. Remembered the sweets he'd always gotten from his mother.
Draco flicked through a few more pages. “I think I know who this book belonged to. And you won't like it.”
His appetite suddenly gone he got up and left the great hall, nearly bowling over Draco and three Slytherin first years on his way out.
So what do you think? Did I copy too much from the book? I did, right? I'll try to do better in the next chapter.
But Harry wasn't listening. As soon as Draco had confirmed that he was unharmed, the Gryffindor took off running. Somehow he made it through the fray of fighters, but Draco was delayed by Alecto Carrow. He managed to shake her off with a well placed jelly-legs-jinx and saw his boyfriend disappearing around the corner. Without thinking, the blond sprinted after him.
Harry nodded reluctantly, suppressing the urge to pull Draco in for a goodnight kiss. They shared a long look, before parting ways and heading for their respective common rooms.
He looked at Harry as if daring him to argue. But the younger boy was actually glad for the support. It meant that Draco had forgiven him yet again, even though he probably didn’t deserve it.
Weasley looked so surprised that he had to stifle a laugh. Harry however was beaming at him, which made the whole thing worth it.
He was distantly aware of the many people surrounding him, of their sobs and murmuring voices. Someone tried to talk him, Hagrid possibly, but Harry wasn't listening. He felt frozen to the spot. Unable to move. Unable to take his eyes off Dumbledore's prone form.
"It's not. I'm merely good at observing the other houses. Not my fault you're less perceptive than I am." Alice claimed.
Sirius and Remus had indeed gotten married very secretly a little over a year ago. They hadn’t told anyone what they were planning. They’d just went to the Ministry and gotten the whole thing over in less than half an hour. Remembering the gruesome months of wedding preparations and the many arguments Draco and him had had with Mrs. Weasley and Draco’s mum, Harry envied the two men more than a bit. But unfortunately eloping hadn’t been an option for them.
"I can't even imagine how you're feeling today. And I won't pretend that I can. But sitting here all day isn't going to make it better."
It was a crazy plan, with a lot of dangerous variables and great risks. It could very well get them killed. But it was still the best and only plan they had.
“But just when we started talking about going to look for you, we ran into Pansy Parkinson, who told us that she'd overheard you telling Luna you would eat down in the kitchens.” Hermione added.
To Harry’s surprise the Bulgarian remembered Draco from fourth year. It turned out that they’d had a few conversations, mostly during mealtimes. Harry was once again introduced as cousin Barny and felt very out of place. He didn't want to give his true identity away, so he mostly kept his mouth shut, while his boyfriend made polite small-talk. Suddenly Krum tensed, staring at a spot somewhere behind Draco.
It was over all too soon. Harry's back arched as his orgasm ripped through him, leaving him weak in the knees. Draco rocked his hips against him a few more times, before he tensed and shuddered in the younger boy's arms, muffling a low moan against the side of Harry's neck. The Gryffindor wondered distantly if he'd have a hickey tomorrow, but couldn't really bring himself to care right now.
“She said that there had been weird rumours about Dumbledore when he was younger. And she talked about his sister. Muriel claims she was a squib and that Dumbledore’s family locked her up because they were ashamed of her. No-one ever saw her. Until she died, a lot of people didn’t even know she existed.”
“That's not true. I trust you. Hermione and Ron too. And the others will come along. And even if they don't... It's their loss.” the dark-haired boy insisted.
He didn't add that McGonagall had little hope of breaking the bond, even if she discovered the spell. His friends were shocked speechless already and he didn't want to be reminded of the facts himself.
Draco’s bed creaked ominously. The glass on his bedside table splintered. He reached out and grabbed the Gryffindor’s hand.
Lessons were growing steadily more difficult. Non-verbal spells were now not only expected in DADA but also in Charms and Transfiguration. Free periods were mostly used to catch up on homework and studying. Harry was surprisingly good at Potions this year, which made the blond a little suspicious. He meant to ask him about it, but always forgot to do so when they actually had a moment alone together. With lessons, homework and Quidditch Draco felt like they had no free time at all.
Harry grinned and tried not to analyse the giddy feeling those words brought too closely. So what if she wasn't Draco's girlfriend? Didn't have to mean anything, right? He shouldn't even want it to mean anything. It was all Sirius fault, for making him realize that he actually did have a crush on the blond. Or it was probably the bond. Yes, that was it. Just the bond.
Draco winced once he got a good look at their friend. He had various nasty cuts and scratches all over his face. “Neville, what happened to you?”
After lunch Harry was in high spirits, feeling like things were finally looking up again. Not even the fact that they had 2 hours of DADA with Snape now could dampen his good mood. About 20 minutes into the lesson however, he started feeling uneasy. At first he reasoned that it couldn't be the bond. True, he hadn't seen Draco at lunch, which was nothing unusual, but he had sat next to the blond for 2 hours of Transfiguration in the morning. That should have been enough to satisfy the bond for another couple of hours.
“Welcome to the room of requirement.” Harry announced, opening the door and ushering him inside. They entered the room and stopped dead in their tracks.
“He broke with his father. Turned against you-know-who. ” Hermione chimed in. “That's the reason he got disinherited. He spent the summer with Harry and his godfather. And Ron's right. He really is a nice guy, once you get to know him. All that rich pureblood posing is just an act. Something he did to please his father.” she said with a shrug.
Draco thought back to his talk with the blonde girl. “Yeah, pretty much.” he muttered with a wry smile.
“Fine. But you’re not using magic unless you absolutely have to. You’re sticking close to Draco and if it gets dangerous he’s going to apparate both of you back here immediately. Understood?”
That smile was quickly wiped off his face once he stepped onto the pitch. The weather had gotten even worse. The steady downpour of cold water had him drenched within minutes and the wind had picked up as well, making it hard to keep his broom steady. Millicent didn't seem to care. She flew around the pitch with a bright grin, whacking bludgers left and right. Draco decided to stay well away from her.
Neville opened the door again. Harry and Luna slipped out first, quickly followed by Draco, Blaise and Ginny. They found themselves in a long tunnel. What felt like hundreds of steps led steadily downward, finally ending in front of yet another door. They stepped out into a deserted corridor and Draco activated the map, looking for their dots to find out where exactly they'd come out.
Beside Luna, McGonagall was obviously regretting that choice as well, if the looks she was giving the girl were any indication.
“Not about us. We both agreed that it was too soon to tell them. And Lavender isn’t… she likes girls and boys.” Daphne explained. “But they know that and they’re okay with it. She has an older brother to keep the line going and they were always a lot less strict. Plus they’re happy she even survived Greyback’s attack. I think they’d forgive her a lot of things.”
With the room of requirement constantly blocked by Nott, it was nearly impossible to get more than a few minutes alone. They managed a few stolen kisses in hidden niches and alcoves or the odd, deserted classroom, but the risk of discovery always made them pull apart quickly.
His mother was waiting for the group when they reached the hall. Draco saw all the colour drain from her face when she looked at him.
“Whenever Dumbledore leaves, a few members of the Order patrol the hallways at night. Just to be safe.” Remus answered.
The blond knew that it was just a diversionary tactic to stop him from prodding further. A tactic worthy of a Slytherin, he thought wryly. But time alone was still a rare thing and he never got enough of Harry's kisses, so he let him get away with it.
Andromeda, looking splendid in dark blue. Next to her sat Tonks, with her husband Eoghan and their three-months-old son Teddy. Remus, sitting in the front row and looking clearly uncomfortable in the new dress robes Narcissa had forced on him. Of course Neville and Millicent were there as well. And also Dean, Seamus, Terry Boot, Susan Bones, the Patil twins and pretty much everyone else from their year. Even Goyle had shown up. He was sitting next to Luna’s father with a look of utter bewilderment of his face, while a wildly gesturing Xenophilius explained something to him.
"What do you…?" she started off again, only to stop when Ron grabbed her hand an pulled her down into a chair next to Harry.
The Ravenclaws started discussing this, but Harry heard none of it. His scar burned again and he saw that Voldemort was on the move. Though he didn't know where he was headed.
Casting a nervous glance at Draco, who slept on, completely oblivious, Harry grabbed his wand off the bedside table. Then he crept to the door and slipped out into the hallway. The house was silent as he slowly made his way down the stairs, careful not to make too much noise. He stopped for a second once he reached the bottom of the stairs. He could hear the low murmur of voices from the direction of Sirius’ and Remus’ bedroom, indicating that the two men were awake. Harry considered knocking on their door and telling them what he’d seen in the garden, but dismissed the idea almost immediately. If it was indeed just some old garden tool he didn’t want to disturb them.
But he still couldn't quite keep the scowl off his face when the girl smiled at him smugly. Draco whispered something to her, before turning to Crabbe and Goyle, who had obviously started following him around again. The two boys nodded and followed Pansy, while Draco strolled over to where Harry was standing.
The carriage sped through the winding tunnels at alarming speed, taking hairpin turns, spiralling ever downward. For once the knot in Remus' stomach was not due to the wild ride. Finally they screeched to a halt in front of a small tunnel, dimly lit by flickering torches.
“I can't bear the idea that we might never come back.” Hermione's voice shook him out of his musings. As if she'd read his mind.
His feet gave out and Harry dropped down to the floor in the middle of the chaos his wayward magic had created, shaking like a leaf and panting like he'd just run a marathon. For a long moment he just sat there, unable to move.
He was sure that he'd never felt this hopeless in his life. Not even when he'd been hunting Horcruxes with Ron and Hermione. There was no way he'd manage to change back into himself as tired and scared as he was. And it was unlikely that anyone would notice his absence. Unlike him, his friends were busy with work.
“That’s what Krum said. He seemed pretty sure. He said he’d seen it carved into a wall at Durmstrang.”
It was already late when they finally made their way back to Hogwarts, laden with packages and in high spirits, despite the cold wind and now steadily falling snow. Luna followed them back to their room to instruct them on how to place the Christmas ornaments to prevent Wrackspurts from pestering them. Just as she was leaving, Longbottom showed up, admiring their work with a grin.
They parted ways inside the great hall, heading for their respective house tables. A few people still stared at them, but most of the other students had finally gotten used to seeing them together. Even the glares directed at Draco had lessened. Just like the open hostility towards Slytherin. Although Harry was pretty sure that most people just weren’t openly hostile any more, but secretly still called the Slytherins Death Eaters and other evil names. McGonagall was very strict about her idea of inter house unity and there had been a startling lot of detentions during the first couple of weeks, when people had felt justified to attack anyone wearing the green and silver of Slytherin.
Draco however didn't really pay attention to them. He was completely focused on Harry, who was quickly losing his temper, since McLaggen was too busy criticising the other team members to pay proper attention to his goal hoops. Gryffindor was still in the lead, but only by thirty points, thanks to that idiot. Hermione, Millicent and Neville were complaining loudly beside him. Blaise was busy flirting with Parvati.
The blond looked surprised and thanked her for the compliment, while Harry and Ron chuckled and Hermione frowned.
“It’s… hard to explain.” Draco said with a sigh. “Remember those Magical Theory lessons we had in first year?”
“It's from Lavender.” Ron answered the first question, sounding revolted. “She can't honestly think I'd wear that!”
Trying to learn occlumency was just as hard as Harry remembered it to be, even if Draco was a better teacher than Snape. At least it took him longer to snap at Harry and he never commented on the things he saw in the younger boy's mind, before Harry finally managed to shut him out. He actually showed surprising patience, explaining things again and again. It wasn't his fault that the dark-haired boy still struggled with it.
“Family safe. Do not try to make contact. We’re being watched.” the patronus reported in Mr. Weasley’s voice.
Draco made no move to pull away. He simply watched Harry, as he inspected the symbol. When he realized what the younger boy was up to, it was already too late. With a quick movement Harry pushed his sleeve up to the elbow. Draco froze and tried to ready himself for the inevitable exclamation of disgust.
“And that's how we robbed Gringotts.” Sirius ended his tale, grinning at the two boys, who had listened with rapt attention.
But she shook him off. Her temper flared just like Harry’s. All of their nerves were frayed after their venture through the dark and dusty old manor.
Thanks for all the positive feedback. And sorry that the new chapter is rather short. I hope the next update will be longer.
“It wasn’t so bad at first.” he said softly. “I mean, the atmosphere was a bit strange, but not horribly so. Molly wasn’t mad at me for not answering her letter. Not that I really expected her to be. And Ron and Hermione … seeing them again felt good. I’ve missed them.” he looked at the blond apologetically, but Draco just motioned for him to continue.
The next couple of days were a blur for Harry. He mostly functioned on autopilot, while his mind was miles away, walking the same dark path over and over again. Draco was at his side constantly, making sure he ate and slept and doing his best to get Harry out of his own head. He kept up a stream of idle chatter or reminded Harry to stay positive or just sat with him quietly. His worry should have been stifling, but instead Harry was eternally grateful for his presence.
The dark-haired boy hesitated. Could he really trust Malfoy? The boy who had tortured and taunted him for six years? Who'd done everything he could to get Harry into trouble? But Malfoy had also saved him tonight. He had risked his own life by saving him. By standing up to Bellatrix and the others. And Harry remembered the scene on top of the Astronomy tower. When Draco had had the chance to kill Dumbledore. Instead of using it, he had lowered his wand.
But in the end even they had been roped into playing truth or dare with the rest of their peers. And it was okay. Fun even. People took silly dares and asked stupid, awkward questions. And even if he had no desire to talk about his (non-existent) sex-life or flash his naked bum to the others, Harry had slowly started relaxing.
“I did stick to the basics. I didn't even mention rimming.” The animagus sounded like a petulant child.
“Two years ago, when we were cleaning out the drawing room, we found a big gold locket. And we threw it out. Did you steal it back?”
“No, Draco. Your father and I, we have brought this onto ourselves. When the Aurors come for me, I shall go with them willingly and subject myself to the Wizengamot's judgement.”
“You can always tell her you want to spend more time with Teddy. Be a decent godfather and all that.”
Harry awoke slowly. His back was killing him and his mind felt fuzzy. It took him a moment to remember what had happened. When he did, he opened his eyes with a groan.
Harry was tempted to agree. Having a drink actually sounded nice. But he knew that it would only draw out the inevitable. He was wound up. Buzzing with nervous energy. Had been all day. He just wanted to get it over with now.
His words did seem to mollify Krum somewhat and he excused himself a short while later, heading off to talk to some of Fleur’s veela relatives.
Ginny started wringing her hands nervously. “I'm in love with Harry since I was eleven.” she confessed. “I know it's stupid, but I just.. I kept hoping that when I got older he would finally notice me and … start loving me back.”
He was running away from Dudley and his gang, his breathing coming in short, painful gasps. But he knew that if he slowed down they would catch him and beat him up.
"I'm sure it didn't do it on purpose. And could you please stop screeching like an angry hippogryff? You're causing a scene. And giving me a headache."
"Sex, Mr. Potter." Professor McGonagall replied bluntly and Harry felt his face heat. He didn't dare look at Draco.
She spied Neville at the Hufflepuff table with Hannah Abbot. Blaise Zabini and Terry Boot were sitting with the Gryffindors. Lavender had joined the Slytherins as well. And it wasn’t only the eighth years. The younger students did it too.
Talking about his ex-girlfriend was a bit strange for him. Seeing her with Justin, too. He wasn’t jealous. Not at all. He definitely didn’t want her back. But the fact that she’d gotten over the break-up so quickly still stung a bit.
“I was selling in Diagon Alley an’ she come up to me an’ asks if I’ve got a licence for trading. Bleedin’ snoop. She was gonna fine me, but she took a fancy to the locket an’ told me she’d take it and let me off that time.”
They reached Hogwarts in no time and got off the train amongst a lot of whispers and curious stares. Draco shuddered when his eyes landed on the Thestrals pulling the carriages.
Sirius turned to him with a sad little smile. “It’s been years, but I still recognize the handwriting. RAB – Regulus Arcturus Black. My brother wrote that.”
Harry shrugged. "I'm not really sure. It just felt right. I mean, after the ritual and everything ... I just had a feeling that you should be the one to destroy the piece of him that's been in me."
The animagus grinned. "Anytime, Prongslet. I've got to go now, but maybe you could call again later today? Preferably with your boyfriend, if possible. Narcissa wants to talk to him and she's insufferable when she doesn't get her way."
Another long silence followed his words. Harry could see that Ron and Hermione didn’t want to believe it. But it made sense. It made so much sense. Dumbledore had controlled his life from the second of his parents’ death. He had insisted that Harry had to go back to the Dursleys every summer. He had expected Harry to sacrifice himself. And turning Harry into a blind follower had been easier without Sirius’ rebel influence. He had thought it wouldn’t be possible for him to hate Dumbledore more than he already did. He’d been wrong.
"The Weasleys have left again. But Mrs. Weasley stopped by to tell us that Ron regained consciousness for a bit. We can visit him tomorrow." Hermione let them know.
Once the other players were out of sight, he quickly slipped through the door. The room was humid and full of steam from the showers. Harry looked around until he spied his boyfriend. Draco was just lacing his shoes and hadn't put on his shirt yet. The dark-haired boy found himself staring at his pale back. Despite the fact that they had shared a bed every night during Christmas holidays and even fooled around a bit, he'd only seen his boyfriend shirtless a few times.
“You were screaming and shaking all over. And Remus couldn’t find any injuries, aside from a small wound at your arm, where the snake’s fangs must have grazed you. He healed it, but… you weren’t getting better. He thought… he thought it was your scar. … And he was right, wasn’t he? Harry?”
“About whatever stupid idea is going on in that head of yours. This is a secret mission, remember? Keep it low key.”
“Well, we’d better get going now.” he decided, before turning to Aberforth. “Abe, there are a couple more people on the way. They’ll be apparating straight into the pub. Just send them down the passage when they get here, will you? Thanks a lot.”
Draco wasn't sure whether or not he should feel offended. But when he glanced over and caught the other boy's grin, he realized that Potter was only teasing. The fact that the Gryffindor felt comfortable enough to tease him made him feel warm inside. So he just snorted and muttered: “Guess it does.”
Hours later everyone was gathered in the great hall. The injured had been moved to St. Mungos. The dead had been placed in different rooms. People were crowded around the house tables, eating and talking, some of them laughing, others mourning. Fred and George were amusing the people at their table with jokes. Sirius was laughing loudly about something Diggle had said, while Remus next to him only smiled. A bit further down Narcissa Malfoy and Molly Weasley were comforting Andromeda, who‘s husband had died in the fight.
Harry suddenly felt too excited to sit around, so he did his best to get some cleaning done, wanting the house to look… well, at least not as shabby as it usually did. He spent the whole day getting at least the kitchen and living room somewhat presentable and started on the library the next day. There was no answering letter and Harry got more and more nervous with every passing hour.
Sirius had obviously noticed this as well. “I take it that’s not the whole story. What are you hiding?”
