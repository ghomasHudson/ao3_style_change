“I...think maybe yes.” Harry sighs and groans angrily, throwing his head back against the plush squeaky pleather of the booth. “It's complicated but he haunts 97 percent of my every waking thought so that's certainly clued me in.”
“So what's the goal today?” Harry asks nodding.
"Would you like to meet Lily?" Harry asks seemingly out of nowhere.
“Yeah the health of the magic core.” Malfoy continues. “Every magical building has a core that the magic stems from and Grimmaulds' seems very strong albeit frayed and maybe...tired? It's sort of hard to describe since it's just feelings. This house has obviously been very empty for a long time and isn't anywhere close to its full potential so all the magic that was once spread out is now condensed? Almost? Basically our ultimate goal is going to be to spread the magic back out. Rooms that have existed here don't anymore, so we need to work on getting the house opened back up.”
Harry gets the vibe that Malfoy is taking his sweet time when 9:30 rolls around with no sign of the other man. He makes some fresh squeezed orange juice then a pot of hot coffee, just to give himself something to do while he waits. He supposes Malfoys a coffee guy when he finally comes into the kitchen, sniffing at the scent of the fresh dark roast.
“I...kind of… well so… I'm..not straight?” Harry says, cursing himself as it comes out posed as a question. “I mean. I slept with Malfoy.”
“Both.” Harry replies between soft watery sobs. “I think I want him.”
“Okay, well...it's nice to have a place to start.” Harrys says rubbing his hands together.
“Alrighty. Have you got the timeline figured out yet? Or the costs?” Harry asks.
“On your own? There's some very old magic there, Harry. It might be best to find someone with some experience with stuff like that.” Hermione replies
“After you kicked me out I got really sick, and my mother made a comment that freaked me out. She said she looked the same when she was pregnant with me. Pale and clammy and she couldn't eat without potions and she was sick. I...cast a spell to see...just cause….I was scared. Imagine my surprise when it lit up green. I kept it secret until I couldn't anymore and mother kicked me out...that was ...god I was 7 months before it showed. I didn't have any money, a home, anything. I couldn't...I couldn't bring myself to tell you. I was so scared and ashamed and and...you were with Ginny. I didn't want to….I didn't want to make you mad again. So when she came I...I gave her to you. I couldn't...I can't taint her. I can't give her a home like you can.” Draco explains through soft watery sobs.
Malfoy pauses for a minute then opens his eyes then raises his hand, “I can help. We can discuss payment once I’ve walked through and assessed the house.”
"Im sorry, Harry. I just...I was scared and a coward and...and you hated me. How could have expected me to react. I didn't know it was a possibility until after it was too late." Malfoy leans his head back over the top of the chair. "The fertility line...me being a blood heir...it was a recipe for disaster."
“Malfoy, meet Lily.” Harry says, handing Lily a rattling toy. “Lily, meet Malfoy.”
“Harry!” Molly gasps harshly.
Harry wishes that that hadn't been exactly what he’d hoped to hear. He nods softly.
“Yeah, I can pay of course.” He says, taking in Malfoys…..homely state. Malfoy seems to think it over for a minute before nodding slowly.
“ Harry, Lily is mine.” Draco says after a long moment of strained silence. Harry mulls the sentence over and tries to make it make sense.
“Good luck, Harry.” Molly says as he walks back to the floo. “ If you have any problems or need help, you know where I am!”
"GINNY!" Harry shoots up from the ground. "DID YOU SERIOUSLY ADOPT A BABY AFTER WE HAD AN ARGUMENT ABOUT NOT BEING READY!"
“Of course, this is my mother's ancestral home, after all.” Malfoy nods
"Anyone?" Malfoy says.
He waves awkwardly before hiking the bag up onto his shoulder. He holds Lily close to his chest, supporting her head as she looks up at him quietly. He smiles at her then floos back to Grimmauld.
“I've set up a little something in the guest room near our room. I'll help as best I can when she wakes up. I love you Harry, sleep well okay?” She says, heading up the stairs with Harry in tow. She nods to his room and continues to her own. As he sets Lily in the transfigured crib the weight of what this means for him settles onto his shoulders. Yet the smile on his lips doesn't fade, even after he finally falls asleep.
“ I think you’d better sit for this.” He says, pulling at his fringe. They nod and sit on the long couch in the den.
"Why didn't you tell me, I could have helped!" Harry feels confusion and anger bubble up over the bone deep awe. Lily is actually his daughter. He has a daughter. A real blood relative. Lily was as much his daughter before as she is now...but, a blood relative. With Malfoy.
“Right, you don’t know Latin,” he muttered under his breath.
He squinted at the narrow handwriting, barely legible under the dim moonlight, and by the time he finished reading, the owl was nowhere to be seen.
Harry choked. “Your
“Oi! Give me a warning, will you?” Harry leapt out of his seat to maintain close proximity to Draco. “Wait up!” He hurried after Draco to the common room entrance. “Great, now look what you’ve done,” Harry grumbled under his breath when they were in the hall.
into my ear until I was wide awake.”
A week later, Malfoy confronted me again, in the secret passage by out Ancient Magic class. I'd never seen anyone else use it, and I was so distracted, I nearly ran into him. He had to quickly step to the side to avoid me, standing on his toes to keep his balance.
“This is fucking weird with you hiding your eyes like that.” Potter said from over his shoulder. “You’re making this

Draco hissed, stabbing his finger into Harry’s chest with each word. “The

"Are you— are you okay?"
He didn't have to ask twice. Harry immediately slung the cloak over his shoulder and rushed to Draco's side to oblige him. It was the perfect set up, really—it was like Draco was

. It was already late in the evening, so it wasn’t long before Draco’s eyes began to droop.
Harry frowned. “No,” he said. “I was on the ground, and a split second later, I was on the roof. I didn’t even blink.”
“Don’t mention it,” Harry replied as he opened the window for Hedwig. Draco didn’t know why he even bothered with the window if he was opening and closing it every five minutes. Harry untied the message from Hedwig’s leg and set her in her cage, leaving the door open. “She’s all yours.”
Draco was giving him puppy dog eyes as he held out his arms, wiggling his fingers. "One more hug?"
Draco was tapping his fingers on the pages of his textbook. “You’re going to have to explain what happened,” he reached for Harry’s hand and gave it a squeeze. “I still don’t understand the situation all that well.”
“About—about Cedric?”
"Hey, I

You know what that means?"
It landed on Parvati, who chose truth, and Draco scrambled for an easy question to ask. “Who do you fancy?”
“Right, like you didn’t think that because you were already studying his
The feeling was already crawling up my chest, settling in my throat and leaving me breathless. I slid down the wall and sat on the smooth stone floor, trying to even out my breathing.

panicking, but it was different, somehow. There was no dread in the pit of my stomach, no dizziness, no sensation of falling. It was something softer—like butterflies, or nervousness.
Draco confessed, exhaling in relief.
"No you don't." Ron scoffed. "You always forget that Hermione has ancient runes during our Wednesday free period!"
you.”
“For the record, Draco,” Blaise spoke up. "You were way more interested in Potter than you were in the whole Chamber of Secrets fiasco.”
Harry’s mouth went dry as he watched Draco cross his arms, smirking. “Sorry, I—”
"Does it—" He looked confused for a moment, but then his eyes widened slightly. "Oh," the corners of his mouth tugged upwards into a smile, "I suppose it does," he answered.
“Erm, maybe? Yes?
Harry left for the stands, not waiting for Draco's reaction. He resisted the urge to turn back and look, but if he had, he would've seen Draco gripping the entryway in an effort to stay upright.
"I don't think Draco is to blame, to be honest," Harry commented. "In hindsight, I wasn't that obvious about it."

"You're always doing so much for me," he answered, "you get me flowers and help me through my panic attacks and always make sure I’m warm at night, and even now you're trying so hard to make me better—and what do I do for you in return? Nothing!"

"Well, I was thinking that your family tree must be easy for you," he drawled, "after all, you're the only one on it."
“Now go on,” she waved at him. “Don’t keep my son waiting.”
Draco reached for his hand, cradling it in his palms.
“You already

Draco swallowed, breath hitching in his throat when Harry lifted a hand to cup his cheek. “Fuck you,” he said quietly, but his voice lacked venom.

Draco watched him curiously. “There’s more to this than you’re letting on, isn’t there?”
“And the time Ron was unconscious,” she added. “Wait a minute,” she said, leaning towards Harry and frowning.

Pansy nodded solemnly. "It was a bitch to get used to," she agreed.

It eventually got to the point where Draco had to restrain himself when he came back to Harry's flat after work to see Harry sitting at the wheel, concentrating on his work. Draco
“Oi, get a room!” Seamus cupped his hands around his mouth so his voice would carry.
Despite the long hours that Harry worked the next few days, he had a spring in his step for the rest of the week. He’d woken up the next morning with Draco’s arms wrapped tightly around him—Draco must’ve carried him to their bed at some point—and an inkling of an idea started growing in his mind.
"Honestly, what would you do without me?"
Harry squawked indignantly, "what are you trying to say?"
“But they’re in French,” he furrowed his brow. “Why don’t you recognize them?”
“Hey,” Harry protested, “there was the time my arm bones were missing. And the time

Draco hesitated. “Potter, if your body so much as
“Right,” Harry scratched the back of his neck, hoping she couldn’t see how red he was in the wandlight.
“So that’s why—” Harry blurted out as another thought wandered to the forefront of his mind. “So that’s why you were so weird about me showering!” He said triumphantly.
Draco’s mouth went dry as Harry’s hands rested on his hips to pull him close. “Shut up and kiss me, Potter.”
Harry stared into the dying flames of the fireplace for a moment. “Because of what—what happened,” he waved his hand in the air, hoping Draco would understand.
He laughed. “You literally

"It's from both of us," Sirius winked, "saved the best for last."

Draco opened his mouth, intending to speak, but a lump in his throat prevented any sound from coming out.
Draco rolled his eyes, “but
I managed to avoid Malfoy for the next few weeks. I sat close to the door in every class, used my invisibility cloak as much as possible, and kept the map on me at all times. Luckily, I'd only a few close calls.

Harry started, his mind instantly going to the brief period of time when he’d been unable to keep the thought of Draco Malfoy out of his head. Well,

A sudden commotion filled the hallway with noise as all of the eighth years exited the Room of Requirement, ready to head back to their common room. Draco normally would have pulled way, but he was far too drunk and horny to be embarrassed—plus, Harry was latched onto his throat in a way that made him never want it to end.
“You do?” Harry looked surprised. “I
“Right,” Harry swallowed, “yeah. I’ll do that from now on.”
"Ugh," Harry pulled away, wrinkling his nose. "You taste like blood."
Draco smirked, leaning over to whisper in Harry's ear. "I'll be sure to keep that in mind," he breathed. Their friends snickered when Harry made a strangled sound and turned bright red.
Harry strained his ears to listen for her retreating footsteps before breathing a sigh of relief. "I missed you," he whispered to Draco, and frowned when Draco didn't respond. "Aren't you going to say you missed me too?"
Remus scoffed. “Oh

She hesitated. "Are you sure?"
Harry blinked at Pansy and hesitated, feeling very much like he’d just been asked whether he’d like to die via hanging or a gunshot wound to the head. Choosing
he leaned forward, finger raised in the air. “They were saying the Heir of Slytherin was at Hogwarts! People were being petrified! Why wouldn’t I be talking about it?” He turned to look at Potter. “Who even was the Heir of Slytherin, anyway?”
"Who says it's ruined?" Draco asked. "We're eating dinner and spending time together. That sounds like the perfect date to me."
“Okay,

Harry spluttered. "Er, we haven't exactly clarified th—"

Honestly, it seemed a little unlikely that Malfoy just

“So you are?”
After marveling about it to all of the party guests, she had turned to Draco— “Did you know he was this talented?”
Hermione sighed. “According to St. Mungos… it’s pretty much like the common flu. Coughing, sneezing, fever, breathing problems… but it doesn’t respond to magic at all. In fact, it
"Yeah, of course," Harry grabbed Draco's hand as they walked; it was sweaty, but he didn't care.
Harry squeezed his eyes shut, fighting off the Truth Serum as best as he could, but it forced the words up his throat like a hiccup. “Yes,” he said finally, feeling his cheeks redden.
"Whoa," Malfoy held his hands up in defense, "Chill the fuck out, Potter, it's not that big of a deal. Wizards don't give a shit who you want to shag—"
He should ask Malfoy out.
?” Harry paused. “Look, I’m sorry, I know you hate me and I know that you being gay doesn’t mean you like every guy you meet, I just—” he found himself unable to breathe when Draco took another step towards him, and Harry backed up a step, his back hitting the bedpost.

At the sound of his shout, Potter hurried out of the bathroom. “Draco! Are you okay?”
“Turns out, the professors keep

“Ten days,” Draco replied, his eyes focused on his Patronus, “see? I told you I could do it.”
“Do people actually—actually spike your… your drink with—” Draco closed his eyes tightly and huffed.
Harry watches Malfoy as he smiles down at her, his eyes glossy.
“Are there any veggies or fruits you don't like? Speak now or forever hold your peace.” Harry asks.
“Excellent. I wanted to get explicit permission before we began. I have to go through every room and all belongings to detect any hexes, curses, and potentially frayed spellwork. That means going through Sirius’ stuff. Obviously I'll be gentle and mindful for everything but I wanted you to know that.”
“It was left on our doorstep with this note.” Harry hands the note to Arthur who reads it as Molly studies the baby. “Horrible timing seeing as Ginny and I broke up right after we found it.”
“Oh...you already had breakfast, then?” Malfoy asks, sounding upset.
He casts the charms Molly taught him that will let him know if Lily needs him, then sets off to the kitchen.
“You made breakfast.” Malfoys says, pulling out a chair and sitting.
"I suppose we ought to finish the home up." Draco smiles across the table.
"Ginny, you can't mean that." Harry looks at her, and sees the seriousness in her eyes, the sadness.
"If you must know, Potter. I'm just upset because I lost the chance to have a family of my own. Now let's finish up this room and be done for the day. I'm exhausted." Malfoy spins in place and makes to begin plucking at the red strings behind him again.
Harry smiles gently at them and wonders if this might be the moment. He nods gently to let them know he's going to respond but hesitates a moment around his words. Should he just get it over with and tell them? Or should he give them the information piece by piece so as to not overwhelm them. Or should he shove these feelings deep into the pits of his heart and pretend they were never even here. He briefly remembers Ginny and decides it might be worth telling them, if it means he can find someone to be actually happy with. He hates that Malfoy flashes through his thoughts again.
"Thats...that isn't true. Anyone would be lucky to have you." Harry rubs at the fraying fabric of his old t-shirt.
Malfoy waves him off, blowing over the top of the mug to cool down the coffee inside.
“While you know you're welcome to stay here, do you have a plan?” Molly asks gently.
"So you won't be a part of her life? Even now when I know?" Harry asks gently. He has a family with Draco. Harry's heart clenches in surprising excitement.
“Harry, you can’t be serious. You don’t know what you’re doing. This is a whole nother living thing, don’t be stupid.” Ginny drops her hands to her sides, the note crumpling slightly.
“Thank you, Potter.” Malfoy says quietly, turning quickly to walk down the alley. Harry catches sight of his face and grabs Malfoys wrist suddenly, stopping him.
“What is?” Harry asks, stopping next to Malfoy.
“ Obviously help yourself to anything you want or need. Kreacher can get you just about anything, even some medicine if you need it.” Harry gestures around the space then points up the stairs. You can take any room on the first floor; they should be mostly empty guest rooms.
“No, the apricot and honey rant made you look dorky. That comment was kind of cute,” Draco smiled. “I know we just met, but I’d like to see you again.”
“Thank you, Mr. Malfoy, nothing further,” Alex said as she sat down.
“Why would I be? Yes, Harry told me everything. I also talked to Charlie,” she smiled understandingly. “Want my advice? Ditch that controlling arsehole and see where it goes with Harry. None of his friends saw him as happy with anyone as they did you. Not even Remus.”
“With my aunt. I sold my house,” Draco sniffed. “Harry, you’re not to blame.”
“Can I help you?” Harry asked.
“I do hope another food will be accompanying that dinner,” Mione raised an eyebrow at Harry.
Draco and Harry meet up and make plans to attend a birthday party together.
Raucous, upbeat laughter was exchanged between the two new flatmates as they played Uno and told each other amusing stories.
HDHDHDHDHDHDHDHDHDHDHDHDHDHDHDHDHDHDHDHDHDHDHDHDHDHDHD
“Ernie, did you ask him anything weird?” Emily chastised.
“Probably drugs,” the second guy sneered. “Bet he’s spent half his bloody life in and out of rehab.” Draco’s smile became fixed, and his face a picture of hurt. “Let’s not forget the kind of movies he’s in. He’ll probably bend over for anyone who pays him any attention.”
Meanwhile, Draco laughed throughout the entire movie at Harry, who was wearing prescription swimming goggles.
“Hello?” Draco answered.
“Now, this one here, lives a life that is the very definition of boring. And that’s saying something considering his flatmate is the Court Jester of Weirdness,” Charlie winked at Rolf as he threw his head back and laughed. “And I’m 99% sure you’ll never talk to him again once you hear his grade school nickname was…. EW!” Harry licked Charlie’s hand just as everyone else in the room said loudly, “MOPPY”
“Have you seen my glasses?” Harry asked. Harry only wore glasses when he read or watched the telly for long periods of time. “Draco’s taking me out to the cinema.”
“Liv reached out to the owner of the adult magazine I worked for. She made some rather interesting discoveries,” Draco positively glowed.
“Hey there, Har. So, you’ve got this ball of energy all weekend?” Thyme snickered, their face alight with mischief.
“Shut your fucking mouth,” Lockhart breathed in his ear. “One more word out of you…”
In light of everything going on right now, I've changed Olivia Benson's character a bit. In this story, she won't be a police officer. Instead, she will be a psychologist and private investigator, hence the significance of this chapter's title. I've also changed the scene in chapter one where Harry tells the book thief he's calling the cops to Harry telling him he's calling Charlie to ban him from the store instead.
Sorry for the long pause again. Pride Month just felt so sad this year. On top of J.K. Rowling's willingness to prove over and over again she's transphobic as fuck, Trump restricts trans rights even further on the anniversary of the Pulse Nightclub shooting. And let's not forget the rotten cherry on top of this moldy sundae: J.K. Rowling's transphobia was quoted by a Senator who voted against the now stalled Equality Act. 2020 is no one's year, to put it plainly. With all of that being said, I owe it to you, my readers to soldier on. I finished writing this fanfiction before I ever posted the first chapter, so now it's just about getting it put up. I'm hoping to have all the chapters up by the end of the week.
“You shouldn’t be walking, love. Those ribs won’t be fully healed for at least another month,” Draco fussed as he gently squeezed his shoulder in lieu of a hug. “I feel a little bit better. I told everyone what he did. Win or lose, I’ll never regret that decision.”
“It does feel very us against the world at times, doesn’t it?” Harry laughed lightly. Remus and Sirius exchanged a look and beamed at each other. “Well, Draco and I met at the shop of all places….”
“How are you, Dragon?” Harry winced as he moved from his wheelchair to the seat next to his husband’s in the cafeteria. They’d gotten married the weekend after Harry was released from the hospital. It was a small, quiet, and peaceful ceremony and reception. A bright spot in between all the dark clouds.
“Do you know Draco Malfoy?” Alex asked, her cool demeanor never fading despite the fact she was about to blow Lockhart out of the water.
“But, where’s the fun in that?” Charlie snickered as Draco reentered the room and greeted Charlie happily.
“Let’s get him to the hospital,” Hermione said softly as she untied Draco. Remus and Sirius were across the room helping Harry. Draco nodded and hurried over to Harry’s side.

“Draco, please. I know I’m the last person in the world you want to listen to right now, but hear me out,” Liv soothed. “I don’t believe he will kill him. What he needs most is money. You’re a very wealthy man. You could pay his way to a place the American and British authorities can’t touch him.”
“My name is Jamie Barker, owner of several adult publications,” the man responded.
“Naturally. I’m gay and I typically only take on queer centered projects. My character’s love interest is a trans man. Ever hear of Theo Nott?”
“Yes. Several times. I thought it would never stop. Afterwards, he told me if I told anyone he’d show the court photos and videos of my time as an adult magazine performer. Make it look like I wanted to have sex with him.”
“This is one of those moments I should be playing cool, and I’m going to monumentally fail! I absolutely and completely adore you. You are giving queer people everywhere so much hope and you’re teaching allies like myself and Rolf how to be the best allies we can be.” Luna then hugged him. Draco was surprised, but returned the hug with a bashful smile.
“Could someone show me to the loo?” Draco asked.
“Sit with me?” Harry asked, holding out his hand. Draco smiled brightly as he sat, put his arm around him, and gave him a gentle, chaste kiss.
“No, Ernie was perfect. It was nice to have a regular conversation,” Draco patted Ernie on the shoulder after Luna pulled back from the hug.
“That’s wonderful. Everyone deserves to be able to live their lives authentically,” Draco nodded and smiled. “What else would you like to know about the movie?”
“I’d like that. Any favorites?” Draco perused Harry and Hermione’s collections.
“What bait?” Draco asked.
“Marry me,” Draco blurted out, his voice thick with emotion. “When this is all over, let’s get married at Shakespeare’s church in Stratford-upon-Avon.”
“That sort of thing is popular,” Hermione said brightly. “I’m very good with tech stuff. Just let me know what you need.”
“What did you do?” Rolf asked.
“Surreal, but nice? What the fuck was that, Potter?” Harry cursed himself just as the doorbell rang again. He opened it to find Draco back.
“It just fits,” Draco agreed. “So, I’m guessing that’s a yes?”
“I think you’d be better off doing something small scale right now. Get your feet wet before jumping back into any big projects. Ever thought about starting a YouTube channel? I think you’d be brilliant doing something like that,” Harry suggested.
“Luna this is Draco,” Harry told her. She pushed him gently aside and grabbed one of Draco’s hands with both of hers.
“I hope so.” Sirius wanted to see his godson smile again. His sunny disposition had been stilted by him and Draco not seeing each other anymore.
“I dated his friend Draco for a few weeks,” Harry said timidly.
“Draco, Mr. Potter from Gaye Magazine is here,” Blaise announced as he sat down next to Draco. Harry blushed and sat down across from them.

“Hey there, Harry!” a man in a wheelchair greeted as they stepped inside.
“He’s probably talking about Diane Keaton or Meg Ryan,” Draco whispered.
“Remus,” Harry admitted. “Siri’s my godfather so I’ve always seen him as family. He had visitation rights when I was younger, and he saw me often. His presence made my home life less difficult. My aunt hated my mother and in turn she hated me. Her husband went along with her prejudice because he enjoys being cruel.”
“Dragon, help me,” Harry rasped from the other end.
“How long have you been standing there?” Ernie asked suspiciously.
“He helped me get my first few paying gigs. I started out modelling and appearing in various adverts. I enjoyed that. A lot. It wasn’t long before he was sending me to audition for photoshoots I wasn’t comfortable doing. But, he knew I wouldn’t turn down the work because I needed the money.”
“Hey there, sweetie,” Hermione held out her arms for Teddy.
“What’s this?” Lockhart suddenly spun him around, pulling Harry towards him by the chain of the necklace. “I knew you were a plant. Who put you up to this?” He shoved Harry against the wall and began choking him. “Was is my whore of an ex? His friends? That nosy American investigator? Answer me!” He loosened his grip on Harry so he could talk.
“I find that hard to believe. He’s still broken up about Remus and it’s been years,” Draco retorted skeptically. “He’s always a mix of happy and sad when he’s around him. Remus broke his heart.”
“I’m flattered. Truly. But, I don’t want to rush into anything. I’m not exactly practiced,” Harry said with a fake smile and even faker bashful blush.
“He’ll be here in a few minutes,” Draco said when he hung up.
“I owned up to all of my various wrongs to start with,” Sirius pondered. “I took him for granted. Too often. Reliable Remus, I called him. Finding you and him together wasn’t pleasant, but it gave me the kick in the bum I needed to realize what I had and what I stood to lose.”
“I didn’t at first. I was so jealous of the love Harry still feels for you,” Draco admitted as he led him into the living room and gave him a glass of Scotch. “But, I know now that the way he loves you isn’t romantic. That’s reserved for me alone.”
“His name’s Gilderoy Lockhart,” Charlie sneered. “Pretentious arrogant snob. He’s a drama teacher and a tabloid reporter, and he thinks he’s God’s gift to the masses. He’s always pressuring Draco to look a certain way. It got to the point where he controlled everything about him, from his hair and clothes, who he sees and talks to, how much time he spends with them. He’s even tried to control his diet. When Draco became a vegetarian, he tried to make him go vegan because he ‘didn’t want to be known as that award-winning journalist with a big fat boyfriend.’'
“Should I call the police?” Harry was worried now. Was someone stalking Draco?
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious is a Mary Poppins reference. Great movie! I am a huge fan of Julie Andrews!
“Gilderoy Lockhart you’re under arrest for the sexual harassment of five Julliard students, the rape of Draco Malfoy, the kidnapping, assault, and attempted rape of Harry Potter, stalking, menacing, and extortion. You have the right to remain silent, anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford one the court will appoint one to you. Do you understand these rights as I’ve read them to you?” Liv asked in a calm cool tone.
“And you’ll what? Rape me? Kill me? I don’t think you’ve got the guts,” Harry challenged.
“No one, I swear! Please don’t hurt me!” Harry was really afraid now.
“So, Draco, what is it that you do?” Ernie asked as Draco made Harry and himself Cosmopolitans at the bar.
“He thinks you’re always going to pine for Remus,” Mione said to put off discussing the massive elephant in the room.
Harry leaned in close, running his fingers over Draco’s cheeks and temples. “Kiss me, Harry. Please. I’ll let you know if I can’t handle something.” Harry complied, and gently kissed Draco.
“We thought you were just friends,” Dudley reasoned.
“It can be exciting, but it can also be tedious. I work really long hours. The pay is excessive. More than most make in a lifetime I daresay,” Draco said with a sad smile. He loved his work, but he didn’t love the idea that he had so much when so many others had so little. His aunt was a medical assistant and her salary was modest, so he knew how it felt to just get by.
“I know you’re screwing him. I’m a tabloid reporter, and I’m very good at my job,” Lockhart said with a nasty smile.
“It’s Luna’s friend Thyme,” Remus answered Harry’s earlier question. “They’re a preschool teacher through the week and work with Luna in admissions at the zoo on Saturdays and Sundays.”
“Did you leave the lights on?” Harry pointed to Draco’s upstairs window when they parked in Draco’s driveway.
“I’ll speak with them soon and let you know,” Harry said warmly.
, it could have been a lot worse,” Dudley pointed out and winked at his brother in law. Ernie smiled gratefully and raised his glass in salute.
So, there they were, bored out of their skulls, an hour into their eight-and-a-half-hour shift, when D snapped his fingers and pointed at the security camera. “It’s the same wanker we tossed out last week,” he hissed.
“It would have been better if he’d disclosed wanting an open relationship from the start,” Draco said pensively. “There’s nothing wrong with non-monogamy, but there is something very wrong about not telling someone that’s what you want.”
“Oh come

"Nothing, go back to sleep," Harry whispered, carefully sliding the window open to untie the note from the owl's leg.
“How many drops?” Harry hovered the dropper of snail slime over his potion, glancing at the neighboring desk, where Draco Malfoy was idly stirring his potion wandlessly.

“I just—” he lifted his head. “Yeah… Fuck, let me do that again,” he leaned down to kiss Draco again.

Harry grinned at Remus as he accepted the last gift, clearing aside discarded wrapping paper to make room for it on the floor.
I didn't wait for his reaction
“I’m afraid I can’t remove the potion residue with magic,” she said apologetically. “So there’s nothing I can do about that, short of giving you a sponge bath.” She gave him a sympathetic look when he winced. “So you’ll have to wash it off yourself once I discharge you. Just soap and water should do the trick.”
"What—

“So, uh,” Harry shuffled his feet. “Hogsmeade, maybe? Tomorrow?” His heart soared when Malfoy gave him a small nod. “Brilliant,” he grinned.
“I don’t have the patience to deal with this anymore!” Pansy snapped. “You guys are just a bunch of Gryffindors!”
"You made a mistake, Tom," Harry stood behind Voldemort, and a murmur went through the crowd as both sides realized who was speaking.
“Just shut up and let me shower, will you?”
"Potter!" Draco hissed, motioning for Harry to keep his voice down. "Be

It was a good attempt at humor, but Harry didn't laugh. "You really like spending time with me that much?"

“Huh? Oh, right.” He’d forgotten that they’d been sent to the hospital wing after their potion exploded. “No, not really. She didn’t even try to keep me overnight.”
Harry stretched out his palm, revealing where the broken glass had sliced through his skin, and stared apathetically at the clotting blood. “I guess I am,” he pulled out his wand and muttered a healing spell under his breath.
“Er, I guess? Yeah.”
“This blush says otherwise,” Harry said cheekily.
He scrambled away, staring at Harry in horror. "You—you

that makes more sense."
"I'm leaving." I announced, trying to turn around, but he grabbed my upper arm, forcing me to stay still. For a moment, the only sound was my uncontrolled breathing.
Not knowing what to say, Draco stared at him. Harry was staring back with wide eyes, the few inches between them laden with tension. Harry’s eyes flicked down to Draco’s lips, and the dam broke.
” Draco interrupted. “Potter added so much snail slime that his Vervé Elixir turned into a potent version of the Connectivity Draught.”
he was able to tangle his fingers through Harry’s hair as he read—and he smiled self-satisfactorily when he saw the goosebumps that arose on Harry’s arms.

As Weasley, Pansy, and Granger argued with each other, Blaise merely stared into the center of the table, eyes wide with exasperation.
Harry bit his lip and smiled, thinking about the night before when Draco had talked him through a nightmare and stroked his hair until he fell back asleep. “Yeah, he is.”

“Sorry,” Harry said shortly, grabbing his schoolwork with a huff and dumping it on his bed. “And thanks, I guess.”

that means they saw how much Malfoy would follow Harry around.” He smirked at Draco, who slowly turned red.
c’mon!
"Might I also add," Weasley said, "all of sixth year?"
As soon as the moss was submerged, it began to bubble rapidly, emitting thick steam and changing to a bright red color. Harry jumped back as their potion exploded, splattering them in thick liquid.
Harry left the bathroom, ignoring the breakfast spread on the table and instead headed for his desk. He had a pile of schoolwork he’d been neglecting, after all. If he concentrated hard enough, maybe he could forget about the nightmare entirely.
He sighed. "I'm not going to tell anyone," he said, exasperated. "Do you want me to swear it? Because I'll swear it—"

until Draco pulled away roughly at the sound of the door opening again.
Ancient Magic was on the sixth floor corridor, which meant that—yes, there it was. I hurried over to the knight statue, ducking behind its accompanying tapestry.

And what took you so long?”

Harry,” Ron covered his eyes. “A little restraint, maybe?
Draco pulled away and grinned satisfactorily at the dumbfounded look on Harry's face. "You were saying?" He asked sweetly, tucking a lock of hair behind his ear.
He even apologized to Ron and Hermione at the beginning of the year!”
“Well, because you—” he rubbed the back of his neck in a very Harry-like fashion. “Because you’ve never mentioned marriage before, not even in passing; I had no idea if you, I don’t know, thought it was stupid, or something.” He waited a moment before continuing. “I’ve been stressing about this for months,” he confessed.
It wasn't supposed to end like this, you know.
"So, Draco, did you have a nice day?"

He shrugged. “Well, I’ve always thought you were a little insane, anyways.”

Harry insisted. “He’s
Draco still looked unsure, but when Harry threatened to forgo his own lunch, too, he gave in. Harry tried to engage in conversation to distract him, but his mind was too preoccupied. Instead, he reached for Draco’s hand and gave it a squeeze, like he’d done hundreds of times before. He gave Draco a small smile and ignored the blush across the blonde’s face.

Once the laughter finally died down, Hermione put her hands on her hips. “Okay, now that that’s settled, I’ve prepared study schedules for everyone—you too, Malfoy—so we can catch up now that quarantine is over.” She procured a stack of parchment from her bag, ignoring Ron’s groan. “I used a different colour coding method this time, so I’d like your feedback once you’ve gone over them….”

“I love that,” he grinned. “How did they find all of the notes, though?”
He listened closely for the sound of Ron's breathing and waited a whole five minutes before deciding it was safe.
“What did you mean when you said you’ve slept in worse places?”
It was on one of these bad days that Harry dragged himself home from work, fully intending to get changed and snap himself out of the bad mood before Draco could see him like this. They'd had this date night planned for months, and Harry wasn't about to ruin it because he wasn't able to suck it up and push through the day.
“Not with my sanity intact, no.” Draco folded his arms across his chest.
Sadly, Harry was easily distracted.
“You could think about all of the innocent Muggles being killed up in Gloucester,” Draco suggested innocently, “that ought to get back to your old self-sacrificing self.”
“—even Weasley is more competent than you at potions, Potter, so don’t even try to swing that with me. You’re

“Oh…” Ron furrowed his brow, and Hermione gave him a sharp look. “Uh, I think I have it, then,” he sneezed, “I thought it was just allergies.

A small voice in the back of his head reminded Harry of what Draco had told him—that he didn’t have to

"It's okay, take your time," Harry smirked.
” Hermione smirked at Harry before returning to her dinner.
The room looked just like the eighth year dormitories, aside from the extra furniture. In the corner was a small fireplace with a few chairs, right next to a table for eating.
“Breathe, love. This is as new to you as it'll be to them.” Molly rocks gently with the baby in her arms.
“See you sap, you do like kids.” Harry whispers, not wanting to break this moment. His heart feels stupidly full.
“Yes, we should get to work, it'll be a long day.” Malfoy says, walking out of the room.
"What is this all about?" Harry asks, this whole conversation is sitting under his skin uncomfortably.
“Hermione told me you work with repairing magical buildings. I need help with Grimmauld place.” Harry says, choosing to gloss over his odd behavior for now. He supposes this is an awkward situation after all. He sees Malfoy physically deflate from his defensive pose.
“Alright so if you cast on that side of the kitchen and I start on this side, the fabric should become visible, then we can work on identifying the spellwork.” Malfoy walks to the far wall and Harry walks to the wall near the doorway. They cast against their respectful sides and a mesh like grid of golden strings interwoven with colored strings appears above the surfaces of the room.
“Oh..” Malfoy trails off, seeming to mull over his options as he finally digs into the food. He chews his bite then swallows. “ Today, I suppose.”
“It's okay, Harry. This is a lot happening very fast.” Hermione pats his back in the way she knows grounds him.
“Probably the hallway. We want to see how the magic moves, to confirm this is the core.”
“Oh Merlin! That's really a baby, Harry!” Ron exclaims in a baby voice. Harry gently hands the baby to Hermione who coos softly.
pulsing gold and admires the way it seems to breathe. “ I see why you called it fabric.”
“Good, I’m hoping you’ll do what you need to be comfortable here.” Harry nods before getting up and refilling his glass just for something to do.
“Oh right...of course.” Harry's nods as well. “Yes he is.”
“Okay. So first let me show you the diagnostic spells. We’ll be done a lot faster if we both cast.” Malfoy shows Harry the sweeping movement of his wand and teaches him the incantations necessary to detect and identify the spell work.
Draco is quiet for a long moment. "Okay."
Malfoy nods softly. “ I think I would like to meet her actually.”
“Malfoy?” Harry calls softly. Malfoy jumps slightly.
“Okay, I've been looking for you actually.” Harry says, he goes to continue but stops when Malfoys head snaps up and his eyes widen, shifting from side to side.
“ I knew it, your gay.” Ron says beaming. Harrys jaw drops and his cheeks flame up hotly. Hermione smacks his shoulder.
“What?” Hermione asks gently, Ron still spluttering next to her.
"Harry we can't keep this baby, it won't fix our relationship, just like we discussed. We aren't the same people. I...I..I have my harpies career! I just signed the four year contract! I'll be out of the country for months! You can't keep this baby!"
“Are you okay, you look sick.” Harry asks just loud enough to be heard. He takes in Malfoys sunken cheeks and oddly blue parlor, the dark circles under his eyes and his dirty worn robe that falls around him in an odd fitting billow.
Harry scoots back from the table, the chair scraping the floor loudly. He makes his way to the floo and heads to the burrow.
Harry nods softly then smiles down at the bundle of blankets that is now his daughter.
“I'm not about to walk around this huge house on an empty stomach first thing in the morning, Malfoy.” Harry shakes his head.
Harry stood to answer the quiet knocking that echoed through the whole apartment. Running a hand through his hair and gathering himself, he starts the walk through the hall. Pausing at the door he takes one last breath preparing himself for the inevitable recognition and rejection that always leaves him sour. The last thing he needs after another fight with Ginny. When he opens the door to an empty hallway he feels an odd mixture of relief and annoyance that has him pressing his teeth together with a harsh clack. He checks down the empty halls in both directions before sighing and making to close the door. A garbled whine has him stopping and kneeling. A small basket with an envelope tucked into the fabric sits on his doorstep. His face pales and his heart leaps to his throat. A baby. A newborn baby lay idly in the throws of fabric wrapped gently around its body. Harry's mind flashes through several briefly debilitating thoughts that this mirrors his own childhood far to accurately. He reads the card "Ginevra Weasley" written in a beautiful sprawling script. Harry's breath leaves him in one long exhale.
“Yeah, I'm surprisingly okay with it. I don't think either of us has been very happy for a while.” Harry sighs and pulls at his fringe.
“We both want to know and Harrys not dumb.” Hermione rolls her eyes back at him and crosses her arms.
“ Okay time to get you comfy, love.” He murmurs to her. He sets the bag onto the coffee table and opens it. He unshrinks the crib they’d packed and puts the extra blanket over the wicker to make a soft, fuzzy bottom. He sets Lily onto the cushion and runs a finger briefly over her cheek, a soft smile on his lips.
I want to apologize firstly for the surprise but the truth is I had a baby that I can't take care of. I don't have the money, the space, the support. It's just me and I can't do it on my own. But you… you have a big family and money and a roof and….so much that I can't give them. They aren't named and….I didn't let anyone tell me anything about the baby. It had to be a clean break or I'd never be able to let go. It's so important to me that this baby gets a good life and that they are raised well. Better than I was. I cant taint this baby with my past or I'll never forgive myself. Please please please keep them and love them and don't ever let them know that they aren't yours. Because if it ever found out who I was….it'd hate itself. I know you guys will do right by them….and that Harry will learn to love them. After all, he should see some of himself in them. If you choose to not keep them...I understand. This is a burden I’ve thrusted on to you guys with no warning. I considered an orphanage myself but ultimately I couldn't get the image of the situation being the choice between raising a Harry Potter or a Tom Riddle. And I chose Harry, I always will.
“Well today is going to be mostly surveying. Seeing what state the house is in, how cooperative it's going to be, and what kind of magic is woven into the core. Since this is a traditional pureblood home, I imagine a lot of nasty spellwork will be woven into the house. So today will be identifying and cataloging that kind of stuff so that I can work on unweaving it from the fabric of the core to make the house more welcoming. I imagine it’ll be some rough work. By the end of the day, if we have our basework done, I should be able to give you a time and money estimate.”
“I know… but to be fair, his work was excellent, and he apologized to me, several times really.” Hermione says defensively.
“I'm not fond of peppers or pineapple.” Malfoy says, chewing on his nails.
“Yeah, you can say that again.” Malfoy says, his eyes slipping closed. Harry takes the brief opportunity to run his eyes across Malfoys form. No doubt he was horribly hot in the baggy robes. He sees the bright flush on Malfoys cheeks and the ways his chest seems to heave under the cloak and decides he probably ought to get Malfoy something else to wear. He debates how to approach the topic without highlighting the distinct lack of things Malfoy has. He doesn't want to offend him after such a nice day of progress.
“ Well… there's really no other way to say it so I’m just gonna come out with it.” Harry says, sighing.
Harry stares for a moment longer.
“No you're not, you were always eating them at Hogwarts.” Harrys says with a wave of his hand. He mixes all the sliced fruit together then turns back to the hob to flip the eggs that are sizzling on the cast iron. He adds a pinch of salt, garlic salt, onion powder, and paprika, then turns off the heat.
“I don't think so, sir. It seems she had a hard enough time letting go, I don't want to make it worse.” Harry admits. Arthur nods and tucks the note into the basket Molly left behind.
"Oh...um cause Hermione said even if she's a baby she'll be recognizing spaces soon and I don't want her to get too used to the burrow...so with the first floor sorted I figured having her around would get her used to being here." Harry scratches at his neck with his wand, though it more slides than scratches against the sheen of sweat he seems to live in nowadays.
“Are you gonna be sick again?” Harry asks standing up, casting an Accio to summon the waste basket from the bathroom. Malfoy shakes his head but screws his fist tighter against his lips. Harry sets the wastebasket down in front of Malfoy.
“ I’m okay with you leaving, I want you to be happy. I can talk to Molly. She’ll help. Obviously the mother doesn’t see herself being fit enough to raise this baby, Ginny. I have money, support, a home. I can make this work.” Harry feels confident in himself, he at least has a blueprint of how not to treat a child and that has to count for something.
Harry hesitates briefly in the fireplace before stepping out and dusting them both off with a quick swish of his wand. Lily bristles at the movement, wiggling in her blankets.
Malfoys hesitates then nods softly.
“No, just tea.” Harry replies.
“I was not!” Harry says defensively his face flushing hotter. Right when he thought he might survive this conversation.
“Okay, before we start the walkthrough, I’d like to ask some questions to start the profile.” Malfoy rubs his stomach with a frown. “Is there somewhere we can sit?”
“I trust him.” Hermione says confidently.
“Oh.” Malfoy says from behind him. “Oh Merlin.”
“Whenever, honestly.”  Malfoy tucks his hands away into the folds of his cloak, like he could hear what Harry had thought about them.
“I...I suppose it is.” Malfoy says quietly. Leaning back against the couch, Malfoy looks stunned.
"Well then…I'll leave you to it for the night. Same time tomorrow, Malfoy?" Harry sets his stack of gold onto the coffee table. Malfoy nods softly, staring at the gold from his spot on the dusty sofa.
“Today or tomorrow?” Harry asks.
Harry turns around and makes his way to her crib, trusting that Malfoy will follow.
“No thank you.” Malfoy replies, pouring himself some.
Malfoy misses his step, stumbles into the wall, and bashes his hand against the door frame. His face goes from pained to hurt to sad to sorrowful to blank to a facetious sneer.
“Learn about the house? What’s there to know?” Harry asks, genuinely curious.
“You made coffee?” Malfoy says before noticing the abundance of food on the table.
“Harry, oh my god, I’m gonna cry.” Hermione hands the baby to Ron who's beaming brightly. She wipes at her eyes then hugs Harry tightly. “I love it. If you need anything you let us know, okay?”
“Well lucky you that I'm not either!” Harry says. “Good, I really didn't want to have to start over cause you have an allergy or something.”
He walks quietly to the kitchen deciding to make some breakfast while he waits. He absentmindedly hums a tune from Lily’s charmed mobile and starts gathering the ingredients. Thanking the powerful stasis charms on the pantry and fridge. He tries to remember the way Molly had bustled around when she cooked but he still fumbles his way around looking for the pans. He finally finds what he's looking for and starts on the eggs. He debates a full fry-up but if Malfoy’s been starving he doesn't want to make him sick so he settles on some fresh fruit and some scrambled eggs with some veggies. He’s just started on the fruit while the veggies and eggs cook when Malfoy walks in. He’s showered and combed his hair back. He looks significantly better. Harry shoots him a quick smile then focuses back on cutting the fruit.
Harry watches him walk to the room he's been occupying. He watches him shut the door behind him and feels in the wards when Malfoy casts Locking charm after locking charm against the door.
“Well, maybe you should consider it. Try picturing your future, your life, even Lily’s future and see if there's a place in it for him. Does it fill you with happiness and excitement?” Hermione cards her fingers through the hair at the crown of Harry's head. He pictures the same scene from before, cooking with Malfoy and Lily. He fleshes out the image, picturing the conversation, the tone, the feelings. He tries to imagine a swift image of a dream day. Breakfast, a walk in the garden, picking fresh produce for lunch, maybe a couple of hens for eggs and hives for honey and pollination. He pictures it all with Malfoy holding his hand and laughing in the sun with him, lily on Malfoys hip, smiling up at the sky, and his heart feels too full. Before he really has a grasp on what's happening he sobs against the table top. He lifts his arm and folds in front of his face, cocooning his face against the wood.
“Okay, good. I'm going to head out then. See ya tomorrow.” Harry makes his way to the floo then goes back to the burrow. He feels oddly sad about just how sick and tired Malfoy seemed. Hopefully tomorrow he’d be a little better.
“When….when I first found you...you were still sick.” Harry says
“It's a baby girl.” Harry says, beaming at his friends' support. “ I was thinking of Lily Jean, after my mum and you, Hermione.”
“Are you ready?” Harry asks, gesturing behind himself. “ I set her up in the parlor.”
"You had our baby. Magic has been surprising me since the day I turned 11. I'm not about to start cursing that now." Harry feels his anger slip away as he accepts the truth. "Oh my god...do you think it could happen again? If we leave the fertility line?"
“I think I’d like to, yeah.” Harry looks at them both.
"How could I?" Draco sighs again and looks back at Harry.
“Oh?” Ron says around a bite of chips.
Molly bustles toward the kitchen with the baby. Arthur waits for Molly to be out of ear shot then leans over toward Harry.
“ I think we ought to let the baby sleep now, it's half past ten.” Molly announces, coming back from the kitchen. “Harry, you should stay close, she’ll most likely wake up in a few hours, hungry or dirty. We don't know when the last time she ate was so it could be either...or both.”
“Molly will be more than happy to watch the baby while I fix it up. How hard can it be?” Harry is nodding and forming plans already. “I’ll stay at the burrow tonight, so Molly can help.”
“How do you know all this, it's brilliant really.” Harry asks, pushing away from the kitchen island he was leaning on.
Malfoy quickly chews, swallowing earlier than he probably ought to. “ Yeah, Kreacher was able to give me some pepper-up potion and that really seemed to help.”
“Got anything needing unpacked or moved or anything, my boy?” Arthur asks.
It takes two and a half weeks of vigorous searching to finally find Malfoy. And when he does it's unintentional. He's leaving a bookstore in Diagon Alley near the entrance of Knockturn Alley, when he hears what is undoubtedly Malfoys voice rising above the chatter of the usual Saturday crowd. He follows the sound to the opening of Knockturn, only to see Malfoy pushed up against the stone wall trying to shove what looks like a thief off of him. Harry reacts before he thinks and pulls the man off him, shoving him down the alleyway. The man falls to the ground but scrambles up and runs.
“I knew it.” Hermione says softly smiling behind her hand. “In sixth year...I wont say stalking cause I know you don't like it but you were...I mean Harry, you were obsessed with Malfoy.”
“Harry...do you still like him?” Hermione asks. Ron groans gently and rubs at his own blushing face.
“Of course.” Harry leads them to the parlor where two plush sofas sit. They both cough a little at the swirl of dust that blooms in the air as they sit. Harry vanishes it quickly. Malfoy sits, rubbing his stomach gently for a moment before sitting back and pulling a tiny notebook and his wand from his pocket. Harry briefly remembers giving it back to him after his trial.
Hermione looks around in confusion. “You have a baby now?”
He stops in the doorway and watches as Malfoy paces the length of the table, a hand clasped over his heart. Harry frowns briefly.
“Right?” Harry says. “ Petunia used to tell me about how I was left in a basket on their doorstep. I couldn't say no, especially after reading the bit about Tom Riddle.”
“I understand. Next question, do you want me to only go over spellwork and remove dangerous objects or are hoping for more of an entire overhaul? Because to be frank, Potter, this house is a little….outdated...and ehem….dingy.” Malfoy says, scratching at his hair. Harry notices how unkempt it is, dirty and scraggly. Falling loose and longer than he'd ever seen it.
“Of course.”
Harry goes to the kitchen and walks back to the couch with the baby, Molly following closely behind.
"Really? Cause Hermione implied you might have a soft spot for ‘em." Harry says, folding his arms as well.
Lily stares up at Harry quietly.
He watches Malfoys jaw work as it clenches and unclenches for a moment. His eyes roll up toward the ceiling like he might cry.
“Harry?” Malfoy calls, hurrying into the room. “ You're late, I was worried!”
Harry doesn't know how to explain to them that the reason he is hesitant is not the reason they think he's hesitant. So after a moment of pause he nods softly.
-I'm sorry
“What is it Harry?” Hermione asks.
He lets them finish cooking on the cooling pan while he grabs plates and forks, setting them on the table. Then he sets the bowl of fruit down and grabs his pot holders to place the cast iron on.
Harry thinks for a moment. “ Your name is the name on the lease, you can have the apartment. I'll go back to Grimmauld.”
Harry supposes Draco had made up his mind about the after part as well because when they stand up from the table, the room expands triumphantly into double its size, if not larger. Harry watches in awe as the room fizzles with magic. The life lines are exposed and contracting as they expand over the new surfaces. The magic integrating into the new space with ease and comfort.
“Harry that house is a death trap!” Ginny turns around, throwing a hand to her forehead.
"I don't-" Harry cuts himself off and shuts his eyes. "It's not that I don't- well I-"
A long room with a wall of mirrors sits empty and grand. Malfoy stands against the far side of the room, a low stage glowing beneath the golden fabric of magic. The spell work is loose and barren here. The walls echo Harry's footsteps as he makes his way to Malfoy. He doesn't remember this room.
“The burrow.” He announces, letting the floo powder drop.
“So you're feeling better?” Harry asks before noticing Malfoy has a mouthful of apple. “Sorry.”
“Would you like to meet her today or tomorrow?” Harry asks, his heart hammering weirdly in his chest. He doesn't know why but he wants Malfoy to like her.
Harry smiles up at Molly. “I'm hoping to fix up Grimmauld Place.”
"What do you mean?" Harry asks, taking a step closer. "I'm sure you'll find a lovely witch-
Malfoy smiles and nods, writing more. “He still a cranky old elf?”
“I think I'd like to leave some sort of legacy for Sirius...but I don't want to leave it the same.” Harry says, running a hand through his fringe.
“Life lines?” Harry asks
“Well....I don't know. But my anxiety had no trouble providing some colorful scenarios yesterday. I'm sorry for my behavior.” Malfoy takes a long sip of his coffee
“I know I’ve done this a million times before but thank you for this, Harry.” Molly purses her lips briefly. “ With everyone out of the house it's been quiet, and a bit lonely.”
“I want to make this house a home, ultimately...but I don't know the first thing about that. I...am certainly not attached to the way it currently is. It's quite….dark.” Harry admits, rubbing at his neck and looking around the dingy, dark room.
"Stop. It's fine. You can bring her." Malfoy rubs at his face. "I think I'm done for the day, actually. Today can be 50 galleons."
"Is Lily going to be a problem? Because if so then I'm not sure I trust that this place will be safe enough for us." Harry says defensively.
“Why?” Malfoy asks suspiciously.
Harry looks at Draco and tries to read his body language. He doesn't like what he sees. Draco sits straight with a pale face and a clenched jaw.
Malfoy cracks a smile at that. "Perhaps. I'm not very familiar with the health magic lines."
“Okay so here's what we know. Everything but the red and a couple of the green seems to be beneficial and I would suggest keeping it. However if you'd like to start with just the basework and have the house add its own life lines as you live here we can do that.”  Malfoy says, setting his notebook on the table, dropping the visibility of the spellwork.
“I suppose not.” Malfoy says, grabbing a helping of the eggs first. Harry scoops a bit of each onto his plate. He stands up and grabs two glasses.
“Hermione, Harry has a baby to think about now, do we trust Malfoy to not do something malicious?” Ron asks, his brow knit together tightly.
“What?” Ron echoes
“And? Is that not a fair exchange?” Harry asks, daring Malfoy to protest.
"Jesus Christ. Were we actually just given a newborn fucking baby?" Harry breathes in disbelief, his finger runs circles along the baby's tiny rosy cheek as it begins snoozing.
Harry finds himself shaking his head. “No, I won't do that to her. It obviously took a lot of strength to give the baby up.”
Harry nods, overwhelmed. He watches Malfoy pluck at the red strings. He turns to his wall and casts how Malfoy had shown him, seeing the blue lines glow and waver as he runs the diagnostic spell over them. He's gone over all the blue by the time Malfoy has finished the red, green and the silver. He's much slower than Malfoy it seems.
“I got the vibe that you weren’t ready for that and I understand. I don't want to make you uncomfortable and I don't want to make her uncomfortable so….another time.” Harry says, plating himself some food.
“I'm fine, Potter. I need to go now. Thanks again.” Malfoy replies, avoiding eye contact. He sounds bone deep tired.
“What's wrong Harry, is everything okay?” Ron asks, turning around in a circle to survey the room.
Harry uses his foot to shut the door behind him.
“Thanks. I would have you come after you were better if I'd known.” Harry says knowing that this was definitely the best option for Malfoy. He was only going to get worse on his own. His cheeks heat up a little at the praise.
“You and Ginny must be proud.” Malfoy says with a wavering tone.
“Yeah, stuff influenced by moods, conversations, desires...stuff like that mostly. Remember the fertility line?” Malfoy says, disarming the red string and watching it sizzle into nothing.
Malfoy looks briefly like he wants to protest but nods anyway.
Harrys insists on taking the weekend off after deciding he is in much need of a pub night. He briefly considers inviting Malfoy, but decides alcohol and Malfoy sound like a bad idea.
“And… you’re keeping it?” Arthur asks gently, looking between Molly and Harry. Molly purses her lips in distaste at the question but looks nervously at Harry as they wait for the answer.
"I was hoping you'd tell me." Harry turns and picks up the basket gently. He turns back to Ginny who begins reading.
“What if I fuck it up, ‘Mione?” He whispers in her ear.
Harry pauses and sighs. “I’m not being very clear but basically when I’ve been picturing my future, you’re a part of it and I don't want to be presumptive, like...this isn't a proposal or anything but...i don't know. I'm just trying to say I like like you but I'm horrible at words and feelings I guess.”
Harry quickly washes the dishes then turns back to Malfoy.
Harry awkwardly rubs at his neck. “ I don't have any real...budget. It's sort of just however much it takes to make this place safe for Lily and I.”
“Sorry. I've been unwell for a little while. That was the most refreshing Aguamenti I've ever tasted.” Malfoy says handing the cup back to Harry. He vanishes the cup back to the kitchen then helps Malfoy stand upright.
“ I did some diagnostics on the bedroom I slept in last night just to see where it was health wise and-”
“Yeah, it makes me nauseous too.” Harry attempts to sound reassuring. It takes Malfoy a full minute of being hunched over retching up nothing for Harry to confirm that Malfoy is definitely not okay. He Accios a glass from the kitchen then casts an Aguamenti. He hands the cup to Malfoy who takes it with shaky hands, he swallows a small sip. They stand together awkwardly while he slowly finishes the water.
Harry beams at him. “Alrighty, you keep eating while I go grab her.”
“ I was hoping to stay here while I fix up Grimmauld. I don't know what I'm doing…. at all” Harry admits with a slight smile. “ I was hoping to learn from the best. Molly?”
“Pardon?” Malfoy asks, still sipping at his coffee.
"Alrighty then….goodnight." Harry says lamely, scratching at the back of his neck. He waves awkwardly then steps through the floo. Hoping the image of a lone tear rolling down Malfoys cheek won't be seared into his brain forever.
"And you presume Granger knows things like that about me? You lot don't know the first thing about me!" Malfoy clenches his wand until his knuckles are white.
“Oh well actually I'm deathly allergic to apples.” Malfoy exclaims
“Well not like...recently. It was like...a few months ago, almost a year now actually.” Harry rubs at the back of his neck.
Harry laughs quietly and plates a heaping helping of as much as he can fit, then sits at the table. Malfoy follows suit. They quietly eat for a while before Harry works up the nerve to say anything. He silently debates waiting until after today's work which snowballs into considering if he should wait until the whole house is done, seeing as they haven't even started on objects yet. But he decided he ought to pluck up the courage and be done with it.
Lily and I are staying at the burrow until it's safe here, so if need me floo-call there. Okay?” Harry asks, stepping away from Malfoy who looks pale.
“Harry, I'm still leaving. I won't stay even if you choose to keep this baby.” Ginny whispers through her tears. Harry feels his own eyes fill up too. He hasn't been happy here for a while. The empty apartment while Ginny’s away only to fight and cry when she's around.
“Is it just a crush or could you see him being a life partner?” Hermione asks, Ron makes a strangled noise of distaste.
“Oh...really?” Harry asks, taken aback.
“No! No, I'm not gay, guys.” Harry says defensively, “That's not the news at all! Gin and I broke up and well…I have a baby now.”
Harry just stares dumbly with a slack jaw for a long long moment, running the thought through his mind over and over and over again.
“So you really have a baby?” Hermione asks standing up, clapping once. “ I wanna see!”
“I don't know, I think if he knew about Lily he would be extra careful.” Hermione rubs at her jaw again. Harry feels his heart warm at the thought that Malfoy has a sweet spot for kids.
“Would you like me to try and find the Mother, Harry?” Arthur asks, holding the note up.
“Oh my god. It's beautiful.” Harry exclaims, stepping back from the wall. He looks around at the
“Oh my god, Harry.” Hermione says softly with tears forming in her eyes. “So precious.”
“I didn't bring Lily.” Harry says. He watches Malfoy sort of deflate against his chair, nodding.
“Okay. I can show you around real quick so you know where the essentials are then you should get some rest.” Harry helps him stand, actively ignoring how his hand wraps completely around his wrist with no trouble and a little overlap. He leads him down the hall to the bathroom, pointing it out then continues to the kitchen.
“Maybe we can track down the mother.” Ginny wipes under her eyes. “ It seems like maybe she was on the side of the death eaters or something.”
“She's lovely, Harry. Thank you for giving her my name.” She mumbles into his neck, then enters the floo with Ron. They disappear in a quiet flurry of green flames and Harry turns toward Molly.
“Water please.”
“I think we should wait until tomorrow to do the walkthrough.” Harry says shuffling awkwardly from foot to foot. “You can stay here tonight and we can start early tomorrow, if you're feeling better?”
“Today’s the day!” Harry says excitedly. “My little baby gets her first field trip!”
“Are you going to talk to him about it? I imagine you're feeling a lot of complicated emotions about it.” Hermione folds one hand over the other and leans forward. Harry prepares to be grilled alive.
"Okay we can talk about that in a second, right now I'd like to address the baby in our hallway with your name on it." Harry cards a hand through his hair, his fingers catching on the knots that always seem to form in the fringe.
“Oh dear, are you doing okay?” Molly asks, squeezing him into a side hug.
Molly beams at him, no doubt remembering the pride and joy of her own babies.
“Well that's for you to find out, though I’ve certainly begun to notice some things.” Malfoy laughs gently and Harry wishes it didn't make his heart skip. He wishes he didn't notice that Malfoy was back into perfectly tailored clothes that hugs his stronger looking body perfectly. That his hair is gleaming softly in the warm morning light coming from the windows. That the smell of lemons and smoky vanilla has been making Harry's knees weak. He's embarrassed to notice any of it. To desire it. He had hoped, all those months ago, that his desires would change. That he would change. He wanted to fit the mold given to him by his friends and families expectations and just once he had wanted to be what they wanted. Harry purses his lips.  “For one I’ve noticed the house likes when you cook instead of having Kreacher do it. The kitchen gets brighter and little things change. “
“Sort of, it can't like….read thoughts it more...hmm..it more...senses wants and needs. Like...for example, you have a nightmare and wake up sweaty, scared, and alone. The house might pick up those feelings and produce a soft lavender scent or maybe rain noises or a glass of water. Stuff like that. Of course, the nicer to the home you are and the longer you live here the more tailored the responses will become. Like, it might respond with all those but notice after you're calm that you didn't drink the water, so it might try tea, warm milk, or even a finger of brandy next time. It wants to learn about you and take care of you. So that you will learn about it and take care of it.” Malfoy scratches at his chin and admires the way the long windows seem to grow brighter with his explanation.
“ I know I know. I think maybe...it was just Ginny...It felt like she only wanted to have a baby to keep us together… but neither of us was happy together...I didn't want to raise a baby in that.” Harry rings his hands tightly together. “We broke up right after I found the baby...It felt like maybe destiny. Like fate knew I did want a baby….just not with Ginny. No offense of course.”
“Sorry if I made it weird...God I knew I should have waited until tonight to say anything.” Harry tugs at his hair and sets his head against his hands.
“Honestly it's all fit in my pockets, so I don't think so.” Harry pats at his pockets.
“This was the note that the mom left with her.” Harry says handing it to Hermione who reads it out loud.
“You think so?” Harry asks, hoping his voice doesn't sound weird. He’s not ready for that conversation. He probably won't ever be.
“You have all of us to help, don't be daft.” She continues patting softly.
“Probably since you brought...Lily...the house will really start snowballing on the effort to keep you here.” Malfoy turns to Harry. “Shall we move on to the next room?”
“I want to disclose to you before anything happens that I have a daughter now so the house needs to be repaired and safe.” Harry says, emphasizing the safe. Malfoy closes his eyes and falls back against the brick. Harry knits his eyebrows and purses his lips.
"Don't tell me you're not noticing how we don't have any good days anymore, Harry."
Harry fills both glasses then settles back down, scarfing up his food then downing his water. He's finished before Malfoy even scoops his fruit onto his plate. All at once the awkwardness of their past catches up to him. He shuffles awkwardly, trying not to notice the way Malfoy's hair is bright and clean and the way it curls along to bottoms with its new length.
“Health wise?” Harry asks, confused.
Harry is sweating and dead on his feet by the time they call it a night. He feels bad for pushing Malfoy that hard. If he's this tired no doubt Malfoy is near collapsing. But they had gotten through the whole house, even the cellar and attic. Harry collapses onto the sofa and Malfoy follows suit across from him.
Malfoy closes his eyes tightly, his posture deflating. He brings a hand up to his eyes and sighs deeply.
“Well...it's um...to be honest it's going great. The house is really coming along and I'm learning a lot. Malfoy knows what he's doing that's for sure.” Harry rubs at the stubble that's growing in and sighs. “I have to tell you guys something though.”
“I had too much tea, my stomach is roiling, oof.” Harry leans forward with his hands on his knees.
“That's very adult of you, however, we can leave the room untouched for the most part, Harry. Cleaning it and checking spellwork can be mostly touchless, if you'd prefer.” Malfoy looks away awkwardly and Harry took the moment to really consider what he wanted. He’d had a while to think about it and he thinks he's mostly made peace with the fact that leaving the room would only serve to hurt him.
“I thought you weren't ready for a baby.” Ron asks, craning his neck around the room trying to spot the baby.
“Right.” Harry says, feeling dumb for asking. “Which room should we do next?”
“Ready when you are.” He says rubbing his hands dry on the jeans he's wearing.
“I didn't think it’d be so much work. I’ll bring some old clothes I was gonna throw out for us to wear so we don't ruin our everyday clothes.” Harry says, letting his eyes shut casually as well, in case Malfoy tried to read his body language.
“I...made a lot because I started then suddenly couldn't remember anything we’ve eaten over the last few weeks.” Malfoy gestures to the plates of food. “But there's no pineapple or peppers!”
Molly looks taken aback, a teary smile on her lips. “Of course, love.”
“I’ll try and get a hold of him, but I don't think I’ll tell him about Lily. To be safe.” Harry says nodding
"You just said it yourself, Harry! You weren't ready to admit anything and I couldn't be the one to force you...not like that. Not then." Malfoy puffs out a watery sigh then slumps back into his chair.
“That sounds perfect. Are you finished eating?” Harry says gesturing toward Malfoys empty plate.
“This room wasn’t here before. It’s existed in this home before but it's new again, see how the color of the walls are the same cream we put in the parlor?” Malfoy plucks at the only string of red in the room. “The house is not only accepting our changes, it's integrating them. We should start seeing more light colors, windows, things like that in the next few work days. The house might even start giving us stuff.”
“That's what the colored lines are called, as stuff happens in the house it adds life lines or lines of magic that alter or influence the room. So...for example the first blue line you worked on. That was a fertility line. Someone was having a hard time conceiving a child and was obviously very upset by that so the house wove a fertility line into the spellwork, to help them have a child, most likely an heir. Possibly it was me even.” Malfoy shrugs.
“ Yeah okay. No wonder you couldn’t say no!” Ron says from the couch where he's gently rocking his arms side to side.
"I….the fertility line." Draco sobs harder against his hands, his face a bright red beneath his palms.
“Well, I can try to have it done in a couple weeks but this is honestly some of the most intense spellwork I've seen, this is one of the oldest houses I’ve ever worked on. So it could be closer to a month. And cost is...well to be frank everyday is going to be like today. What would you think is fair for that?” Malfoy says, laying an arm over his eyes.
“Well…..it's Malfoy. But I don't even know if he’s still doing that, it's been a year and some odd months since he was working with Gringotts to fix vaults in exchange for the funds to fix Malfoy Manor.” Hermione rubs at her jaw uncomfortably.
“Could you come now?” Harry asks gently, nodding away from where a couple of men were gathering to no doubt wait for Harry to leave to jump Malfoy again. Malfoy seems to notice them too and nods, pulling up his hood and following Harry out into Diagon Alley.
“Ooooo me too!” Ron rubs his hands together in excitement.
“I really am sorry about Ginny, love.” Molly smiles at him, making his heart ache again. “ I think we’ve glossed pretty heavily over that with the news of Lily and all.”
“I’ve...thought about it but I….I kind of panicked and tossed him out afterward and now I’m worried that’ll taint any potential I might have.” Harry sighs and deflates against his seat.
of them were mad—after all, they weren’t the one in this predicament.
Harry ran his hands though his hair, feeling like he’d been caught doing something wrong. “I—I mean, I guess I just didn’t hear it come in—”
Draco used his fingers to wipe away the tears that had not stopped streaming down Harry’s face.
“What is it?”
Gryffindor courage," his voice sounded bitter. "In sixth year, you found me in Myrtle's bathroom. I was crying, sobbing really, in a rather unattractive manner. We attempted to duel, you nearly killed me, the details aren't important." He looked at the floor, fidgeting with his cloak. "I—I was crying because—because I'd just realized that I'm in love with you.
Draco stared at him. “What the hell is a

Remus studied him for a moment before sighing. “Is he treating you well?”
"What about the map, then?" Weasley asked. "Do you have an excuse for that? You're always watching him on it!"
Draco propped himself up with a pillow to look at Harry. "What, the fact that you've been sneaking into my bedroom every night?"
Narcissa lifted a cup of tea and took a long sip. “You are

thought you were going to break up with me,” he confessed after a moment, hearing his sobs come back full-force.
Draco placed his hand on Harry’s knee, and the urgency in his voice made Harry open his eyes. “You are

“Did you—did you even use your

you into my bedroom? Are you
you?"
Harry's concentration faltered as he tried to get Draco to lay back on the floor. As soon as the spell was broken, the healed flesh began to split open.
“Hang on,” Ron spluttered. “I’m not saying Harry isn’t important to me—I just—” he sighed. “I don’t think he’s good for you. I mean, he’s still a git—”
"No kidding," Harry agreed, "hey, come here." Draco lifted his head so that Harry could capture his lips with his own. "Mhm, much better. Anyways, I was thinking—maybe I could tell Remus and Sirius?"
“Alright, Potter, truth or dare?”
Once they were all tested and wearing the strange magical masks, McGonagall cleared her throat. “Attention, please.” She waited for everyone to stop talking. “Given how communicable this illness appears to be, all students will be quarantined from this point onwards. Uninfected students will move to the east wing rooms in pairs, and under
he hissed, leaning over the bed, “
Draco nodded.
Harry tore his eyes away from the embers. “I’m still worried,” he admitted.
Draco’s heart skipped a beat when Harry crossed the small cabin in three long steps—
Harry’s love was subtle. It was the way he’d wake Draco from a nightmare with a soft kiss, or how he’d bring Draco lunch at work when he’d forgotten it.
“I made a lot of stuff, coffee indeed being one of them.” Harry sets the French press onto the table along with a mug. “You want any cream, sugar, milk….?”
“I have far less stuff anyway.” Harry hates that he doesn't feel as hurt as he expected. They'd been dating for 2 years now and it doesn't even feel like a break up.
“Water? Juice?” Harry calls to Malfoy from the sink.
She leans down then shoots back up.
ps. I've included all my money. It's beneath the baby. I'm sorry it's not much. "
"And why exactly is that something you think I'd want, Potter?" Malfoy stands back up right with crossed arms and a straight back. Harry recognizes it as defiance.
“Wow.” Harry says, nearly breathless.
"You're being serious." She sees the card and takes it. "Ginevra Weasley...Oh god what is this, what's happening."
“Okay, so I can say this. As we change things, the house will either resist or welcome the changes.” Malfoy says moving to the edge of the sofa and rubbing a hand over the coffee table between them. “Being a blood ancestor means I was probably the right choice for a project of this magnitude. Do you have a budget? Spellwork is fine for most stuff, but furniture is best to be replaced rather than changed.”
