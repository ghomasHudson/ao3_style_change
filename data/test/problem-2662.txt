“I’m not overly competent at healing spells,” Draco admitted, pulling out his wand. “But it will be better than nothing, I suppose.” He carefully tapped the male’s skin, murmuring an incantation and watching at the skin began to loosely knit itself together. The wound didn’t close completely, but Hermione was already nudging rolls of bandages towards Draco who took them in nimble fingers and began to wrap them carefully around Harry’s arm.
“Hmm? Oh, it’s nothing,” Draco replied, his fingers beginning to tap across his keyboard.
“Of course…” the Slytherin suddenly continued, breaking eye contact as he leant back on his hands. “I’m sure there isn’t quite enough trust between us just yet for you to let me take control over your first time.”
“No, there’s something else I want to discuss with you,” Draco replied, placing his bag down on the wooden table-top and pulling out a seat.
Lucius lifted his head and met the burning gaze of the Dark Lord and immediately, the blond felt an immense pressure crowding his mind. Knowing at once what it was his lord was after, Lucius lowered his mental shields, allowing Voldemort full range of his inner most secrets and memories.
.” Ron batted his brother away, coming to a staggering halt before the blond, waving merrily. Percy sneered. “This is Ron,” he offered.
“I’ll win you over yet,” Malfoy purred.
“… No comment.”
—to losing all sense of himself. There the brunet had been, standing so appetisingly before him, the hum of life surging through his veins, calling,
“My lord, please accept my deepest apologies,” Lucius began carefully, keeping his gaze lowered. “There is no excuse for my failure…”
He froze. Keeping his face neutral, Draco turned gracefully, eyes landing on Potter as the young man came to stand beside him. His cheeks were reddened slightly and Draco’s brow furrowed a little in wonderment.
“Truthfully, I never actually got the chance to talk to him,” Ron admitted, taking a seat on one of the armchairs. The common room was blissfully empty as he had left it, allowing him and Hermione to speak freely. “I found Parkinson having a go at him before I even got the chance.”
Maybe it was time for a change. After all, he’d kept the same appearance since well… ever. It was time for a fresh image. Maybe if he invested in some contacts or something? Perhaps new clothes? Hardly anything he owned was actually
“If you say so,” Pansy said wryly. “Just don’t be surprised, alright? You don’t know Potter very well, neither of us do. And you never know,
“Firstly, I’ll only have to bear their presence during meals. Secondly, I have the privacy of my bedroom. Thirdly, I overheard that the Weasel and Granger are not staying for the holidays despite that Potter is. Thankfully it’s just him I have to avoid.”
6:25.
the brunet thought blissfully.
“Ah,” Potter said, pulling a face. “Is she expecting us to hold hands in the corridors or something?”
,” Malfoy groaned, chest heaving.
Hermione flinched involuntarily, biting her lip.
“Why Potter?” The blond moaned. “Why do I not have a choice in who I bond with? If at all?”
… Ron thought with a silent nod.
Lucius eyed the rusting gates, wand clenched tightly in his hand. The gate was slightly ajar and even as the blond cast a revealing spell, no further protective wards were exposed. He frowned warily.
Malfoy nodded. “It’s best to begin with the method that is in our textbook.” He gestured towards the page. “Not only does it tell you exactly which ingredients you need but it gives you hints as to why they are important judged purely on the way they are added.”
she turns on you.”
“The bond provides protection on both of their parts,” the female continued. “Harry and Draco will feel each other’s emotions and know each other intimately. Not only will the bond make Harry untouchable to other vampires, which—” Hermione smirked, “hopefully won’t be needed, but it also provides Harry with the ability to pacify and appease Draco when needed. Vampires can be tremendously passionate creatures and it is extremely rare for anyone, save their mate, who is capable of calming them. There is also, of course, the ultimate feeling of contentment and love and harmony and all that but I feel as if that were a given…” She trailed off with a gentle smile, gazing at Harry who was peering at the floor, his lips curved into his own, private smile.
Malfoy waited patiently, glancing at the half empty bottle of Firewhiskey. “Will more alcohol help?” he offered with a smile.
Potter turned his attention back to the blond-haired male, startled to see the fear emanating from the shaking figure
“You’re such an ass,” he said, a hint of benevolence present in his tone.
“Aww, no Parkinson?”
Harry chuckled throatily, wriggling his hips purposely. “Have something in mind, did you?” he asked, enjoying the way Malfoy bit his lower lip.
“I’m here, aren’t I?” Potter smirked as he stood and headed for the bed. “Besides, with all of my inexperience would
Draco visibly shuddered. “Don’t even joke about that, Potter.”
“Well come on then,” Potter said gruffly. “I’ll show you to your room.”
The blond was certainly turning out to be nothing Harry had expected. Well, that wasn’t entirely true; Malfoy was still arrogant, self-involved and conceited… but at least he was being
“Well what the fuck were you
Malfoy quirked an eyebrow. “Really, Potter? I would have thought even
With a strangled moan Draco lunged forwards, crushing Harry to his chest so quickly the Gryffindor barely had time to register the movement before long strong fingers were delving into his hair, tugging his head to the side. He felt the top button of his school shirt pop from its hole, and a split second was all it took before sharp pinpricks were burning into Harry’s skin, a keening gasp catching in his throat as Malfoy’s fangs sank deep into the side of his neck. Harry’s own hands scrambled up the Slytherin’s back, fingers twisting in the material of Malfoy’s robes and clenching tightly with each pull on the small wounds.
Draco paused. “Nothing’s changed.”
to care about her opinion.
“Oh knock it off, Perce,” the flaming candelabra replied with a snort. “By the time I realised there was a man walking around he had already been discovered. I wasn’t about to take the blame for something that wasn’t
There was a bitterness within the brunet he could not ignore. The two of them had been jubilant the day they reconciled. Everything had been like it was; no anger, no distrust. Just them. Until Harry realised just how upset he still was with the Slytherin.
But this—Malfoy walking
Harry smiled weakly, glancing at his watch. Breakfast was almost over and Ron, bless him, hadn’t complained once about not getting any food. Ron’s unwavering support these past few weeks, even with the argument with Hermione, had been such a welcome relief. The strain of constant exhausting emotions was wearing thin on Harry’s patience and energy, but Ron, as a persistent presence of strength and unquestioning support, made the entire situation bearable.
“Crap! Percy’s going to kill me,” he groaned, hurrying after the young man.
“Let me finish this paragraph and we’ll go.” Hermione sat herself back in her chair and picked up her discarded quill, hand beginning to move furiously across the page.
Hermione paused, halfway up the stairs, and turned to the sound of her name. She watched as Parkinson hurried across the stone floor and the Gryffindor descended the stairs to meet her, ignoring the looks both Ron and Harry were no doubt sending her way.
“Aww, Draco…”
. He was about to make his way down the stairs when an amused voice spoke behind him.
His eyebrows rose in surprise when he spotted a text post Harry had posted five minutes earlier.
Ron scratched his head awkwardly. “He might have told me he likes you...”
Thankfully, Dumbledore appeared to have completed this year’s speech and had returned to his chair as food magically appeared onto their tables.
“Well…” but Hermione fell silent. She knew he was right. “Still, as long as he keeps you happy then no harm done.” She nodded, as if ending the matter right then and there. “Come on, Ron, I don’t want you pestering Harry about this.”
“Allow me to take care of that,” the blond replied, stretching out an arm and murmuring, “
“No,” Hermione replied, a hint of worry in her tone. “Maybe he’s catching up on some work?”
“Draco?” Pansy murmured as softly as she could. “What’s wrong?”
But Pansy was right. There was no way Draco could continue to delude Harry any longer. His mate deserved the truth and the blond could only hope that the Gryffindor would be able to be won around.
Class was over and the corridor was dark as Harry walked side by side with Malfoy to the Slytherin dormitory. The brunet hadn’t hesitated when Malfoy invited him to his room after Charms, yet with each step that drew them closer to the green and silver dungeons, a strange feeling began to settle in Harry’s chest. The feeling strengthened as Harry followed the blond into his bedroom, watching as Malfoy crossed to the bed, unclipping his robes as he did so and throwing a look over his shoulder. A single, sleek blond eyebrow quirked upwards.
Pansy kept her tone steady. “His scent, Draco,” she explained, “was that the first time you had smelt it?” She watched, unsurprised, as Draco nodded stiffly. “And you reacted immediately to it?”
“And I know it.” Pansy blew him a kiss before breezing from his room, closing the door behind her. Draco’s smiled remained on his face; it was difficult to remain annoyed with Pansy for long—especially when she promised pictures of men.
The teapot smiled knowingly at him. “What would you like to drink? We have tea, coffee, and juices of all sorts.”
“Of course not.”
“But—but its Malfoy,” Ron pouted in reply.
Draco thought, watching another dazzling smile cross over Potter’s face.
Harry hit send and his message whisked away. He closed the page and returned to his dashboard.
“Malfoy? Draco Malfoy?” Madam Pomfrey inquired.
“I fucked up, Pansy, that’s what I did.” Draco covered his face with his hands, hating himself more than he ever had. “I couldn’t—I
Eyes twinkling, Dumbledore smiled gently at the puzzled brunet. “You and Mr Malfoy are of age, I thought it would be fitting for the two of you to indulge this evening.”
“So, um, are we going to study or what?” Harry asked awkwardly, scratching the back of his head.
“Allow me to be the judge of that, Potter,” Draco replied with a carefree wave of his hand. He approached the brunet and pushed him back against the duvet. “You think too much,” he said, leaning down to kiss him.
The room was incredibly dark. The drapes surrounding Harry’s bed were drawn tightly, as were all the curtains in the room. Lighting her wand, Hermione stepped inside and made her way to the bed, carefully pulling back a side of the drapes and peering in.
is ever your fault now is it?”
“Well it seems to me as if you might hold a special something in your heart for a specific Hermione Granger…” Harry allowed his voice to trail off, his smile widening.
“What’s up there?” Draco asked.
And Draco was not willing to allow the chance that Harry would deny him.
“Potter.”
Harry rolled his eyes indignantly, wondering why he was so nervous. “I’m not wearing
“But that’s not interesting,” Pansy protested. “I don’t even care what I’m going to do after school.”
That however, wasn’t what concerned him the most. What did was how much sense it made. For
“So did you miss me or Mione more?” Harry’s smile grew a little more mischievous as he crossed his legs, looking up at his best friend.
“Dean Thomas? From school?” Harry’s head swung around, trying to catch sight of their old school-mate as the male disappeared into the crowded street. “I wonder what got him so riled up?”
A grin broke out across the Gryffindor’s face.
… his subconscious announced.
“Yeah but who I like and my sexual orientation don’t have to be the first things you know,” Harry replied with a raise of an eyebrow. “How about questions more like, ‘What do you want to do when you leave school?’”
“I’m sure Pansy won’t allow that,” Draco said finally, clearing his throat. “And we’re getting off topic; you never did answer my question.”
“So what’s the deal with you and Malfoy at the moment?” Ron asked then, his brow creasing as he frowned. “I mean, you walked with him to class this morning, are you guys making whatever this is official?”
In a great rush, Draco felt his hunger surge, throat parch dry as he gazed achingly after the dark-haired boy. Merlin, Harry’s delectable scent seemed to fill the entire corridor, calling to Draco in such a way he could feel every cell within his being crying out, screaming for the male just beyond his reach. He allowed his eyes to close, body trembling with the effort of holding himself back.
“What is it?” she asked.
“I’m impatient,” the blond remarked, placing a hand on the back of Potter’s head and bringing his lips to his.
“They would be so lucky,” Draco retorted, lifting himself up enough to gaze down at the dark-haired male in adoration.
Harry thought tiredly. They’d only been here for ten minutes and Eli was already doing his head in with the hero worship.
Draco just prayed he had enough strength to survive the remaining thirty minutes of class.
“Aside from my uncertainty about dating a vampire?” Harry found himself saying before he could stop himself. He wasn’t surprised when Ron rolled his eyes.
“Try me,” Hermione challenged as she organised her textbooks.
“Oh yeah? I’m going to ask you some questions—”
With a small private grin, Draco began to scroll through the posts he’d missed, enjoying the wide range of different photos, music and opinions. A smirk curled at his lips when he caught sight of a gorgeous photograph of a blond young man with piercing blue eyes. One of his friend’s he’d gotten to know over Tumblr had reblogged it—and what an exquisite photo it was.
“They are used for whatever you want,” Draco replied. “In the muggle world they’re used for various things like making music, things called ‘movies’ and making pictures—ones that move as well like our paintings; they’re called gifs apparently.”
“Not the red-head, you idiot! The guy next to him!” Pansy reached over and began tugging excitably on the blond’s shirt sleeve.
it’s just…” she sighed. “Can we speak seriously now?”
caught Draco’s attention and he looked down, interest dawning on his face. “You guys have a library?”
“Are you going to draw me or not?”
,” Malfoy hissed, turning away from the dark-haired male.
“So… Malfoy really does care about Harry?” Hermione asked.
He glanced up at the female who was gazing at him with a faint frown.
“The bond requires us to be intimate. That is… to have intercourse.”
Malfoy frowned.  “Care to elaborate?”
The blond laughed. “Don’t tell me you actually believed that,” he smiled, stalking over to where Potter stood.
“Yes I looked,” Hermione admitted. “And I’m sorry that I sneaked a peak but I only did because I knew you had been meeting up near him when you went on your walks.”
“No, your question just caught me off guard—I guess I was surprised to hear that you actually
Malfoy’s nose crinkled. “Typical,” he muttered, crossing his arms.
Harry…”
going to get along just fine.”
Harry felt a shiver run through him. The blond had discovered during their intimate moments that Harry had a particularly ticklish spot just above his right collar bone. It soon became apparently that that was exactly where Malfoy was headed.
“What else would you call them?” she asked innocently, falling into step beside him. “So…?”
After a while, Draco was coerced by Fred and George into a snowball fight. Of course, it wasn’t so much an amicable decision of snow-war than the wardrobe deciding that a lump of snow would look spectacular powdering over freshly washed blond hair, but Draco was never one to back down from a challenge.
“Hmm? Oh, however you want I guess,” Harry replied. “How do
how much I wanted to be them, how much I’d love to be beneath you, the Great Harry Potter—”
“I—I am glad to hear that, my lord…” the male kneeling said after a brief pause.
After checking and replying to Malfoy, Harry felt strangely happy. He wasn’t used to Malfoy asking after his feelings—it meant that the Slytherin actually
Draco chuckled. “Then stop tempting me.”
“Draco?” she began, frowning in concern.
“Is everyone here some form of… implement?” Draco asked faintly, feeling rather lightheaded. “I don’t—I… this is impossible.”
Distracted as they were, Draco couldn’t help but pause, his gaze flicking back up to the dark corridor. As the two objects marched away happily, the blond slipped silently back up the stairs, curiosity
“I enjoy the company of cats,” Malfoy had admitted. “You tell anyone and you’re a dead man.”
Draco snorted. “The best part? If I had to make the choice again… I would still deny the Dark Lord. I may be a dark creature… but at least I am free of him.” He laughed bitterly. “That’s why we—
The brunette blinked, focusing on Granger’s face.
Refusing to give in, Malfoy kissed Harry into submission, leaving the brunet panting and cheeks flushed from exertion. With one hand still locked around Harry’s wrists securely, Harry felt Malfoy drag his free hand down his chest. Malfoy wasted no time in rubbing a teasing hand over the bulge in Harry’s jeans and the brunet was unable to stop himself as he bucked hard against Malfoy’s flippant hand.
Potter is fucking.”
“Of course, my lord,” she replied. The scrape of her chair echoed in the abruptly tense air, her fading footsteps sending shivers down the blond’s spine as she left the room.
Something fluttered onto the desk. Glancing down, Draco’s brow creased a little at the sight of a neatly folded piece of parchment. He threw a shrewd glance to the female sitting resolutely motionless at his side before he reached for it, his long pale fingers enclosing around the parchment and pulling it towards him, unfurling it surreptitiously.
“Draco! Watch what you are doing,” Pansy hissed. “Your roots are abysmal.”
“Please?”
Draco’s hand fluttered to his chest. “Granger, my Saviour.”
“Sorry,” he muttered.
“Should I come?” Hermione asked, watching him get to his feet.
, he was quick to shove aside his shock and reach for his mate, deepening the kiss with a passion he’d kept subdued for too long.
Hermione couldn’t help but stare at the brunet in mild surprise. “Harry,” she began, “when are you going to let this infatuation with Malfoy go?”
Satisfied that this boy seemed pretty down to earth and genuine, Harry decided to respond to the message through the other male’s Ask Box. His fingers hesitated over the keyboard all the same, slightly nervous in how to reply. He didn’t want to sound like a desperate moron but he wasn’t all that good in sounding normal either.
Hermione turned at the clangs of pots and pans, smothering a sigh.
Hermione glanced up at her friend, surprised to see him gazing at her inquisitively. She frowned. “What’s wrong?”
His hand fumbled with the doorknob, trembling fingers wrapping around the cool metal and twisting. Before Harry could leave however, he felt himself being spun around, his back shoved against the wood of the door as cool, hard grey eyes bored down at him. He stared meekly in response, unable to read the expressionless mask on Malfoy’s face as his heart thudded painfully in his chest. The blond’s hands were gripping his shoulders, forcibly holding him order to prevent Harry from fleeing. And, oh god, Harry so much wanted to run. After everything that had happened between them, he knew it was going to break his heart to have the blond be disgusted in his actions. But how could Harry blame him? Draco had every right to detest him…
you want, Harry?” Hermione’s voice was soft and full of thoughtful understanding.
“Patience, my love.” Draco dragged his tongue languidly along a distended vein of his lover’s erection, enjoying the way Harry was so malleable in his hands. “I promised I would take care of you.” Swallowing Harry entirely once more, Draco relished in the sounds his beloved Gryffindor made. Every gasp made his cock jerk, every whimper made his heart clench, and every moan set his blood on fire, his yearning for his mate stronger now than it had ever been. He opened his throat, needing his mate deeper within him, wanting to feel Harry as much as he could. He swallowed, the walls of his throat massaging his mate’s pulsing cock, his tongue sliding along the base of the thick erection.
Spying the large doors that lead outside, Harry switched Christmas carols, digging his hands into his pockets as he nudged the door closed behind him with his foot. Snow crunched beneath his boots as he sauntered towards the stairs, eyes scanning the white mass before him.
A sigh seeped out of the blond. “I’ve decided emotions are frustrating,” he replied, “and since I’ve never really be in this position before, I needed a moment to just… sulk.”
“I’ve only fed from Harry once before,” he murmured, keeping his gaze on the brunet’s face. “And I… frightened him. It was entirely my fault—I acted selfishly and on impulse, not realising how potent a blood-mate’s scent could be. Of course, he stayed away from me then, as I assumed he would.” He returned his stare the matron. “I did not feed for four weeks,” he announced, idly observing the way Madam Pomfrey’s eyes widened in astonishment. “I attempted to feed from Pansy but of course, since I had already initiated the bond with Harry, I was unable to take from her vein. Instead I waited, hoping for Harry’s forgiveness. When he continued to avoid me, I tracked him down, assuming I could just take from him regardless. But he was so scared, so frightened of
Movement roused Draco from his slight doze as students milled around for potion supplies. He sniffed miserably, wiped his nose with yet another tissue and got to his feet unsteadily, following Pansy to the supply cupboard. He watched the dark haired Slytherin fetch whatever it was they needed as he leant against the wall, wrapped his robes around him tightly as he shivered.
The brunette eyed the vampire critically. “I can’t exactly see Harry jumping to that conclusion based on a normal argument between the two of you. Therefore, you can imagine my surprise when he mentioned your name and ‘friends’ in the same sentence. What happened to you staying away from him?”
Malfoy suddenly stiffened, his eyes widening ever so slightly. Something on the blond’s face sent Harry’s mind whirling into motion, recognition dawning on his face as memories of his supposed dream flooded back. “That night…” he began.
“Shh, it’s alright,” Hermione murmured, stroking her fingers through his hair. “Ron’s gone to find Madam Pomfrey. I’m sure she’ll help you.”
Harry frowned. “What has Pansy been telling you?” he asked suspiciously.
“You were just lucky.”
The castle was blissfully quiet as Harry walked down the empty corridor. His mind was buzzing tiredly, thoughts of a warm shower and his soft bed the only thing circling his consciousness. The familiar swish of robes made Harry frown and he looked up, expecting to see another student or perhaps a teacher nearby. An empty corridor greeted his gaze. With a shake of his head, Harry shrugged offhandedly.
“Don’t tell me you’ve forgotten how you
Pansy opened the laptop lid and pulled out her wand, reciting the spell that had been in her booklet. The little green light flashed on beside the power button and Draco nodded, telling her it was fine to switch on. She did so, flinching back slightly in case it tried to blind her again.
“My intellect and good looks obviously.”
Draco chuckled. “At least I could tell Pansy I tried.” Feeling bolder than he actually was, Draco moved gracefully across the carpet, settling himself beside the slightly startled brunet and leaning back against the couch.
“Do you mind if we squeeze some homework in before he arrives? I just have a question to finish for Professor Snape that’s giving me some trouble,” Pansy asked.
“I put one of my socks in there before giving it back to him. He of course handed it to Dobby so technically your father gave him clothes.”
“Of course the bet is still on,” he murmured, proud at how controlled his voice sounded to his ears. “I was simply weighing the pros and cons of this arrangement. Of course, there is nothing but a positive outlook for me since I will
“They’re going to find you as well, you know,” Harry warned. “You’ll have ickle first years liking and commenting on
Surprisingly, a flicker of arousal erupted in Harry’s core, shocking the brunet at the way his body was responding. He barely felt his bag slip from his shoulder and thud to the floor as a sudden heat enveloped him.
The elegant blond carefully brushed down his sweater. “First of all, Potter,” Malfoy began smoothly, “Malfoys do not ‘freak out’. Secondly, and I will be honest, I was not entirely prepared for your confession despite how many times Pansy’s told me otherwise.”
“I know there’s something you’re not telling me,” Ron continued calmly, breaking Harry’s thoughts and squeezing his shoulder again. “But promise me you’ll seriously think about this, yeah?”
Flicking his wand, the Dark Lord stared impassively down at the trembling blond, watching in mild disgust as his follower attempted to right himself. Falling back into his kneeling position, Lucius tried hard to hide his pain from his facial expressions as he waited for his lord to speak.
“That was a very brave thing you did,” Hermione said then, observing the blond carefully.
“I’ll come by around eight,” Harry concluded, buckling his bag closed.
All the tension seemed to seep out of the blond, his eyes softening slightly. Then a familiar sneer began to curl at his lips.
Two hours and three floors later, Draco could feel his curiosity peaking. The castle seemed to hide an abundance of secrets, but nothing more elusive than the ever evasive comments both Percy and Ron gave whenever something was linked to Potter, especially when it came to his chosen area of seclusion.
“Oh for the love of…” Hermione sniffed and folded her arms. “Whatever, I’ll see you guys at lunch.” She grabbed her bag and marched out of the classroom leaving the two males behind.
The shimmer from his last charm settled smoothly over his skin, the evidence of the spell disappearing as it made contact. Satisfied that he would not receive third degree burns that morning, Draco picked up his bag, double checked his appearance in the mirror one last time, and left his room.
“Leaving so soon, Potter?”
Hermione blinked. “What do you mean?” she asked, looking up at him.
Hermione giggled, grinning at the brunet across from her. “So, Harry, how does it feel to be friends with a Lion-turned-Snake?”
Ron, Hermione, and Percy all flinched as Harry stomped passed them. They stared after him miserably, knowing that their chances of breaking the curse had diminished rapidly.
“I’ve already spoken to Granger.” Pansy leant against the doorframe as she spoke. “She told me she was going to try and coerce Potter to sit closer to the front. That way we’ll be able to keep an eye on where he is within the classroom—especially when it’s time to collect potion ingredients.”
Harry growled in frustration and waved an impatient hand in Ron’s direction. “Obviously you weren’t paying attention,” he said grouchily.
Harry was deeply asleep, face buried into his pillow and duvet to his chin. Hermione lowered her wand, casting the light over the brunet to see if anything was out of the ordinary. Other than seeming a little pale, there were no signs of any marks of any kind on his skin which relieved Hermione to no end.
He hummed blearily in contentment.
“Yes, that’s exactly right,” Draco replied absentmindedly.
Potter smiled. “Pansy, relax, okay? I’m sure at the first sign of trouble you’ll be the first to know. Fortunately for Draco and myself, we aren’t too worried about defining what we have. If it develops it develops. If it doesn’t, it doesn’t, no harm done.”

Draco scoffed. “And why would I
“Mmm?” Malfoy’s eyes were now focused on his lips.
The door to his room suddenly flew open and Pansy marched confidently inside.
“And if I do?” Ron said defensively, crossing his arms.
Comments are love!! :D <3
Harry looked up in surprise. “Um, okay?”
“I know you’d probably rather be in bed—you look like hell.”
the summer.”
“Will you just
Slowly, the anger surging through Draco ebbed away. He too, released a deep sigh and he reached out, pulling Pansy into a quick embrace. He should have known Pansy would be on his case. It had been rather stupid of him to try and pretend his best friend would not notice he had not been drinking from her.
Harry smiled gently. “Of course not.”
“Careful, Harry, that’d have to be a miracle,” he half sulked.
“And your analysis?” Harry prompted.
“Yes,” he sighed, glancing away. “Yes, as much as I hated myself at the time to even
“Yes,” Harry said with a smile. “He really is.”
Malfoy tossed his head back and laughed. Harry stared at the graceful curve of his neck, suddenly ravenous to be able to taste the soft, pale skin.
“He doesn’t hate Neville, does he? And Neville likes men as well,” Hermione pointed out.
“Alright, alright,” Ron replied, waving a flippant hand. “I’ll end up searching the internet way,” he muttered to Harry.
Harry did so, the denim hitting the floor within half a second. He returned to Malfoy’s mouth instantly, delighting in the way the blond undulated beneath him. It didn’t take long before both young men were hard and their hearts were thundering in their chests. Harry mumbled a breathless spell and reached down, taking Malfoy’s now slick hardened length into his hand. Malfoy gasped a strangled moan, his head thrown back against the pillows. With Malfoy’s throat exposed, Harry leant down and ran his tongue along a particularly strained muscle. He followed with his teeth, satisfied with the red marks he left behind.
idea, Hermione, truly tops.” He shook his head in disgust. “I get that there was probably still no need to really spill the beans since Malfoy wanted nothing to do with me, but the thing is Hermione, he
“I know, I’m trying to avoid my answer.”
“No need to be
Draco returned his gaze to hers. Pansy quirked an unimpressed eyebrow.
Harry was sure he made a noise, partway between a sigh and a strangled moan, and then he was lost, falling into the searing heat of Draco’s mouth. It was hard, brutal, and hot as fuck; Draco’s mouth seemed to completely dominate his and Harry was quite content to let him. His hands came to rest instinctively on Malfoy’s shifting back muscles, fingers digging in sync each time the blond sucked on his tongue.
Potter rubbed the back of his neck, the confusion fading from his brow. Draco watched as the tension slowly eased from the young man’s shoulders and his eye began to brighten.
“June fifth.”
“P-Professor McGonagall wants to see you.”
“Well come on then,” she huffed. “We don’t have all day!”
Ron’s smile grew sad then. “That is if she even likes me in that way.”
“Knowing Malfoy it was probably something lethal,” Ron grumbled.
Draco sighed. “I’m being serious.”
He found himself falling into step behind his godfather, pleased that Severus was not one for small talk. It gave him the time he needed in order to readjust from the verbal lashing he’d just received from Hermione bloody Granger. By the time Snape and Draco had climbed the spiralling staircase and stopped before the beautiful double oak doors, the blond’s mental barriers were firmly in place, his face set in a composed mask.
Draco lent back in his chair. “A little while,” he replied.
Harry, who had been in the action of drinking from his goblet, unexpectedly spluttered, choking on his pumpkin juice as he turned to stare at his best friend.
He turned pained eyes in her direction. She stared back at him earnestly.
“Let’s hope so,” Ron smirked. “Now we just need to find a girl for you and we’ll be set!”
“B-But, Harry!” Ron spluttered.
As the waves of pleasure died to a simmer, Harry felt himself sag in Malfoy’s embrace, his head lolling back against his shoulder, Draco’s strong arms the only thing keeping him standing. He barely felt the male behind him fixing him up, casting cleaning spells. Harry’s mind was dull, thoughts barely coherent.
The blond inhaled deeply, his fingers stilling on Harry’s skin as he lifted his head. Gazing up at the male lying so tantalising beneath him, Draco opened his mouth, an invitation to stay the night on his lips when the brunet beat him to it.
“Yeah,” Harry smiled gently. “Helping people would make me feel a lot better than hunting them.”
“Time certainly flies when you’re making out with the Boy Who Lived,” Malfoy commented in amusement.
“Fuck… me…” Draco breathed.
The house elves had obviously forgotten that only five students had remained in the school judging by the amount of food now sitting on their table. It was another shock to discover that both his and Potter’s goblets had been filled with an appetising wine rather than the usual pumpkin juice.
A fire was burning merrily in the grate, warming the small room where a candelabra argued tiredly with a pacing red clock.
“But Ron snores.”
Draco flipped back to Potter’s Tumblr page, refreshing the link to see if the raven haired young man had added anything else. Interest flared when Draco saw the new additions—
the Gryffindor after something like this.
A snort escaped the dark-haired Gryffindor. “God, you’re not even going to
Not at all.
“Excuse me?” she replied, eyebrows raised.
“Fall for Voldemort?
Hermione gazed at his screen, rolling her eyes at the many friend requests he now had on his Facebook. “Oh please, Harry, it could be worse.”
“I bet you get recognised
Draco could have leapt across the table at this announcement. Here his mate was, actively seeking
“Get out!” Another surge of power. Another piece of furniture reduced to cinders. “
“Young sir, please wait!”
The dark haired man nodded absentmindedly, eyes still glued to the screen.
Draco thought with a frown.
“Look, Malfoy, just… don’t.” Potter’s voice had suddenly become forlorn as he suddenly interrupted the blond. “I can’t… do this right now...” He turned away once more, stepping down the corridor.
He expelled another impatient but good-natured sigh. “Can I open them?”
“I would have come to keep you company at home,” Pansy sulked. “I won’t be able to see you until we get back!”
about you and Potter. There’s something there that intrigues you—why don’t you find out what that is?”
“Thank god,” Hermione said, placing her head in her hands. “I really didn’t want to believe that Malfoy had messed with Harry on purpose. I mean… look at what we saw this morning, Ron. I’ve never seen Malfoy look so angry before and to actually
Draco choked on his laughter, earning himself a sneer from Pansy as she got to her feet. “I’ll take that as a sign that you do not wish for my assistance then,” she said with a derisive sniff. “If you’re not careful I’ll find someone else to hook Harry up with.”
The blond sucked in a shaking breath. If Draco had thought Potter’s natural scent was tantalising, it was
“When you run out of downloads—so when your internet stops working—you’ll need to go and buy some more,” Draco finished. “Most of the devices are reasonably priced; some are more expensive than others though. I use a turbo one which provides me with faster internet but I paid more for it.”
Hermione glanced over and smiled, noticing Harry still in the corner. “It’s nice to see you down here, Harry, instead of locking yourself away in your room.”
She thought wryly, returning to her homework.
“Fine.”
Harry smiled gently, glancing over at the blond.
“Does Malfoy look different to you?” he found himself asking, keeping his voice low.
Draco’s words were slightly muffled as he replied through the stone. “I’m not hungry.”
Harry shook his head. “Not yet. Was going to go to the library after Charms.”
“My poor Gryffindor heart was too nice for the snake den.”
The brunet looked up.
Malfoy’s eyebrows rose. “Yes I thought we both agreed we didn’t hate each other anymore.”
Malfoy looked momentarily unsettled before his face returned to its placid generic mask. “I was in denial for a lot longer,” he admitted calmly.
“Would you like to change that?” he asked smoothly.
So Potter didn’t like sharing the Tumblr secret either? This meant that the Weasel and the Mudblood wouldn’t suspect anything, not even if Draco were to proceed with his plan. He’d have the true Harry Potter all to himself.
The reflective surface instantly began to ripple, faint, fuzzy images flowing before him until the picture solidified, revealing Draco sitting on the leather couch in the Slytherin common room, Fred and George beside him.
“Excuse me?”
him, Mione. Ask Ron! He was there.”
at me like that, mate, you’re making me nervous.”
Draco’s jaw clenched and he sat back in his chair. Controlling his emotions had been much harder since his change—he found himself reacting fervently and much more abruptly than when he had been human. Hermione gazed at him knowingly, her eyes unnervingly full of understanding.
“More books than you’ll ever be able to read in a lifetime!” Ron continued, hopping down the stairs and catching up with his brother.
“I was going to go for a walk,” Harry replied, eyes tracking falling snowflakes. He turned his gaze back to the blond. “Would you like to join me?”
“Thank you, Khari.” Harry placed an abundance of coins into the bartender’s hand and took their drinks, passing one to Eli.
Harry was
is what you’ll do.”
“A little more than a week ago,” he murmured.
“Can I be extremely selfish and say that I’m glad you aren’t?”
“…to hopefully find someone a little more long term,” Harry confirmed with a nod.
Pansy sighed internally but nodded. “Keep an open mind, its second nature for Draco to be defensive.”
, considering the shit her best friend had put her through these past few months it was more than expected to be as worried as she was. Especially since this entire situation with
Turning his head, Harry gazed through the frosty window. It was a clear night and the stars sparkled soothingly across the vast darkness. Staring at the twinkling lights, Harry mused. He supposed he should forgive Draco… if his yearning to be intimate with the Slytherin was anything to go by. That wasn’t to say he was going to let the blond off easy, however. If Draco was genuine about fixing what they had once had, he was going to have to work for it.
“You think Harry is messing with you?” Pansy frowned worryingly.
Folding his arms, Draco leant back in his chair with a pout. “I’m nob being selfith.”
His voice faltered.
“Oh god,” he choked. “Draco, more.”
OKAY WOW I'm really REALLY sorry that this took me so long to upload. Life was so hectic (Uni stuff of course) and then I was hit with the BIGGEST writer's block I have ever had. I actually wrote a large chunk of this chapter tonight as I was surprisingly and luckily enough to be hit with inspiration :D
Harry mused, heading back to his bed. Their Professor had given them the option of either writing or typing the answers to the questions given and considering how much faster and neater typing was, Harry was all for that option.
Cool, calculating grey eyes watched every movement a particular dark-haired Gryffindor made. Potter, at this point in time, was biting his lip, staring down at a roll of parchment resting on the desk before him. He was alone for the meantime; Weasley had disappeared within the rows of books in search for study material only moments before.
and the blond returned his wand back to the bedside table before turning his smouldering gaze back to the brunet below him.
“Listen, Harry… I’m not very good at apologies but I’ll do my best. I’m sorry that I didn’t tell you. It wasn’t because I was trying to mess with you, I swear. Well, I was at first—but that was before Christmas… before I got to know you properly. I was genuinely surprised to discover that you truly weren’t who I expected you to be. The closer we became the more frightened I was of admitting it to you. Please don’t think that our time together has been a lie.”
“Sure why not?” Harry shrugged. “I understand if you don’t want to though… it must be hard trying to compete with the Boy-Who-Lived.”
out, and making plans just for the two of them.
“Marvellous. Perhaps now we can have a proper conversation.”
“You draw?” Draco asked, making sure his face revealed the appropriate amount of surprise.
“Who are you? What are you doing here?” the shadow snarled, green eyes staring malignantly.
But what was he meant to say in response? Draco had never been the type to be forward, especially with his feelings. He did not have the nerve to admit to Potter who it was he desired… not until all uncertainty had been cleared between them. His fear of being ridiculed was evidently still controlling his emotions, despite his head demanding otherwise.
“Gryffindors really are no fun,” Pansy moped.
Sharing a look with Pansy, who seemed rather smug at that moment, Harry followed the others through the castle to the library. The four of them settled themselves down at a hidden desk, the two females placing themselves in such a way that forced Malfoy and Harry to sit facing one another. Noticing this immediately, the blond rolled his eyes, bumping not so inconspicuously into Pansy on his way passed.
Harry slumped in his grasp. “I know,” he murmured to the floor.
wants me to feel?”
Hermione blinked innocently. “I don’t know what you mean, Ronald,” she replied. “Ooh, speaking of which I need to get to the library.”
That thought had Harry snorting a laugh. Distracted by that image, he barely had time to acknowledge the way his name was hissed as he passed a particularly shadowed alcove. A pair of arms suddenly shot out of the darkness, wrapping themselves around Harry’s waist and pulling him into the shadows. His exhausted mind was only just catching up to this fact when he felt his back press up against something warm, the arms twisting themselves around his figure and holding him tightly.
. I think I have for a while now.”
He rolled out of bed, swaying unsteadily for a minute before stumbling for the bathroom. He made his way slowly to the sink so he was able to splash some water onto his overly hot face. Gripping the porcelain tightly, Harry clenched his eyes shut as he lowered his head, focusing on his breathing. His stomach swirled unpleasantly and his suppressed his lips into a taut line.
Draco smiled. “It doesn’t matter how you bait me, Potter, I will not concede.”
Harry nodded.
“I see you’ve met my albino Burmese python.”
“Just trying to prolong the inevitable,” Harry replied with a small grin, dropping into his seat beside him.
“Yeah.”
“You’ll forgive me if I don’t jump for joy, Granger. I didn’t, after all, exactly
“Your robe is inside out, mate,” Harry pointed out with a grin.
“Hey!”
Harry stifled a groan. That had been only a
—studying.” The blond got to his feet, took Potter’s bag strap into his hand and tugged it off his shoulder, allowing the bag to flop to the floor. “You. Me. Shower.
“They’ve found me.”
“What is it, Ron?”
“I promised Ron we’d start our Charms homework together,” the Gryffindor replied, hurriedly shoving his laptop and books into his bag. He paused briefly. “I’ll see you tonight?”
Harry observed Malfoy carefully. “Does it feel strange to you?”
Draco frowned. “… Burn it, obviously,” he answered after a short hesitation.
The Slytherin frowned. The Gryffindor’s smile widened.
Must. Do. Homework.
“What made you stay here for Christmas, Potter?” Draco asked casually, his finger tracing the rim of his glass. Potter’s eyes followed the movement for half a second before his gaze shifted to the blond’s.
“Did Malfoy happen to tell you who he is feeding from?” Ron asked.
—and he found himself craving more of Draco’s touch.
shouldn’t have been in the Gryffindor tower!”
“Put him on the bed,” she ordered, lifting her wand and flicking her wrist. Immediately, two identical vials came zooming out of her office and into her free hand. Draco didn’t have to look at them to know what they were.
“I will contain my excitement,” Potter said tonelessly, glancing around for his shoes. He pulled out his wand and summoned them, his sneakers appearing half a second later.
… Harry could virtually feel himself drowning in it.
Harry stared at his best friend. “Ron, why are you trying to fix this? You
Harry snorted. “So instead of perhaps warning me then, you decided to let it play out and see how it went. Yeah,
“You might be expelled yet,” Harry replied nastily, summoning their wands with a silent spell. “Both of you will come with me.” He turned to face Draco whose face looked even paler than before. “You should probably come as well, Malfoy, I’m sure Professor Dumbledore will want to hear what you have to say.”
He thought, entering the grounds.
“What? What is it?”
“My lord, I—I don’t know what to say,” Draco uttered, stepped away from the table. He tried desperately to put space between him and the Dark Lord, his eyes sweeping the hall somewhat desperately for a means of escape.
“What do you rather?” Potter asked as he sat on Draco’s bed, leaning back against the pillows.
Feeling unexpectedly drained, Draco allowed a sigh to slip passed his lips. “Your point, Granger?” he pressed.
“Actually, that’s something I wanted to ask
After casting a cleansing charm to be rid of any germs she may have gained whilst with her best friend, Pansy started off for the library with her laptop. Although most of her homework was in fact completed, the library at the moment was probably the safest place in regards to health and she had no plans on getting ill any time soon.
“Stop stalling, Potter.”
I wouldn’t have run away!”
“Ronald!” Hermione had scolded. “Have you no humanity?”
“Saves girls the heartbreak you know? They can get over it now so they don’t have to hope.”
Draco thought absentmindedly, eyes drifting over the bored brunet. Eyes slightly glazed and nose beginning to drip, Draco returned his gaze and blinked sleepily at his Head of House, finding that hardly any of the words spoken were actually sinking into his brain. Beside him, Pansy glanced worriedly at her best friend, noticing just how flushed his cheeks were becoming. She wondered if it were best to ask Snape to tell Draco to leave and go to bed.
“Good morning,” she began, “what can I get for you today?”
Malfoy’s sleep induced voice caressed over Harry’s ears and the brunet glanced over his shoulder, catching the Slytherin’s drowsy stare.
“Look, I’m going to be honest,” the red-head began, closing the door behind him. “I know that something happened between you and Malfoy.”
“It’s not that,” Harry said, turning so he was facing the Slytherin. “I just—I guess I still wonder why it is you want
“Pansy, for the last time, leave me
Harry placed a hand over his heart. “I don’t know what to say,” he teased.
those people tell you,” Hermione said strongly. “Liking the same sex is
“They didn’t invite you along?” Draco frowned.
Glancing in annoyance across the Great Hall, the blond noted the way the brunet had placed himself with his back to the Slytherin table, giving him the perfect excuse not to meet Draco’s gaze. It was such a small thing but Draco knew that Harry had positioned himself in such a manner on purpose. Perhaps he thought Draco wouldn’t notice—yet how could Draco not when he had become so accustomed to staring across the hall at the familiar pair of green eyes for the past seven years?
The evident pull of his lust for the ebony-haired male was proving too hard to ignore. Instead, it appeared that it was time to stop fighting against the inevitable and accept what his new body desired.
can I open them?” he asked.
“Same for me, thank you, Khari.”
Draco smirked, “I’ve done pretty well so far.” He watched as Potter’s eyes narrowed and he chuckled indulgently. “I managed to hook you in without working up a sweat didn’t I?”
Understanding the hidden message, Hermione nodded. She threw a quick look over her shoulder, telling the boys to continue to class without her. Ron’s eyes narrowed only slightly but he nodded, gripping Harry’s arm and tugging the male away. Pansy had to keep her face carefully blank when Potter stared at her for a moment, his brow furrowed slightly before he allowed the Weasel to direct him up the stairs. Once the two male Gryffindors were out of sight, Pansy quirked her head to the side, indicating to Granger to follow. Hermione did so without question, already suspicious of what it was the Slytherin had to tell her. She followed Pansy to an empty classroom, waiting patiently until the door was locked and warded before speaking.
Pulling his blankets up and over his head, Harry lay with his eyes shut and a miserable pout tugging at his lips. He always hated feeling ill; he’d never had anyone to take care of him whenever he was. The Dursleys never seemed to care and although he was sure Hermione and Ron would attempt to make him feel better, there was really nothing they could do but pat him on the shoulder.
“Draco,” Pansy interrupted, “have you considered the reason at all as to
“Mione? Everything alright?”
“Hermione!” Harry grumbled.
The breeze was warm against Harry’s skin, the sun bright overhead. It was a gorgeous Saturday afternoon and Harry, Ron, and Hermione were all lounging outside beside a large tree. They weren’t the only students out enjoying the sun either, many from different houses sat in various spots on the grass, stretching all the way back up to the castle.
So he nodded his agreement. “I understand,” he replied, noting the relief that passed over Potter’s face. “I’ll tell Pansy to back off.”
The red head smiled. “Have a good Christmas, mate?”
A quiet voice prevented Malfoy from replying but from the cheeky glint in his silver eyes, Harry was pretty sure he knew what it would have been.
Harry’s fingers flew across the keyboard.
Draco could barely feel his legs as he back away, eyes glued to the malevolent figure before him. “I’m sorry, I—”
“It’ll be easier to show you once we have them,” Dean explained to Neville and Ginny. “But you’ll pick up on how to use them fairly easy, especially if you’re using them just for their basic tools.”
The printers had been set up near Madam Pince’s desk so she was able to keep a close eye on what exactly the students were printing. With a nod to both Harry and Hermione, Madam Pince left them to do as they needed and the two Gryffindors spent the next few minutes connecting their laptops and transferring the pictures over.
“You mean all those years were just an act? I’m appalled!”
“I’ll try,” Harry said. “But my memory is pretty shocking.”
“You’re a bloody idiot, Draco,” Pansy continued then, her tone slightly softer now, “and you better fix this, so help me.”
So Harry wept, cursing himself over and over again for being so blind.
“Doesn’t change the fact that he said nothing about it,” Harry muttered bitterly.

The blond turned to his wife, unfurling the letter in his hand. He felt his stomach jolt.
his subconscious interrupted rudely.
“Tonight?”
“You know,” Ron continued, as if he hadn’t just caused the Boy-Who-Lived to choke on his drink, “Malfoy. Have you decided if you like him or not yet?”
“Why is my love life suddenly so interesting?” Harry asked, casually bypassing the question.
“Use backspace,” Harry said. “See the blinking line? If that’s in front of whatever you want to get rid of then press backspace. If it’s behind, press Delete.”
Drawing in a reassuring breath, Harry nodded. “Alright just bear with me, alright?” he began. “This starts out pretty crazy but sort of ends… nice?” He couldn’t help but wince at the incredulous look Ron was currently giving him. “Don’t
The grounds were so dark Draco could barely see where he was going. Fear pumped through him so viciously he was unable to slow down. Instead he ran blindly across the icy estate, hoping for a familiar sight to lead him to the front gates. His breath was coming out in desperate gasps and he turned with a frantic moan, hoping,

“My mother knows,” he answered finally, staring glumly at his half-eaten breakfast. “I will write them. Tell them to—to s-stay away.”
“Maybe if you put in the effect to get to know each other properly?”

possibly ignite this reaction within him?
The bathroom was filled with the rush of water, the taps on full bore as Draco splashed his face. He leant on the sink heavily, closing his eyes and swallowing tightly as his body trembled.
“My—my room?” Draco lowered his hands, glancing around the tower in confusion. “But, I thought—”
away.”
He had been so tired from running from this Potter issue. Looking back, Draco honestly could not remember why it was he had been so adamant about refusing the Gryffindor. Indeed, their past was nothing short of frustrating and insult-filled, however beneath the excessive amount of denial that Draco had managed to accumulate over the past seven years, there was the underlying desire that had driven him to achieve Potter’s attention. And for something as pitiful as standard hatred for one another… it was amazing to see how often the two of them pursued each other rather than disregard each other’s existence.
Harry tore his gaze away and ran a slightly trembling hand through his hair, praying to whichever god was listening that nothing obvious was showing. He shifted slightly, reaching for the bottle of Firewhiskey to assist his sudden influx of nerves.
“See that you don’t.” The Dark Lord gaze at the older Malfoy, unable to prevent the indulgent smile that appeared on his face. “Your son has made quite an impression on me, Lucius. I believe he will make a fine addition to my… cause.”
Draco Malfoy.
“Draco?” he croaked.

Draco’s gaze flickered over to the expectant Gryffindor who sat opposite him. He casually lowered the lid of his laptop and sat up straighter in his chair.

“What?!” Ron roared, snatching the parchment from Harry’s hands. “No
Ginny and Potter continued their conversation throughout the meal, the small teacup occasionally admonishing the brunet on his eating mannerisms. It was awkward for Potter to eat with his non-dominant hand since his right was still wrapped in bandages and set in a sling, and Draco expected Potter to lose patience with her, to snap and growl and remind him exactly the type of person Potter had grown to become. It was with a relieved sense of happiness however that Draco observed nothing of the sort.
“Think of it this way: how are you going to know whether or not you still feel the same way about Draco if you’re nowhere near him?”
Ron sighed. “Mate…”
“I suppose so,” Harry replied, tonelessly. He’d hoped to avoid this. He was tired from studying so late with Pansy and as soon as he’d seen the blond in the hallway before him he’d turned away, hoping to escape before he was seen. Frustratingly his plan had failed.
don’t
“Depends on the stuff.”
Potter’s uncontrolled moan sent lust coursing through Draco’s already pulsing body. When the Gryffindor was finally done unbuttoning his shirt, he shrugged out of the material and tossed it carelessly aside, desperate to get the pleasure train moving along. He pushed Potter back against the bedspread, keeping their mouths connected all the while.
Ignoring him, Pansy turned her gaze to the brunet. “We need to get ourselves organised into a substantial study schedule again,” she said as she lifted a hand to observe her nails.
“Just… enough, alright?”
one—but don’t we all? I mean you’ve forgiven me quite a few times… it seems only fair you should forgive your—ugh dare I say it—
“Not that I can recall,” she said, tilting her head to peer up at the sky. “Of course all of my plans were ruined when Draco figured out he was gay.”
A sleepy smile tugged at Harry’s lips. “Then we’re all good.”
“What’s your favourite subject?” Harry asked instead.
his subconscious stated bossily.
“Draco, listen,” Pansy frowned. “Granger isn’t known for her amazing sense of humour and it was obvious she was being serious. I really, really think Potter likes you.”
The brunet glared. “Why are you not concerned about this?”
Hermione hummed in agreement. “In Harry’s case, anything Malfoy-related is definitely worth the note taking.” She smirked at the Slytherin. “This is going to be a
“Ready?” he murmured huskily.
It was driving Draco into a frenzy.
Draco’s subconscious chimed in.
“He has,” Harry interrupted quietly, staring at the floor. He sensed Ron go still.
The chemistry between them was
“It’s not about that,” Harry replied quietly. “I should have known what we had was impossible. I should have known it wasn’t real…”
“Anything interesting on the internet, Draco?” Pansy asked from her position further down Draco’s bed. Her laptop, which she had gone and gotten from her room, was lying open before her.
“She probably got held up by Parvati and Lavender, or even some of the first years.” Harry shrugged as he opened the internet browser. “I’ll show you how to search for different things later.” His fingers danced expertly across the keyboard, fascinating Ron to no end.
Unable to help herself, Hermione smiled. “You’re welcome, Malfoy.” Her smile widened. “I couldn’t pass up the opportunity of having you in my debt now, could I?”
?” Draco sneered. He had become exceedingly uncomfortable while Granger had been speaking—she was hitting a little too close to home.
Ron smiled softly. “Yeah it’s been pretty boring without you guys.”
“Can you show me how it works?” Ron asked. “Does it open or something?”
“And be a snake? No, I don’t think so.” Malfoy traced patterns on his thigh with a finger, eyes distant as he considered each animal. “I’d want to be something powerful and yet elegant.”
Harry could only shake his head, throat burning with unshed sobs. He turned away from the female and made his way to the door. Hermione jerked forwards to stop him.
Hermione glared at him. “You wanted my help and I am giving it. Some respect in return would be nice, Malfoy.”
“What the fuck’s
“How were your holidays?” she asked as she pulled away, a knowing glint in her eye.
“Did you want to leave it for today?”
“I’m going to go study with Potter and Granger, do you want to join us?”
And did a double-take. Despite the shadows that cloaked the room in a welcoming allure of mystery, it certainly did not hide the unique shine of platinum hair that instantly captured Harry’s attention.

“Yeah sure, I’m not fussed.” Harry smiled. “Anything will do.”
“Snape did what?”
“A social net-what?”
“Malfoy,” he called, “do you have a minute?”
“Never mind, Ronald, I’ll show you this evening.” Hermione shook her head. “Hey,” she frowned, “I’ve just realised, if the Ministry is making wizarding websites, won’t muggles stumble across them while they’re on the web?”
“Not everyone can be as understanding,” Harry replied. “Sometimes people need time.”
Ron glared. “Shove off, Malfoy,” he spat in reply.
The brunette looked up from her untouched plate. She nodded immediately. “At least we’ll know then if he’s alright.”
Harry stared at the red-head as he shouldered his broom. “Have you both gone insane?”
“Exactly.”
Ron gave a flaming salute. “You can count on me, Perce!”
Draco’s face relaxed into a smile. “I apologise. Would you like it if I stopped?”
… a voice in Draco’s head growled.
The amusement immediately drained away and Draco scrambled for some semblance of bravery. He drew in a silent breath.
Draco could only stare.
“Pretty good actually,” Ron admitted. “I sometimes forget that I don’t get to spend a lot of time with my parents considering we’re at school for most of the year; it was nice just being with them you know?”
“Apparently,” Pansy pouted. “So cut it out!”
” Ron gasped excitedly.
“But being stinky and gross definitely is.”
“There are more important aspects this year,” Draco drawled. “My education for one. Unlike you, I intend to excel in my N.E.W.Ts.”
Most of the class had already seated themselves as Hermione, Ron, and Harry arrived to their lesson. They took seats towards the back thanks to Ron’s persuasion. Harry didn’t mind, he wasn’t really in the mood for note taking either. Instead, he pulled out his laptop and sketch book. Harry didn’t see why he couldn’t browse Tumblr and do some sketching whilst Binn’s droned on and on about the finances of Goblins.
Distracted as he was, Draco did not notice the small figure he brushed past on his escape. Wormtail peered after the blond with intrigue as he attempted to gauge what had occurred between the Dark Lord and the Malfoy heir. The small, quivering man glanced towards the large wooden doors, his curiosity pushing him to brave an audience with his master. Wormtail opened the door a crack and slipped inside, his gaze landing on the Dark Lord. A dark smile had appeared on Voldemort’s face, eyes gleaming with promise.
The Gryffindor shuffled nervously and unconsciously stepped away from the blond. “Well I’m a Gryffindor—I tend to believe what I’m… told,” he finished lamely.

Narcissa uttered a soft cry, her hand fluttering to her throat as she hurried to his side to read over his shoulder.
His breath caught as Potter suddenly looked up and caught his eye. Instead of the scowl that Draco was accustomed of seeing, Potter
“You’re welcome,” Draco replied. “Feel like joining me for a cheer up session in my bedroom? I wouldn’t want any doubts in your mind in regards to your sexuality.”
“For Merlin’s sake, Potter, knock it off,” Draco snapped, his anger getting the better of him.
As the waves of pleasure began to subside, Harry felt himself sag, Draco’s hands the only thing keeping him standing. He offered no resistance as his lover moved him, shifting his body until he was lying on the soft, pleasantly warm rug. He felt pleasantly sated, muscles flaccid as he opened his eyes to gaze at the male above him, a tender smile appearing on his lips. Seeing the smile, Draco leant down to kiss his mate sweetly, their lips brushing in gentle exchange.
Well this
happy,” Malfoy replied, placing the crown on his head. “This obviously looks better on me anyway.”
What he really needed was some advice about clothes. He had no idea where to start let alone what looked good or not. Who would be ask? There was no way in hell he’d ask Ron, the poor red-head’s fashion sense was just as bad as Harry’s.
. There Harry had been, craving Malfoy’s touch, giving in readily to the Slytherin’s advancements, unknowing of Malfoy’s true form.
Malfoy swallowed. Something, Harry had begun to notice, Draco did whenever he was nervous.
“Please,” Harry began huskily. “Please I didn’t realise...” He shook his head, trying desperately to find the correct words that would prevent Draco from leaving. “I love you, Draco, don’t go,”
“It’s about Potter.”
“Me? Oh, no, just coffee—thank you.”
That were cold.
“This was your plan all along wasn’t it?” Potter snickered.
“Harry! Harry, wait!” Ron cried, the three of them rushing after him.
“But, ‘Mione, I’m a growing boy.”
After one last longing look at his favourite book lying open on the table, Draco left the room and made his way downstairs. His legs took him automatically to the location of the west drawing room, something Draco was thankful for since his mind was elsewhere at that given moment. He’d been back for all of six hours and already he yearned for the comfort of his penthouse.
On Ron’s other side, Hermione leant forward with a frown. “Are you eating enough iron?” she questioned. “Excessive tiredness is a massive indication of anaemia. Granted, it’s not as common in males as it would be in females but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t happen. In addition, with the extra work you’ve been putting in this year, it will probably explain as to why—”
to happen, Draco?!”
Pansy shrugged her elegant shoulders. “Maybe you’re right. This entire thing couldn’t possibly be normal; perhaps you’re experiencing a strange thing called
He felt a hand pat him kindly on the back.
“Granger, you’re lucky I tolerate you,” Draco replied. “Why on earth would I want to befriend Potter?”
barista now, would it?” Hermione asked innocently.
Pain shot up his leg as Lucius’s shin made contact with something hard. He winced, barely holding back his grunt as he reached down to rub the tender area.
“No, I can’t say we did,” she agreed. “But staying back and not facing this problem face on is not going to help.” She released a small sigh, glancing to the blond. “It’s obvious Potter is avoiding Draco,” Pansy commented. “He keeps Weasley so tightly by his side they’re practically joined at the hip.” Without looking, the brunette could tell that Draco’s upper lip had begun to curl into a snarl. With a sigh she leant to the side, placing a soothing hand on his arm.
“I wouldn’t be so sure.” The female continued to smile at the brunet who was ferociously attempting to stutter excuses. “Generally speaking, most childish quarrels tend to simmer out as you get older and mature. Of course this isn’t the same for everyone, however since Malfoy has yet to go out of his way to shout insults straight to your face, I’d say he’s decided that fighting with you has grown tiresome. Malfoy has kept to himself since we returned and yet
Harry’s heart skipped a beat.
“I wondered what happened to that one,” Draco mused. “Father was hysterical for a month.” He glanced at the raven-haired-tiara-wearing young man beside him. “Father never did tell me what happened, how did you do it?”
Good god, he felt like a young school girl.
And with one final whispered plea into Harry’s mouth, he complied, coating his impatiently aching cock with the remainder of the lubricant on his hand. Then he was moving, kissing Draco sweetly, pushing himself against Draco’s entrance.
Harry, actually more than happy to do so, suddenly found himself frowning as his head quirked to look to the side. “Aren’t you here with Parkinson?” he asked.
“What’s your favourite colour?”
“Why don’t you tell him?” Harry asked instead.
and I can’t—not even the house elves can locate him…”
“In a moment,” Malfoy replied, placing his mug down in the alcove. “Remind me to get that on our way back in.”
“Probably surfing the internet,” Hermione replied, sitting back down beside her own laptop. “I have a feeling he’s discovered the more... interesting... side of the net.”
Harry chuckled and shook his head. “Sorry, Ron, but Malfoy is the one who does it for me at the moment.”
that affected him so severely?
Harry rolled his eyes. “Why am I not surprised,” he replied, signalling Khari. “What are you drinking?”
“I just need to grab my laptop,” Harry said as he got to his feet with his belongings. “Do you mind keeping this safe while I do?” He held out his parchment book and Hermione accepted it with a smile.
.” Percy cleared his throat and bowed. “Dinner… is served.”
“Of course not.” The red-head scowled. “You can be damned sure I’m going to have some words to the Ferret. Probably a hex or two while I’m at it.”
The sudden creak of a door broke their heated discussion.
Hermione sighed as she watched him leave, worrying her bottom lip with her teeth.
“What?” She pivoted in her chair to find Ron gazing at her.
There was a brief pause of silence.
“What the fuck is Potter doing here
“Glad to see you saved a space for me,” Harry commented, waiting beside the desk. He knew if he was to reach down and even attempt at moving something out of the way he’d have his hand slapped.
Harry sighed gently. “Yeah, me too.”
“Look, Malfoy…” Harry began.
“Until he gives me a reason not to, I’ll always worry,” Harry mumbled in reply, finally getting to his feet to go join Ron.
A strangled groan barely left Potter’s throat as the male felt new sensations rock his figure.
“Why? I know the type of person you are, Harry. I should have realised your feelings sooner rather than delude myself that you could possibly be alright with what I did,” the Slytherin explained patiently. “I can’t say I wouldn’t have done the same if I had been in your position.”
“Bloody hell you can type fast,” Ron said in amazement.
“Right on time,” Harry said, forcing a welcoming smile on his face.
Harry groaned, shaking his head. “Just you wait.” He sucked in a breath, lowering his hands. “Malfoy is a vampire.”
The brunette shrugged casually. “We decided to grow up,” she replied. “Parkinson apologised at the end of last year and asked if we could start fresh. I decided to put caution to the wind and give it a go. So far, she’s been true to her word and rather civil—it’s rather refreshing.”
“He’s attractive,” Harry replied. “I can appreciate that can’t I? It’s not like we’d ever date or anything—he’s too much of a prick.”
“No, thank you,” came Draco’s tenacious reply.
Just as the blond was about to give up and return to his own dashboard, his eyes fell upon Harry’s latest drawing, breath suddenly lost.
“So it doesn’t need my middle name?” Ron asked, biting his lip.
The blond chuckled. “And pay-back is
himself!”
There was an air of exhaustion around Malfoy as he watched the brunet. Slowly, he shook his head. “No, I have not always been a vampire. I was turned over the holidays.”
The conversation between the teacup and the Boy-Who-Lived was tuned out as Hermione came wheeling by on a tray laden with hot food. Draco eyed the meals appreciatively, offering a helping hand where he could. It was still hard to shake the awkward sensation he felt knowing that these implements had once been witches and wizards, regardless of how much they did not seem perturbed by the situation.
Draco snorted and left the two females, shaking his head in mild disgust.
Harry’s magic finally erupted, bits of stone exploding into bursts of dust as the torches that lined the corridor flared dangerously in a surge of vibrant flame. “You can’t stay in there forever!” he roared.
, Harry realised that it had been a while since he and his Tumblr friend had communicated.
Harry entered his room in a flurry of aggression. He stared unseeingly into the darkness, the fury surging through his veins too much to ignore. How
and the smile fell, his lips pressed together nervously, watching as Malfoy’s tall, graceful frame exited the hearth in a flash of green flames.
“Well… considering most of the school will probably be going down there, I thought it would give us a good chance to talk without being gawked at,” Harry said with a grin, biting into his stolen toast triangle.
At the thought of his father, Draco felt the small joy that had been slowly growing within him diminish. His father… his
Draco groaned as his subconscious finally made an appearance. For the past hour the blond had been lying on his bed staring at the ceiling. When Draco had been unable to explain himself, or even make a sound, the brunet had gotten to his feet and left the room, leaving the Slytherin in a silence that was all too loud.
Draco stared at the candelabra incredulously. “If
“Typical Gryffindor,” Malfoy smirked. “I haven’t really given it much thought to be honest.”
would make a very interesting story.”
“Yes, anywhere but here,” Draco said. “Shall we?”
Percy glared after them as Draco made his way to the table, taking a seat and looking about in amazement.
Harry thought, shaking his head minutely.
The blond shrugged, fiddling with his bag strap. “I’m content with how we are.”
Pansy rubbed her eyes. “Draco…”
wanted to hide in
Draco jumped, his heart thumping wildly in his chest. Pansy smirked as she slid in the seat opposite her friend, staring at him intently.
“So a tactic, hmm?” Harry inquired, eyeing the blond over the rim of his whiskey tumbler.
Although Harry hadn’t elaborated on that particular subject, it had felt good to share something with Malfoy and not be ridiculed for it.
“I want you to be
“Already hab,” Draco whined. “Please, Pansy, I just wan to sleeb.”
“Do you know her favourite foods?” Harry asked.
Ronald.”
” She pointed an accusatory finger in his face. “Potter is your mate and he deserves better than this. He deserves the truth.”
“It’s not difficult to understand,” Draco began. “I’m surprised I’m the only smart Slytherin.”
. And it was
Draco stilled. “Mine?”
Pansy’s lips curled. “You can’t admit you might be falling for Potter and then immediately deny it.”
“And yet here you are.”
Draco’s head snapped up quickly, a look of surprised anger on his face. “It is not me you should be worried about,” he stated irritably.
“You don’t think something happened between him and Malfoy do you?” he asked quietly.
The blond lowered his cutlery. His eyebrows pulled together, creasing his brow as he gazed at Potter expectantly.
Harry offered a brief smile and hurried after the pair of Slytherins. He slipped passed students milling in the Entrance Hall, catching sight of Malfoy and Pansy as they started for the staircase.
Draco could fell his anger slipping away with each confession from the weeping ex-Gryffindor.
“I cab hear you,” Draco stated.
“Oh please, Potter,” Pansy said disbelievingly. “Your interest in women doesn’t even exceed leering at them. My breasts are practically falling out of my shirt and you haven’t looked once.”
“I’ve come for my father, please let him out.” Draco hated the way his voice sounded so vulnerable. “If he stays here he’ll catch his death.”
“It’s the lack of trust in your new instincts you great
“Y-You
The brunet threw an unimpressed glare to the side where Fred and George stood smirking. Unlike the rest of their friends, the always buoyant wardrobe was hardly ever deterred by Harry’s temper tantrums.
“Insane it may be, but that does not mean it is false,” Malfoy stated tightly.
“Miss me already?” Harry said in reply.
Harry cursed silently. The fact that Malfoy hadn’t seemed too worried about it was relieving to say the least; Harry’s secret remained unknown.
“So you want to come out… just so you can find a guy?” Seamus questioned.
Potter gazed at him suspiciously, eyes narrowing.
“Fred and George will show you the way if you like.”
. Potter and I are busy.”
“It’s his
Harry’s emotions were a whirlwind of confusion, anger, disbelief, and resentful acceptance. Suddenly, his green eyes widened, his mind reeling back to the day when Malfoy would not leave him be.
, which already have fifty notes.
,” Pansy replied.
“You have to be joking.”
Harry hung his head and sniffed. “You’re my first, Draco, my first partner, my first love—I don’t know how to act in something this big. Everyone I’ve ever cared about has been taken away from me...” tears began to drip down his cheeks, “... I’m so scared that you’ll also be taken from me.” He drew in a shaking breath and lifted his head, staring directly into the piercing grey eyes of his first and only love. “I’m scared they won’t accept you, I’m scared you’ll see me differently when they don’t, I’m scared your parents will hate me...”
Turning, Draco’s gaze landed on a moonlight swathed glass case, something long and thin twirling slowly within. A frown tugged at the blond’s brow as he stepped carefully across the carpet, avoiding broken bits of wood.
“Sure,” Harry replied, his breath finally catching up with him.
“Oh cut the crap, Draco.” Pansy frowned at him. “What happens if Potter finds out about this?” she asked, gesturing towards his screen.
Harry had spent most of the day in a jubilant haze as he prepared the food and cleaned the apartment. It wasn’t until he was stepping out of the shower and considering what to wear did he begin to feel the first flutter of nerves.
Surprisingly, Malfoy did so, gazing at Harry intently with his lips still quirked in a teasing smirk. The Gryffindor swallowed, ignored the abrupt flare of arousal, gripped his bag and shoved passed, his eyes fixed determinedly on the space before him.
“May I clarify something, Potter?” Malfoy asked then.
“No… but I
“How’d she react?” Ron snickered.
,” Potter mocked.
“Sulking doesn’t become you, Potter,” Draco commented, eyeing the brunet whose gaze was set firmly on the ice below them. “But I’ll stop—only because I can’t stand to see a Gryffindor cry.”
“Manipulation tactic, Potter. A poor one but a tactic nonetheless. I’ll have my usual, Khari.”
“Obviously, otherwise I would not have said Monday.”
“Whatever you’re drinking, Harry,” he replied immediately.
“It’s… nothing you’d like I’m sure,” he said instead. “Quidditch stuff mostly.”
Harry turned his head, frowning at his best friend. “How do you know?” he asked, voice croaky.
“Then take her on a picnic or something,” Harry suggested.
“Draco, do you realise that it will never work?”
Pansy studied her friend’s pale face, biting her lip. “Are you alright for—do you need…?” she began, hand hovering over her left wrist.
It made sense in Harry’s head. After all, hadn’t he been thinking about Malfoy in that manner on his way back to his room last night? No doubt his subconscious had decided to take things into its own hands.
“Then allow me to take the lead.”
Hermione blinked. “You’re
“Mione—”
“And Weasley?”
Draco refrained from rolling his eyes. “What do you propose we do then?” he asked instead, unable to fully hide the snark from his tone.
“Did you get the headache yesterday?” she asked gently.
Harry swung back around, smiling sheepishly. “Thank you, Khari,” he said, paying the man.
Unaware that the fourth year had run off, Draco made his way slowly up the long staircase, casting a longing glace back to where he could see the Great Hall.
Smiling slightly, Draco shook his head. “No, I’m alright, Pansy, thank you.” Steeling himself, he brushed down his school robes one last time. “Come on, let’s go.”
Draco’s breath caught in his throat. “
It was exceedingly dark.
“No more coffee for you, mate,” Harry stated, reaching over for a piece of toast as Ron grinned.
until that morning! You’re telling me that he took your blood despite you being unaware of his change? How can you be sure if the enjoyment you felt during whatever the hell happened between the two of you was strengthened because you
“I’ve
Harry’s smile remained but he shook his head. “Seriously, Draco, it’ll be late by the time I get back—”
Once their usernames and passwords had been organised, their settings configured and wallpapers chosen, Harry began showing Ron the better uses for their laptops.
A voice hissed.
“Then why didn’t you
“Where are you going?” he asked.
The cushion-cat was emitting a wonderful radiating warmth and Draco, already fighting off shivers from the icy draft that seemed to constantly drift through the castle, was not at all opposed to cradling the softly purring fluffy oblong in his arms. He plucked Crookshanks up off the floor and settled him into the crook of his elbow, much to the pleasure of the fluffy orange cushion, whose purrs became more intense. Smiling bemusedly, Draco continued up the stairs after his guides, feeling a little more content for the first time since his arrival.
Harry stared. Malfoy looked away.
The female winced, dropping her gaze. “Harry is upset with me,” Hermione admitted, staring at the table top. “So I don’t… I’m not sure what his decision will be. He hasn’t spoken to me for two weeks.”
Draco swallowed around the sudden lump in his throat. “Why would he look for me,” he drawled bluntly. “He knows what happened.” A wince passed over Potter’s face and Draco felt his stomach drop a little.
his subconscious thought smugly.
Bloody Pansy had been right.
“I don’t believe it,” Draco breathed. “The Golden Boy has a Tumblr.” He scrolled through Harry’s posts, amused by the fact that their supposed hero liked men as much as he did. “You’re full of surprises, Potter.” He quirked a sleek blond eyebrow as he mused maliciously. “I wonder how much the Daily Prophet would pay to get their hands on this.”
The female rolled her eyes as she crossed the room and sat herself down on the blond’s bedspread. “But you did miss me, didn’t you?”
There was a moment of silence.
“Oh, yes?”
Harry’s frown deepened. “Doesn’t that completely disregard the entire point of forgiveness?” he murmured. “I said I forgave you… and yet I subconsciously wanted to hurt you. You should loathe me.”
He changed into his quidditch gear, grabbed his broom and made his way from his room and down the stairs. He ignored all voices that called out to him as he left the Slytherin common room and marched his way through the castle. Only when he was outside did he allow his pace to slow, his broom leaning comfortably against his shoulder. The walk to the quidditch pitch was a soothing one wherein Draco was able to calm the annoying inner voice that had decided to take up residence during his denial stage.
, Harry, keep dragging him back into the ‘playing field’ so to speak. You can’t help but make accusations about how different Malfoy is despite the fact that you’ve barely been within two feet of the man since returning to Hogwarts.” Hermione stared at her friend knowingly. “If it’s not Quidditch you’re talking about it’s usually a certain blond Slytherin.”
“I’m fine,” he replied.
“Fuck off, Ron.”
As the Dark Lord neared, Draco rose to his feet. He met the gaze of the male as Voldemort paused before him, the smile on the Dark Lord’s face growing into something positively wicked.
With a decisive nod, Hermione made a mental promise to speak with him. After all, attempting to make friends with Harry didn’t necessarily mean that Malfoy had accepted him as his blood-mate. Of course, it might have also been that Malfoy had been teasing Harry, messing around with him in order to keep some form of normality between them.
“Oh yes,
He stepped further inside, eyes scanning the shadows for possible sign of movement. He was unsure as to where Potter was exactly, but if this tower was his usual haunt, there was a very good chance that Draco would run into him here. That thought did nothing to stifle his curiosity, of course. He was here now, and damned it all if Draco wasn’t going to get a good look to see what all the fuss was about.
“What happened after he told you?” Ron continued.
Scowling, Draco did as she said, flicking his wand wordlessly over each hand and halfway up his arms. He stared at her pointedly, sniffing with obvious distain. She snorted in reply, handing over a root for Draco cut.
Swallowing, the blond closed his eyes, relieved as Harry’s emotions began to calm, draining into a simmer. He expelled a sigh and pushed up off the cold stone wall, straightening his robes absently. He could only pray that Harry would give him the chance to fix this—to make things right. And with two weeks already passed, it wouldn’t be long now until Draco would be fighting the urge to feed from Harry again.
The Slytherin choked back a derisive laugh. This was all he needed this morning.
“Alright,” he conceded, pulling away from her.
“Mmm, true,” Ron pondered.
“It’s probably too far up his a—”
to be.”
“But I’m not dead though… right?”
Ron sighed. “I guess I better go speak with him,” he announced.
“We might have gotten drunk one night and talked,” Harry admitted. “He’s actually not as bad as we thought—I
sense.”
“What was You-Know-Who like?”
Ron was staring. Hermione was nodding thoughtfully.
deserved to hear his Harry during this intimate moment—this was his moment and his alone. He could feel his mate jerking with his release, his muscles pulsing with spasms as his orgasm flooded through his entire figure. The taste of his beloved on his tongue sent Draco into a frenzy;
“You’re better than this, Draco,” she stated. “I know you’re not the best when it comes to being in the wrong but guess what—you fucked up. Now, you can either grow a pair and act like the strong male you are, or you can continue to wallow and give Potter no reason to ever desire you again. Frankly, if I were Potter, the way you’ve been sulking these past few days would have turned me off considerably.”
Hermione smiled slyly. “Face facts, Malfoy,” she grinned. “You’ve given Harry an amazing gift... and you didn’t even know it.”
!” He stared at the brunet, frustration washing through him at the confusion growing on Harry’s face.
“No I’m bold enough as it is,” Harry replied wryly. “Why did we even consider the plan of us plus alcohol being a good idea?”
Pansy could almost see the cogs whirling in the muggleborn’s mind. Realisation and understanding swept across Granger’s face as the female made connections to the clues that had been hiding in plain sight.
memories should have been. “I fear my—my recollection has been tampered with…”
Draco opened a new internet window and directed it to his email homepage. He usually only used it for Tumblr notifications and for sending emails to his closer followers rather than constantly sending them an ‘ask’.
“Let’s start here, Perce, and work our way up,” Ron suggested, making his flames bigger so they cast more light. “We can show Draco the other levels tomorrow when it’s daytime. The grounds look great when they’re covered in snow.”
Harry laughed bitterly, hardly believing the words he was about to admit to his best friends. “Turns out, Malfoy is—” Harry struggled. Try as he might he could just not bring himself to utter that final word. “That he—
“What? How!” Pansy exclaimed.
“Who’s he calling a piece of ‘work’?” Draco griped. Despite his annoyance, a small smile lit up his face. “I guess he
“That’s not how you become a vampire, Ronald,” Hermione explained patiently.
Draco forced himself to drink, allowing himself to remain in the position for at least a minute before pulling away. He swiped his tongue across the bite mark, placing a final appreciative kiss as the wound began to heal. He rocked back on his heels, eyes still closed as he continued to kneel, waiting for Pansy’s blood to settle in his veins.
Harry found himself shrugging. “I asked him if it was true. He said it was. Then he apologised.” His fingers began to fiddle with the hem of his left sleeve. “He seemed genuine but I…” he sighed forcibly all of a sudden, rubbing his face tiredly with his face. “It took me so long to completely trust Malfoy and in a blink of an eye it was broken. He may have not meant to hurt me in the end but the fact is he did. I’m finding myself hesitant to be comfortable with him again.”
Stepping out into the cold, Harry cast numerous warming charms and wrapped his cloak around him tightly. He followed the footsteps that Malfoy had left in the snow, vanishing his own every few feet.
Chuckling, Draco leant forwards, eyes on the enticing way Harry’s lips parted so readily. “How can I refuse such a request?” Closing the gap between them, Draco captured his mate’s mouth in a kiss so passionate Harry’s knees actually buckled. He was saved from hitting the floor by Draco’s secure embrace, his own hands coming to rest on the blond’s broad shoulders to help steady himself.
“Since his life became exceedingly boring,” Draco snapped in reply. “I’ll help you when I damn well feel like it. Leave me alone. I’m tired.”
“Mmm, Happy Valentine’s,” Harry replied sleepily, reaching out to pull the warm body lying beside him closer. A head came to rest on his chest and one of Harry’s hand immediately delved into the delicate strands as he angled his head to press a kiss to blond hair.
“That’s quite… ingenious.”
of times! He wasn’t even sure if it really was Malfoy that caused those particular reactions…
away.
he thought, shutting his eyes stubbornly and willing himself to sleep.
“You’ve got to be joking,” Draco replied immediately, slamming the lid of his laptop down. “I have been bored out of my mind waiting for you—there’s no way I’m giving up a romp in the shower for—
“Bossy Gryffindors? Mmm, you better believe it.” Draco leant down and captured Potter’s mouth in a searing kiss. The male responded immediately, his tongue battling with Draco’s. The blond, determined as always, won, and Potter allowed Draco to take control of the kiss, while his hands slid up beneath Draco’s shirt, nails scoring his skin.
“Draco? Are you coming to breakfast?”
“Unfortunately,” Harry sighed.
Malfoy inclined his head in understanding. “To be fair, I shouldn’t have completely relied on your Gryffindor naivety,” he replied with a wry smile. “Getting hurt by someone you care about is painful and, commonly, unforgivable. I broke your trust and I hurt you. Imagine my surprise when but a week later you had ‘forgiven’ me? Instead of suggesting for you to honestly consider your feelings towards me, knowing full well it had not been long enough, I accepted your word because I missed you. We both wanted things to be alright again without the work that should have come with it.”
“You’re a virgin, yes?” Malfoy asked and Harry nodded his response.
Potter gazed shyly at the blond. “I’m not sure,” he said truthfully. “You didn’t just—um—do this because of what I told you?”
Draco was the first out of the classroom once Binns had dismissed them. He was halfway down the corridor before he allowed himself to slow, breathing in the clean, Potter-free air as he tried to regain some form of normality back.
“Don’t you care?”
and Harry had to curve the impulse to continue tearing his room apart. Instead, he marched over to his bedside, where a small table held a mirror and a beautiful crystal case. Enclosed within the case was an unusual wand hovering silently. “What does he
that wasn’t the sound of breaking bones?!
It was true that it was second nature to glare at the blond; when had Harry ever turned a smile in Malfoy’s direction? Well, excluding the day after Harry’s vision was corrected—
“Who? Oh! The lad. Yes, the, well the, ah, lad, actually he’s in the process of—um, circumstances being what they are, he…” Percy’s face fell. “He’s not coming.”
“Parkinson,” Ron repeated. “What did she want?”
“Maybe.”
Harry, Tumblr Newbie, 17, UK.
“Yes, you’re right. It’s called, ‘let Pansy handle it instead.’”
“Make him freak?” Ron grinned. “Good. Well, mate, I think he’s been tortured pretty thoroughly if that’s the case.”
“That wouldn’t happen to be the
“We all think so,” Fred added, George nodding vigorously in agreement.
The blond fled from the room as if his very life depended on it. Judging from the sheer amount of power radiating from Potter at the moment, it probably did. He didn’t stop, not even when Percy called out to him in worry as he flew down the stairs.
love-sick,” Pansy commented, “but you forget. Potter was just as smitten with you as you are with him… I highly doubt that has changed.”
“I don’t know you well enough to answer that.”
“One thing is for sure,” Potter said, breaking the quiet that had fallen over them. “We should have tried this sooner.”
“What’s his favourite colour?”
“Tell me about it.” Malfoy stretched his arms above his head, his soft creamy sweater rising up over his skin. Harry’s eyes flickered briefly to Malfoy’s exposed stomach, mouth becoming exceedingly dry.
Harry Potter would be his.
“Tell anyone and you’re a dead man,” Malfoy sneered, thrusting the two bottles of wine he held into Harry’s arms and moving past him.
“It’s about yesterday,” Potter began, reaching up to rub the back of his neck awkwardly.
“I don’t have the patience to deal with—” Draco shuddered—“
“Harry, mate...
“Yep,” Hermione replied.
“Don’t
“No,” he declared, “not yet. I’d rather not ruin it for either of us.” He glanced at the time, a smile curling at his lips as he realised Potter would be arriving in ten minutes.
“My lord, please forgive me but I—I cannot—” His mind remained blank; a gaping hole where he
“Yeah, how’d you know?”
Hermione rolled her eyes but allowed a small smile to grace her lips. “Alright I’ll back off. But I’ll be watching you like a hawk during lunch today to make sure you’re eating correctly.”
don’t give me that look, Ron!”
“Then stop acting like one,” she replied immediately. “You know I keep track of how often you feed. Do you think I wouldn’t have noticed that it’s been an entire month?” She glared at the vampire in annoyance. “All it takes is
“Bring it, Malfoy.”
Harry was frowning at him. Obviously, Draco had been staring a little too intently at the inflamed pinpricks. He cleared his throat.
Malfoy pulled a face. “How have you survived Potions so far? These sorts of questions have been in previous exams.”
With the moon so bright overheard, Draco forewent lighting his wand; there was no need to draw any unnecessary attention after all. As the blond drew closer, the great castle seemed to loom out of the darkness. Draco craned his neck as his gaze swept across the vast fortress, disbelief appearing on his face.
Harry frowned down at his lap. “I think I want to be more than friends,” he admitted, voice barely a murmur.
, Potter, that means relaxing,” Draco said with a nod.
Harry’s hands clenched into fists as he stared furiously at the bricks. “It would give me great
It was true; Draco really didn’t see Potter as anything extremely special. He was a typical, standard teenage boy with the same angst as most others. Draco wasn’t attracted to him because of his name or anything of the sort—it had been the pure, physical attraction that drew the blond’s attention initially. Any fool could argue that Draco was only after Potter because of his name but that was nowhere near the truth. Although it pained Draco to admit it… he really did like Potter for being, well, Potter.
Harry groaned, a
“No, Draco,
“I have a feeling he doesn’t know what they are,” Hermione giggled. “I went to print a few documents the other day and noticed they’ve been built with a scanner and they’re pretty simple to use. Makes adding a picture to an assignment that little bit easier.”
Potter hummed in agreement. “Are you going to remove some clothing any time soon?”
Pansy fluttered her hand. “I get that stare at least three times a day,” she said loftily.
Draco lowered one of his hands to Potter’s jaw, feeling the muscles contracting as the brunet gave in to his advances. He tightened his grip only slightly, tilting Potter’s head to allow better access. Potter complied willingly enough, his body leaning unconsciously into Draco’s as the kiss deepened.
“Nah he’s not my type,” Harry replied. “I love Neville as a friend but I prefer blonds.”
A look of surprise crossed Harry’s face and he lifted a hand, grazing curious fingers over the puncture wounds on his neck.
“You’d be surprised,” Draco replied. “Of course, everything we believed about one another is no doubt completely wrong.”
Pansy stared at the Gryffindor. “What in Salazar’s name did you
The other boy grinned in response. “Don’t like the chase, Draco?”
“You think or you do?” he asked then, observing Draco carefully.
A sneeze suddenly caught him off guard, nose tingling unpleasantly as he reached for more tissues, pulling them from the pocket in his robe. Pansy gazed at him, pity written all over her face.
“Go on ahead, you guys,” Hermione said, noting the hint of desperation in Parkinson’s voice. “I’ll catch up with you.”
Maybe this wouldn’t be so hard after all.
“I heard the other day that Malfoy’s trying to change Snape’s opinion of them,” Hermione continued.
“My lord?” Lucius began carefully.
“Oh?” Harry hummed, turning his head to catch Khari’s eye, “what were you after?” He froze when he felt a heated palm press firmly on his jean-clad thigh and he turned his head back, not enjoying the fervent look Eli was now giving him.
that!” Draco glared.
“My lord?”
Ron shook his head. “No... no it’s just—” His face fell. “Now we can’t go out and pick up random girls together.”
“Just you wait,” Malfoy replied, lowering his face purposely towards Harry’s neck.
“But you didn’t even know I liked males,” Harry frowned.

A triumphant smile stretched at Draco’s lips as he read Potter’s reply. No suspicion was noted, not that Draco expected any. After all, why would Potter even

, blood.” The grin on Harry’s face countered his comment but Draco was still unable to refrain from rolling his eyes.
… Draco, I—did you even think of me in this way before you were changed?”
He shrugged disdainfully in reply. “As well as you can expect,” he replied with a sneer.
“If you’re going to admit you’re a vampire, you’ve done that already.”
Ron gazed at Harry thoughtfully, understanding beginning to dawn over him as to why his best mate was struggling to accept Malfoy’s apology. The ferret had made a stupid mistake, this much was obvious, and yet Harry’s reaction to this entire situation had surprised him. Not that the brunet had had many relationships, but the few Ron remembered had never caused Harry to respond the way he was now. Harry had always remained distant when it came to intimacy, and although a lot of that could be linked to the fact that the brunet preferred males over females, Ron had already noticed the subtle differences in Harry’s relationship with Malfoy that explained Harry’s unexpected emotional upheaval.
He swallowed.
“I’m a dark
The brunet chuckled softly but shook his head. “No. No, I wanted to ask… would you mind talking me through the steps? Seeing as I’ve never done this before I don’t really have any clue as to what to expect or… or what to do.” He smiled weakly at the blond. “I’m probably not going to be very good.”
Ignoring his own mind, Draco pondered how to respond to Potter’s latest message.
Draco denied silently.
“Blood. Mate.” Hermione stated slowly. “A vampire’s blood-mate is a single being they are chemically and physically attracted to. Should Draco ever initiate the bond with Harry, he will never be able to feed from another being.”
Draco shrugged. “Perhaps, for the sake of our sanity, we should.”
“I didn’t mean any harm—”
Harry snorted, shoving his friend off the bed. “It should be against the law to include Voldemort in jokes.”
isn’t the understatement of the year,” he commented wryly. His eyes tracked over the movements of the objects, watching as items were placed around him. More candles were set along the table in beautiful carved silver holders and Ron bounded along the wooden top to light each one.
“Well?” Pansy pressed, gazing expectantly at the blond.
Harry felt his cheeks burn. It was one thing to tell Pansy that he and Malfoy were now fooling around, but it was another to tell her everything that they’ve done behind closed doors.
Dazzling green eyes met with grey once more and Draco was surprised to note the way the brunet’s cheeks reddening further, a tentative smile on his face.
