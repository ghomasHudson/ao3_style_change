His “errrmmm” in response was enough for Pansy to fling the door open and start critiquing the options he had laid out on his bed, occasionally muttering something like ‘you really are blind’ and ‘I’m surprised you can get dressed in a morning’. Eventually, once she had decided that he looked the perfect balance between looking effortless and put together (which was a simple pair of tight-in-the-right-places black jeans and a loose dark green shirt with one too few buttons done up for his liking), she ‘gave him permission to go down to the party.
This seal of approval from Hermione opened the proverbial floodgates on party planning. Seamus volunteered to source the alcohol. Pansy ensured that she would organise the entertainment for the party. Harry, who was sat amidst this, felt like he had to contribute something, and volunteered to go to the kitchens and ask the house-elves for some snacks. He wasn’t sure that the others even knew where the kitchen was; he only did thanks to Fred, George and the map, and also knew that he had leverage with the house-elves that perhaps the others didn’t have. As much as he hated the fame associated with being ‘the chosen one’, he had to admit that occasionally it had its benefits
Hermione kept looking at Harry, trying to get him to join in the conversation but she only managed to get him to say a couple of words. When they got to the Great Hall, they noticed that another table had been added in addition to the usual 4 house tables and the staff table where the rest of the Eighth Years that were awake were sat.
I would recommend watching LK2:SP just cause I mention it a lot but if you don’t want to just know that if the Lion King if Lion Hamlet then Lion King 2 is Lion Romeo & Juliet without the tragic ending.
Eventually, Harry ended up with a pair of glasses that looked almost identical to his original pair. He hated to admit it but Pansy was right. Wizarding glasses were simply better. The lenses were self-repairing, which would have been handy countless times over the past few years. The lenses were also ‘smudge resistant’ which, to quote Pansy, would “Stop you looking like unsightly grease-ball and more like a functioning member of wizarding society”. Harry wasn’t convinced that a few fingerprint marks had an impact on his ability to function but he decided not to push it if he wanted to make it back to the castle anytime soon.
for us. You want us to sit around plaiting each other’s hair and telling each other about the people we have crushes on?
“If I’m Scar, who does that make you then?”
“So what do you want, Pansy?”
“The little rat?”
Just after Hakuna Matata, Harry leaned back over and whispered back to Malfoy
How could Harry have been so stupid! He knew Draco had the mark. And it was technically a tattoo, albeit one filled with incredibly dark magic.
Hope you enjoy!
At this, all the Gryffindors turned to look at Draco who was currently finding the wall behind Harry’s head incredibly fascinating.
The Hufflepuff’s seemed to be almost as tipsy as Harry. Harry supposed he shouldn’t be surprised by this. There had always been rumours about what happened in the Hufflepuff common room. Harry vaguely remembered Fred and George telling him in the Fourth Year that the Hufflepuff’s had giant orgies in their common room every night and that Harry should go ask his ‘pal’ Cedric whether he could go. This had caused Harry to protest almost too insistently that he
“Who says I did this for you? Maybe I just wanted you to get to fully experience the shitshow that will happen when you appear in public after all of your drunken admissions. Besides, it wouldn’t look good for me if I left you stumbling around sicking up on every available surface. People would say I poisoned you in your sleep and my public image can't take that blow.”
“Deal”
As soon as the credits began, the room erupted into chatter with those who had grown up away from the muggle-world asking how the muggles had made the film without magic. Dean, Hermione and some of the others did their best to explain how the animation process worked although their explanations weren’t anything more than its lots of drawings one after the other.
There was a stunned silence.
“This? These tears? They are not a weakness.” Hermione comforted, moving in closer to put her arm around him. “They show how strong you are and how strong you’ve been. And one day when you’re older, you’ll look back and know that you were strong enough to overcome what so many people wouldn’t be able to in their wildest dreams. What happened to you made you stronger.”
After the opticians, Harry was dragged into what looked like a make-up shop.
“Okay, sure I think he’s fit. But that doesn’t mean I like him. I can just appreciate a good-looking person. Nothing more than that.”
Harry saw that whilst Malfoy looked grown up like an adult, he was still the same child who got scared in detention in the Forbidden Forest in their First Year and ran away screaming with Fang.
“No,” Harry said, a little moody that Malfoy was being such a prick about his suggestion. “I just thought- you know what never mind what I thought.” Harry grabbed his wand and went to go meet Ron and Hermione before breakfast but just as he was walking through the door, he heard a voice.
“I haven’t dated anyone since Ginny if that’s what you want to know.” Harry didn’t mentioned that, whilst he hadn’t dated anyone per say, he had certainly hooked up with lots of muggles in clubs and bars over the summer.
Malfoy looked at him for a moment before replying, “I already told you, Potter, I didn’t do it to be kind. It was purely for my own self-interest.” He paused before adding, “although for both of our sakes, try to refrain from drinking that much again. I don’t want to waste all of my potion supplies on you and I daresay you didn’t benefit much from your inebriation either.”
“But I was there. I was obviously in the room given I said whatever it was I said. So you can tell me right?” Harry stared at Zabini imploringly and Zabini stared right back.
Years that starting that morning, they would all have compulsory Muggle Studies workshops in order to help ‘break down prejudices’ and ‘bridge cultural divides’.
logical solution: just start talking.
Harry had intended to use this time to get his Charms essay finished. He’d done most of the work but it was by no means ready to be handed in. Pansy, however, had other ideas. He had just brought his books down to one of the tables in the common room early on Saturday morning when she appeared beside him out of thin air and suddenly announced:
It was late that evening that Harry decided to tell Ron and Hemione. He’d spent the whole day sat between the two of them, silently doing his homework for charms that was due the next day, whilst they bickered about Ron’s lack of work ethic.
Until now.
’? What had Harry said? He remembered the beginnings of the game of Never Have I Ever although he didn’t remember anything after Hermione and Ron left the room.
“I don’t actually remember. I guess I drank a bit much. It can't be that bad though, can it? The game seemed to be just sex-related questions so I doubt it was anything to do with the war. It’s probably just everyone else being prudes about whatever it was I’ve done.” He looked at Hermione who stilled seemed to be agitated and was picking at her nails in an attempt to keep herself occupied. “And hey, I’m sorry for not telling you about the tattoos and some of that other stuff.”
Harry woke to the deafening sound of music coming from the common room. He was surprised that they hadn’t woken the whole castle and that McGonagall hadn’t come and told them off yet. Casting a quick tempus, he realised that the party was just starting and whilst staying in his bed was a very appealing option, he dreaded to think how Pansy would react if he never showed up.
“He really does! A mess of black hair, ridiculously green eyes and an obnoxiously large scar on your head that is basically what you’re known for. You’re practically twins.”
The following morning, Harry tried his best to not think about Malfoy.
After Pansy was satisfied that Harry was stocked up with enough Sleakeazy to last a couple of months, the two of them began to walk up to the castle.
That evening the rest of the students arrived. Harry was somewhat disappointed that they wouldn’t get to go on the Hogwarts Express with everyone else but when he thought about the crowd of people on the platform he was thankful that they had arrived by Portkey. McGonagall had wanted to allow them extra time to deal with the emotions of returning. The memories Harry had of the castle last year were less than pleasant and he knew that his fellow Eighth Years had it worst of all. They had been the ones stuck here with Snape and the Carrows all year. Seeing innocent First Years tortured by the cruciatus curse. Hearing the screams of the children who had been brave enough to speak out against Voldemort and were facing the consequences.
“Well raised to believe in the ‘bad side’. Given the next to impossible task of killing the older leader of the other side. Cocky in his skills especially when younger. He-“
When Harry looked up, he met Malfoy’s eyes again. It didn’t escape his notice that they both had flower tattoos for their mothers.
“It used to be all the time although I guess when I started Hogwarts it was only in the summer. I wouldn’t have even known half of it was abuse if it wasn’t for the mind healer I had to see after the war. Did you know that some abuse isn’t physical? Apparently I was also emotionally abused. Most the time it wasn’t that bad. It was worse when you gave a reaction so I suppose after a while I just got numb to it. A couple of times when it was really bad I passed out from the pain, you know. I don’t even remember all of it. I would just wake up with a new injury.”
“Don’t strain yourself thinking this early in the morning, Potter. I can hear you below-average sized brain whirring away from here.”
“Kovu is
Harry watched Malfoy as he walked up the stairs. When Harry had seen him during the Battle of Hogwarts, he had seemed thin and frail but now Harry thought he seemed more…alive. 2 months in the summer sun had brought some colour to his face. His shoulders seemed broader too. And his arms were more muscley. And his-
As Harry went down the stairs, he had a brief thought that it was strange how he hadn’t seen Malfoy getting ready before the party since they shared a room, but he just assumed that Malfoy didn’t want to go to the party or hadn’t bothered to change.
“What is it, Parkinson?” He was still cautious just in case she wanted to continue the earlier conversation and squeeze any gossip o7t of him. But her face softened and she said “I know.”
Pansy’s words stuck with Harry for the rest of the morning. He knew Ron and Hermione would be supportive so telling them wouldn’t be an issue. But he also knew that if he didn’t tell anyone, there was less of a chance of the Daily Prophet finding out and all of this blowing up in his face. That and he just knew Hermione would try and force him to read some weird book about ‘Safe Sex for Homosexuals’ or ‘The History of Being Gay in the Wizarding World’, which if he was honest, wasn’t something that excited him. He knew enough protective charms to prevent the former from being an issue and for the latter, well, he had already read about Dumbledore and Grindelwald in that awful book by Rita Skeeter and if he was honest that had been all the reading he ever wanted to do about random old gay people in his lifetime.
Harry had thought he noticed Draco’s eyes snap up to him just as Pansy mentioned his breakup with Ginny, but he was now staring at his plate so Harry wasn’t entirely sure.
When Harry headed down to breakfast the next morning, he was under the impression that he had a free period today until lunch. What he wasn’t expecting when he got down to the Great Hall was McGonagall telling all the 8
“Never have I ever received a lap dance.” Harry drank, although his memory about that evening was foggy.
Just as Harry was about to reply, he saw Zabini enter the common room. He didn’t exactly know Zabini but he knew enough to know that Zabini would tell him straight what he revealed last night. He wouldn’t beat around the bush awkwardly. Without overthinking it anymore, Harry caught the boy’s eye and gestured for him to come over to their corner.
Harry opened his mouth but then closed it again, unsure what to say. This seemed to satisfy Malfoy who let out a quiet laugh almost without realising what he was doing. They sat there in silence for what felt like years before Harry eventually decided to take advantage of their room being empty and went to get dressed.
Harry raised his heavy eyelids halfway open only for them to shut again. He furrowed his brow and curled in on himself, this new position somehow soothing the nausea.
The rest of the Gryffindors seemed to be relatively sober. As were the Ravenclaws. Lavender was sat between Parvati and Padma, who were both giggling about something. Lavender seemed to laugh with them occasionally but for the most part, she just sat with her head resting on Parvati’s shoulder whilst Parvati carded her fingers through Lavender’s hair.
“No. No, no, no. That’s not
I told myself this would be a light-hearted almost cliché fic yet I’ve already sprinkled in some trauma and angst for Harry to deal with. Which wasn’t intentional however I’m also a firm believer that fans of the Harry Potter series as a whole disregard the trauma Harry has even from non-war related incidences way too easily and that he deserves everything and more in this world. I would go as far as to say that Harry Potter is my favourite character in the Harry Potter franchise which is surprisingly uncommon given he is the literal main character.
“Never have I ever eaten ass.” Harry drank.
Harry raised his eyebrow slightly. “Is it an exception?”
“When did you expect, Goldstein” drawled Malfoy. “Potter was hardly going to be shagging someone in a public place whilst being hunted down by a psychopathic murderer. We all know Potter has a death wish but I doubt even he would want to be found by Voldemort whilst he was rimming some random person’s arse.”
Hermione looked like she was about to cry when she saw the giant scar in the centre of his chest. The scar left from when he was killed. It was almost the same as the one on his forehead except much larger and darker.
Starting something new is difficult. It can take time and lots of practice but eventually, you realise that it has become familiar. It wasn’t as difficult, and it becomes second nature and you forget how it ever felt alien to you.
He supposed he was right. He didn’t know the first thing about dating. He wasn’t sure he ever had. Ginny and him never dated properly cause the war kind of eliminated the possibility of popping into Madam Puddifoot’s Tea Shop.
I think that is the angst over with for the time being (was this chapter even that angsty? Who knows)
Both Harry and Ron had sent Thank You letters in response (in Ron's case, following much persuading from Hermione) and that had been the end of the correspondence. Hermione had somehow managed to somewhat befriend Pansy through their letters and despite not being thick as thieves, they were definitely good acquaintances and got along much better than they ever had in the past, handy given they were now roommates.
That Draco Malfoy saved his life, despite putting himself at risk by doing so and that without him, the war might have ended a very different way.
“Look, I’m the one sharing a room with him, not you, and whilst I’m by no means thrilled about this decision, McGonagall knows what she’s doing so she clearly had a reason for doing this.”
Harry did not enjoy shopping with a purpose as it was so shopping with a purposeful Pansy Parkinson was his idea of hell.
The Eighth Year Common Room was similar to the Gryffindor Common Room except it incorporated all the different house colours. In the centre were 2 large brown leather sofas and numerous mismatched armchairs, all covered in lots of throw blankets despite the room being kept warm by a large fireplace. There was a large table on one side of the room similar to those in the library to give them somewhere to do work together without the distraction of the younger year groups. To the Hufflepuffs’ (and Neville’s) delight there were lots of plants in the room. Hermione and the Ravenclaws particularly liked the bookshelf in the corner with a couple dozen books that would complement their studies. The architecture of the room had the grandeur of the Slytherin Common Room but also the cosiness of the Gryffindor common room. Harry had to give it to McGonagall. She had somehow created a space that all of the Eighth Years felt comfortable and at home in.
This led to the birth of the Eighth Year of Hogwarts which, in short, was the same as being in Seventh Year but with extra freedom and other perks such as having their own individual common room and only having to share a dorm with one other person. Unfortunately for Harry Potter, he had been paired with...
The same thing goes for people. When you meet somebody new you may not hit it off but the more time you spend together the more you get used to their presence and they grow on you, albeit like mould in some cases, but you get used to them nevertheless.
Begrudgingly, Harry followed her in. He found himself in what was effectively an opticians.
“Never Have I Ever been hungover”
Draco simply raised an eyebrow at her as if to say ‘there are never going to be any juicy details in that relationship.
“Well, if you ever meet these hypothetical men, please feel free to send them my way Potter. Now if that’s all, I’d rather like to stop discussing my love life or rather, lack-thereof.”
Harry made a noise of discontent although that was more because he resented the accuracy of Malfoy’s description. It was at that point Harry remembered Pansy was also on the sofa with them.
“Well maybe this is an exception.”
It had been almost surreal arriving back. The castle had been repaired over the summer so well that if you didn’t know that there had been a battle there 4 months ago, you wouldn’t be able to tell. But even walking down the now cleaned corridors, Harry still saw every cowering 5th Year who snuck back in to fight, the bright flashes of spells being thrown wildly in every direction, the cries of family and friends struck with grief over a loved one, rubble and casualties of the battle alike strewn across the floor, the dust in the air as the floor and ceilings shook.
Both Harry and Malfoy guffawed at this.
She strode into the room quickly and once at the front spoke:
Just because Harry felt himself getting a bit more
made a joke earlier that day about how the two characters they related to fell in love with each other.
When Harry got down to the common room, he was surprised to see what appeared to be a muggle disco ball hanging in the centre of the room which, combined with some impressive charm work causing brightly coloured lights to move around the room, was actually managing to create the impression of some sort of club.
Malfoy, who clearly had gotten changed as he was wearing a black button-down and tight black trousers. Even though the top few buttons of his shirt were undone, Malfoy still managed to look incredibly formal and far more put together than anyone else.
“Who looks like me?”
“I was a child!  I didn’t need to be strong I needed to be safe.”
“Wow, thanks Malfoy.”
I will be updating the tags as I go but have currently included ones I know will definitely apply at some point.
No. It was almost definitely the thought of Pansy Parkinson that was causing him to be fearful. He hadn’t felt scared when she had tried to give him up to Voldemort, but yet now the thought of her terrified him. Harry didn’t like how she had managed to see through him and uncover secrets so deeply buried that not even Hermione had managed to guess. And then there was the unknown. Harry didn’t know Pansy, not well anyway, so he had know idea what she was likely to do with that information. He hoped that she wouldn’t reveal it to anyone but how could he trust that. He knew for certain that if he had discovered a similar secret about anyone, even somebody he wasn’t close with like Goyle, he wouldn’t tell anyone. Or at least he liked to think he wouldn’t. But maybe there was a chance that if that situation occurred, he would tell Ron and Hermione and if that chance existed then it was just as likely that Pansy might tell Malfoy and Zabini. And Harry dreaded to think what would happen if Draco found out. Part of Harry hoped that, being gay himself, if Draco did find out, he would be sympathetic. But the other part of Harry feared that his being “Potter” would trump his not being straight and therefore his secret would be one more thing that Malfoy would use to laugh at him.
By lunchtime on Saturday, Harry was already exhausted as a result of both trying to keep up with a determined Pansy at 10 in the morning and then his brain working overtime trying to figure out what he should do. All he had concluded was that he would quite like to skip out on going to the party altogether, but seeing as he had promised to talk to the house-elves about providing food, he didn’t feel not attending was an option. Definitely not if Parkinson had any say in the matter.
badly, had sex within view of unsuspecting onlookers on purpose, slept with a married person (which in his defence, he only found out
Harry pondered saying a quick Good Morning before deciding that that was a step too far in the ‘act civil to each other’ thing they had going on at the moment and so returned to his search for a mug. Eventually, he found them and was surprised to find a note from McGonagall inside the cupboard as he opened it:
“Yeah”
So random unnecessary details for this in terms of film, I went with Lion King since it came out in 1994 so only 4 years prior and the VHS release was 1995. DVDs became a thing in 1996 but the Lion King DVD wasn’t released until 2003 hence why I stuck with VHS tape. I would have gotten them to watch something more suited to their age group however I really wanted them to watch Lion King 2 because a) it is amazing and b) it has some relevant moral lessons that I feel like McGonagall would have appreciated. Consider this your encouragement to watch it if you haven’t already. The song One of Us is an ABSOLUTE BOP and you’re missing out if you haven’t heard it.
Harry took a moment before asking, “Why?”
“Potter we have to go to Hogsmeade.”
“Maybe they weren’t when you were 11 but now you’re 18. They’re probably not even the right prescription. And, as uncouth as it is to mention nowadays in polite company, they’re muggle made and simply not as good as wizarding glasses.”
Harry realised that sometimes whilst he was talking he had started crying. He wiped the tears as best he could with the heel of his hand. “Great,” he muttered “now I’m blubbering like an idiot. I’m sorry guys I didn’t mean to get like this.”
Harry knew it was bad to judge a book by its cover, but he was surprised when he saw their new teacher walk into the room. She looked so young Harry thought she could have passed as another Weasley child.
“That you’re gay. Or at least not straight anyway. You could be bi or pan or- but anyway the point is I know and I’m guessing that none of your friends do. I know we haven’t exactly had the best relationship but I’ve been through all of the crappy awkward coming out before and if you ever need anyone to talk to about it, I would be happy to.”
(See the end of the chapter for
They watched the rest of the film in relative silence with the occasional gasp or moment of laughter.
Hermione thought a bit more before Ron nudged her: “I don’t want to agree with her but Parkinson is right ‘Mione. Besides, NEWTs aren’t for ages if that’s what you’re worrying about.”
“Sleakeazy. It’s a potion for your hair, Merlin knows you need it. Invented by your grandfather if I’m not mistaken, so it should be able to combat even your unruly hair. After all, it probably was what the potion was designed for.”
And he was actually succeeding so far. His first lesson of the day was Herbology and he managed to stay focused on what Professor Sprout was talking about for the entire lesson. However, after Herbology was Defence Against the Dark Arts…. with Malfoy.
’ to the parchment as well. He wasn’t sure his first point would quite cut it. Their newt assessment was unlikely to get them to fight in the manner he had gotten used to during the war and he wasn’t sure it was appropriate for a lesson environment either.
Suddenly feeling self-conscious about walking around the room in his pyjamas and grabbed a jumper from the end of his bed. As he pulled it on, he realised it was one that Andromeda had leant him when he had gone to visit Teddy during the summer.
I'm going to make this a slow burn but eeeeek the flame is lit
There is implied childhood abuse in this chapter. The actual abuse isn't described but it is still there. If you don't want to read that bit then stop reading after "Harry hated the awkward silence so once again his brain provided him with a totally logical solution: just start talking." The chapter ends pretty soon after this so you don't miss anything important.
He was rummaging in the cupboard for a mug when he heard footsteps coming down the stairs. He turned around to see Malfoy. They both froze as they locked eyes. Harry realised that he had left the curtains around his bed drawn so Malfoy probably hadn’t expected him to be up.
“Potter, you look as if you’ve been letting a first-year practice shrinking and enlarging charms on you. I think some of your clothes would fit a hippogriff they’re so large.”
“Never have I ever received a blowjob.” Harry drank.
“No. I mean it’s not like people didn’t know but if they did, it wasn’t because I told them.” Harry continued mindlessly swinging his legs over the end of his bed and Malfoy had a very pained look on his face.
CUE THE START OF THE FLUFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF (not a lot but we're getting there)
The rest of the day passes quickly enough; Harry popped into the kitchen to convince the house-elves to provide them with some food (although they didn’t require any persuading at all and in the end, Harry had to convince them to cut down on how much they were making), finished his Charms essay and even managed to convince Hermione to check it over for him although she insisted that it was a one-time thing and for the rest of the year he would have to check them himself. He eventually decided the best plan of action was to go and take a nap because he was tired enough as it is and even he knew that a tired Harry isn’t always particularly pleasant to be around. So he went upstairs to his room, climbed into bed and pulled the curtains shut, hoping to get a few hours of sleep before he had to go back downstairs for the party.
Seamus Finnegan had a particularly puzzled look and suddenly blurted out:
After getting dressed, still racking his brain as to what he could have revealed that was so shocking, he headed downstairs to the common room. It was no good troubling himself over it. He might as well go down and face the masses and just find out once and for all what it was he said.
He didn’t look up as he drank, refusing to meet his friends’ eyes although he did hear Hermione let out a scandalised ‘Harry!’ and Zabini snigger something about ‘the Golden boy not being as golden as everyone thought’.
“I was under the impression, Parkinson, that your helping me was to remain between us. Wouldn’t want to tarnish your reputation by letting people think you’re going around helping Gryffindors.”
“Blimey ‘Mione, let the poor guy breathe!” Ron interrupted, causing Hermione to sit back from where she had been leaning forwards in her seat whilst looking quite embarrassed.
“Draco Bloody Malfoy! McGonagall put you with Malfoy! Doesn’t she know you’re a war hero? You deserve better than this! And I thought getting put with Zabini was bad...”
I am really busy atm with work but I will be trying my best to get these chapters out as quickly as possible. I don't currently know how long this fic will be. I have lots I want to include but I'm not sure when. I'm going to do my best to make it long however each individual chapter may not be so long, depending on what time I have to write.
Draco looked up to see the intense green gaze of Potter again, who had just spoken and was clearly waiting for a response.
“Leave off, Malfoy. I was just thinking about something.”
Almost as if they had sensed they were being spoken about, Pansy, Draco, Blaise, Greg and Theo Nott walked into the Great Hall, all laughing quite loudly but going silent as soon as they realised that they were being watched.
Malfoy tried to put Harry’s arm over his shoulder so he could support his weight, but their height difference made this tricky. Harry’s alcohol-addled brain told him that the logical solution was to lean into Malfoy and wrap his arms around him like some oversized Koala. Harry thought his genius solution was working perfectly however Malfoy seemed to think that being forced sideways by Harry wasn’t actually their goal and sighed deeply before turning towards Harry and scooping him up in a sort of fireman’s carry.
When Amy and Draco arrived in the bedroom, their faces cleaned and looking very ashamed of themselves, they announced the kitchen was clean.
"Stand up," he orders. You obey immediately, standing tall and proud in front of him. "Now, go wash of your face in the bathroom, then make us dinner, Girl."
Draco whined in frustration.
"I'm very close to being sorry."
Draco and Harry read over the list. "Starting tomorrow?" Harry asked.
Blaise hooted, "Gryffindor colors. Harry I love that you did that."
Harry gave Draco an odd look, but didn't wait. Instead he opened the door and saw the exact same jumble of clothes, the same mess that had made Harry order Draco to clean out his closet just weeks ago.
"Hello, Harry," Blaise said. "Your husband is a bit drunk."
You pull of the dress and kick off the shoes, making sure to fold them neatly. You get to the corner and face it. Draco continues, "You must learn to call us Master Draco and Master Harry, am I clear?"
"Can you come back after the wedding?" Harry asked. "I figured you can be here when I take the belt off Draco."
"Oh don't make him sorry," Blaise said. "I think it's fabulous. Someone trying to tame the beast of Draco Malfoy's sense of entitlement. He's always been a nasty little bitch and I'm sure he's deserved every last spanking and punishment you've doled out, Harry."
"Yes Master Harry," you say and you lay yourself over his knees.
He slaps you lightly across the face, "Best go get ready."
Ted went to his room and grabbed two paddles, handing one to Harry. They had Draco and Amy each lean over opposite arms of the couch, as they took the paddles to their asses. Harry didn't often use a paddle, because it didn't take long for a paddling to cause real bruising and you couldn't paddle for long periods of time. Therefore he took several seconds between each whack of the paddle across Draco's backside.
"Are you done your work yet?" Draco asked, draping himself over the couch in the office.
"Who is allowed to say whether I can touch you?"
"Master Draco!" You correct yourself quickly.
You walk naked down the stair and meet the Masters in the kitchen where Harry is making breakfast. "Let me see your backside," he orders. You turn and he touches you lightly. "A little bruising," he said.
Harry and Blaise kissed again, this time facing each other, letting their hands roam across the other's body and stroking their cocks. Eventually, Harry wound up on his back, legs spread with Blaise in between them. Blaise waved his wand and a condom magically appeared in his hands. He put a lubing spell on Harry's asshole and once he got the condom on, another lubing spell on his own cock.
You lean back onto your heels and say, "Thank you Master." His come is dripping in front of your eyes.
"And you understand that you are at no time allowed to come without our permission?"
Harry and Blaise alternated silently for "Five, Six, Seven, Eight!" at which point, Draco started crying.
You are humiliated that your food is in a dog bowl with a bowl of water next to it. You kneel down gently and stick your face in the bowl. It's a saucy noodle dish with vegetables and chicken. You began eating, knowing you aren't allowed to use your hands. You feel a full body blush when Harry and Draco laugh at you, "Look at that Girl," they sneer. "Eating like the fucking bitch she is." Or saying things like, "She's not even worth a place at the table, not even worth a plate!" When you drink out of the bowl it made you cough and they just laugh at you.
"Yeah, did you get this at the Cat in Heat? That sex shop in the bowels of Diagon Alley?"
"We will let you come occasionally."
"And remember," Ted said. "Madame Kat's number one rule is that safewords are respected."
"But you're letting me do it."
"Morning," Draco looked frazzled. "I'm having trouble cutting this bread evenly. I was going to make you a sandwich for lunch."
"Don't be scared," Amy whispered to Draco. "I've done it before and I know you can make it through."
"Two spanks for each rule broken. That's a total of four," Harry said, though he was unsure if that was correct. "And, uh, you need to count along, OK Draco?"
"Yes sir," Draco said.
"Girl," Draco says. "Come kneel in front of me."
"Don't talk to me while I'm reading the paper," Draco orders.
Harry went to the dining room and started reading The Prophet, while waiting for Draco to clean up, get dinner and serve him. Draco came into the room, his face looking freshly scrubbed, "Um, Harry?"
"Silence, you fucking cow. I don't want to hear any of your fucking apologies right now. You acted like a dirty little slut who doesn't care about us, and that's how we're going to treat you," Harry says.
You nod your head.
4-Draco will have a budget for household supplies, Harry is in charge of doling out money.
You nod.
While they ate, Blaise went into further detail about his time at the dominatrix so that when they were done, Harry was already feeling really horny.
He stood up and pushed Draco into position over the desk, the same position he'd just been in. But rather than spanking him, he cast a quick lubing charm on Draco's ass and on his dick and pressed himself into Draco's quivering and waiting asshole.
They got to Madame Kat's club fashionably late that same Saturday. They gave the password, and Madame Kat let them in. As first-timers, she gave them the tour. The club was separated into two rooms. The first room was large, dimly lit (but not dark), and filled with all manner of beds and couches and plush pillows on the ground. People were having sex in the open. Harry and Draco walked through, taking in the sights of a woman on her knees on a bed getting slammed from behind, while deep-throating a large cock in front of her. On the same bed, a woman wearing a strap-on was pegging a man who was loudly asking her to go harder and faster.
"Come here and lie across my lap."
You don't know what to do because truly you want to be a good girl and be perfectly submissive for your Masters. But on the other hand, Ronald has the most beautiful cock you've ever seen and you don't know if you'll ever get another hour alone with him to have your way with it.
He glanced at Draco who was holding the box with the belt in it and who was staring wide-eyed at Blaise.
Draco nodded in understanding.
"Now, Master Harry and I want to sleep in, which means we don't want you to wake us to take you outside to go to the bathroom in the morning, have I made myself clear?"
"Of course, and it's all terrible," Draco answers. Harry laughs. You imagine this is how their morning routine always is, with Harry cooking whilst Draco reads the paper and complains about the day's news. Harry sits and you serve up the breakfast he made. Eggs with toast and fruit salad. You stand there and wait for permission to each.
"Yes Master Draco," you say. You stand up and gather the strewn clothes, fold them quickly and Master Draco says, "You call that folding? I want them folded NEATLY," he barks.
Ronald groaned, "Oh God. I can barely wait to be in you."
"Oh no," Draco said. "I'm sorry, but cleaning toilets is disgusting work."
"Yes Master Draco," you say.
"Rule seven," Harry commanded.
Harry rolled Draco onto his back, and kissed him deeply.
"Torture how?" Draco asked, sitting up straighter.
Draco nodded, "As you wish, sir."
Harry and Draco look at each other and Draco says with a smile, "How about Master Draco and Master Harry?"
The next night, Harry was getting antsy. It was getting late, well past when he thought Draco would be home and certainly very late to begin cooking a real dinner. There had been no word from Draco, no owl saying he was going to be late. No owl asking for permission to stay out late or asking Harry to please being prepping dinner. Harry glanced at the kitchen. He supposed he could start something, and tack on a punishment for Draco not only being late, but for leaving dinner prep to Harry. He was definitely breaking house rules.
"I'm a dirty Girl," you say. "I love giving head, especially to my Masters. Especially to Master Draco and Master Harry. I live to serve you and your cocks."
Draco climbed into his cage and Harry handcuffed him to one of the bars. Just a few feet away, Ted was handcuffing Amy to her own cage. Harry undressed down to his underwear and sat on the chair in front of Draco's cage and waited.
Draco rooted through the closet and brought out a white shirt, handing it to Harry. Harry tried it on. The sleeves were slightly long, but otherwise it was a good enough fit for under dress robes. Harry handed it back, "I want it perfectly pressed."
Draco did, settling himself in the armchair near the bed, not taking his eyes off his husband and his best friend embracing and dry humping each other.
"Come upstairs," Harry said in a gentle voice, leading Draco upstairs to their large shared bedroom. "Now that was my only white dress shirt, but you and I are close enough in size and you have a much bigger wardrobe, so I'll just borrow one of yours."
"I say when you can come."
"And why is that?"
You hang your head in shame. Draco patted the floor. "Lie down," he said.
"MMM," you say, around Harry's cock.
Draco looked appropriately shamed and went to grab his wand to clean the remainder of the dust. Harry stopped him. Harry waved his wand and a small handbroom and dustpan appeared in his hand. He handed them over to Draco and said, "You'll get on your hands and knees and sweep it up the muggle way."
He was just attempting to decide what he should wear (something that was immensely difficult when you suddenly had double the number of clothes) when he heard a knock at the door followed by a sharp “Potter have you managed to dress yourself yet?”
Harry quickly found the mug that belonged to him. It was a deep midnight blue and had gold enchanted snitch and quidditch brooms flying around with a large ‘H P’ on one side.
“He’s a meercat. Which aren’t all that dissimilar from ferrets. Hence, you are most similar to Timon.”
“The evil one”
He’d teared up at the time when he saw the label had Lupin written on it in smudged ink. It was slightly too large for his short frame and had a couple of tiny holes in the cuffs but he felt comfort in it nonetheless. With the exception of the map, the cloak and the photo album from Hagrid, Harry didn’t really have any belongings to connect him to his parents and, whilst Remus isn’t a blood relative, he always acted like a father to Harry. Despite almost solely wearing hand-me-downs his entire life, Harry was glad for once that his clothes were preloved.
They finished the rest of the meal relatively quickly. Harry was walking out the Great Hall behind Ron and Hermione when he felt a tap on his arm. He turned to see Pansy stood behind him. She looked more friendly than she had at the meal. More genuine and relaxed. Harry turned back to Ron and Hermione to tell them to go ahead without him, but they already had, clearly so deep into their conversation that they hadn’t noticed that there was one less pair of footsteps echoing up the stairs.
The rest of lunch passed without Harry having to talk to Malfoy or any of the other Slytherins although now instead of just thinking about Malfoy’s hands, his brain was stuck on ‘foreplay with Malfoy’ which didn’t bode well for Harry’s attempts to forget about the blonde git.
she was satisfied by this. Harry just found himself glad that Malfoy seemed to be as unaware of what Pansy was on about as he was.
He tried to leave their room as quietly as he could – he really didn’t want to deal with a snarky Malfoy at this obscene hour – and headed down to the common room. One of the perks of their space being just for Eighth years was that they had a miniature kitchen space in the corner. There were only really a couple of kettles and a machine for making coffee however for the students who had not grown up around muggle appliances, these were daunting enough to use. It had provided quite good entertainment for the muggle-borns and half-bloods on the first day watching all the purebloods attempt to figure out how to get the kettle to work.
They both laughed before settling into a strangely comfortable silence. Harry was surprised at how easy it was to joke with Pansy. She had always seemed like the sort of person who could give but not receive insults and would be insulted the instant somebody insinuated something negative about her. It was a pleasant contrast to the somewhat sad and disappointed looks he received from Hermione when he was particularly sarcastic. He loved Hermione but she wasn’t always the best at taking jokes, especially around sensitive subject matters like the war.
“Crikey Harry” started Anthony Goldstein, “when did you have time to do all this?”
“Dean and I-” Seamus started.
“I’m aware that many of you spent the past year or more fighting in a war and will have defence skills that students taking their NEWTS under normal circumstances could only dream of. One or two of you could probably just do my job for me and teach the rest of your peers. But just because you’ve gotten proficient with jinxes the past year, you might not be as quick and powerful when it comes to shield charms or vice versa. Some of you might be great at understanding the theory, but struggle to put those ideas into practice. My job for the next year is to make sure you’re all talented at all aspects of the DADA curriculum and for some of you, beyond the curriculum. I’m aware that your study of this subject over the past 7 years has been disjointed and, to put it bluntly, downright crap in some areas.” She let out a small chuckle under her breath and continued. “Whilst I know that one more year with another new teacher isn’t going to stop your education from being disjointed, I’m relying on you all working with each other as well to make this year go as smoothly as possibly. Think of me more as a guide to help you target the areas that you as a collective but also you as an individual think you need the most work on. With that said, I am now going to give you your first task; write down on a piece of scrap parchment your name, a specific topic, spell or area of the course you feel the most confident in and the one which you feel the least confident in. Once you’ve done that, leave them at the end of your desk and I’ll collect them all from you at the end of the lesson.”
He sighed, realising that nobody was going to save him, and put down his pumpkin juice. “What exactly is it you want to know, Parkinson?”
Draco sat down at the Eighth Year dinner table. Unfortunately, on the opposite side of the table was one Harry Potter who was currently staring Draco down with the his incredibly bright green eyes. Draco did his best to ignore this and turned to Pansy who was sat next to him.
Hermione shot Zabini a smile before pulling Harry into a hug.
“No foreplay at the table, boys.”
“Clothes, Potter.”
As a result, Harry was forced to sit through lunch hearing about a party he didn’t want to attend and eating lots of food so he had enough energy to even be awake for said party.
“Clearly I am Mufasa. Wise and important.”
“But Harry he’s a Death Eater.”
“Are you alright Potter? Is Weasley’s idiocrasy rubbing off on you?”
“You two do realise that you’re comparing each other to the 2 characters that
Harry hadn’t had any lessons with Malfoy that day so the next time he saw him was in the Great Hall for dinner. Malfoy, Pansy and Zabini seemed to be surrounded by Gryffindors at the Eighth Year table, with Malfoy looking thoroughly unimpressed by this, and Harry wasn’t sure if him going over and sitting by him would make his mood better or worse. Before he could plan somewhere else to sit, he was spotted by the group so headed over and ended up on the bench directly opposite Malfoy.
Throughout the rest of the day, Harry had noticed the effects of their film morning bonding. In Charms, almost half the pairs were now made up of students in different houses and in Herbology everyone seemed much more ready to help each other out.
Harry supposed that she was still struggling after the war. For a long time, nobody knew what had happened to her after her attack. Some people speculated that she had died whereas some said she was fine but had moved abroad. When she had come back to school, it had caused quite a stir but nobody asked her about it so Harry never really found out what happened.
After the war, this had been a rather difficult task for Harry as closing his eyes just gave his brain to play a morbid slideshow of all the horrors he witnessed during the war. Hermione’s screams at Malfoy Manor. The sight of Fred’s lifeless body on the floor of the Great Hall surrounded by sobbing Weasleys. Sometimes he took a potion to help him but most of the time he just let the memories play, knowing eventually exhaustion would take over and he would sleep.
I wish I could say it will be lighthearted from here on out but knowing me it probably won't be. BUT if all goes according to plan, the angsty bits should be 15% of the fic at most. Hopefully, this is the last of the angsty sad content for a while.
Zabini and Pansy were both talking to each other secretively in low voices, glancing around the circle every now and then. They both suddenly were looking at Harry and smirking.
“I didn’t know this was here! How have I never seen this shop before?”
The sleeve Harry knew concealed the dark mark.
“That? Don’t worry about it mate. Truth be told, summer was so crazy and we were all trying to deal with our own grief and emotions as best we could that it’s hardly surprising that we don’t know every little thing the other did. We’re never gonna be mad at you for keeping secrets from us. Just so long as you know there’s nothing you feel you
Only Harry seemed to notice the small grateful smile Anthony gave Malfoy as the rest of the group had gone into a fierce debate on teen drinking.
“Obviously we weren’t talking about that part of them though. Nobody said we were
“Well, we know you and the she-weasel broke up. I’m pretty sure everyone in within Wizarding Britain knows that. Merlin knows the Daily Prophet went on about it for a solid month. Although I suppose what with you eradicating all evil from the world, you have rather cruelly robbed them of all news-worthy stories so it really is the least you could do.”
“Yeah, maybe the Slytherins won’t act like such dickheads this year.”
“Sorry I-” Harry stammered, suddenly noticing the scars he caused on Draco’s torso back in Sixth Year. “I’m sorry Malfoy.”
“God Harry, you really are dense sometimes.”
He thought, as he walked up the stairs, that that was probably the record amount of time he and Malfoy had spent in a room together without arguing. And whilst awake. Although Harry didn’t think he would be surprised if Malfoy argued in his sleep.
Harry still didn’t know what to say.
Although Harry hadn’t seen who else had drunk, from the fact that most of the reactions seemed to be about him he guessed it wasn’t many others or at least nobody surprising.
Feel free to comment on any constructive criticism, ideas for where you want or think the story should go or any OCs you want to have a cameo and I'll do my best to take it on board.
Malfoy still didn’t say anything so Harry kept talking.
“No”, Zabini replied softly. “It was just that. Everyone was ready to murder Roger after he asked, you went to bed and Pansy made everyone magically swear not to mention it to anyone else outside the room. Nothing else was said other than the fact it happened.”
“I’m not a girl!”
He blamed the sheer amount of alcohol he had consumed thus far and the momentum of the game on the next question. Of course, he also blamed Roger Malone who asked the question. Either Hufflepuffs weren’t as friendly as he thought or Roger was just incredibly tone-deaf. Either way, it was this combination of things that led to Harry drinking after “Never have I ever been physically abused.”
Draco turned from the corner and silently and obediently went to the bed and lay face down. Harry grabbed several pillows and handed them to Draco. "Put these under your midsection to raise your backside."
When he was done, the Dom took his three little cocksluts and left the club.
Harry, looking at Draco, said back, "Your ass is amazing, Ted. The tightest asshole I've ever had." He began thrusting.
"Draco?" Harry asked.
"Yes sirs," Draco nodded. "I am going to do better in the future. Thank you Blaise, for helping Harry help me become a better person."
Draco nodded. "Tomorrow."
Draco was still sitting in the chair, his hand over his dick overtop the chastity belt and rutting frantically into it. He couldn't get his hand into the belt to masturbate properly.
Draco went to bed that night, thinking about this argument he and Harry had. He knew in his heart of hearts that Harry was right. He was an asshole, and that's because his parents had let him be one his whole life. And now that he was an adult he had no idea how to stop being so selfish.
"Yes Master Harry."
"We definitely want to display the Girl so that Hermione sees her right when she comes in the house," Draco said to Harry. They were trying to decide what to do with you, how to present you as their Girl to Hermione.
Draco stood up and sat gently on the chair.
Harry came back into the Parlor and says, "it's dinner time, Girl." He unhooks you and helps you stand straight as the blood rushes back to your extremities. You follow him into the kitchen. "You eat there," Harry said, pointing to the floor.
You follow them up the stairs. They point you to a bathroom down the hall and tell you to use it, wash up and come to them in their bedroom. You use the toilet, then wash your face and brush your teeth. You stick a quick finger in your vagina and realize you're still quite wet. You wonder if your Masters plan on allowing you to orgasm. You aren't sure what you want. Of course, orgasming is wonderful, but there is something deliciously terrible about being denied what you want the most. It brings out the beggar in you, something your former Dom loved to do.
When Harry knew he had a court date for an arrest he made, one evening he asked Draco to please press his dress robes, as well as a white collared shirt to wear underneath. Pressing clothes was a chore that hadn't been done by Draco at all. Harry was going over his notes in his study, when he heard Draco curse loudly, and then say "Oh no."
From their last two times having threesomes with Blaise, Harry had learned that Blaise had the biggest cock of anyone he knew. And Merlin's Balls, did he know how to use it. Blaise oozed a sexiness and confidence that Harry had never had, up until he became a dominant.
"Come to the dining room," Harry instructed. "Your punishment isn't over yet."
"Unless I'm a good little boy from now on," Draco said.
Draco sat at his seat and winced. "If it hurts too much, you may stand to eat," Harry said.
"No Master Draco. It won't happen again."
"Yes!" Draco said.
"Right, so the thing with this chastity belt is that you can't get hard and you can't come. But, you can still feel really horny. So I was wearing this, and she's making me do all these things to her like lick her pussy, or put on a strap-on and peg her. And, Merlin's pants, I could feel it. I could feel like I wanted to come so bad, you know that feeling in your balls? It was like that, and I kept rubbing myself over the belt and the friction felt so great and so awful all at once. And I wore this the entire weekend. I was spanked, and had hot wax poured on me and wore a collar and watched as Kat and her friend had sex in front of me and I just couldn't come. For a full forty eight hours. Then, like ten minutes before it was time to leave, she pulled off the belt and I came harder than I've ever come before and then she threw my clothes at me, called me a dirty slut and told me to get out of her dungeon."
"What if I order you to?"
Draco grinned "Yes Harry."
He pulled his underwear up, but removed the rest of his clothes completely. He went over to where Ted was just finishing up with Draco. Draco's ass was bright red and he had tears running down his face.
"This is punishment," Harry reminded Draco. "I know how much you enjoy sucking cock."
WEEKEND TWO
"Sorry," Draco mumbled, not sounding very sorry at all. Well, this was going to add to his punishment time!
He got so engrossed in his work, he momentarily forgot about Draco all alone in the bedroom and standing in the corner. Before he realized it, he figured out Draco had been standing in one position with nothing to look at but the plain corner for well over an hour! Harry hurried to the bedroom to find Draco still standing, like a good boy.
"It's OK, Babe," Harry said soothingly. "You aren't going to get punished for this." He went to Draco and hugged him, stroking his hair. "You tried your best, and this was a new chore for you."
Things get really heated when Blaise Zabini comes to town.
At long last, after what seems like a half hour, the spanking stops. "Stand," Draco orders.
"Do you need the safe word."
Harry stayed inside Draco for another few moments, completely still but for the quivering they were both doing. Finally without warning, he started thrusting. And he didn't start slowly, he immediately went for a  fast and punishing speed. Oh gods this wasn't going to take him long. He wanted Draco to come first, so he could feel the delicious squeeze of Draco's sphincter muscles around his cock. Harry reached his hand around Draco's body and took hold of his cock and started stroking to the same rhythm.
Everything was silent for a full second before Harry marched over and pulled Draco forcefully from Amy. His penis, still erect and with a condom on, slipped out of her pussy. Without taking his pants off, or pulling them back up, Harry walked Draco back to the parlor. "Pants off," he demanded.
Blaise settled himself in between Draco's legs and opened his mouth on the outside of the chastity belt, taking Draco's soft cock and balls into his mouth at once. Draco let out a high pitched whine, because no matter how good it felt, there was nothing that would give him an erection, much less allow him to come.
"Yes sir," Draco said.
"Well obviously it's not bad enough to make you sorry." Harry and Blaise quickly went through eight more spankings (four each) as Draco gasped and cried as he called out their numbers. At this point, Draco's ass was extremely red.
When she started to fill the other glasses Ted stopped her. "You two don't deserve wine. You'll drink water with your dinner."
Harry raised his wand and conjured a switch. He used it on the side of Draco's thigh. Draco's eyes went wide, but his hips lay flat on the bed.
You feel that cock pressed against your abdomen and you can feel it growing hard and digging into you. You pull back a little and finally get your hands on it and start stroking. But Gods is his skin soft as it moves against the rock hard shaft. "Do you know what a magnificent tool you have?" you ask him.
"May I clean my face first?" You ask.
"I'm being punished," Draco said. And he turned to look at Harry, "I deserve to be punished." He and Harry made eye contact as the Dom let loose a long stream of urine that caught Draco in the knees and dripped its way down his legs.
"I did," Draco said. "And Harry I've been bad tonight."
"Of course not," he chuckles, "She is a sub after all. She knows she's beneath us."
Draco lay down, his ass facing up. "Face up," Harry corrected and Draco rolled over. Harry grabbed a couple of ties out of his closet and he and Blaise each tied one of Draco's wrists to the bed posts.
You can't wait for next weekend!
"Yes Master Draco," You said as you make your way to the bathroom. You don't want to tell him, but you're a bit disappointed in your first spanking. You're used to much harder. But then, maybe your new Masters are easing you into something much more hardcore.
You follow Harry into the kitchen, Draco on your heels. You wonder if Draco knows what Harry is planning.
"Yes, Master Harry," You say.
5-Draco gets an allowance for personal items and must not go over his monthly allowance.
"Well," Harry said. "What do you have to say."
Draco shrugged, "It's a process I guess."
Blaise was licking his lips as Draco began undressing and reciting which rules he'd broken. "I broke the rules about serving you dinner. I broke the rule about my personal allowance. I broke the rule about your authority."
"Yes sir," Draco said. Harry still loved how Draco reverted to calling him Sir when a punishment was afoot.
The Dom wiped some of the come off Draco's face with his hands, then held the hands out for Draco to lick clean, which Draco did happily. "You're a disgusting little cum slut, aren't you? You love the taste of come."
"Now give me a kiss goodbye."
Hermione gets a slightly angry look on her face and looks you right in the eye as she lightly slaps you across the face. You realize what you've done. "Listen Girl," she says in a stern voice. "When I asked if I could touch, who do you think I was talking to?"
"Excuse you!" Harry roared. "Who are you talking to?"
"Make some coffee, please," Harry say pointing to the coffee pot.
When Draco was done the dishes, he joined Harry in the parlor. "Let me see your ass," Harry demanded.
Harry turned and saw Blaises mouth still around Draco's crotch, and Draco frantically humping his way into Blaise's mouth. Harry laughed, "It's not going to work, Draco. You can stop trying."
"Yes," Harry said. "Don't you think you deserve a punishment?"
Harry bent back over the desk and presented his ass to Draco. "I will give him five spanks."
"We were fucking without your permission," Draco said.
Ted met them at the door and took their cloaks. They sat down and Amy, wearing a short mini-skirt and white tank top with nothing underneath, served them drinks. Harry shifted in his seat, seeing Amy's beautiful nipples peaking under the tight shirt. "Let Draco help Amy with dinner," Harry offered.
Harry immediately dropped to his knees and took Blaise's cock into his mouth. Because of the size, he could only take about half of it, but he opened as wide as he could and took as much as possible, using his hand to stroke from Blaise's pubic hair to where his mouth couldn't reach.
Then you remember you aren't permitted to come for the next forty eight hours and it's agony to think.
It's a wooden contraptions designed for you to be attached to it. Your arms tied to the top and hang down just at your eye line, and your ankles are spread and attached to the bottom. Two wooden seats are there to go behind your knees so you are in a seated position, though nothing was holding your ass up and your legs are spread wide. You are completely open and exposed.
You do, thinking you are going to give another blow job, but instead, Draco uses you as a footstool. He raises his legs and rests them on your lower back, but only after he asks you to face the other way, so your backside is facing him and you are facing out. That's the ultimate ignore, as now neither Master is even looking in your eyes. The minutes crawl by and your arms and knees are starting to ache. You do your very best to stay as still as possible, after all mere furniture doesn't move, and that's all you are in their eyes at this moment. An object - a piece of furniture designed for their own comfort.
Seconds later, it's as though your Masters are thinking as one and they come at the same time. Draco lets his load shoot straight down your throat, and you swallow his semen gratefully. You can feel Harry's cock spurting inside your already wet cunt.
"Yes Master. But I've just thought we were easing into it."
"Yes Master Harry!" you say.
Draco was hesitant and didn't move. Harry stood up and flipped Draco over on the couch so his bruised and welted ass was in the air. Harry brought his hand down as hard as he could over Draco's ass, making Draco cry out. "Stand up!" he said.
The next morning, Harry awoke to find Draco with his eyes already opened.
"Will two hours of corner time do it?"
"I know," Harry said. "I hope you never do anything that requires the cage again."
"Thank you, Draco," Harry said, carefully replacing the paperwork in the folders and getting up to follow Draco to the dining room.
"Do it, if you need to go now."
Harry and Ted retired to the bedroom, awaiting their subs for additional punishment.
"Five," Harry said. "And you need to count." A belt hurt worse then a hand, and Harry knew it would take fewer swats to get his punishment across.
Harry snuggled in close and kissed Draco on the shoulder. "I'm very proud of you, pet."
"You'll love it," Blaise said. "I can fill you up like you've never been filled before."
"I have something to say first," Ronald says.
And after all, you have Ronald to look forward to next weekend.
"Babe," Draco said one night. They had finished dinner and Harry had done the dishes. They retired to the parlor where Harry was setting up a chess set. "Let's not play chess, there's something I want to talk about."
You gulp and Ronald makes eye contact with you, looking sorry. You simply give him a little nod to let him know it's OK. You can handle a punishment. But your eyes widen when two riding crops are brought out. Draco is working you over, Harry is with Ronald.
"Get in there and finish dinner," Ted ordered. "Harry and I will be in the dining room waiting your service."
"Now," Hermione says, standing in front of you after she got her clothes back on. "You two are going to have a contest. Whoever can hold their piss the longest wins. The loser takes an extra punishment.
Harry serves breakfast this time, but only him and Draco. "Girl, you will eat when we're done," he says. "We want to look at the view while we eat."
"Trust me when I say to keep the chastity belt on until the last moment," Blaise said.
"What about domestic discipline?"
"Yes," you say, then pause. "What should I call you? Do you prefer Sir, or Master?"
Harry and Draco were both men with very high libidos. They could fuck two or three times a day happily, and if they only fucked once (or even not at all!) they felt unfulfilled. Bringing other people into their bed was helpful. Blaise, of course, took a tumble with them when he was in town. Before she got married, Luna Lovegood used to come around to get double penetrated by Harry and Draco.
Draco nodded, tears starting to prick at the corners of his eyes.
"Maybe it'll have to be harder next time?" Harry asked, with a huskey voice.
Harry sighed, "What is it? Besides being late and not cooking dinner for me?"
"So do I," Harry answered. "You need to suck me."
"You aren't going to be able to come," Blaise said, laughing at Draco. "It doesn't matter how much you touch it."
Blaise looked at Harry who nodded encouragingly. Blaise brought his arm up and let it loose, harder than before on Draco's ass. "Nine," Draco said, his voice strained.
"Rule one, 'Every day Harry will give at least one cleaning chore for Draco to do. It must be done by the time Harry gets home from work.' Rule Seven, 'Draco is to respect Harry's ultimate authority in the household and willingly submit to any disciplinary acts that Harry deems necessary.'"
Harry glanced over to Ted and Amy and saw Amy in her cage being fucked from behind, her large tits already had welt on them from what looked like being switched. Her tits were swinging too and fro as the man behind her savagely thrust as hard and fast as he could. Ted, in front of the cage, was being ridden by a woman, obviously the sub of the man in the cage with Amy, who was covered from head to toe in loose black clothing, with only her eyes, tits, cunt and ass areas exposed. Harry considered forcing Draco to cover completely except for his cock and ass next time they came here to the BDSM room.
"You're such a pretty little cocksucker," Blaise said. Those words set off Draco's hips in a thrusting action.
He turned to walk back into the kitchen. Harry could see the redness of Draco's ass was starting to settle into a light purple bruising. It looked good and sexy, and it made Harry feel incredibly powerful that he's the one who put that mark on that beautiful pale ass.
"Two!" A second crack, then "Three!" as the third hit him. He already was showing beautiful stripes across his rear, which sent a rush of blood to Harry's cock.
"No, Master Harry."
"Yes Master," you say.
They finish right about the same time that you and Ronald finish off the entire pitcher of water. You can already feel a pressure on your bladder, but you rememeber Hermione's instruction not to piss so you hold it.
"Correct. When I said you have glorious breasts, who do those breasts belong to when you're in this house?"
"A couple of rules," Harry said. "No sleeping with him when I'm not there and be home in time for dinner with me."
"Very nervous about tonight," Draco admitted.  "Amy and I've talked about it, and she said that the punishment cages get pretty scary and intense."
Draco let out a sob. His cock went from erect and dripping to flaccid immediately as the loincloth device was pulled up his hips. It didn't matter how flaccid he was, Harry knew he still felt like he was on the brink of coming, but nothing could get through the cloth. Amy was having a similar reaction.
"I'm going to spank this whore," Harry said. "I want you to watch."
"What do you say to Ted?"
When Draco returned with the shirt looking perfect, Harry took it and silently hung it up in his own closet, ready to wear for the next day. Then he turned to Draco, who looked apprehensive about what was going to happen.
"Thank you for giving me a punishment I deserved, Ted, sir."
Harry raised an eyebrow. "I think you get plenty. You're the one who wanted to work on budgeting."
"Her mother came to visit us last week for a few days and we had to pretend to be vanilla. She really hated it. I thought perhaps she was starting to regret our discipline arrangement, but rather she said that it's because she hates that she feels she cant' be herself in front of her own mother. It did make her sad."
"Mmm-hmm," Blaise murmured, his mouth still stuffed with Harry's dripping erection.
You lose track of time before The Masters come and untie the two of you. They are gentle, giving you both a lot of tender care and rubbing your wrists and legs to get the blood flowing again. "You both did really well," they say. "We will continue punishment tomorrow. Let's get ready for bed."
"Morning," Draco said. He was staring at the ceiling.
Draco stood, his lips trembling. "Do you still think spanking is only for us to do to each other?"
Harry had to use a lot of kind words and reassurances to let Draco know that wouldn't happen. He loved this lifestyle, and besides nobody is perfect and that means even without meaning to, every sub is going to screw up and do something that requires a punishment.
Harry licked his lips and turned to Draco, "Um. Didn't I ask you to clean this out?"
"Well, I was ordered to call him Sir. Sir was a very well known Dom in the kink community and he had five subs at any given time. Often there were two or three of us with him on my weekends there, but sometimes it was just me and Sir. Sir had a very rough hand and was a very demanding Dom."
Draco leaves and brings Harry in. "Sit at the table, Girl," Draco orders. "And talk to us."
"You aren't acting very sorry," Harry said, sitting on the couch and pulling Draco over his knee, swatting his ass several times. Draco's ass went from pink to red to a deep dark red that Harry hadn't yet seen. He stopped out of fear he'd break Draco's skin.
"I will clean the toilets today," Draco said. "It's my pleasure to serve you."
"Come!" Harry ordered, and right on cue, semen burst from the end of Draco's dick as he shouted "Yes, oh god, yes Harry!"
Harry didn't like the attitude, and pulled Draco toward him harshly and laid three loud smacks across his ass, which was still red from earlier in the day.
Draco shrugged and went back in, flattening his tongue fully against her swollen clit. The Dom moaned, and her sub had stuck her hand behind the strap on and was fingering herself. The Dom looked up and saw what was happening. "Wait," she panted and Draco stopped.
"Yes, I think I will," Draco said and stood back up.
"That's how our's started too!" Ted said, sounding excited. "This little pet just wanted to be a good submissive housewife and asked me to spank her when she needed it. And now....here we are!"
"Harry," Draco whispered.
The Masters have a whispered conversation before Draco leaves the room and Harry puts scrambled eggs and sausage in one bowl for you, cut up fruit in another, and water in yet another. "Eat your breakfast, Girl," he orders. You sink to your knees, the diaper high in the air and stick your face in the bowls eating your breakfast.
Draco did as he was told as Harry removed the leather belt from around his pants. Harry heard the hitch in Draco's breath, knowing that this was not going to be any normal spanking, but he was going to be belted. Harry held the two ends of the belt together and snapped the leather together. At the snapping sound, Draco's ass lifted a little higher off the pillow, as though he was instinctively searching for the pain.
"Why?" you ask. "Do you like a harsher punishment? Or some other reason?"
On Sunday at breakfast, the Masters tell you about their friends named Ron and Hermione.
"The lady who owns that, Kat Wellington, is a dominatrix. I paid a pretty penny for a whole weekend with her and she had me wearing that the entire time and it was absolute torture."
When Harry had bought the chastity device from Madame Kat at The Cat in Heat in Diagon Alley, she mentioned that she ran a sex club every Saturday night. it was a free-for-all in terms of sexual activity, plus a separate section for those interested in BDSM. She thought Harry and Draco might be interested in that.
Time passes by and eventually they are done their work and got you out of your chair. You left a small wet spot where your pussy had dripped and Draco notices it. "Looks like this slut enjoys sitting in a hard chair all exposed for her Masters."
You and Ronald are left there for a very long time to just sit and stare at each other. Your gag is starting to get soaked from your saliva and your bondages are really hurting, but you do not clear your throat. The best thing about all this is seeing Ronald's penis. It stays erect the entire time, even dripping a little precum, and you're sure it's because he is so turned on seeing you sitting there with your huge tits and your legs spread open showing your pulsating pink pussy.
"You're very welcome," Harry smiled at his submissive husband benevolently. They turned their attention to the closet, where they devised a plan for Draco to clean it out over the next two days.
Because god did he want to come. And even though he knew he wanted to, he hadn't earned that right yet.
"I'm so sorry!" Draco said, looking extremely worried. "I used too much heat for this shirt material, and I didn't mean to. I....I..."
Ronald is silent.
Whilst you are standing against the wall with your legs spread, Draco looks down into his glass, then up at you, then down into your glass again. A slow smile spreads across his face. "Girl, come here."
Harry must have realized he didn't hit hard enough to make an impression, because the second spank came just a bit harder. "Two!" Draco said.
Harry interrupted him. "Shut the fuck up. I didn't ask for an explanation." He pulled the condom off Draco's dick hard and made Draco hold onto it in his hand.
"i said no."
Finally, Harry says, "Turn around." You turn and they are both looking stern. "What do you have to say for yourself?"
Harry pulled Draco roughly to the floor, "On your hands and knees," he said in his most demanding voice.
"Let's ask Draco," Harry said. "Draco. You may turn around now."
Harry leaned over and gently wiped Draco's face clean. "You need to learn these lessons, pet."
Finally it slowed down, his thrusting slowed down, and when he went soft, Harry and Blaise let go.
Madame Kat left them to walk around and take it all in. "Strip down to your underwear," Harry ordered Draco. They stuck out with Draco being the only dressed sub. Draco did immediately, standing proudly next to Harry with his erect cock jutting far out in front of him.
"Blaise, you're welcome to stay after dinner," Harry said. He glanced at Draco, "Draco's safeword is checkmate."
The cold is unrelenting, and when they ice skirts over your labia, you take a deep breath in. You want something in your pussy right now and you can barely stand it. Your body is freezing as the ice cubes continue to move all over your body, around your neck and arms, and over the mounds of your breasts again. As you squirm you can feel your breasts jiggling and you know the Masters are enjoying watching them bounce. They aren't shy about loving your breasts, which are large G cups. Once again ice is dragged quickly across your genitals and you moan while you continue to shiver and shake and squirm.
You do that, leaning forward and placing your hand on the wall. You know what's coming even before the first blow lands on your ass cheek. This time, they are both spanking you in turn. One spank for Draco, the next for Harry. And so on. These aren't the hardest spanks you've ever taken, but they are harder than what you'd gotten so far this weekend.
"Discipline you how?" Harry asked, suspicious of Draco's plan.
Meanwhile, Harry kept his eye on the cage. The cocksluts' Dom had chosen the hairbrush, and he was ordering Draco to apologize to Harry for his transgressions. "I'm sorry, Sir!" Draco said, and SMACK, one hit on the ass. This Dom was big and muscular and he did not hold back at all as his arm raised and lowered and brought the hairbrush over Draco's ass.
This was the start of a great new life for them.
Draco opened one eye and smiled at his husband, his dominant, and said, "Yes Sir."
"Eleven! Twelve!" Draco counted. "No, this doesn't feel good."
"Yes!" Draco would cry, and he truly meant it. Then he would be bent over, his ass taking the brunt of the punishment. He be pushed to his knees to suck yet another cock, then made to lick feet, swallow come, or taken to Harry and made to beg forgiveness.
You don't use your safeword, because honestly if they did it again that is OK and you will deal with it, but your tears must seem genuine because immediately your Masters know that they need to care for you. When you were getting to know each other, they talked a lot about aftercare, but you prefer being so submissive that most punishments don't require it. But, you  had said back then, you will know when I do need it. When I cry not out of pain, but out of sheer giving up.
Draco rushed to the kitchen and grabbed Harry's lunch. "Here's your lunch, Harry."
"Listen, babe." Harry said gently, "Everyone will need help doing things. I'm in charge here, and you don't need to feel ashamed to come to me with questions. I want you to come to me and hopefully I can help you."
"Yes Master Harry."
When you get in the bedroom, the Masters are already embracing, kissing passionately and both of them are now completely naked. You await instructions, and they pat the space in between them, "Come, Girl," Draco says.
Draco, the fake cock still in his mouth nodded. "Good," she sneered. "Word's gotten around that you and the little slut in the other cage were fucking without permission form your doms. Is that right?"
When they got into the kitchen, both Harry and Ted were shocked to see Amy pushed up against the counter, her skirt hitched up to her waist and her legs wrapped around Draco, his pants unzipped and just pushed down past his ass, pounding into her.
"I'll have a safe-word" Draco said. "In case I think the discipline is going too far."
"I'm sorry," Draco whimpered. "I mean please, sir. I need to be touched."
"I know you are," Harry said. He flicked his wand, and Draco's clothes reappeared on the dining room chair. "You can get dressed if you want. But if not, I'll be lying up in our bed, naked and thinking of you washing dishes down here naked."
The Masters decide to have you stand in the middle of the parlor, because certainly Hermione is going to want to see you. You are standing there anxiously when the doorbell rings.
"Once, early on," Ted answered. "She wanted to get the most intense punishment available. She believed if she could survive the cage without using her safe word, that meant she was truly meant to be a submissive wife in every way. Madame Kat agreed."
Harry's eyes widened. This was the first Draco hadn't been contrite about his breaking a rule.
The eighth hit was somehow, even harder than the other's had been, and on Draco's already red ass, it was really starting to sting. As he called out "Eight," the tears flowed down his face. This took Harry aback and he wondered if he needed to stop.
Finally, at long last, Draco stumbled into the house, along with Blaise, and they were carrying bags with take-away in it. It only took seconds for Harry to smell the pad Thai, his favorite. So Draco thought he could butter up his husband, his dominant, by bringing in his favorite food? And did he think he'd escape punishment because Blaise was there? Because Harry could set up a silencing charm on their room and still bring Draco's ass to bright red welts without Blaise being any the wiser.
"I'm in a rush, Ronald. I just want to have the experience of her mouth on my clit, then I will leave you to be dealt with by Harry and Draco."
"Come here," Harry said. And Draco came, draping himself over Harry's knee. Amy followed suit with Ted.
The Dom looked insulted on Harry's behalf. He walked around the cage, inspecting Draco from every angle. "I see you've already spanked him," he nodded approvingly to Harry.
"It's good you're sorry, but we are really trying to drive," SPANK "This point," SPANK, "Home!" SPANK SPANK SPANK! Those spanks were all from Master Draco, who has a much firmer hand.
"Just like a whore would be," Harry agreed.
Harry wiggled out of his trousers, "Sit on my cock," he ordered Carly.
They were sweaty and spent, Blaise pulling out of Harry's asshole and removing the condom. He tied it off and threw it to the floor. "Go throw that away, Draco," Harry ordered.
"Intense," Harry said. "Our relationship has been a little more about domestic dominance and submission. It's only gotten into the bedroom a few times."
The only relationship all 3 of them seemed convinced of was one they kept referring to as ‘the obvious one’. Harry didn’t know who was ‘the obvious one’ however he guessed it was probably Ron and Hermione. Who else in their year had that much chemistry with another person?
In terms of timeline, Simba’s Pride was released on VHS on October 1998 which is a month later than this scene occurs. For the sake of my fic let's all just assume it came out a few months earlier. Cool? Cool.
“And you think finding out my favourite colour is going to be a
Harry awoke with a start, his blood pounding in his ears. He had been naïve to think that being back at Hogwarts would mean his nightmares went away. He had thought that a familiar location would provide the comfort he needed to finally be able to relax at night. Of course, he hadn’t factored in that this comfortable space was a war zone less than 6 months ago so would most likely worsen his nightmares.
“Merlin help us, Potter has lost the plot completely. Should I contact St Mungos? I’m sure they’ll get a room with padded walls ready for you in no time.”
“Merlin, this is painful to watch,” Malfoy sighed. “Don’t get used to this treatment, Potter, but there’s a hangover potion on your bedside table.”
Draco scoffed at this and wrinkled his nose as his cup of pumpkin juice contained large amounts of pus from a troll.
Pansy interrogates Harry over his love life
The silence continued after the Slytherins sat down and continued for a couple of minutes, everyone eating or just staring off into space. Eventually, Pansy decided to speak up. She had sent all of the members of the Golden Trio letters at the start of the summer, apologising for any part she played in the war.
“It was my Uncle, you know. Not that he would ever want to admit that we were related. At least we weren’t blood relatives. I think I would vomit.”
The film continued mostly in silence (with the exception of a very audible gasp when Kiara suddenly said “You will NEVER be Mufasa” to Simba) until the final fight scene when the lions all realised that they were the same.
“And there’s nobody else you’re attracted to?”
“I would ask what you mean by people knowing without you telling them but Merlin it feels wrong to ask you about it when you’re clearly drunk and have no filter. You’re not even going to remember any of this in the morning. Go to sleep, Potter.”
Eventually, Zabini spoke. “I believe that as Potter didn’t find out the piece of information during the game, he is exempt from the rule preventing the rest of us from speaking about it. So, when he wants to, he will be able to talk to you about it.”
So when it came time for witnesses to come forwards and speak on Malfoy’s behalf, he left the spot where he had been lurking in the corner and made his way towards the middle of the room. Hushed voices filled the room, clearly in shock that The Great Harry Potter wanted to speak on behalf of yet another Malfoy. Even Draco looked surprised.
A few minutes passed before he said; “Why are you sat here, Pansy?”
And Harry did.
“No there’s one more after this one which we must go into.”
The three of them headed down to the Great Hall, Ron and Hermione having a conversation about who knows what whilst Harry got distracted by looking at the castle around him. Every direction he looked he could picture a different student being attacked during the battle. He could hear their screams. He had hoped that after having the summer away from Hogwarts would help him forget about everything he saw but these things rarely went Harry’s way...
"Yes sir," Draco said.
"Stand up," the Dom ordered, and Draco immediately obeyed.
Carly straddled him, position his dick above her entrance. Harry could see how slick and shiny it was. The naughty little thing was turned on by his roughness. She slid down on his cock and began thrusting. Gods, but it had been a while since Harry's cock had probed the depths of a woman's warmth. He thrust in rhythm and reached over instintively to thumb at her clit. She cried out, "I'm not allowed to come!"
Amy gasped out a sob as Draco took a deep breath in. Within seconds both Ted and Harry started spanking their subs' asses. Fifteen minutes might seem like a short time, but when your ass is getting beaten, it goes on forever. SMACK, SMACK, SMACK, over and over again as their asses turned into a light pink, then a deeper pink, and finally a nice deep red.
"Because I wasn't happy with my allowance."
Ted looked at Harry with a raised eyebrow, held his finger to his lips and whispered, "We'd better make sure they're working on dinner."
"So..."Harry says
Draco nodded.
"Oh yeah?" Harry asked. Harry sometimes felt bad for Draco that most of their shared friends had been his friends at Hogwarts. The ones they hung around with regularly, like Ron and Hermione and Ginny and Luna. Blaise was the only Slytherin Draco kept in touch with, and he lived abroad and they didn't see each other often.
"That's a pity," Harry said.
"Two! Three! Four!" he said. Draco wasn't using all his force, so the stings felt mild and pleasurable rather than like real pain. Still, after four there was  definite tingling to his ass, and he knew that the last swat was always the hardest. Draco did not disappoint in making the fifth one twice as hard as the first four and Harry gasped as he called out "Five!"
Harry had never had his cock worshipped and it sounded lovely, so he nodded in agreement. The Dom unhooked the leashes and the three cocksluts crawled toward Harry eagerly. One went up on his knees and pulled Harry's underpants down, Harry's cock now half-hard. They stopped for a few moments and stared reverently at it before pushing him down in his seat and taking it in turns to suck him off. While one was sucking, one was licking his balls and the other working on Harry's nipples. But the biggest turn-on wasn't that. It was what they were saying. "Such a beauty." "What a delicious cock." "Oh, the feel of cock in my mouth!" These men weren't just giving a simple blowjob, there were really and truly savouring every inch of him.
Draco took the shirt and scurried back to the living room to finish his job. Harry stared at Draco's closet. Draco was right, there was so much stuff he could see how it'd be hard to know where to start. But still, the proper thing for a submissive husband to do would be to ask.
That night when Harry got home, he inspected both bathrooms and found them to be sparkling. Draco was still working on dinner, whistling a jaunty tune as he whisked a simple sauce for their chicken.
For the second time that day, the cold hose is turned on you and you are rinsed from the waist down. You can see that Ronald had his own discipline. His ass and down the backs of his thighs are striped with red caning marks. It looks like his Mistress may have even drawn blood.
The Masters leave to the dining room while you get the food to serve them. You take it in and pour them wine, then retire to the kitchen to each by yourself. You don't know if you should take the dress off or not. You decide to leave it on.
Draco returns to the kitchen, "Hermione and Ronald are coming over. You and Ronald are going to have some diaper play, so eat and drink up."
"Ohhhh, yes!" Draco shouted pressing his backside back as far as he could and within seconds, Harry was fully deep into Draco's ass and thrusting as hard as he could.
"Oh yes it is," Draco said. "As is the diaper."
"Yes you may," Master Draco says. "And it's Master Draco."
"Three more," Harry said. "I'm going to do them fast."
After a while in the corner, Master Harry takes you outside to pee before its time for you to go to bed. They allow you to wash your face and drink some water and then show you to a pile of blankets on the floor in the corner of their bedroom. Draco is there waiting for you, holding something white in his hand.
Harry hadn’t been there long when somebody suggested that they play some drinking games. This was met with varying levels of agreement however they ultimately decided that it would be a good idea for helping everyone relax and force some ‘inter-house bonding’. Harry zoned out during the discussion of what game they should play, instead deciding to occupy himself with getting a large glass of firewhiskey. No matter what they chose, he had a feeling that he wouldn’t willingly play unless his inhibitions had already been lowered by some alcohol. Apparently, they had settled on never have I ever and were already starting to arrange themselves in a circle. Harry took the nearest armchair and only when he looked up did, he realise that he was sat directly opposite Malfoy who was flanked on a 3-seater sofa but Pansy and Zabini.
He paused before responding “you can but
“And her best plan was Harry and Malfoy having a year-long sleepover?”
“The Potter family is a pureblood family. Sacred-28 or not, I had to learn your family’s history including your grandfather. I would say I’m surprised nobody ever told you but then again you have been a bit preoccupied over these last few years and whilst Sleakeazy is a miracle worker, I doubt even it would have been able to help you take down You-Know-Who.”
It seemed the group was still discussing the film with Zabini, Seamus and Parvati comparing how attractive the different lions were.
tension that’s just regular tension.”
“Finnegan I’m pretty sure even the muggles in Australia are aware that you and Thomas are shagging. No not you either, Weasley. You and Granger are pretty obviously together as well. I think what we need is some juicy gossip. Someone we don’t already know about like…Potter.”
Zabini walked over slowly, his face trying to hide his confusion behind a façade of nonchalance. “Good morning Potter & Co, to what do I owe the pleasure?”
A/N (08/08/21) - I have edited this chapter slightly so that the abuse mentioned is committed directly by the Dursleys rather than an extra person. Because of this I have changed it from sexual abuse to physical abuse as I personally felt this was a more likely scenario with the Dursleys. I have adjusted the tags accordingly
Ron just kept staring at the oval-shaped scar left behind after Harry and Hermione went to Godric’s Hollow. After Ron had left them.
Harry forced his aching body to move, ignoring its protests that it would throw up any second, and found the bottle. He quickly downed the potion and layback whilst he felt it take effect. He let out a small groan before moving to sit fully upright.
“Oh, not much. I was just curious to know when you realised that you fancy Draco.”
When he walked into the room, all conversations seemed to die down to an awkward silence. It seemed whatever he had revealed had been fairly scandalous.
Harry was dreading whatever it was McGonagall had planned. The last thing he wanted to do was spend the morning playing monopoly whilst most of his year group still stared at him like he was made of fine china. He was surprised to find that he didn’t actually hate what she had planned for that day: watching movies. 8 years in the Wizarding World and Harry still found it funny how excited people who only knew the wizarding world got when watching something on TV or a film. He wasn’t quite convinced by McGonagall’s choice of the Lion King. He vaguely recalled when it came out a couple of years before and all he knew was that it was a film for kids. Not for a bunch of seventeen-and-eighteen-year-olds.
Harry stared at her. He didn’t quite know what to say. How had she known? And how was she saying all this crazy stuff that all made perfect sense and was actual quite simple.
They spent the rest of the 10-minute break refreshing their drinks and running to the loo before sitting down to watch the sequel. Before they had watched the first film, when McGonagall had told them what they were watching and somebody else had mentioned that it was a kids film, the common room went into uproar. Harry noticed that clearly, the first film had won them over because nobody let out any complaints about having to watch the sequel.
“I’m sure that’s not true Malfoy.”
“Harry, I may not know you that well. But I know relationships. And I know Draco.”
“You’re straight?”
He spoke so quietly, Malfoy barely heard what he said. When he realised what Harry was referring to and bitterly said “yes well
As Defence was actually a subject Harry cared about, he got his parchment and quill out ready, just in case he needed to take notes. Whilst he had done some reading over the summer and would say that he was very confident in all the NEWT level content, he felt it was better safe than sorry. That and it was bound to make Hermione chastise Ron for not taking his own notes as well which was always amusing. Harry loved Ron but just like brothers, he also likes to wind him up and tease him.
Malfoy was just about to retort when Pansy threw a cushion across at both of them and the glare they received shut them up instantly.
“Yes, thank you, Potter. I get it, you don’t have to keep giving me more reasons. I suppose you’re quite like the squeaky girl lion.”
But when Harry looked, he realised that the Dark Mark didn’t sit alone on Malfoys pale forearm. Surrounding it completely were beautiful flowers
But Harry knew he wasn’t: he hadn’t spent hours upon hours watching Malfoy in Sixth Year to not recognised the flash of fear in Malfoy’s eyes when they called his name and brought him to the centre of the room, he recognised the way Malfoy rubbed his thumb in circles on the end of his index finger just like he did when Harry saw him in the Astronomy Tower, right before any of the other Death Eaters showed up.
“You guys can go I’ll be fine.” Harry urged. “I’m going to go to sleep soon anyway. I’m exhausted.”
At Harry’s face of panic, she added, “Don’t worry, you can get the same frame shape and style. Just a little more polished and sophisticated.”
“Yes because helping the Saviour of the wizarding world would definitely be the worst thing I’ve ever done. Not trying to sacrifice him to mean old snake-face”
Most confident was harder. He supposed he was good at his Patronus, but he didn’t fancy putting that down. He knew at least half the class were now proficient in them thanks to Dumbledore’s Army, so he wanted to try and think of something different. He supposed he was good at expelliarmus, but he first learnt that spell in 2nd year after seeing Snape use it in the duelling club, so it was hardly a talent that was unique to him. He wracked his brain harder and eventually, his paper said:
______
"Thank you Harry."
He stands and begins dressing. YOu don't look at him and you're sure he knows better than to look at you. You stay right where you are on the floor. You know not to move a muscle until your Masters give you permission. You are trying to control your tears, but your ass hurts so bad.
The thrusting slowed, their breathing was heavy but evening out, and Harry pulled his cock from Draco. Draco fell to the floor, his body limp.
Draco came into the study a while later, wearing a frilly apron over his chastity belt, and said, "Dinner is served Harry."
"Yes Master," you say, and you realize their house is very clean. It seems Master Draco is going to be a fastidious neatnik. You know how to fold neatly,so you do, making sure all the lines are even.
Draco's face flushed red, but he followed Harry's orders and got on his hands and knees. Harry inspected Draco in that position for a moment. His pert white ass poking out, waiting to be filled, his engorged cock visible only from a certain angle. Harry stroked his own cock, just watching Draco's body quivering in anticipation. "Please, Harry," Draco whispered, his hips started moving, as though they were fucking thin air, and Harry knew that Draco needed to be touched and filled.
"Corner, now Girl," Draco demands. "And get naked."
"Yes," Draco agreed, cringing as yet another smack of the hairbrush hit his ass.
Harry continued the punishing speed, and realizing it'd be torturous to hold Draco back anymore, commanded him, "Come!"
They were both on edge. It was transcendent.
"Yes sir," Draco said, watching as the Dom undid his pants and pulled them off. This Dom's cock was enormous, and it was no wonder he'd managed to get three little cocksluts to worship it. Draco's eyes went wide as the Dom jerked himself to a full erection.
Harry's eyes went hooded. "On the bed," he ordered Blaise.
You and Ronald are made to kneel at either end of the coffee table and begin drinking your water. While you two are doing that, Hermione and the Masters have sex right in front of you. You watch as Hermione straddles over Harry, his cock deep in her pussy, while Draco is in front of her, his cock sliding in and out of her mouth. Hermione is so beautiful and you can tell just by watching that she is very talented at sucking cock. You glance at Ronald and see he is watching her in fascination and adoration. You wonder what went through his mind last weekend to want to fuck you when he so clearly is in love with his Mistress Hermione.
"Would you like to see the BDSM room?" Madame Kat asked.
"Touch me, dammit," Draco growled and gave him a look.
At long last, the paddling is over and you are taken to the corner and told to stand there and think about your punishment. You think about it and you are in so much pain that you're beginning to finally feel sorry for your actions. And to think you have more than 24 more hours to go.
It's long work and they aren't even close to being done when they decide to order food for delivery for dinner. "Put this on," Draco orders, and hands you a dress that's, well, barely a dress. It's shiny and leather and blue. Your breasts are nearly bursting out of the top and it only comes down just barely below the line of your buttocks. Draco hands you a pair of spike heel shoes and tells you that this is what you'll wear to answer the door to accept the food that's being delivered.
"It's just....it's a lot of stuff and I didn't know where to start."
"So are you," Ted said to Amy.
______
He glanced across at Amy who had a cock in her mouth while taking a hairbrush across her ass. She looked the same as Draco felt, that she was just letting her mind go blank into survival mode.
"Exactly," he says. "And you proved my point by practically sucking that man's dick. You are a slut."
Harry kissed Draco on the cheek, "Evenly cut bread with come with practice. I can eat crooked bread."
"I use only the highest end creams, Harry. The cream I use costs approximately two hundred fifty galleons for a month's supply."
It was glorious to see the redness in Draco's ass become even deeper. He was going to have a bruise tomorrow for sure. Both Draco and Amy were sobbing, and when they could catch their voices, saying "We're sorry!"
All of this was well worth it, you are thinking.
Harry sets a timer, "Five more minutes and you may get up."
"Yes Master Draco," You say standing at attention.
"Morning," Harry mumbled.
They ate their dinner, and aftewards, Draco did the dinner dishes. At that point it was nearly two hours until Blaise got there.
You go to the kitchen and come back with a tall stool, which you sit on, legs spread so your pussy is on display. Being displayed is a huge turn-on for you and even though you aren't being touched, just knowing your pussy is being looked at makes you a bit wet.
"You're not going to discipline me because I think toilet cleaning is gross!" Draco said, in disbelief.
"Oooh, hands. That's a classic. Should we take turns?"
"And I would stop when you use the safe word?"
"Come here, Draco," Harry said, patting the bed. "Lie facedown like a good little pet and take your punishment."
After Hermione is done paying attention to your breasts, she has you spread your legs as she lifts up the skirt of your dress to your midsection. She gets on her knees and looks up into your crotch, spreading your vulva and inhaling your musk.
"I haven't fucking come yet tonight!" Draco said. "Please, sir. May I come?"
Draco was overcome with a desire to show Harry, to show every single Dom here, that he was the sub who could do anything. He could take what they handed out, no matter how much it hurt (and his nipples were still screaming in pain). But he also wanted those Dom's to be jealous of Harry and of Draco's skills in the bedroom, and what Harry got on a nightly basis. He was a Slytherin after all, and his ambition to be the most submissive sub was really coming through.
"Draco is to serve Harry with a happy and servile attitude."
You really wish you were eating at the table.
You lean back on your heels and turn to look at him. "What do you need to know?" you ask.
You follow Draco outside to the middle of the yard, waddling a little in the soaked and full diaper. "Spread your legs," Draco orders. You spread them and he pulls the velcro tabs and releases you from the diaper. Once you are out of the diaper, you let the rest of the pee come out and finish pissing in the yard.
Harry grinned as he saw Draco start to stroke his own cock. Harry shifted as he felt the swelling in his own groin again. He palmed himself through his pants. "Why yes, I am. Why do you ask?"
Draco blanched, "Harry.....no."
Draco was all in for the idea.
"Very impressive," Blaise said nodding. "And do you think it's worked?"
Now you just have to make it through next weekend. An entire weekend of punishment. You shudder, wondering what it could bring.
"I went over my monthly budget on lunch and drinks."
"All right," Draco said. "Cooking and cleaning. I don't even know how to do that."
The worst punishment for Ronald comes when Hermione video calls him. You had thought she was just going to be checking in, but he had to sit there and watch as she was pounded by two different guys. She would look directly into the camera and say, "Watch it Ronald. Watch this amazing guy slip his dick inside my pussy. Oh god, I'm so wet for him!" Then the guys would look into the camera and say things like, "You pathetic little cuck. Your wife is here and has sucked my cock twice already and you're over there getting your ass spanked. You're pathetic." And Hermione would laugh as one guy pounded her from behind while the other guy had his cock down her throat.
"Did you think that somehow this chore would just be magically done for you? Like it was in your childhood?"
The Masters must have known, because you walk into their home, and immediately drop to your knees to kiss their feet in greeting. They pull you up by the arm and order you to get naked. You've learned from last week, and you undress slowly, carefully folding each item of clothing and handing it to Draco who shuts it in the hall closet. Within minutes they have you in the living room on your back and legs spread. Harry is kneeling before you, pumping his cock in and out of your sopping wet pussy while Draco straddles your face, pumping his cock in and out of your mouth.
Draco breathed deeply, relaxed that he wasn't going to get spanked over ruining a shirt.
Draco was shocked, he'd never been pissed on before. Instinctively, he pulled his legs away, but the cocksluts just took as step further as they released their urine on him. He was surprised at the warmth of it, like a warm shower. For the first time, he was tempted, truly tempted, to use his safeword. But he just bit his lip and took it. It was only pee, he legs could he washed.
Harry stood to the side and let his hand hit Draco's backside. "One!" Draco said. Just like last time, the spankings got progressively harder. "Two! Three! Four! Five!"
The worst part was - it was true. This is what he'd signed up for. As his and Harry's lives had taken on more of a 24/7 sub and dom lifestyle, this is what was bound to happen. He was going to screw up bigtime, and he'd agreed in advance for some pretty harsh punishment. Draco closed his eyes and made a pact with himself. This night couldn't last forever. The nights at Madame Kat's always came to and end, and this one would too. All he had to do was make it through and then he'd be home with Harry in the comfort of their bed.
Draco nodded.
"Then come up to bed."
"Spanking is a lot of it. But I'd gotten bored of it and wanted to get creative, so that's why I got the chastity belt. I already tell him when he can and can't come, but I've never actually denied him an orgasm-just delayed it a bit. Sometimes he writes lines. He gets corner time and a lot of lectures."
"I need more allowance," Draco said bluntly.
Amy knew exactly what was happening and quickly moved her plate to the floor. Harry looked questioningly at Ted, who explained, "When she's bad, she eats like a dog on the floor. No utensils,no hands. She has to stick her face in her food like the naughty dog she is and eat."
"This isn't your parents house anymore, Draco."
You nod, wanting to make sure you are as helpful as Ronald.
Then they cuddled in together and fell into a deep sleep.
"We have bathroom rules this weekend," Draco said. He holds your hand and leads you to the backyard. "You'll pee outdoors," he said. "I want you to pee, then run three laps around the yard to give your legs a little exercise after kneeling so much for dinner and the dessert of our come."
Ted nodded. "We had a few attitude spankings, which helped in the short term, but I think this is just something that she will have to get through. I'm absolutely forbidding her from telling her mother about our lifestyle, because she will definitely think I'm abusing her."
"Good. This is a big breach, so be prepared for a long time in the corner before your spanking."
After dinner, Draco handed Harry a brandy and told him to go relax while he did the dishes. Harry went to the parlor, but couldn't relax. All day at work, he'd wanted to come home and fuck his husband hard. He couldn't stop thinking about the reaction he got whilst spanking Draco.
They don't stop and when their first ice cubes melt, they grab another two and continue to work it over your body. You feel like you're going to scream in agony but at the same time you don't want them to stop. You love this attention and you love this pain. The ice continues to freeze your body, you have the biggest goose flesh you've ever hand in your life and your nipples are both tightened little stones. The only place you feel warmth is in your vagina, which wet with the desire that often comes with pain for you.
________
You fall into a deep sleep, but Ronald's alarm wakes you up, even though it was a pretty quiet alarm. "Do you want to help me make breakfast?" he asks.
Harry's dick had started to swell just listening to that story. It sounded like....well, like a lot. But not that bad.
"And my household chore?" Draco asked.
"Honestly? I'm not sorry about the allowance. I think it was worth it."
You get your first look at Hermione. She is short and slight with brown hair tied back into a bun. She is wearing business attire and has a stern look on her face. Your Masters are behind her, and behind them is Ronald, who is tall and ginger with a friendly sort of face. You notice though he is a Sub, he is wearing normal street clothes, not sexy clothes like your Masters make you wear.
"Yeah," Blaise said. "Do it."
"Take it all," Harry commanded.
You are there for a long time. So long that you start to suspect they've forgotten you. But a long time later, they both come back into the parlor. "Put your hands on the wall," Draco orders.
The three of them went limp, Blaise on top of Draco, who had his eyes closed because Blaise's semen was all over his face included his eyelids. And Harry between Draco's legs. There were a few welted stripes on the tops of Draco's thighs. Harry touched one gently, and Draco hissed in pain. They lay there in their post come (for Harry and Blaise) relaxed phase for a few minutes. Draco's legs were still shaking and Harry knew he was trying desperately not to continue humping the air.
"And pantsless," Harry said. "I want your bare knees on the stone floor."
Harry and Ted looked at each other and nodded. "It's a full fifteen minute spanking," Ted said.
Harry looked at Draco, still tied to the bedposts, wearing only the skimpy chastity belt and with red stripes across his thighs. Harry gently untied Draco from the posts and grabbed the salve from the bathroom. He applied it to the welts on Draco's thighs and on Draco's red ass. "Did you learn your lesson?" Harry asked.
"Oh precious," Harry said, planting a kiss on Draco's forehead. "I'm so proud of you for taking it like this. Now, get naked and stand in the corner and think about what you've done."
"Come here," Harry said.
"Hmm," he says. "Tell me about your old Dom." He sits at the table and watches me thoughtfully.
The Masters sleep in the bed and you and Ronald are in sleeping bags off to one side. Ronald is ordered to wake up early to make breakfast.
"What?" Harry asked.
"You're breaking two rules right now. You must clean what I say, and you must serve me with a good attitude. Now drop your pants and come here." Harry sat on the couch.
"See you Friday night, Girl," Harry says with a wink.
God but does his musk smell great. The smell of cock alone makes your pussy drip in anticipation. But there is nothing for your pussy. it's only your mouth that the Masters use and abuse over and over an over all day.
You help by fetching ingredients while Ronald does the work of putting the bread together. You talk about your times as subs. "I knew I was coming here this weekend," Ronald said. "I always act like a brat for Hermione when I know I'm coming here."
Harry touched his wand to the belt and muttered the incantation. The chastity belt would be unable to be removed except by Harry's wand. Draco would not be able to remove it himself.
Draco bit his lip, but didn't cry. "I'm sorry," he said.
Harry and Ted sat on the couch, with Draco and Amy at their heels again. A few others came over to talk, and Harry got to learn about all the other types of Dominant and Sub relationships there were. This was like a whole new world to him. Harry really found Ted quite attractive, and realized if you couldn't be blunt about what you wanted in a sex club, where could you be?"
"Harry, come on. We've only just begun. Can't I work up to that?"
From the depths of his closet and into his hand, zoomed the Celebrate Celibate magical chastity belt, still in it's box.
"Or this?" Blaise asked, letting number twelve go.
For example, one of Draco's chores had been to clean the floors in Harry's study. The floor was stone with a rug in the center and the rug needed to be magically vacuumed and the stone dusted. When Harry inspected the work, he found the dust mostly shoved into the edges of the floor around the wall.It wasn't a surprise, though Draco was turning into a gifted cook, his housework was often done shoddily and required a harsh reminder or a swat to the bottom to be remedied. This time, Harry called Draco into the study and pointed out the corners.
You really have to piss, but you are holding it in, hoping the Masters will wake up and take you outside. Anything to avoid going in the diaper. You hold on as long as you can, but once the dough is risen and is put into the oven, you know you can't anymore. You can't bring yourself to piss in the kitchen, where food is cooked, so you head into the living room, spread your legs a bit and release your urine. The diaper becomes full and soggy and you absolutely hate how it feels between your legs. You start to tear up, wondering how long you'll be forced to be in a diaper filled with piss this morning. You can't even let it all go, you are so afraid of it leaking, so you hold some in.
"Am I in charge?" Harry asked.
"Well, to make sure, there's going to be a punishment."
Draco grabbed his wand, waved it silently over their bodies, and immediately both Blaise and Harry were stark naked, their erections pushing out at a harsh angle. Draco bit his lip.
"How do you want him?" Harry asked, giving Blaise the first go.
Harry took the hairbrush and he felt Carly positively shivering in his lap. Whether it was from fear or anticipation, he didn't know. She hadn't used her safeword, so Harry knew it was OK to continued. But instead he watched for a moment as Ted pulled Draco's underpants down. They'd gotten a lot of attention, Draco and Harry being new to the scene afterall. There were some appreciative murmurs as Draco's gorgeous cock was exposed for all to see. Draco settled himself over Ted's lap and closed his eyes in anticipation. As the first thunderous spanking struck him, Harry instinctively thrust his hips, grinding his hard cock into Carly's midsection. She gasped.
"I just thought that there might be something else I can do for you," Draco said flirtily.
Draco walked, slightly hunched over toward Harry and lay himself, ass up, over Harry's knees. He could feel Harry trembling and was happy to know that Harry was as nervous about doling out discipline as he was about receiving it.
Draco bit his lip and murmured, "Yes sir."
"Dunno," Ronald shrugs. "I definitely like the punishment, but I also feel a little abandoned and it makes me sad. When I act up, Hermione gives me a lot of punishments, but also a lot of love and it makes me feel good."
"Right," Harry said. "Why do you have trouble remembering it?"
10-Draco is permitted to get out of discipline with a safeword, which is 'checkmate.' Draco promises to only use it if the discipline is going too far.
"Let me send Madame Kat an owl," Ted said. "To get time in the cage you have to request it and tell her what the subs did. She'll decide if the punishment fits the crime."
"We just want to look at you while we do it," Harry said. "Sit on that chair over there and drape your legs across the arms."
"Tea," Harry says. "Make us some tea and bring it to us in the parlor."
"I'm a sick little pansy boy." SMACK.
"It sure does," Harry nodded.
Sunday morning, you are once again awoken with a cock in your face, only this time it is Master Harry's. You are so grateful to be acknowledged that you gobble it down, deepthroating him immediately. The second Harry's come stops spurting from his dick, Draco is on you, shoving his already hard member in your mouth and you work it over eagerly.
"No Ma'am," You agree, feeling small.
But as you get back up to continue working on breakfast, you start to feel guilty. And you realize Ronald does too. Oh, what have you done? Your Masters will truly let you have it now. You know you've disappointed them.
Blaise had never fucked Harry properly before. Harry was anxious about having such a large penis fill him. "God your cock is so big," Harry breathed. It was for Draco's benefit he said that, but Harry didn't even glance in Draco's direction.
Harry reattached Draco's handcuffs. Draco seemed shaken, mostly by being dismissed so quickly after being called a worthless little bitch. But Harry didn't stick around to soothe him, because he was approached by another Dom and sub, both of them women, who wanted a turn with Draco.
"I'm as wet as I've ever been, just do your best."
"Yes,Master Draco," you whisper, hoping  that a finger will slip inside you, just absolutely needing something in your pussy.
Carly, wearing not a stitch of clothing, stood by Harry, waiting for her instructions. Her chest read, "safeword, Firefly." God but she was gorgeous. Thick thighs and curves with a mass of curly hair on her head, Harry was getting hard again just thinking of that body laying aross his lap. So he ordered her, "Across my lap. Now."
You aren't sure you're allowed to come, and as your mouth is currently being fucked by Draco, you've no way of asking. You try to hold off, but God damn it, it's been a long week and you are horny as hell. You can feel the orgasm building in you and you try to not let it show in your face as it washes over you, your pussy quivering in release.
"Yes Ma'am," Ronald says, rushing over. He carefully unzips her skirt and works it down her legs, followed by silky white panties. "Ma'am, would you like to leave your shirt on?"
"And how I'm too weak because of my Aunt and Uncle?"
"You're not cleaning that off for a while," he said. You nod in understanding. It's already starting to cool and felt disgusting. "Let my come on your face remind you of what you're good for. Which is nothing but being our dirty slut."
"Okay, Girl." Harry says, as he pulls on his zipper. "You're going to take turns sucking our dicks while we have our tea."
"Something to look forward to when you get home," Draco said, smiling.
The rest of the day, you work on being the absolute best submissive you know how to be. You make extra sure to call them Master Harry and Master Draco. You do whatever they want, posing, getting food, cleaning, and you do it all with a good attitude. That night, they do not ignore you during their lovemaking. Though you are still not permitted to come, they do allow you to suck their cocks which you do happily.
Blaise grinned. The worst punishment one could give Draco Malfoy, who was used to unending attention, was to simply pretend he wasn't there.
You add an extra spring to your step so your breasts bounced up and down with each step. Your tits were already achy and marked from the riding crop and this only makes them hurt worse. The semen on your face is drying and making your face feel cracked. And you feel so exposed and naughty to be running nude around the Masters' yard while they jeer from the sides. You finish your three laps, a little out of breath and follow the Masters back into the house.
"What?" Harry asked.
You are so nervous the entire week leading up to your weekend with your Masters. What could they have in store for you? You know it'll be a weekend filled with punishments, and you know that you absolutely deserve it.
"Sounds kinky," Blaise said. "Let's see it."
"Now," she says, facing you toward her again. She cups your breasts and breathes in. "Oh, these are beautiful things." She pulls the top of your dress down so your tits are out and fully on display. She traces a finger over your nipple, which immediately hardens. She leans down and runs her tongue around the nipple slowly. it's sensual and you can feel your pussy start to get wet. Draco and Harry are looking on approvingly.
"My one problem?" Draco asked.
Harry pulled his finger out and slicked up his own cock before setting the tip just at Draco's entrance. "Relax," Harry whispered in Draco's ear. "You'll be too tight if you can't relax." Draco took a deep breath, and Harry could feel his asshole loosen. Harry pushed forward.
"Do you have a paddle?" Blaise asked.
This wasn't punishment at all. You absolutely love being displayed in such a manner. You love the idea of your Masters looking at your pussy and getting horny. Then you looked down at your thighs and the words that were written on there, and you remembered what a worthless little cunt you are. If you hadn't fucked Ronald last weekend, there is a chance that you would have come once already this weekend. There is a chance you would have eaten at the table. You think back to the prior weekend and remember how it felt to have Ronald's massive prick inside you. Just remembering that makes a bit of moisture seep out of your vagina and you think that maybe an entire weekend of humiliation would have been worth it. You know that you really are a filthy little slut, but you love being that.
"In his ass," Blaise said immediately.
Draco's attitude had definitely taken an improvement over the next few months, and Harry found his groove in being a dominant. Harry learned that there were other ways of discipline that didn't require spanking, and he could be creative.
Blaise's eyes lit up. "Oh, I've used one of these before." He handed the box to Draco, who in his drunken state, still managed to look nervous.
Finally Harry realizes, "Girl, sit and eat with us."
"This sounds bizarre."
"Perhaps we tell them together?" you ask. "When your Mistress gets here, let's tell them both at the same time."
Still, before getting each other off, they headed to the dining room and sat at the table. Amy was in there, setting the table, laying out four plates, napkins and silverwear at each seat. She was still sniffling and walking stiffly, but said nothing as she completed her task. She went into the kitchen and came out with a bottle of wine, which she uncorked and filled Harry and Ted's wine glasses.
"Yes Master Draco, of course."
All five of you go into the parlor. "On your knees," Harry says. "Both of you."
Draco went to the corner and stood facing it.
Draco stood up and touched his hands lightly to his beaten backside, wincing slightly.
Draco licked his lips, "No."
The Masters get out the riding crop and take turns working you over, from your thighs  to your ass to your tits to your exposed vulva and clitoris. Each time they bring it down it delivers a painful sting to the area. This goes on for several minutes and your eyes  start to water before the Masters stop. They leave you hanging in the contraption, while they ignore you and go about their evening. You hang in the contraption for over an hour, your arms going numb, your legs aching and your pussy absolutely drenched. You could hear the Masters in the kitchen making dinner.
He tried to zone out of the conversation the best he could. So far all it had been was a lot of Lavender and Parvati trying to plan their outfits and Seamus explaining to everyone how he was going to provide the alcohol with an occasional comment from Hermione every now and then that he ‘better not be bringing too much alcohol because if anybody passes out from alcohol poisoning, they’re going to have to go to the Hospital Wing and then there won’t be any future parties because we won't be seen as responsible adults so don’t get too carried away, Finnegan.’
Harry is expecting more silence so is surprised when Malfoy speaks next. “Have you ever told anyone before tonight?”
don’t do anything ‘just because'. You Slytherins have a motive behind everything.”
“I expect you’re going to get married in the next year or so, then?”
“Never have I ever given a blowjob.” Harry drank
It was a couple of minutes before Pansy spoke up again; “Don’t worry, Potter. I’m not about to go shouting from the rooftops that I spent the morning on a shopping trip with you. As far as my friends and anyone else is concerned, I was on a date this morning with a girl I met over the summer and you were, well, you can say what you like. I don’t mind that you don’t want to broadcast that you’ve spent time with me.”
After some protesting, Harry managed to convince Hermione and Ron to leave the room and eventually, found himself once again sat in silence with Malfoy.
Anthony Goldstein went first after a bottle was spun and landed on him.
At this point Ron was bright red, just staring at Harry whilst opening and closing his mouth like a deranged codfish.
“What Potter? I’m trying to watch the film.”
“Hey losers, can we try and keep it light-hearted. I’d rather not sit around with a bunch of miserable drunks.” That was Zabini. Harry hated to say it but he did have a point.
Before Harry or Malfoy responded, the rest of their year group sat down at the table and the conversation was effectively ended.
Harry let out a sigh, “yeah. They mean well but…”
By Friday morning breakfast, Harry started to regret wishing that this year would become more exciting when Pansy decided to suggest a party
“No, I’m fine I just- I figured since we’re going to be sharing a room for a year I might as well get to know you.”
Zabini sighed before seeming to decide to just bite the bullet.
than he would like at that thought didn’t mean he was attracted to Malfoy, right?
He spoke on Narcissa’s behalf and the Wizengamot gave her 6months house arrest at the Manor. Harry was just about to leave the Ministry when he saw Draco, whose trial was next. He looked…not like a scared puppy because that made him seem weak. Harry thought he looked incredibly calm and composed. Almost too calm considering his father had just been sentenced to life in Azkaban. His posture was good, his hair was combed to perfection. Anyone who didn’t know him would say that he looked relaxed and confident about his trial.
“A Malfoy does not marry for love. And given the events of last year…it’s a miracle anyone wants to marry me at all and so I have to accept anyone willing, whatever their gender.” Malfoy turned back to his food. He was really in the mood to have a long discussion about his future platonic-marriage. He half hoped that the Gryffindors would go back to having their own conversations about whatever it was they talked about, and ignore the Slytherins. But when was Malfoy ever that lucky.
“Ha ha, Malfoy. With quips like that, you should pursue a career in comedy. That is, if being an enormous git doesn’t work out for you.” Harry shot back. He had missed their sarcastic jibes this term mostly. He didn’t mind trying to be friendly to Malfoy but it was nice to feel like some things hadn’t changed.
“Wow, Granger. Clearly you’re finally living up to your title as the brightest witch of our age.” Malfoy drawled on his way past the trio and up the stays towards his and Harry’s room. “And Potter, you better not have made a mess of the room before I’ve even gone in.”
Harry thought that his day would be Pansy-less from that point on, at least until the party, but she insisted to dictate to him the whole way up to possible outfit combinations and insisted that she check ‘the finished product’ before he was allowed to make an appearance at the party.
Hermione’s brow furrowed and Pansy turned her gaze directly to her
“You’re kidding, right? I’m about as seductive as a cabbage.”
Harry gulped and then snapped his head back up, hoping neither of his friends had noticed him staring at the blonde but they were still talking about McGonagall’s motives behind the dorm pairings.
“My my, somebody’s looking bright-eyed and bushy-tailed!”
happen.”
“I take it from the conversation I walked in on earlier that you talked to Granger and Weasel about-”
“Wait a minute, befriend Malfoy? Nobody said anything about being friends with him.
“They were always going to end up together. With that kind of tension? Even if it was between their two sides, there’s no way that doesn’t lead to any sort of sexual encounters.”
Padma Patil went next and said, “Never have I ever gotten a tattoo.” Again, Harry had to drink (much to Ron and Hermione’s surprise) along with Parvati, Seamus, and Malfoy.
Harry would have found it funnier if he hadn’t realised that alleyways and the men's loo in muggle nightclubs counted as public places.
“Look Harry,” and Harry was startled over the sudden serious tone that Pansy’s voice took on. “I don’t care whether you just want to jump his bones or get down on one knee. That’s your prerogative. But Draco is my friend so before you lead in with your Gryffindor recklessness, think about what you want. If you want him I’ll support you but if you hurt him, I’ll kill you.”
“Sure you are. If anything, you’re Timon”
Seamus and Dean both seemed to be using the other to keep upright but otherwise were fine (although it didn’t escape Harry’s notice that Seamus’s hand kept moving further up Dean’s thigh where it was resting).
So Harry spoke. He spoke about how he had watched Draco in Sixth Year and his attempts to kill Dumbledore were half-hearted. That he was there in the Astronomy Tower that night, how Draco’s wand was lowering before the other Death Eaters came in, how Draco was no different than Harry other than the side of the war they were born on. He told them how Malfoy had the opportunity to give him up to Voldemort, knowing full well that it was Harry especially as he was with Ron and Hermione, and didn’t.
That phrase stuck with Harry for the rest of the evening until he went to bed. Who did he hate? Well, he definitely hated Voldemort and there was 100% no love there. He hated Snape despite what he might have done for the war effort. He had still been a greasy git as far as Harry was concerned and the thought of being in love with him made him feel slightly queasy. He used to hate Malfoy he supposed. Or at least he thought he hated him. Could he ever love Malfoy? Pansy
The other year groups would be arriving tomorrow, and Harry wanted to make sure he was awake early enough to enjoy some peace and quiet in the castle before they got here.
Malfoy was heading over to the door
They settled back into silence again as they got ready for bed but this time, Harry found that the silence felt comfortable rather than awkward. It made him feel at peace rather than unsettled.
When Harry awoke the next morning, he saw that Malfoy’s bed was already empty. Assuming that he was already gone from the dorm. However, Harry was wrong. He realised this when two moments later a dripping wet Draco Malfoy walked out of the bathroom towards his side of the room. Harry made a slight noise when he saw Malfoy which caused the blond git’s head to snap over in Harry’s direction, realising that he was now awake. Neither said anything for a few moments.
She grabbed a funny looking purple bottle off of a shelf and handed it to him.
I also saw a tattoo on Pinterest that is how I imagine Harry's (just with lillies as the flowers instead)
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh c’mon Granger. Surely even you can see the benefits. Just tell yourself it’s for the purpose of ‘Inter-house bonding’ if that helps you sleep better.”
