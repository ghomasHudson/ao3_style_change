Draco was out of anti-nausea potions. His hands were still shaking. When he turned to retrieve a new batch, Madam Pomfrey was watching him the way she had when Draco, choking on blood replenishing potion, woke and realized with a crushing, consuming sort of despair that Potter had not managed to kill him at all.
could have killed the Dark Lord, then!” and Potter got a shifty look and said, “Well there was kind of, I mean there was some other stuff that had to be done, it’s a bit of a long story, honestly—” and barreled towards the lake with his shoulder up by his ears—with Draco’s mounting, horrifying realization that magical Britain could have been destroyed had Potter not been so conveniently fucking
The doorknob rattled and turned with an audible click. Draco blinked at it, the action taking all of his effort. He had no idea how long he’d been here, and it occurred to him as the door swung inwards that he’d just wasted the last however-long of his freedom frozen when he should have been—he didn’t know. Savoring the stuffy air, the existence of a chair and table, neither of which he’d had in Azkaban.
Queensbury grimaced at that last bit, clutching the arm that had been possibly-fractured-probably-not-broken while he was wrangling with some ivy that had grown a malicious streak after stewing in the aftermath of a nasty curse, and ambled off with the Gryffindor prefect that had set the offending foliage on fire.
“Pity,” Draco said, the words coming up from some black well that had been quietly, unassumingly gaining depth. “You would have saved us all a lot of trouble if you had just—”
“I’m going now,” Potter interrupted, scowling. He shoved the wide oak doors open with more force than necessary. “Bye.”
He didn’t mean to stutter, was not particularly prone to it, but shame tripped up the flow of his sentence. The details of Draco’s sentencing had been widely published, in print and over the Wizarding Wireless Network, but Draco hadn’t had reason to discuss them with anyone other than his mother since Officer Abbott-Jones’ visit at the beginning of the month. His face flared with a frustrated pink.
“Don’t be ridiculous,” he’d answered, while she gently shoved him to the side and removed a pale green self-inking quill from her bag. Hers was the first Slytherin name on the parchment, and they both stared, quiet. Then she handed him the quill and Draco pushed it aside with a curled lip, because he was not signing a petition with
“And Thomas’ and Lovegood’s. It could have been mine. That’s the point.” Baddock’s cheeks had spots of high color, the most animated Draco had seen him since the gobstones tournament. “It’s—perspective. Some people still don’t want to see it, even when it’s right there in front of them, but it
Draco frowned. He found it specifically impossible to believe that Granger herself did not object to him being the one to provide that summary and said as much.
Draco had envied the quiet of those children. He was unable to train himself into silence, even during the war; he’d just kept it all bottled in his head, an endless babbling stream that worked as a neat trick of making it seem like he had no occlumency shields, though he did.
As he walked, Draco scripted what he would say to Creevey—when would they all be available to meet, for one, and did anyone other than him have unadvisable reactions to heights, for another. He let his hand trail along the bannisters, the stones walls, the edges of portraits; and imagined he heard the hum of Hogwarts’ magic pressing against his palm. Windows began to interrupt the path of his hand as he got to the outer corridors: narrow ones like those set into the Slytherin common room, crisp squares of charmed glass, empty arches with fading weatherproofing charms still bearing the shadow of earlier rain.
“I don’t even like gobstones,” Draco said, without meaning to. He was staring at the collar of Potter’s jumper unseeingly.
Harry fell fast in love with everything he saw on that first gilded day in Diagon Alley, the store displays and impossible doorways and the pale, pointy boy, looking right at him, messy hair and broken glasses and all, who said
Potter went still. Perfectly so, as if he’d been replaced with a stone in his likeness. He said, very slowly, “What?”
“Right,” Draco said. The panic deflated, replaced by something heavier. Not quite relief, not quite disappointment, but easier to breathe through.
The castle unveiled itself across the worn parchment, a magic so neat and intricate that Draco wanted to see the strands of magic that wove it together, the mechanism behind its working. It was a rare want; mostly, it reminded him of the vanishing cabinet, and that soured him on everything else to do with intricate spellwork.
There was a collective groan as everyone read the name of their bedmate, but Harry felt he had the most reason to be filled with dread.
His head felt crowded, his heart scrabbling against his ribs; he’d extracted one memory, and watched, hawk-eyed, over those who chose to fall into the pensieve—had been surprised when Baddock came over, asking how to extract a memory, and then watched as Baddock pulled a long strand from his temple and let it float into Zubeida Khan’s pensieve. Images flickered to the surface; a forest blurring past, spellfire catching trees, a Snatcher’s arm, a young woman with Baddock’s hair.
Each letter Harry pens to Andromeda is looked over with brutal precision by Malfoy before being sent off. Her replies are filled with subdued but pointed questions about the mysterious Slytherin he’d like her to speak with, and the plan Harry is working on with him.
Draco made a vaguely distressed noise that was almost, bizarrely, a laugh. “I—panicked, in the Headmistress’ office. I’ve been having them since the beginning of the year. I’m not—I’m not—”
Draco stayed in that crouch for long enough that his calves began to cramp. He shifted, sitting right on the stone floor in a manner that would have made his younger self cringe, until his arse went completely numb. When it began to veer into
Draco wasn’t sure how Astoria knew he was the one to do it. But then, the Greengrasses also had their own ancestral home. Perhaps Astoria, too, would spare her parents the pain of breaking it themselves if it meant getting one thing right, even if it was far, far too late for it to begin to matter.
He padded back to the bed, holding the jumper out with a stiff hand. It felt less like offering a jumper and more like he was holding out a question whose answer could hurt him deeply.
“If you enjoy gobstones, you should be able to remain on the team.” She said it firmly, finally, with a look that cowed Draco.
that easy?” he asked, wry, before catching Draco by the elbow and steering him towards the rest of the gobstones team.
She will ask this question again, much later; with the fire low in the grate in the Gryffindor common room and Malfoy off in the dungeons where he can’t begin his spiel on the cabinet and the pensieve and Andromeda Tonks, who might just be the elusive one-third needed to make their plan worth something. When it’s late enough that it’s only Harry, Ron, and Hermione in the common room, like a hundred times before, she will ask again, “What are you
Potter laughed, short and startled. Draco could feel his mouth pulling into a smile, unwillingly, in answer. It had been a long time since he made anyone laugh. And he’d
“Yes,” Draco said, squinting at the figures flying around the tower, dipping in and out of the broken roof.
“McGonagall told us to stay away from the unrepaired parts of the castle,” Potter was saying, in a quiet, frustrated voice. They’d migrated to one of the more open spots in the library, with impractical armchairs and tiny tables that Draco transfigured into a proper size, so he could obstinately spill all the books Potter had yet to read across its top.
“I am perfectly acceptable at playing gobstones,” Draco said stiffly, flicking the last bits of liquid from his hair and into Potter’s face.
“Morning,” Potter said, easily, like they did this all the time. Like their relationship had never been a vicious, thorned thing, twisted into something unrecognizable that managed, still, to cut effortlessly into Draco’s side.
It was this last one that burned, though Draco hadn’t figured out the reason why. He had no aspirations to become a Healer, and never had. Any draw he had towards it during the war had been pure survival instinct: he needed to know how to treat his nerve damage following the Dark Lord’s displeasure, how to stop the bleeding after Bellatrix conjured knives, how to splint a bone.
“I don’t know.” Draco curled his hands around his nape, catching the loose hair there. Vivian used to babysit, when they were left in the Crabbe estate alone; she’d been quiet, and overweight, and was the reason Draco had taken to having his tea sweetened so heavily. She always made it too bitter, and laughed at the expression on their faces as they scrambled to dump sugar and milk in it. He hadn’t thought of her in ages. She graduated when they were in their second year, off to an apprenticeship in France and then never returned. She sent Vince a card every year for his birthday and Yule, even during seventh year.
The kept their conversation light and inconsequential like their interactions never were, and Harry was certain they were both ignoring the weight of all those things Not Worth Talking About pressing down on them.
“Oh,” Potter said, frowning. His glasses were askew from the way he was sitting, but he didn’t move to fix them. Draco’s fingers twitched.
"We should start asking, I think," Lovegood said from where she had been carefully tending to the underside of the spiral staircase. "She's listening, isn't she?"
Madam Pomfrey had pressed another cup of floral tea into his palms when he jerkily nodded his need for one, and when she asked, with that that briskness with which she asked everything else, if he wanted to continue speaking with someone else about his experiences, Draco surprised—well, only himself, probably, when he’d said yes.
noticed Draco’s presence at all. She was frowning, her hand finishing a word even as she lifted her head. She didn’t say anything, but there was an undeniable jut of her chin that spoke of distrust.
Here, an arched doorway that managed, improbably, to take one straight to the top floor of the tower, bypassing the spiral staircase entirely. There, a wide, circular room with multi-colored windows that glittered red and green and yellow and blue along the pale floor. Even the spiral staircase, once narrow and claustrophobic, was regrown in an unfamiliar shape: windows with benches set into the frames, steps alternating between dark greys and layered pinks, wall sconces that held a low light that brightened with the sounds of their voices, of their wonder.
Draco ignored the tea for long enough that it had grown cold when he finally picked it up. He reheated it carefully, cradling it in his palms for a long moment, just staring at the pinkish liquid.
“It hurt. It—I know it doesn’t matter,” Malfoy adds, with a blazing sort of defensiveness, “But it did. I didn’t think something spoke about with such honor—” The word spits itself out of his mouth, the admission Harry has been waiting for. “—would be so painful. And after, he—”
“Great,” Baddock said, then stayed where he was. Draco resisted a sigh; most of their housemates had lost interest once they realized Baddock was talking about gobstones—again—but even their interest was recaptured when Baddock didn’t immediately leave.
Madam Pomfrey waited, undemanding and patient. After a time, she suggested, “You could start by telling me what happened today.”
Draco stared at the unvarnished tabletop, his gaze unfocused. The door squeaked open, then shut with finality. There was no clock in the room, and no windows, and it was so thoroughly soundproofed that Draco could not hear the sounds of footsteps in the hall outside.
stamped on each edge and began throwing its contents back inside it: the parchments with which he’d taken notes, Draco’s history of magical signature and potions checks, a glaringly orange sheet labeled
He dressed quickly as Malfoy and the rest of the Slytherins—none, it seemed, wanted to be left alone with the Gryffindors—took their turn.
Hearing it said back to him makes Harry immediately understand how stupid it sounds, declaring their hate for each other like this. As if it matters anymore.
“Old magic?” Harry repeated, lifting a hand towards the nearest bulb of color, the gold with a bright yellow core. It was wispy and faint, but pulsed like something living; he couldn’t touch it, but he could
“Will you be going to the meeting?” she asked politely, cutting him off when he tried to sidestep her.
Figures he'd know what it was upon sight. "Shut up," Harry hissed, "and get under here if you're coming."
“There you are,” says Ron’s voice, unexpectedly close. Harry jerks his head up to find Ron giving him a funny look from the foot of his bed. “Thought you might have gone to bed already.”
He wasn’t smiling, exactly, but the expression on his face was nearly friendly when Draco took a few steps into the room and said, “I apologize for being late.”
,” Harry says, quietly but firmly, because he can see Draco getting ready to argue. “And Andromeda’s not going to hate you just because you look like your father.”
. Unfortunately, that was the only thing he could think to say for several long seconds. It wasn’t fair of him, so he said nothing.
The meeting would progress thusly: the Headmistress would open with a cordial greeting and an insistent demand that Draco take tea and biscuits; Draco would oblige. The Headmistress would make noise about how Hogwarts was an educational institution, that Draco was once a good, consistent student and prefect, that his classmates would be his future colleagues and that it was important for him to interact with them; Draco would sit attentive and contrite, because he understood that he had fallen rather spectacularly from ill-begotten grace and would remain as such, given that his name was as good as counterfeit galleons and that his classmates would never respect him again.
Professor Applesnap leaned forward, her voice very low and acidic. “You don’t deserve to be. After everything you did, you don’t deserve—”
Potter’s gaze hardened, eyes boring into Draco’s with that bullheaded determination that Draco only ever saw from afar, for things that mattered.
They haven’t talked about this, the touching. A war and its machinations are easier to talk about than the tiny secrets of each other’s skin.
Potter made a face at Draco as he reached the bottom of the steps. “Right, I’m sure no one will notice if I just summon it from the tower.”
, the shocking heat of his hand over Draco’s. The distance between them seemed to dwindle daily, hourly; and Draco was still no closer to being sure of anything, let alone whatever it was that he and Potter were heading unerringly towards.
The shattering of those illusions made up the next transgressions: the memory of every person who looked him in the eye before the torture began. A year lost to planning a murder, and nearly becoming the murdered, the murderer. The sting of dark magic funneling through his wand. A properly cast crucio. Lovegood and Thomas, who never flinched away from him, who always held his gaze through the cellar bars. The floors—flagstones and polished wood and ornate carpet—bloodied and destroyed, where corpses were left with their mouths still frozen mid-scream, mid-plea.
Maybe it was always going to be Harry or no one. Just Malfoy, alone, to figure out how to not die when everything around him was so clearly manufactured to do just that.
“Nightmare?” Malfoy asks, lowering his arm. His voice is quieter; he sounds sleepless now that he's not being difficult, like he’s maybe been abusing the prefect privileges he still has to wander about the castle unbothered.
“Hm,” said Baddock, which was ominous for reasons Draco could not quite articulate until almost an hour later, when he came back from dropping his bag into his room and found the entire gobstones team waiting for him at the table near the entrance.
A paper crane floated over to him a few minutes later. Harry snatched it out of the air before Ron or Hermione could notice, unfolding it to find the words, in tiny, slanting scrawl,
His gut twisted painfully, a vindictive, darkly satisfied spiral all the way up into Draco’s chest. The class held its collective breath and waited to see what Potter would do, but Draco already knew what Potter would do: nothing. Potter had never wanted to be Draco’s friend, not from that very first minute, and their argument had only proved the futility of any attempt otherwise. Potter would turn and sit on the Gryffindor side, and Draco would be rendered a nonentity while
Draco stared mutely at his hands, interlaced tightly. The shimmer of a binding spell blinked back at him, twisted lavender around each wrist and pressing subtly against his pulse.
It’s quiet out here, blissfully so, which is why Harry hears the soft crunch of footsteps long before they come to a stop next to him. Malfoy leans over him and blots out the moon, his hair loose and swaying slightly in the breeze, his nose and cheeks red with cold. His winter cloak makes his body one long, dark line against the bitterly blue sky, in sharp contrast to the pale glow of his face and hair. He’s beautiful, which Harry already knew. It’s only that he never lets himself think that, normally.
It was a generous characterization of that particular conversation. Mostly when they spoke, it was about safe, unhurt topics like Quidditch and classwork. Once—late, as ever, the two of them haunting the Owlery in their sleeplessness—they discussed the future, or at least Potter did, ceaseless and worrying, and since all Draco could imagine of his was the slow drip of his probation and the ever-present risk of Azkaban just beyond it, he’d finally snapped out that perhaps Potter had never had brains enough to just sit and think about his interests, if he had any.
The conversation—argument, if that was what it was, which Draco wasn’t sure about—put Draco in a black mood for the rest of the day. He studied angrily and ate angrily and had a miserable hour curled up in his bed, buried under the covers, wondering if he would ever stop being the kind of person who hurt other people on purpose, if he would ever stop being cruel, if he would ever stop wanting Potter’s attention, if he would ever just fucking
He remembers, mouth dry, months late, that some things are inevitable, and Malfoy has always been one of them.
, Hermione had said; Ron calls it that, too. Harry thinks about the word later, when the sounds of sleep have settled inside the sixth-year boy’s dormitory. Wonders if that word explains why he’d woken with the sudden, visceral need to figure out what Malfoy’s cock would feel like in his mouth.
, before neatly tacking it to the mental board that held all the other things he was meant to deal with later. This included a distressing number of throw-away comments by Potter, but also things like the concept of freedom, and that endless stretch of time spent in Azkaban, and the fact that in all this time, he and Potter had never once mentioned the war or the years before it.
Portions of the forest still bore damage from the Battle, trees uprooted and the ground gouged so deeply, stone was revealed underneath. Potter stood at a nondescript portion of the treeline, like he was part of the damage, poised on the balls of his feet.
—chance I have to find time to speak with her freely. There is no point to any of this if the Dark Lord kills my mother.
This is a very Hermione question, softened only slightly when Harry reminds her of Dumbledore’s frequent disappearances, citing his last lesson as further reminder that Dumbledore is not in the mind for listening. Her mouth twists in disapproval, and twists further at Malfoy’s small scoff; Hermione doesn’t understand Harry’s continual distrust in adults, even with their shared history between them.
“Malfoy,” said Potter, voice still rough and underused. He had his school bag thrown over one shoulder, eyes wide but, somehow, not surprised. “Hi.”
Harry watches them watch him fall under, features distorted by chlorine and water and harsh fluorescent lights. He has to save himself. It’s always the only option.
“No, it’s—” Baddock cleared his throat. “Professor Sinistra said we shouldn’t downplay what happened.”
Professor Sprout came down from the High Table during this speech, though Draco couldn’t say at what point; only that in short order, their gazes had broken, and the Hufflepuff was being led quietly, miserably out of the hall, and then the Headmistress stood and settled herself behind the podium to make a speech that Draco couldn’t hear over the roar of his heart in his ears. His whole body was so upright and rigid that it ached, his jaw so tight he could feel a headache building in response.
“Well, yeah, I mean—they reported some of it in the Prophet,” Potter explained, defensive. “A lot of it wasn’t true, I don’t think anyone but Voldemort actually heard all of what I was saying—”
It was only Friday, the first week back finally coming to a close, and Draco could see the miserable path the year would take: already, his housemates were shifting awkwardly away from him; already, his classmates were shooting him dark looks and whispering the headlines that had run endless circles in his brain those endless hours in his cell, the days into weeks into three months and four days.
Here is a list of things that used to be on the list Harry doesn’t like to think about: becoming quidditch captain. Getting a kiss that doesn’t make him uncomfortable. Touching someone, just—once, for long enough that he might even be able to relax into it. Having sex.
"It’s not—I realize that this may be difficult to believe, but I actually had many other things on my mind at the time," Draco continued, voice gathering speed. "It was a bit of a war zone, if you remember."
how rude it is to cast spells on other people without warning, or does she just not care?” Malfoy shifts, the transfigured bed dipping as he sits up. When Harry doesn’t answer, he asks, “Are you feeling alright?”
“Keep them,” Draco said, that warmth lifting through his chest and making his voice soft and light. He pressed his smiling face against the curve of Potter’s cheek, and thought about kissing him again, thought about the fact that Potter would let him. It was overwhelming in the very best way.
From behind him, heavy steps came up the stairwell. Potter’s voice followed a moment later. “Hey. I thought you wanted to see if Dennis’ dad could get in?”
“That’s what happened when I got my wand,” Potter said, face lit by the glowing bubbles, a suspended Lumos, bobbing over their heads. It was nearly dark, now; Draco had lost all track of the hours, hadn’t even spared a thought to the continued oddity of the situation, or the fact that Potter had remained sitting with him the whole while. “The sparks.”
now.” She proclaimed this with a mix of envy and wistfulness that made Draco’s heart squeeze in his chest. She’d died as a fourth year. She’d never even sat her O.W.L.s.
, because that’s his excuse: he hasn’t figured anything out, nothing at all, and Malfoy smirks and obligingly dips his head back down, and—
“Did she,” Draco said sourly, dropping the bacon directly into his mouth. Professor Sinistra had been good on her word. Just a week after their conversation, she posted a glowing notice with the date of a house meeting—the first Draco could remember since before the war, the welcome meeting notwithstanding—to the notice board.
“I think it sounds nice,” Potter finally said, wistful and quiet. “Molly and Arthur would have come, if they could. Maybe—” He cut himself off abruptly, grief momentarily folding his face, before he shook it off and continued, “Would your parents have?”
The Headmistress was still staring hard at him. “I watched the memory before doing so,” she continued, and Draco inadvertently sucked in a breath.
It was impossible to tell if he was surprised to see Draco sat on the ledge, watching him. The sun had begun to fall, so Potter’s face was mostly shadow, and Draco himself was likely an indistinct blur in the failing light. But he raised a hand, as if he, too, knew Draco, intuitively. He didn’t wave, just held it palm out and fingers splayed, and Draco wondered if perhaps Potter had gone mad, the sorry, sad thing, and did the same gesture back.
Once, a Saturday that Draco spent holed up in a classroom near the kitchens, he’d left to grab lunch and saw Potter rounding the very same corner; they both stopped, short of a crash.
It was objectively horrifying for Draco to know he’d sat in the Hospital Wing and cried all over Madam Pomfrey. He woke this morning with that lingering, wrung out feeling that accompanied a long overdue sob, but—as with any good cry—a bud of relief settled at the bottom of his ribcage as well.
But Potter—he didn’t smile. It was too tense to be a smile. It was something that lightened his face nevertheless, and made him look less haunted. Younger.
Harry lingers in the empty corridor after stepping off the moving staircase, his gut churning. The idea of telling Malfoy that he failed to convince Dumbledore leaves him cold to his fingertips. But he promised to talk to Malfoy after the meeting. So instead of turning in the direction of Gryffindor Tower, Harry heads to their unofficial classroom in a disused area of the dungeon.
"They could," Ron said darkly. Harry agreed; he couldn't see how sharing a bed with Malfoy would end in anything other than a trip to the hospital wing.
But he walked up to read it himself anyways, nudging Queensbury aside. If he were to be dreadfully honest about it, Draco had expected a denial. He knew perfectly well that for all the post-war talks of reconciliation—some that he was certain were lifted straight from literature following the first war—most people in the wizarding world, especially those whose knees Draco sat upon when he was growing up, were unnerved at best by the idea of integrating the worlds any minute amount.
“I made the shelves ring,” Draco said, recalling the vibrations that rippled over him as he swished his wand for the first time. “Like bells.”
; it was only that he and Lavender were dating, after all, and who else was he supposed to talk about these things with, Hermione?
and recited dutifully alongside his many and varied transgressions. Draco had carried illusions of grandeur, and of power, and of ease, but never of bravery; he’d had illusions of
Draco leaned against the open doorway, amused and maybe something else, something he didn’t want to examine too closely, and said, “Surely you own a cloak,” because Potter was only in his uniform sweater and trousers as he fairly ran down the steps, his bag hitting his hip.
“No,” Potter said, smiling slightly like he thought there was something very funny about the question. “But I don’t think I have to be.”
It brought him abruptly back to that first morning after the battle, the grip of her hands in his. The way Narcissa and Lucius had pushed through the dueling bodies to reach Draco, triumphant in that if nothing else. The lie that led to it.
Harry rolled the tip of his quill between his fingers, feeling his ears flame. "Erm, what d'you mean?"
Draco did like, even though he gave Potter a faintly suspicious look at the suggestion. But he laid down and was woken too soon after, having curled towards Potter’s warmth when he slipped into sleep.
Baddock turned back to Draco, straightened his shoulders, and said, “Do you think Goyle would join?”
“Vince,” he said, and found that it hurt to say. He cleared his throat, tried again, “Vince. Hello. I didn’t know you were here.”
Draco ran through these things now, quickly, as a manner of humbling himself before he did something stupid, like mock Potter for his continued inability to string a fucking sentence together.
made Potter laugh before. It was a good, uncomplicated feeling that settled warm and comfortable over his chest, like a duvet first thing in the morning. Safe as the crawl of sunlight against his thighs and the feel of his magic in his hands. Draco had so few things that felt safe these days. Fewer that he could hold onto.
“Well if you’d gone to the meetings, you’d know,” Astoria began, pointedly; she’d invited him last week, and Draco had instead spent the evening repairing a crumbling column at the far edge of the castle, the furthest point of damage from the Battle. “We need to submit it in advance of the meeting.”
Draco had never experienced a Christmas break quite as bizarre as this one. His nightmares, which had abated slightly, returned vengefully while he was holed in his tiny, alien bedroom in his mother’s flat. He found himself stuck in loops of his misdeeds after waking dry-mouthed and fearful, clawing at the phantom pain flaring from his faded Mark. Sometimes he walked into the kitchen and found the strangely tiled floor superimposed with images of blood, found himself thinking of Vince, and of fire, and of the view of the ground from the Owlery, from the Astronomy Tower.
"It's going to be cold again," Malfoy complained after a moment. Harry looked at him; he was still in bed, still frowning hard.
. It was a clear dismissal. Draco, as usual, had gotten so desperately, inexplicably ahead of himself, twisting the world and its inhabitants into something they had never been.
“I don’t know.” Potter had also closed his eyes, but he opened them now; blinked at the sight before them, then turned to blink those green eyes at Draco. “I wanted something normal, I think.”
Potter didn’t acknowledge this; his jaw was still tight when Draco drew level with him. While Potter stared stubbornly out of the window, Draco pulled the folded map out of his bag along with the stack of Potter’s novels. It had been those that made him decide to find Potter despite the way his heart contorted at the thought; the excuse of returned items was much simpler to parse than the fact that Draco was suspended between persistent disbelief and deep, unabiding fear.
His feet are light and flawless, his thighs burning and his chest tight, as he races out of the west exit, closest to the greenhouses, and keeps going. On and on, through the powdery snow and low hills until he’s at the quidditch pitch, serene and white under the moonlight.
Harry has a hold of Malfoy’s left forearm, nails digging mercilessly into the raised edges of the Dark Mark. As if he can claw it off Malfoy’s skin if he just presses far enough.
Any lingering good humor from Myrtle’s comment evaporated completely by the time he made it to the Charms corridor. Draco took a moment to inhale deeply before striding into the classroom without looking at any of the other students gathered there.
“What is it?” Potter asked, arms crossed against his chest. He wasn’t looking at Draco, was glaring rather determinedly at the grass. His breath came out in a puff of white, and Draco cast a warming charm over the two of them instinctively.
Draco made a noncommittal noise, pointedly flipping open his runes dictionary. In truth, he felt vaguely ashamed. Not just about the defacement, which was almost certainly from one of the quietly vocal supporters that still lingered in the Slytherin common room and probably others, but about how nobody had seen fit to do anything about it. How many students had looked and then, just as immediately, looked away?
“Dad couldn’t understand it,” said Creevey. He was sitting on a decorative bench near the cloisters that Draco spent the year avoiding until now, trailing reluctantly behind a surprisingly quick Granger. In the middle of the square was the memorial that sent a fresh wave of guilt into the pit of Draco’s stomach. He avoided looking right at it, thinking it was somewhat like a boggart.
Harry knows a thing or two about greed. The first thing he knows is this: the direct corollary to greed is a want. In order to not be greedy, you must not want anything. This is why Harry has to fold his wants into the tiniest pieces he can, because otherwise someone will notice and take even the scraps away. Learned knowledge.
Harry decided to help him along. "You'd sleep next to a corpse, then. Or were you thinking of smuggling my body out without anyone noticing?" Now that Harry thought about it, could one Vanish a dead body? Couldn't anyone get away with murder that way?
The hole slid shut behind him as Draco tracked the faces and the seemingly uncrossable space between the two sides of the room. It was clear where the division lay, though how the division could be described seemed to change daily: the pureblooded and the Muggleborn; those in favor of keeping the Veil and those who wished to pull it back; the Ministry reformers; the revolutionaries.
Malfoy’s reddens further, and someone—Ron, maybe—tries to interject. But something in Harry’s chest has boiled over and snapped, so he continues, voice rising impossibly louder, “What the fuck are you thinking? He’s going to
If not before, it is now. A different kind of fight, a real one, with wars and prejudices and legacies echoing in the hot, stuffy air of the closed confines of the Hogwarts Express.
wand, the one Potter gave back to him; he hadn’t used his grandmother’s wand in at least three months. He hadn’t even
Draco fled. He took the steps two at a time, faster than the charm moving them, and nearly crashed into the stone gargoyles as they slid open.
Ignoring the stares of the other students, Draco turned neatly, spinning Astoria with him, and stepped determinedly towards the Great Hall.
Draco opened his mouth to say that no, he did not, and never had, and who did Potter think Draco was—
It was such a Hermione-like statement that Harry felt an entirely inappropriate laugh rise in his chest. He squashed it down, but Malfoy could clearly see
“What,” Draco started to ask, distracted immediately by Potter’s other hand sliding up and into his hair, Potter’s mouth catching his again.
“A break couldn’t hurt,” Astoria added, her hair pulled up in a bun and held through with one of the Muggle scrunchies Draco previously saw on Granger’s wrist. She looked to Draco and raised an eyebrow; half of the gathered students followed her lead and looked to Draco as well.
Draco inhaled, and it seemed to happen to a body that didn’t belong to him. In the pause between his inhale and exhale, he imagined the events unfurling: Potter, called into the Headmistress’ office; Officers Abbott-Jones and Evergreen, inquiring after Draco; the explanation Potter must have given about the circumstances around giving Draco his hawthorn wand back, blithely answering any questions they might have had about Draco.
The nearby students had gone quiet; it was a quiet that crawled over Draco’s skin, the kind that was contagious. The whole table was silenced in seconds, air dark and tense.
“Baddock?” Astoria repeated, a little too quickly. She shook her head again, disrupting the neat waves in her hair, and tucked an arm through Draco’s the way Daphne and Pansy used to do. “I can’t go with Baddock.”
She gave him a reprimanding look, sweeping forward to press a hand to his cheek before asking after the trip and fussing at him until he was out of his cloak and hat and seated in the nearby armchair, possibly pilfered from the Manor.
An unlikely cohort awaited Draco, Queensbury, and Baddock in the hallway leading to the western towers. Mostly Gryffindors, with Creevey pacing the length of the hall in agitated impatience, but a few Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs stood to the sides as well. They all looked various degrees of determined or vaguely ill, depending on how close they were to the barrier spells keeping them away from the worst of the damage. Even from down the hall, the nauseous pull of dark magic could be felt.
“What I don’t understand,” Hermione says, when they’re gathered in a room created by the Room of Requirement, simple and sparse in walnut browns and creams, “is why you didn’t go to Dumbledore first thing.”
“Oh,” said Greg, his face lit warmly by the fire. He’d tugged his comforter off the bed; it was wrapped around his shoulders, his bare feet sunk into the dark rug he was sitting on. He was so thin, and so sad, and sitting too close to the fire, a jolt of panic jumping sharply into Draco’s bloodstream at the sight. Instinctive.
It turned out that the Hospital Wing housed a lovely brewing room, small but neat; all smooth stone and adjustable Lumos charms over the two brew stations. It felt like cheating to spend a double period hidden there, doing something as simple as brew a third-year potion to ensure that Madam Pomfrey’s Pepper-Up stock was ready for the influx of colds that pervaded at the beginning of every year.
To Draco’s surprise, she sounded disappointed and hurt that he’d not been there. Without consciously deciding to, he admitted, “My probation officer stopped by yesterday.”
in a fit of mortification and childishness that involved throwing his wand away from him. It clattered towards the doorway to the dormitories, where a pale Baddock stood with a slim, battered case and several magazines clutched to his chest. He looked to Draco and then to Draco’s wand, which had landed near Baddock’s slippered feet, and then back to Draco.
Draco inhaled sharply in surprise; his chest, which had constricted without his noticing, struggled to contain the sudden rush of air. “I—yes.”
So long as Draco didn’t look Potter directly in the eye and avoided all potentially fatal conversational topics, it was quite easy to be Potter’s friend. It was a little like a boggart in that way; if he looked at Potter directly, their relationship would shift to reflect the fears Draco kept buried, and that was not the sort of thing one brought up out of nowhere.
Harry couldn't help but glance up towards the Slytherin table, though, eyes finding Malfoy immediately. Malfoy, too, seemed to be looking for him. They stared at each other for a moment, before Malfoy turned determinedly away, his mouth almost a frown.
have agreed to this tournament had I known someone like you would be participating, Mr. Malfoy. You should be ashamed to show yourself.”
wound, from the time before magic; when Harry was small and thin, and thought that help would come if he only explained what the monster was.
So Harry says, “I don’t know,” because he doesn’t know how to say that soulmates may not be real, but a hundred years from now, Malfoy still will be.
“Malfoy,” he answers coolly, as people disappear further down the train and into the remaining compartments, the first warning whistle at their heels.
“Astoria said she told you about the letter-writing campaign, but you never showed up. Where were you?” Zeller asked. She’d put a bright yellow ribbon in her hair, the bow almost obnoxiously perky given the time of day.
Potter grabbed at Draco’s wrist, pushing them away from him, but he was laughing when he said, “You fucking
Harry pulls his knees to his chest and presses his forehead to them. Malfoy is still holding his hand. It’s stupid, how much that means to him.
He wanted to ask about the check-in; Draco could see it in the way his eyes darted to the other Slytherins and Zeller, as if trying to determine whether he should mention it around them.
With a sniff, Draco added, “Zeller is already causing a minor riot by breaking the line. You lot may well cause a full one.”
They’ve done this enough, by now. Maybe not as often as some dark, unexplored part of Harry would like, but enough that anticipation coils fierce and liquid in his gut when Malfoy sits him on the desk, hands already working at undoing Harry’s trousers.
that Harry doesn’t know how to interpret. Is it a good thing, because Malfoy hasn’t been bullying anyone in the corridors between classes? Or is it a bad thing, because he hasn’t been interacting with anyone, really, keeping himself isolated from the rest of his house and the school? Malfoy’s time is increasingly pulled to the Room of Hidden Things, where two-thirds of their not-Dumbledore plan wait for his repair.
An old impatience rose in Draco’s chest the moment he let himself into his mother’s flat with the key she owled him the week before. He closed the thin door to the small bedroom she’d made for him and barely noticed its furnishing. He opened the gift immediately, pushing aside his trunk and feeling his heart kick about in anticipation. He found, even before he finished ripping the paper off the box, that it would not matter whether Potter’s gift was a good one. Perhaps Potter would be bad at gifts, or perhaps Draco would be impermissibly picky. It wouldn’t matter because that part of Draco that had always wished to have attention, to have Potter’s attention, was already ecstatic over the existence of a gift with his name in Potter’s tiny script.
“How does it work? The magic?” Harry finally thought to ask, when they were nearly at the portrait hole. Their steps had slowed slightly, just enough to show some reluctance to arrive at their destination.
Draco fell upon the task with gladness, hefting the boxes—no magic, as he didn’t know what type of equipment was held in them—to the cabinets along the back wall, next to the storeroom. He was carefully assembling the bandages when Madam Pomfrey appeared at his side with a mug of floral-scented tea and a stern expression.
Still, Draco caught flashes of Greg in the mornings, roused from his sleep and silently shuffling towards the bathroom while Draco remained smothered in the too-hot confines of his sheets, unable to rise. Azkaban and the Ministry holding cells had hollowed Greg of everything, even the anger, and left a wisp of the boy Draco had grown up with, scrubbed raw and still open.
Harry should know better than to want things, is the point. But the third thing he knows is this: no matter how good of an actor you are, greed only grows.
“Well only a little,” Astoria said, her nose tilted upwards. Her face was very cool as well, her dark eyes haughty as they fell on the crowd in front of them. The crowd that was watching them intently, blues and yellows and reds against their twin green and silver. There were so few Slytherins back this year. Astoria’s grip was still tight around Draco’s arm.
“Did you?” Harry repeats. The bald accusation speaks for itself; the chance that the answer will change anything between them is less clear. “Think it was an honor?”
Professor Sprout had returned, her normally jovial expression gone a bit hard. It was unclear exactly how much of this conversation she’d overhead, but she nodded at Zeller’s prompting.
There is a way to explain that he knows Malfoy is a Death Eater without starting by the inexplicable crush of their mouths, without putting words to precisely how he came to see the unsettling blackness of the Dark Mark against achingly soft skin. Harry just hasn’t figured it out yet. All logical and non-incriminating explanations scatter as soon as Harry opens his mouth, reduced to the certainty he’d known, instinctively, that day in Diagon Alley.
“Are you coming to classes again?” Potter asked. He wasn’t even whispering, though to be fair, it was unlikely that anyone heard him given the immediate outbreak of noise that accompanied him sitting at Draco’s side.
him. The line of his nose and the slant of his cheekbones and the taper of his eyebrows. The curl of his pale eyelashes and the curve of his lips and the shape of his jaw. The sweep of his white-blond hair and the delicate set of his ears and the dove grey of his eyes.
“Am I meant to show up by myself, then?” Draco pressed a finger to the gilded frame, its engraved vines twisting away at the touch.
After barely a minute, Potter knocked their knees together. Instinctively, Draco knocked back, and Potter huffed out a small laugh that had Granger’s head snapping towards them like a hunting crup catching scent.
“Are you going to class?” Potter called after him, nearly knocking right into Draco in his haste to catch his wrist.
,” Malfoy argues, finally losing control of his temper. He stalks forward and Harry holds his ground, glaring as Malfoy comes right up to him and grabs his chin in one hand as if
By the time he heard the sounds of his housemates returning, Draco had only three lines for all his thoughts:
It ended up being exactly what they decided, after the vehemence with which both groups refused to sleep in the common room.
He slept fitfully and dreamt of the young girl that hadn’t survived the full moon transformation. The horrible way her screams gave way to howls, then back again; the way she had cried for her mother; the way she had thrown her small body against the walls of the Manor, which Draco only found out about the next morning, when he went out and saw her twisted limbs, the rusted outline of her body colliding against the smooth white stone painted at elbow height. Her eyes had been open, and so had every point of flesh where the bones had broken through.
“Well I haven’t seen you to ask about it,” Potter answered, accusing. He’d dropped his voice, but not by much, and Draco cast a hasty silencing charm when he saw Theo’s head tilt in their direction again.
Madam Pomfrey gave him a very critical look, as if she knew he was inventing the excuse on the spot. After a moment, she gestured to a pair of boxes left near the floo, a familiar logo of Magical Medical Equipment stamped on each side. “It’s for the best, I suppose. We’ve inventory today.”
Draco stoked the embers, carefully. They flickered, just enough to catch weakly. He said, “Greg,” but had nothing to follow it up with. Those two words,
“I was going to break into the quidditch shed,” Draco said absently. He was trying to decide if he liked how close the forest was. He was thinking he did not.
Potter turned his head, towards the owl perches, and said, “Everyone else seems like they wanted to be.”
Malfoy’s white-blond head is bowed over a desk on one side of the room when Harry arrives, half-folded origami and loose parchment haphazardly stacked at his elbow, his inkpot perched improbably atop it. The classroom’s built-in
The Hogwarts Express pulled into the station, drowning out the rest of the conversation on the platform. Half hoping he wouldn’t be heard over its roar, feeling shamed, Draco said, “I didn’t get you anything.”
Most importantly, of course, Draco would remember that Headmaster Dumbledore had known about his task. That Headmaster Dumbledore had known Draco was not a killer, because the Headmaster knew that Draco had been trying, in his ineffectual way, to kill him. That the Headmaster knew that Draco was Marked. That the Headmaster knew that Draco would fail in his task. That the Headmaster knew no one had expected Draco to live. No one expected Draco to live.
The question douses them both in frigid lake water. Harry finds himself blinking stupidly, shocked at his own voice. Malfoy blinks back at him.
There’s always a struggle, and there’s always a victor. That’s what they’ve always been barrelling towards, this ever-present dichotomous swing: kiss or kill, fuck or fight, start a war or end one. The stakes always feel that high, where Draco Malfoy is involved.
An heir going back to the home he was trying to escape had never crossed Harry’s mind. It should have. Malfoy has never questioned Harry's will to fight in the war, but Harry never asked what role
The tone scraped something raw inside Draco. The rest of his explanation shriveled on his tongue, as if having lived it was not enough to convince anyone of the truth that it occurred. As if he
“Of course,” Draco said, faintly, and then couldn’t retain anything else. She asked questions, and he answered, and the buzzing in his chest grew into his limbs, his ears, the roof of his mouth.
Draco stared at the smooth stone columns that held the covered walkway up. There was a dissonance. There was a dissonance ringing high and clear through Draco’s skull, but he couldn’t understand it. It was just out of reach.
So maybe that was why, Draco reasoned. It burned, because there were people who were willing to use what they learned to help complete strangers. It burned, because when Draco had the option, he’d simply turned away or, worse, cast
When the war was on in earnest, several of them were dumped at the Manor because their parents were known or suspected Death Eaters; they couldn’t be used against their parents if they were also secreted away at the Manor, and so long as they were quiet and unobtrusive, nothing—no one—would remember they were there and hurt them. Draco sometimes ate with them—a slight, for his failures and reluctance, to be placed with children, but Draco always welcomed it, even as confused humiliation stung at him.
Draco’s breath came out in a wheeze. The Headmistress looked at him steadily, mouth downturned. After a time, she said, “You do have the option of doing your N.E.W.T.s by owl, if you will not attend classes like the other students.”
a fucking git?” asks Ron, who enjoys covering for the way Harry sometimes goes tongue-tied when he’s supposed to be fighting with Draco by loudly insulting Draco in Harry's stead. At some point, Harry will have to tell him off for it; he's beginning to enjoy it
They took to the repairs in groups, focusing on different areas of the tower as clouds wisped across the sky, the moon impossibly bright. The tip of Draco’s nose grew red and chilled as he moved through the tower. The air coming through the open, jagged wound in the tower wall and the holes at the top of the tower were still winter-crisp, and Thomas—who had exchanged one very terse nod with Draco before being whisked away by Lovegood—performed an artful bit of spellwork to keep the atmosphere in the tower warm despite the occasional gust of cold air.
, he’d said, and Draco remembered, hazy, a childhood memory of his father saying in Borgin and Burkes that perhaps that was all that Draco would be good for: thievery. Petty crimes.
Malfoy lifts his head, at that; tilts it up towards the sky and the stars as he says to the moon, “You’ve done more than you think, Potter.”
Astoria gave his arm a sympathetic pat before going back to her frankly alarming stack of fried eggs and tomatoes. “It’s only that you never talk about it,” she said wisely. “We’ve avoided mentioning it.”
the tosser,” Draco said, stepping into Potter’s space and managing to grab the edge of the pocket again, bodies knocking briefly. “A normal person would just ask after another’s plans for the weekend.”
“Welcome back, Mr. Malfoy,” he heard Headmistress McGonagall say, but it was as if she were speaking through layers and layers of heavy fabric pressed against Draco’s ears.
Baddock took a deep breath. “Look, I know you only signed up so we’d have enough numbers to stay an active team,” he began, in a great, tripping rush, “But the Headmistress says we can’t compete unless
“Sorry,” said Olivia Shardlow, a third year with a small puff of an afro, looking absolutely miserable. She, like Draco, had only won a single round. She, unlike Draco, was absolutely cut up about it.
Draco had never once thought about it. Next to him, Granger was nodding, as if she’d heard this before, or perhaps made the list herself.
“—galling, actually,” Draco found himself saying, agitated energy causing him to pace in a narrow ellipse in front of the large tree Potter eventually sat under. “The Dark Lord killed a half-dozen wandmakers when it was
He stood quickly, his whole body sore and protesting, and spoke over whatever she wanted to say. “I’ll be heading to my dorm. Thank you.”
It was a penance for the vanishing cabinet, when he sat himself neatly on the cold, dirty floor and began the tedious work of undoing the spell damage. Hogwarts was old, centuries of students and professors and visitors having left their tiny imprints, so the resulting magical index was eye-watering and confusing.
But Draco didn’t want to know. There was a significant part of him that was convinced he was misinterpreting everything. He’d been half-convinced about this from the moment Potter spoke to him in the Owlery, sure that he had stumbled upon a part meant to be played by another person and Potter simply hadn’t noticed the mix-up. But surely, surely he would now; or, worse, Potter knew precisely what was happening and meant for it to hurt Draco. And if that was the case, then it was already working, already Draco’s heart was twisting up in his chest and anticipating its inevitable break.
“It is!” This was ridiculous. It was like they were kids again, Draco reflected while tamping down on the urge to stamp his foot against the ground.
“Fuck,” he breathes, before remembering that Malfoy was doing this specifically to distract him from the conversation they need to have about the Manor and what it means for their conversation with Andromeda. He curls a reluctant hand around Malfoy’s wrist. “Wait, wait. I was trying to say something, Malfoy.”
Draco jolted at the sound, his whole body warming as he turned towards Potter. With the confusion of the past few hours, including a particularly drawn-out argument in the Slytherin common room that ate up most of Draco’s morning, he hadn’t yet seen Potter since the wards came down. Or since their kiss, which Draco was recalling with dazzling clarity as Potter stepped into the Owlery, making his hands feel clammy and overlarge.
Harry opened his eyes sleepily, just in time to see Malfoy's eyes close. "Night," he answered. He waited until Malfoy's breathing evened out before adding, in a whisper, "Draco."
"Whereas I," Draco's voice caught, his very ribs feeling on the verge of shaking right apart, "I just wanted to find you."
But it didn’t do to think about Vince. And anyway, Draco had told Baddock and Rose Zeller, the fourth-year Hufflepuff, that he was only ensuring that the sodding team wasn’t disbanded. It wasn’t like there was a wealth of extracurriculars at Hogwarts.
Draco let Potter talk, attempting to reconcile the existence of a mythological object and his own passing ownership of it— “Are you seriously telling me,” Draco demanded about halfway through, outraged, “that I was cowering in my own sick when I had the most powerful wand in the world? Even
The breath Harry huffs out hangs in the air, accusing. “Well, Malfoy,” he says, caustic, “what else am I supposed to call the bastard that’s been buggering me stupid for the past four months?”
At the beginning of sixth year, before he’d successfully ostracized his classmates, before Potter tried to kill him, Pansy had dragged him to the Hospital Wing for extra-strength Pepper-up, convinced he was ill. Madam Pomfrey had given him a bed to rest in and said, in that way of hers,
“He said it wasn’t my concern,” Harry says, interrupting the fit Malfoy is working himself into. Harry stares at his hands, says, “He—I don’t know. I don’t think he believed me.”
Ten minutes later found them in the Entrance Hall, Potter saying, “You don’t think it’s mad, do you,” to which Draco replied, “Of course it’s mad, but that’s hardly ever stopped you before.” He had half of Potter’s books still in his hands and was irritated beyond all belief about it, had half a mind to just chuck them all to the floor, except Potter was—and there was no denying this—Potter was
Potter was right where the map said he would be, in one of the alcoves near Gryffindor Tower with a wide window facing the quidditch pitch. It was bright, sunlight pooling in the window seat that Potter was tucked into, his bag on the floor next to him.
With a flick—of her wrist, not a wand—a stoneware tea service floated over, along with a tin of digestives. “And our house is precisely what I wish to speak with you about,” she started, voice back to a familiar tone from her lectures.
His mother had assured him that her current lodgings were adequate, but Draco knew she was searching for a home or flat large enough to house both of them, and that Draco’s probationary terms regarding his housing post-Hogwarts—no Fidelius charms, anti-apparition wards required, restricted private floo service—made this task significantly more difficult. It would be too much to be kicked out now, when he had no idea whether his mother would be able to take him just yet.
Draco left with the bell, even though he didn’t have classes this morning. He went to the library early, for once on the search for a distinctive head of hair that was not Potter’s.
The former was the hardest for Draco to deal with. He could understand someone wanting to punch him in the face; he often felt the urge when he had the misfortune of looking into a mirror. But he abhorred being ignored, and always had. Now, with a month of conversation limited to Madam Pomfrey’s instructions and the rare, terse sentence from a housemate, Draco felt that old hatred rise again, circling his chest with nowhere to go.
“Perhaps not with me,” she said next, and Draco bit on the inside of his lip to stop a sneer from rising. “We’ve contacted a number of—”
Granger finally came down from the newly completed stairwell, her hair puffing out of its hair band and dropping tiny curls into her face. "Well," she said, with deep skepticism, "How does it work?"
“But you’ll risk it anyways?” Harry asks, with a mixture of disbelief and wry self-awareness. It’s the same thing that led him into the ministry last year, after all. It’s the same thing that lost him Sirius, and it will be his fault this time, too, if Malfoy—
Malfoy is operating under the assumption that he will be returning to the Manor for Yule break. Harry is operating under the assumption that he can talk Malfoy into staying at Hogwarts. Facts at issue include: the increasingly worrying letters from Malfoy’s mother; the vanishing cabinet, still broken; the trustworthiness of Andromeda; the sense of reality crashing heavily around them and forcing them to make sense of the dust.
Harry thinks about it. “Yes,” he says, surprising himself. He’s sore, but that’s—he’s never minded that part. And he slept
Malfoy looks away first, turning his whole body so that Harry mostly has a view of him in three-quarters. His body is a long, tense line when he speaks.
Harry’s attempt to talk with Dumbledore about Malfoy is a failure because the truth of it gets all tangled up in his throat. He just—gets a little worked up, wherever Malfoy is concerned, and Dumbledore’s inscrutable expression doesn’t help his nerves or his rising frustration. Dumbledore stares placidly, insists that Malfoy isn’t Harry’s concern and shuts the conversation down there. Harry, Dumbledore says, has other concerns to focus on.
Potter, with more thoughtfulness than Draco anticipated, said, “I think I do forget, sometimes, Hermione does, too—” but Draco was already halfway down the stairs, no longer listening, the heavy door wedged open with a sticking charm and his school robes transfiguring into a heavy cloak between one step and the next, when Draco said, “Your existence is very sad, did you know?”
Theo turned slightly, to catch Draco’s eye and nudge his head in the direction of the other side of the room. His expression was hard.
“Tests in the Great Hall?” Baddock guessed. He was stabbing at his fried tomatoes and appeared unlikely to stop for long enough to actually eat them. “Or the Ministry practice sessions? The governors said that temporary, isolated disabling of the wards isn’t
“Of course he didn’t,” Malfoy says, sounding—odd. Like there’s something horrible caught in his throat that he doesn’t want to let out. A discordant laugh escapes despite this, something harsh and cutting that ripples across the surface of Harry’s emotions and finds kin in the undertow.
It didn’t take a genius to figure out that Potter was wholly uninterested in the attention people kept attempting to lavish upon him; even Draco could see that, understood that Granger and Weasley were as much as a shield as they were a comfort to Potter. It would be worse, much worse, were he to appear in Godric’s Hollow tomorrow.
Malfoy swiftly implemented a policy entitled Not Worth Speaking About, under which fell such highly inconsequential items such as the arm around the waist; the awkward way with which Harry woke Malfoy up by twisting in his arms and shoving at his shoulder; and the way they had stared at each in a gentle, sleepy sort of confusion before hastily getting as far away as the bed would allow.
It was funny. Draco would stand at the place Headmaster Dumbledore’s body toppled out of the tower, and think about how truly funny it was. How funny, that Dumbledore had offered his help while he was dying, while the school was being invaded; how funny, that Draco thought for a moment that he would be saved, that he
“No,” Potter agreed. Sunlight was beginning to creep onto his thighs, leaving Draco in shadows; Draco watched the incremental progression of it with a twist of his mouth. “Can we get back inside now?”
Faster than Harry could ever remember, they were at the doors of the Entrance Hall. He pushed it open, a gust of warm, end-of-season wind lifting the edges of the cloak up.
Draco stared at him, mind perfectly blank. The absurd urge to laugh rose in him. “I’ve not…” he started, a touch hysterical, and Professor Flitwick patted his arm sympathetically and said, “Of course, there’s still time, so think about it carefully,” before making noise about having a fourth year double period coming up.
Oh, but he had no idea. Draco shrugged, wondering if perhaps courage would spontaneously appear if he held still for long enough.
He looks up, grey eyes searching Harry’s face carefully, cautiously. Waiting, Harry realizes, for him to speak.
His breathing felt like the loudest thing in the room, yet he couldn’t seem to get in enough air. The irregular hitch of his chest was painful and constricting. “I used to—I sometimes go to the Owlery, or anywhere—high,” he explained, helplessly. “I don’t know what else to do.”
“Why?” Potter sat next to Draco, his back to the stone so he was able to look Draco full in the face.
Harry felt this was a merciful policy, as he could privately add his own, intensely embarrassing items under this list and then not speak about them, ever, to anyone, and especially not to Malfoy. It was an especially helpful policy to keep in mind when Hermione, looking tired but unharmed, asked in an undertone how their night had gone as they escaped the common room to head to breakfast.
Worse, Draco was certain that any iteration of those thoughts would cause his mother concern. He didn’t want her to be concerned. He’d promised, to himself if no one else, that he wouldn’t allow her to suffer for his pain. So he stared at his blank parchment until the minutes spilled over into hours.
He half expected that he wouldn't sleep. But eventually the sound of Ron's familiar and newly comforting snoring—so Zabini
The Battle at Hogwarts had been less than six months ago, and Draco could feel the hungry shadow of it in the way Jack Harper muttered, just barely audible,
quit,” she said. Draco turned to look at her, surprised and maybe a tiny bit afraid. He didn’t know Hufflepuffs were capable of sounding so stern. “Or did you forget that we can’t compete without you? There’s still the spring tournaments next term!”
,” Malfoy interrupts, his voice going deceptively light, “to know I rate just above sex toys, in Harry Potter’s listing of potential beaus.”
“No, Malfoy,” Officer Abbott-Jones said, after a long pause. “Your story was verified by both Mr. Potter and the Headmistress. You should have told us, of course, but as you didn’t acquire the wand by force, it’s hardly something to send you back to Azkaban for. Though,” she added, her voice lighter, friendlier, “the next time your boyfriend wants to do something nice for you, tell him to stick to chocolates.”
“Nothing,” Harry responds, feeling flustered. Guilt is a living thing in his throat, growing thicker and darker with every passing day that he doesn’t muster up the courage to tell his best friends about Malfoy. He’s been practicing this part, if only in the space of his own head, since McGonagall’s office: Malfoy is a Death Eater. I saw his Dark Mark. He told me everything.
Ginny looked unsurprised by Potter’s proximity to Draco. “Mum always had us all leave the house when she added rooms to the top of the Burrow,” she said cheerfully, “so probably not.”
Draco had to work very hard to keep his expression level, suppressing the snort that wanted to rise at her blatant lie.
“Oh,” said Baddock in a carefully neutral tone. A few more students trickled into the common room, in various states of wakefulness; the looks sent towards Draco were more considering than they’d been before. Still a far cry from when Draco could comfortably rely on polite friendliness and automatic inclusion, but Draco relieving in its own was.
“Oh,” she cooed, her eerie, unmistakable voice sounding from overhead. Draco looked up to find her perched, cross-legged, on the stall divider, her face scrunched up in sympathy—and not a little bit of glee. She was a horrid gossip. “Draco, what
Heads craned in his direction again, the whole common room crackling with magic and anxious, angry energy.
“That was very good of you,” Astoria Greengrass told him, when he was done. She’d wandered over while he’d been working on the parchment, her pretty face cold and then softening as Draco finished up the charm.
wanted Malfoy to come with him again. It felt like if Malfoy didn't come, then this—this not-friendship would come to a strangely final end.
been, to wonder how, exactly, he’s meant to get a man to open up about the thing he’s most ashamed of.
She turned towards him, mouth pulled into a vicious little smirk. As if she’d been waiting for a chance to confront Draco directly. Perhaps she had been. Draco kept walking, eating up the space between them with that cold anger spurring him forward.
As the conversation began to flow, Potter turned to Draco and asked, in an undertone, “Are you okay? I saw you yesterday, but…”
He means to shout the last bit like a curse, but it comes out wrong. Raw and wet; gorey, like flinging out his still-beating heart. Harry feels shaky and light-headed, putting his hands on Malfoy’s chests and shoving, hard enough to unbalance the both of them.
before he could think twice. He didn’t know the charm Malfoy used to have it fly over to him, but that was easily solved by tossing it at Malfoy’s head as he passed by.
There’s a blot of ink right at the beginning of the sentence. It feels like a truth, to leave it there.
“Maybe she plans on taking us somewhere else to talk?” Harry drags the toe of his trainers through slushy snow, leaning against Malfoy and wondering vaguely if the cloak will hide them both enough to sneak a snog in—they've gotten very good at quick snogs and handjobs in inadvisable places—when he spots a figure that turns his breath to ice.
Draco barked out an incredulous laugh, his body loosened by the sheer gall of Potter. Potter, who felt perfectly fucking entitled to interrogating Draco about—about things Draco didn’t care to elaborate on, but who couldn’t stand Draco’s own inquiries. Who kept—kept
“You’re sure?” Potter’s breath gusted across Draco’s face, his face tilted upwards, his eyes intent.
Draco stilled, his hand pressed against the stone archway. He turned, but only partially, a muted fear running through him. “Yes?”
It’s all very circumspect, because she doesn’t ask what she wants to know outright. She writes, for example,
other protections on the school," Harry said, pulling the cloak off the two of them once they were safely clear of the doors. "Or haven't you read
Thinking about it made his whole body vibrate with a deep, incomprehensible pain. Draco pressed his hand into Vince’ stone, wondering whose decision it had been, to include him in this memorial, and whether they would ever know how desperately thankful Draco was to see it there, impossible to ignore: proof, that Vince had been here, even if no one else was mourning him.
The last Hogsmeade trip of the year takes place on December 14th, the sky overhead muted and insistent with either rain or snow. Harry finds himself glancing upwards during his walk through Hogsmeade, mostly because he doesn’t want to think too hard about his destination and only a little because the color reminds him of Malfoy’s eyes.
A detached, untouchable calm punched through the rising dread. It was a crystalline calm, the sort that enabled Draco to spend evenings melting silverware into heavy links to keep Greyback from the children in the Manor and set bonfires for bodies. A moment where his brain fizzled right through anxiety and into analytics, cold assessment of the situation in front of him, even though his heart was rattling his bones with its frenzied pace.
The last day of break found Draco tucked at one end of the plush couch in the sitting room that was also the parlour that was also the kitchen, unless one counted the half-wall as a divider, which Draco did not. His mother had left for groceries, passing a hand through Draco’s hair before she left as she’d started doing since the previous night. It was nice, and a little strange, but not moreso than everything else since the war. And certainly not moreso than the letter from Potter that Draco held in one hand.
Potter tapped the parchment with the tip of his wand and said, “I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.”
Draco stayed where he was, too warm and too close. His grip on the gift tightened, that warmth spreading through his chest and staying there, overfull. “Happy Christmas, Potter.”
Possibly he was beginning to recognize the heft of guilt as it pressed against his body. He looked to Greg, a slumped blob of black in front of the fireplace, his comforter pooled on the floor underneath him.
Potter, stepping up next to Draco and absolutely covered in dust, except for where his face was protected with an impervious charm, said, “Well, we do need help clearing the rubble. You don’t need much more than a good levitation charm for that.”
“I’m aware.” Draco watched Potter shake his head at something Weasley said and began walking, a touch quicker than the other two.
He was going to be sick, but he could probably make it to the loo first. Perhaps Potter would happen upon Draco there and kill him, properly this time. They were fighting again, after all. Draco sent him an awful, hasty letter the other morning, but Draco understood now the folly of that. It was arrogance. Whatever momentary madness caused those first few weeks had run its course and it was arrogance for Draco to think—
“That was not what I asked,” Draco interrupted, quiet, quivering. Fury lit him, left him lightheaded and impervious. “It’s not a fucking hypothetical situation.”
Just like that, the Slytherin dormitories were reopened. Harry wasn’t sure what to do about the whole Malfoy situation; they hadn't seen each other except for class, and Harry was certain he didn't want to figure out their situation with all their classmates watching.
“I won’t deny that Mr. Malfoy has been acting differently this year,” she says. There’s an emphasis on the word
. The pain was inevitable. Draco had been trying, walking that careful beam, and he’d failed, as he was always meant to.
Harry stays there, inhaling the scent of freshly laundered clothes and sharp cologne and the Malfoy-smell underneath. Stays there until his body stops expecting a blow that he knows, in his head if nowhere else, is not coming.
“It’s not,” Malfoy says barely a heartbeat later. Harry doesn’t quite register that the words are meant for him until he feels the invisible hand on his wrist, stilling its course to where his wand is sheathed. “That’s—mother always said Aunt Andromeda and Aunt Bellatrix looked the most alike.”
“I want to go to Godric’s Hollow,” Potter said, mildly, and Draco awoke immediately. He was confident that he was not meant to actually have this conversation with Potter, but before Draco could point this out, Potter continued, “I’d never been before last year.”
The second thing he knows is this: his very existence is greedy, which is why he is fundamentally unlovable. Being greedy makes you ungrateful; being ungrateful means you’ll never earn affection, and never earning affection means you should just do your best impersonation of a plaster wall until you get so good at the impersonation that you won’t even question why you live in a cupboard anymore.
, except that whatever emotion was on their faces was too much like pity, too much like concern, and Draco was still too fragile from his talk with Madam Pomfrey, from the events of the day before, to feel anything other than threatened by it.
Malfoy's eyes are a distant, overcast sky. Harry brushes his fingers along the side of Malfoy’s neck, to prove to himself that there’s a person there, someone more boy than ghost.
The quiet this question inspired reached well beyond their little triad. Khan, two seats down, dropped the pretense of not listening and in fact scooted closer. She was not the only one.
Malfoy stays where he is, hand outstretched. Harry isn’t sure what expression he’s wearing, but it makes the ghost of a grin appear on Malfoy’s face. He says, “People will notice it. I made it too high.”
Recently, though, the house in Harry’s imagination is low lit, curtains half-open so only a strip of sunlight spills over folded bits of parchment and crowded side tables and soft, discarded jumpers. The echo of worn arguments fades against the soft murmur of music and the sharp scent of cologne lingers in the air. This home is tender like a bruise or something else once painful. Dream knowledge. They weren’t always together, but they ended up that way. Dream knowledge. They have known each other since the beginning.
“Well,” Draco started, pulling away; but Astoria snagged his arm, said, “Oh, don’t be ridiculous. The crowd will be worse when you’re alone. Come along.”
For one breathless minute, Draco thought that he was hallucinating. But then he crouched and pressed a palm to the stone and found that it was real. His fingers followed the carved letters with trembling reverence.
“He’s a prefect,” Draco pointed out, unsure if he was meant to move his arm away. He’d always been a tactile person, but that was before he sullied himself on the wrong side of a war. When he tried to pull out of Astoria’s grip, she simply tightened her hold. “The gobstones bit is a bore, but he’s otherwise inoffensive. And he signed the petition; surely he’d at least consider going.”
“I want,” Harry repeats through clenched teeth, his whole body shaking, “to hold your hand, Malfoy. You berk. You—you
They stood shoulder-to-shoulder, staring down at Vince’s stone, set along the other students as if he belonged there, as if they thought his was a memory that would be cherished and missed. Draco couldn’t help but wonder what Vince’s stone looked like at the beginning of the year; he found himself shamefully glad that he hadn’t checked earlier, certain that it would have been another thing that sent him stumbling upwards, towards the sky.
It was a mix of fear and shame, a certainty that he wouldn’t be welcome and that it would be wrong for him to enter the space anyways. It was, as always, the cowardice that led to deflection, to avoidance. Draco stared intently at the frame of an empty portrait, hands sweaty and lungs tightening.
And then they stood in silence, watching the water ripple with the wind, since anything left between them was Not Worth Speaking About.
The pensieve is one of Malfoy’s less outlandish ideas, making up one part of the two-thirds of their plan, alongside the cabinet. “That’s impressive,” Harry says, because it is. He wishes it’d been fixed before he tried to speak with McGonagall. He wonders if Malfoy prioritized it
The realization left him oddly numb, body very rigid. He’d always assumed that when he got thrown back into Azkaban, he would feel ill and horrified and furious. But there was nothing. Just the singular, ceaseless thought:
with him. And for what part? There were too many for Draco to parse through: their faces tilted towards each other, and Potter’s blithe statement for Draco to let him back into the castle, and the way Draco had stayed up bleary-eyed and anxious instead.
When a week went by without another glimpse of Potter, Draco came to the grim but plausible conclusion that he’d been played a fool and Potter was so grossly discomfited by his behaviour that he had taken to doing what six years of potent animosity had never managed: he was ignoring Draco.
Draco stared at her uncomprehendingly. He was quite certain he would have noticed if Zeller had been resorted in the middle of the school year.
Potter rubbed at his eyes, pressing his glasses up into his curls, and sat up. “Skipping,” he answered, a yawn cracking the word.
Draco dragged his face towards his mother, who was looking at his father. The curiousity surrounding this statement was dim, unimportant; Draco was reveling in the curl of his fingers; Draco was reliving the sounds of Vince’s death.
Malfoy’s fears are shaped like this: a childhood home with blood on the walls that you put there yourself. It’s the bent necks of your parents over a dining room table, and the sound of a snake that could eat you whole circling like a noose. It's a scar you will never be able to remove, no matter how many lines you run through it. It’s the twist of the words
had grown even more insular. Their hands were always reaching for each other, heads always bent close, names always in each other’s mouth. Draco was still jealous of it, of them, but it was fitting that they had each other while Draco had hexes to block and solitary sojourns to suffer.
“But it still worked for you,” Draco said after a moment. It was quiet, now that he’d stopped talking; everyone with sense was at dinner, so there was only the sound of the lake lapping against the shore and the wind rustling the leaves overhead, gently. It was soothing enough for Draco to think this was merely a peculiar dream, borne of sleeplessness.
Harry drags his hands down his face, turning his head to meet Malfoy’s glare straight on. Malfoy is holding himself so stiffly, he looks likely to break.
“I’m serious. He was Marked this summer,” Harry tries. Pitching his voice a little louder, trying to get the information out, he says, “Voldemort wants him to kill Dumbledore.”
Draco stood apart, suspended, remembering the return to the Manor after the Battle. How he’d said, “They’ll all come back here,” as he and his parents listened to more pops of apparition, more crackles of wandfire.
Draco raised an eyebrow in her direction, then made the mistake of looking at Potter as he turned away. Potter’s fist was resting on the desktop, still closed around the letter, an irrepressible grin stretched across his reddened face.
Harry yanks Malfoy forward, their knees and chests crashing against each other gracelessly. It’s not quite a kiss, this scrape of teeth against thin lips, but that doesn’t matter. It never does, really, because the hunger is so big and so irrepressible and so
It’s not something Harry has even considered, for either of them, and now, anxious, he says, “I don’t—I mean, there isn’t—but if you, erm, do you—?”
Draco didn’t allow himself to question the sudden influx of time he was spending with Potter. It was a focused inattention, because Draco knew that once he’d caught the tail of a single question—why him, for example, or why now, or why did it feel so natural, as much as it felt impossible—then the thought would circle hungrily around his brain. It would plague him the way everything else did.
So wrapped up was he in this reminder, that he almost failed to notice the stand-off that met him as he walked into the common room.
It didn’t mean anything, Harry told himself, even as they walked too close and stared too long at each other.
A consensus was hardly likely, and after a few moments, Draco sat back and wondered, quietly, at the table of students in front of him, passionate and well-versed and unafraid despite all the very good reason to be so.
God, but it isn’t. He’d spent the evening before proving just how filthy his mouth could be, and this morning showcasing its sweetness. Harry digs his fingers into the door of the compartment, to distract from the way his stomach is knotting itself.
Draco could pinpoint the exact moment Greg saw it, too. That single sound of a held breath, the air gone tense and quiet. Draco looked off to one corner of the courtyard and became very invested in the crawling ivy that was ambling up and down the column.
Well, Draco thought with a tinge of hysteria, at least the Headmistress couldn’t get mad at him for missing class today.
But there is a pool, and Harry is drowning, or he is being drowned. It depends on the night. Above the water, people are gathered. They’re close, always close enough that they could reach out a hand and draw him out of the water.
Harry, hands twisted into the crisp fabric of Malfoy’s button up, holds himself very still. Like a plaster wall.
There was the unexpected gift delivered by Astoria’s owl the day after Christmas, and the takeaway Narcissa ordered, and the muggle shops they wandered through, Draco trailing behind his mother and thinking of Potter, who he still owed a gift to. A thought occasionally came to Draco during these times, one much delayed, that he was no longer living in the nightmare. That time had continued its march forward, heedless of him. Sometimes the thought came to him at the heels of a sleepless night or a sound that sent him still and useless:
Which was how most everyone ended up stepping through the crumbling walls and onto the grass on the other side, several yards beyond the foliage that Lovegood had lovingly set to rights. Food and drink were laid out on conjured blankets, everything silver and shadowed by moonlight and lazy clouds. Warming charms steamed in the cold, outer layers and wayward rubble transfigured into heavy cloaks and blankets to fight off the wind.
Draco stayed quiet, his pulse beating very close to the surface of his skin. Potter's hand tightened, but not painfully; the grip was a reassurance, though Draco wasn't sure if it was meant to reassure him or Draco.
It was worse those days Draco was a little too reactionary and Potter a little too sharp-tongued, when neither of them had slept well and the draw of the sky or forest felt large, looming. They argued more in the first two weeks back from break than the entire term before it, prodding at the war and the years before it like a festering sore, and each time Draco was certain they’d realize that there was no point to trying to learn differently.
“I’ve not done anything,” Draco muttered, abashed, but Astoria either didn’t hear him or ignored him. She led them purposefully towards the end of the table, where a group of fifth and sixth years were sitting.
“Malfoy, Draco?” the closest guard asked, looking at the list in his hand and not at Draco. “Under the care of Officer Abbott-Jones?”
“You know it’s not the same,” Draco continued, realizing that what he felt was fury, fierce and unexpected. And he wasn’t even sure
Draco put his cup down. Headmistress McGonagall said, “Professor Sinistra spoke to me about the incident in your common room.”
All said, Draco was at his wits end by the time Zeller came through with a gaggle of other yellow-clad fourth years and one very sheepish looking Shardlow.
Potter didn’t answer. Neither did he turn to leave, or even move closer. The longer he stood there, shoulders hunched and hands stuffed in the pockets of his robes, the more uneasy Draco felt.
“As always, you may come to me with any concerns,” Professor Sinistra said, mouth frowning again. “I am your Head of House; you should come to me about any issues you may be struggling with.”
It was empty except for Madam Pomfrey. She stood at the countertop outside of the potions storeroom, a hovering cart stopped at her side. Her head came up from where she was filling individual doses of anti-nausea potion—Draco had brewed it just this week—and she carefully, decisively put her ladle back down.
Here is a secret: Harry doesn’t think he’ll live to see the other side of the war. He’s been in mourning since he was fifteen and Dumbledore first asked what Harry planned to do, after hearing about the prophecy. It feels a lot longer ago than it was.
In short order, Draco had stiffly instructed her on the spells to detect and undo the dark magic lingering in the castle’s structure. Potter seemed perfectly content to stand at Draco’s side and add needless commentary like,
“No,” Draco said hastily, on the edge of a strained laugh. “No, I’ve my-my service hours to do with Madam Pomfrey.”
“Excuse me?” Draco asked, incredulous. He finally lifted his gaze from the parchment to glare at Potter, not caring that his voice had risen slightly. “Am I supposed to spend the rest of the night watching for you on this fucking
Dennis Creevey was the younger brother of a dead boy Draco remembered as a tiny figure behind an upraised camera, which he only remembered because drawing attention to him had been a good way to piss off Potter. He was also the driving force behind the petitions Draco kept seeing; the loss of Colin Creevey had evidently lit some determined flame in the lanky sixth year.
