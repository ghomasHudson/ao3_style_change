He didn't know whether he was relieved or bereft when Neville let out an enormous snort and blinked awake, groggily checking his own watch.
The answer that scared Harry, of course, was: no one.
"Did he?" Harry found himself oddly pleased by this. Then he said, "Hanna? Would you -- would you mind teaching me the charm for those bubbles?"
Harry found the blue robes, and blinked. No wonder he hadn't spotted him. Malfoy was still pale, yes, still thin, still pointed, but he was also, unexpectedly, a man. Not a snivelling soot-covered teenager cowering at his mother's side, but a tall, broad-shouldered, strong-jawed, long-striding man.
"For -- for what?"
"You tidied, there's a difference. Anyway, where do you think you're going?"
This did cheer Harry up, and he tucked the photo back into his pocket. "D'you want to come round for a drink later? I've got absolutely nothing to grade for the first time all term."
. I was
Harry braced himself and a moment later they were whipped away into the darkness, then spat out again with a resounding crack. Harry barely kept his balance long enough to plant his cane on the ground and steady himself, and for a second it was all he could do to stay upright, faintly nauseous from the throb of his left side, gathering his resources for a day that wasn’t nearly finished.
“I’ll keep an eye on him,” Draco said blandly, and put a careful hand on Harry’s back to guide him towards the fireplace. In a much quieter voice, as they picked their way across the pink rug, he said, “Are you sure you’re up for this?”
"Ron," gasped Hermione, "Ron, tell Harry about the time -- the time Ginny made you -- ahahahaha -- made you --"
Well, this was very good news on one front: all of these murderous psychos were Squibs, which meant Harry was the only one in the room with magic. Good odds, those.
Malfoy was nearly smiling when he handed back the picture. "Granger's genes seem to be fighting a losing battle."
Malfoy mixed Neville's margarita -- rather expertly, Harry thought -- and then made Harry something that tasted a bit like Malfoy smelled, woodsy and ambered. It was bitter on the tongue but sweet as it went down. Harry loved it.
"Are you okay?"
He stepped into the flames and said, "Harry Potter's bedroom," and a gut-churning moment later he was spit out into his room. He had a stack of essays to grade and he settled himself into his armchair, pillow beneath his knee, glass of firewhiskey in hand, eyes on the parchments, mind in the sky.
Doesn’t mention that Harry fucking Potter might turn up wands blazing.”
Neville had raised the Floo idea with McGonagall, who'd brought it to the Hogwarts board, who'd brought it to the Regulation of Floo Networks, who'd promised to have an answer by the end of the second week, which meant for now, Harry was stuck running all over the castle and climbing so many stairs that when he demonstrated the Boggart lesson, his own showed up as a staircase.
Normally, to get to the Great Hall, he took a specific set of winding wooden stairs that were valuable both for their sturdy railings and for the fact that almost no one else seemed to know about them, so it was less likely he'd humiliate himself in front of someone, especially a student. He felt that seeing your Defense Against the Dark Arts professor unable to Defend Against the Dark Stairs would make it hard to take him seriously.
"Anyway," Harry said, "I'm all right from here, I think." He paused and said, "You're a good mate, Neville. See you at breakfast?"
"Do you want to come in?" Malfoy was not a blurter-outer, and he did not blurt now. But Harry could tell he had not expected to say this. "In the lake, I mean. It's so hot out."
“Yeah.”
Malfoy gave him a rigid, courtly little bow that might've been mocking or might've just been part of Malfoy's wealthy, inbred, horrid upbringing, or maybe it was just Malfoy, oddly formal, oddly gracious, totally infuriating. He sank down onto the bench and watched Malfoy walk away, and noticed too late he wasn't the only one watching: there was a gaggle of sixth-year girls staring and giggling and whispering behind their hands. Probably incoherent from the sight of their handsome Potions professor in swim trunks. They were looking at Harry, too, and he gave them a tired little wave that set them all giggling again.
His solicitude was disconcerting. Harry wasn't used to associating Malfoy with care or kindness. "Yeah, go on," he said. "I'm happy just to float."
His favorite staircase was on the other side of the sixth floor, a narrow, little-used wooden thing that wound down through its own stone passage, sturdy banisters on both sides and a convenient landing with a windowseat halfway down where he often stopped to rest. He thumped down the hallway towards it, trying desperately to remember his lesson plan for the morning and feeling more like Moody than ever, wild-eyed, jumpy, mental. If he got downstairs within ten minutes he'd only be fifteen minutes late, and that wasn't so bad, was it? It wasn't a fireable offense, right? Would his students wait for him or would they take his lateness as an excuse for a free period?
"My father had his wand in a walking stick for a time," Malfoy said. "Ornamental, but it was the same idea."
Someone raised her hand. "Is it true you were attacked by a troll?"
Ron got the smug look he got when he was about to say something disagreeable. “Has it occurred to you that he might actually just be picking up some venom, perfectly safe?”
Hermione was already smiling. "Oh no."
Draco took back the cup of tea so Harry could work himself reluctantly to his feet, and then, all three of them now clutching mugs, they traipsed back to the front of the shop and waited as Betsy ducked into a closet behind the front desk.
,” said another student. “But you didn’t need a stick before.”
"Would it help if I talked to her, do you think?" Harry said. "If I -- Merlin, I don't know. If I tell her I don't blame her, I'm not angry with her?"
"No," McGonagall said with dignity. "I mean, yes, I'd prefer a more civilized discourse in general, but -- I'm not going to sack you."
"Fish --" Harry dropped his fork, he was laughing so hard "--Fish stew!"
He fixed Draco’s face firmly in his mind: the sardonic eyebrows, those ice-blue eyes, the mouth that could be sneering or sweet. He had to be all right. If he wasn’t, Harry would tear the world apart.
"Yes," Hermione said, "but it's one of the trickiest charms to get right at the best of times, and I can't even nonverbal a simple Lumos charm. I just love watching you do it, it's like going to a show."
"There are some mushrooms in the greenhouse that make you think you're an elephant," Neville suggested. "We could take those? For a lark?"
"Is it cheating if I ask you to hang onto my good shoulder?" Harry asked Malfoy. "Just to keep me up?"
He unspooled the spell that had allowed the sender to dress the Howler up in a nonstandard envelope, and he broke it down into its parts (a concealment charm mixed with an amplification spell mixed with the original Howler formula). He tracked the envelope itself to a small Muggle stationary shop in Brighton and called in a favor from a former colleague, who went to the shop and then owled Harry a list of everyone who’d bought the envelopes, but none of them were even wizards. He called in another favor and got a list of every wizard living in Brighton and began to trace them for pureblood connections, but so far, zilch. He ran a fingerprints charm and found none; a charm that traced biological matter, and found none; and even tried an extremely difficult charm that traced the particulates breathed by the caster of the spell and told Harry what they had for lunch, which was apparently sardines on toast and a boiled egg, which really didn’t shed any light on anything other than how bad their breath must be.
“Like -- like you know me.”
Harry willed himself not to flush. "Er -- he's quite popular, actually. Even has a bit of a fanclub."
"From who?" Harry said. "His mum?" In his experience, it was mostly mums that sent Howlers.
Harry was prejudiced against anything Lucius Malfoy had ever thought a good idea, but it seemed neither polite nor prudent to say this aloud. "Well. I appreciate you thinking about it. About me."
"Er -- dealer's choice," Harry said, tearing himself away from the magazines. He went to the bar and pulled himself up onto a stool, anticipating a world of discomfort, but discovered that beneath the bartop was a raised wooden step on which he could prop his feet. It warmed him greatly that even in Malfoy's subconscious he was thinking of Harry's comfort.
The most powerful wizard of his generation: ha! What use was power if he couldn't use it, couldn't control it? The last time he'd been this desperate, in pain, without his wand, he'd cracked something inside himself and exploded three people so completely that there'd been nothing left of them but teeth. He'd felt it before, the raw crackle of magic with no outlet, the kind of magic that only wizard children possessed and that everyone else grew out of, but Harry never quite had. Uncontrolled; dangerous. Dark. He could feel it in him now, roiling like the curse in his joints, and he was afraid.
“A row?” Harry said airily. “Why do you ask that?”
"Oh, drat," Ron said. "I forgot you're not a baby."
“Preferably not,” she sniffed.
“I’m not the one who can’t sit up under his own steam,” Draco pointed out, pulling a chair up to the side of the couch and sinking into it gracefully. There was something strange about his appearance and it took Harry a moment to realize that someone had put him in an oversized hooded sportsball sweatshirt, so different from his usual carefully-chosen clothing that Harry couldn’t help but smile.
"-- A hundred forty two staircases, and they got a few interviews with students saying they've seen how difficult it is for you, and --"
Like a nightmare he saw himself pocketing his wand, then taking off his dirty robes, swapping them out for the clean ones. He'd swapped the robes; he had not swapped the contents of his pocket.
“Case in point,” said Harry, struggling up the short, muddy slope, Neville half-dragging him. “Problem.”
“But what if you swallow?” Harry said, and laughed delightedly at the look of absolute scandal Neville gave him. The student, thank Merlin, did not seem to get the joke.
Harry did not. Reluctantly, he slowed. Then he pulled up sharp. "Wait -- you knew? You knew it was me who -- who took those things from your office?"
Neville pressed a big hand to Harry's forehead. "I don't think you have a fever, though you are a bit sweaty. Should I call -- someone? Hermione?"
With Kevari’s assistance and a bit of swearing, Harry managed, finally, to get himself upright against the arm of the couch, and downed the Barley-thorn in one long gulp. Almost immediately, his sight began to blur and double -- but the relief was immediate, too, and he let out an involuntary sigh as his cramped hand began to relax, his fingers loosening from their tight curl, his shoulder unfreezing. His hip, which had been playing the part of a piece of wood, began to feel like a body part again, and his knee stopped feeling quite so much like a cup of hot lava.
Harry knew what Draco would say about all this effort: he’d say it didn’t matter. That it was just Howlers, an annoyance, no harm done. But Harry knew how it must weigh on him to be screamed at every morning, another reminder of the past he’d tried so hard to overcome. It was beyond frustrating not to be able to find answers for him.
“Your cane’s out front, come see it!”
"So tempting, but no. There you go, mate, you've got it."
Absolute bloody pandemonium.
“Not at all, what can I do?”
"No," Harry said, going a bit red. "Not until just now."
Malfoy, for the first time, looked at Harry as if he were almost human. "Yes. I think it might help. If you felt -- if you feel you could."
," he corrected. "That was before half my body quit working."
In fact, she came in just a moment later, right as the kettle began whistling.
Meekly, they went, and Harry felt supremely grateful. Neville was crouched by his side, saying, in panicky tones, "Harry, what's happened?"
"The first Hogsmeade weekend's in October," Hermione said encouragingly. "Just three months away. You'll be so busy you won't even have time to miss us."
"Have you been getting around all right so far?"
The class quieted at his words, again looking aghast, and Harry sighed. "Thank you, Galen," he said.
"Yes, I hear it's like flying on an armchair," McGonagall said.
"Sounds – not inaccurate."
"What's with the lilies?"
There were plenty of people out on the main street despite the weather, and Harry flagged one down immediately – a stout woman in a pink coat – to ask after the Ragged Pony.
"You should be ashamed," Ron said. "Hermione held her liquor better than you!"
“Are you employed by this pub?” Harry demanded.
Neville gave him a fond, exasperated look. “You forget I’ve known you twenty years,” he said.
"Stop lecturing him, 'Mione," Ron said. "Give him a kiss and let him go."
“I’m not being too subtle?”
Now, both McGonagall and Malfoy said, "Yes." They glanced at one another, and Malfoy beckoned for McGonagall to go first.
"Perfect," said Harry. He was meeting Ron and Hermione at 4. "It's a date."
"I'm glad to have him," Neville said loyally.
It came up again, however, in his next class – “Professor Potter! Are you all right?” – and again in the next, and then all the rest of the day. By dinner time Harry was so sick of it he had half a mind to stow the cane in a closet and never bring it back out.
"I didn't, I cleaned up!"
Harry had a vision of himself, suddenly, as Kreacher -- Kreacher as he'd once been, sneaking around in plain sight as if no one could see him, muttering obscenities and insults as if no one could hear him. He, Harry, was no better than a mad old house elf, thinking he was being so subtle, so secretive, when really he was broadcasting loud and clear to anyone around him,
“Yes, how did you --?” Draco glanced down at his ankles. “Oh. Yes. But I’m very particular, it’s only this exact shade. I can’t stand pumpkin, for example. What about you? Let me guess: green.”
“Lizzie’s the one who found the ritual,” Abigail pointed out. “
“Oh, I don’t think so,” said Kevari. “This house hasn’t got a Floo, however, and he’s in no shape to apparate on his own, so he’ll need a chaperone getting back to Hogwarts. If you wouldn’t mind, I think it’s best if you –"
He was
"How many people know?"
“Nice bit of work, that,” Negasi said, admiring it. “Okay, ready?”
Ron put Rosie, shrieking, on a blanket on the floor, and came over to help Harry with the zipper. Then he dug the Floo map out of a drawer by the fireplace and handed it to Harry, peering over his shoulder. There were two public Floos in Brighton and Harry chose the one closest to the center of town, in a hidden room of an old hotel a few blocks from the marina. Once he arrived he’d ask someone where the Ragged Pony was and apparate there.
“Just so,” said Harry, and dared a leading comment. “Anyway, this is tremendously exciting. If the ritual works…” He shrugged his shoulder – the good one, but even that sent spasms of pain down his back, and he worked to keep the wince from his face.
Quite a long time later, maybe an hour, maybe two, maybe no more than ten minutes, Harry got his good arm beneath him and managed to sit up, dragging his stiff leg as he propped himself up against the wall. His hands were trembling uncontrollably from the pain but he managed to pat himself down and make sure nothing -- else -- had broken, which thank Merlin, it had not. All his working limbs were still working. All his non-functional limbs were still non-functional. His head was intact, his glasses were still on his face. To his deep shame, he'd only fallen about two steps.
They scampered out, still laughing incomprehensibly. Harry shook his head and glanced at his desk. At least his ink was open.
“Thanks, no, I’ll never get back up,” Harry said. “Could I borrow a coat, though? I ran off without grabbing one and the cold’s making me go all stiff.”
Harry looked down at himself. "It's a -- erm, a mixture of a ceramics charm for sculpting bowls, a landscaping charm for trimming topiary, and a bit of snow-plowing."
tume," Harry accused.
to touch him -- it was because he’d needed more hands-on care than he ever had in the past. There were the Healers at St. Mungo’s, of course, who’d had their hands on him night and day, poking, prodding, lifting, patting; and then when he’d stayed at Ron and Hermione’s for that month after he’d been released, his friends had constantly been helping him on and off the couch, helping him get dressed in the morning and undressed at night, letting him cling to them on the small, shuffling walks he’d used to take around the block. Even nowadays that he was as healed as he was ever going to be, he was forever taking peoples’ hands to get to his feet, or leaning on offered arms to get up stairs, or feeling people grab him if he stumbled.
He wanted to rumple Draco’s perfect hair and wrinkle Draco’s lovely shirt and bite his smooth white neck. He wanted to bruise those prim lips with kisses. He wanted to undo everything proper about Draco and turn him into an absolutely delicious mess, and then he wanted to clean him up again.
"Verbal, Potter."
The morbidity of the question put him on edge until he remembered something. Muggles had portable phones these days, didn’t they? Quite useful-seeming, actually – none of this wondering if someone had gotten your Patronus or not. “Yes,” Harry said. “My phone. It’s… dead.”
Neville rushed over to coo at what was, Harry learned, a fresh bud, and actually he had to admit it
“Yeah,” Harry said. He took a long, slow breath and finally looked around at where they were. A drizzling grey sky, a rolling field of damp grass, clumps of trees, a dilapidated barn, and some ways away, a house. “Is that it, the Debs’ home?”
He grinned as he stepped through into his bedroom. Now, this was more like it. It looked almost exactly like the room he'd shared with Ron in Gryffindor, except with its own private bath and one bed in place of four. A bed which looked so comfortable Harry couldn't help but sit down with a groan of relief. He took out his wand and lowered the trunk to the floor, then flicked it open and accio'd one of his remaining pain potions, downing it in one go despite the atrocious flavor -- and despite the fact that he was supposed to take it with food. Well, it would be fine if he ate within the hour, and dinner was right around the corner.
But his knee, thank Merlin, was Locked. It was the only thing that kept him from pitching forward and falling down those dark stairs to his certain death. That, and the hand he’d flung out automatically to grab the doorframe, nearly dropping his cane. He tightened his grip, aghast at the thought of having come close to letting his wand go.
"No!" Harry said, too loudly. "No, thanks, but -- no."
“You don’t mean to say
“Yeah?”
He wilted. “Because I’m a prat.”
"Oh," Harry said. Had he not spoken aloud just now? "Yeah, sometimes. When I'm not really thinking about it."
“Healer Kevari,” Draco said, sitting upright on his chair. His voice was perfectly even, perfectly mannered, and he wiped his chin neatly with his sleeve, like a gentleman at dinner. “How nice to see you.”
“Bugger off,” Ron muttered, and slunk after his wife, casting dark looks over his shoulder as the two of them vanished around the corner again.
“You’ll go see Draco straightaway, though, won’t you?” implored Hermione. “You won’t let your history together get in the way of your healing?”
“Where’s my wand?”
“You’re quiet,” Draco said. “It’s unnerving.”
“No,” Harry said, “but thanks, really, Ron. One of my old colleagues – you remember Negasi? – he’ll meet me there, and two others should be headed to Goyle’s family home right now. Maybe it’s overkill, but again, I’d rather be overprepared than under.”
"No, I'm just disgusted with the bureaucracy around this place. It shouldn't be this sodding difficult to get you better accommodations. Beauxbatons is a hundred percent accessible in every corner, they've had wizards bending over backwards to figure out spells to avoid things like stairs. You want to know why there are no disabled students at Hogwarts? They go abroad for their education."
have said, is thank you. For being you.” A ghost of a smirk. “Whoever that is.”
married name of the Squib formerly called Lizzie Goyle. Her Muggle husband must be – no, had to be – Dougie Debs, who owned this bar. As Harry had told Neville earlier, there was no such thing as a coincidence.
He woke up an hour later with a gasp, agony rocking through him. His leg was on fire, it was getting cursed all over again, his shoulder was being pulled from its socket and rotated, he couldn't even breathe for the pain of it. The pain potion was on his nightstand and he managed to fumble a vial free and pop the cork one handed, chugging it desperately then lying back and counting the seconds, trying not to vomit or scream,
this year."
"Potter," McGonagall said, her fingers closing around the wrist of his bad arm, and he stopped, effectively tethered. "I didn't mean to offend."
He swallowed down potions through the next few hours of classes, and as soon as his final class ended he went to his office, wrote a memo announcing the cancellation of all Professor Potter's classes for the next day, and got into bed.
“Hardly, I haven’t solved, like, world hunger, but yeah, to tell you the truth, I’m pretty proud of this design. And I haven’t even told you the best part yet.”
"Yes."
Negasi snorted. “Could’ve fooled me. And fooled that barkeep, too.”
With that, he took two decisive strides forward, and dove.
The door flew open. Malfoy was behind his desk, as he always was, looking like someone had posed him for a portrait: Still Life of Young Professor with Lilies.
Malfoy's next batch of potions put Harry into a sixty-second nap at four-ten instead of four-twenty, but his students had grown used to it by now and it was at most a minor inconvenience. He'd been at Hogwarts a month already, September nearly gone, and he was settling into the rhythm of things -- the hectic schoolweek, and then the slow weekends spent grading papers, writing to Ron and Hermione, or going out to sit by the lake with a notebook and a jug of pumpkin juice.
he was being baited, he was sure of it -- but damned if it wasn't effective bait.
He settled into his chair, McGonagall to his left and Neville to his right, stretching out his leg beneath the table with a wince before turning his attention to the scene in front of him.
It took Harry a moment to realize this last was addressed to him. "Oh, I -- 180 centimeters, thereabouts."
He couldn’t face the Great Hall so he had the house elves bring him his meals in his chambers, and because he was a pathetic, hypocritical fool, he wished he and Malfoy weren’t fighting so that Malfoy would come and check on him. There was something steadying about his presence, something grounding, and Harry could have used that solidity. When his pain was this bad it made him feel half-severed from the world, like he existed somehow outside of it, outside of everyone he knew, outside of even himself.
Malfoy made room in the fireplace as Harry approached the green flames, and a moment later they were blendered away to the Great Hall. Harry staggered a bit as they landed, like he always did, and he was surprised to feel Malfoy's hand under his elbow, steadying him. Another hand was at his back, and it stayed there as he got his balance and stumbled out into the busy Great Hall, where dinner was already underway. Heads turned towards him as always, whispers followed, but he was far less of a sensation now that he had so many of these students in class. They were less interested in Harry Potter now that they knew him as Professor Potter, which made him inordinately happy. Some of them called hello to him as he passed -- and many of them also called out to Malfoy. Not only Slytherins, but students from every house, cheerily waving and saying, "Hi Professor Malfoy!" and "Professor Malfoy, I found six blue-slimed slugs, d'you want them?" and "Professor, did you grade my essay yet?"
“On it,” Negasi said, nodding as he rose from his crouch. “Can you send a Patronus to Nimpkins and tell him our plan? He’s with two others at the Goyle mansion. And sit down for a minute, Harry, would you? You look as if you’re about to fall over.”
He sucked in a breath and put his good hand on the table, levering himself carefully upright and hoping no one noticed the grip he kept on the back of Neville's chair. He looked out into the sea of young faces, turned towards him like sunflowers, and cleared his throat.
“Well,” said Harry, “you know…”
“Hi, Healer Kevari,” said Harry, who was more than familiar with the man. Kevari had been his attending Healer at St. Mungo’s.
"First, I have to ask you a few questions that will no doubt make you angry," Malfoy said. "I'd rather not be shouted at, but if you must, you must."
one soon!"
good at, and procrastinated. He rationed his potions to one a day, taking one with breakfast at eight and then toughing it out when it began to wear off around four. This unfortunately meant his last class of the day got a notably less kind and patient Professor, but after that he was free to go to his rooms and take a hot bath and be in pain in peace. He arranged with the house elves to have dinner in his own chambers, at least until he refilled the potions, and all in all it was a bearable arrangement.
Before he could think better, he knocked.
"Well, I think
“Bunch of cars out back,” Negasi said. “More than you’d expect for one family.”
” Harry said.
"What," he said, looking around at them, "are you fighting, already? Why aren't you chattering to one another?"
"Yes. If you're looking for exact numbers, for a -- a project, or something, the Headmistress may be able to tell you."
Harry pushed hair out of his eyes. "No, Jenny, just a regular staircase."
“Glen,” he said, awkwardly hooking his cane over his left arm so he could shake. Selwyn. That was a Pureblood family name, wasn’t it? He’d known Selwyns at Hogwarts; Slytherins, all.
"Four twenty pm, clockwork," Harry said. "Out for a full minute, then bang, I'm up, like nothing ever happened."
Malfoy

“Yes,” Harry snapped. “You’d think people have only just noticed that I’m – that I’m not the most mobile person in the first place. I guess seeing tangible evidence of it is somehow distressing.”
Kevari looked disbelieving. “Well, let’s have a look, shall we?”
Malfoy looked at the vase on his desk. "They're... pretty?"
"No," Harry agreed. "But -- it's okay to love him anyway, and to be sad he's gone. If it were my dad, I'd be very sad, no matter what."
"And did your potion work?"
Harry was somewhat startled by this side of Malfoy, serious and professional. He nodded.
Harry closed his other eye and let Kevari fuss over him for a few long minutes, the Healer’s wand tap-tapping across his body, prodding his joints, poking his muscles, sometimes feeling icy, sometimes tingly and hot. When he’d first been hurt, Harry had demanded to know and understand absolutely everything the Healers were doing to him and why, but by this point he didn’t care. He was just happy to be sitting on something soft with a pain tonic moving through his system and Draco Malfoy safe in the other room. Draco Malfoy, who
This is a bit of a short one but I hope you enjoy it. Also, I might have to skip a day or two of posting depending on how much of my Real Life I get managed this weekend, so fair warning! Thank you for reading <3
“Shit,” Harry said, staggering over to him, trying to see if he was injured. He had a split lip but no other visible wounds and he widened his eyes up at Harry, clearly imploring him to remove the Silencing charm. It was a charm that could backfire horribly if improperly broken so Harry forced himself to pause and take a steadying breath, trying to focus in the midst of his clamoring mind: relief at seeing Negasi, worry for Draco, the pain of his body, he shoved it all down. He held his wand carefully to Negasi’s throat and said, “Sonorus!”
"I wouldn't claim to know anything -- except that it's clearly been injured, and you clearly don't want anyone noticing."
"Hi Professor Malfoy," Harry said, still grinning.
To Harry's delight, Neville was waiting for him outside the Great Hall, beaming in a swirling mass of students. Though he saw Neville regularly, he somehow always managed to forget how unnervingly good-looking he'd gotten, and had to take a moment to transpose the chubby-faced child from his memory onto this tall, handsome man.
By three pm the following day, he'd ridden out the last of the withdrawal agonies and vowed never to make another potion again in his entire wretched life. Neville came by to check on him in the evening, and Harry met him in his office, looking so terrible that Neville actually gasped.
“That was nice,” Draco said, holding the door for Harry.
"He's probably poisoning you slowly," Ron said darkly. "A potion to make you think he's halfway decent."
“Definitely,” Harry promised. “Anyway, Malfoy and I will be back before you know it.”
Everyone was looking at Harry, smiling benevolently, and he would've been embarrassed about this attention but he was too delighted. No more stairs! Maybe he wouldn't even need to brew any more potion!
They were perfectly cordial to one another at mealtimes, but gone was the closeness and camaraderie that had been slowly, sweetly building. Perhaps Harry was imagining it, but Draco looked more tired than usual, circles beneath his eyes and his blond hair tousled instead of impeccably groomed, but he had forfeited the right to ask if Draco was okay. And Draco, for his part, did not inquire after Harry’s well-being, either.
Hanna gave him a speculative look and crossed her arms. "I'll tell you, Professor," she said. "But if you don't like it, you can't be angry with me. And you can't tell anyone I've told, they already call me a teacher's pet and they'll be furious."
Thanks for your patience, this update came slow but I hope you enjoy it!
McGonagall and Neville were both gazing up at him in astonishment. “I don’t know,” McGonagall said. “But it can’t be terribly –”
grading. I thought it was like -- their after-class hobby. They always seemed to so relish handing back the low marks."
Finally, Malfoy turned. "Also," he said, "I don't know if you've heard, but my mother cut off all her hair, married a Muggle woman, and is now living in a lesbian commune in Greece, so -- there's also that."
"Okay and so what you're looking for is a cane that can conceal your wand in its handle, right? With some kind of mechanism for easy access, that's what Draco told me."
However, as the Sorting began, and went on, and on, and on, it became clear that five disgusting jellybeans were not exactly what the Healers had meant when they'd specified "food." Harry's leg began to ache halfway through the Ms, and by the time they reached the Zs he was in a world of discomfort from sitting for so long. Normally this was when he'd stand up, pace about a bit, stretch it out, but he couldn't very well do that in front of the whole school.
Which meant Harry had something he could offer Draco; which meant they could finally make up.
“Weasley,” Draco sniffed back. Then, to Hermione, in much nicer tones, “Hello, Minister. Congratulations on your recent Wizengamot win for mandatory house elf labor law.”
"I know," Malfoy said. He looked at the flowers again and touched one of their petals with a slim finger, then dropped his hand. "What brings you to my office?"
"What's that supposed to mean?"
Kevari looked deeply amused, and too-late Harry remembered that the Healer had seen them in a rather compromising position. “Is that what he is?” Kevari said. “Hogwarts must be a fascinating place to work, if that’s how one treats one’s colleagues there.”
"Is it cheating?" Malfoy asked Neville solemnly. Neville shook his head no, seeming totally unsurprised by Harry's reference to his good arm, so maybe Malfoy was right after all and everyone already knew, and it wasn't actually as big a deal as it'd felt a few months ago. Malfoy's hand on his shoulder was firm and supportive and it steadied him enough to take some weight off his other arm. His bad hand lay curled palm-up like a dead mouse, but he managed to crook his fingers enough to thread the cue through them.
“Eat something first, Harry,” Neville urged.
Harry felt conflicted about asking a student to choose between her professor and her social group, but curiosity, as it always did with him, won out. "You have my word. Go on."
Harry barely heard him. All of his focus was on his hand sitting in Draco’s.
“How’s this for subtle,” Draco said, and let go of Harry’s hand. Harry mourned the lack of contact for exactly two seconds – until Draco leaned forward, and forward, and forward, until his snowmelt blue eyes were mere inches from Harry’s own, no less beautiful for the bruise swollen thick around one of them. He reached up and trailed the backs of his fingers down Harry’s jaw, then, very slowly, he swiped the pad of his thumb across Harry’s bottom lip. Harry shivered. There was dried blood in Draco’s hair, on his cheek, on his mouth, but Harry didn’t care. He smelled of amber and woodsmoke and he was so close now that Harry could feel his breath ghosting across Harry’s own lips as he spoke.
The bell over the front door jingled as someone else came in, and Betsy glanced to her new customer with a bright smile. “Be right with you!” She turned back to Harry. “We just need to activate the security charm so no one can get that wand out except you. Okay so I’m gonna tap this with my wand, then you have to press the knot and remove and insert your wand three times, so it gets to know you, got it?”
Harry Potter looked around the messy living room of the Hogsmeade cottage where he'd spent so many of his nights over the past years, cataloguing everything he'd miss. There was the green velvet couch that had so sweetly cradled his head the nights he'd drunk too much to apparate home; there was the overstuffed armchair where he'd curled up on countless evenings, gossiping, joking, complaining about work; there, folded in the corner, was the cot he'd slept on for a month last year, when he'd first gotten out of St. Mungo's; and there, in the doorway, were Ron and Hermione, owners of the cottage, watching him with mingled looks of fondness and exasperation.
The man said, “Yeah.”
Inspired, Harry said, "Yes!"
"They rigged my fireplace," Malfoy said, gesturing. "So we can take the Floo. I expect that's been a welcome change for you, has it?"
"My wand's upstairs, or I would've sent for someone myself. I'm sorry you left class for this."
There, a few smiles. Merlin, they were young, and innocent, their eleven year-old faces as unformed as puppies. He sat at his desk, glancing at the parchment in his hand.
Harry turned to face him, feeling both desire and irritation licking at him like the Floo flames. “What?”
"Well, good luck staying awake during the faculty meeting. They're dry as uncooked macaroni."
Hanna stopped several steps below the landing, her dark eyes wide with fear. "Professor, are you all right? It's -- it's time for class."
“You don’t think they’ll recognize you?”
"The pain," Harry said. "Will it be like earlier?"
"I offered, didn't I?"
“You got blasted.”
Peas went everywhere.
"That's -- I don't mind."
Malfoy shrugged off the thanks. "You're not in any pain? Any more than usual, I mean?"
Harry hmmmed an affirmative.
She dashed away to grab a chair from a nearby table and then sat down beside Harry, absentmindedly grabbing hold of her daughter's little socked foot and bending to kiss it. "How are you faring? How's your health?"
"Oh, well done, Draco," Neville said admiringly.
“Harry,” Neville said as he came up to the faculty table. “Nice to see you up and about. How’re you feeling?”
"If word gets out," Harry said, practically panting now, both with anger and because they were going up a rather steep hill, "If word gets out that it's not just my leg, it's my arm, too, it's half my sodding body, it'll just make it that much easier for anyone to take me down. They'll know all my weaknesses, they'll be able to plan, they'll come after me, and the next time that happens, it's over, I'm done for. I can't fight anymore, not like this."
, you'll have trouble getting around..."
To Harry’s great interest, Draco raised his wand, which was glowing a soft yellow. Kevari leaned forward, eyes closed, and Draco gently touched his wand to the Healer’s temple, which lit up in that same soft yellow glow. They stood like that for a moment or two, both utterly focused, and Harry took the opportunity to have a long, hard, longing stare at Draco.
"I hate giving out anything below passing," Malfoy said, frowning. "I've had quite enough of playing the villain for one lifetime."
“You talked to Draco about me?” Harry said, torn between anger and wanting to know every single word of every single thing Draco had said.
"Oh, you're soused too, are you?" George said, grinning.
“What could top this?” Harry said, already engrossed with repeatedly popping his wand in and out of the handle.
And now it was just Harry and a pack of magicless Squibs, and it should’ve been an easy job, breaking free and getting to Malfoy, but the grip on his bad arm wrenched it even further, his shoulder screaming, his whole back seizing up, and he was in so much pain he was breathless with it, unable to get enough air to form the words for a spell. He pointed his wand at whoever was holding his arm – Abigail, it was Abigail -- and let out a nonverbal gust of magic that shoved her back and away, but though the pressure loosened the pain didn’t, and it was happening, the thing he’d feared most, his body was betraying him. His vision was swimming and every bone and muscle and joint was working in tandem to get his brain to shut down, to plunge him into blessed unconsciousness where nothing would hurt. Desperately, he pointed his wand at Malfoy’s chains just as people came at him from both sides, ramming into his bad arm, kicking his bad leg, grabbing hold of his good wand arm and pulling it down as the spell broke free, shot across the room – and missed.
Unfortunately, Harry could barely move either. His cane was still standing at magical attention by the bar, but he was far too keyed-up to imagine putting his wand away and so he reluctantly left the cane, and the much-needed support it would’ve offered, behind. Lurching like a man on the tail end of a bender, Harry dragged himself behind the bar to search for any evidence that might tell him what the fuck had just happened, and where the fuck Draco might be. He planned to question the wizards he’d just knocked out but long experience had taught him that the more information he had going in, the better the information he’d manage to get out of them.
Harry couldn’t help but feel stung by this, but he tried not to let it show.
"No, it isn't unreasonable. But also, no, you're not useless."
Malfoy took a sharp breath through his pierced nose. "Don't be an idiot. What happened? You've fallen and you can't get up?"
“You be good,” Harry sputtered.
"He'll be fine if you lot stop gawking at him," Malfoy said, and flung a pointer finger towards the door. "Go. I'm not joking, go on."
Harry had to ask. "Lived together like...
"Ah," Harry said. "That's -- not ideal."
"Here, Potter, pass this to Professor Soobs," McGonagall said, and attempted to hand him an enormous platter of roast beef. Before he could figure out a way to casually take out his wand and float it down the table, Malfoy, who was sitting across from them, stood abruptly and leaned to take it out of McGonagall's surprised hands.
He wasn't what you might call comfortable that morning, still wrung-out from his stupid adventure in self-medicating, and the knowledge that he had no relief to look forward to was distracting in and of itself. It was, he realized, the first day since he'd been injured that he'd have no medication whatsoever. He'd sent an owl to St. Mungo's begging them yet again to deliver the potions to him and had had an owl back with just three words: Give It Up! His options were getting narrow and narrower, and most of them rhymed with Baco Talfoy.
"Hello, Franny."
But why should Harry care what Malfoy thought of his body? It's not as if he'd be looking, would he? Certainly not like Harry knew he'd be looking at Malfoy, but that was only because Malfoy was gorgeous; anyone would look. And the water looked so cold, so inviting...
“Happened?” Harry said, confused.
“Give it to me,” Harry repeated. He put steel into his voice and although he was aware of other people’s eyes on them, he didn’t break his gaze from Malfoy’s. After a moment, Malfoy shrugged minutely and gave Harry that treacherously lovely envelope. Harry nodded and stowed it in his bag and Malfoy left, shoulders slightly hunched and squared against the stares of his students.
A different first year piped up. “Why’ve you got a stick with you?”
find me in time. I would’ve died in that basement if you hadn’t. Whatever else happened, I can live with it, because I’m alive.”
"Ooooh, you should've seen him when I told him you were hurt," she said gleefully. "He dropped an entire cauldron of StoneRot potion, they still haven't figured out how to patch the hole in the floor."
“You’re
Harry was high on simmering anger and it took a moment for him to come down enough to say, "What?"
"It's not about me feeling better!"
"We expect to complete construction within a month."
"Oh. Yes. Sorry." He sat gingerly on his desk, stiff leg propped to one side. "As you can see, my knee's not working properly today, so I've frozen it in place with a Locking charm. This is a variation on which curse, do you think?"
Malfoy rolled his eyes. "Sappy, but I'll accept."
Malfoy?"
The answer, it turned out was yes, he could stand – kind of. It took both Kevari and Draco to get him to his feet, but once he was up he found he could walk all right, though it hurt even through the strong pain potion. He took a slow, limping turn around the living room, trying to limber up, grip tight on his cane and one eye squinted shut so he didn’t get dizzy from the Barley-thorn. He studiously did not reflect on the fact that his resemblance to Mad-Eye Moody must be in even greater effect than usual.
“McGonagall told me,” Neville said. “He –"
"Hang on, sorry, mind if we --?"
Instantly he was awake, wand at the ready. Someone was coming through the little path in the trees, someone in blue shorts, their pale legs long and lean, with a white shirt and pale white face. Draco Malfoy, a red towel slung around his neck, pulled up short when he saw Harry.
, and that was one of the reasons Harry had always liked him – the man was always up for a laugh, game for a joke. “Well, no,” Roberts conceded, “you look a right mess. What I meant was, it’s very good to see you.”
"What are we toasting?" Harry asked. "To old times?"
“That’s not embarrassing,” Harry said quietly.
"No," she said, "but you probably would've noticed sooner that one of your staff was struggling, and put up a railing. You're right, it isn't difficult and we should have done it sooner. It'll be in by tomorrow."
“I’ve seen you put away a fair amount of liquor and barely show it,” Harry said. “I can’t imagine you…” he grinned at Draco’s phrase, “sozzled.”
"I know," he said, hand still up to stop her coming closer, "I've had a fall, I'm okay, but I do need a bit of help, so if you could get the Professor..."
It was almost the end of October, and the weather, which had been lovely and crisp, took a sudden dismal turn. It rained for an entire weekend straight, a cold, relentless rain that churned the grounds to pure mud and made the old stone castle feel damp and chilled no matter how many roaring fires one lit. Harry piled logs in the hearth and blankets on his bed but still he woke up wrecked, his hip and knee grinding like rusted hinges and his hand so stiff he couldn’t uncurl his fingers. His shoulder, which was usually the least of his worries, sent shooting pains through his back and neck every time he tried to move it, and pulling on his robes was sheer torture. He spent that whole miserable weekend alternating between hot baths and sitting in a chair pulled as close to the fire as he could manage without burning himself, trying to grade essays or work on his textbook but really just counting down the minutes until he could drink another potion.
"It's not just your class," Malfoy said. "She's withdrawn in general."
He had spent a pleasant few hours inventing an enchantment that let him manipulate the ground, sculpting it into little hills and ridges, and he was able to prop himself up perfectly to his comfort, his back and head pillowed by one grassy mound, another beneath his knees, another supporting his bad arm so he could prop his hand in his lap and hold his book down. An earthen recliner. There was a spot on the grounds he particularly liked even though it was a bit of a hike: thick, soft grass in a copse of trees, far from where the students tended to gather and with a perfect view of the vast, crystalline waters of the lake. There was a little sandy beach below where sometimes Harry saw footprints, though he'd yet to see another person.
The two men waited as the spell zipped around the house, searching out other humans, and though it only took three minutes it felt like an eternity. Anything might happen in three minutes; anything might happen to Draco while he, Harry, stood ineffectually in the foyer awaiting a little puff of blue fucking light. He leaned his good shoulder against a wall, trying to breathe through the thudding pain that threatened to split his body in two, then he glanced at Negasi. He wondered if this was how his Auror team had felt when they were searching for him – helpless, frightened, furious, determined.
“Not often, no… a few times a month? Sometimes more.”
Draco raised the brow above his unbruised eye. “Are you bribing me, old man?”
“I just wanted to check you were really all right,” Draco said. “You seem –”
"Wait!" he called after her. "Wait, Chloé. Come here. Sit."
He’d used to be so much better about intuiting these things. It did not help that most of his physical contact over the last year and a half had been with people trying to help him. He’d been touched a
Harry half-smiled. "Love it. Though to be honest, I'd trade it for not having shouted at McGonagall."
“That could have its own comic appeal,” Draco said, handing Harry a mug of tea.
"I wanted to talk with you about a student. One of yours. A Slytherin, I mean. Chloé Barnes."
As they began settling in their seats, a owl swooped into the classroom and fluttered around before alighting on Harry’s desk, an envelope in its beak.
“Because you have quite aggressively overworked a set of very curse-damaged joints that ought not have been worked at all,” Draco said. “You need heat, massage, pain potion, and probably a week in bed; but you’ll be all right.”
"Or you could come with me," Harry said. "If you wanted to, I mean. If that's interesting to you. Or not."
"That's exactly what I said when she tried to serve me a plate of that stuff!"
"I feel like you probably have some nice liquor hidden around here somewhere."
"You thought I'd – what -- poison you?"
It was made more intimidating by the fact that he, Harry, had recently undergone a rather serious life change, a change he hadn’t chosen for himself, a change he was still struggling with daily, a change that had rewritten huge parts of what he thought he knew about himself. Maybe that was why he bristled so when Draco called him “Harry Potter,” with all its connotations of power and heroism and able-bodied action. Ever since he’d gotten on the Hogwarts Express and sat next to Ron and realized that everybody knew who he was except for him, he had never quite felt like that image of “Harry Potter.” Now, even less so. Who even
"Potter," he said. "Rough morning?"
Harry had most of his weight on his good right leg but still the bad one had begun trembling uncontrollably, and he shoved the letter back into his pocket so he could take his wand from his mouth and Lock his knee. His mind was racing through this new information. In the owl he’d sent to the Aurors he’d told them to go to the Goyle estate, where Malfoy’s old friend Gregory lived, but he wondered suddenly if he should have asked them to check out Lizzie’s house instead. He’d discounted her from any real mischief because she was a Squib who’d married a Muggle, and nothing seemed like a clearer denunciation of her family’s Pureblood ideals, but now he was not so sure.
"You're smashed," Ron said fondly, taking out his own wand. "Here, hold still. Okay, up we get."
“Welcome back,” Roberts said.
"I've looked into it," Harry said, which was true, though not recently. "I can't."
They stopped on the first landing, and Neville said, "D'you want me to -- I could levitate you up?"
“Did you – want this?” Draco said uncertainly.
"Neville," he said. "Have you got a biscuit or something on you? Chocolate frog? Anything?"
“I suppose it’s natural, to be curious about your professors,” Harry said. “But – I don’t think
“Lovely,” Draco answered for him. “Thank you, Weasley, for your concern.”
“That’s a tactic,” said Negasi. “But not a very good one.”
"I did, too," Harry said. They'd reached the stairs to the platform with the faculty tables and Malfoy paused to wait as Harry took them slowly. Aside from the hangover, he'd really been feeling all right that morning, and so it was a shock when, out of nowhere, his knee buckled out from under him. He reached frantically for something, anything, but there was no railing to grip and nothing to hold onto and it was happening, the thing he'd been dreading since day one, he was going to hit the ground in front of all his students and they'd never be able to look at him again without seeing him flat on the ground, and –
“What --?” Ron said.
He repeated the message he’d written to Negasi and Ron repeated it back to him, nodding, as Harry stepped forward into the green flames. They were blessedly warm against his aching joints and he savored it for one moment, before saying very loudly and clearly, “Brighton Public Floo Number One.”
"I hate when you do that," Harry muttered to Ron, unLocking his knee so he could sit down, and trying not to groan as he bent it beneath him. But he couldn't stay mad, because Rosie had screeched at the sight of him and was reaching out with fat, freckled arms. "Hello, pet. Oh, Merlin, you've gotten even cuter, how's that possible?"
"This is a lot of pressure," Malfoy said, when they looked to him. "Not to mention perhaps more psychologically revealing than I'd bargained for. What if there's a sex dungeon in there?"
“First order of business,” said Kevari, “is a strong pain potion, I think.”
," she said, tossing her head as if her hair were more than an inch long, which it wasn't. "About... well, it started with the Floo network, don't ask me
Harry smiled weakly and Neville, on his other side, said, "Good job!", in the encouraging tones one might use for a child's indecipherable stick figure drawing.
On Monday, Harry had the delightful experience of making an entire classroom of first years scream when he staggered out of the new Floo system in the classroom's hitherto unused fireplace. He patted soot from his robes and limped to his desk, moving carefully, not eager to fall again anytime soon. But Malfoy's potion was so far proving excellent; he had more range of motion in his hip and was able to lift his arm higher than he had in recent memory.
"Erm," Neville said. He clearly did not know what to say if he wasn’t allowed to fuss. "How -- is everything? Otherwise?"
The next morning, Malfoy stopped him outside the Great Hall before breakfast. Harry looked at him blearily, a bit hungover from the half-bottle of firewhiskey he and Neville had drunk to celebrate – and commiserate -- their first day.
"No," Harry said hurriedly, "no, that's all right, I'm sure I'll be fine." He'd figure something out, something that didn't involve Draco bloody Malfoy. In the meantime, he resigned himself to leaving early for breakfast each morning, early enough to accommodate five staircases and, let's face it, five little sit-downs between them. He could use a sit-down right now, but such a luxury didn't appear to be forthcoming.
“Draco,” he said, going limp with relief. He blinked at the blond blur over Negasi’s shoulder, and a moment later, Draco bent his face into view. It was the best thing Harry had ever seen – split lip, black eye and all. “Merlin, I’m glad you’re all right.”
He did not let go.
"If you consent to the potion, you will have thirty minutes in which you will feel no pain whatsoever. It sounds nice, I know, but it's also dangerous, because pain is a good communicator. Any damage you do to yourself is still damage, whether or not you feel it, so although you're going to want to move quickly, it is imperative that you move as you normally would. Understand?"
“Of people rescued by the great Harry Potter.”
been a prat; but he’d been a prat because he was – well, he was frightened. The way he felt about Draco… it did not feel casual. Couldn’t be casual, not with their history, not with the fact that they’d known each other twenty bloody years, and that was an intimidating thing to confront.
At first the man made no reply, but then, grudgingly, he shook his head. “No. ‘S a Muggle pub, I’m no Muggle.”
"What the fuck do you think you know about my arm, Malfoy?" Anger was so much more comfortable than shame.
Ron had nobly agreed to be that evening's Appointed Apparator, so he switched to Butterbeer around dinnertime and was relatively sober by the time they were ready to go. He took his wife first, Hermione's arms twined around his neck as she sloppily attempted to kiss his nose, then came back for Harry, who'd been attempting to Lock his knee but kept misfiring.
“A Muggle!” Harry said, laughing, brain working overtime to process what she was saying. A Squib? Were all of these people Squibs, then? “Merlin, no. Squib all the way through.”
“What’re you smiling about?” Kevari said, a smile in his own voice. “You’re about to be in a bed for a week.”
“Look, mate,” Negasi said, crouching down next to him, “you’re already under arrest for attacking an Auror. Cooperating now’s probably your best bet to avoiding Azkaban. But if you don’t want to talk, I’m sure one of these other two will. Wonder what they’ll say about you.”
"Yes."
"If you'd like to go put your trunk down, I'll wait here," McGonagall said, settling herself on the sofa, and Harry made his way through the door at the back of his office and through a wooden passageway to his rooms.
"I've tweaked the St. Mungo's recipe and made you a new potion," Malfoy said shortly. "It has the same curse-dampening power but it also targets pain of the joints, and it's a twelve-hour formula that doesn't need food as a binder, so you won't have to plan everything around snack time anymore. Here's a week's supply, test it out and we'll arrange a meeting next week to discuss it. I ask that you keep a detailed record of your reaction to it, both positive and negative, all right? It should be more effective, but it also might have some new side effects, and I need to know what they are."
"Were you going to
Malfoy waited til the students had passed and then he said, "No."
Harry fit the key in the lock and pushed the door open, blinking at the golden evening light that streamed through the large windows.
"Er -- my rooms?"
“Yes, absolutely sozzled.” Draco was sitting very upright as he said this, the picture of a prim young gentleman.
“Merlin,” said Harry. “That’s awful.”
“Oh, yes – there’ll be chairs by the Cute Snailwort.”
Harry had absolutely no idea how to respond to this. Frantically, he tried to think what Hermione would want him to say.
Gibson Ackley, pureblood, Voldemort champion, had lost his fortune in the war and never gotten over it. He'd been one of three wizards who'd devised the meticulous, years-in-the-making plan to capture Harry, torture him, cripple him, and obliviate him so thoroughly he'd be left mindless and broken. They'd fully succeeded at the first two jobs; gotten halfway through the third; and failed the fourth. Harry, wandless and barely conscious, had exploded Gibson Ackley's head.
Everywhere, but mostly on Harry, and the silver tureen clattered down onto a gravy boat so he was covered in gravy as well, lovely, and some mashed potatoes for good measure, because why not?
Malfoy smiled when Harry showed him the letter over breakfast. "She does go on a bit, doesn't she?"
“Hi!” “Hi Professors!” “Hello!” squealed Jacob’s minions.
"Yeah, I think it was a -- a 24-hour bug. I should be fine by the morning." Some measure of fine, anyway.
It was like any Muggle pub at one pm, all dark wood and hanging yellow glass lamps, televisions blaring the latest Muggle sportsball match for the two solitary customers drinking their pints at the bar, and the space was small and empty enough that Harry could see with a single sweep of his eyes that Draco was not here. At least not in the pub itself – there were no doubt plenty of back rooms.
Harry very nearly smiled. “We could go with an old standby,” he said. “I go round the front, you go round the back? My sneaking days are
He was chained to a bolted-down metal chair in the middle of the room, shirtless, his lower lip split and his blond hair bloodied, one eye badly swollen, and it was unclear whether or not he was conscious. His head was slumped forward against his bare chest, hands fastened behind him, legs strapped down. He was alive, though; Harry could tell immediately, could see him breathing, and he was flooded with a relief so intense that for a moment he felt no pain. The sight of Draco was a pain potion in and of itself, the curve of his strong shoulders, the sweep of his hair, the sight of his orange socks peeking from beneath his trouser hem. Harry allowed himself one single moment to look, to bask in a wave of pure solace.
“Yes, well, Draco shouldn’t do my job for me, but he’s right,” said Kevari. “Your shoulder affects your back and neck and we don’t want to let that get too bad, or you’ll really be in trouble down the road. I see you’ve used a Locking charm on your knee recently, do you do that often?”
Malfoy, Harry realized, with absolute shock, was
Malfoy narrowed his eyes, that little diamond nose stud flashing, the world's tiniest, sexiest distraction. "It’s not actually the worst idea I've ever heard. I'll be curious to see how it works."
“All right, Harry?” he asked.
She gave him the sympathetic smile of a much older person and patted his shoulder. "Don't worry, Professor."
“Fucking hell!” Negasi gasped. “Am I glad to see you! Get me out of these chains!”
“Oh, sod off,” Harry said, with no heat. “That’s not how it was.”
“No, nothing like that, but – she did worry there’d be – grudges.” Neville chewed a thumbnail, eyeing Harry, then blurted, “So you see, you’re not the only one with a chip on your shoulder!”
“We’ll find out,” said Harry, somewhat grimly. “Pass me my cane?”
Harry swallowed. He hated the reminder that the pain would be back.
Harry stood up every now and then to Lock his knee and take a turn around the pub so his traitorous body wouldn't stiffen too badly, and though his passage was watched covertly and followed by whispers, overall it seemed people had learned from the HOUSE RULES and did not try and approach him, over than to nod a little and smile when they caught his eye. Like Hermione, he appreciated it.
“Hang on,” Harry said, “I want to hear this, sorry, but is there anywhere I could sit down?”
“Er – same as ever, no complaints.”
"Not about -- what happened to you on the stairs, but yeah, they know you've come to teach here and they know Hogwarts has a hundred staircases --"
Harry began to make his careful way forward, relishing the feeling of the fresh water closing around his ankles, his shins, his aching knee, his thighs. Malfoy went in again with him, some meters away, and a prickle on the back of his neck caused Harry to glance his way. They were both waist-deep in the blue water, and --
Harry sighed, staring up at the canopy. He hadn't expected to feel so
to solve – and meanwhile Draco’s convinced you still think of him as a Death Eater and you’ve only tolerated his company this long because you’re bored and because he makes you potions and –”
Hanna's hand flew up. "Locomotor Mortis, the Leg-Locker Curse!"
“Don’t say that,” Harry said, with more ferocity than he’d intended.
Maybe he should cry? Would he feel better if he cried? He wanted to, but it would probably hurt, so better just focus on his breathing, focus on believing that the pain would eventually ebb, the sick throb of the curses would eventually recede, eventually he'd be able to get up, not now, but eventually, soon, any minute.
He hauled himself up and stumped gracelessly to the stairs, where he had the horrible realization that there was absolutely no way of getting down them without some form of support -- preferably a
Harry started to formulate an irritated explanation of why this was an impenetrably stupid idea, but as he tried to come up with one, he realized that maybe it wasn't so stupid at all. Maybe it was actually quite good.
Ron and Hermione, it turned out, had been only half-right. The semester was flying by, but Harry did, in fact, have time to miss them, and he went into disproportionate agonies when they sent him an owl with a photograph of Rosie displaying a brand-new bottom tooth. He made the trek all the way to the Herbology greenhouse to find Neville and show him.
"Relax, Potter, I didn't mean to disparage her. I've been following her career, for obvious reasons, and I've been quite impressed with some of the legislation she's written. You must be proud."
"Yes, or -- or make fun of me, or... Merlin, it sounds stupid said out loud."
"Thank you for meeting us on short notice," Draco said, fondly tugging on a lock of her long hair.
George let out a bellow of laughter. "Oh, this is rich. Tell us more, Harry, go on."
"I'm glad you've come. I've been wanting to talk to you. I wanted to say --" he swallowed with some difficulty. "I wanted to say that I'm sorry about your dad. I didn't... I didn't want it to be like that."
"I fell asleep," Harry said. "I did not
"Hanna," Harry said, jolting awake from a potioned doze.
"No," the man said affronted, "Get your own bloody chair."
Second period, unfortunately, was not so easy. They were smack in the middle of a hands-on lesson about protective charms and Harry couldn’t change his lesson plan without substantially derailing everything, so he tucked his bad hand carefully in his pocket and grimly stood at the front of the class demonstrating charm after charm, and then dragged himself all around the classroom to watch different groups of students try them out.
He sat down heavily in his chair, digging his fingers surreptitiously into his hip beneath cover of the table, and after a slightly stunned moment, the students began dutifully clapping. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Malfoy staring at him with quirked brows, and at his side Professor McGonagall muttered, "Let's hope you're a better teacher than you are an orator, Potter."
"All right," Harry said slowly.
“Are you twelve?” said Draco. “No, don’t answer that, I knew you at twelve. Yes, of course I
Malfoy took Harry's bad arm to help him along, and though it didn't hurt a bit, Harry thought of Malfoy's warning and said, "If you're that bent on helping, the other side'll be more useful."
Harry had not expected Draco to have such an ebullient friend, and over Betsy's head he was grinning at Harry like he could tell she was a surprise. Harry pulled his wand from his coat pocket and held it out hesitantly, loathe to let go; it felt oddly intimate to let someone else hold his wand. (That's what she said, supplied his treacherous brain.) Betsy took it very carefully and weighed it in her hands, and for a moment she just looked at it, her hazel eyes preternaturally focused.
Still, he couldn’t help but tense as he heard footsteps approach on the other side of the door. Then came the click of a lock; then the slow turn of the doorknob. He gripped his cane, finger poised on the knob in the wood that would release his wand, and was ready for action when the door opened.
Slowly, the classroom was restored to order. When it happened again the next day, he awoke to find only a few people up and panicking, and by the third day, he awoke to find everyone in their seats, patiently waiting for his sixty-second nap to finish.
"I wanted to know," McGonagall said, picking a piece of napkin out of her broccoli casserole, "if you'd referee for Quidditch this season. You've been requested."
"Well, why should you? It isn't your problem."
This no-nonsense agreement made Harry feel even worse. "Professor --"
Breaking into Malfoy's office later that night was almost laughably simple. Invisibility cloak plus twelve years' experience as an Auror plus an employee development course he'd taken a few summers ago on ward-breaking plus the universal faculty lock meant that Harry was in and out with the potions ingredients in under ten minutes. Malfoy, bless him, was fantastically organized, and he had no trouble finding the ingredients on the list.
"How on earth would I know? Anyone who's been watching you, I expect." Malfoy's voice got a bit softer, which was worse. "I didn't mean to imply I've talked of it with anyone, I haven't. It's entirely possible I'm the only one who's noticed. McGonagall certainly hasn't, she keeps trying to pass you the heaviest things on the dinner table."
Harry put his head in his hand. This had to be a test, didn't it? Say yes, and he'd be giving Malfoy permission to poison him. The answer should be easy: get Longbottom. But Harry was in so much pain -- and had been for so long. The thought of even thirty minutes without it was a temptation greater than anything the Mirror of Erised could've shown him. Would he risk his life for it?
"Erm -- not as such. It only lasted an hour, and the withdrawal..." He shook his head.
There were three steep steps up to the red front door, and Harry grit his teeth and did not let himself worry about how difficult he found the action of climbing them. If he worried about that, he’d have to worry about everything else: how his left shoulder had seized up so badly in the cold rain that he couldn’t fully turn his head, how his left hand was curled stiff and useless in his pocket, how every step he took was one step closer to discovering the limits of his body’s endurance. Instead he worried about Draco.
"What about detention?" Galen demanded, outraged. "If Hanna here calls you a crippled berk, will we all go to detention with her?"
And the matter was set aside – in conversation. Not, unfortunately, in Harry’s head. He couldn’t keep his thoughts from frothing like an over-stirred potion.
"Not bloody likely," he said.
Harry ignored him but the man let out a truly powerful groan.
“Wait!” said Draco.
"Yeah. I'm not going to be particularly quick today, I'm afraid."
here. He might move like an old man, but he was still young, wasn't he? Still in his prime?
"Here we go, love," Ron said, reaching out for his daughter. He gripped her beneath her armpits and tugged, then frowned. Tugged again. She wouldn't budge. "Harry, did you put a Sticking charm on my child?"
"Oh, for heaven's sake," said McGonagall. "I hope you told them to put their noses right out of it."
Then he turned his attention to the rest of the room.
“Poetic,” said Draco. He leaned to the side to pick up the kettle sitting by the coffeemaker. “I’m going to make some tea. Who knows how long Betsy will be out there chatting.”
"Well, maybe just spread the rumor? That we're not -- doing that? We're not involved?"
“Lumos,” she said immediately. “I remember my sister coming home from Hogwarts and lighting up our bedroom late at night, and I was so jealous I could barely think.”
Even through his embarrassment, Harry felt a strange pang when he heard Malfoy call Neville by his first name. Neville rushed over with the chair and Malfoy lowered Harry down into it. To Harry's horror, a crowd of students was gathering at the foot of the shallow steps, drawn like sharks to blood by the smell of drama, and one of them called, "Is Professor Potter all right?"
“The other night, you mean? When you put your dinner all over yourself and then went vaguely catatonic and then tried to run away without talking to anyone?”
"I don't want to answer the bloody question."
Neville had the tact to remain silent on this point, and for a while they just stared at the Cute Snailwort and thought their own separate thoughts. Harry
Harry began the business of getting to his feet as quickly as possible, which was, in terms of difficulty, pretty much on par with knocking out three very large wizards. He put his wand between his teeth and reached out to grip the metal leg of a barstool – thank Merlin it was bolted in place – and managed to get himself up on his good knee, then readjusted his grip and pulled himself up inch by horrible inch. Effective, but deeply unpleasant, and he was panting audibly by the time he was standing.
"Well..." Harry hedged.
"Looks like we're colleagues," Malfoy said. "For now." He flashed white teeth and Harry flashed his temper.
Harry wasn’t sure how to answer that. “I don’t need it now, necessarily, either,” he said. “But it’s helpful to have. Like you don’t strictly need a fork to eat pasta, do you, but it’s certainly helpful.”
"Case in point," Harry said, gesturing to his body.
"Well, I didn't know you were a Healer, did I?"
"I was hoping we'd have more time before the Start-of-Term feast," she said, starting off down the hall with no fanfare, "but we've little under an hour so your tour will have to be quick."
This news was met with confused silence, and Harry took the opportunity to launch into the lesson. For the first time, Chloé Barnes raised her hand to very quietly answer one of his questions, and while it wasn't much, it felt like progress.
Harry laughed weakly and Neville managed a tremulous smile. "They're fastracking the inter-castle Floo network," Neville said. "Should be ready by next week. The Daily Prophet wrote an absolutely scathing article, it --"
"Wow. How did you --?"
Merlin have mercy! Only the most powerful Patronus can defeat it, so thank
He went back to Malfoy’s desk, eyeing the chair and deciding it would probably be best not to give into the urge to sit, so he set his balance and disengaged his wand from his cane yet again. He reached for the bottle of ink and the quill that sat at the corner of the desk and pulled them towards him.
"No, really, that isn't necessary," Harry said. "I just need to sit for a bit and I'll be right as rain, please, please, would you all just go back to your lunches?"
Malfoy took out a small notebook and said, "I'll pencil you in for a 6pm next Friday. I'll owl you a reminder on Thursday."
Neville dug into his pocket and came up with five linty brown Every Flavor Beans. "I didn't eat them because they're cardboard flavored," he said apologetically, but Harry would take what he could get. He swallowed them quickly, trying not to make a face. Hopefully something was better than nothing.
A hand shot up. Parkinson, Galen. Snub-nosed and somehow familiar. Oh, Merlin, he did remember hearing that Pansy had popped one out right after school...
Harry was suddenly more interested in Betsy. He'd never heard Malfoy refer to anyone as a good friend before, and he was interested to see what Malfoy's friends looked like these days. You could tell so much about a person from their friends -- and even more from they way they interacted with their friends.
“Oh dear,” said Kevari, opening his eyes and looking at Harry.
By the time Harry made it down the muddy road to the Debs’ porch, his borrowed pink fleece jacket was the only thing standing between him and complete saturation. The rest of him – shoes, pants, glasses – were soaked with a light but fast-falling rain. The only bright spot was that his hair, which normally had a habit of standing somewhat upright, was heavy enough with water that it was easy to brush down across his forehead to hide his telltale scar.
All good news came with a clause.
"No, the Floo Network!" Neville said excitedly. "I wonder if we can set up Floo stations on each floor -- you've got a fireplace in your classroom, haven't you? And your office, too, I expect. You can't Floo in and out of Hogwarts, but I bet you can Floo within it!"
“Ah, so you’re a masochist.”
to believe me, they're having a wonderful time."
"Is that -- are you actually feeling sorry for me?"
"Ron," Harry pleaded, but the man was already standing up -- and up, and up. He was very tall, very muscled, very bearded, and he was scowling down at Harry.
His appearance made quite an impression on the students, who all began giggling for no reason Harry could discern.
Harry tried to speak but couldn't. He felt wretched and frightened and above all, exposed.
"Fuck," Harry said. "Fucking fuck."
"Sorry," Harry shouted above them, "Sorry, that's my rule!" A rule he was only just making up this very instant. "If one of you does well, you all do well! If one of you goes down, you all go down."
“Oh shit –” the man said, but not in time to duck the Petrificus Totalis spell Harry had sent flying. The man went rigid and toppled over backwards into the house with a mighty thud, eyes rolling in panic. Harry set his jaw and, feeling both determined and rather villainous, he stepped around the man’s body and into the house.
"This is an emergency pain tonic," Malfoy said. "It's extremely powerful and extremely dangerous, so I need to explain it before I can administer it, and you need to give me verbal confirmation and consent that you understand. All right?"
"I'm glad." Malfoy glanced down at the slippery cobblestones. "Do you want to take my arm?"
"And, and a fake firebolt!"
They passed Ron and Hermione’s street and Harry felt a pang of guilt for not getting in touch with his friends to tell them he was down, but as he’d said to the students, they were here strictly on business, not pleasure.
How had this happened? How had they become
"Hello, darlings!" she said. "Oh, Harry, it's lovely to see you! You're looking thin, aren't they feeding you?"
"I had to fall down a flight of stairs for that to be a priority," Harry said, but the fight was draining out of him and in its wake was his old friend: shining, shimmering shame. "Fuck," he said. He put a hand to the wall, trying to keep his balance. "Don't listen to me, I'm -- I'm just tired, and -- an arsehole, and I shouldn't have spoken to you like that, I really shouldn't have. Go on and sack me, I deserve it."
And float he did, stretched out on his back, limbs loose, watching the clouds, feeling cool and light and cradled. Malfoy swam out, out, out, then back; out, out, out, then back. It was rare for Harry to watch this kind of physical prowess without feeling jealous, but for some reason, when he watched Malfoy he only felt content. Why had he not been swimming this whole time? What had he been thinking, sitting beside the lake but never getting into it? Soon it would be too cold. Harry had wasted so much time.
“Thank you again,” Harry said. “For thinking of this in the first place, and for introducing me to Betsy.” Impulsively, he added, “You have to let me buy you dinner, as a token of my appreciation.”
Kevari snorted. “Oh, are we in America now? You don’t pay me a knut. I happen to know
Everyone began clapping and Harry clapped too, and then McGonagall stood and made a speech and Harry gritted his teeth and tried to smile, hungry and tired and a bit groggy from pain, and then suddenly McGonagall was staring at him -- and so was Neville, and so was everyone, and hadn't he once had a nightmare exactly like this, only naked?
Draco was the first thing he saw.
Malfoy stared at him, and then burst out laughing. It was so rare to see him laugh that Harry could never help laughing along with him when it happened. "Considering you've broken into this very office,” Malfoy said, “I assume you know that's true. Dark or light?"
“Of course it is.” Negasi hesitated. “But if they do recognize you?”
"My knee," Harry said, clutching Malfoy's arm like a debutante at a ball, "it's bollocksed."
“Be careful!” Ron shouted, and the flames swallowed him up.
"I'll get Poppy," McGonagall said anxiously.
“Okay,” Betsy said, and grinned. “Now, give me that gorgeous wand of yours and let’s see how this goes.”
One minute passed. One and a half. A minute forty five.
“Right,” Draco said. “Well, this is embarrassing.”
“Oh!” Jacob said, his whole small face suffused with joy. “Are you going out to dinner?”
"Steady," Malfoy said, right in his ear. He had an arm around Harry's waist and a shoulder under his good arm, keeping him upright. Malfoy had caught him.
"I am," Harry said fiercely. So proud he couldn't say anything more on the subject without getting choked up. "And your old school friends? Have you kept in touch with any of them?" The wankers, he added silently.
A familiar face swam into view above him. Dark skin, furrowed brow, a pair of big, shining, concerned eyes. “Are you awake?” Negasi said anxiously, then shouted, “He’s awake!”
“I go to trivia nights at the local,” the man said glumly. “Damn my luck, Mum’s going to murder me. I always manage to get myself hired by the baddies.”
He led Harry through several rows of thick, mysterious plants, some of them swaying in a nonexistent breeze, some of them covered in spikes, some of them curling and uncurling their leaves like coquettes as Harry and Neville passed. The Cute Snailwort was in a pot in the corner, and sure enough there were two lawn chairs set up in front of it, one of which was occupied by a seventh-year girl Harry only vaguely recognized. She leaped up when she saw the two of them approach.
“Harry?” Draco said, concerned. “Are you in pain?”
“Protect him? From what?”
But even as he thought this, he realized that Muggles and Squibs couldn’t cast rituals. Which meant there had to be another wizard present, after all.
All this had taken roughly twelve seconds.
Hermione furrowed her brow. “No. Why, should he have? Hello, Draco. You’re looking well.”
"Big round glasses!" shrieked a little girl excitedly. "And a fake scar!"
"We must all be on the lookout," McGonagall said. "Double-check your own locks and wards as soon as you're able, and make certain that any valuable or potent equipment is well-hidden. The prefects will be going through the common rooms and bedrooms this evening to see if we can recover any of these stolen items. Now, third announcement: shall we allow armadillos as student pets? Discuss."
Harry sighed. They were coming up to the greenhouse, now, and the ground was growing muddier beneath their feet from water runoff – muddier, and much slipperier, harder to manage even with the cane.
At first he thought he was imagining the footsteps on the staircase, but they grew louder, closer, unmistakable, the light steps of a small person, and Harry sat up, panicked. He'd wanted someone to come, but not this, not a student, not while his magic was thrashing around like a bomb about to go off.
And ah, yes, there, the pain was being washed from his body, his muscles unclenching, his blood unboiling. He was panting, still, the aftermath of pain, but little by little his breathing slowed and the sweat cooled on his body. What had happened? It couldn't be the potion, could it? No, the potion was amazing, the potion was everything he needed, it had been an anomaly, it had been a fluke -- right?
Harry’s patience was wearing thin. He wanted to find Draco and he wanted to sit down, in that order. “Maybe we should just start shouting so they show themselves.”
"I didn't know you were a real person," said Timmy defensively. "I mean, I knew, but -- but I didn't
“I’m sorry,” Harry felt he had to say. “It was the sodding Floo system, they worked out that we’re the only ones who have private Floos, and… and you know, kids, they jump to conclusions, and…” He stopped talking, because Draco had gone very pink, and pink was a distractingly fetching color on him.
"Tired," he said honestly. And in pain.
A woman emerged from the forest of wood, extremely tall and broad-shouldered with thick dark hair down to her waist, pale skin, and a pair of enormous, exquisite hazel eyes. She was wearing lots and lots of silver jewelry placed pretty much anywhere a person could put jewelry, and when she spoke again, Harry realized she was American.
“Children are much more imaginative these days,” said Draco darkly.
Both Harry and Neville conceded that this was a good point. The three of them were in Malfoy's office on the Friday night following Hogsmeade, drinking what was apparently a very expensive and high-quality bottle of Cabernet, though to Harry it just tasted like red wine. Malfoy had his feet on the desk and his hair was uncharacteristically mussed, a sight that made Harry feel oddly dizzy. It made him want to call him Draco out loud, just to see how it felt, and he doubled-down on his mental commitment to sticking with
"Yeah, they sell you at Weasley's!"
“Fuck,” he said to the empty bar. Then he turned to the three Stunned, unconscious wizards and, just to be on the safe side, Petrified them as well so they wouldn’t be able to move when they came to.
Harry took off his glasses with a shaking hand and rubbed his eyes. "Pain."
“Draco,” Neville said. “I think that little owl’s got something for you.”
"What about your old school enemies?" Malfoy said.
But he couldn’t say any of that to Roberts.
Draco looked at him sideways. “Right now?”
It was so good to see Draco that Harry had managed to forget how very not-good everything else felt, and he tried again to sit upright but stopped, grunting a little in pain. He fell back against the cushions, fighting a wave of panic.
"Yeah." Harry propped himself up on his good elbow. "I gathered." He sat up all the way.
"What? No!" He thought of that crackle of panic, and winced. "At least, not intentionally."
“I am,” said Malfoy.
He hadn't taken dinner in the Great Hall since the first week, too tired and achy by the end of the day to want to be around people. But he felt not bad at the moment, actually, potion still going strong, so why not?
Harry, who'd been sitting behind the desk, got to his feet, trying not to give away how agitated he felt.
The class let out a collective, "Oooh!"
“Where are you going?” Jacob said. “Are you just taking a lovely walk on a beautiful evening?”
Malfoy nodded. He didn't look proud or smug. He looked... sad. "Come on," he said. "You usually lean on the banister, yes? Do it even if you don't feel you need to."
“What’ll it be?” he said, putting down the glass and towel.
Merlin, he was sorry she was seeing him like this. What a bloody nightmare. Would he be sacked for traumatizing students?
Overall, however, his students seemed glad to have him back. The only real hiccup was during his fifth period, right after he'd taken his customary slow lope around the room, enjoying the new flexibility in his leg. He sat back behind his desk, still lecturing on defensive wand-motions, and then --
"Look," Neville nudged him. "It's Malfoy."
Absolute silence had fallen over the students, and Harry immediately took the exit offered, giving them a wave and moving to follow Malfoy towards the faculty table. Another wave of giggling broke out in their wake and he heard Jacob sigh, "Absolutely fucking
"Right, well, kids do, you know."
Now, he sat on that windowseat, halfway up, halfway down, unable to move in either direction. Every time he tried to get back up, his body protested so convincingly that he stopped. He could feel the black bile of the curse in his joints, seeping through his knee like viscous liquid and twisting up his thigh, settling in his hip and sending dark tendrils to coil in his shoulder and swollen fingers, a feeling like fire, if fire could hold a hammer and bang.
Harry had already been dreading what he had to ask next, and this comment didn’t help matters. “I’m going to need help up to the road,” he said stiffly, eyeing the grassy embankment. “It’s too slippery for me to manage on my own. Do you mind? I’m sorry.”
“Oh,” Harry said, disappointed. Maybe he’d go take that hot bath after all. “You expect he’ll be back by dinner?”
“Here, hang onto me,” Neville said, taking the cane off him so he could grab Neville’s arm with his good hand.
“Tie him up!” someone shrieked, and Harry, clinging to consciousness by the skin of his teeth, was dragged into a sitting position, where he felt his wrists being bound behind him, then his ankles tied together. He tried to struggle, but every movement brought a fresh wave of agony and a bigger threat of passing out, so eventually he went limp.
Malfoy did not look happy about this answer. In fact, he was taking far less pleasure in Harry's misery than Harry would have expected. He took a vial out of his robe and showed it to Harry. The contents were purple and sparkling and Harry caught a faint whiff of blueberry pie.
“I’m not,” said Harry, though to his surprise he found that the idea didn’t bother him nearly as much as it had two years ago. He’d gotten used to being watched. “Er, about that pain potion…?”
Once more, he tried to stand. Once more, he could not. Distantly he heard the clatter of people moving through hallways, students chattering, someone shouting. Another period had started. Second? Third? Fourth? Harry had lost all time. He made another effort at movement and bit his lip so hard blood began to run down his chin. He mopped it with his sleeve, staring at the wet stain on the black fabric.
"A real change, then, from your usual breakneck pace."
“Aah,” Harry said, one truncated syllable of pain escaping before he managed to bite it back. “Not – aah – not that arm, please.”
Harry had forgotten what he'd said. His leg was aching, his shoulder hurt, he was hungry. "No, what?"
"Sod his health," said Ron. "I want the gossip. What's it like working with Malfoy? Do the students loathe him? Have they made up any nasty rhymes about him?"
"Well... it wasn't."
Panic bubbled up in his throat. The smell hit him like a curse -- damp cement, must, mildew, and for a moment he was flung back in time nearly two years, to another basement in another seemingly-normal home. He could feel the damp, dirty floor against his bare skin again, his arms and legs chained to the ground, alone except the leering faces that loomed above him every few hours and brought with them unimaginable pain. First his hand, the curse wrapping around his fingers, his palm, his wrist as he screamed; then his shoulder, his hip, his knee, as if his joints were being chewed up by a mouth of fire, teeth of acid, before they were spat back out -- dissolved, destroyed, aflame. The sound of laughter, the smell of rot.
, it sounds like a fascinating project, never done anything like it before!" She beamed at Harry and led them to small room at the back of the shop, which had a kettle, coffeemaker, a sink, and more wooden furniture. "Sit, sit," she said, flapping her hands. Harry did not need to be told twice. He sank into the couch, which was heavenly, and she handed him a hot cup of coffee. Draco stayed standing, leaning a hip against one of the tables.
Harry felt the classroom tense collectively, a few students exchanging aghast glances with one another, a few grinning at the cheek, and he struggled in the silence for something to say, too startled for a quick answer. He knew the incident had been in all the papers, but he hadn't realized his students might be familiar with it. He didn't like thinking of them reading about it, how he'd been drugged, tied down, tortured, his wand taken, his body broken. Felt a bit out-of-bounds for a student-teacher relationship.
“Well, twelve,” said Negasi, motioning with his hand. “Aside from us three. But – twelve is still –”
McGonagall stopped in a quiet corner of the sixth floor and took out a key ring much bigger than was demanded by the two tiny brass keys hanging from it, and handed it ceremoniously to Harry.
Distantly, he’d known this for a while, but had avoided looking directly at it for many reasons -- most of which had much to do with the fact that this was Draco bloody Malfoy -- but also, Harry was coming to realize that he did not know how to have a crush as this new version of himself. He didn’t even know how to assess Malfoy’s interest, much less act on it. In his dating life he had relied heavily on the kinds of physical flirtation that led to one thing, and one thing only, and in point of fact he had absolutely no idea how to do that thing anymore. He trusted that he could learn, of course – could learn to navigate the limitations of his body in bed, just as he was learning to navigate them out of it – and thank god his mouth still worked just fine – but learning required a lot of patience from the partner upon whom one learned. Harry couldn’t expect anyone to stick around while he tried to figure out if he was good for anything but lying flat on his back, unmoving, wincing every now and then.
One minute. A minute and a half. A minute forty five.
He understood a moment later -- and understood, too, why he'd never seen Malfoy in a t-shirt.
“I think your cane makes you look very smart,” Neville said.
. I came after you because – well, because – because –”
His third visitor of note was Malfoy, who swept in with a scowl and immediately launched into a long, very academic-sounding speech about Hellsbane and Daddy Longlegs venom and time-release and Merlin knew what else, until finally Harry had to stop him and say, "Malfoy, I don't understand a bloody word you're saying."
He had been touched so much lately, yet somehow felt more physically lonely than he’d ever done in his life. It made no sense.
"Malfoy," Harry said, as cooly as a person barely keeping their balance could.
His first class of the day was Hufflepuff and Gryffindor first years, which seemed like a good, non-intimidating place to start, and considering his own first-year Defense professor had been possessed by Voldemort, he felt confident he'd be better than that, at least. He'd had a pain potion with breakfast and was much more mobile than the previous night, but he'd still misjudged the distance from the Great Hall and arrived a few minutes late to find a class of huge-eyed, silent students waiting behind their desks.
“Could be. Haven’t seen another soul, but I’ve only just come through.” Negasi held up his wand. “Corpus Localis, you think?”
“Yeah,” Harry managed. Go on, you great coward, say something. “We should – we should do it again.”
"That would be good. Did you say you studied wandmaking?"
Disappointed, Harry made his way back through the damp, lush air of the greenhouse and out into the darkening evening. A fall chill had entered the wind, and everything smelled of fallen leaves and cooling earth. He wasn't ready yet to go back to his stuffy room, so he took a detour past Hagrid's old cottage, feeling such a swell of nostalgia that he nearly broke into song. He needed to remember to owl Hagrid, soon -- it had been a while since they'd last exchanged letters. The sky was charcoal grey with a limn of pink light by the time he was trudging back into the castle, and his potion was beginning to wear off. Still, he felt reluctant to return upstairs.
“Absolutely not, are you –”
He should've let Snape teach him something, those years ago. He'd always thought potions were time-consuming, finicky bits of magic, slow and subtle where Harry preferred fast and effective -- but he'd never expected to rely so heavily on that slow subtlety.
He could see from Neville’s anxious face that he wasn’t putting on the best show, but sod it, he was so tired of performing day in and day out. Let Neville worry for an evening; it wouldn’t kill him.
about it. We used to talk about it just to horrify ourselves, it was a lark, you know. But these kids seem… quite invested.”
“I love my brother too much to subject him to that,” said Betsy. She turned her beautiful eyes full on Harry, then, and said, “It’s lovely to see you again. How’s your wand?”
Other than those few hills and valleys, classes were going well, Harry thought. He might not quite know how to educate children, but he had to admit he knew the material inside and out, and watching them master spells was unexpectedly gratifying. The first time someone banished a Boggart he nearly cried with joy and pride.
"Well, go on and sit in my desk chair, I reckon I can handle a bit of discomfort better than you."
“I don’t like this,” he said again.
“Lead the way,” Harry said, and began moving through the halls of his old life.
"I didn't know what had happened!" Malfoy said. "I thought you'd passed out, or been hit with a curse, or had a bloody cardiac arrest, you just said my name and boom, you went down like a sack of bricks. I grabbed you and starting yelling my head off for help, and then --" Suddenly, unimaginably, Malfoy was giggling. "And then you started -- oh, Merlin -- you started
“You think there’s other people here?”
Neville's room was indistinguishable from the Hogwarts greenhouse. They closed the door again.
“I’m fine,” Draco said. “As predicted. Not even a concussion to show for my day of adventure.” He looked at Kevari. “Do you need to take him into St. Mungo’s?”
“They must be bored,” Draco said. “Are we not working them hard enough?”
"You know who this is?" Ron said, gesturing. "It's Harry sodding Potter; you won't give Harry Potter your chair, after what he's sacrificed for us?"
"That's what they asked me," Harry said. "Malfoy?"
Maybe it was only morbid curiosity about his scars, maybe it was just the natural urge to compare one body to another, but Harry could have sworn that something in Malfoy's gaze, something about the way it lingered on his shoulders and dipped to his stomach was... appreciative. And that shouldn't make Harry feel so damn pleased, but it did.
“How on earth did you sprain your knee in a bank?” she said, leading him into the kitchen.
"Admit it," Malfoy said. "You would've loved to've gone up against that Lethifold."
“You don’t need quite such a white-knuckled grip, Potter, or your hand’ll get sore.”
"And this ugly, messy black wig," said a very freckled boy. "Your real hair is much nicer, Professor."
"I'd sack me."
“Say goodbye to your melodramatic Uncle Harry, who'll see you again before you’ve learned to shit somewhere other than your own trousers,” Ron told his daughter. She let out another hoarse cackle, her one tooth glinting. She'd be a terror when she got older, Harry thought happily.
“No,” Harry said, thinking of being recognized by Betsy for his wand, then by the barkeep for his Patronus. “Not at first, anyway. People haven’t been. They get distracted by other things. A limp is quite a good disguise, turns out.”
"She's a kid," Harry said hotly, "she had nothing to do with it."
“Oh, now you have to tell it.”
Harry very much doubted that, given what he knew of Malfoy, but he said, "All right."
Another hour, or two, or ten minutes later, he'd managed to hoist himself up onto the windowseat. He'd also attempted to stand, managed it by the skin of his teeth, and nearly fallen down another flight of stairs the moment he tried to take a step.
“I haven’t seen you at any of our meetings,” Abigail said.
"A railing wouldn't go amiss here," Harry said, leaning heavily on Neville's sturdy arm.
"It's a delicate subject," Malfoy said. "And --" He looked suddenly deeply uncomfortable. "All right. I think you should know, yes, that Chloé Barnes is the daughter of Gibson Ackley. Her mother changed their name for -- well, for obvious reasons."
“What’ll we do with this lot?” Negasi asked.
“We’ve got to be getting back to the castle,” Harry said. “Sorry I didn’t tell you I was here, Ron. We just popped down to get the cane, and –”
Just a short one! It's schooltime now and oy, what a time suck, but the next chapter will be much longer. And happier haha.
Harry, speaking thickly around his own pride, said, "That would... make my life considerably easier."
"Honestly, one minute of napping's a fair trade for the rest," Harry said.
"It eradicates pain completely, and I do mean completely, for about thirty minutes. Sufferers of chronic pain tend to like it quite a lot, but I advise you not to enjoy the experience any more than necessary, because if you take more than one dose between two full moons, you'll drop dead pretty much instantly. Understand?"
"For reasons of accessibility, we will be adding public-use Floo to the Great Hall and to certain classrooms, and warded Floo to any private offices and chambers who request it."
Neville put on a record of a Muggle band from the 70s with a soulful female vocalist and Malfoy found a deck of cards. They bet drinks instead of galleons, and rather quickly, Harry was rather drunk. Twice in a week! Someone, hold him back! After several hands of cards, Malfoy and Neville transitioned to the billiards table and Harry sat back in an armchair, drinking another Malfoy original cocktail and planning to watch them play.
"Oh, you're impossible. You think not being able to open a potion bottle really matters to --"
He heard Malfoy stand, but he didn't speak, just gave Harry a few minutes' space to get himself under control, a few minutes just to sit there and feel blessed nothing. Tears kept leaking stubbornly out, but eventually they subsided, and Harry's ragged breath calmed, and Malfoy said, "Twenty-four minutes. Let's try and get you up."
“I expect he will not,” said McGonagall. “He went down to the village to take a Floo on the way there, but Finicky Rattler venom’s too finicky to travel by fireplace, so he’s coming back on his broom. Brighton’s at least a four hour flight, even with these good tailwinds, so in all likelihood he won’t be back until late.”
“What do you mean?”
“It isn’t visible scratches I’m talking about,” Harry said, searching his face.
Harry stretched out his leg and resettled his bad arm in his lap, trying not to look directly at the deviously cute Cute Snailwort. “All right,” he said, “tell me why Malfoy quit Healing.”
"Train toge -- of course not, we were on rival teams!"
He moved towards the door as quietly as he could, which wasn’t very, and then blasted it open, keeping his wand up as he cautiously advanced. He did not know what to expect – but he knew he was
Harry felt a great rush of rage and envy and sadness pouring up from his chest and belly and lodging in his throat like a stone. He looked away from the faraway Seeker -- it was too much like looking into the sun, beautiful and blinding. The walk was taking its toll on him and he was getting tired, the worst of his pain kept at bay by Malfoy's potion but only just, and he could feel his limp growing heavier with each step, as if the sight of the Seeker had robbed him of precious stamina.
This was met with giggles and the subject was dropped.
"All right," Harry relented. "If you don't mind just helping me up some stairs? I'm sorry about this, I mistimed my pain potion, stupid mistake. I promise you won't have to be looking after me all the time."
Fuck these people. Fuck Negasi, fuck Nimpkins, fuck everybody except Draco, who Harry would never even have a fucking chance to fuck for real because they were both going to die here, beaten by Squibs because Harry’s fucking body couldn’t handle its shit.
Negasi hurried to seal the doors and came back as Harry was lifting the Petrification charm on the barkeep – or rather, partially lifting it, leaving only his head free. Immediately the man began thrashing it around so forcefully Harry worried he’d get whiplash, all the while shouting curses at the pair of them.
Harry immediate added getting Draco plastered to his bucket list.
The day was hot, the air still, the lake serene. Harry felt himself getting drowsy and he dropped his quill so he could pick up his wand, guiding the earth beneath him to lower him down into a more supine position. Perfect white fluffy clouds drifted sheeplike across the sky. He felt sleepy and comfortable and just this side of too-hot in jeans and a button-up shirt, and he'd taken off his shoes to feel the soft grass beneath his feet. He'd just nodded off when he heard someone humming.
"I suppose you could say that," Neville said.
He put on his very best harmless Muggle face again and felt a flicker of hope when the man squinted at him, eyes sweeping from the cane to his pink jacket to his wet hair.
"Another Weasley," Malfoy said in tones of faint horror.
The class erupted into laughter, and Harry grinned. Was it possible he wouldn't be a total wash at this?
He kept his eyes forward as he made his way across the Great Hall to the Floo in the far corner, trying to project an air of unsociability so none of his students would accost him, and he felt a surge of relief when he got to the fireplace without being forced into a single conversation. The green flames flared up and he stepped in, preparing to state his destination.
Malfoy spoke from his seat, where he was draped casually, comfortably, quill behind an ear, the picture of professorial elegance.
"I hope so. I've done this before but -- not in a place as big as this. Just at home, at Ron and Hermione's and the like. We both know what happened last time I tried it here." He took a few awkward, halting steps to the table, and shrugged. "It'll do. Thanks very much. Budge over Neville, would you? And please don't ask me if I'm all right. I promise, you'll know when I'm not. Pass the sausages."
The curse thudded in Harry's joints. He was in so much fucking pain, was so fucking tired, he had no energy for Malfoy's taunts and insults, no energy even to muster a reply that wouldn't humiliate himself further. He nodded.
"I was waiting for y'all out front but I got bored and went in back to make some coffee. You want?"
“Ah. Of course.” He let go of the material but kept his fingertips on Harry’s arm, his touch light.
“I couldn’t,” Harry said, wondering what on earth he was getting himself into.
A sliver of ice lodged itself in Harry’s chest. “Please don’t call me that.”
In his third year class, a very loud boy named Callum said, "Professor, I'm Muggle-born, and I came out with one leg shorter than the other."
On a good day this would have been nothing, it would’ve been easy, but today was not a good day.
"Bravo, Professor!" roared the same boy in the back, and Harry decided to get very, very drunk that night.
?" Then she whirled back to Harry. "Are you Harry fucking Potter?"
“Trans? Yes.”
"Harry," said George. "Do professors not take their shoes off to sleep, these days?"
That was the first thing Harry noticed when he opened his eyes: pink ceiling.
me. Draco --?”
Betsy’s eyes dilated huge and pleased. “Stop! It’s just a little trick from my old wandmaking days, you guys are embarrassing me, please, Draco, look somewhere else.”
“Yes.”
"You're... welcome?"
“I’m not waiting an hour and half,” Harry said. “Malfoy could be – it could be too late by then. It might be too late now.”
“Well,” Harry said slowly. “Then I guess I’ll have to storm in, won’t I?”
"Yeah, good to sh--see you."
Malfoy huffed and turned away, and Harry hesitated. Was he really about to go swimming, for fun, with a Death Eater? But Malfoy wasn't a Death Eater anymore, was he? He'd just said he wanted to get rid of the mark -- but he
"Oh -- well, all right. Erm --
“I’ll be seeing you soon enough, if you don’t take my advice and get some rest,” the Healer scolded. “Draco, you’ll look out for him, won’t you?”
“Neville,” he called. “Could you give me a hand? Literally. Here, hold that quill up, right there. Yes, keep it very still, thanks. Don’t make any noises or sudden movements for a moment, all right?”
“Your head,” Harry said worriedly, eyes going to the blood in Draco’s hair, “are you –”
Merlin, but life was strange. Never in a thousand years could his school-age self have imagined that one day he’d be clinging to Draco fucking Malfoy and loving it.
Ye gods, apologies for the wait! I live in the US and I have done pretty much nothing for the past month except refresh the internet trying to make it promise me that Trump wouldn't win again, and GUESS WHAT! HE LOST! OH HAPPY DAY!!! What a fucking RELIEF y'all. Back to the things that really matter in life, like FAN FICTION.
Harry croaked, "Great," and it was a testament to the depth of Neville's friendship that he didn't call him on the lie. "Any progress on the -- the theft?"
Phil slumped unconscious, and Harry rolled off him just as the bartender vaulted over the bar. “Stupefy!” Harry said again, and the barkeep froze mid-leap and collapsed – right on Harry’s bad leg. His vision went grey for a second, then re-racked. “Levicorpus,” he gritted out, and as soon as the bartender’s heavy body had lifted, he dragged himself out from under and let the man fall again. Craig, lying beneath the fallen lamp, seemed very much down for the count, but just in case, Harry aimed his wand and stupefied him as well. He didn’t trust a lamp to do a wand’s job.
“Well.” Draco winced. “Merlin, this is embarrassing. Well, my first year at Hogwarts, I was – having rather a rough time – adjusting. I didn’t have friends, and the school was bringing back unpleasant memories. Plus, as you know, it was just a deadly amount of work that I wasn’t entirely prepared for. I was… depressed, I guess you could say.”
Hermione eyed him, clearly trying to suss out whether he was in earnest.
"Your ego's big enough, Potter," Malfoy continued. "So don't let this go to your head. But I'd always thought of myself as cowardly -- and was always told I was cowardly -- because I'd never been able to bring myself to kill anyone outright. I always thought I wasn't brave enough to kill. The Room of Requirement, when you saved me even though you nearly died doing it -- it got me thinking that maybe I'd been wrong, about bravery. That maybe killing is in fact more cowardly, and mercy's the hard bit."
"Yes," Harry said with some distaste.
"Not at my absolute best, for some reason. Bloody starving, though. Slept through breakfast."
“Right, that.” Draco nearly smiled. “I was… there were times I was frightened. But I kept calm, for the most part, because I hoped – not just hoped, but really believed – that you’d come for me. Not because you’re Harry Potter, but because you’re you.” He cleared his throat. “So what I meant to say, what I
Harry grit his teeth and began carefully pulling the jacket up over his bad arm, wincing a little as his shoulder and back protested the movement. Ron seemed occupied with Rosie so Harry let himself stop halfway through and pull in a short breath before continuing, but Ron jerked his head up just as he did so and narrowed his eyes.
"That's a long story," said Malfoy. "But to make it short, I was offered this position, and I accepted. Here." He put out his hand and Harry gripped it, staggering upright. "Will you be okay to get around?"
“I’m a poor stranded motorist,” Harry said. “My car’s broken down just over that hill.”
“Thanks,” he said faintly. “Sorry, I – bit tired, I –”
"Tour?" Harry said, palming the wall for balance as he started to limp after her. "I have been here once or twice, you know."
"How's the leg?"
“What is that spell?” Neville whispered.
"Let me walk you back to your room," Neville said, his face anxious, and Harry knew he was thinking of his promise to Hermione.
"And everyone who suffered from his bigotry? Have they managed to put it behind them? Have Luna and Hermione forgotten being tortured in his house, do you think? Is Dobby going to pop back to life because Malfoy's suddenly feeling a bit sorry?"
Harry flushed, thinking of Jacob’s comments about his eyes. “No, actually. I wear it because Hermione’s always told me to, and I trust her more on these matters than myself -- but give me a cool, arctic blue any day.” Like Draco’s own eyes. “Like the lake right before it starts to freeze.”
“Harry,” Neville said, at the end of that week. “Have you and Draco had a row?”
“Hi all,” he said, forcing a smile as he lowered himself painstakingly down behind his desk. “Cold, isn’t it?”
Malfoy furrowed his brow. "It's not comfortable?"
Neville shook his head, looking affronted.
“I didn’t know that was still happening to him,” Neville said unhappily. “Poor bloke. D’you really think you can figure out who’s been sending them?”
Harry let the Healer manhandle his shoulder into place, breathing shallowly while Kevari explained what he was doing and why, and though he tried to pay attention, he really did, the pain was distracting. And so was the thought of Draco’s lips on his, Draco’s hand in his hair, the breadth of his shoulders looming over Harry’s body…
He and Ron did an awkward shuffle to exchange a one-armed hug, one of Ron’s arms busy holding a child and one of Harry’s arms busy being useless. Harry kissed the baby on her red-curled head and said morosely, "Goodbye, Rosie. Next time I see you, you’ll be enormous and I’ll have missed your whole precious childhood.”
“No alterations needed,” he said, coming back up around the aisle towards them. “It’s perfect, in this regard.”
“You don’t mind me kicking him out, do you?” said Kevari, settling himself in Draco’s vacated chair. “I seem to recall you’re not the biggest fan of… observers.”
were the one looking, you would’ve found us before – before – you would’ve found us in time.”
Neville was standing now, too, face serious. “Shall I come with you, Harry?”
Harry did know, it was why he was wearing it, but he couldn’t very well say that. “Thank you for telling me.”
The classroom began to feel a bit warmer, however, and Harry got on with the lesson well enough. He wasn’t up for a lecture so he broke the students into groups and gave them a jinx worksheet with enough problems that they’d keep themselves more or less occupied with little to no input from him, and so the first period went by without much trouble.
1) In order to make his own potions, he'd have to break into Malfoy's office, steal the supplies, then go into the Potions room in the dead of night and brew them as quickly as he could.
Soon, much sooner than he'd expected considering how far Herbology was, he heard footsteps thudding quickly up the staircase -- not quite hurrying but not taking their time either. He knew immediately, with a deep sinking instinct, that it was not Neville. Neville's footsteps were intimately familiar to him, they were part of the soundtrack of his formative years, he'd know them anywhere, and this was not them.
grounds could you arrest –" but then he stopped, because Roberts was doubling over in laughter.
It was deeply uncharitable of Harry to think of any student as a twit, but he thought it anyway. "Yes," he said as patiently as he could, "and hopefully that's what we'll learn in this class. Moving on, please, and let's remember what I said about personal questions."
Craig, who was also alarmingly broad though much less tall, shuffled up and took the photo, squinting at it with a pair of callow little eyes. Finally he said, “Yup.”
"It's not a point, it's just an idea. But you could commission someone to put your wand inside a cane."
"I'm not," Harry said, feeling absolutely crestfallen for reasons he didn’t want to examine too closely. "I'm in student meetings about the next exam."
“Who’s this?” someone said, and Harry looked up into the broad face of Gregory Goyle.
“Is orange your favorite color?” he asked.
“I’ll need a chaperone getting back to Hogwarts.”
"Moody had that wooden leg," Neville said.
“It’s fine,” Harry said, though his shoulder was pulsing agony through his neck. He put his bad hand safely away into his pocket where no one would be tempted to yank on it and offered Negasi the other arm, cane dangling from his hand.
Her lips trembled. She said, "It's okay. He shouldn't have done what he did."
“Don’t speak ill of the dead,” Neville said, as Harry had known he would. “Nor of yourself. You’re none of those things.” Harry grinned and Neville said, “Well, you’re not half-barmy, anyway. You’re sure you don’t want me to come with you?”
"Making me a cane," he said. "Put my -- my wand in it."
"Harry, I should've --"
Harry's knee was acting up again -- it was the third time that week he'd been forced to Lock it, but he refused to let it worry him. It was only the change of season, he told himself. He wasn't backsliding. He'd be staying the night at Ron and Hermione's tiny cottage, which demanded absolutely none of the running-about he'd been doing for the past months, and after a weekend's rest his knee was sure to improve.
"Hmm?" Harry said, idly attempting to saw a piece of rather tough steak with the edge of his fork. It had turned out to be quite difficult to eat foods that needed cutting if you only had working hand.
On Monday of that week, Harry received an owl from Betsy informing him that his new cane was ready. It also informed him that she'd eaten cake for breakfast, that she was thinking of making a violin that played bird songs, and that she'd recently read an excellent Muggle novel about a Black woman who'd traveled back in time and been forced to reckon with both the legacy of American slavery and her white slave-owning ancestors, and did Harry think it was possible the author had gotten her hands on a time-turner?
"I suppose you've only just met," he said. "Oh, does that make this your very first class at Hogwarts, ever? I'm honored."
The round-faced old man gave a cheeky little nod, black eyes twinkling as he came into the room. “And you, Healer Malfoy.”
“Erm, Maria, could I ask you to take this clipping back to the castle?” Neville said, neatly shooing her away.
“Better?” said the two Kevaris.
“Not if I grab you first,” Draco murmured, and Harry, even though he’d started it, flushed scarlet.
“Well, hang tight, I can fetch you one. We’ve an outlet on the porch.”
On the other side stood a bearded blond man with an affable face and a benign, curious expression. “Hello there,” he said.
Harry could not help himself. He started laughing, too.
So it was third period. He'd been here nearly three hours.
The windowseat was in sight, but Harry had no time to stop. He leaned heavily on the banister and picked up his pace, swinging his immobilized knee from a hip that was decidedly not made for swinging, eyes forward -- and even later he couldn't have said how it happened.
“Pain potions are hardly healing,” Harry said, sidestepping the question. The answer was no: he had absolutely no plans to limp pathetically into Malfoy’s office and whinge about how much it hurt. He was, at least according to tabloids, the most powerful wizard of his generation. Surely he could manage a few simple pain potions to keep himself going.
The scars from the curses were terrible, thick and ropy and shiny, and they still moved sometimes like snakes winding under his skin. His kneecap was obscured by scar tissue, his hip no better, though his shoulder and the joints of his fingers weren't as bad. They blended with the other, minor scars he'd picked up over the years -- little starbursts from hexes, jagged blast-marks from jinxes, slash-marks and burns and whatever else.
"Why'd you leave off Healing?" Harry said. "You seem to be quite good at it, actually."
"Yes?" Harry said, and she skittered back. He might have spoken too sharply -- he was trying in vain to get his bad hand to grip tightly enough to help him open a bottle of ink, and was forced to think balefully of Malfoy's comment about potion bottles.
It didn't help that his left hand wasn't good for much other than holding down herbs as he chopped them. It also didn't help that he was making the potion to replace the pain potion he'd run out of, so after two hours of intensive brewing he was damp with sweat and wavering on his feet.
“Get out,” Harry said to Negasi. “If someone’s going to find us they should only find one of us, go outside and wait for the aurors.”
“You’re right,” Draco said stiffly. “It was unprofessional of me to try and check on a colleague I hardly know.”
"Your Uncle Harry's going a bit mental, locked up in that castle," Harry said to Rosie. She cackled and then lurched backwards with more strength than seemed possible in that slight body, and he tightened his grip with his good arm, bad arm draped across her lap. The hard thing about holding a baby with one working hand was that it didn't leave any room for a wand, and he had a surge of fear imagining what would happen if someone attacked at just that moment. He wouldn't be able to defend Rosie without dropping her, which would defeat the point, and what was Ron thinking, leaving her with Harry? He was in no shape to watch out for a child. He felt a brief crackling panic that seemed to flow through him like hot wind... but then he caught sight of Ron coming back and felt first better, and then silly for his interlude of paranoia.
He knew it would be Hanna even before she raised her hand. "Some curses are cast to be unHealable, like, on purpose. It's illegal and it's mad difficult to get right, but some people do it anyway."
one’s romantic status ever even occurred to me.”
Harry stopped. "No. Is that true?"
Harry ignored him, fumbling to get his jacket closed. He really had to find a zip-up spell. “Could I have a look at your network map so I can figure out where I’m headed?”
“Merlin!” said Neville.
Harry started to nod, then stopped, pain shooting through his shoulder and neck. “No better time for it.”
They did fall a lot, but they also laughed themselves silly, and it cheered Harry up greatly. He didn't even mind when Jacob asked, "Professor, Abigail said she saw Professor Malfoy locking your knee for you, is that true or is she telling tales?"
“Draco,” Kevari said, “Healer Seidman will tend to you in the kitchen, if you don’t mind giving me a moment with Harry, here.”
Little gasps all around the table. Harry's blood went cold and he willed his face not to change. Aiming for pure nonchalance, he flicked his wand to pour himself a glass of water.
“Well, you both seem to be feeling all right.”
"Nimbus has a new line of comfort brooms," Professor Soobs said in her monotonous voice. "Cushioning charms, stay-put charms, support charms."
Harry’s heart was suddenly pounding and his head swam with something that felt like the exact opposite of pain.
“Paranoid, that man,” said the woman, shaking her head. She gave Harry a sudden, warm smile. “Sorry, we haven’t even introduced ourselves. I’m Lizzie, of course; Evie’s mother. And you are – wait, no, don’t tell me. Are you Glen?”
Draco pulled away, cheeks pink. There was a smear of blood down his chin from where his cut lip had opened up, and it was a testament to how far gone Harry was that he found even this immeasurably sexy. He licked his own lips to try and get a taste.
"There's downsides to having a parent like that," Hermione said. "None of his siblings can so much as make themselves a sandwich."
Malfoy seemed encouraged by his silence and said, "If it interests you, you could make an appointment with Betsy in Hogsmeade this weekend. I just thought, since we'll be going anyway..."
Hope this was worth the wait at least a little bit... enjoy...
Malfoy was quiet. Then he said, "There's quite a lot to mock you for, Potter. But being hurt... No Healer would ever mock a person for an injury or illness."
supposed to pretend?
“I didn’t even do that much,” Harry protested. “Just some walking around. And – well, a bit of fighting, but hardly any!”
“Just in case,” he told Ron, “could I ask you to Floo the Aurors and pass along a message?”
"I'm not sure, myself," Harry said, totally bewildered.
Somebody kicked his bad hip. “Who the fuck told you we’d be here?” a gruff male voice demanded, but Harry couldn’t speak. He was panting, trying with every gasp to cling to consciousness. He could see Malfoy through the filmy haze of his vision, struggling wildly against the chains, all pretense at docility abandoned, and where the fuck was Negasi? Where was Nimpkins? Where were the Aurors? Here he was, in agony in another fucking basement, waiting for help that wouldn’t arrive, only this time it was worse because Draco was here too, and Harry hadn’t saved him. He could see his face, bloodied and bruised but still so handsome, his mouth forming Harry’s name as someone kicked him in the hip again, and even beneath the pain Harry felt his rage growing.
As the students were leaving, Harry said, "Hanna, a word?" and when she came to his desk he said, "You seem sensible. Will you explain to me what is going on? The giggling, the screaming, the questions about the Floo... Am I out of my mind to feel they're related?"
Harry laughed, delighted at the thought of the two of them corresponding in any manner, but his laughter died when Negasi appeared in the living room doorway. It wasn’t the sight of Negasi that dampened his spirits; it was the person flanking him. A tall, well-built older man with a clean-shaven face and grey hair pulled back in a ponytail.
"No!" he said. "No, never. You can be sad about whatever makes you sad."
“I’ve been keeping track of the Zabini boy,” said Abigail. “He’s a traitor just like Malfoy.”
"They've got this
"It's 4am!" he said, shocked.
“Wait,” Harry said. A cold finger of fear ran across the back of his neck. “His source is in Brighton?”
"A boggart's a shapeshifter that takes the shape of the viewer's worst fear," said Maggie promptly. "It can be defeated by laughter."
As if on cue, Harry’s traitorous knee gave out. But it was only briefly, and Harry caught himself on his cane, giving himself a moment to test the joint before putting the barest amount of weight back on it. He wanted to Lock it, and would have, except Kevari had just warned him off the practice and he was still back there, watching everything, an infuriatingly skeptical expression on his little old face. Roberts, thank Merlin, didn’t seem to have noticed.
Malfoy was sitting behind his desk, bent over a stack of parchment, quill in hand, looking like the professor Harry knew he himself would never be. He glanced up when Harry came in, and his only concession to surprise was one long, slow blink.
"Well, tough," Harry said. "Life is disappointing."
"No shite!" someone shouted from the Gryffindor table, and waves of nervous laughter broke out.
"Hello," he said. His voice echoed in the quiet. "I'm -- I'm Professor Harry Potter --"
They had another round of drinks and played another game, Harry and Neville again against Malfoy, and again they were soundly trounced.
"It doesn't matter, it's just -- it's really good of you to even think about it."
"To new times?" Harry suggested.
They stared at each other for a minute and Harry registered the red towel.
"Excellent, ten points each to Gryffindor and Slytherin. Today, in honor of my own horrible mood, I'm going to teach you three spells, all related: the Limb-Locker, which is what I've got going, the Leg-Locker, and the Jelly-knees. They're all technically curses, but as you can see, even curses have their use outside of fighting. Can I get a few volunteers to help put down mats? I have a feeling you'll be falling a lot."
"A hundred forty two --
Harry himself knew no such thing. Hermione put her arms around his neck, and Harry was gratified to see that she did so less carefully than she might have even a few months ago, and he returned her embrace as she kissed his cheek.
"You're all right, come on, let's just get you up this last step. I can take more weight that that, Potter, go on. Good. Can you stand on your own? Do you need my arm?"
Unfortunately, everyone had questions about his well-publicized stay in the hospital wing.
Sorry again for the long delay! And for anyone worried that I'll abandon this story, I will not, I absolutely promise to finish it, just so you know. Only a couple chapters left now, I think...
The new cane made getting around so much easier that Harry regretted every single day he’d gone without it. He had not, however, anticipated the enormous fuss that using the cane would engender.
"My dad's an Auror," Hanna said, turning to Harry, "Negasi Seid, he was on your team, Professor."
"My students tell me you're giving out House points with absolutely no regard for tradition," said Malfoy. "I suppose the rules still don't apply to the famous Harry Potter, do they?"
... But some of them figured out that only you and Professor Malfoy have private Floos -- all the rest are public."
“Yes,” Harry said, airless with want. “Very.”
Hurt, unmistakable, flickered across Draco’s face, and Harry felt a surge of impotent regret. That wasn’t what he really meant at all. What he meant was: I’m not your patient, I’m your friend. Or: I’m not your patient, I’m a grown man who
“Oh no, you’re right on time,” she said. She extended a hand. “Abigail Selwyn.”
A second later, he nearly laughed. He recognized that style of lock -- he had one just like it in his own office. They were everywhere, generic charmed locks that were universally accessible by faculty and universally closed to students.
Malfoy had a tired, inward expression on his face, but when he looked up and saw Harry staring at him, the pointy weasel made a reappearance in the slight disdainful curl of Malfoy's lip, and Harry was glad to remind himself that just because someone had turned out unfairly gorgeous, it didn't mean they weren't still an absolute prick.
Shit. Harry'd likely earned some innocent kid a year's worth of detention. What if it was a Quidditch player? What if Gryffindor lost the cup because of him? Merlin, what had he gotten himself into? He had to confess.
“And for the record, I’m
Harry laughed weakly. "Let's not bother the Minister for Magic about food poisoning."
"I know," said Harry. "That's why I come."
Harry was so deep in the couch that it was difficult to drag himself up against the arm, but he managed it, and Ron set the plate down on his lap. Then he tapped it with his wand and muttered, "Defindo mordere," and the sausages and pancakes cut themselves neatly into many, many, many teeny-tiny pieces.
Harry nodded, and left.
"I asked if you were listening," McGonagall said, pucker-mouthed. "I see that you weren't."
The sofa, which Harry now saw was not the green velvet one he'd come to know, sprang open like a book and the cushions rearranged themselves into pillows, blankets settling atop the mattress, from couch to bed in an instant. It was a beautiful piece of furniture, all gleaming bright wood and soft blue cushions. Harry tottered over, unLocked his knee, and fell backwards into it.
It would all be worth it – anything would be worth it – if he could find Draco and bring him home.
He already had a lead, thanks to Negasi, and planned to send an Auror or two to the Goyle's house, while he, Harry, tried to retrace Malfoy's steps in Brighton.
"Counterclockwise," he muttered. "One, two, three -- oh, why are you blue? Please, please be yellow instead."
Now Malfoy registered an emotion Harry recognized: surprise. "Have a seat."
Negasi was eyeing him critically. “Plus,” he said, “you look a right Muggle in that jacket.”
"Hi Professor Malfoy!" squeaked another girl.
“Shush. It was nice seeing you, Draco. Bye, Harry, love you.”
aratri!" Harry waved his wand so the ground swelled upwards into a chair and he was sitting more or less upright, and then, with another flick, the chair tipped forward to help him stand.
