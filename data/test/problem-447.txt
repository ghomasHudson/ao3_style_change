“Hmm,” Michael Corner says, now grinning even wider. “Let me think real hard on that one. Have I ever
Malfoy’s tilting his face down; their noses are almost touching. Harry looks at Malfoy’s half-closed grey eyes, at his pale eyelashes and his flushed cheeks, and he can’t breathe.
“Pansy,” Harry says impulsively, not particularly pleased with the direction of his thoughts, “how do you expect me to bring Malfoy back to our time? I mean… he’s not just going to grab my hand and go.”
Harry deserves every single ounce of love every person on the face of the earth has the capacity to give.
Harry standing in the middle of the room they share, his wet hair sticking up everywhere, in boxers and a T-shirt, saying
“Malfoy,” he says eventually, “You’re not going to crash my broom. You’re—oh fucking hell—you’re a good flyer but I’m never going to say it again in my life. And it’s almost four AM. So…”
So Draco hands it over—success! Distraction successful!—and beats a hasty retreat. “I’m going to shower,” he says.
They’re just about at the dock where Hagrid takes the kids from the Hogwarts Express to the castle, and from here, to Harry’s tired eyes, the gently rippling surface of the lake looks miles long.
“Well... what I said before,” he says, after a very long pause. “My godfather, he once said that the world was not divided up into good people and Death Eaters. And I think that’s true. There are bad people who aren’t Death Eaters, and… there are good people who are. There are good people who changed sides and left Voldemort. But there were also good people who didn’t, because—well, you know, for whatever reason. Maybe their lives were threatened. Maybe their families’ lives were threatened. They were forced into it. That doesn’t make them bad people.”
“Sure, I do. I mean, I risked my life fighting…” Michael Corner’s eyes flick to Draco’s wrist. “I mean. Nevermind. Yeah, I think I do.”
Malfoy’s bedroom is very orderly, his books and papers stacked neatly and his quills beside them in this little case, exactly parallel to the edge of this stack. His bed is made and his pillow doesn’t even have the indent of his head, like he fluffed it before he left.
The door opens and closes, and then, even though the door to the shower is steamed up too much for Draco to see, Draco knows Harry’s standing in the bathroom—especially when all the warm steam rushes out of the bathroom, clearing the air by at least 50%.
“Don’t come any closer, you’re all sweaty,” Draco orders, putting out a hand to stop Harry from taking any more steps closer—he won’t be able to
The trunk with pictures of him. When Pansy said Harry had “emotional sway.” When Harry grabbed Pansy’s hand and Pansy said Malfoy would kill her. When Pansy promised him Malfoy wasn’t going to hex him.
“The kids have been asking you who…?” Draco trails off. Harry doesn’t like talking about his soulmate—or rather, his lack of one. His perceived lack of one. He likes to talk about Draco’s soulmate, because Draco
Harry turns. His expression is so hurt, so pained, it stamps any last pieces of Draco’s heart to dust. “Didn’t want me, yeah—
Pansy is quiet for so long that Harry thinks she might not have heard. Except she must have heard. The night is dead silent, and she’s shooting glances his way.
Draco has learned Harry inside and out and back and front. He knows, the way he knows that the sun will rise in the morning, that there is a
“Sorry to disturb your studying,” Harry says, coming to stand behind Draco so they’re both looking in the mirror. He’s smiling apologetically, carefully not touching any part of Draco’s skin or clothing, his eyes affectionate—the kind of affectionate he reserves for Ron and Hermione. Draco’s heart tumbles in his chest, head over heels, head over heels, head over heels. Despite the space, it still feels like Harry’s too close.
It’s worth it for the feeling of Harry’s soft, warm mouth on his, it’s worth it for the feeling of Harry’s firm, careful hand at his jaw, it’s worth it for the feeling of Harry’s fingers combing through Draco’s hair, it’s worth it for the sheer, simple knowledge that this is
close, his mouth will be so, so close. If he looks up, he’ll be able to see the smudges on Harry’s glasses, the curve of his eyelashes. “You should give up and actually
Pansy hesitates, chewing a lip. If Harry remembers correctly, she’s usually wearing brilliantly red lipstick, which would explain why she looks different right now.
He abandons the textbook. When has he ever managed to read anything when Harry Potter was existing in the same space? Never. He pushes the textbook aside, and now Draco’s facing Harry straight on, Harry sitting on the floor and Draco lying on his stomach on his bed. Harry’s not the least bit sweaty, and his expression is breathtakingly earnest and open.
As far as Harry Potter knows, he’s special because he’s the only person in history to not die after getting hit by the killing curse. Twice. Draco got
He’s pretending like he doesn’t hurt, and Merlin, that makes it even worse—he smiles and shrugs it off and teases Draco, and sometimes he’s really good at it, throwing Draco off track, so much so that it’s not until Draco’s alone in his bed that he realizes they never actually finished their soulmates conversation. For two people who hate talking about soulmates, they talk about soulmates kind of a lot. It’s a subject they circle back to over and over and over, as if drawn in by some magnetic force.
Harry puts on a bright, fake smile when he teaches, but when he returns to their rooms, his shoulders slump and his smile falls off his face as if it’s made of lead. “Stop it,” he tells Draco. “It just makes them more curious.”
“Sorry,” Harry mutters, his face burning, trying to extract himself. But Malfoy kind of doesn’t let him go.
” Harry hisses. “We need to find him immediately. We should go in and see if he’s in his bedroom…” he runs a hand through his hair. He’s going to go insane in this tiny, dark, cluttered room before he even finds Draco. Malfoy. “But what if we open that door and it’s
He draws in a breath. He can do this. He’s done bigger things than go back and get one guy he didn’t particularly like from the past. Even if that guy turned out to be kind of fit when they returned for Eighth Year, and recently that’s been making it a little hard for Harry to look at him. Even if sometimes he sees Malfoy and kind of loses his train of thought for a minute.
"Oh, Harry no, that's not true! Everyone loves you, and no one could bear losing you, losing another person. After all that we've been through we now deserve to live freely and truly."
“I get it, Hermione, believe me, I do. But I still don’t know for sure if his redemption act is enough for us to forgive everything that he has done to us through the years. Just let me think about it some more time and sleep it over, and tomorrow I’ll tell you what I think.”
"Good night," Haley waved, getting up and trying to escape without having anyone question her leaving. It wasn't too difficult. Everyone was busy celebrating.
"It's not what it sounds like! We weren't – we weren't doing anything!" She tried to reason with the angry man but his accusing eyes were burning with a fury that seemed unquenchable.
"Why not?" He asks petulantly, his fingers crawling across the blanket toward me. Why does he even want to touch my stupid wings? It's not like they are made of silk or anything. His eyes are full of curiosity as they flick all over my extra limbs. If he wants to so bad… Suddenly I'm struck with an amazing idea.
"It might neutralize the effects of the fairy dust." At least it probably wouldn't make it worse. Fortunately, the fairy hadn't floated anywhere close to
"Hi sis." Simon said hesitantly, as he waited by the foot of the stairs. A tray with tea and far too much cake was in his hands.
How cool is it, that I managed to finish this in time for Christmas? I planned this of course... (not). So, now Sirius knows. What do you think is going to happen now? Will he tell anyone? Will he accept it? Will he march to Malfoy Manor and kill Draco? I guess you'll find out in the next chapter xD
The article was located somewhere in the middle of the magazine, between hair styling tips and rules about what not to do on the first date. It was a tiny article that hardly justified an announcement on the front page. Draco glanced around left and right, making sure there was no student lurking behind one of the numerous bookshelves. He didn't want anyone to catch him reading
"He's gone!" She exclaimed with wide eyes. She hadn't just made him up, had she? No, Ron had seen him as well.
He scoffed, leaning back against one of the walls and crossing his arms. "Of course this is about your precious
"I just don't understand how you can be this caring and nice to me and at the same time you don't give a shit about what I feel! You keep humiliating and hurting me like it's nothing to you! Like I'm some stupid little doll you can treat however you like! You're the worst!" I spit, breathing heavily. The fury just gets more intense the more I say. But it feels good. It feels so good to finally be able to tell him what I think of him. To tell him how much of a
Instead, she looked away. "Don't look at me then." She whispered, leaving him to look at the back of her head.
Malfoy looks around frantically. It almost appears as if he was searching for something. Then I notice it. His wand is no where to be seen.
"No. It's obvious you do." It almost sounded as if he was smiling. She glanced up at him curiously to check. He was smiling. But it seemed a little bit sad.
"Don't touch him," Haley protested quietly. But Ron heard her. And her words seemed to shock him so much that he stopped fighting against Hermione's hold.
The girl watched him thoughtfully for a moment. "No… I don't think that's what I'm saying." She replied.
"He kept asking, too. So, I said yes. If only to stop him from bothering me." She seemed to be lost in a memory again. A memory Hermione couldn't see. "He surprised me in the end. In a positive way. In many ways actually." There was something gentle and soft about her face.
"Well, we went to the Three Broomsticks instead and we didn't talk much more for the rest of the day. I've never felt like such a fool."
"Is... what... true?" I question nervously. He takes a step toward me, so he's standing right in front of me.
"It's something I've never told anyone before." He sounds almost proud. "And now, I believe you owe me a kiss."
Only I don’t fall to the ground. I open my eyes that I had closed reflexively and find myself lying on soft mossy grass. Right. Still dreaming. The bar is gone and instead there are trees all around. The sun is setting and the first stars are starting to light up the sky. I find Draco lying next to me, not bothered at all by the sudden change of scenery.
For a moment, she allowed herself to really look at the sleeping boy. He looked so innocent that you might think he had never done a bad deed in his life. Well… Haley knew better. She could do anything she wanted to him now. Get revenge for all the times he had treated her badly. Nothing was there to stop her. Nothing except the tiny fact that Malfoy clearly trusted her not to harm him. Otherwise he wouldn't have been able to just fall asleep like that. No matter how tired he was. But maybe this was only a test. Maybe he wanted to know what she would do with such an opportunity. But that was stupid. It didn't make sense. Hadn't he said earlier that he had barely slept the night before? Or had that been a lie? Well, it couldn't hurt to let him sleep for a bit. Maybe she could try and sort out her feelings in the mean time.
bad. And lately, he had left her alone completely. But she was on a roll. And it irritated her that her
"You were about to argue. I was preventing you from doing that." He said nonchalantly, not sounding the least bit apologetic.
"You weren't doing anything?" He asked dangerously. "Well, then enlighten me what it is that you were doing at night up at the Astronomy tower
It was only the second week at Hogwarts and Haley already wanted to leave again. No less than five minutes earlier, she had exited Umbridge's office and she wasn't eager to know just how late it was. Fortunately it was already Thursday which meant there was only one more day of detention left. The bad news was that she was going to miss the quidditch try outs that were scheduled to take place the following day. But what was she supposed to do about that?
Slowly, as not to surprise her, Draco approached her. At least, the oncoming darkness made it harder for people to spot them.
"Yeah, let's do it that way," he agreed with a grin. He turned toward the Great Hall, but hesitated to actually take a step toward it. "But… are you sure you're not hungry?"
"I thought this might be easier," I mumble, still imitating Myron's deep husky voice. I clear my throat again, before continuing in my natural voice. "I thought you had something to say?"
"Goodnight, Malfoy," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. She let go of his hand. Then she turned around and made her way toward the Oak Doors.
She had knocked over the jar of pumpkin juice with her arm! Now the orange juice was flowing all over the table and into her lap.
"Is that you, Dray?" Oh, he knew that voice. "What happened to you? I've been waiting for hours!" He doubted Pansy had waited for
"I don't care," Haley said, stroking across his skin with her thumb tenderly. "And you're not useless."
"It didn't sound like nothing," he argued, "To me it sounded like you were implying I was too stupid to–"
"Yes. I won't take long, though. Just give me a minute," she answered. Her friend didn't really care whether he showered right away or later in their tower or sometimes even at all. But Haley liked feeling clean and fresh after a training session.
He vanished through the barrier, followed by his parents and Haley tried not to watch him go. She sighed. Simon patted her shoulder in support. Why was he that tall? The top of his head already reached her chin!
"Uh – it's just," Haley started, rubbing a hand over her face, "Ever since I started detention with Umbridge – or no wait – since the second day of detention it felt like someone was watching me.
The boy still said nothing, he only stared at the mittens like the sight of them saddened him for some reason.
My first impulse is to pull my hand away and contradict him or better yet laugh at him. But there's something warm in his touch and his grey eyes that makes me reconsider.
"There should be something in the cupboard beside you," he pointed toward the cupboard she had noticed earlier. He watched her expectantly.
"Oh. It's you." She whispered then, her voice not betraying any emotion. She looked to the lake again and then toward the castle behind him.
For a moment it seemed like she was going to either argue some more or burst into tears. In the end she did neither.
Somebody touched her hair that was a huge unruly pile on top of her head. (She hadn't had much time to properly take care of her appearance this morning.) Was she dreaming again?
So after the disastrous encounter on the Hogwarts Express, he'd taken to avoiding the girl. With an actual Ministry represent at Hogwarts it wouldn't be too long until word got around to the ministry or his father. Draco didn't want to imagine what his father would say, if he found out, he was being friendly toward Haley Potter. So, there really had been no other choice but to avoid her. Although it went a long way from what he really wanted to do, whenever he saw her. Back on the train he'd only meant to give her a little hint, for her to stay away and show her that whatever had happened between them last year was in the past. (He tried not to acknowledge the fact that it definitely wasn't in the past for
." It was impossible not to hear the sarcasm in that last part. At least the mood seemed lighter now. Playful almost.
"Bandy brought your spicy noodles as usual, Miss Haley." One of the elves said, placing a huge bowl of steaming noodles in front of her. Malfoy raised an eyebrow.
"Oh. Right." The boy smiled at her shyly. "Sorry." He shuffled his feet on the ground sheepishly. Had he always been this cute?
She pulled away, sinking back to the soles of her feet again. A fiery blush was colouring her cheeks red, making her look even lovelier than before. She bit her lips nervously, her eyes fixed on his shoulder. "Good night, Draco," she whispered, her gaze flicking up to his for a split second. Then she removed her hand from his face, picked up her broomstick and the Invisibility Cloak and fled into the darkness of the hall.
“Hi, guys, sorry to interrupt this “oh so funny” moment, but could you tell what is happening, and why are you laughing, we still don’t know where the rooms are…” – said Dean. Harry and Hermione both sobered after that and told their schoolmates why they were laughing.
As she was leaving the Eighth Year Dorms, she bumped into someone, who was entering, and her first thought was “
They spent the following week like this, in the company of one another, and sometimes with the visit of some other friend. Most nights Hermione stayed. Nightmares didn’t come as much with her by his side, and if they came she was there to hold him, just like he was there for her. At the end of his second week after the day the war ended, Madam Pomfrey let him leave home, and as promised, Hermione came with him.
“That’s it, Hermione, there you are. Are you feeling better?” – asked Blaise once he realised that Hermione was once again breathing properly and was concentrating on what was around her.
Deep down Harry knew that what Hermione was saying was true. After all, the same had happened with Dudley. He had always treated him badly because it was how his parents treated Harry. If his parents could treat Harry badly, then so could he. However, in the end, he had seen that all his life he had treated Harry with no respect, without any reason, and he had tried to mend his errors.
“Yes, but he is also the one who refused to acknowledge Harry back in the Manor, Ron! You know that had it not been for him, we would not have been able to survive that day! And then what? Voldemort would’ve won.”
of September, their routine was about to change drastically. Here they were again, about to board the Hogwarts Express for their last time to go back to the place where it all had happened. The place where they had all met, where they grew up and have the time of their lives, but also the place where they fought for their lives and where many had been lost.
The floor was approaching at high speed, when suddenly everything slowed down and he heard in the distance someone shouting -"
The feast was a quiet affair, in which only small talk could be heard. Soon the whole school was leaving for their dorms, and only the eighth years could be seen still seated at their table waiting for Headmistress McGonagall to talk to them.
It was true, Mrs Malfoy had saved his life by lying to Voldemort, but it had all been because of his son, not because she cared about him or his cause. However, he trusted Hermione with his life, and if she said that it was safe, he would believe her. So, taking a deep breath, he opened the letter and he started to read.
“Narcissa Malfoy, you are accused of being an accomplice of Death Eaters, as well as housing You-Know-Who at your Manor. Furthermore, you are being accused of helping your son in planning the death of the late Albus Dumbledore. How do you plead yourself as?”
“If you don't mind, we will be heading home. It is rather late, and we have to go to the trial tomorrow, so we would like to have a little sleep.”
“Merlin Harry, give a woman some warning please, you almost gave me a heart attack! I thought you were sleeping!”
While he was retaking his seat, Andromeda went to the stand, took the oath and started to make her statement. She was defending her sister, and she explained the Wizengamot what it was like to be born into the Black family; after all, she had had the same upbringing. She explained to them about the Cruciatus they had been submitted since she had been three, about how their parents had been as crazy as Bellatrix and had forced them to always do their bidding. She said that she had been lucky, she had been able to escape, and fortunately, her only punishment had been disinherited, though fore a pureblood, that can be worse than death. Mrs Malfoy, however, had not had much luck, and couldn’t escape their parents' grip, therefore being forced to marry Lucius Malfoy. Even though the marriage may had been planned, it was still her family, and Black’s protected her family fiercely, and for that reason, Mrs Malfoy had stood by his husband through the war and had helped her son in everything she could. Finally, Andromeda stated that had she been in her sister’s place, she would have done the same, after all, she had also done everything she could in order to protect her husband and daughter.
He saw that his speech had, at least, served for something, because for the rest of the sorting he saw that every student of every house applauded the new student into Hogwarts, not just into his new house.
“Well said, George. I know more than anyone how hard it can be to abandon your family and, also, what it is like to be brought up in a Dark family. I was seventeen when I decided to marry Ted and leave my family behind. I, just like Draco, had been groomed into being the perfect heir since I was born; it is not an easy feat to leave all that you know behind. When Draco was forced into taking the Dark Mark, he had just celebrated his sixteenth birthday, he was just a young man forced to replace a much older person. That is no easy deed. His father was in prison and they had threatened to kill his mother, he had no other option. No one believes a Slytherin when they say that they want to change, believe me, I know that, everyone just believes that you are lying and are trying to spy, so he had no choice but follow his father’s steps and do the task given to him. It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up for our enemies, Harry and Hermione, and for that reason, I thank you for agreeing to help not only my nephew but also my sister, because even though I might have had a strained relationship with them these past years, I would never wish them imprisonment in Azkaban.”
“And it’s four thirty in the morning.” Harry gently removes Malfoy’s hands from his hips, with no small amount of reluctance, and squeezes them. “You should go put those Time-Turners back in your Harry Potter trunk, and get some sleep. We can figure out what to do with them later.”
He’s not sure how much longer he’ll be able to form words with Harry’s green eyes on him like that, all… all… fuck. Harry looks like he cares for Draco…
The night’s that quiet kind of night, the kind of night where there’s no breeze and it feels like because there’s no breeze and it’s hot, everyone kind of feels like they should be as still as the air. The curtains hang motionless. If there’s any wildlife awake right now, they’re not up and about loud enough for them to hear it through the open window.
a soulmate, and he wants Draco to go find him and fall in love and get married and grow old. Because he wants Draco to be happy, he says, and Draco can tell he means it. There’s no possible way in the entire world that you can be more firmly friendzoned. “They’ve asked a lot?”
Harry rolls his eyes. “Whatever. I like it, okay? I like, I dunno, meeting people. Having fun. I’ve never really… I’ve always…” He makes a frustrated noise, his head emerging from the collar of his T-shirt, his hands gesturing helplessly. “I’ve lived my whole life afraid. You know? I have… I have the
They land hard, tumbling to the ground—in opposite directions, thank god—and Pansy immediately stands up, dusting off the grass that clings to her and pulling up the time-turner again. Harry stashes the Firebolt in a bush and joins her, grabbing her hand tight.
The students seem momentarily placated by this answer, and they settle enough for Draco to continue the part on soulmarks without having to threaten anyone with detention.
Draco looks up as Harry takes his seat next at Draco’s side in the Great Hall for breakfast, his hair even wilder than it normally is—at night, Draco always swears Harry’s hair can’t get any messier, and then in the morning, it’s even more out of control. It curls every which way, and if Draco hadn’t seen Harry run a comb through his hair every morning when they roomed together, he’d be sure Harry had never met a comb in his life.
“You weren’t meant to die,” Draco says. His voice shakes. He doesn’t try to fix it. “Don’t ever fucking say that. You’re not some fucked up mistake of the universe—” He’s leaning so far forward in his chair across from Harry that his plate is about to fall off of his lap. He sets it on the floor and kneels in front of Harry, right in his line of sight. When Draco meets Harry’s gaze, Harry drops his eyes. “You’re
Malfoy will just open his mouth and say something shitty. He’s been saying shitty things to Harry all year, so it’s to be expected—even if maybe a little bit of Harry hoped they’d let this rivalry go after he spoke at Malfoy’s trial and everything—so Harry can count on that.
“You’d think if I fought in the war I would’ve engaged with some Dark Magic, wouldn’t you?” Jacobs’ incredulous expression eases, though, into something more solemn. “I should have, though. I was nineteen, and I… do you want me to say I fought beside Harry Potter? I didn’t.”
“He’s not going to hex you into next Sunday.” Pansy speaks slowly, still watching him, as if she’s talking to an idiot.
Malfoy gives him an incredulous look. “You don’t have any better ideas, though, do you?” he says, rather unkindly.
Harry Potter, who rescued Draco Malfoy from the Fiendfyre after Draco had gone there to attack Harry, after Draco had spent seven years preventing Harry’s happy place from being an actually happy place…
Harry swallows. If you’d told him three hours ago he’d be consoling Malfoy over being a Death Eater, he’d have sent you to St. Mungos, but now he wants nothing more than for Malfoy to stop feeling so damn miserable about himself. What’s there to hate?
No, I haven’t. I haven’t spent that much time with the guy, how should I have been treating him? Scattering rose petals in his wake? Interrogating everyone he meets?”
“Was?” Draco echoes. He’s falling apart under Harry’s gaze, his hands trembling on the desk. So are Harry’s.
soulmate, Professor?” asks a Hufflepuff. In their defense, they seem honestly interested in finding out, genuinely curious, which Draco can’t say about all the kids in his class. Some of the Ravenclaws hear the question and immediately start twittering among themselves.
quietly and pulls him in, closing the door behind them and throwing up Silencing Charms. It’s a much smaller room than Harry has seen here before, one with the sort of disorder he wouldn’t expect to find in the Malfoy Manor. There are lots of papers, photographs sitting on top of boxes, rolled up tapestries, portraits. There aren’t any tables or chairs, and there are only a few sconces, which aren’t lit.
“It’s not a secret,” Malfoy mutters, sniffling a little and wiping at his face as they come up to the shore. “You’re just blind.”
“You let me think it.” Harry gets in Draco’s face, his bag all packed, his voice shaking. “You stood there and you listened to me
“Draco, please—” Pansy lays a hand on Malfoy’s shoulder, which Malfoy shrugs off, albeit not violently. “He’s here to—”
a question. Just with the shouting it kind of sounds like a statement, which makes Harry feel foolish when Malfoy turns to him and just raises his eyebrows.
“Well. You’re not a Death Eater now, and that counts for a lot,” Harry says, and he means it. The pain in Malfoy’s eyes feels like his own chest is being ripped open; he knew Malfoy was sorry, but he didn’t know he was
Harry takes the chance and turns to find Hermione with her wand already out and her hair tied up and Pansy—thankfully—dressed in the normal shirt, tie, and robes, as if it’s the middle of the school day. Only Ron’s still in his pajamas; he sheepishly disappears behind his curtains, and there are some more shoes-shuffling noises.
Parkinson clenches her fists and looks away, which does not at all disguise the way she’s rolling her eyes. “And Salazar’s sake, it isn’t that hard to call me Pansy.”
Draco.” He shoves Draco’s hands off of his face and pushes his curls off of his forehead again, and there it is, Draco’s soulmark. Harry’s scar. “That’s so fucking unfair.”
Harry’s out on the field, playing soccer with his boyfriend, when Draco gets back from the Boyfriend Check.
Draco must look like a maniac to Harry: hair in disarray, hands scrambling to press against Harry’s warm cheeks, still wet, his breath coming in gasps.
over the past couple years, it’s clear it’s never going to become anything more—or perhaps she actually has a bit of her heart left.
And he’s got a roommate who doesn’t mind Harry bringing boys or girls back, so long as they firmly magic up some curtains and cast all the important privacy charms.
“You’re obviously loved. Granger… Weasley… The girl Weasley, their whole family, really… What does it matter if there’s one more person somewhere out there who could love you too?”
Harry’s restless tapping stops. He puts his quill down and—Merlin, dear Merlin—looks up with those electric green eyes of his. Draco can see the familiar shape of Harry’s scar peeking out from under his curls.  “I was… what did you say? Out of my mind in love with you.”
“There are so many other things we could talk about, Draco,” Harry says quietly, almost in a sing-song tone. He doesn’t know what else to say; he’s trapped. Both conversationally and physically. “So many.”
“A scented candle shop.” Harry looks at Draco’s bed in askance, and when Draco nods, he takes a seat beside Draco, their shoulders brushing. Draco was right—he’s barely sweating.
Parting the curtains, Ron looks back at Pansy with a pitying look. “If you think Harry can solve this on his own, you’ve got another thing coming.” He glances to Harry. “No offense, mate.”
growing up, and I almost got killed a dozen times, and then I had to come to terms with the fact that I was going to die in only a couple minutes, only to end up coming back after surviving
“Morning!” Harry says cheerfully, as he always bloody does, serving himself a couple pancakes and double the appropriate amount of syrup for them. “Today’s the day!”
“Maybe it’s because you were fated to get that scar,” Draco says, “So you didn’t need a soulmark because you were going to get one so young, it was basically the same thing.”
Malfoy nods. “I don’t think we’re actually ready to fly anyway,” he says. “And…” he doesn’t seem to have anything else to say. They’re both just stalling.
“You have…” Draco swallows and looks down, watching the tip of his quill make a bigger and bigger ink spot on the paper he’s supposed to be grading. He hasn’t been processing what’s on this student’s page for a while now, but he can’t look at Harry while he speaks. He
When Harry comes back, Draco is studying. Harry is sweaty. His hair sticks up even more, and his breath is heavy and his skin shines. It’s bloody distracting.
Draco wrinkles his nose. He’s heard an excessive amount about “elementary school” from the Muggles here in college, as well as from a few Muggleborn wizards and wizards whose parents decided to send their children to Muggle school before Hogwarts. “Elementary school,” he says, as if it feels bitter in his mouth, “I can’t believe Muggles send
“Anyway, he turned back time, and he’s in the past now, so however that happened, it happened,” Pansy’s saying, as Harry pulls on a shirt and buttons it up. “And I believe you and Granger have experience with time travel.”
The room doesn’t have any windows, so they can’t see daylight rushing through and night swallowing the sky. The lights on the walls occasionally flicker on, and a few portraits shift place. It appears Pansy was right—people go in this room pretty much never.
“Yes Professor Malfoy. Whatever you say, Professor Malfoy.” Harry’s tipped his chair backwards, balancing on its two back legs. None of Draco’s kids are like this, and Harry knows it—he teases Draco all the time about how he terrifies the children half to death.
Butcher looks at once offended and alarmed. “No, of course not! Why would I want to harm Harry Potter? He saved my sister’s life.”
“No. Actually—I was dead jealous when he started dating Ginny Weasley. Would’ve taken her off him if I could, but she had her mind made up. Is that an ill intention?”

“There’s a common myth that soulmates are extra-special if their soulmarks are in the same place. False. There are no credible accounts of this ever happening—they are
He rubs his eyes, trying to play it off as sleepiness, but it probably doesn’t convince Harry; Harry knows Draco, though not a morning person, forces himself up early enough that he’s fully awake and functioning by the time breakfast rolls around. On the occasion that he spends the night with Draco, Draco shakes him awake, per Harry’s request. Harry hates getting up early even more than Draco does, but he seems to find spending the early morning hours with Draco enjoyable, though why Draco can’t fathom.
soulmark, a rounded shape right over his heart, during the Battle of Hogwarts. He had thought he knew what it meant: Harry Potter was dead. He’d been so, so happy to find out he was wrong, he thought he might die of it. Now he can’t take off his shirt around Harry either. But Harry’s
. But from his grumpy tone she figured it might be Hermione. And although, his tone annoyed her, for once she actually agreed with him. What
Snape's plan was completely mad. But then, it had just that sprinkle of brilliance that could make it actually work.
"I know." There was nothing else for her to say. In the end, it was Hermione's decision. It didn't matter if Haley thought her best friends should finally get it together and admit their feelings to each other. All she could do was offer her support. She took her friend's hand and gave it a gentle squeeze. The girl sent her a grateful smile.
The Slytherin rolled his eyes, not even gracing her with an answer. Haley chuckled but sank to the ground, where she sat on her discarded coat and gestured for him to join her. As he sank down beside her, she reached for her bag and fetched a box that was wrapped up in brightly coloured wrapping paper. As she handed the present to the boy next to her, her heart started to beat uncomfortably in her chest. What was making her this nervous all of a sudden?
A quick glance told her that he had indeed been burned by something. His right hand was soaked with a dark liquid and the teacup that Haley hadn't touched was upside down next to it. The Slytherin glared at the cup like it had personally offended him and wiped his hand on the blanket.
"Wake up." A quiet voice called. It was a familiar voice. Her neck hurt. And her legs. And her back. And her arms felt numb like they'd fallen asleep. She grunted. This wasn't the best way to wake up.
"Hello Haley! And Hermione! And Ron!" Luna greeted them cheerfully. Her cheerfulness brightened his own mood almost instantly. Did that have something to do with her veela aura?
He removed her other hand from his shoulder and cradled it in his own hands as well. He didn't look at her. He was too busy watching their hands. But that didn't mean Haley couldn't look at him.
He caught her gaze and waved at her, smiling widely. Haley felt herself blushing. She removed the hair tie from her high ponytail and let her auburn locks flow over her shoulders freely. They were framing her face in a nice, curly way. In her mind she thanked her mum for braiding her hair the night before. It also had the added effect of shielding her face from too observant eyes.
"So, um… are you going to stay at Hogwarts over the holidays?" Draco asked in a casual tone. He hadn't meant to ask that directly but perhaps it was for the best. There was no room for misunderstandings at least.
He chuckles. "Funny. Now you even glare at me like she always does." I cross my arms in front of my chest.
It's strange standing in front of Draco's dream door again. He knows now. Maybe he's even waiting for me behind the door. Or maybe… he's not even asleep yet. What would happen if I tried to enter his dream door while he's actually awake?
"Well. You need to show me – I mean her – that you're being sincere. And that you're not going to do the same things again."
"What the hell?" She mumbled, while he rubbed his cheek against the side of her face. Kind of like one of Simon's kittens. When it wanted to be petted and cuddled. These mood swings really were too confusing.
"So, what's with the broomstick," a familiar voice asked to his left. He turned his head, quickly shoving the balled up letter into his robe pocket. He hadn't even heard anything. Then she suddenly appeared in front of him, as if she had apparated. She had done something to her eyes. Was that make-up? He suppressed a grin.
. If she could avoid violence, she would. Always. The thought made Draco smile softly, despite himself.
For a moment, Haley looked up into the expectant faces of her friends. Would they understand? Or would they judge her? She decided that she didn't want to ruin her good mood just yet. "I'll tell you soon," she replied, turning back to her book.
"Did we really travel in time? I mean, what do they see in Hogwarts now?" She wondered, still looking around curiously.
"Who says, I'm worried?" The last thing I want to do now is ruining this pleasant dream by dragging my mess of a life into it.
"Well, at first I wanted her to inscribe something but… nothing seemed to fit… So I just left it like that." He concluded thoughtfully. "So..." He added, while looking at her with an expectant expression. "Don't you… want to put it on?"
"You came!" Luna greeted them, beaming like she had swallowed the sun itself. "I almost thought you wouldn't make it. But you're all here!"
"Yeah, she told us that you'd started to feel better soon after we left the Hog's Head," Ron informed her, "And then she wanted to show you some special shop about magical creatures but you couldn't find the shop and lost your way. How did you manage to do that?" He laughed. "I mean, Hogsmeade isn't that big, is it?"
Haley chuckled at his antics. "Just eat it," she ordered. He did. But not before sighing heavily. Merlin, he was so dramatic. What did she even like about him?
Then he suddenly looked at her, eyes intense and urgent. "Tell me you didn't do it – It was someone else – Someone else who used your name and–" He broke off, breathing quickly, and shaking his head. "Tell me it wasn't you." He was pleading with her. And Haley was sure, although he knew the truth, he would accept it if she said it hadn't been her. Or he would pretend at least. She hated that she couldn't pretend along with him. It wouldn't be right.
Haley shook her head. "You don't have to. I mean… you could start by stopping to bully me." She added then. He chuckled. It sounded a bit like a sob. "But seriously," she reached up to catch that lone teardrop hanging by the corner of his right eye on her thumb. "I didn't help you so you'd feel indebted to me or anything. And… I mean, I didn't even do much. If you want to thank someone it should be my mum. Or Neville."
As Hermione went through the people that had signed their list on Saturday, Haley noticed Ron staring at her from the side. Huh?
"What the hell?" She exclaimed. "It's not like I'm getting married or anything! And if I was, why would that be any of your business?"
But it was too late. The two boys were already soaring ten feet above the ground, waving cheerfully to the students.
"Someone like you… You're so pathetic," he spits. "You can't even deny it! She doesn't like cowards like you. You're weak and useless and–"
"Tonight doesn't work," she interrupted him impatiently. "I've got… extra lessons. With Snape." She added sheepishly.
With all the will power that's still hiding somewhere in my body I reach for his chest and push hard.
"Um… why don't you…" She mumbled, gesturing toward the bed opposite hers. Her godfather let himself sink onto Ginny's bed, while Haley slowly sat down on her own.
"Draco Malfoy," she whispered. This searching feature was so handy. The boy's little green dot was blinking down in the dungeons. Was that… the Slytherin dorm? But if he was sick… why was he in his dorm instead of the infirmary?
"I'll walk you another time," Draco said sheepishly, when Haley directed him toward the grand staircase leading to the upper floors.
She shoved him away, trying to ignore the burning feeling behind her eyes. “Oh yeah? That’s funny.” Never had anything been less funny. “If you liked the old
Haley nodded. "Yes. You. Isn't that what you wanted? Why you've been pestering me so much? You want to be Seeker." It was a far shot. But she had a hunch it wasn't too far from the truth.
But all of his problems were as ever-present on his mind as the feeling of the little charm in his wand pocket, softly resting next to his wand.
Honestly, he half expected her to push him away. Which she didn't do. But she didn't return the embrace either. For a few moments he held her like this, wanting to comfort her. And to be comforted as well. But something felt strange somehow. What was it?
Shit. Why was she imagining Ron's voice now? The girl pulled away and opened her eyes, slowly turning her head… and looked straight into her best friend's horrified blue eyes.
"Was it a lie," he interrupted, a tinge of urgency colouring his voice. "When you said you missed me? Terribly?"
"But… I mean… it was just a dream, right? It doesn't have to mean anything. It was… nothing but a nightmare."
Then the next words mercilessly destroyed her world. "There's nothing you can do, Haley… nothing… he's gone."
, a treacherous voice whispered in his head. Half a year ago Draco wouldn't have hesitated to answer that question with a haughty
"No, no, no," she muttered, waving her hands in front of her uselessly. "Merlin, what should I…?" She felt so stupid. And terribly helpless. "Open your eyes." She urged.
"I think I do," she agreed, "Kind of." She still thought his whole 'there is no good and evil' speech had been over the top and unnecessarily melodramatic. But it reminded her of something she needed to ask him. She had been wondering about that for some time now.
"What are we trying to find?" Luna asked, flicking through moving pictures of Hogwarts students that looked like they attended school over a century ago.
"I was going to apologize for that. Should I not do that?" His hands weren't touching hers anymore. Instead his arm was wrapped around his middle loosely. Like he needed something to hold on to. Haley felt something inside her soften at the sight. The feeling irritated her. Where had it come from?
"Well… I've certainly seen enough of the Shrieking Shack," Potter answered slowly, "You don't need to worry though, we'll definitely have our meeting on Saturday. But I don't think it's going to take all day."
Haley shook herself out of her paralysis. This was stupid. She was a witch. She had faced Lord Voldemort. She would certainly not think herself into a panic just because of Draco Malfoy.
"I – well, he – ugh," my brother stammers, hiding his face in his hands. That poor child makes a mess of his words on his best days. I wonder where he gets it from.
"Dumbledore will be here soon. Tell him Haley is in danger. She's gone to the Ministry and the Order is on their way."
"Well, I said that they were for someone…" She drew out the last syllable for dramatic effect. "Someone whose hands were always cold." She revealed with a wink.
She was so lovely when she was riled up like this. Full of life and passion. How could he ever abandon her?
With a sigh, he slipped his wand back inside his pocket and let the warmth of the castle comfort him.
"Hello Draco," the girl greeted him without acknowledging the book. Her priorities were really messed up. On the other hand, Draco approved of her insistence on greeting him above all else.
Suddenly, there were fingers on her waist and a second later she was flipped around and felt herself being pressed against the wall. That look. Doubtful. Almost
The redhead turned around, muttering, "I swear, this time he's really gone too far." He started following him but this time it was Haley who was grabbing his arm.
"Revenge! I told you. Quick now, he's coming!" Haley whispered, shooing her friend away so that now she was the only person standing in front of the potions class room. Most of their class mates hadn't arrived yet but from the corridor behind her Haley could hear a group of Slytherins make their way over to them. How did she know they were Slytherins? Well for one, their laughter never sounded particularly friendly. And for another… she had seen them a second ago.
Oh no. This didn't look good at all. The Cruciatus Curse? And Malfoy looked like he was about to do something stupid. Incredibly stupid. There was no time. She had to act now.
The girl furrowed her brows. "I didn't mean to hurt anyone." She sounded defiant. Perhaps she sensed that Hermione wasn't only talking about Ron who felt hurt. She had to bite her lips to stop herself from saying something she might regret later on. Like accusing her friend of being naive or ignorant or telling her she might not have intended it but her actions
"It's a lot to take in!" Draco argued. "I'm sure you wouldn't take it so lightly if someone told you all of a sudden that your only family member was alive, after thinking that he was dead for so long."
"I'd never leave you because of a peculiar voice," Draco whispered, taking her face in his hands and leaning down. "There's much worse than that. A peculiar ear for example." He leaned in closer and pressed his lips to her earlobe. "Or a crooked nose." He nudged her nose with his own, before dropping a kiss onto it. He frowned, rubbing his thumb under her lower lip. "Or a weird froggy mouth." He kissed her lips softly, wondering if he would ever get used to the way his whole body started to tingle and his heart threatened to burst. It was the sweetest pleasure.
He got up and ran his hand through Haley's hair playfully. "You almost had me there." He said with a grin. "You
Mum comes into view a second later. Her hair is up in a bun and there are strands of hair hanging around her face messily. For a second I'm baffled. I know that I'm looking at my mum but she looks so… young. It's almost like looking into a mirror if it weren't for the lack of glasses on her face. And the colour of her eyes. Like hers my eyes are green but where hers seem like light grass in spring, mine are slightly darker, like moss with hints of the brown earth. They are like a combination of dad's and mum's eyes, really. And while my mum is always surrounded by an air of kindness and warmth, people always tell me, I have the same arrogant look about me as my dad.
"It's your name, isn't it?" Luna whispered, like she thought he had forgotten his own name. "You can trust me. I'm good with names." She smiled kindly.
"Er… just be a darling and get me one of those avocado sandwiches?" She fluttered her eyelashes sweetly. "I'll tell you what this is about later." She probably wouldn't but that didn't matter at that moment.
"Later!" She called back, realizing too late that she'd forgotten to pick up her books. Well, Hermione was going to take them back for her for sure.
The urge only became stronger when Draco opened his mouth and seemed to be screaming in silent agony. He was in
. If only a little. Also, he wanted to know if the quill really caused people to burn their fingers if they touched her things. He might find that side effect a tad funny.
"I assure you, I did not 'stumble in'." Professor Snape drawled with barely concealed amusement. "I did come in through the chimney, however."
Fortunately, there was no considerable damage. Only one sheet had a hole, where an owl talon had punctured it. But that could easily be repaired with a spell.
“Look. I don’t want to talk about it now, okay?” She replied, trying to stay calm. “It’s only going to ruin the mood.”
A tiny smile appeared on his lips just for a second. Then he said, "You should put in some effort. I have high expectations."
"Very well." Professor Snape continued. "Sixteen years ago, there was a wizard by the name of Tom Riddle who wanted to become the most powerful wizard in history. He surrounded himself with a mass of followers and made it his mission to eliminate every single witch or wizard that could have become an obstacle in his endeavour. One of those obstacles actually turned out to be one of his own followers."
"Your brothers are so lucky to have you," he says against my hair. "You're even good at making fishtail braids."
My feet lead me toward Malfoy's dream door almost on their own. Why have I come here again? To find out his secret? To find out what he's plotting? To understand him better? To spend time with him?
"I know!" The boy exclaims then, surprising me so much that I almost fall off his bed. "I'm allergic to strawberries," he blurts out like it's something exciting rather than… well kind of sad. Strawberries are so delicious!
“If you say so,” Haley drawled. The kid was still here, watching her curiously. “Didn’t you say something about being late for Potions?”
Could it be that easy? She didn't know why she felt so protective of her mum. Why she found it so difficult to believe someone who treated a fellow student like this could be a good person. But then… Draco knew how to be cruel to other people as well. And still… she'd ended up giving him a chance. Had it been the same for her mum?
Malfoy's eyes were curiously fixed on her hand. Did he want to hold it? He frowned, before turning around and walking ahead.
Lily, who now had four pairs of eyes directed at her, sheepishly rubbed the back of her neck. "Now… that we're all actually here, I feel kind of nervous." She chuckled, turning to Professor Snape. "You're sure, it's done, right?"
come closer," Malfoy orders in a voice that sounds close to panicked. He tightly grips the wand in both his hands. Neville marches on regardless of his words.
With a sigh, he closed his book and slipped it into his bag. "I'm going to finish this later," he muttered, getting up from his chair and moved past her as if he hadn't even noticed her. Without a glance or a word or anything else that might have told her he wanted her to follow him. Haley grabbed the back of the chair in front of her to hold herself upright. All of a sudden, her knees felt weak. And not in a good way. Why was he this cold to her? Did he need more time to cool down? He couldn't have meant what he said, could he? He didn't really want to end it, right? It had been a stupid fight. Surely, they could talk it out? Searching for help, she looked at Luna, who was sending her a sympathetic glance.
"What deal?" Rita asked. "You haven't mentioned a deal yet, Miss Prissy you just told me to turn up."
"Who – who is that?" I ask quietly. I'm pretty sure I know who it's supposed to be but I don't want to assume anything. I want to hear it from Draco – I mean,
"Of course," Hermione replied, her eyes glued to Haley's cup of coffee. "We're always going together, aren't we?" Luckily, Haley knew a handy spell to cover up the shadows beneath her eyes. Otherwise her friends would have already manhandled her to the hospital wing.
"I'm sure, she trusts you, too. And she'll tell you when she's ready." The Ravenclaw said with a kind smile and let go of his hand.
"Wow. On top of a liar you're also a thief." The words hurt. They hurt worse than Haley liked to admit. Was that really… what he thought of her?
"That witch is hardly my favourite teacher." He rolled his eyes, flicking at a stray leave that had sailed down from above.
"A quill," She answered curtly. She had to fight the urge to snatch it out of the boy's hand in annoyance. It was the quill Sirius had given her.
"Of course," Neville replied, getting up from his seat. Before he stepped through the curtain he turned back one last time. "Haley?" He asked hesitantly, like he was about to reveal a secret.
He chuckled. "I can't help but wonder… if there's anything left you don't know about me. Or if I'm only telling you things… that you already know… from my dreams."
Well, look at that. I never would have thought he actually had the guts to apologize. I nod approvingly, while he keeps staring at me.
"What do you want then?" Pansy wanted to know. She still seemed upset. Her eyes fell on his notes. He hid them behind his back.
"Professor, I was wondering if…" The boy trailed off, his eyes slowly wandering from the potion master to Haley. When they rested on Snape's hand, which was still clutching her arm, he took a step into the room, reaching out a hand, before dropping it again. He cleared his throat, looking away.
"You're a bit unfocused," the girl replied kindly. "It helps regaining your ability to concentrate. Most commonly used by people whose mental abilities are limited due to the foolishness that comes along with lovesickness."
"You don't say." Of course he had. It looked so similar to the kitten she'd drawn onto his arm in that dream. Did he remember that?
But that's what I've come up with for a disguise tonight. Just in case. As far as I know, Malfoy doesn't remember his dreams in much detail anyway but you never know.
During lunch, Haley's eyelids kept drooping. No matter how much she fought to keep them open they stayed closed for longer and longer intervals. She hadn't even managed to eat more than one spoonful of her mashed potatoes. It was hopeless. Why should she keep fighting when the pull of sleep was so powerful? Her head fell forward and her spoon clattered to her plate…
"Haley, are you coming?" He asked impatiently. He had already crossed the room and was now waiting by the door. Haley got out of her bed and slipped into her shoes. With every step she took toward him, dread sank deeper into her heart. When she reached the door, Sirius descended the stairs toward the drawing room. She followed him silently, feeling her lower lip start to tremble. What was wrong with her? She entered the drawing room behind her godfather, who closed the door behind her. A couple of feet could be heard stomping down the stairs and for a second Haley thought, they would enter the drawing room as well. But all of them continued on downwards. Probably headed toward the kitchen. How Haley wished she could go down and have breakfast with them as well. She took a deep breath and turned around to face her godfather.
Haley shook her head with a jerk. "Nothing except your incredibly pointy chin." She answered with a grin, tapping against his chin playfully.
Draco pulls his gaze from Harry and charms a piece of chalk to write a bulleted list of the types of soulmates. Merlin, this is going to be a
There’s a wheezing sound, and Harry turns back to the doorway to see Pansy doubled over laughing. “You’re so—” she’s gasping, “You’re so stupid—”
Now it just looks like a huge empty house, and it looks rather worse for wear, as if upkeep has been abruptly abandoned.
to go there: Harry, golden-brown skin and nothing over it, his fingers tracing the soulmark on Draco’s hip, his mouth on the soulmark over Draco’s heart.
“Tell you what,” Harry says, trying his very best to do the right thing, instead of just… running, the way he wanted to. “You can hear me say it again if you come back to the present day with me. And then!” He spreads his hands enticingly. “You get to lord it over me for the rest of your life. Hell, I’ll give it to you in writing.”
Harry shoves him, feeling himself go red. He puts his arm around Malfoy’s waist and steers them back on course towards the Slytherin Common Room. “A
“Draco.” Harry’s voice is achingly soft. It makes Draco feel deliciously, terribly hopeful. “This check is just keeping you out.”
He also doesn’t go once Harry’s gotten on the back and awkwardly wrapped his hands around Malfoy’s waist, trying not to hold tight enough that Malfoy can feel him. Even though obviously when they take off he’ll have to hold Malfoy much tighter—that will be a strange experience.
Malfoy glances at him for a moment, his expression slightly less pained. “That would be a lot nicer to hear if you didn’t sound so bloody surprised.”
to love you—because I was. And I do.” He can feel his tears, running hot down his face. “Believe me,
The air is considerably cooler by the lake than it is near the Malfoy fireplace, helped by a soft breeze coming off of the water. Neither of them have a Lumos, but the half-full moon and the starlight from the unobscured sky is enough to see things by.
about whether he’s looking at Harry. It’s like sitting or standing or lying down: a state of being, a situation, a whole-body act.
tone again. “That’s why he picked this day? That’s why we’re here? Because Draco knows his past self will come, and then… somehow he’ll try to convince himself.”
to be pressed into every inch of Harry’s body, his mind, his soul the way it’s pressed into Draco’s. Something that is part of the world, the way water is essential to life and the sky is blue and the way Harry’s hair looks in the mornings is different every time.
“What—” Harry throws up his hands and almost knocks over a framed portrait of someone who looks like they never learned how to smile. “No, I’m not
from your bedroom.” She heads over to the doorway, pointing to Harry. “I’ll get the letter out of here, and you’ll get Draco, okay? Don’t worry about me.”
But Harry usually comes by, carrying a plate full of his own lunch—and “lunch” is a loose term that, according to Harry, encompasses an unspeakable amount of sweets for a midday meal—and chats with Draco. About lesson plans, about students who are doing very well (or students that aren’t doing so well, but only when Draco has no one in detention to hear), about what sort of quills Draco uses and how is his mother doing and about the scarf Harry saw in the shop that reminded him of Draco and about will Draco come to dinner with him again, it’s been ages since they’ve eaten out together and eating out is no fun alone.
Harry, who literally chose to die for the chance that it would save everyone else? Harry, who buried Dobby with no magic to honor his memory, even in the shitstorm of the Second War? Harry, who fought a battle every single year of his Hogwarts years and managed to come out still in love with life instead of defeated and jaded, who never stopped fighting until stopping fighting was the only way to win—and then
“And if you can’t do this… “ Here she gives Malfoy a very significant look. “There is no hope for you.
” he mutters against Malfoy’s mouth, “I’m trying my best, okay?” He pulls back and looks into Malfoy’s face. He hasn’t realized until now, when he has Malfoy’s face in his hands, that Malfoy has a very evasive gaze. Malfoy has probably not looked at him more than four times this whole time, or at least, not for more than two seconds. “You’re being an arse.”
, Draco almost says, even though that’s the last thing he wants. The thing he wants more than anything,
“Uh…” Malfoy’s voice shakes a little, and he turns to look at Harry out of the corner of his eye, which looks kind of shiny. Maybe it’s the stars, or maybe he’s crying, Harry can’t tell. “I don’t understand how you can think this hard about my feelings and not notice.”
Harry runs a hand halfway through his hair and fists it in his curls, pulling. He doesn’t look like he’s thinking about it; it’s just something his body is doing. It’s the first movement either of them have made in a long, long moment.
If Harry’s honest, he thinks he’s selfish and sometimes cruel and has a quick temper and has hurt a lot of people. But deep down… deep down he does think he’s more good than he is bad.
, August 3rd, 1996, and you’re in October of 1998. You already experienced everything that happens to you today.”
The only other people who know are his parents, but his father is in Azkaban, serving his fifth year of ten, and his mother is thankfully keeping her mouth shut, though Draco can’t fathom why. Perhaps because she thinks it is pointless—however close Draco and Harry have become as
as in the public, and the public does not know. His fingers itch to trace the shape of Harry’s scar under his robes.
How else would Draco keep himself away? How else would he be able to look at Harry and watch him take other boys to bed and not break? This way, he knows he can’t have it,
“If you peeked at my paper half as much as I peek at yours, you’d know.” Harry passes the butter back. “Have you gotten enough practice yet?”
“Smart and clever are the same thing,” Malfoy says, but his blank expression has softened into something else, something that makes Harry's heart skip in his chest. He reaches out and grabs Harry’s hand, and then looks at them as if he was momentarily possessed when he did that, but doesn’t let go.
“Okay,” Harry says. “Okay. Right. Am I supposed to guess, or are you going to tell me for once, or…?” He shifts to peer at Malfoy’s face, but quickly stops when the boat rocks again. They’re pretty close to Hogwarts now, the shape of the castle blotting out the stars. He feels strangely disappointed to be so close—of course he’s tired, but he doesn’t want this night to end. “I feel like there’s this huge secret I’m supposed to know or something.”
Finally, Malfoy sits up just a little and pushes up his sleeve. “Still there,” he says dully, shoving his arm Harry’s way. The Dark Mark is indeed still there, gleaming darkly under the moon, looking admittedly very sinister and dislikable.
Pansy’s expression goes soft for a moment, an expression Harry gets from Hermione sometimes, although he’s never quite sure what about. “No,” she says. She laughs a little, not entirely kindly. “I promise, he has
When Draco finishes drying off and looks at him, drying off his hair vigorously, he almost dies on the spot.
Pansy raises her eyebrows. “A good point.” They all look at her, and she hands the Time-Turner to Hermione, who fiddles with it, muttering to herself. “I was thinking more along the lines of how you got held prisoner there, you know, but I like your reason better.”
The cold feeling in Draco’s gut comes back full force, clawing icily up his spine, closing fingers around Draco’s heart.
“I do too,” Draco says immediately. He can’t help it, he has to say it, he feels full to bursting with the words. “I love you.”
Harry laughs, loud and harsh and humorless, and steps back, heading toward the door with his papers in his bag. “It would’ve hurt less if you’d told me at the beginning you were my soulmate and you didn’t want me than to find out after all these years and
Draco wrinkles his nose. “Soccer doesn’t have the grace necessary to entice me into playing,” he says. “You smell—you smell.”
“Right,” he says, feeling a little more awake, or at least a little more steady. He has an objective, and he has this tug in his heart, this determination to achieve the objective, the kind of drive he feels like he’s been missing since Voldemort died and his reason for existing kind of petered out. “Right,” he says again, and this time he sounds like he means it.
, he wouldn’t feel… like this. But then he’d pity Draco, and he’d feel bad, and their friendship would fracture—it happens to nearly all Dissonant soulmates.
“Were you fucking or playing soccer?” Draco drawls, sitting up from his studying position on his stomach. “You look like you’ve been getting physical.”
, it doesn’t surprise him at all that Parkinson would find a way into the Gryffindor boys’ dorm in Eighth Year.
“Let’s go,” he bursts out, knowing whatever Hermione’s going to say, it isn’t good, and they need to fix this as soon as they can. “Can you get us into his dorm? We’re going to need that extra time turner.”
Harry gently disentangles himself from Malfoy, as much as he doesn’t really want to, and unloops the Time-Turner from his neck, handing it off to Malfoy. “Are you okay?” he asks hesitantly. Malfoy looks dazed and flushed, his eyes wide and his breath short. “Do you think…” He swallows. “Do you think being back in time for so long did… something?”
“You obviously cared about your parents, and what they thought of you so much. I don’t… you know… really have experience with that, but I imagine it would be a little bit like defying everything Ron and Hermione believed in. That’s… I mean, that’s really something, isn’t it? That’s really brave.”
“Everett Butcher?” Blonde and narrow and blue-eyed, someone from the soccer team; he’s got those shoes on with the nubs at the bottom—cleats. Hair up in a bun, nervous.
“Yes.” Draco feels uncomfortably warm and fluttery inside. He brushes past it as best as he can. “What’s wrong?”
He always does with his new boyfriends. Sort of… curious. Trying them on like trying on new shirts. Over the two years, they’ve been attending this college, Harry’s already garnered a reputation as being kind of a player—but the most genuine kind.
Which he can only do if he can stop thinking about Malfoy’s pretty face long enough to save the guy.
that’s it. That’s the spark. That’s the end all be all and Draco knows it, he knows it in his bones.
“Yeah.” Harry’s warm breath ghosts across Draco’s collarbone, sending a shiver down Draco’s spine, and Draco starts… well, he starts wishing he had a pillow in his lap.
Harry’s laugh sounds weird because it’s both muffled by the glass and amplified by the way it bounces off of the tiles in the shower. “How can I appreciate you if I don’t know what you’re asking them? And oh my god, Draco,
you ask my boyfriends? Michael said you asked questions like you didn’t know him at all, even though we all went to Hogwarts together.”
Draco takes his lunch in his classroom, because he always has papers to grade, potions to bottle, cauldrons to clean, kids in detention to watch over, and the like.
By the time they get into Malfoy’s room, Hermione has found her voice. “You’re only supposed to go back five hours, max. Otherwise... it’s dangerous,” she’s saying, as Harry tries to come to terms with the fact that he’s in Malfoy’s bedroom.
“I didn’t mean of course he’s double prepared, I meant, of course, he’s got his hands on two illegal time turners—”
It’s more about making sure Harry’s boyfriend deserves him, but Draco can’t say that. It would sound… it would sound far too sentimental. And really, it’s not as if Draco’s questions actually help determine whether someone deserves Harry.
He’d wait to see if Malfoy’s going to return to his right state of mind and give some proper consent or something, but Malfoy’s life is on the line, and so is the rest of reality as they know it, so he accepts the chain picks up the time-turner, and sends it spinning.
“So you just don’t care about finding him?” Harry asks. He’s tapping his quill incessantly against his paper, just as he always has. Draco hasn’t
“Ooh—yes.” Jacobs turns his neck to the side and taps it, right where his neck meets his shoulder. “Did you see it this morning?”
“Alright,” Ron interrupts, “we get it, we’re the very best of friends. Promise me Malfoy won’t hex the shit out of Harry when you get there?”
Draco would’ve given Harry a respectable meal, but he thought perhaps now was not the time to push his proper-eating agenda on Harry, so Harry’s plate has far too much food, and much of it is sweet. It gets a real smile out of Harry, and Draco thinks he could burst. He could fly. He could kiss Harry right on the mouth.
“You thought we were Dissonant,” Harry says, not looking up from the papers he’s grading on his desk. Draco’s sitting on the other side of his desk, peeking at his paper. Leaning close. Hoping against hope, acting against what he knows he deserves. “You thought I didn’t…”
They’re in a shared office in Hogwarts—after going through teacher training together, per terms of new adopted Muggle practices—Harry and Draco had reluctantly admitted that they were capable of tolerating each others’ presences enough to share a space, since there were a couple new teachers coming on who needed offices. They had been roommates in teacher training for a bit, even. It had made showering, changing, and anything related to it difficult.
Harry across the two inches between their foreheads, like Harry’s surrounded by a forcefield. Even after all this time, Draco can never quite be sure whether the prickling he gets all over his skin whenever Harry gets close, stupidly, tinglingly pleasant, is the effect of Harry’s ridiculously powerful magic or the effect of Draco’s ridiculously powerful feelings.
He is still, in the center of the room, his robe on the chair behind his desk, his fingers still clenched around the fabric of his shirt and the fabric of his trousers, his soulmark still out. He can feel his heartbeat like it’s a living thing trapped inside his chest, trying to break its way out, pounding against the walls as hard as it possibly can.
“Dunno. Not that I remember.” Michael Corner is grinning now. “Are you practicing to be an Auror? I hate to break it to you, but Muggle-Wizard university is not where you want to be, mate.”
he had it figured out, but now Malfoy has, predictably, opened his mouth and said some shitty things to Harry, and it’s like—what? Truly, what is going on? It’s like the kiss didn’t even happen, except Harry’s mouth is still tingling, so there’s that.
Malfoy doesn’t rise to that bait, either. He just gets on the broom and waits for Harry to get on after him, holding the broom like it isn’t his. Which it isn’t, it’s just a strange thing to see, because Malfoy usually acts like
“Is she trying to get us alone or something?” Harry asks Malfoy, rather rhetorically, offering a smile and his broom.
“Someone got carried away,” Pansy snickers, leaning in through the doorway and gesturing to them. “Come on, come on, it’s still three-thirty, and we’ve got to get back to Hogwarts before anyone notices we’re missing. Granger and Weasley can only cover for so long.”
“Mmm.” Harry looks unflustered. “And a dick into an arsehole. Especially if you really need to shut them up.”
“Wait—” Pansy jumps forward and slams top down, pulling the trunk hastily from Hermione’s grip. “I’ll get the time turner out.”
“We need to get to the Manor, so that when we turn back time we end up in the morning of August third, 1996, in the Manor. How are we going to get there?”
“I am, yeah.” Harry looks over at Draco, gaze questioning. “Have you heard of any other magical person born without a soulmark?”
“Right. Appearances. Just… just say…” Harry racks his mind. There was a fire going in Dumbledore’s office quite often, but with McGonagall as headmistress—much less eccentric—he doesn’t expect there will be one going now. It’s hot enough as it is, and McGonogall’s probably
Harry scowls. “How am I supposed to know you’re a good person when the only time you talk to me is to insult me and then carry on with your day? I’d love to get to know you better, but the feeling is clearly not mutual. I thought we could be friends after the trial, or—or—you know,
, Harry finds himself thinking, and he’s just wound his arms around Malfoy’s waist when the door opens.
“So I always thought it was normal, or something close to it. I thought, okay, there are people who are loved and there are people who are not. And I wasn’t.”
“What?” Malfoy looks to Harry, and then to Pansy, who isn’t protesting Harry’s words—probably a novel experience for Malfoy. His eyes have this burning determination in them that Harry finds enchanting at absolutely the wrong time. “No, we leave the letter. Potter… what, are you trying to say you
“These identify your soulmates, most commonly known as someone you’re romantically destined to be with, with who you will live a happily ever after with—but this isn’t always the case. Sometimes soulmates can be platonic. Sometimes they can be platonic one way and romantic another way. Sometimes they can be unrequited altogether. These last two can be the source of great emotional pain and suffering.”
“Wh—” Malfoy turns his head to the side, like a curious puppy, his brow furrowed. He licks his bottom lip. “The—”
And then he catches sight of her expression. She’s already pale-ish in the blue-white light of the Lumos charm she’s got in one hand—the other is still digging its nails into his bicep—but she seems even paler than the Lumos charm warrants. She looks wild-eyed and sleepless.
react; he slumps, as if all of the aristocrat in him has suddenly disappeared. Harry’s not quite sure what to make of
Malfoy shifts beside him, clearing his throat. “We’ll, she’s not here to know, so that would be pointless.” When Harry turns to look at him, he ducks his head a little bit, which makes Harry want to run his fingers through Malfoy’s hair again. “Just saying.”
Draco shakes his head and looks back down at his textbook, which has fallen shut. He swallows hard. “Do you think you’re going to last? You and Corner.”
“Ouch,” says Pansy as Ron leaves, but she seems more friendly with the idea of Hermione joining them. Harry suspects Ron’s insult to him has put her in a slightly better mood.
He’s a little bit relieved and more than a little bit surprised that Malfoy kisses him back, no less eagerly than last time.
“Do you ever think,” Harry says, in this thoughtful, detached tone that makes Draco’s stomach go cold. He doesn’t answer Draco’s question—the answer is obvious. “When I came back the second time, maybe I wasn’t meant to. Maybe I wasn’t meant to match anybody. Because I was supposed to die.”
"Glumbumble," Malfoy scoffed derisively. "Yeah right." He rolled his eyes, sending Neville another venomous glance before strutting back to his fellow Slytherins.
a knight's helmet fell to the ground. In a second she had turned around and marched toward the suit of armour in front of which a helmet was lying.
"I'm beginning to think you only came along because of the food." He pushed the basket toward her anyway.
At her words, Hermione smiled so brilliantly that Haley felt even worse, for causing her to doubt herself in the first place. Hermione squeezed her hand excitedly.
He shook his head. Then he leaned in to kiss her gently. Too gently. She pulled back, looking up at the ceiling that was made of glass. It was already getting dark.
She had never really thought of him as dangerous before. Not with his snarl, not when he had insulted her, not when they had thrown hexes at one another. But this soft and caring side of him, she realised, was the most dangerous of them all. It wasn't an obvious kind of danger. It was the kind of danger that came unnoticed and wormed its way under your skin when you least expected it.
For a second everything seems frozen like in a muggle photograph. I don't know what to feel. Or who I want to win this fight.
"Um… hi…" she said sheepishly, biting her lips. How was he supposed to stay mad at her when everything she did was unbearably endearing? Her gaze met his only for a split second but it was enough to almost drown him in an onslaught of feelings. A strange mix of anger, regret and longing that left him breathless.
Neville looked at his hands that were hidden inside the long sleeves of his robes. He shook his head, as if to clear his mind.
"Hey, what's that note about?" George looked at her hand, where the note was hidden behind her fingers, curiously. Haley took a deep exasperated breath and closed her eyes tightly.
? But where? How?" If Snape saw them, could there be someone else who had seen – wait… that night, there had been a pensieve on the table… memories… Had he seen it in her memories? What had they been doing that night?
on the guitar. The door opens and I have barely enough time to wonder what I'm getting myself into, before I've already slipped through.
What? Had she gone completely insane? Normally Draco would never have listened to such a crazy suggestion but there was something in the girl's eyes that told him, she knew exactly what she was talking about.
Her breathing quickened. She looked to Hermione for help, but said girl watched her curiously as well. She seemed conflicted though.
From inside, the tree house was inviting as ever. The only thing that didn't quite fit into the picture was the broken guitar next to the couch. Someone had tried to fix it with spello-tape.
She briefly considered ignoring it and getting up on her own but in her current state of tiredness the thought alone seemed nearly impossible.
"Brilliant," Malfoy grumbled. There was a pout on his face that made Haley think he had not understood the real meaning behind her words after all. But only a second later, he took one step toward her, leaned into her personal space and softly whispered into her ear, "I'm looking forward to it."
The girl rolls her eyes at me. "Didn't we establish that last time? What are you doing on the floor?" She asks again impatiently. I look down at myself. "I fell." I say in a small voice.
"Fine. No presents then." Haley replied with a grin. "That way I don't have to feel bad for not giving you anything either."
. The note didn't say more than that. But it was enough. Enough to make tingles of excitement run all over her body. Sneaking out proved to be easier than she had anticipated. Hermione had almost fallen asleep over knitting more of her elf hats and Ron had called it a night shortly after. Fred and George had started to test their products on students again and he had been reluctant to be the one to tell them to stop. Which was how Haley found herself slipping through the Fat Lady's portrait with a bag around her shoulder and two cloaks draped around herself. One kept her warm and the other invisible.
Haley was on the other side of the glass, uselessly, hitting it as well. "How?" She asked. "How can I help you?"
"So stubborn," he tsked, "just admit it already." He was on his side next to her now, slightly leaning over her with one hand still holding hers and the other resting next to her face. His face only inches above her own.
"Is it a big problem then?" She asked, before she could stop herself. She blamed her dad for this. And Sirius.
"I think it's in my… ah! Here it is." Neville had fished his wand out of some secret pocket inside his sleeve.
"What are you doing, Potter?" The Slytherin drawled, sounding slightly disconcerted. He bit his teeth together, almost chopping her fingers off.
After that first part Malfoy closes his eyes and starts to really sing. I admit, I didn't think he would actually do it.
, Haley told herself. He never missed a potions lesson. Perhaps… because it was a subject where he didn't need his wand? Or if he needed it for the fire or something, he could easily order his cronies to do it for him. Hadn't they always acted like assistants rather than friends?
"Um… okay. So..." He takes a deep breath and looks at my left shoulder. "I… I've been really mean to you." He starts and I nod, encouraging him to go on. "I c-called you n-names and… r-ruined your potions and… tripped you up and…" He counts all of his little misdeeds up on his small fingers. "I pulled all these pranks on you… I… sent Flitwick a love note and signed it with your name-"
"Yes." Haley said, confidently. "But… you probably shouldn't try today. You'll feel even more tired. Dream walking… it's much more exhausting than normal dreaming." If she was honest, she was relieved about it. She didn't know if she was ready to let him into her dreams. It seemed like such an intimate thing. And wasn't that hypocritical of her?
"Oh." He tried not to show how disappointed he was. "Well, I probably won't be here either," he replied almost petulantly. Was she going to stay with the Weasel? Or was she going to stay somewhere else? He was a tad curious but if she wasn't going to offer up the information herself, he wasn't going to ask. She would probably think he asked to spy on her or something like that.
. "Did you see the freak show just now? Guess the stress finally drove her mad," she cackled. "So, as I said, we should go celebrate by the lake. What do you think?"
"Oh, yes! I mean, well – apart from dad being at the hospital over Christmas… But he's all better now."
Haley interrupted him. On an impulse, she reached for his hand that was on the blanket next to him and gave it a gentle squeeze. "I didn't mean it like that… Let's just… quickly pack everything up and go… okay?"
"You're unbelievable," she said in annoyance, after having finally removed the last petal from her tongue.
"For five years… I have... had this picture of you in my mind... That won't magically change over night," Haley heard herself whisper almost soundlessly.
"I might tell you next time, though," the boy said with a cheeky grin. He probably thought he was exceptionally clever. Trying to make her spend another day with him by triggering her curiosity. He had to try a bit harder to keep a girl interested.
"I know it was you who took my notebook. So, I suggest you give it back," she spat, planting her hand on her hip and narrowing her eyes at him.
“No. I’ve got a better idea.” He ignores my question just like that. I should dump my wine over him as punishment. Or squash the cake in his face. Or better yet, eat the whole cake without him. Just as I reach for the cake he fetches a quill from who knows where and sends me an amused grin.
He wasn't going to take no for an answer. That much was clear. She sighed. "There will be Death Eaters. They're the ones who captured him." Not completely true, but Voldemort usually didn't go far without his cronies. And as much as she cared about Draco, she knew his inner conflict would only be an obstacle to her mission.
He had to admit he had not expected her to give him biscuits. The box was full of them in all shapes and forms. Some with chocolate or icing in different colours. What a surprise.
The guilt crawling into her insides felt like a thousand insect feet running up and down underneath her skin.
Absently, she noticed Luna bending down to pick them up and pulling Ron away mumbling something about getting started on the lemonade.
"As much as I'd love to blame Longbottom for this…" He shook his head. "I know it was my own foolishness. I should never have carelessly tried out a spell I knew positively nothing about."
He looked to the side, sighing frustratedly. "I can walk on my own." His voice sounded small. Embarrassed. But he let her wind his uninjured arm around her shoulders and snake her own around his back in order to support his weight, nevertheless.
"What kind of festival is it?" Fleur asked, her French accent heavy. "We have a lot of summer festivals in France as well. There is
"That'll convince them," Haley replied sarcastically. For a moment she had forgotten she was talking to Draco Malfoy. Of course that was the kind of thing he would tell
feelings were involved, was he? She caught up with him, noting that they were walking in the general direction of the Forbidden Forest.
There was a gentle pressure on her shoulder. A small hand that felt so caring and warm, she wanted to cry.
"What… changed your mind?" She asked. Draco noticed that her cheeks were slightly pink. When had it become so hot around them? He had to take a deep breath. She was definitely driving him crazy. More than just a little bit.
It felt like there was a hot lump in her throat. Blocking her words and making it hard to breathe. No. Her dad wasn't a bully. Her parents had been good. Both of them. It wasn't true. It couldn't be. It wasn't –
Curiously, I follow Draco’s gaze toward my arm, where the kitten has pestered the owl so much that the bird is chasing it all the way to my elbow. It hisses at the owl and raises its claws, trying to shoo it away. Just when the owl threatens to attack the small kitten with its beak, the kangaroo breezes past it, balling its paws to fists intimidatingly. The cartoon owl hoots and flies back toward my hand, where it perches on my finger as if it’s a branch.
"Umm… so, do you know that – that blond Slytherin in our year?" I can't bring myself to actually say his name.
Neville nodded, before stepping into the now empty flames. "13, Peverell Street" He said. Then the fire turned green, he was revolving around himself and was gone only a second later.
She nodded as well. "Okay. I'll let you get to your dorm then." She gazed at him one more time, as if she wanted to memorize his face. "You'll go see Madame Pomfrey if it gets worse, right?"
"Yes." The girl nodded to emphasize her point. "See? Why would he help me if he was plotting against me? And that was even before Voldemort returned."
"No," Haley interrupted, shaking her head urgently, "No, it's a great idea! We can go to practise together and everything." She beamed at her friend, which seemed to encourage him.
She stopped, looking at him with those empty eyes again. She seemed so far away… although she was standing right in front of him.
Harry’s stomach turns. Pansy’s hair-petting is making him feel antsy, so he paces back and forth in front of her. The room really is pretty small. “I
