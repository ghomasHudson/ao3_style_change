As soon as Professor McGonagall turned Dra-Malfoy back into himself, he got up. I saw his face turn a little red and....was that a tear I saw? No couldn't possibly be. He looked right at me and I masked my concern with a smirk and I laughed along with everyone. His eyes flashed hatred and some other emotion I couldn't perceive.
Draco paused and taped the quill to his temple in thought. He looked up and only Millicent, Pansy, and Blaise were left. But Blaise and Millicent weren't focusing on Draco's writing, for they were busy snogging. Draco glanced at Pansy rolled his eyes dramatically and Pansy snorted.
Then I felt a pat on my back and I spun around to see Professor McGonagall. I looked at her, then to Harry, and then I walked back to my spot with Goyle and Crabbe. They both looked confused and Parkinson didn't look very happy either. The doors opened and I heard loud music and cheering from inside. I felt like crying. My eyes were burning with unshed tears and all I could do in that moment was hate. 'I hate this stupid school and this dumb program and bloody Harry Potter.' And I felt a little pain in my heart as I thought of him again. Pansy nudged me with her elbow and I saw her concerned face. I rolled my eyes, "I'm fine, Parkinson." But that wasn't the truth. He rejected me. The amazing boy who defeated the Dark Lord as a baby was not like I've been told.
Someone whisper laughed, "Oh my Merlin, it's a bloody ferret." I shouted out, 'help me please, someone' and everyone started laughing at me. I was shocked. My yells were squeaks. Then Moody gripped his wand and pointed it at me. I felt myself being picked up and down. Over and over. I felt humiliated. 'Please help me.' I cried, but cried harder as I saw Potter laughing. Why does this hurt so much?
"My father and I have a bet, you see. I don't think you're going to last 10 minutes in this tournament. He disagrees," I took that moment to jump down and walk a little closer to him.
'What the hell?' I thought. After a few moments of silence, he spoke up again, "The Yule Ball is coming up. I was really expecting Hemione to want me to go with her." I noticed him roll his eyes at the thought. "Although, I really don't like her like that."
Blaise smirked harder and the rest of the Slytherins looked wary. Draco rolled his eyes, brought sat down at a small apothecary table and angrily started scribbling on the paper.
Pansy's eyes were wide with shock and some other emotion. "W-what?!" She screamed loudly, making all of the great hall go silent. "Pansy please!" I begged, "Stop causing a scene. I told you this in trust." She looked into my eyes, looking for a sign of a joke. When she saw no sign of a joke. Her wide mouth turned into a faint smile.
As soon as I rounded the corner by the Room Of Requirements, I knocked into a very sturdy person. I fell back with an oof and heard someone gasp. I looked up from the ground and saw a very nervous Malfoy.
Everyone started laughing harder as I kept getting lifted up and down. I felt sick. My insides did a flop. "Is-is that a student?!" She gasped in disbelief.
My face felt like it was on fire as he slowly stood up, still cupping his face. "Don't get any closer," I shouted, leaping to my feet and hiding behind the couch.
Millicent's normally quiet voice piped up, "We just think that you've started tolerating him ever since," she whispered the next line, "the ferret incident." Draco's blood started to boil. He saw red and narrowed his eyes so dangerously that they could kill.
Draco glared at Blaise, daring him to say the rest of the sentence. Blaise smirked, "Then we'll know you like him."
"And here I was about to ask you to the Yule Ball," she sobbed into her hands. I sat uncomfortably next to her, and I awkwardly patted her back, not liking the amount of kindness I was showing her in public. A lot of internal conflict boiling into my skin. If I tell her, will she hate me? If I tell her, will she still be my friend? Maybe she'll stop causing a scene...
I've never wanted someone as much as I've wanted you. You and your stupid hair and stupid eyes. You and your perfect body and caring soul. You and just you. And what really blows is that you're straight. I just want you and you hate me.
"Was that a threat?" He yelled while chasing me. I whimpered and ran as fast as I could. But I couldn't help but wonder about Ha-Potter. Why was I turned on by him? Why did I care about what he said? Why was I so hurt by him?
'I could grab it out of his hand and run for my life', Draco thought. Cons? 'He could hex me if I turned my back to him or put me in a body bind. Also, his grip is probably strong.'
'Ron is straight. Ron likes Hermione. I don't like anyone.' I thought and sat down next to Ron, plastering on a fake smile. Hermione sat in the very front of the classroom, patiently waiting for the class to start. Ron started blabbering on about some random spell that he's been trying, but I couldn't focus. I was too busy thinking of TOO much. Draco and I being friends after years of rivalry. Ron acting weirdly sensual around me.
Draco sneered, "Of course. I have since first year." He felt the lie roll off his tongue and he held his breath. Everyone started making eyes at each other and he grew uneasy again. "Why do you ask?"
"Stupid Potter. Always gets what he wants. How did he even manage to get his name in that bloody cup? It makes no sense," I spat out, fury filling my every bone. Pansy opened her mouth to reply, but I cut her off.
Please note that this is a) my first HP fanfic and b) my first shipping fanfic. So please tell me if you have any suggestions. -xoxoMarvelFangirl
As soon as we got to the school, we were taken upstairs and I kept whispering to Crabbe and Goyle all the jokes we should play on the professors and students. We were silently giggling as we reached a little case of stairs and were told to wait there. That was when I spotted him.
Draco took a deep breath and let out a shaky breath. Pansy was watching him intently with confusion in her eyes. Draco continued to finish up the letter.
Malfoy stood in a look of disbelief or mockery, I couldn't quite tell. His eyebrow was raised slightly and the corner of his mouth was turned up a bit. I immediately felt foolish. There was no way Malfoy meant what he just said. I was an idiot. I flushed and mumbled "nevermind" turning to leave.
Ron agreed and shoved another cookie in his mouth. Hermione scoffed in disgust, "Ron. do you EVER stop eating?" He looked at her in confusion. "I'm hungry."
He smiled against my neck and started rocking his hips harder against mine. I tried breaking free again as my body started reacting very slowly.
Either way, my stomach would flutter oddly at the thought of him late at night and I would refuse to go to sleep. My eyes would be colored black from the lack of sleep, so I started taking Madam Pomfrey's homemade sleep remedy. But I'd get weird dreams that would make me think of a certain blond boy disappearing every time I'd look at him, a serpent impaling me through my stomach, and my parents dying in ways I could never imagine. I quickly stopped taking the sleep remedy. Hence why I was up, walking around the castle.
Crabbe scoffed, "It's amazing, you're mental. Episode 4 was the best film! How can you prefer Episode 5?!"
"Wait," a small voice called out behind me. Draco stood, looking unsure about whatever he was about to say. He fidgeted with the hem of his robe and looked at his feet.
He started backing away, the corners of his mouth slightly tugged up a little to form a tiny smile. He looked relaxed and at ease. "Good night, Potter."
...how much I fancy you. I like your stupidly bright green eyes that light up whenever you see Granger or the Weaslette.  I like how they get all intense and dark when you get angry or determined. I like your messy raven hair that I just want to run my fingers through. I like how you're shorter than me and yet you still act all big...if that makes sense.
"Write a love letter to him. If it's truly impossible to write, then we'll believe that you hate him. If it's too easy, well..."
Suddenly, a spike of sadness went up my spine. Draco was paired with Pansy. And I was paired with Hermione. Ron with Blaise and Neville with Millicent. I looked at Hermione and she could tell something's up.
"Harry Potter is a filthy little git who is all my parents talk about. 'Oh, I do hope Hogwarts accepts Harry Potter to the school.' 'That kid would have such good genes.' 'I remember meeting James and Lily, they were both amazing.' Bleh. Blah, bleh.  I bet he's not even that talented. Mum and Dad are probably joking," she growled, flipping her dark hair over her shoulder.
"Remember what we talked about, Draco. The boy will be here this year. Befriend him. Do you understand," he asked slowly and quietly.
I shook my head and called out, "It's Harry!" Draco was turned around and walking away, but he looked over his shoulder and rolled his eyes at me. I chuckled and waited for him to walk away. When he was around the corner, I quickly used a spell to pick up the burnt ash from the letter and transfigured a coin into a jar to put it in. Then I walked away with a quick beating heart. My anxiety rocketing for two reasons. I just shook hands with Malfo-er Draco and I also had the capability to figure out his secret. Because I knew for a fact that the letter did not say what he said it said.
"He's vile and cruel. And you're pathetic," he grumbled and walked away. My eyes were wide with anger for insulting my father and I was hurt by the insult towards me. Why does this hurt so much? I thought confused. I shook it off and replaced my hurt look with my resting bitch face and pulled out my wand, trying to think of a spell that would make him turn back so I could continue insulting him. But then I heard someone yell, "Oh no you don't" and I turned my head to see Professor Moody shout and point his wand at me. I let out a scream and it felt as if my insides exploded. I closed my eyes in agony as I felt myself shrink. When I opened my eyes, I was on the ground. Everyone was huge and their eyes were on me. I looked around and spotted a tail on me, I let out a scream.
"Wha-" I opened my mouth to question. But he placed his right palm over my mouth, making my eyes widen even more and my muffled protests increase. His left hand was right by my head and I was caged in. I searched his eyes and there was a sparkle in them so I eased a little bit. 'It must be a prank. Ron would never do anything stupid.' I thought. His mouth suddenly was by my ear and I felt his hot breath.
I was interrupted by Potter stepping closer to me. "I don't give a damn what your father thinks, Malfoy." He pressed his palm against my chest and shoved. I grunted in shock and frustration. And although I would never admit it, but I was a little turned on. His green eyes were intensely glaring into my eyes, as if he could see right through me. And he was so close I could feel his warm breath on my face.
"This is Crabbe, Goyle. And I'm Malfoy," I took a step closer to him on a higher step. "Draco, Malfoy." I smiled widely at him. Feeling excited that I was finally talking to the boy I've looked up to since I was young.
"You'll soon find out that some wizarding families are better than others, Potter," I said to him, still feeling a little embarrassed and angry. "You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort." I squinted at Weasley.
At that moment, she delicately placed her hand on my lower thigh. I squirmed uncomfortably and a little bit of panic kicked in as I shoved her hand off, resulting in an upset face.
'I could punch him in the stomach and make him drop the letter', Cons? 'He could expel me for violence.'
In the middle of class, Ron's arm that was resting on my chair suddenly started shifting. His fingers started tracing patterns on my back. I squirmed uncomfortably and looked up at him to see what he was playing at. But he was looking right at the teacher. I narrowed my eyes and turned my head back to face the teacher like everyone else.
Draco felt a lump form in his throat as Harry just stared at him, green eyes boring into his grey ones. Harry seemed to finally understand what Draco said and cleared his throat. A look of suspicion still on his face as he slowly nodded. "Malfoy, I would like to be friends."
From now on, the plot of this book will be loosely based on the plot of the movies, but a lot of it will be made up. All rights still go to JK Rowling.
"He was glaring at me. I was glaring back," I laughed nervously. Ron furrowed his eyebrows but shook his head with a small smile. He turned back to face forward as we walked to our first class.
Draco huffed in annoyance and banged his head on the table. He thought about lying and writing how unattractive he is, but he wasn't sure of the consequences that would come from the potion. The quill made scritch scratch noises as he continued writing.
"MMPH!" I cried against his lips that were now on mine. I pulled with all my might and soon my left hand was free. I socked him in the jaw just as he reached into my boxers. He stumbled backward and fell off the couch. I let out a gasp and pulled out my wand that I couldn't grab during the assault. Blaise sat up holding the side of his face. I must've gotten his nose as well because it was bleeding. He looked at me with confused wide eyes.
I walked back to the Slytherin commons room and whispered in the password. As soon as I got back to the room, I was ambushed. Blaise grabbed my wrist and pulled me into the room. I yanked against his grip, "What the hell!" He forced me onto the couch and pushed me down. I let out a scream and he climbed on top of me. I searched his eyes and pleaded for him to stop as he pinned my wrists over my head and started to grind on me. His hips were between mine and he was completely on top of me. I couldn't move. His dark eyes were darker than usual and he leaned down to suck on my neck. His warm tongue found my sweet spot and I unintentionally let out a tiny grunt.
Her eyes opened widely and she took in my shirtless appearance, she smirked and said, "Damn,  Draco. If I knew you always looked like this in the mornings, I'd have kidnapped you to wake up by me every morning."
"DRACO!" Pansy's voice was becoming clearer, "I'm going to go get someone! Just wait here!" Just as she was about to run out of the bathroom I spoke, "No Pans, it's okay." But even I surprised myself over how weak and raspy my voice sounded. She turned around and slowly kneeled to get to my level.
"I was serious. I hate fighting," he sighed, looking extremely uncomfortable and vulnerable. "Whatever, it was a stupid idea," he sneered and turned away after I didn't say anything for a while. I wanted to call out and have him turn around. I wanted to accept his request because, damn, this rivalry kept me up at night. Sometimes at night, my mind replayed when he'd smile when talking to Blaise and Pansy. Or my mind would remind me of his soft-looking hair. And I would panic. Because....
'Why should I? I have no one to impress anyway.' I brooded. But then a face popped into my mind and a weird sensation formed in my stomach.
"Anything from the cart, boys?" An old muggle lady smiled as she passed our cabin. I gave a polite smile, even though I was disgusted that they hired muggles on this train.
Harry narrowed his eyes, not having any of Draco's bullshit. "Malfoy, why was my name on there?" That's when Draco almost passed out. 'Did he know? How much did he read?' Draco tried making up a reasonable story in his brain but all of them were complete shit. He let out a breath he didn't realize he was holding and tried thinking of a truthful story. Harry tapped his foot expectingly and his hand was still wrapped around his wand just in case Draco tried anything funny.
'Odd.' I thought while taking a bite out of a big green apple. I looked around while taking another crisp bite. A little bit of juice trickled down my lip and I quickly swiped it with my thumb. Pansy walked over and sat down concerned.
"Looking for this?" I smirked. His grey eyes flicked to mine and panic spread all over his face. He tried masking his panic with anger.
Then I looked down and a piece of folded up parchment laid on the ground. I bent down to pick it up just as Draco started patting down his pockets. He started muttering "no no no" as he practically ripped off his robe in hopes to find something. I came back up holding the letter.
Then I heard Professor McGonagall's voice yell something along the lines of, "What are you doing?" And Moody replied, "teaching."
That comment set an uneasy feeling into my stomach and I hunched over running to my bathroom. Curling over the toilet, I dry heaved into the toilet. My body was wracking and sobs escaping my mouth. as I struggled to get air in my lungs. I felt vile and clammy. My entire body feeling a cold sweat break over me and I could feel a heavy pounding in my mouth, ears, and chest. Vaguely Pansy's voice was in the background but it sounded like she was underwater. My ears were ringing and all I could feel was Blaise's scalding hands lingering on my skin. I wanted to throw everything up. I wanted the ground to swallow me up. A tear splashed into the empty toilet and I started coming back to my senses.
A beat of silence and then Draco rolled his eyes, huffing in manner that implied no man had ever been more put-upon than Draco Lucius Malfoy. Sliding down onto his back, he turned to Harry and raised an eyebrow. Harry let the duvet cover them, but there was still a foot of space between them in the bed, and Draco’s eyebrow was right, it wasn’t exactly cosy.
“Of course father.” Draco had nodded eagerly. “But a bit of goodwill from Fudge might make it possible to waive the Wizengamot entry fees and-”
“Probably,” Harry shrugged and the leapt, his trousers slipping down slightly and showing cotton-clad arse. Huffing and puffing, the Saviour of the Magical World flopped onto his back and pulled his trousers back up, glaring at Draco while he did it. “Stop staring at my arse.”
A few days later, the truncated breakfast conversation looped in Draco’s mind as the three Malfoys watched the Irish Beaters fall into formation. High up in the stands, a flash of orange caught Draco’s wandering gaze and he focused his omnioculars on the Weasley clan. Ginny was sat next to a soft, curvy woman who must be her mother and on the other side of her was-
“The man you spent all of last night slobbering over in Millicent’s shrubbery.” Draco persisted. “Terribly gauche, Potter. What if
Potter beamed and began happily burbling on about James’ last Quidditch game as Draco immediately allowed his mind to wander.
“Oh dear me,” said McGonagall as she waved her wand over Draco. A cool, gel-like sensation smoothed along his overheated neck and Draco found himself returning to human form. “There, that’s much better.” McGonagall inspected him over the top of her glasses.
“Shh.”Iincredibly, Draco sounded like he was already drifting back to sleep. “Don’t make it weird... Potter.”
“Pleasure!” Chrissy all but bellowed, rubbing her hands together. “Now, let’s get started. Ro—we’ve put the girls on the sixth floor, you’ll take them. Boys are on the seventh, so come with me lads and-” She was interrupted by a loud crack as Professor McGonagall Apparated into the hotel foyer.
“Yeah I want you too but I’m a bit pressed for time here.” Harry lifted his hand to rub the back of his neck, only for Draco to catch hold of it. “We need to get this sorted before—”
. In that moment, Harry wished he had, indeed, faceplanted on the dildos earlier and poked out an eye. At least that would have got him out of this mess. “Come on, Haz! Sucking cock isn’t that hard!”
“Well this removes the pressure. The mist knows your true heart.” Mafalda paused to simper at Millicent in a manner that was, frankly, uncalled for. “Even if you say it’s fine, everyone else will know you don’t want to kiss the other person, and so you just kiss something else instead.”
“Of course we have your generosity to thank for that,” Fudge was saying. “All these rumours about You Know Who and Dumbledore’s own, ah, eccentricities. We want our graduates to have maximum confidence in the Ministry, both as a governing body and a future employer-”
“Watch me not care.” Ginny interrupts Percy’s attempt to defend himself. “Anyway, Draco, what’s up?”
Once Tonks had extracted everything Draco knew about the Malfoy Martyrs, she turned him loose with a cheerful threat about what would happen to him if he “tried any of those Slytherin shenanigans on Haz”. A threat which left Draco simultaneously outraged and rather pleased at the implication that he might have means, motivation and opportunity to shenanigan Harry.
“And how was it for you? Draco?” Hermione asked, still glaring furiously at Harry. “Did you enjoy your nice date? Or was watching one of the most tragic films ever to be—”
His thoughts continued on their maddening hamster wheel, throwing out reminders of the way Harry had leapt in the air to avoid being hit. The way that stupid, flappy jumper had lifted again, flashing a tantalizing glimpse of-
“Yeah, they can be horrible little fuckers. Guess we know all about that,” Potter gestured between the two of them, offering Draco another grimace, “‘s much worse when it’s your own kids though. What did you do about it? The kids who were mean to Scorpius?”
“Yeah, massive turn on.” Harry’s voice was dry enough to dessicate the swamp. “Come on, sex god, last one before we can shower and tell Angelina we’re dropping the team.”
He was definitely the only person caught in the time loop. No one else had tried to leave since Draco arrived and he was fairly sure that he’d recognise the wide-eyed look of panic if any of them had been jolted back in time. Just because Malfoy’s were trained to wrestle their expressions into submission from the crib didn’t mean that everyone had that habit.
“Are you sure it was seventeen, Draco?” Harry asked. “And not maybe three or some number that’s easier to repeat?”
“Arse.” Climbing to his feet, Harry stuck out a hand to help Draco up. “It’s fine to fancy your friends, natural, even. You know what’s not normal for friends to do?” He took a step forwards. Draco was too close to the edge of the platform to give way and the move brought Harry right into his space.
“No-oh?” said the waitress, giving him an uneasy look. “That’s Harry, he introduced himself when he came in.” The words ‘unlike some people’ floated unspoken between them. To think that Draco would see the day when a Muggle was using Harry fucking Potter to lecture him about good manners.
Ron and Hermione froze, their eyes darting towards Harry as if he were going to do anything other than curse the day he met them.
“Come here then,” he muttered. Harry had just enough time to notice that Draco’s eyes had grown to nearly double their normal size and then he was kissing Draco. On the mouth. With... tongue? Apparently tongues were in the mix as Draco gave a muffled squeak and parted his lips.
With that she grabbed her parka from behind the kitchen door, snarling “Hello” at a startled Draco who was just coming up the garden steps. “I’m getting Luna to act as a mediator,” Hermione called over her shoulder. “She’ll sort you out.”
“Well…” Words, where were words? “Office comradery is invaluable and…” Draco gave up looking for words and instead concentrated on closing his mouth.
“But Draco... he wanted to kiss me before,” said Harry, eyes darting around the room. The other Gryffindors flashed uneasy smiles his way, a few of them shaking their heads.
Draco closed his eyes and waited for the time loop to catapult him back to Potter. Who he should probably call ‘Harry’, if they were going to... going to... Draco really had no idea what they were going to do or where that conversation had been headed. His heart felt like it was about to burst out of his chest as the toxic combination of adrenalin and booze-soaked Cheerios played havoc with his stomach.
“It is one o’clock in the morning.” Professor McGonagall marched into the room, restoring the sofa to its original position against the wall with a flick of her wand. Various squeaks erupted from the sofa’s inhabitants. “We are here as guests of the Sheffield Central Travelodge, representing Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.” Everyone looked suitably cowed. “Never, in all my days, have I seen such a flagrant disregard-” She interrupted herself with a loud, jaw-cracking yawn. “Oh, I...”
“Hey, Draco.” Harry leaned forward to wave his hand in front of Draco’s face, grinning at the horrified double-take this earned him. “Can I show you something?”
“An inaccurate representation of the Chaser position?” Harry grinned back. “Seriously, they spend most of the match flying while we’re floating up top.”
Annoyed, Harry dragged Ron and Cormac onwards while the water witch shouted “Hydrate or die, loves!” after them in a rather threatening voice. The next stand was, again, full of dildos. Why were there so many bloody (not literally) dildos everywhere? Harry was sure Hermione would have a lot to say about the phallic nature of the fair. This particular collection looked rather unusual. Harry frowned. The fake penises looked like they were made from wood and stone. And, was that one ivory?
“Interesting; maybe we should consider playing by these Muggle rules,” said Cassius. “You know,” he said, turning to Mafalda, “in the name of Magical-Muggle Cooperation and all that.”
“Sod off.” Tonks gasped. Her hair was a rather queasy shade of mushroom. “You can’t just...” she paused to do some frankly pornographic gasping “you can’t just leave! You are part of an ongoing investigation!”
“Been here before, then?” Harry asked. “You know,” he nudged Draco’s shoulder with his own. “On your dates with all those firemen.”
“Nothing.” Draco felt himself sway slightly, leaning into Harry’s space. Sleep-deprivation, that’s what it was. Harry smiled.
“He’s fine! Bit banged up but your Dad’s a tough one.” Ron interjected. He was standing with his arm around a small, skinny boy with floppy black hair and smudged glasses.
“You must know what peer pressure is, Potter,” Mafalda joined in. “The feeling that everyone else is doing something so you should too.”
“Hag.” Draco pretended to push her over, only to have to grab the doorstep again when the mud shifted beneath his feet. By the time he’d regained his balance, Millicent had finished cackling and was halfway up the climbing wall. This really was the most ridiculous activity Draco had ever engaged in.
“What about Draco?” Harry was still bleary with sleep. He watched in confusion as Snape shrugged and picked his way over to the window, throwing it open in the manner of a man performing an exorcism. “Um.” Harry stood, Accioing the rest of his clothes. “I’ll just... go... then.” He inched towards the door. “Er...”
“A new nickname?” he asks, without much hope. Percy’s ex-wife Penelope had introduced herself as ‘Pea Weasley’ at the Hogwarts Reconciliation Ball, and while the marriage had not lasted, the association had.
“Library, yes, of course.” Draco hastily backs out of the kitchen, pausing a moment to collect himself in the dark hallway. Right.
“You do sound like a bit of a prat, mate,” said Ron, putting another round of drinks on the table. Harry absently noted that the new drinks probably meant Ron had actually left the table at some point. “Sounds like Draco just wanted to be mates and you read into it.” Ron continued, apparently oblivious to the fact that he should be banned from speaking, forever. “Still not on for him to be ashamed of you, though.”
“Neither is being a posh twit who lies out of his arse,” Harry snapped. “But I didn’t notice you complaining when Lockhart was made DADA Professor.”
“Yeah, ahem, er. Yes.” Draco agreed, glancing around to see if there was a convenient pillow for him to scream into. Or a gaping void.
His expression was so mournful that, with a great sigh, Draco stood and marched towards the door. Maybe 28 would be the magic number to break the time loop, he reflected as he reached out to touch the cardboard monkey. And if it wasn’t at least Potter could order a less obnoxious bowl of cereal.
“Ron.” Harry groaned. Everyone around them had started talking again but it was still incredibly awkward. Had he really imagined this whole thing? Draco did like cooking for people but… “What about the cinema?” He asked, turning to Draco. “It was a Friday night. Date night. I held your hand when Tod died.”
Draco winced again at the memory of Scorpius’ strained reassurances that he “really wouldn’t mind if you wanted to, um, you know, um, meet... someone, a person... you know, for, um... dating, dad.”
“Will that really work?” Harry was rather surprised at how mild his question sounded. He was still fuming. His head hurt and the blood in his chest felt like it was swishing back-and-forth at an alarming speed.
“Not a lot,” Draco admitted, settling further back in his seat. Potter managed to make the rusty garden furniture look like it was made for lounging but the ridges of Draco’s spine immediately began to ache. He sat up again. “I told Scorpius that he was a beautiful boy who was going to make a first class Beater,” he continued. “Then I had a word with the teacher, and banned mother from talking about diets.”
“I do not give a single, muddy, shit what it’s called. Do you want to go out with me? Because you looked pretty upset when I stopped flirting with you back there, and it’s given me this awkward medical condition called Hope.”
“So...” he said, green eyes floating back to Draco. “Should we have a chat, then? You know, to please Hermione and Pansy.”
“Yeah.” Harry shrugged. The plan tonight had been to get a bit pissed, chat about the Canons’ chances in the League qualifiers; and then maybe stop off for a falafel on the way home. He wasn’t really prepared to talk about the dark, sour things that pressed in on him whenever he thought about Draco. “Look, can we just…not?”
“Nice to see Draco sticking up for you.” Ron shrugged, toasting Draco with what used to be Harry’s pint. “Come on then, if watching such a miserable film didn’t put him off you, what did?”
“Funny you should ask, Draco,” Potter's eyes twinkled as he turned towards Draco. “I’ve actually always been a bit partial to green.”
“Y-yes.” Granger issued a pathetic sob, her eyes darting once again to Potter. “D-dumbledore told us that if-if we joined his army that we would be saved fr-from the weapon.” Umbridge nodded, greedily, leaning over Grangers chair and offering her a tissue.
“Draco?” Harry is covering the phone, twisting to look over his shoulder. The movement makes the edge of his t-shirt catch against one of the cushions, and there it is again. “Do you need the phone? I’ll just be a minute.”
“Er. I think my mate is going to let his boyfriend put that up his arse.” He nodded to Cormac, Ron, and the towering, sugary dildo.
“Alright I asked you. But you’re the one who said Angelina should ask Robards if it could be included in the Auror fitness training program, making it impossible for either of us to back out.”
“Ah,” said Draco, darting a glance to Harry. “Cheerful topic. Do you, um. Is this a conversation you wish to pursue? As it were?”
“Oh?” Millicent shifted her focus back to Harry. “What would you call forcing yourself on someone against their will? Foreplay?”
“Right,” Draco pulled out his phone, groping unseeingly for his drink as he did so. Pansy and Granger had been friends ever since they got talking at a Magical Menstruation Board Meeting but apart from a few awkward dinners there had never been any real attempt to merge the two groups. Pansy had said that she’d like it if Draco and Potter could spend more than 15 minutes in the same postcode without getting into an argument but she would never... she wouldn’t have...
When Ron returned with Cormac, it turned out that Cormac did, indeed, have a photo of his arse at hand. Thankfully, it was only a picture of his bum and not his anus, so the only thing the woman could divine was that he should target his gluteus medius in his training sessions because the muscle was underdeveloped.
“Roger?” Harry vaguely remembered a pale hazy face that wasn’t quite pointy enough, floating eyes that were brown instead of grey. After Ron had said Draco might fancy him, Harry had planned to enjoy the weekend before going into the office and asking to be assigned a different partner. “I didn’t snog him.” Harry heard himself say around a mouthful of toast. “I don’t think. No, I wouldn’t have.”
“When I realised that you two are still doing that creepy couples’ code thing and decided to drown myself in the bogs.” Harry announced, glaring at them both.
“I don’t want to know.” Harry stood, wishing he’d volunteered to go with Snape to the chippy. “Talk about something else.”
“And I stand by it! I want to have fun, ok? I want to go out drinking with our friends and I want to make out with Ron, my boyfriend, remember? Who I didn’t see for weeks because I was stuck in that flat playing emotional midwife for you and Draco. And I want-” she raised her voice to speak over Harry’s protest, “to be able to do all that without you looking miserable. Draco is coming over. We are going to talk this out.”
Lucius did have hyperbolic tendencies when it came to the written word (and most other words, too), but Draco was slowly learning to tell fact from fantasy and it seemed that, despite the flowery prose, Lucius was telling the truth. Being a Malfoy would not protect Draco from a life lived in obscurity or the Dark Lord’s censure.
The text ended with a dancing woman, a cocktail, a beer, and, inexplicably, another aubergine. Draco felt sick.
“I should! With all the possible combinations, you and I flew for nine hours today. That's eighteen hours between us. How long did the Chasers fly? Five hours, if we’re being generous.”
“I let you sleep on my sofa.” Draco grinned, taking a sip of tea. “Next to my lovely cat, and I made you breakfast. Some would say you were lucky to have me.”
Draco was so distracted by the delightful way Harry’s mouth dropped slightly open that he almost missed Harry’s reply. Of course, “almost” is a very important word here because, as we have already established, Draco Lucius Malfoy was no fool and when Harry James Potter says that you can kiss him, you grab your chance and you bloody kiss him.
Draco didn’t need the owl from his mother, or the firecall from his father, to understand that he needed to get on Umbridge’s good side. Years of being able to transform at will and coaching from McGonagall had improved Draco’s control. But stress still brought out his furry alter ego and those early lessons with Moody had taught Draco that becoming a ferret was no proof against torture. Indeed, a few tea parties with Umbridge had made it crystal clear to Draco that she was likely to reach new, sadistic heights if faced with a rogue, undocumented Animagus.
The whispered words seemed to scream through the kitchen. Draco was staring at Harry like he was a complete idiot, eyes darting back and forth.
After some awkward hovering, most of the Slytherin team had ended up on the rock hard sofa. Having spent an ill-advised 30 seconds sitting on that sofa, Harry knew that the shiny purple and grey beast might as well have been carved out of granite. Although, he supposed he could see why the Slytherins felt a bit uneasy about sitting on the hotel room’s other double bed. That was the bed Harry was supposed to be sharing with Oliver, despite the Weasley twins’ protestations.
“Wicked.” Ron’s head jerked up, scanning the crowd. “Do you mind waiting here for a bit? My boyfriend would love this-” it was the first time Harry had heard Ron admit out loud that Cormac was his boyfriend, “-back in a mo.” Ron gave the arse reader an excited thumbs-up and jogged off into the crowd.
“Um, no,” said Harry. “She’s not ‘doing a great job’ because it still makes no sense and it’s not rape.”
Only a few months later and Draco's friendliness had already been rewarded with an invite to spend the summer with the Zabinis and a new Nimbus 2001 broom. Upon hearing that her son had made a new friend, Zadie Zabini, had put her latest husband's vaults to good use and splurged on Nimbus 2001s for the whole Slytherin team. Not that anyone was supposed to know, the delivery had been made after dinner and the only reason Draco knew (and got first pick of the brooms) was because he was Blaise's closest friend. Blaise's only friend, really, Draco reflected to himself as he looked up at the still immovable stairs. Maybe he should make an effort to include Blaise more, at least suggest that-
“How long have you known about this?” Harry ignored them both and turned to Draco, a thrill of joy shooting through him as he realised Draco was sitting with his arm lightly resting on the back of Harry’s chair.
Draco leaned forward to spin the bottle, a slightly dazed look still on his face, and Harry turned to see Cassius staring at the pair of them. After a few moments Harry made the 'piss off, you wanker' gesture, to which Cassius only smiled in his superior way. It was all a bit disconcerting—so much so that Harry missed who Draco’s spin landed on.
“Sorry, er, Draco. When I think about that night you sort of turn into Malfoy, again.” Harry hadn’t realised he felt that way but as he spoke he knew it was the truth.
The Badger’s Bunion was a big, scruffy pub, perched on one of the many fault lines between Muggle and Magical London. It was also the first search result that had popped up when Draco typed “normal pub for normal people” into Woogle. Casting a glance over the scruffy exterior, large windows plastered with the posters advertising 2-4-1 Jaggerbombs and Selfie Shots, Draco ruefully conceded to himself that normality was overrated.
“Before Hogwarts, I was maybe four or five.” Draco responded absent-mindedly, his attention still focused on the idea of Potter making illicit use of the Prefects Bathroom. The cheek of the man.
“Bad boy.” Narcissa smiled, tapping the back of his hand with her teaspoon. “You shouldn’t tease. Binky really is in a lot of pain.”
“Huh.” Harry abruptly lets the t-shirt drop, stepping around Draco and making for the stairs. “Interesting.”
“Sorry, I drank it all.” Draco Accioed the ketchup, it hit the light and then smacked down onto the table, sending a red fountain into the air.
“Malfoy,” Harry shook his head, because of course it was Draco. Green smoke erupted from the neck of the bottle; as he straightened up, Harry was dimly aware that everyone else had started whistling and whooping. Turning to Draco, he shifted across the duvet until they were facing each other.
“Fine,” Harry huffed. He spun the bottle a little too vigorously and it shot away at an angle, smashing off the wardrobe. Silence filled the room as team Slytherdor gawped at Harry. “Er... sorry about that. I’ll be more careful.”
“Alright,” Potter fumbled for his wand, pointing it at Draco under the table and muttering the spell. Nothing happened. “Are you going to tell me what’s going on?”
“Alright,” the fluffy-haired fool didn’t look especially bothered by Draco’s tone. “I think Al would like them to be friends, although he’ll kill me for saying it.”
Sighing, Severus opened yet another cardboard box full of broken glass. In the aftermath of the scrimmage in the Department of Mysteries all the smashed prophecies had been swept up and packed away by the Ministry cleaning team. Now it was Severus’ privilege to paw through these boxes of glass and dust balls, in search of prophecies that could be either restored or recorded and then disposed of.
“Excuse me.” Draco spoke for the first time since Harry had asked about the consent charm. “What do you mean?”
“I...” panic clawed at Draco’s chest and throat. He stood, tipping his flimsy chair over and knocking his new drink onto the floor. “I have to go.” He turned and walked towards the door. Looking over his shoulder he saw Potter start to follow, calling for Draco to wait. Shaking his head one last time, Draco brushed aside the cardboard monkey. Once again, he felt that familiar hitch behind his belly button and the world tipped 90 degrees before disappearing into darkness.
“What are you hiding?” Harry asked, gesturing to where Draco’s shirt was stretched over his knees. Draco blinked back at him.
“He said that the same men who tried to kidnap me last month had also tried to take Draco.” Hermione was back to business, flicking her wand to finish off the sandwich as she returned Harry’s stare. “He said that they’d try again and that I wasn’t safe in the house.”
“I can assure you, Potter, that we will not be ordering any food,” said Draco. “Or at least you will not be. I will be ordering food with my date who will be here soon and I’m sure very distressed at the sight of a pint-sized saviour squatting in his seat.”
“Haz.” Cormac clapped him on the back, giving him the kind of patronising look a teacher gave to a child. “You’re just too vanilla.”
“Drink.” The waitress placed matching beakers on the table. “Have you decided what you want to order yet?”
“Indeed.” Draco thoughts were racing as he continued walking towards the tent. “Of course. Indeed.” He sat down next to Scorpius, absently wrapping his arm around the boy’s shoulders and resting his chin on soft white hair. “Absolutely, makes perfect sense. Rewatching the tapes. Of course. All of them. Indeed.”
“And thirdly.” Ron raised his voice. “Do you want to talk about it before Draco comes back with the drinks?”
“It’s not like that.” Hermione kicked back at Harry’s trainer, both arms wrapped around her waist. “The sandwich was for you. Memory Charms always make me hungry so...” She shrugged.
“Not when I lick it off your chest,” Malfoy said, sounding a bit dazed. His eyes were fixed on Harry’s lips and there was a decisive flush spreading across his neck.
“You thought, you hoped-” Draco corrects himself, “-that I was coming up here to laugh at you for having a tattoo of yourself.”
“Oi oi! What’s all this about ‘vigorously rubbing?’” Fred had noticed their conversation, possibly because they had both leapt to their feet and were speaking at the highest possible volume.
“Oh, I do apologise.” Draco was starting to look irritated. Good, Harry quite fancied a fight. “Spending time alone with an unmarried wizard, what was I thinking? Clearly that denotes a romantic entanglement. I do hope that Blaise, Pansy, my own mother, Theo, Luna and every other friend I have ever spent more than 10 seconds alone with will understand as I am clearly dating them all.” Spent, he collapsed back into his chair, glaring at Harry.
“Yeah I saw, lucky thing.” Angelina smiled in a way that didn’t quite reach her eyes. “Sorry, we should have explained the game before we started playing. You’re so good at all this flying shit, it’s easy to forget you were raised Muggle.”
As Harry failed to identify the flavours or, alternatively, as he gagged over the terrible ones, Malfoy was getting more and more flustered. In fact, every time Harry licked a dildo, Malfoy’s movements became jerkier and his voice fainter. By the time Harry asked who on earth wanted to lick sunscreen flavoured lube from other people’s bodies, Malfoy’s recurrent
Draco… Draco is at a loss. Harry does not have a dragon tattoo. Harry has a tattoo that is designed to be seen by anyone, to be admired by anyone. As tattoos are, Draco reminds himself. That is, generally, why people get tattoos, temporary or not. People do not just go around tattooing themselves with symbols of their old school rivals, no matter how much Draco might-
. The table was set for two and there was a pile of toast and a plate of scrambled eggs steaming under a Stasis charm. “Ullo,” Harry coughed, tried again. “Hello, thanks for letting me crash.”
“Dunno.” Ron took another gulp of his pint. “Makes you squirm a bit more when I remind you that it’s Malfoy you’re shagging?”
“Hey.” Ginny reaches over to snap her fingers in front of Draco’s face. “Not that I mind listening to Percy drone on about cursed rectums-”
The Weasley library was actually just a slightly wider section of the first floor landing, inhabited by a comfy window seat, the Muggle phone stand (swathed in a protective bubble), and a collection of sudoku books. Harry is curled up on the seat, the phone jammed between his shoulder and cheek as he traces patterns on the condensation-streaked glass.
“Oh, all of them.” Potter laughed again and Draco smiled in return. “Well, most of my rage is reserved for the students at Klanghorn Cottage Primary School.” Potter nodded in recognition and Draco continued. “Scorpius was already bigger than the other children when he joined Klanghorn and children... well... they’re very cruel, aren’t they?”
“Don’t know, do I.” Potter grinned, he seemed to be doing that a lot. “Didn’t really have a chance to make up my mind. Might have wanted to go for my old house colours or something.”
“Saving the public indecency? No, no. I imagine we’ll find time to fit that in.” Draco smiled, delighting in the way Potter’s shoulders shook as he laughed.
“You know as well?” Draco asked. He was sitting up straight, assessing the three of them. “Tell me. Unless it’s private, of course. Although if it is private I will have you know that the Malfoys are excellent secret keepers. Minds like vaults, once something is in there it’s—”
“Flying without purpose,” Draco insisted, shifting closer to Harry and casting a nervous glance towards the Gryffindor Chasers. “They can bounce that Quaffle back and forth as much as they want, but theatrical showboating will not save the day against one well-caught Snitch.”
“How did you… she was standing here less than five seconds ago.” Draco turned to Harry in consternation. A consternation that increased when he realised that they were still very much wrapped around each other. “Surely that isn’t possible. Or normal.”
“Yeah, think she might have got Pansy in on it too.” Potter grinned ruefully and ran a hand through his hair.
“Ahh!” A young woman with bright red lipstick and sunglasses of the same shade regained her balance and looked at him accusingly. Well, he assumed she did, he couldn’t really see her eyes. “I could av dropped ze croizzantz!” Her voice was definitely accusing. She was holding a big silver plate of croissants in one of her hands. She was also clearly not French. Or Bulgarian. Or whatever that accent was supposed to be.
“Hold up Malfoy.” Potter interrupted staring at his own phone for a moment before turning to the waitress. “We need a few more minutes, thanks.”
“I believe the book was published during a time when alliterative titles were proving rather popular,” Malfoy waved off Harry’s incredulous look. “The point is that prophecies are, essentially, rituals. Rituals that must follow a certain number of steps, in a certain order, to be effective. If our magical cores have changed due to our…” he paused. “Our ability to…”
“Thought we agreed you were going to stop matchmaking, mate.” Harry paused to examine a ‘How To Become A Daddy Kit’, recoiling when he realised it had nothing to do with conception. Merlin, people really did have to ruin everything these days, didn’t they?
When Harry woke again it was dawn. The London traffic was starting to rev as the orange light pollution faded into grey sky. Blinking, Harry realised he still had his glasses on. The bridge of his nose hurt, and his right temple throbbed where the arm of the glasses had dug in.
“Albus?” Draco had just enough time to wonder if the evening’s series of unfortunate events had concluded with the resurrection of his old Headmaster; before he was being enveloped in a fierce hug from Scorpius.
Harry had always thought that none of the however many days in his life he had still to experience would have the same horror potential as the days spent fighting the Dark Lord. And yet, it looked like The Worst Day of His Life Award was about to get a new winner. Worst of all: his friends were to blame for his misery. Ron Weasley (formerly known as his best friend, having been declassed to a mere friend right when they stepped through the entrance of the hall) and Cormac McLaggen (ex-best friend’s excitable boyfriend) were proving to be Voldemort’s strongest competition in bringing misery into Harry’s life. At least Voldemort had the decency to only fill his life with terror and pain, instead of with bone-crushing embarrassment that looked to be more Cormac’s forte.
The Portable Swamp only took a few minutes to completely cover the floor. This was more than enough time for Draco to start having second thoughts. And third thoughts. And fourth and fifth and sixth thoughts. Basically, he was having a lot of thoughts, and a few feelings, about signing up for this.
“31…” Draco had lost track of the decrees after the one banning an infestation of Muggle Beanie Babies. Was 31 something to do with Extendable Ears or-
“You’re dropping the team?” Draco asked, climbing up after Harry and very carefully not thinking about being called a sex god, even as a joke. It took a while for the second platform to swing close enough for them to jump.
“I’m not showing off,” Hermione insisted. “I do really feel sorry for him. He told me that Bellatrix Lestrange used to make him pour Voldemort’s tea.”
Ron was now rubbing soothing circles on Draco’s back as he used his teeth to rip open one of those plastic cellophane Mini-Mungos-Medi packs. They didn’t really know each other well enough for Ron to kidnap Draco from a date and then start petting him like a Kneazle. Then again, Draco was feeling a bit wobbly and the back stroking was rather nice.
“Very well.” Draco smoothed his hair, pointless now that he didn’t have any gel in it, and marched out of the breakroom. “Are you coming? Potter? Or do I have to catch this criminal myself?”
And there he was, with that ridiculous pointy face and that ridiculous flush, waving those ridiculous hands and talking with that ridiculous, ridiculous mouth that Harry missed so much. The whole thing was a disaster. They had enough trouble containing themselves when they met in pubs and at ministry functions. Meeting in a hall full of sex toys was begging for catastrophe.
“Yes.” This time Draco’s wince was strong enough to smush his entire face. “They intercepted some of my owls to Scorpius where I was less than flattering about the city of Leicester in general and about the ghost guides at Ashby de la Zouch Castle specifically.”
“He does look like Malfoy, though.” Ron insisted. “Bet he would have hated knowing his mug portrait likes getting naked for the Chosen One.”
“But the two of us as the only players on the pitch, chasing after the Snitch for hours wouldn’t be vainglorious at all?”
“Yes.” Draco blinked a bit. “Well the Malfoy Martyrs read the letters and, um. Well they avenged my honour, as it were, by performing a mass exorcism, not a very good one, but, ah, a few of the ghost guides got a little... splashed... by some of that Muggle firewhisky-”
“I thought we’d be given the same dish?” said Draco, eyeing the multicoloured contents of Potter’s bowl. His own bowl was half-full of browny-grey mush.
“Really? Why’s that?” Something about Potter’s easy grin made another wave of heat rush through Draco.
Harry waited until George and Katie had collected everyone's orders and headed off to the vending machines.
Not for the first time, or the hundredth and first time, Draco asked himself why that lurid pack of Weasels was more palatable to Potter than Draco’s own company. Granted, the boy had some questionable views on blood purity, but what was a little bad blood (Draco chuckled to himself) between allies? If Potter wasn’t such a sanctimonious prig, the two of them could be running Hogwarts by now. The Ravenclaws were a law unto themselves but Potter would have brought the prudish ‘Puffs while Draco won the hearts and minds of the more hedonistic Huffles. Draco hadn’t quite worked out how he would accomplish this winning over—maybe a big cake?—but it hardly mattered as Potter had shunned all attempts at friendship.
“I said I was going out to buy tampons for my girlfriend,” said Malfoy. “That’s all it took to give them the slip. I suppose I should be grateful that the kidnappers didn’t waltz up to the Manor, brandishing a packet of Kotex. They’d have been waved straight through.”
“Harry.” Hermione was standing in the doorway, a silk scarf wrapped around her head. “Shut up. Shut up right now. Or at least keep your voice down.”
“Tiger.” Malfoy’s voice was tight, as if he himself wasn’t sure whether he found it funny or irritating. “Merlin, he’s even worse than I remember.” Then, as if finally deciding that Cormac was more comical than anything else, Malfoy laughed. It was a short, quiet laugh, but it still made Harry smile. “So.”
Now that the swamp was ready, Ginny and Angelina were busy charming various obstacles into place. A climbing wall, a tire tunnel, monkey bars and some floating platforms. It didn’t look very much like the pictures Angelina had thrust under Draco’s nose.
“Right,” said Harry, not completely sure what was going on but ready to give it a go. “Shall we go and get breakfast, then?”
“I don’t…” Draco hovers. They are all so damnably knowing. Smiling and nodding and telling him where to find Harry, as if he cares. Well, obviously Draco does care. There is the question of the dragon tattoo to undress-unwrap, he mentally corrects himself. But he didn’t care enough to warrant an entire table of Weasleys and assorted hangers-on looking at him and, and, and-
“No,” said Malfoy. “No, no. Absolutely not. I won’t do it. Waiting around, jumping at every noise.” His voice was rising. “I did quite enough of that during the war, thank you very much.”
from the wonderful fleamontpotter and realised that I must have subconsciously absorbed her brilliance and claimed it for my own.
“Very well,” sighing as if his own wand had offended him, Mr Snape performed the incantation, sending a stream of green light to wind itself around Harry’s temples.
“I don’t understand.” It didn’t make any sense. Draco hadn’t done anything to break the time loop. He hadn’t grown and he hadn’t changed and he definitely wasn’t a better wizard than he had been when he entered the Cereal Monogamist.
“Right then.” Potter downed the last of his drink and then went back to staring in dismay at the two bowls of equally inedible cereal. “This is probably £30 worth of cereal we’ve fucked up the ordering of.”
“A weapon! On Hogwarts grounds!” Umbridge was practically vibrating with glee. “Needless to say, I will contact the Ministry immediately.”
“Really.” Draco’s eyes darted to Harry, his tone sharp. “He was rather fit, didn’t you fancy a cheeky snog?”
Laughter also brought out the creases around Potter’s eyes, making him look older and more touchable at the same time. The observation sent a thrill through Draco and he leant forward, resolving to have another go at asking Potter a few consequence-free questions.
“She doesn’t.” Janice interrupted, eyeing Ginny. Was that what he looked like, Draco wondered, when he interrogated Ravenclaws? Greedy and cruel? It was a disconcerting thought and he nearly missed Ginny’s response.
“Actually Mafalda and I are non-monogamous,” said Millicent. “We just don’t want to snog any of you. No offense.” Half the room failed not to look offended while the other half nodded in a knowing way.
“Dear, dear. Anyone who knew you at Hogwarts could tell them it’s a lost cause.” Draco takes a final step, standing almost but not quite between Harry’s knees.
As soon as the thought occurred to him Draco knew it was time to call it a night. Annoying Potter had lost its appeal a while ago, although he’d still hex Pansy, Draco decided as he stood and tossed some Muggle notes on the table.
“Look.” He said, wrapping his arms around himself and starting to bounce to keep warm. “I forgot, alright? It was years ago when I saw it, all I remembered was a film about two friends who overcame their differences. Also it’s called a ‘film’, by the way. Not that that’s important! Just, er…I’m sorry. I didn’t know that Tod—”
“That’s not true.” Harry turned back to Draco. The bed dipped between them. “About Seekers flying more. What about the Chasers?”
“She got worried that the fish was hungry,” Potter shuddered. “Took us three trips to St. Mungos before all the rice crispies were scooped out of her ear. I still have both those twins on my shitlist.”
“Very well. Another time, on a proper date.” He waited for Harry to nod. “One we both know we’re on.” Harry nodded again. “And now.” Draco turned back to Hermione and Ron. “To the real matter at hand, isn’t it time you tell Harry that you have moved back into his home?”
“-and after all that they finally finished it and I want to give it to him before the kickoff. There.” Ginny finished winding up which had probably been a very boring story and gave Draco’s sleeve
“Yeah.” Harry says again, for perhaps the thousandth time since Draco sat down. “Yeah, right.” He straightens up, talking a bit faster. “Yeah, yeah, ok, ok, ok, k, k, okthanksbyeseeyousoon!” He slams the phone down, grinning as Draco laughs. “Sorry. Work.”
“You’d rather have Voldemort for dinner? Over Harry?” Ron’s face was almost purple. “You fucking fuck, do you have any idea—”
“Yeah. Yeah, he is.” Harry nodded, heart skipping a beat at having admitted it out loud. It felt good to say it. Lubricating. No, liberating.
Yes. Harry was willing to forgo an evening doing redacted and redacted with Draco in order to spend time with the Malfoys.
“Wha—?” Harry protested, glancing up at Cassius. It must have been really hot in the room, because Cassius was blushing as well. A red haze settled over his handsome face as he glared at Harry. And that just didn’t make any sense, because Cassius’ cheeks went dark brown when he blushed - not that Harry had spent a lot of time cataloguing this - and his collar seemed to be blushing a bright pink, too.
, had become rather breathy. When Malfoy reached for another flask - this one full of rainbow glitter - Harry stopped him.
“Dad!” The sound of Scorpius’ voice drove all other thoughts from Draco’s head. “Over here Dad! Are you alright?” Scorpius was waving from behind the Auror tape, a wobbly smile threatening to tip over into tears.
When they passed from the entrance hall into a hall full of stands, Harry’s first thought was, “Maybe this won’t be so bad.” The stands by the door all looked rather innocent. Some displayed handcuffs, some had erotic massage oils made from magical herbs, some sold sexy lingerie (
Later, sitting at the pock and pencil marked table, Severus replayed the words of the prophecy. A pure-blood and an impure-blood who had witnessed Voldemort’s death. Magical cores. Presumably, the prophecy was not referring to wand cores, unless the writer pictured Potter choking down a dragon heartstring and a hank of unicorn tail. Magical essence, then. The indefinable, intangible,
that you choose the colour of the bowl you want and the chef creates a specially tailored menu for you.”
Reaching down to adjust himself, Harry glanced at Draco. Did he like Draco? Or was it just a while since he’d had a snog? Draco was sitting very still, his back straight and both hands folded in his lap as his eyes tracked the flying Quavers. He looked miserable.
As soon as his tongue touched the dildo, he knew why. Malfoy stood frozen in front of him, his eyes fixed on something behind Harry’s left shoulder.
As Harry watched the group on the twins’ bed rip into the chocolate while the Slytherins shifted uneasily on the sofa, he came to two realisations. The first was that this team bonding thing seemed to be working. Everyone was still awkward as fuck save for Oliver and Marcus who were snogging, and—to be honest—could do with being a bit more awkward.
Maybe the change is simply the way Draco is finally letting himself look at Harry. Letting himself take in broad, slightly curved shoulders. The way Harry’s t-shirt is still rucked up on the left side, showing off the soft swoop of his belly and revealing to the outside world the tattoo,
“Why aren’t you at school?” Scorpius’ last letter had informed Draco that Leopold was about to start the delicate moulting season. “Please tell me that you did not trust the feeding of Leopold to Professor Hagrid. Rockbuns are hardly an appropriate diet for-
“The Aurors failed to catch the ringleader.” Draco rubbed his mouth again. “They told me that one of their sources had hinted that the ringleader might have a very specific interest in me.”
“Selfishness?” Hermione raised the nearly empty bottle of wine she’d been sharing with Draco and gave him A Look.
As Draco watches, Harry leans back against the window and allows his thick thighs to fall slightly open, grinning at whatever reaction he sees on Draco’s face.
Harry had been trying to ignore the argument, but Draco’s descent into full-italics was enough to set the Auror Crups howling and it was clear that something had to be done.
“I was not...” Minerva trailed off, wondering how much of her conversation with herself Rolanda had heard. “That is to say, I was reminiscing about Igor’s insufferable speech the last time Durmstrang won the European Cup.”
manage it, Minerva McGonagall would finally get the chance to see a Hogwarts team lift the European Quidditch Cup. Immediately after which Igor Karkaroff would be cordially invited to shove it up his own arse.
“But that doesn’t change the fact that I want to make at least two hundred and seventy-three bad treacle tarts with you.”
“Because I feel like maybe now we’re past all that school nonsense things could be alright between us, yeah? I know we don’t know each other all that well but—”
“Right.” Draco nodded uncertainly, picking up his pint. Hermione fidgeted with a coaster for a few microseconds, then turned to Ron.
“Oi, Malfoy!” No longer able to ignore the voice repeatedly calling his name, Draco turned to confront the youngest Weasley.
Malfoy was coming closer and closer as Cormac pushed Harry up the stairs and onto the stage with so much force that he almost faceplanted on the dildos. When he straightened up, Harry was pleased to note that Malfoy’s smile, too, had acquired a nervous curve.
“A number of established magical families have latent Animagi traits,” McGonagall smiled. “A few centuries ago Black Animagi, for example-”
“Right,” said Draco, feeling rather off kilter. “Right, er. Right. See you later, Blaise. GiNERVa.” Ginny’s squeak of outrage followed him across the packed stadium foyer, up the stairs and all the way into the Minister’s box.
“Yes, I do.” She slammed the plate of biscuits down on the table. Harry knew why he was taking his bad temper out on their crockery, but what had got Hermione going? Unless...
"Draco? Do you want your pudding?" Crabbe grinned covered in chocolate. His teeth coated in it too. I pushed the glass towards him in a 'whatever' motion and he gave me a thumbs-up before shoving a spoonful of sugar into his mouth.
"Draco, please don't get into too much trouble," Mum whispered to me as she kissed my temple. I smiled mischievously and looked to Dad expectingly. He rose a brow and leaned down to whisper into my ear.
"Why so tense, Potter?" My muscles tensed up on cue and I looked up to where the sound was coming from. I sighed irritably. It's just Malfoy. He said that he and his father didn't think I'd last more than 10 minutes in the tournament and that's when I snapped. "I don't give a damn what your father thinks, Malfoy." I glared. It was true. I could care less about his father. But I did wish that Dra-Malfoy had more hope in me. Why? I don't know why. But I did care about what he thought, and it hurt that he was hoping I'd die. Why did that hurt so much?
"And yes, Pansy, I am very jealous. We are 4th years! It's not allowed, even though I really wanted to be part of it. And Potter must've had someone else do it for him. God that bloody git. He and his stupid friends just walk around and get whatever they want. It's like, all Potter does is breathe and '10 points to Gryffindor!'" I exclaimed in a mock of Dumbledore's voice.
Also, why I was getting turned on watching Draco eat a fucking apple. What the bloody hell was that about? I snickered to myself.
I felt guilty for laughing and he ran away, Moody right on his tail. I sighed and continued walking on my way to my next class.
I shoved him hard and heard him let out a low grunt, he looked so angry that the hair on the back of my neck stood up. "He's vile and cruel." I spat out, hurt and angry. It feels like everyone just wants me to lose. I felt a little bit of blood boil under my cheeks as his eyes looked me up and down. "And you're pathetic," I grumbled quietly, instantly regretting it.
I rolled my eyes and it was time for first class. Pansy grabbed my hand and we walked out of the great hall. But I snuck a quick peek over my shoulder to see Harry once more and a wave of jealousy washed over me as that Diggory bloke smiled at Harry and he waved back.
Blaise hung his head ashamed, "I'm sorry, Draco." I glanced away and quickly ran to my room that I shared with no one. As soon as I closed the door, I slid down the wall and hugged my legs. Hiding my face on my knees, I realized that I must've been crying. Because my knees were suddenly soaked.
"Potter...please. Just give it back," Draco pleaded desperately as Harry started unfolding the letter. Harry just looked up at him through his thick eyelashes and smirked. Draco panicked and started thinking of all the ways he could rid Potter of the parchment.
Unfortunately for Draco, Harry had completely unfolded the parchment and his eyes looked at the first sentence.
I blinked, feeling a little confused. She stuck her hand out, "Pansy Parkinson, you must be Draco Malfoy." I frowned and nodded, reluctantly extending my own hand.
Draco reluctantly finished walking down the stairs and stopped behind the couch that Pansy sat on. He observed his surroundings. Crabbe and Goyle sat side by side on giant green beanbags, Blaise and Millicent sat on the love seat together, but not touching, and Tracy Davis and Daphne Greengrass were sitting on the floor in front of the fireplace. Draco quirked a brow in suspicion.
"Yes, may I have the gummy snake and the chocolate frog?" I asked, holding out 1 galleon. She nodded, grabbed the money and handed me the treats. "Will that be all?" Crabbe and Goyle both ordered at least 3 galleons worth of candy. No wonder they were so chubby, although I'd never say that to their faces.
The third task was in a few days. I couldn't sleep or breathe. I felt like a pair of eyes was always watching me wherever I went. But whenever I'd search for the eyes, I'd find no one. I shook off the feeling and decided to go flying for a while. It was well past curfew, but I didn't care. I grabbed my broom and snuck out of the dorm; Ron's snoring masking any sound of someone leaving.
"Of course, why? You forgot again?" I laughed as he pulled out the textbook. As I was explaining to him in toddler format so he'd understand, I spotted Harry looking at me while talking to Ron. As soon as my eyes met his, he looked away with a red tint to his cheeks.
'No no. I don't want this. I don't like this!' My mind screamed. But he continued his actions and soon his left hand was left holding my wrists while the other slowly inched towards my waistband.
"Nah," he shrugged and then we were by the classroom. He pulled me to the side before we could walk in. He bent down a little and his face got close to mine, making me wobble backwards, the back of my head tapping the cobble wall. Shock filled my body and confusion. My eyes widened at the proximity of us and I looked somewhat up at him. I was feeling uncomfortable. He looked me up and down (not so subtly) and his blue eyes darkened and it made a sharp spike of confusion shoot down my spine.
I'm not gay. He's merely just an attractive guy, right? Yeah, straight guys can think about how attractive another straight guy is.
Before I blacked out, I dreamt that someone's arms were around me and I envisioned raven hair and green eyes.
Pansy just rapped her little knuckles against the door again while sighing really loudly. Finally having enough of her annoying tricks, I rolled out of bed and walked to the door. I threw open the door and just growled, "what."
"I wanted to join that competition. Why did he get to?" I mumbled quietly. I felt Pansy wrap her arms around me. I tensed up but felt myself relaxing a few seconds after. Pansy always knew how to help me calm down. Crabbe and Goyle and a few of my other friends were gathered around a tree. Pansy said that she had to get to Potions, so it was just me and the rest of my idiot friends. I spotted Potter walking down the corridor, so I suddenly had a brilliant idea. I smirked as I climbed up the tree we were all huddled around and brushed my shaggy blonde hair out of my eyes. I saw him make eye contact with everyone looking tired and displeased. I called out,
"Thanks, Pans," I mumbled. And licked my bottom lip as more of the apple ran down my face. Someone else was looking at me and I looked up to see who. I narrowed my eyes until I spotted Potter looking at me. I softened my glare but furrowed my eyebrows in confusion as I saw his dilated pupils looking at my lips and his face flushed a little. His shoulders were also barely heaving up and down. Still noticable that he was out of breath or something.
My smile dropped immediately. I walked back into my bathroom, splashed icy water on my face, brushed my teeth with spearmint toothpaste and started working on my hair. Once it was combed well enough, I got into my robes. Underneath, I just wore a simple green henley and a pair of muggle clothing called "jeans". Stupid nana bought me them, but I grew to like the feeling. I always hid them though because it was embarrassing to wear such vile looking clothing.
"You-you're not angry?" I asked looking around, people were starting to go back to their usual things. She shook her head, smiling.
I immediately shook his hand and failed to conceal the giant grin forming on my face. Little sparks shot up my body as our hands connected. Draco's cold and slightly rough hand met my warm hand.
I shook with anger. Seething, I growled, "What happened?! Y-You attacked me, you bloody git!" I pointed my wand at him and his jaw dropped but then he winced and quickly closed it. Shock was filling my every bone and I could barely feel the bruise forming around my wrists.
I hope one day you'll reciprocate my feelings. Although, I know the chances are low. And I hope one day you'll forgive me for all the stupid bullocks I've done. You didn't deserve any of that.
"Snap out of it, Malfoy!" Harry huffed, his face getting red. Draco blurted something out, "I want to be your friend." Harry blinked and Draco's cheeks heated up in embarrassment. "What?" Harry dumbly asked, not fulling comprehending the words that just flew out of the other boy's mouth.
