“I don’t think so. Thanks, though.”
“Malfoy?”
Then, they took off.
A comfortable silence fell between them, and Draco drank in the moment. There were no expectations, or obligations, or facades; no filling the air with empty conversation just for the sake of noise. Simply existing beside Harry was enough. He concentrated on Harry’s steady breaths as he watched his wireframe glasses reflect the last drops of sunlight before it gently dipped below the horizon. The moon hung low in the distance, barely a sliver against the vastness of the blush colored sky.
“Stocky, I promise you won’t like it,” Harry insisted, placing her on the ground.
I don’t think there’s a single person, besides McWeenie, who wants to be here.”
“I’m not really that hungry,” he said, grimacing at the soup in front of him.
actor. Can you open your eyes for me?” she asked.
“Alright. Have fun!” Hermione said.
“Cróga is probably my favorite thing we’ve done so far,” Oisín said, holding the back door open for everyone as they trekked inside. “You’re one of the first shops to have it, and I’ll admit that I’m rather nervous about how the public likes it.”
Draco sucked in a tight breath, looking up at him. “Really?”
And that was all it took.
“Mate,” Ron began, smirking, “you
“Merlin, someone’s impatient,” Harry said, giving her a brief scratch behind her velvety ears before heading towards the kitchen.
,” Harry said, arching an eyebrow.
“I only need to add one more round of chicken stock, so ten minutes? You don’t have to stay in here if you don’t want to, though,” Harry said.
“Ron bought a magical kitchen mixer,” Harry said.
After thirty more minutes of lounging in bed, Harry knew he needed to get up. Carefully, he detached himself from Stockinette, who flopped sideways as soon as the support of Harry’s head was no longer underneath her. As she let out a high-pitched chirp of surprise, Harry grinned sheepishly at her.
“Yes, it is. I wrote to Hermione saying I wanted to surprise you with something fun, and she suggested going ice skating here. I’ll admit, I don’t know the first thing about ice skating,” Draco said, laughing.
It wasn’t until the fireplace erupted into a gust of bright green flames that Harry felt distracted enough to get ahold of himself.
“I see your Quidditch coordination doesn’t extend to your personal life,” he said, smirking.
“Thank you, Draco,” Harry said, turning the cool glass over in his hands. “I absolutely love it, and it’s going right on my nightstand. Now, for your last present.”
Once goodbyes had been said and Draco had stepped into the Floo, Harry turned around to find both Ron and Hermione staring at him.
“Okay, let’s start with the basics. This,” she said, gesturing to the ball of yarn, “is called a skein of yarn, or simply a skein for short. Skeins tend to get tangled if you don’t wind them into a ball before knitting. However, because this particular brand of yarn came from a craft shop and is on the cheaper end, it’s come prewound. If you were to get, say, a £25 skein of yarn from an established fiber arts shop, you would either need to ask someone at the shop to wind it for you, or you would need to wind it by hand ― which I would not recommend, by the way. Now, yarn comes in a variety of different sizes, textures, and what we call weights. This particular yarn is worsted, which is a medium weight, and it’s made out of wool. Go ahead, pick it up. Tell me how it feels.”
“Merlin, did I say anything else?” Draco asked.
Harry and Hermione exchanged a look, both of them knowing that Draco did, indeed, need help if he had any hope of finishing his scarf.
Stockinette followed him to the door, her paws pitter-pattering across the wood. Harry unlocked the door and was met with a grinning Hermione and a half-asleep Ron.
Harry gasped at the cool air meeting his exposed skin as his clothes vanished, and Malfoy wasted no time in climbing onto the bed and straddling him. Harry’s hips bucked upward slightly, desperate for relief.
Harry scooted closer to the side of the building, slowly taking his hands off of the broom handle before leaning over and shutting the window. Then, he turned to Draco.
Crimson bloomed across Draco’s face, a look of panic in his eyes as he set the poinsettia down on the check-out counter. “Oh Merlin, I’m sorry Potter. I didn’t realize. I can come back tomorrow, if you’d like.”
As he and Draco wandered down the steps that led into the back garden, both of their wands alight, he looked around in awe. In the near left corner sat several of what could only be described as enormous Venus flytraps. Their stalks towered at least two feet taller than Harry, and their light green heads were dotted with large purple spots. They were bumping into each other in the bitterly cold wind, causing them to snap at each other upon every impact.
“Good choice, Ted,” Harry said, ruffling the boy’s soft curls.
“I don’t! It’s just that, well … we always get an earful about him every time we talk to you,” Ron said.
After a little while, Harry walked into the room. Draco clenched his jaw as he took in the familiar sight — a loose T-shirt, a pair of jean shorts that fell just above his knees, black curls that were kept a little shorter for the summer months, that soft smile of his that made Draco’s heart ache terribly.
“Take your time!”
Turning towards Draco, Harry smiled. “Food’s here.”
“Butterbeer, I think,” Draco said.
Harry nodded, looking in Ron and Hermione’s direction. “Are you two ready?”
“Oi!” Ron shouted. “You were supposed to be at Andromeda’s for dinner!”
Draco nodded. “Good.”
“Not to toot your own horn.”
Ron nodded. “Yeah, that’s right. All of the Aurors have been invited, and I think Hermione and I are planning on going."
“Oh,” Harry said bluntly. “Right. Well, do you have someplace in mind for flying?”
After another forty minutes, Draco checked his watch and let out a sigh. “I should probably get going. I promised I’d help my mother with inventory tonight."
To everyone who's commented saying that crafting/knitting/crocheting is what gets you through your own mental health issues, I can't describe how beyond grateful I am to have been able to share a fic that mirrors your experience. To everyone who's taken an interest in knitting or crafting since having posted this story, I'm thrilled for you! I can't knit to save my life, but I do see the joy that it brings my wife and hope you're able to experience the same thing. And lastly, for anyone who read this just because, thank you from the bottom of my heart for taking a leap on such a weird post-war drarry fic.
“Alright, are you ready to get going?” Harry asked.
As Harry opened his mouth to respond, Draco turned around, parting his way through the crowd. Shrugging to himself, Harry continued on, eventually spotting Ron and Hermione through the clusters of wixen. Hermione was in the midst of stuffing shrunken down wrapped items into her handbag, which Ron was holding open. As Harry approached, Ron looked up and frowned.
Draco sighed heavily. “It’s hard living with myself sometimes.”
“Already spending the night together, are we?” Hermione asked, smirking.
Draco blinked, taking it in. “Oh.”
Realizing that his gelato had melted slightly, he began to do some cone management, licking along the sides until he’d formed a perfectly smooth dome. He tried desperately to ignore the soft sounds of Malfoy breathing beside him as he looked out onto the beach, watching the bright blue water lap at the shore.
“Malfoy?”
looking blond hair, and his eyes are a deep grey ―”
Trudging back through the shop and onto the ladder, Harry let out a long sigh, willing Draco to get here soon.
Draco stared back.
Thankfully, Crookshanks gave a single sniff before wandering down the hall that led to their bedroom. Stockinette took this as her cue to curl up on the couch’s right arm.
Glancing at one of the cubby holes filled with fingering yarn, he stood up and wandered over to it. He’d seen a new beanie pattern floating around the knitting community that he was dying to try out. It was called Grá, and it was made of stranded colorwork, creating rows of flowers, leaves, and diamonds around the beanie. He knew he’d need three skeins for it, so he began to poke and prod his way through the neatly stacked skeins, searching for colors that would suit Draco.
“Since everyone knows that Draco and I are officially together,” Harry began, anxiously shifting his weight from one foot to the other, “I thought that Christmas would be a good excuse to get everyone together, even if it’s for an hour or two at most.”
Draco skeptically raised an eyebrow. “Not particularly. Why?”
good.”
“Okay, I’m ready,” he said.
Draco was looking around, his eyes finally landing on Harry. They exchanged a brief smile, and Harry beckoned him inside. As Draco entered the shop, the small bell above the door went off, and Harry sighed with content at the fact that he had stopped by for a visit.
in faded, light green print. He let out a sigh of relief, having found it.
Harry blinked. “What?”
After pouring a moderate amount of kibble into Stockinette’s food bowl and setting it on the ground, Harry went about making his own breakfast. While waiting for his coffee to percolate, he quickly whipped up an omelette stuffed with bell peppers and shredded cheese. Once his cup of coffee had been made, four teaspoons of sugar and a generous amount of milk, he took a seat at the round kitchen table.
Before he knew it, their clothes had been vanished and he was being dragged by Draco down the hallway and into his bedroom, where Stockinette was stretched out on the windowsill in a patch of pale sun. Somewhere along the way, Harry had lost his glasses, but he didn’t particularly care; he had far bigger things needing taken care of. He was pushed backward onto the bed, and Draco quickly followed, leaving a trail of kisses down his neck and along his jaw. Harry felt drunk on the softness of Draco’s skin, as though no matter what, he couldn’t possibly have enough.
As always, thank you all so much for your endless love and support on TWWW <3
Harry cleared his throat. “Hey, you two.”
“Actually yeah,” Harry said, handing him the liquid glass measuring cup. “Could you reheat the chicken stock in the microwave for a minute?”
, though?” Draco whispered through gritted teeth. “What the fuck were you thinking? Where did you even
“Well,” Ron said, standing up, “I should probably go make sure that the spoon I charmed is still stirring the stir fry. I’ll be right back.”
above the shop?” he asked, looking around.
“Separate, please,” Harry said, fishing money out of his wallet as Draco did the same.
“I was attacked by one when I was a child. And, quite frankly, I don’t trust their rectangular pupils,” Draco said, frowning.
Andromeda laughed, straightening the hem of his jumper. “Yes, I see that. You look very dashing.”
Harry grinned widely in response as he looked at Draco, who was dressed particularly well tonight. Wearing a knitted charcoal turtleneck and light grey trousers that fit him perfectly, Harry swore that the sight of Draco was leaving him dizzy.
Draco raised his wand, a soft white glow forming at the tip as all of the snow flurries in the air were sucked back into it, leaving the shop pristine and snowflake-free.
“Oh, God, Harry. Oh,
Harry sucked in a sharp breath, not having expected such a steep price, but paid it nonetheless. He’d pay anything to see the smile that he knew would appear on Molly’s face when she saw the bouquet.
The store was packed with witches and wizards alike, many of them beginning their Christmas shopping and others simply looking for themselves. Harry and Hermione were slammed with helping customers pick out yarn, making needle recommendations, and pointing them to the pattern book that would fill their every need, while Ron manned the check-out counter along with Stockinette, who was curled into a lazy half-crescent.
Harry wandered over to the other side of the table, standing only a mere few inches from Draco. He could smell his aftershave, pine and citrus, and all logical thoughts quickly left his mind.
“Well, that’s never a good thing. What is it, mate?” Ron asked.
Malfoy awkwardly cleared his throat, moving to his position behind the counter. He was clad in a charcoal colored turtleneck and, Harry was quite startled to see, blue jeans. On top of the turtleneck laid a forest green apron with the shop’s name embroidered in loopy gold letters on the chest.
McWeenie pulled a crumpled sheet of parchment from his pocket and held it up. “Here we are! Quiet, now! I’m going to begin reading the pairs off. Penelope Clearwater and Marina Sanchez! Rowan Khanna and Chester Davies! Hermione Granger and Susan Bones!”
Off in the distance the sun continued to set, slowly sinking behind the hills as they approached a familiar stretch of road. It was surrounded by fields of golden wheat on either side. Draco liked this particular area; no matter what season it was, the fields always had something to offer.
After a few more rounds of pacing, Harry let out a heavy sigh and ducked into the bathroom in the hall. There, he fidgeted with the hem of what he considered to be his nicest jumper. It had been knitted out of bulky, garnet colored targhee-Columbia wool, and the white yoke of the sweater was Nordic in design. He’d made the jumper for the grand opening of the Whomping Willow Woolery a year ago, and he’d been astounded at the amount of compliments he’d managed to receive on it. Even Hermione had said that it was his best work yet, and he couldn’t help but agree.
fit …”
“Okay. Are you … are you sure you want to start another project?” Harry asked.
“I don’t,” Harry quickly said. “In fact, I think you’re rather
you did.”
can do,” Harry said. “I take it you’re looking to use worsted yarn?”
“Hey,” Harry said softly, placing his hand gently over Draco’s, “it’s okay. You explained that you were busy, and that’s all that matters.”
After they paid for their books, they wandered back out into the glacial afternoon. Diagon Alley was more crowded than it had been when they’d first begun their roaming, the street bustling with magical folk anxious to get into the warmth of the shops.
Stockinette swished her tail in response, and her bright blue eyes narrowed at Harry.
“Me too,” Draco said, briefly lifting Stockinette off his lap so he could readjust his position. “It was my nickname as a child. I think it reminds her of happier times.”
Draco continued to pump himself through the flood of ecstasy until his cock was sore and softening. Beneath him, Potter’s thighs were beginning to tremble, and his thrusts grew more rapid.
As he munched on a package of pretzels that he’d stored in the checkout counter, he found himself staring at the clock, counting the hours until he’d see Teddy and Andromeda.
“There must have been some sort of mistake, Sir —” Harry began, but he was promptly cut off by Malfoy.
“Said he had to go back and get something. I see you were successful,” Harry said through a snort as he nodded in the direction of Hermione’s bag.
After hopping on his train, he arrived at his stop thirty minutes later. Weaving his way in between clusters of people on the platform, he made his way up the stairs and onto the street, turning right. Down the road a little ways, he could make out a wooden sign jutting out from one of the shops up ahead, reading
With a half-escaped moan, Harry came, his orgasm ripping through his body. Winded, he stood motionless. It wasn’t until Draco’s mouth popped off of the tip and he stood up that Harry opened his eyes, well aware that his cheeks were burning with both lust and embarrassment.
Draco rolled his eyes, shoving Harry lightly on the shoulder. “Fuck off. Now, where’s my breakfast?”
At this, a crimson flush bloomed across Draco’s cheeks, and he waved a hand dismissively in the air. “Oh, for like a month. Just long enough for her to be my date to the Yule Ball.”
know that, but
“Feels like a long time coming, doesn’t it?” Harry asked.
The scar that cracked across his forehead, raised white lines that stood out against his golden brown skin and ran from his right temple to his left cheekbone, had faded drastically since the defeat of Voldemort. The jagged cuts no longer looked angry, but instead as though they were finally beginning to soften into the background. And while Harry wasn’t ashamed of his scar ― he couldn’t possibly forget all that it meant ― he had found that keeping his black curls slightly longer, his fringe grazing just above his eyebrows, helped to diminish unwanted stares from strangers. Plus, a Disillusionment Charm on his scar never hurt.
“Well, to create ribbing you use a knit stitch and a purl stitch, which is just another basic stitch. Sometimes the pattern will say ‘knit one, purl one,’ and other times, like with the neckline of my jumper, it’ll tell you to ‘knit two, purl two.’ I’ll teach you how to purl as soon as you finish your scarf,” Harry said.
Teddy nodded. “Yeah! I brought him to school yesterday, and all my friends wanted to play with him.”
Harry spent the next six hours listening to Hermione as she taught him how to knit, starting with the cast on and ending with how to make a simple knit stitch. The night was pitch black by the time Ron and Hermione left.
Draco was standing by the door, a project bag’s handle looped around his slender left wrist. He looked nervous, fidgeting with the hem of his black wool peacoat, which was fitted nicely over a beige turtleneck jumper.
Well, that wasn’t entirely
were spelled out in golden letters. The outside of Brown Thomas, a nice department store, was covered in a thick blanket of green leaves that were studded with Christmas lights. Its windows were lit up with Christmas displays, and a small crowd had stopped to admire them.
The journey to Wiltshire was full of bitter gusts of winds and stars twinkling above in the deep black sky. Harry’s gloved fingers were going numb, and no matter how many times he blinked, his eyes refused to stop watering. He had to admit that the ride was beautiful, though. Inner city busyness had quickly dissolved into quiet neighborhoods and eventually empty country roads that gave way to expansive fields, forests, and streams.
“Good.”
Harry, who was mid drink of water, sucked it down his windpipe and began to cough. “I―I’m sorry?”
I think that they are absolutely horrid creatures.”
“What’s it like?”
“Bloody fantastic,” Harry said, letting out a bark of laughter. “You?”
“Now, or when I was a child?” Draco asked.
Harry rolled his eyes. “I had to deal with that from you and Hermione for years.”
“Stroke of luck,” Draco said nonchalantly, shrugging his shoulders.
Harry nodded, his heart twisting. “Yeah, of course.”
After everything had been turned on and Hermione had raised the shades in the front windows, the three of them went about quickly organizing the large cubby holes lining four of the six walls forming the shop’s hexagon shape, all of them filled to the brim with various types of yarns. On the fifth wall sat racks upon racks of knitting needles and crochet hooks, as well as cords, felting needles, and cloth project bags. Around the shop, sample knits of scarves, shawls, jumpers, and hats were levitating on display, as well as several yarn winders magically spinning on their own. Towards the back, where the check-out counter sat, were a few bookcases pushed against the sixth wall, fiber arts magazines and pattern books written by renowned crafters neatly lining them.
“I —”
“Well,” Andromeda said, pausing to blow her nose before saying, “people sometimes hurt on the inside, like when they get their feelings hurt or miss someone a lot. It’s like having an ouchie on your heart.”
“Pot roast?”
After a moment of contemplation, Draco nodded. “Did you make this?”
“Alright?” Harry asked.
“Hey, Harry! How’s it going, mate?” Ron asked as Harry took a seat next to him.
Ron let out a long sigh. “Oh, fantastic. Training was great today. All of us shadowed an Auror for five hours as they worked on their cases, and it was bloody amazing. My Auror, Claire Parkins, she’s been working on trying to catch a dragon egg smuggler. I got to watch as she planned out a sting that’s taking place on Tuesday. Merlin, it was such a rush.”
As Harry slid into his chair, Andromeda let out a heavy sigh. Looking up, he realized just how worn she was.
“Ah,” Pansy said, smirking as she shoved the vial back into her handbag. “Now you understand.”
Harry shrugged. “To watch the sunset. I don’t want to go home quite yet.”
Draco shrugged. “Don’t be. I don’t blame them. I made some really poor choices when I was younger that I deeply regret, and if hating me makes people feel better, then so be it.”
Love,
“Ready?”
“Save it, Potter.”
. “— I don’t.”
Harry shrugged. “Surprise me.”
“No harm done,” Draco said dismissively. “Harry and I know each other from Hogwarts. We were in the same year, although we’ve only recently become friends. Where did you go to school?”
Harry recoiled at the venom in his voice before steadying himself. “That’s not true, Malfoy. I can see that you’re doing everything you can to move on from who you were as a child, and I know that you wish you could undo things. I saw you apologize to Hermione and Ron, remember? If you hadn’t changed, you wouldn’t have explained to them how sorry you are.”
“That makes sense. Do you need to go?” Harry asked.
Harry chuckled. “I understand. Well ―”
Hermione rolled her eyes. “Ron insisted that we buy a magical kitchen mixer. I’m not quite sure why, as the charmed KitchenAid we have at home is
Two hours later, they were woken abruptly by the sound of McWeenie’s loud, obnoxiously enhanced voice echoing across the camp, calling everyone to the fire pit immediately. After scrambling to look as though they had, indeed,
Harry nodded curtly. “A date. You’re rather fit, you know.”
With a sigh, Harry nodded. “I’ll try.”
“Malfoy,” Harry immediately answered, which earned him a dirty look.
“Slow down, ‘Mione. Don’t want to scare the bloke off,” Ron said, wandering in from the kitchen with a tea towel thrown over his flannel-clad shoulder.
Draco snorted as he took his plate. “That’s a fat lie.”
“Mother recently told me that decorative cauldrons have become all the rage lately. Personally, I don’t see the appeal. Why would one purchase a cauldron only for it to sit and collect dust?”
“Okay, how in the hell did you purchase this? I didn’t see you go back to buy it at the fair,” Draco asked.
Harry nodded. “That’d be great. I’ve been dying to see your new collection.”
Absently tracing the stem of her wine glass with the tip of her index finger, Andromeda said, “it’s difficult to imagine a softer version of Draco. Even as a young child, he had a fierce temper and an even fiercer allegiance to his parents.”
“Um, yes. I did,” Harry said.
Draco raised a skeptical eyebrow. “Yes?”
Five minutes later, he slung his satchel over his shoulder and picked up a protesting Stockinette before making his way down the stairs and into the back room of the shop. Then, he went about setting everything up as quickly as possible, opening the front blinds, unlocking the door, turning on the Christmas tree and toy train, casting the Snowfall Charm in the front window, and putting on holiday tracks that began with Andy Williams’
"One wrong won't make any right either, will it?" said Harry.
"Do you think I wanted this?" Harry asked.
"So, have you thought about it?" There was a mocking tone in Harry's voice. After all, they both knew that viewing the situation as some form of choice was a joke. Harry put the tea in front of the sitting man who was steadfastly looking at the table. His hair hung lank, hiding his entire face from Harry. His posture, which used to be straight and proud, was hunched.
He felt so dirty, tainted, like having grime all over his skin that he couldn't rub out with any potion.
"I won't do it."
"Look, you know that I have been skirting on the legal line to pass our proposals. You know that it was necessary."
"And why exactly should I care? Did the Death Eaters care about destroying innocent people's lives?"
"Pride won't help my family," he answered quietly.
Harry didn't know whether he should sigh or scream in frustration. When he was hunting Horcruxes and fighting Death Eaters, it had never entered his mind that one day there would be an entire generation to whom Voldemort was nothing more than a bogey man, a myth.
For the first time since Harry could remember, he greeted the other man cordially.
The coldness of her words fed his anger.
Hermione had been loitering around Number 12 Grimmauld Place for half an hour, Polyjuiced as a punk girl, when she saw a man approaching the house. Casually, to avoid attracting attention, she walked nearer and hid behind the black car on the neighboring house's lawn.
"Where are the kids?" Hermione asked, looking around.
He could try to find work in Muggle London, he supposed, but he knew nothing about Muggles. He'd had none of their education, and couldn't even operate most of their devices.
No, he knew the law would do nothing to help kids like Scorpius. On the contrary, letting people put ex-Death Eaters away without a fair trial, both for real and imaginary offences would leave his son practically an orphan.
Hermione brought her hands to her mouth, trying to stifle her gasp.
"And what about Draco, Harry? You've forced him into prostitution!"
"Good. I will tell him to come to Grimmauld at midnight tomorrow. You got twenty-four hours, the usual rules."
Harry loved the sofa he sat on. It was beige, and comfortable, and modest, and most importantly, they had chosen it together, he and Ginny, when they first moved into Godrics Hollow. He remembered them hopping from shop to shop, looking for new furniture to decorate their equally new home. Harry never knew shopping could be so much fun before that day.
Besides, there was something about sleeping with Harry afterward. It made him feel cleaner than taking a bath.
"Maybe someday," Harry said, smiled and turned around. Draco felt the familiar pain throbbed again. It was stupid, stupid to hope.
He didn't understand. It was not the first time she was looking for him at the office, even if they both preferred to talk at his house. Moreover, he could safely say that that he hadn't seen her at all, so she couldn't be annoyed because of something that he had done. Or was it possible that she was upset because she couldn't find him?
"But it made you just the same as them, Harry."
"Hello, Harry."
"I need money. You know that, Potter."
Fear crept into Harry's heart. Did that mean Hermione knew about the method he employed to pass their proposals?
"You must be the one who taught them to think of me as an old fool." The accusation sounded silly once it left his mouth.
They courted him and kept tabs on his every movement.
Scorpius didn't answer, though. He just continued hiding his face in Draco's robe, heaving and sobbing.
Someday was a word of promise, spoken in the stolen times on Harry’s cramped, dimly-lit bedroom at Grimmauld, with Harry’s arms around Draco’s torso while Draco was trying in vain to bury his back deeper into Harry’s chest.
That realization shocked him. He couldn't believe it. After all, he never gave any reason for Malfoy to feel that way towards him. Or maybe, maybe Malfoy had nurtured the crush before Harry offered him the job?
When something caught her attention, Hermione could become so animated, hands moving and face glowing.
"I just got the news. They will present it for voting when the Wizengamot convenes."
"You have faith," Dumbledore corrected.
"My idea? My idea?"
"Why did you come, Hermione? Not that you have to have a reason to do so, you know," he said with a weak smile.
Even remembering it was enough to rouse his anger and self-loathing once again. He couldn't protect her, couldn't even give her justice.
Ex-Death Eaters like him, a voice in his mind reminded him.
The question was merely a formality, they both knew that. Draco had been briefed by the healers about her condition.
"Still, it is not like Harry is putting you at wand point."
"I thought you were all for justice," Draco said bitterly.
"Speak English, Potter."
"You know, I wonder, why do you sleep with me? After all, I don't pay you for that, do I?"
"So, are you implying that I am happy with this situation? Or that I am lying? Maybe I should have said who would want to help me? "
So, they visited Hogwarts now and then and Flooed unexpectedly. It was always the same pattern. They would word their questions carefully and skillfully, as if they were interested on his opinions or in the young wizards and witches education at Hogwarts, while at the same time nosing around for proof, or indeed any indication that he had any intentions to follow in Voldemort's footsteps.
"Absolutely, Mr. Potter."
Draco sighed inwardly. To be honest, he had been afraid of this. Kids, he knew just all too well, could be cruel, crueller than any adult in their ignorance. After all, hadn't he been a bully once?
Either that or he was making his own government and obliterating the Ministry. A feat that had become more and more tempting with every visit they had made.
There was a taunt in Harry's voice and a look of conviction on his face.
Yes, he was happy. In fact, just that morning he felt ecstatic when he realized that the proposal had passed.
It was warm inside, and Draco knew that Harry must have sent his children to the Burrow. Harry would have known that Draco would come that night.
Scorpius lifted his head from Draco's chest and shook his head resolutely.
He closed his eyes for a moment, taking a breath.
"And separating them from their family? Killing their parents?"
Yet, they were holding his parents’ lives as hostages. It was becoming a traitor or an orphan and there really was not a choice as far as Draco concerned.
He grabbed Draco's chin with his right hand, forcing him to look into Harry's eyes. Then, Harry smirked.
A small part of Draco gave a gleeful smirk on seeing her flabbergasted expression. Her eyes had become comically big and for a moment, she forgot to close her mouth.
"Don't change the topic, Malfoy." There was a note of warning on her voice.
He had lost so much. How could Harry ask him to sacrifice his family?
Harry sighed.
-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-
-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.--.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-
When he didn't hear her reply, he looked up at her.
An hour after that, he had argued Draco Malfoy's case with the conviction of the newly converted to Minerva. Two hours later, Hogwarts had gotten a new Potion's professor. The next day, Harry had begun to rue that and questioning his sanity.
It was a familiar phrase. Yet, there was anger behind them then, instead of the petulant whine of his Hogwarts days.
Precisely when the clock struck ten, the alarm he had placed on his fireplace to inform him of an incoming guest chimed.
"Listen to me. I know that you were devastated by Ginny's death, but this is not you, Harry."
Ginny Weasley was looking up to Potter with adoration, clearly eating up every word coming out of Potter’s mouth. She laughed and held Potter’s hand and Draco never hated her more because it should be him there with Potter.
After all, you could never really ever go home again, as that Muggle author said.
As a son, he was a failure. As a husband, according to his ex-wife, he was also a failure. So why was he surprised that as a father he was nothing but a failure, too?
She didn't say anything and for a moment he pitied her -- her and her feeble attempt to save her rose-tinted world. The moment passed quickly, though.
She refused to back down, to move. Instead, she stood up as well and glared at him.
Harry knew that if only he could make Hermione somehow understand why he did it, he would have an irreplaceable ally in her. He knew it wouldn't be easy, though.
Someday was a word of hope, whispered by familiar voice, filled with unsaid promise of better time to come soon.
"Sometimes I felt like I don't know you anymore, Harry," she said, standing in front of him.
"And I am grateful for Tinky. But you know that house-elves are inherited, don't you? Just like this Manor?"
Draco lifted one of his eyebrows in response to this strange statement. He couldn't remember a time when he refused his own father's offers either to smoothen his way or clean up his mess.
Draco took a deep breath and tried to set his gloomy mood aside. His mother could still read him as well as ever and the last thing he wanted to do was to make her worry. Pasting a smile on his face, he greeted her.
Someone, Harry thought, should tell Malfoy that he was an utter failure as a liar, with that smirk of his playing on his lips.
Scratch that. He had planned to sleep until dinnertime.
"I heard you had a fight with Miss Granger this evening," the ex-headmaster said when Harry sat beside him.
"You are satisfied; you feel you have outdone your opponents. It's different than being happy,"
Ginny. She had been so young, so happy. She wore her hair in a ponytail in those days and Harry loved to play with it while she rested her head on his shoulder.
She should know that voice. She was sure she had heard it before, but she couldn't place it.
"No longer a proud Pureblood, are you, Malfoy?"
And she wouldn't, would she? They all were so righteous, the so-called-Light-Side, so quick to point fingers, except of course, at themselves.
“Not with thousands of Weasleys and a bunch of Gryffindors also living under the same roof,” he said instead. Honestly, rather than living together, their current arrangement was more like living in the dorm.
Even after years, the memories of Fenrir and how the Werewolves sided with Voldemort were still fresh in some people's mind, Harry guessed. People wanted the Ministry to put away all Werewolves, dangerous or not. And the Ministry, trying to protect their own interests like usual, caved. To no avail Harry argued against it, citing Lupin as example.
"What did they say?"
-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.--.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-
A year ago, when Harry approached her with a plan to change the Ministry, a plan that she swore she would not tell Ron about - not that they didn't trust him, but with most of his family working at the Ministry, it was too risky and too dangerous for him to be involved with plans that were barely legal - she had thought that he would use his influence as the Boy Who Lived. After all, he had a lot of clout these days.
"He brought this upon himself." His voice was clipped and his eyes were hard.
He had enjoyed it for sure, but he had always categorized their time together as sex and only sex. Why should he spend more time in foreplay and seduction? After all, Malfoy was a sure thing, and as long as the act was done, he was satisfied.
Silently, he followed Harry to his bedroom.
"You have to learn to accept that you can't change everything, Harry, and you need to learn to open your heart to love again. You will be surprised," the older man said, as if he could read Harry's mind. Then again, since he was Harry's imagination, maybe he could.
He was also nervous if his words were any indication. Or maybe he was afraid. After their last encounter, Harry couldn't say he blamed him.
"And you are saying that you didn't try to sway her to your cause, to make her hate me? Surely you know how easily she is influenced into defending what she sees as the poor and defenceless, regardless of whether they deserve it or not!" Harry practically spat the last sentence. "Tell me Malfoy, why the hell do you work for me?"
Well, there was a new improvement on the Wizengamot front. Rumour had it that the Greengrasses had agreed to support the proposal. She wanted to ask Harry whether he had something to do with this and to discuss their next strategy with him.
Suddenly, Draco felt angry. How could she demand him to tell her what his game was? How dare she come uninvited into his house, throwing accusations at him!
Draco couldn't believe his own ears. She was supposed to be the smartest witch of their year! Moreover, Harry was her best friend and Draco knew for a fact that some of the proposals Harry tried to push through were hers. Couldn't she put one and one together and came up with two?
-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-

"I can't do it. If it makes you throw my mother out of St. Mungo, then so be it. I know I need the money, but I became your whore for my family. How can I do something that clearly will destroy them? People hate my family. The new law you proposed will give them opportunity to put my family in Azkaban, even on the basis of some imaginary offense."
"Yes, nobody else wants you, Malfoy. After all, you just have one skill, don't you? And it is to open your legs for everyone who pays."
-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-
Walking around the table to the blond's side, Harry bent down and captured Malfoy's pointy chin in his fingers. He waited until Malfoy's gaze turned to him before he spoke.
Still, she couldn't shake the conversation from her mind.
There was no answer. Harry thought it was discouraging that Dumbledore, or his imagination, couldn't provide any guarantee about it.
"I had thought, once, that after Voldemort was defeated, everything would be all right. Surely the Purebloods would see that blood doesn't matter. Surely the Ministry, purged of Voldemort and his follower's influence, would be a better, fairer institution. I was stupid."
Draco. So this was his doing. He had somehow convinced Hermione and turned her against Harry.
Still, Dumbledore, Harry decided, must be barmy. How could he even begin to compare Ginny with Malfoy? Besides, there was no way he could love Malfoy, not even if he wanted to, which he didn't.
"Do you think Draco wanted this?"
This time, she was the one who was silent. There was no confirmation needed. They both knew that the Wizengamot was filled with old, bigoted, cowardly, rigid purebloods. Worse, most of them were related to one another, by marriage and blood.
"Just take it easy, okay?" Draco smiled and took Narcissa's frail hand in his own. Then impulsively he added, "Don't worry, I'll take care of everything,"
His action, he took note, irritated her further.
As a son, he was a failure. As a husband, according to his ex-wife, he was also a failure. So why was he surprised that as a father he was nothing but a failure, too?
-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.--.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-
"Like I said, you have been looking up for too long, Granger. Do you know how people treat ex-Death Eaters these days? Do you know that my mother was hexed by one of your so-called-Light supporters? She was shopping in Diagon Alley, you know. She disturbed no one. They just came and hexed her and your beloved ministry wouldn't even bestow sufficient effort to investigate it."
It made him cold inside, to know that she knew what he was, but he refused to show her that. His pride, battered and tattered as it was, apparently was still alive.
When Neville - after the birth of his first son - had retired so he could spend more time with his family, the position had been left empty. Having replaced Minerva at that time, Harry, in his second year as Headmaster, had called for a meeting, and a vote, for Neville's substitute.
Harry rubbed his eyes; they were grainy and burned when he blinked. Every time Lily had the nightmare, he ended up with his own sleepless night. The Healers at St. Mungos had said that it was normal for kids to have nightmares about traumatic events in their lives. Kids have great imaginations, and sometimes they could imagine scarier scenarios than what had actually happened. Still, it shouldn't last for two years, should it?
"Like I said before Malfoy, you have no choice."
Narcissa lifted her face from the book she was reading and upon seeing who her visitor was, smiled.
But not before Harry caught the look in his eyes. The grey orbs looked dejected and Harry realized that they had often looked sad, but he had never noticed before.
"He is well compensated, isn't he? I pay him more than enough for his service."
The selection was a joke, really. All the proposals had to be examined first by a special committee, supposedly to save the Wizengamot's time. Only those that were deemed suitable would be presented to said Wizengamot. Yet, what was the use of perusing the proposal first, if there was no guarantee it would be accepted anyway? Moreover, what was the use of pretending to consider it, if most of the time the decision had been made in advance?
There was sympathy in her voice, mixed with sadness and understanding. Harry hated pity, but it was different with Hermione and Ron. After all, it was their loss as well.
After giving her a quick kiss on the head, Harry threw on a cardigan he’d knit out of worsted grey wool a few years back over his maroon reindeer pajamas. Then, once he’d shuffled into his slippers, he lifted his wand from the nightstand and went about sending Draco a Patronus message.
“Oh,” Harry said lamely, his mind churning. “In that case, how would you feel about dinner sometime this week?”
Harry quirked an eyebrow. “Well, who are you making it for?”
Before anything more could be said, a sharp tapping pierced the air. Looking towards the living room window, Harry could barely make out the silhouette of an owl carrying a shrunken brown paper bag.
“Boyfriend?” he asked. “Are you … gay?”
Harry grinned at the usage of his surname.
Draco looked back once again, eyebrow raised. “What are you doing, Potter?”
Without waiting for Draco to respond, Harry locked up, gathered his things, and headed up the stairs. Draco followed silently. Once they made it into Harry’s flat, Draco let out a soft gasp.
“Actually, I think there’s something I’d like to go back and quickly buy.”
“Can I help you, Potter?” he asked.
, and that’s fine. I’ll heat up the stock if you stir the risotto, then.”
“Yes. Do they … look nice together?” Draco asked.
“Harry,” Draco whispered, “is this okay?"
Next to him, Stockinette was perched on top of the dresser, busying herself by meticulously cleaning her paws. Harry gave her a scratch behind her ears, which earned him a gentle head-butt that signaled a request for more.
It had been six days since they’d kissed, and Harry hadn’t heard a word since. He’d been so sure that their time together had ended on a positive note, as Draco has given Harry a sleepy peck before stepping into the Floo after he’d woken up from his accidental nap. However, with the awkward radio silence that had since ensued, he was no longer so sure that things were alright between them. When he’d confided in Hermione and Ron about the predicament, they’d assured him that Draco probably just wanted to take things slow. Unfortunately, this did little to ease Harry’s worries.
, Harry,” Draco stuffed his hand into his coat pocket before pulling out a small, golden sphere. “I’ll let it go on the count of three. Ready?”
Draco nodded, a bright smile appearing. “Boyfriends sound good to me.”
Everyone paused, Teddy’s unexpected curse filling the air.
“A shag?” Draco snorted. “I need a bloke for that.”
Harry and Draco were led into a relatively small room in the back of the house, which was filled to the brim with large cardboard boxes. Laoise pulled down two boxes from the top of a stack in the right corner of the room, plopping them down in front of Harry and opening the flaps. Inside were several dye lots of different colored fingering yarn. All of the skeins were rich in color, ranging from deep forest green to a light seafoam, and they contained white and grey speckles. Another color that jumped out at him was a burnt orange, its smokiness making it pop against the rest of the skeins.
“Shit,” Harry murmured to himself.
“Sure. So, do you want to set a formal schedule for your lessons, or do you want to just come by whenever you’re feeling like it?” Harry asked.
“It’s fine, Potter,” Draco snapped before sighing, pinching the bridge of his nose. “We just come from two very different worlds, is all.”
“Of course. Follow me,” Harry said.
Harry let out a heavy sigh. “Right. Well, thank you. What time should I come over?”
Harry, who was at the front of the group, looked back and nodded. “Alright. Here goes nothing.”
Andromeda let out a short laugh, ruffling his hair. “That’s true, sweetheart.”
“I just don’t understand how I haven’t seen it before …” Harry said, his voice trailing off as he flicked through his assorted memories of running into Malfoy in various parts of the Ministry.
Quickly opening the envelope and unfolding the parchment, he began to read.
“I’m so sorry, Andy. Did you see Draco and Narcissa often?” Harry asked.
Draco immediately walked to the front window display. There, suspended in mid air, was the sleekest broom Harry had ever seen. The walnut colored wood was polished to the point where Harry could see his reflection in it, and the bristles that made up the tail end of the broom were neatly arranged to a point.
The crunching of twigs interrupted his thoughts. He expected to see Hermione as he glanced over his shoulder, but he couldn’t have been more wrong.
“Why not? Might as well get caught up, especially if you expect me to divulge all of my top secret knitting hacks,” Harry said, grinning.
He let out a heavy sigh, closing his eyes as he leaned back against the headrest. For a moment, he could pretend that things were how he wanted them to be — long kisses, and sweaty hand-holding. Laughing until they couldn’t breathe, and looking at each other like they were the only people in the world.
Harry couldn’t help but laugh at the berate of questions, racking his brain for ways to tell the truth without outright lying. “Yeah, he’s around my age, and he’s taller than me by about three inches. He’s got the
Harry sighed. “I’m sorry you had such a tough time during our later years at Hogwarts.”
It was a familiar phrase. Yet, there was anger behind them then, instead of the petulant whine of his Hogwarts days.
He tried to appeal to her common sense once more, but she just looked at him with the look that he hated: the one that said she was disappointed but felt hopeless to change anything.
Malfoy lifted his face and looked up. Harry thought that Malfoy's eyes looked like a brewing storm and if he were to concentrate, Harry fancied seeing all the sorrow, anger and hate swirling in their gray orbs.
Only after that, did he pick up his book, sit back, and try to restrain himself from looking at the clock every five minutes.
Harry was no stranger to dreams, especially nightmares. He categorized his nightmares into three different groups: memories induced, reflection of impossible hopes, and Voldemort's hand-me-downs. So, when he found himself on King Cross just as soon as he felt asleep, he was not surprised.
Not that Draco thought he did not deserve Harry’s anger. He had, after all, told the Death Eaters about the Order’s plan for rescuing the Muggleborns wizard and witches that had been captured. The order had taken him in and given him refuge and he had betrayed their trust. Worse, he had betrayed Harry’s trust.
Dumbledore turned and looked Harry in the eye.
Again, there was no answer, except a tightening of Scorpius' hold on his clothes.
Unfortunately, if the look on Malfoy's face was any indication, he just achieved the opposite. Too late Harry realized that he never smiled at the other man. Malfoy probably thought it was some kind of a trap. Or worse, that, after knowing his feelings, Harry was mocking him.
"Hush, listen. I am not saying that I love you. I am not promising that I will. But, I want to try."
This time, she was the one who was silent. There was no confirmation needed. They both knew that the Wizengamot was filled with old, bigoted, cowardly, rigid purebloods. Worse, most of them were related to one another, by marriage and blood.
Why was it so difficult to say that word? He had said it a million times before. Hell, he had called Draco worse than that many times.
Harry was, if he were honest, really curious. As far as he knew, and Malfoy had admitted it as well, Malfoy had neither another source nor prospect of income.
"Tell me Granger, you have always said that it was wrong to hate Muggles and Muggleborns because their existence and blood status are not their fault. Then, is it Scorpius' fault to be born as my son? Do you know why Astoria left us? She said that she couldn't put up with it any longer, that her father was right, love alone is not enough. It is romantic, of course, but faced with reality of no money and practically being a social outcast..."
"What's wrong?" He kneeled down to look Scorpius level in the eyes. Carefully, he extracted his handkerchief and wiped the boy's tears.
"What's wrong?" He kneeled down to look Scorpius level in the eyes. Carefully, he extracted his handkerchief and wiped the boy's tears.
He was desperate, begging for job at the new bookstore on Hogsmead when Harry found him.
"This is justice," Harry said, his voice steady, hard.
For the first time, there was a bit of doubt in his mind.
Still, if he refused, what would become of his family? Without the money Harry gave him - for services rendered, his mind reminded him, without Harry's throwing around his weight at St. Mungo, his family was as good as doom anyway.
"So, we agreed, didn't we?"
Again, there was no answer, except a tightening of Scorpius' hold on his clothes.
Raith took the other's face in his hands then and forced the hooded man to look up, causing his hood to fall down.
The coldness of her words fed his anger.
Harry refilled the glass and brought it to the side table near his favorite couch.
And suddenly, someday seemed like the sweetest word Draco had ever heard, since it brought with it a hope for a second chance.
Draco felt the anger slowly leave him. He flopped down on the sofa and scrubbed his eyes tiredly.
They had Flooed him earlier, pretending to ask his opinion about one or two trivial problems, in which he had reluctantly responded. His younger self would have believed that they needed his help. His older self, fortunately – or unfortunately – was a little less naive.
She really didn't know, did she? She really was thinking that the Wizarding World had accepted his family back with opened arms. But why should she pay attention to the fate of ex-Death Eaters like him? After all, she was on the winning side.
"You have faith," Dumbledore corrected.
"Don't bring Harry into this. You must have influenced him somehow."
“Hm, we can live together,” Draco answered, paying more attention to Harry’s fingers, which he was playing with, than to Harry’s question. Harry had shorter, stronger looking fingers -- unlike his longer, graceful ones. There was something about seeing his and Harry’s fingers interlaced that fascinated Draco -- maybe it was the way their skins look together, dark and light.
"Oh that. He came to asked me about security plan for the coming Quidditch match." Harry smiled. The lie came out easily.
"And you will help me persuade the Wizengamot to pass the Werewolf Protection Law?"
"Harry? Can I come through?" A voice from the Floo, accompanied by his friend's bushy head, broke his rumination.
Draco had just knocked on the door when he was pulled inside and pushed against the wall by a furious Harry. Harry's green eyes were bright and he put his hands on the wall, trapping Draco inside them.
Why was it so difficult to say that word? He had said it a million times before. Hell, he had called Draco worse than that many times.
"Harry, I once said that love would be your strongest weapon; I still believe it."
“I’ll make you regret it someday, Malfoy! I’ll kill you myself!” the words Harry shouted out was piercing his heart, but Draco took extra care so he would not look back and his steps would not falter either.
"I tried negotiations, tried to talk, but they couldn't be convinced. They wanted me to be their poster boy; supporting whatever programs they sprouted out. They don't want me to think for myself."
It was a protection for werewolves bitten against their will, which was most of them. It established their rights as citizens, admitted that they were not simply mindless, dark creatures. Harry's proposal demanded the Ministry provide counselors to help families cope with their new situation, a guarantee of employment, and free wolfsbane potion.
And Harry. He didn't know when he started to develop feelings for Harry, but develop them he did. Perhaps it was after Harry saved him from the Fiendfyre. Perhaps it was longer. It didn't matter.
Draco shivered. Harry was smirking and there was malice in his voice.
She was smiling, but something in her eyes told him that she didn't think they would win.
Draco didn't deign to answer him, opening the door instead. What was the use of an answer, anyway? He'd already given his opinion. There was no way he would sell out his family.
"Granger, to what do I owe the pleasure of your visit?"
It didn't matter that some triggers had to be executed before the dormant infection woke up. It didn't matter that said Mediwizard couldn't even state yet what were the required conditions. People panicked. They were afraid.
Granger was silent. Draco was quite sure she remembered that Narcissa Malfoy had helped Harry Potter to defeat Voldemort.
He had woken up from that one with a scream, scaring his children.
"I had thought, once, that after Voldemort was defeated, everything would be all right. Surely the Purebloods would see that blood doesn't matter. Surely the Ministry, purged of Voldemort and his follower's influence, would be a better, fairer institution. I was stupid."
"Oh?" He schooled his feature to indifference instead.
She had been head over heels with him when they were graduating from Hogwarts -- ending her seventh and his eight years there. Her father had told her that if she was determined to ally herself with the Malfoys, then she could forget her inheritance. She was young, though, and she chose him.
Draco had read the newspaper that morning, had known that Harry's Werewolves proposal had been approved. Shouldn't it make him happy?
Harry detected a hopeful tone in Malfoy's voice. He could sense that the bravado on display was a fake, though. Malfoy hated to show weaknesses. He thought that showing strength would make the opponent think that you couldn't be intimidated. It was too bad for him that they both knew exactly who was in control. Harry's inner self was cheering.
How could she say that? Didn't she understand that love was not enough? That they were still essentially fighting, even if the shape of the war and those who sat on the enemies' chairs had changed?
"And how do you propose to provide for them, then, Malfoy?"
She should know that voice. She was sure she had heard it before, but she couldn't place it.
Hermione hoped Harry was free. She usually preferred to come to his house to talk -- these days, no one knew who was on whose side at the Ministry. Besides, Harry was always busy, juggling more projects than what was healthy for him.
Harry's comment came unbidden into his mind. Was it true? Would Scorpius be better off with another family?
Draco tried to hide the tremor in his hands, yet he knew Harry had seen it. He had to make Harry understand. He had to.
She knew, Harry thought. Suddenly, his chest felt heavy and it was hard to breathe, yet at the same time, it felt like a burden had lifted from his shoulders. He didn't need to lie and do things in secret around her anymore.
It had begun as another taunt. If he were to be honest, he had believed that Malfoy had said the truth: he worked for Harry because he had no other option. He had bluffed when he said that Malfoy loved him.
Harry was speechless. He used to make such arguments to defend his actions. He was sure he was right.
"Hello, Mother."
Draco. So this was his doing. He had somehow convinced Hermione and turned her against Harry.
"I have no doubt of that."
"And why did you choose to work for me?"
Harry had wandered around in his own thoughts for so long that he didn't realize the students had abandoned the corridor. He should have foreseen that, given how bad his day had shaped up to be so far, the appearance of a mocking Malfoy was a guarantee, much like the dessert following a main course.
And he had tried. He had knocked almost every door at Diagon Alley, had applied for anything and everything, including for positions as a waiter or a shop-assistant. Nobody wanted to hire an ex-Death Eater.
Harry had often heard people from other houses say that Slytherins were just like the snake symbol of their house, slippery with a forked tongue. That day, he finally saw how much truth that statement had.
"And what? Have my mother evicted from St. Mungos? Have no money to feed my family?"
"If I help you, I request immunity for my family. There must be a way we can develop a mutually beneficial relationship."
Draco tried to answer, but he couldn't find his voice, so he just nodded instead.
"You are disappointed." The tone was gentler, calmer, like a parent who tried to coax his child to say more. Yet Harry held his silence. Dumbledore sighed.
"It won't guarantee that we will win..." Harry said.
"Don't change the topic, Malfoy." There was a note of warning on her voice.
"So?"
"Will it work?"
"Maybe, but at least it won't be two wrongs, right?" Dumbledore chided gently.
The fear and anger in Draco's heart seemed to cool down into a lead. And that was the crux of the matter, wasn't it? Harry didn't care, he couldn't care.
"And you are saying that you didn't try to sway her to your cause, to make her hate me? Surely you know how easily she is influenced into defending what she sees as the poor and defenseless, regardless of whether they deserve it or not!" Harry practically spat the last sentence. "Tell me Malfoy, why the hell do you work for me?"
He twirled the glass of firewhisky in his hand.
Unfortunately, if the look on Malfoy's face was any indication, he just achieved the opposite. Too late Harry realized that he never smiled at the other man. Malfoy probably thought it was some kind of a trap. Or worse, that, after knowing his feelings, Harry was mocking him.
"You got no one to blame but yourself for that, Malfoy," Hermione scoffed.
"I don't know you anymore, Harry." There was no anger left on her voice. Her tone was just plain sad.
The old Harry, Draco knew, would have taken this into consideration. He had read an article once at the Quibbler (not that he wanted to admit it, but for a desperate job seeker, every newspaper was an opportunity) that losing his parents had made Harry consider family as an important thing.
"I can't believe this is you, Harry."
He was rather adorable like this, Harry involuntary thought. He bridged the distance between them with quick steps and hugged Draco.
Hermione flinched involuntary when she saw Raith's hand stroke out and slap the hooded man. The sound resonated loudly.
He should have known Dumbledore would bring Malfoy up.
Why couldn't he make anybody see it? He just wanted to make it right. Maybe his methods were not always perfect, but in the big picture, it was nothing, wasn't it? The end, after all, justified the mean.
And just like that, he saw her deflate in an instant. The worry lines were back on her face and a haunted look entered her eyes. She put her book on the side table and sighing, took a seat beside him.
But Draco knew how it would be. People would soon make up some crime or another that his family allegedly had done. His parents and he would be sent to Azkaban, and the Ministry would put his son into an orphanage.
"Perverted? If any of us is a pervert, it is your precious Potter. Do you think I like it? You can't even imagine the depth of depravity the so-called upstanding wizards can think up when they've got closed rooms and a carte blanche to do whatever they want to do."
"Do you want me to just stay silent and let them do whatever they want to do, Hermione? Even after Ginny? After Teddy?"
Then everything faded into black.
Hermione shook her head and walked towards him.
-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.--.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-
The sound of footsteps snapped her back to reality. She darted away, her business with him forgotten.
Why on Earth did he help convince Minerva to accept the git's application as Potion Master, again? Oh yes, what said git had ungratefully termed as his 'Inner Gryffindor', his tendency to become a hero.
Hermione shook her head and walked towards him.
Not because it was unjustified or impossible - Harry would put all of his money onto Malfoy being the source - but simply because a Headmaster should not act so petulant.
Absently, he wondered whether his own son had gone to bed. He wanted to see Scorpius, but he couldn't bring himself to go home just yet. He couldn't stand the thought of going home to his family like that, smelling of sex and other men.
Days like these were by far the worst. Harry had just reached the lowest step of the stairs to his office, when he heard the voices of approaching students.
"And how do you propose to provide for them, then, Malfoy?"
"So?"
Harry smiled coldly.
Him? Twenty-four hours? The usual rules? What was Harry playing at?
Draco tried to hide the tremor in his hands, yet he knew Harry had seen it. He had to make Harry understand. He had to.
"It's fine. I will talk with your teacher tomorrow"
Simply because he was teaching DADA and had been doing so for the last twenty-something years, Harry was obviously the next Voldemort in-the-making. And, being the Headmaster, he surely wanted to build a Potter army.
Draco had planned to wake up late. It was five o'clock when he stumbled home from Harry's that morning. Moreover, he had just spent the day before as some man's toy for the whole day.
It was stupid, he knew, to fall for a man who only saw you as a tool. It was even stupider to still love said man, despite how badly he treated you.
Draco bowed his head, letting his fringe to cover his leaking eyes.
"I thought you were all for justice," Draco said bitterly.
The door was opened and there was Harry standing at the doorstep.
Still, he came inside. Harry closed the door behind them and looked expectantly at Malfoy.
"I am still doing it! Remember The Werewolves Protection Act?" Somehow, her accusation irked him.
"I'll owl you."
"You can always refuse."
His mind ran back to his conversation with Dumbledore -- whom he was no longer sure was only a figment of his imagination.
Still, Harry felt that if he just could explain it, Dumbledore would surely see it his way.
Then, he looked at Malfoy's eyes, and suddenly he knew that it was true.
The voice was cold. Draco forced himself to concentrate and observe Granger better. She looked as rumpled as he felt. And she was angry; he could see it in her eyes.
"No, but it is a start, isn't it?" asked Hermione.
"Like you said, you need me."
Still, when the bill came, he felt like it was far too fast, too soon. He did not want to let Harry go just yet, which was totally stupid since Harry was not his at the first place.
They took the light from her eyes like they took her from him. And that ungrateful Malfoy, how dare he to refuse, to argue? Death Eaters had to be punished for what they did. They killed and plundered, and then they pretended to repent, but how could one change what was rotten to the core?
"Malfoy."
"So? That's the only word you can say? What is your game, Malfoy? What are you planning to do? And don't tell me you have no scheme, because I won't believe it."
"Professor," Harry said, approaching the red bench where Dumbledore was sitting. He was wearing his purple robe, the one with silver stars on it, but Harry noticed that there was no twinkle in his eyes. Instead, they looked a bit sad.
Malfoy, no, Harry reminded himself, Draco, looked up. Confusion was plain on his face.
Draco felt the anger slowly leave him. He flopped down on the sofa and scrubbed his eyes tiredly.
Him? Twenty-four hours? The usual rules? What was Harry playing at?
He had thought about it over and over these last few days.
He grabbed Draco's chin with his right hand, forcing him to look into Harry's eyes. Then, Harry smirked.
"Potter, please..."
"Does it really matter, Hermione? People changed. Situations changed."
Draco felt like crying and laughing at the same time.
"Tell me, what will happen to your mother if I stop my endorsement and tell St. Mungos to just abandon her, hmm? And what happens to your dear family if you stop earning galleons?"
"He brought this upon himself." His voice was clipped and his eyes were hard.
Worse, he was not even a Werewolf. He had been examined, after all, and declared not infected.
Yet some wanted him simply because he was convenient. They knew he wouldn't talk and he wouldn't say no. His shivering became worse and Draco knew the shivers were not only because of the rain.
Harry tightened his arms.
"I am still doing it! Remember The Werewolves Protection Act?" Somehow, her accusation irked him.
"You could have told somebody."
Draco could feel his heart beat faster. Harry knew. He should have known that Granger would confront Harry about it. After all, Gryffindors were not famous for the ability to keep secrets, wasn't it?
"You are lucky Hermione came to me with news about the werewolf law. It is my main priority right now. I already have one address; I'll find the others soon. Go there and do as usual and I'll give you more time to think about the other one."
"It makes more progress than the other way."
"Pride won't help my family," he answered quietly.
"I am afraid being dead means I am not exactly caught up on what happens in life anymore. Please enlighten me how it all became Mr. Malfoy's fault."
"And I am grateful for Tinky. But you know that house-elves are inherited, don't you? Just like this Manor?"
"Hermione, we won! They passed it! They passed The Werewolves Protection Act! See? It is in the Prophet."
"Stay. I'll retrieve the proposal. Nobody will put your family in Azkaban. We'll look for another way to change the Ministry; a different proposal and some other methods to pass it."
"Absolutely, Mr. Potter."
Even the portraits seemed to have no respect for him. They tended to offer him unsolicited advice – and in both Phineas and Snape's case, critiques – about anything and everything, from his way of handling school business, to his choice of robe that day.
-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.--.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-
"Do you think Draco wanted this?"
How could she say that? Didn't she understand that love was not enough? That they were still essentially fighting, even if the shape of the war and those who sat on the enemies' chairs had changed?
Draco was just coming out of the apothecary, levitating bunches and bunches of potion’s ingredients, when his eyes caught a Harry-shaped person moving from the corner. Harry had not changed. He was speaking and laughing and moving his hands everywhere to emphasis his points at the same time. Then he saw the person standing beside Harry, the recipient of his smiles, and suddenly he could not breathe.
Scorpius nodded, yet Draco knew he didn't believe a word of it. Still, Draco refrained from saying anything more, choosing to hug his son instead. He could feel moisture invading his own eyes.
"I...I...," Malfoy stuttered.
"Hello, Mother."
He didn't understand. It was not the first time she was looking for him at the office, even if they both preferred to talk at his house. Moreover, he could safely say that that he hadn't seen her at all, so she couldn't be annoyed because of something that he had done. Or was it possible that she was upset because she couldn't find him?
"They?"
"I don't think the Wizengamot will pass this one, Harry."
The same generation also apparently regarded him as a bumbling old fool, although he was barely forty, and still far from losing his mind.
"Hermione? What's wrong?"
Harry shouted out the words the moment he arrived at her house. He didn't give her any time to answer either, opting to envelop her in a hug instead.
"Oh? Oh? That's the only word you can say, Harry James Potter?" Hermione raised her voice.
"I am afraid being dead means I am not exactly caught up on what happens in life anymore. Please enlighten me how it all became Mr. Malfoy's fault."
He couldn't remember the last time he felt this happy. Teddy could come home now.
Then, when he saw the infuriating, annoying, maddening, way too bright, unbelievably natural, precious white blond tumbling out of it, he knew in his heart that yes, despite all the changes and troubles, Hogwarts was his home.
"Speak English, Potter."
"I'll say it is better than to be raised by Death Eaters."
"He is well compensated, isn't he? I pay him more than enough for his service."
Even after years, the memories of Fenrir and how the Werewolves sided with Voldemort were still fresh in some people's mind, Harry guessed. People wanted the Ministry to put away all Werewolves, dangerous or not. And the Ministry, trying to protect their own interests like usual, caved. To no avail Harry argued against it, citing Lupin as example.
"You have no choice and you know it."
"What did they say?"
"And how about Scorpius? Or other kids like him? Do they deserve to be punished?"
It was stupid, he knew, to fall for a man who only saw you as a tool. It was even stupider to still love said man, despite how badly he treated you.
He was also nervous if his words were any indication. Or maybe he was afraid. After their last encounter, Harry couldn't say he blamed him.
Harry was speechless. He used to make such arguments to defend his actions. He was sure he was right.
Maybe someday he would stop to kid himself.
She had hoped, that with time, the pain of losing Ginny would be lessened, that Harry would stop throwing himself to work. Apparently, it was a futile wish.
"I'll give you three days to think about it, but no more."
"Harry, I once said that love would be your strongest weapon; I still believe it."
"Cut it, Malfoy."
He had Apparated directly to Harry's from that man's place. The man, like most of them, had been old enough to be his grandfather. In many ways, he reminded Draco of Abraxas, with his white hair and kind look -- then the look disappeared as soon as they entered the chamber, replaced with lust and greed. He wanted Draco, and not in a grandfatherly way.
"Rumor has it that the Greengrasses had a kid that had been bitten to death by a werewolf. And the Brookses had been a staunch hater of werewolves. Not to mention the Radleys have a grandson that was turned into a werewolf. He couldn't handle the stress of transformation though, and killed himself three months later. Afterwards, they treated Werewolves as the embodiments of evil. "
Harry would let him take a bath, he knew. Then, they would have sex. Draco wouldn't pretend that it was something else. They would do it fast -- no foreplay, no tender whispers. But somehow, the fact that it was Harry's body, Harry's hands, made it somewhat better. Even if it was nothing for Harry but a convenience sex, even if Harry didn't care, he could pretend.
"Don't say that! This is not a Death Eater family! Yes, your grandfather and I made an awful mistake, but it doesn't mean that the entire family is made of Death Eaters. Besides, we have already paid for our mistake. Those kids have no right to say anything!"
Draco had thought that something like love surely could bring no shame. He also had thought that there was no way he could feel more miserable. He was wrong on both counts.
"I am. I am happy."
"I should have seen it, but you are my best friend and turning a blind eye is easier. You are colder, less inclined to forgive. The Harry I knew used to act first, to help even an enemy. Remember how you helped Malfoy from the Fiendfyre? Now, everything has to be calculated first for your benefit. You used to argue for justice, for equal treatment!"
She really didn't know, did she? She really was thinking that the Wizarding World had accepted his family back with opened arms. But why should she pay attention to the fate of ex-Death Eaters like him? After all, she was on the winning side.
Even remembering it was enough to rouse his anger and self-loathing once again. He couldn't protect her, couldn't even give her justice.
Sometimes, he wished that his family hadn't followed that mad man, that his father had taken a different course in life. He wished that his mother had not gone out alone on that blasted day to Diagon Alley. If she had taken somebody with her, maybe that Muggleborn wouldn't have hexed her and instead of depending on potions, she would be the healthy, determined woman he had known. Most of all, he wished that he was not so powerless.
"And what about Draco, Harry? You've forced him into prostitution!"
"I want you to be happy, Harry."
He suspected Peeves had finally succeeded on gaining access to the headmaster's room. If not, then maybe it was the work of his dear Deputy Headmaster, whose head Harry could swear had some screws loose.
Draco had planned to wake up late. It was five o'clock when he stumbled home from Harry's that morning. Moreover, he had just spent the day before as some man's toy for the whole day.
-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-
Draco felt like crying and laughing at the same time.
But not before Harry caught the look in his eyes. The grey orbs looked dejected and Harry realized that they had often looked sad, but he had never noticed before.
Just as sudden as it came, he felt the anger leaving him. He felt tired. Old and tired and stupid.
Yet, when night came, Harry was always reminded of the reason why Hogwarts was still home, despite everything.
"And why exactly should I care? Did the Death Eaters care about destroying innocent people's lives?"
He was rather adorable like this, Harry involuntary thought. He bridged the distance between them with quick steps and hugged Draco.
"It is in my interest to make you happy, isn't it?"
He was not stupid. He knew why they wanted him, each of them. Some were so firmly locked away in the closet, that the notion of wanting a man would send them running and screaming. But Draco looked like his mother, didn't he? After all, he inherited her silky locks and big eyes.
"I take it that it went well."
-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-
It was, he supposed, like taking a Muggle drug. It made you high and happy for a while and when the effect disappeared it would leave you feeling even worse than before. Yet, Draco was used to disappointment, wasn't he?
Malfoy looked like a mess. His eyes were rimmed red and there were dark pouches below them. His skin was paler than usual. Even his hair was limp.
"They passed it?"
Harry had said that it would keep the Wizarding world safer, that sometimes, things like technicality and lack of proofs had made it possible for criminals to escape justice. And Harry had argued that once a Death Eater, always a Death Eater. After all, if you could kill once, who could guarantee you wouldn't do it again?
Draco took a deep breath and tried to set his gloomy mood aside. His mother could still read him as well as ever and the last thing he wanted to do was to make her worry. Pasting a smile on his face, he greeted her.
Unfortunately, the ever-incompetent people at the Ministry didn't share the same opinion of him as his students; hence his bad mood.
He could try to find work in Muggle London, he supposed, but he knew nothing about Muggles. He'd had none of their education, and couldn't even operate most of their devices.
"No," Draco said, "I won't do it." Though his voice was small, there was no hesitation.
"I do it for better purpose."
From this up close, he could see there were tears in the corners of her eyes.
Maybe someday, someday the pain would lessen. Someday he would be able to look back at this and thought of it as nothing more but distant memories.
In a sense, he believed they were glad that he had chosen to pursue a career at Hogwarts. Despite their misgivings, he couldn't believe they would be any happier if he had followed his initial aspiration in becoming an Auror.
-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-
"Nobody else will hire me."
A year ago, when Harry approached her with a plan to change the Ministry, a plan that she swore she would not tell Ron about -- not that they didn't trust him, but with most of his family working at the Ministry, it was too risky and too dangerous for him to be involved with plans that were barely legal -- she had thought that he would use his influence as the Boy Who Lived. After all, he had a lot of clout these days.
“Are you really surprised?” Ron asked, raising an eyebrow. “I mean, you were kind of obsessed with him when we were younger. Need I remind you that you spent the entirety of sixth year watching his footprints on the Marauder’s Map?”
Draco snorted. “Unless you count eating dinner with my mother as ‘plans,’ then that would be a very hard no.”
Harry could feel his cheeks burning hot with embarrassment as he tried to gather the words to say something —
good at.”
Harry let out a courteous laugh. “Well, thank you for putting together such an amazing evening. I’m sure I’ll see you around.”
“And how does a hot chocolate or Butterbeer sound?”
Harry slowly removed his right hand from where it had been resting on Draco’s and moved it upwards, cupping Draco’s cheek. The softness and warmth of his face underneath Harry’s calloused fingers was addicting, and although Draco’s pale pewter eyes had gone wide with skepticism, Harry reassured himself that he was making the right decision.
Draco snorted. “Brian’s? What kind of tosser names their restaurant Brian’s?”
“No, not to toot my own horn.”
Potter shifted so that they were looking at each other, a lopsided grin spreading across his face. “I’ve just fucked you raw, and you want to talk about my bloody bathroom?”
“Well, why don’t the three of you take a seat at the dining room table while Draco and I finish up dinner?” Narcissa asked, standing up so that she was only a few steps away from Andromeda.
Once Hermione had opened the door to Harry’s room, she didn’t waste any time. Sitting on the edge of Harry’s bed, she gently pushed his black waves off of his forehead.
Draco skeptically quirked an eyebrow. “As in, presents for
“I can assure you that the git wants nothing more than to be kissed by you.”
“Well, I’m sorry to see you go, Draco. I’ve had a lovely time,” Hermione said, setting down her knitting and standing up.
Sorry this is almost four hours later than usual! I slept in for the first time in a while, and it was great 😂 The craft fair is based on a holiday fair that happens every year in my town, and it's held at the local art center. It's not on this year, of course, so I'm missing it lots. Also, I PROMISE I will get to responding to comments once I've uploaded all of the chapters!
“That’s the plan,” Draco said, his hand slowly snaking down to cup Harry’s bulge as their eyes made contact. “May I?”
came out of nowhere,” Harry said, letting out a nervous laugh as he looked down at the table.
“So,” Draco began, draping a napkin across his lap, “are you dating anyone?”
Ron, from his corner of the couch, yawned before closing his eyes and leaning his head against a pillow. “Morning.”
An all-too-familiar glint appeared in Malfoy’s eyes, and he smirked as he lugged Harry’s trunk inside, gestured for Harry to follow, and then closed and locked the door behind them. “We’ll make time.”
Harry held up his knitting needles, showing off the progress he’d made in his yellow jumper. “Alright. I’m about to start the sleeves, which I’m
As he rode Potter, thrusting himself down on his cock as deeply as possible, Draco reached down to wrap his hand around his own length. He began to pump his hand, adjusting his movements so that it was in time with Potter’s movements.
He sighed. “Fuck it.”
Draco grinned, leaning into him. “For you, always.”
“Mind if I sit with you?” Malfoy asked, taking a few steps forward.
“So … how does knitting work, exactly? Like, how do I do it?” Harry asked, trying to imagine how one would get the yarn
After a minute or two of silence, Draco looked up once again. “I think I’m going to get the pad thai.”
“So,” Harry said.
“Alright, alright. Let’s get you some food, shall we?” Harry asked, wandering into the kitchen.
“How long are our lessons going to continue?” Draco asked.
Harry looked down at the letter in his trembling hands, and a weary sigh escaped his lips. Before he could lose his nerve, he peeled open the envelope and pulled out the letter.
Harry waved a hand dismissively in the air. “Nonsense. Listen, it’s been years since the war. It might take a little getting used to, but I’ve no doubt that Ron and Hermione will warm up to you. I can ask them through the Floo if it’s alright. Come on, follow me.”
Harry snorted. “Nothing wrong with preferring to lock my doors with keys instead of a wand.”
“I love you.”
Harry knew he was going to be in for a long day.
“Thank you, Draco,” Laoise said, beaming. “We’re pretty proud of them.”
He felt a surge of serotonin as soon as the pads of his fingers graced over the soft, forest green and cream colored cashmere wool of the left glove. Like many of his projects, the gloves were mosaic, rectangular patterns rippling across the body of them. Although he had more projects going on than he cared to admit, several of them sitting in time-out at the back of his knitting closet due to frustration, gloves were an easy, mindless project that he found to be extremely helpful after a full day of work. When he had more energy, he tended to focus on his mustard yellow jumper, working from the top down. The yoke of the jumper, a robin blue leaf pattern stemming from the cusp of the neckline and stopping at the bottom of the chest, required a bit more attention and brainwork, although he didn’t mind. He hadn’t yet reached the sleeves of the jumper, which he was grateful for, as they were known among the knitting world for being some of the longest, most boring knitting work one could do. In fact, Harry often referred to it as Sleeve Island, desperate to become unstranded from rows upon rows of the same stitch.
Harry grinned, warmed that Draco would think to ask Hermione, of all people, for advice. With a sudden burst of courage, he leaned over and pressed a gentle kiss to Draco’s forehead.
Draco nodded. “And I’ll take tea. Thank you.”
Draco pulled out before snapping his hips forward, eliciting a breathy groan from Harry. After a minute, he was able to find a steady pace. Desperately trying to ignore the way that Harry looked underneath him, sweat-soaked and completely undone, he focused on the tight heat surrounding his length and how, if he angled slightly upwards, Harry would let out a dry sob and beg for more.
“Oh, I can vouch for that one. It’s amazing,” Harry said, grinning.
“I’m so excited you’re here, Harry!” they said, pulling back from the hug. “And you too, Draco. Any friend of Harry’s is a friend of ours.”
“Potter?” Malfoy asked hesitantly, his voice breaking the deafening silence.
“I’m going to go get it. Be right back,” Hermione said, standing up and walking out of the dining room.
Stockinette let out a content purr as she closed her eyes, and Harry followed.
Harry looked at Malfoy—at the way beads of sweat lined his upper lip, at the way his muscles were shaking with the effort from not yet thrusting, at the way his grey eyes looked nearly blue in the pale, overcast light coming in from the window next to the bed—and something shifted inside Harry. Reaching up, he wrapped his arms around Malfoy’s neck and pulled him into a wet, needy kiss, their tongues meeting fearlessly. Harry could taste Malfoy’s sweat, could feel their hearts pounding heavily together.
Harry frowned but said nothing else. After Amelia handed them their drinks, Harry spotted a secluded booth in the back and led Draco to it. As they settled in, sitting across from one another, Harry could smell the rich peppermint coming from his hot chocolate, cream melting over the sides. Draco’s butterbeer didn’t look too bad, either, a warm butterscotch scent coming from its direction.
“Want to pop into Broomstix? I’ve been dying to see the new broom that was released in November,” Draco said.
Taking out his knitting, Harry sighed. “So, you get that a lot?”
As Hermione raised her wand, Harry felt a cool sensation roll over his body. He ran his fingers through his hair, which wasn’t nearly as greasy as it had been before, and he let out a heavy sigh.
“She’s pretty happy. I’ve woken up to her sleeping on Draco’s chest for the last three days ―” Harry started before cutting himself off as Hermione arched an eyebrow and Ron opened his eyes.
Harry glared at his cat, who was in the midst of climbing into an empty cardboard box that had been full of new knitting books. She glowered at him in return before promptly hopping inside.
He nodded. “
,” Draco said softly. “Watching you … it’s unlike anything I’ve ever seen. Even my mother isn’t as good as you, and she’s been knitting for thirty-five years.”
Draco shook his head, his eyes focused ahead. “No. It’s alright. I’m used to this.”
Andromeda raised an eyebrow. “Draco? As in my nephew?”
“I’m thinking
After a moment, Potter opened the door. He looked just as ravishable as he always did, with loose, slightly tousled curls that fell to the tips of his ears, golden brown skin, a tight white T-shirt, and grey joggers that had no business being so clingy. Draco didn’t even bother hiding the fact that his gaze immediately fell to Potter’s crouch, hungrily intaking the barely-there outline of his cock.
No matter what it was, though, Draco was there, and so was Harry.
“Well,” Draco began, taking a look around the shop, “I’d like to pick out yarn for a hat.”
“So, you’re both alright with Malfoy coming, then?” Harry asked hopefully.
Harry followed Draco down the cobblestone path. A full moon hung painted against the inky sky, and only a few stars were visible behind thick clusters of clouds. To their right were rows upon rows of pink, white, and red rose bushes, all neatly trimmed into perfect spheres. Up ahead sat a wall of tall, willowy reeds surrounding what appeared to be a pond. As they neared it, Harry could just barely make out the silhouettes of koi swimming in the dark water. Draco led Harry to a white marble bench that was hidden in a cutout among the reeds, and they took a seat.
I can't get over how much love TWWW is getting. Thank you all so much for taking time out of your day to read, comment, and leave kudos ❤
“You okay, Potter?” Draco asked as Hermione and Ron walked ahead. “You look a bit … cold.”
As soon as everyone began to pack up their things, Harry realized that he wasn’t quite ready for Draco, who hadn’t uttered a word since Harry had asked if he needed help, to leave. As the students began to disperse, he cleared his throat.
Draco cleared his throat, looking around. “Well, shall we move on?”
Draco nodded curtly in response.
Draco turned to look at Harry, his cheeks rosy from grinning. “Well, should we add the final touch?”
“Why haven’t they seen each other in so long? If I had a brother or sister,
Draco snorted. “Ah yes, says the same man who accused me of being the heir to Slytherin without waiting to find any actual proof.”
“I―yes, thank you,” Draco said, dumbfounded as his eyes flickered between Molly and Arthur, no doubt wondering how the hell Harry had managed to convince them to give up their Christmas afternoon.
Weasley,” Draco said curtly before sitting back down.
A thick silence fell over the room, and Harry watched as Draco ducked his head, absently picking at a dropped stitch. He could see the shame in Draco’s face, his cheeks blotchy from embarrassment.
Draco grumbled throughout the entire trek, which took no longer than ten minutes. However, Harry had to admit that the wet soil and dew dropped grass of the field, in combination with the upwards climb of the hill and beginning of a rainstorm, was enough to make him a little grumpy.
Harry snorted. “Are you trying to make small talk?”
Harry nodded, setting down the wool. “I think so.”
Harry watched as Draco disappeared behind Narcissa into the next room, his gaze lingering only a moment too long before he got hold of himself and turned his attention to Teddy and Andromeda, who were seated opposite him.
It was on a cold, early December afternoon that everything changed.
It was perfect.
“It’s … been a while,” Potter said.
Andromeda quirked an eyebrow. “Do you know if he’s also into men?”
Harry snorted. “And you’re still a pompous arse.”
His sentence was interrupted by the sight of a distant, yet familiar face peering in through the front windows before walking in, the small bell above the door chiming, and everything seemed to fall away.
Harry had been right in his prediction of rain. By the time midday rolled around, deep claps of thunder were echoing across the dark sky, and an occasional flash of white light illuminated the heavy waves of raindrops crashing to the ground.
“Doing okay?” Draco asked.
“Oh,” Harry said, dumbfounded. “Well, I’m bisexual.”
“Yes, this is Teddy,” Andromeda nodded, wiping a few stray tears as she ruffled Teddy’s hair. “Teddy, can you say hi to Aunt Narcissa and Cousin Draco?”
Harry, slightly breathless from the overwhelming intoxication of Draco’s aftershave, shook his head. “Not at all.”
“First of all,” Draco said, pulling Harry close and planting a soft kiss on his lips, “hello, you.”
“Well, the war hurt a lot of people, including Granny and her family. They were all hurt in different ways, and it’s only now that they’ve healed enough to see each other again,” Harry explained.
Draco nodded. “That’s understandable. Why don’t you start with something non-work related? Something that seems manageable. Maybe you could try to accomplish it within the next day or two. I can help, if you need it. Just let me know—”
It was made out of the very mustard yellow yarn that Draco had purchased when he’d come to help decorate the shop, having refused to tell Harry who the project was for. It looked exactly like Harry would have expected: dropped stitches everywhere, incredibly tight tension, and a decrease that had gone
Over the years, Harry had developed the ability to knit without looking, only glancing down when concentration was necessary. He’d managed to teach himself how to do it during the long wave of recovery, determined to watch television and knit at the same time. Every time he was invited over for a movie night at the Granger-Weasley flat, Hermione would wind up shooting him jealous daggers. It was something that Harry took pride in, especially since it was one of the few things he was able to do that Hermione couldn’t execute no matter how hard she tried.
“Oh, excellent choice. Cream and marshmallows?” Amelia asked.
Through the window, Harry could see Stockinette glaring at him from her perch on the couch.
He refused to admit that he was going to miss Malfoy, but the man was certainly more than a decent shag. There was something about him—the way he loved to bend Harry over his desk, the way he carefully tended to the sensitive spot in the hollow of Harry’s collarbones, the way he panted Harry’s name when Harry filled him with come—that made it just a little harder to go.
“Ready?” he asked.
“Harry,” Draco said, cupping Harry’s chin with his hand and tilting it up, “I love it so much. It fits perfectly, and the design is beautiful. I’m only laughing because of your last present. Go on and open it.”
“I’ve never been to Dublin, you know,” he said.
“Brian’s?” Hermione asked, taking a seat next to him.
Harry nodded enthusiastically as he scooted towards the headboard, resting his head on his pillow. “I’m sure.”
“Says who?” Malfoy asked, smirking. “You know, I’m disappointed I wasn’t able to make it to your stall today. I think my team would benefit from your brooms. They’re supposed to be the best in the business.”
And he wanted nothing more than that.
Draco let out a huffy, out of breath laugh as he tilted his head back. “Are you always this articulate?”
The platters began to arrange themselves across the table, and Harry was finally able to see what they were to be having for dinner: a lemon and rosemary chicken, creamy mashed potatoes with gravy, and buttery string beans with salt and pepper. Teddy began to clap his hands eagerly as he eyed the food in front of him, causing Harry to grin.
“I don’t know, Pans.” Draco sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. “Sure, he’s friendly towards me, although I suppose he has to be. I threatened to decorate his living room in taxidermied deer heads the other day because he was chewing his sandwich too loudly.”
Hermione took a seat next to him, frowning as she rubbed her hand soothingly in a circle on his back. “That’s not the point, Harry. I suppose what Ron and I are trying to get at is that you’ve always been far more interested in Malfoy than the rest of us. For some reason, you two just seemed to connect, even if it wasn’t necessarily in a good way. It makes a lot of sense to me that now, having had some distance since our days at Hogwarts and the war, you’re figuring out your feelings for him. I truly wouldn’t be surprised if you liked him all along and just didn’t realize it because of everything that was happening.”
Harry knit his eyebrows together. “Malfoy?”
“Well, to answer your question ― no, I do
“Sorry, lads, but the rules are the rules!” McWeenie said, smiling as though he wasn’t sorry in the slightest. "Now, why don’t you stand off to the side while I get through the rest of these names, hm?”
He was fine.
By the time he was at the front of the queue, his mouth was watering. He quickly placed his order and paid before watching as the woman behind the counter scooped a generous amount of gelato into the waffle cone. As soon as he was handed his cone, he thanked the woman before making his way out of the shop and back onto the promenade. He turned left, heading in the direction of his favorite bench to sit on while eating his gelato and staring at the water. As he walked, he took a lick. He was first hit with the strong taste of hazelnuts, followed by the creaminess of the chocolate and crunchy bits of Ferrero Rocher. His eyes rolled back, and he restrained himself from letting out an audible groan.
Harry tried desperately to ignore the disappointment settling in his stomach. “Alright. Well, thanks for a great time.”
Harry let out a soft laugh. “No, Ginny and I broke up shortly after the war. We decided that we were better off as friends. In fact, she and Luna have been together for well over three years now. Word has it that Luna’s bought an engagement ring, and she plans on proposing on New Year’s Day.”
“Seems as though an affinity for Cauldron Cakes runs in the family,” Narcissa joked, her eyes meeting Andromeda’s.
, just as Ron had Hermione, or how Bill had Fleur. He wanted to know what it was like to take a chance.
Draco’s cock pushed inside, ripping a low moan from Harry’s throat. The stretch he’d felt from Draco’s fingers was nothing compared to his cock. It took what felt like hours before Draco was fully inside of him, remaining stationary in order to let Harry adjust to the fullness. However, after a minute, Harry began to grow impatient, his own cock weeping with need.
“Stockinette, would you quit it?”
to land on me?”
“Ron! ‘Mione! We’re here!” Harry hollered.
After Harry relieved himself and pulled on a Weird Sisters hoodie that Hermione had given him years ago, he padded down the hallway and into the living room and kitchen area, which was only separated by a narrow granite island. He peered out of the window that sat to the left of his navy blue couch, watching shadow colored clouds drift across the sky. The light spilling into his flat was dark and dull, and Harry guessed that there would be a heavy downpour in the afternoon. Normally, he found dreary weather to be quite disagreeable, much preferring the soft, warm breezes of spring to the harshness of winter. However, since opening his shop, he’d learned that stormy weather meant people seeking shelter, and people seeking shelter meant more customers.
Harry frowned, not sure what to say due to both the heartache Draco must’ve felt and his own irrational jealousy.
“So.” Draco let out a heavy sigh. “Think we can take the long way home?”
They eventually made their way through the meadow and onto the forest trail, which was surrounded by tall oak trees and long, sun-kissed grass. Harry spotted a small creek shimmering in the distance, and the soft sounds of birds tweeting and deer running across the underbrush filled the sweet summer air.
when it comes to knitting, so if it’s something you’d like to keep up, I’d be happy to help.”
The cuckoo clock shoved into the back left corner of the store began to chime obnoxiously, disrupting Harry’s train of thoughts. He looked towards it, realizing that it was already nine o’clock.
need to inform my mother that I’m having dinner elsewhere,” Draco said.
“Alright, we’ve got to sheer some of our sheep in an hour, so why don’t we give you a tour of our merinos?” Laoise said.
Harry blinked, turning back to Mrs. Van Ness, whose eyes were flickering between him and Draco.
Harry grinned as he tried to finagle the hat onto his head, only partly successful. “I love it, Draco, and I’m so proud of you for making it as well as you did. My first hat came out much worse than this. It’s just … thank you.
“Ha-ha,” Harry said dryly as he briefly wandered into the kitchen, only to return a moment later with a takeaway menu in hand. “Listen, you only won because I haven’t been on a broom in forever.”
“Oh.”
“Oh, fantastic! Alright, are you up for me to teach you right now?” Hermione asked, a wide smile spreading across her face.
And it was true; Grimmauld Place looked as incredible as it always did during the holiday season. Thick ropes of garland were wrapped around the grand staircase’s banister, along with bright red ribbons and clusters of holly. The crystal chandelier hanging above the grand foyer collected golden light spilling from the various lanterns levitating about the place. Harry could only see a few craft stalls through the thick crowd, but he knew that they would be extending to every room in each story.
Before Draco could say anything, a loud whooshing sound came from behind them. Draco took a step back in surprise, and Harry could immediately feel the absence of warmth from Draco’s hand on his shoulder. Turning around, he saw Andromeda and Teddy stepping out of the Floo.
“I am!”
“Stare often, then, do you?” Malfoy asked, smirking.
you here, then?”
“For Merlin’s sake,” Harry muttered under his breath, turning back to his own work.
“Um, well … there
Harry made a face. “Do I have to?”
He could remember it all so vividly ― the shouts of pain coming from Hermione, Luna’s look of complete and utter hopelessness, Dobby’s bright green eyes, and Draco.
His heart gave a little pang, which he decidedly ignored. “So, care to tell me why we’re sitting on top of the car?”
Except for the fact that half of his queen-sized bed was cold at night, or that he made coffee and breakfast for one every morning, or that he spoiled Aquila beyond belief because there was no one else there to love, or that he was now the designated single person in his friend group. He tried desperately to push those thoughts to the back of his mind, instead throwing himself into his work.
They entered the kitchen, where Oisín was seated at a small, round table. Their curly, caramel colored hair was shorter than the last time Harry had seen them, and they had a new tattoo on the side of their neck. Harry watched the tattoo as it came to life, a hippogriff spreading its sterling wings.
“Don’t tell me you invited Malfoy,” Ron said.
“Harry, you’re not serious ―” Ron began, but Harry interrupted him.
“Right,” Draco said, letting out a light laugh, “well, cheers to us for playing our first Quidditch game in years.”
“That’s … amazing. I’m so glad your mum’s company has been successful. Did … did she ever tell you about the night of the battle? When she saved me?” Harry asked.
“It was around then that my mother began to fiddle with the idea of a floral arrangement company. She’s always been an avid gardener. When I was a child, my father would chastise her for not letting the house elves tend to the garden. She never budged, though, insisting that it was her work and hers alone. Since I had nothing better to do, I wound up helping her research how to go about creating the company. The laws were a bit tricky to navigate given her criminal status, but we wound up figuring out how to manage around it.
Harry bit his bottom lip in an attempt to hide his grin. “Some real character development going on, I see.”
, and all that—”
Harry couldn’t help but feel a surge of accomplishment, beckoning Draco to follow as he began walking towards the cubby holes against the wall. He then pulled out a light grey skein, holding it up for Draco to see.
As Draco stepped out of the Floo, Harry did a double take. Draco wasn’t wearing his usual smart jumper and tight trousers, but was instead clad in an outfit rather similar to Harry’s. He had on a wooly jumper that had patches on the elbows and classy black joggers that must have cost him at least thirteen Galleons. However, in his right hand was his old, familiar Nimbus 2001.
Harry blinked, startled, and could feel his cheeks burning. “I ― sorry, what?”
Harry looked up from the stove and was met with a smirking Draco. He looked just as smart as usual, a dark red collared shirt tucked neatly into charcoal colored trousers and a wool coat, and Harry immediately got the impression that he was underdressed, despite knowing that this was a casual occasion. However, he couldn’t help but look down at his own outfit, a deep brown turtleneck and form-fitting jeans with a hole in the right knee, with self-consciousness.
“Draco,” he said, his voice barely above a whisper, “for the love of Merlin, would you please just
Molly rolled her eyes, shifting a tin of Christmas biscuits the size of a medium tire from one hip to the other as she turned to Harry. “Darling, you really don’t think Mal ―
“Shut up. No one will know about this,” Draco said, his eyes still glued to Stockinette as he scratched behind her ears.
“Fucking incredible,” Draco said, shooting him a cheeky grin. “I love you an awful lot, you know.”
He’d been fine before. Successful, comfortable, content. Now, though, having gone a full twenty-five days with Draco back in his life, he couldn’t remember a time when he’d been happier. This wasn’t to say that his joy depended on Draco, because it certainly didn’t ― he couldn’t just discount the shop, Stockinette, Ron, Hermione, the rest of the Weasleys, Andromeda and Teddy, as well as all of the progress he’d made over the years. However, it was worth noting that life had far more color nowadays, and Harry knew it was all thanks to Draco.
“Well,” Ron said, scooping Stockinette into his arms and placing dry kisses onto her forehead, “I certainly wasn’t the one to figure it out first. That was all ‘Mione. She came to me in what, fourth year? After the Yule Ball. Said that there was something strange about the way you’d been looking at Malfoy all night.”
“It’s beautiful,” Harry said. “Do you miss flying?”
“Hi, Harry,” Hermione said, giving him a quick hug before turning to Draco.
“It’s perfect. Thank you,” Harry said, digging out his wallet. “How much do I owe you?”
Relieved at the familiar sight, he let out a sigh. “Hey, Malfoy.”
“Oh. Well, I think Mother misses her. She’ll sometimes tell me stories from her childhood while we make flower arrangements, and she always seems to talk about Aunt Andromeda with fondness. I think they were rather close when they were younger,” Draco said.
Dinner had gone by surprisingly well, the conversation mostly consisting of small talk and pleasant inquiries about each others’ lives. Now, as they resumed sitting on the couch and the surrounding chairs, Harry watched as Draco tried desperately to pick up a stitch without dropping it. In the chair next to where Draco was seated on the couch sat Hermione, who was at the tail end of knitting her socks.
“Can you try? For me?” Hermione asked softly.
They spent the next hour knitting and chatting away, Ron working on a crossword puzzle. After deciding that the front window display should involve jumpers and the Snowfall Spell, they discussed the rest of the shop’s decorations for a good while. Harry kept sneaking glances at Draco, searching for some semblance of enjoyment in his face.
,” Harry muttered as he peeled back the duvet and stood up.
Before Harry could say anything, Draco looked up and caught his eye. Harry’s breath hitched as a soft smile crept across Draco’s face, and the world seemed to fall away. If Harry could, he would have captured that moment a thousand times in his head, the image Draco smiling at the sight of him igniting something splendid and terrifying in the pit of his stomach.
Harry raised his eyebrows, surprised at the question. Although he’d been very open with Andromeda about his interest in both men and women, he wasn’t exactly comfortable telling her about the fact that he fancied her nephew. Not yet, anyway.
“Right. Does she have a favorite color or a favorite thing to knit?” Harry asked.
“Yeah. Want some, then?” Harry asked as he picked up Stockinette’s now empty bowl.
Draco snorted, elbowing Potter gently in the side. “Sure, but what about the come stains?”
“Suit yourself,” Draco said.
“Sure,” Harry said, nodding as he bent down and fisted a cluster of grass.
The corners of Malfoy’s mouth turned upwards slightly. “I suppose.”
“Please. With butter and jam, and don’t be stingy,” Draco instructed, plopping down on the couch.
“Hey,” Potter said, pushing a stray strand of hair from Draco’s face. “There’s no need to be nervous. Turns out you’re a pretty lucky guy, after all.”
“Alright, everyone!” McWeenie said as he dabbed a handkerchief to his bald head, which was moist with sweat. “Listen up. As you know, this weekend is all about building trust and unity between departments. What better way to do this than with games? Let’s have some fun with this!” McWeenie paused, clearly waiting for some type of reaction. He received none. “Wow,
“Well,” Harry began. “I’m hosting a beginner’s workshop here tomorrow morning, and there are still a few spaces available.”
Now, moving on. *Prepares for all of the yelling I'm about to receive in my inbox from this chapter.*
After casting a protection spell, as well as another lubrication spell, Draco aligned himself and slowly pushed in, watching Harry as he breathed through the burning stretch. Once fully in, he stilled for an agonizing moment, letting Harry adjust.
Draco glanced at his watch with a frown. “It’s getting late. I should probably get going.”
on the muddy knees of his jeans. “The port is just on the other side of that hill. Come on, let’s go.”
Draco frowned. “Saved you? What the hell are you on about, Potter?”
After giving Stockinette one final scratch, Harry followed. A brief moment later and he was stumbling out of Grimmauld Place’s sitting room fireplace. The sweet smell of cinnamon, oranges, and baked apples hit him as he looked around, searching for a glint of blond hair.
After thirty antagonizing minutes of back-and-forth regarding where to eat, the four of them finally landed on a relatively new Italian restaurant, owned by a well-regarded witch, near Flourish and Blotts. Once Stockinette had been adequately pet, coats and scarves had been put on, and Harry and Draco’s purchases had been snuck out of Hermione’s bag, they were off.
“Alright,” Draco said hesitantly. “Well, I wasn’t doing much for about the first year, to be honest ― mostly just putting about the Manor, I suppose. In spring of ‘99 I found a job at Borgin and Burkes, but that only lasted so long. Too many memories.
“When I was watching the telly,” Teddy said indignantly.
Truly.
“Merlin, that’s—” Harry let out a shaky breath before pulling back slightly so that he could look Malfoy in the eye. “Wait. The train’s leaving soon. Will we even have time?”
“Stop talking rubbish, Potter,” Malfoy said, rolling his eyes. “Surprisingly, I’m not here to ridicule you.”
“Oh. Sure.”
“Merry Christmas, Draco,” Harry whispered against his lips.
“Hey,” Harry said, standing up from his seat. “What’s that?”
A thick silence filled the air, neither of them quite knowing what to say. Harry could feel his heart beating steadily against his chest as he let himself look at Draco properly. He immediately regretted doing so.
As Oisín continued to list off twenty more colors, Harry looked to Draco, who was staring intently at the different colors. He had the same look on his face that he'd often had during class at Hogwarts, as though he was channeling all of his concentration into this one thing. It was oddly endearing watching Draco learn about an entirely new skill and the world surrounding it, and Harry felt much like he was watching a child on Christmas morning. There was a gleam of curiosity in Draco’s pale grey eyes, and Harry wanted nothing more than to make Draco look like that all the time.
After a few minutes of silence, Harry looked up and realized that Draco was staring at the jumper on his needles.
In some ways, it was just like coming home.
Harry nodded. “Yes please.”
Next chapter goes up: Monday, Nov. 30th
Harry swallowed thickly, guilt bubbling up inside his chest as memories of the Forbidden Forest flooded his mind: laying still on the cold dirt, Narcissa’s rose perfume consuming him as she had leaned down, the words,
Stockinette cocked her head before silently agreeing that breakfast would do, promptly jumping off the bed and heading in the direction of the kitchen.
Oisín nodded. “Yeah, they do. The orange is Laoch, the green is Eachtránaí, the light blue is Claíomh …”
Draco leaned closer, squinting. “I think so.”
Here it is! One of my favorite chapters! Whenever I would visit my wife in Dublin while we were long distance, we would hang out on Grafton Street, eat waffles at Gino's, and get lunch at Bewley's. They're some of my most treasured memories.
“Anyone but
Harry glanced up, shooting him a look as he took his first bite. “
Harry fell in love with Draco over a cauldron.
Slowly, he began to sit up, his weak muscles aching in protest. Hermione scooted off the bed, and he watched her wrinkle her nose at the smell as she peeled the blanket off of his body. He knew he needed to shower; his hair was greasy, clinging to his forehead, and he could feel a fine layer of grime covering his skin. Unfortunately, he was too worn out to be embarrassed.
However, in the rare moments of clarity that Harry experienced, he could tell that he was slowly slipping away. While it was obvious that both Ron and Hermione had escaped the war with some bruising, they seemed to be coping alright, especially after having moved in together after a few months of dating. Hermione constantly praised Ron for his ability to calm her down after a particularly nasty dream, and Harry knew that Hermione had a knack for telling when Ron was reliving one of the various ways he had narrowly escaped fatal harm. However, they were both able to function, carrying on with what Harry considered to be as normal a life as possible. While Hermione held a lower position in the Muggle Liaison Office, Ron had begun his training as an Auror. Harry, having done nothing with his life, felt both empty and insignificant, wanting nothing more than to feel alright again.
Harry smirked. “The only other people are Hermione and Ron. Your pick.”
Draco snorted. “I’m sure you could find plenty of eligible bachelors or bachelorettes to accompany you.”
“I think I’d really like to kiss this git,” Malfoy said. “But only if that’s alright with him.”
Pulling a face, Draco wandered over to the couch, taking a seat with a heavy sigh while Harry kneeled down in front of the fireplace. After quickly igniting a log, he stuck his head into the fireplace and placed his Fire-Call. After a moment, he could see the outline of Ron and Hermione’s faces poking through the embers.
Days eventually turned into weeks, weeks turned into months, and months turned into a little over a year and a half of pure, unadulterated torment. Before Harry knew it, he’d turned nineteen, time slipping through his fingers in a blur. He was absolutely miserable; he hadn’t had a proper night’s sleep in Merlin knows how long due to the painstakingly cruel nightmares that visited him every time he went to bed, he looked sickeningly thin from his lack of appetite, and he rarely felt any motivation to leave the house.
“Oh. Okay,” Draco said, a look of uneasiness shifting across his face. “What is it?”
Because although they hardly talked, or knew each other as adults, or interacted in any significant way, Harry still cared for the arse — even if it was from afar.
“Just a side note that the yellow curry, lemon chicken, and pad thai are all incredible,” Harry said, handing him the menu.
Draco rolled his eyes as he continued to stir an Everlasting Elixir. “I’ve said your name at
“Listen, mate,” Ron said, scooting closer to Stockinette. “It’s not our fault you have a great cat.”
Draco shifted forward, one hand moving to Harry’s chest and the other to the nape of Harry’s neck. “Well, that’s awfully convenient.”
, Malfoy. Anyway, Merlin. It must have been so difficult to stop seeing Andromeda.”
He let out a heavy sigh as he looked around the unfamiliar room. Today it was Naxos. Next week it would be France; Saint-Tropez, probably. Harry favored secluded coastal towns that offered privacy, as per part of their agreement — no one was to know about them. Draco typically didn’t care where they met every Saturday afternoon, so long as the views were nice, the post-sex snacks included locally grown fruit, and the bedsheets had a thread count of four hundred.
And so, after the first day of this year’s convention had drawn to a close, Harry made the short trek from his hotel on Strand Road to the path that lined the beach. It was cool and overcast, yet the air held everything that a proper summer day should — a soft breeze carrying salt from the Irish Sea, the sound of children laughing as they walked with their families down the promenade, the smell of freshly made waffle cones coming from the gelato shop up ahead.
After washing his hair twice, he decided he’d stalled enough, begrudgingly turning off the shower head. As soon as he stepped out, he was hit with a wave of bitterly cold air, and his wet skin immediately broke out in goosebumps. Once he’d scurried to wrap himself in a towel, he quickly cast a warming charm, bringing instant relief.
Ron scoffed in mock offense. “It’s for my baking, ‘Mione!”
Draco let out a long sigh. “It went well overall, although it left Mother frantic. A woman who works at the Ministry ordered five-hundred white roses for her daughter’s seventeenth birthday, which was today. Why this woman thought that putting an order that large in only twenty-four hours in advance was socially acceptable is beyond me, but … Anyway, once we’d managed to transfigure our entire stock of roses into white, we began to put together the different arrangements that the woman had ordered ― bouquets, wreaths, sculptures, the whole lot. We didn’t finish until one a.m. Then, this morning, we had to transfer all of the arrangements to the woman’s house and set all of it up around the dining hall. Needless to say, my mother and I are both a little tired.”
Hermione arched an eyebrow. “Ronald, you just like any cat that isn’t Crookshanks.”
Draco sighed, absently resting his fork on his plate. “Lots of pine and holly wreaths, for starters. We’re also in charge of procuring and decorating the Christmas tree that’s to go in the center of the ballroom. We’ll have to
He stared, even as melted drips of sorbet ran down his hand, and watched as the image of a Snitch appeared.
Draco had come to terms with not having a soulmate — as much as he could, at any rate. Besides, he was moderately happy with his life; he had a flat in the heart of London, a German shepherd named Aquila who couldn’t possibly be any clingier, and a job working as a Potions Master in a small shop nestled in Diagon Alley. All in all, he was fine.
“Here,” Draco began, pulling out his wand and casting a Heating Charm, “that should be better.”
“Long story short, Draco came into the shop on Saturday while you two were busy with customers. He was looking for yarn for Narcissa, and since then I’ve begun teaching him how to knit. I was … well … I was wondering if he could come over for dinner as well, and we could do some knitting afterwards while we discussed the shop,” Harry said.
“Draco, darling?”
Draco was silent for a moment before saying, “Alright. Where should I meet you, and what time?”
“Wait,” Harry said, panicking as he realized he’d actually said that aloud. He grabbed Malfoy’s arm to stop him from moving. “Wait.”
Hermione rolled her eyes. “Give it up, Ronald. Harry wanted to become an Auror
Harry grinned to himself, remembering the way that Draco’s face lit up while they were decorating the shop. “He’s a lot tamer, I think. He doesn’t seem quite so hard around the edges. At school, he was nothing but a pompous git that nobody ― especially me ― could stand. Now, though … now, he’s
“Yeah,” Harry said, smiling at different memories from the past few days, “he’s … well, he’s Draco.”
Stockinette followed, hopping onto the counter.
“Morning,” Harry said, gesturing for them to come in. “I just need to grab a few things, and then I’ll be ready.”
“Good,” Harry said, letting out a heavy sigh. “Stressful, but good. Thank you both for putting a good word in for Draco, by the way.”
Harry blushed harder, if possible, and rolled his eyes. “Shove off.”
Pansy leaned back in her wicker chair, clearly not bothered. “Where I got it is none of your concern, and I was
“Why?”
“Sorry to interrupt,” Ron said, clearly not sorry, “but I agree with Teddy. Can we get moving?”
Harry gave him the go-ahead, and then he felt something cool against his arsehole. Draco’s index finger slowly pushed through his unworked ring of muscle, and he let out a sharp gasp, fisting the sheets. Although not exactly painful, it wasn’t necessarily comfortable, and Harry could feel a burning sensation surrounding where Draco’s finger was.
. He’s currently obsessed with dolls and coloring books, and he’s a ball of energy. He’s a Metamorphmagus, just like Tonks, so his hair is frequently changing color, although he’s recently been sticking with blues and greens.”
“Oh. Um.” Harry’s shoulders tensed. “Why
Wandering into the kitchen, which was only separated from the living room by a marble island, Harry set the wine down on the counter. Then, he settled onto the couch and waited.
“Yeah,” Draco said, letting out a soft laugh, “things are much better. She’s become very enthusiastic about trying to match me up with men.”
Harry and Draco followed Laoise into the house, and Harry nearly sighed in relief as warmth from the radiators and fire in the hearth began to seep into his numb fingertips.
that, then.”
Harry looked to Hermione, who let out a resigned sigh and said, “Well, I suppose it could be worse. See you in a bit, Harry.”
Draco took a step back before sinking to his knees. The sight alone nearly sent Harry over the edge, having wishfully played this scene over and over in his head for the past few weeks. He’d never thought that they would actually be here, in his flat, having sex.
“They’re beautiful,” Draco murmured.
“No,” Hermione said, shaking her head. “It’s only a quarter to seven, although I expect Molly will be getting up any minute.”
“Good,” Draco huffed, leaning forward to pick up the takeaway menu from the coffee table before leaning back into the couch. “Now, let’s order some food to celebrate my win, shall we?”
"Last Thursday? I thought I was at my office last Thursday."
Yet the conversation she just overheard...him...what was actually happening? Who was him?
He couldn't remember the last time he felt this happy. Teddy could come home now.
-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-
"Don't worry, Hermione, I'll take care of it as usual. Just tell me if anything turns up in your research."
-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-
And Draco couldn't agree more.
Silently, he followed Harry to his bedroom.
"Scorp, what's wrong?"
He hoped his voice was strong and confident, because he couldn't feel any more than that.
He burrowed his face into his son's hair.
And Hermione believed him rather than me' was left unspoken. It was still a sore point with Harry.
For the first time, there was a bit of doubt in his mind.
The voice was cold. Draco forced himself to concentrate and observe Granger better. She looked as rumpled as he felt. And she was angry; he could see it in her eyes.
"Draco, darling."
With a sudden insight, Draco realized that on some level of her consciousness, Granger must have known that Harry had changed. She just didn't want to admit it, choosing to turn a blind eye instead. He wondered what kind of justification she had used to convince herself.
"Do you think I wanted this?" Harry asked.
Unfortunately, they both knew that he only has one answer in the end.
Damn that media! He had tried to shelter his kids from the news about circumstances surrounding their mother's death. Only, when you were Harry Potter and even your favorite color was front page material, there was no way around it.
"Look, you know that I have been skirting on the legal line to pass our proposals. You know that it was necessary."
"Hermione. What have you told her?" Harry pronounced Hermione's name slowly, as if Draco wouldn't understand it otherwise.
"It is not enough, though. I loved Ginny and she died. I loved Teddy and the Ministry took him away," Harry said bitterly, flopping down to sit beside Dumbledore again.
The voice felt too patronizing for Harry's liking. It was not the tone of a person who believed. It reminded him of the tone one used to pacify an angry beast that refused to see reason, but was too dangerous to be opposed directly.
The dream had begun almost like a memory. There he was, dueling with Voldemort. Only then, when he finally killed the other Wizard, the snake-like face changed into his own.
The words cut through his rumination and shocked him to the core. He had been careful. How much did she know? Was it an unfortunate coincidence? Did she somehow know it since the beginning, smart as she was? Well, at least he could discount the possibility of Harry trapping him, he thought humorlessly. Harry was, after all, the one who had told him that if Draco told anybody, Harry's friends and Draco's family included, about the nature of his job, Harry would personally make his life more of a living hell than it was.
"Oh?" asked Dumbledore, lifting one of his eyebrows.
Apparently when you're fourteen, forty was ancient.
Some were in it for the thrill of power it gave them. The Malfoys had been powerful once, the cream of the society. It gave them satisfaction to see the heir catering to their every desire, letting them do whatever they wanted to him.
"Tell me Granger, you have always said that it was wrong to hate Muggles and Muggleborns because their existence and blood status are not their fault. Then, is it Scorpius' fault to be born as my son? Do you know why Astoria left us? She said that she couldn't put up with it any longer, that her father was right, love alone is not enough. It is romantic, of course, but faced with reality of no money and practically being a social outcast..."
"I don't think the Wizengamot will pass this one, Harry."
"Malfoy."
"What game are you playing at?"
"Pull the other one, Malfoy. I see you still have your house-elves."
"Why don't you ask Potter instead of me?"
He smirked, seeing the gray eyes become dull once again.
The Greengrasses were not rich, but they were old, and their reputation was fairly untainted by the Voldemort scandal. The Brookses were said to have hailed from Merlin's own time, and if the wedding of their daughter was any indicator, they were awfully rich. Compared to them, the Radleys were new money. The grandfather had made his fortune through trade and the father, the current member of the Wizengamot, had started from the bottom at the Ministry. Still they were no less influential than the others. In fact, they were a kind of de facto leader for the younger generation in the Wizengamot. If all three of them rejected it, there was no way the others would agree with the proposal.
"I just got the news. They will present it for voting when the Wizengamot convenes."
Harry never knew, before his and Malfoy's agreement, he could be drunk on power. Even killing Voldemort hadn't made him feel like this. He felt hot and excited. He supposed it was like getting drunk on firewhisky, only better and without the hangover.
Draco no longer believed that the world would give him whatever he desired. He knew that the other man wouldn't feel the same for him, couldn't even stand him, for that matter. Weren't his current circumstances solid proof of that? Harry would never use any of his friends like he used Draco.
"Tell me, what will happen to your mother if I stop my endorsement and tell St. Mungos to just abandon her, hmm? And what happens to your dear family if you stop earning galleons?"
He hoped his voice was strong and confident, because he couldn't feel any more than that.
Then, before Draco could say anything, Harry silenced him with a kiss.
Draco shivered. Harry was smirking and there was malice in his voice.
"The healer said that I am getting better and can come home soon. I can hardly wait."
Ex-Death Eaters like him, a voice in his mind reminded him.
From where she was, she couldn't see his face and he wore a hooded coat to cover his hair. He knocked at the door and waited for a few moments before it opened to show her the head of Department of Magical Games and Sports, Abelard Raith.
He could see that she was grasping on her last reason. She knew he was right, but she didn't want to accept it, since it would mean that Harry was the one at fault.
"So, we agreed, didn't we?"
"They mocked me," the answer finally came, so soft and quiet that Draco was forced to strain his hearing to catch it.
His mind ran back to his conversation with Dumbledore - whom he was no longer sure was only a figment of his imagination.
He took another big gulp.
"What's the difference? They let the Death Eaters go. They put away those that were infected by Werewolves or even those that they suspected as infected. The Ministry was still practically owned by the same people and groups."
Yet again, he was a failure, wasn't he? He had nothing to offer her. Her friends started to distance themselves once they realized she had neither money nor influence anymore. He couldn't buy her clothes and jewels or take her out for dinner. In fact, the few times she did go out, people jeered and sneered at her.
The question was merely a formality, they both knew that. Draco had been briefed by the healers about her condition.
"I have a bad enough day without a figment of my imagination giving me lectures," Harry grumbled.
"Don't fake innocent now. I saw you with the Head of Department of Magical Games and Sports. He kissed you and called you slut."
"Don't fake innocent now. I saw you with the Head of Department of Magical Games and Sports. He kissed you and called you slut."
Being friends with her for years helped him to realize that she was beyond furious at that moment. Her eyes were bright and her face was flushed. He rarely saw her worked up this badly.
Draco tried to answer, but he couldn't find his voice, so he just nodded instead.
"How are you today?"
Harry would let him take a bath, he knew. Then, they would have sex. Draco wouldn't pretend that it was something else. They would do it fast - no foreplay, no tender whispers. But somehow, the fact that it was Harry's body, Harry's hands, made it somewhat better. Even if it was nothing for Harry but a convenience sex, even if Harry didn't care, he could pretend.
"You could have told somebody."
"This is justice," Harry said, his voice steady, hard.
"Influenced him?"
"Draco, darling."
"You were Slytherins, Malfoy. I believe that you are capable of collecting evidence against Harry."
"I think you misunderstand me, Malfoy. I am not giving you a choice." There was a smirk on Harry's lips. Somehow, no matter how many times Draco had seen it, it still struck him as wrong. There should never be a smirk on Harry's lips.
"Do you know how it feels, Granger, to have hands pawing all over you, to not be able to say no even if you don't like it? Do you know how it feels to just lie down and take all the humiliations you are subjected to, to obey like a pet, knowing all the while that there is nothing you can do?"
They just wanted to keep a leash on him.
"I'm sorry," he said, startling the other man.
Raith took the other's face in his hands then and forced the hooded man to look up, causing his hood to fall down.
"Don't worry, Hermione, I'll take care of it as usual. Just tell me if anything turns up in your research."
Then there was the nightmare last night. Even remembering it gave him shivers.
"I want you to be happy, Harry."
"Look Hermione, what should I do? You know how it was. I had tried to convince the people in power, to argue with them. It didn't work. This works. They get what they want, someone who can be used to realize their fantasies and won't talk about them, and we get what we want, their support for our proposals. And if it failed, there is always blackmail. We can change the Ministry without war."
Yes, he was powerless, but not totally useless. He would take care of his family, even if he lost his dignity and self worth in the process. He would dance to Potter's tune. He would make sure that his mother would get the treatment she deserved; no matter what the cost he would have to pay.
From this up close, he could see there were tears in the corners of her eyes.
"Like I said, you have been looking up for too long, Granger. Do you know how people treat ex-Death Eaters these days? Do you know that my mother was hexed by one of your so-called-Light supporters? She was shopping in Diagon Alley, you know. She disturbed no one. They just came and hexed her and your beloved ministry wouldn't even bestow sufficient effort to investigate it."
"You are late, slut."
No wonder Snape had always seemed so sour.
Being friends with her for years helped him to realize that she was beyond furious at that moment. Her eyes were bright and her face was flushed. He rarely saw her worked up this badly.
Walking around the table to the blond's side, Harry bent down and captured Malfoy's pointy chin in his fingers. He waited until Malfoy's gaze turned to him before he spoke.
Their misconceptions seemed to reside on the other end of the scale. Instead of a harmless old man, to them he was an incredibly powerful, possibly dangerous wizard.
"Hermione, we won! They passed it! They passed The Werewolves Protection Act! See? It is in the Prophet."
"Can we meet again? For a drink?" He asked, hesitantly. He knew, oh he knew Harry would say no but he could not prevent himself to ask for all the gold in Gringotts.
"Potter, please..."
Worse, he realized that there were way too many skeletons in the Malfoy closet. There was a lot of fodder for insult and mockery that even an unimaginative child could easily dig up.
"Last Thursday? I thought I was at my office last Thursday."
"Influenced him?"
Some teachers, like Remus or Minerva, had told him stories that made teaching seemed like a noble, much needed, and incredible profession. You got the chance to change a student's life. You, as their mentor, could help determine the course that those youngsters would take during their life.
Worse, he was not even a Werewolf. He had been examined, after all, and declared not infected.
There was nothing he could do, was there? Harry should know what Granger on a mission was like.
Hermione flinched involuntary when she saw Raith's hand stroke out and slap the hooded man. The sound resonated loudly.
It had begun as another taunt. If he were to be honest, he had believed that Malfoy had said the truth: he worked for Harry because he had no other option. He had bluffed when he said that Malfoy loved him.
"I need money. You know that, Potter."
"Don't bring Harry into this. You must have influenced him somehow."
She sighed.
Somehow, this raised Harry's ire further. Subconsciously, he knew that was only a dream, but he felt like he was fifteen again, standing in headmaster's office. It was as if he could feel Dumbledore's disagreement and disappointment through the simple gesture.
Yet, it was already established that Draco Malfoy was an idiot, wasn't it?
Absently, he wondered whether his own son had gone to bed. He wanted to see Scorpius, but he couldn't bring himself to go home just yet. He couldn't stand the thought of going home to his family like that, smelling of sex and other men.
"What game are you playing at?"
His second guess was that Draco had used some kind of potion to bend the will of his victims. He was still hopeful about finding proof for this one.
"Yes, nobody else wants you, Malfoy. After all, you just have one skill, don't you? And it is to open your legs for everyone who pays."
Draco lifted his face and stared at her incredulously.
"It is the Werewolf Act." Hermione grinned and Harry suddenly noticed that she had a lot of books and scrolls in her arms.
Harry shouted out the words the moment he arrived at her house. He didn't give her any time to answer either, opting to envelop her in a hug instead.
Unfortunately, they both knew that he only has one answer in the end.
Sometimes, he wished that his family hadn't followed that mad man, that his father had taken a different course in life. He wished that his mother had not gone out alone on that blasted day to Diagon Alley. If she had taken somebody with her, maybe that Muggleborn wouldn't have hexed her and instead of depending on potions, she would be the healthy, determined woman he had known. Most of all, he wished that he was not so powerless.
"Maybe. My father was surely a Death Eater, no point of denying that. But I never wanted to be one."
"Sometimes I felt like I don't know you anymore, Harry," she said, standing in front of him.
But a few steps later Harry stopped and looked back at him.
-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.--.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-
"Funny, Hermione said the same thing to me today."
“Not in the manor,” Draco agreed. “We will hunt a house together. Ours,” he added. Something that was untainted with their history and with the invisible, but hard to erase line that dividing dark and light sides -- something that would be a new start for them.
"Oh? Oh? That's the only word you can say, Harry James Potter?" Hermione raised her voice.
He twirled the glass of firewhisky in his hand.
"Just come in first." Harry smiled, trying to assuage Malfoy's fear.
Just like he had never noticed how beautiful they were, bags and dark circles and all. He had, he realized, never taken the time to appreciate the body in front of him.
-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-
When something caught her attention, Hermione could become so animated, hands moving and face glowing.
"And you are lucky that fine is the worst of it. You all deserve to rot in Azkaban if you ask me."
Draco had imagined coming home to Scorpius' smiling face. Instead, he was welcomed by a teary eyed kid.
And she wouldn't, would she? They all were so righteous, the so-called-Light-Side, so quick to point fingers, except of course, at themselves.
Fear crept into Harry's heart. Did that mean Hermione knew about the method he employed to pass their proposals?
Yes, Harry Potter had found himself wondering more and more about his reasons to come back to Hogwarts.
Draco wondered how fucked up it was, that even after everything, he was still in love with his jailer.
Draco lifted one of his eyebrows in response to this strange statement. He couldn't remember a time when he refused his own father's offers either to smoothen his way or clean up his mess.
Yes, he was too cowardly to kill, wasn't he? But he was also too much of a bigoted jerk for him to defect to the light side. Draco Malfoy, always a failure.
And he had tried. He had knocked almost every door at Diagon Alley, had applied for anything and everything, including for positions as a waiter or a shop-assistant. Nobody wanted to hire an ex-Death Eater.
Harry shook his head. He couldn't lose hope. After all, the proposal, when it passed into law, would bring Teddy back to them.
To this day, he heavily suspected that somehow Draco had Imperiused everyone there: for they all had unanimously agreed to place him as the Deputy Headmaster. The only downside to this theory was that nobody had successfully Imperiused that many people at the same time.
"And what? Have my mother evicted from St. Mungos? Have no money to feed my family?"
He still could feel the old man's greedy hands pawing at him, his forceful lips at his. He still could hear his mocking voice in his ears.
Unfortunately, it also brought back the thoughts about what he had been reduced to do to provide it, and worse, what he was cornered to do.
Harry jumped up and turned around to face the older wizard.
"Hermione? What's wrong?"
"Why did you come, Hermione? Not that you have to have a reason to do so, you know," he said with a weak smile.
-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-
Somehow, this raised Harry's ire further. Subconsciously, he knew that was only a dream, but he felt like he was fifteen again, standing in headmaster's office. It was as if he could feel Dumbledore's disagreement and disappointment through the simple gesture.
"I was looking for you last Thursday," she said.
"My idea? My idea?"
There was nothing he could do, was there? Harry should know what Granger on a mission was like.
"I am not. If you must know, then yes, I am a whore and Potter is my pimp."
-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-
The sound of footsteps snapped her back to reality. She darted away, her business with him forgotten.
Of course, as a student, he had not spared much thought about his teachers – and he did have a convenient excuse for that: what with fighting Voldemort and all. Yet, finally, as a teacher, he saw the glaring truth: teaching was a troublesome profession in which half of the time you wanted to strangle your students.
"The road to hell was paved with good intentions Harry."
So it was Dumbledore's turn today.
For a while, he entertained the thought of going back to his office, but then decided against it. The office was far from sanctuary for him. He had never bothered to re-decorate the place since becoming Headmaster, and never had the heart to throw away what bits and pieces both Minerva and Dumbledore had left behind. The room reflected more of its previous occupants' tastes rather than his own.
And Draco couldn't agree more.
Hermione brought her hands to her mouth, trying to stifle her gasp.
"Pull the other one, Malfoy. I see you still have your house-elves."
"Honestly Hermione, you made it seem like a big deal."
How could Harry ask this of him? Didn't Harry know that by doing this, Draco would virtually hand his family over to Azkaban himself?
"Do you know how it feels, Granger, to have hands pawing all over you, to not be able to say no even if you don't like it? Do you know how it feels to just lie down and take all the humiliations you are subjected to, to obey like a pet, knowing all the while that there is nothing you can do?"
"Just come in first." Harry smiled, trying to assuage Malfoy's fear.
"Hermione. What have you told her?" Harry pronounced Hermione's name slowly, as if Draco wouldn't understand it otherwise.
He took another big gulp.
"I can sell myself to Muggles. After all, it seems like it's the only thing I am good for, right?" said Malfoy, bowing his head.
Draco was opening his mouth. Harry didn't know what he would say, and he realized he didn't care.
He couldn't make his parents proud. He couldn't even save them from Voldemort's punishment. He was the worst son there was.
Draco's worry grew by the second. Scorpius, he knew, was not a brave kid by any means. It seemed that cowardice was indeed a Malfoy trait. Still, he was also not a kid that would easily cry, even if it was pride that stalled the tears instead of endurance.
How could Harry ask this of him? Didn't Harry know that by doing this, Draco would virtually hand his family over to Azkaban himself?
"It is no use." The drawled voice from his side shouldn't surprise Harry like it did. "Thinking, I mean. But, well, you're always one for a lost cause, aren't you?"
That realization shocked him. He couldn't believe it. After all, he never gave any reason for Malfoy to feel that way towards him. Or maybe, maybe Malfoy had nurtured the crush before Harry offered him the job?
A few moments later Hermione was standing in his living room. She seemed happy, Harry thought. Yet there were lines of worry around her eyes.
"Do you know that St. Mungos refused to admit my mother before Potter practically ordered them to do so? Or that Scorpius has been bullied for being a Malfoy?"
"Just take it easy, okay?" Draco smiled and took Narcissa's frail hand in his own. Then impulsively he added, "Don't worry, I'll take care of everything,"
Still, Harry knew, all was not lost. After all, he did have a secret weapon, wasn't he?
Draco wondered what had happened. The last time they saw each other had been two years ago at Ginny Weasley's funeral, and the only thing he did lately was Harry's dirty jobs, which he was under impression she knew nothing about.
Ginny. His Ginny. The Auror who found her told him that she'd bled to death. Sectumsempra. Her killer didn't want her to simply die, but to suffer and then die.
And Hermione believed him rather than me' was left unspoken. It was still a sore point with Harry.
Her face was becoming paler but Draco couldn't stop himself.
"It's fine. I will talk with your teacher tomorrow"
He had already had a horrible day, he definitely did not need a Malfoy on top of that, thank you very much. Especially if said Malfoy was hell bent on making it worse.
Yes, he was powerless, but not totally useless. He would take care of his family, even if he lost his dignity and self worth in the process. He would dance to Potter's tune. He would make sure that his mother would get the treatment she deserved; no matter what the cost he would have to pay.
The dream had begun almost like a memory. There he was, dueling with Voldemort. Only then, when he finally killed the other Wizard, the snake-like face changed into his own.
-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-
"I'm hurt! How can you think so little of my Slytherins? Unlike Gryffindor, they can find the truth without me holding their hands."
"Will it work?"
Then there was the nightmare last night. Even remembering it gave him shivers.
There was no answer. Harry thought it was discouraging that Dumbledore, or his imagination, couldn't provide any guarantee about it.
It should not be like this, he thought bitterly. They had saved the Wizarding world, hadn't they? They had earned their happily ever after. Or maybe he should just stop being a fool.
Malfoy lifted his face and looked up. Harry thought that Malfoy's eyes looked like a brewing storm and if he were to concentrate, Harry fancied seeing all the sorrow, anger and hate swirling in their gray orbs.
"Do you know that St. Mungos refused to admit my mother before Potter practically ordered them to do so? Or that Scorpius has been bullied for being a Malfoy?"
"How are you today?"
Then everything faded into black.
"You are disappointed." The tone was gentler, calmer, like a parent who tried to coax his child to say more. Yet Harry held his silence. Dumbledore sighed.
The Greengrasses were not rich, but they were old, and their reputation was fairly untainted by the Voldemort scandal. The Brookses were said to have hailed from Merlin's own time, and if the wedding of their daughter was any indicator, they were awfully rich. Compared to them, the Radleys were new money. The grandfather had made his fortune through trade and the father, the current member of the Wizengamot, had started from the bottom at the Ministry. Still they were no less influential than the others. In fact, they were a kind of de facto leader for the younger generation in the Wizengamot. If all three of them rejected it, there was no way the others would agree with the proposal.
So, after defeating Voldemort, thus fulfilling his purpose on life, and finishing his education - which admittedly was more to stop Hermione's nagging than because of any desire on his own part - he felt unfocused. Adrift.
"Oh, Harry."
Draco didn't deign to answer him, opening the door instead. What was the use of an answer, anyway? He'd already given his opinion. There was no way he would sell out his family.
Suddenly, Draco felt angry. How could she demand him to tell her what his game was? How dare she come uninvited into his house, throwing accusations at him!
Perhaps the old man was right; he had to change before he fell any further. Perhaps it was not too late for him to be happy again.
"Some days, I think the war was all in vain," he added bitterly, averting his eyes and looking at the ground.
She deserved better, Harry thought. She deserved more respect than what she got, she deserved more recognition. She should have risen through the ranks of the Ministry, instead of being lumped with dull, tedious work. She scared the higher ups, he knew, with her tenacity and spirit for change and ability. One day...
He should have realized that it would make Harry hate him more.
"Maybe. My father was surely a Death Eater, no point of denying that. But I never wanted to be one."
"And you will help me persuade the Wizengamot to pass the Werewolf Protection Law?"
He had woken up from that one with a scream, scaring his children.
Harry was, if he were honest, really curious. As far as he knew, and Malfoy had admitted it as well, Malfoy had neither another source nor prospect of income.
The voice felt too patronizing for Harry's liking. It was not the tone of a person who believed. It reminded him of the tone one used to pacify an angry beast that refused to see reason, but was too dangerous to be opposed directly.
Yeah, Harry Potter often wondered why he had returned to Hogwarts.
"Oh?" asked Dumbledore, lifting one of his eyebrows.
That was the truth, if not the entire truth.
Malfoy looked like a mess. His eyes were rimmed red and there were dark pouches below them. His skin was paler than usual. Even his hair was limp.
Harry gritted his teeth.
"Look Hermione, what should I do? You know how it was. I had tried to convince the people in power, to argue with them. It didn't work. This works. They get what they want, someone who can be used to realize their fantasies and won't talk about them, and we get what we want, their support for our proposals. And if it failed, there is always blackmail. We can change the Ministry without war."
"They won't. They are not ex-Death Eaters, are they?"
"I am sorry," said the other man, his voice low.
Draco wondered what had happened. The last time they saw each other had been two years ago at Ginny Weasley's funeral, and the only thing he did lately was Harry's dirty jobs, which he was under impression she knew nothing about.
"You have been looking up for too long, Granger. Are you forgetting about the heavy fine the Ministry exacted from the ex-Death Eaters?"
Still, if he refused, what would become of his family? Without the money Harry gave him -- for services rendered, his mind reminded him, without Harry's throwing around his weight at St. Mungo, his family was as good as doom anyway.
He couldn't make his parents proud. He couldn't even save them from Voldemort's punishment. He was the worst son there was.
They took the light from her eyes like they took her from him. And that ungrateful Malfoy, how dare he to refuse, to argue? Death Eaters had to be punished for what they did. They killed and plundered, and then they pretended to repent, but how could one change what was rotten to the core?
After a few large gulps, he started to feel better. Draco always said that he had a plebeian taste, but there was nothing like Firewhisky at the end of a difficult day.
"Perverted? If any of us is a pervert, it is your precious Potter. Do you think I like it? You can't even imagine the depth of depravity the so-called upstanding wizards can think up when they've got closed rooms and a carte blanche to do whatever they want to do."
"Albus and James are with Molly, and Lily is sleeping upstairs. She is running a big fever. Last night, well, she had that nightmare again."
Besides, when he put things there, somehow they often ended up broken, like the glass broom-riding figure Mrs. Weasley had given him, or the pottery pieces Ginny had brought back from her Quidditch trip to Africa.
It was warm inside, and Draco knew that Harry must have sent his children to the Burrow. Harry would have known that Draco would come that night.
"You have been looking up for too long, Granger. Are you forgetting about the heavy fine the Ministry exacted from the ex-Death Eaters?"
"I will."
It made him cold inside, to know that she knew what he was, but he refused to show her that. His pride, battered and tattered as it was, apparently was still alive.
Silently, he sent an apology to Dumbledore.
"It must be nice living in your rose-tinted world, Granger," he said bitterly.
The words seemed rehearsed. Clearly, Malfoy had thought it over.
She had been head over heels with him when they were graduating from Hogwarts - ending her seventh and his eight years there. Her father had told her that if she was determined to ally herself with the Malfoys, then she could forget her inheritance. She was young, though, and she chose him.
Still, Harry knew, all was not lost. After all, he did have a secret weapon, wasn't he?
“Not in your manor,” Harry countered.
He was not stupid. He knew why they wanted him, each of them. Some were so firmly locked away in the closet, that the notion of wanting a man would send them running and screaming. But Draco looked like his mother, didn't he? After all, he inherited her silky locks and big eyes.
Not for the first time Harry thought that he had a fucked up imagination.
She refused to back down, to move. Instead, she stood up as well and glared at him.
"You love me, don't you?"
They would stop at Fortescue's afterwards. He never chose the same flavor twice, determined to taste each and every one of them, but Ginny always had a strawberry sundae.
As if Azkaban was the only punishment. As if the world just consisted of ex-Death Eaters and not ex-Death Eaters who lead mutually exclusive existences.
-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.--.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-
Harry said nothing. Instead, he cocked one eyebrow and waited.
"I'll say it is better than to be raised by Death Eaters."
"So in sum, all fractions have reasons to reject the proposal."
Draco shook his head, trying to chase the thoughts away.
"She put it all together by herself."
"Harry? Can I come through?" A voice from the Floo, accompanied by his friend's bushy head, broke his rumination.
"Funny, Hermione said the same thing to me today."
"Oh."
Hermione almost didn't hear those words spoken. It was a crescent moon that night and there were no street lamps around, but she would recognize that whitish golden hair anywhere.
Unfortunately, the new Harry was not. Harry used to be the boy hero who saw everything through rose tinted glasses. Only, Draco knew that the rose tinted glasses had long ago been lost and broken. So maybe Harry really did think that ex-Death Eaters were nothing but dirt.
The proposal had been prompted by Teddy. Teddy. Just thinking about him brought the pain a new. The ministry had declared him dangerous and taken him away from them not long after the war was over. Harry had tried. Andromeda had tried. Even the Weasleys had tried. Yet nobody could find out where they had taken him, or even if he were still alive.
Harry thought that maybe in his mind, King Cross had become an equivalent of the Mirror of Erised.
The room was relatively bare, with white walls and white floor. Once upon a time, Draco knew, this would have been a massive, comfortable bedroom with flower arrangements everywhere from colleagues trying to ingratiate themselves for his parents' favor. Yet the bed in the room was the normal, standard issue of St. Mungos, and the only flower arrangement was the small bunch of roses on the bedside table that Draco had brought with him. At least, Draco tried to console himself, it was a private room.
"The road to hell was paved with good intentions Harry."
Yet some wanted him simply because he was convenient. They knew he wouldn't talk and he wouldn't say no. His shivering became worse and Draco knew the shivers were not only because of the rain.
"And I thought you, Gryffindors, should be the fair and compassionate ones. I was a bully, Granger, not a killer. Even if you are so sure that I deserve it, can you honestly tell me that my mother does? Does she deserve to suffer for her husband and son's sins?"
Draco had thought that something like love surely could bring no shame. He also had thought that there was no way he could feel more miserable. He was wrong on both counts.
Then, before Draco could say anything, Harry silenced him with a kiss.
Then there was that new finding. A Mediwizard who had researched about lycanthropy for years had announced that lycanthropy -- contrary to the old belief -- could come out later in life. It could lay dormant for years, only to be triggered into existence later on. A kid whose parents were infected could be declared normal, only to transform into a Werewolf later on.
-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-
"I will."
"I also overheard what you were talking about."
Harry shook his head.
"No," Draco said, "I won't do it." Though his voice was small, there was no hesitation.
Draco's worry grew by the second. Scorpius, he knew, was not a brave kid by any means. It seemed that cowardice was indeed a Malfoy trait. Still, he was also not a kid that would easily cry, even if it was pride that stalled the tears instead of endurance.
“We’re already living together,” Harry pointed out. A totally dumb response, in Draco’s not-humble-at-all opinion, but he did not want to break the mood by hitting Harry’s stomach with his elbow.
"Don't blame me for your perverted tendency, Malfoy,"
"I can't believe this is you, Harry."
Dumbledore turned and looked Harry in the eye.
In reply, Harry opened the door wider and let him enter.
Harry felt the wetness of tears at the corner of his eyes.
The words cut through his rumination and shocked him to the core. He had been careful. How much did she know? Was it an unfortunate coincidence? Did she somehow know it since the beginning, smart as she was? Well, at least he could discount the possibility of Harry trapping him, he thought humorlessly. Harry was, after all, the one who had told him that if Draco told anybody, Harry's friends and Draco's family included, about the nature of his job, Harry would personally make his life more of a living hell than it was.
It was a protection for werewolves bitten against their will, which was most of them. It established their rights as citizens, admitted that they were not simply mindless, dark creatures. Harry's proposal demanded the Ministry provide counselors to help families cope with their new situation, a guarantee of employment, and free wolfsbane potion.
"I was looking for you last Thursday," she said.
Harry sighed.
"Harry?" Draco asked, looking unsure that he had heard correctly.
No, he knew the law would do nothing to help kids like Scorpius. On the contrary, letting people put ex-Death Eaters away without a fair trial, both for real and imaginary offences would leave his son practically an orphan.
"It must be nice living in your rose-tinted world, Granger," he said bitterly.
"He set Hermione against me."
"Nothing."
Narcissa lifted her face from the book she was reading and upon seeing who her visitor was, smiled.
Why couldn't he make anybody see it? He just wanted to make it right. Maybe his methods were not always perfect, but in the big picture, it was nothing, wasn't it? The end, after all, justified the mean.
"I take it that it went well."
"I don't think you believe it."
"You are late, slut."
"Harry?" Draco asked, looking unsure that he had heard correctly.
Back at his quarters much later than usual, Harry was commiserating more and more with Snape each day (surely a sign that he had gone crazy). The students should know better than to procure a detention, thus force him to spend many miserable hours supervising them in a cold classroom, rather than reclining on his couch with his half-read Muggle Detective novel.
"What they said is true after all. This is a Death Eater family," Scorpius whispered, but Draco felt like he was punched in the stomach.
It had taken the ministry an entire year to decide whether the request was worth presenting to be voted on by the Wizengamot. He had thought that maybe he would have to give them more bribes.
"Why don't you ask Potter instead of me?"
Draco hid his face in his hand. He couldn't believe he just poured out his soul to Granger of all people. Maybe the loneliness had gotten to him. His old friends, after all, either in Azkaban, death, or didn't want anything to do with him anymore.
The words were said in a confused tone, but Draco knew it was only a front. Dread started to spread inside him. Harry knew, or at least, he suspected something.
"You are not happy. Tell me what's wrong, Hermione."
"Maybe Hermione could come up with new ideas. You will never need to do it again, I promise. Maybe we can put up a fund raising event. Just please, stay."
"You have no choice and you know it."
They were all the same - powerful, respectable men with a taste for illusions.
Afterwards, the dream-world morphed into another where he sat on a throne-like chair on a raised platform. In front of him, there was a Wizard being tortured. He could see his friends, standing on the sidelines, averting their eyes.
"I am. I am happy."
"The healer said that I am getting better and can come home soon. I can hardly wait."
"Don't you understand what this will do to my family, Potter? This new law you want will doom us! People will accuse us of crimes out of spite and revenge, and they won't even verify the truth before they gleefully cart all of us to Azkaban!"
"Potter...Harry..."
"Don't you understand what this will do to my family, Potter? This new law you want will doom us! People will accuse us of crimes out of spite and revenge, and they won't even verify the truth before they gleefully cart all of us to Azkaban!"
Yet, it was already established that Draco Malfoy was an idiot, wasn't it?
That was another truth, wasn't it? Even for Harry, who used to be a bleeding heart Gryffindor, even for the man that he had fallen in love with despite everything, he was just a body to be used.
"You let me believe that it was your status as Voldemort's slayer that you were using; that and maybe a bit of blackmail that you gathered by digging out their secrets. You never told me that you were trading flesh as well!"
