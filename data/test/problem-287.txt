Albus Dumbledore was in the midst of finishing the last of his ministry paperwork and penning a note to Peter Pettigrew, feeling slightly tired however he was about to get up from his desk and turn in for the night, when a flash of the floo alerted him to something potentially grave, he quickly banished his piles of work for later use and steeped his fingers, focusing on the floo grate, all drowsiness evaporated when James appeared in his grate wearing a deep scowl 'has he figured my plans out already?' Dumbledore thought in irritation though proceeded to wear an indulgent grand-fatherly smile "James my boy! What can I do for you and Lily at this late hour?".
Albus shot him a searching look as he said this, Remus could only nod as he turned to pick up the child, "Sirius has gone to the ministry as you requested he has Peter too, the Rat decided to play the lier and tried to run from arrest, he is now to be interrogated for the possible involvement of the Potter's murder, I hope for his sake he did not betray us" he said in quiet rage, carrying Harry to sit directly opposite the headmaster, "Do you know what happened?, did Sirius or Severus give you a full report?" Remus tiredly replied, his eyes reverting back to his calm deep brown as he sighed, lifting Harry to rest on his arms, discreetly casting a wordless Finite Incantatum on the boy in his hands, who's wings at least reverted back and an explosion of magical power flowed off his form, instantly Remus eyes narrowed "You have some explaining to do Dumbledore if a mere finite could remove the blocks placed in his mind and magic, it was no obscure Dark spell as you just said!" He growled as he pointed his wand at the man, "Remus you best lower your wand, it would not do well to accuse me and attempt to hold me at wand point" Albus said leaving the unspoken deadly threat lying within his deep blue gaze.
Lily screamed even louder at this, the pain of the counter curse fixing the damage as fast as the contractions came was too much to bare, she feared her son will be still born and her dead if something didn't give soon, James just stood there watching in despair or at least as much as a natural vampire could show his human counterpart.
Osiris nodded knowing denying the knowledge would lead to his death and as the last of his particular clan he truly did not want to end his bloodline despite the pain it will cause him through his bond now residing with Harry.
"All I can ask is why Severus? You never liked or trusted the man and he notorious for his hate of children, what tricked you into conceding Harry to them?" Remus asked, "He actually knows what he's doing with James's son, He loved Lily and I heard him vow his oath to protect him and cast vengeance on the culprit, Snape would have been here to get him if I wasn't asked to come here to get you myself to look after Harry whilst we prepare to necessities for their bonding, as you know it will turn that Snarky bastard into a lower born vampire when he does this and he seemed to be willing to do this for the boy despite the social issue's" Sirius then went on to explain the event's he witnessed and the discussion with the headmaster, leaving a stunned silence in his wake before leaving for Gringotts to speak to the goblins and file the necessary change in circumstances and Potter vault privileges and then register the boy's existence as both carrier of dark creature blood and subsequent adoption of him to one Severus Snape later that evening.
In no time at all he was face to face with his assigned case manager Bogrod, who stood eyeing him impatiently, "Sirius Arctureous Black, godfather of one Harold James Potter, I have come to change his legal Guardianship and His vault access to a Mr Severus Snape and Hogwarts School Of Witchcraft And Wizardry, effective immediately" Sirius stated evenly.
It took everything Harry had to quell the sudden impulses of his new nature, to not sap the gifts within the feast before him, 'they do not deserve to die after all' he thought to himself, even as the malnutrition pain settled deep into his bones as if it was his new and only food source and was being denied.
"Well Harry I believe I should formally welcome you into the family despite what Lucius may say about it, I will not deny my son the chance of happiness, will you guarantee all his needs are met son?"
Griphook met him half way "Mr Potter do you have your key for verification? Before we adjourn to my office?" He grinned at Harry slightly as the key was tossed into his small palm "Very good, that will be all Ironfang, come Mr Potter we have documents to sign and much to discuss!".
Albus paled as soon as he saw it, opting to scan the article written by Rita Skeeter quickly, entitled Boy-Who-Dies?
"Sire you say? I can think of only one child at present that would be a dark creature and would need a change of legal guardian, let me guess the person you have down there is Sirius Black asking for a change of ward for the Potter boy?" He said with a slight smile, 'this was not how this was meant to go, what is with his nice reaction? Isn't he meant to be wanting to find out where the child is to slay it?' She thought aghast.
It seemed Harry survived the curse meant for him, how was anyone's guess but he had and with nothing but dried blood and a crushing scar admist his forehead 'He defeated the Dark Lord..' Severus could only gape at the little irate being before him, 'how did this child survive a organ rupture curse and rebound it? His father fell to it too easily downstairs, what the fuck is he..' after some deliberation Severus picked the boy up, unclasped his billowing cape and wrapped the screaming boy in it to keep him warm, all the while taking every inch of him in, he noted the boy look every inch her son with his fiery red hair and wings which now he thought of it 'Wasn't this boy black haired? It was only yesterday I saw this brat how the hell did he suddenly become a carbon copy of his mother in such a space of time? A potion? Unless he was a metermorph like little miss Tonks it didn't make sense, but we didn't see any signs except his high magical strength yesterday..' he mused, while watching the boy, determined to ignore the stench of the bodies in the room as if on instinct to stop him breaking down into insanity as he feared he would later on if he stayed there.
He walked briskly towards the residential district of the alley, watching for signs of any potential Death Eaters attempting to attack the milling occupants out of the corner of his eye as he scanned the door numbers he past in search for his friends domicile.
The evaluation of Harry is interrupted by members of the Guardian Council giving rise to an interesting turn of events, Dumbledore is certainly furious.
"Pulchritudo Sanguis Ligatis! Subscriptio Exponentia Irritanda Destinauit! There his signature will now be hidden and his glamour is blood bound so only those of his blood can remove it or the caster" he said as he put the sleeping child back into his cot and waited patiently with Dumbledore for Sirius's return.
Dedalus stared at the little one in question for a minute before giving a nod "Marvellous, now Remus could you do me a favour and lay him into the cot beside the headmaster I need to do a quick few tests on him, it won't hurt him you have my word, we just need to ascertain his current physical and psychological development especially being a new born, we also need to gauge the boys power level before we talk with Professor Snape about his intentions and suitability before we discuss adoption logistics and ritual should things be all in order!"
'She seems to think I'm a monster, well we can't deny I must make the sound, hard choices against such predators regardless of their age, though James was always an outstanding Auror as was his wife, so I can't allow the pure blood line to perish so easily without first observing young Mr Potter especially if backed by Albus, he may be as strong as his parents if he is indeed such a rare creature, I would prefer to protect it depending on the outcome, despite the ministry's actual stance on creature blood, if they allowed James to be among their elite ranks, I'm hoping they will take leniency on my judgement' Dedalus thought as he stepped in with her and the golden grills shut behind them, heading to the next floor up.
Remus makes his way to guard Harry from Dumbledore's influence, Sirius takes Peter and deals with the logistics of handing over his god child to Severus and the school and learns of a strange connection between the Fae and Harry.
"Well that was enlightening, if you don't mind I will sleep in your delightfully comfy chair as I prefer that than my old living quarters of Gringotts dungeon or where this fellow threw me" Osiris said to Draco as he pointed at Blaise.
"Well that's quite an interesting turn of events ay Sonia? You would expect my department to be more interested in that book but at least we fill in the proper channels before requesting to take on certain child cases!" He gives a toothy grin which she can't help but find still unnerving given it usually means extermination.
"I guess that is more than we can hope for in this climate and given the kid is a Dhampir, alright Dedalus I will take you to Albus to see Harry though be aware I have Remus guarding the boy and he is bound to be pissed" Sirius sighs as he stands up and claps a hand over Dedalus.
It was quite shocking to him but his duty to his new lord was what was now breaking through his private thoughts 'Damn those Goblin bastards' he thought briefly as he carried Harry over the threshold just as the Dark Lord himself came down the stairs.. 'This won't end well' he thought fearfully suddenly at wand point.
They ran into the master bedroom, Lily was deathly pale despite her tan laying on the bed, writhing and shivering in a pool of her own blood, if it wasn't for James and the blood replenishment, she would be dead already, Poppy surveyed the scene clinically.
James turned thoughtfully at this to head to his office safe to collect them, "Paddy if these get damaged and aren't replaced or Harry gets hurt, I swear you will be drained and stuffed like the Black family elves!" His brown eyes flashing briefly crimson at the cowering house elf 'there, now he is likely to heed my warning and protect his charge whilst I am busy' he thought happily as he dismissed the elf to complete his tasks in his study.
He knocked briskly on Poppy's office door knowing Albus was there already, the door opened quickly as he turned to face the occupants of a furious Poppy Pomfrey at her desk and the twinkling eyes of the headmaster in her patient chair.
"I swear Harry if this is going to be a ongoing thing with you, you better do something about your dangerous antics!" Draco sighed as he also slipped into the sheets with him and grabbed a book, seemingly carved from actual Dragon skin, from his nightstand entitled 'Secret's Of The Darkest Art's: A Gruesome Compendium Of Dark Creature Lore', hoping to read more about his loves' kind as it always paid to be in the know and 'Malfoy's were always in the know as Lucius always told him, failure wasn't tolerated' he thought idely skimming it's list of contents.
As Sirius took his seat at the head of the table and Remus came in to sit at his right, Alastor smirked openly "Ah gentleman finally joining the party I see, personally I can see why and we heard your discussion, we aren't shouting our disagreements, we concur he needs to be back her and shown we are not out to hurt him unless he turns on us or allies himself to the Dark, we know even if he is a Dark Creature at nature it doesn't mean he would ally himself easily with Voldemort, you are living prove Remus, the boy needs protection and training but found in the right way not Dumbledore's way, speaking of anything you wish to ask him? He's been fed the truth serum it will last until Severus feeds him the antidote".
"Lord Potter I must ask you to please refrain from taking down the only barrier between us and numerous Dark Creature's currently stronger than you even at their weakest, be vigilant, when we go in you must have a choose of seven rare dark creature's to inherit from, choose wisely this is the last time we can cater your new cravings and each gift should reflect your future hunting plans" Griphook warned with a frown.
Albus storms Gringotts in his attempt to stop Harry learning all that the man has been trying to hide and cheat him out of aka his heritage and his wealth.
James jumped out of bed and quickly put a robe on before running to the floo room leaving her agonized cries in his wake, he grabbed a princh of floo powder and threw it into the flames "Headmasters Office, Hogwarts" he growled.
'Witnessing the child's magical strength, was eye opening' "It was truly a magnificent little creature to behold potentially worthy of Sybil's prophecy against Voldemort, given the Longbottom boy was an average child at best, however it represents a highly dangerous threat should it ever turn against my plans, I must move forward if I want to ensnare it for myself, no doubt James suspect's my treachery, they are both too clever even for auror's and see through too much of my facade if only slightly thanks to James's too finer instincts, they must be separated permanently if I am to have my weapon against Voldemort and against his tyrannical reign, for the greater good I must end the Potter line" he mused quietly as he stepped into his office and sat down to withdraw his missive to Pettigrew.
They travelled for half an hour back through before stopping back at the double doors leading to the main branch anti chamber, Griphook then snapped his fingers impatiently at the wizard guards standing between the doors, both of whom nodded and raised their wands to hover Harry and Osiris out of the carts to be placed on the ground before them and bound for good measure.
"I was musing about the Potter birth that occurred early hours yesterday morning, when I realised I could think of their address clearly, which was a clear sign of the charm failing and the Potter's possible endangerment, my fault was not alerting the proper authorities when I left via unregistered portkey to check their residence myself, hoping my potions expertise would spare at least Lily and the Boy here if I could make it in time to curse any Death Eaters snooping around, I appeared in the centre of the small village and quickly deduced something was indeed wrong, from a far as I walked to the Estate, I noticed the gate had been open slightly which suggested either they left or something got in through the charm, though no Dark Mark was present, hanging over the building, from further inspection as I drew nearer, I saw the door blown out, merely splinters and a cracked doorway was left, with fallen debris along the entry way and what seemed to be dark magic residue and structural scarring from stray spells, it was clear a magical battle of some sort was faught in the early hours of the morning before I arrived, I found James Potter's decomposing corpse which had fallen down the stairs, it seemed he was a victim to the organ rupture curse causing outer bleeding of the orifices and internal bleeding, I killed the insects milling around his body to prevent the spread of vampirism, before I ascended to find the remains of Lily and the Dark Lord himself in the master suite as well as their house elf, intriguingly the boy was the only one left alive, Lily sacrificed herself for the child and whatever spell she used succeeded in rebounding a rupture curse back on to the Dark Lord, astonishingly he is dead and the boy came out of it with nothing but this cursed scar where he was hit! I wrapped the boy up before Black appeared and we realised the possible culprit behind this attack, only Peter Pettigrew was able to give that address, he sold them out to Him! He has left this child in the care of Black who has no experience in parenting a normal child let alone a full blooded dark creature infant, he needs a place, a fit guardian, I will not have Lily's sacrifice be in vain Dumbledore! What is to happen to him? You know our world are prejudice at best to half wizards and dark creatures let alone a boy who fell the Dark Lord and is practically a mythical creature in this country! Not just will he be shamed by our kind but those of the Fae or Vampire court when they get wind of his continued existence, it will be a manhunt!" Severus shouted in the mans face, "Now my boy it is truly a day of celebration if what you are saying is true, the boy will be regaled as a hero, The Boy Who Lived in fact! He is the first to survive an encounter with that man other than myself and we all know I don't counter as I am fully grown and accomplished, he is a defenseless child going against the greatest threat to wizard kind since Grindelwald, you just can't compare, I understand your reasoning but I will not blame Peter without evidence that he was there at all, do you have proof of these allegations? Did you find his magical signature as you searched the premises?" Albus added, "No headmaster but it is the only explanation as the floo was only accessible if the Potter's opened it up their end as you know, he was secret keeper!" Sirius interrupted, "I cannot place blame without tangible evidence, you are free to track the man down Sirius as you are an Auror and take him in for questioning however there is nothing I can do with no evidence or testimony and it would need to be brought up to the rest of the Wizengamot as these are serious allegations of murder charges and must be examined thoroughly before such a sentence can be thought of, now about the child, I agree with Severus that it unwise to pick his guardian uncarefully as you are unfit to house someone this young especially a dark creature that could spread vampirism with its every feed, as you are legal guardian however will you consent to leaving him in our care so we can all find the best place to take him? He has muggle relatives if I remember correctly however I will not put him with them that would be most unsuitable and would endanger everyone involved with the child, Severus what do you suggest?" Albus enquired of the two, "Now see here Albus, I do not give consent unless I know this boy will be cared for more so than I could give him which is a pretty high standard to achieve if it could be, why are you both doubting that I can't take care of Harry?" He said in frustration, causing the boy in question who was sticking his hand in his mouth to eye him inquisitively for a moment before going back to his task and resting in the mans arms.
Meanwhile in Malfoy Manor, Draco had just layed Harry down in his bed and was just about to read his encyclopedia of Dark Creature types to get an idea of what Harry was, having no knowledge except for his Golden eyes that seemed to pierce through his soul at one glance, almost made him feel giddy being the centre of Harry's attention in a good way for once.
What do you think will happen when Diggle and Sirius return to see Harry? Or the consequences of the Adoption ritual? Will the vampire court find them?
Albus Dumbledore steeped his fingers as he cast a subtle hungry gaze at the boy who had fallen asleep in his godfathers lap somewhere within the meeting and was currently drawling on the mans leg as he slept. 'The dangers of proposing this here are relatively still large, especially in the school term, however with the proper staff present, we could handle one lower new born vampire easily..' "you may start Severus, however know this if we fail to successfully restrain you and you escape, you will be executed, I do not want to do this but as Headmaster I can not afford to carelessly endanger student lives to vampires, you will be stronger than even your sire at full strength before your first feed as you know, I recommend Filius join us and Minerva to ensure all precautions are met, I suggest we carry out the cleansing on the seventh floor after dinner, it gives me time to inform the school of precautionary measures, that being said Hagrid might be able to assist as well he would be a match for your possible strength so I will call on him too, we will do this at midnight in the Room Of Requirement, all students should be protect and in bed by that time should we fail to restrain you, Sirius you should deliver these adoption papers to the ministry and file your report of the incident, I have kept you gentleman long enough, you may leave Harry with me whilst you prepare for the ceremony and it's legal ramifications" he smiled at the two as he gestured towards the sleeping infant, Severus eyes narrowed in dark suspicion but relented as he had no power yet to object, Sirius however scowled "Why are you so intent on taking the boy Dumbledore?", "I was merely taking the burden off your shoulders whilst you prepare for a very sudden ritual, you can't do both whilst caring for the boy, surely you realise the department of the regulation for dangerous creatures would lock this child up as soon as it set foot in the ministry? Without a sire for the newborn he represents a highly dangerous threat to society even at this age especially with his evident magical strength and natural abilities?" Albus said lightly yet condescendingly, reprimanding the man and reaffirming the foolish dangers of having outsiders attempt to take the boy elsewhere.
The floating translucent green figure he had thought was firmly behind a barrier was actually smirking directly behind Osiris who until just then was none the wiser.
This hypothesis was intriguing to Severus and by extension Dumbledore though for different reasons, to Severus it seemed the boy had a type of Hypermagi Sensia, the art allowing someone to sense magic within its' non-corpral form and draw either from its' untapped strength or disperse it before someone performed their spell providing it was a worded incarnation, similar to the dark arts occlumens spell Interceptum that essentially does the same and taps into those abilities however is made available for those who don't truly have the talent or the will power to master such a difficult branch of magic, though they couldn't be sure, it could be it was just him being as babies are, only time will tell, Dumbledore however seemed more convinced it was not unlikely that the child possessed this gift and he was already making plans towards the creatures' untapped potential if it proved to be true later in its' life.
"Nice one Lil's you are teaching him new vulgar words already" James laughed, wagging his finger, "if you are going to teach him colourful words, teach him to say twat so Sirius can get a laugh out of being called it, but hush make sure his first words aren't vulgar ones, as we both know he will learn to speak before he does anything else but crawl and if you feel up to watching him make sure he doesn't climb the walls, despite it being within his ability even at his age of a day old, this will be strenuous to keep an eye on someone like him, especially for you whilst you are bed ridden, shall I ask for Paddy to assist you?" James asked in concern and then smirked "We have a lot more to handle with such a baby, we need to spell things unbreakable to him or he will escape and break everything easily as you have noticed his strength".
Sirius cursed himself for his stupid situation before rounding on the others "We must ascertain how much damage Dora took with that memory charm, Albus what did you target when attempting to curse Dora and Kingsley?" The others leaned over to gaze at the headmaster, readying themselves for his next evil revelation.
Who's stolen Pettigrew? How will Sirius find them and get Harry legally adopted? What connection does Harry have to the Fae? What will the vampires do to retaliate against Harry? Will Severus be strong enough to keep his ward? What is Dumbledore up to?
Remus eyed him wearily "if our cub has really gained something so very rare that he brought back an ancestor creatures DNA into dominance, we really need to find him after they are done with Albus or hell before, we should go down now and tell them we are leaving to find him and bring him back here! All I know is there was no distinction back then between light and dark creatures they were all beings that were strong enough to give us the magic we pass down, if this is true he will be seen as a threat to many and not a wizard anymore, he will have to deal with the creature laws as I do Siri, we both know the harsh life it has befallen many and if he has become a legendary creature everyone will be out for his blood or he will change alliances depending on the initial reactions to his new gifts.. we need to find him now!" His wolf screaming beneath his skin at the implications that revelation had spurred about his cub.
As he raised his wand to mutter the curse to remove the threat despite his sons impertinence however Harry stirred and woke his golden eyes now engulfed in speckles of red and obsidian "You have nothing to fear of your son, I have kept my morals and do not see him as food he is mine, my mate, I will protect him from death himself the Shaytan gave me the ability to place immortality on others I choose, your son will live on as long as he is not gravely wounded as will I, though he won't be invulnerable, I need more time to assimilate my gifts, leave!" Harry said in a deep and cold voice before falling back to sleep and snuggling into Draco who openly smirked quite smugly as Lucius headed the suggestion and fled the room.
"I understand, sorry this door is just brimming with power was hard to unconsciously resist trying to touch it" Harry replied in a slight daze, the goblins marched over with Griphook at the lead, he stroaked one gnarled finger over the centre rune before a faint glow and a muffled click could be heard.
She cast a quick "muffiato" and strong impenetrable charms on the door behind her as it shut, before rounding on a clueless Albus still sporting purple ink spots in his grey beard, at any other time she would of been heavily amused at his ruffled form, except for the grave circumstances that came in the mornings Owl post.
"Oh look mother, the headmasters here to catch his runaway Golden boy" Draco muttered to Narcissa, who narrowed her eyes calculatively before they disappeared, inside however he was feeling very antsy at seeing Dumbledore, 'What if he took my Harry away before I even got to be with him, he wouldn't let the son of a Death Eater close to his precious Golden boy nor would Harry's friends, I hope he keeps his promise' "come back quickly Harry" he muttered under his breath as they appeared in the Manor's receiving room, House Elf's popping in to welcome their master's back.
"A blood Adoption of a half Dark Elf and Half Vampire lineage, you say? With extraordinary abilities? I dare say the boy would be keyed into elemental and blood magic as if it were second nature not to mention any of his wizarding capabilities, I would hazard a guess he was also a natural metamorphamagi? Or Animagus? This presents very worrisome complications especially if he were under an ex Death Eaters tutelage, he would be deemed a national threat under the Dark Creatures acts if I remember correctly, who will be the sponsor if I am to actually go against my beliefs here and accept this proposal?" She asked with narrowed eyes, Sirius scratched his head and replied "Albus Dumbledore sent me here he is aware and is taking the proper precautions especially regarding housing and participating in the adoption ritual itself, does that suffice Mrs Kettleburn?" He said with slightly harder edge to his voice 'She better say yes and not interfere or I will hex her, kingsley be damned!' He thought angrily.
'Creature? I'm not human anymore? Well that explains the golden irises I guess though it will be interesting to see why I crave touching magic, I don't feel much different and my features are still humanoid at least I won't stand out besides the aura I exude seems to be quite dense' "If the Dursley's got a full view of my inheritance and are afraid or drawn to me why did they leave my door open?" I wonder.
James grew suspicious of those empty platitudes despite them thinking he was naive and blindly loyal, Dumbledore was being shifty as of late and he hoped he would leave soon this was his home and he was feeling very protective of his heir and wife right now, it seemed his tensing got his message across to Snape and Poppy as well as they left not soon after Dumbledore.
He immediately spotted James' remains collapsed at the bottom of the parlor stairs, in the same garments he wore when his child was born. He smelled putrid even from where Snape stood it appeared that already rigor mortis was settling in as well as the flies gathering to feast on what was left of his mangled body, curiously however Severus noted the flies collapsed after each tug of his flesh, he shouldn't of been caught off guard however, vampire flesh regardless of state unless it was caught in sun light would remain perfectly preserved as would its curse for animals to infect.
"Miss Flora what could be worse?" Dedalus asked clearly disturbed at the thought that having a soul extinguished being a light punishment in the eye's of the immortal beings, "Well silly wizard Dementors may take in the soul but they are made through Higher Necromancy, they are Death's personal guards, the souls they feast on do get reincarnated after a time, you wizards believe it is extinguished when they feed but no it is simply brought to Death himself to decide punishment before reincarnation, there's a reason those creatures are allowed to exist they are to keep a twisted balance, you are not taught this because you are still within that cycle, we immortal are exceptions, if we die we do not move on as mortals do, well Lich's may but vampires do not" Flora murmured to him.
'The fucking guardian council took away all my efforts to ensure a weapon against the bastard Tom, as well as any hope of grooming the nasty creature into a naive pawn, he is rich, powerful and a threat to both me and Voldemort, do I have to step in when he returns to the mortal realm? What if the prick joins with the other dark creatures such as the Malfoys who will have a child ready for Hogwarts at that time? Will he do a James and create covenants within the school and bite other students? Maybe if he does I can use that to shackle him to my cause? If I can kill him also before his inheritance maybe he will not be such as issue to deal with.. we will have to see' Albus thought as he settled down to finish his paperwork in agitation.
Obice Tranfiguro - Animagus Barrier to prevent those with Animagus Ability from escape, used primarily in Azkaban's high class prisoner cells.
"Is merely a common thief actually if we bind its will to you we will consider the debt paid in full Lord Potter" Griphook grinned nastily to which Harry nodded is ascent "I will take it after my meal and we can do the binding after my magical blocks are removed" Harry said and then walked up to the creature who shivered involuntarily under his gaze.
All occupants sucked in a breath at the mentions of those particular creatures "So this boy will exhibit traits of the shadow dragon kin, wings, power over shadow, the immortality of a illusionary demon as well as its gift of creating illusions, the abilities of a Lactura for a deeper magical hunger that does not require touch to steal, the hunger for flesh and blood of the vampire race, the ability of a Nightmare Double to create more than one of himself into any creature he has absorbed magic from almost like an even better Metamorphamagus, a boggart innate knowledge of a persons fear without the usual drawback a wizard counts on, he would also have the ability of rare elemental creatures that grow through maturity as well as the damn powers of a Lamia?" Lucius asked in cracked voice, horrified that such a dangerous creature was laying in his sons bed any of those could kill him ten times over let alone one with the powers of all and still room for growth!
As Draco blinked in surprise and heavy concern at seeing Harry unconscious in the arms of some other random Dark Creature, Tom Riddle moved swiftly down the stairs, clearly having felt the enormous pressure Harry exuded even unconsciously, all Draco could think was 'What The Fuck Was That!' As he too rushed down to grab Harry out of the things arms and cuddle him close.
'it seemed her uterus has burst internally as her son has tried to get out through the contractions', she thought as she rushed to Lily's side and tipped her chin back to swallow a vial handed to her by Severus, he then proceeded to point his wand at her legs and chant "Volmera Sumento" with each inflection the blood slowly flowed back into her body and sealed the vaginal wound.
She nodded meekly in wonderment 'Harry really does have the gift' she thought "He will need training to control this and he will also be even more difficult to find without your cloak when he grows up it seems James, we have our work cut out for us, do you suppose Sirius will help keep an eye on him despite him also being just a big teenager himself?" She enquired skeptically.
As Harry repeatedly wailed with a blood stained forehead held in a lifeless embrace, Wormtail fled the scene realising he sent his master to his downfall.
He soon stood at the entry way to Diagon Alley glancing at the rows of stores and occupants milling around before his gaze centred to Gringotts Wizarding Bank, looking high at the end of the street paved in white stone, he made a beeline for it thinking 'it is best this be sorted out quickly, the goblins will not take kindly to working with such a creature when they are made aware of what Harry is, it is very weird that voracious greedy goblins would fear a hybrid so or even be so prejudice being a magical creature themselves, hopefully I will manage to get this done quickly so I can take this pest to recieve his punishment'.
Meanwhile Remus lay admist his pack mates in the forest of Dean with Peter no where in sight so when a flash of fire appears out of thin air in their dingy little safe house in Knockturn Alley, it found it's intended recipient without any issues.
Severus after completing his Hogwarts rounds felt his Dark Mark actually fading to a charcoal grey instead of a burning black, it could only mean one thing.. "The Dark Lord was defeated? Wait I can think of their address.. the Fidelius is broken! I need to get to Lily!" He shouted at himself in a panic, he realised he must do this cautiously however so no one suspected him there 'it wouldn't do if Black caught him at the scene or the crime or others as I rush there if the scene is as I fear' getting an edge of deceptive calm into his mind, he focused his wand on his prince family ring and whispered "Portus" it glowed dimly blue as the spell sunk in before the tell tail invisible hook on the back of his neck jerked him away to his destination in Godricks Hollow...
I try to bolt for my bedroom to retrieve my wand but before I can get past the cupboard under the stairs Dudley trips me, making me fall flat on my face in the hallway, Vernon closed in and swiftly kicked me in the side as I tried to get up, I heard bone's snap and got hard to breath as I simultaneously spat blood on to the carpet and cry out in pain, I think 'he punctured my lung with that kick shit!' All kinds of alarm bells were ringing in my ears as Vernon took off my Jean's..
He breathes out a soft sigh 'damn she is beautiful in this moonlight, bursting full with our son, it should be any day now according to Poppy, I hope my cursed nature hasn't been past on to him but we will see as she was unfamiliar with the spell to test creature blood before birth, if it wasn't for our creature blood we could of used a licensed St Mongos healer though I'm glad we are able to put our trust in Poppy as she is the only person we can trust if Harry has our burden'.
"Sapping its gifts just increased my capacity to eat magic and not just Dark Creatures now it seems, that opens out my options, now I am dangerous to all who carry magic, I don't think I can even be classified by the ministries system now, good thing I have morals!" Harry said cheerfully to the now very worried Goblins 'What have we done..' Griphook can only think behind a calm blank mask.
Half way through dinner the infant looked at her with a look of constipation as if he was going to cry, 'what's wrong with Harry is he hungry?' She thought as she pulled him to her side of the bed, watching avidly as was James, his eyes suddenly changed to her deep green and his hair and wings to deep luscious red as if to copy his mother who gaped for a minute at her son before James burst out laughing "Told you Lil's this one will give little Tonks a run for her money I swear it!".
'I have a feeling Severus has found out about the Potters' and rushed there, I wouldn't put it past the sharp man or for Voldemort to gloat about Wormtail's apparent good idea, we shall see shortly I expect' he thought gleefully in anticipation as he guided Minerva and his fellow students into the Great Hall for breakfast.
Severus strode quickly through the gloom of the Shrieking Shack towards the tunnel passage, casting a subtle Lumos as his unlikely companion trudged behind him, occasionally muttering in agitated whispers "Why must we take him to Dumbledore? As far as I am concerned I am the boys legal guardian, what's it to you Snivulus if I am to take up my duty prematurely?" Sirius complained "Because you incompetent mutt, you are unfit for the role as you are and I don't wish Lily's blood to die out due to your foolish attempts at fatherhood! At least we will have an answer to our issue by the chief warlock of the Wizengamot, do you think Fudge would take kindly to a dark creature that was orphaned at birth? Mind your tongue before I curse it off, this for the boys continued existence not your misguided beliefs of duty when you are clearly incapable to fulfill what has been handed to you!" Severus snarled in contempt as he stepped into the undergrowth, in truth he was agitated about this too he knew Dumbledore was a master manipulator when he saw value in someone, he silently hoped the old fool would provide a good alternative solution rather than attempt to ensnare the boy.
"Your sticks can't harm immortals such as this Lich regardless of your proficiency and me? Well I have my ways, hey little Harry! Aren't you the cutest little devil, mummy Flora wants to give you a cuddle and something to eat as you are looking peaky!" Flora grabbed Harry into her arms and offered her slit wrist for the infant, who gladly chomped down on it "You see mortals, he is destined to be above you, his skill will be a danger as you know and have been arguing over, if not properly cultivated, however we do not wish him to grow into a snob either hence we are giving him a chance in the Wizarding world when he comes back for school, it is to temper him for his betterment and the betterment of all magical kind, he is the bridge to bring all the communities together despite hostilities and we have high hope's in his ability to do that under your and our guidance, what do you say mortals?" Flora drawled as she cuddled the baby to her chest.
"What time is it love? Can you do something about my pain? I need some potion and I don't think I will be of much use to you today until I recover, you will have to handle the cooking and cleaning, I may be weak but I can handle Harry until you are done, has he been fed? And has Severus been to stock us up for my recovery?" Lily rasped in quick succession.
Narcissa abruptly turned to her son and narrowed her eyes "Draco I advise you not to antagonize him any further, I had heard that he came into his inheritance last night and actually scheduled that entire article himself" she said quietly before casting "Muffiato", Draco seemed to splutter at that which Harry found very cute so he smiled at him as his gaze fixed on him.
"We will stand with him though being away from this world for too long is upsetting for us as we do have obligations here, Severus as Potions teacher and me as an Auror, we will be missed and probably fired if we do not return daily after a short leave to transition" Sirius stated, "You make a good point human, we will make sure the ministry will give you the needed time off for adjustment but you will return unless they will not allow more creatures among their law enforcement" his soul fires burned furiously at Dedalus who was scared shitless meekly nodding to show it wouldn't be an issue to which Sirius just smirked and nodded before they both walked through and left Dedalus and Dumbledore to rise to a now empty room.
"I believe I asked what the fuck you were doing here Snape, I knew what James was and I can tell this little fella has the condition, if you haven't forgotten I am an auror, you are trespassing and witnessed in the scene of a crime of murder! State how you knew to come here and why you are here, you will not touch Harry, I was named his guardian in case of these circumstances!" He barked out harshly, also withdrawing his wand and pointing towards Snape in accusation.
"Plenam Pecunia Solvere! You left me no choice but to do that whilst I explain!" He snapped as the visceral silver binding shot out of his wand encasing Harry and Remus in the chair they sat in, Remus could only whimper as the silver rubbed tightly and dug in to still fresh wound on his aching body, Harry awoke in a strangled cry as the bindings covered the boy.
"Well Draco you could say I went under quite the change I am now one of the rarest Dark Creatures to grace our mortal realm, I'm sure your mother can tell which one, question is can my mate figure it out?" Harry chuckled at the even stupider expressions that graced all the kids faces.
Sonia sighs as she is left alone to manage her growing stack of paperwork though she has a ghost of a smile on her face 'I hope Harry gets it, if any child deserves love it is him and our thanks for ridding us of the You Know Who' she thinks to herself.
Tom the bartender blinked stupidly at Harry, taking in the changes of his appearance, it wasn't until he saw the scar that he sputtered a greeting "Mr Potter you look very different since last year, how is it? Do you need a room? What can I get you? I swear it's illegal for a 15 year old to be using magic outside school.. I hope Aurors won't disrupt business.." he says with a slight smirk.
They moved as one to drag Harry out of the chamber still teaming with vicious entities, thankfully that last attack made by the Hydra didn't destroy the barriers, keeping them safe from the many captives, if even one of the closed off habitats of the larger creatures was disturbed, allowing things like the sinister looking Messorem hiding in the depths of the Dementor enclosure out, the entire bank wouldn't be enough to kill it.
He encountered both a strange black sludge that tried to pull him through the floor before being sapped and a boggart on his way around the room, much to the amusement of all his companions before stopping at another chained prison with deep red eyes attempting to struggle from its bindings in a flurry of shifting darkness, a vampire was clearly giving it all he had in the face of Harry's gaze to break free and run.
"Lily RUN IT'S HIM! TAKE HARRY AND GO!" he shouted as the door burst open with a wordless Bombarda Maxima, a high cold chuckle penetrated the gloom of the doorway, "And what will you do little vampire against me?" Voldemort sneered with crimson eyes roaming the seemingly empty hallway "I don't have time for games Potter! Visus Scelerisque! Cor Lignea! Sanguinem Exhaurire!" He shouted after locating James under his cloak, James gasped as he jumped out the way of the blood curse, as spell veered off and blackened the wall next to him, "Aruspices Expulsis" James shouted as his wand trained on Voldemort, who cast a wordless Pertago Maxima, causing the spell to vier left and strike the door frame next to Wormtail who was cowering behind the Dark Lord, "Really thisss has been fun but it is time to end thisss" Voldemort smirked and cast a voiceless Sectumsempra, it hit its mark and cut cleanly across James's torso leaving him to spit blood on to the floor "Oh I forgot that isss a mortal wound you can heal from isssn't it well I will leave you a parting gift then, I am a merciful lord after all Aruspices Bombarda Maxima!" All his internal organs ruptured as the spell hit him and he died in the pool of his own blood falling down the stairs as it hit him, Voldemort stood there admiring his work in mild fascination before moving past him further into the house.
"Seems young Dolores finally got caught doing something illegal, ah well another pest might be leaving our ranks and this may also effect the minister, I will talk to Albus if he hasn't heard yet as Cornelius will probably get a backlash with her being one of his under secretaries, shall we move to your office?" He questions as golden grills shut behind them.
He strode purposely through the door, tightening his occlumens shields as he did so, he immediately noticed the Dark Lords body first crumpled in a heap of his own blood, the stains of orificial leakage apparent on his lifeless crimson eyes, ears and hands, 'my lord is gone, it seemed he died of an organ rupture curse.. how?' He was rendered dumbfounded at the sight for minutes then as if shaking himself he eyed the rest of the rooms destruction.
Harry took the dagger and slit his palm slightly with the edge of the blade, allowing a few drops to spill on the parchment, it glowed blue for a moment before words appeared.
He hoped his love was just asleep having cried herself into a coma rather than heartbreaking alternative, he couldn't rely on his Dark Lords mercy for mudbloods however so with mounting dread, he began climbing the creaking stairs towards the second floor with his wand aloft ready to fight if need be, he made sure he at least carried all the healing potions as usual so if she just lay sleeping or slightly wounded be could save her 'If the brat lives I hope he bit her if her condition is worse than I fear it is so I will have enough time to fix the damage' he thought desperately as he neared the room at the end of the upstairs hall that lay open with a foul smell wafting over him from inside.
In the end he gathered himself and took one last look around the room at all the rest of the beings in captivity settling his attention on another four individuals behind another barrier on the far right wall opposite the sea enclosure.
Sirius enters the Ministry to attempt to send out warrants for Pettigrew and his apparent help and to see Harry is adopted legally by his new guardian Severus, however things are amiss when Umbridge appears requesting certain documents on one Harry James Potter!
I stare mindlessly into the blurry abyss of the softly blanketing darkness engulfing me within my bedroom, taking only small comfort in the final silence of Privet Drive and the gentle snoring of the Dursley's down the hall, slowly counting down the seconds until my birthday as is my lonely tradition despite gaining friends finally in Hogwarts.
Meanwhile Sirius stroad towards the Hogwarts' apparition boundary with the folder he was handed to deliver on his way to the ministry. "I might as well find Moony first to explain the situation as this could take up some time and though I respect the man's judgement, I do not trust Dumbledore alone with Harry, I can trust Moony as he was one of us marauders, how to break the news without him flipping however is another matter entirely!" He muttered as he neared the boundary.
Potter Main Vault: 370,500 Galleons, 50 Sicles and 7 Knuts (Accessible), 70 artifacts and 40 rare tomes remaining.
Magicae Obstructionum - Magic Block, this corrupts the magical core of a person via placing a block and restricting ones magic and magical potential, It is lethal to a child and dangerous if left untreated in adults.
Albus' face grew darker with each line he read of the short article "Harry is missing, contact Remus and the others, gather Moody, we need to find him if Tom hasn't or the ministry!" He shouted as he rose from his chair, utterly furious, Minerva's lips were curved into a thin line as she answered crisply "the search has already commenced despite what the article suggests, it appears Mr Potter boarded the Knight Bus towards Diagon Alley at around 9:15am, the boy is safe I would of thought he went to Gringotts after fending off his attacker" she said.
The child wails and turns to the only living being in the room and eyed it with a venomous glare which was intriguing for a baby to make that face, it snarled animalistically with its eyes glowing a cross between Avada green and deep crimson red at the Lord who falled his family, Voldemort felt vaguely intrigued by the specimen before him however he did come here to end this supposed thorn in his reign "It was a pity, Severusss wanted her as a play thing but no matter though" he mused as he trained his wand on the enraged infant which looked pretty amusing to the Lord before him, like an angry kitten almost unable to do anything except snarl and bare it's small fangs.
"I consent to this if I am kept in his life closely on all decisions regarding his education and welfare Albus, though must Snivulus really be the ideal candidate to sire him? Sure he has extensive Defense Against The Dark Arts knowledge and is a greasy bat anyway but he is too cold to father a child!" Sirius shot him a thunderous glare as he complained to Dumbledore about the proposal, though he couldn't refute the offer for what it was, it was a brilliant suggestion, Albus fingered his beard as he contemplated his response 'This is perfect, Severus will secure the boy and they will both be under my direct influence until he leaves school, which will be in seventeen year's! With Tom out of the picture for now and my new pet being molded under my tutelage, the opportunities are endless' he thought for a moment, basking in absurdity of his good luck and resourcefulness, with any luck Black would get arrested and the child will be all their's, he coughed and murmured his ascent to their plan to have guardianship transferred to the school and directly Severus Snape, afterwards it took only a few hours to work through the legal logistics of the change in circumstances, all there was left to do was request and sign the appropriate ministry forms for the department of Familial Affairs, responsible for the re-housing of orphaned wizards and marital disputes, as well as signing the correct legal documents in order to get the boys' Gringotts account transferred to the right guardian(s), plus pick a date and time to perform the ritual blood sharing involved in the blood adoption of one Harry James Potter soon to be Harry James Potter-Snape.
"They wished for amicable relations, said he would be asleep for three days to give him time to adjust to the many creatures he has absorbed and they also wish him to take care of a rogue Messorem in their creature prison, where he found me, do you wish me to tell you the creatures that will manifest in him in one way or by Animagus form?" Osiris bit out through gritted teeth much to Voldemort's amusement.
"Mr Cauldwell how dare you make such a racket at this time in the morning!, 10 points from Gryffindor for your undignified shrieking!" Minerva McGonagle stood directly behind the boy, glaring over her glasses as she towered over him with a stern expression, "If you do that again you will receive detention, now away with you, breakfast will be on shortly" she continued down the stairs without a backwards glance at the cowed child, noticing Albus lurking in the entry way she made a beeline for him.
Osiris crumpled to the floor before rising slowly his magic working again to close and seal his bodily injuries, before he could take a step however Harry grabbed his arm roughly, his golden eyes bore into Osiris's violet ones "If you betray me you will end up my meal like the others, I may sympathise with you due to similarly being victims of Voldemort but I will not tolerate lies or betrayal, I will stand by you as long as you do the same, nice to meet you Osiris I am Harry Potter" he withdrew and shook the man's hand before walking further away to search for more creatures to sap.
Blinking to attempt to ward off the sun lights glare, he finally saw Sirius standing at his doorstep which was not an uncommon occurrence, dressed in his usual black trench coat, messy curls, dark blue Jean's and Twisted Sister t-shirt, it wasn't until he caught the look in the anxiously wide brown eyes that he realised something was wrong, "Come in Padfoot, we were just getting ready for lunch.. what can I do for you?" Remus asked thirdly.
"Thank you and Good Day, remember to submit your wands for inspection at the Security Desk at the end of the Atrium" the voice stated as their appropriate badges dispensed through the change dispenser, his reading 'Sirius Black, Ministry Interrogation Liason and Familial Affairs Consultation', Pettigrew's 'Attending Interrogation' however just then, before the booth could rumble and descend into the bowls of the earth towards the ministry of magic, a hand shot through the paneless windows and grabbed the cage pulling it out of Sirius's grasp to land loudly with a thud on the floor, Sirius attempted to spin around to fire a spell at the attacker but was too late, he landed on his front under a full body bind, the assailant picked up the cage that had fallen and before he could fight the body bind off or the entrance could prevent its' descent, the person disapperated with crack leaving a very angry Sirius lying there in wake of the assault.
"You dare deny me my mate Parkinson? I can deal with sharing a little if it is platonic or agreed by us given I am sort of a sexual creature especially if I steal from an Incubus but you dare deny my rite to claim what is mine? Are you picking a fight with me? It is taking all my will power to beat the urge to turn you into a fucking squib, all it takes is a touch from me and you will never again grace the Wizarding World, want to test me?" Harry spits out angrily at her 'what gives her the fucking rite!' He thinks indignantly as he draws nearer to her and by extension his mate.
Draco stared back into the exquisite golden eyed boy in front of him before eyeing Blaise and his mother's reactions to Harry's statement, all of whom were smiling slightly given it wasn't every day one becomes the mate to such a powerful being and is actually given the choice respectfully, it made something inside him melt and fill him with a sense of childish glee at the earnest words of his formal rival.
"Mutt take a look at that bastards spawn before you step too close to him, you will be surprised, I suggest you walk away and go find Pettigrew if you want your revenge before I find the bastard that sold this location to the Dark Lord" Snape sneered condescendingly at him with his wand still trained on him.
Blaise looked on in interest at this and then whistled lowly before outright laughing at what happened to Pansy, Harry managed to get his urge under control as he sat down beside his mate and asked "Draco you have a choice in this will you accept me as your mate? I understand you may have already had partners and I respect that but my instincts are shouting to make you my one and only now that I am a creature and no longer a wizard, I realise we got off on the wrong foot all those years ago in first year but it means very little to me now, I am willing to be way more than the friendship you once offered, are you?" His eyes boring into Draco's looking for the acceptance he craves.
As they floated Harry through the open door and into the large room with a raised platform, resembling an ornate sacrificial alter, carved out of solid gold and etched in obscure Elven runes and precious gems that even had Osiris perplexed, they placed him in the centre of it and conjured straps to hold him in place in case of body spasms.
Sirius breathed another sigh of frustration before walking in and towards the shortest line present to see one of the bank administrators, all of who sat atop their high back podiums, along the walls of the room, either weighing and checking item value, scratching reports or conversing with their customers lined before them.
I awoke 'which was some kind of miracle given the pain I was suddenly under', I try to move realising I'm still aching from whatever after effects this left on me, though the first immediate change I realise is I can actually see! I don't need glasses anymore! I can see with sudden clarity.. "What the hell happened?" I mumble as I stumble out of bed only now realising the many locks on my bedroom have been unlocked leaving the door ajar.. "that's also weird why would they leave my room open at all? I gathered it was me screaming last night but to leave it open going against Vernon's wishes? Something isn't right here.." I walk gingerly to the mirror to check the damage only to stare in absolute shock.
"Sirius, why did you take the visitors entrance of all things? and how did someone manage to bind you so thoroughly? Come with me to my cubicle, we need to debrief you immediately, as an attack on an Auror is a capital offense, we will need to issue a warrant towards the assailant and details of your day before this happened" Kingsley spoke softly as he took Sirius by the arm before the man could protest.
"You are aware the Potter's have just died leaving the son an orphan under my guardianship and I believe it is best to transfer it as well as the vault access to people more suited to take care of the child, do you not?" He sneered, Ragnok brought the tips of his hands together "I am aware, who would be needing access to the Potter Vaults?" He eyed Sirius with a scowl of his own, "Severus Snape is to be the Guardian, he will be going through a blood adoption ceremony tonight and Hogwarts will also gain custody of him as a ward of the school so both will need full access however give Hogwarts only restricted access only to Tuition fees and Board, I do not want Albus Dumbledore abusing his position in this!" Sirius said angrily, "This will be arranged, an owl will be sent to each respecting party once the ministry has confirmed the change however here is a temporary Vault key to Harry Potter's private vault until he is of age to have his full access, please present this to Mr Snape as proof of this meeting as we can not give written ascent until the ministry is notified and has approved" Ragnok held a key in his outstretched hand to Sirius, who took it as he nodded, as he walked to the door however Ragnok smirked and spoke again "We are also aware of the nature of his birth, it was foretold within the Fae courts despite their rejection of his kind, it looks like Lord Potter and Severus Snape will soon be hunted if this happens as you say tonight, the vampires do not forgive turning Humans after all, no matter the circumstance nor will the ministry remain silent when you tell them" he chuckled darkly at the thought before walking past Sirius who just stood their in fear and astonishment 'how I never told them of Harry! What is he to them?' He thought darkly as he walked out of the bank and disapperated to the ministry visitors entrance.
As he strained for a moment he could detect snatches of the various conversations going on in his absence among the seventh years, steam rising steadily from their cauldrons gently obscuring their features as they steadily stirred and added ingredients or stood scratching their heads buried in a potions book.
Harry could barely contain his premature predatory bloodlust as they vigilantly stepped inside the dark passage devoid of any light, he knew however it wouldn't be wise to cast a lighting charm or at least a common one as most dark creatures' bane is natural or unnatural light or at least the rare and powerful ones tend to be sensitive to it, only with his current abilities could he take the gift and nullify that particular weakness, his only worry was when sapping the creatures was 'Would I also gain their base instincts that could possibly overwhelm my own' that was the real danger of such dangerous ability, was his psyche prepared for something else to invade in order to pass on the gifts each had and would it become harder the more he consumed? Given it was a base instinct to sap all dark magic he came across, would it affect his usually strong mind in his new form? "Guess I will have to find out the hard way now" Harry muttered into the gloom as they approached and inner chamber.
Snape snorted in vague disgust at getting the reference though he was awed at the little fiend now snuggly in Lily's arms too enraptured to notice James's eyes narrow at the reaction 'this little brat will be the dark lords downfall all right, if he could throw even the old goat to the ground at infancy he will be a force to be reckon with in his majority, however this represents plenty of social complications although if he is truly a Dhampire the dark lord won't be able to kill him traditionally this could prove interesting if not for the dangers this presents to Lily herself' he glanced at Albus holding his twinkling stare and lowering his occlumency barriers slightly to give his unworded opinion to him, Albus just smiled and nodded before addressing the occupants of his congratulations and taking his leave.
"I will inform her as soon as the floo is shut and I will also take the liberty of informing Severus, that we are in need of some blood replenishment potions, this is grave news if he has contracted the conditions, however I am confident Lily and her son will both live, we will be coming through the floo from the hospital wing shortly, please allow admittance your end and we will meet you in your bedroom within the next half hour, don't worry James the contractions will last a while yet just make sure she is rested and give her some blood replenishment potion before we arrive if you have it on hand, do not give her numbing agents that will effect the pregnancy!".
Before an answer was given there was a knock at the door as Severus Snape stepped in the room, seeing the scene before him he immediately drew his wand and pointed at the unknown beings before him "Who are you to assault Hogwarts staff?" He spat icely, "Well Mr Snape.. we are members of the Guardian Council for immortal magical creatures, I trust you know why we are here now?" Flora drawled with a smirk at his look for surprise.
"Remus, he is a danger to others and himself, if someone got wind of him and his powers and tried to take him from us, before he has the ability to understand and protect himself, surely it is right to douse his signature and inhuman features? Do you want someone like Greyback trying to kill him? As I assure you, he will, just for killing his master! Let alone because he is a baby and is of the vampire race! Your sworn enemies by default!" Albus said in exasperation.
Hermione and Alastor stared at him as if he grew a seperate head "We are in no way rallying with the Dark, Sirius! They want the death of all below purebloods and even attack purebloods without reason! We are all for Harry becoming a leader for the betterment of our kind rather than the annihilation of it but we aren't standing with Voldemort on any issues, he is vile and dangerous, we should recapture Harry and make sure no one of the Death Eaters or the ministry gets at him, let's take the legal route to fix some of the legislation though as we do agree people like Umbridge are a blight to our relations with creatures, would be better to place Hagrid as a representative more than anyone or even Newt Scamander if he can be found!" Alastor boomed incensed at the mere thought of a dark alliance despite Albus's revelations.
As the telephone box approached the Atrium the cool female voice welcomed him to the ministry before the door opened, awaiting his exit, however he was still stuck which caused passers by to raise eyebrows to the man struggling on the floor, one was kind enough to inform the security office stationed by the golden grills at the end of the room of his predicament, thankfully the guard came out of the office and headed his way accompanied by an Auror, but from his vantage point he couldn't see only hear the calls and foot steps approaching him as he lay there humiliated 'For a damn good Auror you had to let your fucking guard down when you had a suspect in your grasp!' Sirius berated himself until he was released from the bind.
Alone Albus smirked rather darkly as he played with the boy, who thought it rather funny to smack his long white wispy beard with his wings, the boy babbled and giggled softly with each whoosh of the beard, "Now then son, I see you have a love for magic, if my hypothesis was any indication earlier, how about I do some magic for you?" He enquired gently "Crepitaculum!" Conjuring a softly glowing baby rattle for the boy to nibble on, Harry laughed delightedly as he made a grab for the magical rattle, Intent on eating it.
Harry blushed slightly and coughed "Thank you, we are delighted by the service you have shown us, may your enemies blood run and your gold forever flow" He says in response which stupified the rest of the Goblins momentarily before they all grinned "I am surprised again Lord Potter of your knowledge of our customs, let's head down to the creature holding area then shall we?".
He would of felt a tad smug at doing that to the Dark Lords corpse but only if he was alive to feel that wound, he walked towards the bed to pick up Harry but Snape stood in his way.
Ragnok sighed in exasperation before shouting "The Order as they did not attempt to aid Albus Dumbledore is free to use their accounts and do business with us should they appear again, they probably was not told that they would have to strong arm Gringotts Staff into releasing Harry Potter to them, they are not the ministry therefore they had no legal grounds to take him or order us, Albus Dumbledore is the sole perpetrator of this in his attempt to apprehend Lord Potter, we will be seizing his account assets and banning him from the premises as collateral for his assault but nothing more, the Auror's will not be involved at this time, you are free to leave or go about usual business, we goblins take your safety and patronage seriously and thank you for your time in our establishment" before turning away and swiftly walking to the rosewood door left open, the screams seeming to have tapered off sometime in the midst of Albus Dumbledore's attempt at assaulting him.
Lily groaned and whimpered slightly as she struggled to move to her side to watch little Harry as he lay next to her until Paddy returned with his crib.
He stopped just outside the Hogwarts' gates and disapperated to Knockturn Alley, hoping the man was indoors and also that he would catch Wormtail off guard in the process, 'the slippery Rat won't get away from us easily' he thought as he trudged past the dingy dark arts shop Borgin And Burkes, careful not to antagonize any of the witches and wizards purchasing their wares.
He inhaled her scent briefly for a minute before turning sharply to shake her awake "Lily my sweet I believe the baby is coming!", she began to moan slightly in her sleep and then shot bolt up right screaming, she was going into labour, the blood pooled between her legs rapidly as she started to shake violently, fighting off the waves of painful contractions.
Ragnok nodded his assent before taking a small object out of his pocket and handing it to Osiris "You will have thirty seconds before that port key takes you to Malfoy Manor with Lord Potter" though before he placed it into the Elfs hands he quickly cast Harry unconscious again "He needs a healing sleep, his body has been through too much too quickly even an immortal would snap if his magic collapsed as his is dangerously close to doing, make sure he does no magic for a week after he awakes which should be in three days once with his mate, Osiris you will also inform him he is welcome to return to collect his holdings in Peverell vault after that and we also have a problem with that nasty Messorem, if he could come by when rested and dispose of that abomination, we would compensate him greatly given the risks involved with dealing with the thing, not even our curse breakers can kill that undead" He muttered then placed a small obsidian orb into the Elfs outstretched palm.
He snarled in outrage before starting to chant a long forgotten charm he kept just in case of him ever having tight wards against him "Diébus Vitæ Equitum Solis!" In a flash of orange light, his spell severed all the wards of the building effectively freeing him before he broke the anti disapperation and disappearing in a crack of spiralling purple robes.
Harry glanced fearfully around the room as his appearance reverted to his true form of jet black hair, blue, green and crimson eyes and small black wings, he could do nothing except wriggle and cry out helplessly, he tried to use his magic inherently to stop whatever had hold of him, the air around him glowed a piercing orange before the silver melted off them after a minute to reside in a puddle on the floor.
Harry meanwhile was having a tough time keeping up with constant barrage, he was only liquid after all! 'Maybe I might be able to drag it down and absorb it that way like this thing tried to do to me before I overwhelmed it with the same tactic' he thought, steeling his resolve, he moved again and actually jump on the creature and started expanding over it exactly like a slime eating its prey and as the struggling Hydra didn't have sapping abilities it could no longer put up a good fight instead it wasn't long before it was overwhelmed especially being only a young one with not so many heads or abilities, becoming easy prey for Harry finally.
"Impressive selection you have down here Griphook, I have to wonder is this where you bring your prisoners who have wronged the Goblin nation?" Harry whistled in appreciation upon noticing the races present either shackled with magic sealing cuffs or laying atop active barrier runes.
As Dumbledore stood chuckling too himself quietly, he glanced at the portraits behind him, softly snoozing in their frames, he was vaguely grateful to the previous headmasters and mistresses, though they are failing at pretending to sleep in his presence, they are still duty bound to his will, unless he is ousted from his position, sighing softly he moved to his bed chambers wondering if Peter is with Remus and if so will he succeed in laying blame solely on the rat for their betrayal.
"I don't wish to risk my only heir, the sole person to continue our line, he is the darkest thing to walk this earth Draco, we have never taught you about them because even their familiar bonds are dangerous unless the wizard can handle the drain having one has on their magic, it is much higher than bonding with house elves it is near lethal let alone a humanoid one! His appetite now exceedes to eating the boundless power of leylines, how is that safe around you? Use your head!" Lucius said pained at the death stare he was receiving from his stupid son who seemed blindsided like if Hagrid were to have found more dangerous pets to keep.
"Paddy!" Lily shouted, "Yes mistress?" He answered with a soft pop of apparition, "help me seal the door when James moves outside but do not put a silencing wards up just in case it is a false alarm" Lily said as the pulled out her wand from the draw, "Praemoenio!" "Salvia Hexia!" "Repelo Mugglesum!" "Fiantodori!" "Confirma Sanguinem!" "Nox Maxima" "Silencio" She cried, securing the door and fortifying the house, it wasn't as strong as the blood ward she had in mind however it will hold unless it is the dark lord they face.
"Well this is surprising I own a quarter of Hogwarts like Tom does, maybe if we find the others we can remodel the classes" Harry laughs disparagingly, seeing just how well off he actually was.
I do realise it's only August 31st in the timeline not Halloween when Voldemort found them in the film, however I really wish to set the scene for some true angsty hardships for baby Harry, I took inspiration for doing this via the manga Death Mage Who Doesn't Want A Forth Time, this really sets the scene for unthinkable trials ahead and I wished to have Harry be dealt such a blow for later scenes and mindset, what do you think of dark Dumbledore and his easy manipulation in selling out the Potters to vindicate his sense of justice? Let me know! I also apologise for short chapters but they won't all be.
Blaise smirked wider as he walked to the bed before crawling on it and laying back at the end of it quite languidly "that Elf gave me no trouble at all it was easy chaining him up on the magic sealing cuffs to await our Lords punishment".
Tom's eyes flashed with vicious glee when he felt everyones tension in the room 'If I can mould this boy to bend to my will, I will control a beastial god just like myself, free to rule for all time, none will appose my aims and if we can breed him and re-awaken long lost Malfoy Creature Blood, that has been diluted since before even my ancestors time, we could have an army at our disposal as we increase his family and take down all opposition of the Darks freedom' he thought with a hint of anticipation as his eyes trailed along Harry's sleeping form.
Walking along the narrow passage way he haulted at the only painting lining the passage ways corridor exit, "Password?" Asked the painting of a rambunctious man clad in frayed brown robes, Severus sneered in disdain.
"You make a good point I apologise for swearing but seriously James you will end up my potions ingredients if you put that cloak over him this is your only warning, lock it in your study today, Paddy will be needed to keep an eye on him if you stick him in his crib, but it isn't advisable that a house elf be left to tend a baby Dhampire, he will get infected easily and I don't much want an undead house elf, their elf council will take drastic actions if we allow Harry to bite him and as he is not a full wizard but of mixed creature blood, they can and will hunt him if it happens, I will not have a family member turned or hunted!" Lily shouted crossing her arms.
Liga Animo - a long term minor Mind Control dark spell used for those of weak will or without occlumens ability, it is uncommon because the Imperius Curse would be more effective in the short term.
"Snape! You utter bastard, give me my godson! You have no right to keep him from his legal guardian or to try and go higher than me to take the boy away from his only family!" Sirius snarled in indignation, attempting to pull Harry from the mans' oily grasp.
"Bit presumptive aren't you Blaise, fine Draco tops me first he has the rights to my virginity as my mate, you get an after taste, you are lucky I feel generous at all after blatantly and brazenly attempting to come between us!" Harry said his eyes lustrously promising pain though the delicious kind.
"Ah just the snivelling mutt I wanted to see, we were just talking about you, why don't you join the party Black!" He spat as the other man tensed and walked further into the room.
Harry nodded with a raised brow "Fine I do not like having things chained to me and I can understand your predicament, I will still take you" he snapped his fingers and somehow released Osiris much to the blatant agitation of Griphook and the others.
"Yyess master" Peter bowed jerkily and vacated the room, leaving the Dark Lord to wait patiently for his plan to come to fruition.
"POTTER!" 'And there's Vernon to the rescue.. what have I done this time?' Vernon charged into the kitchen almost knocking me over in the process, "Boy what is the meaning of this freakishness!" He shouts purple faced and spitting though his eyes give off an unnaturally predatory gleam as he stares at me for some reason.. which slowly dawn's on me as he approaches 'oh no he likes what he can see! That's both disgusting and a whole other new level of weird! And I can't even use Magic to defend what the fuck!' I think frantically as he draws nearer by the second.
"Mmaster, Mmistress be very angry with yous, Master Harry needs feeding, I have placed him in his cot as ordered sir" James sighed at the Elf "Alright thank you Paddy I will be right out to tend to Harry" 'we are really over our heads it seems today but it is more than worth it, my son is already the little raskle I was according to Dad' a faint pop interrupted his thoughts as got up to leave the study to tend to Harry.
"Well I expected that, Crucio!" Voldemort said as Blaise started convulsing on the bed and screaming in pain, "I trust the Goblins put a type of bond on you and Harry? It would explain how you knew where to open the portal given we had not given you the specific location of Draco's room" Voldemort said as his gaze switched to Osiris who's purple orbs changed abruptly from malicious glee to outright fear and also barely disguised anger.
'5.. 4... 3.. 2.. WHAT..' "AH!!" I clenched my fists and jaw tightly suddenly, as I started rapidly convulsing, sprawled among my thin bed sheets as blinding waves of intense agony spike throughout my body, as if my blood was turned acidic, liquidating what's left of my innards after my daily dose of Dursley malnutrition.
How will Albus and others handle their now over powered Golden Boy? Will Draco accept the vast changes? Will Osiris prove useful in the days to come? How will Harry's friends or Voldemort take his sudden uprising? We will see..
'Seems we finally arrived' Harry thought idely, as he and the other goblins disembarked on to the sleak stone walkway facing the door in question.
Dolores looked slightly shocked at this rude reply before she purpled up in suppressed indignation "Now see here I am the senior undersecretary! you know the dangers of such a thing being left on it's own even under the proper guidance!" She sneered the last part with a deep ugly scowl.
Sirius walked in but made no move to sot down as Ragnok promptly stood behind his desk, "Please take a seat" the goblin said as he eyed him with hostility, "I think I will stand, some people have work to do and can't afford relaxation when there is business to attend to" he snapped, "Indeed, what brings you here today Lord Black?" Ragnok asked replacing hostility with a curious leer.
Severus stumbled to his feet, clutching his head for a minute as did the others before pointing his wand at the child and whispering a light cleaning spell to wash the blood off the still screaming infant, on closer inspection they could make out Harry had small protruding black wings and a deathly pale complexion, confirming his vampiric inheritance however his small ears seem to carry and elven trait to them rather than pure vampire, Severus berated himself he should have known this boy would inherit both dominant genes of the two.. he was a Dhampire which although is miraculous and rare in magical breeding due to the Fae and Vampire covens not getting along, it will spark controversy regardless of his social standing, 'this will be bad' he thought.
They reach her office in no time and push open the door to view Sirius sitting there seemingly bored and impatient, "Ah Auror Black, we have returned and I have brought the specialist needed for such a request, we have been talking and we believe before we can write the official document we must see the child as well as the Adoption ritual outcome, Dedalus requests a full risk assessment of both and to be a witness with a few of his team, can you and him go to the headmaster now? I will wait here and his verdict will stipulate if I can fulfill this request for you, it is a lot better to have this maybe than blatant extermination given the circumstances, don't you think?" Sonia says in a business like manor as she reaches her desk and sits down across from Sirius.
"Albus! I tried to catch you before you got down here but I missed you, your office was empty upon my arrival, have you seen Severus? I tried to floo him earlier to organise a student's detention but oddly he was not in his lab nor as Mr Filch seen him since early last night, this is undignified for the staff to be absent so I hope he was just eating breakfast early" Minerva enquired, "I confess Minerva I have not seen Severus since dinner yesterday, I doubt my staff are staging a mutiny, least of all Severus you know how serious the man is with potions, nevertheless if he is not in the hall by the end of breakfast, I will endeavor to find our runaway potions master or teach the class in his stead, should finding him in the castle be futile, until he does show himself, now let's go in shall we" he gestured to the oak doors outside of the Great Hall, where students were milling around waiting for their fellow houses to arrive.
I rounded the corner and raised my wand arm waiting for the Knight Bus to appear seconds later. I climbed aboard after greeting Stan and Ernie "What'll it be Mr Potter? Where we goin' then huh?" Stan asks, "The Leaky again Stan" who laughs abit and asks "That'll be the usually thirteen sicles mate!" I hand over the money and run to the nearest bed as the Bus learched forward again, speeding down unknown side lane's towards one of the occupants destinations.
"From what the Auror's have gathered You-Know-Who has finally finished what he started all those years ago, ending the Potter Line though Harry Potter's body is still missing, after Auror's checked the wreckage and identified the corpse of muggle Vernon Durlsey (aged,39) eye witnesses are urged to report any information known to Auror Headquarters of the where abouts of Mr Harry James Potter if alive to be brought in for questioning - Rita Skeeter, Daily Profit Journalist".
Dumbledore stood over the sleeping infant, curled in on himself in a leathery winged ball, the man watched him avidly until he sensed someone walking past the boundary 'It must be Remus, I guess it's now or possibly never, a shame' he thought as he gathered his magic within himself as he pointed his wand at the sleeping infant.
"I am a Dark Chimera a rare Dark Creature now with the power to sap magical gifts from other dark beings? Was this the edge against Tom the prophecy foretold or am I just lucky? Well whatever the case Dark Arts is forbidden so I must train discreetly and make sure Albus doesn't find out what I have done or am even if I am still me, He detests Dark Creatures because they aren't safe around normal beings, my nature hasn't changed enough but I propose a significant threat now that I am good at wandless magic and have the means for exponential growth, he may kill me just for what I am regardless of the side I wish to be on" I mutter to myself in contemplation under a silence bubble so those I obliviated of the conversation can't hear me and undo my hard work.
Remus strode up the staircase not minutes after the cast, as he knocked politely and entered the room, he could instantly smell Dumbledore's trepidation at his arrival, immediately putting him on his guard, his golden glare piercing Albus's false calm gaze as the man rose to great him.
"Yes Mrs Malfoy, you are quite correct though I wanted him to stew and figure me out himself, do you mind if I court your son? My instincts demand it of me but I am still somewhat human in mind too" Harry asks in response, eyes never wavering as the dawning realization hits Draco like a ton of bricks making him shake slightly in open wonderment.
"Albus! What the hell did you think you were doing attacking a goblin just to get to Harry? Sure the coincidences are disturbing but what the hell made you incite a potential war with the goblins! You are the leader of the light, what image does that scream to the denizens of Diagon Alley? Do you know something we don't about Harry? Why are you attempting to go to such lengths and drag us along without a moments thought to our own reputations?" Minerva screamed at him as she made a beeline through the others to get at him.
He took a tour of the first floor, taking note of the spell damage along the walls and door frames, yet was wary of his magical signature being found in the residence when others eventually came snooping, so refrained from fixing any of his surroundings, a simple Reparo, would have done the trick on most of this however it would mask the Dark Lords signature and incriminate his own, after Dumbledore went through the trouble of defending his position as Spy, he was not keen on giving reason to spread more doubt on his loyalties regardless of how fickle his fielty towards society was.
"Griphook I gather my vaults have been ransacked if the inventory is as can be believed who has been accessing it on my behalf?" Harry asked angrily, "Albus Dumbledore appointed himself as your primary Guardian and took over the Vaults and your seats on the Wizengamot until you became of age, we were unaware of the fact you lived with your aunt and uncle instead and therefore you can request all money back with full interest on all parties involved" Griphook replied with a dark chuckle, "Wait all parties involved? What the fuck has been doing with my money? What laws did he pass under my name! I was not being groomed to take my rightful spot is there a way to rectify this farce?" Harry growled.
"Well Lil's I could sniff him out either way.." she hurled a pillow at him over that "James if I can't find him, I will hex you into oblivion! even if you can regenerate most mortal wounds, I will use you as a fucking target dummy!" Lily shouted and then placed her hand over her mouth in horror.
"Harry will be my martyr, whether dark or not he will kill tom, he will make me rich, elevate me to godly proportions, he will be mine both marionette and child bearer, I wish to unlock my bloodlines Gene's mixing my powerful blood again with that of a creature will bring a child like no other and then he will die as all Dark Creatures must at the hands of the ministry when I release him to them" Albus said glassy eyed unaware of the horror in everyone's faces especially with his smug smile as be said it.
Harry noted the reported written by Skeeter, before walking through to the stone courtyard towards the entrance into Diagon Alley, he pulled out his cloak and tied it to his floating trunk, making sure it vanished from view in case others saw as he walked to the bank, before casting a strong disillusionment charm on himself and tapping the bricks in sequence to reveal the arch way.
It was around dinner time when they decided to get into bed and be served in their quarters, Lily was still quite sore so had stayed there all day and just added to her cramps it seemed though thoroughly enjoyed James's antics with Harry, almost pulling his hair out having to do everything for a change.
All was eerily silent along the narrow whinding street of Godrick's Hollow except for the occasion rustle of leaves blowing in the chilled late autumn air, dawn was vastly approaching upon its' gently sleeping occupants, unaware of the tragedy it would wake up to.
"The only surviving members of the residence of number four Privet Drive could be seen running down the street before abruptly stopping seemingly caught by the assailants strong Memory Charms before leaving the Dark Mark and disappearing before the Auror's could capture the culprit."
Harry blinked at the question before indulging in a beautiful smile "Of course mother he will have anything and everything he desires and more if I can provide it, I will say this however I spoke to Tom recently he wished me to join again given my new nature he thought he could help me grow stronger which i agree with but he is still the reason my parents died so joining as anything other than an equal wasn't entertained in the conversation, I will be taking his offer but I will not take part in his war unless I require revenge on certain people, my wrist braclet here is a port key made by him, I may see you all at home quite soon if I decide to take his offer, that may soothe you Draco that I am able to cater for all aspects of your life, what say you all?" He asked.
Griphook led them back through the dark hall way and deposited Harry and Osiris back into the cart, as Harry expressed wanting his blocks removed it was imperative they get him to the ritual room and on to the raised dais.
Lily Potter lay asleep atop her husband at 11:55pm on August 30th, as still as death under their blanket. Her breath hitching slightly, atop James's cold embrace with every subtle stroak of his finger across her face.
Selkie's nashing their fangs, Grindelow's, Merpeople, Siren's, Horned Serpent's and even a monstrous Lactura (A Nessie like ancient dark creature known for sapping the magic of leylines deep within the sea bed) in an enchanted sea barrier.
To his jubilation, the Profit had reported the Death Eater attack on his home in Little Whinging, seems his ruse was successful though now if Albus noticed he was still around and not a corpse it would bring aspersions to why so he needs to hide.
Minerva put her hand to her mouth and gasped at seeing the agitated baby clawing at Severus's cloak, it appeared to be a red haired vampire child! 'Why the hell has Severus got a child in his hands and by extension a dark creature!? Why is he bringing it here? Did I hear correctly is Sirius Black the guardian of this child? That couldn't possibly mean..' "NO! Dear god please tell us it's not true!" Minerva wailed catching on, "Is this child Harry Potter!?" She pointed shakily at the wriggling bundle in his arms.
Severus was still awake in his private quarters despite the late hour, making notes in his potions journal as he sipped his muled wine, occasionally muttering to himself about the incompetence of his students when the flash of flame interrupted his musings and drew his attention to Fawkes' sudden appearance in his study along with a note clutched in his talons.
"Shut it you devil woman before I find out how the unforgivables affect a painting! I'm sure an AK will at least destroy your permanent sticking charm so I can finally be rid of your nonsense!" He said in response as he pulled the curtain around her closed on her once more, her reply tapering off much to the amused snort of Remus standing at the top of the stairs eyeing him with mischievous smirk, lighting up his usually gaunt and haggard appearance.
Harry contemplated for a moment 'that's a reasonable request and the being is very powerful from the looks of it, eh what the hell' "I Harry James Potter, swear on my blood and my magic that I shall destroy Albus Dumbledore, Tom Marvolo Riddle, Nylar Septimus and bring both us creature's and wizards into a better Era of Magic so have I said so mote it be!" He felt the rush of his magic binding the agreement and sealing his fate should he ever differ, the Shaytan nodded in acknowledgment, satisfied that the future was safe due to his actions now, he may be considered an evil entity and he was but as an immortal more or less he understood the need for a better future, extinction was not something he wished to deal with.
'I truly hope that woman keeps her grubby hands out of this situation, if I am to get this done smoothly under the radar for Lord Black, I am doubtful this Mr Snape has the skill despite his ex Death Eater status, it takes more to house a child with such afflictions' she thought as she found her way to his office door.
"That's Kiss worthy offences of possible child endangerment and misuse of authority at the very least if she is convicted, which given I knew both you and Auror Black was waiting for us in my office gives enough official evidence to the thought, did she manage to even get in the room before you got her? She can't know the information without authorisation, which I actually told her before I went to collect Dedalus!" She spat.
Griphook glanced at the sheet before smirking voraciously "Well Mr Potter I can certainly inform you she is in fact living there though only us Goblins know of it", "I see you are also a Dark Chimera like I suspected, are you aware of what that entails?", Harry quirks an eyebrow "The sapping of Dark Creature magic as sustenance?" He asks, "Yes, I wouldn't be surprised if you are already feeling said urge to sap the magical properties around you after a strenuous inheritance, be assured we have a selection for you down below for this occasion however afterwards you will have to find your own sources with the powers you will gain" Griphook responds cordially "Now could you do the same to this rites to succession parchment to reveal your estate holdings?" Harry nods and takes the second sheet handed to him.
"Today we will be making a simple draught to cure boils, instructions are on the board, pay heed to the steps if you misstep and create a poison, instead of antidote, I will be testing the failures on your precious pets" he said coldly to the room at large who couldn't help but gasp as he smiled grimly at their discomfort.
He walked down the dungeon corridor and turned right, into his private lab and placed the contents in his arms on the stone table in the middle of the room, beside the simmering cauldron he had planned to use for the potion.
"They are mine, they are perfect for me" Harry said with an intense gleam in his golden eyes, he forgot to even look at the other occupant which sat and smirked at him despite knowing its eventual fate, it also knew and respected the power and the wonder on Harry's face, it knew for once someone wasn't as foolish as to disregard these creatures beside him.
Draco looked at him in horror "How dare you call my mate a thing! I saw that his instincts had taken over earlier I know for a fact he has not changed enough to not have human morals, his additions only add to his magical capabilities meaning I am safest with him! Can't you see what this will grant you now that fate blessed us with the possibility of rejuvenating long lost Malfoy Gene's! We will have children of his Chimera abilities and our ancestors Incubi Gene's! Hell he could awaken my own with his power! Wouldn't that make us much more powerful than we are? He is an asset and one I am deeply enamored with, please give your blessing without being ordered to or we will have a falling out father" he said upset that his father couldn't see the opportunity for what it was.
"Potter!, what the hell do you want, why are you here? Profit said you were finally gutted by Death Eaters, what's up with your change in visage?" Draco sneered while Blaise eyed him with cool interest and Pansy with open disdain.
"Remus my boy, Sirius informed me of your arrival though I confess that was quick, Harry is sleeping right now in the cot over there" he pointed at the cot he had moved into a corner of the room beside the book cases, Remus peered at the boy softly snuggled up there for a moment before his eyes narrowed and he shouted "What have you done Albus I can detect your signature all over him and it seems he is under a fucking glamour, what is the meaning of this? You know a glamour will drop after an adoption ritual it changes the genetic make up! So why go through the trouble!?" Deep anger evident in his voice at the audacity.
It forced Voldemort to throw up a simple shield spell to dodge his welcoming parties attack, his cruel laughter could be heard over the static charge quite clearly "Thisss isss preciousss a mere houssee elf challengesss I to a duel? You have made your grave little elf Avada Kedavra!" Green light broke through his shield and hit the elf in the face as it toppled to the floor in a blank lifeless stare in front of a sobbing parent and child.
"Calm down Lil's, Snape has been, I fed Harry, he is just lively as this is the first he has seen of the world and of us, it is common for an infant vampire to be very inquisitive early on, I must say though he is amazing, I thought he might be like Tonks last night his eyes kept changing colours, it was intriguing but I don't know what Nymphadora was like so young and she is only in her third year right now so we won't know until she is away from Hogwarts for the holidays, do you think Ted or Dromeda might know how to test him?" James asked in contemplation.
"He absorbed a Lactura, a Pureblood Vampire, a Boggart, a Basillisk, a three headed infant Hydra, a Nightmare Double, a Shadow Dragon and Ironbelly Hybrid and most notably a very intelligent Shaytan" he said as he bit back the pain coursing through him, thanks to the loyalty bond lashing out for giving information to the boys enemy.
"Ms Peterson, look at the instructions I only just put on the board and tell me why you have already committed a mistake in preparing to brew the potion?" He sneered at the bespectacled Hufflepuff girl quaking under his glare.
I will be posting weekly updates from now on, I have a lot of interesting things for later chapters though Harry may turn pretty OP with his abilities especially under Snapes watch, his Animagus will be immense too #spoilers
"Welcome to the ministry of magic visitors entrance, what are your names? And what is the purpose of your visit today?" A mechanical female voice said, "Auror Sirius Black here to escourt Peter Pettigrew for interrogation, I am also here to talk to Familial Affairs Office on behalf of Severus Snape and as the Guardian of one Harold James Potter!" Sirius spoke confidently.
Blaise immediately stunned and bound Osiris as instructed, before casting "Locamotor Mortis!" And dragging the thieving Dark Elf deeper into the Manor, towards the Dungeons with two Death Eaters flanking him either side as he walked off, leaving Draco to spell Harry up to his room and settle him into the sheets until he awoke again.
"You insolent welp! If it wasn't for your saint Potter's poor taste in guardianship, I would gladly give you the boy however you are unfit to raise this child, you are but a man child yourself! Don't speak of responsibility or duties you have no clue about carrying out! I am taking him where he can be cared for as that is my duty as a civil servant teacher! When a child is in need despite what blood he may possess I am capable of deducing the correct procedure to handle them, I am not asking to be its' legal guardian you mongrel, we are needing a source to plan a way for this child to live you ungrateful swine!" Severus shouted as pushed past Sirius with the wailing, wriggling baby in his arms, towards the Great Halls large oak doors.
"Fawkes my friend you know what to do, rouse and alert Severus to come to the hospital wing I will write a note requesting the potions we need" he wrote a quick note, handed it to Fawkes and in a flash of flame Fawkes was gone leaving Dumbledore to walk towards the Hospital Wing and find Poppy.
Realising he only had but a moment to levitate it inside the pub before the bus left, Harry walked quickly inside, still mulling over his recent confrontation and allowing the soft bell atop the door to sound his arrival to all the occupants.
This emotion died a monstrous death however, when as they turned to disapparate, Dumbledore crept into view in his harshly billowing purple robes.
"Be that as it may speak to the proper department before coming to see me as these records are confidential, plus the child was not found at the scene of their deaths as you well know if you have been keeping up enough to know to even ask me!" Sonia shouted at her and pushed past her to walk into the lift before the Aurors came out to see what the commotion was about, Dolores just stood there gawking like a fish at her impertinence before the golden grills shut and she was sinking towards the lower floors, towards her destination.
(Yes Dumbledore is one hell of twisted bastard when he is feeling threatened, more so than even Voldemort and could prove just as much of a threat in later chapters, for now he was thwarted, but for how long?)
"I could floo her but we mustn't leave or his forces may find us, the fidelius won't hold if we are risky over such a thing, I will ask her to bring little Tonks over at Christmas as that is when they are next off but we will have to wait until then unless it is an emergency as we can handle Harry as long as you don't give him your invisibility cloak" she said eyeing him sternly.
"How dare they stay here in my home and plot such things regarding my godson, I hope he knows now that he has been to see Gringotts as I know Albus here was put as his magical guardian after my incarceration, he will have been given his financial records your days are numbered if you have committed line theft we assure you it is a grave sin to steal the treasures handed down in our vaults, let alone what your plans have revealed, Severus I wouldn't be surprised if Harry went to Tom despite the article, please go and follow up on that I need to see him alive before I make any decisions on how to deal with this, Voldemort may be evil incarnate but he is not prejudiced of Dark Creature's like our light community are, I know Harry would enact revenge on him for the deaths of Lily and James he wouldn't have changed that drastically but we also must find out what his plans are and how we can support him if they are in fact for the betterment of wizard kind like I think it is, even if it means a temporary alliance with the Dark Lord, we do need an overhaul of some lingering legislation towards the dark community that is unjust such as Umbridge's Bill's on all creatures, maybe we can do something worth our time for once than a wild goose chase/war!".
Specie Sanguinis - Blood Glamour, this is blood magic disguised as a glamour, used to create a puppet of the victim who's appearance is doused in its affects, it is tricky to overcome on ones own and is even tricker to notice as it seems like a normal glamour.
