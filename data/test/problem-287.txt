"We need a plan," Ginny said hours later. She gestured at the files they all held, and that were piled up by their feet. "We need to figure out who might've taken the boys. Whittle these suspects down. Malfoy - do you have any idea what we should be searching for?" she asked and Malfoy took a shaky breath, obviously composing himself.
“Yes, that’s what they’re called,” Granger muttered at him, obviously focused on her notes. He picked up another book and flicked through the pages – it was a book on Medieval Magical Iconography Throughout Europe and he could tell it was probably irrelevant from the first few pages.
“What are you looking for?” he asked and Potter made a frustrated noise in the back of his throat.
He found them in a carriage with open seating, and sidled into the window seat opposite Blaise, who inclined his head silently in greeting. Pansy slipped in next to Draco and wound her hand around his forearm. He patted her hand and stared out of the window, trying to find familiar faces in the crowd. In the seats behind him, Crabbe and Goyle slipped in, though Draco knew they weren’t here as friends.
“NO!” A terrible scream wrought the air in two and Draco jumped, his heart seizing in his chest. Ahead, he could see McGonagall stumble, caught by Trelawney. McGonagall’s hand was to her throat, her body bent double and Draco pushed ahead through the crowd, breaking into the fresh air of the courtyard to see…
He woke sometime later, and the tent had gone dark. Potter was still sitting next to him, glasses removed, propped up against the headboard, his head lolling down against his chest which rose and fell as he breathed. Draco tested pulling his wrist free and though the Mark grew warmer, it didn’t burn as it had previously. He nudged Potter in the side and he startled a little and then blinked sleepily down at Draco.
Harry looked with wide eyes between the two of them. They looked rather stunning together in the same light. Astoria was gorgeous, downright beautiful, her hair had flowers braided into it as if they represented a crown. Her hair hung to the middle of her back; the bodice of her dress fit to her tightly. The corset of her dress accented what Harry thought were maybe her already natural growing curves. Her skirt was long and elegant and a gleaming shimmering white. Her dress was white and silver and Harry didn’t have much of a fashion sense but he was sure Hermione would find her dress absolutely lovely.
“Oh yes, Colin helped me find it. He’s an interesting guy. Have you met him?” Harry asked. He was still standing in the middle of the room. She stood up from her chair, and pushed it back under the desk. She grabbed the crook of his arm and guided him to face away from her while she walked away.
“Harry! You could’ve at least checked a map! Why’d you come here?” Hermione whacked him on the arm. Harry grunted. Ron just stared at him.
A home he had to clean, constantly. Where the hell did all the dirt come from anyway? It’s not as if the royalties track in dirt, they hardly ever even leave the castle. Harry scoffed to the empty hallway as he idly brushed the floor with his broom. So where the hell did it all come from?
“I’ll tell you mine then.” Luna whispered. She sat down on the ground next to him. They sat there in silence for several minutes. Harry almost wondered if he’d misheard her, until she started talking.
“She’s busy with the Queen, Malfoy. What do you care? As long as I understand the point of me being with you on this trip, it doesn’t matter. Go about your daily duties, I have cleaning to get back to.” Harry sighed. Draco took a step toward him. Harry didn’t move away, but shrunk back at the sudden closeness.
“Let’s go select your clothes for dinner, and get Draco fitted into something nice.” She walked out of the room, leaving him mouth agape staring after her. He walked down the hall, perhaps she just didn’t want to talk about his personal business. They reached the room Harry shared with Draco and Luna invited herself in. Harry paused for a moment before entering.
“Alright, but if you try anything Potter, I’ll hex you into the next year,” Draco whispered and began to sit up. Harry was about to inquire what the blonde was doing until Draco grabbed the bottom hem of his shirt and began to carefully lift it over his head. Harry was sure his eyes were as wide as saucers. He wasn’t expecting the boy to take off his shirt at all, he figured maybe he’d massage over the boy’s shirt.
Harry hadn’t noticed that the royals had gone quiet. Harry flicked his eyes up to their faces and blushed when he realized he’d been caught staring. Draco glared at him through squinting eyes, and Astoria seemed flustered.
“I’m Harry Potter, and as you already know I’m the servant to Prince Malfoy.” He finished cutting up his potatoes, and he scooped them all into a large clay bowl.
“Who are you? How did you get into the castle? How dare you just walk towards Lady Astoria? Filthy bastard, what were you planning to do to her?” The guard started dragging Harry towards what he presumed to be the door to the castle to throw him out.
Harry pulled away from the hug and looked up to see Draco walking down the hill towards them, a bag slung over his shoulders. He tossed it at Harry, who fumbled to catch it, and draped the bag over the horn of the saddle.
Anywhere was better than home though. He would deal with Draco’s shit one hundred times over, and it would still be better than watching his mother die in front of him. He opened the back door to the castle and walked into the servant's room and sat down at one of the common room’s tables.
“It wasn’t called that when I lived there. When I was growing up it was Hogsmeade. Where did you live in the kingdom?” She asked. Harry started carving the dirt out from under his fingernails. Nitpicking really.
She led him to a shop that had a large white canopy over it. The sun was bright and cast large shadows into the tent. A woman was standing just inside the entrance. She smiled brightly at Luna, who hopped down from her horse and hugged the woman tight.
“I said that I would only like to do it for my Prince.”
Harry woke up in his room. He couldn’t remember falling asleep. He blinked slowly, vision coming to him in waves, and then a splitting pain forced its way into his head from the smallest crevices of his brain. He groaned. Luna rushed to his bedside. Hermione and Ron were with her, standing in the background.
“You couldn’t keep your eyes off him while he was changing.” She smirked. Harry growled.
She smiled at him over her shoulder as she walked into a connected room. He looked around and realized in that moment, there were no fire ovens or pots to cook things in this room, so she must’ve gone to cook them in a separate room.
Draco smirked, and Cedric chuckled, before walking out of the room. Harry looked up at the blonde, confused. Draco gestured to the dirty dishes on the table.
“I mean honestly, I think he’d take it as a compliment.” Ron shrugged. He yelped when Hermione grabbed a book off of one of her many stacks, and hit him with it. “Ow! ‘Mione.” He whined. “Don’t stress your back muscles. You’ll pull the bandage off.”
“I find it best to start on the end where the stairs are not, so that when you work your way over, we can go straight up the stairs. I have a system. If Queen Narcissa decides to keep you, which I hope she does, she’ll give you your own assignments, and you can clean how you want.” Hermione smiled. She seemed to do a lot of smiling, for having just been tortured the night before. Harry guessed it must’ve had something to do with Ron.
“You could do that Harry, I’m not sure he’ll answer you directly, as I’m not sure if he knows himself who he’d want to marry. Both would stay faithful, and Pansy is a frightening ruler, but she has no pity and little love to give. Draco needs a balance, not someone he’d quarrel with all the time over small things let alone quarreling over power. Astoria would bring peace, would be loving and tender, but probably doesn't have as many benefits to their kingdom as Pansy.”
He looked around at the cozy kitchen, the stone walls were littered with little cubby holes packed full of small herbs and spices. Hanging from strings that were trailed along the ceiling were garlic bulbs and drying peppers. There were cooks and kitchen maids running around in every direction, grabbing spices and a plethora of vegetables.
Harry’s eyes met Draco’s and the blonde smirked.
“So that? All of that was an act? You were just pretending to be nice?” Harry nearly yelled, his voice cracking. He hated himself for being upset, he hated himself for having had hope. He should’ve listened to Hermione, he should’ve trusted her. She’d been around longer, she’d know if Draco had the ability to care about others.
Harry stared wide-eyed at the girl. His trance on her was broken when he was hauled up on his feet by two of the men from before. He recognized them to be guards now. They lifted him easily onto his feet and threw him at a red-haired boy. He slammed into the boy and they both fell to the ground.
“I guess you could say that. Thank you.” He tucked the items into his bag.
“Luna doesn’t like Pansy,” Draco explained.
Luna walked over to him, as he left the table.
He could’ve used the bruises on Draco against him in the same way Draco had used his sexuality against him, but he didn’t actually want to ruin their budding friendship. Not when he was actually growing to like the prince. He didn’t want to believe that the prince was actually mean, he wanted to believe it was a defense mechanism. Even though he wanted to believe that, he couldn’t hold himself back from snapping back at Draco.
Draco led him around the common room. The room, he’d never taken time to look at it before, was big. There were several short hallways with two doors on either side, and one bathroom on the end. Each room held three beds, and a desk. It wasn’t perfect, but it wasn’t bad either.
Draco stood over their limp bodies for a moment before turning back to Harry. He chuckled darkly at Harry’s expression, and Harry hated himself for the chills that ran down his spine at the blonde’s laugh.
“Woo, flirt, court, date. Pick your term. He’s being sent there to impress and date the ladies who may eventually become his Queen. The Malfoy’s like Pansy for it, but Astoria is the sweetest, when she visits she’s nice to both servants and House Elves alike.” Hermione told him.
Disclaimer: The characters are not mine, they belong to JKR. Refer to notes at the end of the chapter, for an explanation.
“Um, Malfoy, I have a question,” Harry asked hesitantly. Draco looked over at him, as if previously lost in thought. He hummed in response. “Do the servants make money by serving your family?”
“Sorry, sorry.” Harry muttered, heart beating rapidly in his chest. He willed himself to calm down, before he died of embarrassment. “You just startled me.”
Harry found all of it interesting. The Prince opening up to him about his family, the fact that he was even talking to him in the first place, and that they were related even if it wasn’t close. Although Harry was sure if he’d asked Luna, she would have told him, even still Draco was opening up to him little by little.
“Ah, yes. My father discussed this with me recently. Though I had no idea he had decided without me, that I am to be meeting with Pansy, and bringing Potter at that. I am well capable enough to go on my own.” Draco frowned. Hermione smiled and bit her lip.
“I forgot for a moment,” Harry whispered, his voice wavered with emotion. Draco took a step towards him, and Harry took a step back. “I forgot how heartless you were.”
Harry waved his hands defensively, and blushed. “That is not what I meant, I’m bad with words. I’m sorry. What I meant is that you’re beautiful Malfoy, you don’t have to worry about what anyone says.”
When Harry got to the top of the hill Luna was gone, inside the house Harry presumed. He ran in the back door. He glanced down the hallways, and Luna was not in sight, he sighed and ran past the kitchen to his Masters room, and just missed the blonde exiting. Harry stumbled out of Draco’s way, and stood against the wall, bending his head in a slight bow.
“Outskirts. My mother was poor, and my father, though he was a pureblood, he moved in with her. We had a farm, a house elf, a dog. We had big open plains, but we survived on very little. He took everything, we had porridge and corn, that was it. We were happy, but we weren’t good enough for him.” Harry whispered. He buried his head in his arms and pulled his knees to his chest.
“Hey! Hey!” A voice came from behind Harry. A flash of blonde flew past Harry in a blur. Luna stood in front of Draco her hands up in defense. She carefully took the broom from him, and set it against the nearest wall. “Draco, look at me, hey.”
Panic flooded through his system as he looked around. He was in a large room, with only a single throne in the middle. There was a man with long blonde hair staring down at him from the throne he sat upon. A woman stood next to him, thick streaks of blonde in her otherwise brown hair.
Harry watched in bewilderment as Draco started his decline down the steps. Harry breathed out a light sigh and followed him.
He nodded vigorously, and agreed, “Oh yes, I’m so sorry for the confusion. Could you please show me the way to the kitchens? I was asked by the Prince to help get things settled for dinner.” A lie, but the guard needn’t know. “Would you mind showing me the way?”
Harry wanted to guess that he'd spent about an hour cleaning. That's what the giant wooden clock said on the wall in the hallway, though he didn’t quite understand how to read it. Harry was exhausted, but at least he was full. Draco had been called out by one of the guards to go talk to his father about something or another. Harry didn't exactly know, he just kept cleaning. When he'd finished he'd put the rag and bucket away and had walked into the hallway.
“Ah, yes. I haven’t eaten in a long time.” Harry looked up, but avoided eye contact with Draco. He tried to remember the last time he ate food. It took him at least four days to travel from the outskirts of Lord Voldemort’s kingdom to the Malfoy kingdom. He hadn’t eaten the night before, and he’d been interrupted earlier before breakfast.
“And what, Harry Potter, was a muggle like you doing in the Malfoy Castle?” She asked him. Harry swallowed, and his throat felt like sandpaper.
He came across a bunch of dead leaves and reached his hand out to grab them when he heard a crinkling in the leaves off to his left. He paused and crouched low in the brush to peek under the branches. The leaves crinkled again and he realized the noises he was hearing were footsteps. They were light against the grass, careful almost. Harry’s breath hitched when a young fawn stepped into his field of vision. He made eye contact with the deer, and he moved ever so slightly against the brush to get a closer view.
Wait. Ball? What ball? Was he told about the ball but he forgot? Or had Draco left that detail out?
“By August at least a third of the Ministry senior management was already
“I’m sorry, I’m so sorry,” the person said, “You need to breathe Draco,
It was like some nightmare version of a carnival game. Harry, swinging upside down with his face ruddy, tried to stick the tip of the sword through the handle of the cup. Draco, as tempted as he was to shout encouragement (and even a few ‘
“It keeps cropping up, doesn’t it?” Hermione said, snatching the book off Weasley, closing it and hugging it to her chest. “I know Viktor said it was Grindelwald’s mark, but it was on that grave and the dates on the headstone were long before Grindelwald came along! And now this! Well, if anyone knows something, we have to assume it’s Xenophilius Lovegood. I’m sure this is important,” she said with conviction and Draco nodded. Potter looked over at him from the tent entrance.
“Granger,” Draco finally managed to choke out and she inclined her head.
His eyes opened onto the fuzzy room again, and Potter was waiting for him, standing next to the window. Draco blinked, feeling a little dizzy at the fuzzy edges of the dream that crept into his vision. He hadn’t seen Potter in his dreams for a few weeks now, not since Potter asked him if he had known Regulus Black.
“All over, mate. We were in Hackfall Forest when they caught up with us. How about you?” he asked and Dean gave him a wry smile.
“Can you carry ‘Ermione?” she asked Ron, her voice softly accented. Her silver blonde hair was tied in a practical plait down her back and she had her arms wrapped around herself. “Zere is a spare bedroom upstairs if you can take her?” she suggested and Ron nodded. He looped an arm under Hermione’s knees and her back and lifted her, tucking her against his chest. Unconsciously, Hermione turned to hide her face in his neck and wound an arm around his neck. Ron flushed red but looked stoically ahead as Fleur led him upstairs.
“Are you Bathilda?” he asked aloud and Granger slapped a hand to her heart in fright. Draco gripped Potter’s hand in his own tighter. The figure in front of them, still half-silhouetted in the darkness, nodded slowly and then beckoned to them, as if asking them to follow her. The three under the cloak looked at each other but finally Granger gave one single, nervous, nod.
From behind his desk, the portrait of Madam Hilda, the first female Head of Department, cleared her throat. Harry looked up and she gave him a watery smile.
"Thank you thank you
“Not sure where,” he said, glancing over at the bunkbed through the darkened tent. He could see Potter sprawled out on the lower bunk, one hand reaching over his head, and above him he could make out the lump that was Weasley huddled under the blankets. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Hermione give him a sad smile.
He blinked again and this one felt even heavier and he tried to force his eyes open but then he was slipping away, the cup of tea falling out of his hands onto the floor below.
“Or what, Mercer?” he said in a sneering tone of voice. “I remember when you were too frightened to open my door, boy, and don’t you forget it,” he told the Death Eater, and his fellows tittered in response. “I ask again, what is all this racket? And why in Merlin’s name were there Dementors out here??”
“So, summer plans?” Theo asked. “What’s everyone got on?”
Ron turned to Harry, his eyes full of anxiety. “We have to do something!”
"Anytime."
“That the students are in grave danger,” came the old man's reply. Draco barely resisted the urge to turn around and stand to see Creevey. He wanted to see what was freaking out the old crackpots. How scary could a petrified eleven year old be to put so much fear in Albus Dumbledore’s voice.
“You read one letter. There were quite a few others you didn’t read and without them you’ve missed a lot and jumped to assumptions that are quite incorrect. I wrote back Clemonte saying I was flattered but didn’t feel the same way. Did you read the letter where he wrote back saying if I’d only give him a chance he was sure he could make me fall for him? Or the one where I wrote back saying I’d already fallen for someone else?”
Hermione shook her head. “That’s not all-”
“Is that gel in your hair, Nott?” Draco asked. Harry squinted and sure enough Theo’s hair had a sheen to it, swept back in a way he’d never had it before.
Draco stood outside the slytherin changing room, waiting for Harry to come out. He’d known the other boy long enough to know he’d want to shower and change before the celebration party that was probably being put together now. Draco stood, skulking in the shadows and waited for all of Harry’s teammates to leave the changeroom. He counted each of Harry’s teammates exit the changeroom, waiting for Harry to come out.
“Draco-”
“All of them,” grinned Theo.
“I’m very well. This is Harry, Blaise and Pansy.” He pointed to each of his friends in turn. “Theo should be down any minute. They’re my housemates at Hogwarts, which is indeed a very good school.”
His nightmares however left him tired every morning, he never felt well rested anymore and his face had started to look sickly pale. One night he woke with a scream. He rolled out of bed, his sheets damp with his sweat. Pacing the room Harry tried to calm himself down. “It’s only a nightmare, it’s only a nightmare, it isn’t real.” But he couldn’t get the big black dog, Black’s screaming face (that seemed to be unavoidable at the front of every copy of the Daily Prophet) or his mother’s begging voice out of is head.
"Ahhh, Harry Potter, I wondered when I might be seeing you. But where should you be placed? Courage indeed. A fresh mind as well. Lots of talent. Oh. Oh, yes, you've got such a strong thirst for greatness. You know where I'll put you? SLYTHERIN!"
Pansy wrinkled her nose. “That is the ugliest possible colour you could pick.”
“Oh, it really was. But watching you all get super drunk will make it worth every Galleon.”
“Draco and I worried about the same y’know?”
“Hey!” Theo protested at the jab. “I’ll have you know, not only do I not have herpes you tosser and I put vaseline on my lips every night before bed! They’re super soft!”
“If I tell you I won’t be able to get more candid ones like this in future.” Harry flipped to the back of the album and saw that there were some blank pages to keep adding.
"Seriously serious?" He loved how easy the banter always was between them. He knew he’d have a friend in Pansy for a long long time.
“That one always gets interesting!” Pansy agreed.
"You’re nothing but a sad pathetic little school girl looking for validation," he spat.
“- it was Peter who betrayed Lily and James, Harry-”
He squeezed his eyes shut and turned his over on t his stomach. Clutching his pillow over his face he screamed. It helped a total of not to release any of his pent up frustration. This could not be happening. But it was. The new image, the one of him kissing Draco opposed to Clemonte played itself over and over.
Both boys turned to look for the girl. She was standing, arms on her hips, shaking her head, face blank, staring at Adam who was waving his arms angrily.
Theo grinned and licked his lower lip. “I did it with Megan before we broke up.”
He let his thoughts meander and drift as he watched Harry take his turn and send his orange ball straight through the gate with a solid swing. When his boyfriend turned back to him, a triumphant look lighting up his face Draco gave him a lazy smile back.
“Thanks a lot Theo,” Harry said sarcastically, pulling pants on. “And no, we didn’t.”
“Sit at the end of my bed then,” Harry suggested.
Scorching hot jealousy burned through his chest every time he remembered the sight. It was all he could think about. Griffin using his body to press Draco up against the bookshelf, Griffins hands up Draco’s shirt, Griffins lips on Draco’s neck, on his lips.
Theo turned back to Harry as he bit into the frog. “Right then, so not including Pansy,” he said, chewing with his mouth partially open.
Nectarine juice trickled into Draco’s palm and Harry stared as the other boy finished the fruit before proceeding to lick the juice from his lips and palm then sucking on each of his sticky fingers.
“All of which Dobby can handle by himself,” Draco retorted grumpily.
Harry sighed but actually started working. Draco glanced over a couple minutes later to see harry gnawing on the top of his quill and almost choked on his own spit. Clearing his throat he said, “So uh, I heard Ethan Colestruckle is gay?” WOOOOOW suuuuuuper discreet. He inwardly cringed at how obvious that was.
“So, we’ll see you in Honeydukes,” Fred said, winking.
“Oh you boys are so sweet and naive. You should tell him you like him Draco.”
“I thought- but no, I guess once a bigoted pureblood always a bigoted pureblood,” Harry lashed out. Not even able to look Draco in the eye anymore, Harry turned away, pulling Ron with him. He’d thought Draco had changed, that he’d become more open minded. Harry considered the thought that the superiority of purebloods over any other blood status had been what Draco had been taught his whole life but dismissed that because it wasn’t an excuse. Harry couldn’t make up reasons to justify and defend Draco’s actions, his usage of slurs and ignorant, offensive behaviour.
Harry crawled in first, sliding over to one end, and Draco followed, taking the other end. The smell of Draco surrounded him immediately. He pulled the duvet up higher and stretched his legs, with a satisfied sigh. Harry took a deep breath, exhaling slowly. He was already starting to feel much calmer.
That's when he saw them. He picked them out from the crowd easily. They stood out among others in the train station with their white blonde hair and sharpe features. They looked impossibly regal in dark sleek clothes, not a single hair out of place. They walked with their noses up, the young boy pushed his trolley before him and his parents followed close behind. Harry's eyes landed on the owl and trunk the boys trolley carried and his hope soared.
Out of the corner of his eye Harry saw Draco bite into the nectarine. Juice spilled down over his lips and dripped from his chin. Harry licked his lips and threw down a random card when his turn came around. He swallowed hard and leaned back against the couch behind him. He held his cards up in front of his face, doing this made it easier to look at Draco without making it obvious that he was doing so.
"Next platform over Grace-"
“I will.”
Dinner was a semi awkward affair. The actual meal portion, the eating, was all fine and well. After however, was a slightly different matter.
“Yeah, that’ll do it.”
"Not half bad?" Harry nearly fell off his broom at the sound of a new, deep voice from behind them on the ground. "That was fabulous." Harry looked down to see a rough looking older boy with dark hair and a crooked nose (like he'd been punched there before) peering up at them, shading his glinting black beady eyes from the sunlight. "You're Potter. Figures you're good on a broom. The name's Marcus Flint. I'm the captain of the Slytherin quidditch team."
“Uh, for two obvious reasons,” Blaise told them. “One, he’s the only other boy here with kissing experience that isn’t Theo, who you already said no to. Two, you already bicker like an old married couple and you’ve got all this chemistry between you. The way I see it you might as well.” When no one said anything to that he asked, “What have neither of you ever thought about it?”
“Been a bit boring. Tonight ought’a be interesting though, eh?” The boy said, an impish grin on his face.
“There are other ways to end a conversation!” Harry exclaimed, wiping snow from his face.
“I’m not yelling!”
“She’s shaken up but she’s fine. Your parents were here with her in Dumbledore’s office before Mrs Malfoy showed up,” she told Ron.
“That’s bollocks!” Harry protested. He wouldn’t let her say those things about herself.
Draco knew it was a question with absolutely no thought behind it and that stung. “Green.”
"Oh shut up you two." Pansy sipped at her tea and tossed her curtain of long black hair over her shoulder. "You bicker like an old married couple."
Harry bemed as McGonagall removed the hat from his head. The Slytherin table had erupted from their seats, cheers echoed through the Great Hall as Harry joined his housemates.
“They tried to convince Dumbledore but the old man refused, said you had to go to Hogwarts,” Draco explained, shrugging, “and I’m not leaving without you.”
Draco peered up at him and squished a cheek between two fingers. “You're such a baby.”
“What else would I wear?”
Harry’s face scrunched up. “What, were they bad to him before?”
The air was crisp and the sun was nice, it was a fine day for Quidditch. He watched from above as his teammates roughed up Ravenclaw and scored again. The stands screamed and rumbled thunderously loud. Even from here, so high up,  Harry could see his friends. They were all decked out. Even Draco had face paint on. Slytherin was ahead by two scores but Harry knew that could change at any moment. Just then he spotted something gleaming out of the corner of his eye. Without thinking Harry swooped after the snitch. He lived for the thrill that ran through him when he next to free fell, with nothing supporting him but his broom. Wind whistled through his hair, pushing it back from his face as he dove. They were right up next to the stand, down near the base and nearing the ground fast. He knew Ravenclaws seeker was following him, gaining speed. He could also hear Lee Jordan making announcements to the crowd, but ignored the words.
“Oh, don’t be so pathetic, Potter.” Draco took his cufflinks from him. “Let me do that.”
Draco pulled out a chair beside Theo and sat down. “Around.”
“Aren’t I supposed to be keeping you from procrastinating? This is procrastinating, Potter.”
Harry bit his lip, debating whether or not it was his place to say anything. “He misses you.”
“Oh, yeah, Dumbledore really does it for me,” he said, rolling his eyes. “No, none of the teachers do it for me! I don’t have an old person kink! Draco, truth or dare?”
Draco was giving him a strange look. “Probably.”
The Hogwarts staff and students were all in a state of fear. Fear, is an interesting emotion. It makes individuals do and say things that under any other circumstance they likely wouldn’t. It was a rainy evening when the news of yet another attack, another dual petrification. Harry cursed himself for agreeing to put off telling the teachers. A girl from Ravenclaw and Hermione.
“Harry, you can tell me anything, you know that.”
“Why didn’t you tell me?” Draco asked disbelieving. Harry just shrugged again. “Who is it then?”
“Still it’s pretty cool.”
They were all sitting in the empty common room, the rest of the Slytherins had gone home, when Pansy snapped, "Theodore, you shouldn't smoke that shit."
“When’s he ever gonna need a sword?” asked Blaise.
Harry elbowed Draco in the ribs. “Smartass.” The other boy smirked over at him. “Alright, I’ll see you at lunch, babe.”
Harry blinked at his friends. This was all new news to him. “That must have been why Fudge tried to keep me in Diagon Alley. He wanted me to stay in the Leaky Cauldron.”
“I didn’t know you were awake.”
Suddenly his cock twitched in his hand and he sucked in a breath. Draco’s smirking, cocky, arrogant, face swam to the forefront of his mind and his hand sped up. The thought of the other boys breath on his neck, licking, sucking, kissing. Just that thought was enough for the heat in his chest to liquefy and pool south.
“Harry!” he shouted, tugging on Harry’s jumper and pointing. Below them, trapped in the terrible commotion, was Goyle, his face turned up desperately, one of his arms waving as he tried to climb a crumbling pile of junk. “We have to go! We can save him!” Draco shouted and even though Harry’s arms tightened on the handle, he turned them around and dived down.
“I’m scared,” he admitted in a whisper and Dumbledore made a small noise of comfort.
After a year of inaction, Draco graduated and Harry without anything to do, they had been contacted by Professor McGonagall the summer they turned 20, asking if they were interested in taking the Defense Against the Dark Arts and Potions Master positions at Hogwarts respectively.
He had signed up along with Hermione to take his Seventh Year, much to the surprise of Ron and his other friends, and he hadn’t looked back. Academia, though fraught with its own politics, soothed Harry’s mind in a way little had before.
turn into
!" he cried with delight, opening his arms for his bear and letting it fly straight into his embrace. Draco grinned at the look on Scorpius' face, which was elated. "How?! I thought the Aurors still had him!" he said, his bear squeezed tightly in his hold. Draco smiled. Aloysius had been kept for evidence while the Aurors had completed their files, but they released him into Harry's custody a bit earlier than planned.
“We’re off to Sherwood Forest. The wards will collapse as soon as we go, so on 3? 1, 2, 3-” and on the third beat they all turned and Draco felt himself compressed into darkness for one breathless moment before the world reformed around them and they landed heavily in a small clearing surrounded by dense woods. Granger was already on her feet, wand drawn and raised. “Can you boys help me with the wards?”
Bellatrix’s knife.
“Room of Requirement, of course!” he said jovially and he launched into an explanation about how he had escaped the Carrows and the room had rescued him.
“You tried to kill Dumbledore,” Potter growled at him and Draco bobbed his head in acknowledgement. A sudden lump formed in his throat as he thought again of that night, all the pain and terror and then that blissful, excruciating hope that had been snatched away.
you. And I’ve been chasing after you ever since,” he admitted and Granger shot Potter a concerned look.
Draco dropped the piece of paper back onto the bedside table like it had burned him. After a summer of being held at arm's length by Severus Snape, Draco wasn’t sure he wanted to sit in his office, with tea and biscuits, and discuss his ‘Head Boy Duties’, whatever that entailed.
“Yes. My mother – one of the peacocks, Albert, who I am quite fond of, is unwell. Mother has asked me to return home to say my goodbyes,” he explained, his voice unwavering even as he felt his hands start to shake. The implied meaning of his mother’s letter was not lost on Draco –
It was a compact but dense patch of woodland. He followed a narrow path inside and the ground was littered with mossy boulders, with no flat surfaces on which to pitch a tent. He ducked under branches and slipped over stones, whispering Potter and Granger’s names as he went but with no response. No response. Overhead the wind rushed through the branches and he thought he could hear the distant barking of dogs, though they disappeared as soon as the wind died down.
“It’s to help control your hunger, you become hungry at a certain time every day, or at least your stomach will be able to withstand the loss of certain meals, due to overtime work. We finish our day at whatever time we are given. My Lady lets me off work at 9PM each day. Yesterday was different, because you were found.” Hermione explained. Harry nods, his mind swimming with new information.
Hedwig was alarmed by his change in appearance and he laughed and kissed her nose to calm her down. Perhaps they should stop by a sweets shop to pick up some sugar for the horses.
“You didn't intrude on anything, and explore all you like. My name is Luna, you're welcome to visit this area of the castle anytime you please,” Luna smiled. Harry noticed how polite she was, her voice was high and sweet.

“You just can’t admit that I’m better than you at something.”
A servant walked up to him, and he turned to look at them. The servant, a large man, placed a hand on his shoulder, and spoke.
His mouth hung open, and the air left his lungs and he refused to breathe out of fear that he would scare the beautiful wild animal in front of him. There was another slight rustle of the leaves behind the deer and Harry flicked his eyes up to see Draco. He was standing poised, bow ready, arrow aimed at the deer. In that moment everything seemed to slow, Harry swallowed thickly. Draco’s shoulder blades contracted as he pulled the arrow back against the string. The deer moved out from in front of Harry, and Draco’s eyes locked on his. There was a serene look in his eyes as they flicked back and forth between Harry and the deer.
“Who are you? Are you the new servant Ron talked about? Harry Potter?” The boy pestered, he walked over to face Harry. Harry ignored him still, and hauled Ron up onto his bed, and covered him with a blanket.
“Thank you, but please don't go out of your way.”
“Excuse me, Princess Astoria told me the people with red ribbons were servants of hers?” Harry asked.
He then pulled his shirt off over his head, and the moment his skin was exposed he felt a strong gaze on him but he refused to look in the Prince’s direction. His skin felt hot under the Prince’s gaze, and it made him fumble with the edge of his new shirt. A nicer navy blue shirt, with a slight frayed hem. He stretched his arms out into the sleeve and brought the shirt over his head. He pulled it down over his belt, letting it hang rather than tucking it in. He rolled up his sleeves and brushed out the wrinkles of his shirt. He slipped on some brown boots and looked back at Draco.
“Well, I didn't bring any belongings with me, so I don't have any clothes. These are Ron’s and they don't fit very well. I thought maybe if I made money on the job I could buy myself some clothes or something. I'm not asking for money or anything, I was just curious about it.” Harry explained, holding his hands up as reassurance. Draco nodded, understanding what the brunette meant.
Once the dinner had been served, Draco gestured for more food to be put on Harry’s plate. Harry was taken by surprise but Draco refused to say anything, just continued chatting with the woman on the other side of Astoria. Luna told him that was  Astoria’s older sister Daphne. She had the same sass as Pansy but not  quite on the same level.
“Alright well, I suppose I should start telling you what you should know for the trip.”
He didn’t wait for a response before turning around and entering back through his door. He wanted to help Draco, wanted to lay beside him the way he had before but with Draco on a higher alert he wasn’t sure it was possible. He walked to the edge of Draco’s bed and watched him toss and turn.
Once the words were out of his mouth he froze, to think of Malfoy’s reaction first, after his own. Must’ve been due to their fight earlier.
He came to a rough stop by Draco, and then tried to get Hedwig to return her pace, and match the Prince.
Harry smiled, he pulled his bags straps tight over his shoulders and said, “You'll see my outfit tonight.” Draco let out a huff of laughter through his nose. He nodded, and gestured to the road before them.
“What so he accidentally hit Harry six times with a broom? Woops, my dignity slipped, guess that means I have to accidentally drop this broom on you several times.” Hermione grabbed Ron’s arm and shook her head. He shook her off and walked out the door into the common room. Hermione watched him leave, and then turned to her bed and sat down on it.
In the meanwhile Harry grabbed Draco’s belt and held it out for him to take. When Draco grabbed it from him, he knew he was fine to turn around. Draco had spent quite a while on his hair that morning, making sure it was nicely styled. He smelled of the most expensive perfumes. He grabbed his boots and slipped them on. Harry handed him his knife slip, and his sword sheath to attach to his belt. Harry grabbed the sword from the inner parts of the wardrobe and carefully held it out for Draco to grab.
Harry opened the door, and set the plate down on Draco's study desk. He then walked over to Draco’s closet, retrieving the clothes he figured Draco would wear that day. He then walked over to the window, and pulled open the curtain. The blonde groaned from under the covers.

“Wow! Would you mind if I borrowed him to give me a massage?” Astoria asked. Harry choked on his water, and started coughing violently. Draco shot him a look.
“What are you, like some kind of medic or something?” Harry asked. Luna giggled,
Both boys mounted their horses and started back toward the castle. The silence was deafening. Harry hoped Draco hadn’t seen him leaving the sweets shop. He decided to make small talk.
“Nope.” Harry crawled under the covers beside him.
"Well that 'something useless' was our assignment."
Harry and Draco ended up spending Christmas together again, this year though the Malfoy’s spent Christmas at their place in the mountains.
“I was actually thinking of asking out Megan Jones,” said Theo thoughtfully.
“I’m just saying, all the clips are a little much, kinda naff and tacky, don’t you think-”
“His mother’s family is french so I suspect most of his life- “ she told him, spooning peas onto her plate. “Would you stop glaring at that poor girl?”
“Maybe?” Harry wished Theo would just pull his shit together and ask Pansy out but then he thought that would be a bit hypocritical considering how long he’d gone without telling Draco how he felt. So he kept his mouth shut. He really didn’t have the time to be worrying about Pansy and Theo’s love lives. What he should have been thinking about was his appointment with Dumbledore that evening.
Hermione answered right away. “Go to the teachers, of course.”
“Fuck off, Potter.”
“I’m not angry!” Draco clutched the strap of his leather bag a little tighter so it dug into his palms, distracting him from the flashes of what definitely were not unreasonable anger going through his chest.
A thought occurred to him as his hand pumped himself. Theo told him that masturbation was usually better while fantasising.
Black considered this, his hallowed face looking for skeleton like than ever as he glared at Pettigrew. Finally, he nodded in agreement.
Draco grinned because it was true. “Sure, I will.”
Ducking her head back down she opened the kit, pulled out her wand and muttered a charm. One by one the fake plastic nails were clipped and shaped in the air before landing in a neat row in front of her.
“He killed her! He killed Mrs Norris!” Filch sobbed, fat tears streaming down his ruddy red cheeks.
The thought of that made Harry uneasy. “We should ask Dobby when he gets back.”
“I thought you were fine with me being gay!”
“Does it matter?”
“I didn’t! I’ve told you a million times!” Harry said, impatiently, running a hand through his hair. Why did it feel like no one was listening to him? Did they honestly, genuinely think he wanted to compete in this tournament? What he really wanted was one year, just one bloody normal school year. He just wanted to go to boring classes and get in trouble for typical student things like being late or forgetting to do an assignment. Instead he got in trouble for all those things on top of whatever extra special dangerous plan where someone, usually Voldemort, tried to kill him. It wasn’t even fair that he got into trouble for that though because it was never his fault!
"There's you,” she pointed out.
“Because I highly doubt Fudge would have released Harry to an unknown house elf. Besides, Dobby is making Harry’s favourite, treacle tart.” Harry’s mouth watered, the Dursleys had fed him even less this summer than usual.
“Charms. The last unit sucked ass, man,” Blaise shook his head. “Flitwick totally tried to trick us with some of those questions.”
“Theodore.”
Steam billowed on the platform and the group quickly made their way onto the train. They were there early enough for some of the good compartments to still be free.
Theodore took her hands in his and squeezed them. “There’s a lot of psychology behind this that I don’t totally get. What I can tell you, something I’m sure you already know, feelings don’t always make sense. This is monumental. It’s a big change and it makes sense that you’re overwhelmed. They didn’t make you feel guilty about it, did they?”
“What the fuck?’ Theo demanded as they exited their first Defence against the dark arts lesson.
“Yeah, now we can practice together.” Harry sat with his anxiety that Draco wouldn’t like it as the other boy only continued to stare at the broom, saying nothing.
“It really isn’t a problem Mr Malfoy. Usually I do all the chores for my Aunt and Uncle so this is really no big deal.”
Seeing this Pansy huffed and grit her teeth but kept her mouth shut. To soothe her Harry kissed her forehead. Pansy lifted her legs and put them over Harry’s. like they’d done since pretty much first year.
A look passed between them and Harry was filled with warmth. Students milled around them and Harry was filled with the urge to do what Pansy did occasionally so they didn’t lose each other between classes and link arms. But he couldn’t do that.. It’d be odd if he did it, right?
On their way to their next class Draco asked, “So, you and Pansy, you’re a thing now?”
Draco froze. "You wouldn't."
“No, thank you, for trusting me.”
“You do give me luck!” Harry called out to him.
“I’m afraid I don’t know what you’re talking about, Pansy darling.” Theo’s eyes twinkled.
Draco rolled his eyes and headed for the stairs, he’d almost reached the bottom of the staircase when he hesitated and turned around. “Did you get Harry gifts this year as well?”
Harry’s thoughts whirled with all the screaming and yelling. He felt as though nothing were adding up, like there were massive parts of a puzzle that he was missing and without them he couldn’t make out the full picture.
“The stupid DADA teacher in second year? The one who couldn’t even control cornish pixies?”
"So?"
"Yes, you'll want to get a good compartment before they're all taken." His Mother nodded. He hugged her and was about to turn away with his trolley when he noticed that Harry was still just awkwardly standing there.
“Yes, of course Miss Pansy Parkinson, Dobby will be back in a minute!” With that he popped away, not for a moment questioning the strange request.
“You’re such a tease.”
There was no conversation about it but the next week Theodore Nott was bashfully walking Pansy Parkinson to her classes and carrying not only her books, but her hand in his.
“Really?” Harry didn’t even look up from his essay.
Draco remembered what Claudette had said before. How did he not see it? “You were acting so jealous.”
"It's not-"
“Sorry, I wasn’t aware that I was playing the role of supportive, coddling boyfriend.”
“Hey, Draco, look at me,” Pansy says, small fingers at his chin gently turn his face towards hers. He can’t help but meet her eyes and that just makes this harder. Her eyes are full of so much sympathy and understanding. Draco doesn’t understand that because she doesn’t even know what’s going on. He’s terrified because what if he tells her and she never looks at him like that ever again. What if he tells her and her expression changes to disgust, what if he tells her and she never looks at him without anything except contempt ever again.
Draco reached over shyly. Harry watched, his lips parted in a small o, as the other boy ran his fingers through Harry’s hair. Harry sighed, content, his eyes fell closed. When Draco pulled his hand away Harry whined. “Don’t stop.” Draco’s long fingers returned to his hair.
“They aren’t talons.” Pansy’s nose crinkled and she furrowed her brows.
“What do you mean?”
“-that isn’t yellow, orange or fucking neon,” Pansy exclaimed.
“Get your nasty feet away from me, Potter.” But Harry only stuck his tongue out and Draco had to look away before Harry saw the blush on his cheeks.
Harry was incredibly grumpy and the school year at barely begun. First the Dementors had attacked the train and he’d embarrassingly fainted, thank goodness Professor Lupin had been there to help. Divination was a joke, Professor Trelawney had already decided he was going to die as his tea leaves had shown the figure of what the woman had called the Grim. What shook Harry up most about this was that the Grim was the shape of a big black dog, like the one he’d seen when he’d run away… but no. It couldn’t be. Trelawney was bat crazy, that’s what everyone said. Even Hermione. Then Professor Lupin hadn’t let him partake in his class, the only one Harry was genuinely interested in, dismissing the Boggart for him. (Though Harry had forgiven him after Lupin had explained that he’d thought the Boggart would turn into Lord Voldemort) Despite this Defence Against the Dark Arts was his favorite class and Professor Lupin was his favourite teacher. He was passionate and clever.
On the way to the living room Draco got another look at Griffin. Why didn’t boys this good looking attend Hogwarts?
The lungs do the breathing right? Where the fuck have his lungs gone?
The girl wiped away at her eyes quickly, trying, Harry suspected, to hide that she’d been crying. “Oh, it’s nothing!”
“This is revolting.” Blaise licked a thick strip up the bottom of Theo’s foot then made a hacking noise. “I need water.”
“My older cousin. He visited my old man and me last week.”
“I don’t know what that means, Pans.”
Draco gave a quick bark of laughter. “Pansy. Are you joking?” Why did he feel so shaky?
“Nothing. I wasn’t glaring.”
“Shut up! Shut up for a minute!” Draco pressed the heels of his hands to his eyes, which were squeezed shut. “He’s not Slytherin’s heir.”
He pulled his hand out from between hers and wrapped his arms around himself. “But what do I tell my parents?”
“You do?”
Before them stood Harry Potter. The jagged scar, that just as legend whispered, appearing in the form of a lighting bolt beneath his rumpled black hair confirmed it. This boy's name was known by every witch and wizard there was. This boy with his tattered clothes and crooked glasses was as legendary as Albus Dumbledore himself, and for something he likely didn't even remember. He had brought the downfall of perhaps the most wicked wizard in all of history. And here he stood before her, asking for help.
Carved pumpkins with flickering candles within floated above the students as they walked through the halls. It was Halloween and Harry was really looking forward to the feast this evening. His thoughts of the food that would be served were interrupted.
"I thought it was obvious." She sighed and sat up. "You're like his best mate, Harry. I think he's worried you might ditch him for someone else."
Harry blinked and looked down at the double queens at the top of the pile. He looked at his own hand and with slightly shaky hands picked out the double kings he had.
“Piano when I was younger.”
“Yeah, you can have my bed. I can sleep on the sofa in my sitting room.”
“Breakfast was sooooo good,” Theo moaned.
Harry swapped equally alarmed looks with Blaise and Draco from across the room.
“Please, mother, it’s not like it would have been hard.”
It was the best Harry had slept in ages, he figured it was because of the comfort of having another person, especially his best mate, so close. From that night on Harry continued to sleep in Draco’s bed. One of the two of them always came up with something that lead to Harry in Draco’s bed. They’d be listening to music, playing wizard chess or Exploding Snap.
“You really probably shouldn't miss classes,” Harry said, rubbing at his eyes. Merlin, he felt drained.
“Yes, that’s all fine and well,” Draco said. “Dobby, make us some treacle tart and tell us when you’re done. When you are find me mother. She wants you to buy Harry some winter boots.”
“Did you two fight?” Blaise lowered his book and raised his eyebrows.
His mood on the train ride from Hogwarts started off dreary. He was not only disappointed that he wouldn’t get to live with Sirius but he was also upset that Lupin wouldn’t be returning the next year as Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor because Snape “accidentally” let slip that he was a werewolf.
“Head over heels? That’s more than just a crush.”
"Maybe your standards are too high?" he wondered.
Love,
“Draco, please, you know you can tell me anything.”
“I don’t think I like girls at all,” he confessed, twisting the coloured, string friendship bracelets from Harry and Pansy on his wrist.
P.S. I thought your friend Ron might like to keep this owl, as it's my fault he no longer has a rat.
Draco was baffled when the previously inconsolable Theo came out from the manor to play the next round with them. Draco wasn’t sure what had flipped the switch but gone was the Theo who’d been completely impossible to spend any time with and now he laughed cheerful and smiled brightly. The group of them finally caught up properly (“You did what?!” “Oh, don’t look at me like that, Theodore.” “You went to a nudists beach?!” “Mhmm”).
Harry pulled a face, disbelieving of what Draco was telling him. "How's a hat meant to tell me what house I'm in?"
“Why are you still avoiding me?” Draco’s voice cracked and something in Harry broke with it. But he couldn’t do this or he’d say something he’d regret saying.
Pansy, Blaise and Theo had joined them, coming to Malfoy Manor for the last few days before they went back to Hogwarts. It was great to see all his friends, Harry just wished they were as passionate about Quidditch as they were about croquet. He and Draco had tried getting them all on broomsticks to practice before the school year started but, other than Draco, they just couldn’t get into it. Hence, why they were playing croquet.
“What?” Draco demanded, peeking out from his eye mask, which only made Harry laugh harder.
“It’s probably for the best. We’ll all be happier with less fighting.”
Draco held the bottle up to the light and looked at it through the glass. “It looks goopy,” he said, grimacing.
He felt his cheeks burn bright. “Made out a bit.”
“Telling it?” a Ravenclaw girl scoffed. “Talking to snakes isn’t a normal thing.”
“Alright, let’s get going,” Blaise said, breaking the iciness. “We don’t want to be late.”
The next couple weeks were a whirlwind of classes and making out with Pansy. He and draco weren’t exactly fighting but they weren’t really talking either. He got a letter from Sirius which brightened his mood but whenever he saw Draco with Claudette he got angry all over again. Hormones. It was just shifting hormones. Teenage boys typically got angry over stupid stuff because of testosterone and shit, right?
“We wake up all these people.” They all looked at the other patients. It was an eerie sight that gave Pansy chills. “The sooner that happens, the better.”
Draco itched to go upstairs and take his shower, to get away from this conversation. “She might have other plans. Her family always goes away.”
“Awh, Harry, I love you so much. I would hurt anyone who hurt you, you know that?” Pansy looked down at his face, her eyes wide, trying to convey how much she meant that. “You’re so sweet and sometimes you’re annoyingly stubborn but that’s okay because you’re such a good friend-” As she talked she mussed his hair up, she gasped. “You’re hair is so soft! Oh wow! Feel it Draco!”
Draco tore off the wrapping. “You got me a Nimbus2000?”
Harry stared, still shocked. “What the hell?”
“It’s good life skills, to know how to make a meal.”
"All the same. I can't imagine growing up without my Mum and Dad. Anyway, let someone know if you do spot a toad." She gave him a small smile.
Draco snorted. "A pretty useless one it seems."
“Because you’re mad at me! All the time!” Harry said, throwing his hands up.
I would also like to apologise for the fright I think I gave you that night last year when you left your uncle's house. I had only hoped to get a glimpse of you before starting my journey north, but I think the sight of me alarmed you.
I have no idea what we’ll do about custody. I’m staying in this manor in Italy. It’d be good to see you this summer I guess.
“Harry, you should know better than to make rude remarks about a girls hair at dinner. Honestly.” Her tone was hard and he knew he’d have to do something extra to make up for this little outburst.
She sat at the end of Harry’s bed. “You’re mother is in Dumbledore’s office giving him an earful,” she told them.
“Why didn’t you tell me you could talk to snakes?” Draco asked. He wasn’t sure how he felt that Harry had kept such a big secret from him.
Blaise gave him a withering look, his mouth pressed into a hard line. “You’re a git, Malfoy.”
She sighed, in frustration, wiping away her tears. “Your relationship was inevitable. Your love is the kind written in the stars, Harry.”
"Why not? She seemed nice."
Pansy gave him a long, considering, once over, dragging her eyes up his body, then tutted. “Huh, still not ringing any bells. Must be because you didn’t beat us,” she said, smirking up at him. Theo glared out the compartment window but Harry wasn’t sure the boy was actually seeing the scenery flashing by.
“NO IT WAS HIM!” Harry yelled, pointing at Black. “HE WAS THEIR SECRET KEEPER! HE BETRAYED THEM!”
“What?!” Harry was shocked.
Harry stood in absolute disbelief as Lupin, the man who’d been helping him the whole year to defend himself against Dementors, the man who he’d felt safe and comfortable with, the man who’d been friends with his father, confessed that what Hermione and Draco accused him of was correct, that he was a werewolf. That was the least shocking thing that was explained that night of course. Because apparently he couldn’t catch a break.
“Because- because people will think you’re a poof.”
“What’d’you mean?”
Sitting back down on the bench Draco took Harry's glasses off and handed them over. "You're no fun," he moped.
“Who sent it?” Draco asked.
Pansy swept down the stairs, dressed in an elaborate gold, detailed dress with a plunging v neck and sheer sleeves, covered in blooming gold flowers and embroidered foliage. Her ink black hair pinned up, showing off her long neck, pale collar and dangling gold earrings.
Warmth bubbled in Draco’s chest. “Yeah?”
“Feel passionate about that, do you Blaise?” snickered Theo.
“He’s not bad to look at either,” said Pansy, giggling. “His hair looks like it would be so soft to run your hands through.”
Draco stared at him, unimpressed, while his heart hammered in his chest. “You’re being weird.”
He was half way out the door when Draco called out, “Grab my scarf while you’re there, won’t you?”
He watched the tension ease from Draco’s posture. Harry picked up the second gift in the small pile and unwrapped a cashmere sweater.
Harry laughed because he really hadn't expected to be making friends so fast. Giddiness swelled in his chest. He promptly shook Draco's hand. Harry's hand was warm. Draco thought his fingers were long and narrow compared to the other boys. They looked into each other's eyes. Draco was taken back by just how green Harry's were.
“Then he has to go back to his Aunt and Uncle.” With that Dumbledore walked away.
"But I don't. You guys are my friends," Harry said insistently.
Draco rolled his eyes and kept walking down the hall. “Right, yep, you’re right, Potter. I definitely hear the voice in the walls.” When Draco didn’t hear Harry’s footsteps behind him he turned back around. “Harry let’s go.”
“How the bloody hell do these go on?” Theo puzzled.
“I’m not sure I could pick just one. Come on, I’ll show you the ones I think my mother meant.”
“I want your friends to be comfortable when they come to the manor and I’ll pardon it this time because for starters it was the first time and in addition because it was Christmas morning.”
“I would have borrowed sweats if you’d leant them to me!” Harry protested. Pansy lifted the end of her duvet and Harry shifted over so his lower half was warm.
Harry choked on the scone he'd been chewing. "Thanks Pansy," he said, red faced.
“Dunno. Who’d send me a cloak?”
They then moved on to Pansy’s gifts. Harry opened the gift, tearing off the poorly wrapped wrapping paper, to reveal a box containing a weird sisters shirt and a collection of vividly coloured face masks.
“How was your summer?’ He asks Harry when they stepped apart.
Harry rolled his eyes at his boyfriend. “Seems unnecessary to use the knocker. Would it be weird if I just knocked?”
Pansy made a face at Blaise. “He had nice hair.”
“No one,” Draco answered too quickly for it to be believable. Harry didn’t want to push him though because the topic seemed to be making Draco uncomfortable. The other boys didn’t seem to care, or maybe they just didn’t notice his discomfort in the first place.
“I should- we should go to the common room. People- they’re expecting us,” Harry said, voice ragged.
“Huh?” Draco grunted, groggy from sleep.
Draco looked up from writing his essay. A sudden coldness came over him. “Since when?”
“They’re what?!” Narcissa exclaimed. “The Dark Lord is back?!”
“Thanks, Pans,” Theo said, holding up a pastel pink facemask containing Merlin knew what.
Draco wobbled to his feet. “Potter, stop talking. You got me a gift?”
“Well you did.” Pansy did her best to calm her racing heart.
“Maybe- I don’t know- maybe I’m bisexual? Maybe I just haven’t found the right girl yet?”
“Megan Jones, from Hufflepuff,” Theo announced, chest puffed out. “ I finally worked up the nerve.”
“Draco, Mrs Clemonte will be coming for dinner this evening. She wanted to catch up during the holidays but since she couldn’t make the Christmas dinner due to her catching a terrible cold she wrote a letter saying she wanted to come over to this evening's dinner. It’s awfully last minute, I know, it’s lucky we didn’t already have plans,” he heard Mrs Malfoy say. “Please let your friends know not to come down to the dining room in their underwear for this meal.” Harry grimaced. He debated going in and apologizing.
“I do.”
He shrugged, coming around to her side so she didn’t have to twist around to see him. “They kind of are.”
Harry glanced over at Draco to see a shocked expression quickly being hidden. “Of course.”
Draco let out a heavy sigh and dropped the sweater he’d been folding into his trunk to turn and face Harry. “And why, do enlighten me, would they decide that?”
“Are you bloody joking?” Pansy looked at him, clearly revolted. Harry cackled and Draco rolled his eyes at his friends idea of humour.
“Yeah, but still.” Draco shrugged and went back to packing his trunk. “ It’s fine. You’re a Quidditch prodigy, right? Youngest seeker in a century? That has to count for something. I swear it’ll be fine. My parents aren’t monsters.”
"How do you know which house you'll be in already?"
“Harry, my parents already like you because you’re Harry sodding Potter and everyone likes you. In addition, as much as I hate to admit it, Granger from Gryffindor has better grades than me in most classes.”
Harry woke up the next morning in nothing but his underwear. When he crawled out of bed he saw his clothes strewn around the room. It’d been really late the night before when he’d finally extracted himself from Pansy and stumbled, half asleep, to the dormitory.
“It just felt like part of your brand.”
Just then a girl with frizzy brown hair threw the compartment door open. She was already in her robes. "Have either of you seen a toad?"
Draco caught the look Pansy gave Harry and was suddenly very intrigued in her answer.
Harry was stunned. He hadn’t been sure what to expect but that hadn’t been it. “What?”
Harry walked out of the bathroom, wiped the corner of his mouth with the back of his palm, just finished brushing his teeth. He could see Draco out of the corner of his eye, already in bed, reading. Coming around to his side of the bed he chucked his (piss coloured) shirt to some far end of the room and shoved his pants down, letting them drop to the floor. Harry was in the middle of crawling under the covers when he froze, glancing up at Draco, doing a double take.
“You guys didn’t do it did you?” Draco looked sick.
Harry nodded robotically. Draco noticed his friends discomfort. “They’re also placing guards from Azkaban around the schools perimeter as an extra precaution.”
“We went to our place in Italy for most of July, visited a cousin in Monaco, couple weeks in Spain, few days in Poland-”
“Gee, thanks, Zabini.”
The next morning Harry, Pansy and Draco were eating breakfast together when the sound of owls swooping into the Great Hall came from the rafters to drop off mail. Draco only just managed to not ask why Harry hadn't been sent anything. He barely remembered that Harry didn't have anyone to send him anything so the two of them shared the box of fudge brownies from his mother
“Let’s applaud his bravery everybody!” Draco laughed, and turned to his family and rose his hands in the air, before pointing at Harry and grinning. “Such a hero!”
Oh bloody hell, well that’s just fantastic isn’t it?” He exclaimed. Hermione elbowed him, and he grunted.
“Malfoy, do mind if I touch you?” Harry knew that his question came out sounding weird the second it was out of his mouth. It however, woke Draco from his coma state to look up at Harry in shock. Harry was surprised to find no disgust hidden in the look.
The next morning, Harry woke to birds chirping outside the long thin windows at the top of the room. Harry dressed for the day, and looked around the sunlit room. He didn’t know what to expect of the day, he'd refused to hear Luna out any further.
“I’m sorry Luna, but I think my Prince needs me.”
it. Harry felt bile rise in his throat, as he looked at all the other servants.
I am busy in my life right now, but rest assured I am writing. I don't have a set schedule for updates since I don't have a set work schedule. An update on my life though since I disappeared, I'm 22 now, and engaged. I have two different college degrees, I've been writing my own book series outside of fanfiction, and I've been working a lot.
, and no she did not.” Harry growled at him. Draco chuckled. Harry was growing more confused by the moment.
“The reason we’re here is because I wanted to teach Harry how to dress you. Harry please go stand in front of Draco, and finish tying his shirt for him. It is wrong for a Prince to do it himself, as prolonged use of his fingers on a rough fabric would wear on his fingertips. A rough and calloused hand will cause other royals to look down upon him for doing a servants work, because it shows he does not have the power to have a servant for his own.”
A wonderful savory smell flowed out the door and it made Harry’s stomach turn over in its hunger. His mouth watered as he could hear the sizzling of the meats in their pans. He walked into the kitchen, and was assaulted with many more smells, and a warmth he hadn’t known he needed to feel until that moment. The fire in the stone oven was wild, surrounding a case of some sort of food.
“You seem to get along with Luna well enough,” Draco started awkwardly. Harry blinked, startled. Draco was trying to make conversation.
“Narcissa has surprise checks on everyone's rooms. We're servants, we shan't be living in comfort. You'll receive a lashing for every item you've transfigured. Usually Narcissa does them, but sometimes she makes Prince Malfoy do them, the lashing I mean. Prince Malfoy would never step down here.” Hermione explained, shivering.
Harry sighed. He’ll never get through to her like this. He just shrugged and responded, “Well he’s not a fucking good one either.” He couldn’t help but think back to when Draco had apologized, and he suddenly felt bad for bringing up the broom incident again. He did say he had forgiven Draco and here he was talking bad about him in earshot.
“No, I never said I did,” He countered, and took a step back. “You didn’t answer my original question. Stop avoiding the question Luna.”
“Well you look loads better than the last time I saw you. Got an upgrade, did you?” She flicked her eyes to Harry and he felt his heart seize. He fought to keep his expression calm and serious as Draco had told him to do.
“You like those?” Draco asked. Harry nodded.
“Yeah, I really like her, she’s great.” Harry nodded, and folded another pair of trousers. Draco was quiet, and Harry felt a nagging inside of himself, something in his gut that didn’t feel right.
Frustration bubbled inside him, but he understood where Draco was coming from. The girl was showing a weakness and if Harry had tried to help something bad might’ve happened to him. As to what would have happened, he didn’t know, but both Luna and Draco seemed against the aura of this castle and the people who lived in it.
This chapter was 11 pages, I swear. It shrinks to absolute nothingness when you read it on your laptop xD Anyway, I'll hopefully update sooner this time. As always, I enjoy reading your feedback!
“We tacked them up in the stable at the top of the hill. I was just going to go buy Harry some simple clothes, if you wanted to come with. We’ll wait here if you want to drop your horse off.” Luna shooed him towards the stable. He nodded and trotted off. Harry had the strongest urge to tell Luna to leave, that he wanted to talk to Draco alone, but after this morning he wasn’t sure how well that would go over.
“You have a beautiful friendship,” the barber adds. Harry had forgotten where they were for a moment and didn’t realize they had an audience. His cheeks heat, and he clears his throat. “I’ll make you an attractive man yet, young sir. All it takes is the right haircut.”
“Oh! That’s right. How’s your back?” Harry asked her. She hugged herself and smiled lightly at him. She walked over to a closet and grabbed a broom and dust pan. She handed him a broom.
He crossed his arms and glared at Luna, “Loony, what if I was naked when you barged in? At least knock.” His eyes flicked to Harry’s and smirked when he saw the flustered look on the servants face.
Somehow Harry thought Hermione was wrong. Luna wasn’t stupid, she’d gone to the Malfoy’s after Voldemort had taken over her kingdom, she went there for safety for a reason. She liked Draco for a reason, and Harry wanted to know what that reason was. From what he's seen about Draco, there's not much to like.
“Astoria dear, elbows off the table, and sit up straight, don’t lean,” Daphne corrected. Astoria sat up straight, arms off the table but still looked quite interested.
Disclaimer: I do not own any of the Harry Potter characters, the characters belong to JK Rowling.
“I don’t think I’ve ever seen Prince Malfoy alone together with Luna, so I don’t think that they would have any sort of interaction of those sorts. He doesn’t harm her in any way, I know they’ve been friends since they were children. Maybe that’s why she’s fond of him. Now that you mention it, I’m not sure why she would be. He’s a horrible person, perhaps he’s managed to trick her,” Hermione explained, her eyes came back into focus.
Harry felt like he'd been slapped. Draco was right, he'd never said anything to prove he was nice, Harry had just assumed. Harry grew more and more frustrated with himself.
He walked past the servants’ commons, to the back door of the castle. The grass was overgrown, wild wheat grew among it. There was a path leading down the hill, which forked off into three separate paths. There was a sign in the middle with painted letters, Graveyard, Garden, and Barn. There was a little arrow pointing to the right on Barn, so he took a right and wandered down the path to the barn.
“How about you Luna? Are you interested in anyone?” He asked her, nudging her slightly with his elbow, he tucked his clothes into his pack and secured it to Hedwig's side. She flushed and he hummed low in his throat. “Oh? Do I know this person?”
“Wait!” Came a shrill voice from behind him, he turned slightly to see where the voice had come from. There was a curly-haired brunette girl, running from the back of the room towards him. His eyes widened as she stepped in front of him in a protective stance. “Your majesties, you simply can’t kill him. You haven’t given him a fair trial, what is he guilty of?”
“Shut up, Ron! He was in the middle of saying something!” She turned and glowered at him. He opened his mouth, and shut it, and opened it again.
“Excuse me, ma’am. I would like five more shirts of the colors my servant just mentioned. Thank you.” Draco told the lady who’d taken Harry’s reject clothes.
“They came. The dark wizards. They ransacked my village, burned the houses, took prisoners, killed people. He killed my parents in front of me, Voldemort did. He tried to hit me, with some spell, I don’t remember. But I got away, and I ran for days. I hid in the fields, and the surrounding trees. They followed me, for awhile, but once I got too close to Hogwarts they stopped and turned back, so I kept running here. Now here I am.” Harry gestured out at the field before him.
“I especially liked the red one, and the blue and grey ones you picked out.” Harry sighed in satisfaction. Draco nodded.
“Malfoy,” He whispered. The blonde shot straight up in his chair, looking around until his eyes found purchase on Harry’s. “I’ve prepared your bath, come with me.”
He had, without thinking about it really. All the servants were young children much like himself. Perhaps a few younger than him, and a few older, but all in the relative age range. He hadn’t seen a single person as old as his parents were, not even a woman, they were all children.
Luna was behind him in a second, she brushed her hair through his curls. The gesture made him miss Hermione with everything in his soul. He missed staying up late with his friends and joking with them. He missed Ron’s rowdiness and sarcastic comments about the royals. He missed being home. ‘Home’ because that’s what it was to him now, wasn’t it? He ached to return.
“I…” He looked up at her. Her expression was calm, and he wondered, how she could look so calm when she just blew his secret, everything he had tried to keep from coming out in the open since he ran away from home. “I don’t want to cause them any trouble, they- they don’t sense my magic like you do. They think I’m a muggle.”
Luna had begun talking about something from her childhood, Harry tried to follow her story but was having a hard time focusing. She mentioned creatures he’d never heard of before, and places he’d never visited, until the word “dementor’ passed her lips. A chill ran up his spine. He remembered the dark ghostly creatures flying through the town roads of his village sucking the life out of people in broad daylight. They came in like a plague with Voldemort’s fledgling wizards and witches, and wrecked havoc on the townspeople before overcoming the kingdom.
The cockiness returned to Draco’s voice as he boasted about the origins of the name. It was as if he was preening his feathers. His last sentence was tinged with a light sadness. Curiosity peaked in Harry, as he remembered something Hermione had said.
Harry nodded, but didn’t look at her. It’s true he had gotten too comfortable in his speech to the Prince, he’d forgotten. He felt too at home here, and had forgotten his place. She sighed.
“He beat me with a broom for no reason!” Harry shouts. Luna glared at him and glanced at Draco.
“As for your judgement Potter,” She started, and Harry opened his eyes to look at her again. “You’re now assigned as the personal manservant for my son, Prince Draco Malfoy.”
Amongst the group there were white trousers, a nicer dressier pair than the others. There was a pair of blue, and another shade of brown. He’d picked up a couple shirts, mostly blue, and grey, but there was a white one. As he tried them on he realized he liked the long sleeved ones, often not liking the ones with the lace up front v-neck like the ones Draco wore. He liked the grey and blue shirts Draco picked out, but not the blue trousers. He kept the white ones because they looked nice. He didn’t know if he looked good in the white shirt, so he decided to set it aside with the other things he didn’t like.
“Do I mind if you what? Did I hear you correctly, Potter?” Draco asked, absolutely gobsmacked. Harry twiddled his fingers, and played with the hem of his sleeve for a second.
“Your magic. I can see it.” As soon as the words left her mouth, the world seemed to mute. He couldn’t hear anything but the ringing in his ears.
~*~*~
The two walked down to the kitchen, where Ron was already waiting the the food. Although his courses were for the servants. Hermione and Ron made small greetings in passing. Harry nodded his hello to Ron.
As he walked through the halls, he wondered who could have done such terrible things to Draco that could cause him to react so badly and in such a way. He wondered if Luna knew, if she knew who was doing it to Draco. He didn’t want to dwell on the thoughts. He put the thoughts aside and went to go find a House Elf or a maid to ask where Luna was.
Hermione tilted her head in curiosity, and her eyes seemed to drift. She was thinking about something, Harry could tell. Ron wrinkled his nose in disgust.
“Hermione had said that Astoria was the nicest princess. Or her older sister Daphne. Are you going to be meeting with them too while we’re there?” Harry asked. Draco looked over his shoulder at Harry.
The boots did not move and Harry’s body tensed, his head lowered even further, but the boots still did not move. He glanced up to see Draco raising his eyebrow at him. He raised his head, and backed off the wall, standing at attention to his Master. His eyes did not meet Draco’s. The blonde moved and said,
His bare feet touched the cold floor and a shiver ran through his body as he walked towards the Prince’s bed. He clutched his nightshirt closer to his skin and hoped he wasn’t doing anything terribly alarming. He stood at the side of Draco’s bed for a moment, hoping he didn’t wake the Prince with his shuffling. Tears had made trails down Draco’s cheeks, and his face was scrunched up.
“Who are you?” She asked him. He looked at her, confused. He’d introduced himself to her before walking into the barn, but he had a feeling she didn’t mean it like that. He looked at Hedwig, who was staring at him with big brown eyes. Luna stood there waiting for his answer.
“You may enter.” Draco ordered, and Luna stuck her head in. “Oh so you’re knocking now?”
“I think, I thought I saw Malfoy.” Harry furrowed his brows as he searched the field and masses of people for the brilliant white steed he recognized as Draco’s horse. It could’ve been anyone’s horse, he supposed. He caught a green gleam in the sun and turned around to look at Luna. Ulysses had galloped up behind Luna.
“You do all of that work before you eat?” He asked. She nodded.
“Ron helped me re-bandage it this morning, it’ll heal. The castle has three floors, plus the dungeons. We don’t clean the dungeons. First, we sweep the floors of every room.. Then, we wash them with bucket and rag. Next we clean the windows, borrow a ladder from the garden, make sure it’s clean, we don’t want to dirty the floors again. After the windows are cleaned, it should be time for breakfast, we go to the kitchen and ask the elves to prepare breakfast. You will help me set the table, and wake the Queen. Ron’s is the manservant for the King, but you are shadowing me today. Is everything clear?” Hermione rattled off to him. Harry nodded, and his stomach grumbled. He had a long day ahead of him. With that, Hermione took off down the hall with her dust pan and broom.
“I don’t really have one, I guess.” Harry muttered. Not one that he wanted to talk about anyway. Not to her at least, even if he didn’t really have anyone else he could trust here. He already told Hermione and Ron a little, not everything, not enough.
Draco opened his mouth in question but stared in fascination as Harry began skinning the animals. His brows furrowed in confusion but he shrugged and returned to skinning his own squirrel. Harry did not watch him, he didn’t need to in order to know that the way they were skinning was different. Harry had learned from his father at a young age how to skin what few animals they had in the area. Meat had been a delicacy for him so he treated the animal’s carcass with care as to not waste a single ounce of meat. Draco’s squirrel was missing some fat tissue and it showed that he had never worried about his next meal. Harry wound twine around the squirrel and tied it to a rod and placed it over the fire.
“Thank you, Blaise. I think you saved my life,” he said and Blaise sniffed.
“Dobby!” he shouted and the elves turned to look for him. Dobby, his tea-cosy today an unholy shade of orange, came bobbing through the crowded elves and gave them all apologetic smiles as he passed them. He gave Draco a confused look. “It’s time, Dobby. I need to go, now,” he said and Dobby nodded and turned to face the elves.
“Ginny!” There was a shout over the crowd and then a tall man with carefully styled white-blond hair stepped close, his dark blue robes swirling around him. He paused, taking in the moment between mother and daughter. “Have I interrupted something?” he asked and Ginny smiled and straightened, leaning over to kiss him on the cheek in greeting.
“Good, eh?” Weasley asked and Potter gave him a smile that seemed a little forced in the corners.
The spell coming from directly behind it seemed to spook the dragon, which roared and unfurled its wings. A second later, it realised that it was now untethered and amidst the shouts from the goblins and wizards below, it stretched its wings out to their full length and gave one, powerful, flap.
“Go on?” she asked and Draco sighed.
“Oi! Watch it, Malfoy. The Dark Lord needs you,” one of them snarled and Draco’s muscles tightened in fear. Yaxley and another Death Eater were dragging him along the corridor and Draco’s socked feet struggled to find purchase on the carpeted floor. He glanced behind him and saw his bedroom door was wide open – with a sinking feeling, he realised he had forgotten to lock it.
He stopped there, feeling his mouth quirk in a smile. He set the letter aside and scribbled a note off to the Librarians asking for anything they might have about aboriginal and colonial magic, and then pulled ‘
“You two stay here, I’ll go under the cloak and I’ll be back as soon as I–”
His renewed purpose was not dampened by a sudden downpour of rain, though his jumper was. He shivered all the more as he trudged along, following a river’s path. It took him several hours, pulling out his wand every now and then, adjusting his course, until he found what he was looking for.
“Fuck you,” Theo muttered, filling his glass and taking a shot. “Never have I ever had a crush on a teacher.”
“You aren’t drunk,” Draco said, laughing harder than Harry thought his comment warranted.
“My boyfriend.”
Draco lifted his eyebrows. “So it would seem.”
“You’re wearing Gryffindor colours.”
“What was that, mate?” asked Blaise.
“What’s he doing here?” Ron sneered at Draco.
“Draco?”
Students stepped aside for a furious looking Professor McGonagall. "Why is it that you've both decided that it's acceptable to beat one another to death?!" She seethed.
“Merlin’s saggy balls!” Pansy cursed (effectively silencing them both) and stood up from the sofa in the common room. “You two are atrocious. Harry didn’t enter his name, so now we move on, Draco,” she gave him a pointed look then turned to Harry (who rather wished she hadn’t. That look really was something fierce.), “and figure out who did.”
“No, listen, that voice.”
“You know you guys are my best friends,” Harry giggled.
“Don’t be silly, Potter.”
Draco repeated what Harry said, mocking him, in a high and whiny voice.
“Fuck, Draco,” Harry’s voice cracked. Tears welled in his eyes and he angrily blinked them back. He was so bloody sick of crying all the time. It left him with swollen puffy eyes, feeling totally emotionally drained. “You’ll die because of me. Do you not understand how dangerous-”
Draco stopped and shoved a finger in Harry’s face. “Stop. Stop chasing me down the hall and yelling.”
Draco spun around and started pacing. Harry hated when Draco started pacing. He hated watching him go back and forth, back and forth. How did it not make Draco dizzy? Just watching him do it made Harry’s head spin. “I can’t believe they’re actually making you do this. It’s obscene. You aren’t old enough!”
“Did I get the right ingredients?” he asked the other boy.
Theo’s smile faded and he stood gapping as Pansy walked away. “Did she say boyfriend?”
So this is what all the excitement was about.
“You know, Harry,” Draco started, indecisive whether telling his best mate was a good idea. But then, he’d never kept secrets from Harry. He rubbed at the back of his neck. “Fudge has told my father that he was out at Azkaban the night he escaped. That the guards told Fudge Black had been talking in his sleep, saying the same words: “He’s at Hogwarts… he’s at Hogwarts.” Black is mad, totally deranged, but… some think he’s after you. They think Black’s motive is to murder you to bring back the Dark Lord. He lost everything the night you stopped the Dark Lord and he’s had twelve years to marinate in that ugly loathing…”
“So, Theo?”
Or maybe they wouldn’t. Draco dwelled on the possibility. Maybe they would disinherit him. Perhaps they would cut him off, take his trust fund and never speak to him again. Maybe they’d be disgusted and hate him and pretend he didn’t exist. What would they tell their friends, the media?
“Wanna walk?” he asked. She nodded.
“No- I’m- I’m not,” Draco said weakly. But things were starting to add up and click into place and with sudden clarity he realized that’s exactly what was going on.
“I’ve never been drunk before,” Harry confessed. “Actually I’ve never had any alcohol before.”
She watched as they hauled their trunks up into the train as they disappeared out of her line of sight. Little did she know that she would be seeing them sooner than expected.
Harry had noticed Draco being uncharacteristically quiet. Usually if they were talking Draco had an opinion and he was very vocal about it, it was weird that Draco hadn’t spoken up. Harry felt the cushion beneath him shift as Draco fidgeted and pulled his legs up onto the sofa.
“Megan gave you a blowey?” Blaise looked shocked.
Harry felt himself flush even deeper. “I’m going down for breakfast while you wankers get over the fact that Pansy and I swapped spit.” Draco made a choking sound.  “Later girls.”
Later on that week Harry and Draco were partnered up in Potions.
“It’s fine if I wear what I wore to the Christmas dinner, right?” Harry asked.
“Yeah, I know.” Harry glanced at Draco’s face, searchingly. He seemed to find what he’d been looking for because he kept talking. “Sirius said I should do something. I don’t know. Maybe, it’s stupid, I know, but I was thinking maybe I could teach kids?”
"You're the boy from the robe shop." It wasn't a question.
“What about you, Draco?” asked Blaise.
The other boy pushed his glasses up his nose and ran his hands through his hair. “Of course not! I’m cool, it’s cool, you being gay is-”
Harry licked his lips, suddenly feeling courageous. “Hey, Malfoy.”
Flint grunted. "That's right." The older boy sucked on his cheek as he surveyed Harry.  "Would you have any interest in playing for Slytherin?" Harry grinned so wide he thought his face might crack open.
Harry’s brows furrowed in confusion. “Why would I do that?”
“No. My mother’s letter was pretty good. My father’s made it seem like I’d hardly see him. He made it seem like the divorce was just mother’s fault. I honestly don’t know what’s going to happen.”
He frowned. “He’s my best friend. I can’t just not talk to him when he’s obviously upset.”
The five of them talked about things like classes and what their parents had told them about Hogwarts for most of the remainder of the ride. Harry felt a little left out because he didn't know much about magic or the wizarding world. He was grateful for Draco, who did his best to patiently fill in the gaps. Pansy, upon realising Harry's situation, giggled. "Oh Harry! It's okay. We'll help you out."
“Who’s that tosser?” Theo muttered. Harry followed his line of sight and assumed he was glaring at the boy snogging Pansy.
"Why not?" Harry retorted.
“Let’s just trade jumpers then,” Blaise grumbled.
“Why are you angry?”
Inside the envelope was a second piece of parchment. He read it, re-read it, a huge grin spread across his face.
Pansy,
"What do you mean sorted?" Harry looked anxious.
“Well, actually, for all we know you could be, Harry,” Blaise said hesitantly, scratching the back of his neck. He seemed worried of an outburst from Draco. “I mean you are a parselmouth.”
“Harry! Draco!” Theo came bounding up between them, knocking into their shoulders. Harry gripped his books a little more tightly so they didn’t fall out of his arms. “Have you gotten dates to the Yule Ball yet?”
Overwhelmed by emotion, Harry leaned over and pulled Draco into a rib crackingly tight embrace.
“I don’t go to the opera. Even if I did, which I wouldn’t, the chances of me bringing an owl with me are a total of not. No owl? No opera glasses. This lesson is dumb.”
“I’m not,” Draco said, words clipped, expression pinched. “Merlin, why does it feel like we keep having this conversation.”
“Merlin, tu pourrais être l'amour de ma vie,” Draco grumbled. “Même si ton souffle est vraiment horrible les matins.” (Merlin, you could be the love of my life. Even if your breath really is awful in the mornings)
This obviously wasn’t true. Harry had never seen Pansy cry before. Ever. He’d seen each and every single one of his other friends cry at least once. Draco over not being able to find the pair to a very specific set of socks he apparently just had to wear despite him owning a plethora of other socks. Another time over not having anymore of the facial cleanser he used at night before bed. He’d cried about clogged pores and oily skin. The strangest time might have been when he’d yelled at Harry to kill a spider then cried when he did. Blaise when he was telling them all at a meal, as they ate steak, that cows had friends and that they mourned one another when they died. He’d been fine until later that night. Harry found him flopped over in bed crying and laughing at himself about the “poor cows”. Theo had cried when he rolled a joint he said looked “funny”. Whatever that meant. Come to think of it Theo cried a lot when he was high. About really weird stuff. Pansy on the other hand, he had never seen cry. This, unlike most of what he’d seen his other friends cried about, seemed important.
"Muggles then?" Harry heard Draco's condescending tone. The tension in the compartment thickened.
“Nothing, Minerva. This has gone on for too long. The students must be sent home and the school must be shut down.”
“No more vodka for you,” Draco told him as they continued through the maze of leaves and stone.
Harry huffed. “It really is nothing. Just some nightmares.”
Blaise snorted as he chewed on a pumpkin pasty. “Lavender Brown is nutty though, she’s all into that Divination stuff.”
Christmas was a depressing affair that year. As the Malfoys were in hiding, going to the manor was off the table. They’d eventually all sat down and made the decision to stay at Hogwarts. The Castle was beautiful, gloriously decorated, everything glistened with magic. From the trees down every corridor. It was unfortunate that the castle's stunning appearance and jolly professors and peers all happy for the holidays didn’t translate to jovial moods from his friends.
“You know why,” said Draco, stubbornly.
Harry put his arm around Draco’s shoulders. Like a friend would. “Well thank you, Draco darling. That’s very sweet of you.”
“Are you sure, these look like they cost a lot.”
“OR! Someone else entered your name!” Pansy said triumphantly.
She kissed them both on the forehead and hugged them tight. “Study hard, but not too hard. Don’t forget to have fun, but not too much. Stay on your teachers good sides and-”
“Okay, so why do you sound so bitter about me spending time with Cedric?”
"That's silly. I'd never do that." Draco didn't actually think that did he?
“Definitely not. I think you’ll be extraordinary.” Harry stared at him. “As a teacher,” Draco added. “Extraordinary as a teacher.”
“We had information we could have given the teachers that could have prevented more attacks.”
He felt Draco tense beneath him. “You want to tell them?”
"You want to be helpful?" Draco's eyebrows were raised. "Go get these ingredients." Draco shoved the textbook into Harry's arms. "I'll set up the cauldron."
“Do you dance when you’re by yourself?” asked Theo.
“Nice going, Theodore.” Pansy smirked in amusement.
Theo and Harry took shots for that one.
As the three of them followed her into the entryway Harry got a good look at her. Pansy looked older, she’d cut off her long black hair and it barely brushed her shoulders now. She also had bangs. It suited her very nicely.
“He’s my Godfather. He asked me if I wanted to live with him instead of the Dursley’s once his name was cleared.” Harry’s heart was everywhere and nowhere all at once as confusing as that seemed. Gone from his chest where it felt like it had been ripped from, clogging his throat and sunk to his stomach. “That isn’t going to happen now.”
"Hi?" Would Flint rag on them for using brooms?
“Pansy.”
“Looking good, Parkinson!” came a voice from a small group of seventh year boys.
The first time Harry experienced Draco’s tendency to spend money on lavish gifts ike it was no big deal was soon after the rumours about Harry dueling Terence, Slytherin’s current seeker, for his spot on their houses Quidditch team.
“PREFECTS LEAD EVERYONE TO THEIR DORMITORY!” Dumblesore’s booming voice echoed.
“Well, don’t you?” Draco shook with laughter and Harry stared at him, flummoxed. “You’re laughing. Why are you laughing at me?”
Draco took a step closer to Harry and reached out a hand to grip his shoulder. Normally Draco didn’t do physical contact so Harry understood the weight behind the moments Draco consciously reached out. Over the last few months as he and Harry had gotten closer Draco had realised that touch grounded Harry, who hadn’t gotten very much touch as a child either.
"Really? I had no idea" Harry muttered sarcastically as he fumbled forward. Draco moved to stand but Harry's hand shot out and grabbed at his wrist. "Give me my glasses back or I'll pour all your hair gel down the drain," Harry threatened.
“You’re hiding then,” Draco asked, feeling a wash of relief go over him, and Potter nodded, tugging his t-shirt straight. He was only wearing his boxers and the t-shirt, obviously using them as makeshift pyjamas, and Draco glanced down to see he was still wearing the trousers and shirt he had tortured Rowle in. One cuff was stained with blood and he shuddered as he remembered the screams.
“This is all my fault. I said the name. I’m sorry–”
! Unlike you! Where the Hell were you!” and she suddenly looked very tearful in the ghostly blue light of the bluebell fire. “I came running after you! I called you! I begged you to come back!” She sniffled and Weasley’s face fell.
“I’m coming with you,” he said as it was the most obvious thing in the world. Potter frowned at him.
They had entered the building half an hour previously, but it had taken a while to get to the head of the queue for the exam check-in. They had both been given badges, pinned to the front of their suit jackets, which had their names and an examination number underneath. It had been explained that there would be no names on the desks, but their numbers instead and they were not to put their names on the examination papers. Harry had nodded and tried to suppress the tremble of his hands as he pinned the badge to his suit before rejoining Hermione in the atrium, where they now lingered, not talking.
“Do you really think she knows who you are?” she asked and Potter turned back to look at Bathilda who was watching him, expectant.
He dove after them, propelled by a force he didn’t quite feel, chasing after the motorbike which suddenly spat out fire and zipped away. He was half-running and half-flying and the scene moved with him. The owl screeched again, and Draco could see her, perched in her cage, crushed in between Potter’s knees and the sidecar. Such a pretty owl. Draco had been jealous of her the first time he’d seen her swoop into the Great Hall, her white feathers and amber eyes. She had landed next to Potter and pecked at his bacon and he had laughed and stroked her neck with one gentle finger.
“I’m sorry, alright,” he whispered and Draco sagged against him, fisting his hands in the borrowed t-shirt that Potter was wearing as pyjamas. “I’d been fighting off that vision since we left your parents and then talking to Griphook and Ollivander… I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to avoid you,” he said roughly and Draco nodded, smudging tears into Potter’s shoulder. Potter pulled back, sliding his arms from around Draco’s shoulders to hold onto his upper arms. Draco hiccupped a little and Potter gave him a small smile before leaning forward and kissing him softly.
“I agree. I’ll let Hermione know,” he said before standing. He stretched, baring a line of pale skin across his abdomen as his shirt rode up, before lowering his arms and holding Draco’s wand out to him, hilt first. After a moment of hesitation, Draco took it. The wood was warm from where Potter had been holding it, and the wand practically hummed in his hand. Potter left, disappearing into the tent, and Draco took his place in front of the fire.
“Think of everything you could do with it, Harry,” Draco pleaded but he could tell that Harry would not be swayed.
“Tatiana, what is it?” she asked, brushing her daughter’s hair back. Tatiana looked up and around nervously. She was pale with blue eyes, a smattering of freckles over her nose and cheeks.
“Are you sure?” Ron asked, a hint of longing in his voice.
They moved the next day, packing up their respective tents, though Potter had to come and help Draco with his as the magic had well and truly failed now and the tent didn’t respond to his repeated wand taps. They worked in silence as they collapsed the tent and packed it up and whenever he looked over, Potter was always focused on something else, his brows furrowed as he concentrated. Once Draco was able to finish without his help, Potter paused and then, albeit reluctantly, withdrew Draco’s wand from where it had rested next to Potter’s in his pocket and handed it back.
“I’m sorry,” he told her uselessly, and she shrugged.
“So it all comes down to this, doesn’t it?” Harry whispered into the silent room. “Does the wand in your hand know its last master was Disarmed? Because if it does… I am the true master of the Elder Wand,”
“Yeah, I really do.”
“Who is it?” he called and there was no answer but the door knob twisted violently. Gritting his teeth, he sent a Stinging Jinx at the door and there was a howl of pain when whoever was on the other side tried to turn the handle the other way. There was a loud curse and then the sound of retreating footsteps and Draco slumped backwards onto his pillows.
“I don’t think you can fix this kind of break, Harry,” he murmured and Potter looked like Draco had slapped him. He stood, nearly sending Draco’s stool crashing to the floor as Draco leaned back and he stuffed the two parts of the wand into his trouser pockets. He grabbed a t-shirt that lay screwed up on the floor next to the bed and pulled it on roughly.
That night, while Weasley was incessantly tapping at the wireless, trying to tune in to some secret programme he had been telling them about, Hermione slipped out of her bedroom and came to stand in the middle of the tent. Draco, who was sitting at the dining table, looked up, one hand under his chin as she cleared her throat to attract their attention.
In all the confusion, Draco began to run for Neville, but drew up short as Neville broke the Body-Bind Curse on him and in one smooth movement, knocked the flaming hat off his head and drew from its shadowed point – the Sword of Gryffindor. The rubies caught the early dawn light and glinted like fire as Neville swung it and in a single strike, beheaded the snake rearing from the ground.
There was a timid-sounding knock on the door and Amycus barked “Come!”, brushing his wand off on the fold of his robes. A terrified-looking third-year poked her head around the door and practically quivered at the sight of the seventh-years watching her. “Yes?” Amycus hissed and she visibly gulped.
Draco had never been so relieved to see someone in his life, and he nearly sank to his knees again, though Blaise held him up.
“We should close his eyes,” Luna said softly and Potter jumped, turning to look at her. She held one of Fleur’s coats around her shoulders like a blanket, and she knelt on the ground and used two fingers to close Dobby’s unseeing eyes. She smiled and stroked one finger down the side of his slack face. “There. Now he could be sleeping,” she said. Potter, standing alone in the grave, reached up and Dean and Ron carefully passed Dobby’s body into Potter’s waiting arms and he lowered him into the ground, adjusting him before turning and climbing out.
“I do, don’t worry,” he said, pulling out the only chair left and sitting down. “When did you get here?” he asked and Hermione waved a hand dismissively.
She took a bite of the potato and spoke around it, sending debris across her place setting. Mother’s nose wrinkled as she spoke. “The Dark Lord moves tonight. Gather your wands,” she told them all sharply and the diners sprang to action, rising from the table and scattering to prepare themselves. Bellatrix hummed and chewed on her potato, ignoring her sister's questioning look. Further up the table, Snape waited until the bustle died down and closed his book, standing and sweeping away. Draco resisted the urge to run after him and ask him what was going to happen – that would seem childish.
“How dare you!” he snarled and Draco searched for Hermione’s gaze. She gave him a questioning one, and he shook his head slightly – it would be too dangerous to attempt to free them right now, with his parents and aunt right there. Bellatrix and Greyback continued to argue.
They began to circle each other.
He was not dressed for Dartmoor. The wind whipped in over the Tors and he shivered, crossing his arms over his chest to keep warm. There were a few hikers out, who gave him odd looks as he was obviously not dressed for the weather, but there were no obvious signs of Potter or Granger.
“Yes, help yourself,” Draco said, hoping his voice didn’t sound too strangled. “There’s some honey left,” and then he stood, letting the blanket fall from his lap onto the floor. Potter watched him stand and Draco couldn’t bring himself to look at him, heading for the pile of the books on the dining table instead and choosing one at random to lose himself in.
Ollivander would be in the cellars, Draco knew. He had only seen the old wandmaker brought into his house, as it was Wormtails’ job to “care” for him, but he closed his eyes against the horrors he knew were coming.
“Draco?” came a gruff murmur from the bed opposite his and Draco jumped, startled in the silence of the sleeping boy’s dormitory.
“The curse should be performed without hesitation,” Amycus said with a significant look at Draco, who looked away. Longbottom was staring up at him defiantly, his robes and tie askew and even Draco had to admire his bravery. “Like so –
“Po–” Draco said, holding up his hands and Potter snapped.
“Let’s go, let’s get out!” Ron shouted, flying past. Hermione was holding tightly to him, her face hidden in between his shoulder blades and she shrieked as Ron lurched slightly as a hot current of air hit them.
Harry had elected to answer ‘
“Thank you, Miss Parkinson,” Professor McGonagall said in a clipped voice that betrayed her barely restrained fury. “You will leave the Hall first with Mr Filch. If the rest of your house could follow,” she said and there was a pause.
“May I be excused from the table, Mother?” Draco asked, and Mother nodded. He slid his seat back and left the dining room to the sounds of his mother and Aunt whispering furiously at each other. The hallways were quiet, the Death Eaters obviously leaving, and he slipped into his bedroom without being caught on the way. He breathed a sigh of relief as he closed the door.
“I’m going to sit here for a minute,” he said in a pained tone of voice, closing his eyes and dropping his head back. Potter gave him a long look and then sighed.
The argument lasted for about an hour. Hermione had sat down ten minutes in, in one of the armchairs, and wound her limbs together so tightly, Draco wondered if it was even comfortable.
Harry dropped the book from his lap, leaned as far forward as he could, and kissed Draco.
for some remorse.” Harry sounded genuine. He sounded like he truly wanted Voldemort to find some redemption within himself. Draco knew the search would be unfruitful.
"Have you told-?" Hermione asked, and the look Harry gave her caused her to wince. "He might be able to help. You never know," she said placatingly and Harry leaned back onto the sofa heavily. He had spent years, eleven of them exactly, avoiding speaking to
“What–” Draco interrupted once more, his jaw clenched. “- happened?”
“I found glasses! There was glasses in the tent Greyback, wait–” one of the Snatchers said in excitement and Draco heard the crunching of ground underfoot as he ran off, returning seconds later. Greyback snatched something off him and then there was a pained sound from Potter as the glasses were forced back onto his face.
“Draco?” he murmured, sleep-soft and concerned. Draco gave him a small smile.
No, that wasn’t quite right. He was floating, insubstantial above the scene that played out below him.
Harry shut the floo abruptly, and hauled himself to his feet, staggering slightly. He felt sick and dazed, and it was only with a vague notion of what he was doing did he force himself to leave his office and head straight for the Auror's cubicles. There was a ringing sound in his ears.
“Easy, Greyback,” Scabior called over them and Greyback grinned at him, his sharp teeth glinting yellow in the wandlight.
Did Snape know? Draco pushed past a group of first-year Hufflepuffs who squealed as he ran ahead. He had left the trembling third-year at the door to the Dark Arts classroom as he raced to Snape’s office. He pushed through another group of Gryffindors who scowled and cursed at him as he went by, but their words fell on deaf ears. His boots, worn for a Herbology class he was now missing, pounded down the hallway as he ran, mimicking his racing heart.
