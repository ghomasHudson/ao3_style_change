Blaise’s coach was an older woman, dark hair greying at the temples and pulled back into a severe bun. She barked orders at him in an accent that said she was probably an instructor at Durmstrang, and the ease with which she fired off hexes and curses that Draco himself would have hesitated to cast seemed to confirm as such. Blaise wasn’t the worst student, parrying and shielding and riposting where necessary, but his movements were jerky and predictable, so much so even Potter probably could have bested him—and this was the wizard who’d slain the Dark Lord with
Draco? “Of course you’ve got a future—and a career, if you wanted one, I’m sure. You’re only on probation until graduation. At least it’s not Azkaban.”

? Because of course he couldn’t find gainful employment on his own (he couldn’t), he needed the Ministry to beg someone to take him on (he did).
Potter just stared, blinking silently in bald confusion at the leg, until Draco snapped his beak at him in warning. Potter jerked, nearly dropping the parchment, then quickly slipped forward and began attempting to affix the letter to Draco’s leg with nervously trembling fingers.
And the pinched annoyance grew tenser, edging out the impression and bemusement as Potter took several steps forward, enough now the moonlight streaming through the windows began to bring his form into view. Human eyesight was

Harry tightened his arms, his stomach clenching and his heart beating in countertime to Draco’s, racing at breakneck speed. “Shit, don’t say things like that,” he panted, rolling his hips. “You know what a bloody sap I am…”

about any feelings he might or might not have. That was begging to be shat upon again, really—though this realisation prompted Draco to reexamine when and why he’d resorted to relieving himself on Potter’s person in the past.
He hadn’t let himself really think about the future in what felt like forever—first because he hadn’t thought he’d survive to adulthood, and now because it was so much easier to focus on the

the name they’d agreed on. But Potter only shrugged, nearly sending Draco toppling off, and he had to hold his wings out to regain his balance. “He’s been a bit lonely since I bought him, being away from the shop with the other owls, so I thought I might keep him around a bit to help him get acclimated.”
content to be quit of it, personally. I think I’ll find a nice little corner to keep myself to and give no one cause to look my way.” Potter might have a cavalier relationship with death, but Draco was certain that once it came for
The end of May soon rolled around, and Ron and Hermione showed up on the front steps on the 1st of June as promised, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed. Neither made any remark concerning Draco already being in residence, which was a small relief; Hermione had been the one to Side-Along Draco onto the property in the first place, so Harry supposed she had put two and two together easily enough, and Ron just seemed so thrilled to be out from under his mother’s hen-pecking he didn’t notice Regulus’s room had been given over to a new occupant.

Draco clenched his fists, driven to physically knock some sense into him. “Just because you’ve got the Minister for Magic at your beck and call, ready to indulge whatever whim strikes you, doesn’t give you the right to dick with other people’s lives—”
“Choke on it.”
“Can’t—hold off—” he grunted, sweat dripping in his eyes from the effort; he was almost drawing completely out on the downstroke now before burying himself deep as he could go on the up, and it still didn’t feel like enough. He couldn’t mark Draco on the outside, but maybe inside—if he let Harry. “Draco…
Lucius had evidently worked out some sort of deal with the Ministry to serve an indefinite term of probation provided he cooperated with Aurors concerning any details on rogue Death Eaters who had gone to ground after Voldemort’s defeat as well as forces being marshalled abroad. The Ministry had allowed him a wand, though they had wisely slapped it with a dozen different Charms for tracking and limiting the sorts of spells it could cast. Draco had pronounced it humiliating and made a sour face when he’d explained the details of his father’s probation to Harry, but that had been all he’d had to say on the subject.
“Arsehole.” He bumped shoulders with Harry, and they headed back to the Quidditch shed to return the broom. “…It crept up on me,” he said with a worried frown, leaning against the door jamb while Harry locked up. “I thought—I thought I was over this. It hasn’t been…a

Several weeks of this had left Draco, on this morning, in a particularly fine mood. It was a Saturday, and Saturdays meant Potter would be spending his afternoon playing pick-up Quidditch. In the past, Draco had watched these antics perched atop the Slytherin stands, preening at what a fine broom he’d bought (well, kind of) for Potter. Today, though, he thought he might get in on the action. Even as an owl, Draco’s Seeker skills were not diminished, and he had far more manoeuvrability now than he’d ever had on a broomstick, if a bit less speed. Between his human instincts and the owl’s excellent senses and flying prowess, Draco intended to find the Snitch first, capture it before Potter, and then take off into the wild blue. The game would be ruined, Potter would be in a snit, and Draco’s afternoon would be made.
which had been nice of her to say, though Harry didn’t really see what had prompted her to say so.
try to tell me you haven’t,” he added, when Draco opened his mouth, protests evident on his lips. “Grimmauld Place has its charms—”
Potter carefully set his mug onto the coffee table between them, frowning. “…Hold up, you don’t think we’ll see each other again once school’s over?” And he had absolutely no place sounding so disappointed. He’d taken down the Dark Lord, against all odds—pouting no longer suited him.
“You definitely should have let Granger and me help,” Draco said, leaning close to his ear to be heard over the roaring applause.
Draco landed on the lowest branch, where Potter had often left him treats, then steeled himself before hopping down onto the detritus-covered ground below and ballooning back up to his respectable human height.
“Quidditch?” Ron asked, and Harry nodded.
When he did at last work up the nerve to turn around, he found her standing patiently, hands clasped primly before her. She seemed to be waiting for him, and when he didn’t break the silence in a timely enough manner for her satisfaction, she said with a smooth, clean tranquillity, “…‘Draco,’ was it?” He tried not to wince. “You’re friends with Harry Potter?”
He entered with a soft knock on the door for her attention, and she turned to smile at him—not so very bright, but warm enough—as she beckoned him inside. She was sprawled out on a chaise longue with a thick green-and-red tartan blanket thrown over her knees, and as he approached, she set aside the book she’d had open in her lap:

look—this was somehow an even worse name than ‘Snitch’—but Potter only waggled his brows. “And, you know, for convenience we could shorten it to
He had been struggling with what to say in his speech since he’d first been asked to deliver remarks—he’d never been good with public speaking, no matter what his friends said. Both Hermione and Draco had offered to help him, and while he’d been sorely tempted to accept, he had ultimately turned them down. It felt like this needed to be something he did on his own.
“…Sorry, I didn’t mean to put any pressure on you…” Harry removed his glasses and pinched the bridge of his nose. “I just thought I’d use you as a sounding board.”
But he wasn’t trying to. He was only trying to get back to the castle and its imposing Gothic architecture that was just
Draco only nodded and muttered, “Of course…” looking thoroughly out of his element. Harry winced inwardly; this was going to be worse than visits to the Manor if he didn’t find a way to settle Draco’s nerves—though that might prove difficult, given he hadn’t exactly found the time yet to explain to his extended family the precise nature of his and Draco’s relationship.
“And why have you chosen to explore the field of Animagecraft, Mr. Malfoy?” then-Headmaster Snape had asked Draco, who had sat there in the old Potions study and felt very small and very vulnerable and very exposed, because there was a
“Excellent—shall we Apparate around…” He glanced at the grandfather clock in the corner, which said it was past ten now. “Noon?”
Tedward burbled his unintelligible response around a toothless grin—and then in a flash, his hair went stark white-blond. Potter gave a panicked yelp, making a wild grab for the baby to draw him back into his arms. “Oh bollocks, look at his
Potter only groaned in pain, releasing a sharp
He threw a long look through the stack of crates sheltering him from the view of passersby, wondering what Potter and his Weasleys (plus one Granger) would be doing with their afternoon and reminding himself, sternly, that he really didn’t care.
It was only after stepping back through the fireplace nestled in the corner of McGonagall’s office that he realised he’d forgotten entirely to drop by Eeylops and pick up a sampler of the Peppermint Ginger Goose Gizzard treats.
Harry slid his own ring onto his right middle finger, where it sat cool and comfortably snug. “…Well, there’s a lot of meaning if I put it on you, I figure, and I don’t want to cheapen it.” He bobbed his head, ambivalent. “You know. If there ever came a time. Just, not saying that’s a
wish to have another run-in with the demon cat, but so too was he not looking forward to being literally cooped up here. The wincing look of apology on Potter’s face as he crept out, shutting the door behind himself, did nothing to soothe Draco’s ruffled feathers, and he passed the rest of the afternoon and early evening in a quietly brewing furor.
It was nice. Admittedly it was still a bit strange at times, catching Draco stumbling down to the kitchen in the mornings wearing one of Harry’s oversized sweatshirts inherited from Dudley, or settling in on the sofa in the sitting room after dinner to listen to Quidditch on the Wireless, instead of trying to catch an episode of
Once the potatoes were peeled, a process facilitated greatly by Draco’s frankly baffling knowledge of a bit of housewitch magic, Mrs. Weasley shooed him back into the den, where everyone had gathered—packed in, really—to shower him with gifts.
Potter dared a glance over his shoulder at Weasley, who was tapping a pocket watch impatiently, and then reached into the pouch he wore around his neck and drew out a bulging little satchel that he carefully hung on the perch Draco had claimed. “All your Wheezes goodies, shrunken down for easy transport. Be sure to use them

heard about this.
“…What’s that?” he asked, more wary than curious, as if he feared it might explode like the poor bloke’s microwave from Ron’s story.
“Bye! Back in two shakes!” Harry blurted out, cheeks aflame as he sprinted away to lose himself in the crowd.
Harry felt his knees go weak, and he leaned against one of the posts for support, grimacing. “Oh god—
Harry surged forward, capturing Draco’s lips in a firm kiss. He held there, breath caught, and only drew away when he couldn’t bear it any longer. Their noses brushed, and he could feel Draco panting against his mouth. “…I like you, Draco.”
Harry turned, gaping, to Draco, whose brows lifted in challenge. “How else am I going to kick your arse fairly if you’re puttering about on some cupboard trash? Granted, it’s no match for my Nimbus 2020, but I can’t afford to give you

“That’s nothing to be ashamed of, though!” Harry rushed to reassure him. “It’s not a

Draco nodded. “I’ve wanted to the whole time, truthfully, just…before, it wasn’t for the right reasons.”
Draco let his mind drift back, back to the broken Vanishing Cabinet in need of mending. To an impossible task he had no business taking on. To a frail, rasping voice telling him he wasn’t a killer, that he could be
Ron and the rest of the Weasleys had pooled their funds to buy him a new set of Quidditch leathers, which George explained looked pretty nice despite only being run-of-the-mill cowhide. “We thought about getting you dragonhide gear, since that’s the best stuff on the market, but given present company…”
It honestly left Harry feeling a little lonely. His friends were sat there, budged up together and grinning and jostling playfully with their partners, while he and Draco had to sit across from them, pretending they barely tolerated one another. Not that Harry could fault them—he had not, after all, explained his relationship with Draco to anyone outside of Ron and Hermione. And even
“Consider it a down-payment for my continued tutelage.” He studied Potter carefully. “…Have you been keeping up with your studies? I told you I
that all the Aurors in residence were presently marking him and plotting ways to entrap him so he could rot in a cell alongside his father where he ought to be. He kept his head down, taking great care not to make eye contact with any of them, until the witch stopped short in front of a door bearing a plate that read
, now well-thumbed, sat on the side table with an old quill slipped inside as a bookmark. “I lied,” he said, in a very small voice, and Harry tensed.
Harry lunged forward, grabbing both Draco’s hands in his own. “So hold on to me. At least we’ll be lost together?” If people insisted on using him as a beacon, a rallying point, then what good was it if he couldn’t be just that to the people he most wanted to have faith in him?
“Pretty sure it’s exactly what it looks like—an offer of employment.” Thomassen pointed to the topsheet. “I’ve already filled out most of it for you, and I’ve spelled it to add my signature once you’ve completed the bits you’ll need to sign yourself.”
, then quickly covered his mouth, looking appalled at himself and throwing a horrified look at the door before evidently recalling the chamber was soundproofed. He cleared his throat, but when he brought his hand away, he was still smiling with entirely too much amusement, and Draco got the sick feeling he’d just embarrassed himself again. “Not quite—but not
And if he was going to play like
“…He thinks we should go down to the Ministry and get you properly registered as an Animagus.”
“You know,” Potter said when he found his way up to the Owlery during their afternoon free period, “I don’t want you to think I’m not grateful or anything…” He stepped up to Draco’s branch, giving him a respectable berth but edging close enough it felt like they were indeed having a conversation. “…But it wasn’t

Hermione seemed to be thinking much the same thing, and she nodded. “I Modified their memories before I left with Harry and Ron to hunt Horcruxes and sent them to Australia. Gave them a whole new life—one without me in it, just in case…” She took a breath. “But it’s over now, and they’re none too pleased to learn what I did. Even though I still believe it was the best choice I could have made—and I was a wanted witch! Death Eaters wouldn’t have hesitated to torture them to try and get to me!”
Potter wrinkled his nose. “You’re
Still, something niggled at the back of Draco’s mind—a little worm he couldn’t shake. He frowned to himself. “…Tonks, you said was her name? The grandmother.”

Harry swallowed, a flash of just what had made him so stiff hitting him. “Good stiff…?”
Which was all to say he’d necessarily been a bit
This only encouraged it to scoot closer, and though Draco dwarfed it by several fold, clacking his beak in warning, it seemed unperturbed, fluffing its feathers importantly. Draco snapped at it, but it handily dodged, continuing to burble friendly chirps at him and making a real racket that was getting on Draco’s very last nerve.
“Well one, I was thinking I could carry you, as an owl. And two, I was going to sneak you back to Gryffindor Tower with me. Then you could slip out the window and head back to the Dungeon that way without having to worry about running into Filch or Mrs Norris. Plus no risking breaking your neck flying through the hallways.”
“Yes, yes! Now let’s see here…” Bragge tugged out his pince-nez, popping them on his nose and giving the forms Harry and Draco had been told needed his initialling a once-over. He nodded, lips pursed. “Seems quite straightforward—let’s move to the holding cells, shall we?”
“Please, I insist. It’s my birthday, after all, so I reckon you ought to let me have my way.”
“…It does make me wonder, though.”

Inside, he found another, smaller box, fashioned from wood, and when he undid the clasp, it popped open to reveal a shining, golden Snitch.

, and held out his arm, wrapped once more in the hideous red knitted jumper. “C’mon, so you don’t break your neck getting in.”
“Then I suggest you stay well out of my way,” Draco said.
“Why Animagecraft? Thinking about using it for a career? It’s a rare enough skill, I’ll give you that.”

She fixed him with a fond look, cupping his cheek. “You’re a lifesaver, Harry, really.” She then flicked her eyes over to Draco. “Make sure these boys don’t get into any trouble, won’t you?” Draco cocked his head in confusion, and the woman laughed, tapping him on the beak. “Pretty boy. Right, I’m off!”
Which brought Draco here, to the Owlery atop the West Tower of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
“Well, the Eighth-years probably won’t really be a proper class. Who’s to say there’ll be enough returnees to even have Houses, let alone whole Quidditch teams?”
heated. This was another M word situation, and there was evidently to be no discussion of the details of these spells. Harry suspected that if he wanted to learn them for his own edification, he’d need to hunt down whatever book Draco had found them in for himself.

“Waiting for me to run away?” Potter said, voice low and soft but with a tone that was nothing short of goading. Wanker. “I walked to my death willingly, you know. Gonna take a lot more than this to scare me off.”
Draco lifted a brow as he filled the teapot. “He was warning you off me, then? Reminding you to sleep with one eye open?”
closely.
, then Harry was game. He lifted a knee, and Draco nearly toppled to the side but managed to catch himself with one hand.
Draco’s lips curled deviously. His robes slid off his shoulders, pooling at his ankles, and he sent them into the wardrobe alongside Harry’s with a lazy flick of his wand. “Any preference?”
The window to Potter’s room was closed, as it usually was this late in the year with winter on the horizon, and Draco quietly buzzed the tower, softly buffeting the pane with his wings on each pass. He could catch the sounds of muffled conversation within and amorphous forms obscured by the glazing of the glass as they moved in and out of the light.
Which, of
It was three weeks now since the final Leaving Feast Draco would ever have to attend. He was quit of Hogwarts at last, a free man with nothing more than a dodgy juvenile record to his name (and a troublesome ink blot on his arm). It hadn’t quite sunk in yet that, come September, for the first time in as long as he could remember he’d be somewhere
The worst thing about being an Animagus, you see, was the fact that, after lengthy spell preparations that were entirely too time-consuming and convoluted, you didn’t even get to choose your form.
“…Right, I’d better get back, or those two’ll come looking for me again. I know it goes against your very nature, but just try and keep a low profile for now? I’ll come back later, once everyone’s gone to bed.” He nodded to the open window. “You’re welcome to come and go as you please, but I’d refrain from roosting outside anywhere on the property, unless you want to get acquainted with Crookshanks again.”
Draco took the head in his mouth again, swirling his tongue around the crown, and then bobbed down, far enough Harry could feel the tip brush against the back of Draco’s throat. Draco’s jaw worked, and Harry could tell he was trying to take him in deeper—but in all their fumblings, neither had ever really managed more than just a mouthful.
“…I mean, don’t get me wrong, wandless casting can be pretty nice. But it’s way more difficult than nonverbal casting, and if you can’t do something, period, what does it matter how useful it would be if you
“You need Herbology N.E.W.T.s for your ill-advised pursuit of an Aurorship, no? So you’ve got an excuse to ask Sprout for permission to be there, and they’re warm enough in the winter.”
After what had to have been a half hour, his hand was aching from so many shakes, and his shoulders twinged from so many hugs—happy pains, but pains nonetheless. Probably just as well Hagrid wasn’t there. He cast about, seeking out Draco in what felt like a sea of redheads, and after scouring the Burrow, he finally found him sitting awkwardly alone in Mr. Weasley’s favourite chair in the den and looking no less comfortable here now than he had on his first visit. Harry smiled wryly, heart clenching with gratitude—Draco was one bloody stubborn git, so when he made an effort like this, it
“Why—am I getting—head when—it’s—

, Draco said to himself with a hissing sort of cackle. The sight of Potter hovering midair, a bright white splotch of owl shit covering his face, gave Draco a renewed burst of strength, and by the time Potter had cleaned himself off and kicked his Nimbus into high gear, Draco was already passing over Gryffindor Tower. If he could get back to the Owlery, he could transform and take shelter inside the castle proper—Potter couldn’t follow him through the castle halls on the fancy broomstick that Draco had (kind of) bought for him.

and pulling out a memo folded into the shape of a paper crane, which fluttered weakly in his palm. He unfolded it to check its contents. “Thomassen—Auror Thomassen, that is—has requested you stop by his office in the Bullpen once we’ve squared away our business here.”
Draco snorted softly. “I can see it now: Hermione Granger, Minister for Magic-in-training.” He groaned and rubbed at his temples. “Merlin, you’ve already got a few Weasleys in there, and now Granger? By the turn of the century, it’ll be a warren of your lackeys and sycophants…”

“You do have a habit of making much ado about minor injuries, now that I think about it…”
Draco frowned. “Something wrong with swans, Weasley?” He palmed his wand, brandishing it with a flourish. “Shall we compare our Charms? I’ve heard yours is a Chihuahua.”
Draco’s brows lifted in consideration. “…Maybe being

But Potter’s idle threats were just that: idle. No house-elves came to harass Draco while he napped, and though Potter declined to return to the Owlery for another week and a half after the ‘faecal incident’, Draco was under no impression this was because he was lodging a formal complaint with McGonagall to do something about ‘that nasty brute in the West Tower’.

Draco grew more and more tense as the lift rose, though it was difficult to tell if his nerves stemmed entirely from how close they were getting to the Auror office, or if they could be attributed, at least in part, to the lovely young woman explaining to Harry in a choked voice that her father had been among the Hogsmeade residents who’d fought in the Battle of Hogwarts, and how she was certain he was only alive today thanks to Harry’s brave actions. With a sniffle and a quick hug of gratitude that was less chaste than Harry might have liked, she bustled off at Level 3 (“

as he glided over to Harry’s wardrobe, he had to wonder if all this fuss wasn’t influenced, just a little, by the dragon wanting to show off for its mate. Then again, Draco was a prissy tosser by nature, so it could just be innate.
Draco took the bag, peering inside as he gave it a shake. “…What are they?”
In retrospect, this entire mess might have been avoided entirely had he simply chosen a different perch to roost upon. As it was, though, he’d been too lazy to hop up a few more branches, well out of striking distance, and thus sat just within arm’s reach of the odd student wandering into the Owlery in want of a delivery bird.

After nearly three weeks cooped up inside Grimmauld Place, though, they were beginning to run out of ways to entertain themselves—which really was saying something. With Diagon Alley likely to be recovering from the ravages of the war for months, and Harry wary of going anywhere near Gringotts these days, there was little else to do except mess about in bed, but Harry was quickly learning there was such thing as too much of a good thing.
“Wow.” Potter whistled low beneath his breath, turning back around proper to fall into step alongside Draco. “This relationship is moving

The warmth in her voice, worlds away from the strained terror and panicked tones she’d spoken in all of last year, was both comforting and an unwelcome reminder of what they’d been through, the contrast jarring in its own way. He wasn’t the only one who felt trapped here, like this wasn’t his home anymore. She was struggling similarly.

“Well,” Hermione said, “I confess there’s never going to be anything
“No, likely not,” Draco said with a sniffing indifference. “You’ll go off and continue playing the hero and saving the day—this time with the Ministry’s blessing—and I’ll be doing my level best not to piss off the wrong sorts through whatever means I can manage. If I see you again at all once we leave Hogwarts, I dare say it’ll probably be when you’re picking over my freshly murdered corpse looking for fingerprints.” He knocked back the last of his tea, setting down the mug on its coaster next to Potter’s. “Whatever any letter I leave behind might say, hear me now when I say I didn’t take my own life, and do avenge me if at all possible. As a token of our not-friendship.”
“Yeah, sometimes. Anyway, I left him back at school over the break, but er, he can be kinda clingy. I guess he followed me here.” Potter glanced up at Draco with a meaningful look in his eye that said he’d better play along. “He gets bored pretty easily and likes to come annoy me for fun.”
“Bullshit,” Pansy spat, grabbing his wrist and jerking his arm away. She shifted until she was leaning over him, her pinched features filling his entire vision. “Everyone fought for what was important to them, back then. That’s all there is to it. We were all fighting.

“Quidditch team, too. What position?”
“Meet us? But we’re here—”
Harry hoped his smile was self-deprecating; he didn’t want it to seem he was dragging his feet. Nerves were a tricky thing, was all. “Spoilt for choice, rather.” He made a fist and placed the coin over his thumb. With his breath held, he flipped it—and it clattered to the floor on its side, rolling away. Harry scrambled after it and managed to grab it just before it disappeared under the bed. He stood back up, panting with exertion, and held out his hand: wizard-side up.

“Hm. The headless hat was amusing for five seconds or so.” Draco frowned to himself. “I’m still trying to sort out what exactly the Demon Box is.”
“Of course not. I just found it difficult to believe, despite all evidence otherwise, that you’d willingly put yourself within five feet of me.” He wrinkled his nose. “…I still don’t get it, to be honest.”
“Wow, if that’s what you do to people you really don’t like, I’m curious what you’d do to someone you
Instead, it would just be himself, his mother, and this dank, dark manse that hadn’t been entirely reclaimed since the Dark Lord had used it as his personal estate those months ago. Never before had the manor felt so empty, so…unfamiliar. Halls he’d zipped through on toy brooms as a child were now tainted by memories of captured foes being dragged along, screeching and begging for mercy. The drawing room rug had been so stained with old, black blood they’d had to
And Blaise just gave him a sidelong look, declining to tease any further on the point. He knew as well as Draco what the past year had been like—how perhaps the most dangerous place in the wizarding world to be had been the Manor, Dark Mark or no. “…So, where did you go, then, if not here—where you would have been perfectly welcome to visit had you shown up and rung the front bell like a

“Stealth and Tracking,” Thomassen said, calm as anything, unfazed by Draco’s harsh language. “We had a recent retiree, so we’re short on avian Animagi. Owls are a plus, since they’re everywhere these days, so you’d be a decent fit. You’d have to complete the training, of course, like all the Junior Aurors, and even getting as far as training would require the appropriate N.E.W.T.s, but contingent on all that…” He nodded to the file.

A wave of polite laughter rippled out over the crowd, and Harry’s nerves settled, just a little.

When he’d nearly emptied the room of all its furnishings save a handsome bookcase of mahogany (probably stuffed full of texts on the Dark Arts) and Regulus’s writing desk, Harry wondered aloud, “Won’t your parents

was nothing he wanted any part of. He munched on a treat that tasted like Raspberry Liver and Onions—a less-than-successful flavour, he made a mental note—and wondered how Potter had managed to make it into any N.E.W.T-level classes at all if this was how he approached his schoolwork. Rank favouritism, that was what it was. “How about…Snitch? Since you seem to like Quidditch.”
“Now, true, it’s…certainly
“Plenty of time for travel after you’ve graduated,” was Wentsworth’s bland response. “And what about N.E.W.T.s?”
“What a truly beautiful creature…” Bragge marvelled, before he recalled himself with a humming chuckle. “That was splendid, Mr. Malfoy. Full marks—and you’ve even learned to shift while clothed! Tremendous.” He ticked off several boxes on the form. “Now, if you’ll—let’s see… Give us a turn-about?” He waved his finger in a circle. “Let’s get a look at you from all angles.”

But that’s all the unlocking and unbinding spells I know. Do
He really was a coward, and Wentsworth was here, evidently, to remind him of that fact on a bimonthly basis.

What if it escalated, once they returned? What more could he do to reassure Draco of his feelings and commitment—especially in those moments when he wasn’t actually there? He doubted they would share
Dinner was quite the most filling thing Harry had had in months, and he sorely regretted taking so long to start reaching out to his friends and family again, mending ties the war had strained. He resolved to start dropping by on a much more regular basis; after all, Draco would never be able to be himself around Harry’s friends without frequent exposure.

“I—I’m really sorry, but you scared the mess out of me!” He scrubbed at his hair, and Draco could still hear his heart thundering in his chest. “You can’t just

Ron burst out laughing. “A

When Potter arrived with breakfast the next morning (kibble for the owls, what he’d evidently told Weasley’s mother was “thirds, ‘cause I’m famished!” for Draco), he brought with him news that there was to be a trip to Diagon Alley for lunch and to visit ‘George’ to help him prepare for the Christmas rush. “Seeing as, you know, he lost half his help…” Through awkward and not entirely sincere condolences, Draco divined that George was one of the Weasley twins who’d made Umbridge’s short time at Hogwarts a living hell (and ruined his own Fifth Year) before going on to open the joke shop in Diagon Alley that Draco himself had patronised in Sixth Year to aid his aborted efforts at murder.
“Yeah, and if you want to see it
.” Draco elbowed him sharply for the crack, but he was smiling, and he and Harry wrestled briefly before Harry managed to pin him to the cushions. “Seriously. Invite whoever you want. Guests are more than welcome. Even if they might’ve been happy to dance on my grave only a month back.”
“It’s hard. I get it. I really,
, mate…” Weasley groaned, one hand over his eyes while he blindly Vanished the shit from Potter’s shoes with his wand in the other.
Draco watched, until Potter was far enough away for comfort, then hopped from the branch upon which he’d been roosting down onto the lowest-set branch, creeping along until he could peek inside the pouch to see what Potter came offering as tribute.
“Well, yeah, but—you know what I mean.” The thought that their situation—their relationship—might in any way be a burden on Draco, chaining him down and limiting his choices, did not sit well with Harry at all.
Draco flashed him a pinched smile. “Happy to oblige.” And then in a swirl of robes, he slipped into his owl form and took off through the nearest open window, into the darkness and out of sight.
Draco frowned. Was this some sort of test? An interrogation? Were they hoping he incriminated himself? “…I think had I been the one meting out punishments to Death Eaters…I wouldn’t have been quite so lenient.” It was an honest answer, and it probably said a lot of things about himself that he was really better off not knowing.
And the poor simple fellow didn’t realise it was entirely possible for

Potter gave him a look of bemused indulgence. Draco didn’t like it one bit. “…Who would believe me? You spent the better part of five years here convincing everyone I was mad.”
Potter’s expression went funny, probably trying to figure Draco out. Not so easy to read as Potter thought, now was he? “I…I guess?”
“S—sorry,” he apologised, shuffling to the side.

“Well, in lots of stuff, really. Not just Charms,” Potter clarified when Draco came calling at his window that evening. The rest of his roommates were downstairs caught up in a riveting game of Exploding Snap that evidently involved a few side bets—as if Weasley had any Knuts to spare—so they had a bit of privacy for the moment. Potter cast a long look at his trunk—which looked brand new and not like it had survived six-plus years being toted to and from Scotland—and sighed. “N.E.W.T.s are gonna be here sooner than I’d like, and Hermione can really only handle helping one of us at a time. Them being together, it seemed only fair I let Ron have at her, and honestly I’d rather not get in the middle of all…
to do—just a ‘should’. A suggestion. There’s no right or wrong way to mourn, we all do it in our own way, in our own time, but we have a choice: to remember those whose sacrifices mean that we can be here now, to build on their lives and make the future better for those who follow, to work each day not to dwell on the sadness and sorrow but to take the hands of those beside us and hold tight as we move forward together. That way, if we stumble, there are people who care for us ready and willing to help us keep going, with us there to do the same for them.
Draco stared at him blankly, evidently rendered mute with shock at being so casually addressed by an utter stranger. He quickly recovered, though, and Harry saw his walls rise up, ready to take a beating if one was coming. “…I beg your pardon?”
“Why did I do
Granger and Weasley appeared at the door to the shed a moment later, peering around warily. “Er…what’re you doing in here, mate?” Weasley asked. “I thought you’d gone to see if Pig was back with a response from Tonks’ mum.”

Draco lashed out with a sweeping kick, but Potter was evidently learning and nimbly leapt over it, bumping his shoulder against Draco’s as they mounted the steps and made their way to the kitchens.

of the Aurors. But that doesn’t mean you wouldn’t make a good one. Plus…” He weaved a bit in place, chewing on his lip. “…Ron’s kind of getting cold feet about joining. He thinks he might be better served staying on at the Wheezes shop and helping George. His family’s been through a lot, and for him to take on such a dangerous job…” Potter reached a hand up, rubbing at the back of his neck with a wince. “I mean, I can’t fault him at all. I don’t, even. But—I still think there’s good yet that
to like Harry’s friends…he just wanted him to. He wanted Draco to feel like part of Harry’s life, a valued presence in Harry’s circle.
He gave a feeble little thrust of his hips in encouragement, and Draco grinned. “Eager much?”
“Yeah… Go on.” Draco ran his hands down his body, wrapping his fingers around his own cock and tugging feverishly. The pink head glistened brightly when it peeked out on each stroke, winking at Harry saucily. “
he’s a pure-blood. Seems to me he’d have plenty of reason to think there was no saving the Muggles and that wizarding folk ought to leave well enough alone with them. Maybe he just made that exception up, so no one would try.”
This fragile, fleeting time they had together was really all they ever
Harry swallowed. “…I just thought…maybe I’d start with them. And then see how that goes.”
“Sorry…” Harry said. “Where’ve you been?”
“I wasn’t
Potter had the grace to look abashed, and he ducked his head, scrubbing weakly at his hair with a wince. “…Well, I’m not sure it would work anyway, not after Crabbe blew up the Room of Hidden Things, seeing as they shared a pocket dimension.”
Harry buzzed Draco to get his attention, earning an irritated snort for his efforts, and then it was a thrilling game of chase, with Harry weaving through the stands and under bleachers whenever Draco got too close. There was one particularly close call when Draco ambushed him from perched atop the Ravenclaw stands, but luckily enough, the sun was in just the right position to throw Draco’s dark shadow against the ground, giving Harry enough warning to take a detour before he came shooting out from under the bleachers.
“You had
reason.”
“Aw, come on, Hermione,” Ron pleaded. “Can’t you save your new campaign for next week?” Hermione gave him a sour look, and he quickly amended, “Just, your new Ministry mates would be devastated they didn’t get to hear your ideas first.”
Well, he would soon learn it was stupid and dangerous and stupidly dangerous to sit so perilously close to the edge of a window sill a hundred-plus feet in the air—and like a harpy out of the blue, Draco streaked down, announcing his impending arrival with a screeching hiss that had Potter’s head snapping up in fear. Potter quickly curled into a ball, the parchment and quill sent flying, as Draco zipped through the open window, flaring his tightly tucked wings at the last possible moment and coming to a tumbling landing atop one of the four-posters near the far wall.
His relationship with Potter—or lack thereof, rather—therefore remained much the same in the new term as in the previous one. Draco continued to keep a low profile, never acknowledging Potter in the halls or at meals and taking care to ensure no one caught Draco flitting off for their late-night assignations. The clandestine nature of their meetings, under other circumstances, might have thrilled Draco, but as it was, they mostly made him sick with worry. If the wrong sorts caught them fraternising in the Greenhouses or connected the dots on their one-sided conversations in the Owlery, life could be made
“No—though I don’t think you’d want me to anyway. Let’s be honest, I’d probably muck it up.”

Draco stared at him for a beat, boggling as Potter’s words really set in—along with his poorly disguised intentions. Subtlety was
“No,” Potter said with more conviction and a harder expression on his features. “I’m telling you, that won’t—”
Draco jumped, he was certain, a good three feet in the air, whirling around with one hand already reaching for his wand while the other was raised in what he imagined to be self-defence but what probably looked to be an offer of forfeit. He couldn’t go five
He ducked his head. “Yeah, I figured it was about time I actually read it. Out of, y’know, respect for Professor Bagshot and all.”
“I’m—not!” Harry protested, though he doubted this was believable, all evidence being to the contrary. He grabbed a robe of his own, cinching it angrily at the waist, and followed Draco down the stairs. “You’re just being suggestive. I can hardly help reacting.”
“I’ll commission you a new one,” Draco offered, voice just as lethargic and limbs just as boneless as Harry’s. “Solid gold. Ruby-encrusted bollocks. You’ll piss Amortentia and spurt elf wine.”
. We’ll work on it.” He patted Harry’s cheek, then began to disrobe.
And because clearly this was the day for poor choices, Draco said, “Be my guest.”
Bragge was blessedly easily distracted and eagerly dropped the matter of Draco’s mysterious disappearance from the Ministry’s holding cells in exchange for tales from the battlefront. It was hardly a topic Harry wanted to revisit so soon, but if it made Draco’s registration go a bit smoother, it was worth it—especially as he could feel Draco’s rage bubbling just under his skin, heralding an imminent explosion of anger and frustration. He hadn’t wanted to come here in the first place, and now he had to sit back, quietly so as not to give anyone cause to think him unstable, and watch as Harry politely went ten rounds with every lookie-loo in the Ministry itching for stories from a war most hadn’t been remotely involved in.

a good idea, getting hot and bothered in a cramped little lift. “Perhaps a demonstration’s in order.”
Which was, he could see, currently hovering just behind a string of pennants looped under the awning of the Gryffindor stands. Potter was still all smiles as he traded what sounded like needling banter with Finnigan, oblivious to the whereabouts of the most important piece of this mid-air chess match they were about to play, which was

“You mean the Charms classroom where I physically disarmed you and regained my wand’s loyalty?”
He didn’t let himself be baited, sighing. “I mean, I’ve wanted to be an Auror for as long as I’ve known that kind of job existed—it’s what I’m good at, for one, and it…it sounded like it could be fun. Chasing the bad guys, being respected by the community, being…being the hero…” Maybe bouncing ideas off Draco hadn’t been such a good idea after all. “But after the last year…honestly, I just don’t know if I’ve got it in me. It feels like…like what people
Draco’s eyes fell back down to the file in his lap. An
“Did the card say ‘duel me’? No? Then I can’t imagine why you’d think that.” Draco reached for his wand, still weakly palmed in Potter’s hand, and snatched it back for himself. He gave it a snapping swish, Conjuring a wispy silver Snitch that zipped around Potter’s head, hovering tantalisingly over his nose and making him go cross-eyed as he tried to focus on it, before winking out. Draco nodded, satisfied. “Good. That seems to have done it. Your help is appreciated.”
. I had it delivered home.”
. Draco supposed he should have been relieved he was being targeted less by nasty sorts wanting to punish him for imagined (and not-so-imagined) offences and more by pranksters who derived pleasure from puerile taunts.
Draco was accustomed to snogging sessions being unspoken competitions—as if they could be anything else among Slytherins, always trying to one-up each other—but kissing Potter was a different sport altogether. And Draco supposed he ought to have expected that: Quidditch with Potter, after all, was like Quidditch with no other. But this wasn’t Quidditch. This wasn’t one of them humiliating the other, a duel to be won or lost. It was…
was apologising. It wasn’t as if he’d been there—seen that sad, stupid old man begging for Draco to reconsider, to allow him to hide Draco and his family, to give them sanctuary. How much would have been different had Draco had the courage to take his hand then? How much would be better? Could anything possibly be worse?
Draco sighed, exhaling loudly through his nose. “Making terrible decisions. What else is new?”
…” Grabbing a pair of weights carved to look like Basilisk eggs, he unfurled the parchment and placed the weights to hold it open while he ran his eyes over what was, he was realising, an Owl Post Order form.
Draco slid down his body until he was faced with Harry’s cock, and he exhaled a warm, open-mouthed breath over the thickening shaft. Harry squirmed, trying to keep his legs splayed when he really just wanted to lock Draco in place, until he’d taken Harry’s prick into that warm, tight mouth and brought him to the edge of glory.
“You’ve always been older than me, and I’ve never shown you any respect before. Not about to start now.”
any ‘going’ if I’m not hard.”
“I wasn’t going to say that,” Potter said, too calmly and evenly for Draco to take.
He spent the rest of the afternoon quietly sulking from Potter’s shoulder while the group flitted from shop to shop snapping up last-minute Christmas gifts, and dinner was a quiet affair in the Leaky Tap. Draco was starving by this point, but his pride would not allow him to accept the hand-fed scraps Potter offered him in what he probably meant as an apology for the harrowing experience at Eeylops. Draco made a mental note to
and all the baggage that came with it thenceforth.
Best to get this over with, for both their sakes. “So, about the Dangerous Creature forms, sir?” Harry prompted, hoping to get on with the registration.
Potter tossed the ruined jumper aside, then reached down to collect his discarded parchment and quill, sliding back onto the sill beside Draco. From his pocket, he extracted the purse of treats, placing it close enough that Draco could take nips whenever he so pleased. He so pleased right away, taking two at once.
Potter’s expression was impassive. “I never said you were.”
come morning—but he powered through, reaming in again and again and again. Draco’s head, flung back, exposed the long, white column of his throat, and Harry wished the angle allowed him to bite, and claim. To mark him, somehow.
“Well, no, of course not. Not in so many words, at least.” Bragge wrung his hands, pasting on a wry smile. “But it’s best we think of you and your Animagus form as two different entities in this case, Mr. Malfoy. As a human, you’re perfectly in control of your own thoughts and feelings—well, as in control as any of us can be! But this being a rather unique situation, and you having shown a history of…unpredictability when it comes to your Animagus form, the Ministry feels obliged to take every precaution it can with your case. With Mr. Potter’s sworn and notarised statement, you can be released into his care and go about your business.” He offered Harry his quill. “Mr. Potter, if you don’t mind?”
He didn’t say it in protest—no, he just sounded curious, and Harry turned the question over in his head. “…Once I tell them, it’ll be real.”

“That’s half the fun of it. Besides, your mother likes me.”
“No, but—” He cleared his throat. “Well we like to try and keep mated pairs together whenever we’re dealing with anything Class-4 or more dangerous.” He beamed at Draco. “It helps to keep the creatures calm.”
that he leapt to the lowest branch when Potter came barrelling into the Owlery one lovely Sunday afternoon in early November and began casting about the tower with panic writ large on his features. His eye fell on Draco, already perched patiently by the knot where it had been agreed Potter would leave his treats—and his expression fell with a sick sort of resignation.
“Oh—I

now he’d nearly died in this tower; Potter was and ever had been hazardous to Draco’s health—Potter laid the parchment between them and returned to his scribbling.

Draco gave a small nod. “It went well enough, the usual business—and then at the end of the meeting, he told me an Auror wanted to speak to me.”
After ensuring his goodies wouldn’t be disturbed, he took off again, this time bound for the Zabini lands on the coast. Now, he hadn’t had chance to visit Blaise at his home too often over the years, and on the rare occasion he had—usually for a dinner party or holiday gala of some fashion or another—he and his parents had always Flooed. He therefore did not, in all honesty, know

“Well the people who matter won’t necessarily be hiring. We don’t all have the luxury to pick and choose which jobs we take up, if any.”
“What…what’s the difference?” Harry asked, in a very small voice. Oh, he had a good idea, but hearing Draco talk like this, not circumspect at all,
He’d always wanted to tear Potter down—to make everyone see he wasn’t some teenage god. He was just a spoilt wanker who was too full of himself by half, a waste of celebrity. But then the Dark Lord had risen and proven there were very real things out there to be frightened of, and having to share the spotlight was

Besides—” He shrugged. “You didn’t manage to off me the last time we faced off within these hallowed halls; I thought perhaps you might like another go.” Potter’s expression went a bit queasy, and then he coloured and opened his mouth, but Draco gave a bark of derisive dismissal. “Oh,

“Insufferable?” Draco snickered, shimmying the jeans down Harry’s legs. “I’ve certainly called them worse. Lift up.”
The worst of it was, he knew he deserved being outed in this fashion. He
They poked their heads into Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes to find Fred alone at the till, busy with a customer. He stepped away just long enough to let them know that George, Ron, and Hermione had gone on ahead to the Three Broomsticks, and if they hurried, they’d probably catch them arguing over the menu. Fred had declined to join them this time, as they were shorthanded on the weekends and needed at least one of them holding down the shop during business hours, but professed the next round would be on Harry.
Harry tuned out their bickering, running his eyes over McGonagall’s slanted script. He supposed he ought to do it, this being a special occasion and all that, but he hoped this wasn’t heralding subsequent speaking engagements that would dog him through the years. It was useless to diminish what he’d done, even though he’d hardly come by his role in defeating Voldemort through

of these efforts to Potter. No, Potter would only get excited and want to have a hand in Draco’s redemption—because he was just that way—and like an untrained Crup, he’d piss all over everything and muck it up.
Charlie only waved him off. “Not necessary. I didn’t really do much, after all—and I’m sorry about that. But you rallied—you’re looking healthy enough now, yeah?”
Potter’s head bobbed a bit in consideration. “You also brought me dead mice, though. I looked it up, you know. Evidently that’s how owls woo mates.” He shrugged in what he probably thought a charming affectation. “I thought maybe my pet owl had a crush on me.”
Magical owls were, evidently, more capable creatures than Draco had given them credit for thus far, for the next day at breakfast, when the owls came through the Great Hall with the students’ morning post, a pair of Grey Owls flying in sync came swooping in, clutching between them a long, slender cylindrical package.

Draco gave a low, raspy hiss when he drew within earshot, and Potter’s head snapped up, one hand raised to shield his eyes against the wan noonday sun. When he saw who’d just squawked at him, a smile broke over his features—oh what a different expression he’d be wearing once Draco rained faecal-fire down upon him—and he gave a stupid little wave, as if expecting Draco to wave back.
return home—no more of this spending the better portion of the day sitting in the belfry, avoiding the dark, disturbing parts of his ancestral home. He would use his mother to buffer the unease of the house and perhaps do some research in the library on ways to purify the foundation. He needed a thesis topic, after all, so maybe this could be two birds with one stone (disturbing as the turn of phrase was now).

knew what a filthy tongue their boy saviour had on him.
, I can’t tell you how much…” She sighed, and Harry patted her arms. He’d known this was coming, but it didn’t make it any less uncomfortable.
It was an odd experience, trying to keep up with the Scops. The creature was nearly a quarter Draco’s size but seemed to fly ever so much faster than its tiny wings were capable, and as Draco kept pace with it, never trying to overtake it and instead keeping a lazy distance, time…seemed to have an odd flow to it. The clouds made everything around him feel hazy and distorted, and he couldn’t tell if they were very high or very low. He worried what might happen if he tired—he would surely lose the Scops and then be truly fucked—but he never did, and though it felt like he’d been flying for hours, it also felt like he’d only been flying for but a few minutes. Which was true, and which was an overactive imagination? Or was the truth neither of those things?
—” He clenched both fists tight at his sides, knuckles gone white, and reminded himself that decking Harry Potter would feel good for about five seconds only, and then he’d be explaining himself to his Ministry-appointed probation officiate. “You think I just sailed through last year? Think I wasn’t just as horrified as any of you about what might happen to me and mine, however things turned out?” He took a step towards Potter, almost impressed when Potter held his ground—but then, this was the wizard who’d faced down the Dark Lord. He wasn’t so much brave as just

“You’re welcome,” Draco said simply. “Though I’m not sure what for. You may need to remind me of my generosity.” He rolled his hips. “Or is this a preemptive display of gratitude?”

was going to sneak up on them, not with the grounds freshly warded against uninvited Apparition as they were. It was the only place on the property he could actually sleep—light though his naps were—and he did so daily, for hours on end, popping down only for meals and aborted attempts at sleeping in his own bed. And absolutely positively not wondering what Harry Potter was doing with his holiday.
Mrs. Weasley slipped three crisp envelopes through the connection, reminding them all she would expect them for Sunday dinner, and then closed the connection—just as Ron clomped back down the stairs, a bulging sack of clothes slung over one shoulder.
know any others?”
As Draco had feared, Harry found himself waylaid at most every turn by well-wishers and those who wanted to thank him for his service, or even just to say they’d shaken Harry Potter’s hand. Even Ron and Hermione, once they arrived in smart dress, could not ward off all comers. Several times Harry wound up hemmed in so tightly he lost sight of his companions and had to wriggle his way back out, to Draco’s clear displeasure. His apologies were sheepish, and he tried to touch in some way, whenever he could—a hand on the small of Draco’s back, their arms brushing, shoulders bumping. He doubted it was enough to quell any discomfort entirely, but it was all they could feasibly manage right now without ducking into one of the empty classrooms (which was

“Oh. It’s…it’s, um…” Potter fumbled, and Draco could see in the panic behind his eyes that he was itching

Harry frowned, bemused, as they stepped back onto the lift. “What else was I going to do? You heard him—the alternative was you never being able to transform again.” Even now, Draco flinched at the prospect. Under any other circumstance, Harry might have laughed, given how terrified Draco had been of shifting in the first place. Now, though, he had clearly come to enjoy the power and freedom his Animagus form gave him, even as it took away a bit of his humanity in the process. Asking him to give it up, when he’d finally found acceptance, was bordering on cruel.
“What the—oi, there’s an owl on the pitch!” someone yelled.

“Nooo no no, let’s not start that now, Teddy…” Potter sharply shrugged one shoulder. “Oi, getoffame. Go on, change back—it’s just us here now.”
“Hogwarts,” Harry corrected. “I told you, remember? That we might drop by to pitch in with the reconstruction efforts?”
He took hold of Draco’s hips and gave a punching upward thrust—then swiftly drew out again and repeated the motion. He could feel the muscles in his stomach crying out—this was going to hurt like a

. Nothing of note had really changed, he supposed, except this was finally something they were doing now: sleeping together. Not just sharing a bed, but sharing their bodies in it, in every way he could think possible—and he knew Draco would tease him for the goofy smile he was wearing, just remembering what they’d done, so he took care to wipe it off before he returned to the bedroom.
He circled the grounds in a long, gauging loop, and after a moment’s consideration, he bypassed his bedroom balcony altogether and made for the bell tower where he’d spent much of his holiday thus far roosting, safely stowing away his satchel of contraband to dig through later at his leisure. He really ought to check in with Blaise before returning, he decided, just in case his mother had asked after him. Blaise would have covered for him, of this he was certain, but he wanted to be prepared in case she’d left any messages for him.
He sighed, wiping his mouth with his napkin. “Well, Mother took my temperature, certain I was running a fever and delusional. Father did not, I’m sorry to have to tell you, have a heart attack—” Ron snapped his fingers in a gesture of disappointment. “But he did give me a lengthy lecture about how I ought to be learning to manage whatever’s going to be left of the family finances after the Ministry get through taking every last Galleon they can as fines for wartime actions.”

“Thank you, but it’s nothing I can’t handle,” Draco said, quickly, because while he appreciated his friends throwing fits for him, he didn’t appreciate them doing so in the middle of the Great Hall. They could be nearly as bad as Potter sometimes.

Come on, surely that’s got to hold
“Well, if I’d known you were coming, maybe I could’ve
“I’ll come…” Draco warned.
. Draco Malfoy was a footnote in Harry Potter’s biography, a ‘former classmate’. That was all.
Now, though, he saw it for what it was: simple pride. Draco, even now, did not want Harry to see him weak. He would rather suffer in solitude than expose himself to Harry’s pity, still that frightened little eleven-year-old stinging from Harry’s scorn underneath those sharp grey eyes and flashing scales.
“Hey, if everyone’s expectations of you are already at the ground floor, what have you really got to lose?” And that didn’t exactly address the issue, but damn if Potter didn’t make it sound so
“Yeah, yeah, I’ll be right in, just—” He gestured up to Draco. “I wanna make sure he’s not hurt. I think Crookshanks only spooked him, but I don’t want him developing a complex or something and winding up shredding my post.”
He pushed himself to his feet and casually swept back his hair. He could feel his mother’s gaze boring holes into his back, and before he turned to face her, he took a moment to collect himself, twisting the crudely fashioned silver ring on his finger in nervous habit. Fucking Potter. Fucking Gryffindors.
Still, return he did eventually—and this time, he came armed with a wide-brimmed hat, hide gloves, and a healthy amount of wariness.
“…Yeah, okay, that’s unfortunate, but…” He shrugged. “I mean, at least you’re not

“Hm? Oh, no more than usual.” Harry shrugged. “I can’t say as I’ve noticed at all.”

Draco raked him with a scathing look. “
“Yeah… I guess so.” Weasley wrinkled his nose. “Not quite ‘Hedwig’, though, is it?”
But it wasn’t something that could be pushed—and judging from the book in her lap, she had her own way of coping. So Draco would continue coping as befit him too. “…I’m going to spend a few days at the Zabinis’. Blaise has invited me over—only for a short visit. I’ll be back before Christmas Eve, so you needn’t worry.”
“Please; for someone who’s taken his sweet time getting one over me, you’re certainly impatient when push comes to shove.”

The hand splayed across Potter’s chest began to inch its way down to his stomach, and Potter snapped his hand up to grip his wrist, holding him fast—as if to say
“What happened to him?” Harry asked.
When Potter wasn’t quick enough on the draw, Draco began to climb up his arm to Potter’s

“Mm…” Draco said, chewing thoughtfully. Around a swallow, he said, “Abraxus should do nicely. Was my grandfather’s name.”
“Right, right, of course.” Potter sighed. “Greenhouses, then, yeah?” He made a face. “You know it won’t smell
is why we’re here in the first place.” Draco could feel Potter’s eyes on him, picking him apart, and kept his own gaze resolutely on the Barn Owl slumbering peacefully. Some birds had all the luck. “Why Animagecraft? Seems like an awful lot of work for a bit of privacy. You could’ve invested in a nice Demiguise fur cloak or bought a Headless Hat from the Wheezes shop or done about, I dunno, a
“Just so we’re clear,” he said, because he imagined he could already hear the whispers building around them and needed a distraction, “This still doesn’t mean I’m your owl.”
Perhaps she might have been more eager to mould his young mind had he been forthright in explaining his reasons for pursuing Animagecraft in the first place—but it was best for the both of them that she assumed he meant to use such magics to mischievous ends…rather than to simply escape this ridiculous, stupid war. Really, how was the Dark Lord going to find him if he turned into a field mouse and scampered into a crack in the castle walls? Or a sea snake and went to live with the Merfolk in the Black Lake? It was hardly the noblest of ways to ride out the war—but no one would ever accuse him of being a Gryffindor.

A heads-up would have been appreciated so I could’ve come up with a convincing story, but…I mean, it’s not like you’ve ruined my holiday.” He flashed a smile that was too bright by half for Draco at the moment. “Especially seeing as you’ll be spending most of your visit not being able to talk.” Draco showed him two fingers. “And you won’t be able to do that either.”
Draco’s eyes narrowed. “…She wouldn’t have been Andromeda
his heart beating in his chest, which he supposed was good. Draco, that was who he was. Draco Malfoy, Draco Lucius Malfoy. He closed his eyes, trying to centre himself, and slowly—worrisomely so—he shifted back in drips and drabs, until at length he was finally fully (he hoped) human again.
For another, it was the perfect opportunity to snoop on Potter’s post. The dunderheaded fool never bothered to seal his letters or enchant them in any way, after all, so it was no trouble to skim the contents of anything Potter came begging to have delivered.
Draco sat down, hard, his thighs giving out, and Harry groaned painfully. “You’re heavy…”
Harry flushed. “I just mean, which one will…and which one will…”
, and he climbed up onto the four-poster alongside Harry, graceful and lithe. “I didn’t want to be too compromised.”
“Then tell me what you’re doing here.”
So he said, careful but insistent, as a parent to a child who might erupt into a tantrum at the slightest provocation, “…No, I don’t. You’re using me, and I’m using you. We’re convenient at the moment, and once term ends, I don’t expect our paths will cross again soon. So do away with silly thoughts of reforming me or making me one of your merry band of misfits.”
He could feel his balls drawing up tight under his body, like a line drawn taut at the base of his spine. It was too much—too tight, too hot, too slick, and Draco was everywhere, all around him, over him and burning in his blood.
Harry grinned, drawing his wand—his Elder Wand—and waving it for show. “Nah, I reckon I could take you if you stepped out of line.”
Harry supposed he’d been called worse, and though—as with Hermione—he didn’t really understand what had prompted the display, he let it stand. It was, after all, Draco’s birthday.
Potter made a face. “…I didn’t before, but I kind of do now.” Draco scoffed, reaching for the magazine again, and Potter’s hand snapped out, grabbing him by the wrist to stay him. “…What’s it take to get a straight answer out of you?”
A breeze found its way inside, crisp and beckoning, and Draco wiggled his tail as a surge of adrenaline pumped through his system—he didn’t think he’d
is this?” Draco snatched the form from his hands, mouthing the words to himself as he read.
“No, it’s just—strange, that’s all.” He raked Harry with a heated look. “Distract me?”
McGonagall didn’t seem offended she had to repeat herself, only smiling in that purse-lipped manner that said she thought he was being a bit silly. “I hope that you, as well as Mr. Malfoy, Miss Granger, and Mr. Weasley, will consider returning to Hogwarts to complete a final year of studies. I understand you’re all of-age, so this is by no means a requirement, but Hogwarts will be welcoming back any students whose Seventh-year studies were disrupted by the dire events of this past year. I have yet to sort out the details, but I and the rest of the staff have agreed that any who feel their time here is not yet finished should be invited back with open arms. And yes, Miss Granger—” McGonagall flicked her eyes to Hermione, who looked to be five seconds away from raising her hand to ask a question. “We

As Potter had already announced his intention to visit earlier, their next stop was Eeylops Owl Emporium, where Potter loaded down a burlap sack with every flavour of treat in the shop, including the seasonal specials, and even grabbed a tin of expensive imported treats that included flavours like

Draco glanced down between them to sight the way, then took Harry’s shaft in hand and carefully angled it. Slowly—so slowly Harry wondered if he wasn’t reconsidering—he relaxed his thighs and let himself settle down on top of it.
He needed to do something, he decided. Something to shake off this mood, whatever it was, and put him in brighter spirits. And there had really only ever been one way to do that: ruin Harry Potter’s good time.
“…All right.” Potter seemed to be having a devil of a time wrapping his mind around what was, as far as Draco could tell, a rather simple concept. Perhaps he too was only astounded by how far Draco had flown in such a short amount of time. Perhaps he was thinking
“See? The
And Harry wanted him back. He closed his legs, just enough to brush against Draco’s shoulders. “Ease up—I’m close.”
“No, no, I expect not. He’s always gotten along with other owls. Just has a tetchy relationship with humans. Maybe give him some breathing room when he’s around.”
He wasn’t listening to her, though—couldn’t hear her, not over the sound of his blood rushing in his ears as his heart pumped feverishly. He shoved his plate away, scrambling off the bench and nearly tripping over his own two feet as he quick-walked—oh, he wanted to breakneck
Harry choked on his crème brûlée, and that was the end of lunch. Draco promptly excused the both of them, thanking his mother for the lovely meal, as if she’d lifted a finger to prepare it herself, and slipped his arm through Harry’s, ready to Disapparate right from the dining room. It was only just as he was twisting on his heel that he called out, “By the by, I’ll be boarding at Harry’s place for the foreseeable future. I’ll have the rest of my things Summoned in the morning. Don’t bother trying to Owl me—the place is under a Fidelius, drat it all. I’ll be back for luncheon again next week, ta!”
Blaise frowned. “Department of Bloody Hell? There’s a new one.”
Draco took a bracing breath, gritting out, “Spells I have never

And Hermione’s going to intern at the Ministry, which I think will surprise pretty much no one.”

“I could say the same for those robes!” He shoved Harry away with an irritated huff and began stripping off his own robes, starting with the fussy lacing at the cuffs and collar and working his way to the mother-of-pearl buttons holding it closed at the sides. He caught Harry watching him, with undisguised want, and snapped, “Don’t even

“When they want to,” Draco said, distractedly sipping his coffee as he watched Potter from the corner of his eye.

A pity they wouldn’t get to implement it; Potter

Thomassen gave the file a final once-over, then closed it—and slid it across the desk to Draco. “Have a look.”
But instead, she only looked…quietly relieved, bringing her hands down to clasp before her. “Oh, that…that’s lovely, Dearest.”

He took a breath to clear his mind, as he sometimes had to do when too agitated to make the transformation without a hiccough, and then released it in a long, slow exhale. Smooth as silk, he flowed into the dragon, his robes ballooning into the great barrel of the beast’s belly and limbs stretching out long and lean before bulking, tipped with claws that could have gutted Bragge with a single swipe. His wings nearly filled the room, and his tail lashed nervously as he shook his trunk-sized head, glaring at Harry and Bragge from behind eyes of mustard yellow.
Draco’s head snapped up, brows knit so tight his forehead looked like someone had scribbled all over it with a PermaQuill. “What the fuck is

…so I’m content to self-study. But I could always use a study buddy!”
Draco stopped in his tracks, stomach twisting in panic. “
Potter patted his hair with a frown, opening his mouth to shoot something back, then seeming to think better of it. With a sigh, he relaxed back against the sofa, eyes closed and breathing slow and even. Perhaps he meant to take a nap of his own while his godson was out.
Narcissa, by contrast, had avoided serving any time altogether with Harry’s testimony that she had saved his life in the Forest, at great peril to her own. It was his speaking for her at her hearing that had prompted Narcissa to warm to Harry considerably—which mostly amounted to a polite nod when their eyes met and genial small talk when called to do so. “Oh she’s all but stitched you onto the family quilt now,” Draco assured him this meant, and Harry had to take him at his word. Lucius did not seem to feel any more fondly toward Harry now than he had when they’d first met, but Harry was pretty all right with that, satisfied that he simply kept his mouth shut when they had to interact.
When he failed to elaborate, Harry pressed him. “…So? Have you thought about it at all?”
It was just, things were so much

had plans—terrible ones, but plans. Sure, he’d probably get himself killed within the first week on the job, but at least he’d go out doing what he did best: playing the hero.
Draco’s shoulders seized as he released a rough, dry huff of laughter. “Bit late for that.”
They were so exhausted by day’s end, they collapsed into bed back at Grimmauld Place and actually went to sleep—though Harry roused in the wee hours of the morning to hold up his end of their bargain, which seemed to suit Draco just fine.
“I wouldn’t say that. My father’s not so fond of you.”
a bit…odd, though. Unsettling in a way he hadn’t felt since those early days of annoying Potter. Perhaps, he thought, because he was spending so much of their time together now as himself, a human, and not an owl. Here he was once again, getting entirely too familiar with Potter, and now without the comfortable barrier of his Animagus form to shield him from Potter’s idle chatter, his
But if she doubted his plans, she didn’t show it on her features, and her only response to his declaration was, “That sounds lovely, Darling. Give Lady Zabini my regards, won’t you? The elves ought to have a batch of scones fresh-baked for tea—take a few with you to share.”
Fine time for Potter to start worrying about necks being broken. Draco mulled over the invitation before admitting privately that he hadn’t had fun getting here and he wasn’t looking forward to flying back. The moving staircases had nearly clipped him, and that was a
“I do respect you,” Harry said. “But you won’t catch me showing it.” He sidled in close, so their sides were pressed together. “Just open it. Oh, but—” Draco raised a brow in question. “It’s not all of your gift. Hermione’s taken care of the rest. Only because, well, I didn’t know how to do the magic myself, and there was something of a time crunch issue.”
Harry only batted his hand away with a playful snort. “I’m perfectly sane. And
“What?” Draco laughed. “I think not. I came to fuck with you; I’ve done about as much fucking with you as is possible, circumstances permitting, and I intend to be on my way now.” It hadn’t been part of the original plan, but Blaise would put him up without much fuss. “You can’t possibly expect me to stick around and pretend to be your

Draco perked up: Teddy? Was he finally going to get to meet the mysterious definitely-not-Potter’s-bastard-child Tedward?
Not that there’d ever been any doubt in Draco’s mind, but Potter was

Harry felt like he’d unwittingly wandered into the Slytherin Common Room, and Draco’s friends made sure he didn’t forget it. They fell back on inside jokes or discussed their own post-war situations with Draco, not bothering to loop Harry in. He’d thought the backhanded compliments on his cooking had been bad enough, but trust Draco’s companions to manage to sink even lower than Harry had imagined possible. Granted, it was admittedly nice to see Draco so garrulous and comfortable—even at the best of moments with Harry and Ron and Hermione, he had always mostly kept to himself, rarely starting or continuing a conversation on his own. It wasn’t that Draco
All eyes in the Hall swivelled to see who was the lucky recipient of what was, quite obviously, a brand new regulation Quidditch broomstick—and then they slowly tracked back to their respective morning meals when it became clear it was just Harry Potter, yet again, flaunting his fabulous wealth (really, if you were going to show off how absolutely loaded you were, you had to be

“What?” Draco asked, a bit testily.
“Please be a ferret, please be a ferret…” Ron muttered under his breath, fingers crossed.
“What? It seems terribly convenient, if you ask me!” He smiled to himself. “I’m actually looking forward to it.” He cocked his head at Draco, studying him fondly. “…What about you?”
Riveting stuff, really. “And you want to get him a
“Definitely not,” Harry chided gently, trying to shift his body away—though he only succeeded in drawing one of Draco’s legs between his own, causing his cock to rub just so over Draco’s thigh. He swallowed. “Unless you want to get arrested for public indecency.”
Some days, Harry really didn’t understand Draco.

“Keep being an insufferable irritation and perhaps you’ll find out,” Draco said, before realising it perhaps wasn’t quite the threat he’d meant it to be. He took a beat, steadied himself, then fixed Potter with a long, meaningful look. “…You really didn’t tell them to recruit me?”
Legs trembling beneath his robes, he shambled back down the quiet, unassuming hallways of Juvenile Penal Affairs back to the Level 2 reception desk, where he spoke to an older witch who looked very much like she’d been an Auror once herself, so steely was her gaze and sharp her tongue as she demanded his paperwork. After firing off a quick note for confirmation, she reluctantly ushered Draco down a different but still-winding corridor that, after several hairpin turns, opened into the Auror Bullpen.

“Thought we—were
Silence hung over the four of them like a vulture, watching their feeble attempts at conversation sputter and expire. Only Draco seemed entirely unaffected by the tension, spooning his porridge into his mouth and staring off into space, like any other morning. Harry thought it must be nice sometimes, being such an unfeeling prat.
“God, am I.” He was painfully hard now, and he really didn’t give two shits if Draco teased him for it. He’d wipe that smarmy expression off his face in short order, regardless.

He smashed his fist against the button for the Atrium when the lift finally came, face so hot he was surprised there wasn’t steam shooting out his ears. Harry-fucking-Potter had his life more together than Draco.

either wanted a reaction out of him or to encourage others to take their revenge on him, vigilante style. He wasn’t going to give them the satisfaction of either being so easily accomplished. “Things have largely calmed down on campus. The Headmistress has made it clear she won’t tolerate any…well, extrajudicial
“One false move, and I’ll rip it off,” Draco warned, as if he could read Harry’s mind. He was still grimacing, and his lids fluttered open—his eyes were bright, like he was fighting back tears. “Shit, that was a bad idea.”
Potter glared at him, and even in the shadows, Draco could tell his cheeks were darkening in frustration. Any moment now they’d come to blows and this insipid conversation would be over. “You know I didn’t mean it like that. I only meant it’s not as bad as you make it out to be.”
“Not indefinitely,” Potter said in that tone parents took with unruly children, and Draco wished he could still shit on him in this form without breaking several unspoken social protocols. “Just…you know, a little while. For sure we’ll get it sorted before term starts—”
“You’ve been seen in his company,” Thomassen said, expression even, as if he didn’t know the fraught relationship Draco and Potter had had. Which, Draco supposed, he probably
“Because I’m told I’m pretty thick and don’t generally recognise that sort of thing even when it’s right in front of me. So…” He clicked his heels together, with a sort of half-bounce on his toes. “You might have to be more…direct.”
So he woke up early the next morning, scrawled out a memo on a scrap of parchment and tied it off with a length of thread before walking himself to the Owlery, a pep in his step and a whistle on his tongue. No one was up just yet, outside of the ghosts and the odd Ravenclaw already bustling their way toward the library to get in a bit of preprandial study, so he had the Owlery to himself. By the time he’d transformed and taken a few laps around the castle to wake himself up, it was nearing time for breakfast, and he followed the line of other owls through the skylight of the Great Hall.

The conversation sparked a thought inside Harry, though.
It was only when the bottle was empty and he was bereft of any further excuse not to entertain some polite conversation that he wiped a hand over his face, Vanished the bottle with a careless wave of his Ministry-appointed wand, and asked with a strained smile, “So, Mr. Potter. Are you…satisfying all of Draco’s newfound needs?”
fan clubs might consider the merit in having people around willing to watch your back as fiercely as you watch theirs. Just a suggestion.”
Draco let himself be manhandled into the entryway and down the front steps, even put up with Potter grabbing him by the wrist and practically dragging him over the front lawn and into the little skulking entrance at the base of the West Tower. The long march up to the Owlery, Draco held his tongue while Potter panicked at the display they’d just escaped, because he could be patient. Just a different way of storing up shit.
Potter nodded slowly, humouring him. “Right. So, sitting with me while I did my Charms work—”

Control…? Harry frowned at the implication that this was, in any way,
“Right…” Weasley said, keeping an eye on Draco and taking a measured step back, as if fearing he might be the next target. A wise move. “So, er—were you coming back inside, or…?” He jerked a thumb back towards the ramshackle home. “Mum’s wanting our input on what to make for Christmas lunch.”
When the doorknob jiggled again and Potter poked his stupid face back through, it was well after nightfall, and he was
“It’s nice is all. Having someone just listen. Not try and fix things, not tell you you’re being stupid, not lie to you and tell you everything’s going to be fine. Just someone to sit there. Eating owl treats while I do my homework.”
After batting his lips with a handkerchief, he cleared his throat and gave Draco a funny look. “Usually one works up to those sorts of questions in conversation. Surely a passing comment on the weather or discussion of Christmas plans should come before diving headlong into ‘what’s the next ten years looking like for you?’ no?”
he hissed aloud for good measure, but Potter probably couldn’t understand that either, the thick-headed knob.
: Angelina Johnson, who was apparently dating George. They were openly affectionate at the table, handsy and flirting, and even Hermione and Ron were acting a bit like an old married couple, with only eyes for themselves once it became clear Draco did not want to discuss how their visit to the Ministry had gone.
All of this left him feeling rather out of sorts now, and even the thrum of superiority that flushed through him after sharply clicking his beak in irritation at Potter’s repeated misspelling of

“Want to switch places?”

Draco rolled his shoulders, shaking him off. “It wasn’t like

Draco had known it wouldn’t be easy making his way in life after Hogwarts. Inside that castle, he could still pretend at being a student, ignore the looming threat of adulthood and the responsibilities inherent therein. He could earn ten House points in Arithmancy, laugh at Potter’s shitty thesis statement, and reassure Pansy her new dress robes didn’t make her arse look fat, and that was a day well done for him. He could just be
They landed in the sitting room, and Harry was already starting to unbutton his dress robes, tugging at the tie Draco had worked so hard on, before his head had stopped spinning. He wondered if it would send the wrong signal if he popped down to the cellar to retrieve one of the wine bottles—or something stronger. He supposed this late, a glass of warm milk was a better choice if he needed something soothing, but the buzz of alcohol did wonders for making everything go soft and fuzzy, rendering reality a bit less daunting in times when things got overwhelming—like right about now.

aristocrat if you didn’t have a few dark, dirty secrets rattling about inside your soul that you were bound to take to the grave. Between this and his heartsick passion for buggery, Draco was well and truly set.

“No, but I’m considering a muzzle…” He rubbed at his ear ruefully. “Anyway, just trust me. We’ll have privacy at least, so you can stretch your legs a bit, and I swear it’ll be a

Draco didn’t feel the need to elaborate any further, and Blaise didn’t prod. He was a better partner for conversation than Pansy like that. She would have put him on the rack until he cracked and told her every sordid detail, from his infant cousin to the bundle of contraband he’d hauled home to the lovely silver jewellery clapped round his ankle. Blaise was content to just enjoy a fellow aesthete’s company.
Potter’s shoulders slumped, and he sighed, scrubbing a hand through his hair with one hand and adjusting his lopsided glasses with the other. “I didn’t,” he said, even and serious, full of that characteristic Potter sincerity that had charmed so many before. He then held his hands up in defence. “I swear, my meddling starts and stops with giving you very good advice.” Draco gave him a look he hoped said
Harry did as asked. “No! No, honestly, they aren’t, they’re just…”
“Touché,” she tittered, then cocked her head. “What’s brought this offer on? You’ve been a veritable ghost ever since you returned from Hogwarts, and now you want to be underfoot?”
. He supposed a haughty bravado was better than the peevish nerves Draco tended to exhibit when he was discomfited, though, and they set off for the Ministry just before noon. Hermione and Ron had left for Diagon Alley a bit earlier: Ron to pitch in at the twins’ shop as he’d promised to do with the school year starting inside of two months, and Hermione to get in some shopping she’d been putting off while waiting for a shipment of books to arrive at Flourish and Blotts. There were plans for the four of them to meet up for a later lunch once Harry and Draco’s business at the Ministry was sorted, and Harry’s stomach was already grumbling.
He nearly bit his tongue off. “I’m certain that won’t be necessary,” he growled, cheeks gone deep scarlet as he grabbed for the ceramic urn they kept the Floo powder in. His palms were clammy with sweat, and he very nearly spilled the lot of it down the front of his pants.

to ruin your holiday. Now you’ve just put me in an even darker mood.”
Seeming to forget he was a wizard and could, quite easily, Vanish the excrement from his person with a flick of his wand, Potter instead turned to Draco, pointing with not a wand but his bandaged finger and vowing in a grit-toothed growl, “I. Will.
They quickly finished up with the remainder of the paperwork and were lined up to Floo to the Leaky Cauldron by just after 1. Draco looked exhausted by the ordeal, still peaky around the edges, and Harry offered to call off lunch and just return to Grimmauld Place, but Draco was adamant they continue with their plans.
of Apparition, leaving Blaise alone in the courtyard. He took a few moments to collect himself, then with a huff began marching back to the manor proper. Draco swooped down upon him and smoothly transformed to fall into step beside him—taking great care to ensure that his trousers covered the ghastly cuff on his left ankle.
Potter was getting irritated—which meant he was getting emotional, which meant he’d shortly storm out of here, and Draco would have won. “No, I know you aren’t stupid. I know you’re actually reasonably clever, but you can’t read minds, so maybe stop assuming you know what I think of you and let me tell you instead.” When Draco didn’t manage a clever quip in response quickly enough, Potter continued on, all that pent-up emotion driving him like a steam engine. “You’re a pill, a

really sorry about that, but I couldn’t think of how to say no!”
Draco stepped forward, wearing only a tight pair of black boxer-briefs that betrayed just how enthused he was with the present turn of events. “Made a choice?”
“…About what?”
“Oh right right, that does remind me…” Wentsworth began digging through his inbox, reaching for the wire-frame spectacles on top of his head and placing them gently on the bridge of his nose as he peered at the seemingly unending pile of paperwork awaiting his perusal. Was it just Draco’s imagination, or did the man somehow have

“Well—it’s not like
gently this time—and Potter hissed, wincing. “Fuck, cut that out—can’t take a joke…”
In the early morning hours, just as dawn was breaking and with the rest of the Weasley household snugly abed, Draco departed. He’d waited for first light out of habit, only belatedly recalling he had excellent night vision and could have overnighted in the comfort of his own bed instead of on a perch alongside a wheezing Errol and Pig, who seemed to have some form of owl night terrors and woke up squawking at odd hours.
“…If you don’t want to be here, you don’t have to be.” Potter met his eyes, sharp and green and certain. “And you know that. Which means you want to be here, so maybe let’s stop playing stupid, since we know neither one of us
A card lay underneath the wand, scrawled in blotchy ink with,
Draco opened his wings, tail wiggling as he prepared to launch himself and snatch those delicious little nuggets right from Potter’s hand—when Potter yelped, “Wait—

went up as the game began. Potter kicked off, and Draco drifted into position. Once Potter saw him, there was every chance he would catch on to what Draco was trying to do, which would ruin the surprise, so he had precious few moments of leeway to get this done. Below, the Snitch had zipped out from under the awning and was now flying in spiralling loops toward the Hufflepuff stands. Potter was taking a lazy turn around the pitch, eyes peeled, and he seemed to have spotted neither Draco nor the errant Snitch.
When Potter brought an offering on his next visit, placing it atop the knot, Draco didn’t wait for the big Horned Owl resting on the same branch to steal it—he swooped down, still a healthy distance from where Potter was fussing with the excitable little Scops again, and inhaled it. The taste tended to grow on you was all, and you needed to let these stupid birds know who was boss, or they’d never let you have a moment’s peace, the territorial shits.

It really was most everyone in the family: Ron and Hermione, Bill and Fleur, Fred and George; Ginny was home for the weekend, though she’d been spending most of her summer at Hogwarts, helping with the rebuilding; the only ones missing, aside from Charlie, who’d had to return to Romania, were Percy and Mr. Weasley, who were pulling long hours at the Ministry these days but had assured Mrs. Weasley they’d be home in time for dinner.
“What,” Draco snorted. “You think

Draco allowed a weak little smile. “Well, naturally that—but…” He trailed off, grimacing to himself, as if what he was saying physically pained him—and Harry felt some of the tension return. “I felt…unequal to it.”

As the hour approached noon, Draco swooped down from his post atop Gringotts to perch on the sign hanging just over the door outside of Eeylops. A few passersby gave him funny looks, but they quickly moved on about their business, clearly thinking him part of the shop’s merchandise. Potter was, at the moment, just exiting the newly reopened Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlour (
Potter blinked stupidly, mouth half-agape, and when Draco stopped speaking, the silence seemed to snap him back to his senses. He startled, shaking his head. “I…oh. That’s…” He scrubbed at the back of his head—his hair was getting longer and more unruly. It hadn’t been
“Look at it this way: it’ll be less of a hassle for you to just mould me into the kind of Chosen One you’d prefer to associate with than to go out and find another one altogether.”
“But I never wanted you in Azkaban, or shunned from the public eye for life or anything like that. Because I know what you did in the war. And I know what you didn’t do as well. That’s something not a lot of people outside your immediate family can say, I reckon.” He took a step toward Draco but kept well out of leg-sweeping range. Potter was a quick study, whether he was faced with an owl with pinpoint shitting accuracy or a humiliated pure-blood who’d been spending his free time reading too many books about how monastic wizards in Tibet channelled their magic for use in hand-to-hand combat. “You deserve better than this—better than probation and a bunch of doors slamming in your face. It’d be a monumental waste, you just fucking off after graduation, never to be seen or heard from again. And maybe it’ll make me sound full of myself, but given what we’ve been through, I reckon you ought to value my opinion over a bunch of randos on the street.”
He flashed his Dark Mark, faded now but still stark against his pale skin, even with the white scar running down its centre. “Think people are just going to be lining up to hire someone with one of
“Speak for yourself,” Ron muttered from behind the paper.

But there were other ways to ‘not talk’ than to wing off into the night.
He waddled, still stuffed from overeating, several steps along the window sill until he bumped up against the still-open window. Leaning, he shut it—there, no chance of any clumsy Gryffindors unwittingly tumbling to their overdue deaths—and then shivered to fluff up his feathers, making himself comfortable at Potter’s side.
Wings half-flared for balance, he carefully shuffled further along his perch with a halting gait, glaring at Potter all the while with a slit-eyed disdain that he hoped said

First, though, he needed to speak with McGonagall.

Whatever the magic at work was, the Scops eventually broke through the heavy clouds around them, and a tall, rickety building came into view. It seemed…off, oddly constructed, and Draco had to wonder how it didn’t fall over with a stiff breeze. There was a small vegetable garden just in the front, while out back was a field Draco assumed, from the home-made goal posts, was used for casual Quidditch games.
students, he reminded himself), and the moment Draco had been dreading had finally arrived.
With as close to a huffing sigh as he could manage, Draco shifted his weight to balance on one leg and held the other out, waiting.
Mrs. Weasley ignored him, beaming at Draco. “Well, not to worry, we’ll get you sorted quickly enough.” She belatedly noticed Harry, who had stood quietly off to the side so Draco could get the mothering over and done with. It seemed to be his turn now, though, for she folded him into a hug half as frantic but twice as tight as Draco’s, clutching him to her breast and pressing a kiss onto his crown. “Oh Harry,
Draco liked to think he’d kept his word—he’d kept his head down the entire year, and every moment outside of the farcical demonstrations that had passed for lectures under the Dark Lord’s educational regime had been spent holed up in the deepest, darkest corners of the library, surrounded by towering tomes that shielded him from prying eyes as he poured himself into his Animagecraft studies under McGonagall’s reluctant tutelage.

“Gonna open it?” Blaise asked around a bite of croissant. “Reckon it’s cursed? Want me to check it?” He raised his wand in offer, but Draco waved him away. “Your funeral.” Blaise shrugged. “Maybe literally.”
“I wasn’t putting it off—” Harry started to protest.
Mutely, he passed over his wand hilt-first, and she accepted it with a frown—then a small gasp of recognition. “Oh! Oh, it’s your wand! But you said you’d lost it during the occupation! Wherever did it get off to?”

, and his father had been utterly distraught.
, Draco couldn’t help but be drawn to his own destruction, placing his heart in Harry’s hands when there was every danger of him crushing it.
Potter was still standing there while Draco quietly had his mental crisis, blinking slowly like he’d just been kicked in the head by a Hippogriff. After a moment, he released a long, laboured breath, then in a choked voice, “…Were you? Flirting with me?”

“What?” Draco didn’t follow. This whole conversation was a maze, really.
He did reluctantly find himself correcting the odd form, though, when Potter practised spellwork, and if Potter’s essays got too rambly, he demonstrated his disappointment with the lack of any evident work ethic by slashing the parchment to ribbons so that Potter had to start over. Several times he was threatened, again, with being barbecued, and Potter even once tossed him back out the window in a pique—but he was generally back in good humour by the next evening, which Draco supposed was a sign he’d finally matured.

She began ticking off points on her fingers. “No prospects, no plans, not even so much as a lofty dream!” She crossed her arms and quirked her brows as if to say
of Apparition, as Mr. Weasley and Percy finally arrived, and then there were more greetings and welcomes all around. Mr. Weasley gave Draco’s hand a firm shake, saying, “Didn’t think I’d ever be glad to see a Malfoy darkening my doorway, but there’s a first time for everything. Welcome to the Burrow, Draco,” and though Draco had nothing to say in return, only ducking a guilty nod, Harry thought he seemed a little relieved to have the matter of their families’ antagonistic past addressed right from the start and promptly sailed over.
In the wake of graciously helping Potter not break his neck dicking about with his friends—not that Potter deserved the thoughtfulness; it was only, Draco’s mother had risked her life to save the Boy Saviour’s skin, and he didn’t want her good turn to go to waste—Draco realised that convincing Potter he was willing to deliver his letters and parcels for the low, low fee of a handful of delicious owl treats was, in fact, an absolutely

“Yes, I had realised, but thanks for the reminder.” Potter reached up and gently stroked the shoulder of one wing, and Draco felt himself melt a little before he forcibly straightened back up. Mustn’t let his guard down, no no. “New owl. He gets a bit anxious if I leave him alone for too long, so I’m indulging him during the holidays. He’s well-trained, though, don’t worry. I won’t let him near Teddy.”
“Electronics,” Hermione gently corrected. “And I’m sure they’d work just fine with the proper shielding.” She tapped her chin. “You know, that’s a thought. Mobile phones are starting to gain traction in Muggle society—my parents were talking about getting one so that they can better keep in contact with me.” She flushed. “I think they’re still sore about having their memories Modified… But the point is, Patronuses and Owls are useful for communicating over long distances, but that Charm’s complex magic, and Owl Post still takes a while. Mobile phones might be useful for witches and wizards who can’t cast a Patronus, or who lack access to the Floo Network, like those living in areas largely populated by Muggles.”
“What the—
He continued to follow the Scops as it took a long loop around the house, until it spotted an open window around the back and tucked its wings into a dive. Draco banked his lift, drifting down at a safe distance, and where the Scops zipped through the window, Draco instead chose a branch from one of the trees surrounding the property on which to alight.

No, so pipe down and let’s find out what the caterpillar’s going to eat on Thursday.”—and another round of nappy changing (that Draco was content to let Potter handle all on his own), Tedward was finally put down for a nap, and Potter came plodding back into the sitting room, flopping onto the sofa next to Draco with a great sigh of relief.
, don’t you? Slytherins for one—and either sold you out to the Dark Lord or else made a whole-hearted attempt to do so for another?” He touched Harry’s temple with a thoughtful frown. “I haven’t wanked you silly, have I? I know you had no smarts to spare to begin with, so I’ll never forgive myself if—”
“Oh that’s an easy enough fix,” Eeylops said, raising his wand. “I can simply switch out the owner’s name. What would you like it to read instead?”

He gave Potter a long, assessing look. “…So you want a partner.”
Potter made some noises under his breath that were probably rude words, then crossed his arms over his chest, shrugging. “So? Is that all? If you just wanted to deck me quickly, I could’ve made myself available to you between classes.”
“But—I thought that was…after your birthday—fuck.” Draco blanched. “I haven’t forgotten it, have I? Not that I
Draco shrugged. “I suppose there’s more real estate to spread around when you don’t have to accommodate an entire extra year’s worth of students. Were
Mr. Weasley drew him aside just as they were preparing to leave, asking for a private word. “I’m not sure if you’ve seen the papers, but the Ministry’s finally getting up and running again.”
“Remember I’ve got an invisibility cloak, Malfoy! I sneaked into Slytherin’s Common Room once, and I’ll do it again if I have to!”
She held her hand out to him, and he took it and laid a kiss on her knuckles. Her skin was chill from sitting here, surrounded by tall walls of thin glass under a greying sky. “Shall I have one of the elves bring in a brazier?”
“I wasn’t anywhere
Once Weasley’s mother had finished fawning over Draco, Potter brought him into the roost room, where two other owls were presently either slumbering (“That’s Errol. He’s older than the pyramids, Ron reckons.”) or devouring a bowl of owl kibble (“…And you’ve met Pig.”). He gently placed Draco on one of the empty perches, far from the excitable Pig.

They put off christening the Snitch for later, as Hermione and Ron would be rumbling about now, and they had a terribly, horribly awkward lunch with the Malfoys to prepare for. Ron had, likely at Hermione’s insistence, procured a present for Draco as well, which was reluctantly passed over with a muttered
“That’s not what I asked.” But he moved on with a sigh. “Slytherin House?”
And then there’d be dozens even
“Is she complaining about wanting to fuck me with her nonexistent cock yet? That’s usually the sign she’s done for the evening.” Draco Levitated Pansy off of Harry despite her squirming protests and shooed her towards the stairs. “She’s been working on a topically applied Polyjuice ointment since Third Year, you know. One of these days she’ll manage it, and then none of our arses will be safe.”
,” said the woman. “
“And I’m not one,” Ron said, rising to his feet to return his own dirty dishes to the sink. He clapped Harry on the shoulder as he passed by. “Good luck finding a new Keeper.”
He took first wash-up, scrubbing his face and—after a moment’s consideration—dabbing a drop of cologne under each ear before returning to the bedroom and sending Draco off for his evening toilette. When Draco returned, padding into their room in a fine set of silk pyjamas he’d received as a housewarming gift from his mother, it was to find a small, nondescript brown bag sitting on his side of the bed.
Wentsworth smoothly navigated the conversation back to discussion of Draco’s schoolwork and how his mother was doing, idle chit-chat, but Draco’s thoughts had already strayed down the winding, snaking halls that made up the bowels of Level 2, wondering what an

“…Yes, sir.”
wouldn’t the dragon be pleased?
How that was Draco’s problem, he didn’t rightly know. Potter extended his wand again, and Draco snapped at it, wings extended in a threat display—and that seemed to spook Potter a bit. He held his hands up defensively, standing his ground.

news, but he had to ease her into it gently, and he couldn’t do that with her standing there looking like a stiff breeze might send her to the floor. Good gad, she was going to faint dead away when he broke it to her—perhaps he ought to have her sitting down for this… “It’s…word on an apprenticeship, of sorts.”
, though his good humour still showed in the curl of his lips and the glint in his eyes in the low light. Harry released a huff of exertion. “All right, fine—no more saying the U word, if you’re so insistent.”
Harry wondered if the “Slytherin way” to seduction was romanticised siege warfare, driving Harry to the edge until he was finally forced to give in. If so, Draco had clearly studied at the foot of the masters—and patience had never been one of Harry’s virtues, a fact Draco was mercilessly taking advantage of. He almost imagined he could hear that damned clock in his head again, counting down the sighs, the breaths, the heated moments until Harry broke—but he only dug in his heels all the deeper, determined to do this
desperate.
“…I would’ve expected a box of demons?”
An awkward beat passed, and Potter scuffed the toe of his dirty trainer against the gob of silver now frozen solid to a cobblestone. “…Have a good holiday, then?” he asked, clearly bereft of any passing understanding of remotely acceptable conversation topics, given what they’d just been through.

Draco lifted the bag and checked its branding, but Harry had ensured that the item was packed in a plain paper bag and simple velvet box, so as not to give anything away until it had been opened.

“Yeah, yeah they are,” Harry said. “But
Something poked him in the breast feathers, and he gave a start, wings flaring—it hadn’t struck anything sensitive, thanks to the healthy layering of down, but he was less than accustomed to being disturbed in the Owlery of all places.
There was a long pause, and then: “…All right then.”
True to his word, though, like the honourable, noble Gryffindor that he was, Potter showed up on successive visits to the Owlery bearing gifts he offered up in an effort to convince Draco they had a reasonable rapport going now and he really shouldn’t muck it up by raking Potter across the face, even if he
Wentsworth gave a nodding grunt. “Right. She’s a good egg, McGonagall.” He tapped his wand on a rune drawn on the folio’s tab, and a sheet filled with tabular scribbling popped onto the top of the stack. “Let’s look at your marks, now…” He muttered under his breath as he read, lips thinning into an impressed half-smile. “Sure you aren’t a Ravenclaw, son?”
With this house feeling nothing like a home anymore, Draco took to spending more time than was perhaps appropriate roosting as an owl in the bell tower. He could see for miles from up there—

“She punched me in the face; I should say we’re even.”
Draco shrugged, and another awkward silence threatened to take root. Charlie nodded, glancing around the room as if to make a quick exit—but then he laughed, a thoughtful little chuckle. “It’s funny.”
Pansy whirled around, grabbing Draco by the shoulder and shoving the newspaper in his face. He moved to bat her away, but she refused to relent, hissing, “Draco,

“I think it’s going to fall off…” Harry murmured into Draco’s hair one evening, sticky with spunk and sweat from his head to his toes.
“Not as thrilled with their lengthy holiday down under as you might have hoped?” Harry asked, offering a sympathetic smile.
Draco eased Harry down flat onto his back again, reclaiming his position straddling his hips. “I know you rather like being in charge—”
at the holidays. Swanning about the halls with Umbridge’s blessing, Inquisitorial Squad badge gleaming on his chest, now seemed like distant, fond memories of a rosier time. One to which he could never return, not without a Time-Turner.
Harry’s brows rose. “You think I look fit?” Draco’s cheeks pinked, and he started walking again, now at a faster clip to try and lose Harry, until he was nearly jogging by the time they joined the larger group.
Thomassen leaned way over his desk, far enough he could peer down at Draco, who hopped back up into the seat he’d just vacated and waited for further instruction. Thomassen only

Draco made a face, grinding an old pellet into dust beneath his loafer. “…No. I had my own owl deliver them.” And before Potter could accuse him of laziness, he continued, “I wasn’t going to work myself into an early grave flying all over the British Isles. Good gad, you were posting shit at least four times a week at one point there!” Never mind that Xerxes had never turned his beak up at a request to deliver Potter’s post. He was an

“You didn’t murder him,” Potter said, sounding so certain Draco was incapable of such violence it made Draco want to punch him, just to remind him he’d smashed Potter’s face in once and could easily do it again.
“No, it wasn’t. But—” Draco shrugged. “That doesn’t mean it wasn’t…acceptable.”

experienced, so I’m still riding that winner’s high.” He palmed his wand from his sleeve, twirling it between his fingers. “But if you’re gonna insist.”
“Unfortunately,” Draco growled, snapping a hand out and grabbing the owl by its feet. It continued to beat its wings senselessly, chirruping delighted greetings despite being trapped in Draco’s fist. “…Excuse me for a moment, Mother,” he said around a tight smile, and he could feel her amused gaze following him all the way back to the manor steps.
Potter’s lips twisted into a frown. “You ruined our morning that day, you know. You don’t

as well and were scandalised he’d used their form to try and hide from his problems.
Harry collapsed back to the bed before he reached the point of no return, twining his fingers with Draco’s and enjoying the melodic little tinkle of their rings clacking together.
Draco told himself this was only a new and exciting way to harass Potter in a form he could never be prosecuted in. What was Potter going to say, after all? “A great bloody owl shat on my parchment and nipped off my nose”? Not likely. Meddling with the mail was entertaining enough, but pestering Potter in person—in bird?—was always going to have its own allure.

was that?”
“Bullshit.”
And she was, to be fair. On top of preparing Draco’s new Sanctuary, so they wouldn’t have to trek out to Scotland every time Draco wanted to stretch his wings, Harry had also been intent on finally polishing the egg custard as he’d promised at the new year. He hadn’t yet managed it alone, but Hermione had thrown herself into helping however she could, with Ron evidently providing moral support.

Thomassen narrowed his eyes a tick, probably because he knew Draco was bullshitting him, but he didn’t call him on it, merely slapped the folder shut and placed it on his desk. Leaning back in his chair, he steepled his fingers and studied Draco closely. “Show me your arm.” Draco’s heart stopped. “Show me your arm,” Thomassen said again, more slowly but with ever so much more demand, and Draco licked his lips and quietly rolled up his sleeve. He didn’t need to be told which arm.
“I’m no one’s
He pursed his lips tightly at the crown, drawing the head in agonisingly slowly and tonguing the slit before lifting off again. He used his hand to spread the viscous lubricant from Harry’s Charm along the shaft—and Harry wondered what it tasted like. They were going about this entirely in the wrong order, but Harry didn’t want to say as such, lest Draco think better of sucking him off.
“Well,” Draco said, in a feeble attempt to collect himself. “There’s time now. To—and you’ve made me loathe this word—
Draco scowled. “If it was so very easy, why didn’t
Going through Potter’s post was illuminating indeed, but Draco got the distinct and most unwelcome feeling he was learning entirely too much information about the boy wonder’s personal life. He didn’t feel
A long beat of silence passed as Draco processed what he’d just said, lump lodged in his throat. He swallowed hard, and said with a soft, wary rasp, “…That’s the second time you’ve said that.” Potter only gave a flippant shrug, and Draco shook his head. “But—you weren’t dead. I saw him bring you out, he said you

Gifts were exchanged, drinks were had, and stories of Malfoy birthdays past were divulged. Harry found he liked the one about his twelfth best, when Lucius had presented Draco with twelve handsome brand-new Nimbus brooms, and the spoilt git had thought they were all for

Draco waved away her concern. “If I was meant to receive one, it would’ve gone to the Manor. I haven’t checked in with my parents in a few days.”
Draco wished he had a pellet too, now, that he might chuck it at Potter’s stupid face. “Oh fuck you. I’m not your newest project now you’ve slain a Dark Lord. If you’ve got the hero itch in you still, there’s probably a couple thousand pathetic war orphans you can go coddle or ‘Harry J.

“I read,” Draco said.

“Well, Fred and George have hired on a couple of new hands, so if we want to grab lunch with the both of them this time, we can probably swing it.”
Draco whirled on him, and that was about all the slow evisceration he could stand. Time to rip some heads off. “What the
He set a slow, easy pace to draw it out—Draco wanted it hard, fast, but he would get neither if Harry popped too soon, so this had to necessarily be tantric. On each pass, though, he pulled out further and slid back in with a rougher, more punishing force. Soon, the quiet of the bedroom was alive with fevered panting and creaking bedsprings and the bright clap of skin against skin. Draco was biting his lip, trying and failing to stifle desperate little grunts, and Harry knew he wasn’t imagining the way he was

Harry fought to keep very still, though he wanted more than anything to snap his hips up, bury himself right up there where he was clearly meant to be. The spongy head of his cock felt like it was being squeezed through a warm, wet channel, and he could hear Draco panting in his ear, trying to hold his breath with effort and failing. He steadied his hands at Draco’s hips, giving gentle guidance when he seemed unable to push himself; Draco didn’t want to appear weak, so he’d never ask for help, or beg Harry to stop. He’d keep going, keep pushing himself, and the kindest thing Harry could do for him was to have enough respect for him not to say something stupid like

Hermione politely asked how he was enjoying the Sanctuary, as if she hadn’t caught them tumbling out flushed and laughing just the day before, and Ron grabbed them a round of Butterbeers so he had an excuse to mingle with Draco but not talk.

“You’re Harry-fucking-Potter; they’ll take what they can get.”
She drew back, still frowning down at him, and said, “…I’m glad you got your wand back,” before hopping off of the bed, whispering back across the rug, and swanning from his room. Like a storm, that one was—a cloudburst, there one minute, harsh and beating and overwhelming, and gone the next. Yes, they definitely would’ve made a fine pair, though Draco didn’t think he would have survived her. It would’ve been fun while it lasted, though.
“Yeah, I saw Kingsley’s been appointed Minister full-time? That’s great!”

Whether because the odd snowfall made flying a rather hazardous business or because they didn’t want to risk errant owls swooping in and stealing their Snitch any more, the Gryffindors’ games of pick-up Quidditch fell off, depriving Draco of one of the few forms of entertainment left to him. Potter had never let him near the Snitch again after his humiliating dogfight versus Draco, but it had at least been fun (after a fashion) just
