"So do we know who used it previously?" Remus asked as he stepped closer to Dumbledore and Lily to see what was in the Headmaster's hand, Dumbledore's hand clenched into a tight fist.
Harry laughed.  "No, that's not what I had in mind.  I was actually thinking that we might make some kind of peace."
"Just need something to calm the nerves," Draco said.  The corners of his mouth turned up.  Harry kissed one corner and then walked away to retrieve some strong alcohol.
Harry saw her supposed demise as Hedwig when she was just his beloved owl.  She couldn't leave him, yet.  There was more to do, she had a letter to deliver. She returned to her cage, where time took care of her wounds.
The whole idea of him fighting off a monster of some sort with a historical sword made him almost giggle.  While he was innately talented in Defence against the Dark Arts, he wasn't brave, at least not like his parents or the other members of the Order of the Phoenix.  He'd heard stories about them and what they did during the war.  He and Neville often joked how lucky they were that they didn't have to prove themselves to be warriors like their parents.  However, this was all beside the point, what did Dumbledore's vision have to do with a Horcrux?
Harry sipped his drink first, hoping to get some liquid courage from the Ogden's.  "I was wondering if you knew where Malfoy was tonight."  Harry asked trying to be nonchalant about the whole thing.
"It's called a Tell-Tale Owl.  They are extremely rare and when one is made it is a patchwork of colours.  The first time it is used to alter a timeline it loses a colour; blue is the last.  Like sunlight reflecting in the deep ocean all colours drain away but blue.  If it is used again, the final bits of magic fade away and it will come back as white, but will not be able to alter time."
"It's a Tell-Tale Owl!" someone shouted, and the courtroom rose in an uproar.  Every member of the Wizengamot was on their feet screaming with horror and outrage.  Minister Fudge banged his gavel on the podium adding to the hysteria.
What the people in the Leaky Cauldron thought when Harry and Draco gathered their belongings and then Disapparated together, the two didn't think about, they were too anxious to see what could have been.
"Just give me a day with that family and this nonsense would end," Nanna said and gave a cackle that sent shivers up Harry's spine.
"Wow!" Draco said while removing the bottle of Bubbleberry wine from his cloak and uncorking it.  He took a long swallow and passed it over to Harry, who did the same.  The both sat there is silence trying to absorb what they had just witnessed.  "So Dumbledore is the one who moved the cage up here in this wizarding space?" Draco said as more of a statement than a question.
"Twenty-three," Draco answered as he successfully removed Harry’s Auror cloak and began working on his trousers.
"Headmaster, did you see the Horcrux or what it was contained in? How does this scene relate to the Horcrux?"
"He's over there," she said pointing to the table farthest away from the Muggle entrance.  Harry went up on his toes and could see Draco Malfoy sipping a drink by the fireplace.  He was alone.
Dumbledore rose from his chair.  "We can discuss it later.  I must go.  You must find Sirius and Remus and tell them about Peter.  But please don't tell them where the information came from."
"If you must," Draco said, removing Harry’s hands and standing up. He reached into his left trouser pocket and pulled out a small tube of lube. Then, with a quick shimmy of his hips, the trousers fell to the floor.
Dumbledore shook his head.  "An even longer story.  But as you know from your parents and Prudence that Voldemort's real name is Tom Riddle and he's a direct descendent of Salazar Slytherin.  The locket belonged to his mother.  There was also a ring, which was the second Horcrux and it belonged to his grandfather.  Both of these family members Tom didn't know as he was raised in an orphanage as his mother died soon after giving birth.  Tom later met up with his grandfather and murdered him."
Harry finished his drink and sent the empty glass towards the highly polished bar.  Seamus raised his head and then his brows when he spotted Harry heading towards Draco Malfoy.
"Please, Headmistress," Harry said, not sure why he was surprised at the topic of conversation. He’d known what was coming. "Just tell us." He’d been preparing for this situation from the start. She was going to tell them that there was no counter spell. It was one of the reasons he'd decided not to have their marriage dissolved the day after their drunken ceremony. Draco wasn’t even sure it was legal, given that they'd travelled to the Channel Islands, hoping to find a Mayor who wouldn’t recognise them. They’d used fake names. It wasn’t bad—being married—even if it was to Draco. Harry liked having someone to share a meal with, to play Quidditch with, to talk and discuss politics with, and especially to have someone who liked sex as much as he did. Even if it was an artificial attraction. Most of the time Harry forgot about that part.
"You said it looked abandoned," Draco said as he held onto shiny gold bars and looked around, inside and out.  The cage looked brand new.  Vines with scented flowers of every colour weaved their way between and around the bars.  Outside, it was a deep blue both up and down.  However, Harry's eyes were fixated on something else completely.  "Looks like you're old owl from Hogwarts," Draco said.
"Let her in," Harry called. He continued to feel badly for his administrator. Before Draco had entered his life, she would barge into his room with any news. Unfortunately, she had entered one afternoon a few days after the bonding. He and Draco had come to fist-a-cuffs and then had ended up snogging on the floor. They hadn’t quite made it to the sofa before Janet walked in and caught them frotting on the carpet.
Harry took a deep breath, inhaling the honeysuckle from his grandmother's garden and remnants of fireworks smoke.  Fred and George had put on a splendid show, saving the golden and red lion for last.  Harry had cheered as the magical beast padded across the starry sky, while Padfoot had barked with approval.  The big dog stayed near his side as Harry had left the circle and wandered to the front of the house. Draco had let him go without following, knowing that Harry would eventually find Dumbledore and had to talk to him alone.  Without a strong reason he walked to the street heading towards the church.  He wanted to say a few words to his grandfather, who had died the year before.  Harry loved the old church and graveyard.  He briefly glanced at Bathilda Bagshot's home as he passed by.  He'd hoped she would have felt better and joined them for his birthday celebration.  He adored the old witch and all of her stories she had shared with him over the years.  He'd stop by tomorrow and bring her some cake.
Harry stared between the golden bars.  The blue sky appeared infinite.  He didn't know how to respond to what Dumbledore had just revealed about bringing House unity.  It seemed an odd thing to say but then saying something odd was not unusual for the Headmaster.  Harry was thrilled that he was going to be Head Boy.  Draco would be jealous but would try and hide it.  Harry hoped that he would at least be a Prefect this year, but that was up to the Slytherin Head of House.  Snape, Harry was sure, would never forgive Draco for being with Harry. James said Snape was just jealous that Draco got his Gryffindor.  Lily always rolled her eyes at that comment.  Harry wondered what he and Draco would be like in that other world…if Voldemort had somehow won.
The black suede sofa looked inviting. The memory of the one other time they had sex in here pushed forward. They’d started on the desk, but Draco had complained of the hard surface. So with a little help of magic, Harry had walked him over to the sofa while they were still joined. Draco had nestled into the down- filled cushions, while Harry had proceeded to pound into him.
Harry frowned and he stopped petting the cat.  "It's been opened before?  Does anyone know where it is?"
"I think we should go before we fall out of the sky," Draco said, bringing Harry out of his happy daze.  Harry looked around.  The flowered vines were withering and the cage bars were bending.  Harry put his other arm around Draco's shoulder and Apparated all of them out of there.
The sky was bluer than blue where the Tell-Tale Owl resided.  Harry sat at the bottom of the cage cross-legged.  He carefully removed the ribbon and uncurled the love letter Draco had written.  It said all there was to say, Harry thought, but that was because he knew Draco, really knew Draco.  It made him physically ill to think of what Draco was going though right now being possessed by Voldemort.  Harry was sure, as was his Nanna, that Voldemort would find a way to create his own body.  In the meantime, though, no one believed Harry that Voldemort was back or that some monster was responsible for all of the deaths.  Lucius Malfoy blamed Harry saying he had been practising Dark magic, the
Harry felt his stomach turn when he saw Tom Riddle's diary fall out Draco's book bag.  Within a few minutes he knew what was going to happen.  They would end up in the Chamber of Secrets.  It also struck him that it might not have been so coincidental that Draco mentioned it before.  Maybe Dumbledore was right, some things were core.
Scenes rushed by, as if a life were being fast forwarded.  There was Dumbledore and Grindelwald ruling the wizarding world.  Dumbledore seemed at a loss as wizards and witches looked at him with terror.  The Muggle world was filled with tortuous scenes of bombs and plagues, and the earth was scorched.  And then it slowed down.  Dumbledore finding a drawing of a cage in Gellert's desk.  He shouldn't have been there, but things had gone too far.  The world was ending.  He was desperate.  Next to the drawing was a feather, a red-one.  Somehow Dumbledore knew what it was and then he appeared in the Time Room at the Department of Mysteries.  There, the owl was sitting on its perch.  She was still mottled but missing a colour.  He opened the cage and dropped the red-feather next to the owl.  He stood with tears in his eyes as scenes had appeared from long ago.  The owl flew to his shoulder.  Dumbledore then withdrew his wand and the cage disappeared.   He petted the old owl.  "I love you, Ariana," he whispered.  An orange feather floated down and Dumbledore snatched it from the air.  Harry and Draco watched the tragedy of Ariana's death happen and Grindelwald running away.  When he showed up at the Department of Mysteries, the cage was gone.  There was no owl.  The scene went blank, the floor solidified, and the orange feather joined the red.
Harry laughed even though his heartbeat quickened as he untied the package Padfoot and Moony had sent him.
Draco snorted.  "Yeah, and I probably shouldn't judge.  I could imagine me in my younger days doing something similar."
Harry snorted.  "Don't think we have a choice now," he said as Hedwig brought forth the green feather and dropped it into the centre like the others.
"Potter, get a hold of yourself!" Draco snapped as he attempted to put the contents back into his bag.  Harry looked up at him with confusion.  He handed Draco a small book along with various quills and ink pots.
Dumbledore stared over the edge of his glasses and nodded once.  "It's true, Harry.  Ariana's death was a turning point for me in my life.  Her death gave me my soul."
Harry searched the shelves in the kitchen for something that Malfoy might like.  He settled on a bottle of Firewhisky Kingsley had given him at his retirement.  He assumed it would be good.  He grabbed two shot glasses and Apparated back to his room.  For an instant he thought maybe it was the wrong room until his eyes adjusted to the change in lighting.  A single candle burned from the bedside table on what was now Draco's side, as Draco was now in his bed, sitting up.  The curtains were drawn open and a view of Muggle London sparkled in the distance. Harry usually had the drapes closed, a habit from being Head Auror.  You never wanted anyone to see you through a window before you saw them, or before the Protection charms activated.  He decided right then that he would always keep them open.
"I can't believe Snape made Vincent Crabbe Prefect of all people.  I seriously doubt he got more than one Owl," Draco mumbled under his breath as he and Harry stood in the corridor of the Hogwart's Express making their way to a cabin not filled with younger, overly-excited students.  The new crop of this year's Prefects were directing people to cars, pretending to be helpful.  Harry winked at Ron, who towered above the crowd.  Ron rolled his eyes.  Harry laughed as he saw his friend directing some first-years to a car reserved for staff and professors.  Harry then grabbed Draco's robe and pulled him into a small, empty cabin and then quickly locked the doors and pulled the blinds.
Sirius and Remus looked over at James as he took his place next to Harry.  They searched for a clue as to why Lily would suddenly be so stern on Harry's seventeenth birthday.   James rolled his eyes.  "If he hasn't become like Dudley yet, Lily, it's not likely he will now."
"You're very correct, Minerva.  I shall therefore use great care and intellect to decipher the message."
"I can't believe he's doing this, Potter.  I mean doesn't he get all that you went through to make the world we have?"
"I know," Harry said and placed his hands on Draco’s shoulders, pulling him back down onto his lap. "I wanted to."
There was a final vision to be played out.  As Harry and Draco sat stunned at all they had seen and experienced, Hedwig moved back to the centre.  The floor swirled around her.  Harry went to reach for her but she looked at him sternly.  He knew that look and let her do what she needed to do.  There were images of her in all of her colours; she had come into her magical existence as a young snowy owl.  A witch, one that looked somewhat familiar to Harry because of her piercing blue eyes, cast spells on the bird.  The magic was Dark, but she only wanted it for good.  The witch would just go back a few years, to the one where her daughter was beautiful and innocent, one where she was whole.  One where Percival would still be home.
"I think you want to talk," Harry said with a grin.  "Can you tell me about it?  I mean is this something the Ministry.…"
The heavy, panelled door opened and shut quickly. "Potter, I know you’re here. I see it didn’t take you long to hear about the trial. Who told you? I warned you that your arse would be kicked."
"No," Dumbledore said, "I don't believe he had an item belonging to Godric.  The only known Gryffindor relic is a sword, which I doubt Tom would even be able to touch it.  The fifth I suspect, Harry, is because I saw something quite terrible in the aviary.  It was so horrible I had to look away for fear of dying."
Harry tried to wrap his mind around what that would entail and couldn't do it on the spot.  However, what was of importance now was that his Godson was hurting and he wasn't sure what he was about to tell him would hurt or help.  "Teddy, I'm glad you didn't find this owl.  Some things are left best as legends.  If you had done what you wanted to then who knows what would have occurred.  It could have been Dark magic.   And plus, my dear Teddy, I do know that more than likely you wouldn't be here right now if you had and that is something I would never want to change."
"Shake it off, Potter," he mumbled to himself.  He knew that even though he was drawn to small bouts of the blues; he didn't do them well.  A single miniature light-fairy flew from the tree and landed on his nose.  She stood there looking very stern with her arms crossed and foot tapping.  "What?" Harry said before batting her gently away.  She buzzed off leaving a lighted trail of glitter and landed on the mantle.  She flickered in a strobe-like manner to get his attention.  He got up from his chair and walked over to the fireplace.  She scampered across the garland to a scroll that was hidden behind a stocking holder.  She tugged on the silver ribbon with little success.  Harry laughed.  "Okay, okay, I guess it is time.  But I'm guessing he's probably busy tonight."  The fairy tapped her foot again.
Draco nodded.  "Potter, I need to know that this world we have now was the right one, that I—we had to go through all of this to have a life...a good life."
Harry shook his head.  "Not yet," he said and turned on his side.  The cat made a few circles on the bedding and then curled up next to him.  "Good Merlin," Harry whispered.
"The fourth was a diadem belonging to Ravena Ravenclaw.  It was the easiest to find as it was at Hogwarts.  Sirius charmed Ravena's daughter, the Grey Ghost, into telling him where it was."
Fear was replaced with disbelief.  Did Voldemort truly think Harry cared about ruling the world?  Did he really think such things drove Harry's dreams for the future?  Harry honestly could say that he never wanted to be all powerful.  Never.  But what he did know was that he was unlikely to get out of the Chamber alive if he said no, and also Draco stood no chance of returning to his former self.  If he tried to escape, whatever killed the others would get him, too.  The monster Dumbledore saw in the other world was here, too.
Harry intertwined their fingers.  "I feel very lucky, too, but I would like more and I will whinge."
Harry sat down and cup of spiced bubbleberry tea appeared next to him.  Harry watched Dumbledore walk around the room's library inspecting spines of books.   Finally, he pulled one out.  Even though it was thinner than most; it seemed to take great force to remove it from the shelf.  Dumbledore then sat down across from Harry and raised a fire in the fireplace.  Despite it being mid-summer, Harry welcomed the flames.
Harry felt a huge weight lift from his shoulders but still felt defeated. He fell back onto the couch. "Why didn't anyone alert me when he committed perjury?"
The first few times Harry had asked him for certain things, Draco had feigned non-interest. Not now. Instead, he leaned over Harry and straddled him with his white shirt tails covering his bum and cock. He handed Harry the lube. "Fuck me like you love me."
Harry laughed, wondering what the hell he was thinking about showing Draco Malfoy a love letter he'd supposedly written.  "I'm not an Auror anymore, Malfoy, and I'm here to talk to you."
Teddy shook his head.  "I know it would be wrong, but just think, Harry, just think if we could have our parents back.  I wanted mine and then I thought you should have yours."
Harry blinked, liking what he was hearing.  Briefly he worried what state his bedroom was in, but then remembered he had actually made the bed in the morning.  "I think that's a brilliant idea.  I'm very curious as to how good you really are at those blow jobs."
"I'm so sorry, Harry," Draco whispered.  "Remember me, remember us," he added even softer and then turned away.
Harry feigned a frown and swiped it from her hand.  The ribbon smelled like fresh linen.  The house elves at the Manor laundered like no others.  Harry loved the scent.  It reminded him of the clean crisp sheets on Draco's bed.
The little owl woke from the branch and hooted loudly.  To Harry's amazement the floor of the cage began to swirl.  It appeared to be like a Pensieve but he didn't feel the pull drawing him in, instead he watched from above.  A scene appeared.  One he knew well.  It was obviously September first.  The Hogwarts train was bellowing smoke as it waited for its passengers, students with their pets, to board.  Steam from the train filled Harry's view and made the scene hazy.  He squinted and tried looking for himself and for Draco.  Then as if someone had took a cloth and wiped a dirty window clean he saw someone; a tall boy with blue hair.  He was laughing with an older girl who looked to be still a student and then they disappeared around a corner.  Harry knew that must be Teddy; the one who sent him the Tell-Tale Owl.  He wondered what the scene had to do with Draco when he heard Ron's voice and then saw Hermione Granger and two kids in tow; obviously they were married and had two children.  He couldn't imagine it.  They'd fought since the first day of their first year.  And then he saw a something that he knew would haunt him forever.  His stomach dropped.  He was with Ginny Weasley.  They were married too, but, then he felt an overwhelming joy. "I have children.  I have children.  Albus Severus," Harry said somehow knowing the boy's name and his siblings: James Sirius and Lily Luna.  And then he caught something in his peripheral vision.  His focus switched to across the crowded platform.  He saw the familiar swath of blond hair.  Draco looked stunning, but then he saw a younger boy.  "Scorpius,"   Harry whispered.  The scene went blank.
Harry's interest perked up.  What of his would be in the Department of Mysteries and what could it be that an Unspeakable would actually let him know?  Teddy reached into the pocket of his cerulean blue robes, which matched his hair.  He pulled out a scroll which contained the Potter seal and tied with a silver ribbon.  He handed it to Harry.  Harry examined the parchment roll.  It appeared relatively new and the seal hardened but not brittle.
Harry stared out the window; rays of sunshine crossed into their bedroom. Apple tree leaves broke up the light streams as an early breeze gently shook the branches. It portended a storm for later in the day. He glanced at the clock on the bedside table; only five minutes had passed since he had awoken with a start. The alarm was set for six, but it wouldn’t be needed this morning. Nor had it been needed for the past week. Harry had been waking up early with his body humming in need for the past four months— since the House Unity Spell went awry. He was too agitated to lie in bed waiting for the clock to chime six.
Harry shivered at the thought.  "No, Malfoy, I didn't find one, but I think one found me in some other time."
Harry was sure she was right.  He'd never understood how Seamus could have fallen in love with Pansy after she'd wanted to turn him over to Voldemort during the Battle, but then again that was four decades ago and people changed.  "Sorry, Pansy, as you know I'm a troll."
followed in suit.  Today he would be arrested.  Mad-Eye let Nanna know ahead of time.  Harry put the quill to the paper and drew a picture of the cage along with the three Ds.  He didn't know what to say but he hoped an older Harry would know what to ask.  Maybe just maybe time would be on his side and reveal the love Draco said would survive.
"Auror Potter, so glad you could join us this fine morning," Kingsley said with a deep chuckle. "I take it the bond is still in effect?" he added with a sly grin.
Harry's chuckle turned into an outright laugh.  "Headmaster, given how many times I've been in your office how can you say that?"
Harry tried to take it all in.  There were his parents and Sirius and Remus and his grandmother.  They were a family, a true family.  There were even visits to the Dursleys. Other scenes were with the Weasleys and Longbottoms and Bones families.  It all seemed so wonderful.  The scene was now his birthday.  The eleven-year-old Harry was happier than Harry ever remembered being as a child. His letter from Hogwarts arrived and his parents were thrilled for him.  They all celebrated. There was no hut on island trying to keep Harry away from magic.
Harry didn't want to see it but then he was forced to.  Dumbledore was at his Pensieve going over details. He was at a loss.  He knew something was wrong.  Then he pulled a memory out, it was of the owl.  He called for her by the name of Ariana and she appeared.  She held no answers.   He searched his desk for the note she once brought to him and found it.  There was a cage drawn on it.  Teddy had drawn it.  Dumbledore laughed in triumph and then disappeared from the scene.  He was in the cage.  He paced in circles before sitting down cross-legged for what seemed to be hours.  In frustration he yelled out, "What did I miss, what did I know in the other timeline?"
"And?" Draco asked as he set the scroll down and picked up the ribbon.  He brought it to his nose and smiled.  "It smells like linens from home when we had the house-elves.  They used to use lavender and rose milk."
"Go, Harry, hurry," Draco said and then hissed a few more words.  The wall opened.  Harry wanted to bring Draco with him but he couldn't even stand on his own.  He reached for him but then Draco's hand rose and grabbed Harry by the throat.  Grey eyes turned red.  Harry swatted the hand away and fled through the opened wall.  Fawkes flew overhead with Dumbledore's body.  The wall closed shut.
The owl flew out of her dungeon and into the town of Godric's Hollow.  She was spotted by another witch, an old witch who recognised what the colours on the owl meant. Bathilda bribed the owl with plump mice and captured her in a golden cage.  She was then brought to the Ministry where she lived in a room where Time had many dimensions.
Harry's heart froze.  Up until this moment, he realised, he hadn't comprehended the severity of the situation.  His parents gone…Remus and Sirius gone…who would want live a life without them?  "How can you tell?" Harry asked, despite his fear of the answer.
"Well there is something good about them not being part of our world," Sirius said.  "I remember my parents sending me a disguised dungbomb for Christmas the year I ran away."
Harry wasn't sure that's what he did.  He could see that the young Harry in that world, despite having all of the privileges, wasn't ready to take on Voldemort, not that anyone was ever ready.  He also didn't have Hermione as one of his best friends to help him.  But the crux was what his grandmother had said: the false timeline tried to merge back to the real one.  And because he wouldn't have escaped Azkaban or the Dementor's kiss, the timeline had to be forced to an end.
Lily set the cage on the round kitchen table cleared of dishes but with a remaining vase of purple posies.   The owl began hooting despairingly.  A cover soon appeared over the cage and silence once again filled the room.
"I ordered the lamb special for you," Hermione said. "I have to be back at Hogwarts in an hour. Minerva requested a meeting with me. I think she’s threatening to retire again."
Images from the moment he first felt the bond filled his thoughts. A jolt of desire shot through him. He wanted Draco right now. His senses erupted. If he closed his eyes he could imagine Draco’s scent. Instead, Harry looked past Hermione at the clock on the wall. The trial should be over by now. Draco would be in his office and probably needed some consoling since Zabini was Draco’s friend. Harry took another huge bite of his sandwich and washed it down with the remaining Butterbeer. "I have to go, Hermione. Sorry, but I just remembered I have to do some paperwork for Kingsley."
Ron didn't press the issue, which Harry was grateful for.  Everyone in the class knew Harry was struggling since he and Draco were no longer partners anymore and that Harry needed to do well to get into the Auror program.  Mad-Eye Moody was a frequent visitor to the Potter home and Harry a frequent visitor to the Ministry.  Gossip abounded as it wasn't often that a member of a well to do family would join such a plebeian group for that type of career.  Harry just ignored them.  He remembered that Draco thought it was a bit macho and seemed to like the idea.  He shook his head at the memory.
The book Dumbledore was holding was brought forward.  Its cover was black crinkled leather.  Something about it repulsed Harry.  He didn't want to touch it. He shook his head as Dumbledore pushed it towards him. "You must know, Harry.  I've protected you as best I could, but, now, now you must know."
Draco huffed.  He walked across the room towards the lighted tree.  Harry let Hedwig go, she perched herself on the mantle.
"No, you prat, it's because I know how many there were in this world and how many would have been in that one.  They’ve destroyed four but they're missing the diary.  Voldemort isn't truly dead until the last Horcrux is accounted for.  My deduction, though, is that it's going to get ugly soon for us.  I'm not sure I want to watch."
Harry shook his head feeling defeated.  "What are you doing here tonight?  Thought you'd be at the Manor hosting some Christmas Ball."
Harry shook his head, trying to clear the sparking of negative thoughts. The tenuous relationship had started with good intentions when the bond was accidentally made, and a reversal spell couldn’t be found. They’d both agreed that they would be equals and would try to respect their differences. Harry never dreamt that not touching Draco before six would fall into that category, especially since it was Draco that had given in to the desire first, almost immediately. Harry’s hand drifted down to his morning wood; it knew better than he and relaxed under his own touch. He sighed with resignation. It only hardened these days with thoughts of Draco, or when Draco touched him.
"Well, there isn't' much to see there.  It looks abandoned, but I did find out that if you ask a question that it will show you something.  It showed me one scene of you and me.  We were young, Draco.  We were at Hogwarts and we were friends.  I was an Animagus, a black cat, and you brought me with you into Slytherin.  It was amazing to see."
Harry smiled as he nodded his head.  Draco was right.  Of course, Dumbledore would sacrifice so much.  Harry took another swig from the bottle and handed it back to Draco. "Here take another, we might need it for the yellow feather," he said with a laugh.  It seemed surreal that he and Draco were up in some bird cage watching timelines that had once existed and thinking that things could have been so different.  He hoped what was coming next wouldn't be as dire.   Hedwig picked up the yellow feather and hopped back over to the centre, dropping it in.  Draco's left hand reached for a bar, grasping it tight as the floor swirled once again.
"I'll pour, you get naked," Draco said.  Harry did as he was told and set the bottle and glasses down next to the candle and made quick haste in taking off his clothes.  He set them on a chair by the window.  He stepped back to the bed.  Draco had pulled back the sheets and cover for him.  The white sheets almost glowed in the low light.  They were the softest he'd ever had.  He considered it a major indulgent at the time, but Lily had told him he wouldn't regret it.  She, of course, was right.  Harry slipped in between the sheets and sat up next to Draco.  The headboard's black leather cushioning was enough of a comfortable support.  Draco handed him a shot of Firewhisky.  Harry initiated the toast and their glasses clinked.  The burn down his throat wasn't too strong but the immediate tingle it gave was enough to get things started.  Draco set down his glass and then took Harry's away too.  Harry's spectacles were the next to go.  Draco carefully folded them up and placed them safely behind the candle holder.
Magical rope emerged from Draco's wand and bound Harry to the statue of Salazar Slytherin.  Harry tried to move but it was futile.  If prophecies were to be believed then he knew at this point that it was likely he would be the one to die. "Harry, I am not stupid and neither is your Draco.  You don't want to help me, but, you will.  You will with your blood.  Harry didn't anticipate what happened next; Draco's wand-tip touched Harry on his forehead and made a mark.  Harry felt his skin slice open and release blood so quickly his vision was blurred.
"And Professor Snape doesn't know?" Harry asked teasingly.  He enjoyed bugging his mother over her friendship with her childhood friend.  Snape seemed to detest Harry and was extra harsh on him in class but not in his grades.  Harry always assumed the only reason he didn't have a Troll was because Snape was afraid of losing Lily as a friend.
"Yes, I suppose it is," Dumbledore responded.  They both stepped back as a door not seen before opened and a familiar owl swooped in.  It landed on Harry's shoulder and nibbled on his ear.
"Yeah, that sounds about right, but it wasn't formal or anything.  It just kind of happened that way."
Minerva thinned her lips and shook her head.  Harry knew that she knew that the Headmaster wasn't even considering not opening it.
Draco snorted. "Yes, Potter, I did. What happened to no shop talk?" Draco asked and then took one end of the tie and led Harry over to the couch. "I like the atmosphere, Potter. And I do feel like celebrating."
The logs in the fireplace were crackling and spitting out embers. Harry hung his cloak on the coat rack by the hearth. He loved Draco’s office. He wasn’t sure if had he ever told him so. Draco’s carved ebony desk was without a speck of dust, and all papers were neatly stacked. Harry grinned as he noticed his note had been set on top.
Harry barely listened to the remaining breakfast chatter; his eyes were focused on the gifts.  Without warning, another one appeared.  It was large and wrapped in green.  He smiled as the crack in the air brought his boyfriend to his side.  Sirius moved his chair closer to Remus and conjured another for Draco to sit down.
"W-w-what?" Harry stuttered. He looked over at Draco. He had his head turned and was staring at a large cushion on a stone bench placed in front of the southern arched window. Even from where he sat, Harry could see a coating of cat hair on the pillow. "You knew," Harry whispered, feeling like a fool.
Harry shook his head at his mother's curiosity.  She was definitely in the right profession but he feared one day she'd go too far while investigating some artefact or place.  "You're going to tell Dad aren't you?"
Harry took a long sip of tea, only partially bothered that the Headmaster knew exactly what he had been thinking. However, he was more anxious to discover what Dumbledore saw it and how it related to a fifth Horcrux.
Harry rolled his eyes, knowing he was doomed. Draco leant over him and placed his lips on Harry's. He tasted of scotch. Draco’s right hand worked its way up Harry’s thigh. Harry adored when Draco did this, took his time. Not to say he didn’t like to be stricken starkers with a spell, but this— this was nice. Draco’s lips made their way across his cheek.
Teddy smiled.  It was his mother's free and generous smile but his brown eyes were his father's.  "You know I can't tell you the details.  I probably shouldn't say anything at all, but, I feel you need to know that I believe it came from another timeline."
"We believe that Tom Riddle opened the chamber when he was at school.  Remember I told you about Moaning Myrtle in the girl's bathroom?  Well she died during that time period. Hagrid was blamed for it, which we know he didn't do it, but he doesn't have any more information than we have.  It's not called the Chamber of Secrets for nothing," Lily added with a wry grin.
This wasn’t what Harry had expected Draco to say. "What happened? Nobody told me anything." he said as he pulled off his cloak, letting it fall to the sofa. He needed to know how bad it was. He shook his head; this was the first time his desire had been squashed by an incident.
Harry shook his head.  "No, no we don't, Draco.  I've seen what I wanted to see.  We were young, we were in love and we thought it would last.  Why would I want to see it end?"
Harry smiled.  He let his hand slide down Teddy's shoulder before bringing it back to his desk, picking up a picture.  It was a picture of the original Order of the Phoenix; One where he usually stared at to see his parents and his godfather, Sirius.  It was over the years of looking at it that he noticed special looks between Sirius and Remus.  He was very sure they had been in love.  It didn't surprise him. "I'm not sure your father and mother would have got together, Teddy.  I think Sirius and Remus were a couple."
As soon as Harry had taken that last swallow Draco's hands reached for Harry and pulled him back up to the pillows.  "And I was the one who was supposed to be decent at that," Draco said and then kissed Harry fully on the mouth while his hands made their way down Harry's body.
"And if you didn’t follow the rules, what would happen?" Hermione asked, sounding concerned as she took their lunch plates off the floating serving platter.
Harry brought his hand to his forehead, knowing a headache would be coming on soon. A glass of scotch, clinking with ice cubes, landed on the overstuffed chair's arm. He reached for it and sipped deeply. He could feel Draco watching him intently. Normally he would hold his feelings in, but that felt so wrong to do with Draco. Their relationship didn’t work that way.
if there wasn't something.  "Draco, I received this note and I can vouch for its authenticity," Harry said and reached into the pockets of his coat searching for the scroll.  He pulled it out and handed it to Draco.  Butterflies filled his stomach.  He reached for his wine while he waited for Draco's reaction.
"I think I know, but should we find out for sure?" Dumbledore asked.  His eyes twinkled as they peered over his half-moon glasses.  Harry knew there was no doubt they would find out soon.  His mother's eyes were now sparkling more than his Headmaster's.  Curiosity was feeding them both.  It had always been their downfall.
"Will you be joining us for breakfast, Draco?" Lily asked while directing a mug of steaming hot coffee to land before him.
Harry smiled.  "Thanks, I almost forgot.  I hope I'll see you later tonight at the Hog's Head for a shot or three to celebrate me leaving this place and that birthday thing.  The kids are all going to be there; James arrived home last night."
Harry's eyes widened.  He knew the Headmaster favoured him in some ways, ways in which most students weren't aware of given how often Harry was in trouble and seen polishing awards won by his father, but, to play with timelines?  "Because of me?  But I looked fine—at least physically.  I mean Draco will kill me for marrying Ginny Weasley, but it looks like he married the younger Greengrass witch, which is just bizarre given that Draco has been out about his sexuality before most kids even know about sex. And…"
"But then wouldn't I be sending a note back now with a Tell-Tale Owl instead of bringing you a love note from Draco Malfoy with the Potter seal?  I mean you can only have one timeline existing at one time."
The sun began to set over the trees lining the west side of the lake.  The boys turned to each other and kissed.  It was soft and it was simple and that was it.  From then on the scenes were mainly of them.  They both laughed as Harry learned to become a cat and how Draco brought the cat with him into the Slytherin common room and dorm, which was strictly forbidden.  There were also many scenes of Harry doing detention for playing pranks on students from every house.  Sirius and he would write back and forth coming up with plans.
"Just barely," Harry responded.  His mother entered the room shutting the door behind her but not before a very large grey tabby cat snuck in.  It promptly raced across the room and jumped up on Harry's bed and began purring as it stepped up on his chest looking for morning pets.  Harry obliged.
Harry paused. He didn’t have a simple answer; it was more of a feeling. With the bond, he’d learned to pay attention to what his instincts told him. "Because, Hermione, we’re married now. It’s okay. Just leave it."
"No, Malfoy, it won’t all be fine. The community will want my hide, as well as they should. I let this happen because I was too busy fucking you!"
Ron covered his mouth as he laughed.  He grabbed a large glass of milk and held up his hand until he finished swallowing.  "No, mate, she's just got a bad tea leaf reading in Trelawney's class yesterday.  The ol' fraud said evil was abounding today so Lavender's not getting out of bed.
Draco sat straight up. "You didn’t just say that," he said, staring straight into Harry’s eyes. Harry could tell Draco was trying to read him, see if he was putting him on. "You don’t have to say it."
Draco snickered. "Um, Potter, you know the Wizengamot is sealed while in session. And immediately afterwards, Ron was foaming at the mouth to tell you, but I had asked Kingsley before the trial to let me be the one to tell you."
Draco's face went ashen. "Yes," Draco said with hesitation.  "Please don't tell me you found one and want to change this timeline."
Before either of them had a second thought, Lily added her wand tip to Dumbledore's and touched the hair.  She whispered a charm.  Names in golden script slowly appeared one letter at a time.  A rare gasp escaped from Dumbledore and a tear dropped from Lily's eyes.  Harry couldn't resist the temptation to look.  One named appeared at the top and two below, he knew immediately those below were the parents of this wizard named Teddy who claimed to be his godson.  He couldn't imagine how those two got together.  Bill Weasley and Tonks seemed like the perfect couple and nothing would break up Moony and Padfoot.
Harry hopped out of bed and headed towards the shower. It never hurt to get to work early, see what the night shift Aurors had been up to and to prepare for the day. He’d been doing it all week.
Draco shook his head.  "No, they didn't.  But why are we talking about linens and house-elves?  Tell me about this adventure."
Nanna cackled as she leaned over and kissed him on the cheek.  "You sweet boy.  You will still have our love.  You will always have our love.  Remember what you told me what Dumbledore said about core things remaining.  We'll my favourite grandson, our love is central.  But you can wait if you like, until you're absolutely sure it's the right thing to do."
"Well, if it's a ring, I'll hex his arse back to the Manor," James said in a tone that Harry noted held more than a hint of warning.  "You're too young to get that serious and there's no pressing situation for you to make that type of commitment."
"You didn't send a note to yourself saying what the Horcruxes were?" Harry asked.  He felt embarrassed asking the obvious.
Far away he heard a call of a bird and then a loud bang. Draco released a hiss of a sound.  Harry blinked furiously to see what was happening around him.   He heard another voice; it was talking to him, trying to comfort him.  It was Dumbledore.  Harry felt a moment of relief but then spells darted around him.  He wanted to duck but couldn't.  The chamber walls shook releasing rocks which tumbled around him and he felt the statue vibrate.  He was sure if a spell didn't hit him then surely he would be crushed.  He felt light headed as more blood trailed down his face.  He could taste it as it seeped into his mouth.  As his head slumped forward, surrendering to a darkness that promised peace, he heard the bird again, it was nearby.  The bird used its talons to scratch the ropes away from the statue.  Harry fell to the cold ground and then warm liquid drops fell onto his face.
"I know that lake!" Draco said, drawing Harry's attention away from the lake and back into their real world.  "It's hidden from Muggles.  My parents used to take me there before...well before."
"Well I can't solve his erectile dysfunction problem without it," Nanna said before sipping down the rest of her tea.  Harry saw the mischievous glint in her still bright brown eyes peeking over the teacup rim.  He gave her another wink.
Draco’s body was dragged backwards by seemingly invisible hands, and handily plopped back into the chair next to Harry.
Dumbledore smiled.  "How very like you, Harry, to worry about the Horcruxes instead of your own well being.  Very well, we shall discuss the Horcruxes first.  I said I believed there were five, but that is conjecture based upon a scene from the other timeline.  I do know of four.  Your parents and friends and I have retrieved them and disposed of them.  There are great and fabulous stories behind each of them, which I will leave that honour for your parents to tell" Dumbledore said with a grin.  Harry could imagine the Marauders and his mother having incredible adventures in taking care of such evil tokens.
Harry barked out a laugh.  Patrons at tables nearby glanced over at them.  Draco opened the bottle of wine and poured the glasses full.  Harry marvelled at the deep indigo colour.
"No, Lily, I meant more that there isn't the urgency we all felt during the war," James responded.  He leant over and kissed Lily on the cheek.  "And you know I have no regrets—it's just…."
Harry was stunned. A deluge of competing emotions overwhelmed him: Anger that Draco hadn’t shared this information earlier, worry that Draco had used him, hope that Draco still wanted him since he had stayed, and then the events from earlier in the day pushed forward. "And that’s why you could do what you did in court today, too?"
"Yes, I do mind, Potter, and don't get too comfortable.  What the hell are you doing here on Christmas Eve?  Don't you have some damsel in distress to save tonight or is it blokes these days?"
Draco didn’t turn towards him but shook his head. "No, I didn't know for sure, but I'd guessed it was fading."
Harry covered his mouth trying to restrain a chuckle.  The gift of new robes in sparkling red with flashing gold trim had made them all laugh. Draco returned home by the New Year.  "He should be here soon.  My guess is that he's still torn about what to give me, as if I wouldn't like anything the berk gave me."
Dumbledore nodded and then put his arm around Harry's shoulder.   Harry felt the familiar pull that he'd experienced with his parents so many times before, but, this time, he didn't know where his destination was.
In a secret room, Kendra Dumbledore magically painted the owl with her hopes and dreams.  Each layer of colour aged the bird; the burden of the Dark magic was heavy.  She was so absorbed in her work she didn't see that her daughter, Ariana, had found her and tried the same spell on her.  Ariana only wanted to see her mother in those beautiful colours.  Kendra left the world and would never return in either timeline.
Draco laughed; it was too high pitched and made Harry's skin crawl.  "What happened?  Maybe I came to my senses, Potter.  Maybe I realised that I have a lot of life to experience and I don't need to be weighed down by some four-eyed git."
"Come on, Potter, it’s been eight hours and you know you want to fuck me. You need to fuck me. Isn’t that what you were thinking about forty-five minutes ago?"
Lily sighed with resignation.  The kitchen door burst open and large black dog entered followed by James, Remus and Draco.  James gave Lily a questioning look.  Her lips thinned and her eyes lowered.  She gave a nod to Dumbledore.
"And so I’m sure you see the urgency in telling you now," McGonagall said. "I think you need time to adjust to this new situation and think about your marriage."
A soft knock preceded the door opening a crack.  "Harry," his mother whispered as she peeked in.  "Are you awake?"
"Well if you end up running off to Shangri-La with Draco Malfoy then I guess you can thank me.  Happy Birthday, Harry."
"I said, Mr Potter, that the bond dissipates on its own and that is why there is no counter spell. It stays in effect long enough to make sure that house unity is stabilized, so the school can continue to evolve."
"You did it!" Draco said with exhilaration.  "You fucking did it!  You had the bollocks just to end it.  To make sure that Voldemort was truly was dead.
"Horcruxes," Harry said and took another drink of wine.  It was almost gone and he was sad over it. He wished he had a grandmother in this world that grew bubbleberries in her garden.
"Lavender's busy?" Harry asked.  "Don't tell me you two broke up too."  Ron hadn't gone to Hogsmeade without Lavender since the previous year.
Harry response was halted by the sound of the Floo network activating. Draco grabbed Harry’s cloak and threw it across their laps.
The Christmas tree was the smallest one he'd had since he was in Auror training.  It sat on a table in the centre of the bay windows facing the street.  From the outside, it looked warm and charming, but inside it only reminded him how lonely he was.  The kids were at the Burrow with Ginny tonight.  He was invited, but it felt much too odd to be there on both Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.  He would go for Christmas dinner, Mollie insisted, and to be honest, it didn't take much insistence.  Harry positioned the presents under the tree, there seemed to be too few.  He remembered fondly back to when the room was filled with presents and the kids and their cousins had gone wild with paper and ribbons.  Now, however, even the fairy lights seemed less twinkly.
"Sir, I'm of age now.  I think I can handle hearing what you have to tell me," Harry said and then winced at the sky.  It was darkening.
Harry smiled.  "I know.  I told you I got it for my birthday.  It's taken me until now to show it to you, but I have to tell you, Draco, I went there.  I went to the cage."
A small Harry was in Hogwarts train car with Ron and Neville.  They were relieved to be there as the corridors were filled with older students pushing their way through.  Draco was accidently shoved into their car.  Harry introduced himself and they shook hands.  Draco seemed apprehensive about talking with them, but, then Harry told him to sit down and then other first years started coming in.  It became filled to the brim.  They all talked about getting their letters, what magic they knew, they guessed how they would be put into their houses, and told stories they had heard about the giant squid.  When the trolley came by selling sweets, both Harry and Draco put out a few Galleons and bought treats for everyone.  Even before reaching Hogsmeade and the lakes edge where boats would take them to the castle, they were bonded.  They would be united despite the houses they were separated into.
Harry's eyes widened.  Despite the seriousness of the moments before, his mouth watered with the knowledge that Fortescue's ice cream cake awaited him.  Draco ruffled his hair as Harry headed out the door.
Harry looked up at the majestic blue owl.  Her bright orange eyes stared at him; she cocked her head to side, making him smile.  She looked so innocent, but he knew she was here because of battles gone wrong.  "Hedwig," Harry said; he heard Dumbledore chuckle in approval.
"No, Time-Turners were only able to go back a few hours, maybe up to a day if it was a twenty-four-hour Time-Turner, which were very rare. They were man made.  I believe this is a product of nature."
Draco turned his hand over and squeezed Harry's hand now in his.  "I've been told I'm pretty decent."
Harry awoke; he had no idea how long he'd been unconscious.  He removed his glasses which were askew and broken.  Slowly he wiped the dried blood from his eyes so he could see.  Perched over him was the Headmaster's phoenix.  Harry struggled to get to his knees.  He couldn't see beyond the bird as the chamber was in complete darkness.  He felt around the dirt floor.
With great stealth he learned from being an Animagus cat, he walked over to Draco standing at the chipped sinks looking into a book which seemed to have blank pages.  Harry thought it was the same one that had fallen out of Draco's book bag on the train.  With a self-inking quill Draco wrote on the page
The early summer sunrise woke him up.  Pink clouds with tinges of purple filled the eastern sky.  Harry sighed, cursing himself for not closing the bed drapes before he went to sleep.  He reached for his wand on the bedside table and worked the magic, but it was too late.  He was awake and his mind was already filling with thoughts of Horcruxes and the Prophecy.  He reached for his glasses to unblur his world and noticed that Draco had left a letter near where his wand had been.  While Harry knew Draco probably hoped to sneak into the Manor before his parents detected that he was missing, Harry wished he had stayed.
"What do you think the golden cage with the three Ds underneath it means?" Harry asked.  "It looks like something I drew."
"Can I ask more than one question?" Harry asked.  While he wanted to know about him and Draco, he was apprehensive of asking that question right now, thinking that Dumbledore would expect something more serious.
"You can.  I need you to come somewhere with me.  Someplace that might change how you think about your life and how I think about mine."
Harry shed more tears over a grandmother he'd never met.  He wished he'd known her in this life.  Her wisdom and unconditional love for him was sorely missed. He wondered how she had died in this life; he knew from her gravesite that it was right before that Halloween.
Draco’s hand reached up and grabbed Harry’s before he could pull it away from his hair. "Come on, Potter, you don’t have to leave now," Draco said as he took Harry’s hand and then placed it on the blanket covering his erection. Harry smiled and bent over and kissed Draco dryly on the lips.
"May I see the bird?" Dumbledore said while leading Harry to inside of the house away from the crowd landing on the lawn.  Harry hadn't realised that he was shielding a small bird from everyone in his hands.  Once inside the kitchen, Harry lifted his top hand revealing a young baby owl deep blue in colour.  His instinct was to stroke the feathers, as the bird nested in his left palm.  Dumbledore reached out and grabbed his right hand.   "Don't, don't stroke it until you are sure.  The bird is a fledgling, which means you will have time to choose."
"To ask me?" Pansy said, startling Harry as she appeared right next to him without her trays.  "I'm not sure besides ordering a drink or meal that you've ever said anything more than 'Congratulations Parkinson' on my wedding day and that was ten years ago."
Harry laughed.  He was in a bit of a shock that Draco stated his intentions of wanting to try a relationship.  For a moment Harry wondered if they ever did fall in love, would it be enough to overcome Draco's pompous behaviour?  He didn't dwell on it too long as warm lips met his and the taste of Bubbleberry wine was his again.  A small fairy sighed a happy sigh and twinkled brighter than usual.
Dumbledore raised his hand and removed his spectacles.  With his other hand he rubbed his eyes.  For the second time that day Harry noticed how old Dumbledore appeared.
Harry screamed in fear.  He had assumed the cage was stable on the cloud.  His legs began to tremble; he joined Draco on the bottom of the cage.
"Harry, don't fear me.  You and I could have all of this.  Draco could be yours forever.  You just need to help me, help me live again.  Together we could rule this world and the Muggle one too if you so desire."
Harry shivered.  He wanted to hear the whole prophecy.  He'd read about them in Divination the years he took the course but never really believed in them.  For the Headmaster to put credence in one then there must be something to them after all.  But, right now, what seemed more important than the prophecy was learning about the Horcruxes.
"I'm surprised Draco hasn't made an appearance yet, Harry," Lily said as she reached across James' plate and set a very small present next to Harry's tea and iced bubbleberry juice.  The fragile bubbleberry bush was one his grandmother raised with care.  "I assumed he'd be showing up before the rest."
"How many, Headmaster?" Harry asked while setting the book down on the chessboard.  He'd seen enough.  He brushed his fingers on his trousers before he picked up the bubbleberry tea and sipped it.  The flavour brought him comfort.  He guessed his grandmother had shared her precious harvest with the Headmaster.
They focused back to their younger versions as they were flying on the newest of brooms, Draco in the lead.  They swooped through the sky high enough to touch clouds and then low enough to let their feet touch treetop leaves. They slowed when a small lake appeared below.  Harry followed Draco down.  A blanket was laid out on the lakes shore and a basket of picnic delights along with a few bottles of Butterbeer was spread out.
"Merlin, Potter, I wasn't going to leave, I was just going to suggest that we go somewhere else to do this."
"I have to go see Kingsley," Harry said and stood up quickly. "Why didn't anyone signal me using our coin, or send me an owl or even Floo? Fuck have I become that irrelevant that I don't even get notified that one of my Auror's committed a crime? Shit, why was Sloper dealing Dragon Eggs?" Suddenly, the past few months seemed like a bizarre dream.
Dumbledore smiled.  "I don't think so, yet, but, now that we know that you survived in this other time, and that Voldemort did not, then we might get evidence that this is not the real timeline."
"We would kill each other," Harry replied and then took an overly large bite of the warm lamb, generously stuffed in a crusted roll. He actually wasn’t sure what they would do now, but in the first few months rules had definitely been needed.
"I like it," Harry said.  "I thought I recognised it but I guess not.  Don't think the Hogwarts elves used it."
Pansy put her hand on Harry's shoulder and stood up on her toes and got up close to his face and looked at him straight in the eyes.  He never knew hers were so brown and full of life.  "I'm only going to tell you because Seamus likes you.  I don't.  Never have, never will.  But now you can do me a favour; I don't want Draco to know I told you.  You got that?" she said as she took her hand off his shoulder and poked him in the chest.
The ride down was frightening.  The pipe was large and slick with slime.  He had no idea where it would end as it turned in various directions while dropping continuously.  Finally, he hit the ground.  Before he even looked around he pulled the cloak back around him.  When he did glance around, he saw he was in a large low-lit tunnel.  He opened the map up and it showed nothing but empty space.  He folded it back up and put it in his pocket.  He ran ahead, hoping to catch up to Draco.  His thoughts turned to figuring out where he was and then the idea came to him that maybe it was the tunnel was leading to the Chamber of Secrets.  Maybe he would find the fifth Horcrux.  And then it hit him maybe it was the book Draco was carrying.  These thoughts filled his brain along with his mother's warning not to go in alone.  He slowed down as he came to a blind corner.  He peeked around it.  The tunnel had come to an end. Draco was standing before a solid wall, but, even in the dim light Harry could see four emerald eyes glistening from the wall.  The jewels belonged to two carved entwined snakes.  Harry quietly stepped forward.  He could here Draco's heavy breath but worse he could smell the scent of Draco's soap.  He wanted to reach out and touch him, to tell him to stop, to talk it out, but he didn't.  He had to see where this led.  The Chamber of Secrets must be on the other side of the wall.  Draco opened the book once again.  Harry saw him write out the words stating that he was before the Chamber and once again letters appeared.  Draco hissed out words while the two snakes separated and the wall cracked evenly open.  Harry didn't know where to look.  He saw a huge darkened chamber ahead that Draco was running into but then he also heard shouting coming from the tunnel behind.  It sounded like his father and his friends. The Chamber wall began to shut.  Harry ran in.
Lily shook her head and put her hand on Harry's shoulder, giving it a quick squeeze.  "I can tell," she said.  "This has nothing to do with my work, though, I do admit trying to research it from there, but, had no success."
"No!" Harry said and unwrapped his end of the tie, letting it fall. "Tell me what happened or I’m going back to the office now."
"I’m sorry, Harry," Hermione said and reached across the table, patting Harry’s hand. "You know I’m still researching the situation every spare moment I have and so is every other staff member."
Now it was Draco who bore the brunt of Snape's disdain.  It happened when he and Harry had come out as a couple in their fifth year.  Harry smiled internally remembering that moment when their friendship turned into something more.  They'd taken a ride on their brooms from the Manor's gardens to a hidden lake where they'd lain on the shore staring up at big puffy clouds.  Somehow their hands had touched and they had intertwined their fingers.  They had stayed that way for hours talking of nothing.  The long moment ended with a simple kiss, which had set the course for the rest of their lives.  There was no question for either that they would always be together.
Harry stared at the white snowy owl.  She looked so much like his Hedwig, but it couldn't be, could it? He held out his arm. The owl hooted at him and flapped her wings as she stepped off the perch and landed on Harry's cloaked arm.  If this is all that happened, Harry thought, this would be enough.  He petted her and she cooed.
"Auror Potter, you have an owl from Solicitor Malfoy," Janet said after knocking on Harry’s office door and opening it a crack.
"The third receptacle was a cup belonging to Helga Hufflepuff.  It was in Bellatrix Lestrange's vault."
"So how rare is the bubbleberry?" Harry asked as he took his first sip.  The wine tasted the way he imagined magic would if it had a flavour.  It was light and sweet, like a blueberry, but then it came on stronger, showing its depth with a hint of bitterness followed by honey.
"I told Kingsley, Harry. I told him when I discovered what had happened. I knew the minute I saw the memory it wasn’t Zabini. Blaise wouldn't eat chips from the Hog’s Head, and on top of it, he's right handed. Sloper used his left hand to eat and then again when he used his wand to Disapparate.
Instantly the room came to a standstill in sound and movement.  The Wizengamots' eyes all focused on the witness chair, where Harry Potter was bound in chains.  Harry glanced out to the audience until he found an old witch with long grey hair.  She gave him a warm smile and a short nod.   Harry then rubbed his cheek against the owl perched on his shoulder.
Harry furrowed his brow as he thought about what he would write.  Then he came to a decision and set the breakfast tray aside and threw back the covers.  "I'll be back in a few minutes," he said as he put on his dressing gown and tightened the sash.  He opened the drawer of his bedside table and withdrew a scroll with a silver ribbon, his seal, and a quill.  Before his grandmother could say
"Talk? What do we have to talk about? The bond is nearly over. You can get back to your life. I’m sure our marriage can be dissolved by tomorrow given your status."
"What?" Harry asked.  His thoughts were still on him and Draco having wives and children.  He shook his head trying to clear the fog of timeline thoughts.  "Why wouldn't you have known?"
"Or maybe it isn’t, and Harry moved out and forgot to set his alarm," Ron said, a little too hopefully. Harry noted that Ron winced when his blue eyes scanned Harry’s appearance. Harry didn’t respond but instead took his seat at the head of his conference table opposite the Minister. He waited for what Kingsley had to say. Kingsley rarely addressed Harry’s team.
Without questioning Draco’s motives, Harry did so. It was the part of the bond that had taken Harry the longest to get used to, but now was the part he loved the most. Yes, love, he thought to himself as he took a long sip of the amber spirit. Despite what Hermione said, there was love. He loved that the bond forced him and Draco to trust each other implicitly. Neither could hurt the other intentionally. So whatever Draco had done in that courtroom might hurt Harry professionally, but it was a matter of work. It wasn't personal.
"Headmistress," Draco said with a slight bow of his head and then took one of the empty seats in front of her desk. Harry sat in the other.
Harry lowered his wand under her stern glare. He then placed his hand on Draco’s wrist, holding him firmly. "I’m sorry, Headmistress, but I must have missed what you said."
"Potter you're an arse, it's more than fine," Draco said and placed Harry's hand on his head.  He slid under the covers and took Harry's cock into his mouth.
"Fuck," Draco groaned as Harry opened his mouth and took in more than half and began to suck while his head moved up and down.  "Oh God, keep going," Draco cried out as Harry wrapped his fingers around the remaining length.  Harry's hand and mouth took Draco's cock all in, and almost all out, over and over.   Draco's fingers made their way into Harry's hair.  They needed something to purchase.  "Oh shit, I'm going to come," Draco said as his body took over and he fucked Harry's mouth.
Dumbledore's eyes narrowed as he examined the bird from side to side.  Gently, he nudged it to rise up.  A quick smile crossed his face and with his wand he removed a piece of paper beneath the bird.  He unfolded it and a green owl feather floated away from it.  Dumbledore reached out and caught it.
Lily narrowed her eyes.  "I don't know, Harry, what I'm going to do, yet.  Severus wouldn't allow James to come with us.  I'm hoping to talk Severus into telling Albus."
Janet nodded and raised her cherry wood wand. A whoosh of teal sparkles emerged and attacked Harry’s hair, flattening it down. With another flick a large cup of coffee floated into his hands.
Harry looked down at Draco's hand, which was still on his knee.  It felt nice, especially now when discussing the Prophecy.  He put his hand over Draco's, taking a chance.  "Yeah, I'll have to tell you the sordid details later, but it involves Snape, which by the way, I think I like it better when he treated you more poorly than me."
Harry glared down at Draco. Without warning, old feelings of hate for Draco filled him. Draco had found a way to get out of the bond. Fucking Slytherin.
Harry nodded.  "Yes, Pansy, I got that," he said and stepped away from her finger and backed into the wall.  She gave him a half-grin.
Harry opened the map.  "I solemnly swear that I am up to no good," Harry said while pointing his wand at the parchment.  His eyes then focused on the Slytherin seventh-year dorm room, a place he knew very well.  He missed hiding behind the green curtains surrounding Draco’s bed.  However even if Snape came into the room all the Head of House would find would be Draco and his black cat.  Harry smiled thinking about how long they'd fooled the whole school into thinking that Draco owned a black cat.  His attention was drawn back to the map as he watched the castle clear of the older students.  Draco's name paced the dorm room and then the Slytherin common room.  Harry walked over to his trunk and lifted the lid.  He pulled out his father's Invisibility Cloak and wrapped it around himself.  He felt a tinge of guilt over spying on Draco, but when Draco's name made its way out of the snake's lair, adrenaline overruled and Harry ran out of his own dorm room.  He clambered down stairs as he watched Draco climb up stairs.  Harry tried to keep his steps somewhat quiet as he passed a group of second-years heading to the library on the fourth floor.  He stopped on the second floor landing.  Draco was around the corner.  Harry squinted at the map, not quite believing what he was seeing.  Draco was entering a girl's bathroom.  One Harry knew was marked "Out of Order" and had been since he entered the school.  It was the one where his mother had told him Moaning Myrtle haunted.  Harry quickly made his way there.  He held his breath as he opened the door a crack and peeked in.  Draco was too involved with reading a small book to notice when Harry snuck in.
"So it wasn't a magical creature you were investigating," Harry asked, recognising it wasn't the most important question to ask but his Auror training breaking through, that it was best to start from the beginning.
"What I'm going to tell you Harry is something I should've told you before, but I couldn't.  You and your parents are so happy, the way it should be.  I didn't want to hurt you and your perfect family."
The scent of fried potatoes and bacon gently brought Harry out of his slumber.  He awoke with a smile; today was the day he'd looked forward to his whole life; he was now a wizard of legal age.  He snuggled in the light-down duvet covering his extra-large bed.  Despite it being mid-summer, the mornings in Godric's Hollow tended to be cool.  The visible light blue sky with fluffy morning clouds called to him.  He longed to be up there and the Quidditch game today promised to be epic.  He dared to hope that the Firebolt II broom would be one of his presents.  He and his friends, he was sure, would demolish his father and his compatriots.  Yes, they were more experienced, but Harry had noticed a slight slowness in their reactions recently as they hit late thirties.  Moony would be slow, anyway, given that that the full moon was only two days gone.  A soft knock on the bedroom door brought him out of his daydream.
"Are you saying you want to stay with me?" Draco asked as he moved even closer to Harry, practically sitting on his lap.
Draco shook his head.  "I need another drink because I have no fucking idea what you're blabbering about."
Harry removed the cloak, it wasn't necessary anymore.  "I don't know who it is," he said, hoping this thing who was possessing Draco's body would believe him.
Harry opened the extremely poorly wrapped present, knowing it was from the Dursleys.  He could never fathom why his mother insisted on their maintaining a pretence of a family relationship.  He knew she had sent Dudley a video camera for his birthday the month before and he knew it had probably been ignored. The previous Christmas he was forced to go to their house on Privet Drive in Surrey.  He'd discovered while using his father's Invisibility Cloak that all of the presents his mother had sent over the years had been stashed in the closet under the stairs, unwrapped.  The spiders had added their own ribbons. Harry laughed as the wadded up paper revealed a toothpick.  He threw it at Sirius.  It never reached its destination but exploded in a small burst of flames.
The wind blew open the balcony's French doors and whipped through the room; the violet curtains billowed. Lightning lit up the sky outside and in, and then thunder shook the window panes. Only magic kept them from shattering. The chandelier flames held still. Harry saw it all out of his periphery. His main focus was on Draco straddling him, riding his cock, his face contorted with bliss. Harry was drained - he wouldn’t be coming again tonight - but still he remained hard. Draco wanted him, needed him, and Harry's body responded. He reached up with his right hand and grasped Draco around the back of the neck, then pulled him down. He wanted a kiss.
"We agree," Harry said and then became silent as the scene switched to him Apparating back to his bedroom on his birthday.  "Holy crap, Malfoy, are you that good at blow jobs?"
Dumbledore cleared his throat.  Harry felt the heaviness of the moment.  Discussing how many parts of Voldemort's soul remained was worse than most nightmares he ever had.  "In the other timeline there were seven.  In this world, I believe there are five but I cannot be sure, there may be more or even less."
Harry shook his head.  "You mean there are alternate timelines?"  Harry asked and glanced over at his mother.  Her green eyes were as wide as he'd ever seen.
"Now you stay with him," Teddy said to the owl as he stroked her back.  "He might need you.  I might have screwed things up."
"Harry," Dumbledore said softly as Harry approached him and looked up with a sad smile.  "Harry, my boy, if she lived, so many more would have died by not only Gellert's hand but my own."
"Should have been awake forty-five minutes ago," Harry said. He stood up and tried to straighten his maroon cloak but Draco kept hold of Harry’s hand and pulled him back down. Harry tried to stand his ground, but Draco let go and he stumbled. Before he could reach the rug on the wood floor, he was naked, and Draco was smirking with wand in hand.
"Why do you think, Harry?  Think about what you know about this world and what you learned about that world through this owl just now.  What did you know to be true in that world?"
Harry rushed through his morning routine and bound down the stairs with still-wet hair.  His mother shook her head when Harry flopped down at the kitchen table.  With a wave of her wand, his black hair was dry and stylishly in place.  A side wooden table was buried beneath a mound of presents.  He didn't care about the number but his eyes searched for the tell-tale package.
Draco's hand this time came out as if to hold Harry back from falling into the scene.  Teddy Lupin was in the Time Room they'd seen earlier, but this time it only contained the clocks.  Long gone were the Time-Turners and the bell jar.  Teddy cast a spell and the room shimmered.  Slowly, ghostly images of what was there before returned.  A smile broke out over Teddy's face when he saw the cage.  He Disapparated.  Harry held his breath, knowing how dangerous it was to Apparate to a place you didn't even know existed or not.
"No, Harry, I haven't.  I will leave that up to you, who else to share this with.  I just ask that you never let Lucius Malfoy know.  He and his wife's sister, Bellatrix, were very close to Voldemort.  Lucius might have a vested interest for attaining more power in the wizarding world, while Bella would do it for love.  Voldemort was her god."
"Harry, you don’t know what you’re saying. It was by accident that the spell worked the way it did. It forced an attraction and feelings."
"This is ace, Potter. I hadn't pegged you for keeping up with the newest fashions in furniture and design."
," Harry said when he found his wand next to the crumbled stone feet of Salazar Slytherin.  He fell back to the ground and screamed as he saw Dumbledore's stiff body nearby.  He crawled over to his Headmaster, not believing that he was truly gone.  He was.  He was still holding his wand.  Harry then saw another body near the entrance wall of the chamber.  Harry caught a glimpse of white hair.  He forced himself up and stumbled down the chamber towards Draco.  Somehow he knew that he was still alive or maybe he was fooling himself thinking that he saw shallow breathing.  Harry landed next to the body and rolled him over.  Draco's eyes opened.  They were soft grey.
"I—I thought if Dumbledore had known that Voldemort was coming that night, that Peter was the traitor, then everything would be as it should have been."
"No, you know I don’t want be Headmistress…at least not this early in my career. Anyway, we know it’s time for a Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw to lead. And after the Unity Spell, I’d put my Galleons on Hufflepuff."
"No! Dammit, Malfoy, I’m not going to listen to you try to seduce me out of this. I don’t know how you did it. How did you find the loophole in the bond?"
Despite the peculiarity of the situation, Harry’s thoughts began to wander again. He sipped his coffee, pretending to pay attention while memories poured forth. The whole public reaction to his and Draco's relationship, instigated by the spell, had caused an explosion of gossip throughout the community. A month later, they’d hoped their drunken decision to marry would cause things to die down, but friends and strangers alike seemed to think it was their business to comment on it almost daily. Ernie and Cho had also received some attention when Ernie moved in with Cho and her Muggle husband, Andrew. The three were counting on a counter-spell to be found.
"Some warning would be nice!" Draco said as he stumbled out of Harry's grasp.  "I suppose this is your home; didn't you think maybe I would like to go to mine?"
Draco turned to face Harry who'd come up to the tree next to him. "That is rubbish, Potter.  If we are going to make a go of this, you need to know that I expect presents.  Lots of them."
"Usually no," Nanna said, "but I'm guessing Albus here has seen this little fowl before, right, Albus?"
Harry almost dropped the tube. Never had Draco even come close to mentioning love and now he was asking Harry to pretend. The atmosphere of the whole room changed suddenly. The fire crackled and lights dimmed before going dark. A large growl of thunder shook the windows.
Draco smiled again.  "Very wise choice, Harry Potter, very wise.  Draco knows what to do.  He's been very faithful these past few months.
"Harry!" Draco said. Shock and what might have been hurt showed on Draco's face. "Listen. Just listen for a moment."
It had been Draco’s first rule when they returned from their honeymoon; Harry wasn’t to touch him before six in the morning. Draco needed at least seven hours of sleep, and while Harry agreed that Draco was a terror without it, it annoyed the hell out of him that Draco had set up this restriction. It made him feel like he was a pervert. It wasn’t like Harry was the only one who was insatiable, after all. It was just that Draco could go a bit longer for some reason. And whatever that reason was, it pissed Harry off.
"Where did you get it?" Harry asked as he untied the ribbon, which was scented.  He took a deep breath, letting the scent fill his nose.  It brought forth a visceral response of pure comfort.  He couldn't place where he'd smelled it before but he knew it was familiar.
Harry refrained from sighing.  Draco continually tried to impress the Potter family.  Harry and everyone else at the table knew that Lucius had bribed his way to join the group negotiating with China and India over rare herbs and spices.
"Sugar quills and fudge coming your way mate," Ron said as he flipped one of the Galleons Harry had given him and then left the room.  They both knew Harry had overpaid Ron, but as long as it wasn't seen as charity, neither said a word.  Ron would spend the extra at the Three Broomsticks buying a round of Butterbeers for all.
Dumbledore didn't smile at Harry's comment.  "No she won't.  She knows better but I'm more worried about you telling a friend."
The corners of Harry's mouth slowly upturned and he nodded.  "Yeah, just not even close to what I expected."
"I think she would like a treat," Dumbledore said and he opened his hand where a few owl treats appeared.  Harry took a couple pieces and offered it to the bird.  She gladly took them and then rubbed his cheek only once with her downy one.
Draco glared at him.  Harry could tell he was trying to control his temper.  "I was not implying anything of the kind, you tosser.  I was going to suggest maybe your bedroom.  You know it's not like we're young kids in Hogwarts.  We're adults and I, for one, would like to be comfortable while we have Christmas Eve sex."
"Walked? What the fuck happened? We had him caught red-handed. I know you must have seen the Pensieve memory we got from Jorgenson. Zabini had a pint and chips with him and offered him five thousand Galleons for Chinese Fireball eggs. Shit, Draco, that’s a Class A Non-Tradable Good. Even the other patrons at the Hog’s Head recognised Zabini."
"Good," she said and leant down and kissed him on the forehead.   They both then glanced over the side of the bed as Merlin was playing with what sounded to be a piece of parchment.  Lily bent down and picked up a scroll tied with a silver ribbon.  "I assume your beau left this for you this morning," she said with a knowing smile.
Harry took a long drink and then set the glass down before it was gone too fast.  "Merry Christmas to you too, Malfoy.  But you can give me a gift."
To his amazement the floor of the birdcage began to swirl.  He hoped it was like a Pensieve but it wasn't.  He viewed a scene from above as if he was a bird.  Below was one scene and unfortunately it was too hazy to see exactly what was going on, but he could make out that it was of him and Draco and they were very young.  It was at Hogwarts and they were running down to the dungeons laughing, holding hands.  They reached the Slytherin Common Room door and then Harry disappeared, a cat was in his place.  Draco picked up the cat and nuzzled into its fur. The scene got even fuzzier and then turned black, but Draco's voice rang out.  "Love you, Harry."
"So good," Harry said repeatedly as his fingers grasped the blond strands fiercely.   Draco's touch and expertise with his tongue and mouth erased all thoughts of a Prophecy, Horcruxes, and a life without family and love.
Harry looked back at the note.  "Teddy, for me to have this note means someone sent a message to this time period.  Maybe you did send an owl after all."
The owl took the notes in her talons and spread her wings.  Teddy opened the door of the cage and she flew away.  Teddy vanished before their eyes as another scene came into view.  Dumbledore was at Hogwarts sitting at the Head Table in the Great Hall.  A small Halloween feast was going on as it was wartime and many of the students were not in the mood for celebrating.  The owl caused everyone to come to a standstill as owls usually showed up at night if there was a death.  A few of the younger students could be heard whimpering.  The owl landed next to Dumbledore, she was green and blue and looking younger than before.  He looked at her with wide-eyes as she released a scroll from talons and a yellow feather.  She stayed standing on the table.
Harry wasn't sure what to do.  Should he just show Draco the scroll or should he Apparate him to the birdcage in the sky?  Harry didn't even know how he felt about it all.  That was his reason for waiting until now to even talk with Draco about it.  Could he get past their past to see if there was a chance at something more?  It was then, as Harry thought about
"Do you think there's a fifth Horcrux?" Harry asked as he continued to softly pet the cat and play with its ears.
"No.  No, I don't regret asking.  I still believe that we have free choice, but, I also believe that certain core things remain constant.  Things like love and honour."
Teddy shook his head as if in shame.  "Originally no, but, then, yes.  I was looking into time-travel and then discovered an old legend about a Tell-Tale Owl; an owl that lived between alternate time lines."
The world calmed down again and everything seemed perfect again.  Harry was off to Hogwarts while his parents, Dumbledore, and Remus and Sirius were off Horcrux hunting.
"Mmm, so why did it take me so long to admit it this time around?  It would have saved a lot of grief between Astoria and me."
For some reason, Harry hadn't expected this.  He pictured them being older, maybe after the war.  But this—this was different.  They were friends as kids.  They were innocent.  He couldn't imagine why that timeline had ended.
"Shit, Draco, you didn't have to be such an arse to her.  I'm going to be working with her all year."
Harry's eyes widened.  It was something he'd longed for in his youth, he hadn't realised that Teddy had felt it so deeply, too.  He reached out and put his hand on Teddy's shoulder.  "I understand, Teddy."
"No!" Dumbledore yelled as murders and Horcruxes made by Voldemort were revealed.  The scenes were not very clear.  Harry could tell that Dumbledore knew that there were seven but also that he didn't know what they all were.
Harry winced as he saw Remus' body covering Sirius and his father holding his mother.  Harry curled up between them and sobbed.  He barely noticed when Fawkes returned and carried him through tunnels and away from the school and over land.  It was only when they reached his doorstep in Godric's Hollow that Fawkes released his hold.  The bird gave a trill and disappeared in a puff of smoke.  The front door opened.
Harry smiled between sips of the bubbleberry tea.  He hoped in the other timeline he got to enjoy bubbleberry tea, too.
"I didn't ask him outright; we just somehow managed to get into a conversation about why Hagrid wasn't allowed to use magic.  And this is between you and me, son.  Severus has been trying to find the Chamber of Secrets.  Just last week he sent a note and he thinks he might have found it but needs help trying to open it."
Harry sighed and petted the cat too roughly.  Merlin raised its paw and batted Harry's hand while hissing.  Harry glared at Merlin until he stood up and hopped off the bed.  Harry reached for his mother's hand and held on to it tightly.  "Mum, please don't go alone."
"Sorry," Draco mumbled as he tried to retrieve the feathers, which had scattered about.  Hedwig hopped off Harry's shoulder and nipped Draco's hand as he reached for them.  She hopped over and picked up the red one with her beak and brought it over to the centre of the floor and set it down.  Draco looked over to Harry.  Harry shook his head.
The Minister began asking Auror Sloper explicitly about his testimony. It was Jack who had received the memory in a bottle, belonging to Marc Jorgenson. Jorgenson was an Auror mole. And it was Jack and Ron who’d searched the Zabini house for the contraband. The questioning was now striking Harry as odd; it had been a few years since he'd seen Kingsley this engaged in an Auror case. He supposed it was because he was friends with Zabini's mother.
Just the way Draco said it, made Harry feel something deep inside.  It was that history again coming through.  "Speak for yourself," Harry replied and then slid down the sheets until his lips covered the tip of Draco's cock.
Teddy laughed.  "No, no, no.  I'm not out in space, though Victoire might disagree.  I'm looking into extinct magical species—oh shit!"
"Thanks....Oh this isn't good," Draco said as the vision switched to Albania and then to the Hogwarts train.
Draco shook his head.  "You're only seeing the good things.  Didn't you see that funeral a moment ago?  That was Rosmerta.  And the papers.  Aren't you reading them?  People are dying, Harry.  People who are alive in this world; this world we live in now."
"Who's that?" Draco asked as they watched a young curly-blond haired man inspect a room Harry recognised as belonging in the Department of Mysteries.  They could hear the cacophony of the ticking clocks which covered most every open space of the room but the case holding Time-Turners.  Harry looked to the far end of the room to see if the bell jar with the hummingbird was there, he was surprised to see something else there sitting next to the jar on the desk.  It was a golden cage with a large nest made of twigs.  There was an owl in it.  It looked ancient and mottled in colours as if a toddler had painted it.
"Minerva!  I must go now; it's the Potters.  Voldemort will be there tonight! Peter has aligned with him and he's the secret keeper."
"Auror Potter, you might want to calm that hair down before going in there," Janet said with a knowing grin. "The Minister’s waiting for you. He wants to address your team, something about the Zabini case."
"Yes, I believe that is true.  But you need to know that is not why the owl was used so I could live.  The owl was sent to me because of you.  I never used it to change timelines, but to help this timeline.  I didn't want you to suffer like you did in the other."
"Zabini walked," Draco said with a smirk. He stepped towards Harry and gave a look of approval at the tie in Harry’s hand.
Draco sighed heavily. He stood up and headed towards the door, mumbling something about Potter not even caring.
Draco turned his head partially back.  "That sounds like a good idea," he whispered.  Harry could feel his breath on his cheek.  He took advantage of the situation and brushed his lips lightly against Draco's.
Harry felt his courage return.  He leaned over Draco, took his chin in his hand and kissed him.  Together they slid down the headboard and further down into the sheets while they continued to snog.  Harry couldn't remember the last time when a kiss lasted so long.  He knew they would soon do more, but for the moment, kissing Draco was enough.  Or he thought it was enough until Draco slid up close to Harry and Harry felt the heat of Draco's body along with the softness of skin and hardness of muscle, and an erection poking into him as if begging for attention.   He obliged and let his hand slide down Draco's side, over his hip, and then wrapped his fingers around Draco's cock and began a slow methodical stroke.  Draco released a delicious moan.
The whole group startled when a crowd of unruly teenagers came in the door yelling for cake and more presents.
"Well obviously it's because we weren't friends in this one," Harry replied and then ducked as Draco tried to swat him.
Harry recognised the pattern; the guess of the fifth was because there must be an item belonging to Godric Gryffindor.
"Oh God," Harry said and frantically undid his own zipper. He lifted his bum up and pulled his trousers down to his booted calves. "Come on, Draco, sit on me," Harry said as his hand ran up and down his own cock. It didn’t diminish as it had that morning.
"No, I think she just wants to do other things now. She’s given so many decades to the school, and now it’s in such wonderful shape with the last of the renovations completed and the students safe. Honestly, I think it would be nice for her to leave on such a high note."
Teddy sobered quickly and Harry surmised that it had to do with the extinct species Teddy had been investigating.  Some type of bird given the feather and drawing of a cage.  "The three Ds I think you can figure out," Teddy said, "and as to the cage, well in for Knut might as well be a Galleon.  It's a place, Harry, and I'd hoped to find a way to change things.  But when I got there, it was empty with only this scroll lying on the bottom."
"Harry, Professor Sinastra is on board and would like to speak to us," she said nervously while twirling a curl of her hair.
"So you did ask him then?" Harry asked which got him an affectionate swat across the head.  "Hey, wait, you said open it.  Does that mean he knows where it is?"
"Yes, it is good.  I have a son.  I have family and some friends.  I feel very lucky.  Love and a companionship would be brilliant but I'm not going to whinge about it."
The Leaky Cauldron was filled to the brim with magical folks from London and afar.  The scent of spiced wine mixed with cherry pipe smoke made Harry admit that it was a good idea to get out of his house tonight.  "Harry!" Seamus Finnigan yelled from behind the bar.  "Merry Christmas!" he added and a glass of warm eggnog was hovered over to him.  Specks of freshly grated nutmeg floated on top while a shot of Ogden's finest rested on the bottom.  It was Harry's favourite holiday drink.
"And look what the Lucius and Narcissa sent Draco two years ago for Christmas when he ran away," Remus added.
Inside, pillars lined the chamber.  They were so high that they reached into a darkened ceiling Harry couldn't even see.  Banging came from the now closed entrance.  Draco was ahead standing before a huge statue.  Harry walked towards him and it was only when he stood nearby Draco that he recognized the giant statue was a carving of Salazar Slytherin.  Draco opened the book again and Harry stood mesmerized as a small light emerged from the pages and entered Draco's chest.  Without warning Draco spun around.  Harry didn't recognise his face.  Gone were the grey stormy eyes he loved to look into when they opened in the morning, instead red slits with emotionless black pupils looked right at him through the Invisibility Cloak. They looked at him with disdain.
"What is it? What's wrong?" Draco asked but he didn't have to wait long for an answer.  Harry pushed him down on the bench seat and pounced on top of him.  It was the first time they'd seen each other for over three weeks.  Draco's parents insisted Draco go on Holiday with them through the European forests, the last message Draco had sent came from Albania two weeks prior.  Draco's book bag opened up spilling its contents.  Draco swore and tried to retrieve it but Harry was quicker and covered Draco's face with kisses.  Draco huffed and pushed Harry off of him; Harry fell to the floor.
"The truth is that Draco Malfoy is alive!" Harry said with a generous smile while he continued rubbing the owl.  The members of the Wizengamot gasped, some fainted, and then, like the Cheshire cat, Harry disappeared with a knowing grin lingering for a moment.
"What are those?" Draco said pointing to the bottom of the cage where five coloured feathers lay.   He bent down to pick them up but stumbled forward.  The cage tilted back and forth.  Draco fell to his knees.
To Harry’s surprise, Kingsley wasn’t saying anything new about the Zabini-Jorgenson case. Ron and a few other Aurors would be giving testimony at the Wizengamot within the hour. Harry knew every detail, and hearing it again made him stifle a yawn. As far as he was concerned it was a nailed-shut case. His mind began to drift to the previous hour's activity. He came back to attention when Kingsley mentioned Draco’s name. Draco, Barrister Malfoy, Harry’s spouse, was representing Blaise Zabini. Sometimes, when a day was slow, Harry would slip down to the basement floors and watch Draco perform his job. He would tingle with both pride and anticipation of what the night would bring if Draco won. Draco usually won. But not today.
Lily, who Harry noticed was standing at the back door with a listening device, rushed into the house with a conjured wooden birdcage and coaxed the owl in before Harry or Dumbledore could argue with her.
"Let's not talk about such times on this day of all days," Nanna said as she poured a shot of something from a vial into her tea.  Harry knew better than to ask what it was.  The answer would involve a herbology or potion's lesson.  He also knew better than to disobey his grandmother's request about discussing the war, despite loving to hear the stories of that time with Voldemort and how at the last minute Dumbledore, who no one knew was outside the house wearing his father's Invisibility Cloak, had killed the evil wizard.  Harry had once heard a rumour that Voldemort had come to the house to kill him but he'd never heard the reason why.  He was determined to ask Dumbledore about it this final year.
Harry looked into the fire, remembering the images revealed once the train steam disappeared.  He was alive and he had a family.  "I lived," he whispered.
Harry shivered again. He could sense that Draco was nearby. With his wand he raised the flame of the fire and had two glasses of brandy poured and set on the sofa's side table. Before the door opened, Harry pulled his Gryffindor tie from his pocket and wrapped it around his wrist. He then put his Invisibility Cloak over him. If Draco wasn’t in the mood, which was likely, then just seeing the tie would change his demeanour. Harry had learned about Draco’s fetish for the tie the first night they'd spent together, which had been at the Hogwart’s celebration of the ten year anniversary. The Prefect’s bathroom had given them the privacy then needed to consummate what the spell had started. He had no idea what Cho and Ernie had done. He grinned, remembering Draco grabbing his hand as they had both run away from the crowd. Draco’s hands had shaken as he'd said the charm to open the door. Once inside, though, Draco had taken charge and they'd both been starkers in the bathtub within moments.
Nanna cackled almost uncontrollably.  "At least —at least Walburga and Orion were inventive.  I mean a toothpick is just —just so mundane."
Harry thinned his lips and shook his head, knowing that Teddy had broken the terms of his profession, but, also, that it wouldn't go anywhere beyond this room.  He would never turn his godson in.  Harry wanted to discuss it more as he'd found over the years that so many mysterious items or occurrences were caused by old magic spells, many Dark, which had long been forgotten.  They weren't taught anymore.  Instead of pursuing the conversation further, though, he turned his attention back to the scroll.  He lifted a letter opener from his desk and sliced open the deep red-waxed seal.  He unrolled the parchment and immediately furrowed his brow as a small blue feather floated out.  Harry caught it without looking.  His attention was focused on the letter.
"Probably another paper-clip," Harry mumbled as a teapot poured the steaming liquid into his cup.  Milk and sugar were added.  He looked around to see who had done it for him.  His grandmother gave him a wink as she glanced around to see what was left to bring over to the table.  The door of the cast-iron stove burst open and pans of white bread landed on the counter and soon thick slices slathered in butter joined the rest of the morning selections.  Harry loved his grandmother's breakfasts.  His parents cooked wonderful meals, but his Nanna Potter's foods were what he missed most when at Hogwarts.  From her mother she'd learned to cook the Muggle way, which she insisted on doing when baking.  She said this method added love.  Harry winked back at her.  As her only grandchild, she duly spoiled him and Harry adored every moment of it.  He noticed her back was getting more bent as the years progressed.  When not gardening in the yard, she could be found in her laboratory leaning over her cauldron brewing up potions and elixirs to be sold throughout the world.
.  The fingers on his right hand hesitantly turned the cover to the first page.  There was a simple drawn picture of a circle and below it two half circles.  Harry had no idea what it meant; he turned the brittle yellow page.  His heart stopped for a moment as he read the spell, read the procedure, read the consequences.  It was all there on one page.  He turned to the next page and the next, all they held was pictures of vessels that the wizard author deemed as worthy to contain a Horcrux.  The vessel had to have significance.
"Arg!  I give up, that's it!" Lily said.  James put his arm around her and patted her shoulder in feigned sympathy.
Dumbledore smiled.  "We don't really know what they do while waiting to be called.  This, though, is an aviary for this Tell-Tale Owl.  It is here, Harry, where sometimes a message can be sent between the two worlds and sometimes you can be blessed with a vision of the possible other world."
Draco laughed and stopped the kiss and put his hand on Harry's stopping the motion.  "I appreciate your confidence in the situation; however, we're not randy teenagers, anymore."
Harry ignored the last part of the statement as a new concern arose in his thoughts. "And attraction?" he asked.
"Very and this is spectacular," Draco said and stopped sipping long enough to reach across the table and clink glasses with Harry.  "Merry Christmas, Potter.  Thank you for my gift.  Sorry I don't have one for you."
Draco shook his head harder and a stifled chuckle sneaked out. "No, Potter, the bond is still strong enough to stop me from harming you, and I wouldn't anyway."
Harry spotted Dumbledore laying dragon snaps near the gravestone that his mother and sister shared.  Harry knew the story from Bathilda but he'd never questioned his Headmaster about his sister's death.  He briefly wondered why Dumbledore, if had seen the owl before, hadn't thought of sending the bird further back in time to the day Ariana died.
Harry shook his head, recognising he’d been defeated as his cock rose with the mention of fucking Draco’s sweet arse. Now it was more than likely he’d be late to work.
"Leave the boy alone, Sirius," Remus said while pouring coffee for his partner and himself.  "He knows that in this household the size of the present doesn't mean anything."
Harry brought the sleeve of his cloak up to cover his eyes.  He didn't want to watch his parents die.  He only uncovered his eyes when he heard the young Draco in the Chamber say in a raspy voice to leave and then opened the wall for him.  He was gutted. Draco had broken through to save him.  It was too much.  He cried with the younger version of himself at the loss of his parents and Sirius and Remus once again.  He also cried for Draco, left behind, who was fully possessed.
"It's okay, mum, we'll figure it out.  But just be glad for now that Voldemort's dead and that we're all here."  Lily nodded.
Draco’s brow quirked. He raised his left hand, showing off a silver snake wrapped around his ring finger. It stuck its forked tongue out at Harry. "Oh, I think we still have a bond."
"Yes, I am worried that you might tell Draco.  I know you trust him, Harry, but it is Lucius that is more of an issue.  I believe he would use any information to his advantage."
"Want you, too," Harry whispered as his fingers began undoing the frogs of Draco’s formal court cloak. Then he reached the white crisp shirt buttons. "How many of these are there?" Harry asked as he fumbled for a minute with the first one.
Dumbledore coughed and then cleared his throat.  From his robe pocket he pulled out a lemon drop and put it in his mouth.  Harry had learned over the years that Dumbledore used hard candy much like his father used his pipe, to calm his nerves and give him a moment to think.
Harry took another sip of wine as a house he'd never seen whole came into view.  He was confused for a moment as he didn't see Dumbledore at first, but only saw Voldemort come into view and enter the house.  He then realised as a flash of green appeared through the window that Dumbledore had the Invisibility Cloak on and couldn't get into the house until Voldemort made his way inside.  Dumbledore didn't have the address.  Draco looked thoroughly confused until the scene showed the inside of the house and Dumbledore removed the cloak.
"Merlin!" Draco said as he looked over the bottle of Bubbleberry wine.  "Potter, this must have cost you a fortune.  Do you know how rare the bubbleberry is?  Wait, you want to drink this now?" Draco asked as he spotted the two glasses.
"I suppose that makes sense. It's true that an Auror lying under oath would be dealt with harshly. Add to that his crimes, and there’s no way a solicitor, even one like you, could get him off, then."
Wide brown eyes stared at him in disbelief. "You’ve given up? But, Harry, you can fight off the Imperius. Just keep trying. I promise I’ll dedicate more time to researching the bond. The answer has to be at Hogwarts, given that's where it happened. And also, think of Cho and Andrew. From the start this has been all wrong, Harry. Love can’t be forced or manufactured."
Harry inspected the seal more closely.  It was like the one he discovered his family had used when going through the Auror archives but none of them had been completely intact.  Most of them had been from his grandmother, Prudence, who he'd never met.  From her notes she seemed a bit quirky yet forceful.  "You know when I was young I saved myself using a Time-Turner.  Is that what’s involved here?"  Harry asked as he guardedly pulled on one end of the silver ribbon.
His grandmother sat down next to him and reached up to move the fringe off of his forehead.  A hint of a scar remained from the incident three days prior.  "Of course you're ready.  This is what happens when people fiddle with timelines.  Strange and horrible situations occur trying to get one world closer to the other... to the way it should be."
"No, not bad at all, Ronald.  Now let's all go back to the garden and have cake.  I do believe it should have arrived by now," Nanna said.
"Okay, okay. I did ask them and neither were any help. Dumbledore just pretended to be asleep and Snape said that I should offer my services."
"Sure, but it doesn't go past this room," Harry said and then looked briefly up at Teddy and gave him a wink.  Teddy had more to lose than Harry did if the conversation was known by others.  But then Harry knew that at least one other person might need to be told.  He handed the paper to Teddy.  His fingers absent-mindedly played with the silver ribbon and he brought it back up to his nose, inhaling its scent.
Teddy was in the cage and there was the Tell-Tale Owl sitting on her perch.  She turned her face 180 degrees and then back again.  "Your feathers look like my hair gone wrong, but you're a beauty," Teddy said with smile.  The owl's tri-colours of blue, green, and yellow feathers were striking.  He reached into his pocket and pulled out a few owl treats.  The owl hooted and fluttered her wings and gladly took the offering.
