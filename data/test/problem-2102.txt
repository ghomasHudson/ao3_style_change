"Ya well, it took a long time for things to get better for me. Even after Voldemort was gone, I just felt like I should have been dead. So many people died, and I was supposed to die, but I didn't." Harry realizes after he says it that Draco probably has not idea what he means by 'I was supposed to die' but he doesn't ask, which is a good thing because he wasn't sure if he could get through that whole story right now.
and I became very close friends. Everyone thought we were dating, even my parents. Then we started to. It was a way to hide it from my parents, even though they didn't like her it was better than the truth. When Astoria started to bring up the topic of marriage, I finally told her, but it didn't persuade her from the idea. See, she knew she didn't have much time with her blood curse. She loved me, and I deeply cared for her, and that was enough for her. I made her happy and she liked the security. She wanted to start a family before she got too sick and I was willing to give her that. When Scorpius was very young, we both had other lovers, but as she got sicker and Scorpius got older, it was only I who was still bringing men home. There wasn't going to be secrets or lies in our house, I had had enough of that growing up. So we told him I was gay when he was older enough to understand. He took it well, but it probably still pushed Scorpius away from me a bit."
"Enough!" Lily finally yelled over her brothers, "I can't take this anymore!" Lily still wasn't happy with her dad for keeping such a big secret from them that he was gay, but she couldn't stand the way her brothers were acting. "Why are you two so angry with mom and dad being happy!?" she said looked back and froth between the two brothers on either side of her. Although she was the youngest, she was usually the voice of reason.
"James!" Harry scolded, "Draco is not a Deatheater anymore, and he never wanted to be. What is wrong with you, James? You never had a problem with him or his son being friends with our family before." After he said it, Harry immediately realized he had been too stern.
"Ya, ok." Harry said, looking back at Draco but stepping up to follow Neville to a different table. "What's up, Neville?"
"Oh really," Draco said as Harry gestured to Draco to move towards the living room. "Then what was it?" He asks, plopping himself on the couch, easily making himself at home.
"Blimey Harry! And ya didn't tell anyone?" Bill didn't seen mad, in fact he was laughing to himself a bit.
Time passed quickly, and sooner than they thought, Professor McGonagall came back in saying it was time to head back to their dormitory. The kids left with a wave and smiles, leaving Harry and Minvera alone.
"Good. You know, I'm still not sure how it's all gonna go over or what everyone is going to believe but at least I've said the truth. As much as I didn't want some of that to get out..." Draco could tell by the way Harry said it he was talking about the mental health issues, not their relationship, "at least I don't have to worry about it coming out anymore. It's out there now and there was nothing I could do about that."
James, Lily and Albus learned to ignore all the stuff around their father. They knew he was perfectly fine, or so they had thought. What their father had told them had surprised them all. Harry really had done a great job hiding it from his kids. James was the only one who could remember his father showing any sign of his troubles. When James was young, he used to like to sneak into his parents bed at night. His father would mumble in his sleep and sometimes wake screaming into the night. After Harry had woken up from a nightmare to see little James looking up at him for the second time, he told James he couldn't sleep in Mommy and Daddy's bed anymore.
The two roll onto the bed, fully naked, kissing and touching. Harry had never felt so good in his life. He never knew that this is what it was supposed to feel like. He felt more alive than he did on a broom.
"He was there. When I wasn't. It's not your fault; it's mine. You just wanted to be loved, and you deserve to be loved."
"We know." James said without looking his father in the eyes. He couldn't bare to. He didn't mind throwing Albus under the bus because he was pissed about how he told him and his sister. How he didn't tell them right away. How he yelled it to them in the hallway. But James was even more pissed at his father for the lies and secrets that how seemed to be never-ending with him. James thought he knew his father, he was slowly realizing how wrong he was.
"Let's not let this tear us all apart." Luna said, "Ginny, do you think we can all still be friends, be family? Harry was family to you guys long before you two were married, right? Can we all still get along? I know it will be a bit weird, but let's not turn against Harry." said Luna. She was trying to be kind to Ginny and didn't want to lose her or Harry as friends or now, family. She loved them both and was really hoping that sides weren't forming.
They headed up to the Shrieking Shack, and Harry told Draco about going in it his third year. Draco continued to be amazed at the true versions of everything Harry did at school. Every year there was always rumors, but usually the only people who learned the truth from Harry was Ron, Hermione, and Dumbledore. It felt weird for Harry to share it with someone else after all these years. Of course he had been approached many times to write books about his life, but even the rare time he would comment, he never went into detail with any of the stories. Sharing them all with Draco was nice. They could laugh about the silly parts, and Harry could cry about the sad parts and Draco was there for him. Harry had never been this vulnerable with anyone in this way before.
Harry pulled back and looked at the man he loves, but now in a completely different way. When he looked at Draco, he saw his own selfishness. "I have to go. I need to speak to Ginny. We're gonna have to tell James and Lily now."
In Brazil, they found a snake that spoke to Harry, asking him about his scar. The young boa constrictor said his father told him a story about how a young boy with a lighting-shaped scar could speak to him and freed him from the zoo in which he was born. The snake knew from the moment that Harry spoke back, he had found that boy. The snake grew quite found of Harry and Draco and decided to stay with them, becoming their pet. The snake was named Slytherin of his own choosing after hearing it in stories about Hogwarts.
Then Molly came bustling out of the kitchen, "Oh you came dear!" Molly said kissing and hugging her eldest son. "I'm so glad you could make it." she said, hugging Fleur.
Harry didn't remember anything between that and feeling like he came out of some sort of trance in hospital wing. Hermione and Ron, were sitting on the bed, trying to talk to him. Their voices slowly became clearer,
From not far away, Scorpius pipes up, "Aren't you come back to our place?" he asked. Harry was frozen for a second and looked to Draco who was blushing hard but said nothing as his son continued, "You were staying there weren't you?"
He came early and he stopped at Hagrid's on his way up to the castle. They had a cup of tea and talked. Hagrid of course had heard about Harry's press conference and was very proud of him for standing up for who he is. Harry filled him on what was happening with the kids, and also since Hagrid asked, how things were going with Draco.
Ginny sat down at the table next to her mother. She noticed the newspaper, "Ugh! I can't believe the papers got it already. Someone in the Ministry must have leaked it. Don't read the crap that woman writes, mum."
After the lunch they shared, Harry and Draco started writing letters back and forth. They would talk about their days, Harry's full of boring paperwork and Draco trying to make his days of leisure sound enjoyable. Even though they were never about much, Harry always felt happy when he saw Draco's snowy owl with another letter for him. Sometimes Draco would stop by for lunch, always saying that he "had to come to the Ministry anyway," but Harry stopped believing that. He knew Draco came to come see him and to get out of the house.
Harry chuckled a bit, paused and then said, "Did you know... that Dumbledore too was..." for some reason he wasn't quite sure, Harry was having a hard time saying it a loud.
"I didn't feel like he loved me anymore. I couldn't take it anymore, I felt so alone. I just wanted to forget about it for a while. I meant it, we really did get divorced because we just don't love each other anymore."
"You can't blame yourself for this, Harry. You had your reasons for not telling the kids. Hell, I don't know how I would if it were me." Ron said putting a supportive hand on his friend's shoulder.
A few days after the kids went back to school, Ginny and Harry sat in a small office at the Ministry of Magic. There wasn't much to do since it was an amicable split and they each had their own incomes. After just a few short hours, a parchment, quill, and ink was laid in front of them. Ginny signed first, followed by Harry, marking the end of their marriage.
It wasn't a question, Harry was sleeping here tonight. He followed suit and striped and put on the shirt Draco had given him. When his head popped out of the neck hole, he saw Draco was already getting into the bed.
"No, actually," Harry said, standing to grab the dishes, "That wasn't even why." Harry grabbed Draco's plate as well and put them both in the sink.
So Harry decided he better go out to buy food, even if Malfoy wasn't coming, he had nothing in the house. By 6 o'clock Harry had started cooking, just in case Draco was coming, but with Kreacher having passed years ago and no Ginny, he made quite the mess. Knives missing their mark and flying into walls, trash landing a foot away from the garbage, and spoons stirring so fast they were spraying stuff everywhere. One of the pots started to smoke profusely, and Harry had to open a window to clear the air.
"Harry, Ginny didn't really want me to tell you quite yet, but I need to." He took a deep breath, and continued. Harry couldn't help thinking about how much braver Neville had become over the years. "Ginny and I have been seeing each other. And I want you to know, and I want it to be alright with you, because you're my friend, Harry."
If you're worried about me, don't be. I'm happier than I actually know how to say. I'm getting better. Less angry, more alive. Less afraid, more content. I don't think I hate myself anymore...at least, not much. I don't like all of where I've been, or some of the things I've done...but I know they aren't who I am, or then beginning and end of me. I expect to get this journal back when you're done picking my head apart to make sure I'm well. I'll probably burn it on the spot to say goodbye to what I've let go of here. Just a hint: sooner would be better, I've got a life to go have, for fuck's sake!
“John…you’re a good friend. I think there are a few things I need to say right now, while I feel lucid. It’s kind of you to say those things, and I know you believe them or I wouldn’t even have heard them, but there are issues…things you need to understand before you make assurances like those.
An incredibly slender waist, and hipbones that created an enviable V that Harry couldn’t stare at long enough. A tight, smooth stomach and nipples that came to tiny points. Shoulders that were broad despite the rest of his body’s lithe frame. All perfect.
“Hmmph! Your first problem is that you still think of this as some form of arcane punishment! My part in this isn’t to punish you, or even directly help you. The idea is to help you help yourself. That’s why it’s called counseling instead of helping! Would you like something to drink? Juice, tea, water?”
I laugh a sad, desperate laugh. A tortured and grief stricken laugh with layers to decipher. “Of all the people to…Potter…why you? It shouldn’t be, but it is. You can’t help me with what hurts me, and you don’t even see why. I can‘t even say which hurts more.”
"You don't need to explain anything! You're with Mr. Malfoy!" Albus yelled angrily, then quieter he said, "You're.... gay."
But Harry was starting to feel very alone again, feeling separated from everyone besides Ron and Hermione. He still hadn't told anyone else he was gay, not even the Weasleys. He hadn't seen Molly since the divorce. She even invited him over one night, probably to yell at him, maybe not, but Harry didn't want to take that chance, so he put it off, telling her he had to work late that night.
He wasn't sure why he told Draco anyways, "When I was pretending to act dead, your mother was the one Voldemort sent to check if I was still alive. She knew I was alive, but she told Voldemort I wasn't."
Meanwhile, Ginny ended up becoming Head of Magical Games. She had moved to the department following Harry's retirement from the ministry since she was so fed up with The Prophet after everything it published about her ex-husband.
"It hasn't. We met up a while ago by chance. We were just friends. We'd grab lunch occasionally." Harry felt weird telling them about the near-daily letters they wrote, looking back it seemed more than just friendly. "Then the day the kids went back, he came for dinner. We were talking about the conversation Ginny and I had with the kids at the beginning of the holiday." Ron and Hermione already knew about what Harry and Ginny had told the kids about (supposedly) why they divorced.
All of this was very confusing to Harry. Were they not mad at him? They had to be though. Harry was a father now, and if someone broke his daughter's heart he was be very upset. But it was also different with him and the Weasleys; they were like his family since he was 11, and he really didn't want to lose them. He was preying to himself that they were all going to forgive him once they knew the whole truth of what Harry put Ginny through.
"I know, I know. I should have lost hope when you two got married. And if she's not married to you and still doesn't want to be with me, then it's definitely time." Hearing that from Harry, that Ginny really didn't have any feelings for him left, helped him cut the last string of hope.
"That's what I wanted to tell you. I found out how Rita Seeker found out. When the article came out, I went straight to her office. Told her to tell me how she knew or I would tell the minister she's still an unregistered animagus. At first she tried to lied, but I eventually got her to tell me, and I know its true because I used Veritaserum," Harry didn't even bother to ask how Hermione got that. Smart Hermione probably kept some brewed for special occasions. None of them had really stopped being vigil after the war ended; they were always prepared for the worse. "She told me she used her old tricks again, using her beetle form, to spy on you. She was trying to get dirt on the divorce still. I assumed she must have been listening in on you and Ginny telling the kids."
Draco hadn't really spoken to Harry since that day in Hogsmeade. He had the feeling Harry was ignoring him, and he knew it had to be about the kids. Harry had just confessed his love for Draco; there was no other explanation why he would suddenly stop talking to him. Draco loved Harry back, he understood what Harry must be going through, but he couldn't bare to lose him.   Other than his son, Harry was the best thing in Draco's life, but he was worried if he pushed, it would only push Harry away, so he had only written to Harry once and didn't argue when he said he was busy.
"You know what's going on, don't you!" James said sounding even more annoyed. He couldn't understand why his brother was being such an ass and keeping this from them.
Harry went right home to what was now Ginny's house. He hadn't even told Ginny he was seeing anyone and now he was going to have to tell her everything. At least he knew now that she had moved on too, that made it a lot easier. Harry cared more about Ginny being happy than himself. He still blamed himself for all the years she lost with him when she could have been with someone who really loved her.
"Not your fault," Draco said to Harry's surprise, "They would have locked him away with or without your help. After the Dark Lord fell, it was inevitable. I'm still surprised mother got off and I didn't even have to go to trial."
"As for having once attempted to take my life, I won't deny it. A lot happened that night when he summoned me to the forest that I have never spoken about and will not be speaking about today. I'll just say that I should have died that day. It was by some miracle that I did not."
"WHY WON'T YOU TELL US?!!?" James yelled now into the empty hallway at his brother. "WHAT'S GOING ON?!?"
After a long moment of silence to let that sink in, Harry said to his kids, "This is not your fault at all, I really hope none of you think that. And me and your mom don't hate each other, we just don't... feel the same way we used to." Harry was not ready to come out to his kids, and Ginny agreed it was best not to put too much on them at once.
All was well once more till the day Harry Potter died a natural death, over a hundred years old, surrounded by his children, his two best friends, and his husband.
ago. It's all my fault." Hermione had never told on Rita because in some ways it was better to hold leverage over her then to tell and see what the ministry did about it, but if she was back up to her old tricks, she needed to be stopped for good.
"Dean." Ginny confirmed Harry's suspicions. Harry always thought that Dean never got over Ginny; Dean hadn't been in a serious relationship since he with with Ginny in school, and he was currently very single. But the way Ginny described it, he hadn't done anything wrong.
It had been a few weeks since Harry and Ginny had their talk and they both didn't see any point in putting off the divorce or telling the kids any longer. Ginny had told her parents the same day Harry had talked to Ron and Hermione.
Harry looked at Draco and Draco back at him. Then Harry leaned over and kissed him, long and hard. The men wrapped their arms around each other: Harry's hands on Draco's neck, Draco's fingers running through Harry's messy hair.
"Hello, dear." said Mrs. Weasley walking towards Harry. She smiled, but didn't give Harry his usually hug greeting. Mrs. Weasley was very conflicted inside. She loved Harry like her own son, but Harry had hurt her real daughter, her only daughter.
"Well I'm pretty happy how it worked out in the end." Harry said smiling at Draco, which cheered him up. "Plus I very much enjoyed tricking you from under my invisibility cloak."
But he can't take any of it back now, "Al, I'm sorry. Please, lets talk." Harry pleaded with his son.
Harry finally lifted his head to look at his children, "You guys don't really see it, but it puts a lot of strain on our relationship." which was true. Harry and Ginny had struggled for years with Harry waking up most nights with nightmares, Harry having days when he could barley get himself out of bed, and occasionally having flashbacks triggered or thinking he saw Voldemort on a corner or down an alley.
"Enough!" Said Ginny and the kids all quieted. "James you are staying in Albus's room and your father will be staying in your room. End of story." Ginny sounded more and more like her mother as she got older.
"And if they do Harry, we'll be fine. We have more than enough saved up for you not to work. That's never why you worked, you worked because you loved your job. But you don't seem to anymore."
"It's alright, don't worry about it." Scorpius smiled at him. Albus smiled back, and just like that he had his best friend back. He needed him right now. As much as he felt closer to his siblings after last night, they were in still in Gryffindor, and Albus felt alone in Slytherin, so he was happy to have his friend to talk to again.
The next afternoon, the day Albus told James and Lily that their father was gay, the two Gryffindors were sitting in the corner of their common room quietly talking about it. In fact, they had been talking about it since Albus told them that morning. They had tried to get more out of him after his outburst, but he ran down to the dungeons and locked himself in the Slytherin common room the rest of the day so they couldn't get to him.
"Oh Harry! We wanted to peak in on you before but we couldn't even get through!" Molly rushed over fussing, "But I knew you had Ron and Hermione and Ginny there. You did so well dear, spoke very clearly, told your truth." She looks from Harry to Draco standing behind him, "Come here, you too dear." Draco comes forward, Molly Weasley had almost never spoken to him. "I was a bit worried about this when I first heard," Molly glanced between Harry and Draco. Ginny told her parents prior to the press conference, with Harry's permission, that it was true he was dating Draco, but Harry hadn't spoken to them himself and he didn't know how Mrs. or Mr. Weasley felt about it. "But I can see you two have something special here." Molly smiled at Harry and Draco. Harry breathed a sigh of relief.
Unbenonced to Harry, Draco gave a small nod to Minvera, and Minvera nodded back. Then Draco rose, standing next to Harry. "The same year I..." Draco started to speak, everyone else looked as if this was proceeding as plan, but Harry had no idea what was about to come out of Draco's mouth, "...will be filling the Charms position as Professor Filtwick will, alas, be retiring."
Draco started to realize was Harry was saying. His eyes widen in shock. He wasn't prepared for this now, here. But he would have it no other way. Surprisingly, he didn't feel the need for some crazy big proposal. He loved Harry and hearing from him talk about how he feels about him on a beautiful day with their beautiful family, was the most prefect way Draco could imagine this to happen.
After Harry left Hogwarts from telling the kids, he headed to Hermione and Ron's. He wanted to go to Draco; Harry loves him but now he's worried he might have to leave Draco to make his kids happy. They had to come first. Why should he be happy if the price is making his kids miserable? Harry needed to talk to his best friends.
"Hey, Potter!" someone from down the Slytherin table called, "Have you seen– your dad's in the paper again!" he snickered holding up the morning's edition of the Daily Prophet.
But his siblings ignored his tone for now. "He says he needs to speak with all of us." James said, "Him and mom, they are both coming to the castle tonight."
Neville took a deep breath to settle himself and then said to his audience, "I have something I would like to ask you all."
When Draco popped out in the Ministry, there was a wall of people between him and Harry who he could see on a platform near the fountain. He could hear reporters yelling out questions, it seemed like Harry was done saying his piece and now he was going to take questions. Draco pushed through the crowd yelling, "Move, scum!"
Ginny finally spoke up, "You all must be upset. Your father and I were just trying to do what's best for you. We didn't want you to have to deal with this right after the divorce."
"Of course, dear boy." Despite both being adults for quite some time, sometimes they both reverted back to acting as if Harry was still a student.
Then Harry and Albus went back to their old home and spent some time with Ginny, James, and Lily; Neville was also there. This is when Harry told them all about taking the Defense Against the Dark Arts job. Neville was very excited to have his friend teaching at Hogwarts with him. The kids however, as predicted, were a little apprehensive. Professor Longbottom was becoming apart of their family, and now their dad was going to be a professor too. James, however, was upset that he would never get to be in one of his dad's lessons since he was going into his seventh year and Harry wasn't going to be taking up the position until the next year. Lily and Albus we're upset, but rightfully cautious about having their dad around school. Albus got excited though when he realized that he dad would be there just in time for his owl year, and surely he would prepare him well. Lily was going to have to have him for the longest, but she was also the least troublemaker in the family, so she didn't have as much to fear.
"But we aren't happy together, Dean. It's good that we are finally doing this." Harry was uncertain about the future but he wanted to be able to love freely, and more importantly, he wanted Ginny to be truly loved.
"Why did you have to bring us home this weekend? I had plans to go the Hogsmeade with my friends." James asked his father in an annoyed tone. James, Al and Lily were all wondering the same thing - why did their parents have them sent home for the weekend?  They were all confused and slightly scared, even James, though he was trying the most out of the three to hide it.
"Percy and Bill and Charlie and their wives are all coming home for a big family dinner tomorrow, just us Weasleys." George said to Ginny trying to lighten the mood a bit.
Molly didn't want to hurt her daughter anymore than she had been, "Ok Ginny, it's alright. You don't have to say anything more." She silently eyed George telling him that that was enough.
She felt bad for Harry. She knew exactly what he was talking about and why it was so urgent. She wrote back immediately:
"Oh go on mom! We all gave our blessing!" James yelled over the table to her. Her three children were smiling and nodding at her.
Their arms wrap around each other, holding each other close. The men's lips don't part when Draco pushes Harry into the couch. It isn't long before Draco reaches for the tie and buttons on Harry's shirt. As they make their way to the bed, clothes are thrown in all directions.
Aberforth looks from Harry to Draco, "I see." he says and then pauses, but he doesn't turn to leave, "My brother was gay too, you know."
"You are?!" said Ron quite surprised. Draco noticed Harry looked like he hadn't known either but it didn't bother him in the slightest.
Dean looked sadden by this, "Harry, I never meant to mess everything up with you guys. Don't leave her over one drunk night flirting with a stupid ex."
In the United States, they met up with American wizards, which was the first non-european wizards either Harry or Draco had met. They took a tour of Ilvermorny and were quite impressed even though neither would admit it, constantly whispering to each other how Hogwarts was far superior.
Then he felt two arms wrap around him and heard Molly's voice, "Shh... its ok dearie. It's alright." Molly held him tight and rocked him a bit, "We understand and we are fine with you being gay. Just a bit of a shock that's all." Harry looked up to see Arthur nodding to him in agreement with Molly's words.
This shocked both of his siblings into silence. Albus felt bad he had blurted it out, but it had been bottling up inside him for the last day, and he couldn't contain it anymore.
"No. You deserve to be happy too. I don't think we really have a choice." They both understood when Ginny meant. They needed to divorce.
Afterwards, he leisurely walked around Diagon Alley, which he hadn't done in quite a long time, in fact he couldn't remember that last time he'd done it besides when he stayed in The Leaky Cauldron prior to third year at Hogwarts.  When he saw the sign for the bar/motel, he decided to head in for a drink.
"I saw you dad!" Albus yelled. He couldn't believe his father just tried to lie to him. Again. He thought they made a connection and now it turns out there were so many things his father was hiding from him and lying about. He could barley stand to look at his dad.
Draco looked around again, now everyone was smiling at him, except Granger. She just wore a blank expression. Then, "I'm glad to two nit-wits found each other!" George shouted over the table. "To Harry and Draco!" he said raising a glass.
Now she had to tell them something. She knew they all wanted to know, but she couldn't tell them Harry's secret. "We just don't love each other anymore..."
"He told me at the beginning of the school year, we waited a few weeks before telling you guys we were getting divorced." Ginny said, determined to have everything out in the open.
Then he looked up again, this time at his other two kids who were by their mother, "I love you all so much." he said and James and Lily joined him in a group hug. He kissed the top of their heads, even though James was nearly his height now.
"But all of that was nearly 25 year ago now, and I have not considered suicide since." That wasn't completely true, Harry had thought about it again, but he never planned on trying it again after that day.
"Oh baby, it's ok. You can tell us. Get it out. We won't do anything irrational to Harry. We just want to help you."
to do. Whatever I fancy that day. Taking long strolls in the garden. Visiting mother. Reading, sometimes."
headline as he pasted the stands. But out of the corner of his eye, he caught his name. When he read the front page, he knew he would have to buy a paper today.
"Keep your voice down, Malfoy. Muggles aren't used to hearing the word "muggle" yelled in the streets; its bad enough you're in robes." Harry sighed, "We're here becuase I know a great place up this way."
Albus was pissed, he thought his father was actually going to give some explanation when he told him to wait, but no, just "don't tell James and Lily." Albus snorted. His father was just protecting his own ass; never caring about him, the family, his mother. His father was selfish. Albus hated Harry: hated him for being gay, for breaking up their family, for dating his best friend's dad.
Now Harry was surprised. He wanted that to be true, but then again he didn't. Earlier today he had just yelled at and accused Draco.
Those three kids were always the odd ones out– being the children of 'the chosen one,' the famous Harry Potter. Only each other knew how it felt, and now more than ever they were the only ones who understood what each other was going through.
Albus was relieved to hear that. At least he wasn't the only one surprised today, "I can't believe them! What makes them think they can do that! We're best friends, that's not right!" Albus was so angry about his father dating his best friend's dad, maybe even more so than the fact that he was gay and hid it from him.
"I've made so many mistakes" Harry said burying his head in his hands. "This," Harry said shaking the paper, "is my fault. If I had just told them all sooner, Albus wouldn't have been yelling it in the hallways."
As Harry led the way to the Hogs Head, Draco said, "Wish we had your invisibility cloak now, Potter."
"WHAT'S GOING ON IS THAT DAD IS GAY! AND HE'S DATING MR. MALFOY!" Albus just blurted out before he could stop himself, "Mom and dad both lied to us, that's why they got divorced!!"
Scorpius was also excited to change his name to Potter and officially become one of the Potter children. Harry, of course, treated him as his own son, and Draco did the same with Al, James, and Lily. Neville also became a like a father to all of the children.
After that all the kids when back to the Malfoy's with Harry and Ginny and Neville got some time to themselves. Even though they were seeing each other for months, they hadn't got to spend a lot of time together while Neville was teaching. So Draco and Harry, who would soon have an entire year to themselves, took the kids for a week.
"No! No, Ron!" Harry said defensively. "I could never think of you that way. You're my best mate. Just because I'm attracted to men doesn't mean I like all guys!"
The man looked up at him. "Potter! What are you doing here?" Draco asked without the sarcastic tone Harry was used to hearing from his Hogwarts days.
Right before the school year started again, Harry and Draco had a small wedding ceremony on the grounds. Only about 30 people were there, including all the Weasleys and Narcissa and Harry and Draco's other close friends and family like Blaze and Goyle (who were quite surprised to find out Draco was gay but did not seem to take issue with it).
Harry also giggled, "That's true." Harry had told Draco, the first person since Ron and Hermione, exactly what happened in the forest that May 2nd in 1998. They were the only four people, with Harry included, who knew how close Harry really got to death that night. But he finally had gotten to the point where he could joke about it.
This was how sex was supposed to be: fun, enjoyable, freeing. Harry was used to thinking and stressing during sex, but now his mind was consumed with one thought: Draco.
"Delicious as always... Molly." Harry said awkwardly. Sometimes Harry would call Molly "mum" but that didn't feel appropriate right now. Mrs. Weasley didn't seem to take notice what Harry had called her.
Harry felt like it owed it to Ginny to explain everything to her. "I've never cheated, Ginny. And I didn't always know. I never really paid attention who I liked during school; I didn't have much time to. I thought I liked Cho for a bit, but looking back I think it was just a mix of her liking me, me thinking I was straight, and her understanding my grief about Cedric."
He tied it to his son's owl's leg and with a little hoot it was off back through the bedroom and out the window. This must have woken Draco because Harry started to hear a stir from his bedroom.
Harry actually felt relieved. Ginny was happy. And Neville was a great guy, a great friend, and he had never found anyone. Neville looked at Harry nervously, as if he was afraid Harry was going to say he hated that or that they couldn't be friends anymore. Harry smiled at him and he relaxed. "I'm really happy for you guys, I mean it."
"Oh, thank goodness. I was worried you wouldn't like it. No hard feelings, right Harry?" This is why Neville must have been acting weird when he visited Hogwarts, Harry realized.
in each other." Harry knew what she meant but he wouldn't admit it to her. "Look at Granger and Weasley. Those two were the same in many ways and look at them now."
Harry was surprised how well the Weasleys had taken it. Not just him being gay, but forgiving him for everything that happened with Ginny. Harry could tell they still weren't happy about the divorce, especially with the kids, but they didn't seem to blame him anymore. Harry felt like they should blame him though, after keeping it from Ginny all those years. Even though he didn't have it completely figured out, he should have been honest with Ginny how he was feeling.
After Ron yelled for a good 15 minutes, he seemed to be finally calming down. "You're right, Ron, you're right." Harry started, sitting down in the chair in Ron and Hermione's living room.
"Well I don't have many friends." said Harry, opening up, trying to level with Draco. "Besides Hermione and Ron of course, but they're married so it's different now, you know? And not being married to Ginny anymore, I go home to an empty house too."
"I don't know." As much as Draco was comforting to Harry, he felt guilty confiding in him about all this because this relationship was exactly what his son was mad about at this very moment. "Maybe tomorrow." He said giving Draco a forced smile after seeing the sad look on his face.
Lily wanted to cry, but she also wanted to be strong like her brothers. She loved her parents so much and now they wouldn't be together anymore. She couldn't stand the idea; she wished she was having a nightmare, but she knew it was real.
Draco's heart did a somersault when he heard this. He had realized he had a thing for Harry Potter a long time ago, but he had also accepted that it was never happening. When he heard of Harry's divorce he had the tightest bit of hope, but still logically he thought, never, ever, would Harry Potter be into him or any man.
"Neither did I." Harry said shaking his head, "With the things we went through as kids, it felt like I had lived my whole life by the time I turned 18."
"Will you give it a chance, Malfoy?" says Harry and they catch each other's glaze before Malfoy looks down at the menu.
Harry couldn't even process what he just read, his mind still not fully in the present. He had been slandered more times than he could count at this point, but this... this was true. Most of it at least. Harry, of course, had never used
Harry, James, Albus, Lily, and Neville all returned to the party shortly after; just in time for dinner. Everyone was talking and laughing, even Draco had slowly learned to relax around the Weasleys and was smiling as he chatted with George - the two seemed to have a budding kinship. When everyone was done eating and the table had been cleared, Neville stood up and quieted the table.
This surprised all three of them. Albus didn't want to ask. James did, but after his outburst his couldn't bring himself to, so it was Lily who asked, "Who?"
Harry continued, "And for some reason, I don't know why, I told him. I really trusted him. He opened up to me too, and then I told him I was gay." As Harry relived this, he realized maybe he made a mistake. If Draco had been the one to tell Rita Seeker, why didn't he also tell Seeker he was gay? Surely that would have made an even better story. And why would Draco have told him about his own struggles? And why would he have... "Then he kissed me, and suddenly left in a hurry." But surely thats why he rushed away, to go tell Rita the story. It had to be Draco.
His siblings followed him out the door and a bit down the hallway, "Albus? What's wrong?" Lily asked, seeming concerned.
Harry only heard snippets  "Harry" "ring" "just proposed" "Draco" as Draco grabbed the ring and put it on his own finger. He kissed Harry and then started showing everyone around him, talking about it was the most beautiful ring he had ever seen. Harry smiled to himself, watching the man he loved. Everything seemed to be quiet and all he heard or saw was Draco. He loved him so much. Then he was shaken from his trance as Ron and Hermione tapped him to get his attention.
"Ya, it belonged to my father, the only thing of his I own. Dumbledore gave it to me for Christmas first year." Harry told Draco as they walked through the town. They acted like children that trip: buying all the sweets in Honeydukes, checking out all the new prank stuff at Zonkos. Harry even bought a few things at Zonkos using the excuse that it was to show Ron and George what their competition was up to.
"Can't believe you didn't tell me you were dating Malfoy, Harry!" George said putting his arm around Draco's shoulders.
Draco didn't know what to do with himself. He never had people like the Weasleys fussing over him with admiration and love. He had been so mean to the younger Weasleys. His father had been mean to Mr. Weasley. But here they were, accepting him without question. He couldn't believe it.
Harry thought about Albus' reaction and knew Ginny was right. "Alright then," Harry said standing up, "I'll write to Minerva."
"We told them it was because of my PTSD and depression." This is one of the few times Harry had said those words aloud, and with Draco is was surprisingly easy.
The only people who ever knew about his attempt to take his own life were Hermione, Ron, Ginny, Molly, Arthur, and Minerva. He couldn't stop his mind from slipping back to that day...
"Harry, I know why you want to talk." Dean's started right away. Harry had written him a letter asking to speak, and later that evening Dean's head appeared in his fireplace. "I'm sorry. I should have stopped it right away. I didn't want to leave her there though. I was worried she might stitch herself if she tried to apparate home. Nothing really happened, but everything that did is all on me."
Harry woke up to a tapping sound. At first he got distracted by the beautiful man still sleeping peacefully next to him, but the tapping continued up he looked up to the window to his his eldest son's owl. He got up and opened the window and let the owl in. He untied the note from it's leg and read:
Harry quickly explained to them how they had already been engaged before other people started coming over trying to get in their hugs and 'congratulations.' Molly came over once she was done with Ginny to grab Harry's face and then hug him, then she grabbed Draco into a big hug before insisting on a photo, gesturing to Arthur with a camera. "Molly wouldn't let me use the muggle camera. She said you'll all want moving pictures to remember this time." Arthur said before giving Harry and then Draco a hug. Then he snapped a photo of the two of them, Draco proudly showing his ring.
Ginny was very relieved that Harry seem genuinely happy about her dating Neville, but she was also a bit upset that Neville told Harry first. She wanted to be the one to tell her ex-husband and the father of her children.
"Ya, I was never too happy about that. I didn't go home from Hogwarts because I didn't have a good home to go to. I actually found it a bit insulting at first when Albus told us he was staying. But, in the end I get it. Hogwarts is fun over the holidays. Plus I don't think those boys want to be apart."
"We need to talk, Potter." Draco said seriously, strongly masking how painful this was for him from his voice. He was very good at that.
Before Draco had even finished that sentence, Harry spit his drink across the bar. "What?" Malfoy asked. Harry dabbed his mouth with his sleeve and looked up at him.
"Well, I doubt anything will happen now." Harry told them, "I yelled at him, told him we were done. I don't know if he'll forgive me." he said sadly, looking back down to the ground.
Nearly everyone Harry loved was standing around him in the Weasleys' backyard: Draco, the kids (including Rose, Hugo, and Scorpius), Ginny and Neville, George and (a now pregnant) Luna, Arthur and Molly, Minerva, Hagrid, Teddy, and Ron and Hermione. Everyone was talking, laughing, drinking, smiling: it was Harry's birthday. Harry looked around at the family he had gained over the years since coming into the wizarding world and smiled. He only wished he hadn't lost so many people on the journey here.
After they were done cleaning up, Draco found Hermione talking to Ron off to the side. He took a deep breath and walked up to her, "Could I speak to you for a moment alone, Granger?"
Harry felt like he should have predicted this was coming, he was so worried about coming out to Ron and Hermione, he forgot how mad they might be about the divorce. He deserved this from Ron; Ron was right. It was Harry's fault for staying married her for so many years when he knew deep down he was gay and couldn't really love Ginny.
"I would like to say a few things," he seemed nervous but he was holding himself together better than he was in the bedroom, Harry thought. "Firstly, happy birthday Harry! Thank you for being one of my best friends in life, and thank you for letting me use this time to say something that has nothing to do with you."
Albus watched his dad turn to Draco, as if to ask what to do, and then back to him, "Albus, let me explain."
Eventually the topic changed to the kids, and so on to other things, how their lives have been since those old days. Both men had much more fun chatting and laughing about things from Hogwarts than they ever thought they would.
“Missed you at our place the last few weeks, Harry. The little ones get restless when they haven’t seen Uncle Harry in a while. Same goes for Ronny and I, now that I think of it. How are you? Really…and none of that prattle about being fine and it was just a flu…we’ve known each other too long to play at all that.”
“Harry? I’ve got the potion right here. It’s a proper night’s sleep for you until I say otherwise. Tomorrow, when I’m not too busy, we’re going to have a long talk, and I think it’s overdue. Until then, rest easy, alright?”
It hadn’t been all bad. There were a lot of memories of the last two months that were downright pleasant, as well as bloody wicked sexy. That was what lulled Harry into complacency. That was what had made this situation possible. Otherwise, he was sure he’d never have let it happen.
Harry bristled still, but was mollified by the fact that Minerva hadn’t put much stock in the pompous ass who’d written the letter.
Draco had sat listening raptly, then blushed a furious scarlet at the frank conversation about his wants. "It isn't something he can't give. You're wrong. He could…if he wanted to. He just…he…he won't. Not can't…won't. Not for me."
“No…not at all! You’re a student here, and before we’re through, you might WISH you’d been expelled, but if you wish to remain on these grounds, even if it’s only to assure yourself of Professor Potter’s well being, then you will remain a student here and be punished accordingly. That’s the deal, take it or leave it. Expulsion and immediate departure, or remain a student and accept whatever punishment is deemed fit. It’s in your hands now.”
Draco froze. He was almost certain of what that letter held. That it would come to haunt him here, while almost feeling as if he had a place he belonged…it was nauseating. There was nothing he wanted to say. There were many things he hadn’t told John Prewett, and this was among them, and for good reason. The sense of approaching humiliation was unbearable.
Or the time Draco had gotten soaked in the rain after Apparating directly to Harry’s doorstep, unaware of the downpour in London that day. The man had been drenched in seconds before he could spell a shield up to block the rain, and either needed to spell himself clean, dry and styled again, or just use Harry’s shower and clothes for a bit. That had been the simplest answer, but it had led to one terribly ticklish moment. Harry had forgotten to leave a large bath towel for Draco, and when the man had finished with a brief, warm shower to beat the chill, he’d headed for Harry’s bedroom to change…wearing only a short towel.
“You know what’s up. Sorry…about this, I mean. Looks like we need to apply some more ‘pressure’ in a few places. This could take a little while. I hope you know I really wanted to be here…for you.”
Having it feel good is still strange. Just feeling warm and close and safe is amazing beyond description. It took weeks for me to stop shivering when we'd get close. Not that that stopped me from finally having something like a normal sex life though. I just kind of expected that getting to that point would take awhile, or not happen at all. I didn't know he'd be like that when I found him.
Harry stood frozen in place, mouth agape, barely aware that he was crying. Malfoy kept muttering promises of compliance, as if he was in a trance, waiting submissively to be violated in spite of being obviously terrified past the point of rational thought. All he could see of Harry was the monster that had robbed him of his will and threatened to take even more. It took Harry longer than he could recall to snap out of the cycle of all consuming self loathing and repulsion, and get his mind back in the real world again.
“I was thinking, love. After the crowd has gone, let's open the ballroom up again. I think I'd like to dance with you tonight.”
Harry clapped a hand onto Malfoy’s shoulder and tripped his Portkey for home, ignoring the affronted look he got when Draco realized what had just happened. Luckily, the disorientation took the edge off of Draco’s outrage, but that was only because two brains under the influence of alcohol were poorly suited for Portkey travel. They hit the floor of Harry’s apartment almost as one, and the last thing Harry could remember was the vague look of irritation on Draco‘s face as he passed out just a foot away.
That cut it. I can feel myself choking up and getting hot in the face. I need the bathroom. Thank goodness the seating in here is so spacious that I can get up and walk with incredible ease. Really…there is no comparison between coach and private travel. What they would charge for accommodations like this…hell, I haven’t any idea, but then…I’ve never traveled in anything less than style. Well, as long as long as you exclude police cars and prison vans.
“Because of his son. He came here, and you couldn’t forget anymore, could you? Harry. I’m so sorry, love. How could you think we wouldn’t love you? We’d have helped…then…if you’d needed us. Harry…forgive me. I knew something was wrong, even then, but…you were always such a private person. We never wanted to intrude. It just seemed like…after you came here…you were happy again. We’ve only ever wanted you to be happy. Please know that.”
Harry began to hyperventilate, forcing words out slowly while Minerva was pulling her wand to prepare for another fainting spell on Harry's part.
We spoke of more than that. Much more. He likes me, boy or girl, dress or slacks. It sounds like an old line, but I think he wants my mind and soul, not just my flesh. Being gorgeous doesn’t hurt my chances, but he really is looking for something more, and I wonder if I can be that to him. He has a restless mind and a passion for living that makes me remember when I was glad just to be alive. It can’t be wrong to want that near me. It just can’t.
His way was made all the easier by the come he’d so recently spent, and the Lubricus had been more than sufficient. Draco pumped hard and swift into Harry, who no longer seemed to care about the perfect spot and only wanted as much as Draco could give as savagely as possible.
’A useful bloody Malfoy. Makes me think of ’Mione telling me about genetics and freak mutations. Never thought I’d see one though. Who knew? This is still a sentence to hell, but at least they sent along a small, grumpy, air conditioner.’
Finally, we’ve got a sharp little blade that’s hidden inside this lipstick. Don’t use this one for touch ups, just bring some from home. You really don’t want to cut yourself on this one. It’s surgical steel and it can slice through a tin can like it was butter. Not really meant for fighting, but it might come in handy if you keep it tucked in behind your belt. Never know when you might need to cut your way free of something, right?
‘Who the fuck do I think I’m kidding? One look in his eyes and I’ll be doing whatever he wants. I might as well just get over it. But I still bloody well mean to be on bottom next time! Gods, I love that adorable prat…’
All this…all these nice things…none of it means shit without Harry! I can’t…I can’t lose him. Not and keep a shred of sanity. I NEED him…not money…not drugs…him! The others will be here in a few hours. When did I start crying? I need a shower…again. I need a stiff drink…and some time to compose myself. I don’t want Harry to see me like this. I don’t want him thinking of anything but surviving out there. If I were a distraction…and it got him hurt…could I live with it?
He always showed me what he liked. Wasn’t I a good enough lover? I was a virgin a few months before that! He taught me everything…and I thought I made him happy. He certainly wanted more often enough!
James' face shone with relief. "Yes, absolutely! I...I didn't mean to dredge up things you want forgotten...but, I'm to be wed tomorrow. Mary's my life...we may have children soon...and all my life I've known I was an unexplained oddity...a child that shouldn't exist but did. I...I just want to know...to be at peace with who I am. Not just for myself...but for Mary, for my children someday. I don't want that mystery lodged in my heart when I should have them at the forefront of it. You do understand, don't you?"
Draco just as suddenly slumped to ground gasping for breath, eyes clear and bright. John rattled off several spells to diagnose physical and magical condition…finding only elevated heart rate associated with exertion. No magical trace of anything could be found.
“We can always have ice cream later. I think we need to stop talking and thinking…and just start doing. The manor is a kid-free zone for the next few months, and we don’t have work tomorrow, let’s stop wasting time and just see what happens when the mood strikes. Come on!”
‘How the hell did I get that bombed? I can hold my liquor better that that! Not like I had an empty stomach or anything. Damn…I gotta piss.’
Petty words would only soil such a time, but it should be said that I gave all that I could to please him. Few virgins are treated to such an ideal first time. So often it’s a fumbling affair between either two relative innocents with only the slightest hint of how to give pleasure, or a hasty encounter between one person who dearly desires their own pleasure at the expense of the inexperienced partner. It is a far different thing between Harry and I.
“So…what is it that’s so important for Harry that I should see you alone? And don’t waste my time, it had better be good or I’m out of here. I’d sooner kiss a basilisk than trust you!” Her tone was waspish, and her eyes were cold and flinty.
’Get up. Get up and take the fucking pills, Moony. Take the pills. Dora would want you to. Diana would want you to do this. Just get up off the bed…take the fucking pills…and you’ll be alright.’
“Be mature about these things, Draco! Your father has been away for almost two years…a woman has needs…and Hakim is a perfect gentlem-”
Harry chuckled softly. It was a refreshing level of honesty from Draco. “Okay...okay...just hit play. We'll train up and then see what we can do...together. I think...as long as its with you...I'm going to be happy no matter what it is we get up to.”
Harry pulled Draco to him again, and Draco was too tired and too surprised to resist. He found himself slumped against Harry as they both sat upon the flagstones of the floor beside the wall, Harry's arms around him again. Draco sighed and relaxed, not really caring anymore what came of it all. This exquisite feeling of freedom and closeness was more than he had ever known, and it was nothing he wanted to make end.
’Ron Weasley! Is it absolutely necessary for you to be a complete and total ass?! After this long, and you can’t even at least manage that without putting forth so much extra effort?! Please!
Draco had won. Harry knew it. There was no question of equality between them, and if Draco had had any doubts about whether he held the reins in this affair, those doubts were surely shattered by now. Harry had given up any pretense that might have protected him, and only mercy on Draco’s part could keep him from grief.
A flashback of days past and bittersweetly beautiful memories destroyed slid away, and he was trembling with rage, looking at the sulky and impudent brat that had practically assaulted a student just to lure Harry into a duel. There was nothing calm or sage in Harry’s tone when he could finally bring himself to speak.
“I…uh…I’m not sure. Just…you know…get well…you prat. It isn’t the same without you. Oh…and let your bloody friends in, ’cause if ’Mione and Ron find out I did this and saw you before they did, it’ll be my arse! Never minding Minerva hearing bout forged papers! ’Kay?”
Nonetheless, here he was, outside the door of the Prefect baths, cloaked and hidden from the world, ready to slake Draco’s every lust, and willing to ignore a heart that ached for something more every time he looked upon the lean and beautiful blond he’d fallen so helplessly for.
Harry sighed relief. At least that topic was closed. The mention of Draco’s exhaustion set his mind to work again. Draco needed to eat, and Harry had every intention of getting him to do so, short of using actual violence.
I used the computer, since the nightclub landscape has changed since I was free, and I need somewhere other than Pansy’s hangout. I’m not honestly sure if I could resist coke a second time…with Harry gone and an empty bed as my reward for being a good boy and doing the right thing. There’s a newer club called the Fire House that’s well rated and supposedly red-hot. I’ll try it out and see if it meets my standards.
“Well, let me first say that I’ve been a medi-wizard more than twice as long as you’ve been alive. Not to brag, but in general, I know what I’m doing. I was on staff at St. Mungo’s during the war, almost two decades ago. It was a difficult time for a lot of people, and there were quite a few who had worse to deal with than we did. That said, I treated a great deal more people than usual, and for ailments more serious than usual.
Maybe this was what it meant to be an adult. To have to know such things and live with them, no matter how much they tore and hurt and burned inside him. It was hard and horrible, and Harry wished he could turn back the clock and make the past weeks disappear. He’d been so comfortable with his ignorance, flirting with the sexual trappings of adulthood, only to tumble headlong into a place that made him want to run, screaming, back to the safety and blissful innocence of childhood. This was life…and that scared him to the very core of his being.
“Professor…I apologize for my behavior yesterday. I became very anxious when I thought that my request would be rejected out of hand. I hope you will forgive my insolence, and be assured that I am very serious about my studies. I would not disappoint you as a student.”
We talked…after. He was upset mostly because he was scared, but also because I cringe when I think things are going to get violent. Especially with him. I’ve started to realize that, just because I believe in him and love him, it doesn’t mean that I’ve forgotten my instincts. Getting hit is something you get used to…something you learn to expect when dealing with alpha males. I usually use sex as a distraction, but I fall back on complete submission when I think I’m in real danger.
My tongue was another matter…and only Harry knows about that yet…I’ve just been conspicuously quiet around the others lately. What they don’t know won’t make them snicker about my insatiable desire to make Harry’s eyes roll back in his head.
But the feel of his breath on the back of my neck makes me glad I tucked carefully before leaving the house…or everyone here today would see me leaving with a very undignified bump in the front of this tight little, red one-piece number I’m wearing.
He needed advice…or access to knowledge. Who could provide that safely? Advice required friends. Draco’s ‘friends’ were like hyenas, waiting for the chance to move in on easy prey. So advice was out of the question. Access to knowledge, however, held possibilities.
“Is there another kind? You won’t believe this shit. There was a power outage. A ’flicker’ that lasted eight minutes. Guess when?”
Draco seemed pensive for a moment, then the liveliness he‘d shown slipped away, and he slumped back onto his pillows. His voice was softer when he spoke again.
Draco Malfoy returned to his private suite, slipping off the long robes he wore for classes. His wand flicked while he muttered spell after spell, warding his room with all the caution of a practiced Auror. When his room was silenced and sealed from all intrusion, even the mildest of scrying, he turned to the heavy chest of oak at the foot of his bed.
The days had blurred into weeks...and then into months. The proud creature that Draco had been had melted away in the aftermath of that terrible day...and what was left was a broken mess. Sometimes he did not rise for most of a day, save to use a bathroom, and other times he paced fretfully but without purpose. Mostly he sat, and always he drank. The Malfoy cellars were deep and well stocked...and he'd rarely put more than a slight dent in them...but now the bottles had to be collected by the occasional visiting house elf dropping off fresh stock.
“You’re lying through your teeth! I can tell. I know you, Ron Weasley, and I know when you’re bullshitting me! How fucking dare you have a way to cool off and not tell me! I thought we were mates! Are you a fucking Slytherin now? I’ve saved your bloody life! What the hell are you thinking?!”
Draco had hoped for a conversation that flattered him, but it didn’t seem to be forthcoming. Harry was almost completely out of it, smiling giddily and just holding Draco’s arm around him. It was a little disconcerting, but after almost a quarter hour, Harry finally got a grip on himself and spoke hoarsely.
“Celebrate? That’s a good idea. Tell you what…you are the champagne…and I’m going to pop the cork. I like the way you’re looking at me. Let me show you how much.”
I hadn’t really thought of it. Scar removal is normal these days. A laser scalpel and some careful healing afterwards. This one last reminder of where I’ve been could be gone. He’d make it go away, forever.
Harry took me to a salon. A proper salon…not just a stylist. I got a manicure and pedicure, as well as a much more suitable hairstyle, while soothing music played and Harry read a newspaper. I picked a nice, shorter, unisex hairstyle. Longish bangs, almost in my eyes, and reasonably short in the back. It’s perfect, and with my hair finished and styled into place, I look almost eighteen again. I got a massage too, and let me tell you, I haven’t had one since I was just a kid who wasn’t old enough to be sore anywhere that counted, and if it brought tears to me eyes…well…they were from joy.
Somewhere about then I noticed I'd lost a stone and a half of weight and was getting sickly. Healing spells started being necessary. That put a stop to the occasional infections and the worst side effects of the drugs. It was all for the better, because I couldn't get decent tricks while periodically passing out from exhaustion. Once I made a habit of healing up after heavy drug use...I was able to hold myself together much longer at a time.
The drawstring was pulled open in silence and Draco slipped the pajama bottoms down to the middle of his calves. It didn’t take more than a second or two to reach a state of arousal, given that, at eighteen, his body responded when the wind shifted! Logically, he knew this was a pointless ritual of adolescence, and practically beneath him, but the physical need was still there. This was simply one of those things that had to be done…or sticky sheets and crusted clothing would result.
“Thanks! That was like the best thing you’ve ever done. EVER! ‘Mione, I can’t even tell you how much I owe you for this! Owe you or no, I have to ask…can you get those books for me this week? Pleasepleaseplease!” Harry dropped to his knees and clasped his hands, begging with puppy dog eyes that would have melted stone. Hermione crumbled.
“I have my own ways of finding out what I want to know. I found you two, and I took you out of your dorm with no one the wiser. I can do that anytime I want…so think about that before you piss me off! Tell me what you know…and tell it to me now…or I swear I’ll use you two as punching bags all night long, and if I’m not content when the sun comes up, I’ll dump your fucking corpses in the Forbidden Forest and let the crows takes care of the rest! How about you, Nott? Is there anything you want to say?” Harry let his broom float closer to Theo, and cracked his knuckles menacingly.
Then a series of words that might have been meaningless to anyone else met her eyes, and Hermione’s attention snapped instantly back into place. Harry Black. Harry Potter. Random searches. All in vain, but lots of them now that she took the time follow up the number of requests for information that had cropped up over these last weeks. From an amazing number of sources too. Almost all in the Chicago area. A little research showed that both police and federal agents, as well as private investigators, were following up leads that Hermione had long ago ensured only met dead ends. What was important was that they were all asking the same questions…at the same time. Someone had tipped them off, and that hinted at Riddle pulling strings and moving the little information that he had onto the market.
“Absolutely! I’ll be alright. I’ve seen John every few days for the last couple weeks. If he thinks I need a break, I’m sure he’ll tell me. You know as well as I do that he isn’t the least bit shy of sharing his opinion. He’s been a great help, but…I still have dreams. I’ll admit…working with Draco the Younger isn’t a great help. He’s a good student…incredible actually…but it’s…very discomforting at times.”
Draco rolled to the top, still rooted in Harry, wild-eyed and panting like a wolf from a long chase. For a moment, he seemed unsure of himself, and Harry raked his fingernails down Draco’s back with a violence that surely left red welts and must have taken away some skin as well. That put Draco back in gear, and he grabbed hold of Harry’s knees, tipping Harry back and sliding his own arms into position, folding Harry nearly in half in the process.
Lost in thought. That might have described his last decade! So much had passed in what felt like so short a time. Here he was a man in his thirties, bespectacled, fit despite the years, respected around the globe for his youthful heroism, but largely quiet in his personal life...and for all the distance he'd come...he still felt like an awkward kid thrust into a role he wasn't prepared for and making it up as he went along. Was that all life was? Was that the secret? Just doing as well as one could whether your plans worked out or not, no matter which way the winds of fate blew you?
He wanted Draco’s first time as a bottom to be as sensational as his own, but he was by no means settling for some reversed mirror image of their past weekend. Draco hadn’t been able to put a weeks worth of time into these books, and there were more than a few worthy notions that they hadn’t even approached or considered yet. Someday, Harry meant to try them all, but for now, he’d settle for a smattering of the most appealing.
“I know, love. It hurts…and I understand. You have to wake up. Let the wards down, Harry. There are people who love you out there. You need their help. If you love me, you’ll know what I’d want you to do. Let them help you, Harry. I…I love you.”
It comes out in strangled bits, between gasps for breath while the tears begin to flow and the sobs heave up from his chest. Still clad only in sheets, buckled over by the pain that consumes him, there on the edge of the bed.
It wasn’t as if Harry hadn’t seen this kind of thing before. First crushes and ‘puppy love’ were normal things to encounter in a career that involved so many young people, especially those hovering on the cusp of adulthood. It was a thing dealt with most by the younger, human members of the staff, including Hermione and Cho Chang. The admiration for an instructor sometimes mingled with the somewhat murky realm of desire, and Harry had always been careful to give no accidental impression of returned affection, or encouragement for anything beyond a good academic performance.
I heard through the grapevine that the guy I’m looking for has at least a few similarities to a guy you might have been looking for…in that prison riot case from last month, right before everything got crazy on the streets. I can’t name my sources, but I was told that a fella named Harry Black was somewhere near the chewy center of that mess at the federal penitentiary. Now all I have is a name…Harry Potter, and a photo…here. Does this bear any resemblance to the guy your looking for?”
“I'm sorry! Maybe this was too much. Did you not like it? I didn't...I don't want to be pushy...I just...”
I barely remember them breaking the curse..except the pain, which is in my memory clear as a bell. It took a long while for the staff of St. Mungo's to unscramble enough my brain for me to remember most of what I've written. I've never felt anything so awful as the agony that curse created in me. It wasn't like Crutiatus...where the body feels it...it was more than that. Mind, body, spirit...it hurt everywhere at the same time. As soon as they let me come to enough to feel what they were up to...it was all around me. Love. They had it pouring out of them and it was like being sandblasted. I totally get why the did what they did. The cuffs, the potion, the ambush spells to knock me out. If they hadn't...I can't say what I would have done to them in the state of mind I was in at the time. I could have hurt them, or myself. I'm told that I should have been dead years ago...and that the curse had time to reach a level its never normally reached in a victim before. They act like I should be proud...but I'm not. Not really. Mostly just horrified when I think of what it made me do to survive. I used to think all those things I did...came from me...not from desperation to live. I find it kind of comforting to know it was the curse...because I've been and done things that make it more than a little hard to like myself afterward. If you've ever slept in an alleyway with blood and cum in your underwear after being paid to let four guys take turns fucking you for half a night...its hard to have warm and fuzzy feelings about your place in the world.
Remus splashed some water on his face and ran his wet hands through his hair, slicking down the unruly bits and lamenting the few hairs that always came away in his hands. Christ. He wasn’t even forty five years old. Why did he have to be the one who started balding at thirty? Dora had liked him anyway, but he’d fucked that up…just like everything else in his life.
I hate these questions, but what can I do but answer quietly and keep my complaints to myself? Making him angry is not on my agenda. It’s just…would anyone headed for a life of shit want to be reminded of the life they lost? I wish he understood that.
“You want something…so now you want to play nice. I knew you were up to something. When Harry finds…”
The light from his wand penetrated the gloom as he moved forward…and the walls of the back became clear. There was a crude archway, no door in place, and within was a room of discarded items, but seated clearly in the center was Draco Malfoy, cross-legged on the floor with his back to Harry, who hurried forward until he could see what had captured Draco’s attention. That stopped Harry cold in a heartbeat.
Harry was a bit taken aback by the overwhelming excitement he saw, and a little impressed by the fact that Draco had clearly done some research at a level far beyond most people’s abilities…even Harry’s. Granted, Harry had studied and taught DADA for fifteen years, and was the best at what he did, but Hermione was in a league of her own. To be honest, there wasn’t even a league, and she was actually blazing a trail of her own through the magical wilderness. He also wasn’t used to people reacting with far more excitement over her than for him…it was actually a little chastening.
She walked directly to Draco’s table and sat down across from him. Given that there were very few students in the library, this was acceptable, but it was a bit disconcerting to say the least. Gryffindor directness was still unnerving for Draco, and it seemed unlikely that he would ever be completely comfortable with their blunt and honest ways.
“Well, I think it’s good that you’re talking to me like this. You seem different…more open. I like it. I think it’s healthy, Draco.”
There were also people that couldn’t be helped. A great many people died during the war against Voldemort, and in my profession, watching that happen over and over again is inevitable.
‘I can call it that…now. We’re making love. We did so much, but never this. This is the best day of my life. I wonder if I’ll ever be able to make him understand. This isn’t surrender, or submission…this is victory.’
"You seem fine, at least by the reckoning of my spells, but I'd prefer to be certain you were well before sending you off. You've never shown any sign of fits like that before. Draco, if there's anything wrong, anything troubling you or causing you issue…you do know that you can tell me about it, right?"
Others talk. Only Pansy knows that I am hunting, but the school itself is abuzz with the word that I secretly desire Potter and failed for the first time at hiding my intentions. I won’t speak ill of him at any time, nor will I let the face so many know slip free. In his eyes and the eyes of all, there is only Draco, the lovestruck playboy who has abandoned all his other companions.
Draco stopped in front of a stairwell, slapped his hand against his head, and had a moment of frank self honesty.
‘That was good. Really good, Harry. I guess you were taking notes. I appreciate the effort. Thank you.’
It all goes down in black and white. Questions while I explain the night step by step. Right down to the lipstick on Blaise’s dick. No detail is left unrecorded, and I get congratulations for the fast thinking that kept the evening from turning into a bloodbath. It would have been easier if Harry had just slipped in and killed them all, but in spite of the hassles, I still got the job done, and the atmosphere is celebratory. They like me, and it shows. I don’t feel like a whore that was brought here on Harry’s say so, I feel like a member of a team, and no one touches on the subject of where I came from, even though the entire job was rooted in it. I am content.
It might have sounded harsh, but what I told you was true, and I hope to God you listened. You want a fresh start? Want to leave the past behind? Your best chance at that is to quit the habits that got you into trouble in the first place. Take my word for it. Nothing will be improved by abusing your body. Remember those questions I asked the first time we met? They weren’t accidents. Cocaine and meth-amphetamine may have sounded like a fine idea when you first used them, but you abused heavy drugs almost weekly if not daily for just about two years before you went to jail. Throw in seven years of apparently starving yourself by eating like a bird, with food that wasn’t much good to start with, and your body is in no shape to handle stress.
“Well…uh…does he really live in a castle…with…like…ghosts and portraits just like at school? ‘Cause that would be pretty cool.”
Such sweet perfume! And not merely the wisps of the pricey stuff he’d purchased for her, but rather the perfume of her body. He was a lusty fellow, even past his prime, and the scent of a woman still aroused just as fiercely as it ever had. When she clambered atop him, knees on either side of his head, and mounted his waiting mouth, he savored the feel and texture of her skin, the warmth of her aroused flesh, and let himself enjoy the treasure offered to his tongue.
Harry nodded, still grinning like an idiot. “Perfect. Just perfect. Couldn’t ask for better if I tried. Oh…by the way…”
“We had a lot of weird events that all tied into the first killings after the riot…little things that hinted at big things, but we couldn’t make a solid connection. It’s my hunch that they mean more than people think, but I couldn’t prove it in a court of law. First…power outages on the nights of the first killings, targeting specific neighborhoods for exactly the few minutes it would take a killer to leave the scene. No cameras or other evidence left behind. Second…computer records from the prison referring to Harry Black completely disappeared, and even though he was supposed to have been transferred to the SuperMax facility, no one ever heard from him again. The guy just disappeared like he never existed in the first place. Third…within a few weeks of these incredibly clean, execution style killings, all using different methods, different guns, and targeting different organizations, the power outages stop and the gangs start killing each other off on their own.
“It was you or me. I chose you. Didn’t really want it that way, but that’s how it is. Looks like you came through it all okay.”
“You’re daft, Malfoy! A cab? From London to sodding Wiltshire? You’d be home in time to…to turn round an’ show up for work next week. Be better off on th’ Knight Bus!”
“All right then. I’ll see you as soon as you have those apologies ready for my review, and again at the start of the new week. A good day to you then, Mr. Malfoy.”
I blow the smoke into the little bitch’s face, and drop the cigarette into his drink with a lazy flick. The look of outrage is all the reward I need.
Harry moved in close behind him until he could feel the warmth of another body pressed against him, and suddenly a warm mouth was against Draco's own and it was almost possible to forget that the situation was so outlandish. Warm arms around him and a fine body pressed close to him in a way that had become familiar over the past few months made it all melt away while they kissed.
"This is so nice," Harry said, petting Draco's snowy owl who he had taken a liking to as it reminded him of Hedwig. Draco had recently admitted to Harry that he had gotten the bird for that very reason; it reminded Draco's of Harry's old pet, which reminded Draco of Harry. He had been quite embarrassed to admit this since it was before they were even together, but Harry found it endearing.
Ginny's eyes widened in shock. She knew something wasn't right, she knew he didn't really love her, but she had guessed there was another woman, not a man.
"Your father should be home from work soon, want to stay for dinner? The five of us? And Ginny why don't you bring some things here and stay with us for a while?"
"So, here's how it's going to work. James," Harry said turning to his eldest son, "You are going to stay in Albus's room."
It had been two months since the divorce and people were still talking about that. Rita Seeker had been publishing articles every week or so with interviews from people who supposedly knew "the real reason why" Harry and Ginny divorced, but Harry didn't care. Most of the articles blamed Harry, which Harry could live with. He had been slandered in the news quite a few times before, and he didn't want people blaming Ginny. Thankfully Ginny's drunken night hadn't gotten out either so he knew it was all nonsense.
The next few days Harry barley spoke to anyone. He kept getting letters from everyone who vaguely knew him asking if it was true. Was he really gay? Was he dating Draco Malfoy? And people kept asking him if he was leaving his job. This was the second time in 6 months that Harry's ability to do his job was brought into question. Harry couldn't believe the ridiculousness of it all, and he was really getting sick of being questioned all the time.
In the end, Draco "caved" and took the last name 'Potter'. He said he wanted to share the same last name as the person he loved, which was true, but he also wanted to get away from everything his last name meant: the pureblood elitism, connections to Voldemort, and so on. Draco had lost much of his pureblood mentality during his first marriage, since Astoria did not feel that way and the last of that thinking died off after dating a halfblooded and spending time with his muggle-born and muggle-loving friends.
Harry heard Draco say, "Who would have thought," non-chalantly. But Draco was thinking about Dumbledore. Every time he came up, he felt an overwhelming guilt for what he almost did. He still blamed himself for Dumbledore's death, but he never talked to Harry about it. Little did Draco know that Harry knew what happened in the astronomy tower that night, and didn't blame Draco at all.
Harry followed Draco up to his very large master bedroom. Draco started to strip, and for a second Harry thought he wanted to go again, but then Draco threw on a sleeping shirt and threw Harry one.
At 7 on the dot, the fire place burned green and out stepped Malfoy. "You came." said Harry slightly surprised, even though he had just spent the last hour cooking for his arrival.
The two men sat down to eat the meal Harry had prepared. It actually wasn't bad, and Draco didn't make any complaints.
"It's alright Dean, I know what happened. I'm not upset with you, but I wanted you to know that Ginny and I are getting divorced."
Harry wanted them to completely understand, "I never really had the time to think about it. By the time our lives finally started to slow down, Ginny and I were already married; James was born. I didn't want to believe it, that I was attracted to men. So I just ignored it; we were a family, and I didn't want to ruin that. I care for Ginny, I really do. But at this point neither of us are happy being together anymore."
After that the waiter came by and took their orders. When it came Draco actually enjoyed the food, though he didn't want to admit it to Harry.
Harry made them both eggs for breakfast. As soon as they were done, he wrote to Minerva and arranged his third visit to Hogwarts that year.
Harry sat frozen, open vial in his hand in front of him. Before he could have a thought, he was hit hard in the back. The vial flew from his hand, and it's contents spilled out onto the forest ground with an acid-like 'hiss.'
Dinner talk was about Harry's speech and how brave he was to hold the press conference. Some people asked about their relationship but directed the questions mostly to Harry. Everyone seemed a bit apprehensive to address Draco directly. The Wealseys were also all catching up on how they've each been since they'd seen each other last.
Everyone was silent for what seemed like forever. When it was clear that Author, Molly and even George were at a complete lost for words, Harry launched into the explanation and apologizes about Ginny.
"What are you doing here Albus?" Harry can't believe his son just walked in on him and Draco. Of course, of all the students at Hogwarts, his son would be the kind to hang out in the Hog's Head. Harry felt a bit stupid.
Headmistress McGonagall was sitting in her office one Saturday evening when an owl swooped in. She untied the letter from it's leg; she recognized the rushed scrawl:
"Dad," she said as calmly as she could, but there was still the hint of anger in her voice, "I don't care that you're gay, but I can't believe you didn't tell us. Did mom know?"
"I think it has to be." Harry agreed, "I'll stay, if you want, for the kids. You can see someone else–"
"I'm not sure how to say this, Harry... something just isn't right. Between us. And it's not because of your issues." She looks him in the eye, "Do you love me?"
"What are you doing here?!" Albus yells angrily. All he can think is: His dad. In Hogsmeade. With Mr. Malfoy. Kissing.
"Can I say something or are you going to punch me in the arm again, honey?" Ron asked Hermione. Hermione just rolled her eyes; Ron turned to Harry, "I don't understand it, Harry. He was always kind of mean to us at Hogwarts..."
It was a sunny afternoon when all the kids were practicing flying on brooms over the backyard as Harry and Draco watched from the porch with a pitcher of ice-cold spiked lemonade. The couple looked out at their little family.
