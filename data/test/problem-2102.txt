“No… no, no,” Harry breathed, shaking his head. He moved his arm, but Fenrir was on top of him, snarling.
“But yours aren’t,” Harry said, “I don’t know anything you’ve seen directly. And your power isn’t mine, not all of it, not yet.”
“Amazing!” Neville cheered, “How about we talk to Blaise about it, and we meet up during the weekend for it? Saturday perhaps?”
“During his private lesson with Harrison, Dumbledore saw into his mind, where he caught a glimpse of me,” Voldemort said. “I need to get that man out of Hogwarts before he tries to do anything against my son.”
“Well, I have decided that it is time, now that you know what prompted Lord Voldemort to try and kill you fifteen years ago, for you to be given certain information.”
“And who are these people?” the Minister asked.
“He is planning nothing, look—” he grabbed Draco’s right arm and pushed the sleeve up, revealing bare skin. “Both of you need to stop being so paranoid about me and Draco,” he said. “I can handle myself—yeah what those idiots said to me hurt but you don’t see me rushing to hit them do you? And I’m not exactly doing nothing either, Hermione.” He glared at the two of them. “Madam Malkin won’t give us robes because of me, however, if you want I’ll take you to Twilfitt and get you robes there.”
The taller teen looked down, “Fine,” he said after a moment. “Weasley, I am sorry.”
“Doesn’t matter,” Lestrange said. “The boy will never become his wife! I won’t allow it!”
Remus froze at the hissing and spotted the snake. “Tom?” he said, with some fear in his voice. “There’s a snake.”
“We were in our dormitories,” Harry explained, “Gryffindor Tower and the Slytherin Dungeon about to go to bed when we both started to feel intense pain.”
His body started to itch, and he squirmed uncomfortably, but he kept sitting on his bed, never moving until his Alpha comes. He wanted to stay still, wanted to wait, something inside him wanted to show his Alpha how he can be a good boy.
“Carbs are good,” Draco shrugged. “Besides I’m just cooking for the five of us so it should be fine.”
“Heats are easy, your next one isn’t till November, so give me all of your plushies for me to scent," Niall said. “I’ll even make sure to sneak some of my robes in for you. Your brother’s scent should be much better than those strangers’.”
“It is not that we are more accepting, Harry,” Draco said, “although we are superior. It is because we know how to keep our mouths shut.” Harry frowned at that. He didn’t want to believe that both houses were just as hateful towards the other. He showed Draco where his bed was and his Alpha left for a shower when the other boys walked in.
“Hmm, nothing specific yet,” Draco shook his head. “It just goes on about what the Soul is. However, it does make the Ministry look hypocritical, doesn’t it?”
The three all stood, and Dumbledore dismissed them. Back in the corridor, Draco took Harry’s hand and pulled him, “Come along, we have to go to my dormitory,” he said, glancing at Harry. “We are going to spend the night in Gryffindor Tower, but god help me if I will wear Gryffindor colors the morning after.”
“Um, Harry?” Neville said.
“Deal,” Harry nodded.
It took hours to have the guest leave, everyone wanted to shake Harry’s hand, to congratulate about the wedding and talk about their contribution, many not believing they took part while others took it smugly. Mr. Riddle waited by the newlyweds and waited until it was just them, Harry’s uncles, and Draco’s parents. “You have used me Harry,” Mr. Riddle said, he looked more proud than angry.
“Of course, always happy to help a puppy get collared,” the man chuckled, pocketing the money. The two turned and left, holding each other’s hands. Draco smirked, “Think I should get you a leash?” he snickered, “so we can take walks under the full moon.”
Draco came over, and looked a little bashful. “Hello Harry,” he said.
“None, I will not excuse my actions, however, I have done, as I always have done, what I felt was for the greater good. Harry needed to focus on the task ahead of him, defeating Voldemort. I saw immediately that his second gender was an issue, it would be detrimental for him to go into battle and be distracted because of his heat,” Dumbledore said passionately. “He needed the protein, needed to be rid of his heat if he were to survive this war and beat Voldemort. I knew the possible dangers and accepted them.”
But the scream of delight came from the Slytherin end: Ron had dived wildly, his arms wide an the Quaffle had soared between them, straight through Ron’s central hoop.
“You want to be careful,” Ron said, “if Mum sees one of them again…”
Ron’s cheeks grew pink. “I was thinking of trying out for the team,” he admitted. “But because you got kicked off, it doesn’t feel right.”
“—and Pucey’s dodged Alicia again, and he’s heading straight for goal, stop it Ron!”
“I can’t think about it,” Harry said, shaking his head. He dressed as quickly as he could and made his way downstairs.
“What is it?” Hermione asked.
“Be a good professor now,” Draco smirked, kissing Harry’s cheek.
When Christmas came, the boys just went on about how awesome Viktor Krum was and their classes. In fact, all of their letters were about their awesome friend Krum, and how they were doing in classes, and Harry was perfectly fine with it. The other students just avoided them, except for Krum who seemed to be very popular, but he always found time for the Potter twins. Their first four years were honestly uneventful, they learned and hung out with Krum and when Krum was with other friends, Harry and Niall kept to themselves hanging out in Harry’s nest. During his heats, Harry stayed in his bed and Niall brought food to him, sneaking sweets when he could.
Voldemort asked.
Harry wondered what an Inferi was as they moved away. Shoppers stayed together in small groups, however as they walked by, Harry could feel their glares and dirty looks. None dared to approach Harry, however, their dirty looks shooting to the crowd he was with. Harry looked back at the shoppers when they passed and saw that they spat in his direction. Mrs. Weasley hated the idea of them separating, however Harry, Hermione, and Ron needed new school robes. She relented and allowed the three to walk by themselves to Madam Malkin’s for new robes while she, Ginny, and Mr. Weasley went to Flourish and Blotts to get their school books.
“Of course Harry Potter sir, Dobby will not punish Dobby anymore!” Dobby said.
He relaxed and a moment later he was back in his own body. He opened his eyes and stood up to stretch as Nagini hissed. “I believe we now know how we’re going to oust Dumbledore and save your little snake,” he said to Nagini. “But first, we must rest.”
She was sitting in an armchair, humming to herself and drinking an afternoon tea, when there was a gust of wind, and a figure appeared. “Could have knocked,” she grumbled, not even alarmed at the sudden intruder’s presence. She looked at the figure and frowned, “Thought I killed you.”
“Harry, there you were, where were you?” Hermione asked, looking happy, “Neville told us that he has a place where we can practice!”
Finally, it was two weeks from the wedding, and Loki reappeared. Harry, Draco, and Blaise were mentally exhausted. The planning for the wedding was finally complete. The three thought they could relax, until the god of mischief appeared, and Harry remembered that they scarcely began to plan how to trap Blaise’s father.
“Your brother is mental,” the omega muttered, and Harry glared at him. Niall shook his head and stood up, smiling at Harry brightly.
“I don’t know, he and Crabbe and Goyle were all just running in terror,” Hermione said.
The next day, Harry felt completely fine. He had no sickness or cold sweats, or any aches. He moved normally, ate normally, and was able to keep his breakfast and lunch down. However, when it was dinner time again he felt the same coldness and his stomach protested violently. He didn’t want to cause a scene. He didn’t want to vomit twice in two days, so he forced it all down, swallowing every cough as they came up. He ate less and only waited until they were all dismissed to go to the bathroom and vomit out the sick and blood. Ron found him and soothed his friend through it.
he hissed. He put his book to the side and bent down, extending his arm. Nagini’s tongue flicked at his fingers, and Harry smiled. “Come on,” he said in English.
The day of the trip came faster than Harry expected. He was now two weeks into October, and still the strange feeling never left. It was an oddly beautiful sunny day, the temperature was just right that he didn’t really need a jacket as a light breeze blew throughout the castle grounds. Harry and Draco decided to walk down together towards Hogsmeade, openly holding hands as they huddled together. “So, where exactly in Hogsmeade is there a kink shop?” Harry laughed as they walked down the road.
“Ohh,” Neville said, relieved. “That’s good.”
“What do you know?” Ron seethed, “you hate your family.”
“Then can I ask you questions? And like you can answer how you feel about them as an Omega?” Ron asked. “Like I want to get this all right.”
“Who knows, I didn’t get around to ask my dad about that,” Harry shrugged. “He won’t even talk to me about it.”
Draco woke up with a splitting headache. Groaning, he looked around groggily, confused about where he was. He was in a half-furnished room with fairy lights ringing around the room, stopping halfway. Draco was sleeping on the unfurnished side, his belongings barely put away with only his laptop on the desk. He was wearing pajama bottoms and nothing else, his pale twink body on display, not that it mattered as the only other person was a redhead who snored loudly in his own bed.
Harry nodded. “They didn’t mention anything about it, and Hedwig never loses letters.”
“I was wondering if I could work on it a little,” Harry said.
“Will… will Voldemort ever come back?” Remus asked, forcing himself to say the name.
“We’ll be in our seats if you need us,” Uncle Sirius said. The two hugged Harry and moved around the outside of the seats, reaching the front where three empty seats were kept. They were right in front of Draco and his parents. Harry stood awkwardly at the aisle between the chairs, his feet feeling like lead. It took him all of his concentration and nerves to take one step.
“You said she but my Alpha… he’s a guy.”
Minutes dragged, becoming hours or half hours, and before Harry knew it, he was playing with air as his plate was empty. It was only then did Dumbledore looked up again. “Thank you again, Harry,” he said. “You are not in trouble, and none of us, I am certain, hold anything you have told us against you. You’ve had a stressful couple of days, and have more than earned a peaceful sleep. I will walk around the house, making sure to fortify it against these shadow creatures. I am sorry but you will not be able to use them for the remainder of your holiday.”
“Draco…”
“You have seen our Lord, Harry, are you certain?” he asked.
“As long as you have a seal-proof plan to trick and trap Satan, then basically yes,” Uncle Remus said.
“More of the bloody meditating,” Draco grumbled. Harry, however, smiled, “Come on Draco,” he said cheerfully, “it’ll be worth it once we reach our magic!”
“You will?” Ron blinked. “I’ll be honest—it’ll help if you’re there, Harry.”
Aurors took to stunning the most disruptive of the crowd, which caused even more outrage until Remus and Sirius stood up and pulled Niall towards them for safety. Niall struggled initially but stopped as he saw his godfathers.
“You really do love to talk about relationships that aren’t yours,” Draco said. He went to the shopkeeper and pulled out his leather sack. “I need belladonna, helleborne, hemlock, blood lilies, and for you to point me to your snake venoms.”
Theo was behind him. Draco had to keep reminding himself that. Theo was gone, left in California. He was in New York, he was far from him. He had a new start, a blank slate to make his mark. So why wouldn’t he give his heart the same chance?
Lilith laughed at Bellatrix’s failure. Still in the church, Harry Potter and his crew has long since gone with Bellatrix still frothing in rage in the balcony in the back of the church. She leaned against the banister, looking at the dead monster below. “That is all your work down there Bella,” she said. “Dead, frozen, then torched to minuscule ash to be blown away. That right there is why the boy is going to be our Lord’s wife. Now either you can accept it now or keep going on with this pathetic excuse of a moment.”
“You used your Voice on my brother?” Niall said, quickly getting angry, “Are you serious!? What the fuck is wrong with you?”
Harry was never before as thankful that his uncles and the Malfoys than ever as they took on the bulk of the planning. The boy never knew that there were so many elements that went into planning a wedding, and it made him wish that this would be the real event as he never wanted to go through it ever again. Stress and questions filled his days as by day he went through his classes in the Academy, strangely Mrs. Lestrange stopped teaching with no explanation, only to return home and spend another four hours with his uncles going over questions and sizes and preparations. It was decided early on that Harry would wear a white suit to represent purity and humbleness, two aspects that all blushing brides crave to be, and two traits that the Devil loves to corrupt. Draco and Blaise, meanwhile, will be wearing different suits. Draco’s a traditional black tuxedo with a white shirt while Blaise wears all black, to suggest his devilish origins.
Draco quickly called his parents and Harry and Blaise gathered around him. “Hello Mother. … Yes, I am at Harry’s. …. I know. …Mother, I need both you and Father to come here at Black’s House. There’s something I need to talk with both of you. …I know that he is busy with Mr. Riddle, however this is important. …” He glanced at Harry and Blaise. Harry grabbed his free hand while Blaise wrapped an arm around his waist. “It’s about marriage and the Dark Lord.” There was a long silence that ended with Draco hanging up. “They’ll be here soon,” he said with a sense of melancholy.
“Lessons? You never mentioned them to me,” Draco said.
“Okay, just stay safe Harry,” Hermione frowned. “And don’t do anything rash or stupid during your detention tonight—please?”
(See the end of the chapter for
The Weasleys were there to help make the place habitual, which was why Fred and George Weasley were found, one afternoon, in an old bedroom that was piled high with broken furniture, cluttered garbage, and artifacts unknown and uncared, the results of years of neglect. However, the two were not cleaning, instead they were hunched over a letter which came from their new boyfriend.
“What’s the other name that you like Harry?” Draco chuckled, squeezing his nipples hard.
Harry shook his head, “No Sir, I don’t,” he said. “I… I love it so… He reach back to his ass and spread his cheeks wide for the demon. “Please Blaise… fuck my pussy,” he said in a high voice.
“Not that, we’re talking sex,” Zabini said, rolling his eyes. “Are you the top or the bottom, Potter?”
“Yes, it is,” Voldemort said. “Sixteen years ago Adrian and I had a son, named after both of us. Sixteen years ago, before he was even a month old my Adrian died, and my son was stolen.
“Because the next thing I have to tell you might make you hate me,” Harry said, “and I don’t want to keep it a secret because you know I’m bullocks with them.”
“They’re building off of what Rita Skeeter wrote,” Hermione said, “saying that you’re a delusional attention-seeking person who thinks he’s a great tragic hero or something.”
“Thanks, Harry, but I think I can handle it,” Niall said. “Anyway, do you have your schedule yet?”
“For what?”
“Everything stopped. The fevers, the nausea, the pain. Everything went away the second we touched each other,” Draco said. “Then we just became exhausted. I took Harry to my dormitory and we were finally able to go to sleep.”
Harry nodded and held the books, moving away from the old man. An hour later, they found three more books, including one book called
“Yeah,” Hermione nodded. “Still feels weird saying that.”
“Technically no,” Harry said. “Look, the important thing is that Draco and I talked, we made up and he gave me this necklace. He wants to do better Hermione—”
“No way,” George said in a hushed voice.
“I have awarded you the grades you would have received if you presented this work in your O.W.L.,” Snape said with a smirk as he swept among them, passing back their homework. “This should give you a realistic idea of what to expect in your examinations.”
“Fuck, I want to bite you so badly,” Niall swore and they both retreated to the dorms.
“Ron, we’re supposed to show the first years where to go!”
“We suck at romance, don’t we?” He said.
The clothes came off naturally for Harry and Draco, as though they were just changing clothes instead of stripping for their new boyfriend. Harry’s body was lithe, his skin smooth and well taken care of. His nipples were perky, pushed out slightly and begging to be tormented. His body was feminine, cute, and drove both Blaise and Draco mad as their cocks grew in size and hardness. Harry’s cock too was growing hard but was slimmer than Draco’s length.
“Potter proved my point,” Draco went on, an angry flare burning inside him. “No, you have a kitchen right?”
Nagini hissed, moving towards her master. She lifted herself up to the windowsill and coiled until she was comfortable in the little bay window.
Blaise sighed, “Sorry Harry, I wish I realized sooner. But hey, at least you gave him a good punch, right?”
“Friends,” he began, “we gather on a sad and triumphant note.” The crowd of Death Eaters grew quiet, all turning to stare at Harry. “This morning, my father, our Dark Lord, died. He has gone beyond any mortal man to escape death, however in the end, Death had a way of claiming him back. However, though the Dark Lord is gone, his mission, his morals and values will live on. I have succeeded my father; I am your new Dark Lord.”
“Yes Alpha,” Harry smirked. He bent down, getting on all fours as he stuck his ass out and licked Draco’s shoes, cleaning the cum and gathering it in his mouth. Draco grabbed his hair once both shoes were clean, and pulled him up roughly to kiss him, Harry pushing his tongue against Draco, both licking and moaning at the taste of cum.
“No,” Harry hummed, “I think I’ll go spend the day with Ron and Hermione.” He kissed Draco and hopped away. “Be a good boy for me now,” he teased and laughed as he walked away. Draco just stared at Harry, smirking devilishly. “My little boywife, you are going to be in so much trouble during your heat,” he chuckled.
The old god turned to the boys and crossed his arms, “Well,” he said, “let’s go get some Greek food, I’ll think on the way.” And without even looking back on the demon and his lovers, the old god began walking away towards Hollow’s Grave.
“Very well, however, this is the final favor I am ever doing for a Potter,” he sneered. “Expect a letter from me soon with everything I need. Draco, the next time we meet, you better remember your manners.” Mr. Malfoy stood up and left ten galleons on the table before leaving.
“You’ve never told us where your classroom is,” Draco said.
The two shared a kiss before jumping off of the little love seat they were sharing. However, just as they were making their way to the door, it burst open with Blaise running in, looking extremely anxious. “Harry!” he said. “What was the name of the man who came in?”
Ron’s eyes went huge when he understood what Harry was saying. “Bet the slimy bastard felt rather cocky when you told him that,” he muttered.
“Ron! Ron! Wake up! He’s dead—oh god Ron he’s dead! Fred is dead!”
“What’s strange?” Draco asked.
“Hm?”
“Why is he here?” the other asked.
Harry couldn’t help but smile both in pride at how strong his father looked in that moment, and in victory as he saw the fight leave Dumbledore. The old headmaster slumped into his chair, looking defeated.
“Played? Draco I’ve one-hundred-percent each and every one,” Harry boasted.
Ron didn’t answer, instead, he pulled Lavender further, “We’re almost there,” he said.
Feet from the ground, Harry lifted his right hand from his broom, stretching toward the Snitch … to his right, Draco’s arm extended too, reaching, groping…
Harry was glad to be back in Hogwarts. He felt that he was once again safe from his father. He knew that Voldemort would never come to the castle, and so the worst he could do is summon Harry, which he can ignore. As long as he doesn’t use the Shadow Creatures, he is untouchable from Voldemort. He smiled and laughed with his friends throughout the feast, actually being able to ignore Umbridge for once, and when he laid down in his bed, he was happy, full, and exhausted. He closed his eyes and felt like he was sleeping for only a minute when he was abruptly awaken.
“You were the only fun part of Quidditch,” Draco shrugged. “Without you, pet, the game’s pointless.”
He gave a sigh and shook his head. “My cup is empty,” he mentioned.
Harry stared at the mirror for a moment, before understanding what Draco intended. He took the bag and started to apply his makeup again. Ruby mascara with scarlet eyeliner, and a light lavender lipstick that he glided gently across his plump lips. Draco was silent and held the mirror steadily as Harry worked on his face, never talking, or asking questions, just staring at Harry with a soft smile on his face. Lastly, Harry painted his nails with his new rainbow polish, the rainbows swirling around on his nails whenever he moved them.
“Not for a long time…” Lord Voldemort said. He thought for a moment then said, “Your mother’s in fact, was the last time he made a personal visit to the Initiation. Of course, he does not make himself publicly known, just in case the False One’s cultists are near… but his presence can be felt far and wide…”
Harry looked up at that, frowning. “My second gender is not a secret,” he said. “It’s not the world’s business that I’m an Omega.”
“Correct Harry,” Mr. Riddle said, looking proud. Harry felt weird by that look of pride but swallowed it away. “Our Lord is not the biological Father of all Demons, a common mistake spread by the followers of the False One. However, as Harry said, the Dark Lord is father to some demons, the most powerful ones. Demons existed before our Lord, however it was our Lord who brought them together. In this course, we will begin by learning the hierarchy of demons, from the Dark Lord to his Six Generals, The Lords, and the rest… there are too many to list here for an introduction course…”
“Thank you,” Remus smiled. He held out his hand for them to grab. Niall took it while still holding Harry’s. Remus turned to his husband and said, “I’ll take care of them while you get the signature. And please, promise me you’ll behave?”
Harry couldn’t answer. He opened his mouth several times but no noise could come out. He felt cold. His eyes darted around, looking at every face that stared back at him.
“I did, but only after I drove that spike through your head,” Bellatrix replied. “It was supposed to humble you.”
“You know what? I think I do,” Harry said. “you are without a doubt the stupidest, most oblivious witch I’ve ever known.”
Draco didn’t know what to do! It seemed that every single time he spoke, he ended up pissing Harry off. He needed to do something, anything, to show the Omega that Draco was the Alpha for him! Especially after his beautiful display in Potions that left him speechless. They have Ancient Runes together after lunch before Defense Against the Dark Arts, he would have to do something soon.
“Please… let me suck my husband’s cock,” Harry mewled.
“Draco—”
Draco chuckled, “Alright, well I’m off to get the food, you’ve texted me their address right?”
Harry shook his head. “No father, Pansy Parkinson continued to deny that we are related and that I am a slut.” Voldemort nodded and hissed angrily. The lower half of Nagini’s body coiled, the long thick snake pushing itself up until it was almost standing at five feet from the ground. The Slytherins all screamed and back up, Pansy jumping away as Voldemort turned towards her and hissed angrily, showing off Nagini’s deadly fangs. Voldemort turned to Harry, and asked
Harry nodded, “They said she arrived with no letter and looked tired.”
“Maybe,” Theo said, “but a game of chess might fix that.”
“Yes, minister,” Mr. Riddle nodded. “Dumbledore lied to two people who cared very much for Harrison, both of whom through no fault of their own added the Alpha Protein to Harrison’s food daily for some time.”
“Perhaps, yet Harry you must understand that Voldemort delved into Dark Magic that many have not survived,” Dumbledore said. “He has lost more than any innocence in his descent.” Harry felt a prick once more in his forehead and frowned.
“Yeah, but not as obsessed as he is,” Harry said. “We know that there’s something biological inside us, Draco and I, that sort of intensifies our feelings for one another, and it is somehow connected to the moon, be it a monthly thing or tied into lycanthropy. That’s why, while yeah we’re dating, we’re sort of far more advanced in our relationship than normal. I mean, honestly we’ve only been dating for a few months and are acting like we’ve been doing this for years.”
“I guess,” Harry frowned. He looked at his necklace and held it tight wanting nothing more but to be with Draco.
“We love you too, now get on,” Remus smiled. The family shared a final hug before Niall took Harry’s hand and the two boarded the boat.
“What are we going to do?” Draco moaned.
Pain shot through his own mark, and Mr. Malfoy gritted his teeth as their marks burned black. Harry watched as one by one they appeared before him, apparating into the room in their dark robes, looking around for their Lord. Harry’s eyes fell upon the crowd, making sure that it worked as he intended. Among the sea of Death Eaters, there was no oily black hair, no hooked no, no consistent sneer. Severus Snape was not part of those who gathered. He smirked at this and motioned for Mr. Malfoy to step away.
“What do you want to try?” Niall asked as he moved the both of them towards a bench so they can sit down, still holding onto each other.
Ch. 6
“Better, now we can go,” Draco smiled. The bag shrank and Harry pocketed. They held close together and Draco activated the Portkey.
“Alright, sounds good,” Draco shrugged. Harry’s grin broadened and lead Draco to his room on the second floor. As they stepped in, Draco couldn’t help but look around, frowning. “This won’t do,” he muttered. “The Dark Lord placed you in one of the smaller guest rooms.”
“Okay, I will Harry,” Neville nodded. He stood up and saw Dean and Seamus, “I’ll start right now!”
“Yeah,” Harry groaned, opening his eyes. “Please Connor—Look out!” But Harry’s warning came too late. Connor only had time to turn his head as the man leapt on top of him The two rolled away from Harry, and Connor’s screams filled the air as the man bit into his neck, blood pooling quickly. The man pulled and smirked at his work. The kid will turn, yes, but he’ll live or die on the account of his will… Potter, however, he’ll want Potter to live.
“You’re wrong!” Harry screamed, standing up so quickly his chair almost fell. “You’re wrong! You kidnapped me! Not my father! Nagini found me one day after the Dursleys abused me, I was running away because of the article Skeeter wrote about me—the article that you helped write because you told her everything!”
“You’ll stay here obviously,” Ron shrugged. Harry frowned at this but said nothing. Instead he looked at the two of them for a moment. Then it hit him, “Crap! I forgot about Ginny!”
“That is slander!” Dumbledore yelled.
There was a cage in the corner of the basement behind a large stack of old yet expensive looking furniture. In the cage were an endless supply of rats it seemed. “Wormtail will be useful even in death,” the Dark Lord commented before taking a rat. He forced the rodent’s mouth opened and forced the poison in it. The rat squealed as Voldemort held it by it’s tail. It thrashed and struggled, it’s black beady eyes looking to strain before droplets of blood seeped out of the corner, and its movement stopped.
“Of course, it’ll take more than a bloody Bludger to hurt you,” a voice sneered. Harry turned around to see that Draco has landed close by, his face contorted in anger, not at Harry, but at Crabbe. “What was that idiot thinking?” he went on, “He would have to do better than that to even think of hurting you—of course he would then answer to me.”
“I understand,” Harry nodded. “So, let’s just keep this between us for now.” He picked the snake up and placed it on the table. “Come on, let’s just forget about it for now and meet up with my brother.”
They were in a circular room with many doors. She led Harry to a room with a nameplate on it that read
“But it is the Dark Lord’s will, our god—”
“Can I come with you?” Hermione asked, standing up as well. “No offense, but I don’t think I want to be alone with them.”
“We have a few ideas,” Voldemort hummed, “however nothing concrete.” Harry nodded and found that his mind quickly drawn a blank. He looked at the two and bit his lower lip.
“They’re my friends, so why not,” Draco shrugged. “Parkinson, get out.”
“I’m sorry but what’s interesting?” Harry asked.
“Yeah!” Harry nodded enthusiastically. Draco pressed his wand against Harry’s neck, and the boy felt the familiar weight of black leather encircling his neck.
Night approached quickly as Harry stayed in his room all day. His body starting to fill with nerves, Harry started pacing the room instead of reading the dark scriptures as he was supposed to be doing. Loki followed him with his eyes, sitting on Harry’s bed. The moon started to rise, and Uncle Sirius knocked on Harry’s door, telling him to dress for the Dark Initiation.
Harry’s heart was thumping uncontrollably. He knew that voice, but he did not lower his wand.
“Mandatory, huh?” Blaise commented.
“To take back what has been stolen from us,” Voldemort said. “We deserve to be superior Harry, we deserve to rule. We were forced to hide, forced to cower into our mansions, our homes and shamed for who we are. For too long have we been in the dark, hidden away like a secret, our gifts excused and turned into myths and fairy tales. We wizards are superior, Harry. Superior to all. To house-elves, to centaurs, to merfolk and especially muggles. Muggles, who do not even know our existence—muggles who we have to hide because our governments would rather have us secreted away instead of being in our rightful place, higher above muggles, ruling over muggles. The Wizarding community have lost touch with our roots, our traditions, like your Submissive Clause that you love so much Harry. Together we will rule over wizards and muggles, humans and magical creatures. We will bring back our hierarchy, and we will have what we are deserved.” There was a passionate glint in Voldemort’s eyes. “This was what we were working for, this was what Alphard and I spent our lives for—I have lost too much to stop now. You will see Harry, I see my Alphard in you—you will learn to think like him, you’ve already have.
Harry swore loudly when the knife pierced his arm. He had no idea what he was thinking, that there wouldn’t be pain in this process. Voldemort made him cut his arm over the stone cauldron, and he immediately regretted his decision at the first second the sharp point of the silver knife met his skin. Poking instantly and drops of blood already peaking out, connecting with the knife and pooling slightly. Harry did not want to move, he did not want the knife to hurt him more. He just stood there in pain, failing to bite back swears.
“Wasn’t your fault mate,” Ron shrugged. “Oh! Hermione!” He jumped up and swelled his chest, “I didn’t write to you about this because I wanted to tell you in public, with Harry as my witness. I’m an—” Ron stopped. His nose twitched and he stared at Hermione. Hermione stared at him. Ron’s face drained and Harry felt like he could see his friend’s soul leave his body. “No,” he whispered. “No—Hermione you! You!”
“Yeah they’re a little strict—”
“I remember it took your father a month to get Lily’s parents’ approval,” Uncle Remus said. “They were concerned about his… mischievous behaviors. It took James a week of showing up at their house for dinner and behaving like a proper gentleman to get their approval, you remember Sirius?”
“Students raise their hands when they wish to speak in my class, Mr.—?”
embroidered into it. “Master says you are not welcomed,” the house-elf said.
“It was obvious from the way we fought,” Voldemort chuckled. “Speaking of which, where is your wand, Harry?”
“There is my pup,” Voldemort smiled, opening his arms. Remus automatically moved and wrapped his arms around Voldemort, burying his head in the crook of Voldemort’s neck.
Magic filled the air, their own magic. It swirled and danced around each other, tangling, and morphing into a single entity before falling down into the Alpha and his omega. They continued to cum and continued to bite as they rode out this magical high until their last spirts of cum dribbled from their cocks. Finally, they moved from the other’s neck and stared at each other. Their lips were bloodied, and faces were soaked with sweat. Smiling to each other, they kissed, the blood still in their mouths mixing with each other as they swallowed. They moved slightly, so that Harry could sit comfortably with Draco’s knotted cock still in him. Panting heavily, they smiled as their instincts informed the two of them what happened. “Mate,” Harry breathed.
Voldemort ignored Travers as man stretched out a long boney arm.
“Yeah, I have the rest of the day off,” Harry smiled.
Draco was checking himself in the mirror before turning to Ron, who was spread out on his bed, “So what do you think?” he asked.
The last thing he heard was Kingsley promising to get Dumbledore, then all went dark.
“Come back tomorrow same time children,” Mr. Riddle ordered before leaving with his wife.
“Uh, kind of,” Ron said, his face redder than his hair. He finally sat up and looked at the two, telling them what happened. “And then I followed the smell to Terry Boot! And instead of flirting and anything I just ran away like a coward! God, what kind of Alpha am I?”
Theo decided to talk with Ron the same day that Harry talked with him after classes. He and Blaise made sure to visit the kitchen, and Theo had the house-elves get him two pumpkin pasties. He found Ron with Hermione, Harry and Draco. Harry and Draco walked away together, and the boys swooped in onto the two Gryffindors. “Ron!” Theo smiled.
“He has? How very nice of him,” Niall hummed.
Mrs. Weasley frowned. She looked at Harry for a long time, as though she was debating if she should believe what he said or not before turning to Ginny. Ginny still stood tall and took a few steps towards them. “Ginny,” Mrs. Weasley said carefully, her voice still sharp but not as angry as when she yelled Harry’s name. “This all true?”
“Is he now?” Mr. Malfoy asked, sounding completely disappointed. “Then I suppose you two better sit.” Draco pulled the chair out for Harry, which the Omega smiled at before he sat himself. Mr. Malfoy watched them for a moment, slowly taking a sip of his drink, before addressing Harry. “You are a complete virgin?” he asked.
Harry spent the day practicing the Cruciatus Curse. In the beginning, he flinched every time the muggles screamed but as the day went on, the screamed started to deafen to him, they became less and less important. He had the rage needed for the spell, Harry found that it was easier to find it, easier to be angry and fuel his magic with it. By the end of the day, he was tired from casting the curse constantly and the two muggles where laying on the floor, twitching and convulsing as they muttered madness.
“Even if your mark did not miraculously missed, if it was against any other opponent you would have killed him Harry,” Voldemort said in a surprisingly soft voice. He paused then said, “There are a lot about the Dark Arts that is unknown by the light, only those who know of the darkest dwellings will venture in, and those who do not generally stay away. I would not die if you hit me with your Curse, as I did not die when you killed Quirrell four years ago. I am immortal, I’ve taken the steps to become this, and so I have found a way to become above everyone, superior.
“But Master Draco, sir!” the house-elf insisted. “Topsy has been ordered by him!” Draco stopped. He turned on his heels and stared at the house-elf. Topsy trembled, his large eyes already looking around for something to punish himself with.
Draco gave him a sharp look while Harry frowned in thought. “A heaviness,” he said. “There was this heaviness in me that was trying to drag me towards it. I don’t know if you’ve felt it also Draco,” he asked, turning to his boyfriend.
“This is his order?” Draco repeated. He thought for a moment then looked down at the house-elf. “Tell
Harry needed answers, but knew that he would never get them from the source. He saw, with some interest, that Sirius was related to Tonks… whose name was not on there, but her mother’s was, her portrait burned just like Sirius’s. And next to Tonk’s mother, connected to the name Narcissa, was Lucius Malfoy, and a golden thread that led to Draco. “You’re related to Malfoy!” he said.
“Okay,” Harry nodded. “Can Draco join as well?” he asked, thinking that it would be better if Draco gets out and play a bit with them. Ginny’s expression hardened and gave no answer. Instead she just took her basket and followed after Mrs. Weasley.
“Really? I didn’t know that,” Harry said.
She needed to figure out a foolproof plan on killing Harry Potter… and this time, she was going to do it personally.
“I am going to have to fight him eventually… along with all your parents,” He said grimly.
“Weasley?” Boot repeated.
“Your pizza, you’re holding it wrong,” Harry said. “You’re supposed to fold the crust, pretty.” He held his own pizza for emphasis.
Hogsmeade
“Did he?” he asked.
“Is that a threat?”
“Ronald!” Hermione shrieked. “Now insensitive can you be—no wonder Harry was worried when he told me!”
“Well, now you have all of it,” Harry smiled.
“Are you calling my baby girl Kari a negative point of the series?” Harry demanded.
“My Lord if I may, your wife and you—”
Harry begged silently. Some way beyond him, glinting in the starlight, lay the Triwizard Cup. Harry’s wand was on the ground at Cedric’s feet. The bundle of robes was close by, at the foot of the grave. It seemed to be stirring fretfully. Harry watched it, and his scar seared with pain again.
Harry stepped to chase after, but Hermione stopped him. “I’ll talk to her,” she said, getting off the bed. “In the meantime, why don’t you two try to make Malfoy understand what’s going on here?”
Harry led the two to the stump, neither of them talking until they finally reached it. The trees were thicker than ever, the leaves blowing in the fall wind, all a different array of oranges and reds and yellows, all still holding strong onto the branches above, blocking most of the sunlight. Around them, the essence watched amused and curious as the three stood before the stump.
“Come on, Harry, haven’t you seen enough of this house to tell what kind of wizards my family were?” Sirius said testily.
“Seriously?” Hermione balked. “You can’t do that.”
“Remus—”
“I love you too Draco,” Harry said. They smiled and Draco pushed Harry to the floor, pulling his pants off as the raven-haired teen laugh. “You going to show me your love with your cock?” he smirked.
Harry shook his head, “Can we stay up instead?” he asked. “And just… talk. It’s been a while, just the two of us.”
“Yeah! Where have you been living?”
Neville’s breath hitched. Niall stayed where he was, pressing slightly against Neville. His hand still on Neville’s ass and against the brick wall as his other hand petted Neville’s hair softly. Neville shuddered and licked his lips slightly. His eyes met Niall’s and he slowly raised his hand to the Alpha’s auburn hair. “Yes,” he breathed as he combed through Niall’s hand.
“You nervous? ‘Bout next week?” Ginny asked.
Harry didn’t dare move until he was sure that Uncle Vernon was downstairs. He ran to the bathroom and took off his shirt to look at the new damage Uncle Vernon caused. His pale skin was marred with bruises and scars. There were deep red buckle imprints everywhere Uncle Vernon hit, some bleeding while others did not. With his wand and all other magical stuff locked in the cupboard, Harry had no way of healing these new marks. Instead, there was a bottle of hydrogen peroxide and a bag of cotton swabs. He grabbed both and sat on the toilet as he dipped the chemical onto the cotton swab and pressed the wet swab against his new cuts. He hissed at the bubbling sting; tears threatened to fall down once more. He kept the pressure until the bleeding stopped, then he moved to the next one. Afterward, he put everything away and flushed the swabs down because Aunt Petunia
“Draco?”
“Maybe, I don’t know,” Harry shrugged. He shook his head, “Look just write your letter, okay?”
“I am, sir,” Draco said in a strained voice, glancing up at Voldemort, both he and Harry feared for what he was planning.
“In other words, Harry,” Dumbledore said, “I believe that a proper working definition of ‘Omega’ for what we know of it, is a werewolf, or a male with werewolf attributions, who has the ability to get pregnant.’ As for you, Draco, the Alpha is naturally the one who can impregnant the Omega. You must have pheromones that secrete naturally that allows for the attraction of an omega, in this case Harry. Which can be troublesome when taking consent into the issue.”
“What?” Draco blinked, and separated from Harry. He stared at Harry who cocked his head slightly.
“NO!” Draco roared. “You are mine!”
Part XVII
“You’re being ridiculous,” Niall muttered. “We tell each other everything.”
It was getting dark outside when Harry finally stood up, stretching slightly. “I have to go look for my friends,” he said.
The bats all fell to the group cut in half before disappearing. Angry, Harry looked up at Ginny, who ran away. Huffing, Harry followed her out and returned to the kitchen to get the rest of his letter. Inside was just the list of his next school supplies. Shrugging, he decided to look for the others.
“Draco!” Daphne snapped, “That’s enough. Ron’s alright, he’s just worried.” She turned to Ron and shook her head, “Stuff happened, Draco’s fine now, and it’s only up to him if he wants to share about what happened. Do not press him. Understand?”
“Okay, we’ll go,” he said.
“Except the eyes. Lily’s eyes.”
“She will get what’s coming to her, Niall, believe me,” Harry said. “I just need time.”
Harry heard movement to his left and looked up to see Remus standing, looking uncertain. “I can explain how Harry found his way to Lily and James, Minister,” he said.
Harry took the vial and frowned. He glanced up at Voldemort. “You will heal me as soon as I stop bleeding?” he asked.
Dominance
“They do?” Ron asked. Harry nodded and Ron groaned, “I have to think of flower meanings?”
The Wizengamot agreed and Harry felt nervous at being suddenly thrust into the hot seat. Mr. Riddle shook his head. “Honestly, Dumbledore shall you continue to use my son even now? Harrison does not need to prove anything, it is not him or me who is on trial, but you, Dumbledore. We are here so you can finally answer to your years of neglect and abuse! Not to question my son’s interest in my research!”
“He is right Harry,” Viktor said. He took Harry gently and pulled him to the side. “I don’t want you getting hurt or harassed here Harry. You or your brother. Go home, I’ll visit you as soon as I win, and you know that I’ll always keep writing to you and Niall.”
The boys in the dormitory were sleeping, all the beds taken. Harry ignored them all except for one where a teen with platinum blonde hair laid. “Draco,” he said, rushing to his love. A light was turned on. The others rose groggily to see Harry standing by Draco’s bed.
“I know,” Harry said and for the first time that Draco could remember, Harry gave him a small smile.
“Whatever,” Draco scoffed. “Just watch, Potter will run from it. You’ll see.” Nott didn’t look convinced and just shook his head. Draco made a face and looked back at the door, secretly hoping that he was wrong.
“Good boy.”
Borrowed the ending from the book but it's worth it.
The second day was a repeat of the first with Harry making breakfast for his father and him before the two went downstairs for Harry to practice the Dark Arts. Harry noticed that it was different muggles today, younger, and did not want to question where the other two went. By the end of the day he was sweating and looked at his father before pointing his wand at the younger of the two muggles.
Umbridge, thankfully, wasn’t waiting for him as he left the spiraling staircase. He went to the Great Hall, as he was hungry, and it was still breakfast time. As he sat down, Ron asked him what he and Hermione wanted to do.
Harry hid his frown. Instead, doing his best to separate himself from his emotions, he kept his gaze on Voldemort. “What would happen,” he asked, “if you died… but you still had your Horcruxes?”
“Well, first the doves up there didn’t believe me when I said that He’s my grandfather, and second Samhain is my father’s favorite holiday. I want to make sure he does nothing today,” Blaise said.
“No, my son, I am surprised,” Voldemort said. “Stand and greet your father properly now.” He opened his arms. Harry stood and went to his father, feeling a chill as they hugged. “This is how it should be, us together as father and son,” Voldemort said. He let go of Harry and sat down, motioning for Harry to sit with him. Harry sat down and the two stared at each other for a moment.
Draco fidgeted in front of the mirror in his dorm. He was dressed for the party and, after three long days and what felt like a longer shower, he finally had a chance to look at himself.
“Excellent decision,” Mr. Malfoy said.
“No it’s called having little manners,” Hermione huffed. “You’re just lucky that Boot liked that.”
Draco shook his head, “At least I’m not wearing one of the badges the others have, give me that much at least.”
Harry’s mind went off at the name Alphard, he wanted to ask more, but knew better not to. Instead, he would ask his Lord at the earliest convenient. “Why did you leave?” he instead asked.
“Still it’s a reckless decision,” Draco shrugged. Harry sighed and fell back to his bed.
“That’s the only good smell you have,” Harry smirked.
“Draco,” Harry whispered, equally impressed and afraid. “I’m going to yell at you for using me like that later on… but for now, I’m very impressed.”
He handed the badge to Harry, who read out what was etched out on it:
“Make the wound bigger, I need your blood,
his mind went wild.
“It was Nagini, my father’s snake,” he said. “he must have used the shadows to get her in here. But, why didn’t I see him? Why didn’t I have a vision to—”
“Oh! Is it about the medicine? Dobby hopes they are working, Harry Potter!” Dobby said excitedly. “Look!” He ran off to one of the cupboards and pulled out a large container. He carried to Harry and opened it, “Dobby is helping Harry Potter sir get better!” the house-elf said with pride. “Dobby is putting it on Harry Potter’s seat just as Headmaster Dumbledore told Dobby!”
Harry nodded, his spirits lifting quickly as Professor McGonagall bent slightly to write in the empty space on the piece of parchment in front of her. She finished quickly and placed the parchment away. “Is there anything else you require?” she asked.
“My name is Sirius Black,” the Alpha introduced himself, “and he is my mate, Remus. We honestly were on your way to your relatives’ home right now, for this.” He pulled out a piece of paper and smiled at the boys. “We want to bring you home, our home.”
“Sorry. Riddle.”
Harry screamed at the invasion, his insides felt as though they were on fire, the burning sensation growing more and more painful the further Draco pushed. He wanted it to stop only for a moment until, with a loud wet pop, the head of Draco’s cock pushed through and into him, the rest of his large cock joining. The pain went away. It felt wonderful. It felt right, like a key pushing into the lock it was made for, or more appropriately, into the lock that was made for the key. “I’m yours,” Harry wept, his legs wrapping around Draco as he reached out for his Alpha, “I’m yours, I’m yours,” he cried out.
“Yes sir,” Harry said.
, and to make matters worse, Harry cursed him, so his tongue was frozen to the roof of his mouth!
Harry heard a hissing sound as Moody lit old fashion lamps all along the walls with his wand, casting a flickering insubstantial light over the peeling wallpaper rand threadbare carpet of a long, gloomy hallway, where a cobwebby chandelier glimmered overhead and age-blackened portraits hung crooked on the walls. Harry heard something scuttling behind the baseboard.
“More importantly, what is going to happen during the full moon?” Theo asked. “You’re not going to stay in the castle, are you?”
“Daphne? Draco—the hell is going on?”
“Yeah of course I am, didn’t you know they speak English?” Harry asked, turning his head to the side slightly.
....The writers of Sabrina stole my idea lmao
“You’ll accept anything I give you and you will like it,” Harry said, giving his brother a grin. “Anyway, have you made any friends yet in your House?”
Harry noticed that there were no ‘Outstandings’ on Ron’s score, while he only got an ‘Outstanding’ on Defense Against the Dark Arts. “Knew you’d be top at Defense Against the Dark Arts,” Ron said, patting Harry on his shoulder. “We’ve done all right, haven’t we?”
He leaned forward and inhaled Remus’ scent. It calmed the Alpha immensely and he smiled softly as he found his eyes closing, and he too soon fell into a peaceful sleep.
“I do not care,” Harry replied. He looked up at Draco then back at the snake. “My master… my lover commanded me to bring you out, so I will!” Draco smiled at being called Harry’s master. He patted Harry’s shoulder and looked to where he was staring at. He saw nothing. Still the darkness did not shift. Frustrated, Harry yelled out, “I am your master’s son! His blood runs in my veins now! My will is his, and I demand that you show ourselves!”
Surprisingly, Malfoy did. In fact, he stayed quiet throughout all of breakfast and most of the day. In classes, Malfoy barely talked to him, or anyone really, and he seemed oddly quiet in that he didn’t look mad or angry at all. Harry paid him little mind as he was dreading his third night of detention with Umbridge, so he did not notice when, an hour before he and Niall were supposed to go to Umbridge’s office, Draco Malfoy pulled his twin to the side.
“Rise Snape, I require information,” Voldemort said. “Tell me all you know about the Weasleys.”
“Diggory and those pranksters huh?” Blaise said.
TOM RIDDLE
Harry stopped for a moment. His hand ached but he shook his head, “Y-Yeah, just lines,” he muttered.
Harry realized that he had been stationary in midair for more than a minute watching the progress of the match without sparing a thought for the whereabouts of the Snitch; horrified, he went into a dive and started circling the pitch again, staring around, trying to ignore the chorus now thundering through the stadium:
“Oh.”
“Why would I be jealous of a dead man?” Mr. Malfoy scoffed. “Besides, that wife of his was subpar. Her whole family was. The Evans were an embarrassment to our church, I for one am glad they are gone.”
“But before that, presents!” Uncle Sirius cheered like a little kid. “Come on Harry! Open them, open them!”
“WHAT!” Harry screamed.
“Cedric Diggory,” Theo said, “from what I heard, he’s dating your brothers now.”
“Yeah,” Harry groaned.
“No, I need you to deshell the sausage,” Draco said, putting the packages of sausage in front of Harry as well as two large bowls. He showed Harry how to do it and watched him for a moment to make sure he got it. He was right, Harry was good with his hands, He effortlessly pulled the meat out of the casings, winking at Draco all the while with a smug smirk. “I had a few experiences with sausage,” he teased.
Draco glanced back to see a beautiful woman walk in, looking annoyed. “I ‘ave ‘eard zat woman yelling and came to find out why,” she said. “’Arry, I ‘eard you ran away for some shopping?”
“Uh, I’ll eat it,” Neville said softly. Another change that Harry never realized was that the other sixth-years ate with them again. Neville was sitting between Parvati and Seamus, directly in front of Harry. The Omega looked up at Neville than blushed, “You sure?” he asked.
“I love you, Remus,” he said.
“Sod off, let go of me!” Harry struggled. Greyback squeezed Harry’s ankle, and the teen screamed as he could feel his bones reaching a breaking point.
Part XXIII
When the two returned to the Great Hall, Blaise just greeted them with a raised eyebrow and a kiss for Theo as Malfoy just looked between the two of them. “Where were you?” he asked.
“Better,” Draco said, “Ron cured my hangover.”
“We’ve been dating since the summer… sir,” Harry said, looking at Mr. Malfoy and talking politely, “and we’re going to marry one day… using the Submissive Clause.”
“Clever, Yaxley,” Harry said. “I am not a person who’ll pretend to know more than he does. Why do you think I asked you for information?”
Harry lived with his uncles in a town called Hollow’s Grave, an ominous sounding town which was populated mostly of witches and warlocks of their coven… along with a family of mortals. The family of mortals knew about the witches and warlocks, and about their coven, but all in all, they don’t bother the coven as it seemed too much of a bother. Besides, all the police were warlocks, so they can’t think of calling them.
“Don’t die on me Potter, you’re much too hot and interesting,” Draco chuckled, his eyes moving from Harry’s face to his muscled pecs. Harry grinned.
“Morning Ron! Morning Draco!” Neville said merrily behind the counter, “What can I get you?”
Sirius sighed, “I know, but we’ve already lost. The most we can do is just get through the shopping quickly.” He gave the twins their letters and Harry thought that his fingers would burn just by holding them. “We have most of the summer to get you boys ready, come on.” He looked completely defeated and Harry felt his heart break in two.
I'm low on serotonin.... I have a feeling this is a generational mood.
“I must say, does the Dark Lord know that you are here?” Yaxley asked openly, “after that disrespectful show of last night, I am honestly surprise to see you out of your manor.”
He worried. It was a nonsense worry, he knew. He had Draco’s necklace, and they were his friends. Yet the thought of sleeping with four Alphas surrounding him scared Harry even though it was baseless.
“That it, little bitch?” Greyback laughed, his voice echoing around the trees. “That is all you have. I thought the great Harry Potter would give more of a chase.”
Harry hesitated then knocked.
“I guess so, Alpha,” Harry mewled. He looked at the three then back at Draco. He decided that it would be better to tell Draco about the food when they were alone. Instead, he turned to the three friends and decided that he wanted to know them more. Relaxing against his Alpha, he pulled Draco’s free hand onto his lap and played with it as he talked with Blaise, Theo, and Daphne.
“It was,” Ron answered, sitting a little too close as they sat down at the Gryffindor’s table. “Neville got a Remembrall from his grandmother, and the same day we had our first flying lessons. Neville couldn’t control a broomstick at all and he fell and broke his wrist! Malfoy stole Neville’s Remembrall after that and flew up and threw it at the top of a tree.”
“No,” Harry interrupted Mrs. Weasley, “it’s because
(See the end of the chapter for
“This place is gigantic,” Harry whispered, feeling very small all of a sudden.
The man sputtered angrily at them as Sirius sighed, “This, is our Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge. Along with Albus Dumbledore, Hogwarts’ headmaster.”
“And me in the office,” Uncle Sirius said. “Just some tidying up with files and whatnot… but before that, boys, I believe we all need to have a proper sit and—”
“Silence demon,” Mr. Riddle barked. “Potter, why have you summoned this demon?”
Draco’s face changed, flickering into something Harry couldn’t read for a moment before becoming normal again. “I see,” was all he said, before saying, “I am arranged to marry the younger Greengrass for some reason, I keep forgetting her name, I’ve barely heard of her.”
“Don’t worry, we’ll be fine by ourselves, right Granger?” Zabini said, smiling at Hermione.
“This will keep track of you, boy,” Voldemort said. “Your actions will develop your Mark until it has formed fully into the mark of my apprentice. You should feel honored, Harry, for you are the second person to be gifted with this.”
“You were attacked,” Kingsley said, “do you remember any details?”
“You punched me,” Ron argued.
Sirius gave a dry chuckle. “They’re for you two,” he said coldly. “I am so sorry boys. But these are your Hogwarts letters.”
“Draco told us… after the Yule Ball,” Daphne said, glancing at Draco, who gave a short nod. “Pansy… Draco’s bisexual.”
“What happened?” Hermione asked.
“Minister,” Niall said in a hard voice. “Harry and I were at the top of our classes in Durmstrang. We were model students, always getting the highest scores. That trend appeared to continue here in Hogwarts until it came to Professor Umbridge’s excuse of a class. All she did was made us read from a useless book with no actual practice of what we are supposed to be learning. Harry and I brought this up and we were rewarded with torture, Minister!” Niall yelled and held his hand up. “Look at me straight in the face, Fudge, and tell me that carving words into my hand is appropriate punishment!”
Draco’s eyes flashed with recognition, and a superior look replaced his shock. “I see,” he said, he looked towards Nott and smirked, “Potter here’s desperate for command. So much so that he joined our side just so he can lick my boots.”
Harry and Draco separated in the Great hall, kissing each other goodbye. Harry kept his head high as he walked to the Gryffindor Table, finding Ron and Hermione, and sitting between them immediately. “Hello,” he said.
“Nah, I’ve caused too much trouble,” Harry said.
“Get on with it!” Voldemort demanded. “I will heal your wound as soon as I have enough blood.”
“Dully noted,” Mr. Riddle said, “if that is all, return to your classes.” The three stood up and Mr. Riddle watched them leave before giving a victorious smirk. “This is it Nagini!” he said, and from the shadows his wife slithered in. “Potter is to be married—the Dark Lord will visit him the night before and take his virginity as is the Dark Lord’s custom! We must make sure that in that union, a child is made.” He moved quickly to his desk, taking a pen and writing frantically on a piece of paper. “Go, get these ingredients. We shall lace everything the boy eats here with a pregnancy potion—two months of consumption will guarantee the boy to have a womb begging to be bred by our Lord Lucifer.” He stayed quiet for a moment to finish his list before handing it to his wife. “Go! Now!” he said, “There is no time to lose! I will make sure that Potter is pregnant, and his child will be our Lord’s.”
Exhausted and wanting nothing but his bed, Harry led Draco and Blaise by the hand to his room where they undressed and slipped into bed as husbands; Blaise in the middle with Draco and Harry laying on him, their hands held while Blaise’s arms were holding their shoulders. “So my beautiful mages,” Blaise said sleepily, “what big adventure should we do next?”
A confident smirk passed Harry’s lips, “Two more dates,” he said.
“Oh, oh yes I see,” Minister Scrimgeour muttered, frowning at the small stack of papers as though reading them would be the worst task in the world. He looked around the Wizengamot. “Did anyone else read Mr. Riddle’s charges fully?”
“Yes, yes…” the shopkeeper chuckled. He bent down and pulled out two jars in which slabs of flesh floated in. “They will do… for a price.”
“Why? Why would he want to do that? Think about this Harry, Voldemort is a Dark Lord. Why would Dumbledore need to result to kidnapping to get Voldemort?” Hermione demanded.
“Calm down Harry,” Draco hushed, glancing towards Mr. and Mrs. Riddle. Mr. Riddle was addressing their classmates whiles Mrs. Riddle was staring at them, her odd yellow eyes unblinking. “We will get him, yes, but first we have to deal with the bigger threat. So until then, as much as I hate it, we have to stomach through this.”
“I do.”
“I don’t know, everything I guess,” Harry shrugged. “Just woke up feeling strange.”
The sun was giving way to the night sky when Harry’s tears started to slow down, and he heard something hissing around him.
Mr. Riddle placed the suit back and looked over the teens. “Now, you will each be paired by my wife,” he said. It was only now that Harry noticed that Mrs. Riddle, the silent, creepy wife of Mr. Riddle, was in the church, standing perfectly still in the shadows, her eyes seemingly slithering from person to person before stepping forward. Her steps even and practiced. Her hair was in several long strands, reminding Harry of the story of Medusa and her serpents.
“And thank you, Harry, for confiding in us,” Dumbledore said, giving him a smile.
“Okay,” Draco nodded, “just uh, let me unpack and shower first? I’ve driven for three days straight.”
“Of course, Harry,” Draco said, he spread his legs and stood slightly so Harry could pull his pants and underwear down, revealing his cock. It was meticulous and beautiful, much like Harry’s husband. Thick, and bigger than Harry’s, the uncut cock had a little patch of trimmed blonde pubic hair, and two big balls that hung underneath, clean and full of cum, letting off a scent that drove Harry wild. He licked the ball sack slowly, moaning at the dirty, perverted taste that filled his tongue. This was his first and only cock, and he was already addicted.
Both boys scoffed but were left speechless. They changed into workout clothes that they did not mind sweating in, Draco’s shirt hugging his lithe figure. “You coming Daphne?” Ron asked.
“I don’t know,” Harry drawled, “I might be busy that day.” Draco’s hand moved to Harry’s ass and squeezed roughly. “Ow! I’m kidding,” he said.
“All that to become pretty?” Moody grunted. “Sounds wasteful.”
“Goodnight… father,” Harry said a little awkwardly and left. Voldemort turned to Draco, who bowed his head.
“You guys shopped together?” Neville asked.
“Accidental deaths, if I remember the muggle report,” Mr. Riddle countered. “Their house burned down to faulty electricity or something. Whatever the muggles use to power their appliances.” The Wizengamot nodded.
“Yes Lucius, for today my sixteen years of searching is finally complete,” the Alpha declared. “My son has finally come home after being stolen away by thieves.”
“Good boys,” Sirius smiled. He pulled them both into a hug, burying his head in both their necks. “I’ll see you at Christmas,” he promised.
He stood up and took a breath, “I’ll talk to you guys when it’s done,” he said.
“Oh?” Dumbledore asked, looking worried. “What?”
Hermione frowned, she hesitated and looked between Ron and Harry. “Harry, this is dangerous, I don’t know,” she said. “Dumbledore—”
Mrs. Malfoy stared at Harry, “Even so none of them will be there, so it is pointless to think of them,” she said. “Now, about your good friends. Pansy Parkinson and Daphne Greengrass, Blaise Zabini and Theodore Nott will be seated nearby, with Daphne’s younger sister, Astoria. During the dancing portion, you and Draco will have a dance each with the three girls—”
“Do what?” Harry asked.
“Then we should tell him!”
The Krums and Potter twins froze. “Potter? Niall Potter? Is that really him?”
“Potter?”
“I did, scared me too,” Niall nodded. “Honestly, I’m surprised you were able to convince him, Harry.”
Professor McGonagall’s frown deepened. “I must admit that I find this extremely surprising, Mr. Potter. As I have told you before, you are not on any particular career path. The classes you are taking for N.E.W.T. are decided to help you achieve whichever career goal you have. These classes are prerequisites, yes, however as I have told you before the classes are not specified. You wish to study the fundamentals and developments of Magic, as well as the classification of new and old spells, am I understanding correctly?”
Draco was surprised to actually be interested in Professor Lupin’s explanation. He actually took notes, preferring the old school method of using a pen and notebook just as Harry he saw, and an hour passed by too quickly for Draco to like. Professor Lupin dismissed them, and as Draco was packing up, he saw Harry staring at him. “What?” he asked.
“We’re not going to use magic?” the redheaded omega ejaculated loudly.
THE END
Harry looked down at his bloodied arm and sighed, as much as he wanted to fall onto Draco’s bed and breath in his scent, he didn’t want to dirty any part of his boyfriend’s room. Taking his robe sleeve, he pulled it up and walked towards the nearest door he could see, assuming that, like any rich prat, Draco had a private bathroom. It took Harry three tries,
“Yes, my lord,” Mr. Malfoy muttered. Draco did not look pleased at all. Mrs. Malfoy, apparently sensing some tension in the air, asked, “Will Harry, err Harrison have free reign of our home?”
“Oh,” was all Draco said, both embarrassed and a little disinterested. He both wanted and didn’t want to go back into the dating world. It was too soon. He only got away from Theo, breaking up for good with the young man only two weeks before his fleeing—no, moving to New York for Hogwarts. He started to rub his hands on his wrist subconsciously as he followed Ron down the street.
“Oh, that is complete shit Malfoy, and you know it!” Uncle Sirius said. “You’re just jealous because James was always a better dueler than you and next in line to be High Priest!”
“But Harry—”
the snake said.
“Lovely,” the nurse said.
“They were mean,” Harry said in a small voice.
“Good, now that that is settled, let us eat,” Voldemort said, and he took the first bite. Harry followed. The food was good, and he smiled at the taste. This was the first real dinner he had since he left Hogwarts. The Malfoys followed for a while. Mrs. Malfoy looked up at Harry and Voldemort. “My Lord,” she started, “does your, I do not mean disrespect but—”
“Are you sure?” Hermione asked.
“Just say that you’re scared of carrying to term!” Uncle Sirius demanded.
“Hang on, does that mean that the prophecy the
Harry nodded. His face was wet with tears; however, he didn’t want to clean it. He shut his eyes tightly and took deep breaths. “He needed me, Voldemort,” he continued after a minute. “He needed my blood, more of my blood, and he needed me to have his blood…”
“So, you will do it?” Harry asked.
He handed it to Harry. “This is the Obedience Potion,” he said. “You will put it in your muggle relatives’ food tomorrow.” Harry hid his frowned but took the potion anyway.
The boy’s eyes widened and immediately walked in. “I didn’t know Potter was Draco’s boyfriend.”
The rest of their dinner was filled with double meanings and innuendos sprinkled between jokes and childhood stories. Draco told Harry every good memory that involved his grandparents or Daphne as they came to mind as Harry went on and on about being friends with Ron and Hermione since they were five years old and the antics they did much to his dad’s and godfather’s amusement. They stayed even after they were done, and when they left, Harry put his jacket back on Draco and escorted him to his motorcycle.
—Harry lifted his shirt, revealing a long faded white scar just above his waist—
Harry’s heart sank. He found that he couldn’t move at all, even though he tried to run. “Blaise,” he said, “What’s going on?”
“I know,” Harry said, a sadistic smirk gracing his face. He took a step forward towards Greyback only for Draco to grab his hand. Harry turned and looked at his love, “I’ll be fine. He’s harmless now,” he said.
“I didn’t want to worry you or father,” Harry said. “But I do want to have you all wrapped around my fingers eventually.”
“Alright then boy, this time it’s allowed,” Draco said. “However next time your Master wants your body he’ll get it, understood?”
Harry shook his head, “He became powerful too, I could feel it,” he said. “He introduced me as his son to his Death Eaters but hid my face. It wasn’t until the wedding that I was revealed. We argued, constantly, Voldemort and I over his ideology. I told him… I told him over and over that I’ll kill his followers, each and every one before I find a way to kill him.”
hear from Harry.
It was love at first sight… for both of them.
“What do you mean?” Harry asked.
Harry didn’t know how to respond. Mr. Riddle straighten up and walked away without any explanation. Harry felt weird and exposed as he watched the Principal walk away from them. He turned to Blaise and Draco and took their hands, pulling both boys close. “I don’t feel so good,” he muttered.
“That is an invasion of privacy!” Sirius yelled as he and Remus stood. “We were not informed of this tiny detail during that horrible trial!”
“Harry!” Hermione jumped, “sorry, we didn’t see you.”
like that!”
“Where were you!?” Harry screamed. “I waited for you when the ship went away! I kept waiting during the summer! During my entire fifth year! And nothing! You just fucked me like a whore and left!”
“No professor, we didn’t get in trouble in our classes,” Harry said, “however something did happen last night.”
Wormtail did not reply; he was busy checking the tightness of the cords, his fingers trembling uncontrollably, fumbling over the knots. Once sure that Harry was bound so tightly to the headstone that he couldn’t move an inch, Wormtail drew a length of some black material from the inside of his cloak and stuffed it roughly into Harry’s mouth; then, without a word, he turned from harry and hurried away
They weren’t here yet.
Feeling left out and a little empty, Harry picked up the twins’, hoping that it wasn’t in the same vein as Ron and Hermione’s. Immediately a photo dropped from their letter, laying face down. Harry glanced at it before looking at the letter.
“My son,” Voldemort said, “it is time for you to repay your father. We shall use your blood, regain that which I lost, and together I shall introduce you to my followers as my son.”
“They’ve never appeared for him…” Harry said slowly.
“Not enough to be sloshing, but enough to declare without embarrassment that you are really hot,” Harry said.
Draco barked out a laugh, “We going to poison Umbridge now?”
“Because of Dumbledore?” Sirius asked. Remus nodded.
“PERFECT!” Loki cheered, “I LOVE WEDDINGS! The dresses, the food, the setting, the bedding—I especially love the bedding—and the silly murders when they realized they’ve laid with the wrong person! Oh I love it all!” Quick as a fox he appeared between the three of them, an arm around each neck, “You know I was actually planning of trapping you three in that bottle there with the troll but then you mentioned a wedding! And I get to get revenger on Satan, oh happy day! I have to tell you Satan-spawn, your father is a wily one—not bad on looks either, tried to get him to lay with me a couple times—this was before you squishy humans even existed—and he denied me! Me! The Trickster God! God of Chaos and Fun! That’s not actually my real title, but still—when is this wedding?”
“Severus go check outside immediately,” Dumbledore said, turning to Snape. “Boys, both of you will get decent. I will take you both immediately to the hospital wing for Calming Draughts.” He turned to leave them alone, but Harry stopped him.
Draco rolled his eyes, “Kairi is a sweetheart who’s been done dirty, as long as people aren’t trying to force her and her obviously gay friend Sora into being a couple,” he said. Harry laughed as Draco closed the trunk and Harry led the way into the apartment.
“Easy… why don’t we have the marked one describe him?” Blaise smirked. “Well cutie?”
Fenrir looked to Voldemort, who nodded. “You may tell him,” Voldemort said, “after all, he was a successful experiment. Consider it his award.”
“I do,” Harry said softly.
Draco ran off from the owlery back to the castle, Harry hurrying along to follow. They entered through a side door, up a staircase, and down a corridor as Hedwig hooted feebly in Harry’s arms.
Chapter 1
Five minutes. No sign.
“It is,” Draco nodded. “I will be honest with you Harry, if you want to be my boyfriend, we can date as you are a half-blood… however our society will never allow me to marry a half-blood, not as long as they are not willing to cast away his muggle blood. I’ve heard of the way, but not it’s specifics. If you want boy, I can look into it.”
The candles’ small flames burst into life as the blood pooled in the center spread out along the pentagram. Draco glanced at Harry and bit his lip. The essence around them started to act wildly, the mist becoming thick as in the center a circle of fire appeared. Harry took over and spoke.
Draco smirked, “Harry if you ask I’ll sleep with you every night.” Harry couldn’t help but snicker at that. He turned his back to Draco so he can slip the necklace on, his fingers tracing and lingering around his neck. “Beautiful,” he whispered. “My sweet omega.”
Harry thought. He turned to Blaise and Daphne, “Sorry,” he said, “I wanted to learn more about you guys but this was mostly about me and Draco, huh?”
“Like an asshole,” Daphne said, “Ever since you and Potter started dating you’ve just been different!”
“Do you think he’ll make us go?” Harry asked.
“He along with a small handful of others are going to betray the rest of the Death Eaters, killing some while sending the rest to Azkaban,” Mr. Riddle said. “I am sorry, however, your aunt, Bellatrix Lestrange, is one of the few Death Eaters too dangerous to let live. Though she deserves to rot in Azkaban, I cannot risk having her break out once more.”
February died away with their endless research. Harry felt that he was no closer to his goal than when he made it. The books all had all these complicated formulas and expressions that took several minutes to unscramble into basic English, and even then Harry had to read and reread several times before he was confident enough to put it in his notes. March roared in with heavy rains and winds, and Harry found his head stuffed with dark arts and complex phrases, fighting with the regular education he was supposed to be getting from his professors. The world seemed to become secondary to Harry in a way. There were still D.A. meetings, yes, and he did hang out with his friends, but in a way, events happened around him with him either ignoring it all together or giving it a glancing thought. Even his second visit for Voldemort, where Harry visited and poisoned an unassuming Death Eater called Travers, seemed to just happen to Harry. His thoughts and life only revolved around Horcruxes and Soul Magic as he fell into a glossy groove that was only interrupted by three events.
Draco nodded. “I thought it would be good to distract you from what happened. I was going to show you tomorrow, but we can at least look at what I got for you tonight, Harry.” He escorted Harry to the bed and have him sit down. Draco went to the shelf and took down the bag before joining Harry.
“Okay father, I miss you,” Harry nodded.
“What happened to him?” Harry asked. “Where is Viktor?”
Part XIV
“I miss him too,” Niall said. “Come on, let’s get this over with, and then we can write a letter to Viktor.”
“Precisely!” Dumbledore said, “Because you have love, Harry, you have a drive that Voldemort will never understand.”
“With a Slytherin!?!”
Draco looked as though he didn’t want to leave Harry for a second. “Go on, I won’t move,” Harry smiled, and he gave Draco one last kiss before they began the complicated procedure of untangling themselves from each other. Draco left the living room only to come back a moment later with his father following.
The Cruciatus Curse shocked everyone, Urquhart falling to the ground screaming in pain. Harry kept the spell for as long as he could. He could feel his anger draining quickly, and
“Yeah, about that,” Harry sighed. He pulled the blankets out and got out of bed, stretching fully. Ron looked at him oddly and leaned in, sniffing. “Stop that, you jerk! I know I haven’t showered since the day before!” Harry said, pushing Ron out of the way.
He appeared in the familiar corridors of Hogwarts. The moon shone brighter here, illuminating the halls and sleeping portraits. Bags in hand, Draco remembered the day Harry shown him the Room of Requirements. He looked around, getting his bearings, before walking down a corridor, turning on a corner and went down a small spiral staircase until he stood in the corridor where the Room of Requirement waited. He stared at the wall for five minutes, concentrating on a door appearing. When the wall stayed as it is, Draco gave a frustrated huff before remembering that he and Harry walked around the corridor three times.
“Harry, surely you didn’t mean—”
Draco looked relieved and relaxed in his chair, “That’s good,” he sighed, “so, can I ask what the Dark Lord had you do today?”
“I do Alpha,” Harry giggled. They threw off their clothes, and cuddle close in each other’s arms, drifting off a peaceful sleep. The next morning, they’ve repeated what they did yesterday, and Draco sighed contently as he held Harry, the boy tracing patterns on his chest.
“I’m—I’m just about done, sir,” Twilfitt said, looking down at the piece of paper his quill has just finished writing on. “Please, put away your wand.”
“Theo.”
Mr. Krum sneered. He saw Draco and his eyes narrowed, “And who is this?”
The demon chuckled, “Alright then baby, tell Daddy what you’re planning.” Harry and Draco shared a smile and they continued their way towards home.
“Of course, they do,” Uncle Sirius said. “Why do you ask?”
“It is an unnecessary risk,” Dumbledore said, looking at Moody. “We should not have Harry take any more risks than he had already.”
Voldemort snickered at this and turned back to the mirror. He took his wand out from his old robes and with precise movements, his hair started to snip itself away as invisible scissors started to groom the old man. “This was the body that seduced many men and woman, Harry, including my Black,” Voldemort said with a hint of nostalgia. “Hard for you to imagine, yes, but you will see why soon enough, my apprentice.”
“It was nice meeting you Ron,” Blaise smiled, “we have to talk more later on, however right now Draco and Harry are actually catching me up on what I missed. Thankfully it’s early in the school year so it’s not much.”
“Omega,” Draco purred, “are our friends treating you well?”
“What a load of disgusting garbage,” Harry muttered. But that was the world that Draco lived in, a world that Harry now found himself plunging into. So, he had to know it, and had to swim through it, otherwise there was no way he would be able to have Draco as his boyfriend. Still, Harry would never do that, he would never denounce his mother. There were noises downstairs and he could hear the all familiar stomps of his uncle coming up the stairs towards his room. “I can denounce the Dursleys, however,” he muttered. He closed the book and rolled off his bed just as Uncle Vernon slammed the door opened. “Boy! Get downstairs and clean up the garden! Figg’s cats got to it again, the ruddy things!”
Pride shone through Mr. Malfoy’s eyes, “Of course,” he said, “I will have the best people I know craft it.”
Part III
“You seem to know a lot about Blaise’s favorites,” Draco said casually. “Have you and he ever…”
Ron blinked and looked at Draco, “Huh?”
With his strength slowly returning, Harry panted as he looked at Voldemort, “Never… never again. You’re never taking my blood again.”
“And our parents are forced to work for You-Know-Who,” Theo said. “Honestly, Parkinson, you really need to remember where we are. You’re saying dangerous things that the professors don’t want to hear. And we don’t want to hear it either. We’re at Hogwarts, the one safe place right now.”
“Lies, you never did,” Harry muttered.
It was a golden necklace with emeralds and aquamarines. It smelled like Voldemort, with the central jewel filled with the Alpha’s magic and scent. Remus gasped at the necklace. “Tom?”
“Hello Harry,” the twins Fred and George said. “You look very pretty, almost girl like.”
“I thought we were going to die,” Uncle Remus sighed, “and my biggest regret would have been leaving you alone Harry.”
“Slughorn?” Blaise asked, looking at his own invitation.
Mrs. Weasley thought for a second before agreeing. She then looked at her children and told them all to get ready, for they’ll leave as soon as Tonks arrive.
Niall frowned like he clearly did not like the idea of Harry and Draco together, however, he nodded in the end. “Fine, I’ll see you at detention.”
“Well during the career advice meeting during my fifth year, I kept talking about getting into professional Quidditch,” Cedric said with a thoughtful expression. “Seeker obviously. Who knows, I might get on the same team as Wood, though before that I would love to beat you in a game once.”
“You too Fred, and you as well George,” Mrs. Weasley said strictly. “All of you, out.”
Harry looked up at him and raised an eyebrow, “Yes, Professor?” he asked.
Ch. 15
They found the others waiting just outside of Professor Umbridge’s office. Cedric looked up at Harry sadly while Hermione sat close to Blaise. Draco and Harry joined them, all sitting on the floor as they waited. They all were silent, waiting anxiously for the door in front of them to open. Half an hour passed, and the door finally opened. Professor Umbridge walked out, looking chipper, not even giving the others a glance. Mrs. Weasley appeared in the hallway and everyone stood up. “Oh, Cedric,” she cried out, and rushed to Cedric, hugging him. Cedric held on tight, crying openly now. The others all stood awkwardly as Mr. Weasley walked out, holding his hat as he wiped away a tear. He patted Theo’s shoulder as he passed, and stood in front of Harry, resting his hand on Harry’s shoulder, squeezing tightly.
There was a second knock on his door. Harry looked at his watch and smiled as it ticked eleven-fifty pm. Uncle Remus walked in and looked at Harry’s outfit. He let out a small chuckle and placed his hands on Harry’s shoulders affectionately. “An outfit befitting of a Potter,” he said. “Come on, we are ready for you.”
“Uncle Sirius…” Harry spoke gently, “why… why don’t you try?”
“As long as they’re both happy,” Lily chuckled.
Harry and Ron looked at each other for a moment and Harry cleared his throat. “Like I was saying… Draco’s nothing like his dad! He’s kind, sweet, reasonable, cute—”
“Yes Uncle Sirius,” Harry grinned. The three stood up and immediately left the room to head into Harry’s. They did leave the door open, and the music on, however their actions were far from pure as Blaise missed having his boys and showed them personally how much he missed their bodies.
“You will speak to me with respect Mr. Potter!” Professor Umbridge called out, “and you will have your hand up!”
The light was burning his eyes. Harry groaned as his forced his heavy eyelids open, and after they adjusted to the light, he saw with perfect clarity the worried faces of Professor Dumbledore and Kingsley Shaklebolt. He could feel he was in a bed, yet it was far from the bed he had in Privet Drive, this was softer, much softer. He groaned, and his hand moved automatically to fix his glasses, only to find nothing.
“That sounds nice, yeah,” Ron nodded, his mood improving. “So uhh—who are we looking for?”
“According to pureblood society, they are,” Theo said.
“It is wasted on him.”
“So what now?”
“Your mother is right boys,” Lupin interjected. “All of you should get out. This is official Order business.”
“Yes, I’m bisexual now shut up about it,” Draco said. “Figured it out around third year.”
“Come on! We’re leaving!” Niall shouted, and Harry nodded. Taking nothing with them, the two brothers ran out of the Dursleys’ home, never to return. Their feet slammed down the pavement as they ran away from the house. Neither boy had a sense of where they were going to run off to, just that they needed to run. The streets led them to the edge of the neighborhood where there was a playground where Dudley and his friends bullied kids. Harry and Niall were never allowed to go there as they were too busy with their chores. They ran through the empty playground. Their legs kept carrying them on and on towards a forest that lied just beyond the playground. The grass turned into a dirt path and they were quickly shadowed by treetops. Still, they kept on running, until they were certain that nobody was following them until they finally stopped underneath a large willow tree.
Remus frowned, “I don’t think so, at least I don’t remember. I used to teach there actually, for a year.”
“Yes, well, would you like to see my favorite flower?” Mrs. Malfoy smiled. Harry nodded. The older Omega walked forward, and Harry followed. She led him through the large garden towards the lake where on its edge was a full row of small white flowers with either a yellow or orange center. Harry recognized them immediately. “Narcissus?” he asked, looking at Mrs. Malfoy surprised.
“Uh yeah, last I checked,” Ron said. Lavender laughed at that too, and the two boys shared a confused look.
“But you did, even though it was neither of our faults,” Harry sighed. “Yet another way of how Dumbledore meddled in my life.” He sounded more annoyed instead of sad. He hugged Viktor and said, “I’m sorry. I’m sorry that Dumbledore ruined everything between us, and I’m sorry for everything that happened. I loved you, Viktor. I really did.”
“Riddle, please, I’m still getting used to it,” Harry said.
Voldemort stepped forward and grabbed Harry’s arm with one hand, pushing up his robe sleeve with the other. “This is who you are, Potter,” he said. The firelight illuminated Harry’s mark, the ink a deadly black, showing Harry’s altered Dark Mark. Seeing it, for the first time it made Harry’s stomach churn as he had second thoughts.
“Uh, yeah,” Draco nodded.
“Not really, uh Harry?”
“I am not a Dark Wizard!” Harry insistently yelled.
“I’ve no need to explain myself to you, just bring me to your people in the Daily Prophet. Through the public entrance,” Voldemort said.
When he saw this, Harry started to become more confident. Standing barely half a foot in front of the dummy. With one final swipe Harry yelled out,
“He has, and Professor Cornett, our old Potions Professor, always praised him for it. He always found ways to give the potions an additional effect when given time to work on it,” Niall said, sounding prideful.
Harry frowned and looked around. “I feel awful for saying this,” he began, “but I don’t ever want to go back there again. I don’t feel safe there.”
“I’m still Harry, I’m still your best friend,” Harry said. “As for my father—”
“My Alpha,” Harry said turning in Draco’s arms. They smiled at each other and leaned in for a kiss that lasted forever.
“As long as they’re not with Dumbledore,” Remus muttered. “Honestly, I have no idea what that man was thinking.”
“Uhh, I’m sorry,” Harry said. “Viktor and I usually just stay together for those times on his ship. I didn’t know that I was supposed to tell anyone.”
“Disgusting,” a random wizard commented. Harry could smell that he was an Alpha. “You boys deserve better than that disgusting used whore.”
“Oh god no! I like living,” Harry said, laughing and grinning. Draco laughed as well as they reached the table and sat down. He took off Harry’s leather jacket and smiled when the same handsome waiter Harry waved at walked up to them, speaking with a heavy mixture of Italian and New York accent. “Harry! So good to see you again, how are you tonight? And who is this cute boy you brought here?” He turned to Draco and smiled,
in. Your lot are rather demanding. So no, Mr. Potter will arrive here again on Monday at five o’clock to continue his detention sentence.”
“Flat ass,” Daphne said informationally. “Either way, it is nice not being around Mr. Prissy and the Lewd Zabini.” Ron nodded and smiled as they went on to tell stories about their friends. Without feeling any awkwardness, the two finished up and as soon as they stood up the table and chairs were gone along with the plates. They went inside to return to their friends and Ron stopped just as he entered the Great Hall.
“Harry, there you are,” Draco appeared, stepping right in front of the same compartment. “I assume you got an invitation too?”
Uncle Remus watched his nephew for a moment before nodding it off. He and Uncle Sirius left Harry and Draco alone for the rest of the afternoon, which the two spent reading their books and sharing what they’ve learned. It was starting to get dark outside and Harry started on the journal, his third book. Uncle Sirius walked in and said, “Alright boys, it’s time for Draco to go home.”
Neville seemed very relieved by that. He relaxed and smiled at Harry. “Thanks—are all Omegas like you by the way? I hope they are.”
“Because it gives Betas and Alphas a sort of lustful high, it is an enhanced experience that is almost impossible to fully explain,” Voldemort said. Harry nodded, remembering how he could smell and feel Ron’s intense sexual aura the night before. “Is there anything else that happened, Harry?”
“I’ll do it,” Harry nodded.
“Okay,” Harry nodded submissively. “I want him to live with us, sleep in the same bed with me. We’re married it’s to be expected. And only when you think it’s right, when we win the war, I want to move out with him.”
Draco opened his eyes to the sleek marble and high ceiling of Gringotts. He stepped out of the fireplace, which was against a wall along with many others, and walked down the long room, his footsteps muffled by the hushed chatter of wizards, along with the goblins’ quills scratching in thick, old ledgers. Since it was late at night, there was not many people there, and the goblins were obviously closing up the bank. Draco moved to a goblin who was free and said, “I’m here to withdraw from the Malfoy Vault.”
“Now Harry, don’t say that, they are muggles, below our kind,” the Dark Lord said, “and you have said it yourself that they mistreat you… why not show them their place?”
“Blood of my beloved,” Draco chanted, “may it power these ancient runes, and allow your souls to be one.” He closed Harry’s hand with his free hand and squeezed it, letting the blood drip onto the knife. “Love’s blood coat the steel so that we may be your soul’s armor.” He took the knife away from Harry’s hand and quickly sliced his own hand. Harry held Draco’s bleeding hand, letting their blood mix onto the blood. “Love’s blood coat the steel so that we may be my soul’s armor,” he said.
“Yes,” Harry nodded, looking at his boyfriend. “Right Draco?”
Harry nodded and opened the door. Nagini slithered in as Harry opened the door fully before walking inside. The study was just as impressive as the rest of the manor. The walls were lined with books, the shelving only interrupted briefly by a fireplace made of marble and a giant window looking out into the flowers. There was a chair facing the fireplace which Nagini slithered to. A hand stuck out and petted Nagini, who hissed comforting.
“And if she tries to come back?”
On and on they went, fucking the hours away in every single position they could think of. Not once did Harry’s mind go to Satan. He had his own god, a personal god with a god-worthy cock to whom he could pray and devote every fiber of his being, which he did that night. As they all gave their last ejaculations, Harry’s hole was flooded with Blaise and Draco’s cum, and Draco’s hole was flooded with Blaise’s, both pussies leaking before Blaise produced two large butt plugs and plugged his mages. “Absorb our seeds Harry,” he purred, “and my seed Draco. You both belong to me…”
“Oh, I see,” Harry nodded.
“And what, Mr. Potter, do you mean by that?” Mr. Riddle asked tensely.
Terry Boot blinked and stared at Ron for a moment, as though deciphering what he said. “Okay,” the Omega said, smiling. “Can you make sure to wear the same cologne tomorrow too? You smell nice.”
“Then why didn’t they date?”
“No, sir, I have not,” Harry said. “It was only a little jinx.”
“But you’ll agree that she is stubborn and childish,” Draco pushed.
“This was the only way to be with Draco,” Harry continued. “That is what I believed… I had to be with him, had to side with Voldemort and be included into Pureblood society. Draco and I were going to marry under the Submissive Clause.”
“Then we better start, shouldn’t we Mr. Malfoy?” Harry smirked, opening his legs wider, “Mrs. Malfoy wants to practice too.”
“Snape’s part of the Order?” Harry demanded.
“I will wait no matter how long it takes, as long as I have you in my life,” Mr. Riddle said. Remus gave a sad smile and leaned down to kiss Mr. Riddle’s cheek.
Harry was glad that for the first week, everything seemed normal, well as normal as things could be. He and Ron hang out, playing Quidditch with Bill and Ginny and helping around the house. By the end of the second week, Hermione came over to stay for the rest of the summer. Harry asked Mrs. Weasley if he could tell her himself about his lycanthropy. He brought Ron and Hermione into his room and closed the door. “There’s two things I need to tell you guys,” he said, glancing at Ron. “Umm one is something that I know for a long time… and the other is something new.”
Blaise laughed, shaking his head lightly, “I had a feeling you would say that, Draco Malfoy. Very well… we shall use the Greeks. It was them, not my father, who created the Elements and reality, with the help of Grandfather… the one you call ‘The False One’ or something like that.”
“If you don’t mind,” Harry said, “I would actually love to see the garden.”
“Stand by me, please,” Harry said. Draco got out of his chair and moved to Harry. Harry used his wand to take out the lamps one by one until the room was completely dark. Harry looked around for the red eyes. “Come out,” he said. The red eyes still did not appear. He frowned and looked to Draco with an apologetic look.
“Potter, shut up,” Draco snapped, glaring at the raven-haired boy who just grinned. “Where the hell does he get this from?”
“A most evil and sinister language,” Blaise said, “one whose name I wouldn’t dare pronounce for the utterance of its name and words would bring ruin to mortal ears who hear it. It is a language unknown to mortals and mages for it is a corrupted language made by my father. It is the language of demons, and no mortal should know it.”
“I tried going to the bathroom and drinking water but that didn’t help with my fever at all,” Harry said.
“Just let me work. Two weeks, that’s all I want,” Harry said, turning away from his brother. “I’ll see you in class.” And he left before Niall could stop him.
“Well isn’t it obvious?” Hermione asked, “The way she just pushed your trunk over—I get that she’s angry at what she choose to believe and it’s not like any of us led her on, but still her attitude was just inexcusable!”
“The Greeks then,” Draco said.
The Omega couldn’t move. He just whimpered slightly as Draco walked up towards him. “Tell me what Umbridge do to you,” he commanded. Harry glared at the Alpha as he stood in front of him. Deep inside, there was a pull to obey but Harry used all of his willpower to squash it down.
“Shame, to think that the son of our Dark Lord knows nothing of his own lineage,” Yaxley said. “Our Lord was so graceful to save your blood from dilution, and you mock it by not knowing its significance.”
He felt a little better, even Umbridge caused little harm to his mood as he had a goal in mind: Finish the potion and make the Death Eaters pay for his mistakes. Harry’s focus turned to working on the potion. He and Draco started to spend more and more time in the Room of Requirement. Due to the potion and different schedules, it was difficult for Harry to schedule the next class of the D.A., not that that was a priority on his mind.
“Fine… Forty,” Uncle Sirius said, “please Harry, this is for me more than you. I don’t know how you feel, it must be hundreds more intensified than I am, but I am just very anxious right now… which reminds me afterwards we need a talk, the three of us,” he said, looking up at Uncle Remus. “There’s something important—”
“Lockhart! Remember that bloke!” Ron said. Theo’s eyes went wide. “Yeah, yeah!” Ron said, and he started into a very enthusiastic tale of how he, Hermione and Ginny wandered around St. Mungo’s, and ran into their old professor.
“Tom,” Remus said, at a loss of words. He kissed Tom’s cheek and smiled. Tom kissed back and held Remus close.
Harry frowned; he wrapped his arms around himself. “It was so strong, I thought I was drowning in it,” he said. “Something in the back of my mind begged me to submit, to just allow him to do whatever he wants. It was awful.”
Harry opened his eyes. Hermione was looking at him with the same expression as she always does. “Okay,” she repeated. “Could that be a reason why Greyback targeted you? What about your friend—what happened to him?”
“Any time,” Niall grinned, “but you owe me one.”
“Shut up or else I’ll make you shut up!” Uncle Sirius cursed at Mr. Riddle. The two men joined the three boys in their chant, but it only made the devil laughed.
“It’s okay Harry, come on, you need to get to your nest,” Remus said gently. He took Harry’s hand and helped Harry out of Niall’s bed and back into his room where his nest waited for him. Harry immediately collapsed and cuddled with a giant stuffed toy of a dragon, it was mixed with both his and Niall’s scents. Remus knelt down and combed his hand through Harry’s hair. It was getting long, he noticed, but they could worry about that later.
“I will, you sleep too okay?” Draco asked. Harry nodded and kissed Draco’s cheek. He followed Draco to the door and whispered, “I’ll look over your notes. I’m sure we can find everything we need soon.”
“Well, that’s good,” Hermione nodded. “And you look good—you look… different.”
“Ronald!”
“Hermione,” Harry found himself saying in a venomous tone, “as happy and furious I am with both you and Ron, can you please let go of me? I can’t breathe, you got my neck, and I want to finish my letter to my boyfriend.”
“Contract? What do you mean?” Harry asked.
“Owe the Ministry nothing? The gull!” The Minister scoffed. “You two have stolen our savior and placed him in a setting where he is surrounded by the Dark Arts! I should have both of you arrested where you stand!”
“Oi! Stop that,” Ron yelled, “Harry didn’t do crap!”
“Is that a threat?” Draco growled out. He reached out to grab Harry’s neck to pull him in, but Harry slapped his hand away.
“Yeah, come on if we go now, you can ask him out before Hermione gets out of Arithmancy!” Harry said. This got Ron to bounce up and walked confidently and excitedly out of the common room, with Harry chasing after. The two quickly made their way to the library, where they found Terry Boot sitting with his fellow Ravenclaws. Harry approached them, smiling. “Hello Terry,” he said cheerfully. “Hi, Anthony and Michael.”
he thought.
“He’s dying,” Draco said.
“No.”
“Go get your wand, Potter, and hold your head high,” Voldemort commanded.
“I’m sure he’ll be told that eventually,” Niall chuckled as Harry rested against his chest.
His father’s gift came later that night when everyone was asleep. It was a rough manuscript of the book he was working on. Attached was a note,
Part I
“Barely,” Niall growled. “She hurt my little brother; how do you expect me to react?”
Night with Lions
“Hurts.”
“Two morning glories,” Ron grinned, “and a large black coffee. Draco, what do you drink?”
“Alpha,” he said, staring at his muscular form. “I am what that mutt called an Alpha now.” He stared at his form, admiring his muscles, before moving back to the table where he wrote his letter. There was a letter opener, along with an empty vial. Draco took a deep breath and picked up the letter opener. He inhaled sharply and struck the blade across his hand. Blood spewed out and Draco closed his hand into a fist over the vial, squeezing as the blood dripped down. Through gritted teeth, he filled the vial and magicked his cut away.
Professor Cornett, however, already seemed to know and Harry and Niall were arranged to leave from her office an hour later. “Boys, remember, you represent our school. Do not even think of doing anything that will embarrass Durmstrang.”
“Yes, well—you can’t just deny it, it’s a possibility,” Hermione said, her cheeks going pink. “How do we know that this isn’t all a cruel ploy or trick to get Harry to lower his defenses?”
“If it’s to protect Harry, I would gladly do so,” Draco declared.
“Yes, who boy?” Draco said roughly.
“I am… I’m nervous that they won’t accept me… because of who I am,” Harry whispered.
“But she’s in our year! What are we going to do? What if she spreads rumors about me?” Ron asked. Harry just stared at him with a slight frown. Ron stared back before realizing what he said, “Oh shi—sorry Harry, uh what I mean is—”
“And now we move to Mr. Zabini,” Slughorn said when he was done interrogating McLaggen. “Harry, I wonder if you knew that your friend here had a famously beautiful mother?” he said, looking at Harry, who shook his head. “Stunning woman, truly the essences of beauty, some people say. Sadly beauty has its cost. How many times have she been married, Blaise?”
“Draco!” Ron yelled, “Don’t betray me like that.”
Aunt Petunia was standing in front of him, looking down at him with the nastiest scowl Harry has ever seen. “Vernon!” she yelled, and Harry heard heavy steps running down. Harry stretched his head to see his uncle running towards him. His face was already growing purple with anger and Aunt Petunia did not need to say a word for the large man to start punching Harry.
Still in shock over the pain, Harry cried openly as his breathing quickened, trying to catch a breath that wouldn’t come. He could hear Draco continue to struggle and squeezed his hand for any support. Draco stopped struggling against Blaise’s third hand and turned his focus on Harry.
“Because I’m not going to fuck him until he does,” Harry answered directly.
“Watch your mouth!” Harry yelled and before anyone could react he had his wand out and pressed against Draco’s throat. There was fear in Malfoy’s eyes, but it quickly was replaced by his usual cockiness. “What’s the matter Potter? Struck a nerve, have I?”
She slithered around Harry’s body until she was wrapped around his shoulder, her face pressed against Harry’s forehead. She took a smell,
“To put it simply, yes,” Voldemort said, “I must add a final ingredient, however, as do you.” Harry felt a shiver and turned towards his lord. Voldemort stepped to the potion and produced a sharp silver knife. Harry watched as the Dark Lord extended his arm over the cauldron. “This would have been your husband’s blood, a husband’s blood to cleanse his submissive,” Voldemort said, “however I am your Lord, your father now, and this will work just as well.” His hand moving quickly, his face showing no reaction or flinching, Voldemort sliced a clean cut into his arm, and Harry had to look away as his blood poured slowly into the potion.
“But still, that would go against his instincts as an Alpha, wouldn’t it?” Harry asked.
With his letter done, Harry folded it and placed the quill and ink back in place. “Thank you Mrs. Weasley,” he said.
carved into it. “At least they’re numbered,” Draco said. “Come on boyfriend of mine.”
He thought.
“But why?” Harry insisted, “why the war?”
“Do as you have planned,” Dumbledore said. “I will talk with Professor McGonagall and Professor Snape to explain your situations, and make sure that neither of you get in trouble for breaking our rules.” He gave a small chuckle and smiled at the two reassuringly. “You said that it was only headaches when you are in your separate classes?” he asked once more.
“Harry baby come on! I just want a bit of fun,” Cormac McLaggen laughed. “Don’t be such a prude.”
Harry nuzzled and lapped at the clothed bulge, Draco’s cock jerking in response, a wet spot forming at the head, where a pearl of precum leaked through the clothed. Harry immediately latched onto it and sucked, his tongue moving in ways that Draco didn’t think were possible as the omega tried to drink every drop of precum that he could from the spot.
“Shame, purely a shame,” Voldemort sighed. “Then I will redouble my efforts on the two of you.” He turned to Vernon and Petunia and tapped his wand onto a nearby flower vase, which turned into many sharp sewing needles and thread. He smirked coldly at the two of them and pointed his wand.
“Oh! Lovely—I hope you’ve given me a good seat, I would hate to be forgotten, or worse thrust into the back corner,” Loki smiled. “You did give me a good seat did you?”
“That’ll be great,” Harry yawned. “But… I’m so tired now.”
“They did, sir,” Draco nodded. “We are planning to have the wedding in the winter, near the end of December or early of January.”
Harry nodded. “For eleven years,” he said softly. “They put my stuff in there now but still, my mattress and old toys are still there.”
“So you think I’m perfect?” Harry asked.
“Only because of your father’s graces!” Yaxley said.
The cave room was smaller than Harry’s bedroom. In the center was a stone slab with a skeleton shackled to the top of it, however the skeleton looked weird, different from a normal human’s. It was bigger, with longer arms and legs and bones that Harry never thought of before, as though this being had three legs. “Is that him?” Draco whispered.
Feeling uneasy, Harry and Uncle Sirius led the demon out of the kitchen and to a small wooden door that led to the basement storage area. The room was nicely lit with boxes packing the walls all labeled and covered in a nice layer of dust. Near the ceiling was a half-window showing the outside at a ground level. Next to the storage room, Harry could hear their washer and dryer rumbling away quietly. Uncle Sirius moved some boxes around until he found an old mattress that was still surprisingly clean. “At least we know the preservation spell on these things work,” he muttered, looking at his nephew. He placed the mattress on the floor and looked at the demon. “You can make it yourself,” he said.
“Good,” Uncle Remus said. “Though just remember that both of us are very protective of Harry. And Sirius here is like a mad dog with a long leash.” Uncle Sirius grinned wildly at that comment. “Don’t please, I already have a headache tonight,” Uncle Remus groaned. “Now, what time is it… good lord, almost eleven. You should head home immediately Mr. Malfoy. As for you Harry, say goodnight and go to bed.”
“Shadows? What do you mean?” Sirius demanded. “Dumbledore what is going on!?”
“’Course I am,” Harry said grimly, taking her hand and allowing her to pull him to his feet. Madam Hooch was zooming toward one of the Slytherin players above him, though he could not see who it was at this angle.
“It’s rare you know, for a familiar to appear before your Initiation, “Uncle Remus said. He looked at the fox and said, “I would rather you didn’t get a wild familiar as this one but… it works. Now eat up, you have a busy time before your Initiation.”
He was in his home, of course he was, after the Dark Lord’s resurrection, he has chosen Malfoy Manor has his headquarters. If Draco was honest with himself, that made him uncomfortable, it made his family uncomfortable. But now, Draco felt the most uncomfortable as he ever felt. His father was now in Azkaban, locked up for following the Dark Lord. And now, Draco found himself standing in front of the monster, yes, monster. Draco could not find any other way to describe him.
“Come here Weasleys,” Mrs. Weasley sniffled, her arms opened wide, motioning for everyone to come closer. Harry glanced at Draco before moving towards her, as did Hermione. Mrs. Weasley grabbed them and made sure they were in the center of the massive hug. She sniffled and looked around, “Cedric love, you too,” she said. Cedric moved closer and hugged with George. The entire Weasley clan stood there, silently blocking the corridor as the three Slytherins looked on. Mrs. Weasley took a shuddering breath, “Okay, okay,” she whispered.
“So you two are opening a shop?” Draco said with some approval.
“Leaving? We barely ate breakfast,” Ron said.
“Then home smells like you because I feel safe around you,” Harry said.
I warned you about peacocks, didn’t I? Anyway, something weird I’ve noticed is that I’m losing reviews… not that it hurts me personally, however I absolutely adore reading all of your reactions, the good and the bad, however I do not want to force you guys to review or bully you into it. Just reading my story and knowing that I’m entertaining you is enough so thank you so much and I hope that you have enjoyed.
At Slughorn’s gesture, they moved to sit down, and Harry saw that they were not the only ones invited. There were two seventh-year boys that Harry did not know, squished in the corner beside Slughorn and looking as though she was not entirely sure how she got there, Ginny.
“Yes, ma’am,” Harry nodded. “That did not start here, but during the summer when I was with the Weasleys. Dumbledore told Mrs. Weasley the same thing he told Dobby, the house-elf who works in the kitchens; that it was medicine or something to help me. At first, I did not notice it, she just started adding it after our visit to Diagon Alley to my dinner and I threw up. It kept happening again and again until Ron caught on and we started switching food. I did not have it since because we kept switching food until I went down to the kitchens along with Ron, Hermione, and Draco to see how it was that the protein keeps getting onto my plate.”
Draco nodded and looked at the dozen selection before him. “Take away all the pink,” he said immediately. Two collars disappeared, replaced by other colors. Draco picked up a dark green collar and weighed it in his hands. It felt light. “Come here, Harry,” he said softly. He turned around and presented the collar, “What do you think?”
“Then learn quickly,” the Dark Lord said. “Moonstones are the shining, milky-colored gemstones, the powdered ones are next to the jar with intact moonstones. Syrup of Helleborne, is exactly what it sounds like, extract of helleborne. Read the instructions, follow it, and that is all. You have the night, I will be back to check on your progress.” And with that, the Dark Lord vanished, but in his place was a Shadow-walker, tall and humanoid like with two red eyes staring at Harry. Harry bit his lip and looked around the room; it was dark with many unlit torches.
“It will, but honestly I don’t know where to begin,” Harry said. He looked towards the bathroom and sighed, “I hope he likes taking long showers,” he muttered. The boys were all now crowded around Harry, looking at him expectantly. “Alright, well, I guess I could give a short version of it. What do you want to know?”
“No, I am saying that there was a false prophecy in the Department of Mystery, a prophecy contrived by Dumbledore himself all to get rid of my son,” Voldemort said. “Consider the circumstances of when the prophecy was given. It happened during an interview in Hogs Head for a teaching position in Hogwarts, which has never happened before. Position interviews always happened in the castle, always, but for this one, Dumbledore went out of his way to go into the Hogs Head, a remote place, where it was just himself and the interviewee alone… and someone else listening in. Someone loyal, ultimately, to Dumbledore. It seemed all too convenient that a prophecy meant to save the world happened there, where someone could listen in, instead of in the Headmaster’s office where the interview was supposed to happen. A prophecy that, unfortunately, led to the deaths of Lily and James Potter, and started the series of unfortunate events that led us here today in this courtroom. Dumbledore has planned all of this, every huge moment, as a final insult and act against me. He saw my son and decided to groom him into a soldier for his war, a soldier all too willing to die for his cause. That is Dumbledore’s ultimate crime: he groomed Harry to die. This outrageous claim that I am Lord Voldemort is a pathetic excuse from a pathetic old man who has run out of cards to play. I will say this once and for all, for everyone to hear…
Harry left their room and took a deep sigh, wondering where his friend was. He first checked her room, which was empty, followed by the rest of the first floor. Ginny was nowhere to be found, and he was left to wander around the Burrow until he ran into Fleur. She pointed him outside to the gardens. Harry went outside and looked around. Bill and Ron were helping Mr. Weasley with something, and Harry was almost roped in until he asked where Ginny was. He found her with Mrs. Weasley pulling carrots out from the garden. “Ginny.”
“And I miss you too—now go, I’ll be here until the train leaves,” Voldemort said. Harry nodded and gave his father a final hug before going to the train.
Mr. Krum grunted and looked at his son. “I’ll let it slide, considering you got my son out of his room,” he muttered. “Goodbye, Harry.”
Harry woke up feeling very comfortable. In his sleep, he snuggled deeper into the plushie he was holding and grumbled, “Niall, I don’t wanna wake up shut up.”
The three stayed in the common room. Harry and Ron played a few rounds of Wizards Chess before Hermione forced them to stop to do some homework for Transfiguration. The only break they had was dinner, and afterward, the three just sat around until it was time for Harry’s lesson with Dumbledore.
he thought to himself. “Anyway I’m sure if I introduce you two you’ll see that Draco’s actually a really nice guy! And Loki likes him too, don’t you Loki?” He smiled down at his familiar who gave a soft yip.
The voice said.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry and Draco turned to see Mr. Malfoy standing in front of them, a scowl on his face as he glared down at his son. “An impromptu night with your play-thing I see… I am very disappointed in you Draco. Now say goodbye to it and let’s be on our way.”
“You’re smooth Harry,” Draco chuckled, “but you tripped at the last moment, dear. Try better next time.”
Harry had to stare at her for a moment before realizing what she said, “I’m sorry—you, are you saying that it’s possible?” he asked.
Harry said again.
The potions classrooms were free for the weekend, but Harry still insisted on going down to one of the classrooms in the back before he felt safe to enter. Draco closed and locked the door behind him as Harry went to the nearest cauldron and filled it with water from his wand.
“I’ll go with you,” Blaise said, taking Hermione’s hand. Hermione hesitated and looked at Harry.
“It is indeed,” Voldemort said. “And so, for the week he shall be living with us. I wish it can be longer, however, he has plans that cannot be delayed.”
Two stone gargoyles flanked the staffroom door. As they approached, one of them croaked, “You should be in class, sunny Jim.”
“Ron, stop it,” Hermione said, “You’re making a scene!”
“Because I love you, because I want to keep you safe, keep us safe,” Harry said. “Everything the Purebloods are doing, everything my father is doing, it’ll just make our world a worse place. You know how Pansy and Greengrass acted, how wrong they are and how angry it made all of us feel.”
“To our boys,” Voldemort said, clinking their glasses. Their conversations moved to safer topics, and Voldemort smiled as he saw the Omega’s defenses lower as he has gotten comfortable with him. They both were getting slightly intoxicated; however, Voldemort always knew how to hold his liquor. Having an Alpha’s metabolism helped as well.
Ron turned to see first year Hufflepuffs looking up at him. “Yeah, I’m looking for Cedric,” Ron said gruffly. “Diggory.”
“Which is?” Blaise asked.
Next to the wedding robes was a letter, written in his father’s handwriting.
“Nothing—nothing stop!” Harry cried out, but that never worked.
and looked up at Harry.
Mrs. Weasley and Lupin still looked uncertain, but they didn’t talk about it anymore. Instead they left it to Lupin to search the house as Tonks arrived, and they all left for St. Mungo’s.
“When you’re bitten, that is when you have your first transformation,” Lupin said, “but you did not. Instead your body changed.”
“No boy,” Draco said. “This is for daywear. I want this in your pretty hole while we’re at classes. And when classes are done… you can practice with this.” He pulled out a dildo that was just a little smaller than his cock. Harry took it and examined it. “I still want you to be tight, naturally,” Draco smirked, “I also got one that’s thicker than my arm, but we can talk about that stuff later.”
Harry swallowed, his Adam’s apple pushing against Draco’s hand. “What is that, Alpha?” he asked, already getting aroused.
Parkinson saw him first but immediately looked away as Draco stood up and immediately grabbed onto him. “He knows, he knows, he knows,” Harry cried out. “I’m so stupid! He baited me and I fell for it! I’m sorry Draco, I’m so sorry.”
Dobby hesitated before nodding his head. “Okay, Dobby will get rid of it for Harry Potter and Dumbledore sirs,” he said. He snapped his fingers and the container floated towards Ron, who grabbed it, and twisted the lid tightly on it.
“I promised them that I would spend half the train ride with you and the second half with them,” Harry explained. “It’s getting dark out so I need to go find them.”
“What are you doing here?” Ron demanded, standing up instantly ready to fight Malfoy if needed. Harry immediately got between the two.
“Round two?”
Draco led him down the corridor and turned a corner where he scouted out an empty classroom earlier. He walked in and waited for Niall, who closed the door behind him. “What is this about Malfoy?”
Yaxley lived in what would be considered a modest house. For such an old and proper wizard, Yaxley’s home was located in the middle of a small town. It was impressive, towering over all others with it’s vast gated garden and high rooftops. Harry appeared in the front room of the house, stepping out of darkness. It was a cozy room nicely decorated with flowers hanging around the walls. Harry took a few steps forward before a house-elf appeared.
“I think this is enough for now,” Harry said. “We can… we can get the ingredients together later. Use the Shadow-walkers when needed.”
“Ten exactly,” the Dark Lord said. Harry looked surprised, he was sure he was walking for some time. The Dark Lord didn’t entertain his surprise as he simply went to the desk and chalkboard, “Sit,” he commanded.
“Well then… I’ve never met a demon who was so civil before,” Uncle Sirius said. “Come on Harry.”
“Please Hermione,” Harry begged. “You and Ron are my best friends. I don’t want this to wedge between us.”
Chapter 16
Harry thought… or was it the voice in his head? He frowned; they sounded the same and yet he thought he could hear two voices inside him. Mrs. Weasley continued, ignorant of Harry’s immense look of disgust. “I am sure that everything will work out Harry. It will be hard for us to adjust—of course it will be such a trial for you dearie, but I’m sure that you will do just fine.”
“Because of my boys,” Cedric answered. “We were in her class and Fred and George… were being Fred and George.”
“Yeah, of course,” Harry said nodding quickly. He grinned brightly at Draco as though he was just told he could play with his favorite toy. Draco just hummed and turned around, hiding a smile as he continued to cook. “Go set the table then, Potter,” he ordered.
The night of the full moon, the Burrow was full of an uneasy nervousness and tension. Harry still felt normal. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley tripled check the charms placed around Harry’s room. The boxes that were stacked in his room were moved, spaced out between the different bedrooms while Mrs. Weasley yelled at Fred and George for leaving them there. There was an early dinner, and as the sun was setting Harry waved goodnight to the Weasleys.
“To sit with my twin, obviously,” the omega scoffed. He shouldered Malfoy’s hand off and moved to Niall.
This required some fancy spellworked, but Draco was confident in his ability. First, he pointed his wand at Goyle’s bulge-less underwear, and started to sneer out a long, dark curse that would leave the target impotent. A haze oozed out of Draco’s wand, heavy and black, and snaked it’s way towards Goyle. It surrounded his legs and began to crawl up, being absorbed into his skin as it moved past the fabric of his underwear, setting into Goyle’s balls, killing his sperm. His dazed look mixed with pain, but Draco did not care. He continued to cast the spell, muttering the words as it came to his head naturally, as though there was a bird on his shoulder, whispering into his ear. The last of the ooze disappeared into Goyle, and the teen fell over.
“Anything!”
“NO! Oh No! God no!” Sirius yelled, jumping up. “No, no, no, no—please no—just no!”
Draco looked annoyed, after a deep breath he stared at the window, not looking at anyone in particular as he said, “I am sorry for being a prat to you all, including calling Granger a mudblood, mocking Weasley for his lack of wealth and Longbottom for being Longbottom. I am sorry for my past behaviors and will work to improve myself.”
“I swear Draco darling, I will pay attention to you too but right now I’m busy with sweet Harry,” the demon said. “Kindly wait.”
And with that the mist began to roll away. Harry watched as it seeped through the trees, a hint of a goat and a man with goat-horns dancing in the mist before disappearing forever. Harry moved to be on his knees in front of the One Tree’s stump. Orion and Lycaon stepped up to Harry and stood at his sides, pressing their bodies against his for comfort and warmth. Wiping his face of his tears he placed his hands on the stump and began to pray.
“Don’t call her that!” Harry argued, pushing Draco away. “Mrs. Weasley is the closest thing I have to a mother, and she cares about me—you too now it seems.”
“Horcruxes!” the old man squeaked out, his eyes bulging out. “You—you want to—”
“I know,” Harry sighed, “how about tonight you spend the night in my room? Then we can both be equally embarrassed.”
“I think that’s a lovely idea,” Harry said. The two blushed and smiled as they slid out, spending the entire day exploring Hogsmeade.
“Not really,” Ron said, “She wanted a picnic, so I thought to bring her to our place, cause it has a nice view you know, by the lake, but she didn’t like that! Then when we tried talking she got me mad! She said that I should try for Quidditch and that it was a good thing you were kicked off Harry!”
“Honestly the two of you,” Hermione whispered, looking away purposefully as Draco pressed his lips against Harry. The two absorbed themselves in the kiss, their homework left forgotten. Hermione cleared her throw several times to get their attention.
The moon was a beautiful celestial being, hanging large in the sky above him. Shining through the darkness, brighter than the stars around it. Harry’s gaze became fixated on the moon, and for the first time he felt a pull. He stepped back, expecting to feel pain. Instead he felt like he was on fire. His clothes were irritating, and he ripped them off as quickly as he felt the heat inside him erupt. His cock was hard and leaking, his butt was as wet as ever and black fur started to sprout around his chest. His hands brushed against his nipples, and he fell to his knees as he screamed in pleasure. His cock rocked harder, dripping endlessly. He expected to turn into a wolf or dog, for his hands and feet to turn into paws… but they didn’t. Harry’s feet grew furry and elongated slightly, claws growing out of the tips while his hands stayed the same, but, like his feet, growing furry and clawed. The fur covered his body, his face somehow keeping some human qualities. His ears moved, turning into two furry wolf ears that laid on the top of his head as his nose became wolf-like, though his head shape stayed mostly the same. Harry staggered to a mirror and stared in awe as, somehow, he did not look monstrous at all, but somehow cute. Like a walking puppy. His cock looked strange, with a furry base but still same shape and length. He wrapped a cautious hand around it and gave it a few jerks. Still felt good, so good. …Harry slid down onto this back as his hole felt needy.
Ron stared down at Blaise, although they were the same height, and his chest puffed out as he mechanically stuck out his hand. “Hello,” he said, deepening his voice several octaves.
“You might actually enjoy yourself, Ron,” Hermione said. Harry nodded in agreement. “Anyway,” he said, “I just came over to tell you guys about the meeting. I’m actually going to spend the rest of the day and night with Draco. I’ll be eating with him as well.”
Family Issues
“I have no idea what you mean,” Bellatrix said easily, taking another sip.
“Yes, and it will pull off without a trace, correct?” Uncle Sirius asked, giving the old god a stern look. “There are no second chances in this, old god, you know this. If the devil wins—”
“I didn’t know that… but Ginny, I’m gay,” Harry said.
The beautiful Omega stopped suddenly. His bed looked like a complete chaotic mess with blankets and plushies everywhere. Draco couldn’t help but sneer at the state of it, especially compared to Theo’s, which was orderly and neat. However, Harry smiled at the product and went to his trunk, and pulled out pajamas to wear. The boy slipped into the bathroom with Draco watching the entire time, and moments later he came out wearing pajama pants and an old shirt that was a size too big for him.
“No, it was no accident,” Voldemort frowned, “however I do not know if his friend’s mother did it knowingly, or under the orders of someone else.” He sighed and pulled his Omega close. “I’m scared,” he admitted. “There was a reason why my son was stolen from me, and now that I finally have him back, to see him suffer because of me, it’s heartbreaking.”
“Evidence. We’re going to get her fired. I can’t believe she did this to you two! And an Omega no less!” Blaise said. Harry frowned deeply. He didn’t like how the two were crowding him, but he allowed Blaise to take a picture of his scarred hand.
“Harry is missing?”
“Yes, I do,” Harry said, still sounded heated. “Now I don’t want to hear complaints or insults from either of you!” He glared at them both and tugged Draco away. “I’ll write my letter after dinner. Viktor, you better go back to my father.”
“And everything that it entails, yes,” Theo nodded. Harry went red. “Golden Boy Harry here holds many secrets Blaise, and if you’re a good boy, you might be able to learn them.”
“I don’t know, I asked grandfather and he just said that it was a reflection of who I am, whatever that means,” Blaise shrugged.
“Your blood… my lord, is he pure?” The asker’s screams quickly filled the room as Voldemort casted the Cruciatus Curse. The others separated themselves from the offender as Harry just watched as the Death Eater fell to the floor, writhing in pain.
“It means, dear twin, that while we are here, Harry is alone and Dumbledore warned Ron and Hermione not to tell Harry anything about this place unless their letters get stolen or anything,” Fred said.
He was upside down, doing a handstand his muscles all flexed with ease as he kept his balance. Draco’s eyes immediately went to his stomach where he could see a six-pack and a trail of black hair leading down… up to his pants. Draco tried to not think about that as he quickly looked down to see Harry’s impressive pecs, which looked impressive and large, pushing out even while his arms were stretched out fully.
“Uh… Mrs. Lestrange?” A girl said, raising her hand. Harry looked over at the voice to see it was Lavender Brown.
“I know that these are difficult times, Mr. Weasley, but yelling at your Headmistress is simply prohibited,” Professor Umbridge said in a falsely sweet voice. “I’m afraid I will have to take away fifty points from Gryffindor for that.”
“Well, I shall see you at Hogwarts, Harry,” Dumbledore said. “Take care of yourself, Molly, your servant.”
The next day, the four sat down and Remus and Sirius talked to Harry, explaining to him what they did to Niall, and afterward, the two Omegas went out to get Harry suppressants. Afterward, Niall and Harry made sure to scent every single item in Harry’s nest as they planned on how they’re going to handle Harry’s heats, deciding that it would be best if only Niall goes to his nest and takes care of Harry without being in it with him.
“Father!” Draco said, raising his voice slightly. “She is out to harm Harry personally! She keeps carving into his hand and—”
“I guess,” Draco sighed, “I just… this all feels rushed, you know, especially since how we were so against him last night!”
“Then for now…” Blaise said slowly, “let’s just return home and focus on meditating. Worrying about others’ plans is useless until both of you are mages.”
“Thanks.”
“Niall, please,” Hermione begged. “I know that we barely know each other, and you’ve only been here for a month, but you’ve must have learned so much at Durmstrang, so much that we didn’t even think of. People will come to you; you’re a charismatic Alpha and I know that you’re intelligent.”
Nagini offered.
“Good afternoon, Professor Umbridge,” they chanted back at her.
“Your cause,” Harry countered. He took the quill, and like before he crossed out each name, one by one. “You are my father,” he said, “you have taught me many things… you’re the reason why I’m with Draco in some ways, but I will not tolerate your followers.” He expected Voldemort to be angry, to lash out, instead there was only a cold smirk.
“N-No, my lord,” the man said through the painful screams. Voldemort’s eyes looked upon Goyle Snr. with a cold expression and he continued the torture. Harry stared at his feet as the torture went on, doing his best to block out the screams until his father gotten bored.
“Prat-ness? Potter do you even know who you are talking to?” Draco demanded.
“Where do you go during a full moon?” Theo asked, “you and Draco were obviously not in either dorms, were you?”
Harry grinned and rubbed his face against Draco’s cock and balls, breathing deeply as he rubbed the musky smell all over him. He loved it, his mouth open as he rubbed until the hardening cock slipped into his mouth. He started sucking, moving his head up and down the growing cock as his master moaned, his hands moving into Harry’s hair, grabbing him tightly. “Fuck yeah Harry, that’s a good boy,” he moaned. Harry made sure to be extra messy with Draco’s cock, slobbering over it as his tongue moved and caressed the hard hot member. Draco moaned and thrust his cock into Harry’s mouth, meeting his pup with the movements.
“Yes,” Voldemort said simply. Harry was livid. His fist started to shake with anger, reaching quickly for his wand. “Will you kill me now?” Voldemort asked, looking at him emotionlessly. “Now? After so long?”
“Just some things that happened that night,” Harry said, he glanced around for the boy but couldn’t find it, “Honestly, it’s something between him and me,” he said.
And best of all, in Draco’s mind, nobody bothered him. They all just glanced at him if they even noticed before going on their business. Draco did not feel like interacting with anyone, maybe just mutter a hello to whoever his roommate will be and fall asleep for all eternity. But before any of that, he had to find the dorms.
“Yes… I’ve come for you, warlock… to make a contract,” the essence said.
Harry felt a sharp pull, and soon felt like he and Draco were being pulled into the air by an invisible fishhook in their navels. The scenery spun around them, mixing and morphing together into an endless blur that changed colors. Harry looked at Draco, who nodded, and they both kicking their legs around as if they were walking. The spinning slowed and they began to fall, however, unlike the last times Harry used portkeys, he and Draco sort of floated down to the air, holding hand as they looked to be walking on air.
“Not really,” Ron muttered. “And I think I kept saying bad things because she didn’t like them.”
The mortals all looked surprised at the fox, who cocked his head. Blaise laughed, “Relax! I’ve checked and this familiar is just that, a familiar. It is just unlikely coincidence that Harry chose the name of the old deity whose help we require.” The adults looked at Blaise with both a shocked and unbelieving face. The demon sighed, “You don’t believe me, don’t you?” he asked.
Finale
Harry frowned. He hated this, hated himself. He should have been stronger. He must be stronger. He shouldn’t have killed Nott. He should have killed Voldemort. He didn’t feel himself. Where was the boy who faced Voldemort? Faced the Basilisk? Faced Quirrell and turned back time to save Sirius? Where was he? He wasn’t here. He wasn’t being escorted to the bath by Sirius. He was somewhere else. He was the voice who protested and died away and now all that was left was… what? Harry did not know.
“No, we shall see how this develops,” the Dark Lord said. “If it builds to something, then we will make sure everything is orderly.” He watched them for a moment more before turning to Lucius, “I will be killing the muggles Harry was forced to be with after he leaves with Dumbledore on the 12
Katie looked at him, “Oh… Harry,” she said awkwardly. “Look uh I know that you’ve been our Seeker for the last five years or so but—I think it’s time for new blood, you know, as a Seeker.”
Chapter 4
“No, you’re a filthy Slytherin,” Ron said, “all of you are the same.”
“Potter, your package isn’t even big enough to be shipped. Now, should I go for spicy sausage or sweet?” Draco said, not even glancing at Harry, keeping a smile to himself. Harry laughed loudly at that, and Draco allowed himself to blush as he decided on getting both. It took them almost an hour for Draco to get everything he needed, and Harry, being a perfect gentleman, loaded Draco’s car for him.
“I know, but I can’t stay with you,” Niall frowned. “I don’t want to accidentally give you my peanut butter.”
“Harry sleeps with Ron,” Mrs. Weasley said, “they both shared a room. If someone snuck in, it surely would have woken Ron up! And he was the one who told us that Harry wasn’t in his bed.”
Harry hissed conversationally,
Ron nodded, “Me too,” he said. The two dressed in silent, Harry felt hotter than usual as he got under his covers, closing his bed curtains after saying goodnight to Ron before, under the privacy of his covers and bed curtains, shrugged off his clothes as he began to sweat profusely. His stomach started to hurt, his blood boiled, and his eyes felt awful as, throughout this pain, Harry fell unconscious, and slept through his changes, the mark on his arm ever growing and pulsed strongly.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dumbledore’s face fell as he stared at Harry. Harry only glared at him back. “I hated it there. I found every excuse I could to be away from it.”
Nagini said. She moved her head to meet with Harry’s hand. The teen petted Nagini cautiously before falling into a gentle groove.
“I mean—I would thought he would go for Weasley or someone like that,” Draco said.
He pulled out his books on Pureblood Society and the Dark Arts and laid them on his bed, keeping them there as he kept everything else in his trunk except for his muggle clothes. He plopped on his bed and opened up the nearest book, which was about Pureblood society, and opened to a random passage, which was about something he completely disagreed on.
Draco snorted, “Well it is kind of inevitable isn’t it? With the Submissive Clause.” Harry nodded, “I guess but still why did he have to do this? Please tell me that he didn’t set a date.”
“You have worry lines deeper than a canyon, love,” Draco sighed. “What are you thinking of?”
“And you stopped because of your second gender?” Scrimgeour asked, as though the thought was offensive. “We have plenty of Omega Aurors, Mr. Potter.”
Mr. Riddle stood in front of the three, examining their hands. “You’ve told me that you have something of importance to tell me,” Mr. Riddle said.
“I don’t know why you bothered, I am perfectly capable of walking myself to breakfast,” Harry said. “I’m an Omega, not helpless,” Malfoy muttered something under his breath, but Harry chose to ignore it. The two left together with Malfoy pushing ahead of Harry slightly.
“Dumbledore decided I should go to the Dursleys instead of Sirius and Remus who were my godfathers that my parents, the Potters, decided. Dumbledore stole me from my father a month after my dad died in childbirth. Dumbledore led to my father’s fall to insanity. Hermione why can’t you see that Dumbledore is at fault here?”
Ron stopped. He glanced at Theo. “I’m... I’m bisexual,” he said.
Pansy gasped and turned to glare at Blaise, “Excuse me?” she said, “Watch who you’re talking to!”
“Okay,” Harry nodded, and he left.
“Simply because of the Trace you ignorant boy,” Voldemort sneered. Harry looked at him, confused. “I am not surprised you do not know of it,” Voldemort said. “Not that it matters now…” he looked around Harry’s room for a moment, contemplating on what to do. “It will be a problem, if the muggles suddenly die,” he muttered, “however to have my apprentice suffer under them is utterly humiliating and scandalous…”
“Well, looking at his hair I’m sure he’s gay,” Cedric joked, “boy looks to spend more than two hours with it.”
Sirius left him inside the bathroom and closed the door behind him. Harry moved to the bathtub automatically and took off his clothes, sitting in the empty tub for a while before turning the hot water facet on. He looked down at himself. His skin looked normal, hints of puberty peppered around his body, the starting of chest hair growing as well as hair on his legs and arms… except for where the Dark Mark laid.
“You smell like farts and burps!” Harry shot back.
“That tends to happen when we kiss,” Harry shrugged. “here are your books—and yours, Hermione.”
“What did he do?” Harry asked Draco, who shrugged. The two went to Blaise and Ron. “What was that?” Harry asked.
“Are you kidding me? A marriage? Are you three even thinking?”
“Some time ago, a century or two I would like to say, warlocks and witches were called by a different name, held mightier magic than anything you can imagine. I cannot say how or why the magic started to weaken as time went on, traditions and ceremonies converted for some more disgusting and violent practices. A religion based around my father transformed into an orgy of blood and violence… it disturbs me how much my father and the other demons liked this change… Did you know, mages, that your people celebrated more deities than just my father? This was before my time, so I cannot give you a full account, however… Magic filled the world. Gods were a plenty and respected, mystics and humanity lived as one. And now… only my father and his remains,” Blaise lamented. He looked at Harry and Draco, smiling slightly. “I will teach you both how to be mages again. How to harness magic left forgotten… and I will keep you safe for any and all foes we face along the way. However, I only have one small request.”
“Mum—he almost cut me—”
“Yeah, okay,” Harry nodded. Hermione left after Ginny and Ron stepped up to Harry, shaking his head as he leaned against Harry. “That was tactless, mate,” he said.
The cold high voice sent a deadly chill down the teen’s spine. He watched as the Dark Lord walked into the room, looking at him with a cold satisfaction. “You already prove that with your survival of the many deadly and unknown potions, and now you will be useful to me once more, my naïve pawn.”
“Ron, can I call you Ron?” Theo asked. Ron did not move so he continued, “Ron, you’ll find that you can’t be good at everything—”
Mrs. Weasley watched them leave, giving them both a look as though they were overreacting. Ron groaned as they went into Harry’s room and Harry couldn’t help but blush as the Alpha’s scent started to override everything around him. It was stronger than ever before, and he could see a tent forming in his pants. “Ron?”
“Thank you,” Harry smiled, and glanced subtly towards Hermione.
“Fine then… umm… Harry it’s just you and me babe,” Blaise said. “Ice Magic—
They appeared right where they disappeared, and holding hand in hand, with his collar visible to everyone, Harry and Draco walked the streets of Hogsmeade, and into the busy Three Broomsticks. There were glances, obviously, and stares when the students realize what it was that Harry was wearing, but nobody seemed brave enough to ask. Harry waved when he saw Fred and George with Cedric. The twins saw Harry’s collar and gave him a huge grin and thumbs up, causing the younger teen to smile proudly. They went to a corner table and sat close to each other. “Stay boy,” Draco commanded, “I’ll be back.”
Nagini said simply.
“I guess,” Harry grinned. “Then we can finish what we started in your dorm, Malfoy.”
“Blaise, don’t—”
She had yet to tell them where her classroom was, so Harry had to pull out his lip balm and school schedule. The three huddled around the lip balm placed on his schedule. Harry whispered into it, “
“To save everyone,” Dumbledore said fiercely. “This man before you is no man! Tom Riddle is a monster who has murdered and tortured hundreds and will do so again. Minister, everyone, Tom Riddle is no other than Lord Voldemort himself!”
Voldemort chuckled. He could feel his other Horcruxes faintly on the horizon, however, he did not look for them. Instead, he focused entirely on Nagini.
“I was—”
“What’s the whore doing here?” a seventh year demanded.
“Yes Uncle Remus,” Harry said.
Harry allowed the underlining threat to hover in the air, drawing out any tension until he had everyone’s attention and submission. “This will also be seen as a test of loyalty. With that said, let me see, ah, Gibbon, there is a shack at the edge of the property. Somewhere there, there is hidden a ring with a black stone. The ring is gold. Bring it to me, but do not wear it. You may slip it on only in front of me. Just to make sure it is safe for me to wear. Where are the Carrow twins? Ah, there you are. There is a locket, hidden in a cave by a seaside town near London. I must imagine the cave will be filled Dark Creatures and Magic to protect my father’s precious locket. So bring Dolohov with you. The locket is golden with a serpentine ‘S’ on it’s face. Let me think, there is one more…” Harry paused before shaking his head slowly, “This one I will obtain myself. Now, just to be clear…” Harry stood up from his throne and stepped towards the group, his wand in his hand. He stopped in front of the two Lestrange bodies. “I do not care if you die during this. If you do, that will be seen as a show of disloyalty to myself and my departed father. And any disloyalty, even disloyalty in thoughts, will be met with fatal consequences.”
“But Hermione!” Ron groaned. Harry glanced at them and bit his lip, “You’ll be fine,” he said. “Look, it’s just lunch, right? I’ll meet up with you right after, okay. Hermione and I will be in the common room, alright? But don’t just run away.”
Wormtail stopped and turned to Harry, scared. Harry’s scar was burning almost pass his endurance, but he gritted through it. “I’m going to kill you Wormtail!” Harry yelled. “Let that monster drown, or else I’ll make it last!”
“Those who misbehave earns themselves spankings,” Blaise hummed, giving Draco a toothy smile. “Be a good boy now Draco.”
Voldemort hummed as the knives started to heat up. “While my son slept, I took the liberty to explore his mind,” he said. “I witnessed every lashing, every bruise, every cut and every insult thrown at my sweet child. The fat walrus you call a husband did the majority of it, but I also saw what you did as well Petunia. All of those burns, those blows to his head. You are a horrible woman full of vile and jealousy, aren’t you?” Aunt Petunia screamed and muffled, tears falling from her eyes. Voldemort gave a sadistic smirk and left her crying, levitating only a few inches over the ground, her legs and arms still helplessly bound to her sides. He moved to the stove as he talked. “I could simply cut you and your husband up, leave you bleeding till you die, or just simply use the Killing Curse. But there is no satisfaction in that. No real sense of accomplishment. Your sister got a clean, painless death from me. She stood her ground and defended my sweet Harry. It is only right that you suffer for making her sacrifice moot.”
.” The wall slid opened and the two walked through. The Slytherin common room was long with a low ceiling and several fireplaces with chairs around them. The two walked straight through to a set of stairs that led to the boys’ dormitory.
Draco was nervous the entire day. He was dressed in his own Weasley Sweater, a dark emerald sweater with the letter
“I’m calling for help!” said the same scared voice, and Harry heard footsteps running out of the dormitory.
“Then why are you so wet for me already?” Draco chuckled, “Ten more pup, count them out.” He continued his assault on Harry’s butt, smiling as the skin turned into a lovely shade of red and Harry counted out each spank. When Harry finally grunted out “Twenty” his face was blushed and tear-stained, and his ass was just as red. Draco rubbed the butt soothingly and pulled out his wand, allowing his instincts to mutter out a spell. Lotion squirted from his wand’s end and Draco rubbed it in.
Harry pleaded mentally. “That’s interesting,” Hermione muttered. “Did you tell Dumbledore or Professor Lupin this?”
Fill me with your power Father, let your darkness become my being. I belong to you, Fallen Angel, now… and forever.”
Slughorn greeted them all, however it was obvious that he was most excited for Harry. “Harry, m’boy!” Slughorn said, jumping up at the sight of him so that his great velvet-covered belly seemed to fill all the remaining space in the compartment. “Good to see you, good to see you! And you two must be Mr. Malfoy and Mr. Zabini!”
By the end of it all, Voldemort brought enough clothing to fill up several wardrobes, several pairs of shoes along with Harry’s pink shirt, and its matching robes. He shrunk the bags so that Draco could carry them easily and looked outside. He saw no need to go out and wander around as they had nothing else they needed to buy. So he instructed Harry and Draco to hold onto him once more and apparated away.
“You’re getting really good,” he said, beaming around at them. “When we get back from the holidays we can start doing some of the big stuff—maybe even Patronuses.”
“Oh... oh,” Mrs. Weasley nodded, clearly confused but decided not to go further into it. “Either way, both of you are going to help me now. Clean the dishes ready for lunch, I have to get in contact with Dumbledore.”
Harry and Draco’s lives since then in Hogwarts turned to a new, horny normal. They went to class, meeting up whenever they could just for a kiss or holding hands. After their first class with Professor Umbridge, Draco yelled at Harry for being “a stupid hothead who couldn’t keep his mouth shut!” They made up after an argument, and their sexual adventures continued until before Harry knew it, September came and went, October was upon them.
“Shame, cause I kissed Neville,” Niall drawled, “Kissed him
“That’s a weird way of showing it,” Draco muttered.
“I know,” Sirius sighed. “Still, don’t you think it’s weird? Harry wearing Niall’s clothes basically.”
“F-Father,” Harry said hoarsely, clearing his throat. Voldemort smirked as he heard his son. He squeezed tight enough to set a reminder.
Harry turned to Draco. He wanted to relax, but Draco was still glaring out, his wand still in his hand. Silence filled the house. Even their breathing was silent, as both boys were too scared to even break this moment of respite. Then it started again. A long high sound like a knife or claw dragging across the walls. Only this time was on the second floor. Harry’s eyes quickly went to the windows. Draco followed and immediately pointed his wand at them. The curtains shut themselves, and the moon’s light was snuffed out as the scratching slowly gotten louder, closer. Harry stiffened next to Draco, their eyes moving to the wall right next to them. The scrapping continued along, moving closer towards them, turning into a shrill sound as it reached the window causing Harry to flinch and cover his wolf ears. Then it stopped. They heard something sniff, and all of a sudden the scratching started again.
“That was what I was told, and Viktor and I believed it,” Harry shrugged. “Anyway, we dated through the year, and made promises to write and keep in contact, however the last time I saw him was the day he and the other Durmstrang students left.”
“Now, Niall, I want you to write ‘
Mr. Garrison looked at Harry and Draco with a fearful confusion. “What’s going on?” he demanded. Draco walked towards Harry and smiled softly, “I wager we burn him whole but that might hurt your uncles…”
“I see,” Voldemort said, looking disappointed. Harry looked up at his father and frowned. He did not know what he was talking about. “And our loyal followers in Azkaban?”
“Books about Pureblood Society… I’ve read them during the summer of third year,” Harry said, looking to Mrs. Weasley for the first time. Her face was full of empathy, tears brimming as she did her best to dab them away with a napkin. “I… liked the idea, being tied submissively to Draco, I actually loved it. I thought it would be the best way to get him… and Voldemort would give me a chance to talk to him. And he did. During the summer after the Triwizard Tournament, I was at Malfoy Manor… learning the Dark Arts from Voldemort. Between lessons, I would find Draco and talk with him. We began our relationship during the summer, and it was strong… we really do care for each other. It seemed that everything was right, everything was going well… but then…” Harry gave a sharp intake and looked back to his mark. He shuddered, frowning as he tried to collect himself.
“T-Thank you for the offer,” Neville stuttered, “but I’m fine.”
“Fuck that’s right Harry,” Connor breathed. “Gonna fuck your ass with this cock, boy. You want that?”
The five moved to the table, Harry between his two boyfriends, and he licked his lips nervously. As though sensing his nerves, Loki sneaked in to watch. “I know what Satan wants with me…” Harry said softly. “I’m… I’m supposed,” Harry took his breath, “I’m supposed to be his wife.”
Standing up, he gave Harry’s dick a playful smack, which caused the boy to yelp as the demon chuckled and moved over to Draco’s body.
“And how much blood does this—ahh oh fuck—potion needs?” Harry swore as his hand shook, opening the wound to a two inch cut down his arm. Voldemort just stared irritably before moving to a nearby cabinet, opening it to reveal vial after vial of a dark red potion. He took one and closed the cabinet before returning to Harry.
Draco just rolled his eyes and said, “Please entertain him, he’s impossible to deal with by myself.”
“What do you mean?” Harry asked. He turned to Draco, “Draco?”
“The boy asked, so why not be truthful to him,” Sirius shrugged. He sighed and shook his head. “To be serious, Niall, Omegas have to go through more changes than us. As we grow and mature, our bodies will lean naturally towards becoming more muscular, and your scent glands will develop just as Harry’s are developing now.” He pulled down his shirt a little to show off his neck, the skin smooth and nicely tanned. “These little invisible buggers,” he grinned, “hiding under our skin.”
“About what?” Harry asked innocently.
Remus chuckled; he held his glass to Voldemort. “To our boys?”
“I mean—you were the top of the class in our Dark Arts lessons,” Harry said, “When I lost that is… maybe they think you’re a big hero and would do it because they asked? Or like maybe House loyalty.”
Harry glanced down at Nagini.
Yaxley started to stand, but Harry shook his head, “I’ll refill it,” he said, “It is a what a good son and spouse would do.”
The two watched Viktor walk confidently up the stairs, ignorant of the stares and wantful looks from the Hogwarts students around them. Draco grumbled and held Harry closer. “I hate him,” he muttered.
Harry frowned while Draco squeezed his hand. “How do we know that he even is your father, demon?” he asked.
Remus was next and he hugged them even tighter. “Niall, watch out for Harry,” he said.
“That’s horrible,” the bushy-haired girl frowned. “Why would you even think like this?”
“No, I don’t mind at all,” Harry insisted. Mrs. Weasley did not look pleased but hid it with a smile as she nodded. “Thank you,” Harry smiled.
The surface of the grave at Harry’s feet cracked. A fine trickle of dust rose into the air at Wormtail’s command and fell softly into the cauldron. Sparks were sent in all directions.
“Yeah,” Ron smiled, “Brilliant, I’m rubbish but she lets me write off her notes at times.”
Voldemort’s face made the man scream in fear as the blood drained from his face. “Sir, please,” he said.
“I’m alright at it,” Niall shrugged. “Not as great as Harry, however. He’s always been the top of our class since the first day. And it’ll only be a matter of time until he’s the top here too—sorry Hermione.”
“Good, no meddling from Dumbledore or the Ministry?”
When Harry and Blaise returned home, Harry noticed that Blaise was missing his shadow again. “Can your shadow take a physical form?” Harry asked.
Draco stared at him for a moment and sneered before he could stop himself. He realized what he did and sighed, his face looking utterly dejected. “I fucked up. I saw his hand after Umbridge’s detention. It was raw like he was hurt, and I just felt concerned. He walked right by me and I used my Voice.”
“For your blood purity, without marriage you need a pureblood who will adopt you, which is me,” Voldemort explained. “I’ve had the potion prepared, the ritual to make you my scion, however, will have to wait for this one will cause moderate pain, and needs hours to set in.”
Nagini chastised but hissed her tongue against Harry’s cheek softly.
Harry stared at the Dark Lord, his heart still pounding, but his tears have finally dried. He looked at the man and tried to envision what he looked, his mind went to the Tom Riddle he saw in the diary and tried to make him older in his mind. Something small but growing quickly wanted to see that, wanted to see that man standing in front of him in the flesh.
Quidditch
“Perhaps, but we should first do tests to make sure,” Mr. Riddle said. “I am just saying that, based on the heated looks, it is quite easily that our Dark Lord has chosen you to carry his child, or a specific child…”
His eyes fell on Harry. “Stand, boy.”
“Not now,” Harry groaned, “I still feel weird.”
“Why would I be? Honestly, Weasley if I thought this would be a waste of time, I would have left already,” Daphne shrugged. “So, friendly date from here on?”
“That small twiggy boy?” Krum asked, obvious jealousy in his voice. “You deserve a real man, Harry!” He flexed his arms in emphasis. Harry giggled and shrugged.
“Yeah but—”
The two got the dementors’ attention. Still holding Harry to the wall, Voldemort turned to the dark creatures. “Dementors, you know who I am. We are common allies of the Dark Side, move aside and allow me passage to my followers. We have our agreements.”
Theo nodded. “Harry was sitting with Blaise and Daphne, actually being civil, when Daphne said the ‘m’ word, you know the one.” Ron nodded, his eyes widening in slight shock. “Well, from what I heard from Blaise, both Harry and Draco were yelling at her. Harry stomped away, and afterwards Draco continued yelling at the girl when he came back.”
“In simplest terms, you and Harry should never have been sent to the muggles,” Remus explained. The Omega knelt down so that they could be at eye level. “Your parents left a will when they died. In it, they left you two everything, and gave us the responsibility to raise the two of you.”
“Is this true?” the Minister asked. “Mr. Potter?”
“What does that mean?” Ron asked, looking confused.
Harry looked up and grimaced. Daphne Greengrass stood in front of him, looking somewhat uncomfortable and awkward. “Hello,” she said.
“One day,” Harry said distractedly as he examined the cube. On the top was a contraption, looking as though several parts that pushed together to close and open the cube. He placed it on his bed for now before turning to Loki. “Is there anything else?” he asked sweetly, but Loki seemed to be very excited.
“Ahh, if I was going to inspect Harry’s body like that again,” Blaise smirked. “No, no, the next time I’ll be inspecting Harry’s body it’ll be more personal… but I think we can talk about that later… for now… how much do you know about this Mrs. Riddle?”
Nagini looked annoyed, but she shook her head.
“But he’s my brother, I have to protect him,” Niall frowned.
“She is the mother of demons, sir,” Harry answered. “She was the First Wife before the False Lord cast her aside for Eve.”
A man with long black hair came charging out of a door facing Harry. “Shut up, you horrible old hag! Shut up!” he roared, seizing the curtains and, with difficulty, closed them again. Panting slightly, and sweeping his long dark hair of his eyes, Harry’s godfather, Sirius, turned to face him. “Hello Harry,” he said grimly, “I see you’ve met my mother.”
Summer passed in a romantic bliss, filled with kissing and full-moon sex that was followed by a morning after potion. Their letters came, and Harry and Draco congratulated each other on becoming Quidditch Captains of their teams. Draco, Ron, and Hermione have reached a rocky agreement that were stable enough that, when it was time to leave for Hogwarts, Draco helped carried Hermione’s belongings, along with Harry’s.
“You’re not—”
“Yeah, don’t you think it’s a good idea?” Harry asked.
“I know you do,” Harry said, “anyway, since you know about my strangeness with Draco, how about you? Do you have your eyes on any Omega?”
The Dark Lord wondered.
And then he was gone.
“I brought Draco with me and we’re going to be doing homework,” Harry yelled loudly. “That okay?”
It felt hot. He groaned as the throbbing continued, his head pounding against itself as he couldn’t get comfortable. It hurt to close his eyes, and it hurt even more to keep them open. He was still wide awake, groaning and shifting in his bed when the other boys came in. “You alright Harry?” Dean asked. “You don’t sound good.”
“So you’re just horny for my brother? Is that it?”
Harry looked down at the wand and then to Draco. He stepped forward and slipped the wand back into Draco’s pocket. Draco grabbed his hand. “Weasley will never become the Alpha that I am,” he whispered. His power surged, surrounding the Omega. Harry let out an unintentional moan and stepped away.
“We have every right,” Sirius yelled.
Draco said nothing as he did not know what exactly to say. Instead he just nodded and stayed quiet for a moment. They walked down the hallway in silence for a while before Harry said, “When we learn to turn into animals… I’ll turn into a snake and slither into Mr. Riddle’s office and find out what he’s planning.”
“God I hate it when you’re right,” Niall grumbled. “I’m guessing you’re going to reward Malfoy with a kiss for all of this?” Harry’s cheeks turned red and he looked away.
“And I’m surprised you didn’t, Lilith,” Bellatrix said. “After all, you know what happens once those wedding bells happen… you’ll be tossed in the room with all his other whores.”
“Professor Lupin,” Harry groaned, “he came here monthly. My dad and Sirius learned to be Animagus to keep him company.” Draco hummed and allowed Harry to pull him into the bedroom. “Don’t you dare shift, pup,” Draco commanded. “I want to be inside you when you do.”
“Good weird or bad weird?” Draco asked.
“I know, but this is to protect you from the
“So, you decided to become Harry Potter’s teacher?”
“He was, he had an Omega,” Harry answered.
“A French shop in the outskirts of the country,” Draco explained, “it holds the Darkest Objects and books that I know of. Father brought me there frequently during business.”
“A poison,” Harry answered. “Draco and I want to brew a poison that will strangle the drinker in three days.”
“Will you be safe?” was Uncle Remus’s reply.
“It is, isn’t it?” Harry smiled, “You’re jealous that I became friends with Ron, who’s the first Alpha the Weasleys had in generations, instead of you, Alpha Draco Malfoy.”
Weasley will make sure we win,
“We can’t do much by ourselves,” Ron said in a defeated voice. “I mean, all right, we can go and look jinxes up in the library and try and practice them, I suppose—”
“What’s the matter?” Draco asked.
“Hiding? Pansy Parkinson, we are not hiding anything,” Harry said, giving her a sly smile. “Draco and I are dating, and, god willing, we will marry with the submissive clause once we’re both of age. We started dating just as this train was heading away from Hogwarts.”
“Don’t worry Neville, we know it wasn’t you,” Harry smiled, “You’re too goodhearted and honest to do something like this.” Neville smiled with a blush. Harry held onto his bonding necklace, playing with it as he talked.
Harry and Draco both glanced at Blaise throughout the lesson, paying only half attention to what their teacher was saying. At the end of the lesson, Draco and Harry followed Blaise with some interest as he had a look of annoyance. “All wrong, “was all he said, shaking his head slightly. “There are six elements, yes, but none of them are akin to my father as so. He has a library full of books about that subject. I spent years in that library gathering knowledge and power.”
“Complicity neutral,” Draco corrected.
“Ohh…”
The morning lasted too quickly for Harry’s liking. Like Hermione said, they spent it preparing for the next D.A. meeting, as well as talking with other Gryffindors in the common room. At a quarter to four, Harry excused himself and left the common room, turning a corner and entered the nearest closet. He did not bother turning on the lights, instead he stared at the red eyes. “Bring me to Yaxley’s home,” he demanded and walked into the darkness, the vial of the Strangler clutched firmly in his pocketed hand.
“Sorry, but I’m so tired,” he said.
“My apologies,” Voldemort said, “what happened?” He allowed a little more of his power flow, hiding his satisfaction under a concerned smile. Remus Lupin glanced at Voldemort and sighed sadly.
“I think we’re not being followed,” Niall panted. They both leaned against the tree, Harry falling onto his brother. “Are you alright?”
“Difficult to say,” Dumbledore muttered. “However, there should be no reason for either of you to be separate over long distances. And if so, we shall figure out ways to prepare for that.”
“True,” Niall nodded, “and the only real conversation I had with Neville is telling him to eat more.” Harry chuckled and shook his head.
Draco nodded and looked at the compartment, “I trust them, pet,” he said.
