Potter sat and seemed about ready to fall into his food. He looked so exhausted. Draco tapped his shoulder lightly and Potter looked at him. Draco had never seen him look so...tired. "There are too many voices. Too many eyes. It's hurting."
Harry smiled just as big, suddenly awake again. "Excellent!" He leaned forward and rested their foreheads together. "We have all year to learn each others pet peeves and such. And all the boring stuff, like looking for a house and buying it."
Harry didn't turn until both boys were in the building and the door was shut behind them. He crouched down and helped Draco stand up.
So when he conjured his potronus for the very first time in class, everyone was shocked that he was able to make one at all. That he had a happy enough memory to use for the spell.
It was about an hour before dinner when Harry moved. He needed to get them food and make sure the spot he had in mind was still good. It had been a few years since he was there last and he didn't know if anyone else had found it yet.
When they walked through the door McGonagall was surprised to see them. Her eyes ran over the two of them and looked half way between disappointed and exasperated.
"I think I might do something like you're planning." Draco said, his hand not stopping it's soothing motions.
"Are you awake?" Harry whispered, the arm around Draco's shoulder shifting so fingers were running through his hair.
"Draco, hey look at me." Harry climbed onto the bed and kneeled in front of the blond. He slowly reached forward and tried to remove Draco's hands from his hair. "Draco, let go of your hair. You're hurting yourself, please stop." Draco's eyes were glassy and obviously not seeing Harry sitting right in front of him.
Potter was the one to give the password for the portrait but other than that neither said a word. Draco didn't say anything when he gently grabbed Potter's wrist and pulled him to his room. As comfortable as their usual corner was, there were still too many people in the common room, half of whom had turned to look at them when they entered.
Draco was once again crying and started pulling violently at his hair. "Why am I awake? This only happens when I'm dreaming."
The two of them were tucked in a corner of the common room, with the fire blazing right in front of them. Pansy was doing what looked to be transfiguration homework, but Draco didn't actually try to see what it really was. He just stared into the flames, letting the mesmerizing show over the logs detach him from his sense of time. To distract him from the whispers he could still hear, the glares and sneers he could still feel.
It has been such a long week for Draco so far, and it was only Tuesday. They were barely through the second month of the first term, how the hell was he supposed to survive the rest of the year? But being Tuesday had good classes today. The only saving grace, no pun intended, was who all was in his classes with him on Tuesdays, and Tuesdays only.
Harry nodded and led the way to the kitchens to grab their food. Next he lead that outside to grab his broom. "Are you okay with flying there?" He asked mounting the broom. Draco responded by taking the basket of food and climbing on behind Harry.
The tension returned to Draco's shoulders when he felt Harry's fingers run through his hair. It was getting longer and he hated it, he wanted it gone.
Draco didn't know why Harry was telling him all this, but he was glad that he was trusted enough to be told these secrets. He knew that he wasn't brave enough to say anything, but Draco hoped that his actions would be enough. Draco pulled their hands closer to him and placed a soft kiss on the back of Harry's hand.
When he looked back to him, Draco returned the smile he found on Harry's face. "Would you like to go to Hogsmeade with me on Friday? On a date?" Harry asked and Draco's smile widened as he nodded.
Harry walked out of his room, after looking up and down the hall, hoping to avoid any and all people. Once he was alone again, Draco decided to change into his pajamas. A t-shirt that was a little too big and an old pair of joggers. He looked around his room, debating if it was even worth cleaning up. Draco decided against it just as his door opened.
He walked to where Harry's bag was sitting in a puddle and handed it over. Harry passed back his wand and Draco nodded his thanks before continuing with his mission to apologize.
He took in a shuddering breath and held it before pushing it out, trying to push out most of his negative feelings with it. "I'm sorry." He whispered into the bed pushing down another wave of tears.
That is until Harry's fingers traced over a different hateful message that was scribbled over the notes he was taking for that class. "How often does this happen?" His voice was so soft when he asked. Draco didn't answer. He looked at his bag out of the corner of his eye and felt his head hang. Logically Draco knew that Harry wasn't angry with him, but he still felt like he was about to get into trouble. "Why haven't I seen this happening when we have class together."
The little clearing had a nice view of the lake without being visible to people on the shores. The only reason he found this place was because he was flying over it, looking for a place no one could bother him.
That didn't mean people would look past what he supposedly did and was forced to do. Everyone needed someone to hate, and who better than someone who was right in front of them.
He looked up to Potter and just stared. Potter had his eyes closed and his head was tilted so far back it looked uncomfortable. Potter readjusted how he was sitting so he was more slouched and looking into the fire as well. In doing so he shifted closer to Draco so their shoulders were touching and Potters knees were almost resting on Draco's thighs.
Draco's eyes widened at the gesture. He wasn't cold, not this close to the fire, but the weight of the blanket was nice. Not just that, it was reminisce of all the times he would wake up alone in this exact spot and be covered in a quilt.
Draco curled himself even tighter, like he could put his walls back up if he was smaller. He knew it was futile, they were gone and he was exposed for everyone to see and poke at.
Harry seemed to melt into his bed at the contact. "They don't trust you. They think you're gonna try something, trick me into doing something bad or something."
Draco watched as he disappeared and nodded in agreement when Pansy voiced his thoughts of "I wonder what that was about."
When Draco had calmed down a little he relaxed the white knuckle grip he hand on the covers and put his head on Harry's shoulder. He managed to steady his breathing after a minute.
He was almost finished eating when Potter had taken the place next to him, so Draco finished and waiting for Potter to finish his meal before they both stood up and walked in silence to the eighth years tower.
That is until someone sat down next to him well within his personal bubble. But not just someone, Potter.
ask if I can first. Everyone else just waits for me to do it, you don't." Harry laughed against the back of Draco's neck and for some reason it helped him relax. "Hermione apologized to me at breakfast today. She doesn't really get it, but she's trying to. She said she'd try and get Ron to too. When he finally swallows his pride, you think you'd be up for eating with us?"
Harry felt Draco's reaction and some how made the right connection. "Do you want me to cut it for you? I can't promise it will be an even cut though."
He walked to dinner in a kind of haze and didn't eat very much. Draco didn't pay attention to what was happening around him until there was commotion at the Gryffindor table. He looked up in time to see Harry glare at his friends and storm out of the Great Hall.
After some time Harry took a deep breath to speak but couldn't seem to force the words out. Draco squeezed his hand in encouragement. "Everyone still wants me to be him. To be the great Harry Potter, Savior of the wizarding world. But I can't be him any more. It too much, I can't do it anymore."
Of course, she would have gone anyway and they all knew it. Nothing would keep her from experiencing Harry’s first time boarding the Express.
“Of course,” Lily said handing Harry over to his guard, “but you must know,” she added before releasing him, “if he is harmed in any way, it will mean not only your death but the death of your whole line.”
Lily had been too busy fighting the soul piece of Riddle to pay attention. It had taken forever to defeat that thing, but she had gained some vital information about him.
“Look at me, Draco.” Harry’s voice was gentle despite their fight moments before and it hit worse than any spell. Potter had always been magnetic. But he’d always thought of them as opposite poles, ever pushing the other away. Now here they were four years after Hogwarts and everything that had happened and Potter was trying to pull him in. Wanted a connection rather than to keep pushing each other away. When Draco turned to look back at Potter he found it hard to breathe. There wasn’t a trace of anger left on his face. No animosity. Just concern and something like hope.
He just narrowly escaped a nasty hex as he rounded the corner back onto the street panting and took off once again to find another alleyway he could take to get around and behind the man. He prayed to whatever gods would listen that he would make it in time. That this daft plan would actually work. That Harry would be okay.
Beth laughed, “Oh, about Henry you do. But so do I about Anne I’m sure so we’re even on that.” She winked and Draco shook his head. Some customers entered then and Beth left to see to them, Draco sipping the last of his latte. He did not gush about Potter. Clearly, he was just good at this whole pretending to be engaged thing. That was all. Besides he was still irritated with Potter. The man just didn’t know when to stop pushing people.
Henry Varma. Apprentice wandmaker, most recently lived in Paris with boyfriend Damien Leclair an author/ghost writer. Moved to London for his new job. Or so the short cover story Harry was just handed says. The trunk full of collared shirts, vests and pressed pants all in tweed and check would indicate his usual go to wardrobe of old band shirts and jeans isn't going to be allowed on this mission. Just great. At least Malfoy looked just as displeased by the contents of his own trunk if the slight sneer on his face was any indication. Apparently the trunk wasn't filled with Malfoys usual tailored suits. Harry scanned his new partner's current attire wondering how expensive it was to get a suit that well fitting, because Malfoy for all his faults certainly didn't look bad.
“How do you know what others feel? How can I know what he-” he cut himself off with a shake of his head, fist clenched at his sides. He couldn’t ask this of the other man. He couldn’t allow himself to be so exposed. He was toeing a dangerous line already. He should really go.
Malfoys expression for a moment was unreadable but a sneer quickly twisted his features, “No, they’re just asking us to pretend to be in love.”
Yet before he could make for the exit a gentle weight landed on his bicep and Harry looked up to find Ollivander smiling gently at him. Sadly, even. As if he understood without Harry finishing the question.
Harry huffed and ran a hand through his already messy hair (despite his hair tie’s valiant effort at maintaining it in a low bun), the other hand balled tightly at his side, “Would you just let me finish?”
Draco was straining to keep from smiling but Potter didn’t need to know that as he went on, “It’ll look better after we place and decorate it.”
Harry threw himself into the investigation the rest of the day. He scoured the area, checking and recharging dormant spellwork they’d cast. Going over even leads he had cast out as unlikely. He didn’t go back to the apartment for lunch and he didn't go back for dinner, opting instead for food that was as fast and cheap as his poor judgment had been. He wanted to give Draco space despite knowing he couldn't put off his partner, his auror partner, forever.
“Henry, here,” Malfoy, Damien, settled a hand on his arm, “has a large family so we were thinking portkeys of course if we ever do come to a decision on where in France we’ll be setting it. I’d prefer the beach, he wants a church, I'm sure you know how it goes.” Malfoy laughed. They’d been making a show of affection towards each other during the interviews. To gauge the planner's reaction, of course. Harry absentmindedly found himself reaching over to entwine their hands; the cool metal of the engagement ring Malfoy wore wasn’t unpleasant against his own skin. Their current interview was with an elderly witch, Mrs. Kinsington, who had met with two of the couples that later became victims. While Harry hardly believed in coincidence he was pretty sure this woman wasn’t the vicious murderer they were looking for. For one, she probably weighed eighty pounds soaking wet. Another clue being a framed and dated looking picture of a younger woman that was probably the witch’s daughter embracing another witch at what looked to be their wedding. No, Harry doubted the warmth in her eyes as she spoke about alternative venues to “fit both of them” was faked. Harry smiled at her and gave Malfoy’s hand a gentle squeeze. To get his attention.
Draco wanted to hex someone, to hit something and resolutely was fighting against the hot tears he could feel threatening to spill behind his eyes. He couldn’t break down. Not now, not people were still depending on him to figure this out. Potter’s growl of frustration as he paced the small room brought him out of his own thoughts, turning to glare at the other man. Potter looked as angry as he felt and the furious pacing was clearly doing him no good. Draco dropped in his desk chair like a sack of bricks and muttered though his hands covering his face,
Something in Harry’s chest broke at that and before he knew it he’d pulled Malfoy into his arms, just holding him. After the initial shock Malfoy relaxed into his embrace, shuddering and Harry ignored the dampness soaking through his shirt where Malfoy burrowed his face into the crook of his neck and shoulder. He held him in silence for a moment, just rubbing circles on his back with one hand and holding him tight against him with the other. When he did speak his own voice felt hoarse,
Draco was in fact a fan of greek food, which is why it almost pained him to say, “I’m afraid we can’t tonight. We’ve other plans already.” Like patrolling the area and sweeping the stores and surrounding areas with discrete spells for anything that might relate to their case for hours in the dark and ever colder weather.
Harry cleaned on impulse. He cleaned when he was anxious or angry or in this case; confused. Merlin was he at odds. His heart and his mind seemed to be having a duel and there was no amount of deep breathing or reading that could calm him. So he cleaned. He threw himself into dusting and decluttering and used his wand as little as possible because well he’d grown up cleaning this way and the habit had stuck.
“They very well could be, if they were murdered, but Fae are immortal, Sirius, and not that easy to kill,” Lily said with a small smile, “as to what happened to Godric and Helga, I have no idea.”
“I am Lily Potter, Neville Longbottom’s godmother,” Lily answered waving her hand sending the old man into the wall and rushing to comfort a crying Neville. “Shh, baby it’s okay Aunty Lily is here.”
Harry concentrated on the feeling, he had been trying for a week and had managed two days ago, when he had wanted light. He smiled widely when he felt the tingle again. He never thought he would be able to do it twice so close together. He could hear his mother encouraging him. He pictured Dudley in his mind and felt his body shudder.
“Course not, my Aunt Lily was believed to be non-magical born,” Neville said, causing the girl to blush again. “It’s just that magical born tend to not ask so many questions if any. They think they know it all already, you see.”
“Thanks, Aunt Lily,” Neville said, moving to kiss his Aunt on the cheek. He grabbed Harry’s hand after he bid his mother goodbye and pulled him towards the sacred space.
“I’m not staying in that little room, and he can’t have my second bedroom, it’s mine,” the two boys said in sync and then turned to glare at each other. Harry had to try really hard to be mean and to dumb himself down, even with all his practice.
“Not so much fun being looked down upon for your circumstances of birth, is it?” Khidell asked, a smirk on his face.
“As you say, my Prince,” Caspain said, giving Neville one last look of contempt before ignoring him again.
“There are many inside trying to talk them out of their plan of attack. Some members of the Ministry were at the train station and saw you themselves, so they are not so keen to enter into their own slaughter. They are planning a decree to override a vote and charge in. They have no set date as of yet.”
“Why? Why help us, help any of us? Fae are not particularly kind to wizards and witches,” Augusta asked, taking a seat.
Sirius paused in his writing, and looked up at Lily, “didn’t the Fae help build Hogwarts?” he asked, remembering something he had read in the Black library.
“Yes, I can see that. It looks like there have been other wards added to the Castle itself, without being anchored here. That is not good, the wards are like a house of cards right now. It is not safe for anyone here.”
“Normal?” Neville asked, “really Harry, you think you can be normal in the Wizarding World. Harry Potter, the Wizarding World's only hope.”
“I will be your visible guard with Caspian,” Siofra said and laughed at Harry’s blush. He had quite the epic crush on Caspian.
Meri grunted in acknowledgement of his orders, but a frown was prominent on his face. He would have liked to kill quite a few of these so-called magicals, just for the way they were eyeing his future King.
“Well,” Alice said blushing slightly, before recovering. “Still Gussy would have a hard time with the ritual and Frank would never risk her that way.”
“It might be a good idea if I have access to all the halflings last names, both from their mothers and fathers to see if we have any more lost children,” Khidell said, frowning. How did this happen, he thought to himself. “It could be another explanation for the large number of halflings.”
Moments before the voice had appeared in his mind, he had been in immense pain. His scar had split open and a black like tar had oozed out of it until it bled red again, and it seemed to close up on its own. Then the voice of an angel entered his mind.
“I know how to defeat Voldemort. I know things about him that you do not,” Dumbledore answered looking smug.
“Dè tha còir agam a ràdh?” Harry asked, “Hi, mise do chompanach, agus Rìgh san àm ri teachd, air mo ghlùinean romham.”
Caspian looked at Dumbledore, frowning as the man’s mind was open to him. It was a disturbing place to be, but he managed to find a place to drop him, grabbed the old man and disappeared in a flash of smoke.
At the nods of agreement, Lily, on Harry’s other side, waved her hand at the doors and as they flew open the group walked into the gobsmacked expressions of the teachers standing in Great Hall. Lily could tell they were trying to figure out how to get out of the room.
“It is the Sire bond, your Highness,” Khidell said, his face expressing his awe for all to see. “I read about it when preparing for Harry to become King. It has only happened a few times in the history of our kind, where magic has chosen advisors and protectors for the King.
“I have no idea why you let that filth stay in our castle,” Godric said from Lily’s left side, Helga nodded her agreement from Lily’s right.
“Yes Lady Lily,” Daisy said with a relieved smile, “Daisy will waits for your call,” and popped away.
“I see,” Sirius said, relieved. Harry had an army of Unseelie to keep him safe. “But why is there a Royal Guard when there are no Royals or were no Royals?” Sirius asked.
“Lady Lily has bought us home,” Daisy said as she looked around, “place needs lots of work,” she added, distressed.
“What shall we do?” Caspian asked. “This will be very hard on Harry when the instincts of the Fae is to touch him.”
“For those staying,” Professor McGonagall said as she got up after Lily sat down, “Headmistress Potter had kindly provided some entertainment for us. The Falmouth Falcons will be playing a charity match against the Appleby Arrows on the quidditch pitch after lunch,” she finished getting a cheer from the magicals in the Great Hall.
“Well he should do it more often, he is adorable,” Caspian said causing Harry to poke him, hard, and Draco to blush, even though he continued to laugh.
“They seem fine, but there is something you should see,” Ivy said as she walked over to Harry’s side and pushed his hair, which to Lily’s surprise was now long, behind his ears, causing her to gasp.
He looked back at his mummy and at her smile, took a deep breath and placed his hand on the Crest, “ouch,” he muttered but held still, until he felt a gentle push on his hand, and he moved it back to study it. “No ouchie mummy,” he said as he studied his hand, poking at it.
“That’s okay,” Harry said, slightly saddened by that, but still happy to have at least one of them with him, “I have you,” he finished, smiling at her. She never commented on the fact his smile was a little shaky.
“Well if nothing else, it will be fun to mess with him. It has been rather boring here. Nothing but training, etiquette lessons and the like,” Neville said, trying and failing to contain a yawn. Though he did enjoy the fighting lessons, Nyad was a badass teacher, and Godric was awesome when he stepped in to help with training.
He was still surprised by the fact that he was never looked down on as a halfling like Neville sometimes was, but he supposed being the future King had a lot to do with it. Unseelie and Seelie alike were waiting to see him off, causing him to blush slightly.
“How?” Harry asked intrigued. He had figured out almost immediately that the voice was his mother. She could not talk to him all the time, she had said it would be a while before she could be with him always. She had to regain her strength. Harry didn’t really understand what it all meant, he was just happy she was with him.
Harry frowned but moved over to where Neville was under the hat and startled slightly as the stool enlarged. He took the hint and sat, and wasn’t at all surprised when the hat grew and covered both their heads.
They arrived on Diagon Alley in a flash of smoke, and Harry let out a strange squeaking sound at the look of Caspian and the rest of the guard in full battle uniform. At the nudge from his mother, he quickly rearranged his features and began the stroll down the Alley.
It was unusual for someone her age to make the guard, but she was not the only young one to make it. Caspian and Meri were also yet to go through their final awakening.
“Can you inform my mother about what we just learnt, make sure you mention the Prefect thing and this Ronald Weasley so she can look into that too. No need to give the others extra work for someone who is incompetent.”
There was always the possibility that Sirius would find his Fated one day, but both of them chose to ignore that possibility and be happy with each other.
“Of course Alice, Harry wouldn’t never let any harm befall Neville, no matter how angry he was,” Meri said, amused by her alarm. “Though by the time Nyad is finished with him, who can say how well he will be able to function.”
“Mummy, don’t be mean to Siofra, she doesn’t know any better,” Harry said frowning at his mother. “We just need to teach her.”
“How are you ever going to survive us reentering the world of the so-called tainted, Siofra?” Harry asked, in clear amusement.
“We may have been trying out a few things on the captives,” Frank said, nonchalantly, while examining his nails.
“It went quite well, a lot of matches were made, but nothing out of the ordinary,” Khidell said as he made room for Lily to sit beside him.
“Yes, your mother had him moved to a more central point. It would not look good if you found your mate at first touch,” Capsian said, and Harry could hear the sympathy in his tone. He knew how much Harry hated this part. “If it makes you feel any better, I made sure Luna was further down,” he added, pleased with the small laugh he drew from his future King. “Unfortunately she seems to have moved herself next to Draco.”
This was to be my QB for this year but I didn’t get to 50k yet. So I decided to split this into a series. This is part 1 of the Legacy series.
“I assure you, with magic all things are possible,” Lily said and frowned at her sister, “sit Petunia, I want to have a word with you.”
“Really, you want to ask Danu if she put your mother in danger?” Harry said, looking at his Uncle in astonishment.
“I promise, if any get out of hand you can deal with them however you like,” Harry said before adding quickly, “except by killing them.”
“It will probably help with our appearance as well,” Nyx said as he walked back into the common room. He had been warding the other rooms in the Gryffindor Suites.
“Oh, yes I have those,” Lily said and held out her hand calling the items forth, “I always thought they were just family heirlooms.”
“New teachers have been brought in, new classes added and old ones returned. The Prefects and Head Boy and Girl will be reviewed and either left in place or replaced as we check their records, and of course the most important thing, Hogwarts will go back to being free. Any tuition paid this year will be returned and the only expense for attending here is your uniforms and school supplies. Though please note that any family struggling with the cost, the Foundation has funds set aside to help out.”
“You are all tainted beyond the pale,” Siofra answered, scowling at him. “The magic in your veins is weak, diluted, pitiful…”
He could feel his mother smiling, and the echo of an embrace in his mind. He loved those feelings but also wished he could feel her real arms wrapped around him.
The cloak had been in hiding with them, but the night before Voldemort came for them they could not find it. “Dumbledore,” she ground out as she left the room, the corner of her eye, catching some Potter Grimoires popping in and disappearing.
’. He really hated that term, especially since his mother ran Elphyne while he was still growing and training.
“Many are already dead, and when we have finished here, and head back into the magical world the rest will follow.”
“We need to leave now,” Khidell said as he entered the room, glaring slightly at a blushing Siofra. “Neville is already waiting with your mother, and his parents.”
“Watch your tongue,” Harry snapped, his eyes shining in his anger, “brother or not, some lines you do not cross,” he finished before storming off, Caspain following him, all amusement was gone from his face.
“Yes,” Charlus said, “I remember James using the library to try and find something, but he was tight-lipped about the whole thing.”
“Lady Lily,” the little elf shrieked, “how are we be getting Lady Lily back. Oh and little Lord Harry, Daisy be trying to find you for years,” the little elf shrieked again, beyond overwhelmed by the Potters.
“Maybe we should discuss how Danu would have been perfectly happy to have your owl named after her,” Neville said smugly to Harry from his place beside his grandmother.
“We shall have a gathering in Elphyne on Saturday,” Lily said, then turned to Khidell. “Tell Aven and Leeta to organise it. Track any halflings that are strong enough to cause a reaction should they touch their fated and make sure they are on the list. No, better yet,” she added, changing her mind, “ we shall take all the halflings, even the ones that are not ready for the gatherings and show them where they come from.”
It had started as hero worship when he was seven and became an epic crush when Harry turned twelve. Even now at seventeen, after all his time in Elphyne, he still thought the man was beautiful. He only hoped his mate would be just as lovely. Or that he didn’t have one so he could choose.
A small smile played on Harry’s lips at the look on Capsian’s face. He turned to Neville and actually laughed at the look of horror on his face. Caspian had never threatened Neville before, and Harry couldn’t say it wasn’t amusing to see.
“Yes, of course, he is my official Heir now, since you fobbed off the responsibility to him,” Helga said with a small laugh at the look Harry gave her. “Yes, I know, my King,” she added, “you have a lot of responsibilities.”
“No!” Harry exclaimed, “the fates wouldn’t be so cruel.” Harry reached for Neville’s hand and squeezed it when the other boy grabbed on. “Besides, I’m pretty sure my mate is going to be male,” Harry added, trying to reassure his godbrother.
“What has that freak done this time?” Vernon asked, because as far as he was concerned his freak of a nephew was the blame for all the bad things in their lives. He followed his wife's finger, to where she was pointing and did a double-take, “Dudley?” he asked.
“I will not let anything interfere with the gathering, Nyad. We leave for Elphyne tomorrow, but maybe in the morning a full guard and I shall take Harry shopping in Diagon Alley, make sure the information is leaked to the press. I shall have Meri inform Luna so her father may write it up for his paper.”
“Come, let’s prepare. Neville, your parents are bringing Luna and her family along. They will meet you after your cleansing.”
She pulled herself together and then stood, making her way to the ballroom, which, she figured, would have enough space for the retrieval spell. “Omnium oculis res redeant ad me“,” she said, her hands glowing brightly. She conjured a chair and sat, as things started to pop into the room.
The second thing that changed was that Dudley was shown less affection and was not spoilt so much. The Dursley’s were determined to treat both boys the same, so they wouldn’t hurt their Dudley by accident, but that didn’t mean they wanted to spoil Harry Potter in the same way.
“Well,” Neville said, swallowing thickly. He knew it could have been him as well if not for his Aunt Lily. He could imagine how bad that would have been. “Maybe we will both find out Fated at Hogwarts,” Neville added changing the subject.
“What is this about, witch?” he asked gruffly. “And know that if you waste my time I will have both your heads.”
“Well then, another good reason to go to Hogwarts, in case our fated are there,” Harry said with a satisfied smile, then he frowned. “But having to touch all those people. It’s the one part I hate about the gatherings.” Neville rolled his eyes at Harry. “You will help though right, Neville?” Harry asked batting his eyelashes at his godbrother, smirking.
“Just another thing to add to my list,” Lily sighed. She didn’t need to travel by Floo, but she needed it set up for incoming calls or visitors. She still had to find out about Alice and Frank and why they didn’t have Harry.
“Your King saved your life this day, remember that,” Lily hissed harshly before turning to her son. She pulled him from Khidells’ hold and held him close. “What is it, sweetheart?”
Lily pulled her son close and held on as her laughter mingled with her tears and she finally purged the last of her grief. “We never did get enough time together,” Lily said as she pulled back from her son.
She couldn’t help her laughter and the look on her son’s face and he flung his hand out, coping her movements and frowned when nothing happened.
Neville gulped loudly, cursing himself for his slip. He and Harry had teased each other all their lives, so it was sometimes hard to remember that Harry would be his King. He had to admit this was the first time Harry had ever reacted that badly. He usually gave better than he got, so Neville was horrified at his actions and the pain he had caused Harry.
“Fawkes the phoenix, Godric Gryffindor’s own familiar, choose to stay behind and guide the future Headmasters in the running of the school. But over the years, things were changed that were not supposed to be. Headmasters put their own spin on the rules and classes, the Ministry got involved where they were not supposed to and Hogwarts fell short of its origins.
“They were so panicked and stressed they were sent to let off some tension. I think they are in the dungeons again. They even dragged Remus with them.”
“Of course, my chosen can do many things, tell him Draco, while I die quietly over here,” Harry said, screwing his eyes shut tightly at the pain wracking through his body. Neville moved back to his place besides Luna, trying and failing to hide his laughter.
She smiled at her son as they made their way down the stairs and into the kitchen where she heard her sister.
Hermione plopped down in her seat, a stunned look on her face, while Draco Malfoy burst out laughing, causing half the group of people outside the carriage to laugh with him and the other half to stare at him in shock.
She sighed as she felt the magic build-up, and for the first time was glad for the wards the old coot put up. It would dampen the awakening magic. She knew this was coming, she wouldn’t have been able to do the things she had done in his mind if he wasn’t going to be like her. She had clung to that part of him that lay dormant in his body, using it to achieve her goals.
“Give them both to me,” Lily said and gently took the items from the elf, trying to contain her rage.
“You are the mother to the future King. You deserve the respect and the title, your Highness. And since you are Seelie, Harry is both Seelie and Unseelie, making him the King of the Fae.” Rugnuk said. “As for bowing, the Goblins used to serve the Fae, until the King was lost and the Fae became Seelie and Unseelie.
“Let’s go, guards first. Caspian, Nyx, stay close to Harry and Neville,” Lily commanded, as the first of the guards entered the portal set for Hogwarts gates.
Neville held his hands up in surrender, “fine, fine, I give. Arsehole,” he added just loud enough for Harry to hear, causing Harry to smirk at him.
“It’s fine,” Harry said, while Caspian frowned. “But we don’t tend to let people just fire questions at us,” he added at Capsians look.
“Today is a very special day for our people,” Lily started, smiling at the crowd. “Today we will be heading back to Elphyne for one of our most honoured traditions, the Gathering. We hold these events so that our kind may find their life partners if they have one. Many among you have been discovered as halflings, and as such have been invited to attend this event, Seelie and Unseelie alike will be attending in hopes of discovering their other half.
“You say that now,” Lily said smirking at Nyad, “just remember our conversation,” she added. “Now, leave a few other guards to continue spying on the Ministry, I need you to take over watching Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy and to bring them to Elphyne tomorrow just before the gathering.”
“Let’s get started then, shall we,” Harry said, moving into position, and waiting for the first person to approach him.
“The Founder’s and I, along with the remaining Professors spend a lot of time reviewing the changes and restoring the original charter. And from now on, we will be restoring Hogwarts to its former glory.
Harry Potter, aged four, sat shivering in his cupboard under the stairs. His Uncle had thrown him in there after Dudley had poured his cup of milk all over Harry and somehow blamed him. He was wet and sticky and the milk had started to turn sour and smell.
Harry sat up abruptly, and smiled brightly at his mother, “I met dad,” he said, his excitement and happiness shining through.
“Then let’s inform them of what has happened, shall we,” Lily said, smiling as she took her son’s hand and led him from the room.
“Oh dear sweet Danu, don’t be blaming him, I still have to train with Nyad and he will kick my ass twice….” Neville trailed off when he saw the smirk on Harry’s face. “You wouldn’t?” Neville questioned.
“Would you like me to remove him from your sight, my Prince,” Caspain said, turning to eye Neville for the first time since he entered the room.
Ragnock was starting to sweat, he had no idea what was going on. All he knew was that Slipknot was dead and Bloodrod had taken his place.
“All gone,” Harry said as he held up his finger to Lily. She pulled his hand into hers and kissed his finger, causing him to giggle.
Ragnock panicked even further when Lily Potter then moved behind the now vacant desk, waving her hand to clean up the blood and gore left behind by Bloodrod and pressed the emergency button that would call Rugnuk to the bank. He was a dead goblin walking and he knew it, it was just a matter of who would kill him, Lily Potter or his King.
“Well,” Harry said as he moved to her other side and kissed her cheek, “someone had to break the stalemate between you and Uncle Frank.”
Magic pulsed out of them in waves, and with a final buzzing sound, it exploded around them, pushing everyone off their feet.
“You will be glad for it when the fawning fans follow you around. Just be grateful we are immune to Wizarding potions. Imagine how many girls and boys will try and slip you love potions,” Neville said laughing.
“Take your seat boys,” Professor McGonagall said, trying to hide her smile at the reactions of the two boys.
Harry made his way into the meeting room and was surprised by how many Fae were there. They had had their going away
“Well how can she really say anything, she is dating Sirius, and really I can’t blame her, his transformation suits him. He makes a hot Fae, which is horrifying for me to say considering he is the closest thing I have to a father. And she is still rigid, she just hides it better, mostly,” Harry said, totally ignoring the crush comment.
“Dumbledore,” Charlus spat out, “he blackmailed us, threatened to kill Harry if we didn’t do as he said. He stole our portraits and spelled them asleep after he got what he wanted. How long have we been asleep?”
“All finished there baby, we are home now, at Potter Castle, and I need your help to get inside, can you help me?” Harry nodded his head while wiping the sleep from his eyes, causing Lily to smile fondly at him, it was an action James used to do.
“What!!” Neville exclaimed, annoyed at Harry for taking his attention away from blonde beauty across the room.
Neville burst into his grandmother's sitting room, and into her bedroom, something he would never normally do. “Gran,” he called out as he took a seat by her bedside and grabbed her hand.
“You might want to breathe,” Meri said, cutting her off and chuckling at the look on Caspian's face.
“Right, maybe a Wizarding name then? You know, just to make sure we don’t get smote,” Neville mocked, smirking at his brother.
The house creaked as she moved and she sent out a spell to strengthen the place before looking around. She could feel foreign Wards around the house and stripped them down before adding her own to protect what was hers. She was a little startled at how easy it seems to Ward the place and smiled as she thought of the protections she could add to Potter Manor.
“We were not sure how she would help the King, only that she would be close to him, but it would all become clear when she was in the same room as him. I saw this, but not the outcome,” she said turning to Luna, “is he?”
“Okay we get it,” Harry said, cutting off his mother and laughing as Neville rolled his eyes. “Everyone’s coming.”
It was a laughing Harry and Neville, who collapsed into their chairs in the private room, a few hours later. They were sure all the news sources would be having a field day with what they had seen and heard in Diagon Alley. Some had even followed them to Hogsmeade.
“I do not know, your Highness, there is nothing about this in the books. But the last time this was recorded, the Fae involved were full-blooded already. Born and bred of Elphyne,” Khidell answered, before adding, “a halfling has never become full-blooded before their second awakening at 21. It was forbidden to try and change halflings early as it affected their magic and in some cases caused their deaths.”
And it was selfish, incredibly so, to ask that of Ollivander who had lost that other half of his soul. But the kindly old mans eyes held only warmth when he replied in a whisper thick with emotion,
Malfoy groaned and stood, getting far too close and speaking in a very pointed way, “You couldn’t have protected them. If we’d warded them in any way we might as well throw off our glamours and announce to the world aurors are here! I want to catch this bastard and keep people safe just as badly as you do. I’m just as responsible for what’s happened to Anne. Which is why we cannot rush in and be stupid about this. Look past your bloody hero-complex for a moment and think, Potter!”
“I don’t know. I can’t speak for her. But I do know this. I know you, Draco Malfoy, and I trust you.”
Harry’s heart came to a sudden stop. Draco was rambling vehemently about how he wasn’t entirely sure but the man fit the description so well. Harry didn’t say a word as Draco continued relaying the event’s of his afternoon to him. He’d been attacked. He’d been attacked and didn't think that was important enough to inform him about? Draco was now going on about his theory and the spell he’d hit the man with as he disapperated. Harry’s hand tightened on the other man’s shoulder and he finally found his voice, cutting Malfoy off,
Draco felt a bit taken aback and then had to push away the emotions her statement evoked. Had to remind himself of the necessity his cover remain intact. While he was having this internal meltdown Beth asked gently, “So?”
The two women exchanged a glance and Beth nodded both saying grateful words Harry shook his head at saying, “Not at all.” It wasn’t until they were once again inside the apartment that Draco realized a glaring problem. They only had one bed.
Draco didn’t realise how long he and Beth chatted until customer’s started trickling in and she said, “Final rush! I’ll see you around yeah?”
“Are you afraid?” Draco surprised himself by asking, but found he genuinely did care. She seemed a good person. She’d been friendly to him so far at least.
Then just as suddenly the woman half-ran half-stumbled into the street, melting white snow where a trail of crimson ran from her wounds. Silent words formed on lips painted an eerie red as she fell to her knees at the feet of the first stranger she saw. People gathered, apparated, patronuses sent, emergency medi witches and wizards arrived just before the Aurors and yet all they found was an empty alleyway and two words written hastily on the wall in blood,
Yet he still had so little to go on and today hadn’t been the most encouraging start to their undercover operation. He put his head in his hands.
“It is his name Ronald. And he apologized. Surely you can be mature about this if he can?” Hermione smiled at Ron as if in challenge. Ron just huffed and rolled his eyes,
A pie, apple from the smell with “Welcome!” written in crust. Potter turned back to the groceries he’d been unpacking, “We’ll have to get her something as thanks.”
“Harry,” He said firmly, “You know my name so bloody use it. Stop treating me like an enemy, when you know I’m not.”
Draco did his best to act as if nothing had changed and focus on the case in the days after their mutual agreement to be together. As a couple. Meaning they would actually have to figure out how that would work, exactly, after this case. Draco didn’t know if it was anticipation or apprehension that seized his heart every time the thought caught him off guard. Harry remaining a constant and predictable presence in his days soothed some of those worries. When they were together Draco felt as if maybe, just maybe, if it was the two of them together they could make it work.
Twenty minutes later, Harry had spelled the trail of yesterday's clothes into the laundry, attempted Draco’s french pressed coffee and he’s humming happily while plating their french toast when he hears Draco finally leaves the bedroom. He turns and for a minute Draco just stares across the tiny apartment at him with an impossibly fond look. Harry is glad he already had one hand on the counter or he might have had to brace himself since his knees suddenly had gone weak.
Robards informing him of the new parameters of the mission only added more complications but he was in no position to argue with a direct order. It would be the end of his career and he wasn't going to let anyone railroad him into being fired in disgrace. He wasn't going to let that happen. He'd solve this case no matter what. Even if it meant working with Potter.
And a few minutes, and only one further argument later they’d moved the chess set and placed the tree. Potter was right, though Draco would never admit it, the tree did look much better once returned to its normal size; The scent of evergreen washing over them as the tree magically became lush and tall. Potter immediately started spinning red and gold garlands over it and Draco scoffed, immediately transfiguring the other man’s work to a more fitting green and gold. Potter mouth fell open and he sputtered, “Merlin, the tree is already green! Those colors make no sense.”
“Decided to come back did you? Find anything during your ‘recon’?” Malfoy said sharply, annoyed at his own annoyance. But it was reasonable when one’s partner, auror partner, disappeared for hours! Without saying where. Idiot reckless gryffindor.
The little bird then proceeded to catch fire and fall away as ash. An untraceable message, the kind Harry had received before during his time with the Aurors; but this message had clearly been for Malfoy. Malfoy whose face had gone as ashen as the bird, jaw tight and expression unreadable as his hand and gaze still hovered where the bird had been.
Draco couldn’t help it. He laughed. Then Harry’s hurt and confused expression had him hurrying to explain,
“Salazar but you are thick! What do you want from me? Do you want me to hex you? Do you want me to cry? To complain to you? To curse the world and everyone in it? What do you want from me?”
He’d missed them. Harry let his gaze trail over the room next and came to a sudden realization; where was Draco? The last thing Harry remembered was Draco disappearing around the corner of that alley. Was he okay? Had they caught the guy? Where was Draco? Harry asked his best friends all these things in a rush and Hermione shushed him in what he supposed would normally be a soothing manner before replying,
Harry blinked awake and upon seeing their visitors nearly jumped up but Draco held him in place reminding him of his injury.
They had appointments scheduled today with a few of the more suspicious shop owners. All of them were none too pleased with their presence but willing enough to work with them at the thought of all the galleons a wedding would bring them. It was a shame really such a sour faced old woman ran such a lovely little flower shop, Harry thought after one said meeting when he noticed the basket of pale coral roses as he “browsed”. It would make sense to buy something he reasoned as he found himself picking one out. A single rose was well within their expenses as well so Malfoy could hardly argue he wasted his money. The smiling attendant who didn’t seem to share her employer’s phobia even gave him a discount with a conspiratorial finger to her lips and a congratulations on his engagement.
Harry hands him his cup with a peck on the cheek before returning to the kitchen to put the finishing touches on the meal he'd prepared this morning for their guests arrival. As Draco took a sip of his perfectly made tea he felt again that immense sense of peace fall back over him like a warm blanket across his shoulders on a chilly day. He was happy. And watching Harry rummage through their cabinets, (theirs because this was their home they'd made together and isn't that a thought?) he was overcome with emotion.
The apartment was a one bedroom flat with a mix of white walls and exposed brickwork. The door opened into a small kitchen with a living area beyond it that consisted of a little round table with two chairs, a large dark wood cabinet in against one wall, a single antique looking loveseat next to it, on the opposite wall a chess set and chairs. The further wall held a tiny balcony beyond old glass doors and next to that a fireplace. Not one big enough to floo in but possibly to send messages and at the very least keep the place warm. The bedroom was similarly made up of dark wood furnishings but the bed, dresser and wardrobe were all clearly modern. Harry's chest floated to the end of the bed with a thunk, since that was as good a place as any. Malfoy let his drop in front of the cabinet and placed his hands on his hips. What complaint could he possibly have so soon? Malfoy scanned the room before turning back to Harry, "Well I'm not taking the sofa."
His feet had barely touched solid ground again and his world still felt as if it was spinning as he took off toward the alley Harry’s patronus had stated. If that idiot- no he wasn’t going to think about anything but the pounding of his feet on pavement and making it to the alley. He could already hear spellfire being exchanged. It was still early morning and everything seemed shadowed and greyer than usual as he ran. As soon as he reached the opening of the alleyway he was yanked aside and whipped around to point his wand at his attacker only to find it was Harry who’d pulled him behind some crates and bins. One of the bins explodes before Draco could fully take Harry in. Singed rubbish falling in every direction  Draco cast a late shielding charm and Harry explained in a rush, “Has me pinned down. It was the bloody stationary store clerk of all-”
And with that Draco stomped off to the bedroom; only to fall back on the closed door taking in shuddering breaths. He touched a shaking hand to his lips and cursed.
Harry raised a brow but quickly schooled his expression into a smile, “If you say so darling, but we really should be going soon. You know how my cousin gets when kept waiting.”
Which is why the missive on his desk was almost the last straw. Harry. Fucking. Potter. Of course they would give the golden boy HIS case. Robards expected them to work together? What a joke. If anything he'd probably told Potter to find any evidence of him being a dark wizard or something. Just great. Draco's forehead hit his cluttered desk with a thunk. This case just got a lot more complicated.
He would apologize. He would apologize and beg Draco for things to go back to being professional between them. That a kiss was just a kiss- it didn’t have to mean anything. It had only been for their cover, and Harry regretted not thinking of another solution and he’d never spring something like that on Draco again. He’d respect Draco’s boundaries and even keep his distance if the other man wanted. He’d beg they just put the kiss aside and forget about it because the case took precedence over any emotions they may have toward one another. Even if Draco now hated him again Harry felt he’d at least manage to keep things civil until the case ends.
“How’s it?” Beth asked with a hint of nervousness from where she sat across the table. Draco might have made visiting her café into part of the weekly routine he’d settled into; but who could blame him really? Beth seemed to know a lot about what was going on around town from talking to customers and as an added bonus also happened to be an amazing baker who wanted opinions on her newest recipes before adding them to the menu. Draco had just enjoyed one of the best scones of his life and told her as much. Her relief was clear and her laugh loud and triumphant, “Honestly, that’s so good to hear. Scones have really never been my specialty.”
When he’d tossed his clothes and come to stand by the bed Malfoy finally deigned to acknowledge his presence, face somehow still pink. From the shower. Dryly intoning, “What?”
In a little cottage in the village of Hogsmeade reside two former aurors. Harry Potter with much public scandal announced not only his relationship with acquitted death eater, former rival and current auror partner Draco Malfoy, but also his retirement from the aurors. After five successful years Harry had decided a change of pace would be healthy and jumped at the chance to teach Quidditch at his alma mater Hogwarts School of Witchcraft & Wizardry, replacing the happily retiring Madame Hooch. Another new hire for Hogwarts was soon announced. Draco Malfoy will take over potions from Horace Slughorn; who is happily going back into retirement.
The kiss was heated, as if a decade of longing had turned to heat that smelted and fused their bodies together. Harry’s cloak was the first thing to go, left a crumpled mess on the floor by the apartment door. Next they were stumbling, Harry grunted when they hit the edge of their table but was quick to reattach his demanding lips on Draco’s as they fumbled their way to the bedroom. Apparently, Harry didn’t want to waste time with all the buttons his vest and shirt entailed because one moment he was wearing them the next he’d pulled himself from Draco’s lips long enough to mutter a wandless vanishing charm. Draco had only a moment to appreciate the sight of Harry’s warm toned chest before their lips met again, and Draco felt himself being pushed against the bedroom door. One of his hands had moved to feel the broad chest, sandwiched between them, the only other barrier between their skin other than Draco’s own sweater. His other hand had found its way into Harry’s hair, tugging it free of the bun as Harry fumbled to get the bedroom door open.
Thinking about what Beth had said about decorating for the holiday’s Draco turned toward their rather bland apartment with a frown. It may be an assignment but they should at least put up the pretense of a couple living here, right? What if Beth and Anne wanted to come by again and saw they’d done nothing for the holidays? It would make something seem off about them. They couldn’t have that.
Harry found his voice, though it came out fainter than he’d meant it to be, replying automatically, “I will.”
As they showered and changed, he and Malfoy cleaned up the dinner in silence. Harry was glad everyone had seemed to like it and eager to try the unique spice blend Beth suggested next time he made treacle tart. The women were quick and soon Harry found himself saying goodnight and shutting the bedroom door.
“Last night,” He begins but has to swallow down a sudden lump in his throat as Draco stiffens, “I don’t want this to have been a one time thing. It meant something to me. I guess what I’m trying to ask is if you feel the same?”
And as he looked into those weary green eyes and took in the smudged and bloodied appearance of his partner he knew he was right. Tactically. Everything in Draco screamed at him not to leave Harry but it was a plan that made sense and the only plan they really had at the moment. He didn’t know how long he’d last on his own against their attacker. So he nodded. He nodded once in grim determination and Harry nodded back as if they didn’t even need words to communicate the understanding that passed between them. Draco waited until the end of the next flurry of attacks before he made his move.
Draco waved and returned the sentiment, watching the couple head into the back to “try scones”. Something in his chest twinged at their casual closeness as he left the café. At their offer for himself and Harry, not that it was their fault it was fake. A cover for the case and nothing more. Though Draco could at least admit to himself that after the case was solved he’d miss the little café and it’s friendly owners. He doubted they’d be as friendly with an ex-death eater. But if losing their budding friendship meant the case was solved he could at least take solace in that no harm would come to anyone else from this psycho.
Potter did not in fact put him down, carrying Draco in such an unseemly manner out of the office, though the apartment's little living area and into the bedroom. Where Draco found himself rather unceremoniously dumped on the bed, face red and protesting still,
Harry stepped up to her first, offering his arm which she took with a surprisingly firm grasp and preformed the charm. Malfoy held her hand with a blank expression on his foreign face. The witch nodded at them before picking up a shard of old wood that had been laying amongst other debris in the warehouse,
They stay like that for who knows how long as neither dared to break the moment’s silence. As if there was a spell holding them together and a single word could shatter it. Yet, Harry does let go eventually, just enough to look Draco in the eyes. For Draco to see the desperation and concern in his eyes. He needed Draco to understand even if he wasn’t willing to admit why it matters so much to him that he does.
“Ink!” he muttered, puzzling it out. Victim 4 seemed to have never even gotten the chance to fight back as the first three had. No evidence of physical blows - only cursework. And victim 4 was the only one without ink smudged on their person. Sure, they were wizards and used ink but-
As they explained who they were and who they needed to see “Garrett, Leo” continued to frown and double checked their auror badges, even insisting on getting a closer look at Harry’s most notable scar. When he was satisfied they were who they said he called over a short witch around his age whose name tag on deep purple scrubs read, “Brown, Cherrie”. Her scrubs were duck free and felt infinitely more appropriate for the grim task ahead of them as they followed her to the victim's room.
Finally, finally, he came close to the alleyway again and crouched to make his way painstakingly slowly and quietly to the entrance. They were in between bouts of spellfire again. Draco held his wand steady in front of him. He couldn’t fail. He wouldn’t.
Harry let out a disbelieving huff, “Exposure? You could have been killed! He could recognize your glamour now! What the hell were you thinking? How could you be so damn reckless?!”
Draco didn’t have to elaborate for her to know who he meant. There was only one person he could mean. Beth let out a heavy sigh swiping a hand over her golden hair, adding another streak of flour to a few endearing others, before she found her voice,
Damn Potter. Surprising him like that. Of course he’d blush from embarrassment! No one had ever- No, he was calm. Nonetheless, he couldn’t help admiring the arrangement as he placed it on the table. He could feel his blush deepening as he sat and was hit with Beth and Anne’s cheeky knowing looks. Potter, the git, acted like nothing was amiss as he served them. Draco finally found out what had smelled so delicious as he placed individual bowls of a soup he announced as “Massor Dal” and placed a long serving plate of Tarte flambée on the table. After assuring everyone had a drink Potter joined them and they sunk into conversation. Potter and Beth easily fell into a discussion of the ingredients he’d used and why he’d selected each dish. Draco felt his cheeks heating once again when Potter answered that he'd been attempting to find a complimentary blend of Indian and French dishes “to represent both Damien and my cultures” and placed a gentle hand atop his. Draco resolutely ignored the pounding of his heart. If this was what a dinner with him as a fiance was like, well- Draco cut off such unhelpful thoughts and went back to enjoying the meal. It was honestly well-prepared and the blend of flavors somehow worked. Clearly his cover story should have been a chef. Though, he wouldn’t be able to talk to people as much from a kitchen. Draco frowned as the image of Potter commanding a kitchen refused to leave his mind.
“Yes, opened two years ago. I’ve always been a baker and well this was the area closest to St.Mungos where I could set up shop, and we’ve a nice little apartment above it. My financee is a healer so we needed somewhere convenient for us both. Though I must admit I definitely got the easier commute to work.”
“No, you’re just convinced that every issue could be prevented by you. That you, Saint Potter, can always save the day.” Malfoy retorted dryly, “Newsflash, Potter, that's not how reality works. Sometimes there’s just nothing you can do!”
Reele was the oldest Auror working and Harry had heard she was retiring soon. He just didn't figure her the type to abandon a case before it was solved. But Head Auror Robards soon explained away that mystery; Reele was in coma. She'd been hit by an unknown curse the evening before while working the case. Malfoy had been the one to find her when she didn't report in that morning.
They had finally made it back to their place and put on the kettle when a knock sounded at their door. Malfoy stiffened immediately and Harry had his wand in hand ready to approach the door before he’d made a conscious decision to do so. Malfoy, however, stepped in his way and waved him aside pointing to the small kitchen. Harry took a defensive position just out of sight as Malfoy peeked through the keyhole. And snorted.
They observed the bakery during a relatively silent meal; it seemed rather popular and the portly man behind the counter rather enthusiastic. The bakery's owner it turned out was that same wizard. He introduced himself as Owen Surrey and he seemed genuinely delighted to hear of their upcoming nuptials. After twenty minutes of discussing possible flavors, color schemes, how many people they were thinking would attend, Harry made his escape under the guise of using the restroom. He hoped Draco would take the hint of distracting the man while he had a quick look around. After five minutes of discreet spellcasting Harry found nothing amiss and if he didn’t get back to them soon not only would he seem suspicious but Draco would probably chew him out for it.
“Yup,” The witch popped the p and continued, “dunno how, but glad she did all the same. Heard from an informant she was at St.Mungos and stabilized. Consulted Robards and then came straight for you two. Can’t have you interview her in your civie glamour.”
In a sharp laugh Harry let out a breath he hadn’t realized he’d been holding, “Well, sorry for wanting to hear it said.”
Harry didn’t wait for Malfoys response before rushing off down the street. He didn’t see Malfoy’s quizzical expression as he watched him go.
What transpired next felt like an eternity but was likely no more than a few moments as the man scanned the alley before letting out a quiet curse, spitting, and turning on his heel to disparate. Draco didn’t hesitate to cast a modified tracking spell but knew the instant it impacted that it wouldn’t be of much use as it rippled off the disappearing form. He could only hope he’d tweaked the spell correctly.
“I’m not so good a baker as a cook but-” Bashfully he presented the still warm covered dish to the pastry chef, “I thought this would be a safe bet to get past the healers.”
“Oh, should I just wallow in grief like you? Don’t act like you don’t blame yourself just as much for everything that’s gone wrong!” Harry fumed, “Or did you forget that I live with you, work with you, see every day just how responsible you feel. I blame myself just as much when things go wrong and it’s got nothing to do with some hero-complex; I just want to keep people safe!”
“I should have done something!” Harry blurted out, half absorbed in his own thoughts and pacing. Anne was just with them after all. He should have found some discrete protective charm or something. She worked at St.Mungo’s for Merlin’s sake- He should have considered how dangerous her job and commute would be for her.
“No,” Harry ground out, staring deeply into Malfoys turbulent grey eyes, “not until you stop ignoring me. We can’t work together and solve this if you refuse to work together at all!”
They were partner’s afterall. At least until this case ended. Of course Harry would be feeling the need to protect his partner. Malfoy had turned out to be relatively easy to live in work with at least; they hadn’t given into childish arguments more than twice. And looking after each other well that’s what auror partner’s did. Watched each other's backs. That Malfoy had a rather nice backside was a bonus. Aesthetically of course. It wasn’t like he actually was attracted to Malfoy of all people! Harry let go of Malfoy’s hand once they were a safe distance from the business.
“I already don’t know,” Draco replied, a smile fighting to break through his frown. Harry chuckled and leaned forward to capture Draco’s lips in a soft kiss. Draco sighed against his mouth and deepened the kiss. They only broke apart because of the sudden, and extremely loud, “WHAT?!!” that Ron let out.
Harry gave his godmother a knowing look and smirked at her, before nodding, “yes we are ready, who's my guard?”
“Well, we spend most of our time on Voldemort, since Snape is still recovering for his last visit from Khidell,” Sirius said sulking, earning a smirk from the guard and a laugh from Lily.
“Novus, Iris, please go to the Seelies and collect Mivian and Aodh,” Lily said. “Have them escorted to the family wing, and tell them we will meet them there shortly with a surprise.” Lily waited for them to disappear before turning to Minerva.
“Of course your Highness, I would never harm young Neville,” Nyad answered confused and a little worried. Caspian was not to be trifled with. There was a reason he guarded the future King. Only Khidell was stronger, and most believed it was only because he was older.
Lily wasn’t going to lay down and let them take her baby away from her. Even if she has to come back from beyond the Veil, she will, to protect him. Merlin help anyone that gets in her way.
“Lily?” he gasped as his knees began to buckle. Lily conjured a chair before he could fall and smiled as he sunk into it. “How?”
Petunia sank back into her seat, a blush staining her cheeks, “what are you going to do?” she asked defeated.
“Harry has no preference when it comes to a partner, he would be happy with either male or female. Neville, on the other hand…” Khidell trailed off when he saw the recognition in the woman’s eyes.
All the money and heirlooms that had been taken from their estate were returned and the Minister for Magic, Millicent Bagnold was in trouble she would not see coming until the ICW swept in tomorrow and started their investigation. She had allowed Death Eaters to go free and innocents to be thrown in Azkaban. She had also stuck her hands in the Potter’s wealth with a few of her lackeys.
Lily had to take many calming breaths, she could feel her magic pulsing under her skin, singing for revenge, and it was something she would take. She would make them suffer, but first, she had to take claim of what was hers.
Harry smiled as he pushed the gates of Hogwarts open and let the guards walk in first. He tried to take in as much as he could as he walked up to the Castle.
“It seems Nyx and Caspian will be Harry’s visible guard,” Lily said, still smirking. “The rest of you, if any harm comes to my son or nephew, there is no place you can hide, that I will not find you, understood?”
“I’m trying,” Neville said impatiently. “Do you realise how hard it is not to touch her, knowing what she is to me?”
“That could be any Slytherin,” Harry said thoughtfully. He had done his research on who were related to Death Eaters and who were ones.
“I am not meant for you Harry Potter,” she said smiling at him, her grey eyes alight, “you will find your mate in your own house.”
“Vernon, of course we can't, what if we put our Duddy in there by mistake,” she said scandalised, her hand coming to her mouth to cover it at the thought.
“Now you are a dead man walking,” Khidell said, amused by the laughter of his Queen as he led the man from the room.
“Daisy not be knowing, Daisy only know that when we be told by Dumbleydore to work at Hogwarts, the Portraits be awake. Lord Potter order us to do what Dumbleydore says.”
“Thank you, Minerva,” Lily said, “Meri will lead you out, this is Fae business,” Lily added, dismissing the older woman.
“Maybe I should change your assignment,” Lily said, “if you are going to continue to torment my son so.”
Harry and Neville walked into the room, hands still clutched together for comfort as they looked around at the people there.
“You do realise you are glaring at the King, dad,” Neville said trying to contain his mirth at the look on his dad’s face when he realised what he was doing.
“Anything for my godson, though I can not protect him completely or he will be looked down upon by our people, I will do what I can when I can, and I am sure Harry will do the rest. No matter what, Neville is his brother in all but blood and he can forgive him almost anything.”
“Also it seems the bond, or something Danu herself has done, has caused the boys to undergo their second awakening now, instead of at 21.”
“I agree,” Lily said, smiling at the relieved look on Khidell’s face, “and you should stay with him. I will take Meri and Nyx with me.”
Neville took the hand and shook it, “Neville Longbottom, nice to meet you, and just a tip, don’t reach out to touch Harry, only offer your hand if he offers first,” Neville said, his voice loud enough to be heard through the room.
“Magus,” Harry called, and the two magicals in the compartment and the others outside listening in, gasped as he appeared out of nowhere.
“No,” Caspian said from over Harry’s shoulder before he moved back to stand by the wall. Harry smirked at his guard over his shoulder before turning to Neville himself.
But Khidell was right, it was time for Harry to stand on his own feet, and she had to stop babying him. He was destined to be King and she could not let her fear stand in his way. By the look of relief on her son’s face, she could tell she had done the right thing, even if her heart gave a thud at the thought of it.
The magical pressure in the room was the only thing that kept the Dursley’s at bay, but Vernon promised, now that he knew where the real Harry was, the freak was going to pay. He was suddenly very excited for the morning.
“Right,” Neville said as he made his way to the stool and sat down. He must have been really out of it to not notice the first years had finished being sorted.
“Okay, I am going to do the retrieval spell so I will need three of you to help out with that so we don’t get buried under belongings. It will retrieve anything taken from any Potter, whether it be from a property or person or vault.
Lily scowled, “don’t worry, Daisy, I will go to Gringotts today. Let the other elves know to be ready for my call.”
“I will be as quick as I can like I said, I promise, and maybe I will have Snuffles with me when I get back.”
“What kind of side effect?” Narcissa asked, trying to move to her son’s bedside but being blocked by the guards.
Caspian’s eyes were pulled away from the perfect curve of Harry’s arse by Neville’s laughter. “Shut it,” Caspian said, causing Neville to laugh harder as he left the room for his own bedroom.
“And you thought, oh a little innocent baby, let’s keep him in a cupboard and not feed him,” Lily sneered.
“No, I have no idea at all,” Harry said, sarcasm dripping from his voice, causing Neville to look at him and snort.
“Your son is my son’s fated,” Lily said, smiling at Narcissa. “Their bonding was a little unusual, and had an unexpected side effect,” Lily added gently. She could see the worry in Narcissa's face.
Harry laughed at not only Godric's turn of phrase but at the look on his face. “You have been spending way too much time with Sirius,” he said, smirking the man.
“We will get to that later, what I want to know is where were you when Harry needed you? You left him with Hagrid and he was subjected to over three years at the Dursleys.”
Harry sat next to his mother, the hood of his robe drawn up to hide his face. Neville sat on his other side, his hood also raised. He could feel Neville’s eagerness, while all Harry could feel was anxious.
“I blame Nyad,” Harry said frowning, “he does exactly the same thing, speaking before thinking, and he has been training you since you were six.”
“They are, very special family heirlooms,” Rugnuk said, “place the ring on Prince Harry first, then the necklace on yourself.”
“Yes,” two voices answered sounding exactly the same. “I’m the real Dudley,” they both said, “no I’m the real Dudley.”
But first, he was going to spend as much time with his mates as possible. Reuniting two words was going to be exhausting, so he deserved some downtime. His mind was already picturing a naked Draco and Caspian.
“How?” Dumbledore demanded as he moved forward drawing his wand. Lily waved her hand, capturing the wand she summoned from him and frowned as the magic of the wand tried to connect with her.
Harry blinked rapidly, trying to look around as his eyes adjusted to the afternoon light, “Gringotts?” he asked.
“I plan on taking Neville and his parents with me,” Lily repeated, this time tucking her hair behind one of her ears.
“Dumbleydore be having Potter elves at Hogwarts, Daisy be finding out from Head Hogwarts elf that he be trying to find a way to break the binds to little Lord Harry and set us free. Daisy not wanting to be free. Daisy not wanting to die, Lady Lily.”
The only glimmer of hope was that Harry, as King could take two mates, a chosen and a destined. But Harry’s destined mate must approve of the chosen. Of course, Fae could choose a mate, if they didn’t find a fated or their fated passed, but for Harry and Caspian the option of both had always been there.
“Khidell, send a few of the guards home, and find out just what has been done,” Lily demanded, “and why this had never been mentioned. This is something that should have been noticed before now.”
“Rugnuk will stand guard with you, Sirius come with me,” Lily said, and before he could answer smoked out with him.
“Sure, it will be nice to get to know some of the kids before school starts,” Harry said with a shrug.
Lily’s hand went to her mouth as she tried to control her emotions, but the tears slipped down her face as she could do nothing to stop them. Harry pulled her closer to comfort her and she smiled at him gratefully.
“Has to be Dumbledore’s doing, though he seems to have left out the whole Fae thing. Of course, the old man does love his secrets,” Sirius said frowning. “Do you think he realises we are all Fae now, or just you, Lily?”
She frowned before releasing the door with her blood. “It seems like no one has been here since our time, Godric,” Helga said in disgust, as she passed the map to Harry, who deactivated it.
“That’s right, the cut was healed after the blood was taken, sweetheart, now it’s mummy’s turn,” Lily placed her hand on the Crest and waited as it sampled her blood. Harry had to go first since he carried both Potter blood and her blood. The wards would not accept her without Harry going first since it was in lockdown. She felt the push and pulled her hand back and held it out to Harry, “no ouchies,” she said as he took her hand into his own little ones and stared at it.
He opened the door to his room and froze, his hand still on the handle. Draco expected to come back and do his homework in an empty room. He did not expect to see Harry curled in a ball in the center of his bed.
Potter didn't ask with any of the emotions Draco thought he would. He was open, concerned, worried and ... pleading. Potter wanted Draco to say yes. Harry Potter wanted to save HIM of all people. Which is what Draco had a hard time wrapping his head around, even after all this time. Draco had made his life hell, bullied him and the people he was close to, held Luna Lovegood in his basement, but he still wanted to save Draco.
Potter didn't say a word either as he followed Draco's lead. Draco turned on all the lights and lit all the candles before closing the door. He didn't apologize for the mess of his room, he wasn't ashamed or embarrassed by it, not right now anyway.
"That's good." Harry appreciated that he was using Hermione's first name now that they were on good terms. He felt his face fall when he remembered how Draco was acting when he came back. "What did you mean when you said this only happens in your dreams?"
By the time Draco turned around again, everything was set out for them. Draco's face was blank as he took everything in, like he wasn't fully seeing anything, but after a few seconds, a small smile grew. A shy, little bit scared, hopeful smile. A smile that Harry missed seeing, even if he had only caught glimpses of it before.
"Have for a while. Not that I could act on it or show it or think about it." Draco's voice was shaking and he wouldn't look at Harry, afraid to see disgust or rejection.
After some time Pansy closed her book and stood. "I'm going to bed now. I highly suggest you do the same, you look worse than yesterday." She said the same thing every night.
Draco looked up and hoped that he didn't think on that too hard. He knew Harry wasn't stupid, he was actually brilliant when he took the time to properly think a problem through, but this was the one thing that Draco wanted to stay unknown to him.
"What happened to being tired of saving everyone?" Draco couldn't make his voice any louder and he was too tired to try.
Harry just held him closer, pulled him tighter to his chest. "I'm here. I'm here Draco. I'll be here for you."
The candles didn't provide much light, so with the room so dark, the charm Draco had cast glowed. It gave off more than enough light for Draco to make it back to his bed without tripping on anything. It also pulled Harry's attention, gave him something good to focus on.
"What's up?" Harry was smiling. He was glad that Hermione was working on understanding that Harry had changed. It felt amazing not to have to pretend around them anymore.
leave it alone but he kind of didn't want him to leave it alone. They weren't even half way through the second month of the term and it was already this bad. If he said no now, it wouldn't be long before someone's curse sent him to the hospital wing. If anyone else had asked if he wanted help, he would have said no. But it was just Harry. Draco nodded and something in his chest twisted at the small smile Harry gave him when they started moving again.
He didn't care if it was even or not, Draco just needed it shorter and Pansy hadn't had enough time to do it for him. Draco nodded moved to his desk chair so it would be easier for Harry. His eyes started stinging when he thought about how hard it was for him to let Pansy cut it the first time, right after his trial when Pansy was the only one he could stand to be around.
When Harry landed, it took a minute for Draco to dismount and step back. Not that Harry minded. Harry set his broom off to the side and took the basket from Draco who was admiring the view of the lake. He silently set to work getting their picnic set up, not wanting to disrupt the peace just yet.
The two of them spent all morning and most of the afternoon in Draco's bed. Sometimes they would talk, about different things, some important some not, but they were mostly silent.
He walked into the classroom just before Flitwick turned around to begin the class. He sat in the back of the class and took notes on autopilot.
"Once we graduate, I'm going to disappear. I'm thinking of a little cottage in the middle of the country side, a garden with lots of flowers, maybe an animal or two, only Ron, Hermione, Luna and George have visitation rights. And only two per month so they'll need to make their own schedule. You are the only one who has a free pass, welcome to visit whenever you'd like."
Draco had wanted so badly to say no. To spit in his face and say he didn't need help, much less help from him. But he was terrified of what would happen, what his sentence would be if he didn't have at least one person on his side. Terrified of having to see any face that might be familiar from the nightmare that had become his house. Petrified at the thought of being in the same building as his father.
"I think you're the only one who doesn't expect me to be him anymore. Even Ron and 'Mione still wait for me to act like I did before. I don't think they take me seriously when I tell them that that part of me died when I killed him. But you don't expect that of me, you don't need me to save you. You just let me
Draco got as comfortable as the lumpy sofa would allow and focused on the fire blazing in front of him.
Draco hummed lying back on the cool grass. The cold was seeping through his jumper, settling in his shoulders. The sky was getting darker and stars started to appear. Harry leaned back so he was resting on his elbows, watching Draco's face.
As an answer, Draco grabbed Harry's hand again and pulled him back to his bed. This time they got under the covers and Draco didn't realize how cold he was before he wasn't anymore.
"Meet me at McGonagall's office when your classes let out." Harry separated when they reached the hall, going to sit with his friends. But as Draco watched, it was out of habit. He didn't put that fake happy mask on when he sat with them and he didn't contribute to the conversation. He largely ignored when people spoke to him. None of the eighth years had class right after breakfast so most everyone stayed at their tables when everyone else left. Draco stood and decided to go to the library, where he could hide from everyone.
Draco walked down from the tower to the Great Hall, hoping he had waited long enough to avoid as many people as he could. He only had enough time before his first class to grab toast to eat on the way but he didn't need more than that.
Thursday passed more or less uneventfully. More hexes and jinxes hit him than the day before and the slurs and insults got more creative. He didn't pay that much attention to them until his last class when someone's note expressed their distrust and hatred at him for somehow tricking and corrupting Harry Potter.
Draco hugged him back and thought that he'd be more than okay to spend the rest of the weekend like this. "Rather than go to Hogsmeade tonight, can we have a picnic by the lake or something? I don't think I can deal with people yet."
Harry pushed them off the ground and into the sky. The wind was cooler than it was an hour ago. Draco pressed closer to Harry and tucked his face into the back of Harry's neck, just between his shoulder blades. Harry could feel Draco's even breaths and was glad that flying was something that felt calming for both of them.
Once he was finished eating, he waited for Pansy to be finished flirting with Luna before the three of them walked back up to their common room. Luna walked in between the two of them and was chattering away about her most recent fixation. She swung the hand she held Pansy's in and kept a light grip on Draco's elbow, like he was a gentleman escorting her to their destination.
"What's that?" Harry mumbled, voice slurring just a little bit. They should probably head back soon, before he fell asleep in the cold.
Thinking back on it, Harry knew that he had been crushing on Draco for a few years but couldn't name the emotions he was feeling. But at the beginning of this term, when he saw those two seventh years beating Draco, something clicked. He knew he would do whatever he could to help him.
Harry wanted to see Draco smiling again. He knew he would do everything he could think of to make it happen. He saw a glimpse of it before Draco turned out the lights of his room and the ceiling lit up with the charm, but it still looked pained.
Harry's feet touched the ground and he got off his broom. He loved this spot and as far as he knew, he was the only one who knew about it. He couldn't wait to give Draco an open space that was safe from the outside world.
They paired up in Slughorns class, no one sitting at their table in the corner of the room. Slughorn was ecstatic at their display of house camaraderie, everyone looking the other way with a roll of their eyes. Whenever they were asked a question it was Potter who answered, even if he knew he was giving the wrong answer. They didn't speak to each other to coordinate the project, both knowing, from past years watching the other, who did best doing what. While Draco needed no help making the potion himself, he detested having to put it into the report. And Potter, who didn't know holly hawk from wolfs bane, much preferred watching what to do and saying what he saw.
Harry walked in dressing in his own sleep clothes, a similar fashion to Draco's. "Is it okay if I sleep here tonight?"
“Neville is my godson, and not only was he born of the secondary Hufflepuff line through his mother, he is also Fae and family. I promised Alice if anything happened I would protect Neville with my life. And so I will.”
“Mum thinks it’s fun to watch him being all annoyed at all the changes that have been made, while he can’t figure out how it is happening. All he knows is that the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff trusts are in control and that he is nothing more than a Headmaster, as he should be. She wants to see the look on his face when he finds out.”
Harry had never been so sore, not even after spending a night in the cupboard after no food. He ached everywhere but still felt warm and safe. He moved slightly and realised he was not alone. His head was rested against a chest, arms wrapped around him, her scent filling his nose, reminding him of a time when he was a baby wrapped in her arms.
“Of course, he is Heir to the Potter line,” Lily said with a smile, before turning to Harry, “another ring for you to wear,” she said, causing him to pout and fidget with the one he was already wearing.
“I’m leaving, sweetheart,” she said, kissing his forehead. “Jinxy?” she called as she walked out of the room.
Lily sighed and lay her head onto the back of the lounge, closing her eyes tightly. “Oh James,” she whispered as a lone tear escaped her. She had been holding it together for so long, just trying to get things in place, but now, in Potter Manor, surrounded by memories, she allowed herself a moment to grieve for her love.
“I need you to bring me the Ward book when we get to the family room, I have to make sure no one but those approved has access to the Manor and then I will need to do the retrieval spell, so I will need a few elves available to put the items where they need to be when they pop in. If you find anything missing I need it to be retrieved.”
“I don’t know, but we can’t keep them in the cupboard,” Vernon said automatically not even thinking.
She picked up Harry, and placed him at the bottom of the stairs before running up them and removing the memories from Dudley and Vernon too, after checking to make sure Dudley would not inherit their legacy. She was relieved to find him nothing but an ordinary human. She then erased any signs of her son, before picking him up and leaving Privet Drive forever.
Harry hated being his pig cousin, and Lily knew it, that was why she was working so hard to get stronger. But for her to get stronger, Harry had to get stronger, her magic was tied to his. So he needed to pretend until they were both strong enough to fight back.
“Draco, darling, the messes you get yourself into,” she said, her voice soft and caring as she carded her fingers through his hair.
“So you’re Fae?” Sirius asked after Lily finished retelling her story. He looked from her to Harry, who was sitting next to his mother staring right back at Sirius, Snuffles squeezed tightly in his arms.
“Really, it seems to me that I am standing right in front of you old man,” Lily said and then held up her ring. “I would not be able to wear this if I were not Lily Potter.
“Yes, Grandmother Celeste helped me when she discovered my talent. It started after my first awakening.” Luna turned slightly as movement caught her eye, “not yet Neville,” she said smiling at him as he reached for her, “you do not wish to cause damage to this beautiful castle.”
“Vigilance, Caspian. Watch my son closely, and keep them away, until we can organise a gathering. Harry’s fated, if he indeed has one, will be almost as powerful as he is. If his mate is here and they touch, Hogwarts very well might collapse under the pressure.”
“Harry, sweetheart,” Lily said, running her hand through his hair, “can you wake up for mummy please?”
Harry and Neville were led to a compartment by Cas and Nym. Meri and Magus having already picked it out. As soon as he entered he felt the wards and frowned.
“It seems Mr Longbottom wishes to be placed with you. To keep an eye on you, so I must sort you both at the same time.”
She quickly moved the bed aside and searched her hidden stash, relieved beyond belief when her wards were still in place. She disabled them and moved the floorboard, reaching in and pulling out the books her mother left her and the necklace and ring that was with them.
” Harry said, not realising he was glowing slightly as he pushed with his magic. “Ha!,” Harry exclaimed as Ash gave a pitiful but triumphant squawk and burst into flames. “Dumbledore called him Fawkes, he likes the name but hates the man,” Harry added, as Godric nursed the bird and shivered as he felt the bond latch itself back on to him.
Draco looked at Luna with amusement before continuing. “She also explained that not all halflings will become full-blooded Fae, some will just remain magicals.”
“I am,” Xeno cleared his throat, “it seems I am unsure how to address you,” he finished, swallowing nervously. “In the wizarding world, it would be Lord Potter.”
“I will be spending most of my time in your suite and only leaving when you command it, my King,” she answered with a small bow.
“You forget, sister, I know the heart of you, you will never be satisfied with the small life Vernon can give you. You’re just lucky you have a son of your own, or I would make sure you never knew a minute of happiness for the rest of your days. As it is, I will leave you to this little life you think you want, but know this, don’t come crying to me when it isn’t all you hoped it would be.” Like that would even be an option after Lily had finished what she planned to do.
“Seriously,” Harry said, laughing slightly at his brother. “Neville Longbottom,” Harry yelled loudly, causing the hall to go quiet.
Lily stood and moved over to Rugnuk and sat down, looking at the words forming on the parchment, “that’s Fae writing,” she whispered as she watched more and more writing appear.
“Wait,” Charlus said, and smirked at his daughter-in-law, “they say the Fae are descended from the Gods.”
Siofra was one of many Fae that had chosen a mate, which was common among their kind if they had not found a Fated by the 3rd Awakening. She was coming upon her final Awakening in 10 years, and there had never been a record of Fae finding their Fated after their final Awakening.
“Draco’s parents will be at the gathering,” Lily said as they entered Elphyne, and she led them towards their home.
“All is possible with magic, especially our kind,” Lily said with a vicious smile at the old man. “You will pay for what you did to my family, and my son.”
“We can not leave yet,” Lily said as she stood holding a sleeping Harry. He was still surrounded by a glow. Lily figured it would take longer for him since he was not only young but still part Wizard.
“Narcissa?” Lily asked as she stood next to the other mother, and placed a privacy bubble around them. “What of your husband?” she asked knowing Narcissa would understand.
“Poppy, take us to the receiving room, and I think a cup of tea would be nice. And something for young Neville here.”
“The Minister and Dumbledore have plans to overtake the school. It seems Dumbledore has neglected to inform them that Fae are all over Hogwarts. He has dismissed the rumours circulating that you are indeed Fae as propaganda to overtake the Ministry,” Nyad finished with a bloodthirsty smile.
The ones that were not successful, moved over to the other side of the gathering circle and began to interact with each other and the Fae that had yet to find a mate. Some would be lucky, others would either continue to wait or move on and find a chosen instead.
“I am so sorry Harry, more than you know. I could say it was the agitation of all the waiting but really, my mouth worked before my brain caught up.”
“He was labouring under many curses, including loyalty, control and anger curses. He was not in his right mind, even when we pulled him from Azkaban. It took three days for us to shed him of the curses and the controls he was bound under. His stay in Azkaban made it harder, due to the damage done to his mind.”
Before he could add anything else, and before anyone even though to move Luna Lovegood reached over and grabbed Harry’s hand with a smile.
“Excuse me, but I have Luna Lovegood with me,” Professor McGonagall said as she entered the room led by Meri.
“No, Tuney, the way you treated my son, the things you allowed him to suffer. You are lucky that fat bastard you call a husband wasn’t able to lay a hand on him or you would all be dead.” Lily took a deep breath and shook her head, this wasn’t going to get her anywhere. “Tell me how Harry got here?”
“Why don’t you come in and sit down, instead of standing in the doorway,” Harry said, waving his hand towards a seat next to Neville.
“Oh, I think I would, and I think it would be fitting if Caspian was the one that reprimanded him for his poor teaching skills.”
No words were spoken as each person passed by Harry, touching his hand on the way through. Only the females touched Neville, though.
“Neville, release her hand this instant,” Meri said moving to Neville’s side and guiding the boy back to his seat. Neville frowned at him before understanding entered his eyes and he gasped.
“Harry?” Lily asked. Harry turned to look at her, and she smiled at the look he gave her. She was so glad that he looked so much like James. “Could you stay with Maisy and talk to Grandma and Grandpa while mummy runs an errand?”
“I found the sorry excuse of a man pointing his wand at a crying and terrified Neville. He is unconscious upstairs,” Lily answered matter of factly. She was watching Augusta’s reactions very carefully.
“Not for Gran,” Harry said, “she is the most badass witch ever, now that mum’s a Fae. If anyone could defy the odds it would be her.”
“Did you know Morgan Le Fay was Fae?” Draco asked, still shocked over that information. “It’s why there are so many halflings in the magical world right now.”
“Petunia,” Lily said as she entered the room, a smirk on her face, “you may want to call an ambulance, I may have killed your husband.” She knew he wasn’t dead, but enjoyed the look of horror on her bitch of a sister's face.
“Okay then, I guess we should prepare for you to step up as King,” Lily said, sounding worried and relieved at the same time. “I guess ‘the two will become one,’ meant more than just reuniting the Fae,” Lily muttered.
“I didn’t think of it like that, I guess it would,” Neville said, getting up and placing his hand on Harry’s shoulder in support. “Maybe when we get back you can take me to see Potter Manor and the Godric Hollow place,” Neville added, smiling at his brother from another mother.
“Hold him back,” Lily said, pointing to Lucius, “but let Narcissa through.” She looked at the blond man as he sneered and went to open his mouth. “If he gives you any trouble, throw him in the dungeons with his Master and Severus.”
“I can try,” Siofra said, turning into his embrace with a soft smile and wrapping her arms around his neck.
“That is good news, Sirius, but what else have you been doing, I know that look after all,” Lily said smirking at him.
“I miss him to mum,” Harry said and pressed a kiss to her cheek. “It’s the main reason I wanted to come here,” he added causing his mum to smile brightly at him.
“You think I should name my owl after the Goddess?” Harry asked incredulously. “I think she may come down and smite me for the insult,” he added, smiling as Neville laughed.
“Maybe, who knows,” Lily said with a shrug, “but that does bring me to something I have been thinking about. Rugnuk, can you do an inheritance test on Harry? I know they don’t work on full Fae, like me, but Harry still has his wizarding blood.”
“So, I’m the Heir to Hufflepuff, I think that’s worse,” Neville said, looking wistfully at the Ravenclaw table.
Neville laughed as he turned to look at Luna, his breath catching in his throat at her beauty. Treva who? he thought as he stared into those glowing grey eyes.
“Yes, my mother had it, and Celeste has it. Now it seems young Luna has it,” Aodh said frowning slightly. “Are you being trained, young one?”
Harry and Neville watched as Hermione seemed to fall in on herself, in a defeated sort of way, before straightening her spine and huffing.
“We do not know,” Mivian said. “She told us she needed to enter the magical world, there was something she needed to do. She never told us what exactly, and we never saw her again.”
Neville clung to the woman, sobbing his little heart out, breaking Lily’s in the process. He was just as bad off as Harry had been.
“She is our daughter,” Mivian said, “she was lost to us many years ago, and we have been searching for her ever since.”
The train was pretty quiet, and Harry was starting to wonder if anyone would visit their compartment.
But after meeting Draco and spending time with him, neither could see Draco sharing his mate. So Harry had lost hope that he could ever be with Cas, and Neville throwing it in his face like that...but at least Harry would have Draco. Caspian had never found his Fated and was resigned to the fact he would be one of the many that didn’t have one.
