"What was that for Malfoy?" Potter spoke in no more than a whisper next to him, it was more relaxed than he'd heard his voice before. It usually had a sort of spiteful tone to it when he talked to him now it was more normal like when he'd heard the other boy talk to the weasel. "Nothing just.. umm.. just shocked, you've been avoiding me a lot recently," he replied trying not to sound as arrogant as he normally did as he's fully aware that would just annoy Potter back into avoiding him. "Yeah well I had to come back to classes eventually," Potter spoke. "Why'd you do it anyway?" he quizzed the other boy. Harry looked over at him, a look of annoyance and panic swept over his face. "I'm not getting into this now," he stated quickly and then turning to face Professor Binns. Draco knew he would regret what he was about to say and he knew his friends and his father would kill him he they found out but he did it anyway, he had to know what he did to make Potter completely loose his shit for nearly two weeks. "Fine, tonight, Astronomy tower, 7."
He felt Ron shove his arm and he was brought out of his thought. He was still staring at Malfoy only now the other boy was looking back at him. "You coming to the library or not?" Ron asked him. "Umm yeah sure why not," he walked out the hall with Ron and Hermione. They all had a free period that morning he could spend the time planning the next DA meeting, he'd been meaning to do it for days. Anytime he tried to do it his thoughts got preoccupied by a certain blonde boy and something told him the same thing would happen this time.
It was a rather pleasant day -well for mid October anyways- it was Sunday and he and Pansy had decided to go for a walk round the lake. He'd redone the amortentia yesterday it still has the same scent as last time though this time Harry's cologne was more prominent. There was no way he could deny it, it smelt just like the hoodie Harry had given him. He'd told him to keep it at the end of the night and Draco had worn it all yesterday and today. Though he was still trying his hardest not to admit to himself why.
"So Draco Malfoy liked Theodore Nott did he?" Harry teased him as he gave him a playful nudge. "Yeah," he muttered, he didn't care if he trusted Harry or not he wasn't about to start talking to him about Theo. Harry clearly noticed the change in his voice as he gave him a wondering look but soon changed the conversation a bit. "Can I ask you something?" Draco nodded his head to Harry "Why'd you do it the way you did. Don't say you didn't mean for those girls to hear, me and you both know you keep a eye on your surroundings at all times. You knew they were there," Harry had asked him. He wasn't expecting such a deep question.
(See the end of the chapter for
He ripped off a corner from the parchment he was aimlessly doodling on and scribbled down a note, 'everything alright? y u late?'  he pushed it across the desk to the other boy. A minute or so later he felt Draco gently nudge his arm then give him the parchment back, 'everything fine, just had to see Snape.' 'still on for tonight?' 'course potter :)'. Harry felt strangely happy at the smiley face, 'maybe he likes spending time with me as much as I do with him,' he thought to himself, but then proceeded to think it was pathetic he gave a smiley face so much thought.
"So, Potions?" he asked trying to get rid of the awkward tension between them, "Umm yeah... there's the two we.. have to practise for t-the test next week," Potter stuttered out before smiling awkwardly and heading over to the table, Draco followed him. They both slipped off there cloaks and hung them on the back of the chairs at the desk. As Potter did this Draco noticed a rather large scar on his right forearm, it looked fairly recent. He was sort of curious as to how he got it but thought it best not to ask, 'Why do you care about Potter's injures anyways? I don't. Then why are you here then, if you don't care for him? I don't know' he debated to him self, he'd been doing that a lot the past day but could only ever answer his own questions with 'I don't know' because it's true he didn't know.
She was already shaking her head. “I’d like it to be something that’s not dangerous, that gets you out of your comfort zone.”
“Harry, I will do anything you want,” Draco says quickly, and Harry’s hindbrain lights up at this. He tries to pin Draco to the wall, but Draco sidles neatly out of his reach. “But only if you finish the wand first!”
“No, seriously, your saviour complex is out of this world,” Draco continues drily. “You should definitely see somebody about it.” This earns him a chuckle from Harry, and he leans forward and touches their foreheads together again, reaching out to wipe away a tear that glistens in the moonlight. “Your work is important, and as long as you want to keep doing it I will support you in it.”
Potter shuddered in a gratifying manner. “Fuck,” he finally said. “I just keep thinking about losing my memories again; it’s really killing the mood. I don’t think I can concentrate on reading while it’s here.”
Harry’s flagging spirits leapt, suddenly buoyed by the prospect. “You’re on,” he said with a grin. He turned back to the papers in front of him and found his place and resumed writing. He knew he had to take care; his handwriting deteriorated rapidly when he wrote too quickly, as Draco was wont to point out.
“Let me see… that thief who kept taking tiny, cheap things from the Diagon Alley shops, right?”
Malfoy hands it over, and Harry allows himself a momentary fantasy of snapping it in half and throwing the pretty bastard out. He hopes it doesn’t show on his face as he balances the wand on his palm. It still feels structurally sound, which removes one possible cause of magical malfunctions from the list. Harry tries casting a
“Oh, it is,” Ginny said seriously. “But it’s also for you. Like Pansy says, everybody should have a therapist.” She looked past Harry for a moment and waved; Harry looked behind him and saw Blaise Zabini, Ginny’s other significant other, making his way through the crowd, drink in hand. She had started dating him a few months after getting together with Pansy, and their triad was a regular feature at Gryffindor pub nights. “Even Blaise has got one, haven’t you dear?” Ginny said, shifting over to make room on the bench as he reached the table.
“And what would you say has been the biggest change since you started seeing me two weeks ago?”
“Is that all?” he asks, sounding suspicious. “Aren’t there more tests to run?”
Therapy wasn’t Harry’s idea. Robards' meddling, priggish administrative assistant had swept into Harry’s office and informed him in no uncertain terms that he was on administrative leave until he could get his shit together. He’d handed Harry the contact information for Healer Tran and told him she would have to sign off on him returning to active duty. Harry had acknowledged the news calmly, unwilling to show any weakness, but later that afternoon, he laid on the floor in Grimmauld Place and stared at the ceiling in silence until Kreacher came and snidely asked if “Master would like to be watered and turned towards the sun.”
This time, Draco actually
“I know what I’m going to do,” Harry said, unconcerned. “You can make your own choices.” He opened the bottle and sniffed the contents, then poured a generous measure of the amber liquid into his mug as Draco watched. Without breaking eye contact, Harry took a small sip, then smacked his lips appreciatively as he swallowed, feeling the drink draw a warm line down the inside of his chest. “That’s quite nice,” he said.
Potter opened his eyes again. He looked sheepish. “Um. I guess I did?”
“Make something,” Malfoy suggested as if it were obvious. “Or don’t. Whatever you want.” He sat down at his wheel again and appeared to consider his work, seemingly prepared to ignore Harry completely.
Harry gratefully abandoned his current attempt and stood up. He rolled his head between his shoulders, feeling the muscles in his neck begin to loosen as he did so. He watched Malfoy get up as well and stride out the door; before he realized what he was doing, he was following him outside.
“This is
He kept an eye out as they walked, vigilant for the approach of the dark cloud. He couldn’t help noticing that Potter’s dream version of the library was made of stacks that loomed over them, extending far enough to disappear into a gloom that hid any actual walls. It lent the space an eerie atmosphere, and Draco began to regret his impulsive plan to bring them there.
Harry looked around. It was a fair point; the area around Draco’s desk looked like a particularly manic house elf had been let loose on it. “Do you want to fix that?” Harry asked.
from the scum that wanted to watch the world burn.
“We were just discussing our plans for the Christmas season,” Draco said, giving Harry a frosty smile. “Comparing how we would spend the time.”
They’re quiet for another moment, then Draco reaches out for Harry’s bar of soap and carefully asks, “Would you like me to-” Harry’s already nodding against his shoulder before he’s finished the question, so he lathers up his hands in preparation. They’ve showered together before, playfully, eventually ending up pressed up against one of the walls and rutting against each other. Draco has even tortuously, sensuously washed Harry in the shower before, never breaking eye contact and avoiding touching the other man’s cock the entire time. It turns out the brain can invent entirely new erogenous zones if the usual ones are starved of attention, and Harry had been practically incoherent by the end, begging to be taken. Draco had been all too happy to oblige him.
Harry blinked at him, then looked over at Malfoy again. His partner was still pretending to be focused on the paperwork, but his quill had stopped moving, and he appeared to be listening intently. “You, uh, think that’s a good idea?” Harry finally asked Ron hesitantly.
,” Harry interrupted, his checks aflame. “Not that I’d… I mean he’s… we’re just partners. Auror partners. I’m pretty sure there are rules against that.” He attempted a laugh, but it felt forced.
“Do you still want to do this?” Potter asked carefully. “We don’t have to.”
Harry took an involuntary breath, but he tried to play it off nonchalantly. “Oh, well, that’s easy enough,” he mimicked. “I just needed something to keep me busy.” His fingers continued to roam over the top of the clay, sensing its motion as his palms settled on it.
“We’re still technically partners,” Harry pointed out. “I haven’t finished my paperwork yet. That means you’re, how did you put it— ‘giving the appearance of respecting law and order, until it no longer benefits you to do so?’” He smiled widely. “Interesting, isn’t it?”
Harry decides the quickest path to getting what he wants is to fulfil Draco’s desires, and apparently what he wants most in the world at the moment is the stupid wand. He bounds back to his work bench, grabbing his smallest chisel en route, and sets the lathe spinning a final time. The torture of knowing that Draco is behind him, waiting for him, ready to give him what he wants, what he needs—it’s exquisite. Harry’s cock is harder than he can ever remember it being, straining uncomfortably at his trousers. He unbuckles them without thinking, slides them down and kicks them away, then gives himself a quick press of his hand through his pants to relieve some of the pressure. It’s barely tolerable; he’d much rather be rutting against Draco.
“No idea what you mean,” Draco says through another yawn, but he’s smiling to himself as he drifts off to sleep.
Without looking up from his own parchment, Draco held up a half sandwich that already had a few bites from it. Harry huffed.
“Remember?” Potter asked. He appeared baffled by the question. “I’m going to join the Aurors. It’s why I need my NEWTs.”
“Harry?” Draco asks uncertainly. Harry notices Draco’s eyes drop to his mouth, just for a moment, and feels elated. “It felt different this time. It felt like I could actually control it with the new wand.”
“What is different now that means you are ready to resume your work?”
revealed that it had already gone quarter past six, and his stomach rumbled in protest. “I don’t know about you,” he said to Draco, as he leaned back in his chair, “but I could use some supper about now.” He took a breath, steeling himself. “Want to go to that Chinese place you like so much?” Harry was proud of how casually it came out. Just one work colleague inviting another work colleague to have dinner together after work. Nothing wrong with that; it was perfectly normal. It didn’t matter that the one work colleague had an appallingly obvious crush on the other one. It was fine.
“Fuck, Malfoy,” Potter gasped. “What are you waiting for?”
aiming for a bowl, but you distracted me.”
Draco looked around them. Slowly, ever so slowly, he could make out the leading edges of the darkness extending their tendrils between the piles of objects that filled the room of hidden things. He swallowed.
the words run the length of his body, feels himself hardening in response. He gulps a breath; his mouth is dry all of a sudden.
Potter eyed him consideringly for a long moment. “Fine,” he said. “I’ll read the beginning of
“And then convinced Robards to assign the trainees to rotate through as round-the-clock observers, yeah,” Harry said. They’d spent days poring over the list of prior thefts, looking for any kind of theme or modus operandi to predict what might be hit next. Eventually, Harry had suggested they resort to brute force, and Draco had reluctantly agreed. They were only able to sell it to Robards as a training exercise, who had initially baulked at the cost of maintaining constant vigilance on the shops at Diagon Alley.
Malfoy shrugged and returned his attention to his own work. Harry watched his hands glide across the rim of the pot that he was working on, smoothly revealing a rim that was slightly folded over itself. It was like watching magic, and it was infuriating.
. It’s awful and it’s wonderful, and Harry is completely pinned by Draco’s gaze.
Draco looked up from whatever he was attempting to decipher. “Oh,” he said, sounding surprised. “Um. Maybe next time?” He paused for a moment as if searching for something else to say. “It’s almost time for me to begin those druidic rites, you know,” he finally said, a smirk appearing on his face.
on me, will you?”
Draco snorted. “Never one to leave a personal matter alone, are you?” he asked pointedly.
Draco’s eyes darted around the room, but he visibly steeled himself. “No, of course not,” he said. “Just… unexpected. You should lead the way.”
“Bring Malfoy along, then,” Ron suggested breezily. “Have some tea and cakes, coo over your new jumper from Mum. It’ll be fine.”
Draco looked over his shoulder, but Potter was filling the doorway and he couldn’t quite make out who the new visitor was. It was clear his plan was backfiring somehow; Potter either possessed a ridiculous, brazen confidence in the face of conflicting information, or else he had remarkable mental fortitude against the power of suggestion, even while deeply asleep.
“And you staring at it is really such a big help right now,” Draco hissed back. “Pick up the fucking book, Potter. We’re not leaving here without it.”
“I was just checking,” Harry said, amused. “See you in a bit.”
“Let me know how this feels,” Harry says.
They both froze. Harry’s heart sank; it’s not like he had realistically expected Draco to be happy at his intrusion, but he still felt guilty. He should have just refused to accept a program from the greeter when he originally walked into the church; scratch that, he shouldn’t have come into the church in the first place. This had all been a big mistake. It would have been less weird to loiter outside Draco’s home.
Draco shrugged. “Dreams aren’t known for being logical,” he said. “Unfortunately, we still need to find a way to wake you up once you regain all the missing memories. I probably just made it more difficult by revealing all of this, because now your brain will be primed to recognize surprises as part of the dream.”
Something changed in Malfoy’s face; Harry wasn’t sure if he could pinpoint it, but the silence between them abruptly felt charged. Malfoy leaned a little bit closer, and Harry felt like he was being pulled towards him.
“Well
Just as he was trying to figure out some way to deescalate the situation, Malfoy tapped out his cigarette and stretched. “Break’s almost over,” he said. “Good chat.” He strode briskly by Harry and re-entered the studio. Harry watched him through the window as he exchanged a few words with the teacher then made his way to his wheel. He didn’t turn it on immediately, just sat there, looking at it, and for a moment Harry thought he looked very small and alone.
“Potter, you of all people should understand when someone else is trying not to call attention to themselves,” Pansy said, giving him a hard look. “This wasn’t a plot against you; it was common decency and respect for Draco’s privacy.”
“Do we need to go back to the library and get a new one?” Potter asked. “…Does the library even exist any more?”
“Wouldn’t dream of it!” Harry lied; he had definitely entertained the idea.
“Do you know what I appreciate most about pottery?” Malfoy asked.
Harry breathes out slowly and brushes past Malfoy to reach the table that holds his lathe. He attaches the dogwood block to it and sets it spinning. “I’m going to start with a large chisel to make a cylinder and find the rough shape of the wand,” he says, hoping that by narrating his steps he’ll be able to ignore the fact that Malfoy is standing only a few steps behind him. He swears he can feel Malfoy’s eyes on his back as he reaches up to grab the chisel off of its wall mount; he is hyper-aware of every movement right now.
“It’s sex dreams,” Potter blurted out.
“There are some minute curse magic traces in the frontal lobe region,” Draco said, for both Weasley and Jenkins’ benefit. “They’re suspicious, but curse magic can also linger for a long time. Do you know if Potter suffered any curse-related incidents within the past month, particularly ones that struck in this region?”
“And you always do what I tell you to?” Draco asked, smirking. “How very interesting.”
want you.”
“Oh!” Hermione exclaimed, bringing a hand to her mouth. She looked back over her shoulder, and Harry joined her just in time to see Draco say something quietly to Andromeda and give a little formal nod of his head. “Well, it will be good for Teddy to have another relative to look up to, won’t it?” she asked reflectively. “If Malfoy wants that, of course. It wouldn’t be any good to force it.”
“Why did she say she wanted you to take the class?” Hermione asked carefully.
“And so you come to me, because you already know I make bad decisions?”
“Do you want some?” Harry asked.
Draco’s eyes narrowed. “I can already tell this is going to be good,” he muttered.
“We had just busted that one brewer who was making the subpar Polyjuice, and Robards told us to handle it. He said the BIA was making a stink at the Ministry about how they were being fobbed off.”
Harry pondered his options. Draco hadn’t told him where he was going tonight, but he had certainly implied earlier that he wouldn’t just be at home. Harry was pretty sure he knew where Draco lived; there had been a drinks night a few months earlier after a big bust, and when Draco had decided to leave that evening Harry had been chatting with him next to the Floo. Draco had grabbed some powder, then looked around before meeting Harry’s eyes for a moment, then tossed the powder into the fireplace and saying an address that Harry
“No,” Potter said, shaking his head. “My door was closed, and it squeaks really loudly as it opens. I would have noticed somebody coming in.”
“Yes,” Draco whispered urgently. “Do it!”
“I guess you have to get good at being professional about it,” Potter said. “And you were. Very professional. So, thanks again, I guess.”
Draco accepted it and proceeded to sniff the contents guardedly, as if afraid that the drinking vessel may have ruined it somehow. When the drink appeared to pass muster, he pulled his chair forward so he was within arm’s reach of Harry and sat back, waiting. “Well?” he asked. “I believe I heard something about a toast.”
“Twat,” Draco said, and Potter actually grinned at him. The man was truly a mystery.
“I’m sorry,” he said, rubbing his hand across his face. “I know you both mean well, and I know I brought this on myself somehow.” He pasted a smile on his face. “I swear I’m going to take the class seriously—I don’t want to ruin my best chance of going back to work at this point, after all!” He’d meant it to assuage their fears, but for some reason it didn’t seem to be helping.
“God,” Potter said. “I just didn’t expect…”
“—but doing this? Helping out at the studio forever? No. Circumstances change. Interests change. People change.”
“Nice to see you,” Harry said. He felt tension leaving him that he hadn’t realised he was carrying; he missed spending time with his closest friends. “Happy Christmas Andromeda!” Turning to Draco, he said: “Hermione and I will just be over there, ok?” He immediately pulled a surprised Hermione away with him, and he saw Draco give him a slightly panicky nod in response. Andromeda didn’t even acknowledge Harry’s greeting; she was busy looking Draco over, who firmed up his back and returned her gaze resolutely.
A knock at the workshop door pulls Harry out of his thoughts. He leaves his stool and goes to the door, takes a breath before opening it; Malfoy is standing there, proud as ever, but Harry thinks he can detect a tension about his lean frame.
Several unproductive hours later, Harry and Draco sat slumped in their respective chairs, staring at the large pile of largely unreadable paperwork.
“No, I don’t need help with the assignment,” Draco replied. He took a seat in the chair that sat on the other side of Potter’s desk as he gave himself time to think. Potter left his doorway and came and sat across from him. Draco decided to go for the most likely avenue for shocking a professor, in hopes that they would be kicked out of this dream as quickly as possible. “It’s about my son. He’s a student in one of your classes. Potions, actually.” He smiled to himself at the notion of Potter teaching Potions. What an absurd concept.
Draco huffed. “If you don’t want to say yes, then we’ll just keep brainstorming other possibilities,” he replied curtly. “It’s fine, Potter. It wouldn’t really be any use anyways unless you would actually enjoy it, or at least find it pleasurably distracting.”
“Sorry, I was just surprised is all,” Harry said hastily. “I just… I was thinking about whether I would be able to ignore my family like that.” He paused. “It must have been hard for you.”
Harry was about to continue the argument when Robards poked his head around the door once more. “Ah, Draco, there you are. Just wanted to wish you both a Happy Christmas before I take off.” He paused as he took in the state of Harry’s desk, and seemed to notice the strained air that weighed heavy between the two Aurors. “Is everything alright?”
“You’re such a tease,” Potter said, but he didn’t move.
“It’ll be fine,” Harry said. “If you just take that half of the piles, I’ll take this side, and we’ll find it in no time.”
“Harry!” Draco says urgently, and Harry realizes he’s closed half the distance between them, and Draco is actually looking slightly alarmed. “The wand!”
“Well,” Draco said later that afternoon as he stood and stretched. “That’s it. I’ve finished redoing every single witness statement, and I’ve verified all the Pensieve timecodes for quick retrieval during the trial if necessary.”
Potter cocked his head. “So what
Harry flipped two fingers at him good-naturedly. “Pass me that,” he said, motioning to the mug on Draco’s desk.
There are several chopped garlic cloves, some plum tomatoes, the spice mixture that he’s already prepared for when he’s ready to start frying, and an unpeeled onion; he prefers to leave that for last because of the painful way his eyes react to the fumes as he dices them. There’s a finely chopped red chili that’s a compromise between his own tastes and Harry’s, who grows more and more enamoured with heat with each passing year. The basmati rice is already in the rice cooker - since it turns itself off when it’s ready he always starts it immediately to avoid forgetting about it in the bustle of pulling a meal together.
“What?” Harry asked, nonplussed. “What are you doing in my pottery class?”
Harry’s heart stuttered. “I, uh…” he said, stalling. His mouth was suddenly dry. “I don’t think that I can answer that while we’re staring at each other like this. It’s not… it doesn’t have a nice answer like yours.”
Harry paused, feeling wrong-footed. “What do you mean?” he asked. “Of course I do. I’m good at my job, and I’m just sitting around right now. I could be doing so many more productive things with my time.”
crap at it—”
“I think you must be mistaken,” Draco said. “The two of you haven’t been married for years.” It seemed like as good a subject as any to prod at to provoke a reaction from Potter. Maybe being reminded of how things turned out would be shocking enough to kick them back to the world outside Potter’s uninspired head.
“Er, yeah,” Harry said. “We like to include her and Teddy. Is that an issue?”
“Well, I’m not,” Draco says. “So you may as well just get it off your chest.”
Harry couldn’t think of a reason that Draco would intentionally leave his wand behind at the office. Harry certainly kept his with him at all times; while his fourth year Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher may have turned out to be a disguised criminal, the mantra of “constant vigilance” had imprinted itself over the years that followed. Harry never wanted to be caught unprepared. It was hard to imagine Draco choosing to live differently, given everything he had been through as well.
“I just…” Harry begins, before trailing off, sounding lost. “That only happened because I wasn't here with you. I could have left earlier. I didn’t actually
Harry checked over his shoulder again, feeling paranoid. “You can’t just say things like that out loud!” he hissed. “It’s fine. It’s just a, you know. It’ll pass. I’m fine. We’re professional.”
“Malfoy,” came Potter’s voice from above him, and the note of triumph from before was gone. “What the fuck is that?”
, Hermione,” Harry said, annoyed. “I’m just talking to someone who happens to be a magical therapist because Robards told me to. It’s not the same.”
Harry was twenty-five minutes into failing to make his first bowl when he heard the studio door open and a half-familiar voice said “Sorry I’m late.”
shouldn’t be focused on how gratifying the other man’s response was, but honestly, who could blame him for it?
Harry’s heart immediately began to hammer. Had Draco noticed his unprofessional glances? Was this going to be one of those conversations where he would try to let Harry down gently? Was he making Draco uncomfortable? Or… maybe Draco had noticed the glances, and this would be one of those conversations where they sorted out how they felt about each other and what it meant?
“Ah, if only we frequented establishments that would serve such fine cuisine,” Blaise said forlornly. “Instead we are here.”
Harry shivered in a sudden gust of wind. There were another thirty minutes of class left after the break, but it didn’t feel like there was much point to the whole thing. He wasn’t looking forward to discussing the experience with Healer Tran, who would definitely ask about it at their next session. At least it wasn’t the sort of class that involved grades. He could just… stop doing it and never think about it again, without harming any future prospects. Unless his magical therapist took it poorly and refused to sign off on his return to duty. Then again, he’d attended two classes; surely that counted.
he’s blonde. Not sure, though,” Pansy said. At her last statement, everyone turned to Draco.
Draco stepped out around half an hour later. He had soaked in the hot water to try to make himself feel better. His stomach hurt, his head was pounding and his skin felt tingly. He hated the bad hangovers.
“No.”
He walked back into his room with his towel wrapped around his waist. He changed into a white shirt and sweatpants and walked out into the living room, only to see Blaise was home. Him and Pansy were sitting on the couch talking in hushed voices. What the fuck were they on about?
“The one about the Dragonfire pub,” Harry answered, walking behind the couple.
“Hey, I brought pizza,” he said, setting it down on the table.
That Saturday started off pretty well. It wasn't raining, although the weather was getting colder as each day passed. Autumn had just started, and Draco really loved this season. He was wearing black pants, white shirt and a black jumper over it . His hair was combed back, although he knew it would get messed up pretty soon.
Draco looked at her in silence. He didn’t know how it happened, but he had grown fond of the Weasley girl, and seeing her like that messed with him.
Draco scoffed at the memory of himself begging to go outside and play, his eyes filled with tears, and his father disregarding him and telling him that Draco was better than those filthy mudbloods. At the time, Draco didn’t know why he was better. He didn’t understand the distinction, all he wanted was friends.
“Does she know that?”
Dromeda pushed past Draco and opened the door to her daughter’s bedroom. It wasn’t much, just a double bed, a closet and a whole bunch of posters of muggle rock bands glued on the walls. He glanced at his aunt only to see she was crying. He put his arm around her in comfort, and they stood like that until her tears dried. Draco didn’t know how long it had been, but he didn’t care. All he cared about was getting back the time they lost.
“It’s because of people like you that families like mine are having a hard time getting accepted into society, and why this place is getting watched by Aurors,” Draco spat. “I think it’s time you leave. All of you, get out.”
“Follow me,” Xavier said, turning away from the reception and heading down a hallway. Draco wanted this to be done already, he knew Ted would get tired and cranky anytime soon. He groaned internally at the thought of dealing with an angry baby in front of these stuck-up Aurors.
Potter turned to Hermione and nudged her, breaking her glare at Pansy. “Hermione, you can start now.”
Oh God. Showing up to make plans with Aurors with a half breed baby in tow? He was definitely sealing his family’s reputation in a fucking golden coffin.
“Really? What did it say?”
Harry woke up drenched in sweat, again. He was so tired of waking up trembling, crying and occasionally puking every day. Harry hadn’t slept well in so long, and it made him so angry. Voldemort had plagued him ever since he was born, and now, even after his death he still messed with Harry’s mind. He sat up in his bed, reached for his glasses and looked at the time. It was 5am, which meant he had slept for only 2 hours. Yet Harry knew he wouldn’t be able to go back to sleep, so he got up.
“Hey, love, it’s you,” he said, kissing Hermione. “Mornin’, Harry”
“Actually, we’re here to pick you up. We’re heading over to my house and have a couple of drinks,” Harry said. She blinked a few times.
“Fine, Potter. I’ll help,” Malfoy said, at last.
“Is that-”
“There’s a chance. The problem is, they can keep the promise to the ones who joined them. What about those who denied them? Who stood in their way? They wouldn’t go after the muggleborns only. All of us are fucked,” Potter said, gesturing to all in the room.
“I got a letter from your mum the other day,” Andromeda said without turning to look at him.
“What about it?” Draco asked, crossing his arms in defense. He glanced at Pansy, which had a look of worry etched on her face. “And does she have to be here?”
“Peter. I do not tolerate this kind of disrespect. The Weasley family is incredibly esteemed in the Ministry, and I will not stand for this harassment. Leave,” said the Head Auror, and Peter scrambled up to leave. He turned to the frozen pair on the table and shook his head.
Draco put down a squirming Ted to let him wobble about the now baby safe space, then turned to look at his aunt. She was dressed simply, in a soft wool jumper she had probably knitted herself, cream coloured trousers and knee-high boots. Her black overcoat hung on her arm.
. He remembered he was supposed to babysit Ted. How was he supposed to go to that meeting when he had to take care of a baby?
“I think that’s enough drinking for you,” Blaise said, grabbing Draco by the back of his collar and dragging him down the hallway into his bedroom. Draco was too dizzy to object or see what he was doing, but he caught a glimpse of someone laying on Blaise’s bed as they walked past his room.
“You? Having a drink here? Humour me, please.” Malfoy answered.
“If you’ve truly changed, you’ll help us, Malfoy. We need to stop this before it spreads, again,” Harry said. He wished he could say more. He wanted to pour his heart out to someone, anyone, but he couldn’t spill all his fear on Malfoy at a pub in Knockturn Alley. That would just be completely awkward.
“Hi, Harry,” Ginny answered, her red hair glowing against the moonlight.
And the most important bit was that their law system needed a huge reform, as soon as possible. At least that was Draco’s opinion, though he kept it to himself.
“We need to have a talk about your drinking. Again.” Blaise said. He leaned forward on the couch, resting his elbows on his knees and intertwining his hands.
“No drinking around him! Also, Harry’s picking him up Thursday, don’t forget.”
“Draco, I’m your friend. I know we haven’t talked in ages, but I still care for you. Blaise told me it hasn’t been easy for you, but drinking isn’t solving anything, is it?”
“Who’s going first?”
Draco was pulled back into reality when he heard a shuffle beside him. It was dark, so it was hard to see who was there. He pulled out his wand, murmured “Lumos” and pointed at the dark alley. He could make out a silhouette, but it could be a drunk wizard. Yet something told Draco that it wasn’t.
You see, after the war ended, Draco spent a lot of time reconsidering his family, until he came to a conclusion that he needed them more than ever. So, he made up with his aunt Andromeda, who had been hated by his mother ever since she married Ted Tonks, a muggleborn.
The men started either leaving through the Floo network or apparating, and in no time the pub had gone back to its normal chattering. Draco got back to the bar and stood next to Tom, waiting for the death stare that would imply extra hours. Yet when he looked up at his boss, the bald man was staring at the spot where the group had been.
“Good evening, gentlemen. Need anything over here?” he asked. Draco hated being a waiter, he preferred staying at the bar and being able to watch everything, but he tried to swallow his pride as he spoke to them.
“I hate it when people call me Ginevra.”
“Morning, Ron,” Harry answered, slightly out-of-breath.
Draco greeted some acquaintances as he walked over to the bar, spotting a bigger number of those ex-Death Eaters than usual. He didn’t pay much attention to that, just found it odd to see so many of them gathered again. Draco reached the bar and lifted the small door to walk behind it. He spotted his boss and walked to the other end to reach him.
“Well, that’s quite a lot to take in. No wonder your friend is so desperate as to ask a Weasley for help,” she said, smirking. Draco already knew she knew he was talking about himself, so he wasn’t surprised.
As he reached the last step, Draco knew immediately what room his aunt was planning to change. To his left, the door to Ted’s room stood ajar, and Draco could see his aunt putting him down inside his kid fence where he could play safely. Down the hall was her room, which Draco had never gone inside, and to his right…
“Of course, mate. We have to make up for our sins somehow.”
So that was where he was headed that day, and that's how he knew his hair gel wouldn't hold his hair back long enough, because as soon as he picked up Teddy, the little boy ruined his hair. Draco smiled at the memory of the last time he saw his nephew.
Draco stood swaying in the foyer as Blaise closed the door and redid their protection spells.
“That’s why I don’t show it, Weasley,” he answered. Draco watched her go and sat there, reminiscing their conversation. It was one of the weirdest talks of his life, but it felt good to get that weight off his chest.
“Language, Malfoy,” Potter said, eyeing Ted, who was dozing off on Draco’s lap. “What did you discuss in that meeting?”
“In my opinion, I think you should talk to her, sort it out, and then shag the Nott kid. You obviously have feelings for him and you shouldn’t be repressing them.”
“He stays,” Potter said.
Tom was one of those scary looking people that when you get to know them are actually incredibly nice. He was over 6ft tall, bald, with a bushy red beard and he was so built that he could probably crack a skull with the tip of his fingers. His nose was crooked, probably from a fight, and his eyes were small and black. Yet, despite his terrifying face, he was one of the nicest people Draco had met.
“Saw an Auror lurking around the door the other night. They’re probably keeping an eye out for these kinds of meetings. You know I don’t like these wankers here, but they pay good money. So just keep ‘em in line for me.”
“Now you’ve just ruined the whole aesthetic.”
“Good. When are you leaving?”
“What happened?” he asked, sitting on the table in front of her. It took Ginny a few minutes to compose herself. Draco passed her a water bottle, which she chugged to the bottom.
“I know,” the person answered. “Please don’t do anything rash, I’m here to talk.”
“You wouldn’t. Everyone knows you’re on thin ice with the Ministry. Besides, we’re not doing anything wrong, it’s just a group of old friends gathering after a long time,” the man smirked, his voice heavy with accent, gesturing to the people around him.
“Yes you can, and you will let us through,” Pansy said. “We’re good now, kid. We’re only here to talk,” yet her expression held anything but friendliness.
“Tom?” he said, rubbing his eyes.
It was Monday morning and Draco was getting ready to pick up his baby cousin, and then he would head to the Ministry. He stood in front of the mirror, trying to calm his nerves. Nowadays, he didn’t really care about family reputation and that sort of bullshit, but there was something quite outrageous about working with Aurors and mingling with a ‘muggle-loving whore and her beast grandson’, which was how pureblood families liked to describe Andromeda and Teddy.
“I would,” Harry said. He met Malfoy's gaze and he tried to convey… he wasn't really sure what, but he knew he wanted to spend more time around Malfoy. He wanted to solve this new mystery. “I really would.”
“You’re good at thinking things through,” Harry said, refusing to back down. “I appreciate that about you. I’m much more likely to jump right into something if I don’t really understand it.”
“I think Draco might actually like it,” Harry said, thinking back to their earlier conversation. “His choice, of course. But I think he’s really interested in getting to know Andromeda, too, based on what he told me. He keeps surprising me.”
“My aunt is here?” he asked.
“Slughorn said it would be obvious,” Draco said. This plan would only work if Potter were the one to find the substitute for his missing memories. “See if anything catches your eye.”
Of all the people who might turn up at the front step of his wand-making workshop, Draco Malfoy is perhaps the least likely. He has his fist raised, about to knock again, but he slowly lowers it as Harry crosses his arms and stands there without saying anything. They look at each other, and Malfoy is the first to break and glance away uncomfortably. Harry feels like he’s won the opening round; it’s sharp and sweet, and it feels vindictive but he doesn’t care.
“This is the worst,” Harry sighed. “What if we owled Robards to ask him to recall someone who could help us for half a day or something?”
“You’re serious,” Weasley said slowly. “You’re going to see what he’s dreaming?”
“Yes!” Harry says through gritted teeth. “Now go read a book!” Setting Malfoy’s hair aside for later, he grabs his roughest sandpaper and sets the lathe turning once more. The next part requires him to hold the sandpaper against the wand as it turns, pressing down the roughest chisel marks and ensuring the surface of the wand is smooth to the touch.
, he would finish a stupid bowl without making a mess of the whole thing.
He doen’t know how long they remain pressed up together like that. They certainly don’t speak for some time, and when Harry doesn’t push him away Draco begins rubbing himself against Harry, slowly, tortuously, and Harry lets out a guttural moan. He deliriously wonders if they could stay like this forever.
Harry felt his face flush. “That’s not what I meant,” he mumbled. “But if you
Potter pulled a face at him. “Do you really still care about Slughorn’s assignment?” he asked. “Aren’t there more important things to think about, like how there’s an evil cloud devouring the school?”
“Mate,” Ron began, but he trailed off. “I dunno. Maybe Hermione’s right and this could be a good thing for you.” He smiled, but Harry had a lot of practice reading his friends by now, and he felt his heart sink. He’d assumed they’d be on his side on this one.
Frustrated, he carelessly tosses the wand into his box of other failed experiments and returns to his workbench. He collects the wood shavings surrounding his lathe and vanishes them, perhaps more aggressively than is strictly necessary. It's satisfying, though. He replaces his chisels on their wall mount and sits down on his stool, staring out the window of his workshop as he contemplates what he can do to get out of his slump. He has spent several months focusing on turning wands using Muggle woodworking techniques, with as little magic involved as possible, and unfortunately that means that much of the existing wand lore out in the world that might otherwise help him is useless. Perhaps it’s time to give in and return to the traditional wand making forms that Ollivander taught him during his apprenticeship. It’s just that he finds them so restrictive; there’s no room for creativity. Ollivander chided him whenever he decided to follow his gut, experimenting with new woods or cores instead of sticking to the prescribed ones. As soon as Harry had finished his apprenticeship he’d decided to focus exclusively on his experiments.
He pauses, closing his eyes. Draco hums encouragingly, not sure exactly if he’s supposed to be reacting right now or not. Harry takes a breath again, seeming to steel himself for something yet to come. Draco realizes that Harry’s starting to slip into what he thinks of as his debriefing voice - it's a little bit like lecturing, as Harry tries to relate the facts of the case dispassionately, like he says they’re taught in their Healer training.
Draco gave him a look and waved his half sandwich again.
“Being the keen Auror that you are, and knowing that I just came from the archives, you now see me looking through the contents of my desk. What might you infer about the location of the paperwork for the case?” Draco was speaking in very precise tones as he continued to shift papers around his desk.
Harry looked to his left a bit wildly, grabbing a piece of paper off the top of the mess that consumed his desk. He scanned it, mouthing words to himself as he did and shaking his head.
The sound of the office door banging open caught Harry by surprise and the chair immediately overbalanced and sent him plummeting to the floor. Draco stalked by without even offering him a hand up, making his way over to his own desk on the other side of their shared space.
“I don’t know what I’m looking for!” Potter argued. “How do you expect me to find a book when you won’t tell me anything about it?”
Draco shook his head. “I don’t think that will help,” he said. “We need to trick your brain, somehow. Find a way to distract you so that it’s like you’re experiencing it in the dream state again.”
“I split the wand down the middle,” Harry says, extracting the wand from the lathe and setting it on the platform attached to his small jigsaw. “Then I rejoin the two halves afterward.”
Harry imagined himself as an Auror in another four years. It made him feel tired just thinking about it, but that was fine. Tiredness could be managed. His mind rebelled when he tried to contemplate forty years in the Aurors, but surely Mr Weasley had been working for the Ministry for that long. That was normal. He would just have to grit his teeth and bear it.
“You sound like you’re trying to convince yourself,” Ginny said, smirking.
“Yes, well, nobody would ever have mistaken you for logical,” Draco said huffily.
on this stool here, and let’s see if we can observe the problems you described.”
“Careful,” Malfoy murmured. He was looking at him closely, and it made Harry a bit nervous. “Watch how much pressure you’re putting on the clay.”
“Oh, goodness, yes,” came a new, feminine voice. Draco spared a glance over his shoulder and saw Hermione Granger sitting next to her husband; she must have arrived while he had been inside Potter’s dream.
“That bint!” Draco said, apparently shocked into acknowledging that he was listening to the conversation. “Pansy, not your sister, obviously,” he continued. “She never said a thing about it to me.”
He’s not even looking at the stool as it hits the floor once more. He’s watching the curve of Malfoy’s lip, the flush of his cheeks, and he would swear he can feel a force pulling him towards the other man. Harry has to grab on to the edge of the workbench to keep himself from approaching Malfoy, which feels like it would be a bad idea right at this moment.
They crept through the darkened halls of the school. Draco caught sight of the darkness out of the corner of his eye a couple times along the way, but he was careful to focus Potter’s attention on other things. He made wry comments about Potter’s rule-breaking tendencies, or how it probably wouldn’t even matter if they were caught because of the special treatment that Potter would undoubtedly receive. The other man invariably began to snipe back at him in whispered tones, and when Draco checked again he could no longer see any sign of the cloud.
“Now, Bill,” Arthur chided gently. “You’re welcome here, Draco. Glad you and Harry could make it.”
“I didn’t want to rush you,” Draco said. “But I’d feel better if we were leaving soon. There are still so many Pensieve records to go through.”
Harry gives this little sigh, like Draco doing laundry is just slightly too much to take on top of everything else. “Honestly, the sacrifices that I make for you,” Draco says. Harry huffs a small, breathy laugh in response, and Draco feels his heart unclench a tiny bit. He walks, dripping, out of the bathroom to the linen closet across the hall and grabs one towel to tie around his waist, and another one he makes sure is extra fluffy for Harry’s benefit. Making his way back to Harry, he envelops his husband in the warmth of the towel, receiving a soft thanks in response, before he sets about drying himself off with his own.
Harry considers his latest wand and sighs. It
Draco considered his options. The common opinion in the mind-magic community was that making the dreamer aware that they were dreaming made interventions more difficult. A mind that understood that anything could be possible would no longer be shocked as easily. Draco figured he had a better chance continuing to string Potter along at this point.
“Well,” Draco announced, jolting Harry from his thoughts. “I think we’ve decoded enough of the shorthand by now that we should be able to make decent progress on rewriting the paperwork.” Draco was noiselessly tapping his fingers against his desk while he looked at their shared decoding chart, and Harry was mesmerised by the motion.
“You can engage in whatever frivolous activities you wish,” Draco said haughtily. “I intend to pursue the course of justice.”
Potter gave him an odd look. “It was all over the papers last year when we got married; I’m surprised you missed it.
?” Harry asked, looking guiltily over his shoulder to make sure Draco wasn’t standing there. “We’re not together. That’s not what everyone thinks, is it? Oh, god.” Had he accidentally brought Draco to the Burrow under false pretenses?
“Guess who I brought back with me!” Ron called as he pushed open the front door and they all stepped inside.
Potter gaped at him, his embarrassment apparently forgotten for a moment in the face of Draco’s matter-of-fact delivery. “You…” he began. “You’re really suggesting that we…”
Draco dropped his head down on his desk, seemingly giving up on the parchment for the time being. “No, Potter,” he said, wearily. “I do not perform rites in the nude. I also do not swim in the Channel. The plans that I do have, however, happen to take place at night.”
“Listen,” Draco said carefully. “You might actually be on to something.”
She gave him a level look across the table. “Come on. Therapy’s not something to be embarrassed about. I’ve got a therapist; we usually only meet a couple times a year now, but I used to go more often.”
To be completely honest with himself Harry didn't know either. He liked being able to shut the git up when he would call Hermione a mudblood or if he commented about Ron's family. He also hated doing it though it would make Malfoy feel annoyed all day, as much as he tried to hide it Harry could tell. He'd keep the sleeves of his cloak over the palms of his hands and tug at them with his other. It was a habit of his and he only did it when he was annoyed even though he'd never admit to it as he always tried to hide it. Harry was suddenly aware this was not a normal thing to know about Malfoy but he put it down to having to sit next to him in lessons as the teachers forced them to sit in register order. He didn't like it when Malfoy got like that he wanted to be able to tell him to calm down and that he'd stop doing it. He always told himself he'd stop doing it but then Malfoy would do something to hurt Hermione or Ron and he didn't care anymore if it annoyed Malfoy but then he'd always regret it. He'd also noticed Malfoy had stop doing stuff to annoy him it was only ever Hermione or Ron. No scarhead, no comments about his parents, nothing. The only time he'd acknowledge Harry existence was when he'd tell him he was making the potion wrong and to let him make it so they didn't fail.
"So did you not want to accept it or-" Draco begun wondering "Sort of... growing up in the muggle world I always heard bad stuff about it. It took me a while to separate all the shit I've heard over the years and what I actually thought about it." Draco just nodded at this, he didn't know what to say. All he could think about was if the last week had taught him anything it was Merlin he had it easy when he was realising.
It was a sort a sniffling noise sort of like someone was crying, he walked over to the door and put his ear up against it, definitely someone crying he thought to himself. He pushed to door open a bit to find his suspicions correct. Theo was staring into the mirror with his hands clutching each side of the marble sink. He looked towards Draco as he entered the room tears were flowing down his cheeks he opened his mouth as if he was about to explain but then closed it again. Draco slowly walked towards his best friend and put his arm around him bringing him into a hug, Theo completely fell into the hug resting his head on Draco’s chest. He noticed while in that position that Theo's hair had a faint smell of coconut. They stood there in the dim lights for a few seconds before Draco dared to speak, "Whatever’s going on you’ll be okay, you know that,” Draco whispered to him and after a few seconds he slowly nodded his head. They stood there for a couple more minutes Draco completely lost in thoughts as what could possibly cause him this much hurt. He was the last person he’d ever expect to see crying.
It was summer before his fifth year at Hogwarts, he’d known for a while and honestly wasn’t to sure why he didn’t already tell people. Being gay was completely okay with the whole wizarding  world, it had been for centuries. They never understood why muggles had such a problem with it. So he decided he’d tell his parents, he entered the dining room and sat down at the long black table opposite his mother. Tonight was one of the few nights they hadn’t had any guests in the manor. They’d been coming all summer, spending the whole time having secret conversations with his father. Draco knew what they were about tho, he knew what happened at the triwizard. "Umm mother father there’s something I’d like to talk to you about,” Draco spoke in no more than a whisper. "Go on Draco,” came his mother voice, more gentle than normal she must be able to tell something was bugging him. "Well umm... I like boys the ways I’m supposed to like girls,” he spoke whilst keeping his stare fixed on a spot on the wall. He heard his father put down his cutlery, "Draco” there was a pause before he spoke again. "Look at me son,” Draco looked at his father and for the first time in a while he looked back at him like he did truly care for his son. "Okay... but the golden rule of your dating life still stands, only slytherins. Got that?” "Yes father” . Draco felt beyond relieved to finally have said it. The dinner went on as normal and so did their summer.
Harry couldn't stop himself from thinking about Seamus' last comment, he didn't mean it. Right? right. Harry thought. He couldn't possibly know he'd only told Ron, was Harry just really obvious. Had he seen Harry checking Cedric out last year, did he see the way he had looked at the other boy. No he couldn't have Harry thought to himself, he had to change Seamus' mind. He knew what he had to do even though he hated the thought of doing this to anyone and yet somehow doing it to Malfoy just seemed to make Harry feel even worse.
He allowed himself to glance over at the Slytherin table Malfoy was sat with his usual friends. Parkinson, Zabini and Nott. He was joking with Parkinson and Zabini about something whilst eating an apple. Once again his thoughts had made their way back to the events of last week. He didn't know why he'd frozen up, he should of just ignored it and carried on, not obsess over it for a week. Malfoy had only done what he'd been doing to him for the past month but he couldn't help thinking back to being so close to the blonde. Having there faces inches apart, he could of just kissed him right their. That's if he wanted to, which he didn't! He hated the other boy.
"So, you made this before?" Potter asked him, he realised the other boy must have been talking to him as he had a mental debate with himself. "Huh? What's that Potter?" he asked him "Draught of peace, you done it before?" he repeated himself, "Yeah a few times last year," he replied cooly as he set up him equipment. "Last year?" Potter quizzed him, he was confused for a second till he remembered that Potter wouldn't know what he was on about so he explained. "Ugh Snape sometimes gives me more advanced potions that what we do in class to practise," "Oh, cool I guess," Potter responded "Yeah suppose he likes to challenge my ability I guess. Anyway you doing that wrong, give it here?" He spoke as he jumped down from where he had sat on the table next to Harry's potion.
He wasn't Potter to him anymore, he was Harry. Draco supposed that was normal, they were friends but he was a pureblood and he had learnt from a young age that there's very few people you refer to by their first name. He only started calling Pansy by her first name after a year of knowing her. He decided he'd just put it down to hearing other people call him that so often in class and go back to trying to find the Canopus star.
"Nah it's fine, what you thinking about anyways, you seem quite preoccupied lately," she quizzed him. "It's nothing important," he tried to play it cool, "Is it a boy? and don't lie to me because you came back on Friday night with that hoodie, which you didn't leave with and you wore all yesterday and today," she gave him a knowing smile before resting her head back onto him shoulder. "Yeah it is," he told her in a fairly timid voice "If I asked who or for anymore details would you tell me?" she posed the question, "Not in the name of Salazar," he expressed. She gave him a nod of understanding before he went back to his thoughts and she started gossiping.
"Hi," Potter replied as he went over to him and sat down next to him while unpacking his equipment. "So what did Snape want with ya before?" Potter quizzed him, "Oh just wanted to know how the ugh veritaserum went," he responded. "Bet he wasn't very pleased his godson messed up a potion, " Potter said, while plotting the Arcturus star on his graph. "Nah wasn't too thrilled," he voiced.
He knew what the answer was going to be to his next question but he knew he couldn't just tell Harry he knew he was gay. "What about you Potter, got any girls?". He stayed silent for a minute without looking away from his hands, he had a look of concentration etched on his face as if he was debating something with himself.
"Wait, never?" Harry asked "Well I mean you were a bit last year but I just put that down to the triwizard," Ron said casually "Wait, was there someone last year?". 'Great' Harry thought to himself, 'Another topic you try to avoid'. "Umm.. just leave it Ron," he said trying to sound serious "Oh so there was, who was he?" Ron said enthusiastically. Harry knew he wasn't going to get Ron off his back so he said the only thing he knew would get him to drop it. "Fine, this year who I like is none of your business but... umm.. last year I liked.. Cedric," He spoke the last word in no more than a whisper, his crush on Cedric hadn't been that big but he still hated thinking about the boy. He didn't look at Ron anymore instead he just looked down a nearby corridor, he noticed Hermione walking back down it towards them. He nudged Ron and pointed his head in her direction to tell him. "Mate.. I'm sorry by the way about him.. I had no idea.. if you want to tal-"
He was back in the Common room about ten minutes after he left the tower. He entered to see Pansy and Blaise at one of the sofa’s near the fire, they were doing their potions essay. He made his way over and said he'd join them once he got his stuff from his dorm. When he entered the dorm everything was like it normally was his and Theo's beds made whilst Blaise had stuff scattered across the top of his. He never had been one to like things neat but, he heard a noise coming from the bathroom.
"It won't work," Draco insisted. "Like I said, It's worth a try, isn't it?" he hissed back, his voice shaking a bit. "No," Draco voiced "But if mean less shagging with every girl in the school helps you realise that then by all means go ahead," he said sarcastically, leaning back against a wall. "I'm not shagging every girl in the school, I kissed my girlfriend and it's not mean less, I really like her," he spat as his voice got higher at the last part-something that Draco had noticed over the years only happened when he lied-.
Potter looked down at his shoes then back out at the view, he looked like he was considering telling him or not, he'd been like this for about thirty seconds when Draco spoke up. "Come on Potter, I haven't got all night," Draco voiced clearly loosing his patience as it was more of a yell. "Sorry," Potter mumbled staring back down at the ground, he'd never seen Potter like this before he seemed somewhat fragile in that moment, he didn't know what to do. He settled for just stating "Sorry for raising my voice," he spoke this time trying to say it gently, he didn't know where his sudden caring for Potter's feelings came from but all he knew was they were definitely there. "No I'm being serious I'm sorry for everything about the last month, I did it to you loads and you did it to me once and felt so annoyed and embarrassed that I skipped half my lessons for nearly two weeks. I'm sorry that I call you ferret, sorry that I make fun of your hair... umm.. I'm sorry for the past five years." Draco stood their in shock taking in what just happened and based of Potter reaction to what he'd said he seemed pretty shocked as well.
"D," Theo whispered in an uncertain tone after a few minutes of them sat there. "Yeah," he responded as he absentmindedly rubbed circles into Theo's back. "I-I don't like it... I'm fine with others being it.. but I can't handle it... I don't want to be... different. I just I w-want to be like e-everyone else. I get i-it was easier f-for you but... I don't w-want it," he stuttered out as he looked up at Draco. "Theo," he spoke as gently as he could "Are you.. gay?".
After Draco turns the flirting back on Harry. Harry has no choice but to admit to himself the actual reason he did this all in the first place. Leading the boys to secretly meet up at the Astronomy tower. Harry gets Draco to agree to something he'd never thought could happen. And Draco gets an quickly increasing worry about one of his friends.
Ginny looked surprised for the first time. “Oh,” she said. “Well, before he left Ron was saying things about you and Malfoy spending quality time together today, and I remember what you were like about him in the past, and then you showed up here together… I guess I just assumed you and he were—”
“And if it does?” Malfoy asks nervously.
Hermione eyed him curiously. “In what ways?” she asked.
“I didn’t want to leave him behind while I skived off here,” Harry said. “And Ron said that Pansy’s here, so he wouldn’t be, you know, completely stranded. And then we realised that he's never met Andromeda or Teddy…”
“Ransomware, I expect,” Draco said. “The goal would be to keep Potter asleep long enough to demand a ransom to wake him up, and threaten removing his memories if the ransom isn’t paid.”
Draco’s first instinct is to reply with something a little bit cutting about Harry’s need to flagellate himself, but something about Harry’s demeanour seems more fragile than usual. “Must have been quite a night,” he says instead, wrapping his arms around Harry’s waist, and he feels Harry lean back into him in response. He’s tense, but when Draco gives him a bit of a squeeze out of habit he feels Harry shudder a bit before leaning more of his weight against Draco.
“It’s only the 23rd!” Draco cried at the unfortunate soul who had apparently drawn the short straw for keeping the lights on during the holidays.
Draco groaned. “Now it’s all coming back to me,” he said, putting a hand over his eyes. “We just ended up warding every cheap and small item in the stores that hadn’t been hit yet.”
“Oh?” Harry asked again and wanted to kick himself. “What about… us?”
“This isn’t about me, Potter,” Draco said. “This is about me tormenting you until you’re half out of your mind.”
Harry wasn’t sure if he was expected to respond. He assumed Malfoy was talking to him, or at him, or near him or something, and just being super weird about it. He felt uncomfortably seen, but acknowledging it in that moment would just make it worse.
a good job.”
Draco pulled a face. “Honestly, that’s the closest you’ve come so far,” he said.
He glanced briefly at the course listing that Harry’s dreaming brain had conjured up, but he was no longer certain that this would be a productive conversational avenue.
Harry sighs. This is getting into new territory for him. “I need to do some research. Consult with some people. You should come back later this week. Maybe try not to make anyone fall in love with you.”
“Ah, I guess you
It’s slightly better this time as Malfoy settles himself in a chair and begins to read. Harry is able to focus on his hands again, and their position relative to the wand as it spins at high speeds. Small particles of wood fly around him, and he has to take short breaks as the friction of the sandpaper against the wood makes it too warm to handle. He spends a good fifteen minutes on the task, progressively switching to higher grain papers to remove the roughness of the wood. He tries not to worry about Malfoy while he’s doing it, but they’re both being quiet again, and it’s making Harry nervous.
“What we need is a decoding spell,” Harry said morosely. “What good is magic, anyways, if it can’t even do what we need?”
“See?” Ron said. “Malfoy can berate Pansy, and you can say hi to Mum; it’ll be great.”
“Sorry, I can’t hear you over the sound of me winning the race,” Harry said nonchalantly as he turned back to his paperwork. He knew his shield charms were strong; Draco would have to work to break through. That should give him at least a bit more time to try to close the gap between them.
Draco sighed. He had no plan, no idea of what to do, so he resorted to the truth. “You’re right,” he said. “You are dreaming. Not only that, but you’re actually trapped inside this dream. Your body is in St. Mungo’s and I’m trying to wake you up through legilimency.”
“I—” Potter panted, still continuing to use Draco’s mouth as he pleased. “I finished the book.” He was still holding on to it with one hand; the other had fisted itself in Draco’s hair at some point. His eyes looked wild—he seemed half out of control as he chased his impending orgasm. “What now, Malfoy?”
Ginny raised her eyebrows. “Ok, that’s not where I would have guessed that sentence was going.”
Molly patted his cheek. “As he should,” she said mock sternly. “You’re still a growing boy.”
“You really went all out, mate,” Ron said. “You wouldn’t know any of this is here from the outside.”
,” Harry whispered as he stared at Malfoy. His wheel revolved in front of him, forgotten, as he tried to work out the likelihood of Draco Malfoy turning out to be an assistant teacher at a Muggle art studio. It defied explanation. Could Healer Tran have known about this? Had she done it on purpose? He was pretty sure he’d never mentioned Malfoy to her, but she came off as just devious enough to make him consider it.
A few minutes later there’s no sign that Draco was ever in the throes of dinner prep, and he’s eating his week-and-a-half-old pad thai at the kitchen island and listening to the wireless. It’s a repeat episode of a murder drama that he remembers hearing last month, but it’s better than silence. He casts a glance at the empty harvest table that he and Harry usually sit at to eat dinner, sized just right for the two of them. He had extracted it from one of the Manor’s more intimate dining rooms, and Harry had argued at first that he didn’t want any of the Manor’s furniture when they moved in together; he’d called it ‘tainted.’
“Shall we?” Draco asked, taking Harry’s arm in his hand. Suddenly unable to make a sound, Harry settled for a brisk nod when Draco gave him a quizzical look, and he felt the lurch of a side-along Apparition as everything went dark.
Robards harrumphed, but he was clearly too taken by the holiday spirit to press the matter. “If you say so,” he said. “I don’t want any overtime this year. No repeats of last year’s budget disasters or Kingsley will have my head.”
“So now where to?” Potter asked.
“Ok,” Harry says. “You’re going to try to make this stool hover with each of these wands. If it works at all, I want you to maintain it and see if the same problem occurs.”
Weasley boggled for a moment, and under normal circumstances Draco would have allowed himself to enjoy it a bit. The other man appeared to pull himself together quickly, however, so at least there was that.
“I don’t get it,” Harry said instead. “Why were you so carefree about working through the holiday? Didn’t you have any plans?”
Harry realized he’d been staring at the paper without actually taking in any of the words. “Make beautiful bowls and cups,” he read out loud. “No experience required. So that
“Harry!” Granger exclaimed. “You didn’t!”
Ron stretched. “I guess that’s something, mate,” he said. “Listen, I’ve got an early morning at the shop tomorrow—George has me coming in at the arse-crack of dawn to unload a big new shipment. If you’ve got your days free now, you could drop by and say hi sometime.”
“Better get on with it, in that case, Potter,” he gasped. “Maybe try skimming instead of reading every word.”
Harry couldn’t help but laugh at that. Malfoy lit a cigarette and took a long, slow drag from it. “I know I should quit,” he said once he had finished blowing a cloud of smoke into the air. “One of these days. Maybe if I go back to school.”
“You can’t help yourself,” Draco whispers as he nuzzles Harry’s earlobe. “You’ve always hated me.”
Potter pouted at him, rutting against him several more times for good measure, but picked up the book again. Draco kept up a steady rhythm by rolling his hips; it was too much fun to observe the way Potter bit his lip when Draco hit just the right angle, when he grabbed Potter’s waist while doing it and ground their bodies together. It was delicious; it was making him uncomfortably hard.
“That’s right,” Blaise said easily, even though there was no way he could have any idea what they were talking about given the noise levels in the pub. “It’s enormous. Women love it, men fear it. Hello there, Harry! Thank you for keeping Ginevra out of trouble.” He sat down in the space that Ginny had just vacated and gave the side of her head a kiss; she punched him gently on the arm.
“You're also really important to me,” Harry says, barrelling onwards. Draco suspects he was semi-rehearsing this conversation in the shower, and possibly catastrophizing about it in the process. “I feel like a fraud saying that, though. I can’t even be here for our anniversary! I can't promise that we can make plans together or that I’ll be around for them. I think… I think that it’s time to acknowledge that.” Harry turns his face back towards Draco, and in the moonlight he looks worried.
He was saved from having to come up with an answer by another knock at the door. Potter frowned. “Not a moment’s peace around here,” he muttered as he went over to open it.
Draco grabbed Potter’s hips as his cock pulled back across Draco’s lips. He held Potter there, the tip of his cock bobbing just beyond the reach of Draco’s mouth, and Potter began to strain against his grip, desperate to continue his interrupted rhythm.
Harry laughed. “Did you charm the windows to show snow falling outside? I’m pretty sure it wasn’t a blizzard when I was just out there.”
“Please, Harry,” Draco says from behind him, and Harry remembers the promise. Anything he wants, once the wand is finished. He starts to apply small grooves to the spinning wand, carelessly sending tiny shavings flying everywhere. He knows this work well—Ollivander was an exacting teacher, and he’s practiced this on dozens of wands on his own since his old teacher retired. Even in his distracted state, he’s confident that he’ll be able to create something as beautiful as Draco, that will serve him well for many years.
“Let’s toast,” Harry announced, several hours later. He had lost the ability to concentrate a good half hour earlier, and in a rash attempt to regain it, he had decided to organise his desk drawer. He had actually uncovered a book on the history of magical creature relations that Hermione had loaned him, and he’d forgotten about entirely, a golden snitch that occasionally made half-hearted attempts to fly away, and a bottle of Ogden’s Finest ‘51 which he’d received for Christmas the previous year.
Harry nodded slowly as they continued to walk down the street. He could understand the reassurance that that could provide, given what Draco had lived through and the way he reacted to the chaos that Harry regularly embraced. “Yeah, I can see why that would be helpful,” he finally said. “Even if it doesn’t really make sense right now. I’m sure you’ll figure it out, though.” He smiled over at Draco in what he hoped was a reassuring manner.
“Good morning,” Malfoy says formally. “As agreed, I have returned three days from our original appointment.”
“I’m just saying, I would have brought my invisibility cloak along if I’d known,” Potter groused. After a furtive look around the library, he stepped over the chain at the entrance to the section; it honestly did very little to keep students out, in Draco’s opinion.
“It’s not what it looks like,” Harry protested. “Ron and Hermione were here earlier and they didn’t take their glasses back to the bar. Those two have been keeping me from going out of my skull with boredom; it’s very decent of them.”
“It looks adequate, I suppose,” Draco allowed. Potter snorted, but Draco ignored it. “Shall we?”
“‘The economic impact alone!’” Harry said, imitating the nasal tones of the president of the Diagon BIA. “‘The streets aren’t safe to travel any more! We’re losing the goodwill of the public!’”
“Mmm, bed sounds good,” Harry murmurs. Draco thinks the late night might be catching up with him by this point, the tiredness overwhelming whatever was going on earlier. Wrapping his towel around him like a protective cloak, Harry is about to leave the bathroom when he pauses in the doorway and looks back at Draco for a moment. “Sorry about the anniversary,” he says quietly.
Draco opened his eyes and found himself in a room that was recognizably Hogwarts. A fire crackled away merrily in the hearth, surrounded by stone walls, while a large solid desk absolutely covered with loose sheaves of parchment sat in the middle of the room; it was otherwise sparsely decorated.
Harry flicked some water at Malfoy; the other man jerked backwards from it, but his smile seemed a bit wider as he looked down at his own wheel again. Harry found himself mirroring it as he started his clay spinning. The morning was going nothing like he had expected; in fact, the whole thing was rather odd, but not in a bad way. Suddenly feeling decisive, he resolved to start with a small bowl. Perhaps things were looking up for him.
Melanie proceeded to explain a surprising number of steps that were involved in making their first piece. First, they were supposed to form a slight cone by applying pressure with their hands just so; this would help seal the base to the wheel. Then they were to practice “coning up” and “coning down”, which seemed to involve forcing the clay to through holes between their fingers in both directions and would help shape and position the clay as needed. After that came “opening up”, where Melanie pressed three of her fingers to the top of the mound of clay, and all the students oohed as a bowl shape gradually appeared in the mound of clay, as if by magic. Finally, she showed them how to “pull a wall”, where she took that bowl shape and squeezed the wide sides to make them narrower, forcing the extra clay to move higher as a result.
“Er,” Harry said. “Sure. Yeah, I’m having a bit of trouble concentrating right now.”
Draco turned around again and looked at Potter. Correction: he looked at where Potter had previously been standing, but the office door was shut once again and the other man was nowhere to be seen. While these changes
“Yes, the box that was sitting right next to me a few minutes ago,” Draco said. He appeared confused.
“I reserve my judgement until afterwards,” Draco said pompously, and Harry couldn’t help but chuckle.
“You’re sure?” Malfoy asks from behind him. He sounds dubious.
“Not at all, not at all,” Arthur said expansively. “Harry, Teddy will be excited that you’re here. He’s off watching the Quidditch with Andromeda; you should go and say hello.”
Draco sniffed. “I may have been… overzealous, earlier,” he allowed, busying himself with unnecessarily straightening the piles of paper on his desk. “I hope my criticisms of bureaucracy do not needlessly complicate our work.”
was practically Harry's speciality. The class was looking more interesting already.
“What is?”
“Oh,” Harry said. “Well.” He cleared his throat. “Obviously, you should do whatever makes you happiest. I’ll be fine.” Impulsively, he stuck out his hand. “It’s been much better than I feared as well. I’d even go so far as to say it has been a pleasure.”
on himself and watched recognition dawn in his husband’s face.
“Oh?” Harry asked, attempting to sound casual. “Sure. What do you want to talk about?”
“Er,” Harry said, realizing that he was staring again. “Well. Next time, then. Don’t let me keep you!” As he turned back to his own paperwork, he saw Draco give him a little curious look and panicked slightly. He hoped he hadn’t overplayed his hand by inviting Draco out, but the fear that Draco suspected kept bouncing around his head as his partner put on his coat and left for the day.
Harry realised that he was just sitting there, smiling like a fool as he watched Draco straighten piles of paper. “You know me,” he said, looking away quickly before Draco noticed. “I always support a good criticism of bureaucracy. How about I go promise our friend in Evidence not to mess up their filing system, and you can figure out which records we need to pull?”
Harry arrived outside the studio fifteen minutes early, still unsure if he was actually going to take Malfoy up on his offer. It wasn’t that he thought Malfoy was going to try and take advantage of an empty studio to get revenge—well, he didn’t
It was mid-afternoon when they arrived at The Burrow. The traditional Christmas Day Quidditch game was underway—as they marched up the path to the front door, they could see the players zooming and dodging through the sky above the back meadow, their whoops and laughter carrying through the crisp winter air.
Draco had to refrain from rolling his eyes; the man was a willfully oblivious fool. “Listen,” he said, as Potter appeared to have every intention of just striding away in a huff. “I am only going to tell you this once, and then I am going to walk away and we don’t ever have to discuss it again.” He took a quick breath before plunging onwards. “I chose my… method… for extracting you from your dream mostly because I was desperate. But also I think we may have been flirting? Earlier in the dream, I mean.” Despite his mother’s loathing of the habit, he found himself biting his lip again. He hated exposing his feelings this way, like some kind of emotional exhibitionist, but there might not be another way to get the message through Potter’s extraordinarily thick skull. “Dreams are strange beasts,” he continued, “so I’m not going to read anything into it. However, here’s my card if you need anything from me in the future.” He grabbed a business card from his coat pocket and handed it to Potter, who stared at him.
A few moments later, a hand appeared in his field of view, steadying the owner against the pew in front of Harry.
“Potter?” Draco asked after a moment. “Have you seen my box?”
“I don’t see anything stopping me,” Draco pointed out.
“It’s literally just
“Not much of a break?” Harry asked. “Hermione, it’s been nothing but break! I’m so bored! There are
“Now, with the application of pressure,” Harry says as he presses the separated wand together, “both halves of the wand should join again without any noticeable weakening.” He gently picks up the whole wand and transfers it to a clamp attached to the side of the work bench, screwing it closed until the wand is rigid and immobile.
Harry handed the paper to Draco. “See for yourself,” he said smugly. It came out far more confidently than Draco was used to hearing from a dreamer.
Behind him, he heard Weasley say quietly, “What is he—” before Granger shushed him.
“I just transferred to Evidence last month,” she said, “And they told me to keep an eye on the archives to make sure that no keen-eyed Aurors come in and mess up the filing system.” She eyed them shrewdly. “So no, I wouldn’t say so.”
“Potter, shove over.” Pansy’s voice came from over his shoulder. He looked behind him and saw her standing next to the booth, looking at him impatiently. He slid towards the booth wall, leaving lots of room for her next to him. Pansy was the only person who regularly called him by his last name without prefixing it with Auror, and he was abruptly reminded that Pansy and Blaise might be able to help him understand the mystery of Malfoy’s sudden reappearance in his life.
Malfoy was looking over the class, his hands in his pockets, when he caught sight of Harry. The polite smile vanished from his face, and his eyes widened briefly before he recomposed himself and turned to the remaining students, pasting that fake smile back in place.
“Never expected to see a Malfoy under our roof,” Bill said. “What a strange world.”
at Draco, but Draco simply blocked it as he swept towards Harry in a vision of righteous wrath, following it up with his own
“No, Potter,” Draco said. “I’m going to tell you all about it; only then will you learn the error of your ways. You can ask whatever you’d like.”
“It’s not working,” he said as Draco approached his chair. He sounded concerned. “Something’s different this time. I still have no idea what’s on the page as I’m reading it, but I’m not remembering any new details, either.”
Harry finally picked out the back of Draco’s head two pews ahead of him, positioned at the far end next to the stone wall. His head was tilted back, and he appeared to be admiring the high vaulted ceilings of the church. Harry followed his gaze and finally allowed himself to take in his surroundings. The building itself was made of walls of beautiful stone blocks, with tall wooden pillars that soared upwards, and the sheer size of the space they were seated in meant that the priest’s words reverberated in a way that Harry found very solemn and impressive. For a moment he felt out of place again, an interloper, but he remembered the grey-haired greeter’s welcome. Clearly, at least one person thought he belonged here, even if he wasn’t sure of it himself.
“Thanks,” Harry said, feeling inexplicably depressed. “You too.”
“What did you get?” Draco demanded, looking interested despite himself.
“I swear, Malfoy, if I get consumed by an evil cloud because I’m too busy making a fucking wish, I’m coming back to haunt you.”
“And do my best to make him uncomfortable enough to wake up, yes,” Draco said impatiently.
The man beckoned him inside. “Are you alone?” he asked.
“Now,” he said, as he stepped in front of Harry, crowding him back against his desk. “Return my box. Your underhanded theft has only delayed my inevitable victory.”
Draco comes to alertness in the middle of a snore. He grimaces, rolls over and adjusts his pillow, and is surprised to find no trace of Harry in his usual spot in the bed. That's when his other senses kick in and he realizes that he can still hear the shower running.
Malfoy eyed him again as if considering how much to say. “After the trials, I had a Muggle society integration specialist as a condition of my parole,” he finally said. “He made me do a bunch of different activities to show that I could be a ‘functioning and contributing member of society.’ One of those was some art classes through the studio here; he knew Melanie, and I guess this place has gained a bit of a reputation as a halfway house for people like me.” He smiled self-deprecatingly. “Anyways, the art was the first thing that really felt right to me, so I kept taking more classes. When Melanie was looking for some help, I volunteered in exchange for studio access.”
To Draco’s surprise, Potter laughed at that. “I’ve slept with men before, you git,” he said. “I’m not a virgin or anything.” He squared his shoulders and looked Draco in the eye, suddenly appearing decisive. “No, if you’ve nothing against the idea, then I think we should give it a go.”
“For a moment…” Draco says, looking back at the wand. “It felt different. But it just feels like the rest now.”
Potter gave a little moan at that, but remained focused on his reading. Draco lay his face against Potter’s warm back and breathed in the scent of him, revelling in the experience. He found that his hips, moving of their own accord, had shifted forward, pressing his own crotch against Potter’s lower back and grinding a bit.
“Yeah, but do you want some?” Harry persisted, smiling. It was always fun to make Draco flustered about small, ordinary things. “I’ll trade you for the other half of your sandwich. You can even have a spring roll if you need a palette cleanser.”
“Not sure when I’ll be home,” the stag says using Harry’s voice. “There was an Auror incident and we keep admitting more patients. Sorry. I’ll make it up to you.”
