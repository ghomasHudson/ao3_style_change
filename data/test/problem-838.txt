Draco can’t sleep this night, so it’s clear that he is in a bad mood the next morning. After he has showered (he stands up extra early to shower) (and he hates coming late) and put on his clothes, he heads to breakfast with Louis. When they pass the room of Potter and Styles, they see a paper, pinned to the door. There’s a sketch of Potter and his new friend, which is rather good, Draco must admit. The paper also has “We are the Harrys” written on it. Draco sighs and ignores it. Potter should leave him alone.
Luckily, he finds his room without any troubles. The other boy hasn’t arrived yet, so he starts decorating the room. The posters, he hangs on the walls are all from Quidditch, a not very famous sport, he played often with Ron and his brothers and sister. Then, there are his books and, of course, Hedwig. Hedwig is his stuffed toy owl; he can’t sleep without her. What at first sounds ridiculous is not very funny, when you think about the fact, that Harry lost his parents when he was three years old. Hedwig is the only thing left from his family. Well, Malfoy used to think it was funny. Harry growls. He shouldn’t think about that prat.
Harry sighs. He would recognize this cold voice everywhere. Harry sees Louis nodding as he and Hazza turn around. “Exactly. It’s your fucking job to make way, you fucking lossaahs.”, Louis says. That’s enough, Harry decides. “Uhm, excuse me? How dare you to talk like this?” Malfoy scoffs. ”How dare you to come to this school?” Hazza cuts in, before they can start a fight. “Umm, we didn’t do anything. If you get up on the wrong side of bed, it isn’t our fault. Calm down, please!” Harry nods in agreement. “Exactly! Just leave us alone!” “Oh, come oooon!” Louis rolls his eyes. “Ohh, now I can totally understand Draco why he hates you so much. You really think it’s a good idea to start an argument with us. You will totally regret your decision but if you like so… never fear! Maybe it also helps you to be better in school because of learning how to write an argument…” he laughs bitterly. Surprisingly, Malfoy doesn’t seem as aggressive as Louis. “Look, these are our seats.”, He says and adds sarcastically: “If you’d be so friendly…” But Harry doesn’t even think about giving up. He knows that he might be overreacting, but Malfoy makes him so very angry, he can’t let him win. “Harry is right. We were here at first, so it’s only fair.”, Hazza helps him. Harry squints at him. How can he be so relaxed? Louis imitates Hazza ironically. He seems as angry as Harry is and Harry can’t say if this makes him sympathetic or even more mean. “Oh, look, how cool I am. I win the prize of coolness…YAYY! We are in the kindergarten now… How lovable!” Malfoy sighs and looks around him. Then he turns to Louis. “Louis… all the seats are taken… And we have only ten minutes left for breakfast; my first lesson is literature!”
Hazza must wait twenty minutes for the next train which gets him to the right university. So, he decides to start reading the book “My Policeman” which is really thrilling. Nevertheless, the waiting period flies away very slowly. After endless waiting the right train finally enters the station and the boy boards his train. During the whole train journey Hazza looks out of the window. All he can see are black wolves and a lot of rain which blocks his view. Consistent with the weather the boy listens to “Wolves” which is a song from the band One Direction. Of course. As is to be expected. When the long train ride is finally over, Hazza hastens to reach Garden High University as close as possible.
Louis doesn’t know why he gives up. Probably, because Draco is his best friend. Not because of the tall guy who calls himself Hazza. (Which Louis finds really childish.) No. He hates him. Styles is too positive, has too much friendly energy. He’d probably be nice to his own math-teacher, just because he likes it to be nice. Louis hates math. And he hates his math teacher. He hates most of his teachers. Except his music teacher, she is okay. Styles interrupts his thoughts with an unnecessary and annoying question. If Louis didn’t know him only for a few hours, he’d say, it’s a typical-Styles-question. “So, what’s your first lesson?” Louis answers in the only way, he knows. With an angry tone. “What is your intention with this unnecessary question? Hopefully, I don’t have any lessons with you, otherwise I will literally pass away… But if you’re sooo interested in my life. Fine, my lesson is biology. Arrgh! I hate it.” Styles chuckles. Louis hates it when other people chuckle. But Styles… well, he’s just the type who does this. So, Louis just narrows his eyebrows. “What?” “Oh, Louis! I'm afraid, I have to burst your little bubble, but I also have math now. But I really understand you. I hate Biology, too. Really, why can’t it solve the problems itself?” Louis must admit, that Styles is an interesting interlocuter. So, why not play along? He deeply looks in Styles eyes and answers: “You have really a bad sense of humor, Styles.” But Styles just chuckles again and looks away. His cheeks turn pink.
Blond, tall and very, very beautiful. (That’s a fact. Draco Malfoy is beautiful; Harry did not think this as a compliment!)
He looks around, Styles isn’t there. But Harry is finished with his part of the bedroom, so he goes outside the room and decides to search for his roommate. Hopefully, he’s nice. There’s a short guy with brown hair and he seems nice, so Harry goes to him.
Harry doesn’t really know what to think when he stands in front of the University. In fact, it’s a castle, huge and glamorous and very, very posh. Back at home, there weren’t such castles. There weren’t universities either. Only small schools for small children. Well, he doesn’t know, if he could
Soaking up the atmosphere between Louis and Draco for sure you are wondering about their relationship and at that moment your only question is: “Why is Draco Louis’ best friend?”
The alarm clock plays a shitty, annoying sound. Fuck. Louis hates everything. Why can’t he sleep till noon? When the boy is looking out of the window, he cannot see anything – wow. What a smart conclusion, it is still dark. He shakes his head because of that stupid thought. But the boy must defend himself: It is morning, and he hates mornings. That is why he decides that it is a good idea to stay still in bed for a while. Shit! Ouch! That hurts. Suddenly a shoe lands on his head and a loud voice says “Fuck you. Can’t you get up early on time?! Only one time!” Oh, that is a familiar voice. Tiredly, Louis looks at the direction where that sound has come from. That is Draco. His best friend. Hey, Louis really must admit that it is morning and at this time his brain cannot work so quickly. A glance at his watch shows that Draco and he have only 15 minutes left to eat. Then the hall for breakfast will close. What a great start! Again! It is the second day in college this year and everything goes wrong. How can Draco and he get it till breakfast? Okay to correct, how can Louis get it till breakfast because Draco is already dressed up. So how should he get it? As quickly as the boy can, Louis stands up and searches for something to wear in his suitcase. Yes, he must admit that he still must unpack everything. But why does the boy think about that when there are more important things to think about? For example, what should he wear? As there is not much time left, the boy decides not to take a shower. Shit. On the first day in college without a shower, what a brilliant morning. He takes the first T-shirt that he could find in his full suitcase. It is a black T-shirt with wise words on it, namely “Don’t go to college if you want to learn something for your life.” He really must laugh because this T-shirt has been bought by my little sister Lottie as a present for college. He does not think about this message and if it may cause any trouble… Furthermore, he puts on a black skinny pair of jeans. A look in the mirror shows: “Louis, you look like you had a fight with spiderman in the morning and you have lost it. Of course, no one can win against spiderman. He is the superhero of the superheroes. With a relieved sigh Louis turns towards Draco who has waited patiently. Draco laughs: “Wow. You are very brave. This T-shirt screams “I don’t want to be here!”. But now let’s go, because we haven’t got much time anymore.” Together they sprint to the breakfast hall. Oh my god! For how long hasn’t Louis done any workout? For sure, for years because his legs hurt like hell. When they arrive in the hall for eating there is not any empty chair left to sit down. Fuck. What a terrible morning! Everything, really everything goes wrong. But suddenly Draco notices: “Hey, Louis Pouis, look over there! Harold and Herayy are sitting there! Let’s go and say hello to these shitty faces!” – Oh, that sounds good. Like Hazza’s voice… But Louis forgets to answer Draco because he is completely caught by Hazza’s look. He wears a white T-shirt with – he thinks – a print of “One Direction”. Wow. He has a fantastic taste in music. Louis shakes his head because he wonders why he does think about him. He is an absolutely asshole if he is Harry’s friend. Like Draco always uses to say. Louis is really thinking about irrelevant and unnecessary things. That is why the boy does not notice that Draco walks directly towards the table. Fuck. How should Louis behave? What should he do? Should he be cool or should he be funny by telling jokes or should he be mean and make a bitchy comment about Hazza’s outfit? Oh, dear. Why does he even think about that? He decides to do the latter. That is why Louis comments Hazza’s outfit when he arrives at his table: “Oh, I hope you like Zombies! Because when you look in the mirror, you will see one!” As an answer Hazza only rolls his eyes and replies: “Oh. Good morning Louis. That’s a really polite and encouraging comment. Thank you. But I must admit that I really like Zombies, so I like me, too. So, I’m in fact happy about your nice compliment.” Oh, actually Louis loves his sense of humour. Then both, namely Draco and Louis, sit down next to the Harrys. There are only four minutes left until the hall will close. Shit. Louis is so hungry. So, he only quickly takes one bowl with cornflakes that looks like old rubbish. One spoon of this kind of food is enough to realize that these cornflakes taste like paper. Yummy. How should he survive this day? Hazza, Harry and Draco talk together but Louis almost falls asleep. That is why he barely says a word and stares angrily at the rubbish in the bowl which does not deserve the name “Cornflakes”. That is like you get mixed up cats for dogs. The clock hits 7:45. Wow. Breakfast is over. Louis is still as hungry as a horse and he cannot eat one more spoon of the bowl with cornflakes, but a better word for them is in fact paper. Oh, no! A look at the timetable says that he has got maths. Oh, fuck! He is going to have Mrs. Gorgia. No, she is not gorgeous at all. She is the devil herself. That is why Draco and he gave her the famous nickname “DEVILia”. Louis hates her from the bottom of his heart. Now, he must go to the new building where the math room is located. Shit. Only five minutes left until the lesson will start and it is such a long way. On top of that he has Mrs. Devilia. Argh! He is sick when he hears her name. Suddenly Louis notices Hazza’s voice: “Hey, Louis! Have we maths together? Should we go together to the maths room?” Oh, no! Hazza. That is what he is missing the most in that moment. A glance at Draco is enough for him because he has a big, wide smile on his face. This smile shows happiness about the whole situation.
Draco pinched the bridge, “How exactly did you save the world? You act like a bloody child all the time!”
“So, if you wanted to apologize to someone, and they kinda hate you now, how would you go about doing it?”
Harry scrambled up off the floor and brushed himself off. “Yes. Ummm, I thought I heard shouts in there. Has Draco…” he couldn’t bring himself to finish the sentence.
“And the death, and the screams. My parents… Voldemort… the dungeon… Death Eaters… My- my dad, he just let them… he just let them do whatever they wanted to me.”
The days went by and they hadn’t found anything that they could use. It all led to dead ends. But, on the plus side, Draco was getting used to Potter’s company. Even enjoying it dare say.
When Draco and Harry reached the room they were painting (the den), they found that Cosmo and Coco had already covered the floor with an old sheet.
“Well, I'll let you know that no son of mine will do anything with a boy.” Lucius spat the words with venom.
Harry put a comforting hand on his shoulder, “I know how you must feel. But they forgave you long ago. When I told them that you’d changed. And anyone who I think is okay, they’ll be okay with. The only person who might be a little icy toward you is George, but that’s understandable right?”
The boggart promptly shrunk down to the size of an ant and turned bright pink. Harry picked it up and slammed it into a drawer. Then he said a couple of spells and it was locked in there tight.
“We could Apparate over there right now! You're on to something, this is why I like being your partner.”
Molly gave him a small smile and Draco knew he had been forgiven. He also knew he had to apologize to Arthur as well.
Harry’s shoulders were shaking and his face was in his hands. He looked so vulnerable that Draco thought he might make something explode from pity. Instead he did something that his younger self would have cursed him for: He wrapped his shaking arms around Harry Potter and pulled him closer.
Draco pointedly turned away and started working on the wards again. Harry didn’t bother him after that.
So Draco pretended to not see it as Harry shot forward. He slowly reacted, spinning around and watching Harry speed toward it. At the last possible moment the snitch farted away, causing Harry to give chase. Draco joined him, knowing that if he waited too long it would look suspicious.
“Sorry.” I mumble, not looking up. I try to edge my way around the person, but thin pale fingers wrap around my wrist.
A gash appeared in his left arm right on top of the Dark Mark. And he found that he didn't care. He didn't care that there was blood dripping from his arm. He didn't care. He needed to feel pain.
Ron gasped, “Scratches my arse! Harry these aren't just scratches. We can see the blood coming through.”
Weasley turned around and spotted Draco. For the first time ever didn’t glare. Instead he rubbed the back of his neck and said, “Look Malfoy, Harry’s right. I’m sorry. I guess family feuds got in the way of my common sense. Let’s start over.”
Draco’s eyes were staring to look wet, the tears magnifying all of the different colors swirling amounts the grey. I smile up at him, “Who knew you were such a poetic sap?”
Some of the students probably knew that something was up, too. By the time Easter rolled around, Harry was caught brushing his hand over Draco’s bum in the corridors. Hermione got the ‘I knew it’ look, and Ron just looked surprised and slightly disgusted.
He looked at her hesitantly, thinking she would be livid. But instead she had a thoughtful look on her face.
I can barely hear what Malfoy is saying. Because I’m panicking. We’re going to be trapped in here. In a tiny closet. And it’s all my fault. Memories come flashing back.
Oddly enough, Harry seemed even more disappointed than him. “Yeah,” he agreed, “Yeah. But I hope we can still be friends at least.”
“It’s not as if I don’t like this girl. I do. But as a friend. She- she can be a bit manipulative at times though. I fear that I will end up not happy with her. My father is convinced that she will be a good match. Except the more I think about it the more I know that I *don’t* want to be with her. But, if I refuse to marry her, I’ll get disowned. I really couldn’t care less about the family fortune, but there are rules and charms that bind me to the Malfoy name. If I don’t marry this girl, I won’t be able to contact my family again. And I couldn’t do that to my mother after everything she’s done for me. And the only way to not marry her, is to get my parents to undo the bond.”
Hermione took out her wand, “Enough of this bullshit!” She waved it once and the bandages disappeared.
At this point Harry looked like he was getting uncomfortable. So (to Draco's relief) he jumped in before Narcissa could go crazy: “Mrs. Malfoy? Mrs. Malfoy, we have discovered that your Manor could be a possible place for the next time the Turner is used.”
Everyone in the common room looked like they would much rather live in a trash can. But they agreed grudgingly, cause everyone knew: when Hermione put her mind to something, there’s nothing you can do to stop her.
Harry shot up, breathing hard, sweat making his clothes stick to him, his eyes wide open. He was gripping the sheets in his fists so hard that he could feel his knuckles start to get sore.
“I know Ron! But he doesn’t need to treat us like shit. He’s been acting this way since the battle.”
Quinn is a fellow 6th year. They transferred to Hogwarts last year. They're from France, but something happened at Beauxbatons. They still won’t talk about it.
Ron smirked too, “All right. But you two better be together by the time we get back, cause I’m not doing this for nothing.”
He heard the dorm door creak open. He peaked out of the bathroom and saw Malfoy coming in with a tray of breakfast food. When he saw Harry in the bathroom he stopped dead.
“You know,” Draco says breathlessly, “I’ve always wondered why you never took my handshake in first year.”
Draco looked at him in shock, “You feel guilty? Potter, you literally saved the entire wizarding world! How can you feel guilty?”
“I mean, I’ve been nothing but a dick (excuse my vulgar language) to you for your entire life. Let alone what happened during the war, and here you show up and are being all nice to me. It’s just confusing.”
Harry glanced up and down the hall, but saw nothing. He knew he wouldn’t fall back asleep any time soon, so he decided to take a stroll through the Manor.
After several painstaking minutes Harry had stopped crying, and was looking at Draco. “You might not like me asking, but why is your boggart your dad?”
“Hermione, Ron, I’m really, really sorry. I’ve been an absolute dick for the past two years. I know that there’s nothing I can say to make up for it. Nothing I can say to excuse it. I push people away, people that are trying to help. Like you two. I know that you care about me so much, and it took me so long to realize that. It took me two fucking years!”
Draco held out his arm, Harry took it, and then they were whirling through time and space. The wormhole of the Wizarding World.
He just lay there eyes wide staring at the ceiling. Until he heard soft footsteps in the corridor. Narcissa opened his door.
Harry nodded numbly and tried to think of a happy memory. It was hard, but the one he chose was of him and Draco on the tree that one fateful night. “Expecto Patronum.”
Then a smirk slowly crossed his face as he said, “I think I can choose the wrong sort for myself thanks.”
Harry spoke up beside him, “Will everything be okay now?” His voice sounded a little fearful, and Draco guessed what he was refusing to.
I breathe a sigh of relief when the dark tunnel floods with light. But my head snaps around when I hear the witch's hump slide open again. I turn out my wand light and press myself against a wall.
Draco watched him go, thoroughly uninterested, and not at all surprised at the less than warm welcome.
Draco didn’t say anything. He just sighed, pulled Harry up on the bed and kissed him as if his life depended on it.
“Tu es un putain d'idiot parfois! Comment Granger et Weasley vous soutiennent-ils? Espèce de petite merde! Qu'aurais-je fait si je t'avais trouvé mort à terre à deux heures du matin! Pourquoi voudriez-vous couper? POURQUOI VOULEZ-VOUS COUPER!”
“It said to RSVP a day ago!” Lucius spat, “I assume you're going. So I can just take that back.” Lucius reached for the letter, but Draco held it to his chest.
When it got to Lavender she started smirking. She turned to the girl beside her. “Parvati. Truth or Dare?”
From there he climbed the steep steps even higher. He paused as he passed a scorch mark on the wall. He lifted a hand up to it, and remembered all those years ago when he climbed all the way up here with a tiny dragon in a crate.
Harry then pulled out a collapsible wizard chess set from inside his robes. “Do you wanna play?” He asked hesitantly, adjusting his glasses.
That just made Harry crack up more. Once he had recovered from his momentary laughing seizure he turned to Ron.
His face was dirty, his clothes were ripped and his hair was very, very, long. But big clumps were missing as if someone had ripped them out. But the thing was, all of the other people Draco had seen coming out of Azkaban all looked tired. His father on the other hand had no dark circles under his eyes, he wasn’t gaunt. He was thin but not in a starved way. All in all he looked like he had been out of the wizard prison for a while.
Draco looked around, he had never been to this part of the wizarding town and was rather intrigued by the small building in front of him. It seemed like a cozy spot to spend a date, a rosy glow was lighting the windows in the semi-dark night.
When he pushed open the Potions door everyone turned to look at him. Well almost everyone. Malfoy had his gaze firmly fixed to the chalkboard.
“Ha!” He yelled, flying towards the ground. Harry landed and stuck out his tongue at Draco. “Who’s a toddler now?”
By the time Harry was finished, Draco was shaking with rage. How dare they do something like that! How dare they treat Harry like that! Not giving him food for a week! Harry was being abused and he didn't even know it! Dudley deserves the Curses set on him!
“Well, I just don’t know who’s transphobic and who’s not.” Harry said defiantly, he wasn’t going to tolerate homophobic teachers as well as students. “That girl had a right to be treated as a human, and I was not about to stand by and let her be bullied by a bunch of brainless scumbags.”
“Welcome back to a new year at Hogwarts! I would like to remind everyone that the Forbidden Forest is /off limits!/ I think some of our older students should be reminded of that. Mr. Filch has posted the full set of rules on his door, and would like me to remind everyone that products from Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes are strictly prohibited. Heaven knows that you all will probably find a way to sneak them in anyway.”
But as Malfoy swung onto the back of his broom a flaming Griffin fastened it’s claws around the blonde and pulled him back into the raging flames. The last thing Harry saw was his petrified face as the flames swallowed him whole. Then he was gone.*
It was Harry’s whisper of: “No… NO… not Cedric, PLEASE not Cedric!” That made Draco spring into action.
“Yeah well.” Harry scratched the back of his neck uncomfortably, “I guess I've just never had a chance to. With all of the saving the world business, I didn’t have time to be a proper horny teenager.”
Draco handed Harry the lily he had picked earlier. It was still dancing elegantly in his hand. The smaller man smiled softly. “I love you.” He whispered.
“Draco! I’m so glad you're okay!” She exclaimed, springing up and wrapping her arms around the taller man.
“Dudley was rocking the platform so hard that I think I stopped the ride. It just shut down. And Dudley wasn't able to rock it anymore. I think that was the first time I ever used magic and didn't know about it.
Harry nodded his approval. “Alright. Expecto Patronum.” They both expected a silver stag to burst forth, but, to both of their surprises, a small twisting dragon flowed from the tip of his wand.
That's how Pansy, Theodore Knott and Tracy Davis joined the D.A. We didn’t trust anyone else though. We thought they might rat to the Slytherin Prince: Malfoy. But Pansy, Theo and Tracy kept their word. Even though they were pretty tight with Malfoy.
As the Healer walked away Harry felt as if the world was closing in on him. The walls of St. Mungo’s suddenly felt too big and too close. His chest seized and he fell to the floor. It was only when Ron and Hermione came running down the corridor that he got up.*
He hadn’t even told Ron and Hermione. Even back in fourth year when the problem first arose. At first he thought he was looking at Cho during the Yule Ball. But it could have been Cedric as well.
Voldemort pulled out of his mind. Draco’s whole body was aching. Although it was only Draco’s mind that Voldemort penetrated.
When they reached the top of the stairs Harry set down his bag and pulled out his Transfiguration essay.
Draco knew that his mother wouldn’t be at this hour. He could get away with murder. Not that he would have the guts to actually take someone's life.
Harry cut a slice for each of them. He was almost smiling too much to eat it. He finally had his best friends back.
He exploded, “YOU CAN STOP YOUR HEROICS POTTER! I DON’T NEED YOUR HELP, AND STOP GUESSING WHY I DON’T WANT TO DO IT! HAVE YOU EVER CONSIDERED THAT MAYBE IT’S BECAUSE I DON’T HAVE A SINGLE POWERFUL HAPPY MEMORY?”
Draco experimentally slid his tongue into Harry's mouth. He felt hands dig into his back, and Harry groaned in satisfaction.
Draco felt a searing pain in his stomach, but nothing more. The Time-Turner gave a feeble twitch, but it was obviously affected.
He heard the blonde sigh, exasperated, “You know exactly what I mean. Do you or do you not, have a crush on me?”
Harry nodded and Ginny got up and they walked out of the Gryffindor common room. He followed her outside and they sat by the lake watching the sun set. It would have been romantic if this were any other time.
“Who put you in charge.” I grumble, “And why would we need brooms, I'm sure a closet isn't that big.”
“Harry. I did expect you to come and talk to us on the train though. If not me and Neville at least Ginny.”
Draco nodded a little confused. Arthur had every right to be upset with him. He opened his mouth to formally apologize, but Arthur had already rejoined the celebrations.
Draco didn’t hesitate, he took off down the long corridors and practically threw himself down the staircases. Harry was close on his tail.
“/Wow!/” Harry said, adding his whole supply of sarcasm to his voice, “/I’m so impressed! Einstein could never!/”
“I also have a giant poster of your face above my bed, so that you’re the first thing I see when I wake up, and the last thing I see when I go to sleep! There’s also a picture of you on my pillow, so I can kiss you goodnight.”
They sat there in the uncomfortable silence. And Draco’s heart was silently breaking for the man next to him. Harry seemed so unhappy, and he was the one that deserved the most happiness in the world. He didn’t know what to do to help, so instead he just said what was on his mind.
Harry and Hazza are in the cafeteria, laughing about some bad joke and eating. They don’t see Draco and Louis walking in and angry starring at them. “Hazza, could you pass me the orange juice please?”, asks Harry and smiled as Hazza gives him the bottle. “How was your night? How have you slept in the new environment?”, Hazza sounds friendly and caring and Harry is happy that they found each other. Hazza is a good friend.
On the other side of the table, Draco rolls his eyes. He doesn’t want to answer Styles’ question, but when Louis and Hazza start to talk, he feels kind of bored. (Also, he looks in Potter’s direction and really wants to tease him.) (And maybe talk to him.) (But not in a friendly way.) (Of course not!) (Whatever.) He grumbles. “As I said, literature.” Potter laughs, while Draco yawns. He hates waking up that early. “Wow! While you three die in those classrooms, I’ll be on the soccer-field!”, says Potter, grinning. Draco sighs. “Dear god, this energy…”, he says more to himself, but Potter hears it and sighs. But then, instead of getting mad, he just laughs again. “So, you’re still a literature freak?” Draco didn’t see that coming. He didn’t ever mention this to Potter. He must have figured it out by himself. Draco blinks. Why does that make him so happy? But Draco wouldn’t be Draco, if he’d be nice to Harry Potter. “Freak? I wouldn’t say that, since I’m the one with the better grades.” After breakfast, they really have to hurry. Draco rushes in the (one😉) direction of literature class. Louis sighs and follows Styles to biology. And Harry, well, Harry heads to the soccer field.
Harry raises an eyebrow. Malfoy speaks about him with his friends? He swallows. He shouldn’t feel good about that. He’s sure that they laugh at him. Malfoy would never say nice things about him. Still, he can’t oppress the strange feeling that he is happy about it.
Hazza’s alarm clock starts playing the song “Love You Goodbye” from his favourite band called One Direction. Immediately the boy wakes up with a big stupid smile on his face. Today is that special day. He can finally leave home. But wait... Can you really call that ugly and stupid place home? No, of course not. The alarm clock still plays the song but Hazza isn’t bothered. That song sounds so familiar to him but also so far from reality of his daily life. The boy will never dare to associate the words love and his family. That would be absolutely nonsense. His only wish in life is to say goodbye to this stupid place where all the bad things happened in his past life. He wants to forget about his terrible childhood, his non-existent family and all the dump shit that was part of his earlier life. After these deep thoughts Hazza presses the button of the alarm clock to stop the song. Then the boy decides that it’s time to stand up and pack all the useful things for Garden High University. After he thinks of the word Garden High University his face lights up and he’s in a very good mood. That’s why his mood doesn’t even change when he notices the raindrops that flow down the windowpane in every direction (not ONE direction 😊). Hazza lets out a happy noise because he still can’t believe that he will be at university today. TODAY. Wow, the boy won’t never see this place again. One look at his watch shows how quickly time has passed...
Hermione hesitated before speaking. “Wow Draco. I do not envy your position right now. Here's my advice: See how this case goes. I know what it’s like to lose connection with parents. My family was in Australia for a year before I found them again. That’s a story for another time. I think if you really think about it, you’ll find a way around this. And about Harry, if you really wanted to ‘shoot your shot,’ the best time to do it would be during this case.”
If you're wondering how exactly Harry was in this situation, it’s simple. Denis Creevey had taken up his brother’s photography skills. He’d followed Harry and Ginny that night and taken magical picture after magical picture of their fight. And then he had gone straight to the Daily Prophet. (He was going to be the next generation’s Reta Skeeter.) The next morning Harry had gone down to breakfast to discover a peck of owls on the Gryffindor table. Needless to say their owners had given them orders to peck him senseless until he read their hate mail.
I turn my head to the window, I just wish that Occlumency worked with things outside your mind too. I wonder if Snape would teach me that. It's not likely.
Draco looked at Harry and slowly nodded, “There are certain rules, but that might work… I was thinking about it, but with my reputation I can’t do any of them.” He spat bitterly, “The Ministry would have me shipped off to Azkaban the second I even suggested the thought of doing it. But you being the Golden Boy, you can do anything, and the Ministry would still be kissing your arse.”
He turned back around to see the girl step out of the alcove, but in front of her stood three older sixth years. They looked like they were cornering her.
Harry suddenly felt a hot ball of anger at the pit of his stomach. Why was Malfoy prying in his personal business anyway?
I stare at her in shock as Quinn says, “We all placed bets! And I won. I got it right to the day! All of you pay up.”
“Oh here we go…” Bill muttered. “Honestly, I still don’t get why you and Percy aren’t an item. You would keep each other busy all day with your speeches.”
Harry smiled and turned to his own pile of presents. He opened them one by one, Bill had gotten him a miniature replica of the Sword of Gryffindor, Charlie and Ginny had pooled their money, and gotten him a brand new pair of dragon hide work gloves.
Harry’s face fell, “I have, actually.” His voice was soft and full of pain. Draco instantly wanted to curl up and hug him. “That time at the Ministry… I um, I wanted to save Sirius. But I ended up getting him killed.”
Draco sat softly beside him, wondering what to do. Luckily, Harry acted first. He threw his arms around the blonde, burying his face in Draco’s shoulder.
Ron looked just as confused as he said: “I’ll do the first one: Never have I ever snuck into the Forbidden Forest.”
Hermione nodded and said mischievously, “I might have to tell Ron that you fancy Harry, but don’t worry. Your secret's safe with me.”
“I don’t care! Hermione, do you really think I’m going to ask out someone who’s engaged? I’m not that stupid.”
Draco pinched the bridge of his nose and shook his head, “Oh Merlin’s fucking tits, that was so long ago.”
Draco shook his head, “No. Since I am a former Death Eater I should be the one to wear it because if I did the spells, I would be shipped off to Azkaban.”
“We forgive you.” He said, and Hermione nodded. Harry could tell that she was getting emotional as well.
This time Harry didn't ask Draco to do the enchantments. Just gave a slight nod indicating that they were about to move on. He seemed to have already made the connection in his head.
They appeared right outside of the Manor doors. Harry looked around in confusion. “I thought there were Anti-Apparition spells.” He said.
The Wizengamot had believed him (of course) because he was the world's Golden Boy. That’s how Draco ended up still living, although every day he thought about ending it all.
“Why so tense Potter? My father and I have a bet you see, I don’t think you're going to last ten minutes in this Tournament. He disagrees. He thinks you won't last five!”
Once Harry was sitting on the top most branch he called down, “Hey Draco! Come up! It’s beautiful! Or, are you too scared?”
“Sorry!” Harry said, bending down to pick up the person’s book. As he stood back up, he realized he was face to face with Draco.
With that Harry grabbed Draco’s arm and pulled him into side-along Apparition. Before he knew it Draco was zooming through the wormhole of the wizarding world.
“Or what? You’ll run to daddy?” Harry had no idea what pushed him to do so, but he wanted to rile Malfoy up. Get him to react.
Harry furrowed his eyebrows, confused, but followed Neville out of the common room anyway. Neville led him down the corridor and into the library.
Draco ran over to it and untangled its wings. Harry then realized who it was, “It’s Errol!” He gasped. He too ran over, “How is he still alive?”
Suddenly feeling very courageous, he leaned down to whisper into Harry’s ear. “You’d better not tell Granger.” He growled. “Or I might have to punish you.”
Narcissa knitted her eyebrows, “Do you really think that I want you to produce an heir? Draco, I just want you to be happy.”
“Are you alright!” Harry panicked, “I’m so sorry! I should not have let you convince me to do that! You complete idiot! You could have gotten seriously hurt!”
Harry sighed, “Look Malfoy, I know we formally started over, but can we really start over? Forget the past and all that. Move on?”
Harry stared at Draco lying in the bed before conjuring a chair. Not a big fluffy one like Dumbledore had used at his trial. His was simpler. But it still had a little padding. He sat down. There were so many things to say in such a little amount of time. And there was one thing in particular that he wanted to say before the Hospital closed. So he just said them all.
Harry’s face turned even more red and he said, “I was just trying to be considerate and bring you coffee. But you’ve made me spill it.”
Then Lucius disappeared, leaving Draco to collapse in Harry’s arms one more. He started softly sobbing into Harry's shoulder. How they made it to the couch, he wasn't sure.
“Draco? Draco can you hear me?” He asked anxiously. Draco didn’t respond so he placed a hand on the blonde’s shoulder. To Harry's relief he flinched.
Draco cleared his throat, “Umm… yes. I was just heading back inside.” He put a hand on the doorknob and tried to open it. It was locked. He glared at Granger. It was obviously one of her spells, and unfortunately Draco had left his wand in the pub. A stupid move on his part.
Lauren glared at him, “Pshh! You have no right to tell me what to do, Death Eater. Yeah, Americans know all about you.”
“It’s a game called Never Have I Ever. I’ll explain how to play: So everyone has a Refilling spell set on their glasses. Someone will make a statement such as: Never have I ever been hit by a car. If that statement does not apply to you that you take a shot. If it does apply to you then you can leave your glass. A fair warning: The glasses have been spelled. So if you're lying about something your drink will turn orange. Are we all clear about the rules.”
He burst into tears, and Draco went rigid. This was not his intent, he had just wanted to tell the truth and now he had made Harry cry. Oh, fuck him!
Harry didn’t seem to notice though. He was already walking towards the strangely foreboding shack. He reached up and pushed open the creaking door.
I sigh recognizing the voice. I look up and glare and Malfoy. “What do you want. If you’ve came to hurl insaults any one of us then fuck off.”
Harry nodded and they got a pile of small rocks from the bucket of Vanishing objects Professor Sadder had put out.
Draco shook his head trying to organize his thoughts, ‘Did you ever actually hate him?’ He argued with himself, ‘Maybe you were just jealous.’
Malfoy was sitting in a ball in the corner with his head in his arms. As soon as he heard his name his head shot up.
Malfoy’s cheeks tinge red, but he turns back to Hermione, takes a deep breath and asks, “Will you help me with the Arithmancy homework. I’ve asked everyone else I know and no one seems to be able to crack it. And I know you are an exceptional student. So I would be honored if you were to help me.”
“I get what you mean.” Harry mumbled, “I hid in my room after the war for months. I didn’t come out, I didn’t talk to anyone, the only living thing I saw was Kreacher. I just couldn’t forgive myself, all those innocent people had to die because I wasn’t fast enough.
It was silent as they started to make the wards, it took all day as the Manor was so big. At one point Draco saw one of the peacocks and remembered that fateful day as a child:
Quinn really made a bang, so I invited them to join the D.A. They agreed. Eventually they started dating Pansy Parkinson. Most of the D.A. Wanted to kick the redhead out, but Quinn stood their ground and said, “Why are we discriminating against Slytherins? I know several decent people from that house! Some of them would love to join!”
Draco truly is the one person who keeps me grounded. He’s like a rock, always present in my life. Always there with a snide remark, or a teasing look. I know that one day everything might change. But I really don’t want to think about that. I just want to be free to live in the moment.
Harry blinked. He’d never really thought about it that way. A memory came back to him from the night he wanted to run away from the Burrow…
Draco sighed, he was getting more and more annoyed by the second, “I don’t need your schooling Potter. Can we please just get back to the wards?”
He took it and unwrapped it. But when he saw what was in it he gasped and almost dropped it. Harry scooted over from his side of the couch and he too gasped in surprise.
He tried desperately to steady his breathing; darkness was clouding his vision. He lifted his wand, and whispered a spell.
“Don't worry. I won’t break his heart. I’ll be nice in my letter!” He waved said letter over his shoulder, and heard Harry smack his head on the wall. Draco laughed; he knew exactly how to get under Harry’s skin.
Draco let out a frustrated sigh. “Try harder! It’s obviously affected, maybe the culprit was able to torture it into submission.”
Harry’s eyes flew open, he was breathing hard and clutching the sheets on his bed. He took several deep breaths in order to calm his racing heart.
Harry was running alongside the carriage trying to keep up. The threastals would /not/ slow down. He heaved his trunk and threw it at Ron, but not before tripping and face planting in the mud. He heard the thump of his trunk as it missed Ron’s outstretched hands, and the carriage sped away.
There’s a small corridor that leads from the entrance hall to the Great Hall, so when Filch is walking down there I run for it.
Harry handed him the thin folder. “Still don't know why we need them. There's nothing in there anyway.”
I get to work spraying the Slugs and bringing them to the edge of the Forest. At most I can carry three, I tried to lift four once, but ended up with a mouth full of mud.
Draco, of course, couldn’t back down from a challenge. So he grabbed the lowest branch and hoisted himself up. It wasn’t hard getting up to the top, but the tree was swaying dangerously. Then he had to remind himself yet again that he was a wizard. He whispered a spell that made the tree extra sturdy and finally joined Harry on the same branch.
Harry sighs in relief, knowing that someone will support him in whatever decision he makes, is helpful.
I’m about ready to punch him. “Either you tell me why I’m here or I hex your balls off!” I pull out my wand and point it at him. But it flies out of my hand. It’s an impressive display of wandless magic, and only in our fifth year.
They worked in silence most of the time, occasionally asking a question. It wasn’t until Harry caught Malfoy staring at him did they have a real conversation.
By the time Malfoy was finished with his rant, Harry was looking at him wide eyed. Malfoy sighed and seemed to gain more control over his temper, “Let me translate that for you: What the hell were you thinking? What would I have told Granger and Weasley? Do they know that you cut? Have you told them? Have they seen the other scars?”
“I-I’m sorry. I uhhhh, I have to go.” With that Draco jumped down from the tree and vanished on the spot.
On one hand he didn’t want to stay at Grimmauld Place any longer than he had to. It brought back too many bad memories. He was only staying there because Ron and Hermione were, and he had nowhere else to go. They had been there since the end of the war, and quite frankly he was getting sick of it.
Ginny leaned over, apparently hearing their conversation, “Harry’s part of the family anyway. Mum'll be fine. She’ll just have to accept the fact that Harry and I broke up.”
But a fair warning: There is self harm in this chapter. If you are uncomfortable with those scenes, and they trigger you, you’d better not read this chapter.
Harry remembered Dumbledor slumped over his desk as his hand blackened. “No!” He said violently, “There must be something you can do!”
But he’s Draco Malfoy, the person who practically lives off of my misery. But here he is not teasing me about my panic attack. It’s upside down. And earlier I heard him say: fuck you to Snape. What the hell is going on? It’s suspicious behavior.
“Do you have a crush on me? Because Granger wouldn’t say that unless she had a real reason to. So do you have a crush on me?”
He saw Draco’s whole body tense up, and thought he might have gone too far. But Draco relaxed and looked down at his drink.
By the time we were done it was almost dusk. We were covered in sweat and slime and mud. But the work is exhilarating, and it helps me take my mind off certain things.
He swung his legs over the bed and felt his feet hit the cold wood floor. He looked down and noticed that he was still wearing his clothes from the day before. He quickly transfigured them to be a little more suitable.
“I just wanted to say that I missed you.” Draco’s eyes were soft, and he was wearing a sweet smile. A genuine smile.
“Well, I like to come here a lot. Especially to think. This tree, it was grown for Cedric.” Harry hesitated, “Even after all of the death in the battle, Cedric’s is still the one I feel most guilty about.”
“And where have you been?” Hermione said with her hands on her hips, looking remarkably like Mrs. Weasley.
Harry gave a start, and turned to the man beside him. He took in the blonde’s figure carefully. The Slytherin stood on the very edge gazing down, posture relaxed. A look of longing in his eyes. Harry wondered whether or not he knew who he was with.
Oddly enough Draco wasn’t revolted. He relaxed and wrapped his arms around Harry and pulled him in close. A rather Gryffindor move in his opinion.
“The Fallen Fifty wouldn't have fallen, if I had just been faster. Fred, Tonks, Lupin, Dobby, Hedwig, Mad-eye, even Cedric. They would all still be alive if I had been faster.”
“‘Cause my high hopes are getting low, because these people are so old. The way they think about it all, if I tried I would never know. My high hopes are getting low but I know I’ll never be alone.”
He laid the rocks out in a line on the desk and they managed to Vanish them all quite successfully. Without Vanishing the desk like last time.
Harry suddenly realized that he had forgotten to get Draco a present. So when he sat back down Harry announced, “I did not forget to get my boyfriend a present. I just… well never mind, here it is.”
Harry watched Malfoy stalk out of the room. Then he turned over onto his stomach and tried to sleep, knowing that none would come.
Harry sighed, “You felt two different magic signatures right? And you said that one of them felt like mine?”
Ginny poked him. “Admit it. You guys were overly obsessed with each other. You both went out of your way to notice each other across the Great Hall. The Slytherin and Gryffindor tables are on opposite sides!”
Harry’s magic abruptly cut off as a single tear fell down Draco’s face. He looked stricken, “Draco, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to make you cry!”
Harry grinned broadly, “There’s another thing…” He took out his wand and Draco eyed it. But when he had a closer look at it, he realized that it wasn’t Harry's wand. It was his old one!
Draco just sighed and stood up. He looked down at his robes. They were the ones he had been wearing at the bar.
“And, I heard from Pansy that he slapped a seventh year for calling a muggle-born Slytherin a mud-blood. Harry I really think he’s changed. Give it a shot.”
And once again I’m whisked off to dream world. ‘Malfoy has to be up to something right?’ I think, ‘I mean, there's no way he can be off of the Map all of the time.’
“I suppose you would want to know.” He sighed, “It’s complicated really. When the Ministry officials came the day of the battle, the only Death Eaters still there were us. The others had fled. The Aurors took us into custody, Azkaban, and we were promised a trial. But it didn’t come for months. The few Dementors that stayed loyal to the Ministry were enough to make us miserable in that awful prison.
“Oh fuck Harry,” he murmured pressing closer, “I really want this, I do. But I can’t. I’m getting married in two weeks. I’m so sorry.”
When Slughorn was done giving directions Hermione got up to go get the ingredients. Harry squinted at the chalkboard, adjusting his glasses.
“Someone convinced me to take my life back. To take it back from my father, the Dark Lord, my pure blood upbringing.”
“The ride conductors had to climb around and get all of the people off. We were the last ones. The whole time Dudley was complaining about being hungry. It was terrible. But not as bad as being so scared that you shit yourself.
Harry turned, Slughorn was standing by the door, a smile on his face. “Why are you so late to class?”
Draco turned back to Harry and threw him a halfhearted glare, “I don’t know what gave you that idea Potter, but I assure you, your hair is as atrocious as the day we met. And is it necessary to be making sexual references at this time of day?”
“Well, if you insist.” Malfoy stands up and sweeps past me to the door. “Good day to you Hagrid, Potter.”
Harry got up one morning to make breakfast only to find that Mrs. Weasley was already doing it. He asked if she needed help, but Mrs. Weasley just brushed him off and said she didn’t need any.
“Merde! C'est mauvais! Qu'avez-vous fait?” He mumbled while running his wand over Harry’s body, closing the gashes in his skin.
Draco immediately felt self conscious. All of the red-heads were looking at him. Hermione was the first to move.
“Are you serious ‘Mione?” Ron asked through tears, “Are you suggesting that /Harry Potter/ likes /Draco Malfoy/? That’s cute.”
TW: panic attack and angst, mostly because I am incapable of writing a chapter that's free of angst, but you know...
But Harry, who never had anyone to really comfort him before, wanted someone to hold him. So he scooted closer to Draco, and leaned into him. Draco stiffened; Harry fucking Potter, The Git Who Lived Twice, was lying there with his head on Draco’s shoulder.
Sure they all got in trouble from time to time, but the punishment was nowhere near what Harry endured in his childhood.
“But I do. I’m still afraid of what he’ll do to me. He’s done some nasty things that even the Ministry hasn't caught. He would beat my mom if she didn’t agree with him.”
But, it did give Draco the perfect excuse to do little things that drove Harry insane. Like when he would reach around Harry for an ingredient and purposely breath on his neck. Or when they were waiting for their water to boil: he’d put a hand on Harry’s thigh and slowly inch it upward until Harry’s face was bright red and he was rushing off to the loo with a barely visible boner.
Draco looked up at the twisting blue creature in anger, “It’s a ferret! Why must Merlin thrust this curse upon me?” (If he was being honest he loved his patronus instantly.)
Harry blushed profusely, “I had Hermione look into that after the war, but she couldn’t find anything. And then I asked Olivander again, he said that your wand should have gone back to you after my wand was fixed. Then he did that thing where he says curiouser and curiouser over and over again.
There were flowers all around. It looked like it was out of a movie. Draco paused at a Dancing Night Lily bush. He picked one off and held it up to catch the light of the moon. It started to wriggle, then twirl, until it was twisting around his palm with grace.
“Why would Pansy send /me/ something? And why didn’t she send it to our house?” Harry asked, as the waiter walked away.
Harry pursed his lips. “One: how do you know all this? And two: why does that have anything to do with whether or not I’m in the LGBTQ+ community?”
Ron rolled his eyes, “C’mon Harry! No need to make a big deal about it! We knew it  before you did for Merlin’s sake! Congrats on being the last one here to realize that you were in love with a blonde ferret.”
The next morning Harry woke up bright and early. He turned to his already packed Hogwarts trunk and grimaced. He had to prove to Ron and Hermione that he could be a better friend. It hurt him to hear Hermione talk about him like that, but, if Harry was telling the truth… he could see where she was coming from.
“Hey!” Harry looked up, Seamus was walking backwards looking back at the group. “Do you all wanna play a game?”
Luna seemed to regain some of her lightheartedness as she said, “It looks like you might have a couple of wrackspurts in your ears, Harry.”
With Harry’s help, they moved the couch and several chairs out and into the other guest bedroom. Then they got to work painting the walls with big rollers.
Harry stepped onto the Hogwarts Express with Ron and Hermione, they walked into the first open compartment they could find.
“Now we have at least three Gryffindors going after the Slytherins.” Quinn says, from across the table.
With that Narcissa left. Sighing heavily, Draco sat down and began to eat. Narcissa could be a fluffy kitten, and sometimes she could be a hornet. That stings you multiple times.
But then again, I’m not too worried. Malfoy seemed like he wasn’t actually going to do it. I don’t know why but I have this feeling that I can trust him. And I tend to trust my gut over any actual evidence.
They walked around the shop, looking at the different jokes and pranks. Harry found a fake scar and glasses resembling his signature look. Smirking he took the scar, walked over to Draco and stuck it smack in the middle of his forehead.
Malfoy lets out an exasperated sigh, “What else do I have to do to convince you that I’m not going to kill you?”
Harry knew exactly what he wanted. He grabbed a piece of parchment and scribbled a drawing and instructions on how to make it.
After hearing Harry sigh for the fifteenth time Ron was fed up. “Mate, why don’t you just ask Hermione?”
Draco was proud of her. She had changed her last name back to Black, and asked Draco if he wanted to do the same. He had declined saying that he was still proud to be a Malfoy. Fortunately Narcissa had respected his choice.
Harry chewed his lip, something had been bothering him lately. It was that morning a few days ago with the owls.
“Draco, how could you do that to *me*? Do you know how much I care about you? Even after only a month. You're a wonderful, amazing person, Draco. I need you. Of course I have Ron and Hermione, but you, you seem to understand me more than they do. If you had d-died,” Harry’s breath caught, and his voice softened, “I don’t know what I would have done.”
“Stop being so dramatic! It could be worse, it could be a dung beetle. Honestly it’s kind of funny. Hold on, I'm going to tell Ron!”
He appeared in his dining room. His mother was probably already asleep, but Draco didn’t care. He stumbled blindly to his room, knocking over almost everything in his haste.
“Yes. Yes I took the Dark Mark. But I want the Dark Lord defeated as much as you. And your- you're the only one who can stop him.”
The group went through many topics: coffees, shoes, clothes, hair, Hogwarts Houses, people, but the thing that never seemed to go away for good were the sex mentions. But can you blame them? They’re eighteen year olds.
Harry pushed open the door. He was right, the Weasleys did look odd, all of them in their night clothes.
He turned. Luna Lovegood was walking through the forest barefoot with her odd blue and pink shamrock shaped trunk.
Draco knew that those were empty words, but he didn’t say anything. His Department trusted him no more than the other former Death Eaters. And he was always given the jobs that no one wanted.
He takes my silence the wrong way, “Oh shit, I thought this was a good idea. I thought you would- wait never mind. I should go-”
“Qu'est-ce que j'aurais dit à Granger et Weasley?” Malfoy was pacing about the room now, speaking French.
“Just because it’s the weekend does not mean you can sulk in your room all day. You have homework! And have you eaten anything yet?”
Draco softened when he saw the look on Harry’s face. So he silently walked over and laid down on the bed. He stayed on the edge because he assumed that Harry needed space.
Suddenly their face turns serious. “I know what you're thinking Harry.” Quinn says, “He’s a racist, bigoted jerk. But here me out,”
Then he got an idea. Harry stuck out his hand and said, “I think we got off to the wrong start all those years ago. So um. Let's start again. Hullo, my name is Harry, nice to meet you.”
I took everything for granted and isolated myself from everyone. I was cut off emotionally from the rest of the world. I would have gone further into my depressed, angry state if it weren't for one person. All it took was for one person to knock some sense into me. Literally. The only one that was able to keep me grounded.
Sorry if this chapter is a little sloppy. I kinda crammed a bunch of shit together. I don't know how it turned out. So good luck.
Harry spotted Zonko’s out of the corner of his eye and got an idea. “C’mon.” He said, grabbing Draco’s hand and dragging him across the street.
Suddenly the air next to Draco got considerably colder. Harry had collapsed. He was curled in a heap next to Draco’s feet, and was shaking so hard that he looked like he was having a seizure. He kept whimpering and his eyes were shut tight.
Harry rolled his eyes, “We didn’t ever really get back together anyway, so it wasn’t /really/ a breakup. I think it just all fell apart.”
“Relax Potter, I was just teasing.” Then added, “I would be honored to go with the great Chosen One.”
“Good.” Malfoy says and unwraps his arms from my waist. “That was to remind you that you're here. Not at your aunt and uncle's house. Not stuck in a cupboard. And not trapped in a corner by your cousin. But here. In a broom closet, hiding from Filch. With me.”
Draco looked down at Harry, his lips were bright pink and swollen from kissing. He smiled at the blonde. Draco rolled off of him and stared at the moon. Thinking about how beautiful it was.
Draco would sneak out to meet Harry at night, and there were times when they would just sit at the top of the Astronomy tower. Draco was exceptionally good at Astronomy, and he would show Harry all of the new constellations he had learned. And Harry would never pay attention to the lesson, he would always be too focused on the way Draco’s face lit up when the blonde talked about stars.
His heart hurt when he had to say that, but nothing should be allowed to stop him from keeping his Malfoy heritage. Even if he didn’t really care about it, the Wizarding World expected him to, as well as his mother, despite her earlier protests. So he had to keep it up.
Harry walked down the stairs of Dumbledoor’s study. The rush of victory quickly replaced with cold, hard, sadness. Ron and Hermione had already gone down to the Great Hall. But he had stayed up in the Headmaster’s office, talking to the portraits about Dumbledoor and Snape’s last days.
Harry looked down at his paper. He had all the same classes as his last year, all of the ones that he needed to become an Auror. He skipped past his timetable to the bottom of the page. It read:
As he lay on his bed staring into the pillow, he wondered what was wrong with him. Why did he have to go and shove people away?
Hermione’s eyes suddenly went wide, “Oh my gosh, Harry!” She squealed, “Do you have a crush on Malfoy?”
Charlie was always talking about dragons and Ginny kept gushing over Luna. As it turned out Ginny had been the one to break up with Harry because she saw that they both needed it.
He looked up at the Slytherin who was struggling not to laugh. “Very funny.” He stuck out his tongue and put the pin on his shirt.
Sadder sat down again, and his voice gained a more serious tone. “I also found out that there are 8th year games. Is this true?”
Harry got dressed and sat down at the desk to start his Transfiguration homework. Unfortunately his brain wasn’t working and he was just staring at a blank piece of parchment.
Draco worked as an Unspeakable for the Ministry of Magic. It had been hard to find a job. Even three years after the Second Wizarding War, being a former Death Eater was considered to be worthy of hate crimes. Draco had dealt with it by keeping himself up in his room, and cutting off contacts to the rest of the world. Not even talking to Pansy and Blaise. Or even Greg.
A small sniffle told him that he wasn’t the only one out there. Draco rounded the bend and spotted Harry hunched over by the pumpkin patch. He was still in his Weasley Jumper. And he was crying.
‘No.’ Draco responded easily keeping in the right headspace. His Occlumency lessons were starting to pay off.
Harry smacked him on the arm, and even that was enough to send shivers up the blonde’s spine. “No! I’ve dealt with plenty! This house to creatures is like raw meat to thestrals!”
Harry tasted of alcohol and… something sweeter. Draco could feel his eyes start to water, and his nose start to burn. A single tear ran down his left cheek. This was something he wanted with all of his heart. And yet, he was getting married in two weeks.
Draco gave a sharp nod. He didn't know why his whole demeanor changed so suddenly. But, sometimes he was like that. A balling baby one second and an emotionless statue the next.
During their dinner, the waiter returned several more times, bringing more and more letters. Harry was getting annoyed at the fifth, seemingly nonsensical word. That is, until Draco suggested that he put the words together in order, to form a sentence.
Harry smirked, thinking quickly, “Oh please, I have connections everywhere. And you said it yourself, I’m the 'Savior.’ If I wanted to get someone expelled I definitely could. Or I could make a law that says that you three could never get jobs. That’s how.”
Not even five minutes later he heard someone else doing the same thing. Except they seemed to have better wheels.
Hermione seemed overjoyed. “Harry this is amazing! Did you finally realize what was going on in school!”
Sorry guys, this chapter is a little shorter than usual, just because I wrote it when my mental health was not at all stable. So yeah, its short.
Harry looked horrified at the thought. “No! I only did it when I broke into Gringotts… Anyway that was some hell of Occlumency! Who did you learn from?”
Harry’s face fell, “You know what this means right? On the next full moon, your mum will be in danger. Even if we are right, the full moon is tomorrow night! How are we going to prepare? We don’t know how they're going to get in. Or if they have any secret entrance that we don’t know about.”
Harry swerved around a Horned Serpent and dived for the tower where the Slytherin’s were hanging on.
“I don’t give a damn what your father thinks, Malfoy. He’s vile and cruel, and you're just pathetic.”
Harry creased his eyebrows, “Alright.” He got up from the table and made his way to the back of the house. He opened the back door, Arthur was indeed standing in the South Garden, but someone else was with him.
“Guys!” Harry shouted, “I do nott have a crush on Draco!” But even as he said it he flushed bright red.
Everyone laughed at that, but there was still a seriousness in the room at the mention of Fred’s death.
“Draco! Don't talk like that! You know that your parents care. At least a little bit. And I was given the task of protecting you, by your mother. We made an Unbreakable Vow!”
“Someone who was and still is /wholeheartedly/ dedicated to Tom. The ones he gathered at the end I don’t count because they weren't as dedicated as, let’s say, Bellatrix!”
Harry looked rather uncomfortable as he said, “I don’t really know how these things work. But in an arranged marriage… isn’t it only to produce an heir?”
Harry, Hermione and Ginny all burst out laughing at the same time. Ron was fuming with his arms crossed.
Ron looked helplessly at Hermione; he usually wasn’t the one that dealt with the feelingsy stuff. That was her.
I walk into the closet, and close the door behind me. Malfoy’s right, it was bigger than expected. But, still small.
Draco huffed, but this was where it got dark. “I brushed my teeth with bleach cause I didn’t have time for cavities.”
Why had the Healers been shouting? It sounded as if something good had happened. Had Draco woken up? No. If he had, the Healers would have opened the door to let him in.
He couldn’t even control it. All of the Occlumency lessons with Snape and his mother, but none of them made any difference. Voldemort was too strong.
One morning Draco went to Potter’s office to examine the only unbroken Time-Turner still at the Ministry. When he got there Weasley was pacing around the room.
I glance across the classroom. Malfoy is measuring ingredients with precision. Sweat trickles down his forehead from the heat of the caldron. I won't be fooled. I know he’s up to something!
He put a locking charm on the door and continued up the stairs until he reached the top. The hole had been fixed from when he was here last. He heard a sniffle. He was not alone. He turned to see a flash of platinum blonde hair.
I smirk, “You know Malfoy, Pumpikano Slugs are not affected by magic. So there’s no fancy spells involved. You can't Wingardium Leviosa your way out of this one!”
He literally shunned his best friend. Ron who had been there for him day after day. Been there for him through that toughest parts of school, been there to make him laugh by cracking a corny joke.
He’s not cold blooded. He’s not feeling things any less then I do. He knows pain. More than anybody else. He knows what it feels like to be lost and alone. To be unwanted. To be burdened by your past.
“DRACO LUCIUS MALFOY! WHAT THE ABSOLUTE FUCK WERE YOU THINKING! YOU COULD HAVE DIED! WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT TO YOURSELF! ARE YOU EVEN CAPABLE OF THINKING! YOU COULD HAVE KILLED YOURSELF, IF THAT WASN’T YOUR AIM ALREADY! YOU BEST HOPE I DON’T KILL YOU MYSELF THE NEXT TIME I SEE YOU! I SHUDDER TO THINK WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED IF HARRY WAN’T THERE! IF YOU HADN’T FORGOT YOUR FILES AT WORK YOU WOULD BE DEAD! Oh and thank you Harry dear. I will be forever grateful. You’re welcome to come and visit any time as well as young Miss. Granger. DRACO LUCIUS MALFOY WATCH YOUR BACK!”
The portrait swung open, and Harry stepped inside. He heard a chorus of, “Look it’s Harry Potter!” But he ignored them. He was here to see one person, and that person only.
Narcissa glared at him, “Don’t ‘good morning mother’ me!” She snapped “Were you about to leave without breakfast!”
Draco raised an amused eyebrow, “‘Hmm, how do I put this?’” He was quoting what Harry had said to him about Ginny, “‘She has the wrong parts.’”
Harry stood back up, “We’re going soon, so get ready!” The Gryffindor walked off to their shared room. (The two had bought a house two years back.)
Just as he’s about to leave Hagrid says. “Wai’. I’ve jus’ remembered! Could you two help with them Pumpikano Slugs in the Garden. Tha’ would be a great help.”
The bushy haired Gryffindor girl got everyone to sit in a circle on the pinwheel carpet, and she began.
“I’ll catch up with you guys at lunch.” I mumble. But I don’t miss the knowing look Quinn gives Ron.
“I was walking to class the other day, and I heard Crabbe and Goyle badmouthing some first year muggle-born. Draco actually stood up to them. It was impressive.”
This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good.
“Didn’t feel like it!” She said, harshly, “I was worried sick! Do you know how it feels to have someone you care about just ignore you?”
He stepped cautiously into the dinning room. He looked around, but he saw no sign of movement. Letting out a breath he walked over to the corner.
“I'm surprised that the Ministry is still letting you run around free Potter. I expect there’s a cell in Azkaban with your name on it!”
“By the way,” Harry said, “I don’t hate you. I can tell that’s what you're thinking right now. But I don't hate you.” He paused, then murmured, “I don’t think I ever did.”
Hermione nodded thoughtfully, “Yes. I see how that could go wrong. And of course the part where he’s going to be married in a week and a half. But-”
Their attention was pulled back to the center of the room where Hermione was clearing her throat. “Today is a very special day.” She began.
The shouts suddenly turned to hushed whispers. But no one came to open the door. Harry sighed in frustration, and slid his back down the wall.
“The name’s, Malfoy. Draco Malfoy. You'll soon find Potter, that some wizarding families are better than others. You don’t want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.”
I nod, and smirk at his baffled face. We’re toe to toe now and I can see every single blonde eyelash.
He sat up, and slid out of bed. He walked over to the bathroom and looked in the mirror. His arms were covered with bandages and well as his chest. He might as well have been a mummy.
The blonde glared at Harry as the Dragon swooped from the room. Harry just grinned and said, “I’m sure he’ll get a kick out of that!”
The voice is right. As I turn back to the table, Everyone is looking at me with a knowing smirk, even Nevil.
Hermione looked positively giddy, “Come on Harry! Don’t tell me you're just realizing that you have a crush on him now?”
“We got on and at first it was really fun. Because this was the only ride that my aunt and uncle let me go on. And we weren't really up that high yet. But then Dudley started rocking the little platform we were on. If it hadn't had walls we wouldn't have survived. When we got to the very top I was so scared. I remember it like it was yesterday.
Harry looked at him in shock, how did he know that Dumbledore would always leave him in the dark? “Th-Thanks, I guess.”
Harry’s eyebrows shot high, then he looked thoughtful. He chewed on the hem of his sleeve, and Draco had the urge to reach out and yank it away. That was no way to treat clothes. But then again Harry had never had any respect for fashion, for he was in old ratty muggle clothing.
“I’ll be fine. You obviously need to get this off your chest. But start from the beginning, I want to know how to help you.”
Harry sighed and stood up, trying to wipe the mud off of his face. He looked at the rest of the carriages they were almost to Hogwarts. And here he was, almost two miles away.
Harry knew that those words from anyone else would have gone in one ear and out the other. But coming from Draco Malfoy, they meant the world. And he couldn't explain why.
Harry hesitated, he couldn’t keep shunning them. “Ginny asked me to meet her by the lake.” He said hurriedly.
Draco rolled his eyes, “I’m always annoyed at you. But if there’s one thing I don’t like to do: it’s hold grudges. After the war there were so many people who wouldn’t let the past go. I really don’t want to be one of those people.”
Draco was so absorbed in watching the sky that he didn’t realize that Harry was watching *him*. When he did turn to look he jumped, “What?”
When Harry heard the slam of the door, he slid his back down the bathroom wall and burst into tears. And the worst part was: he didn’t even know why.
“Fuck. I don’t know where to start. Well first I should say this: How is your hair so bloody perfect after a week in bed? You need to teach me your tricks.”
I step down the stone steps to the dungeon. I have detention with Snape again. Why he gave it to me this time, I don't know. But I'm sure it was a very stupid reason.
“Yeah Harry, you’ve done many horrible things to him in the past and you've never apologized for any of those.”
All in all Draco really enjoyed himself. But whenever he would reach across the table, or stretch a little too far, his back would twinge painfully. The doctors had done their best to dispel all traces of the curse, but there would always be a tiny black star-shaped scar at the top of Draco’s spine. It wasn’t visible when he wore a shirt or robes, but it would always leave a mark.
Draco’s head hit the desk. How was he supposed to get any sleep? With all these reports coming in, he might as well stay here 24 hours a day!
“How are you, Draco?” Lucius murmured. Draco felt as if his feet were frozen to the floor, he couldn’t speak.
Harry stepped through the door. Professor Sadder was sitting at his desk, which was dark blue, much like everything else in the room.
He got to the ward where Draco was being kept and paused. He needed to pull himself together. Draco wasn’t going to magically awaken, and he wasn’t going to spring up and greet Harry with his usual snarky tone. No. None of that was going to happen. Harry was there to say goodbye.
“Before we eat,” she said, with a smile on her face, “Harry, I think Arthur has something to tell you. He’s out back, by the South Garden.”
Harry was left on his own most of the day, but he didn’t mind. He was very introverted and a day of rest was just what he needed. To many people’s surprise he wasn’t opposed to reading. He enjoyed a good muggle romance novel once in a while. In fact he had packed several of them, thinking the Mrs. Malfoy might like them.
Draco didn’t even try to argue; when Harry had his mind set on something there was little anyone could do to stop him.
Draco grabbed Harry’s chin and forced their mouths together. Harry's whole world shattered. He just melted into Draco’s arms. His mouth felt like a pillow, soft and warm. And Harry’s heart felt like it was about to explode right out of his chest when Draco slid his tongue in his mouth. When they finally pulled away Harry was out of breath. He was just staring at Draco completely star struck.
“Mr. Malfoy, you two will start the case tomorrow. I will allow the rest of the day off for you to prepare. Here are the case folders. Have a good afternoon.”
The shocked look on Harry's face was replaced by a nervous one, “Are you absolutely sure?” He asked.
Also, thank you all for 100 kudos! It might not be that big of a number, but it still means a whole lot to me, so thanks!
Draco never expected the Great Harry Potter to extend a hand of friendship in his direction. But here he was.
Harry shifted uncomfortably in his chair, “Well, we’ve all made mistakes.” He mumbled, “And Malfoy’s only human.”
Harry wasn’t the only one coming for Christmas. Luna and her father were coming over midday. It was due to Ginny’s newfound homosexuality. Harry was proud of her, and he still loved her. But like a big brother. He still hadn’t really forgiven Xenophilius for ratting them out yet. But he managed to hold a civil conversation. Which is more than what Ron could say, he had started yelling at the man the first time they came over.
“I appreciate the apology Harry. But I know it’s been harder for you than anyone else. So I didn’t really take any offense. You were going through a tough time, and when you were ready you talked to me. That’s all that really counts.”
Harry was still grinning like the Cheshire Cat when he handed something to Draco. “This just arrived.”
Hermione’s eyes widen and she looks dumbfounded. “Of course.” She says when she finally gets her voice back. “How about tomorrow evening in the far corner of the library?”
“I’m sorry.” I sniff, “I’ve been avoiding you. I don’t mean to I ju-” My voice breaks off. I just can't say it.
It sounded like Draco was just restless. But Harry had a gut feeling that it was more than that. He pushed open the door. The sight that greeted him was a shock.
Behind them there was a crash and a thump. Both whipped around to find an old owl struggling on the floor.
“I told you, I did. But the Healers said that they couldn't help him. They said that the Dark Mark would hold some dark magic and if they touch it they could get injured. I told them it was rubbish, but they wouldn’t listen.”
“I’m going to tell you all I know about where we were, but first we need food. Did you eat at all yesterday?”
Draco was never the one to get drunk, but with the Weasleys it was different. Everyone was so carefree. He still didn’t want to go over the edge though, so he stuck to his normal amount of alcohol.
They appeared in a dark forbidding forest. Everything was silent. Not like a peaceful quiet, but more of a dark, creepy, you'll-all-be-dead-by-morning silent.
He started to turn around but Draco put a hand on his shoulder, “Actually I need to ask you something.”
“What are we?” Seamus said scornfully, “A bunch of First Years? Playing Truth or Dare in a circle on the rug?”
“When we did finally get down, my aunt and uncle fussed so much over Dudley. They even bought him a really expensive dinner. They didn't care about me though. In fact, they blamed me and I didn't get a proper meal for weeks.”
Malfoy put his lips to Harry’s ear and growled, “Don’t ever, /ever/ talk about my parents like that!”
She smiled down at him, “I would love that, but the House Elves can handle it. Don’t you two have somewhere to be? A date?”
Draco and Ron toppled to the ground. They both sat there stunned for a moment, then Harry started to laugh.
“That’s because she was worried. She’s more of an older sister. She wasn’t the one to get involved in the Dark Lord’s antics.”
A loud pop sounded, and a small rather grubby looking house elf appeared right beside him. He had long ears and knobby knees. But the most distinct feature was his long hooked nose.
Hermione looked at him with tears in her eyes, “Harry I don’t know if he is. You heard the Healer! They don’t think the potions are working!”
“Stop playing hero, Harry! I can handle an Unforgivable. You forget I was a Death Eater. Voldemort knew the Imperius Curse, so I had to be a skilled Legilimens.”
Harry looked baffled, “Everyone has a patronus! Maybe you just haven't found yours yet. C’mon. Think of a happy memory and-”
We hope, you enjoyed this chapter! Until next time, where Harry and Draco are oN tHe sOcCeR FiElD and Hazza and Louis have maths (ugh.)!
Harry sighs and squints at Hazza, who looks a bit confused. Then Hazza whispers: “Why are they so mean?”
Shortly thereafter he lets the creaky door fall in the lock. With that loud noise he can finally exhale. His past is locked up behind this door. His incredible and happy future is coming at the university. The boy is convinced in this case because every wise person always says, “things always get better no matter how crappy your life is at the moment”. So, Hazza must believe that quote. A glance at his watch shows him that he must really hurry up to get the train. At this signal he begins to run. The boy tries hard to be quick. Nevertheless, he is very slow. Hazza hates sports: On the one hand he’s completely untalented, he can’t even skip rope. On the other hand, sports don’t bring fun – it's too exhausting. The boy is more artistically gifted. He loves to draw especially the members of One Direction. The time passes quickly without noticing. When Hazza arrives breathless at the train station to get the train which gets him to Garden High University the clock of the train station beats quarter past twelve. He can only see the last wagon of his train. “Shit! This can’t possibly be true; it isn’t true! Why is my complete life nothing but a whole mess? Why do I have to be late at my first school day at Garden High? Fuck everything!”, grumbles the boy.
Hazza hates biology. But he doesn’t understand Louis, when they enter the classroom and the first thing, Louis does is, going to the last row and ignoring his friendly greeting teacher. Hazza smiles at Mr Flitwick and greets him back, then he goes to Louis and sighs dramatically. “Oh, come on, Louis! You didn’t have to choose the back row!” Louis just stares at him, then answers: “Don’t you dare to…” Hazza raises his eyebrows and sits down. “What?” Louis sighs. “...sit down.” Hazza chuckles and Louis shakes his head, he seems frustrated. “You just could leave me alone.”, he grumbles. Hazza doesn’t know why he feels slightly sad about that. Of course, he doesn’t show that, he just chuckles again. But deep down, he feels a bitterness. He was nice to Louis, right? Maybe this is just, how Louis is. Maybe he has to try harder, to get to him. Louis turns his head forward, to Mr Flitwick who’s started talking, and ignores Hazza for the rest of the lesson.
Harry nods and shows them his papers. “Styles. Yeah, I share my room with him, and he hasn’t arrived yet.”
Suddenly he stands in front of a very big, grandiose and bewitching building. The boy is speechless, and his mouth is wide opened. Hazza whispers a quiet “Wow! That can’t be real! It must be a very beautiful dream!” He’s absolutely in love with this incredible university. After a long time, which the boy has spent with amazement about his university he hazards to enter the hallway of Garden High. This room surprises Hazza even more than so far. Then the boy searches for his room where he will sleep at Garden High. He really hopes that his roommate is nice.
“Shit. I have to hurry up. I must absolutely catch this train. I mustn’t be late at Garden High University on my first day”, hums Hazza.
Malfoy nods. “Yeah, sport is the only thing you are good at.” It sounds disgusted, but Harry knows how jealous he is. Then his face lightens up a bit. “I bet without Dumbledore you wouldn’t be here!” Harry sighs silently. He saw this coming. Malfoy teases him with this topic for years and he doesn’t get bored. Sadly, that Harry hates this. He hates that Malfoy makes him mad, every time he mentions it. But he is too tired to shoot back, so he just gazes angry at him.
Then, the two run away to the math rooms. Harry sighs and squints at Malfoy. “What do you have now?” “Well, my timetable says, I have a free lesson now, but I think I’ll spend the time at the library and use it to learn.” Harry groans. “Ew.” Malfoy seems amused. “Why? What’s your first lesson?” Harry shrugs. “Dunno. I just HATE school!” Malfoy’s eyes open wide. “You know that the first period began before three minutes? You will be late.” Harry laughs softly. “Nah, not if I won’t even show up.” Malfoy gasps. “Really, Potter?” “Yeah, really. I don’t care about…” He looks at his timetable, “… Economics.” He knows, the moment, Draco opens his mouth, what he will say. “So it’s true that great Professor Dumbledore helps you to pass.” Harry shakes his head, angrily, but he tries to calm down. “No. I just really don’t care and want to exercise for training tomorrow.” Malfoy raises his eyebrows. “Well, then let’s go.” Harry must look as surprised as he is because Malfoy laughs joyfully. “Come on, Potter! I can’t let you face the soccer field alone. Besides… this might be the chance to see you getting into trouble!”
Draco stiffened; he didn't want to talk about it now. “Well, cast a spell, let's see if I’m correct.”
Hermione looked taken aback by his angry outburst. “Alright fine.” She snapped, and turned back to Slughorn.
Hermione rolled her eyes and muttered something like: “Honestly Ronald, you daft bimbo! Those are Hogwarts teams!” But it was the look in her eye told that Ron and her were obviously going to get married.
He reached the third floor and spotted the one-eyed, humpbacked witch. Somehow still intact. He let out a small chuckle at the times when his worries were whether or not Snape had caught him in Hogsmeade.
The most humiliating part was because it was in front of Malfoy. And he laughed. Of course he laughed. But it wasn’t a mean laugh. It seemed almost real, and not mocking.
“For you! You think Mad-Eye died for you? You think George took that curse for you! You may be the Chosen One mate, but this is a whole lot bigger than that. It’s always been bigger than that.”
He walked into his room and slumped down on his bed. What was he thinking? They were both pissed, but seriously? Did he really just kiss MALFOY? His thoughts were pounding into his head. What he really needed was a vile of Dreamless sleep. Unfortunately he had used up all of his stocks. So he was forced to fall asleep without his trusty potion.
“Oooh, said with the confidence of a man who has his hands stuck in the cookie jar... in a cookie factory... and his pants are down... and they're on fire-”
This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not-
Draco tensed. Of course his father meant Crabbe Sr., but it was still unnerving to hear the name of his dead friend.
Ron walked up behind Harry and put a hand on his shoulder. “Why don’t you send a patronus to mum and tell her that you're spending the night with Malfoy. I’m sure she’ll understand if you can’t make it to dinner. And Narcissa has already said her goodbyes. So you’ll be alone.”
“Sorry about him.” Potter said nervously, “He’s just concerned. When he found out Fluer was pregnant he kind of got protective over everyone. He thinks that if he lets anyone down he’ll fuck up the whole family. But what he doesn't get is that everyone is already fucked up. I guess he’s just nervous. He really cares about his family. Oh shit, I shouldn’t have told you that.”
“Yeah, mate.” Charlie said, “We all assumed that you two were dating when you brought him with you to the Broomsticks.”
Lauren held out the posters, but Harry didn’t sign them. He was starting to get uncomfortable in this situation, this girl seemed like a big fan. And a big creep.
That’s all that he had ever wanted. For everyone to be happy. After everything that had happened in his life, all the sadness, and hate, and abuse, he was finally at peace with himself.
Harry ran into the 8th year common room and grabbed his school bag. He ran back out to Malfoy, and got an idea.
It swelled to the size of a door. And turned into a giant ball of flame. It was impressive magic. Only one person in the world would give it that kind of flare.
Draco flicked his wand and murmured a couple of complex Unspeakable spells. “The root cellar.” He whispered, “They know. But my mother is safe in her room.”
Harry’s reaction was priceless. He jumped up and spilled the coffee all down the front of his shirt.
“Draco, you resist… well then. That is an achievement, so why don’t I give you scars to remember this moment?”
“No ‘buts’. He would have gotten caught by the Ministry regardless. I think he would have rather died defending you, then spent the rest of his life in prison.” Draco wrapped his arms around the raven haired man, and squeezed at tight as he could.
He walked through the common room until he caught a glimpse of long red hair. He turned to see Ginny sitting by the fire with her legs crossed. She turned to look at him. Harry suddenly felt self conscious.
“On the count of three you will cast your charms to Disarm your opponent, and only to Disarm. We don’t want any accidents here. One… Two-”
But on the other hand, Harry wasn’t sure if he was ready to face Hogwarts again. So many things had happened in the past months that it would be hard to go back. He would have to see all his old teachers and all his old friends. He had had no contact with the outside world since the battle, and he had gotten several letters from his old friends, but going back to see them in person after he ignored them seemed so tactless.
Harry rounded a bend and came into view of the lake. He saw Ginny sitting on the edge; he hadn’t seen her in a while and it seemed as if her style had completely changed, she wasn’t wearing as much makeup as before and her hair was up in a messy bun.
“One night when the guards weren't around, an old friend came and offered to take my place. He had massive brews of Polyjuice Potion, so we simply swapped. He is a master at wandless so he shrunk all of his cauldrons down and took out clumps of my hair. The Dementors don’t know a thing. And the guards don’t like to hang around.”
The game quickly wound down after that; everyone was a little on edge. Harry said goodnight to Ron and Hermione and climbed the stairs to the boy’s dorms. He walked all the way to the top room, on the door he saw a sign labeled: Mr. Potter and Mr. Malfoy.
“Then that’s stalking.” Pansy says. Then she sits herself down next to Quinn and gives them a kiss on the cheek. “Who’s room tonight?”
Pain pierced Draco like an oxen's horns. It ran through his body threatening to push him over the edge. Then it stopped and Draco collapsed once more. Harry rushed over to him.
Hermione looked a little scared. “Harry…” she said quietly, “Please, he probably wasn’t thinking straight.”
“As 8th years you are of age, so you will have your own room with one other. You will be able to access your house's common rooms as well as the 8th year one. But the house dorms are off limits to you. So don't try anything or you might end up with tentacles.”
“Because I told them to say that. I wanted it to be a surprise. It was a bonus that you actually admitted you had feelings.”
Draco stared numbly down at the food placed in front of him. His appetite had been absent for three years. He had only eaten because his mom had told him to. He didn’t see the point. No one would care if he starved, except his mom. The only reason Draco still lived is because he knew that if he committed suicide his mom would become utterly broken.
Quinn looks at her, “Mine. It has less people, so we won't get caught.” They kiss Pansy pationently before starting on their lunch.
His father was only a foot away now. “Yes. I was quite disappointed in myself when I learnt that I had raised a faggot.”
Feeling very sleepy he buried his nose in Harry’s ebony hair. It smelled of the forest and pumpkin spice. A very good scent. He lifted his head and stared at the smaller boy before running a hand through his hair. It was soft and velvety and perfect. Just as Draco imagined it would be.
Harry nodded, “It’s not like I’m going to ice out your whole family because Ginny and I ended things.”
‘“One pound of Flaming Salamander eggs?” Who needs that much spice?’ Harry thought. Hermione returned and they started their potion.
Draco flicked the Time-Turner on the table, “Ok,” he said, “But there were rules made at the beginning of time. The Time-Turners are made so that they can feel human emotions, but a human has to be wearing it. Trust me, I don't know who came up with that crazy idea. But they must be related to you, Potter.”
Draco took a deep breath and shook himself, “Your right. I can’t let my personal fears get in the way of my job. I have to forget that she’s my mother and instead think of her as another person.”
He was about to give up hope that he was going to survive. But he got news that all of the Death Eaters were being put on trial. Most of them were sent to Azkaban for life or received the Kiss. Lucius Malfoy was sentenced to a life in Azkaban. The only reason Draco didn’t receive the same fate was because of Harry bloody Potter.
So please, if you can, will you meet me in the kitchens tomorrow after classes. I really want to fix things. (Bring Ron too.)
Ron nodded, “Yeah mate. You did some serious damage to yourself.” His eyes glinted, “And your mum from the sound of it.”
But Hermione had seen everything. She grabbed Harry’s forearm, (which made him wince in pain) and wrenched up the sleeve.
“When I was 7, my uncle and aunt brought me and my cousin to an amusement park. I was really excited to go. I had never been to one before. My cousin Dudley was really excited to go on one ride in particular. The ride was the one we’re sitting on. It’s called a Ferris Wheel.
Okay umm, this chapter isn't my best, the pacing is kinda weird. So is the dialogue. But you know, I don't have too much time to write anymore due to this thing called school. I wrote a completely unnecessary character in, mostly cause I'm kind of in a toxic friendship with a Lauren that I have no idea how to get out of! Yay!
“It doesn’t start till 7 o-clock! You have time to eat. You need your strength if you're going to deal with criminals all day. Now sit your skinny arse down and eat.”
After the trial had ended, Potter had come up to him and thanked Draco for saving his life. Actually, thanked him. Potter and his hero complex. It was actually quite annoying.
He leaves the secretary with his timetable and instructions where to find his room. The plan says, he shares his room with a guy named Styles, which can’t be a real name. Maybe they made a mistake.
After biology, which was totally boring, they both have art. Hazza hopes his excitement doesn’t show too much. But when Louis raises an eyebrow (for which Hazza admires him, he tried this in front of the mirror, but it never worked out), he just grins and says: “I love art class.” Louis nods. “Yeah, I see that.” With these words he enters the classroom and waves at a girl, sitting on a table and laughing about something, the boy next to her just said. As she sees him, she jumps of the table and runs to them. “Louis!” She laughs and hugs him, then dragging him to the table she just sat on. Hazza doesn’t know what to do and stands where they have left him. He sighs. Well, maybe art class won’t be that fun. He sits down and takes his things out, when the girl comes to his table. “Hey!” She smiles. Hazza smiles back, he’s nervous and feels a bit shy. The girl is tall and very, very pretty. She must be some famous girl here, because all of the boys and some girls too stare at her. “I’m Maya Henry! You must be Hazza, right? Louis told me nothing about you, what is sad, but he seems to like you!” She still smiles friendly. Harry has to admit that he likes her. Maya must be a good friend. “Uhm…” She laughs. “Well, Draco told me, you two Harrys arrived. Though he’s not very happy about that. But I think, it’d be rude if I wouldn’t invite you to sit with us. I think you’re nice and the other Harry is of course welcomed too! Liam, Zayn and I live around here, so we’re just going to school and not eating or sleeping at Garden High. But we all have art class together and the teacher likes us enough to ignore when we’re chatting or eating. It’s like having lunch break!” She nods in the (one :D) direction of the others. And really! Harry’s there too, though he seems to be very angry about something Draco said. He looks at Louis, who stares at him, then turns his head to the two boys next to him. One of them wears eyeliner and Hazza’s heart bumps faster. He always wanted to try to wear a dress or skirt, but his parents were strictly against that. He nods. “Yeah, I’m coming!” He packs his things and follows Maya. The teacher is really nice, and so are the other students. It looks like once Hazza sits down, next to Maya and most of the group welcome him with a smile, he is fancier than he ever has been. He definitely can say that he’s part of the popular group now. He doesn’t really know how to feel about that though. Hazza listens to the other students, while he’s drawing. He starts with a sketch and then takes his acrylic colors. It’s just a silly drawing, more an exercise than something serious, but when he finishes it by the end of the lesson, Harry Looks at it in amazement. “Wow! That’s pretty good!” Hazza smiles shy. “It’s not a big deal” Louis sighs and Hazza looks up. “It is a big deal. It’s fuckin’ good.” Then, he turns around and follows Draco. And Hazza couldn’t be happier.
“I cut because I can, okay!” He snarled, before whipping around and slamming the bathroom door shut. “And while you're walking out the door you can take the food with you!”
“For Merlin's sake Potter! Granger doesn’t just make shit up. She usually has a reason behind it, and frankly, you *have* been a little off lately.”
Draco was too tired to resist, so he just sat down and began to eat. He tried not to think about what the night would bring, but it was hard not to be afraid. He also tried desperately not to think about the night before. Not thinking about anything at all seemed to be the best option.
“But how in the name of M- Oh!” Draco had suddenly realized that he was still holding Harry's hand. He lept back, but immediately felt the absence of Harry's warmth. It had felt so right. Draco shook his head, it was probably those damned wrackspurts that Luna was always going on about.
Draco quickly dressed and headed for the Apparition point in his house. He hoped his mother wouldn’t catch him up this early.
I glare at them and they smirk. But Quinn is wrong. There is no way that I like Malfoy. He’s a bigoted jerk!
Draco peared over the Gryffindor’s shoulder to see a text from Ron saying. ‘Are you ready to make an unbreakable vow?’
Draco shook his head, trying to rid the memories of that night. He was so used to nightmares by now, he didn’t bother to go back to sleep. He glanced at his Grandfather Clock. It was 5:51. He needed to be at the Ministry by 7 am. He could get there a little early.
“At least I made you a cup.” Harry said, holding out a mug of coffee and beaming. They both seemed to be pointedly ignoring the fact that they had slept in the same bed.
He had baked cake after cake for Dudley when he was only five years old. Petunia had very high standards as well, so if a cake wasn’t perfect, she would lock him in his cupboard for days without food. And when he was finally let out his only meals were the burnt cake from the bin. That was the only thing he had to eat for the next five days usually. He burned things more times than not in his early years, and the punishment was cruel and inhumane. But Harry didn’t know anything else, it was normal to him.
Draco stared at him in disbelief, “You mean to tell me that the The Boy who Lived Twice has never shagged anyone in his life!”
That’s when Harry noticed that Malfoy was there. He was also scowling at Blaise, who gave him a knowing look.
“He asked ‘Are you quite sure that you dislike Mr. Malfoy.’ I told him I did and he just said, ‘By the looks of this case you don’t.’ Then he kicked me out of the shop!
Draco never got a chance to ask what exactly was so enjoyable because Harry was already whipping out the case file.
Both men stood there uncomfortable looking out the window or at objects in the office. Anywhere but each other.
Harry brightened, “Okay, we’ll move forward again!” He beamed. The Slytherin offered a small smile in return.
Ginny sighed, losing her flame. “I don’t know Harry. I don’t know. But maybe I’ll stop caring about you sooner or later.”
When Draco stepped into the sitting room, Harry was sitting on the sofa reading a book in his pajamas. He had obviously not expected Draco to come rolling out of the fireplace.
Potter ran his fingers through his hair. “Well, the war is over and you have certainly deemed yourself trustworthy, and I don’t think about you as a Death Eater anymore. I guess, I- I think of you as a friend. If that’s alright with you.”
Draco suddenly noticed that Harry was sitting rigid on his broom staring at a spot a couple feet from the Slytherin’s foot. He looked down, the snitch was circling the top of a tree.
Harry and Draco spent the rest of the day with the Weasleys, eating Christmas food, opening Christmas presents and having a few drinks. One particularly memorable moment was when Ron drank so much that he took off his pants and ran around the kitchen half naked.
They opened the files and began pouring over them. It turned out that the Department of Mysteries knew how to track when and where the Time-Turner was being used. None of that helped though. If they couldn’t find a pattern it would be useless. But it was all they had.
Draco just sat there, trying to sort out what just happened. The confused look on his face just made Harry laugh harder.
Harry looked down at his feet, deciding to just tell them what was on his mind. That was the only way to really explain what was going on.
Harry scrambled up knocking over the chess board in the process. “Ron! Wait. It’s fine we were just playing chess.”
Harry seemed to notice his tense posture, and put a hand on his leg. “It’s going to be okay. I promise.”
Harry sighed, “Well if they ever do that again just come find me.” Harry picked up the girls patch from the ground where the first one had dropped it. He whispered a spell and the patch magically reattached to her bag.
Harry slapped his arm, “NO! I was talking about the war. The war is the bad thing in all of our pasts. As well as my parents' deaths. I was also talking about you! You're the good thing in my present!”
They continued around the circle until it got to Seamus. He was already tipsy when he announced: “Never have I ever been gay.” And downed a shot.
Harry finally seemed to realize that he was still in his pajamas. “Oh shit. Ummmmm, I’ll, huh, I’ll go change.” He hurried up the stairs.
The Weasleys were so accepting, so Draco found a spot next to Ginny and Charlie. That proved to be a bad decision.
His feet hit something with a clang. It was a weird noise and it didn't sound like dirt in the middle of nowhere.
He stumbled out of his bed and into the bathroom. He fumbled around the drawers until he found a toothbrush.
When they were leaving the restaurant, Draco heard Harry’s mobile phone ding. Harry took it out and sighed, “What the hell?”
“What if we tried the Unforgivable Curses? I mean they might not do anything but they might have some effect on it.”
Draco’s eyes widened. Everyone knew the story about Voldemort's Horcruxes, it was common knowledge. But no one but Harry’s closest friend knew all of the details.
The den was so big it took all day to paint one coat. “We’ll have to do the second coat tomorrow.” Draco said, yawning. “Thanks, you two for helping us.”
When Harry entered the 8th year common room with a completed potions essay, he found Ron and Hermione waiting for him.
Harry rounded the corner, he didn’t even know where he was going anymore. He was just trying to escape the flapping wings behind him. He passed a tapestry and realized that it was of Barnabas the Barmy.
Harry rolled his eyes, “Whatever. I don’t normally play the ‘Saviour of the World’ card, but it seemed like the only option.”
Harry quickly turned his head to check. Yep. Malfoy knew where they were. He was standing rigid, hands clutching his paper, eyes glazed over. And Harry knew he was back in the flames.
Other than his birthday three years ago, Draco hadn’t seen his father at all. And now he was holding a wedding invitation for ‘Lucius Malfoy and Kohianna Welt’s wedding.’ He really did not want to go.
“Well,” Ginny said, “This prat here didn’t talk to me the whole summer. I got mad at him, and then he said all the wrong things. He doesn’t know how to talk to girls it seems.”
Harry rolled his eyes, stood up and said, ”Oh, get a room.” Before huffing and walking out the door.
Ripper trapping me on top of the fridge for hours until the Dursley's got home from lunch with Marge.
Draco sniffed, “I have no idea what you two are talking about. Nothing happened.” Despite his pompous attitude Draco was quite afraid of lying. He had been since…
Although Harry didn’t hear him; he was too busy laughing. Out of the corner of his eyes, he could see Draco crack a small smile.
Draco heard the thump of Harry sitting down next to him. But the blonde kept his head firmly in his arms. He didn’t feel like talking. Harry seemed to understand that because he just sat there.
But Harry thought nothing of it at the time. So he leaned into Draco’s touch. The two stayed like that for a while, and Draco had to resist the urge to run his hand through Harry’s ebony hair. It looked quite soft.
Harry reached for his wand but the blonde was faster. He pinned Harry’s arms by his side. “I told you I was going to get my revenge. I believe my exact words were: ‘Just wait, it’ll be you squirming on the floor next time.’ And here you finally got what was coming for you.”
But Harry wasn’t giving up that easily, “C’mon! What’s stopping you? Are you scared you won’t get it on your first try because-”
“Okay, this should be all we need for now.” Draco said to Cosmo and Coco, taking two tins of paint. “Do you two want to help? I know Ivy doesn’t, she’ll hate getting dirty.”
“Whatever.” Draco could feel his heart start to flutter, knowing that the moment was drawing closer.
They both said their goodnight’s after dinner and went to their respective rooms. Harry fell asleep excited for the next day when he and Draco would be re-decorating the entire Manor. It was a daunting task, but an exhilarating one.
Draco nodded and handed him a vile from his pocket. Harry bent down and forced the clear liquid down Lucius’s throat. They waited exactly 13 seconds for the potion to take effect, then Harry asked the first question, “Do you have the Time-Turner on you?”
Harry looked horrified, “I’m sorry! I didn’t know that you would be hurt that bad! And you didn’t have a wand to protect you! Because I took it. I’m so sorry.”
Draco groaned. Why him? ‘Just get this case over with and be done.’ He thought, ‘Then you can go back to hating him.’
There's also something I want to let you guys know: I will not be posting next week due to a camping trip with my family. It is close to my mother's birthday, so we decided to take a trip up north. I'm really sorry, but I will be back after that.
“The baby was just delivered! Fluer is ok, and so is Bill. The baby is a girl, they haven’t decided on a name yet, but-”
There was something about Harry's desperate look that made Draco want to comply. “Fine.” He huffed. “But only if you explain everything in full detail.”
Draco stared at it. Why the fuck had his patronus changed? As far as he knew, they only change when someone has gone through an *emotional* change. Harry looked confused too. But shook his head; now was not the time.
There was a knock on the compartment door as the train started up, Harry turned his head. Ginny, Neville and Luna were standing there. Harry stood up and let them in.
As Harry was climbing the stairs, he thought about what Hermione had said. ‘“Is it Malfoy.” Of course it isn’t Malfoy!’
After a year of that, he had had enough. Draco had gotten a job out of pure boredom. It had been hard enough at home with all of the hate mail, but the glares at the Ministry were hard for him to bear. Even in his own Department hated him!
“Draco! Is it him, is it the boy? Are those his friends? The redhead and the mudblood? We have to be absolutely sure before we call the Dark Lord.”
I sigh and shake my head as they run the rest of the way to lunch. When I finally reach the doors of the Great Hall I see Pansy giving Quinn several Knuts. She looks at me as I sit down, disappointed.
He put a hand on the doorknob and tried to turn it. He couldn’t. It was locked. He cast an Alohomora that didn’t work. He was about to run and get the healers when he heard excited shouts from within the room. What was going on?
Malfoy smirks, “Oh, you'd be surprised. I’m sure it never got through that thick skull of yours, but we are wizards.”
Malfoy stared at him. “That was a fun little speech. But it doesn’t help anything, besides, what do you know?”
“Well, I suppose it depends what you mean by ‘crush’.” Harry was avoiding Draco’s grey gaze. He was blushing hard.
Malfoy reached out a hand, Harry reached out his. But he missed. Swiveling back around he saw a fiery tiger lunge for the tower. Then he saw Ron and Hermione swooping out with an unconscious Goyle on their broom. But Malfoy was still in there!
Draco got up and followed him, grabbing his dress robes then heading to the bathroom to change. He liked to have privacy when he changed because of certain things on his arm and chest that made him uncomfortable. Harry had been completely understanding and accepting. He had been in tears upon seeing the scars on Draco’s chest, and promised to make it up to him for the rest of his life. Needless to say, it was an emotional night for both of them.
He hated when teachers gave him special attention just because he had defeated Tom. If anyone else had walked in that late they would have gotten detention. But not Harry. He was given a ‘get out of jail free’ card. Even when everyone else had worked just as hard as he to rid the world of Tom Riddle.
“Do you like it?” Harry asked, anxiously waiting for an answer. “I thought that you might get offended, but then I thought it might be-”
Ginny went into a shop and came out with half her head shaved. Luna gushed over it, while Harry and Neville exchanged a knowing look.
Hermione gave him a look, “You and Luna were the only ones not here, and then she appeared out of thin air. And remember you can't Apparate in the Hogwarts grounds.”
Harry was left with Neville, Luna, and Ginny. They made a stop at Honeydukes, then walked around a bit. What’s a Hogsmead visit without a trip to Honeydukes right?
Draco snorted, “Well, I mean, I wasn't exactly nice to him in school. Or any of the Weasleys for that matter. So I don't blame him.”
“Honestly. I think these things might be getting better. Seems old Xenophilius came to his senses after the war.”
The other person drops down and I hold my breath, cursing myself for not having my invisibility cloak.
Malfoy snorted at his feeble attempts. He waved his wand and Harry’s rock turned into a cushy chair.
“I often talk out loud to myself. I find it extraordinarily useful…  Have ever whispered to yourself Draco?”
“Morning. I owl’d your mum. She’s not too happy. I wouldn’t recommend going back there. At least right now.”
As it turned out Ron was very clingy when drunk and Hermione had to Apperate them home. It was quite funny to watch Ron stager around the bar talking to random people about who would win the next Quidditch match: Gryffindor or Slytherin? The poor people he attacked were just minding their own business.
Harry looked like he wanted to argue, but Draco wasn’t going to let him. He had so much shit to get off his chest.
Harry stopped his train of thought. ‘I did drag myself to go see her, didn't I? And I guess I do treat her like a chore. Fuck! Do I even love her?’
Harry could feel his face start to heat up. “I don’t know, you’ll need help and I enjoy your company.”
“Fine, then stay here I don’t care.” Malfoy stood up and wiped the tears off his face. “But don’t you dare tell anyone about this.”
“Ron, I know that your family and the Malfoy family have had disputes, but why can't we put that behind us? What if this case is an excuse to get to know him?”
He had not screamed once. His mother would awake in the morning to see her son lying dead upon the floor. He did not regret not saying goodbye. It would have made doing this a whole lot harder.
Harry was cracking up. Tears were forming in his eyes. “Merlin Draco!” He exclaimed, “I love your mum.”
I turn the corner heading for Gryffindor tower. My head filled with Malfoy, his hair, his eyes, his snarkiness. His smile. Ugggh. It’s so frustrating! It was so easy when I could just ignore feelings, and hate him. But now it’s so much more complicated. Everything is so jumbled! And twisted! It’ll literally drive me insane!
Hermione’s eyes widened, “I should just let you two talk then…” she muttered. Then hurried out of the living room.
“But, I let Sirius die! It’s my fault if I hadn’t been so hot headed, maybe he would have survived.”
“Honestly Potter, You can be so dense sometimes! Look at that giant hole in the middle of the tracks.”
The two of them kicked off into the air. Knowing it would definitely be hard to see the snitch in the dark, Draco had attached a super, super tiny light to one of the wings that lit up whenever one of them was within ten feet of one of it.
Harry gulped, he never thought that he’d be the one to plan something like this. “Well, it’s so dark and cold right now. What if we painted it with warmer colors?” He suggested, “We could take out all of the black furniture too, and replace it. Just to give this place a cozier look. Cause right now it’s all sharp edges. It’s basically saying, ‘I hate everything that isn’t black, fear me.’”
There was clattering and then a house elf appeared with a knife and three plates. Harry heard Ron cut the cake and place it on one of the plates. Then a smash as he dropped it.
“You will be sitting with your own houses at meals though. Now if you all please follow me I will show you to your rooms.”
Harry glanced at Neville, who shrugged. Harry said goodbye and walked with Luna down to the courtyard.
Luckily Lucius did not, “What is this ‘stop the clock’ business? I’m not going to shoot you,” He grinned nastily, “But the Imperious Curse will do.”
“Yes,” Mr. Border said in grave tones, “Very bad business indeed. Mr. Malfoy, you have climbed considerably high in this Department. You are a very trusted Unspeakable.”
Harry spent the whole train ride with his friends. People he could trust. It felt amazing, he hadn’t had this much fun in two years. You know, it’s a little hard to have fun when an evil wizard is trying to hunt you down and kill you, while /you/ are trying to kill /him/.
Draco stretched open his eyes, and was immediately blinded. It was an unusually bright day. But that’s not all that made today special. It was the day of the full moon. The day when the Time-Turner would be put to use again. And most likely at Malfoy Manor.
Potter, no, Harry nodded. “I think we should try and put some spells on it, just to see if it would work. We don’t know if the culprit tried to confuse the magic on it.”
Draco nodded. The after shock of finding out it was his dad doing all these things still hadn’t completely worn off. He walked over to his father. 'Wingardium Leviosa.’ “Let’s get this scum back to the Ministry.”
It was Harry’s final move when he heard the compartment door open. Ron was standing there with a look of shock on his face.
“I got home and started thinking about it, and I just got really mad. But not mad at them. Mad at myself because I shouldn’t have to apologize; I shouldn't have done any of that in the first place!”
Draco, Harry, Coco and Cosmo worked all day putting together furniture in the newly painted rooms. Harry and Draco left the two House Elves to do some of it on their own because they still had to paint the ballroom.
The sound of a crash startled Harry out of his thoughts. He got out of bed and walked over to the door. Pressing his ear against it he heard nothing. Against his better judgment he turned the knob and softly opened it.
Inside was a tiny silver clasp. Like a crest. But it wasn't. On the silver there were two small blue animals, a dragon and a ferret. They were twisting around each other in endless circles and their eyes were a glowing white.
Luckily Harry came back levitating four bottles of Butterbeer. It was quite an enjoyable night, although Draco couldn’t look Hermione in the eye.
“No. Just trying to give a toddler a chance to catch the snitch.” Draco said, not taking his eye off the fluttering gold ball in front of him.
Draco continued to stare at the Jumper in his hands. While the rest of the people in the room celebrated, he felt sick to his stomach.
“Murderer? Monster? Killer? Potter. I have not committed any murder. And never will. I am not completing the task the Dark Lord sent me to do. Something changed my mind. Or, someone.”
Harry felt a tap on the arm he turned to see Dean standing there. “Hey, you wanna work together? Seamus is out sick.”
He saw Neville take a deep breath, “ImpansexualandIthinkIhaveacrushonBlaise!” Neville squeezed his eyes shut.
Draco sighed. He really needed to be more careful. With a rather skilled flick of his wand his robes transfigured into regular muggle clothing. A crisp white button up shirt and some jeans.
Malfoy raises an eyebrow and doesn’t say anything. Instead he takes his own Brain Banisher, sprays the nearest slug and hoists it over his shoulder. He does the same thing with three others. Then he walks to the edge of the Forbidden Forest and dumps them there.
“The spell damaged his body and his brain is perfectly intact. But. With a spell like this we don’t know how it’s going to react if we try and mess with the brain.”
When they were done at Zonko's Draco and Harry walked down to the Three Broomsticks. Harry went up to the counter and bought two Butterbeers. When he sat back down he decided to ask Draco a question that had been eating at him.
“You can feel my magical signature because of what happened in the bathroom in 6th year.” Harry said, “And you said that it felt like it had changed. You also said that you could feel Voldemort's signature. I think what you were feeling was part of Voldemort’s soul.”
Percy turned beet red, but Hermione continued. “Today is a day of friendship. Of happiness. But most of all, family.”
“DRACO!” The door to his room banged open. “Draco! Get your lazy arse out here! You will not be holed up there all day! Please come down for dinner!”
Draco looked down at the hand on his thigh, ‘How can it be okay?’ He thought. ‘My mother is in danger. Even with the wards.’
Harry froze, and just stared. Draco just raised an eyebrow, “You did remember that I was coming today did you not?”
Harry’s face lit with understanding and Draco rolled his eyes. He walked up to the hole and started running his wand along it, mummering complex incantations. He had always been proud of his ability to conduct certain spells, and now he was an Unspeakable so he had access to even more.
“Oh no. I just like walking to school. People think it’s quite odd, but I find it relaxing to have time by myself in the middle of the woods, before the bustle of the Great Hall.”
For the first time Harry looked up at his teacher. He was wearing dark purple billowing robes to match his magenta hair. He had glasses and a blue necktie, which was probably supposed to be hidden.
Harry pushed open the shop door, and was immediately hit with a very pungent scent. He scrunched his nose.
When they all stepped off the platform Ginny, Ron and Hermione went off to Mrs, and Mr. Weasley. (Harry had already told them that he wasn’t going.) Luna and Neville went off to their respective guardians. Harry was left waiting for Draco, while being goggled at by students and their families.
“You have that love struck look about you again, Draco.” Lucius continued. He was slowly advancing, and Draco was suddenly aware that his back was against the wall.
“I was scared.” Harry confessed, looking at each of his friends in turn, “My relatives aren't the most accepting people… I just assumed that everyone hated it.”
Draco had sunk down the wall and was now curled in a ball. His arms were wrapped tightly around his knees and his face was hidden from view. He was shaking so hard that he was sure Harry could feel him.
They fell into an uncomfortable silence. Draco was still curled into a tight ball, and Harry was just sitting there looking incredibly awkward. Draco would have laughed had this been any other situation.
The blonde wanted to beg him not to leave. But he knew exactly when Harry was doing it. He had seen Draco’s boggart after all.
Draco gave a sharp nod and shifted on the couch. He was nervous. His mother had always been important to him and if he lost her… Well he was just going to pray that that wouldn’t happen.
Kretcher nodded, his head bobbing up and down. “I am quite honored to make Master Draco breakfast. He is an honorable Black after all.” Then he went over to the cabinets and started to take out plates and cups.
Harry pulled himself away and got to his feet, “Come on. Let's go inside, Molly’s just started breakfast.”
“Oh, I'm sorry. Merlin forbid I try and strike up a conversation with the Chosen One.” Quinn says, sarcastically.
“Cat got your tongue?” Lucius asked in mock concern. Blood was rushing to Draco’s head and he was remembering all sorts of terrible things he had barred from his brain for so long.
Draco put his hands in his hair and sighed. If these reports kept coming in, even the Pepper-up potion wouldn’t work. The Time-Turners kept getting stolen, so far three of them were missing. It was sending the Department of Mysteries through hell. They didn’t even have any suspects! Of course Draco himself was questioned with Veritaserum, but he was found innocent. All of the Time-Turners that weren't destroyed in Draco’s Fifth year at Hogwarts, were supposed to be destroyed after the war, but apparently some of them escaped being smashed.
Once Draco had his dress robes on he reached under the sink to retrieve a small stack of letters. He swished his wand once and they dissolved into thin air. Satisfied he left the bathroom.
Harry seemed to sense Draco's inner turmoil. Because he turned to face the blonde. “Hey. Calm down. She’s going to be fine.”
I whip around. “How the fuck do you know!” I shout. “I haven't told anyone except Ron and Hermione!”
Harry shrugged, “I don’t know… Fuck. You guys are right. No wonder his arse looks so good in his Unspeakable robes.”
Ron, Harry and Draco all hurried into the pub. Inside sat all of the Weasleys (minus Bill of course.) It was a weekday so they basically had the place to themselves.
Harry gave him another uneasy glance. His eyes glazed over and Draco knew what was coming. He braced himself.
“I don’t know…” Even to himself Draco sounded defeated. “I know that Ginerva er… Ginny is probably right. I might like Potter more than a little bit more than I originally intended to. I have no idea why I’m telling you all of this. I mean, I’ve known for a while that I’m probably gay. Due to my lack of attraction to girls and attraction to every guy's backside. I’m sorry you probably don’t want to listen to my rambling.”
This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good. This is not good.
Now, he could have easily gone into a dive and caught the snitch way before Harry even got a chance. But he had a plan, and it involved Harry catching the snitch.
After several bottles of Butterbeer and countless shots the Golden Trio was quite tipsy. Draco was a lot better at knowing when he was drunk, and decided that tonight was not the night.
He shoved the door open, “Stupefy!” The spell hit a crate just below Lucius’ shoulder and it exploded.
I grin, “I distinctly remember saying: ‘I think I can tell the wrong sort for myself, thanks.’ Well turns out I can't.”
“Hermione’s gotten me a broomstick!” Ron tore off the brown paper to reveal a shiny new Nimbus 4,001. He held it against the light admiring it. “I love that woman.” He whispered, probably more to himself than Harry.
He looked back at his friends, who were smirking at him. “Okay… fine, maybe there is a little truth to your assumptions.”
