When Draco didn’t sound as though he planned on finishing, Harry said, “That was years ago.”
, Lupin had said once.
“I haven’t made tea,” Andromeda said, returning with a tray held in her hands.  “I’ve made hot chocolate.  Harry never got to have any.”
“Potter, everyone needs magic.”
Then he was pressing up against, Harry, all of him, Draco’s long bare body pressing against his, Draco’s mouth pressing against his, Draco’s leg pressing between his. He pulled away from Harry’s mouth with a satisfied little noise. “Rut against me,” he whispered, nudging his thigh higher between Harry’s own. “Use me; use my body. Use me for anything; pleasure yourself on me.”
“Then how come I don’t know about him?”
Andromeda just raised her brows slowly.
Everything about it should have reminded Harry of Malfoy and his potions, but to Harry it seemed nothing like.  This place was cool and clinical, whereas—despite how distant Malfoy had grown—Tailored Tinctures always seemed warm, inviting, a cheery place where magical things happened.  Here, the mixing and stirring and sifting seemed somehow sinister, the white tile floor gleaming with harsh light, the high ceilings lined with sterile glass cabinets filled with potion after potion.  Equipment for brewing—cauldrons, Pensieves, ladles, beakers, spoons, were lined up along the counters.
Draco stopped, his lovely grey eyes very round, his pink mouth an ‘o’.
The blond man swirled his stick at Harry and said, “
Taking out his wand, Harry pointed it. “Expecto Patronum.”
“Forgive me,” he said, sounding blank.  “I was functioning under the assumption that I was a normal person.  How silly of me.”
“Travers should be expelled! Obviously!” Harry waved a hand. “People like that shouldn’t be Aurors!”
“It sounds
“But I still like you.”
“Suit yourself.”  Hitching an elegant shoulder, Mister Malfoy took a sip of chocolate.  He didn’t look like there was a problem with it, and he didn’t do anything stupid or condescending after that like smack his lips.
“Right.” Harry took off his glasses so he could rub his eyes. “Story of my life.”
“Former Death Eater,” Astoria corrected coolly.
“I’ve been paying attention.”  Harry swallowed.  “How is . . . your boyfriend?  Are things . . . good?”
“Draco,” Harry said.  “I understand.  I’ll come back next time, when you age again.”
“Harry,” Draco said, but then didn’t say anything else.  Bending down, he carefully moved Harry’s hair—Harry guessed he had his scar back, and then Draco was putting Harry’s glasses over his eyes.  “
Harry tried to think of something to say.  Draco had told him not to pretend things.  “Maybe you could teach me,” Harry said finally.  “You’re much better than some old book.”
“Fuck,” Harry muttered.
“You can?” Harry asked, surprised.
“Come,” Draco said gently.  “Would you like to fly some more?  This time, without falling off?”
“I’m allowed to have more than one.  As long as it’s consecutive and not concurrent.”
“Wow.  You really know someone like that?”
“That was how it was
“Er, okay,” said Hermione. “But I’m not exactly suggesting you bring a non-mag you’ve been dating two months to the exclusive holiday party filled with magical UK’s entire fighting force.”
Mister Malfoy was displeased, and Harry very much wanted to please him.  He liked Mister Malfoy a lot.  He liked him a whole lot, and he didn’t know why some things he said seemed to make Mister Malfoy frustrated, especially when the other thing Harry had said was about hot chocolate.  It was confusing, and Harry wished it could be clear like it was with Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, only he didn’t wish it was like that at all.  That was confusing too.
Harry snapped out of it.  “You have some indicator solution?”
Harry thought about this, staring at a spot between them on the floor. It was empty after all. He looked up. “Close to when I started, you had me make a list,” he said, “of everyone I could go to in a time of need. You said it was different than seeing a therapist, that I had to remember they were friends.”
“I . . .” Draco arched into Harry’s hand, his face pink and surprised. “Forever, Harry,” he said in that breathless, excited voice. “I’m going to tease you until you break.”
Harry felt like he shouldn’t have to explain this, and yet he understood better now why he did.  “If I tell you,” he said, “are you just going to use it against me?”
“No, I don’t,” Harry said immediately.
don’t know what I do as a grown-up,” Malfoy said, moving around some rocks on the bench, “only neither of them likes to read.  Can you imagine not liking to read?”
“What are you trying to say?”
“No.” Baggot. “The Board accepted Draco Malfoy’s application.”
“Don’t ride in taxis!” Draco said, still sounding frantic.  “Don’t use mobiles!  Don’t go to your house!  Harry, you went to a place where a
“Who?”
Harry stumbled over his own feet, gripping the cabinet for balance, knocking over one of the bottles inside.
Was it really going to be that easy?
Draco made a little noise, sinking back into the booth.  “I bet it looks
was one of those spells that required a force of feeling, but the skull’s eyes grew flowers, and the snake had on a little party hat.
“Ten years before you. There are four witch-wizards in the world, Harry. Don’t forget.” Yin sipped their smoothie.
“Is it because you were a Death Eater?” Harry said.
“You ID’ed a potion for Cecil Vance,” Harry said.
“Just so.” Ron smiled at Hermione. “Anything could happen in ten minutes.”
“You know what I meant.”
“Owl post delivery system,” said Mister Malfoy.  “It’s how wizards deliver mail.”
Something seemed to dawn on Ron.  Harry felt pretty certain Ron was remembering what Harry’s life must have been like at ten, and what Hermione had probably explained to Ron that it might have done to Harry.
“No.” Harry slipped the vial into his pocket. “I trust you.”
“Nothing,” Harry said, because he had finally realized what had been bothering him about the pictures all around them.  “Did Rose do that?” Harry said, nodding his head at one of the pictures.
Thanks again to icmezzo and seraphcelene, without who this would not have been written, and to siemejay, without whom there would be many typos and less loveliness in the world.
.  The note read:
“There’s a secret passage to a house near Hogsmeade under there,” Harry said. “So I needed it.”
Expecting that Draco would now Immaculo the come, Harry tilted his head to give Draco an angle, but instead, Draco cast a healing spell. Harry’s jaw immediately felt better, the ache gone and the muscle fresh. “You can say no,” Draco whispered, then cast another spell.
“This first one may move your hair a bit,” Draco said, pointing his wand.  “I see you did comb it, so I’ll try not to muss it.”
“Wouldn’t you rather be indoors?” Mister Malfoy asked.  “And I can fix your clothes.”
“It’s my job,” said Harry, snagging them mini-sausages rolls off a passing tray, then walking with Ron to be against a wall.
“What?” Harry said stupidly.
“I think I’ve found something,” Draco said.
“You think I don’t know that?”  Draco looked up at him incredulously.  “I’m not talking about her love; I’m talking about her—do you know what it would
Draco didn’t stop smiling.  “How about you show me all the things you learned?” he suggested, so Harry showed him the folding spell with the flannel.
In the month leading up to Reveal, Councillor Hermione Granger had sought a vote of no confidence in Minister for Magic, Cornelius Fudge, who had rejected every aspect of the Deal that would have paved the way for relationships between the magical government and non-magical. Fudge was supported on one side by Concealers who had not wanted Reveal in the first place, and so were doing everything possible to sabotage the Deal. On the other side, Fudge was supported by some of the radical Reveal element who claimed that a Deal would only further enable the Ministry of Magic to manipulate non-magical institutions to work in favour of magical interests rather than facilitate magical and non-magical relations.
“You have a lab?”  Harry perked up a little.  “Like on the telly?”
The long cord of muscle in Malfoy’s neck made an elegant shape from throat to ear, prominently displayed because Malfoy’s face was angled away—a sharp jaw, a distinct lack of cheekbone, and Harry wanted Malfoy to look at him. He wanted to see the look of triumph Malfoy had given him when they had sparred, but he didn’t know why. He didn’t know why he wanted Malfoy to smile, his eyes bright with pleasure, his face flushed with exhilaration.
Harry almost felt chuffed—but didn’t, since it was Malfoy. Malfoy added a drop of Wood-Eye Lye to the mixture, then added another to the berries mixed with seaweed and dragon pus, and then yet another drop to the black powder and bones.
“I know.”  Draco stopped touching him.  “You always—are you okay?”
“Yes.”
’s standing right here,” Harry said, annoyed.
Harry’s hand froze on his coffee mug. Possibly Teddy should be corrected, but Harry didn’t want to talk about how Malfoy was in love with him, and this was pity, Harry realized. He felt humiliated for Malfoy because he pitied him. Harry almost felt compassion for him, the way he had for Snape, the way he had for Voldemort, the way Harry had for Malfoy sixth year, when Malfoy was so helpless and afraid. At least Malfoy being in love with him meant Malfoy was consistent in attempting the impossible.
Yin, who was in the middle of a sip, quickly gulped, then wiped their mouth. “What, in a bad way?”
“Can I use it?” Harry said, feeling excited about getting to do magic again.
“I should have fixed the de-ageing by now.  You were depending on me to fix it.”
“But I’ve said—I’ve said I don’t care.  About you.”
is the best,” Malfoy said, as they began to climb.
Harry didn’t know this spell, but it came and made space inside him, stretching him not with pressure but with emptiness. It was almost shocking, how empty he felt, the muscles of his rim suddenly too lax, the tightness inside too loose. He felt as though he’d already been fingered, and the fingers had just been swiftly removed. “Oh,” Harry heard himself say, and his voice was small.
Harry couldn’t help himself.  “You took Crabbe and Goyle under your wing?”
Not going back to Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia sounded nice.  Draco was nice, except if he had really liked Harry, Harry would’ve been able to stay the age he was, when they were friends, instead of being thirty-one, when they weren’t.  “What about the bad man?” Harry said, as Draco sat down next to him.  “The one my parents stood up to?  Did he get—incarcerated?”
“Thank you,” Harry said.
He couldn’t breathe. He couldn’t move, and he couldn’t breathe. He couldn’t breathe; he couldn’t breathe; he couldn’t—
“I wish I’d known how much you’d thought about that kind of thing at this age,” Harry said, reaching for another piece of tape.  “Things might have turned out differently.”
Harry spared him a glance over his glasses. It wasn’t a very nice glance at all.
; Harry blocked these, then tried
“That’s right.”
Harry wanted to devour him, all of him.  He thought he might do it; he thought Draco might let him.  Harry swept his tongue in and tasted the inside of Draco’s mouth, stroked Draco’s tongue with his own.  Draco made another surprised sound, high-pitched and needy in the back of his throat.  Draco was holding on as though for dear life, but kept letting Harry press deeper and deeper, opening up for him, soft and pliant and everything Draco usually was not.
“What the fuck made you think I’d keep my promise?”
“It’s got double wards in case there are accidents,” Harry explained. Opening the door, he walked into the room. “You should take off your robe.”
“But I didn’t.”  Harry crossed the room to the table, partly because he still sort of thought he might get in trouble, but mostly because he hadn’t got in trouble at all, yet.
“So,” Harry said.  “Will you go to the Leaky with me?”
Draco shuddered, and Harry wrapped his arms around him, Apparating him upstairs.
The resultant flat was even smaller than Harry had imagined, a little hallway off one side for a kitchen, a hallway on the other side with what Harry guessed was the bedroom and loo. The middle room had a wall full of shelves stuffed with books and knickknacks. The other wall had one soft chair and one wood chair, the wood chair pulled up to a small table. The sofas, Harry supposed, had been made from the soft chair, which now had snapped back to its usual size. It looked rather worse for wear, but it was covered in a comfortable-looking knit blanket.
“I’ve got to leave for a bit,” Harry said, trying to make it sound as though he were going nowhere special and that Draco would not be in danger if left alone.
still interested in Rune? How did it make Malfoy feel, knowing that the bloke who had dumped him was dancing with the bloke Harry had dumped? But that shouldn’t matter—it shouldn’t matter that Vinicius was Harry’s ex. Everyone dated everyone’s ex; this world was incestuous; there were twelve people in it—where was Malfoy? Harry turned to find him.
They moved in sync across the floor because Harry could anticipate what Malfoy would do, how he would move, and Malfoy could anticipate him. Each movement was a response to the last, physically coordinated and exhilarating. The only difference was that this was collaboration, instead of antagonism; creation, instead of destruction. Malfoy knew Harry’s body, Harry realized, and it made his heart beat so hard that he was afraid Malfoy would feel the sweat of his palms. They had never been this close before, except when they were sparring.
“You wouldn’t dare.”
“Careful,” Harry told the Whisper Wire.
Harry brushed his hand over Draco’s arse again and Draco made a soft, needy little sound, hot lips catching against Harry’s again in an almost clumsy way, as though Draco couldn’t help himself. When Harry stroked him again, Draco shivered, trembling against him. “Harry,” Draco whispered into his mouth. “Harry.”
Harry followed him with relief. “A thousand is a bit much. Maybe only six or seven hundred years.”
“Cake?”  For the first time, Harry became aware of the profound emptiness in his stomach.  It chose that moment to growl.
“Minerva threw him up there,” Draco said.  “Twisted and injured, he tried to find his way out of the northern sky, but he froze instead.”
“Why, is it ticklish?”
“So now you’re telling me you didn’t skip class?”
“But—why?”
Malfoy stayed where he was. After a long moment, he washed his face, drying it with a fluffy towel by the sink. Then he put his head down.
“Magical nuns are very powerful,” Malfoy said primly, looking more than ever like a nun in his high collar.
“What do you need to check?” Harry asked, going with Draco up the worn front steps.
Draco had talked like that to Savage, and he’d sort of talked like that to Harry when Harry had first de-aged.  He hadn’t really talked to him like that since, though, and it rather took Harry aback.
“He’s in Slytherin,” Draco went on.  “
“That’s because you’re a
Harry squeezed the bench some more, distracting himself from the way heat began to claw into his face again, from the way breathing became difficult once more.
“Draco,” Harry said, rushing after him.
Penelope snorted. “I know what Spragg’s capable of.”
work?” Draco snarled.
“I’ll clear the table,” Andromeda volunteered.  Picking up their dishes with her wand, she moved over to the sink.
Draco glanced up at Harry, startled.  “I thought it was a sandwich.”
Malfoy looked miserable. “They just . . . they all just discovered magic, Harry, and what if someone thinks they can fly, or a fight’s broken out? And Astoria, she’s by herself out there—I mean, with Gareth, Achar, and Bennet, of course, but what if there are NDEs, and it’s true what Rune’s said about magical medicine. What if there are broken bones we could cure, or how are we even going to regulate all the people who want magical remedies for—”
“I guess,” Harry said, because Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia seemed upset if he felt anything at all, but Draco seemed as though he had been saying Harry should be afraid.
“Malfoy,” Harry called, as the trainees were filing out of the classroom, Malfoy pretending as if he was part of the mass exodus so he could escape with them. “We’re going to talk. Remember?”
Malfoy flushed, dropping his eyes back down, and Harry realized what he’d said.
“But you’re much more fixated on how the game is played than winning, and that’s quite Gryffindorish.”
“And you say you’re not a purist.”
“I wasn’t.”  Harry wished he could hold Draco’s hand at least.  “I was . . . I didn’t know what the spell did.”
“Why didn’t you just bring these potions back to my lab?”
“He’s twice the man you’ll ever be,” Harry said, because it was true.
It had been a long time since Harry had had to concentrate this hard to cast a Patronus.
“Yes, but when have you started eating anything so posh,” Hermione wanted to know. “I thought you survived on curry.”
“No—at least.  Not that I know of.”  Harry hadn’t noticed one when he’d Polyjuiced into Draco, but he’d been eleven, and probably hadn’t noticed a lot of things.  He certainly hadn’t looked under any of his clothes, so Harry had no idea of what Draco’s body looked like, other than what he remembered from when they were both the proper age.
“Did you need something?” Draco placed a bookmark in the pages of his book with the same precise care that his adult self always did it.  “You could have said.”
“Immaculo,” Draco told the dildo, and it was immediately stripped clean. Then he pointed the wand at Harry’s face.
“Good,” Harry said, and they got started.
“How about turkey,” Harry said.  “I know how to make that.”
“Yes.  Yes, of course.”  Turning, Draco pointed his wand at the jar broken on the floor, murmuring the incantation to repair it.  Gathering itself together, the glass cracked back into shape, though the lovely clear insect wings were still all over the ground.  Pointing his wand at those, too, Draco spelled them into the jar, then put the jar back on the bench.  After picking up the beaker of muddy slime, he turned back to Harry.  “I’ve laid out clothes for you on the bed.  Remember to change into them first.  Then you can add this,” Draco said, showing Harry a single golden hair, “and drink up.”
“Probably,” Harry said, turning around to face Draco again.  “But he’s stronger and braver than you, and never bullied anyone, so that’s three points to your one.”  Draco’s face fell, and Harry regretted it instantly.  “Draco, I’m sorry.  You’re a good person.  You—if you could know the things you’ve done for me . . . I just.  It’s really hard, when you’re cruel about people that I care about.”
“No,” Harry said.  “It’s a shop.  A very reputable shop.  The best shop, I think.  It makes potions to order.”
“He did his absolute best.”
“No. Yeah. This.” Harry gestured at the hall. “Do you ever think about the house-elves that built this place? Do you ever think about why we built it? It was a stronghold against the Non-Magical World. It was us making our own government, instead of working with theirs.”
“We all fight our different battles in different ways,” said Teddy.
“Have Death Eaters returned?” yet another reporter asked.
“And I, you,” Harry said, putting out his hand. “What brings you to the UK, Mister Photsi?” he asked, after they had shaken.
parchment,” he said, holding out his hand.
“Yes.”  Mister Malfoy’s lips quirked again.  “And if I kept you in a cupboard—tell me, Potter.  Where would you put your bed?”
Once exams had begun, Harry had finally had time to find a ritual he thought would remove Malfoy’s Dark Mark. Given the dark magic involved, a strongly warded place seemed best for the procedure, and the Academy was better protected than anywhere other than Gringotts and Hogwarts. During exams, the Academy was always crawling with trainees, even in the late hours, but directly after graduation, the place cleared out fairly quickly. Harry had already explained these reasons to Malfoy, who had eagerly agreed to stay after the ceremony so that Harry could remove his Mark.
Kavika smiled. “That’s so good Harry,” she said, in her gravelly voice. “And what do you want for yourself?”
,” Draco said.  “Haven’t you understood any of this?  Potter.  If you—you who are rich and famous and as good as pure-blood, and the most celebrated wizard of our time—and for some reason you wanted to be with me, and we had a stork brought us a miracle pure-blood baby so that my mum could have the pure-blood grandchildren she’d always wanted—don’t you understand?  That still wouldn’t be enough, because I’d be with a man.  She’d still think someone was wrong with me; she’d still worry that I wasn’t happy, and she’d still blame herself, because she—she dressed me up when I was a child, and she let me put on her cosmetics.”
“I know,” Harry said heavily. “It’s just—this is why I left the Aurors. Shite like this. You go to the people who are
“Ah.”  Malfoy’s face began to cloud over.
“But Muggles aren’t people!”
“I don’t know how it happened.”  Draco flapped his hands.  “I don’t know why he likes me!”
“I want you to sleep in a bed,” Harry said, as they came into a bedroom.
Draco took his hand away.  “I appreciate,” Draco began, but his voice was rough.  He cleared his throat.  “I appreciate the chance to know you better, Harry.  I feel like I didn’t—understand before.”
“No,” Harry said. “I’m good now. Did you,” he started, then began again. “Did you cast a Notice-Me-Not on the men’s?”
“Maybe the second time around, yeah.”
Ron was still on the force, which was one of the main reasons Harry still wanted to come. Molly, Arthur, and Andromeda usually spent the evening with the kids, but Teddy was at a different party, and Harry saw Hermione and Ron so rarely without the children. While Harry loved Hugo and Rose, the conversation with adults was different, and sometimes he still missed the days when it was just the three of them against the world.
Harry just stared at him. Malfoy didn’t even have the grace to look ashamed of himself, though colour had popped back into his cheeks. When Harry spoke, his voice sounded as worn and exhausted as he felt from these past few weeks of reporters and stress and Aurors hating him and Teddy not speaking to him, without any of Vinny’s home-cooked meals. “Is that really the conversation we’re having now? Really?”
“It means not as interesting.”  Opening the book, Draco put his arm around him after all.
“And was that a good thing?”
This was also the reason being Malfoy’s instructor in that same subject was so difficult. Failing a trainee was much more difficult when you suspected yourself of being in love with him.
Teddy nodded. “You know, there are rumours.”
“I have a whole cauldron of it,” Malfoy said.  “Heloise can bring you whatever you need.”
“I’m not doing any—”
That wasn’t the person Malfoy was now. That didn’t change Harry’s scars, his memories, or his nightmares.
“I love you so much.”  Harry couldn’t help squeezing him.
The Dementors emerged like slow smoke, coiling out of the trunk in slowly growing waves of shadow. Their hoods slowly tuned, taking in the room, as though taking in its scents.
,” Draco said, then pushed him.
While there was nothing Harry wanted to talk about less than Draco Malfoy’s sexuality, he merely said, “No.”
At first, he thought the bed must be Dudley’s.  One time when Harry had been forgot at home he had snuck up to Dudley’s bed to see what sleeping in one was like, only—this felt different.  Cracking open his eyes, Harry felt around for his glasses, which were folded on a chest of drawers beside the bed.  When Harry put them on, he saw a silver fox.
Malfoy’s eyes doubled in size and he looked strangely hungry, shoulders tight and hunched but still looking up at Harry, as if waiting for any drop that Harry could give.
“If I told you,” Malfoy said, “it wouldn’t be confidential. Come along.”
“Still no manners, I see,” Draco said, presumably because Harry was just standing there with the door open, staring.
Duggins looked up, his eyes very young and bright.
“Er,” Harry said.  Carefully, he set his fork down.  “Are you sure you were meant to tell me that?”
, hold the Floo, call the press, bring in the Aurors; he couldn’t even—
“They got to you, didn’t they,” Malfoy said.
blood purists, instead of old ones?”
“Right,” Harry agreed, “but I haven’t seen the magic you could do when you were eleven in twenty years.”
Bickford, Pillwickle, and Greengrass all slowly turned their green faces toward him. “This is a private meeting of the board,” said Greengrass, his voice as cool and disinterested as always.
“You didn’t even want to come here in the first place,” Harry said, exasperated now as well as worried.
“Yes, well.  I’m about to
“Does what?”
“Why should I?”
“I loved her,” Draco said.  “I loved her, and I loved you; don’t you see?  I loved you, and I thought—I thought if I couldn’t—I couldn’t
The chair remained half-burnt and flameless.  Draco had set fire to something else, Harry realized, spinning again to find the table on fire.  “
“I’ll—I’ll see myself out, shall I?”  Malfoy stumbled over his words.  “I know the way.  I hope that—that indicator solution works out.”
Malfoy had five Bores, which would allow five Aurors to infiltrate the NDE meeting at Windermere Hall. They would only Apparate, however, once evidence of criminal activity had been secured, either through Malfoy’s Insight Contacts or Hearing Raid. Malfoy was also wearing a Whisper Wire, which was a small ring inside his ear, charmed with a spell that linked it to a separate Wire in the Auror Department. This separate Wire was Harry’s. When he spoke into it, Malfoy would hear Harry’s voice in his ear. The Insight Contacts, shaped like contacts and fitting over the eyes, were magically linked to a large glass dome, called the Insight Contact: Wizard Unifying Transmitter/Uber Conductor—IC:WUT/UC for short—which would show them what Malfoy saw. The Hearing Raid was an Extendable Ear Spello-taped under Malfoy’s shirt. The other half of the Extendable Ear was linked to a gramophone horn in the Auror Department, so everyone could hear what Malfoy heard.
“Sugar,” Malfoy said. “Hydration.”
“You know me.” Sounding so miserable, Malfoy came closer. “You know me; Harry. You’ve always known me. Better than I know myself; you—” Malfoy reached out.
“I’m surviving. Besides, who doesn’t want to talk to Harry Potter?” But Malfoy was looking at Rune, his eyes warmer and his face softer than Harry had ever seen it. “I just wanted to see if I could bring you anything. Food? Champagne? Embarrassing stories about Hogwarts?” Malfoy waved his fingers at Harry, exactly as though they had been somehow schoolboy rivals, instead of a bully and his victim.
When Savage reported having seen Harry in the Auror Office, Vance had broken into Grimmauld Place in hopes of stealing evidence that would lead Harry to the warehouse, not knowing Harry had already been.  Savage had left out the fact that Draco had been with Harry, because Vance had only commanded her to tell him about Harry.
“Not if you don’t,” Teddy said. Harry thought about whether he wanted to talk about it, but after a minute, Teddy went on. “Some people say if Draco Malfoy can be an Auror the war is ‘truly behind us.’”
“Did he get fitter, though,” Vinicius said. “That’s the question.”
“How very nice for you.” Malfoy’s sarcasm was thick. “Not all of us have kept the same friends we had at eleven, Potter.”
“You’re
“But I didn’t really—Draco said the brave man didn’t—he didn’t really
In a room full of people, the amount of oxygen slowly dwindled as people breathed in oxygen and released carbon dioxide. Harry could feel his lungs struggling, his heart beating harder as though to compensate, heat beginning to press at his temples, squeezing slowly.
Rainy April extended into the longer days of May. Harry was glad of shorter evenings, which meant less time tossing and turning, trying to find sleep. It felt more respectable coming to work with the dawn rather than before it, and the final week of exams found him in his office before the campus was swarmed with trainees.
“I think I wasn’t . . . exciting enough for him. I was—you know; I was ‘Harry Potter’; he thought it was going to be action and adventure. Instead . . . I like to sit in the mornings and drink coffee. I like to be quiet.”
“Draco.”  Harry’s voice felt raw.  “I can’t.”
When Harry finally got the bottle open, however, the pink powder inside immediately whooshed up into his face.  Funny.  The powder hadn’t looked very mobile.  Swallowing a sigh and hoping the powder wasn’t going to make his skin fall off or his nose turn inside-out, Harry spelled the powder off his face and back into the bottle.  At least the powder hadn’t made him blind or stop breathing—yet.  As usual, the Auror Office was empty this time of night, so no one else had been exposed to the powder, and Harry figured it best to go to Malfoy and find out whether Harry was going to grow lizard skin.
“Can’t you just come with me?”
“Congratulations,” Kavika said. “You’re a wizard, Harry.”
at me.”
“Will it hurt anyone?” asked a blonde woman, covered in freckles.
“Just to reiterate,” Andromeda said from behind her paper, “no vampire koalas.”
“Like what things?”
“Organized,” Harry said, just to make conversation.
“Cornelius generalizes,” Pillwickle said. He was a long, lean man with a long, lean face, sagging like a bag holding rather too much in the jowls. His smooth, silky voice always seemed to belie his wrinkles. “We rather mean the bias against a . . . particular sort of pure-blood.”
“You aren’t—”
This seemed to break Malfoy out of it. Deliberately, he turned away from Harry. “Thanks, Weasley.”
“Right.”  Malfoy drew himself up, tossing his head a bit.  “I’ll bet Vance is just jealous.  Admittedly, he has a lot to be jealous of.”  Then he added, in his most priggish voice, “Thank you for the warning, Auror Potter.”
“I’m hoping I’ll find a better boyfriend, obviously,” said Vinicius.
“Let me guess,” Draco said, leaning back from the cup of juice.  Harry let him go.  “Gryffindor still wins House Cup.”
“She’s not a trainee.”
“And then there’s Vance,” Harry said.
“Right. And I had to quit my band to go to Academy.” Looking off thoughtfully into space, Teddy gave his slow nod, then looked back at Harry, abruptly focusing. “Are we good?”
Harry was too tired to be annoyed.  “Try me.”
“Mm.”
Harry touched the writing, all those careful letters.
“I’ve disappointed people.”
insecurity, and feeling bad about not being recognized for something you hadn’t earned in the first place had never resonated with Harry to begin with.
Looking back up at Teddy, Harry met mirror images of his eyes and wondered if this was what his looked like—a little too intense to keep eye contact for long. Harry kept it anyway. “It’s your decision. The Academy. We don’t need to talk about that anymore. I meant we could talk about—the classes. What you’re looking forward to. That sort of thing.”
“This?” Yin looked around too, as though another smoothie might materialize. “I’m sure there is. Glass!” they barked, which was how they Accio’d. Another jar floated into their hand, and they stood. “Never Accio a smoothie,” they added, digging through the detritus on the sidebar to find the old blender. “I learned that the hard way.”
“Why?”
“Don’t what?”
, and everything went back to its normal colour, lit by the burnished gold of the fire and candles still lit around the room.
, Harry wanted to say. I don’t have any feelings. I don’t have any feelings. I don’t have any feelings.
They brought Alby in for questioning, which clarified a lot of things.  Robards had been involved, but only in turning a blind eye.  He’d assigned all the cases of illegal brews that had come across his desk but never encouraged pursuit of where the brewers were getting their ingredients.  Whenever anything got close to Alby, Robards simply turned it over to the Department of Mysteries, where Hermione found one Unspeakable responsible for covering up anything that could trace back to Alby.  Robards and the Unspeakable were put on suspension pending further investigation.
Thinking he knew what Draco was remembering, Harry sent the towel back to the kitchen.  “That kiss?” he asked.
“You’re not studying for your other exams,” Harry told him later that night, while they were reviewing possible positions for the Ward Bores.
“But,” Harry said.  “For diamonds?”
Harry usually came to stay at Rombe Pickle in late August, before the start of the terms at both the Academy and Hogwarts. This year the visit had a different flavour, as Teddy had graduated Hogwarts.
“I’m not—”  Draco cut himself off with a huff.  “Who wants to dry hump you anyway,” he said, turning away.  “I don’t even care.”
featured Draco as well, this time with the exclusive story of how he’d become younger through a potions accident involving the recently uncovered (shocking!) illegal potions supply ring (more on page eleven).  Draco told the reporter (not Jordan this time, but Susan Bones, which Harry found just as pleasing) how he had been helping Harry when the accident happened, and how he had managed to develop a cure.  He didn’t say anything about Harry turning young, which Harry appreciated, although Harry wasn’t actually sure whether Draco was doing it for Harry.  Since Draco had neglected to mention Harry’s de-ageing, Draco could make it sound like he’d devised the whole cure at the age of eleven, which made everyone think he was a genius.
“I told you,” Harry said.  “I’m not arresting him.  I—he’s helping me,” he went on, desperate for the crying to stop.  “Malfoy’s helping me with something.”
“It’s not so I can be bigger.”
“It wouldn’t be the first time a pure-blood married a pure-blood even though they were in love with someone else.” Ron’s voice was gentle. “Sometimes it works out. Over time. Malfoy might . . . get over it.”
Thinking he would talk to Teddy when Teddy was a little freer, Harry looked around for Ron, who appeared to be trapped in a conversation with Gardenia Greengrass. “He and I have very important business to discuss,” Harry told Greengrass, pulling Ron’s arm.
“You are a normal person,” Harry said, his aggravation so reflexive that he didn’t even notice he was calling Malfoy normal.  “Vance is just a ponce.”
Really angry.
“You don’t have to,” Harry said quickly.
“Have it, Potter. Not everything is symbolic, you know. It doesn’t have to mean anything.” Malfoy pushed the cup against Harry’s hand, and not quite willingly, Harry took it. “I do so enjoy our chats,” Malfoy said, then headed out toward the corridor.
“I’ve a subject to bring up,” said Penelope to the instructors of the Auror Academy seated around the table. “Draco Malfoy.”
,” Draco said, tugging at Harry’s robes.
“You mean white pure-bloods?” Harry said.
Capping the cream, Harry put it on the table beside him.
As Harry shifted, Draco’s arm tightened around Harry, drawing him in.  Turning his head against Draco’s chest to check Draco’s expression, Harry saw that Draco was still just looking into the fire.  He didn’t look bothered at all, so Harry tucked his head back in.
“I was wrong,” Harry said again, stepping toward him.
“Harry?”
Draco leaned back on the couch again, falling so quiet during this story that Harry was half sure Draco had fallen asleep.  As soon as Harry was done, however, Draco shot up, a bit of hair falling over his forehead.  “I’ve never seen a swamp-thing,” he said.  “Are they big?”
“Look!  Auror Potter, look!”  Malfoy was excitedly looking over his shoulder at Harry, his wand held aloft.  A feather was floating in the air about a foot from it.  “I did it!  I did
Once Harry was done with the number, he put the mobile up to his face like a real telephone, hoping to hear it ring.  When it didn’t, he took it away from his face, and then saw the little green telephone picture under the numbers.  Harry tried touching it.  Hearing the mobile make a bit of a sound, he put it to his face again.
Vinicius made a noise. “I didn’t mean Rune Photsi levels of hot, Harry. Let’s at least be realistic.”
“Not yet.”
Draco was already starting to get on the bed on top of the covers, so Harry budged over as much as he could.  “Read it to me,” Draco said, picking up the book again and handing it to Harry.
They went on like that, Malfoy describing his pills and potions, making Harry drink things and eat things and stick out his tongue, then dip his fingers in things.  Harry didn’t have anything else to pay attention to, so he paid attention to Malfoy.  In Harry’s memories from Hogwarts, Malfoy’s voice was nasal and annoying, but it wasn’t.  Though it was light and quick and pleasant to listen to, it also had a low timbre layered under it that made his voice quite resonant, almost hypnotic.  And Malfoy’s eyes were a striking colour.  Like sickles, Harry thought, and felt worse than ever.  His nose was dripping.
“I’ll hurt
“I wonder what that feels like.” Another pause settled around the room, filling the shadows the light was vacating. “I see,” Malfoy said abruptly. “You could never not be Harry Potter. I’m sorry for suggesting it.” Then he walked forward, grabbing the badge so that Harry had to flail to grab a hold so that Malfoy didn’t port without him.
“Ooh!” squealed Bickford. “Yes! He should be expelled! He should be expelled!”
September passed in a blaze of bright blue skies full of leaf stars, bursting into supernovae of yellow, red, and orange. Harry’s new therapist was an American woman named Alexis Milligan, who had moved to the UK to be with her husband three years prior. A tall, thin woman with blond hair and brown eyes, Doctor Milligan seemed to Harry very American, with her very large earrings and very large voice.
“Oh, yes,” Draco said, playing another card.  “They’re married.”
“What about a famous Quidditch player?”
Harry turned to Astoria. “What’s wrong with
“Should old acquaintance be forgot,” said Draco.  “That thou canst never once reflect on old long syne.”
“I didn’t make the bed,” Harry said, getting on it. “I didn’t know you would—sorry.”
“The dark artefact?”  Draco put aside the book, looking interested now.  “Where are you going?  What is it?”
Harry’s eyes jerked back to the owl—Heloise.
“I haven’t done,” said Harry.
Without another word, Malfoy turned and headed for the door.
“Perfect,” Draco whispered. “Perfect. Now, Harry. Where else would you like this prick of mine to service you?”
“You were fucking me,” Harry said. “In the fantasies.”
The tattoo wasn’t at all what Harry had expected, but he didn’t know what he had expected since Draco’s responses had suggested it probably wasn’t a heart with an arrow through it.  The only similarity to a heart was that the tattoo was red in colour, more like a scar than ink.  The image, however, was what was most startling—a skull with a snake coming out of its mouth.  It looked very cool, but even though Harry wanted to keep looking at it, he brought the sleeve down and closed the cuff button with his other hand.  Draco didn’t like it.  He probably didn’t want Harry looking at it.
“But it doesn’t look like a shop.  And I haven’t seen any customers.”
The mind-control was a potion, Harry concluded.  The other cases he’d connected to Ludville, Vance, Savage, and the illegal potions ring had to do with potions; they involved some fairly powerful brews.  Ever since former Death Eaters had been sentenced to magical restrictions, potions had arisen as an alternative to magic.
Nyala had said.
“Forgiving you isn’t what I’m trying to do.”
“That’s right,” Harry said quickly.  “I never much liked studying.  It’s—I don’t like it.”
, Harry thought, but instead he Summoned a chocolate and gave it to Penelope, as Malfoy had once done for him.
Draco didn’t say anything.  When Harry glanced up at him, Draco was staring into the fire, and Harry couldn’t help the impression he’d made Draco sad.  “Draco?” Harry asked.
“It must be expensive, then,” Draco said approvingly.
“You don’t need me to,” Malfoy said, quite simply.
“I hope you don’t say things like that when you come to me for potions ID,” Draco murmured.
, Harry was going to say, but he didn’t know.  He didn’t know who he was when he grew up—a policeman who wasn’t friends with Draco.  For the first time, it occurred to Harry that he didn’t know what he was capable of.
Harry heard himself cry out, his hips twitching on the bed.
,” Harry said, moving closer.  Maybe he hadn’t been paying attention; maybe something was actually wrong.
“What are you talking about?  He was rubbish.”  But Draco blushed.
Draco looked so troubled that Harry at last understood what he was saying.  Harry took a step back, putting more green grass between himself and Draco.  “You said it wasn’t normal.  You said only toddlers did it.”
“About to have our fourth.” The Order meetings were going well. That wasn’t exactly what he wanted to talk about.
“Harry—”
“I spoke to Aunt Petunia,” Harry heard himself say.
“Why on earth would undressing with a spell be impolite?”
“We’re all fellow human beings,” said Teddy. “It’s easy to forget. Also, Draco likes Critical Stink, so that’s cool.”
“Harry.”  Mister Malfoy’s voice was low.  “Has anyone ever punished you for doing magic?”
“Maybe you were afraid because—”
This was becoming a common refrain.  “Right,” Harry agreed, standing up, “but I’m knackered, and I’m going to bed.  We’re going to start your cure once the twelve hours are up, so you might want to get some rest before we do.”
“I’m going to the loo!” Harry shouted, stomping over to the hall with the stairs.  “I don’t understand why it’s all the way upstairs!” he added, just because he felt really angry for no reason.
“What?” Mister Malfoy said, surprised.  “You still want—”  Breaking off at the look on Harry’s face, Mister Malfoy stopped, then cut a big slice.  “Of course,” he said, floating the slice over to Harry’s cake plate.
“Penelope,” said Harry, still smiling. “Have a chocolate.”
; Harry didn’t see how he could be this obsessed with marriage.
“And he’s not yet taken the examination.” Fudge was also talking via Floo, though come to think of it, the green didn’t make his complexion look that different.
“I meant,” Harry said.  “I know you weren’t.  I just meant . . .”
Travers’s boggart was a normal looking person in odd-looking clothes—someone he knew, probably, and Harry found himself thinking again about Malfoy’s boggart.
“Do you want to know how good it feels in my hand?” Harry said, stroking it.
“Draco,” Harry said, after this had gone on three minutes at least.
“Yes,” said a new voice.
“Shh,” Draco said, but he brought up his hand to cover his face.  “I knew I shouldn’t have . . .”
“Er,” said Harry. “No.”
Harry had been going for more bacon, but now he froze again.  “Fly?” he asked, his mouth full of scone.
A lick of flame flickered to blue, but after a moment, went back to yellow-orange.
“I don’t care if you come.” Draco’s voice was hushed, eager. “Use my body to feel good. Harry.” Draco’s hand was wandering down, wrapping around Harry’s cock. “Do you want me to use my mouth on it?”
“Er,” Harry said, holding up his belt and trying not to trip over the robe thing as he slowly backed away from the glass.  “Where’s this?”
“Besides,” Draco said.  “They’ve got to do well, haven’t they?  Us pure-bloods have to stick together, or mongrels will take over the earth.”
But Draco didn’t say anything else, and the fire crackled in the hearth.  “
Over the next few days, Harry spent more time at the Auror Department than he had ever wanted to spend there again, planning Malfoy’s infiltration of the meeting at Windermere Hall with several key members of the Auror Department, including Ron and Robards, as well as Malfoy himself.
“No,” Harry said. “He doesn’t want to marry her.”
“My parents are wankers,” Nyala told Harry. “I’d rather spend the end of the world with the man I love.”
“Who fears someone’s Patronus?” someone else asked.
“Right,” Harry said.  “So, come there and slum it with me, and you can think about how much better you are than all the Muggles.  You can even tell me how much better you are than all the Muggles. Just don’t tell anyone else—especially the Muggles.”
Imperius potion; I’ve—I’ve—
“I was so sure that had stopped having any effect on you.”
After another half-hour or so of flying around, they found themselves within arms’ length of the Snitch.  Harry’s arms were shorter, but he was faster.  He thought he could get it if he just—
“Doesn’t sound like I’m ahead, according to you.”
“Fuck,” Harry said.
said I could be discreet.  Mother was afraid I couldn’t do it.”
The man was Malfoy, of course. In a worn, over-sized jumper, with a ten galleon grin, a gorgeous woman on his arm, and a veritable little army of young people spilling into the pub behind him, he wasn’t immediately recognizable. “Party’s started,” Malfoy announced to the entire pub. Most of the pub cheered.
“I have to stay in a radius.  It said in the ledger.  And I want to make sure you’re okay.”
“No. Obviously not. You don’t dance with trainees. But if you did, that would certainly be a way of showing Greengrass, wouldn’t it?”
“Why would I—?”
“Oh. Well. I’m alive.” Harry felt himself began to fidget. Forcing himself to think about the question, he made his hands stop. “Actually, not so good. It’s just . . . the nightmares. Sometimes they’re better. Sometimes they’re worse.”
“All right,” Harry said, wrapping his hand around Malfoy’s arm.  He pointed his wand. “Brace yourself.”
“Really?” Malfoy reared back.
“No, you’re not.”
“Who is your friend?” asked a teenager, covered in tattoo.
Harry barely remembered Adrian Pucey, Chaser for the Slytherin Quidditch team.  He’d been two years ahead of them and rather good looking, now that Harry was thinking about it.  He’d been tall.  Black-haired.  “What happened to Blaise Zabini?” Harry asked.
“Then don’t kiss me,” Draco grouched.  “It’s very distracting.”
“Seventy-three.”
Taking the wand, the man seemed to look it over.  “Harry Potter’s got his eye on you,” he said, handing the wand back to Harry.  “Don’t even think about causing trouble.”
Beginning to feel uncomfortable, Harry turned to Malfoy. “Malfoy, is this going to be—”
“No,” Harry said.  “I’m gay.”
!” Draco shouted, then grabbed Harry awkwardly by the wrist.  “Let’s go!”
Teddy he’d had them, and Harry wondered whether Draco would ever have volunteered anything like that to Harry.
“So guitar-lifting is a sports discipline for Aurors?”
“Can’t you . . .”
“So, I need to find out who has access to those trees,” Harry said.
Harry realized he had been looking at Malfoy, and quickly turned to the apparition. “Why were you put inside the tree?”
“Will they miss him?” Kavika asked.
“Look at you.” Malfoy rocked against him insistently, his body hot and heavy—Harry was still bound, he realized. “It’s been a while since you’ve been fucked, hasn’t it?”
“Oh.”  Tapping the cabinet with the wand, Harry said, “
Draco shuddered at the name, but then let out a loud “Ha!”, this time in triumph.  “You’re wrong.  You killed him!  You said so—you killed him!”
“You wanted me to fuck you?”
“Mm,” said Doctor Yin. “He advanced to Level Two. Is that right? I read something about that. I’m thinking of the right person, aren’t I? The Old Blood Death Eater one? Disowned? Gay? Blond? Tall? In Auror Academy? I’ve been out of the country.”
“Are you going to teach a potions class?”  Harry said, gesturing at the stocks of supplies under the tables.
“Er.”  Harry definitely remembered.  When he’d been searching for someone besides Malfoy who could help him with the Wood-Eye Lye, Mrs. Mulpepper had been eager to assist.  She had also been fantastically bad at it, pouring things in and out of the Wood-Eye Lye for an hour before Harry had realized she had no idea what she was doing.
“Yes.”
“Shit.”  Harry opened the door wider.  “Come in.”
“Harry.” Draco ripped his lips away, panting heavily. His brow pressed into Harry’s, mouth still close enough for Harry to taste Draco’s breath.
“Well,” Harry said.  “You’ve done it.”
“After a fashion.”
“You’re just going to let them use him?” Harry asked, feeling defeated.
That seemed a little unusual. How long had it been? Fifteen minutes? Maybe half an hour.
Harry didn’t know how he was meant to communicate with all the years and history between them, with everything Harry knew that Malfoy had experienced and seen.  When Harry had been a child and Draco had been the adult, Draco had known just what to do.
Malfoy frowned at him.  “I still think I should be allowed to read it.  I wrote it, after all.  Say, why are we here anyway?  It doesn’t look at all like the clubs or expensive restaurants where I imagine we usually hang out.  I imagine we have a box at Ilkley Moor Stadium.  We have a box at Oberon’s Theatre as well.”  He looked around.  “Wait a minute—is this where Severus lives?”
“I don’t mean anything he’s done is okay,” Harry said, realizing too late that he’d jumped in rather media res.
“Come learn to fly with me,” Draco said.  “I promise you, the shop will be all right.”
“Do you regret not making it work with Ginevra Weasley?” Milligan finally asked.
“Thank you for telling me,” Kavika said. “We’ll talk more about that as we go on.”
Many, many thanks to seraphcelene and icmezzo, without whom I would not have written this.
Harry was holding out his hand. “Dance with me.”
“You miss your mum?” Harry asked quietly.
Malfoy picked up the pot of dead flowers and—saying nothing—headed back to his seat.
“Can I talk now?” Harry said.
Draco seemed to find this highly amusing, for some reason.  “The colour indicates a positive result.  Don’t worry, Harry.  It will go back to its normal colour.”
“Draco Malfoy is a criminal,” said the first boy.
“All right,” said Doctor Yin. “Then let’s set about figuring out how to challenge you, shall we?”
“No,” Harry said, not minding, but actually rather wishing that they could get to the point.
All of the Imperius potion involved—as well as all the questioning, which involved Veritaserum—required a lot of the antidote as well as indicator solution for Wood-Eye Lye.  Draco spent most of the interval in which he was twenty-five making potions for the Ministry.
“The rumour,” said Teddy. “That Draco’s at the Academy because old school pure-bloods want influence in the Auror force.”
“Spec?”
“Well—it is.”
Silence filled the room like a slowly expanding balloon, like Number Twelve squeezing between Eleven and Thirteen.
“If the wards come down,” Kavika said, her voice low.
The little silver bumblebee was hovering around Harry’s left shoulder. “Oh,” Harry said, only half paying attention, because Malfoy and Teddy were coming over to them. “It’s Malfoy’s.”
Harry resisted the urge to throw something.  “Yes, her, or were there other suspects parading around here saying that Auror Vance is a part of an illegal potions ring and has been making money off it for years?”
Surprise filled Malfoy’s face, followed by something almost like the beginnings of an unplanned smile.  As soon as it started, Malfoy angled his face away.  “Well.  Well—I don’t suppose you could possibly understand.  They’re all very complicated, and you’re such a dullard.”
“Right, the meetings!” Malfoy said, snapping his fingers. “When did you say the next one was? And where?”
Harry didn’t know what a verbal diversionary tactic was.  He angled his broom down as well.  “But that’s cheating!”
“What if Lionel Greengrass wanted to support Reveal?”
“Uncle.” Malfoy’s voice was rough, and then the IC:WUT/UC moved swiftly, and it was clear from the view that Malfoy was drawing close to Rodolphus Lestrange, perhaps even embracing him. “I thought you were dead.”
He wasn’t ready.
“Good.”  Harry kept his hand squeezed, then used his other hand to hold his wand to Alby’s sweating temple.  “Tell me what you’re doing to Auror Weasley.”
“I’m tired of hearing about the election,” Hermione said, by way of explanation.
31 years
“Of course not.”  Draco slumped again.  “I
“It really is a nightmare,” said the man, who fainted.
“Or it could be a curse,” Harry suggested. “He’s cursed with a stag Patronus.”
“I see,” Harry said.
“Please.” Harry could hear that he was whining, drilling his arse down against the pillow in hungry circles, as though that could get him what he needed. “Please, I love begging, I love it, I need it; I need it.”
“His absolute best looks like
“Is this the same Order of the Phoenix dropping wards around the country?” Penelope asked. “Because if so, they are terrorists. Reveal
“For heaven’s sake.  Do something for yourself, just for once.”
“I haven’t,” Harry said.  “We’re talking about Vance.”
“And we agreed they weren’t what you needed,” Kavika went on. “However, two more have come into practice since then, and I think it would be worthwhile to try either one. Additionally, I have two friends abroad. I can loan you their portkeys until you decide on who will treat you—”
Harry looked down at the parchment once more. Voldemort had put the Horcrux inside of him when he was a baby, and it had remained inside of Harry for seventeen years because it was a part of Voldemort’s soul.
The salve didn’t feel cold to Harry, but Draco’s wounds were hot, the skin around the red and inflamed.  Taking his fingers away, Harry cast a warming charm on the salve, then touched Draco again.  He mostly stayed still while Harry applied the salve, but Draco still jumped when Harry’s fingers touched his abdomen.  Glancing up to make sure he hadn’t hurt Draco, Harry met Draco’s eyes.  “It
“That’s what it is,” said Baggot. “An issue of discipline.”
“No, I meant . . . I wouldn’t. Ask that of you.”
“Thank you for informing me,” Malfoy said.  “I have no idea what I would do without you.”
“Is that how you appeared out of thin air?  And made the fire?”
Mister Malfoy looked a little sad about that answer.  “Harry.”  His voice was so slow and measured that Harry immediately tensed up.  “When you’re with your aunt and uncle, do you get enough to eat?”
“No,” Teddy said slowly.
“Is Lucius Malfoy still friends with the Supreme Mugwump?” the blonde asked Malfoy excitedly.
The wand flew out of Malfoy’s grip, but he was rushing to knock it from Harry’s own before Harry could fully catch it. Malfoy slid down, his leg sweeping out to knock down Harry as he tried to recover from Malfoy’s rush, but Harry expected this. He had taught them this, and yet then
to know, seeing as how my father is a primary donor of the Association.”
“I’ve put new clothes on the table.”  Harry turned away, ashamed for even having looked.
“Right.”  Harry took a deep breath.  “I know you hate me, Malfoy.”
Kavika waited. When Harry didn’t say anything, she said gently, “Shall I make coffee?”
“I’m sure a spider would love it.” Teddy turned seriously to the first kid. “Shrouds are what ghosts are made of.”
“Draco,” Harry said again, shaking him by the shoulder.  “Wake up.”
“I don’t mind, Harry,” Luna said. “Friends need each other. That’s what friends are for.”
Harry didn’t want to complain when he’d been given such a nice gift, but Draco knew something was wrong.  “Yours is green and silver.”
“Yes. Please.”
Years ago, in the ancient stone basement that was the Ministry of Magic, Harry had sat in a similar room around a similar table. Harry remembered it now, the claustrophobic feel of it, the feeling that no one was talking about anything that was actually happening, the feeling that he couldn’t change it, even if he tried.
“You said you were going to cast a containment field,” Harry said, encouraging.
That night, Harry Apparated to a normal street with pavement and straggly bushes on one side and a carpark on the other. On the side with the bushes was a large council estate, all concrete and windows.  He went up two storeys on a set of concrete stairs attached to the estate, then down a covered hall until he came to a door with the number 127 on it, where he stopped and knocked.
“I don’t even like Malfoy,” Harry said. “It’s on record! If I’m displaying favouritism, I’ve picked a hell of a way to do it.”
“Oh.”  Draco scowled, but the expression was directed at the floor and looked rather pensive.
Harry opened his mouth to repeat himself just as they were whooshing through the window to his office, such that, “I wanted to be with you,” sounded very loud as the broom came to a sudden stop.
“War changes you,” Harry said. “There’s no reason it shouldn’t have done, to him.”
“We’re past the subject of new applicants,” Baggot said blandly.
Draco was staring into the fire, looking troubled.  “Have I told you,” and then stopped.
“Oh,” Draco said.
“Draco,” Harry said, shifting under him, Draco sitting up on him a bit to have the leverage to use his wand.
“What,” Harry managed to say.  “What are you doing?”
Draco put his head over the side, just as Harry himself had done when he was ten.  “But it’s stupendous.  There are fish-people—I don’t think fish-people are real; they’re made-up, but I think maybe there used to be fish-people, and anyway there are mermaids, so fish-people could be real.”
The rush of energy raced through Harry again.  “This one feels the same,” Harry said.
“It’s not as if he wants him to fail either, though.” Ron stopped. “Oh, come off it, Harry. You’re the one who always used to think Malfoy was plotting something. You really think he didn’t intend for them to get him passed?”
Then again, if Harry was thirty-one, perhaps Dudley wasn’t at Privet Drive any more.  If Harry was thirty-one, then Dudley was thirty-one as well.  If the month was still June, then the year would be . . . 2012.  Even though John Major had just become Prime Minister, he was probably out.  The Mitchell brothers on EastEnders were probably dead from stroke and poisoning.  Piers Polkiss might have joined Take That, like he’d said he was going to do, and Harry didn’t know whether he had gone to Stonewall High, or what an Auror was, or what Mister Malfoy knew about his parents.
“That’s ridiculous,” Harry said, putting his arm around Draco’s shoulders.  “People are allowed to see you cry.”
“Why?” Harry asked.  They were in what seemed to be an office.  A desk stood in one corner by a window, while the opposite side had shelves full of weird odds and ends—bottles and phials, like in Draco’s laboratory, but also equipment, things that looked like microscopes and a hand mixer and possibly a nut cracker.
“I don’t know!” Draco said, even though Harry hadn’t said anything.  Draco pressed his hands against his eyelids.  “I have to shop in Muggle places—because of the restriction, and he—he always took my order for coffee, and he always smiled at me, and he was—he was nice, and funny, and he’s—fuck, he’s
“Draco.  Of course not.”
Harry again thought of the letter, those scathing words about this small child, who wanted to turn the fire blue just to impress someone he didn’t know.
“It’s
“Yes?” the man said, seeming even more confused.
“Head Auror Robards!” Alby squealed.
Mister Malfoy stared.  “Pardon?”
Harry’s voice rose.  “Then how come I don’t like you?”
Harry, feeling very bewildered, said, “Sorry.”
react if—well, they didn’t.  Obviously.  As I’m sure you know.  Father told her—well, he got her to leave off that kind of thing, I’m sure.”
he wanted to say, but it wasn’t true. There was too much to tell. “Doctor Yin is great,” he said finally.
“Is that okay?”
“Sometimes I wasn’t nice,” Harry said, after a long moment.  “There are times when you shouldn’t be.”
“Take your time,” said Kavika. “I’m here.”
“Oh, come off it,” Robards said. “He’s hardly innocent.”
Cloisters ran along the inner courtyard of Bickford-Buckley Hall, stone benches interspersed between the colonnades, but Harry chose another bench near the center of the yard. The rain was so light he almost couldn’t feel it, and here he was closer to the Timothy Tree. The bark was smooth at the base, where so many had tried and failed to scale it, and Harry felt like he could breathe the life of the wood, old and sturdy and ignorant of fleeting human lives.
Draco was silent for a long time.  “He let me know where you were,” he said finally.
“You want me to solicit bribes?  I’m a Death Eater, Potter!”
So far, Kavika and Kingsley had centred the work of the Order around helping non-magborn magical people reveal the magical world to their non-magical families. The hope was that this work would ease the way for Reveal, as all the conversations about non-magborns coming out as magical to their families had been integral to the Deal. Kingsley had demanded protections for non-magborns, as they stood to be most vulnerable as a result of Reveal, but the other side had argued the non-magborns had more protection than most, as they already had non-magical families that loved them. This argument conveniently ignored the fact that many non-magborns never told their families about their powers, or were forced to Obliviate family members to maintain the Statute.
Harry and Malfoy sat outside Wizengamot Administrative Services, where Harry realized he was hungry, and the memory was long. All of the memory was important—Parkinson’s confirmation that Travers worked with her father, the entire conversation with Travers himself. Even the opening conversation with Greengrass and the Macmillan helped to authenticate the memory and prove that it had not been tampered with, but that didn’t really help Harry feel better. His veins felt cold. His head hurt. He should have at least had a snack.
“I can tell you what happened in Diagon,” Harry said, bursting into the Chamber.
“Maybe they’re the same thing,” Luna said. “Malfoy Manor. The wizarding world.”
“Working,” the woman—Savage—said, almost too quickly.  Then belatedly, afterwards, “Obviously.”
“Take that off, too,” Harry said, nodding at Malfoy’s poofy shirt. He looked like a pirate in it, the sleeves billowy and linen so light it was practically translucent.
“We never become friends.  Do we?”
“So nothing on Ludville, then?” Harry asked, checking whether the disenchantment had worked.
“You and I don’t do Legilimens.”
, Malfoy had said.  People who saw someone wearing the powder were the ones affected.  The person wearing it wasn’t affected at all.
In the years since Harry began going to Malfoy’s flat for potions consultation, they developed a sort of rhythm.  At first, Harry viewed using Malfoy’s expertise as a stop-gap until the department could shell out for a proper research lab, or until Harry found an actual potions master who could do the job in a respectable, official way.  Eventually, Harry gave up on this idea.  Robards was displeased with the way Savage cut corners, but Harry—through four years working for the department—had learned that it was the only way to get things done, and besides, Malfoy was not an actual cut-corner.  In fact, he was a lot more respectable than most of Savage’s informants, who may or may not actively be committing crimes, and no other person could identify potions ingredients or the hidden signatures of brewers like Malfoy could.
Malfoy just gave him a look.
Harry took a quick, sharp breath. Before now, he hadn’t really been able to put the pieces together, why Teddy wanted to be an Auror, when he had always seemed so much more interested in things like music or philosophy, when he’d never seemed to like action or a fast pace. As Harry watched, Teddy’s Harry-features melted away into his own, his sharp narrow face and hair the colour of Lupin’s, eyes like Tonks. “He loves you,” was the only answer Harry could think of.
Draco sucked in a breath. “Not here.”
“Will you help me?”
, Harry wanted to say.  Instead, he said, “Robards says we can’t use former Death Eaters for consultation.”
can’t cast a Patronus.”
“No.”  Mister Malfoy waved his stick and the racing feeling ended.  “Gross,” he added, turning to his notes.
“What?”
“You really thought he would?”
“I don’t have to tell you.”
“Fair enough,” Malfoy said. “Has Edgar risen in our estimation, then?”
, or something like that, but he couldn’t think of the words.  Again, he wanted to hug him, but Draco wasn’t doing it and initiating felt so awkward.  At a loss for what else to do, Harry grabbed Draco’s hand.
“Draco!
The trainees were going wild.
“I wasn’t on your team, silly.”  Harry smiled to show he was teasing.  “I was in Gryffindor.”
“But I just want you to know.” Malfoy took another step closer after all. “When you’re waking up from nightmares, cold sweats; when you’re jumping, because Apparition is too loud, or someone casts a spell unexpectedly; when you’re panicking, because people are yelling, and it feels like they might fight. When it feels like you can’t breathe, when you don’t know what to do with your hands, when you wake up crying and you don’t know why—”
He didn’t sound like Dudley either, his voice much deeper, and yet something about the way he said “Harry” felt familiar, somehow.  Almost like Uncle Vernon.  Harry began to step out, but Mister Malfoy waved a hand, turning his back to Harry.
Harry vaguely remembered that, mostly because Draco had answered the question of what he wanted to be when he grew up years later.  “I wasn’t trying to insult you,” Harry said, spreading his hands.  “I was trying to get to know you.”
Harry laughed.
Graduation at Auror Academy was pushed to occur that day as well, so that new Aurors could be commissioned in a rush for the dropping of the wards, in case no emergency stay was granted. As many Aurors as possible would be required to control the response to the revelation of the magical world to the non-magical.
“All right,” Harry said.
“Right. Not everyone can save the world when they’re seventeen.” Abruptly, Teddy stood and began clearing dishes—by hand, instead of with magic, presumably so that he could move out of Harry’s sight, over to the sink.
“You don’t count.” George turned away from her. “You’ve got a low bar, obviously. Hermione, do you think—”
“I don’t feel anything.”
Harry wanted to leave his body, the hot tug of blood in his cheeks, his hot breath, sweat beginning at his under arms. He imagined himself somewhere colourless, cool, gray—like a Penseive, inside a memory. As soon as he pictured this, he remembered another table, another time.
“Oh,” Malfoy breathed, apparently becoming aware of it at the same time. “Was there something else you require, Harry?” Then he moved his hips, dragging his arse against Harry’s trousers.
Heading toward the exit, Harry slipped outside. The April night clung muggy against his skin, humidity sinking into his clothes. He couldn’t seem to catch a fresh breath of air. Malfoy didn’t come to join him.
re-admitting Malfoy.”
“Unlucky?  Because you talked to a snake and helped it escape?  Harry.  You weren’t unlucky.  You were
Kavika went over to the table, arranging the coffee things. “Did you?” she asked, as she pointed her wand to boil the water in the teapot. “Feel gratitude?”
A sudden crack filled the big room—like the sound they made whenever they pushed through cold darkness into another place.
“Potter, it’s okay,” Mister Malfoy said.  “It’s okay.  Shhh—you’re okay.”  Then Mister Malfoy was touching him, a warm hand on his shoulder, and Harry wasn’t sure why.  Maybe it was so he could stop shaking enough to drink the orange liquid in the phial, so Harry drank it.  The shaking stopped, and Harry could breathe again, the pressure on his lungs easing.  The hand stayed on him anyway, touching his hair, smoothing down against his neck, over his shoulder, then starting up in his hair again.  It felt very nice.
“Of course, he does.”
“Better than Weasley.”
I was more like him.”
“So, I’m going to set up the fireworks,” Ron said, looking very gracious and likeable, next to his brothers, who were trolls. “If you want to help me, Harry.”
“Yes.”  Draco looked away.
he couldn’t. He couldn’t think. Not just now. Not yet. He couldn’t look between them, at her. Not yet. Breathe, he told himself. In through the nose; out through the—“But I can’t,” he began, then stopped. He hadn’t meant to speak.
“What?” Malfoy snapped.
Harry dipped his thumb in, but nothing happened.
“I don’t want you to be good like me. I want you to be good like you.”
Looking thoughtful, Ron shoved his hands into the pockets of his robe. “I wonder what he said to them.”
“Yes.”
“I’m not obtuse,” Harry said, obtusely.  “I can clean.  And I can cook very well.  I’m not very messy or very loud.  I can do the washing up, and sweep, and—and anything you want, really.”
Harry sat.
Kavika laughed. “That makes one of us.”
“I miss . . .” Draco’s voice caught oddly.
“What do you think?”
After Sectumsempra, Harry had had to have detention with Snape.  He’d missed the final Quidditch match, but Gryffindor had won anyway.  Harry had gone into the common room and they’d all been celebrating; Ginny had rushed to him with her eyes lit up. Harry had kissed her.
,” Draco sobbed.  He didn’t shake Harry off.  If anything, he leaned into it a bit.
31 years
Harry nodded. He hadn’t mentioned Malfoy since their first meeting.
“Like what?” asked Ron, sounding interested.
“You can’t kick me out,” Malfoy said, his voice still quick. “I was admitted. My application was approved.”
“Oh,” Harry said, surprised, because he had already stopped thinking about Vinicius. Was he really going to try to get in Malfoy’s pants? Harry looked around to see if he could find them.
“Did you enjoy your birthday?” Nyala asked Andromeda, as George and Angelina rolled away into the Floo.
“Oh,” said Kavika. “I thought you said you’d have them removed if they spoke of your years at school. During the war.”
Not just sometimes, Harry was thinking.  Draco wasn’t saying he fucked men occasionally.  He was saying he had a boyfriend, which meant he likely did it on the regular.  He did it enough that he didn’t want to kiss Harry, even though Draco had to know he and his boyfriend were on a different timeline than the present, which meant it wasn’t cheating—unless.  Unless Draco and his boyfriend were still together, in the present, now.  Harry didn’t actually have any way of knowing; Draco never told him anything; Draco could be
? No-Deal Reveal would result in mass
“Never mind,” Hermione said. “Hugo was meant to sweep. He thought he could cheat and use his flying broom; it’s frightened Ganymede. “How was your therapy?”
? You think they
“Mmm.” Harry thrust back his arse, anticipating it.
No one was waiting for him at home.  Even Kreacher worked at St. Mungo’s now, and the only thing Harry ever did at Grimmauld Place was sleep and wish he could go back to work.  Sometimes he brought work home because even the sleeping part was impossible.  It would certainly be impossible now, with this pressure against his sinuses.  As Harry began gathering his things—tucking his wand into his sleeve, his case files into a satchel—it never once occurred to him that Malfoy wouldn’t be up at this hour.  Malfoy was always up.
Malfoy’s head jerked up.
Harry knew Draco was only saying it so they could pretend like nothing had happened earlier, except Harry wasn’t sure why Draco would want to pretend that, other than that Draco did want to forget it.  And that almost made sense, because Draco was so kind and talented—he was a genius, really, with magic—except Harry had yelled at him.  He should be sent to the cupboard for several hours for that at least.  “Why are you . . .?” Harry began, but he couldn’t quite figure out what he wanted to ask.
Harry let out a low sound. Then Draco pointed his wand at his own cock, and began to sculpt it up again.
Mister Malfoy stared down at him, something strangely helpless in his expression.
The world felt like it was slowly turning upside down.  “Um,” Harry said faintly.  “I’m not sure.”
The man, who had been in the middle of shouting something else, began to dance.
“After what he did to you,” said another girl, black-haired and freckled, so young.
“You weren’t drunk,” Harry said, a bit too roughly.
Harry kept all correspondence from Malfoy in the table with the drawer beside his bed, along with the handkerchief and the paper with Malfoy’s address that Malfoy had given Harry so long ago.  Keeping these things made sense, just in case Harry forgot where Malfoy lived or had to blow his nose.  As for the correspondence, Harry might need it for a case some day to remember which potion was which, even though most of Malfoy’s notes just said things like,
“A potions shop.”
When Harry talked to Hermione, she said, “It takes a while to distil potions ingredients, Harry.”
“More like acquaintances then?” Malfoy said, sounding so casual that he was very obviously disappointed.  He was poking through the objects on the lab bench as if he already knew he lived here—running his finger along the edge of the empty Pensieve, poking balls of fluff and curling his lip at them.  Absently, he picked up a dried flower and smelled it, as though he didn’t even notice he was doing it.
“What?” Startled, Harry stopped rubbing his hand.
, and there are people out there still like that. Do you think I don’t know? Blood supremacists, purists, twisted psychopaths who think our world would be better if non-magical people were all killed off—or enslaved, as Grindelwald would have it. I know. I know they’re out there. I
“Well, thanks for your permission,” Harry said, but read the next two pages.
“I just mean . . .” Harry shifted uncomfortably. “He’s in love with me.”
“Excellent. You have my word Instructor Potter will not interfere with the mission and restrict his actions to ensuring the safety of Mister Malfoy. Now, is there anything else that needs to be resolved here, or can I trust the Department to handle the planning of this mission on its own?”
Harry got his hand on the knob.
Harry put his hand over his chest, where the letter rested inside his cloak.
Kavika’s brow knit in slight confusion. “I think I’ve lost the thread of the conversation, Harry. If he had nothing to do with Travers, why are you disappointed in him?”
“What?” Harry stopped rubbing the cup, and Kavika shrugged.
Harry looked to the right. Large letters, written in blood, were dripping from the walls.
Harry looked at him again—Malfoy’s pale, plain face, his gangly figure. “You don’t pay attention in class,” Harry finally said. “Every time I tried to instruct you today, you ignored me or got jumpy; you don’t—”
“Think of another cock,” Draco said, “fucking your face while I fuck your cunt.”
“You are.” Harry felt helpless.
“But dragons are sort of—”
“Yes, but . . .”  Draco put his hands on his cheeks, almost as though to feel whether they were hot.  Harry guessed they were, as Draco’s cheeks had gone quite red.  Turning back to Harry, Draco said, “You—if I tell you a secret, you won’t tell?”
Harry bit his lip. Reassurance, of course, was what he offered all of his students, but now Harry was remembering what praise did to Malfoy. Too long had passed, perhaps, since Harry was an Auror.
don’t know.” George waggled his brows.
like I was when I was eleven.  Forget everything I told you.  I don’t even like you anyway.”
“Good boy. Hold still, Harry.” Then Draco’s hand was on Harry’s neck, holding him there as though to steady himself while Draco fucked in hard—then again—and again—again—
Harry edged away, unfolding the parchment and moving near the window to read it.  For some reason, seeing Draco’s small, perfect handwriting made Harry’s heart clench in his chest, just like that opening greeting—
“What?” Draco pulled away to look up at him.
“I didn’t mean what I said,” Draco said in a rush.  “You’re my friend.  I mean, when I grow up—when we grow up, you’re my friend.”
Harry didn’t know what to say.
“The psychiatrist? They’re for it.” Harry twisted the crystals in his hands, feeling the magic that kept them spelled together. “We’re working on some of the legal things—non-magical people use a lot of personal identification numbers and papers, and there’s a lot to consider about how laws would align--currency. We need a goblin.”
“I don’t bear a grudge,” Harry said. “I
Oh, fuck.
Feeling as though he was burning in a fire that was too hot, Harry ripped his mouth away, gasping for fresh air, pressing his forehead against Draco’s as Draco sucked in a breath as well.  They stayed like that, panting.  Harry thought that if he caught his breath, he might regain his sanity with it.
“About Malfoy,” said Harry. “What you’re asking. I don’t know.”
Harry sighed.  “It’s hard for me to read.”
He was outside only a moment or two when Malfoy stepped in front of him.  “Stop coming to my work.”
He’d forget it again.  Harry knew for a fact that he would, that Malfoy letting Death Eaters into Hogwarts didn’t have anything to do with why he’d stopped Malfoy from going further.  He’d forgiven Malfoy for that long ago, and anyway, even if that was who Malfoy once had been, it wasn’t who Malfoy was now.  The only reason Harry had stopped Malfoy had been because they were under compulsion of the powder.  Harry would never do anything like that when someone wasn’t free to make their own choices.  Without the powder, Harry wasn’t even sure what he would choose.
“He paid for it,” Teddy said.
“Well?” Harry demanded, feeling angry for some reason.
“Yes. No.” Harry gritted his teeth. “Because you would be killed.”
remained. Harry had been thinking about it. He’d done some research. No one had ever tried to remove a Dark Mark before—not to his knowledge. Not before Malfoy.
Harry swallowed again, his throat aching. “Yes, but have you heard?”
Harry smiled against Draco’s skin.  “I thought you weren’t interested in being fair.”
But whatever, Draco had got Harry a present.  Even though books were boring, Harry had had very few presents before, and the idea that Draco had got it for him made him feel a bit overwhelmed.  “I haven’t got one for you.”
“It’s because I’m so evil,” Malfoy said.  “I know all sorts of dark tricks.  Such as how to quarter berries.”  He shoved the cutting board back onto its shelf with a thud.
“Yes,” Harry said carefully.  “I did know that.”
“Draco,” Harry said softly.  “I do know.”
“What if they make him take Veritaserum?” Harry demanded, appalled that Ron seemed to be arguing in favour of this. “What if they check for Raids at the door?” He turned back to Robards. “You can’t just put an innocent person into a group of known terrorists without a way to—”
“You think that’s why he didn’t pass?” Harry asked, surprised.
At last, out of ideas, Harry folded the parchment into a square, then turned around. Malfoy was looking at him with this wounded look, as though Harry had said something painful. “Is that something I can do, now?” Malfoy said, his voice a dry whisper. “Ask you?”
Suddenly Harry felt terrible, and didn’t know what to do other than to straighten his shoulders and say, “What do I do?”
“You’ve already
“Oh, no,” Teddy said. “I think I know the instructor.”
“Nothing. I’ll go save Hermione.”
“Yes.  They’ve probably already called the police,” Harry added, even though he was fairly certain that neither Vernon nor Petunia would have done anything of the sort.
“Some people like it a lot,” Draco murmured, and Harry felt as though he could feel the blood being dragged into his cock, forcing it to rise, and rise, forcing it to stand. “Now, hold it like that,” Draco said, as though Harry had any control over his cock at all, but the coaxing strokes of Draco’s wand in the air above Harry’s body stopped, and Draco pointed his wand at Harry’s balls, still loose and relaxed with just having come. Pointed at the air above the testicles, Draco’s wand made a swift, tight circle in the air, and something inside Harry tightened. Inside, where the glands had been loose and relaxed from just having come, the tissue snapped back to create tension and readiness to come again.
“See, I kind of think it’s you who brought disgrace on me?” Malfoy said, in his light, flippant way. “You’re the one who kicked me out of the family. Or was this some kind of complicated courtship ritual among pure-bloods? So sorry, I’m forgetting all of our lovely traditions.”
Looking over at him, Mister Malfoy laughed.  “Don’t worry,” he said.  “I used to hate vegetables.  I’m sure I can make something good out of this.”
“What?” Harry tried to say, turning to look up at Mister Malfoy, who was holding out a phial.  Harry couldn’t see it too well.  When he reached out, he seemed to be shaking.
Harry held him for a minute, smelling Draco’s hair again, his sweat, listening to his heartbeat. Opening his mouth, Harry set his teeth on the curve of Draco’s shoulder.
“Draco,” Harry said again, softly now. “They tried to force me to pass you.”
.”  Fire flared to life in the hearth, filling the sitting-room with warmer light.
“Yes, it’s me; please come; something is wrong; I think there’s—”
“You should have owled me sooner,” Harry said.
“Some people are born with families who are very good,” Harry said. “I’ve learned over the years that family you find is just as good or better.”
“Is it?” Harry asked. “With Fudge as Minister, I’m sure we should all feel violently reassured.”
“Oh!  We need to trade?  Hold on.”  Rushing back to the bedroom, Harry got his wand and glasses.  As he held out his wand to Draco, he said, “Does this mean I get to—”  But Draco was already handing Harry his own wand, which was slightly shorter and lighter coloured.  Once Harry had it in hand, he didn’t feel the big surge he’d felt holding the dark-coloured one, but there was still a little something—not unpleasant.  Still, Harry felt a bit disappointed; he had assumed Draco’s wand must be really cool.  “Will it work for me?”
Harry wasn’t sure what to say, since he didn’t really cry that often in general.  He’d barely even cried when Dumbledore died, but then again, he hadn’t got much of a chance to.  “Probably,” Harry said belatedly, because Draco made it seem as though this might convince him to be happy staying here.  “I’d . . . be sad I never . . .”  Harry swallowed.  “I never told you how much you meant to me.”
“How are you feeling?” Doctor Duggins asked, as Harry sat down.
“I’m fine, Ron,” Harry said. “It’s just—I’m not . . . you don’t need to worry about me, or anything like that. It’s confusing. That’s all.”
“Still not good enough?” Malfoy said, his voice still light. “Such a surprise. The ex-Death Eater fails to impress Boy Wonder of the Wizarding World. How could this be so?”
Malfoy snapped his fingers in front of Harry’s face.  “I’m sorry,” Malfoy said, not sounding sorry at all.  “Am I boring you?”
“You’re not meant to be in my office,” Harry said, even though he’d let it slide for so long.
George had read aloud. He seemed a bit obsessed with this.
“I’m not irrational,” Harry said, since that was what Gryffindor meant.
“Do I have scars?”
“A constellation.  I forgot—most Muggles don’t pay attention to stars the way wizards do.”  Pointing his wand upward again, Draco made silver sparks come out of it.  They drifted upward, tracing lines between the stars.  “This is Ursa Major,” he said, moving closer to Harry and pointing.  “Do you see?  It looks like a bear.”
, but then he visibly checked himself.  Instead he tossed his head.  “I’m not surprised at all.”
“I could enlarge them,” Harry said.  “Or we could find other ones, since you think they’re hideous.”
Minister for Magic supports a vote that would condemn Vulnerables to twice as much death and destruction as Voldemort could ever create?”
“Once I
“Of course, I will,” Harry said, taking his hand off Draco’s shoulder.  “Come on.  Aren’t you hungry?”
“Sure,” Harry said, because Malfoy’s body was obviously not very nice at all. “Remember our rules for the class—never move against your partner without being quite sure they’re ready; never touch them without letting them know what you’re about to do. Okay, Malfoy,” Harry said again. “I’m going to come behind you and put an arm around you, and then my other arm is going to come around your neck. Is that okay?”
“Muggles have fairy tales, don’t they?”
“I meant my magnetism. My winning ways. My obvious, how do you say,
more information than just one parchment,” said Astoria.
“All right, well.”  Dropping Harry’s hand, Draco sat up, moving away so that he could turn and face Harry.  “First of all—”  Draco squared his shoulders.  “First of all, I’ve always wanted you to touch me.  Always.  My whole life.  Both lives—the one from these past three weeks and the other one, ever since I was eleven.  Sometimes I wanted to make you angry enough to hit me, Potter.  Just so I could have you touch me.”
Harry wondered what other things Draco wanted and had never reached for.
Lifting his chin, Malfoy said only, “I don’t beg.”
“No,” said Malfoy. “I don’t mean be careful of Potter. Be careful of me. I won’t do it if you insult him.”
“This alpaca is Vinicius,” Sibanyoni said. “Say to it what you would say to him.”
“Why would the Board allow blood discrimination to continue?” another reporter asked. They were one of Luna’s, from
As it happened, Harry was not the one who got sacked.
Harry wanted to tell him that shaking his wand as though it was malfunctioning wouldn’t actually help, but Draco’s shoulders stiffened every time a spell didn’t work.  Having known Lucius, Harry would have guessed Draco was bracing himself for criticism, but now Harry wasn’t so sure.  Apparently, Lucius Malfoy had read his son stories with funny voices and hexed dancing instructors just because they said negative things.  Meanwhile, Draco seemed to react badly to positive words as well, as though encouragement was just another reminder that he’d failed.  He was so proud, and too hard on himself by far.
Harry sucked in a breath, then looked around. “Actually . . . can I have some of that . . . is there any of that left?” He gestured at Yin’s smoothie.
24 years
“New blood,” Harry agreed. “Maybe Malfoy will get obsessed with some non-mag and finally leave me alone.”
“Like you’re incredulous I could keep from insulting a Muggleborn long enough to date one.”
“Oh.”
“I just had some bad experiences with Legilimens,” Harry said. “When I was a child.”
Fairly certain Draco was going to try to make him read, Harry warily sat on the edge of the couch Draco had made, feeling nervous and annoyed.  But Draco just put the large, fancy-covered book in his lap and opened to a page in the middle.  Out of the corner of his eye, Harry could see the page was full of moving pictures, which made him feel even worse.  Draco thought he couldn’t read at all.
“Scoping blokes, of course,” said George. “Maybe I was looking for someone for Charlie. Maybe for Harry. Maybe for a threesome, sweetpea;
“You didn’t think that could hurt her?” Harry asked. “Seeing her father hurt someone she loves?”
moved on. He’s not
“I thought I would.”
“You don’t want to go to the pub to celebrate,” Ron said. “Do you.”
“Potter?”  The man sounded stricken  also.
“You know because he gave you lots of presents?” Harry asked, still curious about what being loved would be like.
“Yes. Please—yes.”
A hand extended into Harry’s line of vision, holding about three sausage rolls. “I thought you might need food,” said Ron. “And champagne.” His other hand appeared with flutes; Harry couldn’t tell whether they had been Summoned, or Ron had had them all along.
“I don’t want to step on you, Malfoy.”
Harry took a breath, released it.
Draco hadn’t been to sleep at all, Harry realized.  He’d been in here the whole night, chopping up mouse ears, except he’d stopped to make Harry breakfast and transfigure him clothes.  For some reason it made Harry’s chest hurt like something that was really sad, only it shouldn’t have, because it was nice.
Andromeda stared at him.  “I’ll make a pot of tea.”  Spinning on her heel, she went off down the hall, her white nightgown twirling away.
“Just think,” Vinicius was saying. “I got to know you again a year ago in this very spot.”
“That’s not quite what it says,” said another man. “It says there were wards.”
The glass bottle snapped back into shape.
“Guess you’ll just have to wait and see.” Harry poured half the memories into the Pensieve, leaving the other half for Draco.  Harry waited for Draco to take the jar and pour out the memories, then said, “How’s your mum?”
The hair was almost falling into Draco’s right eye.  “I wonder how I know what their bogies look like.”
“They’re my best friends.”  Malfoy had picked up a jar, but once he saw the brain in it, made a face and put it back.
“Of course,” Harry said. “Why not?”
biro,” he said, figuring if Draco could use
“Yes, Harry.”
“You’re not ‘meant’ to feel anything. You feel what you feel.” Hermione turned to Ron. “And if you do feel something for someone, Harry, it doesn’t have to be for a witch or wizard; it can be a non-magical person. There are more than twelve of them, last time I checked.”
“I’m going,” Harry said, turning to go down the stairs.
“Harry.”  There was a pause, and Harry realized he’d closed his eyes again.  “You know lying is bad, don’t you?”
“Because I’m a trainee. Obviously. And you’re Harry Potter,” Malfoy added carelessly, waggling his fingers in a frittering gesture.
“Mum says Muggles have completely ruined rainbows,” Draco said, putting up his nose.  “For everyone.”
“What?” Harry asked, but then he heard it. It must have been the snake-shape the magic had taken, and he had been concentrating so closely he hadn’t realized. He’d thought the language would leave with Voldemort, but it hadn’t. “Sorry.”
Harry had got through two sentences when Draco said, “You don’t need to put your finger like that.  I’m not four.”
“Thanks,” Harry said, taking the cup from the air.
“I don’t know how to,” Harry said.  He’d heard of it before, but Dudley seemed to think it dull.  For once, Harry had agreed with him.
“What do you think you should do?”
“I’ll do it,” said Malfoy.
“Hilda is only interested in past injustice,” Spragg said in his ever-pleasant voice. “Never present.”
“Oh, yes, Mister Gryffindor, I forgot.”
“Er. I don’t know if ‘help’ is the right . . .” Catching himself rubbing the back of his hand, Harry made himself stop. He
The one shouting his name was Lee, who was waving his broom. Harry made his way toward him.
“You’re not one of us!” a woman shouted, Apparating directly in front of Teddy. “Avada—”
“Oh!” Bickford was bouncing up and down a bit. “Oh, Harry! You wouldn’t think any of us would try to influence any sort of
Yin’s head tilted in a thoughtful way, their eyes kind, their lips turned down in an expression that seemed almost sad. “Harry. Giving someone a chance doesn’t mean falling in love with them. It doesn’t mean having sex with them.”
Harry had had a teacher or two like this—very nice teachers, who didn’t believe the things he said. In those cases, Harry had always assumed Uncle Vernon or Aunt Petunia had told them what a liar he was, but for the first time it occurred to Harry that maybe he just looked like a liar.  He also always looked like he wasn’t tidy, because of his hair.  Disappointment surged over Harry as he realized he didn’t have any way to make Mister Malfoy want to keep him.
“Just because they approved my application—”
.  I’m sure I don’t care about your courses at uni, or what you ate for breakfast, or whether you’re for the Tornadoes or the Harpies, and yet someone must care, since it’s the only thing consistently in the headlines.”
“I think he did something to you,” Malfoy repeated. “You being Chosen One and all. That’s why your magic is so strong. Otherwise you wouldn’t have stood out so much. You would have been just—normal. You weren’t born exceptional.”
Mister Malfoy shouldn’t get to avoid the subject.  After all, he had brought it up, so Harry just shrugged.  “Not really.”
Do not let this alarm you.
“The headmaster of the school we went to.”  Mechanically, Mister Malfoy took a sip of coffee.  “Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry.”
“I have a house?” Harry said, all other thoughts leaving his head.
Draco called it, but that made it sound boring when actually it was very cool.  Harry thought Draco looked like an important person in it, like possibly someone who solved crimes but in pyjamas and slippers.  When Draco heard Harry say this, he transfigured Harry a dressing gown as well.  Then they were both very cool, and Harry asked if he could keep it.  Draco said Harry couldn’t because transfigured clothes didn’t stay together well, but it was Harry’s in-between birthday so on Friday a dressing gown came by owl post.
It wasn’t hard enough, Harry realized. It wasn’t deep enough. If he could get it deeper, if he could get that rough, stinging slap directly inside his hole, inside of him, in the place connected to his dick, then his dick could feel the spanking and he could come; he could come. He needed it inside; he needed something inside; he needed to be fucked, and Draco spanked him again.
A few minutes later, the washing up was done and Draco was back with the satchel over his shoulder.
Harry snatched his hand away, jerking back from the table.  His chair knocked back, clattering onto the floor.  The sudden sound made him start and look down.  “Sorry,” he said, not sure how the chair had got that way.
Setting his cup and saucer down with a clatter, Robards said, “The Department of Mysteries has been working on a case involving Ludville for months.  Your arrest interfered; I issued the transfer to Mysteries as a gesture of our willingness to proceed at their future discretion.  Nothing more can be done, Auror Potter.  The Unspeakables have it from here.”
“No.” Harry shook his head. “I’m all right.”
“Yes,” Draco said, even more brusque.  “He won’t cause trouble, on my honour.”
“What resolutions were those?” Harry cuddled him closer.
Though he was sort of afraid Mister Malfoy would do something to the fire burning there, Harry was relieved Mister Malfoy hadn’t come for him.
Ron’s shoulder pressed against Harry’s, warm and sure. “No one said you couldn’t feel sympathetic, mate.”
“Did you expect him to be impressive?”
“You mean he killed him?”
“Malfoy—”
Harry took a step back.  “We can’t.  I can’t.”
Harry knew about the problems with the Deal. Kingsley was having difficulty building his coalition, but the referendum had passed. The Ministry couldn’t back out of Reveal now; the only question was meant to be how the ward drop would happen. Wasn’t it? Harry should talk to Hermione. He’d been consumed by the supremacist in the midst of the Academy; he hadn’t been paying enough attention to politics.
“You already did.” It was the only thing Malfoy had said the whole class that was not a spell. He kept on walking back to his seat.
“I think it’s time for bed,” Harry said, after the hour was up.
“He isn’t!” Draco said again.
Over a week had passed since Draco had turned eighteen and Harry had gone back to stay at Grimmauld Place, but Harry had come every time his Patronus had alerted him that Draco was a new age.  When Harry came on the day Draco turned twenty-three, Draco was already in the lab again.
“Yes.”  Giving Harry’s hand a final squeeze, Draco moved toward the cabinet.
“What does your father say about your insistence on becoming an Auror?” asked another reporter.
perfect,” Draco went on, sounding slightly hysterical.  “I’m the opposite of perfect!  And Mum said—she said—she said I can’t have hysterics!  She said—she said I can’t
The main work of the organization was through fund-raising, which would help them support Ministry initiatives focused on Reveal as well as existing organizations that could build connections to non-magborn magical people. Kingsley was working with his state and business connections, whereas Kavika was focused on schools. Hogwarts, the Academy, St. Mugo’s Training Program—even the Squib kindergarten where Andromeda sometimes worked all had non-magborn people attending and working there, and the support networks in those places would help educate non-mag families.
Draco leaned down over him, the rich silky fabric of his shirt against Harry’s back. Grunting, Draco thrust in again, hard, but his voice was close and soft when he said, “Another spell. It will make you into such a slut, Harry.”
Harry’s mouth was dry. He wanted to say something, anything, but he felt paralyzed with desire.
“Potter, you fool,” Malfoy muttered. “My body doesn’t know how to make a cell that doesn’t love you.”
“I’ll.”  Harry swallowed.  “I’ll get a salve.  You should—you’ll get better.”  Then he Apparated, feeling like a coward for doing so, but if Draco was really only going to be half cured during the interval before he aged again, he needed—fuck, what did he need?  Salve, bandages, fresh clothes, fluids, dittany, a
“Harry.”  Draco paused after that, which usually meant he was upset about something.  Harry couldn’t figure out what was wrong, except that maybe Draco didn’t like to talk about things that made him unhappy.  Harry could understand that.  He didn’t like to talk about the cupboard either, but mainly because it was dead boring.  “When people want you to be happy,” Draco finally said, “it sets up an expectation.  And when people have a lot of expectations of you, sometimes you worry you won’t meet those expectations.”
you for it, you dolt!”  As if surprised at his own name-calling, Malfoy looked around the street.  People were stopping to look at them—the former Death Eater and Harry Potter, facing each other down on the pavement.  Harry was used to people staring and had resigned himself to it, but Malfoy looked uncomfortable.  Malfoy gestured to a side alley and strode into it, Harry following.  “I don’t need help from you,” Malfoy said, his voice low.  “I’ve got it taken care of myself.”
Draco took a big deep shuddering breath. His swallow made an audible gulp. “Yes,” Draco said, after a moment. “Yes, all right. You can—you can do that.”
Light flashed out from Draco’s wand, but at the same time a shadow came out of the man’s wand—a long, dark thing, unspooling like ribbon into a cloud.  Harry felt suddenly afraid in a way he had not thought to feel before.
Teddy’s brow did its incremental furrow as he glanced down at the letter. “This isn’t from a Hogwarts friend.”
Harry scanned back in his memory.  “That was almost a year ago.”
Shit.
get me what I want?”
“Yeah.” Harry rubbed the back of his fist with his other hand. “It’s good. It’s . . . nice.”
,” Draco murmured.  The quill lifted up and began to write on the parchment.
“Everyone knows Neville Longbottom is also a saint,” said Vinicius. “Meanwhile,
“I don’t know.” Harry rubbed his hand some more. “I’ve been thinking . . . could I do more good? Somewhere else.”
“But you do frequently come to me for potions consultations.”
Harry performed the disrobing spell, opening Draco’s shirt.  The wounds were knit together, but only just.  Harry remembered seeing it in the bathroom, the spell that Snape had cast to close the cuts, but it should have progressed further than this.  Snape had said there might not even be scarring, but these wounds were barely scabbed over.
People use statues for protection, Harry thought idly, and it wasn’t bad, to have someone there and not-there. In a way it felt like Kavika, the way he could drink coffee with her sometimes, and she wouldn’t say anything, wouldn’t pressure him to say anything. She would just be another presence, almost a reassurance that he didn’t have to be anyone particular for her.
“Things can be very backward in the wizarding world, Harry.”  Draco stopped playing with the placemat.  When he spoke, his voice sounded much firmer than it had done.  “We’re going to break into the Ministry.  But to do it—I have to be you, and you have to be—someone else.”
“Oh.”
The result was much narrower mattresses and blankets, but Draco transfigured a fluffy towel so that they could both have pillows, and then he let Harry get into the top bunk.
Harry turned his head on the algae bed. “Have I ever been there when you needed me?”
“You’re always picking a fight!”
Harry said okay.
“Yeah.”  Harry hugged him again, this time more gently.  “Yeah, I know you do.”
“I still don’t know,” Draco said, “but I think I found the connection between the cases older-you must have found as well.  If I’m right, I need to look at some of the files he had at Grimmauld Place to see if I can figure out how he found the place we went the night you de-aged.”
“It’s not—” Harry couldn’t think of what it wasn’t. “I mean, he did it for Rune, but it’s like—it’s like he decides to care about someone, and he—he just . . . it didn’t feel romantic. Before. I mean, at first it was embarrassing; I was embarrassed for him. But it didn’t feel . . .”
Fuck.
“I want to say a political discussion is not helpful for your mind-healing,” Kavika said, her tone changed. Now she wore a rueful smile, though melancholy was still carried in her eyes. “But I’m afraid it’s all related.”
“Does it bother you?”
“I don’t want you to come back,” Draco yelled.  “Get out!”
Harry had asked once, but Malfoy had just said he was practicing.  It had taken him almost four years to answer a stupid question about what he wanted to be when he grew up, and nearly a year later, Harry still remembered the answer.
“I’m glad you figured it out,” Draco said, arching a little under his gaze.
Harry looked at it.
“It’s harder.” Harry’s fingers played with the locket Ron and Hermione had given him, underneath his shirt, against his chest. “It’s harder when everyone around you has a personal stake in your own life. When everyone around you knows what you should be, and you don’t know yourself.”
“They don’t want to see me,” Harry had said at the time, but eventually he’d found that the reason he felt that way was he thought they couldn’t want to see him. Then he’d found that he thought he wasn’t worth seeing, for reasons unknown to himself, for reasons that had to do with being an orphan, maybe, or the fact that Mum, Dad, Sirius, and Lupin had all died.
They went.
Harry thought of the Dursleys.  “Not really.”
“I’m not going to,” said Teddy, and they all looked at him.
“Let’s play with an advantage,” Draco said, whizzing back over to Harry to fly in a spiral around him.
“Which one?”
“Some kind of lab.  I think different brewers are making the potions here, but I think there’s a common element—some kind of supplier.”  Harry moved to open one of the cabinets, even though he still didn’t know what to look for.  Even just being next to Malfoy made him feel more capable, though.  Malfoy always solved everything.  “We have to figure out who they are.”
“What would the company you’re founding do?”
Inside the lab, Harry located the cabinet he’d been under when he’d knocked the potion over.  The broken glass had been removed; the sickle he had used as a Portkey was gone.  Whoever had been coming into the lab right after Harry had de-aged must have found them.
, Draco had said.  Harry had never been on a picnic, but he’d heard that ants ruined them.  A place without ants would be pretty lovely, he guessed, but what Draco was saying didn’t sound so lovely.  “What’s wrong with it?” he finally asked.
me.  They’re
Kavika said.
“Me?  I taught you everything you know.”
“Hm.  That’s not surprising,” Malfoy said, setting the flower down.  “I imagine I spend more time with you than Vince and Greg.  You know them, of course?”
Kavika just sat there, her brow still raised.
“Would you like to read some more?” Draco asked, moving the papers so Harry could see them.
Eventually they had supper, then sat in front of the fire some more and burned some marshmallows.  After an hour of this, Andromeda transfigured more pyjamas for Harry, Draco changed, and Andromeda went to bed.  Harry changed as well and brushed his teeth with a transfigured brush, then went back to Teddy’s room.  Andromeda had said the wood in Teddy’s bed would be fine for another night, so they got to have the bunk beds again, Harry on top and Draco on the bottom.
A chair floated over from behind the only desk in the room, and Malfoy sank down into it. “You’re speaking Parseltongue.”
“A magical creature.”
“Are you sure?”
Malfoy had said that to him once, and the truth was that many people had felt that, many people had gone through that. Many people had loved Harry Potter, but there was only one Draco Malfoy.
“There was either more than one, or you just arrested the dealer.”
“Um.” Harry smiled.
Looking around, Harry surveyed the hill. Teddy was still talking to a crowd, so were Fairchild and Mark. Andromeda was further down the hill, helping a few non-magical people with their cars. Harry couldn’t tell whether there had been a traffic accident, or whether someone was having some kind of engine trouble, but it didn’t look like an emergency. Ordinarily he would Apparate to help, except he’d already discovered that Apparition caused such an uproar among the non-magicals that he figured he’d better walk down there instead.
“Pardon?”
Kavika spelled the beans to grind, getting out the cups she always used, the small pot with the long handle, where she put the grounds, then spelled the water, leaving it to steep.
Heart sinking as he realized Draco must have already awoken and begun working on the case without him, Harry had made his way to the sitting room.  Andromeda was on the sofa, reading a newspaper.  “Where’s Draco?” Harry asked.
“Technically the meeting hasn’t even begun,” Greengrass said smoothly. “Our fourth member hasn’t arrived.”
like radical Revealers were dropping the wards. It was a trainee, among others, who
“You said you wouldn’t ask questions,” Harry said.
“You thought I’d hate you.”
“Terrorism can call attention to a cause,” Teddy said. “When people protest for a cause, it’s a movement. Movements create legislation. And when that fails, there’s war.”
“He did so under my supervision,” Harry said through gritted teeth. “I teach Advanced Defense Against Dark Arts as well as Sorcery. Destruction of a tree that had only been kept alive through human sacrifice deserves top marks, not expulsion.”
“Can you,” he said. “I need to—” Draco didn’t finish, but with the way he was twisting his head, Harry knew what Draco needed; he wanted to see. He wanted to look at their cocks together, touching, the way he’d been unable to take his eyes off of his hand on Harry’s cock for more than a few seconds.
Draco raised a brow.  “Like how to read?”
Draco pointed her out.  “You can’t see it in these pictures, but her eyes were blue.”
“I’m confused,” Bickford was saying. “If the charm used to monitor the wards alerted the Order, which allowed them to stop Greyback—isn’t that a
Fudge scowled, while Pillwickle managed to look affronted. A laconic tone spoke in the hearth behind Harry.
care.  To hear Draco say so was startling, and Harry wasn’t certain what to think about it.
Ron glanced away, into the crowd, but he didn’t seem to be looking at anything in particular. “I never thought I was going to be the person I am now,” he said finally, turning back to Harry. “I wanted to be—you know—tough. Impressive. Someone who . . .” Shrugging, he looked down at his hands. “I don’t even know what. It’s different than I expected,” he said, lifting blue eyes back to Harry’s. “Life is different.
“I don’t know,” Harry said. “I don’t know what I want.”
Mister Malfoy was still holding Harry’s arm.  “
“Thanks.” Harry’s hand moved over his fist. “I just wanted—I wanted to see that you were okay.”
Draco’s eyes flicked down at the bags, then slowly dragged back up.
“You were yelling.” Putting his glasses back on, Harry moved ahead of Malfoy, closer to the placards on the wall. The message was scrawled across multiple placards, but the target was obvious: Regina Fairchild. Harry remembered the holiday party, where not everyone had been a pure-blood power couple announcing marriage with the sole intent of making more spoiled, privileged pure-blood babies. Fairchild had brought her Non-mag boyfriend. Harry turned back to Malfoy.
had been committed.  What if he was there?  What if he hurt you?”
“You think I don’t know that?” Teddy said.  “You must be nuts.  You’re crushing me.”
Harry took a deep breath of the crisp air, then another, already feeling better, more relaxed—now that he was outdoors, now that he had identified the conversation he wanted to have, now that Teddy knew it too. Teddy would have had any conversation Harry wanted and would have remained calm and soft-spoken throughout, but that was part of the problem. Teddy could be so even-keeled that Harry worried he might not always say when he was hurting, if he was hurting.
“I told you,” Harry said.  “I’ll do anything.  I’ll do anything.”
“Dragons protect what’s theirs.  Foxes have to go out looking for what they want.”
“No one ever truly reforms,” Malfoy told her, still in that flat voice.  “Come, Potter.”  He wiggled his fingers.
, and Malfoy was it, and it wasn’t meant to matter that Harry had been bullied and hurt and mistreated, that Malfoy had been the bully, that Malfoy had meted out the hurt and mistreatment?
Stalking over to the back, Harry didn’t wait for Malfoy to turn around.  “What are you doing here?” he said.
Draco was afraid, Harry realized finally.  “It’s going to be all right,” he said.  Experimentally, he put his hand on Draco’s shoulder.  “Adult-you made it so you’ll be unconscious for most of it.”
Harry’s eyes snapped back up to Malfoy’s face.
Harry knew he should have used that time to do something constructive—sleep, or work on the illegal potions case, but he couldn’t.  Ron and Hermione were being controlled; he needed to help them, and Draco was up there alone, convinced his father was a murderer.  Draco had seemed so pleased about it on the train after Cedric had died, when they’d all been going home.  Draco had said Voldemort would come for Mudbloods and Muggle-lovers first; he’d
“I didn’t think I did.” Harry squinted down at the tiny magazine. There was maybe a person on it, but it was like looking at a figure on a coin, too small to decipher properly. After a moment, Harry looked back up. “You don’t think I should have tried to get him passed?”
“A peacock.”  For some reason, Draco looked a little sad about that.
Malfoy stared at him again. He had a stillness about him; that was what made that stare a little preternatural, a laser focus that made Harry want to get away, and yet there was a softness in Malfoy’s eyes. They almost looked like liquid in this light.
“Oh, dear,” said Doctor Yin, observing that no surface was unoccupied, much less any chairs. Taking out their wand, they Banished a pile of parchment, a vase of fish, and a skull out of a bowl chair. “You can sit there,” they said, then somehow made their way beside the leopard, around what must be a table under piles and piles of scrolls, to another chair. This chair had a big mullioned window behind it, half covered with a fringed tapestry curtain. Doctor Yin sank into it. “I’m sorry. You’re thinking, ‘what kind of therapist is this’? That’s what I think, most days.”
“You said you’d let me.”
“I thought I would find you here.”
“When I was a boy my father used to read me these stories,” Draco said, checking the table of contents on the front and flipping open to a page.  “Mum used to do it as well, but it was better when Father did.”
“If anyone had told me I shouldn’t be an Auror . . .” Looking down, Harry discovered he was rubbing the scar on his hand, then made himself stop. “It’s not that I think he can’t handle it—the actual job, I mean. But it . . . wears you down. Not just the late nights; it’s finding out the—the sheer
Then Timothy was gone, and the tree was too.
After the ceremony, trainees and recent graduates gathered for magic photographs and congratulations, and Ron found Harry at the edge of the crowd. “I’ll see you after you’re done with Malfoy?” Ron asked.
“I thought you didn’t want me to see?”  Draco was already taking the ledger, looking at it curiously.
Harry looked at the bottle, trying to think about real feelings.  It had hurt Malfoy, bringing him this; Harry could tell that much.  It was obvious why.  Malfoy thought Harry thought of him as a machine who was only good for potions consulting, for getting work done.  Harry should feel guilty about that.  He should regret it, and yet the only thing he could think was that he was the machine.  He was the one without real feelings, because he couldn’t feel anything just now at all.
many covers of
“Better?” said Hermione, hurrying up from another direction.
“Then why are you brewing a cure?”
After a minute or two, Harry went over there to help.  The prospect of reading all those old papers wasn’t terrible exciting to him, but the folders had dates on them.  He could help sort them.  Getting started on the papers, Harry said, “You never told me what an Auror is.  Is it a sort of barrister?”
“I brought canapés?” Nyala said, hopefully holding them out, one in hand for Harry, the other in her other hand for Teddy.
He pulled away, his face aching red and wet all over.  “Where is she?”
“No.  It’s not.”
The low urgency in Draco’s tone at last made Harry open his eyes.  He was still lying against Draco on the couch, and the hard thing was Draco’s elbow.  The fire had gone quite low, and it was otherwise completely dark in the room.  It must be quite late.
“Have you got it?” Harry asked, surprised. “The memory?”
“I’m not going to talk about pornography with you.”
“Ah.”  Malfoy sounded uncertain, and Harry glanced back at him.  “Yes,” Malfoy said quickly.  He wet his lips.  “Yes, I’ll—I’ll have some.  Of that.”
“I’ll be the control,” Harry said, grabbing the Veritaserum and preparing to take the three drops on his tongue.  “No questions,” he added, after he’d done it.
Savage leapt from her chair. “Dumbledore was a fucking
Harry almost smiled. “Oh, does one? I wonder if a Malfoy has secrets if I—”
“Want me to record it? Want to look in my Penseive? I’ll show you mine if you show me yours.”
“Is it true that Kingsley Shacklebolt himself deputized you?” said a third.
“Do you feel okay?” Harry asked anxiously.
Ron was currently dancing with his wife, and the entire wizarding world knew he was infatuated with her. “You can try,” Harry said drily.
, and—and.”  Draco stopped, his eyes shining with tears.  Each time Draco cried himself raw, he went unconscious again and aged a year, then looked as if he hadn’t cried at all.
Draco looked like a painting, warm and kind and gold like a prince from a fairy tale, like something from a dream.  A dream where Harry didn’t live in a cupboard and got to eat whenever he wanted, and no one told him he was a freak.
“Oh.”  Malfoy bit his lip, eyes flicking back up to the scar.  “Can I . . . can I touch it?”
“So you’ve said before,” said Bletchley, “but none of the experiments have worked.”
The Timothy Tree stood silently, alone, living through history and yet not taking part in it, belonging there because there was nowhere else that it could be. How nice it would be, Harry thought, to be the Timothy Tree, with its branches reaching up from you to the sky, alone in the wet cold air, tasting the scent of dirt and rain and grass.
Ron shrugged. “I said we didn’t owe him. And we don’t. But . . . he’s good to have around.”
“But.” Draco’s shoulder sagged.  “Didn’t you hear?  What I just said?”
“Oh,” Draco said.
“Harry.” Kavika’s smile lit her up inside. “It would be my genuine honour.”
“He always gets in my way,” Harry said, then explained a bit about how Robards seemed more impressed with sucking up to higher-ups in the Ministry than actually solving cases, and how Robards didn’t want Harry to be too good at his job, because it made him look bad.
31 years
“Um.” Harry licked his lips.
Harry, who had been about to hold his Portkey home out to Malfoy, paused.
On Saturday, the green gown came, and Harry and Draco had breakfast after it arrived.  Draco made a different breakfast every day.  Harry never got to choose them, as Draco always started making them before Harry awoke, but all of them were delicious—Belgian waffles, and crepes, and then a fry up with kippers and eggs Florentine.  All of them had bacon with them, even when bacon didn’t seem to go.
“I do so wish to hear your thoughts, but I don’t want to be a bad date,” Rune said, his own cheeks gone a bit darker. “I’m sure we’ll meet again.”
When Harry’s Patronus appeared to him downstairs, Harry went upstairs to find Draco catatonic on the couch.  Though Harry laid him out, he left Draco there.  The sitting room was more open than the bedroom, and Harry didn’t want Draco to feel trapped.
“Harry?”
Just then, an owl came swooping down out of the sky.
,” he said, waving at a cabinet.
“I sincerely doubt it, Harry.”
Malfoy had changed, but that was not what was important about this memory.
At last Draco put down his hands, opening his eyes and looking about the lab.  “At least I get this place,” he said.  “I’ve had my eye on Potage’s Cauldron Shop a while, but I didn’t think I’d get it.”
A silence. Click, went a camera. Then another one: click, click, click. All the quills began scribbling at once.
“Rank them by hotness,” George demanded, slamming
“Thanks,” Harry said.
. The bench was cold under him; he could feel it through his jeans. It should be wet, but he couldn’t feel that, so he put his hands on either side of his thighs to wrap around the edge of the bench and squeeze. It was stone. Porous. Not as wet as he would have thought.
“No,” Harry said.  “You’re a potions consultant.”
After a moment, the Mark burned black. Malfoy gasped, and when Harry met his eyes, Malfoy’s were wide. “You’re safe,” Harry said, his voice soft.
“So you always say.  How’s Death Eater life treating you, Lucius-lite?”
Harry strode across the lab toward Draco.  Catching his hand, he yanked Draco to him.  “This is for you right now,” Harry said, taking off his glasses with his other hand.  “Not you when you’re thirty-two.  Do you understand?”  Not waiting for an answer, Harry kissed him, mouth closing over Draco’s, already hot and heavy.  Draco was stiff and stunned against him, and Harry didn’t care, licking Draco’s lips with his tongue until Draco opened his mouth with a bewildered little sound.  Harry’s tongue pushed in, sweeping the inside of Draco’s cheek, one long hot stroke along Draco’s tongue until Draco was shaking in his arms, and then Harry pulled away.  “Do you understand,” Harry said, pressing his forehead again against Draco’s, panting two inches from his mouth.
Harry wanted to ask, but he had already known that.  At twenty-one Draco had said Harry was his ghost, the one Dumbledore had mentioned. And at seventeen Draco had told Harry that Dumbledore’s ghost was desire.  “All right,” Harry said.  Taking out his wand, he waved his Patronus away.  “Tell me if you need me.”  Harry turned to go.
“All right,” Harry said.
31 years
“Yes,” Harry said.
to chill. Malfoy’s never been chill a day in his life. And Teddy’s always chill.”
with an ache that was not rational; he was so worried whether Draco was okay, whether anything had happened during eighth year that would hurt him.
“Ah,” said Andromeda, sounding so much like adult-Draco in that moment that Harry shook his head.  “How was young Draco, then?”
Harry looked longingly up the stairs, toward his office.
“We can go this evening. After class.”
“Excuse me?” Malfoy looked appalled.
The corner of Teddy’s mouth hooked up in a reassuring way. “I’m okay,” Teddy said.
Malfoy shrugged, a fluid movement. “You’re the one who picked apart my language.”
“I didn’t mean to,” Harry said, lowering his wand.
“Excuse me, Harry Potter?”
“After the coup, some of the wizarding community resisted his rule.  A lot of them died, before—before Voldemort was defeated for good.”
Harry had to angle his broom handle downward, going toward the ground so he didn’t get crashed into.  Draco kept doing it though, spiralling tighter and tighter, until suddenly he stood up on his broom and jumped off.
Obviously, that wasn’t true, as Harry knew Hermione and Hermione had always worked harder than him at everything, but Hermione was split between work and family and her political obligations, whereas Harry really only had his job.  Meanwhile, Malfoy only seemed to have potions.  His sitting room was filled with tables stacked with glassware and potions ingredients.  Whenever Harry went over there, Malfoy always seemed to be working on something new—boiling things on his cooker, measuring powders in the sitting room.  Once, Harry even found him mixing tinctures in the toilet.
Harry waited another five.  “Draco—”
Hermione had said, slapping Ron on the arm.
“It’s okay,” Harry said, because he hadn’t felt like Hermione was telling him what to do.
Harry frowned.  “You’re worried you won’t feel the same as you did when you said that?”
“Draco Malfoy’s in love with you,” Hermione said.
“If young Master Malfoy had left the tree alone,” said Kavika, her voice grating on the edge of sarcasm, “there would still

“What’s all this yelling?” a woman said, coming into the sitting-room.
,” he added pointedly, looking at Greengrass—“
,” Draco said, but Harry knew Draco now and thought that Draco sounded afraid.  He looked afraid, and Harry remembered what Draco said about Harry having ‘a dark look.’  At eleven, Harry had been terrified of himself.  Standing in front of an adult and threatening him like this was taking a lot of courage, and Harry’s heart clenched.
“That’s a slur,” said Spragg.
Silence followed, one of Kavika’s warm, gentle silences. “You can say it, Harry.”
“No one would
“I don’t care if he downs three Felix Felicis potions and bloody aces it,” Harry said. “You still have to do the coursework, and he hasn’t.”
“Are you mental?  I get to break into the Ministry and be you while you’re being me?  And look in my desk and get asked questions and look fit while doing it?  Why would I
Setting his scrolls down, Harry checked the coffee. It had to be from one of the instructors—Penelope or Gareth, maybe Clarence, because no one else knew his regular order, and he sipped it as he looked at the schedule for the day. ADADA was first, and he was going to do the boggart lesson that Lupin had done. Boggarts would be an elementary exercise for the trainees, who were all graduates from magical grade schools—one was from Beauxbatons, but everyone learned how to deal with a boggart in primary magic school. The lesson was still useful, though; one had to act under pressure, and this was an important skill.
“No.”  Draco lay there facing the bottom of the top bunk, his hands folded over the blanket across his midriff.  “But I think I know what it is.”
“I mean older you.  I miss him.”
Pillwickle’s smirk widened. “I suppose he’ll be expelled after all.”
“You’re right,” Harry agreed.  “That’d probably work.  You’re tops at potions.”
Harry finished the water, then put it on the bench, beside his thigh. Malfoy didn’t take it, just sitting there in silence.
“I’m . . .” Harry wet his lips.  “Yeah, it—it got on my face.  I think—I think it’s doing something to me.”
Harry put his head back on his pillow.  He had always known Draco would fix it.  He was probably the best wizard in the whole world.  Suddenly Harry didn’t feel angry anymore; he felt sad.  “Will I remember being ten?” he asked, trying not to let his voice catch.
“Go away,” Malfoy said, his voice stuffy and garbled.
“You’re not being fair,” Harry heard himself say, and Malfoy finally backed away.
“Talk about what?”
,” Mister Malfoy said, which Harry guessed made it wet, and then the wet cloth was wiping his neck, his stupidly sweaty hair.

“Just drop out,” Harry said. “You’re obviously not interested, and I’m not going to pass you. You won’t graduate to Level Two anyway, so drop out now. While you’re ahead.”
“Am I going to be able to stop you?  Merlin, you nursed me like I was some kind of . . .” Draco didn’t finish, making another face at the salad instead.
“Thank you,” Harry added. “For the sandwich.”
“I don’t know.”  Harry had no idea why he thought about it so much.  He felt strangely blank inside.
Harry shook his head. “I don’t want one.”
instead of dropping wards—do you really think there’s a new Order of the Phoenix?”
Malfoy had written.
“You think I’m a genius.”
The problem was that Harry just wasn’t smart enough to put the parts of this case together.  A couple years ago, he would’ve taken the problem to Malfoy.  Malfoy was brilliant and so clever, he’d see all the connections instantly, except Malfoy only took meetings by appointment, now.  Harry didn’t know what to put down for an appointment—
Harry took a second to close his eyes, thinking about how Draco had treated Harry when Harry was eleven.  Draco had had been so gentle and so kind, and here was Harry trying to drop the homosexual agenda on a fourteen-year-old.  Maybe he should have thought this through, first.
“Oh!” Bickford flapped about in his fire, perturbed.
Harry struggled to remember whether Malfoy had ever talked about what he had wanted to be when he grew up but could not recall.  At Hogwarts Malfoy had always been talking.  He’d said a lot of things, but Harry had learned early on not to listen.
Instead of trying it, Harry hiked up the breeches and shuffled in the boots across the room. “Do we have to do it now?” Harry asked, when Draco looked up.
“Yes,” Harry said.  “Very cool.”
—Nia Kamau, Harry was pretty sure.
“No, I—”
“Oh, forgive me,” Malfoy said immediately. “I didn’t know anyone was out here.”
; I’ve got to
“Right.” Seeming to snap out of it, Malfoy looked about, and yet did not seem inclined at all to move. His expression seemed almost lost. He obviously had not been listening, and Gibson, Adebayo, Hasan and Zane had already found partners. That left Yi and Ewing, who found each other.
Malfoy seemed annoyed, but he took out his pocket watch and put his thumb in the solution.  “Why do you care so much what colour it is?”
After three minutes of stunned confusion, the obvious occurred to Harry: that Malfoy was getting therapy, that Malfoy was Leblanc’s patient, and that Harry was never, ever going to use Doctor Leblanc as his therapist ever, not if she was seeing Malfoy. Something about it was just too strange.
“Not at all.  This is a friendly chat.  Now tell me what I need to know, or I’ll start using my hands instead of my wand.”
Malfoy tilted his head at Harry. “You can kill him as well,” he said, but Teddy was shaking his head again.
Tentatively, Malfoy reached a finger out—and then his finger was on Harry’s forehead, tracing the lightning bolt scar.  The scar had not ached since Voldemort’s death, and yet Malfoy’s finger made it feel sensitive.  No one had touched him there in so long, except that when Harry had been a child, Draco had kept moving Harry’s hair to look at it.  Maybe he’d just been reminding himself the child he was dealing with was Harry Potter, but when they’d both been adults, he’d never looked at it.  He’d mentioned it a few times, but only when he was angry—after his mum had died.  After that kiss.
Harry still couldn’t understand. He couldn’t breathe.
Harry’s quill.”  A quill lifted from one of the cubicles and raced over toward them, then Draco began to walk in the direction from which the quill had come.  Harry guessed the quill had come from adult-him’s desk, so now they knew where it was.
“You know how I always listen to Robards,” Savage said, opening a desk drawer.
“I’m glad that potion fell on me.”
Sniffing, Malfoy turned to look at him defiantly. “May I go?”
Malfoy blushed, then thrust his wand up again.  “
“But he was quite good-looking,” Harry said.
Harry demonstrated the rest of the holds with Fuentes, then stopped Malfoy before he left for his next class. “See me during office hours,” Harry told Malfoy.
“Harry,” Mister Malfoy said, then stopped.
“Use it?” Hanging onto Malfoy’s hand, Robards looked over his shoulder at the other Aurors. “Of course, we can use it. You did a good job making those pure-bloods think you were on their side, too.”
“Malfoy,” Harry said, running his hand over his shorn head.  “You said you needed it.”
“Hello Draco,” said the boy.
“No—” Harry began, but when he turned back to look, someone had moved, revealing the person Rune was talking to.
Harry looked down at his coffee. The still black of it could be comforting, sometimes.
Another long pause.  “I imagine that for Draco, hot chocolate and sitting in front of the fire means family.”
Harry covered Draco’s right hand with his own, covering the Dark Mark that had newly appeared on Draco’s skin.
Harry wanted to guess, but it seemed rude.
“All right,” Harry told him. “Well, I’m not
“It belongs to you,” Mister Malfoy said.
“Aren’t you?”
“What—?” Malfoy began.
They were mostly through the queue when Harry became aware of the soft talking at the back of the room. Malfoy’s head was bent toward Nyala, who had a worried look in her eyes every time the Boggart shifted. She hadn’t gone yet, and Harry recognized Malfoy’s posture. This was the way he looked when he was encouraging; Harry had seen it enough with Nyala to identify it, not to mention all the other Level Ones Malfoy had advised and encouraged over the past term. When you’d taken the same set of courses three times each, Harry supposed, you might as well be teaching the class.
Parkinson rolled her eyes. “He’s not a guest, obviously.”
“All right,” Harry said, because Malfoy sounded earnest, almost vulnerable, both of which made it easy to forget that he was Malfoy. “Pretend the memory could travel down from your head to your heart, then pretend it could radiate from there, and you could feel it. Spreading through your chest. Your arms. Your legs. It can be clean and light—maybe if your memory is joyful. Or it can be warm and heavy, if your memory is soft and comforting. Try to feel it in every part of you, right down to the tip of your wand. All right. Take your stance.”
“All right.”  Waving the fire away, Harry wrapped his arm around Draco again, pulling him so that he was against Harry’s chest, both Draco’s legs up on the sofa so that he could rest against Harry’s body.
Draco opened his mouth, seemed to think better of it, then closed his mouth.  His lips pursed, his forehead furrowed in thought.  “Well, what about you?” he asked, after another moment.  “Since I’m usually helping you, don’t you need someone else to help you?  And I bet you don’t know anyone half as clever as I am—”
Banishing the food, Harry came into the sitting room and closed the door, then followed Draco into the kitchen.  He was in the loo, kneeling before the toilet.  “Draco!” Harry rushed toward him, but Draco put out a hand.
“You’d do well to remember that there was a war in the first place,” said Savage, who had become an instructor after her retirement. “I didn’t see you there fighting He Who Must Not Be Named.”
Draco proceeded to lounge in the doorframe—he’d picked up this habit around now, then—and he had long hair.  Tied up.  In back.  With pieces falling down.  Around his face.  He looked—he looked . . . He should have looked like Lucius, perhaps, though Draco’s hair was neck-length, not past his shoulders as Lucius’s had been.  Draco didn’t look like Lucius.  He looked like a
Povey. “Why can’t we just—”
“Second best. After Teddy.”
“Yes,” Harry said.
“You’re talking about Reveal.”
“Oh.” Malfoy seemed interested in this as well. “Are they limited edition? Or are they making more?”
“That’s nice!” Harry called, still hoping she would go away.
Malfoy turned toward him. “I want to.”
“Anyway.” Malfoy tugged on his sleeve, the tight lacings on his forearm. “One would think my pedigree enough to earn an invite. It would help if I knew to whom I should make nice, but everyone is so bloody secretive about such things.”
“Mum made that up to indulge me,” Draco said.  “She obviously thought I was some kind of mewling infant in need of cosseting, but I’m eleven now.  I’m off to Hogwarts soon.  How do you think the other wizarding children will react if they see my mother mollycoddles me?  I—I mean . . .” Draco scowled.  “How do you think they
“Better?” Harry asked.
“Yeah, fuck me. Fuck me,” Harry said, spreading his legs still wider. “You can do anything, do anything you want to me, fuck me. Draco.”
“He approves,” Malfoy said.
“Yes.” Draco’s hips moved up a bit, this time on purpose. “Yes, yes, I want to please you. I want—”
“Graduating Level One puts you at fifty percent,” said Ron. “It’s a good thing Level Two doesn’t require Arithmancy.”
“See, that’s another thing you’d say in one of my elaborate fantasies: you fantasizing about fucking me while I was still a student—”
Harry edged closer again.  “Are you all right?  Does anything hurt?”
“Oh,” Harry said, realizing what he was doing. He let go of Malfoy’s neck. “Just a bit more,” Harry added, holding Malfoy’s arm instead, to keep it steady. Malfoy was beginning to get restless.
Dudley—
“I saved him from that Fiendfyre,” Harry suggested, waving his hand in a very poor imitation of the fyre. “Maybe he just . . . looks up to me.”
Harry didn’t want Teddy to apologize. To some extent, he didn’t even want Teddy to understand why he had held the press conference, because it was too soon. Let him believe that Aurors were the good guys, just for a little longer. Let him believe that it was just that simple.
Malfoy’s indicator solution for Wood-Eye Lye worked beautifully.  Harry’s problems with the Auror Department, however, persisted.  Harry didn’t want to complain to anyone, so he didn’t—except for Malfoy, just every once in a while.  Most people didn’t understand the intricacies of his cases anyway, and those who did—such as Savage and Ron—were also part of the problem.  And then there was Auror Vance.
,” Harry said, casting the spell at the empty hearth.  Then he began to cast the colour spells.
, but he couldn’t say it. To say it took too much energy, to reveal it took too much vulnerability, and Harry wanted to reveal that least of all to Malfoy, who might treasure such nakedness, or—worst of all—try to comfort him. Harry looked longingly at the bench, then away.
Draco’s breath made a guttering sound.  “Fuck.”
“I just feel . . .” Harry paused, gathering his thoughts. “I feel like I should be able to get away from him, you know? Or he should be able to get away from me. It’s such a big world; there’s no reason he has to be obsessed with me—not after all this time. But I think about the Reveal. The Academy. The Ministry. It’s all the same names as in the war. All the same ideas, too. All of it comes back. It all comes back.”
Malfoy tilted his head, looking a little bit the way he used to, when his face was rounder and he was better-looking, and his owl would come into the Great Hall clutching chocolates from his mother. Once the chocolates were dropped off, he always looked self-satisfied or else petulant he hadn’t got more, but when the owls were coming in, Harry had caught him looking wistful, once or twice, almost hungry. Harry had thought at the time Malfoy was just really wanting sweets, but he realized now that maybe Malfoy had looked that way because he missed his mum.
“Did someone call you scrawny?”
Taking the mug because he knew he was meant to, Harry watched to see what Mister Malfoy did.
“What?”
Kavika had told him, even though once, it hadn’t been.
to be in charge. They’re meant to have the power to change things, but they don’t want to change anything. Nothing ever changes, even if—don’t you think it should have been different? When Kingsley was Head Auror? And now he’s Minister for Magic, and that should be it, isn’t it? Someone like him, someone who fought in the war, someone who was in the Order of the Phoenix. It should be enough to end blood purism. But it’s not. We’re almost as divided as when Voldemort took the Ministry.”
potion was crossed out.
“But you showed it to me,” said Harry, really distressed about this now.  Maybe Draco wasn’t going to remember either, the way they had been friends.  “And there was a queen who was really stuck-up, and they put her in the sky too.  They put her in upside-down.”
“I think that Dumbledore had a ghost that didn’t grow old,” Harry said.
Instead of answering, Ron reached into his pocket, taking out a small rectangle about the size of his thumbnail. “It’s this week’s
Harry didn’t remember the last time he had seen one so close. Malfoy had jumped directly in front of the non-mag, thrusting himself between the man and the Dementor, and now—and now, he was getting Kissed.
“You want to move on,” said Kavika.
Harry had been wondering whether he might manage to read the elder Draco’s letter while the younger one babbled, but he looked up at Malfoy’s change in tone.
Malfoy held on to it.
“Yeah.”
Spragg’s voice had a pleasant cadence that always made it sound like he was saying something deeply meaningful, and Harry was still remembering another table, inside a Pensieve, only now he was beginning to recognize it. At the Trials the memories of the Death Eaters had been projected into the room, and Harry sometimes remembered them as though he had been there. At times, he had; at the trials, he’d seen Cedric’s death through seven pairs of eyes.
“I’ll take a cortado,” said Malfoy. “Go to La Reve. It’s the best.”
“Fuck,” Harry said, choked.  Magic moved through him, charging up his spine as though with an electric current.  It filled up his nerve endings, making him feel as though all of him was crackling with a dangerous energy, and fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck, what if he let it go; what he lost his temper with this child, who didn’t understand?  Draco was so small; he wasn’t the person that Harry knew, and Harry desperately wanted to protect him, but what if he couldn’t?  What he couldn’t protect him and keep him safe and make him feel loved, and the reason he couldn’t do it was that Harry was too fucked up himself?
“Harry,” Andromeda said, reaching for his hand.
“Oh,” Harry said.  “Are you sure it’s okay?”
Famously, Draco accepted the title but refused the stipend, a fact so startling it made the first page of the
“Yes, Harry?”
“And who was there in the end?” Penelope demanded. “Who was with Dumbledore on that Tower?”
“What were you doing?” Harry asked.  “The year you were nineteen, I mean.”
“Harry,” Petunia said.  “How is Dudley doing?”
“Do you need anything to eat?  Your stores have got low.  I’ll go shopping for you.  I can pick up fish and chips.”
Draco sat up from his sprawl, glancing at Harry and then mimicking his posture exactly.  Harry’s arm was along the back of the couch, so he brought it down to his lap.  Draco looked at Harry’s hand with interest, then jabbed his finger on the mark that said
“Oh,” Mister Malfoy said.  “Potter, calm down.”
“Heavens.”  Malfoy heaved a noisy sigh.
“Are you going with Penelope?” Harry asked. “She knows my favorite.”
“I’m not taking questions,” Harry told the trainee.
“Good.”  Draco turned back to the fire, which still had its green and blue, plus the yellow and red of natural fire.
“We were,” Draco said quickly.  “You put your thumb in all of them.”
Harry was still thinking about Draco’s furniture.  “Does that mean your flower-chair is ruined as well?”
“You pretended it didn’t matter to
“You threw
“I won’t tell.”
Good.
“Oh hello,” Malfoy said, nonchalantly, as though startled to see Harry here, when Harry had just bloody said to bloody come in.
“Right.  Jewel tones.”
“Plenty of people do.”
“Not really,” Harry said immediately.
“I wouldn’t be surprised,” Harry muttered.
“Yes,” Draco said again.  Going over to her, Draco took two of the mugs off the tray.  “Thank you,” he said, looking into her eyes meaningfully.
Once the potions had been taken care of for the night, Harry and Draco almost always went to the sitting room in front of the fire.  There they had hot chocolate, and Draco taught Harry spells, or read to him from the fairy tale book, or played more Exploding Snap with him.  When Harry asked to look at more photos, they looked at the rest of the album, but after that Draco said he hadn’t any more.
Spragg. “It wasn’t his—”
“Sure,” said Ron, but something about his voice made Harry look at him again.
“My other job,” said Harry, eating his sausage roll.
“Tried it,” Malfoy said, quickly pulling his sleeve down and shoving his hand into his pocket. “Anaemic for a week.”
Malfoy brightened, which softened him somewhat, making him look almost pleasant.
“I’m a lost cause.” Smiling, she waited strategically while he pulled the blocks all apart. “Flashbacks?” she said, once they were hovering in a line above his lap.
“Right,” Draco said.  “They’re long chapters.  I read fast.  What’s happening?”
A blond man stood there looking stricken.  “Potter?”
Malfoy stared at him.
“Are you all right?” Harry asked.  He’d come to check on Draco once his Patronus had told him Draco had aged again, then he’d told Draco about the potions he needed.
Kavika nodded. “Very well. Move forward. You teach a week of classes, no Draco. A month. How do you feel at the end of the day? Are you thinking about what you did? Are you reminded of it? What about the other trainees—will they react?”
Someone tittered—maybe because of the poor joke, or maybe because he was so obviously already warmed up; Harry could still feel sweat at his brow. The trainees turned to the warm-ups he’d taught them, however—or most of them. Malfoy stood there staring at Harry as though he’d grown a second head.
“Academy instruction is physical,” Harry agreed. “I suppose I get my exercise.”
Ron’s face fell a bit.  “I’ve been saving.”
.”  They did it again.
“Did Mum and Dad disown me?”
“One of my students.” Harry ran his fingers over the scar on his hand after all. “She’s . . . she’s just taken up a lot of Spragg’s ideas.”
“What?” Harry asked with his mouth full.
“You admired me?” Harry said, shocked.
“I came twice inside you, Harry.” Draco’s voice was soft. “My prick won’t be able to do it again unless I cast the spell. Do you want me to? So I can come inside you again?”
Malfoy looked as though he wanted to pretend he hadn’t heard him again, but instead he grudgingly turned his face to Harry’s, not quite meeting Harry’s eyes.
“Oh, my dear Potter.”  Malfoy feigned disquiet.  “I had no idea we were meant to be exclusive.”
Harry swallowed, his eyes drifting back down to Malfoy’s lips. “Here you are,” he said, his voice hoarse.
“Malfoy,” Harry said, still quite patient. “You can’t even cast a Patronus.”
“But you said we’re not friends,” Harry said.
“Prisoner in my own home, am I?” Draco said, tone again sardonic.
“Who?” Harry asked.
“What?”
“Teddy’s Nyala’s date?” Ron said, but Harry was turning back to the hall, where he was sure the small commotion suggested Teddy’s arrival.
Harry stared at the ugly expression on Draco’s face.  “Let’s go to the Leaky Cauldron,” Harry said suddenly.  “It still might be dangerous to go out, but we’ll wear disguises.”
“I think it would suck.” Yin shrugged. “I think it would suck, having this line I say about my therapist, when I don’t have a therapist.”
is you have to bring
“I’ll pick you one up,” Gareth said, just as a knock came at the door.
“Oh,” Harry said, jerking under him. It was a lot of touching, both of Draco’s hands on him, his upper body strewn against Harry’s chest, extra weight pressing down to hold himself up so his hands could get between them. “Fuck.” Harry arched.
“What the fuck for?”
“Mm,” Malfoy said but did not relax a fraction.
“Doing what?” Harry demanded.
“It’s inconsequential to me.”  Malfoy hitched a shoulder.  “It’s not as though I care.”
Harry. We’re—we’re central to each other’s lives; we’re—”
Harry stared at him.  “I said that so you’d stop.”
“Dragons can be whatever they want,” Draco said.  “Because they’re dragons.”
“Oh, there,” Malfoy said, as though he had only just now understood that he was to be Harry’s sparring partner. “Sure, I can go there,” Malfoy went on easily, slipping his hands into the pockets of his track bottoms, meandering in Harry’s direction. “I can be your partner, if no one chose you. I mean, I can see why no one would choose you.” Malfoy glanced around the class, still meandering, voice almost lazy. His gaze went back to Harry. “You’re so—wouldn’t want to seem like a teacher’s pet. No one wants that. I never wanted that. Where do I stand? Here? Okay.” Without waiting for an answer, Malfoy claimed the spot next to Harry, turning to face the class as though to thank his audience.
rather desperately in the loo. Malfoy with Teddy, Malfoy after Nyala’s Boggart, Malfoy fighting Fenrir’s followers in Diagon Ally, hugging Teddy violently in the aftermath.
“In Level Two.”
Malfoy reared back, but he went still when Rune put his hand on Malfoy’s arm. “Terrorism is not the same as protest. And terrorists aren’t the same as soldiers.”
“You weren’t my adversary,” Harry said.
“And I’m helping you,” Draco said.  “Let’s go.”
There’d been nothing—except the occasional cup of coffee, sitting in a warm bubble of magic on Harry’s desk.
Hermione just shrugged.  “He was always rather skilled at potions,” she pointed out.
Harry had tried not to ask the Minister of Magic for too much, but he was getting desperate.  Explaining the situation, Harry tried to present the evidence as objectively as possible, without letting his previous animosity for Vance or Robards get into it.
The next morning Harry woke up in a bed.  A real bed, with a real pillow, and sheets, and everything.
Sighing, Harry came back over to him.  “Look, whatever illegal potion trade’s going on here, I think some people at the Ministry are connected somehow—some of them might not even know they are, but I can’t tip them off.  I don’t want anyone but you knowing that I know about this place.  I’ve told you—you’re better at this than anyone I’ve ever met.  No one else can do it.”
She did play a few games of Exploding Snap with him, which wasn’t nearly as interesting as playing with Draco, though she did tell Harry about her grandson Teddy.  He was a Metamorphmagus, which meant he could change his appearance at will.  Andromeda said this mainly resulted in him having blue hair and scales and occasional horns, but that sometimes he wouldn’t look like the same person from one day to the next.
“How could I know?” Vinicius demanded. “He’s two meters tall. And green!”
Malfoy was pretending to look aggrieved, but he closed his eyes, his face smoothing into an expression of concentration. Slowly, his body took the stance. Then his brow began to knit, and the frown creased his face again. “All right,” Malfoy said, opening his eyes.
“I’m not,” Draco said.  “I’m going to read.
“It’s . . .” Harry shifted some more. “I don’t feel that way. The way he does. It’s—and he’s doing these things—the coffee. Teddy. What if he expects—? I mean, nothing would happen, even if he did expect it; it’s just . . . it’s . . .
“Not a boy-lover,” Harry said.  “Just a regular poof.”
Fuck.
Draco stared at him, his chest heaving, his eyes bright, looking a bit more like he had when he was thirteen than he had in some while.  “So, you don’t even know,” he said finally, his shoulders slumping.  “You don’t even know if we become friends.”
been saving.  Even more than I realized.”
“Rose has got red hair,” Harry said.  “It’s really big.”
?” someone cried.
Robards gave Malfoy that smile he gave everyone he despised. Harry would know, as he had been the recipient of that smile many times.
“Then why do you have it?”
“One generally uses a broom.”
“What happened to not wanting
“I invited everyone to the pub.”
“It would be my pleasure to show you, Harry.”  Draco’s voice was deep and warm, which made it sound as though he really meant it.
“No, Harry,” Mister Malfoy said.  “Your cousin didn’t go to Hogwarts.”
“I thought not.  Would you like some of that treacle tart?”
“Draco Malfoy, that’s who,” said Penelope, and several people clamored to reply:
The name
get jam on it.  The bacon, to Harry’s disappointment, was on a dish in the middle instead of having floated directly onto his plate, like the toast and eggs.
“But . . .” Draco’s eyes sought out Harry’s Patronus.  She had a wary eye on Heloise, who had gone to perch on the back of Draco’s chair when Harry had taken away her letters.  “But what do you mean, it knew what you felt?”
Harry had missed a lot of things, he supposed, because he hadn’t had a mum, and Malfoy had been a prat. This thought had occurred to him before, but he had not felt a lot of pressure to spend sympathy on a bigot and a bully. He could spend it now, Harry realized, but then Malfoy straightened, angling his face away.
Usually the Pallas Arch, the lawn outside it, and Crowley Stott were illusioned to look like one of Cambridge’s hundreds of academic buildings; everyone who passed it mistook it for one college or another, and no one paid it any mind. Meanwhile, the buildings of the Academy within the Arch were inside a pocket, much like Number Twelve. If a non-magical person passed through the Arch, they simply found themselves on the other side of the Academy, never knowing they had skipped past acres of buildings, lawns, and lands.
“You do use potions when you help me usually.  And you’re not under restriction anymore, so you can use magic if you want.”  Since Draco still didn’t look happy about it, Harry added, “You don’t have to help me if you don’t want.”
“Well, not
“Pardon?”
He lay there for a while, but he didn’t hear Draco snoring.
“Malfoy,” Harry said after the class, as the trainees were heading out of the room. “Stay here a moment.”
But by then the man had regained his footing and was already shouting something back.
Graduation day dawned cold and grey but brightened into a fine May day by early afternoon. Level Ones always attended as well as faculty, and celebrated members of the Auror force gave the Level Twos their graduation certificates under the Timothy Tree. Harry had always liked graduation. Even though he didn’t appreciate crowds of people, he was usually proud of his trainees. Seeing them succeed gave him hope they could bring a new perspective to the force, whose members seemed to be growing more narrow-minded with each passing day. Only a few exceptions were left—Ron among them.
“Harry. I . . .”
Harry’s breath caught. His eyes closed; Malfoy was, in that moment, too beautiful to see. “Please,” he whispered.
“Oh.”  Still feeling strangely empty, Harry fumbled in his robe for the little bottle.
Malfoy perked up. “You don’t? That’s great. We should compare notes. What type of pornography do you prefer? I’m partial to the—”
Malfoy was sitting on the floor, knees up, not looking at him.
“I wouldn’t mind,” Draco began, then swallowed.  “I mean.  It’s terribly dodgy, isn’t it, the Leaky?  They let Muggles in.  But I saw someone eating fish and chips there, through a window, once, and it seemed very—well, I suppose I could . . . I could stomach it.  If forced.”
“Wand slipped,” Malfoy said in that light, quick way. “Travers distracted me. Are you sure that kid is all right? Politically, I mean. I think he’s a purist.”
“I will, if she stops
“Oh,” Bickford said, bouncing again. “So that’s true, then? He can’t cast a Patronus?”
“No,” Harry said steadily.  “I said my mum defeated him.  And then he came back again—on the back of Quirrell’s head.  Then he came back again and opened the Chamber of Secrets.  And then he came back for real fourth year.”
“Can I help?” Draco asked, swaggering over to the lab bench where the water was.  “I’m excellent at potions.  What am I saying?  You know that.  I’ll bet I help you with that as well.  Were we Severus’s favourite students?”
Draco had stopped whinging altogether when they got to Flourish and Blotts, so Harry still knew the way to Draco’s heart, he guessed.  Then they’d got more fish and chips at the Leaky, and now they’d stopped in front of Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes.  “You can’t make me.  There’s no way I’m going into a shop run by—” Draco stopped talking, his attention caught by something in the window.
Harry had been a different person when he was a kid—an orphan, locked in a cupboard.  He’d been a different person at Hogwarts as well—a student, fighting a war.  Now he was an Auror.  He had a job and friends and wizarding world peace.  Everything was so much better; Harry didn’t think about those other things.
“You’re talking about earlier today,” Malfoy said.
“When did you think I meant?”
“I didn’t have a critique.”
“Let me ask you again,” Mister Malfoy said in that low, gentle voice.  “Has anyone ever hurt you when something—odd happened around you?  Something that might have been you doing magic accidentally?”
“You have a problem with Draco’s sexuality?” Spragg.
Christ.  It wasn’t even Malfoy’s fault.  Harry had drunk the Veritaserum and the Firewhiskey.  Malfoy hadn’t planned it at all.  He’d done nothing wrong; Harry had just—babbled like a fool, and he wasn’t even sure why he’d done it.  Malfoy had just . . . been there.  And he’d asked—sort of.  Not really.  Christ.
Harry almost drew his face out of the Pensieve, because he certainly didn’t have to listen to filth like this, when Malfoy’s quiet voice cut through Parkinson’s ranting.
Then Draco was kissing him, and Harry finally found the strength to bring his hands up, pull Draco’s head away, ripping away the kiss. “You already are good,” Harry told him, pushing him off.
“I’m glad you told me, Harry. What else has been going on? How were the hols?”
“Harry,” Draco said, his voice harsh.  His hand was reaching for Harry’s, when someone shouted.
Harry didn’t know many phone numbers.  Mrs. Figg’s was written down somewhere in a drawer at Number Four, Privet Drive, just in case, for emergencies.  Other than that, Harry knew the number for Number Four and 9-9-9.  He’d never really needed to call that many people.  Sucking in a breath, Harry went ahead and tried touching the numbers for Number Four.  As he touched them, they appeared at the top of the screen as though the device could feel which numbers he touched, just as it had felt the swipe.
Harry frowned in incomprehension.  “Malfoy,” he started to say, but Malfoy was already moving away.  Harry grabbed his arm.
In Harry’s room, he let Draco go, then pulled out his wand to Banish Draco’s waistcoat. He was going to do it with Draco’s shirt as well, but Draco’s fingers wrapped around Harry’s wand, and Harry paused. “Can I—I want.” Draco licked his lips. “Take it off me the Muggle way.”
“Perhaps.”
“Isn’t that Reveal? That’s the whole point.”
“Malfoy,” Harry said, reaching out.
“I made some for you,” Harry said, gesturing.  “There.”
“Select a memory of Malfoy,” said Yin. “Not a recent one—one from the old days. Preferably something that makes you feel like you would be doing an unkindness or injustice to yourself if you went out with him.”
“You?” Draco looked at him incredulously.  “You, hero of the Wizarding World, fucked up?”
“Okay,” Harry said, reaching out for the beaker and the hair.  “I’ll . . . I’ll try it.”
“Hm?”
“Immediately, Potter.”  Mister Malfoy grabbed his arm.  Before Harry could further protest, Mister Malfoy was swishing his stick and they were squeezing through blackness, the sensation almost familiar by now.
Harry turned. Malfoy’s hand was on the door knob, his expression knit with some inner conflict. At last, it seemed to smooth out. “You know you saved the world, right?” Malfoy said. “I mean, not just the one time. Over and over.”
“And this is my job,” Harry said.  This was his life, and fuck Robards if he was going to stand in Harry’s way.
“Do you like that, Harry?” Draco’s voice was gentle, soft, eager. “Does that make you hard?”
“You wanted to please me. Didn’t you?” Harry rubbed his soft cock against Draco’s hip. “Please me again, Draco. Let me undo it. Let me watch you come.”
Draco huffed a laugh.  “Go to sleep.”
parchment,” Harry said.
Malfoy sniffed. “I’ll stay.”
“Mental healers talk about facing your feelings, dealing with the truth of the matter, but the truth is that some truths change depending on what you believe, and what you believe can change depending on what you do. Sometimes it is entirely appropriate to act as though the world is as you want it to be. You’d be surprised at how much you can change that way.”
“Because they’re blood supremacists,” Harry said, as though Kavika didn’t know.
“I meant for me,” Draco said, his hand moving on Harry’s cock, not so methodically now. “You’re perfect for me. You’re mine. You were made for me.”
“I don’t care.”  Harry took off his glasses and put them in his pocket.
“Don’t schmooze, you lose,” said Teddy.
More slowly, Harry got off the broom, looking around. His office was peaceful and quiet, despite the noise and chaos outdoors. “Did you seal off my office?”
This did nothing to mollify Harry, even though Draco seemed amused by it.  “Did I get—incarcerated?”
“Why?”
“Stay,” said Robards.
“Take care of it,” Draco repeated. “Reach down for that thick dick of yours and tug on it. I want to watch you play with it.”
“I’ve narrowed down a list of ingredients based on those diagnostics I ran, but I’ve quite a bit of work left,” Draco said.
“Attending Academy,” Penelope told Savage, “so I could become an Auror and fight. Are you really going to condemn me because I was too young to fight your battles?”
Harry gave Draco his own wand back, then went to do as Draco said.
“Oh.”  Draco’s eyes widened a bit.  “I forgot.”
“That one,” Harry told Vinicius, pointing.
“You just assumed I was talking about you,” Draco went on.  “You always were so arrogant, Potter.”
“Saying that your uncle was awful, ignorant, and cruel is not the same as saying non-mags are ignorant and cruel. It’s the same as saying your uncle was ignorant and cruel, and that’s all.”
“None taken,” Harry said, taking a sip of Butterbeer because otherwise he really was going to laugh.  Being with Draco at this age was like being on a whirlwind.  Also, he was just so, so gay.  Harry didn’t understand why he’d never noticed.
“Where did you sleep?” Harry repeated, feeling petulant.
Draco rolled his eyes.  “Don’t be a nit.  You can’t be yourself if you’re not ahead.  You can’t do what you want to do—you’ll be in a hovel, and you’ll have no money, and everyone will be casting sturgeons.  How could you possibly be yourself then?  Once you get ahead, then you can be yourself.  Merlin, I’m worried for you, not having parents to teach you this kind of thing.  I—I must have mentored you a bit, did I?”  Looking very pleased about this, Draco went on, “Took you under my wing, did I?  A bit like Vince and Greg.”
“But . . .” Harry found himself picking up his smoothie. He put it back down again. Then he picked it up. “But did you
“Don’t tell Zidwidley.”  Savage winked.  “I’ll administer the solution; you take Ludville’s statement.”
“To whom?”
“Too comfortable?” said Milligan. “Are things getting boring?”
“Potter!”
“Yes,” Draco said.
Draco flinched anyway when Harry began casting, and Harry tried to make the spells even gentler, wrapping the protection spells around Draco like something warm and soft.  He wasn’t sure whether Draco had expected to be hurt for some reason—the things Draco had told him already about Lucius didn’t make it sound as though Lucius would draw his wand on his son, but you never knew with these things.  Meanwhile Draco’s eyes were luminous; he watched the movement of Harry’s wand with his lips slightly parted.
“Auror Weasley.” Malfoy paused. “Very tall, as always.”
Draco coloured slightly, his cheeks going pink.  “Yes, well,” he said, standing hastily.  “Finish up your breakfast, then, and we can be on our way.”
“Because you’re not going to pass this class,” Harry said, “and I try to help trainees who are struggling.”
“Yes?” Draco’s lips hovered right over Harry’s ear.
Harry just watched, feeling strangely empty inside, a sense of detachment—because this still had nothing to do with him.  He should pity him, Harry supposed.  Hermione would pity him.  Harry wasn’t as nice as Hermione, he guessed.
,” Draco said, appalled.
“Excuse me,” Harry said, standing abruptly. Professor Burbage was screaming, and yet Harry managed to push back his chair calmly, stand, and walk out of the room, leaving the memory behind, alone with them, pleading with them. He walked out of the conference chamber into what should have been fresh air, but it wasn’t; the air was still too hot. He needed to be not here.
“Yes,” Malfoy said.  “Good.  I think that’s all of it.”
“I reckon so,” Harry said slowly. “Malfoy never had enough shame to begin with, I suppose.”
Harry’s heart rose into his throat. The blank space where it used to be hollowed into a cavern inside him.
“Isn’t that how you said it worked?”
“I’m relaxed.”
“Why do you have to be so . . .”  Draco pressed his lips together, breathing hard through his nose.  His eyes were bright.  “Fuck,” he said, expelling a breath.  He leaned in close, forehead almost touching Harry’s again, but Harry’s glasses were in the way.  “Why do you always have to be so bloody hot,” he muttered.
“Oh.”
Harry left Draco on the sofa, but Harry still couldn’t bear to go to sleep.  He didn’t know whether Draco had slept, whether falling unconscious counted.  Instead, Harry worked on the chair some more, trying to restore the charred bits.  Next, he worked on the table, then the books.  Draco had cast the fire spells across the middle of the row of bookshelves, but the flames hadn’t had a lot of time, so only the books on those shelves were singed.  They seemed mostly salvageable, but Harry had no clue how to go about restoring the burned parts.  Maybe Draco would know.
“There are really wooden eyes in it?” Harry said, and Malfoy glared.
“Oh.” Malfoy took a swift breath, and Harry could hear the recollection in it. “I was—don’t . . . half of the things I said then were at least seventy-five percent falsehood.”
“There’s no need to hurry, Harry.” Draco’s hand lazily stroked Harry’s hair. “You can undress me slowly.”
“It’s not
“Potter,” Malfoy said.
Draco made a face at him.  “Why do you even have that book?  It’s for babies.”
“Oh.”  Harry stopped trying to comb his hair, but he kept his hands on his head.  Covering his face seemed like a good idea for his next question.  “Was it the books?”
Realizing Yin couldn’t have seen his nod, Harry cleared his throat. “Yes.”
“Oh,” Harry said.
“Yes.  You’ve got to pour the solution into something—not too shallow, so they can submerge their thumb past the first knuckle.  Then you’ve got to make them hold it in there for forty-six seconds per stone they weigh.  If they take it out and their finger’s changed colour, they’ve taken the counteragent.  If it hasn’t, they haven’t.”
“Yes.”  Draco didn’t sound terribly excited about this.
Draco froze, looking absolutely wild for a moment.  “What?”
“What do you mean, he’s good?” Harry asked, not distracted by the explosion.  The cards had already done that five times.
“Trainees, yes,” said Baggot. “It’s very reprehensible. No one wants bigotry. You said it about those Death Eater children in the war. Draco Malfoy. Raised that way. Couldn’t help himself.”
Draco still had that wrecked look on his face.  “It’s not enough,” he said, his voice catching.  “It’s not ever going to be enough.”
Potter is, once again, operating outside his jurisdiction, just like he did when he was in the Department—which he is now, manifestly, not.”
“I didn’t think I was ever going to get you, idiot.  And anyway.  You yelling at Alby, I realized I had—I had more than just feelings of—of attraction.  I liked you.  But it wasn’t until that day—that day I came to yours, with the indicator solution.”  Draco looked down, blushing a bit.  “Do you remember?”
“I hate your fucking fox,” Draco yelled after him, as Harry went back to the kitchen.
“There.”  Turning back to him, Draco sneered.  “So, I am one.  I’ve told you that, have I?  And you believe it; you think I’m a boy-lover too.”
Malfoy tried
The next slap to Harry’s cheeks punched the words right out of him: “Fuck me.”
“That means you have to communicate,” Mister Malfoy went on.  “You have to tell me if you don’t feel good.  If you’re hungry or afraid or sleepy.  Do you understand?”
“Why would a manoeuvre used
“Oh, no.”  Draco sniffled.  “Mother says—she says it doesn’t matter what you feel on the inside.  On the outside you always have to be courteous.  It’s this thing called decorum—like decorating.  That’s what being discreet is about, you know.  You decorate so people don’t know, only—I’m not good at it yet.  Mother says everything on my insides always comes out.”
“So that’s how you know so much about confiscating illegal dragons.”  Enough time had passed since Norberta that Harry could feel amused.
“That tickles,” Harry said, shifting.
Harry had once tried to kill himself. He hadn’t done it in the best way possible. Or maybe he had, given that it hadn’t worked. Casting Avada Kedavra on yourself was always tricky; you had to mean it.
