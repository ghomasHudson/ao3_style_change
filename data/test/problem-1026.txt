"Very well, be quick about it, Dragon." He dropped the wrapped bezoar into Draco's waiting grasp. Draco stole a quick peck on Harry’s cheek before he hurried out of the room. The door slammed behind him, leaving Harry and Snape alone in the private lab.
He felt Harry’s arms wrap around him, pulling him toward the Fifth-year boys’ room without breaking the embrace. In the distance, he could hear Blaise’s fists pounding on the entrance. But the other boy would give up eventually and despite his quick temper, it would fade quickly too. Especially once Draco revealed that the essay was under Blaise’s pillow the whole time. And until he did, Draco was safe in Harry’s arms and thankful for the Write of House Protection.
The Slytherin rolled his eyes. He dumped the package on the boy's lap, "Go ahead," He watched Harry peel the paper back in a reverent way, even as his fingers quivered from the effort. It was only some brown paper, not even gift wrap. But it didn't seem to matter one bit to the Gryffindor. Draco ran his fingers through his hair, but quickly tired of watching the boy fumble with the parcel, "Shove over, Potter." Harry shifted, feeling the mattress dip beneath the blond's weight. Heat seeped into Harry's side when Draco's arm hooked around him. His larger hands steadied Harry's smaller ones. Nestling against the Slytherin, Harry managed to tug the package open. He lifted a piece of stiff parchment addressed to Draco. Brows furrowing, he read,
if I remember it right.” He turned to meet Draco’s gaze, his lips turned up in a smug grin, “I won the bet.” Though it made his head pound, Harry laughed a throaty laugh that Draco was sure would be loud enough to summon Madam Pomfrey. Not wanting to be interrupted, he pressed his hand against Harry’s mouth.
"Because it brought us together," He drawled. Lifting the old trainer by its laces, it dangled in front of them, "Would you like to do the honors, or shall I?" Harry pressed his hands against his flushing cheeks, warming his chilled fingers.
Draco fished a cookie out of the tin. He dunked the cookie into his hot cocoa before taking a big bite. Harry grinned before doing the same. Luna didn’t even glance up from her notebook, but she did summon her snack to enjoy while she wrote.
“How did you-” He stopped short, seeing Luna grinning smugly from the other side of the room. She winked at Harry, “Never mind, I already know.” He leaned forward and wrapped his arms around Draco’s neck. Going in for another kiss, Harry was gladder than ever that Luna Lovegood was such a snitch.
“You don’t have to. I’m not very good,” Harry warned, gaze falling to his lap. But the other boy flicked his wand and ordered all the pieces to return to their original positions. Harry peeked up at the other boy.
“Bits and pieces from both,” Harry admitted, his shoulders caving under the weight of the man’s gaze. His eyes flickered to the forgotten, bubbling cauldron. The thick brew inside burbled intensely. The mixture threatened to spill over the rim, “Professor, the potion!”
The steps groaned beneath them and Harry tightened his grip on Draco's hand, "I go down these steps at least once a week. Don't worry your pretty little head about them," The blond teased.
Harry gulped, “Relax Potter, you’re a snake right now. You have our whole house’s protection whether they like it or not.” He nodded but he didn’t find much comfort in the words.
“It’s fine. If you want to make it up to me, I’ve been invited to a dinner tomorrow night and I need a plus one.” Harry’s eyes widened behind the lenses of his glasses. He brushed any remaining hairs off the back of his neck.
"Shameful, Potter, just shameful," A sleepy drawl started Harry out of his thoughts. He turned to see Draco propped up on his elbows, lines creasing his pale cheeks from the sheets, “swing those up here. I need to fix them." Harry nodded. He lifted his feet into Draco's reach and watched the blond's graceful ministrations on his laces, "Feeling better this morning?" Draco asked. His tongue poked between his thin lips in concentration.
“Some of that jasmine tea and a tin of those biscuits you brought me last month.” Draco turned to Harry who was still squirming on the countertop. Deciding to give him a little reprieve, he said,
Harry's grey sock squelched against the pebbles of the rock beach. He grimaced, staring down at his one remaining trainer. A puddle of lake water pooled around him. Sighing, he watched the tentacle of the giant squid wave mockingly back at him. Harry's shoe dangled off one of its suction cups by a pair of grubby laces. The squid shot a single spray of ink, splattering across Harry's glasses before dipping back beneath the water's surface.
“But-” Before Harry could argue any further, Draco shoved him in and let the tapestry go. Harry was plunged into darkness. He swallowed, edging along the wall until the passage opened wider. Another curtain draped across the passageway. Harry swept the curtain aside, blinking in the low lighting of Snape’s lab. He glanced around for his professor, but the lab was empty save a cauldron simmering on one of the worktables.
"It's okay Malfoy, it was just the elves. They brought us a snack." Harry snatched one of the tins, prying the lid open to reveal its brimming contents. He passed Draco a mug and offered him the tin, “Luna and I made them earlier.”
Surprise! I was only planning on this being a one-shot story, but I felt a little inspired by the comments to expand it. So, here's a bonus ficlet for you all. Hope you enjoy and are staying safe out there!
"Pull up a stool, Potter." Harry scampered across the room to retrieve his stool and placed it beside his professor, "I'm sure you're aware I attended school with your parents and their friends?" Harry nodded. Fumes from the bubbling potion fogged his lenses, but his eyes were wide behind the glasses, "And that your mother and I grew up together?" Harry shook his head. His mouth fell open, but he clammed shut again in case the man decided not to continue, "Yes, well that is a story for another time, perhaps." His usual piercing gaze seemed far away through the haze of the bubbling potion, "Bring me some of those vials and stoppers from the table," He said.
Draco sighed. He dropped onto his favorite overstuffed armchair, lifting a tasseled pillow to his lap. Picking absently at the threads, he launched into his account of what transpired between them the night before. He glazed overseeing Harry’s wrist. The boy clearly didn’t want to talk about that, “So, I’m stuck in here as a Slytherin until Umbridge is gone?” Harry asked. He tugged on his shirt collar, it suddenly felt far to tight around his neck.
“What does it tell you about me?” Harry asked. Draco smiled down into his tea. He shook his head.
“Good morning, did you neglect to tell Potter than he was allowed to use the furniture as a member of our house?” Draco snorted. He shook his head.
Massive buckets with questionable contents were strung up above the opening to the common room. They lilted and strained against the ropes holding them up. Rings of powder circled the floor in front of the entrance. Over in one corner of the room, a group of First-year girls sat in a circle sharpening sticks. They giggled and waved to Harry before returning to their task. Another group of seventh years gathered around a cauldron, something thick bubbling wickedly inside.
The fingers pressed against his ears to mutter the password, but they tensed against Harry’s cowlicks. Another mutter of the password resulted in huffs of hair tickling the back of Harry’s neck.
Draco draped a sheet around Harry’s shoulders, breathing close to his neck when he tucked it into one of Harry’s new sweaters. Harry bit his lip.
"Christmas holidays," Harry mumbled. He offered no other words. Draco nodded. His slender fingers twisted through the strands of Harry's wild hair, massaging his scalp and making the Gryffindor melt deeper into his arms. The blond continued his ministrations until Harry was seconds from drifting off to sleep. Keeping his tones soothing, Draco muttered.
“None?” Draco nodded. He pushed himself to his feet, dragging Harry up and over to one of the couches. The blond sat, pulled Harry down beside him, and arranged Harry’s legs over his lap.
“For everyday use, and because I’ve got the day robe on it’s appropriate to wear if I’m invited to a daytime event like a tea.” Draco nodded, sipped his tea, and placed the set back on the table.
Draco threw his arms around Harry, squeezing the air out of his lungs.
"Get some rest, I think you're a bit barmy from the squid ink right now." Harry frowned, but burrowed deeper into the soft mattress. He squinted at the blond from beneath his drooping eyelids and watched him turn away. But before sleep dragged Harry back down, Draco was at his side again. Warm breath tickled Harry's ear when the Slytherin stooped down beside him, "Why couldn't I summon another pair of shoes for you earlier?" He asked. Draco's gentle tones lulled Harry deeper toward sleep.
"Help, please," Potter mumbled out. Draco watched, his manicured brows rising, as the scarlet and gold vanished off of the boy's robes. The green and silver colors of Slytherin took their place. Both boys stared down at the robes for a fraction of a second until Harry's eyes glazed over and closed. He passed out cold on the floor. Biting his lip, Draco stole one last glance to the end of the hall before scooping his arms beneath Harry's and dragging him over the threshold into the Slytherin common room. His eyes caught a flash of pink tweed that made his hackles raise before the opening sealed behind them.
“Good evening sleeping beauty, I wondered when you were going to grace us with your presence again.” Draco teased his fingers through a sleep mussed cowlick near the back of Harry’s neck, “You’ll find we’ve been busy.” Harry gently shook off the blond and stared at Slytherins’ handiwork.
"That was Poppy. She needs a bezoar from my stores. Apparently one of the first-year Hufflepuffs took it upon himself to sample a Belladonna flower he found on the grounds." Draco hopped up from his seat.
“I know. It’s just hard to remember sometimes.” Draco nodded, “And I’d ask for help with my essay but some tosser left my textbook behind a rusty suit of armor.” Rolling his eyes, Draco reached down into his schoolbag on the floor and emerged with his copy of the book.
Shaking his head, Snape pointed out where Draco still blocked the entrance to the lab with his arms crossed, “I believe you’ll find that a bond once formed is not so quickly broken, Mr. Potter. Regardless of the colors you wear, they consider you one of their own.”
“Sorry? Draco smirked, pushing a teacup with three cubes of sugar and a healthy dash of cream into Harry’s hands. He crossed his legs, waiting for Harry to take a sip. Harry lifted the cup to his lips and took a drink. A light taste that reminded him of apples washed over his tongue. He let out a happy sigh, settling deeper into the cushions.
He retreated to his plush chair in the corner to watch Draco prepare the tea. If this first lesson was anything to go off of, it seemed the clothes made the lord. But there had to be much more than outfits. Once the kettle was on, Draco dipped back through the beaded curtains to fetch teacups. He returned with a set of deep blue cups with silver rims. Little silver flecks speckled the surface like a night sky. Draco pressed one of the cups into Harry’s hands. A waft of lavender tickled his nose. He watched the blond slid into the chair beside him. Draco crossed his legs, hands folded on his knees, “Now, let’s go over when you think it’s appropriate to wear an outfit like this.”
“We’ve got to do something about that snitch.” Draco nodded. He stood up to go retrieve the popcorn off the floor before the elves could scold them for making a mess.
Harry’s eyes widened. Had Draco just called him Harry? Before he could question it, the portrait guarding the opening turned back to them.
Draco strode into the Great Hall, over to the sliver of a table that was set aside for the eighth-year students. He slid into a seat across from his new silent Gryffindor. Raising one of his manicured eyebrows with a silent question, the blond waited for a reply. Harry offered a brief wave to Draco before returning to his pumpkin juice, in response. Nodding, Draco grinned. The game was still on. Potter hadn’t given it up yet. As much as he enjoyed the silence, Draco couldn’t help himself but prod the other boy a little.
“Fine. I was warned.”
"You were out for a few hours." Harry started at the soft drawl from beside him. Draco leaned forward on a stool beside the Gryffindor's bed, "Madam Pomfrey said the ink should be completely out of your system by Monday, but she wants to keep you here until then to make sure you're in the clear."
“He’s the worst I’ve ever had.” Harry frowned, mouth opening for an argument. He was trying his best. They hadn’t started all that long ago. Draco couldn’t expect a miracle. Before he could get a word out, one of Draco’s fingers pressed against his lips to shush him, “But since he’s my first, he’s lucky enough to be the best one too.” Harry flushed from how close the blond was to him. He wriggled away from his grasp and retreated back to his seat on the counter. Draco shook his head, smiling softly at Harry before turning to Severus, “What can I get for you?” He asked.
Harry hopped up and collected an armful of the vials, making a clatter when he brought them to the professor, "Carefully," The man ordered as Harry set them down, “Your mother and I were friends. Your father and his group of hooligan Gryffindor friends, however, were no friends of mine. Your father didn’t like that Lily gave me the time of day, and they took it out on me that she did.”
Before he had them fully buttoned, Draco pushed the curtain aside and pulled Harry into the light. Draco circled around him. He tugged the sleeves down on Harry’s arms, smoothing out the material before folding them into crisp cuffs around his elbows.
“Good eyes, Potter.” Harry’s green eyes widened at the compliment. He ducked his head, a soft smile growing on his lips, “Yes. It does and before any of us knew what was happening my colors changed. I was a Gryffindor for one night until the sun rose, and the threat had been effectively neutralized.” Harry nodded.
Draco swore. He lifted Harry back to his feet, before scrambling to his own. He closed his fingers around Harry’s wrist, tugging him quickly toward a wall hanging of a snake. Sliding the tapestry aside, Draco revealed an opening with a narrow passageway,
Draco leaned down, muttering in his ear, “Don’t look now Potter, but I think you’re enjoying this.” Harry didn’t answer, “You might even be purring.” Harry swatted at the blurry form next to his face. He missed, but he expected that he would, “Oh settle down, I’m just teasing. It’s a lot more fun now than when we were kids.” Harry nodded. He had to admit that he much preferred Draco Malfoy as a friend than as an enemy.
“See you later for tree decorating.” She called over her shoulder. Harry fumed, losing his appetite. He abandoned the rest of his breakfast and stormed out of the hall.
“Anything exciting happen while I was gone?” He asked in a soft mimic of one of Snape’s drawls. His arms settled around Harry’s shoulders in a quick hug. A knowing smirk played on the corners of Draco’s lips. Harry grinned, he shook his head and shrugged him off. The motion set his stool rocking against the stones. Draco steadied the stool with one hand, before skipping between the tables to return to his abandoned mandrake root.
Harry pushed himself up on the countertop, legs swinging back and forth while Draco instructed him on how to properly serve tea to others. Draco’s s instructions stopped when the bell tinkled overhead. Harry slid off the counter. His mouth fell open at the sight of Severus Snape standing in the doorway. Swallowing, Harry resisted the urge to slip behind Draco. But he’d already been seen.
“You’re late Potter,” Draco called. He held up a string of popcorn and cranberries, “Come help before Lovegood eats it all.” Harry smiled. He batted away the snitch and sat beside the other boy. Draco focused hard enough on his stringing that his pink tongue poked through his lips. Harry laughed. He handed Draco pieces of popcorn out of the bowl, sneaking a few cranberries here and there. Draco swatted his hand away from the bowl, “Just as bad as she is.”
“Well, I think I know where Harry disappeared off to,” She offered, equally baffled as Ron.
Bending down, he peered under the bed. His eyes settled on his new boots, gleaming in the morning light that flooded in through the windows. Harry stuffed his feet into the boots, straightened the tongues, and tightened the laces into a set of sloppy knots. He kicked his feet up to examine his work, shoulders curling. It lacked most of Draco's finesse, but he didn't think the squid could yank them off in their current state either.
“This looks cozy,” He drawled. Draco rolled over, scrambled to his feet, and tucked himself under one of Snape’s arms, “It’s only been a few hours, Dragon.” The man muttered, but he returned the embrace to his nephew despite his complaints. He gave Harry a cool, warning gaze over the top of Draco’s head.
Bits of hair fell away from the sides of his hair, quickly. Harry had a feeling he was in for much more than a trim. He wondered if he’d have any hair left at all. It would grow back in a few hours if he hated it, but he didn’t want to hate it. Harry didn’t want to hate anything that had to do with Draco anymore. The tea-loving blond was growing on him more and more by the day.
"I'm not kidnapping you. I'm bringing you with me," He said. Draco squeezed Harry's fingers in an apology for pulling him away. Harry squeezed Draco's slender fingers back. He walked faster to keep up with Draco's confident stride through the halls. They passed no one on the sleepy Sunday morning. More than half of Gryffindor wouldn't be awake yet, and Harry was sure the same could be said for the other houses.
“Correction, Scarface. It just grows back if you don’t like the cut, and that was accidental magic. You’re not a little boy anymore, you’re one of the most powerful wizards in Britain. Let’s make you look like it.” Harry gulped but nodded his head. He didn’t have much of a choice. Draco would get his way, one way or another. Stiffening, he felt his glasses slide off his nose. Everything blurred. Harry shivered, he shook his head and reached out for his glasses.
"So, he'll be a Slytherin until he defeats You Know Who or until You Know Who defeats him," He muttered eyes sliding toward the enchanted window scene of trees that covered the wall. His trace was broken by the solid, warm arm that wrapped around his shoulders. Sighing, he leaned into Snape's embrace.
“I told you we had it covered, Harry. No one messes with Slytherin in our own territory.”
“I think it is likely he would have regardless of the Writ. Your father was a bully, not a monster.” Harry nodded at the matter of fact answer. He hoped that was the case, “Bring me the diced mandrake root Draco had been working on.” The professor’s request roused Harry from his thoughts, sending him scampering back across the room for the neat pile of roots.
“I’m glad I shook hands with you this time around.”
Whispers filled the Great Hall over the sight of Harry Potter wearing a flower crown and eating his lunch, all while settled into the embrace of Draco Malfoy. And while what brought them together made perfect sense to Harry and Draco. To the other inhabitants at Hogwarts, they were sure it was as clear as squid ink.
The question: what to do with this version? If you’d like me to write some sort of fix-it ending and leave it up, I definitely could, but the more likely conclusion is that I’ll put a notice in the summary that it’s going to remain unfinished and there’s a rewrite available.
Draco hadn’t meant to come out, but he felt like he needed some hard evidence that he wasn’t interested in Hermione romantically to combat Weasley’s persistent jealousy.
“Professor?” Draco called after Hagrid, jogging a bit to keep up with him. Hagrid’s chest puffed out a bit with pride, just as it had every time he’d heard Draco using his proper title recently.
Draco held himself high as he spoke, a change from his previous lazy posture when he disregarded the professors’ authority. He wanted both people in the room to notice his difference in demeanor.
Weasley tried to speak, but Draco cut him off. “There’s nothing between me and Hermione. Even if there was something one sided, she’s clearly in love with you.” His face changed from disgust to shock, his obliviousness showing clearly. “And not that it matters, but I’m gay. So there wouldn’t really be any chance of anything happening there.”
“Well, I did want to piss my dad off.” Draco stated matter-of-factly, causing Weasley to choke on his tea while Draco took a delicate, composed sip. He decided to continue as to not look like an asshole.
They looked at each other and burst out in laughter. “How did they even get that drunk?” Harry gasped, looking for air after all that laughing. “I don’t know, but we should probably check to make sure they actually got out of the doorway before the Fat Lady closed it.” Draco said, also gasping with laughter.
“I guess I just wanted to try something new.” Draco said, playing with a piece of his hair. He could finally enjoy its softness from years of being oiled back into a style his father thought was presentable.
They both made noises of surprise, and Draco surprised Hermione by picking up her books and offering a hand to her, leaving his own things on the floor. “Thank you.” She said cautiously. Though Draco was sure she knew why he was acting how he was, she was still treading lightly around him so as not to make a fool of herself, and the fact that she felt she needed to do that brought him so much shame.
I’d love to rewrite this. I had the plot roughly outlined, and I think it could be something cool with my improved writing skills.
Draco tried not to feel suffocated when a muggle man in an apron put some sort of fabric around him that fastened at the back of his neck. The man’s hair was shaved, with a mess of hair on the top, and Draco decided he wanted to do something similar.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Very well then. Have a seat, and see me after class.” Draco wracked his brain for some sort of cocky reply to that, and then he thought he’d might as well save anything good he came up with for when he’d have it out with Snape after class, a meeting of which no doubt the whole class would wait outside to listen to. “Oh I will.”
They all laughed, and Draco observed the way Harry’s eyes shone with his laughter. Weasley begrudgingly started allowing himself to have fun, possibly because of Hermione’s warning glance.
“Excuse me, gentlemen.” They both slowly looked up in utter terror to see the furious face of Minerva McGonagall glowering down at them. “If you’d care to join me in the headmaster’s office.” She forced, causing them to rise with one look.
“Right. Annabelle. I like Anna better. I think I’ll call you Anna. So you pricks better sod off, and stay away from my new friend here.” Crabbe and Goyle seemed to be trying to figure out a way out of this, but ended up just giving Draco disgusted looks and walking away.
What he was referring to was a pile of animal droppings dangerously close to feed for some of the animals. He’d figured that’s what Hagrid had been getting ready to do when he ended class a bit early.
Seeing red, Draco said the only thing he could think of, witty comebacks in a cool voice forgotten. “Harry’s more a man than you’ll ever be. Fuck. You.” He swept everything he could see off Snape’s desk in one clean motion, and grabbed his books and stormed out.
Please check this out if you were looking forward to more of this fic!
A bit of a shorter chapter, I know, but I hit another spot on the prompt I’m using! Since there was another chapter yesterday, I figured shorter was okay for today, especially if I get another chapter out tomorrow. Anyways, I hope you enjoyed this one! Things are getting a little more emotional than I wanted, but maybe I’ll play on that. Anyways, I’ll add a few character and other tags for what was introduced in this chapter. Please please please leave comments! I love to hear from you!
“I guess I’ve realized that I don’t want to spend my whole life practically worshipping someone who doesn’t deserve it.” Though he doubted Weasley knew who he was actually talking about, he saw the sad smile on Hermione’s face, and how Harry’s eyebrows furrowed.
Blaise whistled. “That is a lot to unpack. He definitely seems into you, though. You’ll be fucking him by Christmas hols.” Draco chose to ignore that last bit and smiled to himself.
Draco looked at the clock. “Wow, shit, it’s late. I’ll be going back to my dorm now.” Harry looked slightly disappointed, though he hid it well. “Okay, right. This-“ He said whilst gesturing to the half asleep teenage boys “was fun.” Draco smiled at him. “Agreed.” He held out a hand. “Acquaintances?” Harry took his hand. “Friends.”
“Do you think we could sit down sometime and talk about it? The book, I mean. Maybe you could explain some of it to me?” Draco asked, a bit nervous, thinking it was too early to begin trying to build bonds with some of the people who liked him the least.
“Have fun with-“ Blaise moaned Harry’s name. “Potter?” Draco tried to look pissed with him, but ended up just grinning. “Shut up, Zabini.” Blaise threw a sock at him. “Well, get on with it then! Tell me what happened.” Draco sat down and relayed the details of the story to his friend while he changed into pyjamas.
He was going to die one way or another, so he might as well go out with a bang.
“I’ve just started it, actually. I thought a few muggle classics were good to start with to, uh, get a good foundation for reading, but it’s actually quite hard to get through.” Hermione laughed at that last bit, though Draco couldn’t miss the knowing gleam in her eye at the blatant lie about why he’d wanted to read muggle books, they both knew it was to anger his parents, but he’d actually really liked some of them.
As soon as they were gone, Anna tried to shoot Draco a skeptical look, but it crumpled on her face as she finally cried. Draco felt terrible, terrible that he used to help cause this, terrible that he’d never realized how he could be making other people feel.
Draco was terrified. Was this man working for his father? He would be slaughtered if his father knew he was in a muggle establishment
He strolled into the great hall, perfectly at ease. The giant room went almost silent when he walked in sight. He had decided to be fashionably late to lunch, hoping he’d be one of the last to walk in so he could make a grand entrance.
After walking over to Weasley as calmly as he could and trying to catch his gaze, he started. “I think you’ve acted like a right arse this entire time I’ve been trying to change. But I think that speaks for your loyalty. I know you want to protect your friends, but this isn’t the way to do it. I’m not saying you have to trust me, or even give me a chance, but you have to listen to your friends.”
He was told to sit in some sort of odd chair, made of metal? And leather? It was an overall confusing experience, but he tried to act as though it was nothing out of the ordinary for him, as not to draw attention to himself.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Goyle! Crabbe! Who’s your friend?” He said with fake cheer to confuse them. “This little abomination is just someone we’re setting straight. And you ought to be set straight too, Draco. No one decent knows what’s up with you lately but you’d better figure it out. Before we do.” Goyle said, a sneer on Crabbe’s face in the background.
Potter, or Harry, though he’d made up his mind not to call him that to his face again anytime soon, was grinning ear to ear. That surprised Draco, but he was ecstatic that there seemed to be at least some trust, or just general enjoyment between the two of them.
“If you had the decency to care, you’d have figured out the reason behind Draco’s new hair already. And since you’re avoiding me, you don’t get a damn say in who I hang around. Besides, I invited Draco here to talk about a book we’re both reading, not that it’s any of your business either way. I also don’t need an ‘excuse’ to chat with a friend. Now leave me alone, since you’ve proved you’re right good at it!”
Josh whistled. “Hopefully I can take some of it off for you and they won’t be as upset when they find out.” He laughed easily, and Draco blushed a bit. He only had eyes for Potter, stupid attractive git, but that didn’t mean he couldn’t admire the good looks of twenty-something year old men.
“Man, that rager in the Ravenclaw common room was great!” Dean said loudly, a badly staged conversation in an attempt to get Harry to come to the party. “Guys, I’m not feeling up to it.” Harry said with a chuckle. “Harry! Come with us! We’re taking you away from this twit!” Dean said in a loud whisper that Draco could hear quite clearly. Draco only raised a single eyebrow in reaction.
Draco gladly shook his hand, fingertips lingering a bit longer then they should’ve, and made the walk back to his dorm. Giddy with happiness and holding three books Granger had given him, he didn’t even notice Blaise smirking from his own bed.
Hermione stopped, backing away from him. She was sobbing now, and Harry ran over to comfort her. Draco stood there, helpless, feeling more guilty than he ever had before. He decided he needed to intervene, to set things straight.
“Thank you, Professor.”
“You think?” He said. Blaise nodded vigorously. “Definitely. Make sure to use protection, an-“ Draco cut him off with a teasing shove. “Oh, sod off. You know what I mean.” Blaise smiled. “Then yes. I definitely think he likes you. Anyone with half a brain can see it.”
But Potter, he was the shining gem of all the shocked faces. His eyebrows seemed to be permanently raised, with his mouth opened in a tiny O. He was flushed, face red at the sight of Draco. Draco decided that was a good thing. He sent a tiny wave in their direction, and turned back to his table with a flourish.
Shit, his flushed face was so hot. Draco watched as he bit one lip, nervously waiting for an answer. That was hot too.
“Mr. Malfoy, I dearly hope you understand how much I care for my students, and that you may always come talk to any professor if something is troubling you. As your headmaster might say, help is always given at Hogwarts to those who ask.”
He’d realized how much he’d really begun to change when Greg and Vince had been sneering over a Hufflepuff fourth year who he knew was muggleborn based on their comments. They were using every horrid, nasty slur in the book.
In the past few months, he hadn’t had a particular liking to attention, far from his cries to be the center of everything in first year. He’d taken to sitting with Pansy and Blaise at mealtime anyways recently, so he nonchalantly walked up to the Slytherin table and sandwiched himself between them.
“I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have said that out in the hallway like this. But I’m very observant. The looks you give him make it clear.” Draco was shocked she’d figured it out, but he realized he may have been underestimating how she was intelligent in all different ways.
As they walked out, Harry moved off from Hermione and The Weasel™ to walk with Draco. Weasley seemed to have a problem with this, which worried Draco, since he was beginning to worry that he’d hurt the trio’s friendship.
(See the end of the chapter for
They walked in silence, Harry running his hands through his hair in time with his sighs. When they were outside the Slytherin common room, Draco expected a curt goodbye and for Harry to run away, partially due to it being dangerously close to curfew and partially because of the awkwardness.
“Hopefully it’ll make them more mad. That’s kinda what I’m going for.” Josh laughed again. “So, what are you looking for here? Standard cut is twenty, but I have a feeling you’ll need a little more time, so it’ll probably be around thirty.”
“Like she said, I was just here to talk about a book. I’m serious when I say there was no malicious intent. I helped Granger pick up some books in the hallway, and noticed we were reading one of the same ones. She invited me here to talk about it.”
“It’s when you look at me like that, Draco. And when you call me by my first name. And when you laugh at something I say, and how you use all of your patience with Ron when he doesn’t deserve it. It’s you, Draco. It’s always been you.”
I know a lot of people were following this story, and I really hope you stick around to see the new version, even though it’s been such a long time.
Draco snorted audibly. “What kind of empty threat is that? You know as well as anyone that you can’t touch a blue, shaved hair on my head. And that extends to...” he looked to the fourth year for her name. “Annabelle.” She spoke, voice filled with pride, but Draco could sense a waver if uncertainty in the background.
With it being a Friday, Hagrid turned a blind eye to how late it was getting, since he knew they’d manage to get back in before curfew. When it seemed all of their eyelids were drooping too much for their lies of not being tired to be believable, Hagrid sent them off with the invitation to come back extended to Draco.
“Come on, Draco. I’ll walk you back to your dormitory. I’ll leave you two alone to talk.” Harry said, seemingly pulling himself out of his shock to rescue Draco from the awkward silence caused by his confession.
Draco had never been inside Hagrid’s hut before, and it was definitely odd, but he was more distracted by politely choking down the disgusting “tea” Hagrid had so proudly given him and staring at Harry’s face.
“WOT THE FOCK MATE ITS BLOODY TEN PM AND WEVE GOT A MATCH TOMORROW WOT THE FOCK ARE YOU DOING IN THE HALL-“ Blaise, an early riser who liked his beauty sleep, moved back and took in the scene. Draco, on the floor as if he had jumped back, and Potter, up against the wall, both flushed and with shocked looks on their faces.
She nodded. “That’s Sam.” He walked closer to her, and started to give her a hug. Draco’s heart seemed to spill over at the obvious affection between the two. “I’m just helping out, kid. Hey, let me know if you need anything else, okay? Are you good from here?” She nodded again, and ignored the confused stare her friend was giving her.
There were too many times that he winced after insulting Hufflepuffs who did nothing to him, or that he cringed at watching Greg and Vince cause a first year to cry from being held in a headlock.
“Stay.” Harry said, still flushed, but the intense look in his eye made Draco want to do anything he’d ever ask of him again. He shivered a bit, oblivious to Hermione’s knowing look or Ron’s confused stares. “Okay.” He said in a soft voice, staring at Harry, and he was startled when Hagrid suddenly clapped his hands together and motioned for Draco to follow him.
Hagrid seemed even more pleased at the fact that Draco was willing to put in labor to help him out. He chuckled a bit as Draco cringed at the smell of the dung. He felt really appreciated by how Draco had offered to help him with an undesirable chore.
Granger looked eerily like McGonagall, their noses upturned in the exact same way, and her eyes held the same twinkle of joy that told him she was happy for his rebellion. He cracked a half smile in her direction, which turned into a full laugh when he watched her gently close Weasley’s mouth.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry sat up and moved to face Draco, who looked at him directly in his eyes, full of wondering. “Can I kiss you?” He asked softly, all nerves and anticipation. Draco’s breath hitched. He nodded. Their faces moved closer, eyes closed, and just as their lips were about to meet-
“What has gotten into you? Your hair is atrocious, you’re playing buddy-buddy with Hufflepuffs, you’re not yourself. Does this warrant an owl to your father?” Snape’s nostrils flared, showing his black nose hair. Draco shuddered. Gross.
“They’ve been fighting more than usual? It must suck for you, being right in the middle of it.” Draco said, sliding down to sit next to him. “No, it’s not that. They’ve always been pains in the arse.” Draco looked at him inquisitively. Harry groaned and held his head in his hands.
“Harry, walk back with us.” He said, eyes darting from Draco to Hermione, both of whom were starting to get visibly angry. “I’m gonna walk Draco back to his dormitories.” Harry said carefully. “I’m sure Malfoy can handle himself.” Weasley said coolly. Hermione finally reacted verbally at that comment.
—————————————————————
She was certainly terrifying, and angry no doubt, but Draco recognized that same twinkle in her eye from the day he first dyed his hair blue. Her disappointment teacher face almost gave way to a hint of a smile that let him relax and shoot a reassuring glance at Harry. Draco knew that they would get a fair punishment for making noise and being out after curfew, but something about the professor told him she was rooting for him and Harry to work out. He smiled to himself as they walked, getting a confused smile from Harry.
A few days later, Draco hung back after care of magical creatures. He was trying to find opportunities to apologize to everyone he felt he needed to, and now was as good as ever to give Hagrid his apology.
“That’s bollocks and we all know it.” Weasley snorted, sipping tea in a gesture of victory. Draco raised one eyebrow. Harry looked uncomfortable. He’d normally be fuming at someone who had the nerve to talk to him like this, but he didn’t value Weasley’s opinion at all, and he knew he was just trying to protect his friends.
He was so done.
Harry stopped, put his head up against the wall, and sighed. Draco was immediately worried, since Harry had never been one to expose his worries to people. At least, not that Draco had ever seen.
Weasley was the first to speak. “Honestly Hermione, we have one row and you resort to hanging out with this blue headed prat? What, what’s your excuse? You were just doing potions homework? This twit should get the hell out of our common room and back to the dungeons.”
When class was over, Snape called Draco up to the front of the room and the rest of the class quickly filed out, surely about to hide just out of eyesight in the hallway to listen.
“Yes, thirty would be fine. Excellent. Thirty gal- pends. Thirty pends is what I will be spending.” Josh eyed him suspiciously. “Thirty pounds. No cents.” Shit. He was wrong. “Yes, of course, is that not what I said?” He was sweating. Oh no.
Draco couldn’t help but smile to himself at the memory of Harry softly whispering to him. His first name had never sounded so sweet. He wanted to hear it over and over again. He fell asleep with a smile on his face.
All the mixed emotions that caused his war with himself had finally leveled out. He knew how he felt now. There were too many times that he looked at Potter’s emerald eyes and thought about how they would be complimented by a Slytherin green romper.
“Don’t be scared, kid. No one can hear us. Im a squib. I live the muggle life. My wife is a muggle. She’s expecting our first, due pretty soon, actually.”
Harry looked disappointed, but he only responded “Yes, Professor.” Draco tried not to watch his arse as he left the classroom. Instead, he looked up and saw a concerned expression on his teacher’s face.
He looked up to see Weasley and Potter, the former being the one who made the noise. A look of utter confused distaste sat on his face, and Granger turned up her nose at him. Draco’s observant eye told him that they may have had some sort of brawl, and that’s why she was walking alone in the hallway.
Draco was still trying to comprehend all the information he had just taken in. “So, you’re not going to turn me in for sneaking out of school to make my parents mad?” Josh laughed. “Of course not. And this is on the house. Not that you’d really have any methods of payment.”
Normally, Draco wouldn’t have wanted someone else choosing what would happen to his hair, but in the spirit of rebellion, he nodded. Josh pulled out some sort of metallic object that Draco was desperately trying to hide his fascination with, and put it to the back of Draco’s head.
“Noooo! Dean look! He can raise one broweye! Eyebrow! We should leave them alone. You guys” Seamus said, gesturing largely to Harry and Draco “should fuck” He said in a drunken whisper to them. Dean howled with laughter and dragged Seamus out again.
So, hey!
“That’s the first time you’ve used my first name.” Harry whispered. Draco’s stomach was doing cartwheels. “Yeah, I guess so.” He said, voice soft and full of affection. They were still staring at each other when Dean and Seamus walked in, obviously drunk.
Draco nodded and patted her back sympathetically, and started to guide her back near the kitchens.
Draco finished up, trying to hide the disgust on his face. “I hope I was able to help you out some.” Draco said, suddenly feeling shy. Hagrid grinned. “Very much so. Thank you, Malfoy.” That caused Draco to start beaming and give Hagrid a small nod. “Let me know if you need help with anything else.”
The two boys looked shocked, Weasley right in front of Draco, and Harry, who was still comforting a sniffling Hermione. She, however, didn’t look very surprised at all. Draco wanted to chalk it up to her being too upset to pay attention, but he knew she was more observant then she let on.
Draco was pulled from talking animatedly with Granger by a sound of disgust coming from in front of him. He’d almost forgotten he was in the Gryffindor common room, he was so engrossed in the conversation. Granger was a very interesting conversationalist when it came to books.
“So Malfoy, I’m sure we’re all dying to know, what caused this new attitude of yours?” Weasley asked, a sneer on his face. Draco tried not to be offended, because he knew he probably deserved it, and he was sure the weasel felt amazingly proud of himself for managing to be on the other end of the taunting.
He finally brought himself to turn his head to the Gryffindor table, where some quiet chatter had resumed, undoubtedly about his hair. Weasley’s mouth was open, eyes wide with a hint of disgust as well as silent respect, both competing for their fair share.
“Hey, hey, it’s okay. You’re in Hufflepuff, right? Why don’t I take you back to your common room? I’ll let your next teacher know you’re not feeling well. Who do you have next?” She nodded and sniffled “Professor McGonagall.”
“Close your mouths, cronies. The flys’ll get in.”
Stomping down the corridors brought some sense into Draco, but his normal composed demeanor was still compromised enough for him to bump right into Hermione Granger, causing them both to topple over.
“Hey, how are you? I’m Josh, I’ll be cutting your hair today. We get mainly regulars around here, so it’s nice to see someone new. And what you’ve got going on here is super cool. It’s so vibrant, but you don’t seem to have any dye marks on your scalp. Did you do this yourself?”
He shook his head to clear his thoughts so he could put on a cocky grin as he strode into potions. He’d recently been on time and diligent during all his other classes, not too different from what other people knew of him, but he’d been considerably more invested in the actual learning. His potions grade, however, had taken a large dip.
Draco smirked at his appearance one more time. Vince and Greg’s jaws had dropped so far to the floor when they’d seen him, Draco decided to make a snarky comment that would hopefully be one of his last to the sadistic duo.
Josh chuckled and shook his head. “Were you planning on spending galleons? Or sickles?” Draco was speechless. Was this not a muggle barber shop? He tried to laugh it off nervously. “I don’t, uh” Josh smiled again. “Skipping class at Hogwarts, are you? It’s not every day I see a young wizard at work.”
I’m so sorry I’ve been gone for so long, but I’m back now and better than ever. This is just a short transitional chapter that will pave the way to the rest of this fic. It quickly got a lot more emotional than I intended, but I think that’s a happy accident. Anyways, as always, leave suggestions in the comments below and I’m always open to looking for beta writers!
Harry, Hermione, and the male weasel were all happily sipping Hagrid’s concoction, and Draco wasn’t sure how they managed to get it down. He could see Hermione smugly turn up her nose at his slight reactions and the smile in Harry’s eyes every time his eyebrows furrowed at the taste.
“Guess I’ve just realized who I really want to associate with.” Draco said with a shrug. “Don’t play dumb with me, boy. All those longing looks at Potter? You’re stupid if you think there’s any way that’s going to go anywhere.”
Harry suddenly looked very miffed. “If you’re trying to go after Hermione, if that’s what this new attitude is all about, I’ll tell you it isn’t going to work. No matter how much they bicker, she and Ron only have eyes for each other.” Draco was annoyed. What was it with everyone thinking he liked Granger? Maybe the part that bothered him was everyone assuming he was straight.
“Boys, I’m sure you understand the importance of keeping quiet at night while others are sleeping, especially after curfew, when you should be in bed yourselves.” McGonagall looked over her glasses at them, and Draco felt bad that Harry was upset. “It’s my fault, Professor. I asked Potter to come meet me outside the dormitory and we lost track of time.”
Harry and Draco looked at each other again, blinked once in unison, and then laughed until their stomachs hurt. “I feel like with anyone else that should’ve been some sort of hot ‘where did we leave off’ moment but only we would sit here, on the floor, past curfew, laughing our arses off.” Draco managed to say through laughing.
She slammed her book closed and stomped off to the girls’ dormitories. Weasley yelled after her “If you hadn’t been with this arse when I got back, maybe I would’ve apologized!” though Draco was sure he knew she was out of earshot. Mirroring her, he stomped off to his own dorm. Potter looked bored.
Draco froze. Muggle money. He’d forgotten all about it! He’d heard some of the Slytherin muggleborns- rare, but they did exist, talking about how expensive their Christmas gifts would be. He believed that their currency was called pends? He continued to try to act normal.
“It’s okay.” He managed to stutter out. “You haven’t told anyone, have you?” He said, panicked look on his face. “No, of course not, and I promise I won’t.” She said seriously. “But I’m willing to give this talking about books thing a shot. How about we go to the Gryffindor common room?” Draco smiled with relief. “That sounds perfect.” He said.
McGonagall’s eyebrows raised, but she said nothing on the subject. “Very well. Ten points from Slytherin and five points from Gryffindor. I trust that you can see yourself back to your dorm, Mr. Potter, and quickly. If I catch you waiting for Mr. Malfoy, it’ll be another five points.”
Draco’d been outside wizard London a few times with his father, but never by himself. He took the floo closest to where he needed to go, had a perplexed experience with a map, and eventually ended up looking at the sign of a muggle barber shop.
“But I don’t need anyone’s pity.” Draco said with a shrug, trying to play it off. Weasley eyed him skeptically, and Draco was hoping that meant he’d been given a second chance. Not wanting to turn the short silence into an awkward one, he turned to Hagrid and said “Professor, this tea is really good. You must tell me where you get it.”
“I’m not interested in her like that. I’m just looking to be her friend. And yours too. And possibly Weasley’s, by association. I really am sorry, Harry. I’ve realized my mistakes. I’m trying to change.” His voice softened as he said that. He looked straight into Harry’s eyes, and Harry stared straight into his.
Draco tried to hide the sheepish look on his face. “Now, let’s get to your hair. I have an idea that’ll look good with your face shape and might piss your parents off, if you’ll trust me.”
That was why Draco sat in the toilets of the Slytherin dorms, carefully reading his transfiguration notes. He just had to do this right, or he might end up with something crazier than he was going for.
Hagrid beamed, and Harry and Hermione shared am impressed look at Draco’s calling him Professor, while Weasley scowled. “That’s a secret recipe, there. Been in the family for generations. These three have been drinking it for years and they still haven’t figured out what’s in it!”
And for what felt like the millionth time recently, Draco looked up to see the golden trio standing there, staring at him with varied expressions on their faces. Hermione was trying not to look smug, and she was probably fooling most people, but Draco had learned to look for that twinkle in her eye.
This version is going to conclude here. I’ll be rewriting the first five chapters with all the same elements and some of the same dialogue, and continuing past the abrupt ending to close up the story.
“War and Peace? Tolstoy?” Draco said, motioning to a fat book Hermione had been carrying. “Yes, you’re actually right. I wouldn’t take you for a reader of muggle books.” She responded carefully, but slightly looser, possibly due to surprise, but Draco saw it as a small victory.
“I knew it! I knew the two of you had something going on! Hermione, he just wants one thing! You know he’s only in it for the sex! This is all bullshit, he’s putting up a front because everyone else has finally noticed how beautiful you are, but they don’t take the time to care about your personality! He doesn’t deserve you!”
I haven’t written on this fic in a really long time, and revisiting it made me cringe really hard. There are just blatant writing sins all over the place.
Let me know if you’d like to weigh in on what happens!
Harry looked at him, beaming, and then wiggled his eyebrows. “Where did we leave off?” He said suggestively, causing Draco to start up again. They were just beginning to wipe tears from their eyes when they heard it.
With her being a fourth year and him being a sixth, it was possible some of her giggling friends thought he had a crush on her, and he hoped she didn’t develop feelings for him. She was a cool friend to have, but he’d never really been interested in girls.
“Draco”, she began. Her eyes locked into his and she blinked. “I won’t be asking much of you.”
The young lady stared at Draco. “Nothing much.” She hesitated, opened, and closed her mouth a few times, shrugging her shoulders and smiling awkwardly.
It had been rather obvious to Draco that his father was over his head with whatever the Dark Lord had asked of him. He had seen the panicked and nervous look in his eyes, the poorly concealed terror and worry for Draco himself. So what would happen if he failed his task? Draco would war the brunt of his failure.
Daphne looked up at him. “Oh, I didn’t see you there, Draco! I thought you were still occupied with reading.” She slammed her book shut and turned around. Her smile looked fake.
Draco did not know. But he suspected that he was on a very wrong and dangerous path. And that scared him.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Yes, well. The incoming storm would put a damper on any extracurricular activities outside, don’t you think?” He pointed his finger into the sky. And really, the dark rain clouds had been above the castle for some time now, draining every light out of the castle and turning it into a sad, wet, and muddy area. He understood why they were the only ones outside. His shoes were already ruined.
And Daphne did. They screamed as loud as they dared, ignoring the heavy rain that started falling onto them, just hopping in the rain, and destroying his whole attire. But there was nothing he could do now, was there? They were already ruined.
And suddenly he understood why Astoria took the risk and joined the DA. It wasn’t out of spite. She was trying to protect herself and her sister, making sure to learn as many defensive spells as possible. He had to admire her braveness. And maybe, just maybe, Astoria and Daphne both could join the Order of The Phoenix. They would be safe with Dumbledore, right?
Draco grit his teeth. “I don’t think it is any of your business what I read or study. Do know your place, darling.”
Daphne’s eyes widened. “You didn’t talk to Potter? What happened?”
Draco’s eyes flashed. “And what about your keeper? I’m not sure he could ever be able to catch the Quaffle if it flew right at him from under five meters. The only thing he catches is my surprise and disgust that he made the team at all.”
Draco scoffed. “And honestly, Potter. I don’t understand how anyone could think that you are some great wizard or something. You are so pathetic and stupid that I can’t get over the fact you were actually accepted at Hogwarts.”
When Draco turned around rather dramatically, his shoe was stuck in the mud. His foot plopped out with a loud plop. Were it not for him holding onto Daphne, he possibly would have fallen straight on his face. She caught him and started laughing loudly while he cursed loudly.
As it turned out, fucking much.
Pansy took his hand when he sat down next to her. “Draco,” she smiled. “I would have loved to see you hex that bastard. That would have been lovely, right?”
Daphne smiled. “Of course. But I must go to Professor Snape’s office now. Could you please stay behind? I don’t want to spend the day alone.”
This was another topic Pansy and he bonded over: clothes. She had been just as obsessed with how to dress as him. It had been the reason he invited her to the Yule Ball. He had wanted to be the best dressed wizard on that event and Pansy had been the obvious choice. Her pink dress had looked beautiful on her and he did not regret inviting her. Until Granger had looked better with Krum than Pansy and him.
His friends had already told them about the event in magical creatures.
Potter stared at Draco. Draco stared back. And then Potter rolled his eyes, huffed and then shrugged. “I’ll give you when the next meeting is. And then we’ll see.”
Wouldn’t that be a feast?
“Malfoy,” he said. “This wont work if you don’t trust me. I trust you not to go to Umbridge, but I need some trust in return. So, tell me, how do you know about the detention?”
Daphne shook her head. “Not yet. But Astoria has heard from her dear friend Cho Chang that there will be a meeting this Saturday. And she is going.”
As a result, they were all tense. It felt like everyone was watching him and wanting him to decide. But what did they expect from him?
Daphne laughed. “Yes, you have a heart of gold. You saved me. But, oh saviour, that will only stop her from the initial meeting. What about afterwards?”
Draco stayed silent and watched Potter walking in front of the wall three times before opening the door and holding it open for Draco. Rather dramatically, if you asked Draco.
He wanted to stick out this tongue, but they were still surrounded by his peers and he did not fancy to more attention than he had right now. He could see Granger and Weasel staring at him, whispering furiously and Draco breathed deeply. Better make a quick escape before Potter did another stunt. That would be even worse.
He watched her move and listened silently to the melodic voice in the weird object. It reminded him of the wizard’s radios. Was this a smaller, more compact version?
He made his way through the almost silent hall. He caught Potter watching him and he gave him two fingers. Potter scowled back.
Daphne grabbed his hand. “Listen here, Malfoy. I don’t care what you do, just make sure she is safe. I don’t care if you have to learn every healing spell there is, I don’t care if you get detention for it. Make sure that she makes it out of this war alive. You know that any time, if she gets hurt, I can tell every pureblood in this area that you are not what you’re supposed to be. So, think about it: Do you want to be disowned, dishonoured, and fall from grace, or do you want to stay where you are. You just have to look out for my sister.”
When he sat down next to Astoria, the golden trio looked even more furious. He ignored them and looked at the younger Slytherin next to him.
Draco put his wand back in his pocket and turned to Astoria. “I hate your sister.”
He found her quickly. She was sitting at a table in the back, her blond hair shining like a beacon. He sat down next to her.
Draco sighed dramatically. “Yeah, if we must. Then tell me, how are we going to fuck with Umbridge?”
But would the war really end then, a quiet voice asked. He shoved it away. He could not ask himself these questions.
Finally, she looked up. Her eyes were full of tears and Daphne took a step towards him and hugged him tightly. Surprised, he hugged her back and listened when she started crying in his shirt, making horrible sounds. And destroying his shirt, as well. He really should start wearing the worst clothes that he possessed when he was near Daphne. It would stop the huge waste of shirts and shoes.
He heard Granger and Weasel gasp loudly behind him, but he kept his face towards Astoria. She had tears in her eyes and shrunk even more into herself. “Maybe. But I was more thinking about Transfiguration. You see, I still don’t get that one spell – “
Idiot.
Daphne smiled sweetly. “Darling”, she mocked. “That’s none of your business, now, is it?”
He hastily left the library and a stunned Potter behind.
Draco rolled his eyes and took a deep breath. “I don’t think that joining some stupid group counts as life threatening. So do keep your dramatics to a minimum if you will.”
She slapped Pansy across her face.
Potter smirked. “Let’s always stay enemies. Sounds great.”
He contemplated her but did not act. The music was good, he had to agree with her on that. It wouldn’t be fair if he didn’t finish the song, so he ignored her and listened furthermore to the music. It was like nothing that he had heard before. Maybe the muggles weren’t completely useless if they could make him like their music.
Astoria stared at him. “Yeah, well, Daphne has always been a bit over-protective of me. But how do you know about what my sister thinks about this situation?”
He would.
Draco shrugged. “Maybe I’ll steal it from you. Or I’ll tell your father. Not sure yet.”
But of course, things couldn’t stay good for long. When the evening rolled around, he got cornered by an angry Potter. He had found Draco on his own in the library, making notes for the upcoming OWLs. He had just started to go through his notes for Transfiguration when Potter sat down in front of him. He held his wand.
“I just want you to protect my sister. Under every circumstance.”
Potter snorted. “Why not? It is her wish to join us. And you don’t seem too inclined to go to Umbridge right now. What did you and her sister agree on?”
“Draco,” warned Daphne. “You will do it; don’t you dare try to get out of it. And what the hell are you doing in my pocket?”
“Potter,” said Draco. “How do I owe this displeasure? I’m sure you realise that I am not one of your unfortunate friends?”
Draco felt sick. “What did he promise?”, he whispered roughly.
Daphne pushed her hands into her coat. “Yes, that’s exactly what you are going to do. Talk to Potter, make him see reason. And then my sister will live. We all win.”
“Yeah, well,” Draco shrugged. “Can’t change it, can we?”
Zabini and Draco had continued their trysts more secretly. Draco did not want to make a deal with any other people in the castle that might find him in a compromising position. Therefore, he always locked the door and made sure no one would walk in, surprisingly. Zabini had just laughed about his security measures.
The third instance brings him to the fourth incident. They hadn’t been back to Hogwarts for more than a week and he and Blaise had gone to the dormitory for some time alone. It had been a pleasant evening, full of moans and breathy compliments when the door had opened to reveal a shocked Daphne Greengrass. The young girl had shrieked loudly and promptly slammed the door shut behind her.
“Fuckidy Fuck”, he cursed. “What’s wrong with this stupid weather. My goddamn shoe fell off!” He looked towards Daphne who was laughing rather loudly. She was doubling over, almost falling into the mud herself.
He started walking the same path that Daphne had walked when he was intersected by an angry looking Pansy. Her eyes were wide, and she grabbed his arm forcefully.
Draco scowled back. “Open the door,” he said.
It was not unheard-of boys exploring each other sexually. But due to having Lucius Malfoy as a father and Narcissa Malfoy as a mother, he did not want to think about the repercussions if they ever were to find out he invited a boy into his bed.
Draco said nothing, but Astoria just kept on talking. She seemed almost giddy right now, her eyes sparkling and her back straight. “You already know where the meetings are held, right? You have told the other Inquisitory Squat members and Umbridge about different possible locations, but I know that you are smart enough to find the entrance. So, tell me, did you know that I might join them anyway and wanted to make sure I am safe anyway?”
Draco snorted. “Potter has started his own defence group?”
Draco snorted. “What do these buttons do?”
Still, Draco didn’t say any of it. “Cut the crap, Daphne. What do you want?”
Potter snorted. “Fuck off, Malfoy. You cant tell me that you like her lessons. Its completely ridiculous that we don’t actually learn defensive spells!” He got louder in the end and threw his arms up, making a spectacle of himself. Draco didn’t understand why he told him this, and took a step back.
Daphne shrugged. “I only use this one.” She showed him a small button that showed a little triangle and two lines next to each other. “It starts and stops the song. That’s it.”
“Come on,” he cried. “Sing with me!”
He stared at her. “Why would you die, Daphne? What’s going on at home?”
When he reached the common room, the other students in Slytherin looked up. He ignored the silence that suddenly fell over the room. Usually, he liked the respect that his housemates represented. Now, it made him feel like on the wrong end of a wand. He felt exposed as if everyone could guess what he had been up to in the darkness of the dormitory with a boy.
When they both had stepped inside, they found a rather big room. There were two chairs in front of the fire, making Draco feel at home at once.
“Because you were the one that suggest we meet and, may I add, still ended up to be fifteen minutes late. Next time I wont be here to be snapped at, Potter.”
When he had come back to Hogwarts, his doubt had only grown. He could see the fear in his friends’ faces, the poorly concealed terror and worry about the years that were to come. Draco still thought that the Dark Lord was worth following, but a small part of him rebelled against that idea. Wasn’t that why he so readily agreed to help Astoria and Daphne?
“Oh, you don’t know?” Blaise smiled even wider. “Well, what a shame. Your new friend doesn’t trust you enough to tell you all her secrets. Pity.” He patted his cheek and started to walk towards the bathroom.
He snorted. “What? You think just because you are a Slytherin I will stop reporting you? What do you think will happen if you join that ridiculous group? I’m telling you, if you go through with it, you will end up dead. At least, that’s what your sister thinks.”
Draco glared at her. “Why do you want to protect her so much, anyway? She is in Hogwarts, its as safe as a place can be.”
Additionally to that, his little talk with Daphne had been seen by various Slyterhins. It made the rest of his friend group anxious as well, not being sure what exactly happened between someone in the circles of the Dark Lord and a girl that had nothing to do with it. Pansy had already asked why he hung out with someone who wasn’t in their group.
“Why is it called a walking man? It is nothing like a man.”
So, maybe, he should not mention his shoes.
“But” Draco hesitated. He glanced around, looking through the almost empty library. Daphne looked up at him, holding her breath. He paused a bit more. “I think if something were to stop her from going to that meeting, it would buy you some time to convince her not to join the suicide squat.”
Draco chook his head. “I think her arm is broken, Professor. I will take her to the hospital wing if that is okay?”
Astoria beamed.
She bit her lip and stared at him a few seconds before she sniffed delicately. If Draco were concerned, he would have seen tears in her eyes and how she shrunk under his gaze. But he was not concerned, of course.
When he looked at Daphne, he could see how muddy and dishelved she looked. Quickly, he pulled out his wand and spelled away the dirt and mud from his clothes, then repeated it on her clothes. That, of course, did not stop the murmurs in the hall. Draco ignored it and looked at his shoes.
Draco choked. “No, of course not. I have no idea what you are talking about.”
Potter opened and closed his mouth like a fish. “Wha-? Malfoy, you promised. I thought you would keep your promises?”
When October rolls around, he has already forgotten about the agreement. The OWLs, being a prefect and being part of the Inquisitory Squad is hard enough, he does not have enough time trying to take care of her. The rest of his time is spent on annoying the Gryffindors and dodging points from other houses, laughing at their faces and having tea weekly with his dear Mrs Umbridge.
Draco smiled. “Of course not. How silly of me.” He put his bag over his shoulder and winked at Potter. “I would tell you to have a good day, but that would be a lie. So fuck you and please die in your sleep. It would make my life so much easier. Thank you.”
Daphne relaxed when he didn’t act furthermore. She put her hand in her pocket again and started to sing along to the lyrics in the little walking man.
The third moment had been when Blaise Zabini had kissed him on his fifteenth birthday. He had been too shocked and surprised to kiss him back. Zabini had, after they were high on Gillyweed and pleasantly drunk, decided to snog him in Draco’s room. And when Draco finally had been able to breathe again, his mouth had had a mind of his own and nearly snogged Blaise senseless.
“Don’t be such a bitch, Malfoy,” breathed Daphne. She pulled him along towards the lake, ignoring the disgusting sounds their shoes made in the mud. “I’ll even buy you new shoes if you need them.”
“I know,” said Astoria. She pulled her hand free. “Because of father. I want to do something for myself, Daphne. We need to learn new spells, not only in theory, but casting them. Learning how to defend ourselves is important. I am going to that meeting and I will join that group. You cannot stop me.”
When Daphne heard about his promise, she was not happy. They were outside again, freezing in the rapidly dropping temperature and staring at each other. This time, he had pulled her aside, making sure no one saw them sneaking into the bitter cold.
Daphne slapped him on his arm. “What the hell, Malfoy! I told you to talk to him, how in Salazar’s name were you too late?”
“Well,” drawled Draco. “I suppose you will lose, as it will be against Slytherin.”
“So,” said Potter. “How do you know when my detention is?”
“Well, the ministry is stupid. And I am sure our peers learn adequately in your lessons. So try to focus on them and on their progress. It wont do you any good to get angry at the ministry. It doesn’t change the situation, does it?”
Draco’s face heated. “Well, you aren’t special. You’re just some regular speccy git that I have the misfortune to know.”
His mother had been even worse. She alternated between complete silence and screaming at Draco for the simplest mistakes. Of course, the woman had always been rather harsh with him, but the moments when he did not know if he would get screamed at again or just ignored made him anxious. He was scared that one day he would get a howler from his mother telling him what a disappointment he was.
When Draco finally spotted Daphne, she was sitting alone in a corner of a room. She studiously ignored Draco’s eyes when he made his way to the Slytherin. Draco had to admit, the girl was a pretty pureblood. Her fair hair and her high cheekbones made her very similar to himself, but, Draco mused, she did not have the charisma and the confidence that he inherited. Not to mention his social standing.
Draco was stunned for a few seconds. When Theo entered the room, he decided to ask him about the new development.
“So, Draco,” he said. “Do you mind telling me what you are doing with Daphne? An item, are you?”
Draco smirked. “Why should I tell you?”
But how did Zabini know, then?
“Then,” she began. “I will tell your father that you like to be fucked by boys. You know just as well as I do that our agreement was that you must watch over Astoria. Ask for something else.”
“Whoops!”, she exclaimed when she held onto Draco. But Draco lost his own footing on the muddy ground and together they tumbled down.
Meet me tonight at midnight at the secret location. HP
“I wanted to know where Astoria was”, said Daphne. Her eyes darted around, and her cheeks flushed slightly at the obvious display. Draco had spoken loud enough to attract attention, and even though Daphne was quite popular, she probably did not want him to speak to her so publicly. Oh, well. “She has been spending time with Nott recently, and I was wondering whether she was in his dorm. I do apologise about interrupting your reading.”
Draco blinked. “Well, then. Don’t act like a child in her lectures. I’m sure you deserve detention.”
“Wait,” interrupted Potter. He was frowning at Draco. “Is Daphne the girl whose arm you broke a few weeks ago?”
She pointed to a sheet of paper that Granger had tried to hide under a book. Astoria ripped it free and pointed to the signature Greengrass at the bottom of the paper. Her eyes held his for a few seconds until she put down the paper again.
Draco stared at her. “And how do you suppose I should do that? Potter and I are not exactly friends. Do you want me to tell him: Oh, you can’t accept Astoria into your group because I tell you not to? Yeah, that’ll go over well.”
Talking with Umbridge went better than Draco expected. He only had to say a few words to her, and she started to make sure that some spy would be at the inn at the same time. It was a very encouraging, earning Umbridge’s favour and fucking up Potter’s plan to make a defence group happen. Furthermore, Daphne played her part very well. She insulted Pansy on Friday the whole day, mocking her style and her parents. Draco was sure that the next day, his best friend would explode. She was already on the bridge of hexing Daphne into splinters, maybe Draco didn’t even have to break Daphne’s arm.
Draco laughed awkwardly. “Sure.”
Draco shook his head. He ignored the surprised sounds from Granger and Weasel and stared Potter down. Too bad that he wasn’t easily stared down. Damn him. “No, I told you already that was an accident, didn’t I?”
“Let’s go back,” said Daphne. “You have a conversation with Potter to finish.”
Daphne didn’t answer and they made their way silently towards the Hospital wing. She leaned on him rather heavily, and when they finally were at the goddamn Hospital wing, he was the only thing that was holding her upright.
She smiled and patted his cheek. “Sure.”
As a result, Draco knew that he couldn’t harass her into not speaking about his endeavour. If it were Theo, he was sure that a look could shut him up. But Daphne? She didn’t even like him.
“Well, except me. I would have to talk to Potter, after all.” Draco shrugged his shoulders. His hands came across something metallic in her coat. He felt around it.
“What should I do?”, whispered Daphne. Her eyes filled with tears and she bit back a cry. “I want to help her so badly. But what could I do that will make her see reason?”
The Slytherins next to him started sniggering. He could see Nott’s smirk and Blaise’s stoic face when he looked around him.
Draco flinched when Potter said the name of the Dark Lord. Then he put his hand on Potter’s shoulder, awkwardly trying to console him.
Draco snapped back his hand. “For fucks sake, I get it. Fine, I will take care of your stupid sister. But only till the war is over. I don’t care afterwards.”
Potter laughed. “Yeah, that’s why you tried to befriend my in first year.”
When Astoria joined her sister at the table, Draco listened attentively.
She laughed. “Us,” she cried. “That bastard said here, have my daughters. They are pureblood and therefore worth more than anything I possess. And of course, Nott accepted. But then, he started talking about not being his property but rather his Lord’s. Do you know what that means, Draco?”
She snorted and followed him towards the dungeons. “Really? Then why are you outside in this weather? You know as well as I do that it destroys shoes! Look at them! They are completely muddy.”
“What on earth happened here?” The Professor looked at them furiously. “I will not tolerate this behaviour. All of you, detention. I’m sure Professor Snape wants to speak with you at once.”
Draco lost count of how long they stood there, hugging each other, and listening to the cries of Daphne. When she slowly started to pull away, he smiled awkwardly at her.
Draco stared at her. “Is it – is it muggle?”
Draco coughed quietly and turned towards Astoria again. “Your sister will be beside herself, you know that, right?”
Draco had, of course, panicked. He jumped off the bed, hastily putting on his clothes. Blaise behind him just lounged on the bed, a dazed look on his face.
But Potter smirked at him rather impishly, if you asked Draco. “Well, what do think about the upcoming Quidditch game?”
Potter took a step closer to him. As a result, both Blaise and Nott took a step closer to him as well. He could see them taking out their wands. Potter didn’t seem to be bothered. “Well, still better than missing the Snitch when it flies right next to your head, right? But I am sure that has never happened to you – oh, wait!”
He pushed her aside and started walking down the corridor towards the potions room. He was already running late.
Goddamn it. Potter had been watching him. He supposed that was no surprise, after all, the boy had an uncanny ability to sniff out mysteries and things that did not concern him.
It was a horrible thought. After four years of following his father into anything, believing the man was god himself, he now could see him breaking right in front of his face. The once proud man had changed the night his old master had come back. And Draco hadn’t undersood at first. Wasn’t it a good thing that the man was back? He promised, after all, freedom and prosperity for the wizarding community. But when Draco sees the broken faces of his family, he thinks he might be the poison and not the Bezoar.
“I assure you, that was a misjudgement. I am very much happy you did not accept in first year. I’d rather be you enemy than anything else.”
Daphne nodded. “It’s very muggle. What are you going to do?”
Draco took her hands out of her hair and nodded. “Fuck.” He pulled her closer again. “I’m sorry.”
Mrs. Umbridge laughed like a toad. “Of course,” she replied. “You are my favourite student. I do hope we can agree to work together this year to ensure healthy and good-spirited atmosphere. I hope I can count on your assistance?”
Draco opened and closed his mouth for a few seconds. Salazar, how did he end up in this situation? And how was he supposed to explain it to Daphne?
Another moment had been the day his father had taken him to Azkaban for business. He had been ten years old and after begging and begging, his father finally relented and took him to the dark prison at the end of the world. Draco had not been able to say a word from Azkaban and had not been able to leave the bed for a week. His parents hadn’t been happy with that development.
When he asked Pansy about it the next day, she told him that she did not converse with her parents. It was only fair; the dark-haired girl had a very bad relationship with her mother and Draco knew that they hadn’t spoken for month. He suspected that her father had tried to send his daughter letters, but she would never tell him as much. It was better that way. The things he only suspected could not be used against each other. That’s why it did not bother him when she smiled at him thinly, probably lying through her teeth.
She shut up.
Potter breathed frustrated. “That’s what I want to know from you, asshole.” He murmured the last word, but Draco heard him clearly. Right back atcha.
Potter took a deep breath. His face was still discomforted into anger, but Draco ignored that. “Fine,” hissed the green-eyes git. “I am so sorry I’m late. Ron wanted to play chess so I had to stay a bit.”
Draco smiled thinly. “Interesting theory. But I must say, sadly not correct at all. Why would I want to break someone else’s arm? Nevertheless, a Slytherin’s?”
And he was alone.
“So,” said Potter. He had walked up to him, completely unconcerned and grinned rather annoyingly towards Draco. They were outside and waited for Hagrid to start the class. Draco stood next to Zabini and Nott, who both stared at Potter like he was one of Hagrid’s ugly beast. Not that that wasn’t true.
Could he do that?
Draco frowned. In the inner circle? That couldn’t be true. He would know if her parents were in talk with the Death Eaters. Unless –
Still, he did not wander into the library alone. He always made sure to be surrounded by his friends or Professors to avoid talking to Potter and his minions. Even though it pissed him off, he endured the snide comments and obvious insults between the group. If it could get Potter off his back, good for him.
Draco shot her a vicious look. He knew that the topic was not yet finished.
The girl recked her chin. “Well, then she can fume for all I care. I will join this DA. I have even put my name down already, see?”
Harry’s eyes flashed behind his glasses. Lips flickering into a crooked smile, Harry let himself be dragged the rest of the way to the entrance to the Slytherin dorm without additional fuss. He leaned heavily against the figure behind him, taking in the mixing scents of heavily gelled hair and cologne. The arms nudged him upright again.
Harry frowned, giving a wistful look at the setting sun, “Fine. A few more minutes. But don’t blame me if you end up in the hospital wing.” He rubbed his hands over Harry’s at the sight of the Gryffindor’s red fingers, “What are we going to say to McGonagall?” The Gryffindor’s rosy cheeks paled a fraction. He gulped, his hand stroking his throat in an absent tic, “Relax, when have you actually ever gotten in trouble with McGonagall?” Draco offered.
"Uncle Sev, there has to be something you'll let Harry do. These aren't even complicated brews." Draco declared. He reached across the table to snatch up a knife and mandrake root to begin dicing it into neat, even pieces. He ignored his godfather's exasperation, burying his head into his work. Until the man massaged his temples, flicked his wand, and silently summoned a stack of filthy cauldrons from the opposite worktable. He appraised Harry with a single raised eyebrow. Waiting for him to complain or storm off, but Harry shrugged, lifted the brush, and began to scrub at the first of the cauldrons.
Harry's arms hooked around Draco's shoulders, clasping his hands together at the hollow of the blond's neck. His legs pressed against the Slytherin's hips, propped up by Draco's muscular arms. Chin resting on Draco's shoulder, Harry felt himself bob with each step he took. His fingers gripped the laces to his remaining trainer. It swayed and bumped into Draco's chest.
“I’m teasing Potter. I’ve never been a good sport.” Draco offered, squeezing Harry’s shoulders. He settled the Gryffindor back to his side, so he’d lay back and rest. Harry hummed in agreement.
“I is bringing lunching for Mr. Harry Potter,” She squeaked. Harry stood up and padded over to the elf. He took the tray, mumbling thanks to the elf. Draco scrambled up off of Blaise’s lap before the elf could disappear and bent down in front of her.
Harry gnawed on his bottom lip. He really hadn’t considered his classes. He hadn’t considered much of anything when he agreed to Malfoy’s bet. People never accused him of thinking before he rushed into anything. It wouldn’t be difficult to convince his professors that he had a sore throat for a day or two, but any longer than that and it would raise suspicions. If he made it that long to be an issue. Being quiet wasn’t as difficult as he thought, but Draco Malfoy’s banter made it hard to resist.
Draco stirred in his bed, blinking away sleep from his eyes in the morning light that shone in through the fake window. He glanced over to Potter’s trundle and froze. The Gryffindor’s sleep rumpled blankets were thrown back across the empty bed. Draco shot out of bed, stuffed his feet into his slippers and yanked on his dressing gown. Grumbling to himself, he dashed out of the dorm room and down the hall to the common room. His gaze settled on Harry. The other boy was standing in front of the wall where the opening to the common room was. He beat the spot with his fists, muscles taut and frantic.
“Lords greet people properly, Potter. Otherwise, you’re going to offend someone. Do it right.” The back of his head stung, but he turned back to the potion’s professor, standing up straight.
“I don’t think this is a good idea.” He caught the blond’s eyes in the reflection of the ornate mirror. Draco tousled the dark locks that flopped around Harry’s glasses, “Haircuts and I don’t turn out well. It just grows back in a few hours.”
"You are?" Harry asked. Draco nodded, making his Gryffindor frown, "Why?" Draco brushed a soft kiss on Harry's upturned forehead and tapped the tip of the Gryffindor's nose.
They won.
“And how many times have you visited this week?” Harry’s brows furrowed. He thought through his week, but couldn’t remember coming to the Slytherin common room at all. Even the lunch he ate with the Slytherins his nose was stuck in one of his textbooks. A wave of guilt swept over him. He supposed he had been neglecting Draco this week.
"I think that was my fault, Madam Pomfrey," Harry piped up, "Draco came to drop off a gift and I wouldn't let him leave." The woman's gaze shifted to Harry, softening.
“We’ll be fine. Won’t we, Potter?” Harry nodded. He slid back to the floor near the enchanted window, watching a hushed exchange between Draco and Snape. Their gazes flicked over to him. He stared out the enchanted window, the hairs on his neck prickling from their glances. The quidditch pitch scene spread back over the glass with the snitch flashing between the pennants. Footsteps tracked out of the room after several moments. Harry heard Draco huff softly, dropping back into one of the plush chairs. He summoned a book from one of the tables in a low voice, “Any of the books or games in the common room are for sharing, so help yourself. The others will start waking up in a little while.” Draco nodded back down the hallway toward the rooms.
Harry stirred in his bed. His head pounded with the movement. Groaning, he opened his eyes as far as he dared. Gentle light streamed in through the hospital wing windows and enveloped the room in a soft glow. He blinked, his eyes adjusting to the light enough to notice Draco curled into a chair at his bedside.
Draco wrapped the tie for his dressing gown tighter around his waist. He padded into the common room, stopping short at the sight of the fire crackling. Brushing the sleep out of his eyes, Draco peered around until his eyes settled on a shock of black hair poking out from the top of a squashy bean bag chair. The blond sighed, strode to his usual overstuffed armchair and sank into the cushion.
Harry tugged his sleeve down over his wrist before taking the vial. A flush burned through his cheeks. It took every fiber of nerve not to run back to his temporary bed and bury his head beneath the pillow. Nodding stiffly, he tucked the vial in his pocket, “If you require anything else, I am one fire call away. But no not abuse it.” He gave Harry a stern look.
"S'my only pair," Harry muttered. His eyes drifted closed, sound asleep again in seconds. Draco's manicured brows furrowed. The savior of the wizarding world only had one pair of shoes? Eyes dark, he tucked the blankets tighter around Harry's small frame. He stepped over the remaining trainer he'd tripped over. Before he excused himself from the hospital wing, heading for the Great Hall in time for dinner. Years ago, the fact that Potter only owned one pair of shoes would have been a source of endless amusement for Draco. But he was younger then. Like he told Potter before, they weren't children any longer.
Harry swallowed the growing lump in his throat. He reached into the back pocket of his tatty muggle jeans and pulled out a crumpled newspaper clipping. It clung to his clammy fingers, but he managed to get it unfurled on the glass countertop.
Tugging the fine, loose hairs off his forehead, he slid through the rest of the hall. After a near stumble over an abandoned Ravenclaw scarf and kicking someone's right shoe, Draco stood in the common room. His heavy-lidded eyes swept over the room before coming to rest on a shock of black hair. It peeked over the plush arm of Draco's favorite chair. Almost blending into the faded navy material.
“You can’t blame me,” Draco sniffed. He ran his fingers through his hair to straighten it up and brushed dust off his dark trousers, “You were well warned that if you didn’t show up for cuddles at least three times a week that there would be a kidnapping staged, were you not?”
He climbed through the entrance, only to be engulfed by a horde of Gryffindors calling his name. He smiled, endured pats on the back and ruffles of his hair and stepped around as many questions as he could. Even Ron and Hermione didn’t get it out of him later that night, no matter how much they pestered.
It swirled around, roiling beneath the surface to reveal the common room. Grinning, Harry pulled over one of the stools. He grimaced at the squeals of its stoppers over the stone floor. Harry scrambled on, transfixed by what he saw on the other side. Draco, Blaise, and the other Fifth years stood with their backs against the wall. Draco right in front of the tapestry, to block Umbridge’s path if she made it that far.
“Thank you, Professor,” Harry offered weakly. His gaze followed a Seventh-year girl swinging an open vial toward Umbridge. A red spray shot across her face, making Umbridge sputter. She strained against the gluey substance holding her in place, calling out all sorts of nasty threats against the Slytherins. Until a sudden puff of smoke filled the air surrounding Umbridge. Hacking coughs filled the room, overpowering one last shriek. The smoke cleared and Umbridge was gone. All the coughing was replaced with crows of victory from the members of Slytherin house.
No one heard it.
“Remember the ad I placed in the Prophet a few weeks ago?” Snape nodded, “Harry’s my first client. He’s learning to be a lord.” Severus hummed, his thin lips twitching into something that resembled a smile.
"You wish," He mumbled into the material covering his legs. Draco snorted. He reached over and hooked Harry's chin in his hand. Giving soft tug, until the Gryffindor had no choice but to meet his gaze. Harry found warm grey eyes staring into his.
“Mr. Potter, I understand your throat’s been bothering you, but it’s been a week. Surely it’s recovered by now.” McGonagall’s stern tones made Draco’s ears perk up. He watched the Gryffindor shrug, giving his throat an absent rub. How the faculty hadn’t caught onto the bet, Draco didn’t know. All he’d heard in the halls all week had been chatter about it, “If you’re sick enough not to speak then I insist you go see Madam Pomfrey.” Draco’s eyebrows rose. Was this finally going to put the bet to rest?
"Neutralizing her will be no simple task, Potter may be our guest for some time." Draco nodded, "And you know by sealing the writ, you've essentially elected yourself as his protector." Shrugging, Draco picked a piece of lint off his robe. He couldn't imagine that everyone else in Slytherin would be jumping to have Potter in their house, but they would certainly come to his aid given the circumstances. He would make sure of it.
“Of course, it’ll be good practice for your lessons to try to behave in polite company.” Harry’s shoulders drooped. His gaze fell to the toes of his boots. Right, even being asked to dinner was purely business. He didn’t know why it bothered him so much, but it did. He swallowed a lump in his throat and dragged his gaze up to catch Draco smirking, “I’ll be by at 6:00 to help you choose your outfit and fix your hair.” Harry rolled his eyes, but with one look at Draco’s wide eyes, he nodded.
"I love them. You didn't have to-" Harry began, but Draco held up a hand to cut him off. The blond traced a finger along Harry's cheekbone, catching a wayward tear that threatened to drip down his cheek.
Harry forgets to ask for help, but it's given anyway...sort of.
"Get my uncle in here, now," Draco commanded. He strode through the common room, getting himself and Harry Potter out of sight. Something had gone horribly wrong and he needed answers.
Draco’s gaze followed the shock of black hair as it bobbed and weaved between the other students, wondering what was going on in Potter’s scarred head. A gentle heat spread through the Slytherin’s face, was it a trick of his eye or had Potter been blushing? Whatever was going on in Potter’s head, Draco had no idea.
The opening slid closed, leaving Harry and Draco tangled together in a heap on the floor.
Draco’s shaking fingers found Harry’s steady pulse at his neck, thrumming hard enough to set him more at ease. He’d be fine. Harry had come back from worse. A little fall like that was nothing, wasn’t it? Scrambling to his feet, Draco scooped up Harry into his arms and rushed back toward the castle to get help.
“Not as much as you will be for smudging my mirror with your grubby hands.” Harry pulled his hands back. He flushed at the throaty laugh echoing from the man behind him. When Snape had recovered, he sighed and wiped a tear out of the corner of his eyes, “No, there will be no repercussions for their actions. The Writ of House Protection allows them to act as they see fit to protect you. And for whatever reason, they’ve chosen to respond to the threat like a bunch of Gryffindors.”
Draco shook his head, letting the scrap of paper fall to one of the cluttered side tables, "Any terms to the bet, then?" He asked, half hoping that Potter would slip up and answer him out loud. It wasn't like he actually expected the Gryffindor to take him up on it. But his dark hair flopped over his face when he bent back over a new scrap of parchment. After a few scratched lines, the new parchment landed in Draco's waiting hands.
Harry tucked the letter into the pocket of his robe. He beamed. Scarfing down his breakfast, he borrowed a quill and parchment scrap to scrawl out a quick response.
“That’s sufficient to start. We’ll start first thing tomorrow and whatever I say goes. Do we have an arrangement?” He asked. Draco offered Harry a hand. An image flashed into his head of a much younger Malfoy on a train platform, a hand offered out to shake. A younger version of himself whipped his hand away, refusing whatever Draco had to offer. But he grasped Draco’s hand in a firm shake. He and the blond grinned at each other, “Then pleasure doing business with you.”
“This takes you to my uncle’s private potion’s lab, hurry there and wait for someone to come and get you,” He ordered.
Harry craned his neck toward the snitch and the high ceiling above. Between the floating candles, a leafy sprig dangled down from the ceiling. He flushed. They were under the mistletoe. Before he could say anything, Draco pressed his lips against Harry’s. Harry stiffened, then melted in the blond’s embrace. He finally tugged back from Draco to catch his breath. Draco grinned, leaning forward to catch the snitch again. He handed it over to Harry, then the ball fell still. Its wings collapsed back inside itself.
Draco stroked his hair, holding him close until he felt Harry loll in his arms. Glancing down, he found him dead asleep in his lap. He tucked a loose strand of hair out of the other boy’s face and slipped his glasses off of him before returning his gaze to his uncle.
Flushing, Harry stared down into his own drink. It fogged his glasses. He tried to make himself look anywhere but the other boy. Luna flashed Harry a knowing, dreamy smile over the top of her notepad,
"I think so. My head's not throbbing anymore." Draco nodded, moving onto the other boot.
“And James…My dad, helped you because he had to? Because he was acting as an emissary?” Harry asked. He watched Snape consider the question, as he poured the potion into vials with steady hands. The professor stoppered them one by one until he found his answer in a low tone.
A gentle mist of water flowed around his head. Freshly damp hair clung to his cheeks and the back of his neck. Draco’s fingers ran through the strands of hair, teasing out tangles. His buffed nails tickled Harry’s scalp in a way that made Harry melt. He let out a happy sigh, settling deeper into the chair.
A focused quiet settled on the group, only to be aroused by the sound of the professor's floo crackling to life. He pinched the bridge of his nose again, muttering as he swept across the room. The low rumbles of his voice broke the steady flow of work. Draco put his knife down, hovering on the edge of his stool. He strained his ears to listen. One of his hands jutted out to catch Harry's wrist and stop his scrubbing for a moment. Rolling his eyes, Harry set the brush down. He leaned on his elbows and stretched his arms from having stooped over the cauldrons. Four glistening pots sat on the table in front of Harry. Only a few more remained in the dirty stack.
"If I didn't know any better, I'd think I was still out of it from the squid ink," Harry mumbled. His gaze fixed on the surface of the lake, tensing at the sight of bubbles brewing beneath the surface of the water.
Draco slid the missive out of Harry's hands, "Figures." He tucked the note and attached coupon into a pocket in his robe, "That's not the important part, anyway." Harry lifted the box lid after Draco craned his neck at it in silent encouragement. He folded back the delicate tissue paper to reveal a pair of glossy, black boots. Crimson and gold-flecked laces wound between the dark metal eyelets. Harry's mouth fell open, he reached out to stroke the supple leather and trace the robust stitching, "Here," Draco peeled the blankets aside from Harry's feet, glad to see the Gryffindor's grubby socks had been replaced by a fresh pair. He loosened the laces enough to slide the boots over Harry's feet, then tightened them with deft hands, "Now, keep these away from the giant squid," Draco ordered, "Though, I'd like to see it try to pull these off you when they're laced properly like this."
“Our doors will be open to you always, whether you need protection or not.” Harry let go. He bent down to retrieve the abandoned stick, as well as some of the other ones. Draco shook his head. He slid the stack out of Harry’s grasp, “Go find your Gryffindors. They’re probably worried about you.”
A lone tentacle poked above the water, suction cups popping against each other. Harry jumped. Draco chuckled, he tightened his hold on Harry, and petted his hair, "You're shaking like a leaf, Petal. What happened to my courageous Gryffindor lion?" Harry shrugged, a crimson flush crept over his cheeks. Resisting the urge to bury his face in Draco's sweater, Harry turned away from the squid.
Draco hadn’t imagined that the writ would take the protection of the house so far as to lock Harry inside the dorms. Of course, it made protecting him from Umbridge easier if Potter couldn’t leave. They only had to protect Potter from himself. Rolling his eyes, he snatched one of Harry’s wrists before it could slam into the barrier again.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I don't know why I agreed to giving you a piggyback ride, Petal," He drawled gently. Harry nuzzled into the crook of Draco's neck in reply, "Madam Pomfrey gave you a clean bill of health and you're more than capable of walking on your own. Not to mention the lovely new boots you have to break in." Harry kicked his feet out in front of them to admire the glossy finish on his boots. The flecks of gold in his laces caught the last of the sunlight. Their reflections danced in Harry's emerald eyes, catching Draco's breath in his throat.
Harry nodded. The snake flicked his tongue uneasily. But it slithered back further in the frame and moments later the opening slid apart to allow them entry. They stumbled inside moments before the opening slammed shut behind them.
“Draco,” Luna broke the comfortable silence in the room, “we’re helping the elves decorate the tree in tomorrow. Would you like to join us?” Draco’s eyes widened. Most of the eighth years decided to let go of the past. No one was unkind to him to his face, but he wasn’t often invited to events.
"We should give him some cookies when we're finished," Harry said, scooping blobs of dough onto the tray.
Draco brushed past him in the small space to start brewing tea. Harry stood in the doorway, shifting foot to foot. The blond glanced back and rolled his eyes. He set down the kettle with a gentle clatter and rested his hands on Harry's shoulders. Draco steered him toward a set of plush armchairs in one of the corners of the room. He sunk into the thick cushion and waited. The blond bustled around the little kitchenette to prepare the tea, "Be a dear and go choose two teacups from the other room, would you?" He called over his shoulder.
“It’s just a little charm. It stops when you catch it.” The snitch floated way out of reach. It settled itself onto one of the high bookshelves like it was waiting for something. Shrugging, Harry bent down to gather the rest of the checkers. He and Luna raided the rest of the cookie tin while they waited for Draco to emerge from his dorm. The snitch was almost forgotten by the time the blond boy left his room.
He snatched the snitch up off the table. It didn’t seem any different from the other snitches he’d used or had in his mouth, for that matter. Harry lifted the snitch to his lips and gave it a quick peck before he could think better of it. Cool gold stung his lips. Its wings whirred into life. Harry snapped back from the snitch. It whizzed through the air and ducked out of the gap under his door before he could stop it.
He scrounged up a burgundy waistcoat out of the pile, trading his green shirt for a white one. He slipped into the fitted burgundy trousers with a black stripe that ran down the side of his leg. Sliding on his black dress robes, he brushed them down and straightened everything before returning to Draco. The blond nodded, he held up a hand to signal Harry to turn. He turned, redder than the undertones in his waistcoat and trousers, “Now, if you really wanted to be civilized, I’d insist you switch out those boots for dress shoes, but I don’t want to push it.” Draco smirked, “Now take off the dress robe, we’re going to the front of the store.”
"I didn't if I remember correctly. Hate to break to you, Malfoy, present you isn’t exactly a treat either," He stuck out his tongue. Draco sniffed. He turned his wide eyes on the Gryffindor, putting a hand on his heart like the words stung him. But his lips twitched into a grin that he barely fought to suppress.
"You don't mean-"
“Does he play?” Harry asked. Draco snorted.
Not that he’d admit it to anyone, but he was beginning to miss the Gryffindor’s chatter. The two had played chess games almost every night that week, but he had a feeling it was no substitute for Harry’s conversations, “Mr. Malfoy, see Mr. Potter to the hospital wing.” The headmistress and transfigurations professor ordered.
Shivering, Harry sat down on a stool and waited. A dull clamor from the common room carried to his ears from down the tunnel. Then he heard a shriek. Harry jumped up. He couldn’t sit still any longer. Pacing through the lab, Harry caught sight of a mirror that seemed oddly out of place. It rippled like water when he took a step closer. Narrowing his eyes, Harry leaned forward and tapped the glass.
Draco felt bile rising in his throat. He choked it down long enough to tuck Harry's arms back beneath the blankets, "Dear Merlin, who would do that to a child?" Draco's lips cracked apart. He shuddered, holding his arms close across his chest.
“Merlin Potter, never scare me like that again.” Harry nodded, even when it made his head ring. He squeezed Draco back and shoved over to make space for him on the narrow hospital bed. The blond hesitated for a second before clambering onto the bedside him.
"Ah, I see you've brought Mr. Potter with you. What a welcome surprise," The man drawled without his usual bite. He rolled his eyes and opened his arms for Draco's inevitable hug. Draco grinned tucking himself into the folds of Snape's black robes. He let out a happy sigh, only relinquishing his hold when the man ordered, "All right off now Dragon, I think I've indulged you more than enough for the moment. There's work to be done." Guiding them into his quarters and into the private lab off the common room.
“I’ll keep it to myself.” The man gave him a grateful smile as the room fell silent again only seconds before Draco burst through the door. He strolled over to their worktable, brows raising at the sight of the two sitting so close together.
Draco stared down at the hunched form of Harry Potter, sprawled across the stones of the dungeon floor. His eyes narrowed, flicking back and forth for signs of anyone else in the hall. But Potter was alone. The dark-haired boy was clutching his wrist and shaking like a leaf.
Harry scraped his finger over the edge of the batter bowl to snag a chocolate chip while Luna's back was turned. He hummed to himself, grinning at the taste of chocolate melting on his tongue. Luna blew on the mugs of hot cocoa that the Hogwarts elves brought them. She swept her blonde hair back behind her ears and offered Harry his mug.
“You don’t remember?” Draco’s eyebrows rose. He’d assumed Potter knew what happened during their argument earlier that morning. It never occurred to him the other boy didn’t. Stroking the back of his neck, Draco swallowed. He realized he probably owed Potter an apology, “Well, you’ll probably want to move to one of the chairs if we’re going to have this talk. It’ll be more comfortable.” Harry shook his head insistently, hair falling across his scar.
"Yes, now lie back before you make yourself sick. You're looking a little green," Draco scolded. He set the parcel aside and pressed lightly against Harry's shoulders until the sick Gryffindor flopped against his pillows. Two more doses of potions perched on the tray table by Harry's head, waiting for his awakening. Draco lifted one of the glasses to Harry's cracked lips, "Drink." Harry pressed his lips together, trying to turn away from the Slytherin, "Oh none of that," Draco caught Harry's chin in his free hand. He guided the boy back toward the glass and held him there until Harry gulped down the potion. Gagging at the taste of gym socks, Harry sputtered. The Slytherin hummed, stroking Harry's cheek with his thumb, "That's it. One more, then you can have your present." Harry's eyes widened behind his glasses. He glanced at the parcel.
“Yes, you’ll find that Draco is a very touchy person. Don’t be surprised if he tries to cuddle you at some point.” Draco smacked his hand against Blaise’s thigh, a flush rushing through his cheeks. But he didn’t bother denying it or even moving from his perch. Instead, he lifted Blaise’s hand into position on his head. The boy complied, stroking Draco’s hair until the blond’s scowl softened.
Draco rolled his eyes, “Fine, you’ve made yourself clear. And what do you intend to do about Madam Pomfrey?” Harry snatched the parchment back.
Harry gulped. He picked up the brush and began to attack the next of the cauldrons. Burying his head in his work, he tried to focus. But he felt the man's gaze settling on him. Despite the professor's cold tones, things had been less heated between them since Harry and invoked the Writ nearly a month before. But something struck Harry. Gathering his courage, Harry broke the silence in the room.
“Make it stop if you care so much, Lovegood.” Draco snapped. He pushed away from the table and stormed out of the room, with the snitch flitting behind him. Harry wanted to chase after him but thought he should give the Slytherin some space. He finished his breakfast, glaring at Luna over the top of his juice cup.
Harry winced. He knew from Remus that the Marauders partook in bullying that could make Dudley seem as harmless as a garden slug, with his father as the ringleader. But he didn’t like to think about it, “Yes,” The man muttered over the potion, “not everyone can be a hero, Potter. Even if we’d like them to be.” Harry nodded. He dug his fingers into the base of the stool, knuckles turning white.
“I don’t know,” Harry ran his hands through his messy hair, “He’s been through a lot.”
After spending most of the day back in Slytherin house, Harry rejoined his housemates in the Gryffindor common room with a goofy smile plastered across his face.
“Quit fiddling with it, you’re going to stretch it out and it’s not lord like,” Draco ordered. He stopped, stuffing his hands in the pockets of his trousers instead. Still not lord like, but if it kept him from destroying his sweater Draco seemed content enough.
“If it does, you will attempt to bring Mr. Potter to my private lab. Barring that, you and the other members of this house will do whatever is necessary to extricate her from the premises. There will be no repercussions for actions taken as you will be acting as emissaries for the writ.”
"Where?" Nose wrinkling when Draco shook his head, "Is this one of those times where it's not actually a surprise? Where you're just not telling me because you think I wouldn't come if I knew?" Draco smirked. He put his free hand against his heart in feigned hurt over Harry's words. But he pressed his curled lips together, doubling his pace down the hall and dragging Harry behind him, "Don't play innocent. That's exactly what this is."
“And you want me to go with you?” His voice rose and cracked. Draco nodded.
Footwear was notoriously hard to transfigure, even Hermione struggled with shoes. Harry kicked a stone with the one trainer he had left. It ricocheted off the flagstones of one of the pathways and rolled until it smacked into someone's polished loafer. Wincing, Harry dragged his gaze off the ground to offer a rushed apology to the owner of the shoe. None other than Draco Malfoy.
“Both,” He said, glowing, “coming, Harry?” He asked. Harry nodded, stood, and laced his fingers through Draco’s.
Harry woke up to clattering sound. There was enough noise and clamor, that he almost forgot he wasn’t in Gryffindor’s dorms any longer. He rolled out of bed and fumbled around until he found his glasses on the side table. Casting a quick tempus, he found it was almost dinner time. He’d somehow managed to sleep his afternoon away when he didn’t remember falling asleep in the first place.
“Just do it.” The hands left his shoulders after one final squeeze. Harry listened to the clip of Draco’s shoes against the tile floor. A clatter of metal and plastic carried to his ears, though he tried not to think about it. He squinted to try to make out what Draco was doing, but beyond the blur of blond hair he couldn’t make out anything. Closing his eyes, he leaned back and waited.
“Good, now once you finish your tea, go put on something you think would be appropriate for a ball.” Harry groaned. He sunk lower into the cushion of his chair, savoring his tea. Agreeing to do whatever Draco said seemed less of a good idea by the moment, but he had to keep to his word. He downed his tea and slid back behind the curtains for a new outfit.
Harry flushed. He burrowed deeper into Draco’s hold for a moment, before freeing himself enough to meet Draco’s gaze,
Hi everyone! I'm really still enjoying this concept, so decided to explore some of the Writ of House Protection's history at Hogwarts. A lot more Snape and a little less fluff, but I hope you all enjoy it all the same💚
"Merlin Potter, do you ever stop talking? I bet you couldn't keep your mouth shut if you tried." Draco let his textbook slam shut. Unlike the Slytherin common room, the eighth-year dorms were always loud, and it seemed like Potter was always to blame for the noise. If it wasn't Potter then it was a member of his fan club, so he was equally responsible for that nonsense even if he wasn't directly involved in it, as far as Draco was concerned. How was he supposed to get any done?
“Do I work here now?” Harry asked, a little bemused. Draco shrugged.
Thinking keeps Harry awake, but Draco has just the thing to settle his mind. He always does. You could say it's a gift. So, goodnight Stud Muffin
"Well, I was thinking about it, anyway." Harry arched his neck to press against the crook of Draco's shoulder and meet his grey eyes. The blond reached forward, brushing the hair off Harry's forehead. His fingers glanced over his boyfriend's lightning scar.
"What happened to you?" Draco asked. Harry didn't respond, beyond a soft whimper that slipped out of his lips. Crouching down to the other boy's level, Draco carded hair away from Harry's face, "Potter?" The boy stiffened beneath his touch, curling tighter around his injured hand.
"Of course, Petal. Are you walking this time?" Harry bit his lip. He gave Draco a crooked grin and fluttered his dark eyelashes. The Slytherin let out a rueful chuckle, unable to resist the adorableness of his Gryffindor, "How foolish of me to ask, climb aboard." Harry flashed him a winning grin, scrambling back to his perch. He gave Draco a quick peck on the cheek. As the blond turned back toward the castle, Harry stole one last glance at the lake.
"Snape?" Harry's voice nearly squeaked. Mouth gaping, he stared between the two Slytherins.
“Morning, Potter. Glad to see you’re feeling better. Blaise Zabini,” The boy stuck his hand out over the chessboard. Harry stared at the hand for a moment, before cautiously returning the gesture, “I can give you a real rival if you want?” Blaise’s dark eyes flicked to the board, then back to the newest Slytherin.
“Indeed, I know you’re stressed but it’s no excuse for disappearing on me,” Draco mumbled, pressing his face against Harry’s shoulder. He nestled into his Gryffindor boyfriend’s side, “You know if you need help, you only have to ask for it, don’t you?” He asked. His nimble fingers tugged on the sloppily tied Gryffindor tie around Harry’s neck.
“He refused my invitation to a chair, but we have discovered a bit of a development.” Detangling himself from his uncle’s robes, Draco tugged on Harry’s arm and pulled him to his feet, “Show him the thing with the opening.” His slender fingers dug into Harry’s shoulder blades, nudging him toward the wall. Harry’s eyes narrowed behind his glasses. He shook off Draco’s grip but placed his palm against the opening.
"I'm never letting you kidnap me again," Harry muttered. He released his iron grip on Draco's hand when they reached the bottom of the steps. The Slytherin massaged his knuckles, rolled his eyes at Harry, and knocked on the door at the base of the landing. Three raps quick against the wood, then two slower ones closer to the ground. Slow, purposeful steps sounded on the floor beyond the heavy door. Harry swallowed as the door swung open, hinges squealing in protest.
"And what else were you thinking about, Muffin?" Harry's flushing cheeks framed his wrinkled nose. He shrugged.
“Why is it that you’re always on the floor, Mr. Potter? Get up.” Harry scrambled back to his feet and straightened his robes before turning back to the professor, “I see you found my mirror.” Nodding, Harry swallowed. Draco hadn’t said not to touch anything and he hadn’t tried to rifle through things that weren’t in plain sight, but there hadn’t been much time for directions, “Please don’t mention it to Draco or the others. I’d like to keep them wondering how I know the goings-on of their common room.” Harry’s eyes went wide behind his glasses, but he nodded.
Harry had just convinced the black set of the wizard’s chess pieces to play him when footsteps padded down the hall toward the common room. Muffled voices carried to his ears. The rest of Slytherin house was waking up for the morning, funneling toward the common room. From what Harry gathered from Draco, none of them would be surprised to see him. Most of them had witnessed when Draco dragged him into the room. Harry flushed, ordering one of his pawns to attack one of its rivals.
“And what exactly am I agreeing to, darling nephew?” Severus drawled. He swept into the room with a tray floating behind him. Flicking his wand, the teacups drifted into waiting hands.
Draco set the scissors down. He massaged Harry’s scalp again, gently scratching the shortened hair on the sides of Harry’s head. He’d left the top long, just shaped and neatened it up. Dipping into a small cannister, he coated his fingers in a lightly scented cream before running them through Harry’s hair. Harry hummed. He curled into Draco’s hands, “Almost done.” He muttered, fluffing up the front of Harry’s hair into a gentle swoop. Wiping his hands on the sheet, he tugged it away from Harry’s neck in the same motion, “There, that wasn’t so bad was it?” Harry shrugged. He hadn’t seen it yet to know. One of his hands swept to the table beside him to find his glasses.
Hi everyone! I hope this bonus ficlet finds you safe and healthy and brings you at least a little bit of joy.  💚
"And you say his robes changed when he asked for your help?" Draco nodded. Snape pinched the bridge of his thin nose, "Why, what does that mean Uncle Sev?" They moved to sit on the edge of Draco's bed before their conversation made Potter stir from his sleep.
They traveled around the cleared space on the floor, until Harry found his stride. He whirled around with the blond’s muscular frame steadying him. The music lulled Harry into an almost trance, finding himself at ease. His eyes locked on Draco’s sparkling blue eyes. He never realized it before, but they were the same color as the door to the Em-Pour-ium. Somewhere he was feeling increasingly at home.
“And you haven’t?” Luna cocked her head to the side. She sucked on the end of her quill, staring Harry down with her dreamy eyes. Harry shrugged. Snagging his cocoa and his mug, he retreated to his own dorm without another word.
Eyes furrowed, he took a peek over toward the Slytherin tables and found Blaise and Draco waving back at him. Grinning, he tore open the letter.
“What the hell just happened?” Ron blurted out. Hermione’s gaze followed the two out of the Great Hall.
Draco nodded. He traced the embroidered edge of the pillow on his lap,
"Mmmm, is that so?" Draco squeezed him tighter, swaying them back and forth, "I didn't see you untangling from your little pretzel knot, there," he drawled. He snorted at Harry's shrug, "Nor did I see you flipping through that book of yours."
"How did you know about the Writ of House Protection?" The man sneered down at Harry.
It would all be over soon. He wouldn’t be a Slytherin anymore. Draco and the others would go back to hating him. He didn’t think that he could go back to hating them. Biting his lip, he watched the scene without the humor of before. Harry rubbed his eyes with the back of his sleeve, trying to hide his glassy eyes from Snape, but the man caught his gaze in the mirror.
Harry stood behind a thin curtain in the corner of Draco’s tearoom. There might as well have been no curtain. He was sure that Draco could see every outline of his body behind it. Boxes of clothes filled up space around his feet. Dress robes, day robes, trousers, shirts, sweaters, and a modest collection of shoes spilled out of the boxes. He yanked his t-shirt off, replacing it with a green button-down. Harry slid his arms down the sleeves, the material soft against his skin. The old, muggle jeans he replaced with a pair of charcoal trousers.
“Dumbledore or Lupin?” He asked. His tone and expression unreadable. The Gryffindor swallowed before he gathered the courage to respond.
He folded up the note and cast a floating charm to send it over to Draco. The blond caught the paper and unfolded it quickly. He deciphered the scrawl, a flush growing across his cheeks. Rolling his eyes, Draco stood up and strode through the hall to stand in front of the Gryffindor table. Ignoring the glares from Ron and Hermione, he pressed his hands down onto the table,
A pair of firm arms locked around Harry’s chest, dragging him back behind a rusty suit of armor perched in a dusty alcove.
“Thank you.” Draco didn’t speak often anymore, so Harry knew he meant it. He nodded and returned his attention to his own snack. But he kept sneaking glances at the blond. Grinning at the sight of the crumbs on the pale boy’s cheeks. Draco was less of a dignified pureblood since returning to school. He was quieter and bashful in a way that made Harry want to forget their previous rivalry altogether.
"I doubt that, Dragon. It was a threat much closer, something inside the castle." Draco's eyes narrowed. The flash of pink tweed crept back into his mind. Umbridge. He'd heard rumors of her detentions, and of course, Potter couldn't keep himself out of trouble for more than a day. He'd had at least one. Draco untangled himself from his uncle's hold and crept back over to Harry's bed.
“A brief performance.” Draco tilted his hand toward the piano in the corner, “Potter needs a dance lesson, so we’ll need some music to work with. Harry snapped his head toward Draco, shaking his head. Snape chuckled.
"Draco and I are going to be preparing an order for Saint Mungo's. You will sit quietly unless instructed otherwise." Harry nodded. He resigned himself to sitting on his hands and pretending he didn't exist like he was back at the Dursleys'. There were worse ways to spend a Sunday, he supposed.
“I’m in the process of acquiring your school bag and your other things, but it will take time as everything has to be clandestine. That melon-colored medusa is incessant on tracking you down.” Harry shivered, tightening his grip on the pillow. Draco caught sight of the shift. He slipped from his uncle’s embrace and joined Harry back on the floor. Untangling Harry’s hands from the cushion, he gave them a soft squeeze,
“Don’t be, I like to see what people choose. It tells me a lot about them.”
"Why's that?" Draco caught Harry's chin and tugged it away from the lake, back toward him, "That's right, just look at me. Much nicer view than a slimy cephalopod, isn't?" Harry nodded. The crown tipped on his head until Draco righted it. Harry bit his lip. He balanced his chin on his knee
“What does happen when Umbridge looks down here?” He asked in a low voice. Snape sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose.
Blaise scowled over the top of the board but allowed Draco to advise Harry in his moves. With Draco’s whispered help, Harry was only somewhat decimated by the other Slytherin.
Bracing himself for what he would find on the other side of the door, Harry left the room and padded to the common area. An arm slung around his shoulders,
A set of footsteps clicked from around the corner, followed by a clearing of someone's throat with a familiar,
“If he wasn’t a potion’s master, he’d be a concert pianist. He’s incredible, I bet if you wheedle him as you did for the recipe he’ll agree.”
“Open it,” he ordered. Harry snorted, “For the record, it’s not my fault the password was changed and no one bothered to inform me.” Rolling his eyes, Harry leaned forward to whisper in parseltongue to the snake in the portrait.
The barrier blocked him in. Swallowing, he crossed his arms and turned back to his professor. Snape pinched the bridge of his nose.
“What did you do all night in Gryffindor?” The man shrugged.
“One diagnostic charm and the jig is up, Potter.” Draco reminded him, “It’s been a week. You’ve made your point and were as impressively stubborn as always. Talk if you want, I won’t hold it against you.”
“What?” He squawked, “I can’t do that.” Luna hummed. She stacked her plate on top of Draco’s abandoned one to make less of a mess for the elves to clean up. The blonde girl hopped up from her seat, skipping down the hall.
"I was going to wait until exams were over to surprise you with, but if it's keeping you up at night then I suppose I'll have to ruin it." Draco handed Harry the paper. Brows furrowing, Harry smoothed out the creasing on the muggle paper. It was a clipping from a newspaper for an apartment in Muggle London for rent. A picture of an exposed brick wall bathed in sunlight from a set of wide windows caught Harry's eyes. One of his fingers trailed around the picture, "I rented it for us, with some help from Granger on the muggle communication."
Draco slid into the hospital wing, balancing a wrapped parcel in the crook of his elbow. He glanced around for the school's mediwitch, but there were no signs of her or her crisp, white cap. He crept over to Harry's bed with the full intention of dropping the box on the side table and leaving. But a pair of green eyes peeked at him from beneath the sheets.
“Did you really learn wandless, nonverbal casting just to win the bet?” Draco asked. He leaned against a mossy boulder with Potter beside him. Harry nodded. A grin stretched across his cheeks, “You’re something else, Potter.” The Gryffindor nodded again. Shivering without his jacket in the fading light, Harry nestled against Draco’s side. The blond rolled his eyes, but draped his arm around the Gryffindor, “For the record, I do not cuddle.”
“Luckily, I’m prepared for all situations,” Draco announced. He balanced the text between them and flipped through the pages. He slung his arm over Harry’s shoulders and pulled him closer.
Harry slid out of the dress robe, following Draco until the blond sent him back to fold his crumpled robe over the back of the chair. With the nod of approval, he wandered through the beaded curtain. He fiddled with the beads until Draco tugged him away from the doorway.
Luna washed away her giggles in more hot chocolate. She took the tray from Harry and wandered over to the elves with it. They didn't like the students near their ovens. So, they started to clean their mess before the elves shooed them away from that as well. Cocoa mugs in hand, they wandered out of the kitchen. Luna skipped through the empty halls and Harry trailed behind her, "Back to the common room?" He asked. Luna nodded. They had plenty of time before the cookies were ready and cool, knowing the elves they would just end up delivering the cookies to them. Harry strode to the tapestry with the unicorn on it, pulling it aside to reveal the entrance to the eighth-year dorms. He tapped his wand three times on the brass knocker and muttered, "Four houses, One home". The door sprung open on its squeaky hinges.
Everyone returned to their conversations, at what Draco noted to be a much more reasonable volume. Grinning, he dropped into his seat in the overstuffed armchair and pulled his textbook back onto his lap. He licked the pad of his thumb to pick between the pages until he found his place. The silence was only going to last for so long, Draco intended to enjoy every moment of it.
Fingers tracing the bumps raised on his pale arms, Draco tiptoed to his slippers and stuffed them on. He flicked his wand to his dressing gown. It drifted over to wrap around his shoulders. Draco tugged the collar up around his neck to ward away the cold. He shuffled from the room, wincing at the announcing squeaks of the door hinges. The noise echoed through the narrow hall of the Eighth-year dorm. It made Draco stiffen, but no one stirred.
Harry snorted at the sight of her struggles, a grin wide enough to ache on his face. A set of footsteps on the stones behind him had him whirling around fast enough to knock himself off the stool. He sprawled on the floor, clutching his head from where it bashed onto the stones. Blinking, he stared up at the dark form of Snape looming over him.
"Good night Stud Muffin."
“Now, this is something I never expected to see.” Snape drawled. Harry shivered through the thin material of his dress shirt, “Good morning, Draco, Lord Potter.” Harry swallowed. He nodded at the old potion’s professor. A swift cuff knocked into the back of Harry’s head. Cringing, Harry nursed the spot that Draco smacked. He grimaced and turned back to Draco. The blond crossed his arms across his chest.
Harry thanked him without bringing his head up, not expecting any sort of reply. The low clatter of working had settled on the room again between the grinding and Snape’s brew. Footsteps in the distance jarred Harry from his focus. Draco making his way back down the set of narrow steps, “Mr. Potter, much like my mirror and what you see when you enter our common room-” Harry cut off the sentence.
“I’ve already been told to keep anything I see here to myself,” Harry offered, setting his parchment aside, “I won’t say anything.” He lifted one of the cushions off the floor and squeezed it against his chest. The professor nodded, relaxing his gaze.
Draco rolled his eyes. He dropped onto the bench beside Harry, leaning over to mutter something low in his ear. Harry flushed. He resisted the urge to burrow his face into his arms on the table. A daisy petal drifted from the crown. It tickled Harry's nose until he sneezed. Draco smirked. He leaned forward to brush the petal off of Harry's face, "Make a wish," He drawled, balancing the little petal out on his finger. Harry rolled his eyes but obeyed before leaning back against Draco. His green eyes flickered around the hall at all the eyes staring back at them.
“That’s cruel.”
Harry snorted. Leaning over the edge of the boulder, he offered his hand to Draco so the blond would join him. Before Draco could reach for the hand, Harry lost his footing on the slick moss. He gasped, falling back to the stone below and vanishing from Draco’s line of sight. Even with the moss, a sickening crack carried to Draco’s ears.
Groaning, Harry pressed one of the pillows against his face. It truly wasn't his day. Seconds later, the pillow tugged away from his face. Draco stared coolly down at him on the bed, "I didn't drag you all the way here so you could smother yourself with a pillow, Potter. Do me a favor and try to stay alive for at least a little while." Harry's brows furrowed from beneath his glasses, but he nodded, "Sit forward." The blond ordered. Harry crossed his arms but obeyed again. To his surprise, Draco returned the offending pillow to its place behind Harry. He fluffed it up, "You can lie back now." Harry nodded. He settled back, tugging the blankets around himself, "Madam Pomfrey told me I could stay until you woke up, but you're awake now." Draco tugged on the collar of his sweater, "I should go." He stood up, but a hand latched onto his sleeve before he could turn away. Harry's fingers gripped Draco's arm.
“Relax Potter, this is the last place anyone would think to look for you. You’re safe with us.”
Draco spent most of dinner staring down at his scuffed loafer. Pansy caught him doing it once or twice. She giggled, reached into her bag for something, and told him,
All through breakfast, the snitch circled Draco’s head. It made dives for his bacon. Harry tried to catch it but ended up spilling pumpkin juice all over Draco instead. Blushing, Harry sunk back into his seat. Draco rolled his eyes, magicked himself clean, and poured Harry a new drink.
“That thing is a pain.” They watched the snitch float around the candles in the hall. Harry nodded. He sipped his pumpkin juice, “What was Lovegood thinking?”
"You don't mean that.” A preening smile etched across Draco's cheeks. Harry shook his head. He didn't. Harry liked Draco, a lot actually. Sighing, Draco leaned forward to fix Harry's flower crown between his cowlicks, "we should get you back. We've got to get you some lunch and back to the hospital wing before Madam Pomfrey has my head." Draco scrambled to his feet, holding his hands out for Harry to take. Harry clasped the offered hands in his and let Draco pull him back to his feet. His new boots clomped across the castle lawn. The Gryffindor and the Slytherin walked hand in hand through the castle to the Great Hall doors. Harry shoved the door open, dragging Draco behind him to the Gryffindor table.
He scooped them up and carried them between the tables. The potion hissed when his professor added them into the hot liquid of the next cauldron, “My godson is dawdling, I’m sure. You might as well make yourself useful grinding some dried lavender.” He pointed out the mortar and pestle on the edge of the worktop. Harry nodded. He took special care to grind it down to a consistent, fine powder.
“It was good to see you again, Severus,” Harry said, the young man’s tanned face was flushed pink through his cheeks.
“I dunno, all of it, I guess. My parents weren’t around to tell me all the etiquette and tradition stuff that comes with lordships. Now I have two of them.” He showed Draco the rings on his finger. Draco nodded.
Harry slid into a little shop called the Em-Pour-ium through its bright blue door. A bell tinkled over his head to announce his entry. Glancing around, he took in the crystal chandelier that cast flecks of rainbow around the room. The rainbow lights flickered against the tea sets that lined the display shelves. A gentle smell of lavender wafted into Harry's nose. He reached forward to run his finger along the golden rim of one of the teacups, its shiny surface attracting the flecks of rainbow.
“You too seem quite close. How long have you been together?” Severus lifted one of the teacups off the shelf. He turned it round in his hand. Draco shook his head. Taking the teacup back, he placed it on one of the high shelves.
He yanked the glasses off and swiped them across his shirt to clear away most of the muck. When the inky mess was reduced to a dark film he could squint through, he yanked his wand out of his back pocket and cast a quick cleaning charm on the lenses. Blinking at the sudden change, he stared out at the stream of bubbles rising from the depths of the lake. Harry gripped his wand.
“I wouldn’t do something like that. I know everyone else isn’t convinced, but I don’t have a death wish.” He insisted.
Harry gulped. He slid back until his head cracked into the enchanted mirror. Draco hopped up out of his chair and dashed over to the potions master.
A faint smile forming on his lips, Draco crept around the side of the beanbag chair and dropped into his favorite armchair beside it. He took in his messy-haired Gryffindor, who curled around a battered copy of Quidditch Through the Ages at an angle that couldn't possibly be comfortable. The cuff of one of Draco's jumpers caught between Harry's lips. Shaking his head, Draco snagged Harry's wrist gently and tugged it away from his mouth. The muggle jumper had been a gift from Harry to him, and though he'd never admit it he snorted every time he saw the cartoon on it of a flexing muffin emblazoned with the words Stud Muffin.
“With any luck, it won’t come to that-”
Draco rolled his eyes. He took the second to tie up his dressing gown before approaching the stricken Gryffindor. Harry didn’t seem to realize that he wasn’t alone in the room anymore, he didn’t stop pounding on the wall until Draco spoke.
“Hush up Potter, and let’s get your homework done before Blaise shows up and wants to steal you away from me for an easy chess game.” A flush on his face, Draco busied himself with the textbook. But a faint smile still flickered on the corners of his lips as he pulled Harry even closer.
Harry jumped at the sudden intrusion. The Gryffindor’s usually unruly hair was wilder than normal from sleep, but Draco noted his eyes were glassy and red around the edges.
The temperature dropped further until Harry couldn’t stay still anymore. He untangled himself from Draco’s arm and paced back and forth on the pebble beach. Shoving his hands under his armpits, he stared out at the sun as it began its slow slink down beyond the trees. Grinning, Harry scrambled up onto one of the boulders to get a better view, “Careful, you’ve got enough scars without falling and cracking your head open.”
"Hem, hem," Harry's eyes snapped open. His hand jutted out, latching onto the hem of Draco's cloak. Frowning, Draco tried to yank his cloak back, but Harry's grip held firm. The clicking steps were getting closer. They were seconds from rounding the corner and seeing them. Potter quivered. His eyes wide behind the rims of his glasses.
Draco hadn’t mentioned that the dinner invitation was from Severus Snape. Harry tugged on the hem of his green sweater, the one that Draco insisted he wore because it brought out his eyes. He sat in the parlor next to Draco, waiting for their host to return with tea for them.
Draco peered at the messy writing in the low light of the fire, “Yes, you woke me up. So, I’m owed an explanation.” Nibbling on the edge of the quill, Harry put it back to the paper.
“If I didn’t want to, I wouldn’t have offered,” He pointed out. Glancing around, Harry realized that no one seemed to care he was in the common room of Slytherin house. It was as if he’d been a part of their house all along, “Besides, if you’re going to be Slytherin then we need to get you better at strategy. Don’t we?” Biting his lip, Harry nodded and sat back to watch Blaise’s first move.
Harry’s mouth fell open,
“Sorry for scaring you,” Harry whispered. His voice was hoarse from lack of use. Draco’s head snapped toward him. He covered his mouth, trying to smother the laugh building up from inside him.
Harry shrugged. That wasn’t exactly an agreement that he signed or anything. He mostly assumed it was Draco being dramatic, as usual, “Were you or were you not?” He repeated.
"I know it says muffin on it but you can't eat my jumper," He muttered. Draco dropped Harry's wrist in favor of stroking his hair. Harry shrugged. He closed the book, stowing it beneath the chair, "Shove over." He ordered gently. Grumbling, Harry complied. He let out a happy sigh when Draco's arms settled around him, "Couldn't sleep?" He asked. Harry nodded, his hair brushed against the underside of the Slytherin's chin, "You could've woken me up." The dark-haired boy shook his head, eyes far away.
“You’re glad now, just wait to see how much gladder you’ll be when I’m finished with your hair.” He ran his fingers through Harry’s hair for one last time, “Now’s the part where I need you to stay still for me.” Harry shut his eyes. He couldn’t see anything anyway. A comb flattened his wiry hair down around his cheeks and down on his neck. Cool metal brushed against his neck, making Harry want to jump out of his skin. But he stopped himself.
“Harry Potter, you’re being summoned to the door.” Harry’s brows furrowed. He stood up and crossed over to the opening, peering through the crack to see a flustered Draco Malfoy on the other side.
"Go ahead," He mumbled, detaching himself enough from Draco that the blond could slide off the rock. Biting his lip, Harry watched Draco approach the lapping water and chuck the shoe out into the waves. Tentacles shot out of the waves, snatching the trainer out of the air and dragging it down beneath the slightly inky surface of the water. Ink bloomed out in a dementor-like cloud. Harry slid off the rock and nestled beneath the crook of Draco's arm, "Can we go back inside now?" Draco nodded, ruffling the Gryffindor's hair.
Draco snorted, "And why in Merlin's name would I ever ask for that, Potter?" Harry shrugged, his green eyes dancing all the same. Nodding to Draco and the others, he strode out of the common room without a word. The blond pinched the bridge of his nose. Somehow without the war going on, Potter had become more disruptive and baffling.
“But Draco-” The name slipped out of Harry’s mouth before he realized what he was saying. The blond eyes flashed, a cheeky grin on his face.
“You could have tol-” Harry crossed his arms. Draco shook his head.
"Accio trainer," He cast in the direction of the bubbles. The water's placid surface roiled in streams of water. Tentacles flailed, but Harry's trainer did not return to his waiting grasp. Rubbing his temples beneath the frames of his glasses, Harry limped across the pebble beach and back toward the castle. He hoped Madam Malkins or Gladrags offered immediate owl orders from their catalogs. Otherwise, he was as sunk as his trainer until the shoes came in.
“I will ensure she is relinquished to the proper authorities. All of this needs to be cleaned up by the time I return,” He warned, before sweeping out of the room.
“We know we don’t have to, Potter. Much like the chess, we only do things if we want to and we want to keep you company.” He took another sip of the juice, “Eat your soup before you keel over,” he ordered, dismissing any more thoughts on the matter. Harry took a spoonful of soup, then another. He tore his roll apart and dunked the pieces into the bowl.
“But if it does?” Draco insisted, raising his voice as loud as he dared.
"Ours," He affirmed. The paper crinkled in Harry's fingers. It drifted to the floor forgotten. Harry whirled around in Draco's arms. He straddled the Slytherin's lap, pressing their lips together. His fingers tangled in Draco's silky hair. He tugged gently through the blond locks to hold Draco even closer. Breathlessly, they released each other and collapsed against each other's shoulders. Draco recovered first. He leaned down to snatch up the paper, tucking it into his dressing gown for safekeeping. A grin flashing across his face, he scooped Harry into his arms in a bridal hold. Harry buried his face into Draco's chest to muffle his surprised shriek. Soothed by the low rumbles of chuckles, he peeked back up at Draco in time to hear him mutter, "Let's get back to bed."
“It seems your partner is more reluctant to perform than I am. But if it makes you feel better, Harry I won’t be watching. The music will have my full attention.” He swept over to the piano and took his place on the bench. Draco peeled the teacup out of Harry’s hands and tugged him up out of his seat to a clear spot on the floor. He clasped one of Harry’s hands, stretching them out away from the. The other arms crooked against each other on the other side.
