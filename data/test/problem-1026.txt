They had barely finished eating when Harriet crawled on top of Draco’s lap. Between the look in her eyes and the thick, sweet scent that continued to pour from her glands, Draco helplessly surrendered to his omega’s demanding needs.
A brand new body with a brand new set of eyes and lungs as the mouth opened and that brand new body gave an irritated cry……….
Draco instantly pulled back. His grey eyes were narrowed in rage as he hissed, “Damn it, Potter! Why are you being so obstinate?!”
Harriet’s bright green eyes flickered open and she pulled back to stare into Draco’s grey orbs as he repeated, “I’m in love with you………….I have been for some time now. I’m not entirely sure when it started, but I am confident that it will never end.”
Whether their baby had already arrived or not, Draco would certainly not be attending the next Malfoy board meeting.
As they sat on the bench next to each other, Draco looked over at Harriet with a frown as she wiped the tears away from her eyes, staring straight ahead.
Harriet and Draco often mused about what great, even if only unintentional, things their son had already done.
Draco expected Harriet to say something sarcastic but instead, she stretched to press her lips against his in a sweet, loving kiss. Draco wanted to pull back and force his omega to talk, to draw words out of her, to get her to express her emotions and feelings verbally, but Harriet’s kisses were dangerously addictive to Draco.
Draco came face to face with a smiling muggle man, whom, he had to admit, besides his clothing, didn’t look all that different from a wizard.
He offered no reply but as soon as they stepped out of the shower, he dried them both off and covered Harriet’s throat and collarbone in gentle, loving kisses.
“Of course, sweetheart.” Harriet replied, looking down over her heavy belly as best she could to smile at Scorpius.
Draco grit his teeth as a dastardly smirk curled his lips and he contented himself by replaying in his mind the spitefulness the receptionist had shown him.
Harriet had spent most of the duration of Draco and Ron’s conversation explaining to Hermione what had happened and the true, disturbing details of her alpha’s new behaviors.
While the house elves began to scurry in with refreshments for the small, afternoon party, Draco intertwined his fingers with the ones on Harriet’s free hand and whispered, “I know you’ll refuse and I respect that, but I just want you to understand how madly proud I am that you’re mine, Potter~. If it was up to me, we’d have a wedding. A proper, grand wedding.”
By the time that Scorpius was two months old, it would have been a surprise for anyone who met Draco and Harriet to discover the two of them weren’t married.
“Scorpius was already far too old for you to pass him off as a wedding night souvenir when I proposed to Potter.” Draco retorted, “The baby had to come from somewhere, Father, would you rather I have told a lie and claim that I adopted him? A child that looks just like a Malfoy? What sense would that make to anyone?”
One afternoon, while Harriet and Narcissa were walking through the Malfoy gardens, showing Scorpius all of the lovely plants and flowers, Draco was inside the manor, hatching a plan which Harriet knew nothing about.
It felt good to Harriet to wake up without a fever or bleeding or hurting or the uncontrollable desire to have Draco inside her.
“You heard me, Potter.” Draco replied as he looked at Harriet with profound sincerity, “Run away with me.”
Considering where they had stood with each other less than a month ago, Draco would take what he could get.
That surely must have been how things had always been, all of the past and all of the real world…….that was only an ugly dream.
Harriet watched while Draco pressed his cheek against her abdomen and her smile turned into a smirk when Draco stilled.
His heart pounded with the terror that Harriet would reject him yet again as he held her close and kissed her lips, whispering, “We’re a family now~. Don’t fight me, you know it’s true.”
Draco had faced the destruction of his family before, but he had battled against it in his own way, if only through a private, internal struggle.
Draco leaned forward and stuffed his blonde head into the center of Harriet’s cleavage to press a gentle kiss there, causing his omega to whimper at the contact.
After dropping his bombshells on his unsuspecting parents, Draco quickly left the lavish Malfoy dining room with a tortured sigh.
“I suppose you liked making your mother and I wait.” Harry shrugged as he quickly made some pancakes.
When she walked into the bedroom and saw Draco lying on the bed, naked, with one arm carelessly behind his head and the letter over the part of him that Harriet liked best, she rolled her eyes.
Not that that was a legitimate concern, as the new family was safely tucked away within the confines of Malfoy manor, but as a protective alpha and a brand new father, Draco’s instincts were running nearly as on edge as Harriet’s.
When Draco rolled them both over and took control of his mate, the cries of Harriet’s bliss echoed from his room and carried down the halls of Malfoy manor.
A wide smile formed on Draco’s face and it wasn’t clear if it was from the way that Harriet settled against him again as if it were the most natural thing in life or from the way that she didn’t say anything in protest when he called her “love”, though it was obvious that she had heard him.
When Harriet stubbornly refused to speak, Draco straightened up and let his manhood proudly protrude from his hips as he reached forward and began to knead her sensitive breasts, intent on teasing her about what she could have if she just let go of her pride.
In the awkward, nearly unbearable silence that followed, punctuated after a moment by hushed whisperings of disbelief, Draco released Harriet and stepped back.
Without a second thought, Draco carefully scooped the pregnant omega into his arms and apparated them both out of her apartment and straight to Malfoy manor.
The tailor had often wondered just how many black pieces of clothing the Malfoys really needed to buy, but he said nothing for fear of losing his best patrons.
Harriet watched apprehensively as Draco withdrew his wand and raised it towards her, “Since it’s only bloating, then I suppose I’ll stupefy you so we can finally have a little chat.”
A small amount of her appetite gradually returned on its own. Draco breathed a sigh of relief when Harriet started to eat more than the bare minimum of what was necessary to survive.
“What do you mean not quite as-!” Draco was in mid sentence when the muggle elevator shifted underneath their feet and lifted the couple to the fourth floor.
Once the girls and the elves had left the room, Draco looked down at Harriet and offered her his hand.
As she watched Draco, and admired how utterly fascinated he was by the promise of the family that they may finally get a chance to have, Harriet was elated that she had made her alpha so happy.
She took a deep breath and pushed her instincts aside. Using a great display of willpower, Harriet decided that she would address her alpha rationally about each of her concerns.
Harriet blinked at the way he grabbed her hand and squeezed it very tightly, as if he were trying to apologize to her.
Despite Harriet’s outward resistance, Draco saw the subtle flush that graced her cheeks as she thought about the passionate moment they had just shared.
Once she was satisfied with her meal, the subtle groan of relief that echoed from Harriet’s throat caused Draco to smirk in triumph.
Draco didn’t remember the contractions being quite so….bad….with Scorpius at first…….but it had been nearly three years.
With a few flicks of his wand, Harry cleaned the floor, vanished Draco’s nightdress and panties, assembled some supplies, and sanitized his hands.
Draco tenderly cradled Harriet’s belly as she cupped his handsome face. Daringly, he deepened their kiss, groaning against her when she welcomed him readily by parting her lips, allowing his tongue to explore her mouth.
Harriet had heard from Hermione that there was a popular muggle trend which she was eager to participate in for her husband’s benefit.
Harriet’s dress was dreamy and elegant, the ivory fabric was a striking contrast against her vividly green eyes and her rich, dark hair, which Hermione had skillfully managed to tame into a sophisticated chignon.
“No, it’s not, it’s the baby’s! Stop being so loud, I can’t hear it as well.” Draco replied with a scowl.
Harriet sniffled and wiped her face with her hand while she continued her attempt to collect herself.
With a frown of irritation,Draco crawled overtop of her and let his ear continue to hover against the area underneath her navel.
Draco looked up at her and blinked, “I wasn’t kissing you, Potter. Why do I need your permission to kiss my child?”
As soon as Harriet arrived in Draco’s office, her eyes widened when she found her alpha, clutching himself in one hand and her picture in the other.
“Hey!” Draco called, his smirk turning into a scowl as he watched the omega he had pursued for months attempt to escape, “Where do you think you’re going?!?”
Those other omegas…...the ones that said pregnancy could be difficult…...they were just being dramatic, right?
She quickly laid down a galleon on the table to pay for her drink and stood from her seat, “Goodbye, Malfoy.”
Since they had started their classes, Draco was often up late pouring over the plethora of pamphlets and educational booklets they had received.
Draco’s neglected manhood strained against his trousers, but he had no interest in watching his omega serve him…..,,he wasn’t finished with her yet.
“What are you talking about? ‘A solution?’” Draco asked suspiciously, narrowing his eyes at the omega across from him.
“Oh, yes. H-How are you?” Harriet said dismissively. As she held the phone, she stumbled while blackness edged at the corners of her vision.
As irritating as it was to Harriet to be gawked at while she was trying to get ready for the day, a part of her was proud that she held Draco’s attention so satisfyingly well.
A flick of Draco’s wand was all that it took to transport them out of their bedroom and into the rest of their lives.
While Harriet finished up in the bathroom, Draco quickly shed his clothes and positioned himself in the bed for his wife.
Every night, Harriet slept cuddled against Draco’s chest. He smiled each morning when he woke with her still laying carelessly against him, trusting him to keep her safe from whatever threat may come.
Dobby yelped and grabbed Scorpius by the hand before he darted down the hallway with the little boy, hurrying to take him outside and play just as Harry Potter had requested.
Once Draco pulled away from Harriet’s nipples, he covered her head to toe in a barrage of possessive, nipping kisses as he pried her nightdress and panties off despite her previous shyness.
Once the decorations were up and the throngs of guests started to arrive, Harriet stayed safely hidden away in the secluded part of the manor where she had spent the night.
While the reporters stood and blinked in confusion, Draco collected the parchments they had scribbled on and threw them into the flames that were cradled by the heavy, stone fireplace at the front of the room.
Harriet felt a pang in her heart as she clutched Scorpius and looked at Draco nervously, “You…….you don’t want to…..marry me…..anymore?”
Draco’s grey eyes were uncharacteristically soft as he added, “Malfoy manor is safe and secluded. Don’t go back to that dingy little flat of yours, Potter. Stay here and let me take care of you two. I can hire as much staff as we need. I guarantee, you’ll want for nothing. It’s really not bad, you know, living like a Malfoy.”
Harriet had no one like that and since she had hidden her pregnancy, she couldn’t even turn to Molly Weasley.
It was mostly quiet at first. Harriet dozed on and off while Draco held her. If he saw her wince with pain, he kissed her cheek and cooed gentle words of encouragement to her while his hands gently rubbed her quivering belly.
“Not yet.” The midwife said as she turned Harriet onto her side and began to soothingly knead her patient’s back, “If you would though, Mr. Malfoy, please light a candle or two that holds her favorite scent…...and make sure the dawn doesn’t disturb her when the sun rises, mothers labor easier in comfortable, dimly-lit environments.”
“I don’t think any of my own friends will know how to please Harriet Potter.” Draco retorted, “My parents are no help on the matter, their marriage was arranged. The closest thing Potter has to any family is……”
The enamored alpha barely paused to toss the piece of ebony in his hand onto one of the side tables in the room before he was standing beside Harriet.
Whenever Draco saw his wife yawn in the afternoon, he would place her back in her nest and cuddle with her until she was snoring quietly against him.
“......Yes.” Mr. Roberts admitted with a heavy sigh, “Yes, I’d do the same…...Has your lawyer received the results of your paternity test, Mr. Smith?”
She grinned when she saw Draco waiting on her, already changed into his dapper, new suit but he didn’t return her smile as he gazed back.
“Good.” Harry said with a chuckle of approval. His fingertips began to trace over her swollen womb as he went on, “Two days overdue, it’s about time…..When did it start, love? Do we need to go ahead and-“
“.............Congratulations.” Draco muttered under his breath to Ron as he watched the alpha that he furiously envied sit the tea serving tray down on the table in front of the sofa.
The blonde alpha sat down on the sofa with such gentle poise that Harriet genuinely thought he was frightened of launching her and the baby into the air.
Harriet thought it felt lovely after so many years of loneliness and sadness, to lie there with her alpha, no matter who he was, to be held close by someone who loved her, someone she loved. It felt so lovely in fact, that Harriet could scarcely believe it was real as she listened to Draco’s steady heartbeat.
A small trickle of gold in the blazing sunlight, it was down so low that it was nearly skimming across the ground.
“Would you two like to add any initials? Monogramming is an option.” A friendly clerk asked as he brushed by the pair.
The winter after Harriet Potter changed her name to Harriet Malfoy, an adorable, blonde, baby girl was born to her and Draco.
He kept smiling at Harriet in a way she found annoying and he continued to berate her each time she woke, went to work, or came home with superfluous questions about her health.
As Draco gazed at Harriet holding the Weasleys’ daughter on their sofa, his heart started to race and his grey orbs widened.
Wedding receptions are more often about the guests than the couple and as Harriet and Draco made their rounds greeting and mingling with everyone, they discovered that to be true.
“Of course.” Narcissa nodded to her son, “We’re in no rush, darling, let her have her rest. I spent a lot of time napping when I carried you.”
The couple may have had their opinions asked on a few minor details, but the true mechanics of the operation were being dictated by Lucius, Narcissa, and the worst of everything……..tradition.
Another contraction threatened to start and Draco feared she would perish with its intensity. She was safe in her home, in her room, with her husband, a skilled, adept healer who loved her but for some reason, Draco was confined by absolute terror.
She led Draco to the bungalow at the very end of the wooden pier, and when they stood in front of the door, she slid the silver key into the doorknob.
The delight in her eyes was evident as she counted their newborn’s tiny eyelashes while he clutched her breast and enjoyed the leftover richness of his mother’s meal.
The rocking chair creaked gently as it swayed back and forth while Draco sat in it, holding his son in his strong arms. The fire crackled at the other end of the room.
True to her word, the next day, the owls began to arrive at Malfoy manor with letters from Hermione.
Narcissa looked over at her husband and said very seriously, “You’ll do well to remember that now, my love. I don’t care about the war. I don’t care about rival families. I care about my family, my husband, my son, and the grandchild that my son’s omega is soon to give birth to. You’ve gone around the bend if you think I won’t be there waiting to hold that baby the moment they come into this world.”
“You really love her, don’t you?” Ron asked Draco in a much gentler tone than he had used moments ago.
The contractions for the afterbirth were more prominent than Harriet expected and she groaned as she pushed her shoulders back against the pillow.
“No, Draco! I’m expected to be at work by eight, I can’t sit around all morning waiting on hypothetical situations that may never be.” Harriet scowled as she stood from the bed, despite Draco reaching a hand out to stop her, and began to rush around while she readied for her day.
While she stood in the deserted bathroom, Harriet pulled the pouch that held her medication out of her pocket, and looked in the mirror at herself.
“Take me to see my wife immediately or I’m going to barge into every room until I find her myself!” Draco spat furiously. His face was red from rage.
Draco drew in a breath and looked down at Harriet, who gave him a shrug, and settled back as Dr. Krause discreetly pulled the omega’s shirt up to expose her belly.
As the baby inside Harriet squirmed about, Draco’s eyes closely followed the movement. Harriet laughed when she realized that in that moment, Draco may well have forgotten that she and everyone else in the world existed.
When she looked over and saw the scowl on Draco’s face, Harriet crossed her arms and asked, “What was I supposed to say, Draco? After they risked their lives for me, multiple times? Tell them ‘no’? ‘Thanks for everything you’ve gone through and given up for me, but my husband and I can’t lol after your little girl for three days’?”
He pulled the covers up over himself but his eyes didn’t close. He was too busy thinking about Harriet and his baby to sleep.
“I’ve got you, Potter, I’ve got you.” Draco whispered soothingly to her as he pulled her dark hair away from her face and held her steady over the toilet.
Despite Draco’s valiant attempts at protecting his mate and pup, Harriet hadn’t looked after herself and the baby properly.
They had been growing closer and closer to one another, or at least, he thought they had. Surely that wouldn’t all be thrown out the window as soon as the baby was born?
Draco silently decided that the first and easiest step would be to get Harriet safely out of the press’s way.
Draco Malfoy woke alone in his grand, canopied bed. A year after the conclusion of the war, his mother and father had managed to pay off the rest of their Azkaban sentences with money instead of time and the Malfoy family had recently been reunited.
Regardless, if healer Marigold wouldn’t allow Draco to remain with Harriet during a simple examination, she probably wasn’t going to allow him to remain with Harriet during the birth either.
Harriet opened her green eyes and whined when she saw Hermione clutching her close instead of her mate. As comforting as the sight of her best friend was, in her current state, Harriet wanted her alpha.
Lucius stood and gazed at his wife for a moment, watching the fire of determination that burned in her icy blue eyes. Over two decades had gone by since their marriage but Narcissa hadn’t dulled a bit over the years, not her beauty, not her flame.
Harriet was still too emotional to reply but she nodded curtly against his chest and Draco kissed her head a second time.
Draco woke later in the morning to the demanding sound of someone loudly knocking on the front door.
At first Harriet thought that Draco had been mocking her, but when she saw the way he stood leering at her hungrily, she realized the true sentiment behind his comment.
“I don’t remember uttering lies, Potter.” Draco shrugged haughtily as he began to eat his ganache cake with a glistening, silver spoon.
The muggle doctor returned a few moments later and presented the couple with the first hazy images of their little one. Harriet looked over them with a soft smile but Draco stared at the pictures in genuine amazement.
“There are, Father! I saw them with my own eyes!” Scorpius insisted as his grey stare bore into Draco’s.
“It’s not Harriet’s fault. It can take some time, Malfoy.” Ron replied, “You being so mental about it isn’t helping.”
Draco was happy to lend Harriet his shirts, ties, jackets, and anything else she wanted to include. He watched his mate work so feverishly at constructing a place she felt safe and comfortable in that he decided to help.
He almost felt like she was testing to see whether he was really serious about his endeavor or not by asking him that question.
Of course Draco still wanted to marry Harriet, he just wanted to do it on his own terms, not the rest of the world’s, and certainly not his parents’.
In the wizarding world, preparing for a new baby was somewhat more basic than it was in the muggle world. For children from magical families, most cradles were either heirlooms or designed by a hired woodcarver and most infant clothing was ordered from a tailor or handmade.
He flipped them both over with a smirk and crawled on top of Harriet as he whispered, “Excellent, Potter~. I’ll make the arrangements right away~.”
When their lips barely met, a loud, intrusive growl erupted from the pit of Harriet’s belly and Draco pulled away.
That was one of the many reasons that Harriet adored her alpha as much as she did, Draco Malfoy may have been a prat during his Hogwarts days, but he had matured into a loving husband and an attentive father.
Draco looked at Harriet, staring at her with his handsome, grey eyes as she cleared her throat, “Well, I mean, yeah, technically we did…….er, you know…….but we’re not…um, together.”
Harriet was very happy that she was still nursing Scorpius because she was fairly certain that if her little one had already weaned, entire days would pass where she wouldn’t even have the opportunity to see her baby.
Harriet had allowed Hermione to help her with her research, so she knew the direction in which she needed to walk.
Harriet could feel Draco’s heart thumping in his chest behind her as he watched the muggle doctors reach inside the woman and pulled around on her insides like they were gutting a fish.
As the class waited for their teacher to finish preparing the video, Draco’s hands snaked up to Harriet’s belly and splayed lovingly over the bump that seemed to grow everyday.
Without any complications from her pregnancy or the delivery, without the burden of any financial worries, Harriet was free to enjoy the newborn phase of her baby’s life with her husband loyally and lovingly at her side.
Harriet calmly walked up to the reception desk with Draco and spoke to the woman sitting at a computer, which Draco stared at curiously.
To tease her further though, Draco pulled back from their kiss and whispered against her lips, “Don’t you want to be here with me, my darling~?”
If she woke in the night and attempted to reposition herself, he was awake too, ready to do whatever she needed.
Harriet was nervous, she had never actually been through a heat, and as her warning symptoms increased while Draco was still away, she hoped she wouldn’t have to endure her first one alone.
Both Harriet and Scorpius got weekly check ups, even though their reports came back flawless after every exam.
Profits had dwindled since the war. It turned out that supporting a failed fascist movement which promoted racism and endorsed genocide was unpopular with many customers in the wizarding world.
Although Draco had stayed home with Harriet for the entire duration of her pregnancy, once a month, he did have to attend Malfoy company board meetings with his father, Lucius.
“My only wish is to take care of her, Weasley, and my son, that should go without saying. You don’t have to worry about me staying with Potter. My soul is bonded to hers, now and forever.” Draco answered in a far away voice.
She had been back to the toilet twice before she was able to swallow the potion but Draco had stayed beside her the entire time.
When Draco lost his battle against his own fatigue, he and Harriet slept side by side through the night, cuddled together.
Lucius Malfoy was a large shareholder in one of St. Mungo’s biggest partner hospitals, on the other side of wizarding Britain.
On top of bonding with each other and raising their baby, they had a very large and very magnificent wedding to put together.
In her misery of heated cramps and empty want, Harriet tried to focus on just how pleased Draco was going to be when he walked through the door and found her in such a state……...
Lucius narrowed his eyes but Narcissa frowned, immediately concerned for her dear boy, “What’s the matter, Draco?”
Lucius sniffed and rolled back over in bed to continue reading the book in his hands, “Only muggles would attempt something like that. What if that’s harmful to the child?”
The light of the new day was already streaming through the heavy curtains that covered Draco’s windows. Instead of rolling over to see for himself, he stretched a hand out and let it fall through the void of empty air beside him.
Draco was more than glad to assist whenever and wherever with Scorpius’s care and his desire to help extended far beyond changing and burping his small son.
The next morning came and Draco blinked at the ray of sunlight that spilled into the room through the slit in his damask curtains.
“Come on, then.” Draco said, walking with one hand on Harriet’s lower back for support, “We’ve had a busy morning. I think you two could use a nap.”
Draco was busy showing off his skills by leisurely helping the Slytherin chasers knock the quaffle past Gryffindor’s keeper, but Harriet ignored him and focused on her task.
To her delight, Oliver Wood had come back as the team captain, George Weasley was a beater once more, and Katie Bell had also returned to her position as a chaser.
Any unfortunate employee who crossed paths with Draco would be trapped listening to an update of how baby Scorpius was doing and viewing photographs of the infant for a minimum of twenty minutes.
Harriet whimpered from where she lay and gently spread her knees as best she could, hoping her alpha would take the hint.
Draco pulled out his wand, gave it a flick, and a moment later, the black velvet ring box that had been in his jacket pocket the night of his failed attempt floated straight into his hand.
Draco was surprised when he quickly followed his love into unconsciousness, cradling her on his shoulder while they both dozed in the warm light of the afternoon.
He wrapped his strong arms around her and as she laid her head on his firm chest, he covered them both with the soft layers of her nest to guard against the early morning chill.
Harriet didn’t say anything. She didn’t want a confrontation, she didn’t want to explain, and she certainly didn’t want Draco to find out about…..
A shadow of sadness crossed Draco’s face though he tried to hide it with a sneer, “So you just weren’t going to tell me at all, Potter? I’d have a son or daughter walking through the world and just never know?”
Harriet……..through the many, moving bodies dressed in white, shouting orders back and forth, Draco caught a glimpse of his unconscious mate lying limp on the hospital bed like a defeated rag doll.
Harriet and her handsome alpha delighted in the greatest joy that either of them had ever known……..the joy of love.
Those sweet, whispered sentiments were the first sounds that Harriet heard as her green eyes slowly fluttered open.
Scorpius snuffled quietly as he laid a tiny hand against Harriet’s breast and she let her head roll towards Draco, exposing her bare throat while she whispered, “I tried not to wake you.”
Harriet was mortifyingly speechless as Draco moved his hand to open the black, velvet ring box while he formally stated his question at last, “Harriet Potter……….will you marry me?”
“What on earth were you thinking, Malfoy?!” Draco heard his wife’s angry voice demand. Despite her rage, Draco could tell from her tone that she was filled with frightened worry, “You could have been killed!”
You can keep sending letters if you like, but Potter’s soon to give birth. I can scarcely keep her awake long enough to eat anything, let alone sit down and pen a response. My child is scheduled to arrive within the week. Once she’s holding the baby in her arms instead of her belly, I expect you’ll be receiving a reply from her soon.
It annoyed Draco to think that he and Harriet were going to have to find another healthcare provider to welcome their child.
Draco couldn’t feel Harriet’s skin under his hands and she couldn’t fully feel his touch through the fabric.
Draco didn’t see his wife until he stood facing her as both the Slytherin and Gryfinndor alumni teams waited for the game to begin.
She let go of Harry in a rush as she widened her knees. Her hands gripped her thighs and she stared at Harry, a tear dripping down her cheek as she roared, “I HAVE TO PUSH!”
The midwife was completely calm as she replied to her pregnant patient while she continued her soothing rubbing, “Relax, love, it’s normal to feel some pressure as the baby moves down. Mr. Malfoy,” The midwife said, glancing behind Harriet, “I think we need to go ahead and move to the-“
The midwife smiled at the couple while she prepared to examine Harriet, amused by how soft Draco’s grey eyes were as he gazed down at his wife and lovingly stroked her hair.
“Daddy, what’s wrong with mummy?” Scorpius asked from the doorway, frowning at the upsetting scene in front of him.
Harriet pretended not to hear him as she attempted to finally finish making herself decent enough for an outing.
“This is going to stop today, do you hear me?” Draco asked as he scowled down at Harriet while she laid against him.
Draco worriedly stayed close by his omega at all times, even when she visited the bathroom, he was never more than a short distance away from the closed door.
Draco couldn’t wait to be involved with the pregnancy and his baby and Harriet’s care….....but he learned an important lesson that afternoon.
Harriet wouldn’t make eye contact with Draco, fearing what would happen between them if she gazed into his frosty, gray gaze that she knew was surely heated with lust.
There was nothing wrong with Draco, but faking a sour stomach was the best excuse he could come up with to go and deal with the chaos his parents had caused.
“Why?” Harriet asked a moment later when she walked back out into the bedroom. She held her chosen clothes for the day in her hands as she breathed, “It’s fitting…...we didn’t have any cake last night.”
She had thought it was never going to happen or perhaps she had gotten the days mixed up, but it had happened, at last, it happened!
Draco tried to focus on holding his tortured expression and not slipping into a smirk that celebrated the cleverness of using a pseudonym.
Draco looked up at the healer with a scowl so serious you would have thought he was facing his own executioner.
A few saw Harriet as a traitor and vice versa, but fascination overruled ill feelings among the masses for the most part.
“Well, I’m not certain what you intend to find for a baby in Diagon Alley or Hogsmeade.” Harriet shrugged, “I didn’t know any of the merchants there sold nappies.”
“You’ve had complications!” Draco exclaimed in exasperation as he looked down at his wife and threw up his hands.
After hours of traipsing through the streets, in and out of shops, Draco and Harriet had succeeded in gathering nearly everything that any baby could possibly need.
She was certain it would be over after a moment but to her horror, she gagged and gagged and gagged……...
Harriet and Draco hadn’t bothered to explain enough of their personal lives to make any real, discernible sense.
Harriet glanced up at him angrily with the front buttons on her dress open, revealing an obscene amount of cleavage as she met his gaze.
Although Draco was certain the craftsmanship would be better in the wizarding world, he was content to humor Harriet’s wishes.
“Why do you even want to take those classes anyway?” Harriet fumed at Draco later that night while they readied for bed, “You know they’re muggle classes, right?”
“I thought that perhaps, we could have our family portrait made.....to place it on the wall next to mine when I was born….....maybe we could even…...announce…..us?” Draco asked shyly as his hands kneaded Harriet’s sides.
While Ron and Hermione had Harriet cornered, Draco appeared with a pop in the bathroom of the gelato shop. He flushed the toilet, and turned on the water to pretend he had finished what business Harriet thought he had excused himself to take care of.
“You two aren’t supposed to be here!” Harriet snapped at her friends. She felt like a criminal who had been caught in the middle of an offense as Ron and Hermione stared at her in the gelato shop.
“That’s because the father didn’t know.” Draco spat. To Draco’s dismay, his tone sounded more ominous than he intended.
Draco didn’t bother saying anything else to the healer or nodding to the loyal secretary from the Auror department that he had shared the bench with as he leapt from his seat and charged into Harriet’s room.
“Money isn’t…….” Mr. Roberts began, clearly distraught by Draco’s plea, “Money isn’t the object, Mr. Smith. My wife and I have been on the list to adopt a third child for years…..This is the first time we’ve been chosen by a birth mother and we’re quite proud.”
Draco sat up on the mat and opened his arms to Harriet. He placed one of the practice pillows against his chest and opened his legs to allow Harriet to snuggle against him, which she did with a reluctant huff.
Thank you for reading! I don’t own any of Harry Potter! Please let me know if you enjoy! Updates every Saturday!
“Sorry, can you give me just a moment?” Draco said hurriedly to the man at the counter, as Harriet stepped forward to the register and nearly threw her galleons at the clerk.
Gasping in shock, his hand shot out and Harriet whimpered as the alpha who fathered her child placed his hands on her rounded abdomen.
In those pictures, Harriet was posed and pouting, smiling and holding her belly, lying back with her creamy thighs exposed, looking right at the camera with her thick, effortlessly tousled hair, calling Draco to reach through the picture and touch her.
Harriet stripped herself and crawled inside her comfortable nest that she had made that smelled like Draco.
Harriet’s closed eyelids fluttered and her kiss eventually slowed until Draco pulled away and gently pecked her forehead as he whispered, “Rest, love.”
In response, Draco smirked down at his son, which caused a wide grin to break out across Scorpius’s tiny, pale face.
Harriet watched him press the wooden tip into their clasped hands as he swallowed, “After today, you’ll never say that again.”
Draco looked at her with his brow furrowed and something in his expression made Harriet force back the tears that threatened to gather in her eyes, choosing to squeeze his hands instead.
Lucius walked back over and sat down at his desk again as he remarked, “Name him and he’ll be a Malfoy.”
As Draco walked into the bedroom and shut the door behind himself that evening, Harriet sat in bed and cuddled Scorpius, who slept in her arms.
Harriet laughed and went on, “It’s not certain that it will or won’t happen during a heat or not, heats just make it more likely. We’re still young, Draco, we have plenty of time.”
Immediately, Lucius and Narcissa looked over at their son, frowning when they saw that he was alone.
Draco was hip deep in Harriet as he kissed his needy mate and set a pounding pace that caused her to cry out in ecstasy.
If she seemed sad or frightened, he’d pull her close and stroke her hair while he whispered pleasant reassurances to her.
For the next seven days, Harriet laid blissfully in her alpha’s arms while she lounged about in his care.
With a few waves of his wand afterwards, the photographer presented the finished pictures to the Malfoys.
“Sorry, love.” Draco apologized when Harriet turned to take the trousers from his hands when she had a place ready to put them.
Draco didn’t say anything else but Harriet grinned when she glanced over at him and saw him wrinkle his nose in horror as he considered the graphic reality of what she had told him.
Draco’s grey eyes narrowed for a second and then they widened as he realized what his little omega was going after.
There, meters away in the dining room, sat his pompous parents in their finest clothes. The table was prepared for a grand feast. All around the room, journalists stood scribbling on their parchments, with their cameras lined up like prying knights, ready to hack through all of the progress Draco had made at winning Harriet’s love.
With a humorless chuckle of exasperation, he answered, “...........What happened between us…..where we go from there….here….?”
Draco scowled at his mate as she sat the letter back down where she had found it and crawled into bed.
Harriet’s two best friends were already prepared, Ron in his navy suit, and Hermione in her demure, blue dress, while they both attempted to help the bride-to-be get ready for the day.
Draco was growing frustrated at his omega’s apparent determination to ruin all of the surprises for the night as he huffed and sighed, “Potter……”
“I’m sorry……...I honestly didn’t mean to make it any more difficult. Can you forgive me?” Draco asked as he kissed the top of Harriet’s head.
She let her nails drag across his back and arched her hips up towards him but he didn’t even notice as the sensation of their lovemaking blinded him.
Harriet had agreed to start a family with him and of course, at some point, that would mean that she would take some time away from work.
It wasn’t something that Draco was used to seeing, female bonding, but as he watched his mother slide her hands over Harriet’s swollen belly, it was something that he was very glad was happening.
“Could have at least brought the little tyke along.” Ron said with a frown, “I haven’t even gotten to meet him yet.”
Draco sadly pulled back for a moment and tried to remind himself to stay on task, “People are already wondering...as Scorpius grows, they’re going to wonder more.”
Harriet had nearly forgotten her name after Draco had spent an hour with his face buried between her thighs one afternoon, licking and nipping at her heated center.
His breath was as labored as Harriet’s as he made sure the curtains stayed closed before he fetched her favorite lavender candles.
Harriet looked over at him with a glare but Draco just laughed as he grinned and said, “I love you, Potter.”
Draco eagerly nuzzled against the pulse points at the base of Harriet’s neck and closed his eyes to inhale and enjoy that intoxicatingly sweet scent.
Had he really been willing to sacrifice himself for his own ambition? Was Draco that desperate to fulfill his wish to have a child?
Staggering to her feet in a panting, sweating, shamefully disheveled heap, Draco leaned against the window and pressed her face against the cool glass as her insides twisted without her consent.
Draco looked at Harriet for a moment and she cleared her throat before she asked hesitantly, “Would……..would you like to come with me?”
Instead of carrying their purchases around with them, Draco arranged to have their newly bought wares delivered to an address that several prominent wizarding families used for such purposes, with the intent of sparing their homes from discovery.
In that photograph, Harriet was kneeling with her hands on the floor behind herself and her rounded womb on full display. The only scrap of clothing visible on the omega in that shot was a gossamer whisper of lace the photographer had fluffed across her breasts to hide her nipples, but Draco could see their dark tips if he squinted.
“Good morning, Potter.” Draco replied, although his gaze hovered protectively between Harriet and the baby, “I didn’t even hear him cry this time, why didn’t you wake me?”
Loading a basket full of the candies, Harriet was standing in line at the register when Draco happened to glance across the room from where he was paying for Narcissa’s order at the opposite counter.
Event if Draco obliviated the muggle family and made his escape, there would be others coming after him and his son or daughter due to the intricate complications that Harriet had set in place.
Draco didn’t want to crowd her, but he couldn't resist the urge to kiss her cheek in appreciation  as he watched her guide their baby to latch onto one of her fattened nipples.
He held Harriet in his arms and stroked her back with his fingertips until he felt her muscles ease while she laid against him.
While Harry tended Draco and assisted with the cord and the placenta, Draco smiled wryly as she guided her little daughter to one of her plump nipples.
Draco was cut off by the most heart-wrenching cry he had ever heard. It was primal and deep and it made him tremble in mortal terror for his lover as she nearly convulsed with the pain that came far again far too quickly for his liking.
That same day, Harriet woke up with an awful craving for chocolate frogs. Unable to ignore her urges, the omega put on her dark, flowing robes to disguise her new figure and apparated straight there.
“Harriet Potter, hello.” Narcissa said with a polite nod, “I haven’t seen you in-......in quite some time.” Narcissa finished with an awkward smile, not wanting to bring up the war.
“The pains are nowhere near close, Mr. Malfoy. If your wife wants to labor here for a while, I don’t see the harm.” The midwife said a half an hour later as Harriet squeezed Draco’s hand and fought her way through another pain after the woman finished examining her.
They entered the street from a non-conspicuous alley and side by side, they walked down the street, masquerading as an ordinary muggle couple.
Draco knew he should probably ignore the temptation, but he chose to allow himself a small indulgence.
“I had trouble getting you out of the nest with the girls, too. Perhaps it’s twins again!” Draco mused as he pushed the covers of the way so Harriet could have room to stand up. As he did, his grey eyes hovered reverently over her swollen belly.
“It’s alright, it’s alright, love. I’m here, I’m right here.” Harry said, chuckling as he kissed Draco’s cheek reassuringly, “Ready to go, darling?”
Harriet picked up her toothbrush and placed some toothpaste on the bristles while Draco slept on in the other room.
Draco didn’t know how long he and the Auror secretary sat on that bench beside each other in a tense silence.
Draco drew in a shuddering breath of uncertainty as Harriet climbed into the chair with him and settled herself as best she could in his lap.
Although Draco remained unmarried, it was clearly evident that he would soon no longer be the youngest Malfoy. Although the obvious implications of the situation seemed to be of no consequence to Healer Marigold.
Harriet turned around and saw Draco shuffle into the room with his Slytherin green bathrobe wrapped tightly around himself to ward off the morning chill.
The bed was a mess, Harriet had pulled his clothes and blankets and a few other soft things to make it into…….to make it into……
Draco and Harriet both looked at Narcissa silently as she shook her head and replied, “Thank goodness that you have your father and I to help you, this entire event would be a total disaster otherwise. Now hurry up! You’ve got a lovely breakfast of cake being cut as we speak.”
Harriet hadn’t thought it was possible, but the sudden wave of illness she had been struck by was ruthless.
Harriet gained back the weight she had lost but it was the change in her scent once she was nearly twelve weeks along that really commanded her alpha’s attention.
She saw herself after the war when she found out about the baby, showing the test results to Draco, which caused him to embrace her warmly in a show of his gladness.
Instead of frowning or protesting, Harriet’s smile brightened at Draco’s statement and he smiled widely in return.
Harriet opened her eyes when she felt his ministrations halt. She blinked as she saw their instructor standing close beside them.
“Good morning, Dobby.” Harry nodded to the house elf as he sat Scorpius down at the table, “I’m going to make a bit of breakfast and then we’ll be out of your way.”
The Malfoys thought that a small column would be printed in the paper to announce Draco and Harriet’s engagement and relationship.
Draco left the cameras alone. Pictures of him standing by himself in his own house didn’t prove or hint at anything, so he saw the possibility of destroying the film as a waste of his time.
One hand drifted over her belly and she realized that she was frightened of when her next pain would begin, but Draco seemed to have everything under control.
Harriet couldn’t help but notice how much quieter her conversations with her husband had been since the alumni game.
Narcissa looked up at Harriet anxiously as if she were silently asking for consent, but Harriet smiled proudly down at her belly as Draco’s little one continued to move and stretch.
There was something he found attractive about the level of confidence that Harriet had demonstrated by having those portraits made in the first place.
Draco kissed Scorpius’s chubby little cheek as his fussy cries gradually stopped and he slowly slipped back into sleep.
Harriet sighed again as Draco’s lips touched her skin one last time. She managed to profoundly ruin the moment as she breathed, “I’ve already signed the papers, Draco.”
“Now, you listen to me, Potter.” Draco said warningly. His voice billowed from his throat in the low, commanding growl with which only an alpha could speak.
Harriet felt good, and looked good, and besides the feeling of knowing she wasn’t truly alone, she really couldn’t tell a major change in herself.
Draco crossed his arms and looked down at the miniature version of himself as he asked, “I’m terribly sorry to disturb you, but do you think you can be bothered to come in and share a meal with your family?”
Draco bent forward and gave Harriet a gentle hug in her sleep. He blinked when she whimpered and cuddled into him.
Gryffindor had won the alumni game fairly, he admitted that, but Draco didn’t feel that his wishes for a family were that unreasonable.
“You know, Mr. Malfoy……” The jewelry shop’s best salesman nodded at his prestigious and very wealthy customer after he had shown Draco a selection of materials that weren’t to his liking, “We have the highest reputation for quality jewelry in the wizarding world. If you don’t see anything you like here, I’d be happy to help you design something entirely customized to your tastes.”
Harriet moved as quickly as she could to crawl out of his lap while she scowled and retorted, “I’m not being obstinate! I’m being rational! I told you….I’ve already signed the papers! The adoption has been arranged!”
But before Lucius was a death eater, in fact, before he was a husband or a father, Lucius Malfoy was first and foremost a business man.
“Perhaps we should call a healer?” Narcissa suggested urgently as her blue eyes flickered between her husband and Harriet.
Draco then took a moment to climb into Harriet’s nest beside her before he brought his parents in to meet their new grandson.
A week after Draco’s visit to the Roberts’ home, Harriet woke up late one morning and blinked as she looked around her humble apartment.
He had until dawn to live out the fantasy of holding Harriet close, stroking her belly, and pretending that they were a real couple.
In his mind, all Draco could only hear the scuffling, the shuffling, and the conflicting, shouted orders from the medical team as they tended his darling omega.
After Draco read the owl’s letter and learned that his darling Harriet was being transported to the hospital, his heart dropped into his stomach.
She didn’t think she would have survived that morning if it hadn’t been for the anti-nausea potion that Draco gave her and the sympathetic way he held her in his arms.
It was a shame, but Harriet was already starting to nearly resent the child that her alpha was convinced she carried.
It had been only months prior when he had held his worst enemy in his arms, in his bed, for that wonderful night.
Draco glared right back at the healer but he reluctantly stood and obeyed. Perhaps he had overestimated just how lovely it was to have an old fashioned family healer after all.
As they left their bungalow a few days later, the Malfoys accepted with a sad resolve that their notions had been incorrect.
Although there was the slight glint of disappointment in Narcissa’s eyes when she found out that she had not received a blonde little girl to dress up in Slytherin-esque frocks, Draco had never seen Lucius’s pale face glow with such pride as it did when he gazed down at the youngest Malfoy.
Beaters from both sides were busy trying to keep the bludgers away and the keepers were doing their best to defend their team’s rings.
“She’s looking right at me.” Draco panted, “.....I don’t think Scorpius really opened his eyes for most of his first day.”
“To protect my child, Father! And when I come back later, I expect Potter’s welcoming party to be much different if you’re interested in ever meeting your unfortunate, bastard mistake of a grandchild!” Draco shouted at his parents hatefully before he apparated away from the manor and back to the gelato shop where Harriet was waiting for him.
“We don’t need to move her to St. Mungo’s now?” Draco asked worriedly as Harriet’s grip on his hand tightened.
Although it was well past the stage where they were probably needed, Draco continued to pay the midwife and the healer to stay at Malfoy manor and monitor the health of his mate and their baby.
“Good.” Lucius huffed, “Go to bed and get yourself some rest, you’ve got your work cut out for you.”
“Scorpius!” Draco shouted as he gazed out across his estate’s grand terrace, “I’m not going to call you again! Dinner is ready!”
“It’s alright, Mum. She isn’t hurting me…... I’ll miss you too, Lily.” Scorpius kindly said to Harriet before he spoke to his little sister, glad to have her hug.
“There, there, my dear…..It’s alright. You don’t have to be afraid…..I’m here with you. I’m not going to let anything bad happen. I promise to protect you.”
Thank you for reading! Please let me know if you enjoy! I don’t own any of Harry Potter! Updates every Saturday!
The couple entered The Three Broomsticks and were discreetly shown to a private table in a deserted portion of the pub.
Harriet wasn’t someone who was particularly interested in jewelry, but even she had to admit, the ring that her lover had chosen for her was beautiful.
No sex with the pressure to conceive, no worries about work or babies or anything else, just her and Draco…...together and happy.
Both of his parents were a bit envious of his blissful rest as Harriet laid him back down in his bassinet.
They spoke to the server at the front and followed the woman back past the many tables in the crowded tavern after they gave her their party’s name.
She smirked against him arrogantly, confident that she had her alpha wrapped around her little finger.
Draco followed the Auror secretary for what seemed like hours but was in all actuality probably only a moment or two as they dashed down the hallway, rode the lift to another floor, then took a turn and went in the opposite direction down an entirely different corridor.
On the last night of their holiday, one of the couple’s lengthy kisses ended with Draco holding Harriet against the wall of the infinity pool while he moved his hips against hers, but it was better then, there was no need to conceive anymore, there was only love.
Draco swallowed tightly. Without another thought, he accepted his omega’s invitation and crawled forward on the bed to join her in her nest.
Harriet had worried that Draco would be annoying and relentlessly overbearing, but to her surprise, as the days passed by, he continued to look after her, but he seemed to be drifting farther and farther away when he wasn’t lying with her in the nest.
“Lily.” Draco chided as he glanced over at the toddler that stood in her bed and looked at him with her emerald eyes, “Narcissa,” Draco added as he turned his gaze on the other small girl who was standing in her own crib, which was directly across from her twin sister’s, “What have I told you two about holding onto the rails like that? You’re going to slip and pinch your fingers.”
“I’ve watched her diet and monitored her water intake!” Draco roared in defiance at the healer, “She sleeps well at night! She’s comfortable at home, she’s-“
Draco had just moved his gaze low enough to see what was happening when Harriet’s grip on his hand tightened to a painful level and she wailed as she bore down one last time.
That tiny baby was the living product of his love for Harriet, an eternal representation that she was his and he was hers.
“Nothing, right now. I’d like to rest for a bit if I can.” Draco said quietly, “Go and tend Scorpius for awhile.”
One afternoon, while she sat at her desk, tackling a mountain of backlogged paperwork from a recent investigation, Harriet’s head pounded as she signed her name on one document after another with a long, brown quill.
Alone with Harriet, both of them full of good food, and delighted by their pleasant evening, Draco kissed his omega senseless in the darkness of their bedroom. Over and over their lips met until they were pulling at each other’s clothes and shuffling towards the soft, welcoming blankets of Harriet’s nest.
The morning of Harriet’s ultrasound appointment, she and Draco woke, washed, and dressed before she apparated them to an alley behind the large complex that housed London’s sprawling muggle hospital.
“Come on, then.” Harriet said after she wheeled the trunks into the center of the room and held out her hand to Draco, “Let’s be off.”
Draco crossed his arms and looked down at the miniature version of himself as he asked, “I’m terribly sorry to disturb you, but do you think you can be bothered to come in and share a meal with your family?”
“Harriet, don’t worry about that!” Hermione said, “You know Ron, he’ll always try to help…….As long as there’s no spiders involved……..”
Hermione calmly turned back to Draco and scowled at the look of amusement on his pale face as he watched Harriet’s friends interact.
Draco was trying to quell some of his rage and stifle a bit of his sadness so he could make it through the rest of the visit when the door to the Weasley’s cottage opened behind him.
Her fingers clutched the soft blankets of her nest that she was safely cuddled in as she unconsciously squeezed Draco so tightly with her legs that he began to wonder if that may be the end of him.
He knew that he and Harriet would most likely be up multiple times through the night. It would be very inconvenient to have to traipse down the hallway in order to tend their child.
As they both came down from their orgasm, Draco didn’t bother to remove himself as Harriet kissed his lips playfully again before he bent his head to nibble teasingly on her plump nipples.
She said no, but her body was betraying her. Harriet felt her core tingle as she imagined what it might be like to carry Draco’s children. Her cheeks started to blush when she thought about how pleased her alpha would be with her and how adorable their chubby, little babies would be as they laid at her breasts.
On the bed, in front of Draco, Harriet groaned quietly while another pain started in the base of her belly. As it grew in intensity, Draco frowned in sympathy while Harriet panted. To try and ease her discomfort, Draco took up massaging her back again.
“That’s alright, I know where he lives. I’ll send them to Malfoy manor. I’ll write to him! I’ll threaten to send the Aurors after his father again unless he lets me speak freely with Harriet! He’s done something to her, I know he has, there’s no way she’d be with Malfoy!” Hermione said determinedly.
Harriet turned on her side and Draco spooned around her, careful not to put pressure on her belly as he held her close to make his omega feel protected and comfortable.
He saw the awe and fascination in Harriet’s face as she stared at the little baby across the street.
“Alright, alright…..” Draco said soothingly as he took Scorpius by his little hand and led him back in the house, “You can play with the pixies again tomorrow, how does that sound?”
“Do I have enough time to at least brush my hair or rogue my cheeks before we leave?” Harriet asked.
“After the trouble your wife’s had, it’s quite remarkable the baby is unharmed.” The midwife snapped at Draco, “Only a headstrong little woman could survive something like that.”
Every time Draco looked at his son, he saw himself, but when he looked at his daughters, he saw his wife.
Harriet breathed a silent sigh of contentment as she felt the outer echoes of sleep’s peaceful void ebbing at the edges of her closed eyes……
Draco had tried desperately to stay away from his omega. He didn’t want her to know that he found her particularly beautiful in her current state.
While Draco watched, Harriet undid the knotted sash on her robe and let the garment slip off her shoulders to fall effortlessly on the floor.
He was hopeful that in a few short months, he’d hear another cry that was much louder and sharper than Harriet’s.
“I’m sorry I didn’t come to you and Ron.” Harriet said in a bitterly sad voice, “I didn’t want…….I didn’t want you to be disappointed in me.”
Draco gasped in exasperation, “Perhaps not to our extent, but Potter’s wealthy from her father’s inheritance! She’s not going to-“
“Harriet! Are you alright?!” Hermione asked worriedly. She deliberately chose to ignore her old enemy and his mother.
She laughed until Draco managed to maneuver her shirt down low enough and find her breasts with his mouth.
When Hermione’s writings began to take on a frantic tone, Draco sat down one afternoon while Harriet was having one of her many naps, and answered the letter himself.
“You seduced the Potter girl once, Draco.” Lucius remarked, “Sure you can manage it again, this time, do not let her go so easily.”
If Scorpius hadn’t been in the way, having his breakfast, then Draco would have gladly taken Harriet into his arms one last time before they had to apparate back to Malfoy manor.
The guest list was so large that it took two rooms dedicated to hosting the reception in order for there to be enough space to seat everyone.
Harriet sat on an ebony chair, dressed in a glimmering gown of gold and red, much to Draco’s contempt, while she held little Scorpius on her lap, and Draco stood behind them both, in one of his usual, black suits.
Draco found happiness in simply being around Harriet. It didn’t matter if she was pregnant or not, if they were talking or arguing, Harriet was his mate and all he really wanted to do was just be with her.
It was odd, really, almost as if the child sensed his father’s plans and schemed their chance meeting from inside her womb……….
“Now, that isn’t true, love……. you know better than that.” Draco chided as Harriet gasped out a sob so dramatic that anyone else would have thought she had just learned tragic news.
Draco hovered over his expectant guest, monitoring her intake of water and the quality of her nutrition.
Whenever Harriet felt up to it, Draco continued to show his eagerness and enthusiasm for making love to her.
Harriet’s eyes were dull and her frown was even more exaggerated than his own as she gazed over the foggy grounds of Malfoy manor on that gloomy day.
It seemed that the most eligible, pure-blooded bachelor of the wizarding world wouldn’t be a bachelor for too much longer, after all~.
Draco counted the days until he got to meet his daughter, but he also agonized that the birth was becoming increasingly nearer.
“You heard the healers, Draco. I had exhaustion. Thanks to you I’m doing much better now.” Harriet replied with a yawn.
Harry noticed the wetness on Draco’s thighs and he asked her in a soothing whisper, “Waters’ gone, love?”
There was a huge ceiling fan, with a large mirror in the corner, more removable glass, and a gorgeous, round bed right in the center.
Harriet’s fiancé was busy dusting himself off in an attempt to straighten out his black suit that had wrinkled during their impromptu trip.
The following day, after the Auror department employees had all left the hospital, wishing their coworker and her husband well, Draco was permitted to take his two ladies home.
“I know, love. I’m sorry.” Narcissa replied with a pout, “Your father and I had to ask them to make their rounds with us a bit sooner. The linen traders are coming this afternoon instead, so we’ll be spending that time selecting the tablecloths and the napkins and the draperies……”
Harriet pulled the covers up over herself and Draco stood to answer his door with a frown on his face.
From the sunlight that streamed in through his bedroom’s large window, Draco saw the single tear that slowly trickled down Harriet’s cheek.
No matter what was coming, the sensation of Draco showing her his affection in such a sweet and loving way, that made it all seem so much…….better.
“I’m saving our relationship with our son, what’s left of it anyway, after that ludicrous display you put on earlier.” Narcissa remarked to her husband as she continued to ensure that the dining room and the contents of the table were being arranged perfectly.
Draco and Harriet were marrying for love and yet somehow, their day of sentiment was quickly evolving into becoming nothing more than a very formal, very public declaration of family wealth and nobility.
The lid came off of the box and Draco tossed it carelessly onto the top of his desk before he peered inside at the box’s contents.
As Harriet pulled the top of her nightdress down and let Scorpius latch on, she sighed in relief when Draco pulled the blanket around her and draped it across what he could of her bare shoulder to ward off the night’s chill.
During the weekends, Harriet was able to sit in the nursery and rummage through a couple of the boxes of items that Draco had purchased and stacked around the room.
As he laid in bed and thought about Harriet, Draco groaned, snaking a hand down to wrap around his arousal. He closed his eyes and remembered the way she melted under his attentions, arching herself into his touch as if she was aching for him.
That was a lie, despite their awkward exchange, she felt amazing. Still pleasured and relaxed from Draco’s satisfying attention the night before, for an omega so far along in a pregnancy, Harriet may as well have been floating on a cloud.
The smug smirk of arrogance on Draco’s handsome face filled her with the urge to reach up and smack him.
Considering how far Draco had come with Harriet in a few days, he calculated that was more than enough time to win his mate’s heart.
When he latched back onto her darkened nipples and sucked hard, Harriet winced and looked up, feeling desire flood her core again at the rough contact.
Her body itself appeared to be alright, neither the healer nor the midwife could determine anything physically wrong with her, but the omega lost her appetite and began to refuse food.
Harriet rose from the sofa and embraced Hermione in a warm but gentle hug as she whispered excitedly, “Congratulations!”
Scorpius woke at the sound as well and began to whimper until Harriet stood up, walked over, and plucked her darling baby from his wooden cradle.
Harriet nodded again and took a breath. Dr. Krause turned the screen of the machine towards the couple and as she moved forward to place the device in her hand on Harriet’s belly, Draco narrowed his eyes to slits and hunched protectively over Harriet, terrified that she was going to be hurt.
While Draco pressed feather soft kisses across the places of her that he buried his face in, he murmured quietly, “You know, love, I’ve been thinking….,.”
It didn’t bother Harrier that Draco was attentive, he had always been, incredibly enough, sweet and caring behind closed doors.
He had been hoping the healer would say that there was some harmless, simple explanation, that Harriet’s episode wasn’t anything more than an abrupt rush of anxiety.
“Listen, Malfoy, if we’re really going to help you pull this off, you have to promise to stay true to her……...and you better take good care of her and that baby!” Ron warned threateningly.
“Now you’re laughing at me!” Harriet wailed as she pulled away from Draco as much as her belly would allow.
“I don’t want to.” Harriet sighed stubbornly as she laid back against the pile of soft things in which she was happily entangled.
He didn’t want to disturb her sleep, else, he would have gone over and pecked those plump lips of hers with his own.
She sighed to herself quietly as she stretched her body for half a second before she stood from bed and wrapped her velvet robe around her waist.
In the Roberts’ small living room, Draco came to grips with the nauseating fact that gold wasn’t going to solve his problem.
Harriet gave Draco a pleasing look and he smirked as he realized that she did in fact want his help.
Harriet sighed again and laid her head down in the crook of Draco’s neck as she struggled to stop crying.
More than anything, Draco wished that she was lying beside him. He would cuddle her close and kiss her gently. He could run his hands down her sides and touch her adorable belly again.
“Oh…..um…..” Harriet shrugged, “I’m not sure. I’ve only just learned the news myself, I haven’t seen a midwife yet.”
Draco was surprised when he made it back to his bedroom and found Harriet already awake from her nap, sitting up in bed. His omega seemed to be eagerly anticipating his return as her green eyes landed on him when he stepped into the room.
The midwife and healer eventually did knock on the door and Draco gave them permission to enter with a single call, “Come in!”
“She often doesn’t feel well.” Draco frowned at the midwife as he informed her of his mate’s symptoms, “I’m giving her anti-nausea potion and we go to bed early……..What else can I do to make her more comfortable?”
Harriet gasped as she looked over at Draco and to her bewilderment, loud pops rang out around the room as the guests that had been invited for the memorable moment arrived right on time.
As Harriet joined Draco at the front of the room, faced him, and joined hands at the officiant’s command, the roaring silence of the absolute hush that fell over the crowd was surprisingly overwhelming for Harriet as well.
Harriet initially felt uneasy later that afternoon, when Narcissa came to collect Scorpius well before dinner would be served.
“I give you my spirit, Harriet Potter,” Draco said to Harriet and as he spoke, his grip on her fingers tightened, “.........Until our lives shall be done.”
Whenever he woke from one of those horrible dreams, instead of Harriet finding respite in his scent, it was Draco who took solace in hers. He would nuzzle into the crook of her neck and breathe in the smell of the beguiling hormones she released, listening to her heartbeat until he fell back asleep.
When Harriet looked down and noticed that the very top of her cleavage would be exposed to Draco’s view if he stood nearby, she understood why he had chosen that particular dress for her to wear on their special, private night.
He really had wanted to wait until they got engaged, but he had to think up a new plan and……..and Harriet looked too good in her lovely dress for him to resist.
“She’s resting comfortably for now. There’s nothing more I can do.” The healer spoke, nodding at Draco before she took out her wand, “Good day, Mr. Malfoy.”
Draco felt that going shopping for their baby was a good device he could use to continue his efforts.
“We’ll both play in the game, just like old times.” Draco grinned at his wife, “If Gryfinndor wins, I won’t say another word about us procreating for the rest of our lives, I promise.”
There were no intrusive buildings in sight, only small, wooden bungalows that were built over the water.
“My mate won’t even eat enough food to feed our son!” Draco retorted, “I’ve seen it myself! He cries for her breasts and when she nurses him, he cries afterwards with an empty belly!”
The baby fell silent but Harriet’s face twisted in pain as she lay on her back and felt her belly tighten again.
The handsome, attentive Malfoy heir had caught the eye of the other pregnant omegas in the class and the envy of their alphas, but Draco’s attention was firmly centered on Harriet.
Hermione had never been one to have trouble reacting and she spoke first as she accused Harriet, “I can’t believe you’ve lied to us!”
For a moment, Draco thought he imagined the noise. However, as he closed his eyes to rest some more and enjoy the feeling of Harriet’s soft, plump curves against him, he couldn’t deafen his ears to the chatter and shuffling that he heard faintly from a distant part of the house.
As a former Death Eater, did Lucius Malfoy approve of his son siring a child with the Dark Lord’s defeater?
“Why not stay with your alpha and let me love you~?” Draco asked in a husky growl, kissing his way down to Harriet’s bare throat, “You can nest right here in our bed…..then we can welcome this baby together~.”
Harriet winced and tried in vain to maneuver herself so that her alpha could slip inside her, but her patience didn’t match her will. She grew tired of her mate’s skillful dodging and gave in as she cried out, “Fill me, Draco! Fill me up!”
It may all have been worth it, the pain he felt, the humiliation of losing and that terrible accident, if he had won his bet with his omega, but he hadn’t. To Draco, that meant the pain and the mortification was all for nothing.
Harriet knew she should have felt a sense of relief as she watched the baby start to nurse exactly like she and Draco had been instructed during their classes, but as she stared down at her son, she was pulverized by a crushing, unavoidable sense of deep and horrible despair.
“These are women’s matters.” Healer Marigold snapped. She opened up her bag and pointed towards the door, throwing a glare at Draco as she ordered him without hesitation, “Out!”
“So you’re what all the fuss has been about, eh?” Ron asked in a teasing tone as he looked down at the baby and gently touched one of his tiny hands.
With one hand, Draco guided her head to lay against his chest and he began to idly stroke her hair as he whispered, “Please……..stop crying.”
She stepped away from her post, ready to work as she asked the omega, “Tell me, does your alpha…...like you…...like this?”
“Not if I prove that child is mine.” Draco scowled dangerously at Harriet, “I will not allow a Malfoy to be traded off like some unwanted mutt! And those are the strangest clothes I’ve ever seen, those people must be a bunch of beggars.”
Under Draco’s watchful eye, Harriet had made wonderful progress. Draco grinned proudly when the healer had commended his efforts on helping the poorly omega and the child she carried regain their health.
Draco struggled not to purr at the tenderness he saw in Harriet’s emerald gaze as she lovingly pulled the blankets around their little son and clutched him closely to her.
“Thanks, Hermione. Thank you for staying with me.” Harriet said as she reached her free hand out shakily to grab Hermione’s, “Thank you all.” Harriet said as she glanced at Draco, Narcissa, the midwife, and the healer.
“I don’t think that’s necessary yet, Malfoy.” Harriet gasped as Draco dipped his head and began to place gentle kisses along her collarbone, “Do you want me to have five at once?”
“The movement’s so much stronger now.” Draco commented as he felt the child inside Harriet wriggle back and forth.
With his wand still in his hand, Draco vanished her clothing and left her exposed and gasping on his lap.
Mr. Roberts was surprised that such a dapper gentleman would ask a ridiculous, naive question, but he was kind and patient.
Harriet sighed deeply before she answered him, “What’s it going to take to get you to shut up about this?”
Draco groaned softly as he crouched over his mate and eagerly kissed her back, although he was careful not to put any weight on her torso.
It wasn’t that he blanched about the prospect of the delivery, but he was terrified that they wouldn’t make it to the hospital and that his darling or his baby may suffer an unforeseen issue.
Draco frowned as he watched her chest heave and fall. He lovingly kissed her cheek again while he urged her, “Then I’ll let you look through the boxes and whatever you don’t like, we won’t keep. How’s that?”
Draco smirked at his wife as she deftly picked the letter up, though he did twitch when she purposefully let her finger slip across his naked length.
“Nothing.” Draco replied quickly, shaking his head as if he were offended that Harriet had even asked, “Nothing’s the matter.”
Harriet didn’t want to voluntarily acknowledge it, but it was rather…...nice, being cared for by an alpha, even in that small way.
“I don’t need your help or your pity.” Harriet sniffed, “I’ve found a solution, so there’s no need to worry about it.”
He watched something covered in bright shocks of platinum blond hair slowly emerge from Harriet’s core.
Draco sat on the muggles’ sofa and thought for a moment, with his face puckered as if he were in terrible agony.

Draco looked into Harriet’s green eyes and narrowed his, not in annoyance or irritation, but in sadness.
“That’s right, Harriet!” Hermione said enthusiastically, “Don’t forget that! I’ve always wished that I had your confidence!”
After years of turmoil, war, struggles, and death, finally, the unlikely couple had dropped the walls around their hearts and let their love blossom.
As Dr. Krause gently ran the ultrasound wand over Harriet’s bare belly, the screen began to turn and change.
Lucius and Draco regarded each other for a moment before he spoke, “But father, she doesn’t want anything to do with me!”
After the war, he had lost most of his Slytherin friends and as he prepared to take Harriet as his wife in front of a very populous audience, the only soul with him besides the house elves was his father.
Harriet appreciated her mate’s loving ways and the love in his actions made the aches, the pains, and the inconveniences that came with late pregnancy worthwhile.
There came a rare stretch of three consecutive days that Harriet was fortunate enough to get off of work. Draco planned to spend those days cuddling and lounging around with his beloved wife.
Harriet and Draco didn’t know much about wedding planning, but Lucius and Narcissa were completely prepared to make their only son’s special day absolutely unforgettable~.
Harriet looked at the healer and the midwife with wide eyes, unable to believe that this was how new mothers were treated, but when they refused to meet her gaze, she stared past them and pleaded silently with Draco.
Harriet’s eyes widened as Draco moved from behind her and swiftly knelt in front of her as she sat on the bed, gazing at her with awed admiration.
If Draco had known what his parents were planning, if he had known the damage they were going to inflict on his and Harriet’s fragile connection, he would have whisked his lover far away to a castle of their own.
Narcissa frowned and Hermione blinked pleadingly at Harriet. Draco glared at the other two omegas in the room and explained, “I’ll call you both when we need you. Please…….send the healer and the midwife in.”
Since the matter of the looming adoption was all but handled, Draco focused on his next most important task, helping his pregnant omega settle into life at Malfoy manor while he saw to her care.
Draco scowled at his mother incredulously, “Thank you……..we’ll, um, we’ll be along very shortly. She’s napping, just now.”
Thank you for reading! I don’t own any of Harry Potter! Please let me know if you enjoy! Updates every Saturday!
“Very well.” Hermione nodded, boldly choosing to answer for herself and Ron, much to her lover’s chagrin, “We’ll help you propose to Harriet.”
Narcissa closed the door as she left and Harriet and Draco stared at each other in dismay for a moment before Harriet laughed and pecked Draco’s lips.
She was certain that if her alpha had been there, he would have noticed the inexplicable shift in her scent.
Thank you for reading! I don’t own any of Harry Potter! Please let me know if you enjoy! Updates every Saturday!
“So, Granger and Weasley are leaving their baby with us for the entire time?” Draco huffed, sitting up in bed with a scowl as Harriet hurriedly dressed.
“Well, I’m sure they’re offices are all closed now, Draco. I’ll make one in the morning.” Harriet retorted.
Harriet was used to being in the media’s eye from her previous experiences but she was still shocked that the news about her and Draco had been so eagerly received.
“-Hush, ‘Cissa!” Lucius hissed cuttingly to quiet his wife. When Narcissa fell silent, he turned back towards Draco and regarded him coldly, “When you have your own child, you’ll understand the lengths that a father will go to so their child’s survival is assured. Your mother and I don’t understand why you and the Potter girl can’t take a photo together and have a small article run in the Prophet. It would be wonderful publicity for this family’s companies.”
Carefully, he picked Harriet up into his arms and gingerly sat her down on the floor so that her back was supported by the nursery’s wall.
“I came back early!” Harriet lied pointlessly. Even if that statement was truthful, that did nothing to explain her condition, of which Ron and Hermione were in absolute disbelief that she hadn’t mentioned anything about it to them previously.
“How is my wife now?” Draco hissed through grit teeth. His usually smooth voice was rough and jagged with an edge of feral uneasiness.
“Sorry, Potter, have I not done something to your liking?” Draco asked sarcastically as he licked Harriet off of his lips.
Draco had to nearly force what little he could down her throat. He complimented his efforts at feeding the mother of his child by coaxing her into taking small sips of water every once in a while.
While Draco was in the bathroom, Harriet pulled herself out of her nest and walked over to open the door. She peered into the hallway and called out when she saw Narcissa’s figure walking away.
Shakily, she walked over to the bed and opened the dark grey box that was sitting on top of the duvet.
Draco placed his letter in an envelope, sealed it with the Malfoy family crest, and sent it with one of many Malfoy owls.
Hermione made a noise of irritation in her throat as she turned her head and snapped, “Ronald Weasley, do you not understand romance at all?! You don’t just walk down the street with someone on any old day and ask them to marry you!”
“The midwife said that lying down for long periods can cause a blood clot.” Draco reminded her sternly, “Come on, Potter, let’s go to dinner. Do you need me to help you up?”
Ron and Hermione thanked Harriet and nodded politely at Draco for looking after their small daughter. Harriet waved goodbye to her friends as they walked out of the flat, but Draco stood with a frown on his face.
The Cesarean section video made Draco regret his decision to come to the muggles for help with preparing to meet his baby.
“There are, Father! I saw them with my own eyes!” Scorpius insisted as his grey stare bore into Draco’s.
While he laid there and suffered through the healing potions that had been poured down his throat while he was unconscious, he forced himself to abandon his dreams of fatherhood, to let go of his idyllic, imagined scenes of having a family with the woman he loved.
“Potter,” Draco spoke, using a low, commanding tone that made Harriet weak in her knees, “You’ve gambled your life and our daughter’s for a job you don’t even need. There isn’t going to be anymore ‘going by the office’ for quite a while.”
Underneath the table, his trembling hands removed the ring box from the lower pocket on the inside of his suit jacket and Harriet chuckled as she added, “What are you going to do next? Get down on your knees and ask me to marry you?”
As they stood there and stared each other down in that muggle gelato shop, Ron, Harriet, Hermione, and Draco all endured what may have been one of the single most awkward moments of their lives so far.
There was indeed a corridor in Malfoy manor that was lined with each generation’s family portrait, which were made shortly after the birth of a new child.
It wasn’t that Draco had anything against the svelte waist that Harriet had possessed before their original passionate night, which had ended in Scorpius’s conception, but there was a part of him that missed her rounded belly.
Regardless, when the date arrived, Draco and Harriet prepared themselves to spend a Saturday afternoon with Harriet’s two best friends.
A week before the baby was scheduled to come, Draco noticed a striking difference in Harriet’s behavior.
As he stood and watched Harriet holding the Weasley’s baby, he imagined her holding one of their own instead.
Over the next couple of weeks, there were more secret meetings between the unlikely trio as various plots were schemed up and discarded while they all traded ideas back and forth.
Harriet glanced up at Draco for a moment and he smiled back down at her before he pressed a kiss against her lips.
Draco let Harriet dictate the speed and intensity of how their lips brushed together, but he did take advantage of the opportunity to lay a hand over her mounded tummy.
“You’re mine, Potter.” Draco boldly declared as he crawled over Harriet and cupped her face in his hand.
The nursery had been prepared weeks ago. Nursery or not, wasn’t a single spot in Malfoy manor with a speck of dust or dirt.
He turned around expecting to see Harriet but he narrowed his eyes when he watched Ron walk up to stand beside him instead.
The snitch came rushing behind Draco and Harriet caught it instinctively in her hand but she paid it little mind.
The couple talked and kissed and reconnected with each other to such a degree that both of them nearly forgot why they had come on their trip in the first place.
His grey eyes widened incredulously as he tried to determine if he was really looking at what he thought he saw printed on those pages.
Draco stopped his ministrations as Harriet rolled onto her back long enough to look up into his eyes. She held his face in her hands, and smiled as she reassured him, “You’re going to do just fine, Draco. I’m worried about giving birth... and being a mother... and working….and all the other things that come with this, but I’m not worried about your devotion to our family at all.”
“I’ve done no such thing!” Draco scoffed, “I came to escort you to the paternity test, wherever that will take place......and I found you unconscious in that shabby little flat of yours, with which I was very disappointed, Potter. I imagined you would still have enough left of your father’s gold to afford something better….Anyway, I saw you weren’t well and when I was unable to rouse you, I brought you here.”
“I know, I know, my love…...I’m sorry, that was inconsiderate of me. I’ll return all of this and we’ll start over, alright? You can make all of the decisions.” Draco coaxed as he kissed Harriet’s cheek.
Harriet grabbed hold of him and pulled him closer to her in a frustrated growl, which caused him to laugh in amusement.
“Then I’ll bring you everything.” Draco said nonchalantly as he walked out the door of his bedroom towards the kitchen.
While they waited for the healer and the midwife to come in, he kept his omega on her side where she was comfortable and whispered to her soothingly while he gently rubbed her back and arms to help her relax.
Harriet turned her face back towards the wall and sighed as Draco’s skilled hands continued to massage her gently.
After their heated exchange, Draco knew from the looks Harriet had given him that if he had tried to lay another finger on her, she would have bitten it off.
Regardless, his lips pursed and his eyes narrowed as he thought about the vivid scene that had played through his mind while he slept.
Harriet laid the letter back down and stretched as a gentle flutter rippled from her abdomen. Her green eyes glanced down and she spread her hands on the sides of her rounded belly with a resigned sigh.
Harriet knew that the Malfoy heir would have no interest in mass-produced, cheap, plastic goods, no matter how practical those things were for a baby. She had been careful to choose an area with shops of which Draco may reluctantly approve. Everything in the boutiques carried a heavy price tag and everything was of the utmost quality.
The Malfoy heir had no intentions of forcing motherhood onto his wife, but as he rolled over in his lonely bed, he frowned to himself as he thought.
He sat through the sorting ceremony, clapping when new students joined Slytherin, but his heart wasn’t in it. That night he lay in his dorm staring at the ceiling. Why wasn’t Harry at Hogwarts? He awoke the next morning and went to the Great Hall, still not in the best mood. However, when he arrived in the Great Hall, he was surprised to see that Harry was there joking and laughing with Weasley, Granger, and other Gryffindors. His heart stopped momentarily. Wait. Harry was here after all. A small smile spread on his face as he sat down to breakfast.
As the months wore on, Draco began to pay even closer attention to Harry. He felt excited anytime Gryffindor had a Quidditch game because it gave him an excuse to stare at Harry and to watch his spectacular flying skills. And he found himself looking forward to classes that Slytherins shared with Gryffindors more than the classes they shared with Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw. He was not quite sure where this obsession came from. Was he obsessed due to hatred or simply because the boy was famous? Or perhaps it was from something else altogether…. Usually, Draco dismissed these thoughts telling himself not to be silly and that lots of people were obsessed with Harry and that it didn’t mean anything. But on more than one occasion he found himself staring at Harry and the way he smiled or the twinkle in his green eyes when he made a joke. And once or twice Harry had caught him staring and he would quickly look away and focus very hard on whatever was right in front of him or pretend to be deep in conversation with one of the other Slytherins.
“In a moment, love,” Malfoy said. “Like I said, I want this to be good for you.” And with that he added a third finger. By this point both boys were painfully hard, and Malfoy knew that he needed to fuck Harry soon or he wouldn’t last. “Okay, I think that is enough preparation for now,” he said, taking his cock out of his pants. He cast a quick lubrication spell and slicked himself up before positioning himself directly behind Harry and lining his cock up with Harry’s tight little hole. Without warning he entered Harry’s body. Both boys moaned at the contact.
“As you wish,” Malfoy smirked sticking a finger in Harry’s arse and drawing a moan from the other boy. Malfoy began to pump his finger in and out of Harry, opening him up. Harry sighed at the contact and rested his forehead against the wall, closing his eyes. He focused on the feeling of Malfoy’s finger inside of him and the way it felt to have Malfoy standing so close. If he were being honest, he had fantasised about exactly this many times before.
Harry gulped. There was not much he could do now that Malfoy had his wand. He took a step back so that his back was now against the wall.
Draco’s pupils dilated at that, his cock growing hard. “When you say I can fuck you now, do you mean like right now? Like on the train?” he asked eagerly.
“You haven’t even heard what I have in mind yet. How can you say no so quickly?” Malfoy asked clearly enjoying this.
Upon arriving at Hogwarts, he finally glimpsed the famous Harry Potter when they were waiting for the sorting ceremony to begin. Harry was talking with a red-haired boy that Draco correctly assumed was a Weasley. His stomach churned. Why was Harry talking to the likes of him? Didn’t he know better? And worse, if Harry became friends with Weasley that would ruin his chance at being friends with him. He decided he needed to intervene. Going up to him he offered his hand saying, “You’ll soon find out that some wizarding families are better than others, Potter. You don’t want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.”
When September 1st came, Draco was absolutely buzzing with excitement. He could not wait to get on the train. He was secretly hoping he’d run into Harry and that they’d become fast friends. However, once on the train Crabbe and Goyle had found him, and he was unable to look for Harry without raising suspicion. He spent the train ride in their very dull company, watching the scenery flit past and wondering what Hogwarts would be like. He knew he’d be sorted in Slytherin. That much was a certainty. Even if he had wanted to be in another house, he knew his father would disown him if he was. He was also very much looking forward to learning potions. He’d always been curious about them and all the different things that they could do. And of course, he hoped to try out for his house Quidditch team. He knew first years did not ever make it onto the team, but he fantasised that they would make an exception for him because of how good he was. As they got closer to Hogwarts, he changed into his robes.
After their brief encounter, the sorting ceremony began. As expected, Draco was sorted into Slytherin as were Crabbe and Goyle. Potter however was sorted into Gryffindor along with the Weasley kid.
Panting, Malfoy’s cock slipped out of Harry’s arse, and he nudged Harry towards the bed, where they both collapsed.
The comment really stung. While it was true that his father had bought the entire team brooms and made a deal with Snape to ensure it, Draco knew that he was also a very talented flyer. And it hurt even more coming from Granger who was a Mudblood and who wasn’t even interested in Quidditch. Without thinking he retorted, “No one asked your opinion, you filthy Mudblood!”
“I don’t know but I doubt it,” his father replied. “It’s supposed to be impossible to escape. The Ministry has no idea how it happened.”
Harry shuddered. Fuck, it was hot knowing that Malfoy was in control. That Malfoy could do anything to him, and he would let him. Thinking these things pushed Harry over the edge. He cried out as he came, spilling his seed all over his stomach and the wall. Malfoy did not last much longer. Feeling Harry come was such a huge turn on that he was soon coming inside Harry.
The only thing to cheer him up that summer were the visits from Pansy. He and Pansy had become close friends in the past year and her company was infinitely better than that of Crabbe and Goyle. He and Pansy would sit out in the garden away from his parents and talk and laugh and eat biscuits. He had not yet told her that he was in love with Harry, or that he was gay for that matter, but he suspected that she had caught on. Pansy was smart and had on more than one occasion asked very pointed questions that had implied that she was aware of his crush. They had discussed Sirius of course but had not been able to draw any satisfying conclusions on the matter.
Draco’s eyes flashed with hunger. He loved it when his husband sucked his cock. But he had also wanted to show Harry how much he loved him. “Or I could suck you,” he said. But even as he said it Harry was kneeling in front of him and undoing his fly. Harry took Draco’s cock out and pumped it a few times before putting it in his mouth. Draco moaned at the contact. It always felt so good whenever his cock was in Harry’s mouth. He twisted his fingers in Harry’s hair as Harry began to suck his cock. Harry bobbed his head back and forth, eliciting more moans from Draco.
“I’ll never forget about you,” Harry said taking his husband’s hand. The two of them headed out of the Ministry offices, quickly changed out of their wizard robes, and headed towards the Tube. After some debate, they had decided to travel to Paris the Muggle way and take a train. Harry had wanted to travel by train instead of by Portkey because he did not want all of the people in the Portkey office to know where he was going. They had made that mistake on their honeymoon, and as a result, had ended up with lots of reporters in their face when they were just trying to relax and enjoy some peace and quiet as a newly married couple. This was why Harry had suggested that they go to Paris by train and indeed act like Muggles for the entire weekend. Draco had wrinkled his nose at that and had protested but only out of habit since he had to admit that the plan did sound like a good one and if he were being honest he quite liked the idea of pretending to be a Muggle for a weekend and of leaving the Wizarding world behind. In the years that he and Harry had been together, Draco had become pretty good friends with Hermione and this friendship had spurred an interest in Muggle things. He was nowhere near as obsessed with them as Mr. Weasley was, but he had to admit that he did enjoy some of the Muggle programmes on the BBC, and cell phones were very handy.
Harry drew his wand, but Malfoy was quicker. Malfoy pointed his wand directly at Harry and said, “Expelliarmus!” causing Harry’s wand to fly out of his hand. Malfoy caught Harry’s wand and continued to point his own wand at Harry. “Now what are you going to do? You have no wand so you might as well do as I say,” Malfoy said taking a step towards Harry, a glint in his eye.
“Mmm. Well, you might not have been able to do that then. But you could certainly fuck me now,” Harry said, a glint in his eye.
The two of them took the Tube to St. Pancras station where they then got onto the train that would take them to Paris.
“Don’t turn it down so quickly. At least not until you know what it is I’m after,” Malfoy purred. “I’ll let you go if you let me fuck you.”
“The Ministry seems to think that he’s after Potter, but personally, I doubt it. He’s a blood traitor after all.”
When Draco was in his room that night, he couldn’t help but play the scene of running into Harry over and over in his head. Why had he blushed? Had Harry noticed? Had anyone noticed? Had Granger noticed? Granger. He would have to be careful around her. He wasn’t quite sure why he had blushed but whatever it was, he was sure she would pick up on it. Very little escaped her notice and whatever it was that was going on he was sure she would know and that was the last thing he needed.
The summer after his 2nd year at Hogwarts was not a pleasant one. Draco’s father was almost always in a bad mood because of the events that had transpired at Hogwarts. His father had been upset not about students being petrified, but rather that no Muggle borns had been killed. Because of his father’s bad mood, Draco spent much of the summer in his room brooding.
As Malfoy got closer his movements became more erratic. He put his mouth on Harry’s neck and bit down causing Harry to cry out in both pain and pleasure. Harry reached down to touch is own cock, but Malfoy stopped him. “No,” he growled. “You come from my cock or not at all.”
At the sound of Draco’s voice, Harry moaned. He loved how Draco sounded during sex. His voice was normally sexy but during sex, it was even more so. Draco came into Harry’s mouth and Harry swallowed it all. Draco’s cock slid from his mouth and Harry stood as Draco zipped back up his fly and pulled Harry into a kiss. “That was wonderful,” Draco murmured. “And now it’s your turn. I want to return the favour.”
Hello, my lovelies, I know it has been a while since I posted but I promise I have not forgotten about this story. This chapter is obviously not complete but I wanted to post what I have so far and I will edit the chapter when I finish. Thanks for being understanding.
Weasley was outraged when he heard that and pointed his wand at Draco. However, the curse backfired and Weasley started vomiting slugs. Draco smirked and set off with the rest of the Slytherin team and began to practice. Draco mounted his broom and zoomed around the Quidditch pitch. The cool air rushed past him and cleared his head. Flying always had a calming affect on him and helped him to process his feelings. He did not regret standing up for himself. She had no right to say he was only on the team because his father was rich. Draco was an excellent Quidditch player. But he knew he should not have called her Mudblood. Even though it was true that she was raised by Muggles, he knew that he should not use such a word. His father had instilled in him from a young age that Pure-blood wizards were superior, but Draco did not see it as so black and white. He believed that wizards should be judged more based on merit and their magical ability than on blood status. Take Crabbe and Goyle for example, although they were from old Pure-blood families they were total buffoons and could hardly do any magic while Granger could do very advanced magic. Shouldn’t that matter? And yet, the girl really got under his skin. She was so annoying and such a show-off. Not to mention she was close to Harry and sometimes wondered if they had feelings for one another. No. He certainly should not have said Mudblood but he could not bring himself to fully regret what he had said.
He boarded the train and was joined in his compartment by Crabbe and Goyle as well as by Pansy and a few other Slytherins in his year. As he was sitting on the train waiting for it to leave, he kept looking out of the window to see if Harry had boarded yet, but he could not see him. He saw the Weasleys arrive. The pompous one, the twins, and the girl but strangely he did not see Ron. Weird, he thought to himself. Where was Harry and where was Ron? Not that he actually cared about Ron, but he was sure that the fact that Ron wasn’t there when the rest of his family was had to do with Harry not being there. Where were they?
True to his word, Harry didn’t last long. Draco was excellent at sucking cock and soon enough Harry was coming in his mouth. Draco swallowed and got to his feet. “We should return to our seats,” he said as Harry adjusted himself. Harry nodded and followed his husband back to their seats.
