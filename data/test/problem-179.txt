Draco inhaled a breath before his lungs ceased up and he coughed violently for several moments. Bemused, Eir watched him before saying; “Remember to breathe mate, you won’t get your fix if you don’t.”
Pansy snapped out of her reverie to look down at her hand, which was covered in the sticky sweetness of melted strawberry and peanut butter ice cream. “Eugh, Salazar. How did this happen?”
“No. I mean, yeah, I suppose.”
Taking deep breaths to calm himself down, he took in his surroundings. Realising he was without his wand he felt vulnerable, exposed and acutely aware of his isolation. The forest was out of the question, too freshly stained with horror, but the scene before him was equally unfamiliar.
do this! I - I don’t know how much longer our f-family will be able to survive otherwise.”
, Potter was stupid. Ever the master of subtlety.
“Shitting hell — where did — what the —?” Draco flailed his arms in an attempt to stand straight. A voice sounded from behind him, and Draco jumped.
“Oh — well — fuck.” Draco mumbled.
The trees thinned as they made their way up the hillside. From this position, Draco could see the stars, all the constellations. Sirius burned brightly against the velvety black.
to do? No no no Draco, what is it that he has asked
Draco tried to push his wandering thoughts to the side, he didn’t want to dwell on why he felt the way he did towards Theo. Between past lectures from his father and the summer he’d had, Draco had decided to put any ideas of romance aside. No fooling around, no matter who it was.
Fortunately, Potter looked about as uncomfortable as Draco was angry. “Sir— it really wasn’t like that.”
Saturday 31st August 1996
But we have a playlist that you can listen to! Its called 'i never sleep cos sleep is the cousin to death' (original, we know), use the url below!
But Draco also saw just how afraid Blaise had been to be honest. Blaise was, and always had been, Draco’s truest friend. Draco loved them dearly. He didn’t want to let them down.
“Oh fuck off, all of you.” Draco grinned, his cheeks burning.
“I like these clothes.” Draco regretted saying anything as soon as the words left his mouth.
Bellatrix sent a curse into the bushes and went to check what was in it. A dead fox. Typical, thought Narcissa, and carried on down the hill. She was aware of Bella following her, and of her disapproval of this meeting, but she was desperate. Bellatrix was good muscle, and honestly, allowed Narcissa to suss out what would be accepted by the other Death Eaters.
Potter looked at Draco as if he had just spoken in Mermish. Draco, horrified, felt his cheeks getting hot.
“Do you have Potions today, Vince?” Draco glanced up from his new timetable.
Draco almost fell out of the open window, his heart jack-hammering against his chest as he dropped the half-finished cigarette. “Fuck, fuck, fuck.” He muttered under his breath, not wanting to see who it was that had caught his doing something so distinctly Muggle-ish.
“Number three: don’t call me sir. I may look it but I am not a knight.”
Draco went to see his mother in the reading room. It was eight thirty and he needed to check in with Narcissa and make some excuse for him leaving for the day. Perfect as always, she was reading at a desk, hair neatly pinned into a chignon. Knocking, he entered and stood upright, playing with the hem of his fleece.
Narcissa broke down fully and slumped onto the floor. Severus swiftly grasped her upper arms and guided her back onto the sofa. He took her abandoned glass and refilled it, gently wrapping her fingers round and motioning for her to drink. Narcissa finished the glass and Severus topped it up again.
“Thank you, mother.”
Draco winced, remembering all the times in summer with Eir and Niamh when he had been trying desperately to remove himself from the wizarding world. And in doing so he had forgotten to write to his friends, so deep in depression that he hadn’t even wanted to think about them.
“Yes sir.”
, you could’ve just tapped my shoulder or something.” He hissed. “And yes, I’m okay, so, you know —
“That’s impressive.”
The whole day was spent managing the shop and listening to the greatest tunes from the last three or so decades. Eir usually blared out his music as a sort of advertising strategy for any passersby, but today there was intent and purpose. He was educating his padawan.
Draco was just tired of all the stupid school drama and feuds, the ‘rivalry’ he had concocted between himself and Potter. As if he was even on the same playing field. No one would care about him after all was said and done. He’d just be painted as the prejudiced, murderous supremacist. Not to mention a crazed, blood-thirsty werewolf. Draco was most definitely destined for a lifetime in Azkaban, just wishing for a Dementor to go too far, to end his suffering.
It stung Draco to hear the slurs and hateful verses in the music he enjoyed, as they frequently used queerness as the punchline. He’d never really thought about his sexuality, over the years he’d learned to suppress his wandering emotions, and before meeting Eir, the shame of his lycanthropy had pushed those conflicting feelings to the back of his mind.
company.’”
Draco bristled, irritated by his friend’s pity. “Oh fuck it all. I couldn’t care less about what some old fart thinks of me.”
Severus smoothly sat down in the armchair opposite them and crossed his legs, resting his hands on his knees.
Draco chuckled, “Not my problem!”
“Can you turn around, I need to do your eyebrows or you’re gonna look like a tit.”
?” Eir cocked his head to the left.
Sunday 8th September 1996
Draco threw his arms out, “I ran! Get your heads out the gutter, for crying out loud. Wow.”
“At 9? Is that okay?”
Draco couldn’t help his chuckling, “You’re ridiculous.”
The beginning of this chapter was fun to write - we love food. What's your favourite quarantine comfort food?
“Your money lad. Weekly then?”
“Go back Bella!”
Draco’s entire body seized up and he crashed to the floor screaming. He had never felt such pain before. His transformation, in comparison, was like a pin prick. Narcissa was yelling at his father but he couldn’t hear. It could have been seconds or hours until the pain stopped. His body shook like a leaf.
“Sorry - that was a weird thing to say.” Draco offered a weak smile. “I just, um, well - I’m going back to school in a few days, and I just wanted to come and say goodbye. And, I…” He trailed off, wringing his hands.
“I wasn’t at home this summer.” Draco took a deep breath and lowered his voice; “You may have heard already, but Malfoy Manor has been taken over.”
are you saying?”
“Mer- God it is. It’s awful. The characters are so flat and have zero development. Also I didn’t understand what any of the characters were supposed to be doing at any moment in the film. Seriously, never.”
“Uh yeah, Potter. Do you
”. The force of his shield forced Snape to stumble back and hiss as he collided with a desk.
Eir joined Draco in the bathtub, their legs folded on top of each other. They munched on the crisps and shared a fag as Niamh got to work mixing the dye whilst wearing her Marigolds.
“If you don’t, your muggle friends won’t see the light of day.”
stuff going on, he was meant to keep topping his classes. Draco was an ambitious student, but the pressure of the task at hand was almost too much to bear, and he worried about the attention failing classes would garner.
“Of course.”
“Yes.” said Potter stiffly.
“There is nothing I wouldn’t do any more!”
“Galloping griffins!”
’ nature of the Dark Lord’s forces. Wow, way to be subtle.
and the panicked feeling in Draco’s chest loosened, he chuckled despite himself. Merlin, he had missed her — no one else could build Draco up and cut him down so effortlessly.
A few students greeted Draco as he made his way across the room, and he half-heartedly returned their friendly waves. By the time he reached his dorm, his panic had almost completely subsided.
“Draco, what in Salazar’s name are you wearing?”
“Maybe.” Draco felt awful, what kind of a shitty person was he? Merlin, he just wanted to crawl into bed and hide under the covers for eternity. Because of fucking course it would be so simple for Lovegood, she was there at the Ministry in June, she was a
Pansy scoffed in response. “It looks ridiculous — Draco,
“You are
Niamh bent down so that her face was inches from Draco’s, and he could see that she had dark bags under her glistening eyes. “What’s happened, Draco? We’ve been … so worried about you.” Her voice was soft and sad - a stark contrast to the fierce woman Draco had first met.
to help his Dumbledore task. Borgin and Burkes was highly likely to have something, but he needed to choose his words carefully. Or perhaps not. Draco spotted a necklace behind Borgin, it had a moth eaten label resting next to it on the dusty velvet: Do not Touch! Cursed. Has claimed the lives of nineteen Muggle owners to date.
Eir was locking up the store and putting the last few vinyls back in order after Draco and him raided his personal favourites. His mind kept wandering to the kid, sharp and brittle, and undoubtedly a junkie in his mind. Back in Finland when he was a teen, Eir had known plenty friends getting hooked on rocks and silver spoon highs. They were rebelling against winter and the long, long nights they faced. When he came to England he went to Liverpool - cocaine capital - and saw the same escapism, this time driven by class. In Britain, it’s always about class. Draco, Eir decided, wasn’t a privileged ninny or from an estate, but he also wasn’t part of the middle order. The lad was suitably something else, undeniably beaten and frightened.
Niamh understood how he felt, even if he couldn’t tell her the whole truth. She’d had a scarring childhood, and also felt abandoned by her family. It comforted him to have someone who listened to and shared his struggles.
Wizarding World would know.”
“This man seems to have no concept of class — does he know who I am?” Draco inwardly cringed at his tone, but he had committed to it, so he was going to really lay it on thick, just for Potter, even if he could sense that his friends knew something was afoot.
Draco barked with laughter, “I was school shopping. Hence the new outfit.” He gestured to himself, pivoting left and right.
“Well whatever it is, it’s always better to talk about it than keep it to yourself. It’s better than getting into dodgy shit just ‘cause you can’t deal with it yourself. Trust me.”
“I have finished my breakfast.”
Outside, Draco once again wished that he was of age, as he watched Eir continually fail to light his cigarette with his lighter, before moving onto a box of matches. Draco had once seen some Hufflepuffs expertly snap their fingers to light their joints behind the greenhouses. Eir had finally managed to light the end of one hand-rolled fag and took a long drag before passing the matches to Draco.
Draco shook his head into the pillow and mumbled a “No”. His exhaustion was overwhelming and chess wasn’t going to remedy it. Vince and Greg carried on playing and noisily exchanged sweets and bits of gossip. Thankfully, Draco heard nothing about himself — though they would have told him first.
Lunch was some rolled ham and mayo sandwiches from the new bakery ‘Routledges’, which Eir adorned with salt and vinegar crisps. Draco was apprehensive about the mixing of flavours and textures but once he tried it, he found the northern delicacy delightful.
was he back?
Song: The Mask by Fugees
“The Unbreakable Vow?”
Harry eyed Draco as if he were some kind of alien. “What the fuck is up with you this year? Running about the place like you’ve got something to hide?” Harry squinted at him, “I’ll find out what it is, don’t you worry.”
“Could you give me one? A piercing?”
The summer has come to an end, and as Draco prepares for his return to Hogwarts, he's faces a grave new reality.
Draco liked Niamh’s various silver rings that lined the tips of her ears, so he asked for one of those. When Niamh asked which earring he wanted, Draco pointed to a simple, small gold hoop at the back of a cabinet. Niamh reached inside for the earring, and then cleaned his ears with an antiseptic wipe. Draco prepared for the pain ahead.
“Sorry, was that insensitive?”
“Jesus, that’s freaky.” Draco muttered. Potter’s eyebrows raised in response, and Draco’s cheeks flared as he registered the distinctly Muggle colloquialism.
“No, of course I wouldn’t, you stupid little man, how would I look carrying that down the street? Just don’t sell it.”
does it then imagine how much
Hesitantly, she began to explain. Narcissa was careful with what words she used, legilimency was a great fear of hers. Memories can come back to bite with ease in times of war.
Lucius’ voice cut through the tense silence; “Narcissa, what’s happened?”
“What is it now, Potter? Come to tell me you’ve finally worked out my big secret and you’re going to leak it to The Daily Prophet?”
“... I couldn’t guarantee anything.”
“How do you want your wages then?”
Draco didn’t really know what to say, he was partly confused, but mostly felt a surge of affection for the strange muggle beside him.
Once in his room, Draco neatly folded his muggle clothes and pulled the leather boots off, piling it all neatly in a dark corner. He ran a bath and soaked his bruised body in lavender scented water, which quickly became murky. Clean and warm, he padded to his bed and fiddled with his wand, wishing he could use it. He wanted some flowers, or some turkish delights or whatever. Abruptly his chin trembled and his vision blurred. Ducking beneath his sheets and blankets, Draco’s face screwed up and he sobbed for the first time in years. Ugly hot tears ran down his face and he struggled to breathe. Softness, warmth and honeysuckle sweetness was all he wanted. All he needed. Ever.
“My apologies. He has lately taken to listening at doors, I don’t know what he means by it … you were saying, Narcissa?”
Bella seized her arm and Narcissa was beginning to greatly regret the decision of bringing her along.
Niamh looked particularly confused, and a little frustrated. “Bollocks. Draco, what the
“Draco, think very carefully about what you are saying here.”
It shouldn’t really bother him, Draco supposed — why should he care about what anyone thought of him? But everytime he caught eyes with someone gawking at him in the corridor, he couldn’t help but think that maybe Potter had said something.
Draco furrowed his brows, and having not fully understood, shrugged non-commitantly.
Draco nodded and reflected Eir’s attitude. He didn’t want to mess this up.
.. also Eir (it's pronounced 'eye-ur' for those wondering) is a massive babe
“Good night Draco.”
“Just... keep your head down this year. Concentrate and do not fail Draco. Do not fail us.”
Song: I Gave You Power by Nas
“Nothing, just feeling a bit on edge.”
“... I mean, even Draco said so.”
Draco huffed out.
Potter looked about ready to shove Draco out of his chair. “You—”
But now that he was living and thriving in the muggle world, he found he had more time to consider how he may feel. Draco had never actually been with anyone, and he now wondered if he ever would. Because, he thought bitterly, who would ever want to be with a werewolf?
look ridiculous.”
He practically had, Draco supposed, the burden of the task lingering in the back of his mind.
Draco’s smile faltered. “Excuse me, Professor?”
could.
Blaise looked unconvinced. Vince and Greg shared a look, grinning at each other mischievously.
Draco huffed and tried to get back to his work, but the classroom was too stuffy and the damp heat made him feel at once too present and too detached. Everything was in hyper-focus. His thoughts were muggy, sluggish and incomplete. His hands were clammy and Draco was beyond ready for the lesson to be over as he stared blankly at the book in front of him.
“You know, it’s rude not to look at someone when they’re talking to you, Draco Malfoy.”
However, he always felt slightly uncomfortable around some of the locals, as his accent spoke of years of private education and his aristocratic background. He'd been called a fairy too many times now, so he tried to keep a low profile. Eir would always laugh when it happened, whispering to him that they all idolised Freddie Mercury and Boy George without a clue. It didn’t help Draco with the awkwardness, but internally the tightness in his chest loosened.
And she meant it. Narcissa vowed then to herself that she would do everything in her power to keep her son safe. It was apparent that no one else was concerned for him. Not even his father.
“I bet you’ve got some bird we don’t know about.” Vince declared, his voice dripping with amusement.
Madam Pince gave a short nod in Draco’s direction as he entered. He actually had been spending a lot more time here compared to usual, wasting away his evenings in the name of ‘Studying For N.E.W.Ts’. In actual fact, Draco had been trying to find a moment of peace in a quiet corner at the back of the vast room — away from any unwanted social interaction.
Draco was perched on top of the stool behind the counter, all four long limbs folded like a nervous child being berated. Pale and otherwise sickly looking, one could be forgiven for assuming he is a junkie. Sunken in eyes, fresh scars and exposed splotches of bruises reaffirmed the heroin junkie stereotype.
“Did you learn to do that over the summer?” Luna asked, her face innocent.
“The soul needs feeding. If you don’t do that, the mind and body decay.”
“I wish I was artistic, so I could paint this.” Draco sighed.
A couple gasps escaped people’s mouths as Snape bristled, his bat-like robe seemed to puff out. Pansy whispered in Draco’s ear, “Someone’s gotten too big for their boots.”, and Draco rolled his eyes.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about.” Draco replied, defensive.
Brutality and violence reminded him of his father, Death Eaters and the war currently raging on in the world he found himself increasingly disconnected to. Oppression was something he found himself slowly coming to terms with. Being a werewolf in the wizarding world would mean that finding any kind of decent job or partner or friends in the future would be infinitely more difficult. Draco had always been secure in his privilege and superiority over his peers, but now he was lower than anyone he knew.
“I don’t want you to think I am prying where I’m not wanted, but let me tell you this. Life goes on, the present turns into the past and the past fades. Like cars and trends and clothes, shit goes away, you’ll forget it. Instant comfort when you fail or disappoint or someone hurts you is dangerous, it doesn’t fix anything. It’s all shit that goes away eventually. You’ll just make things worse.”
“You’ve got to make the most of Sunday Lunch, Parkinson.” Draco raised his hands in surrender. “I don’t make the rules.”
“Well who else is going to? Do you want the wonga at the end of the week, month?”
Narcissa took in the black, wavy hair and smudged eyeliner. Her pristine boy was visibly not so, and after all the trouble she had gone to to ensure his survival in the year ahead, she was rather miffed.
Settling in opposite him, Eir begins to express his concerns.
“Draco Lucius Malfoy! Son of a Bludger, where have you
Eir just chuckled and nodded.
We say this every time, but sorry for the long wait on the upload of this chapter! We're both A-grade procrastinators, and we're both at uni now. So no promises about more regular uploads, but maybe we'll get in more productive moods. We definitely want to carry on with this fic, as we love writing it and we love the characters a lot, so don't worry if you don't hear from us soon :)
Draco sighed and pulled his feet up, resting his chin on his knees. He had tried to act as though nothing was wrong, but nothing could change what had happened over summer, and nothing could ease the burden of Draco’s task.
“I can’t, I’m not of age. I can only do magic at school.” Draco was aware he was losing his audience, and reached into his pocket, “But I can show you my wand.”
Draco cast his mind back to third year, with Lupin as their Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. He remembered, with a stab of shame, sniggering with the rest of the Slytherins about the scars on Lupin's face and his shabby robes. He'd looked down on him, never stopping to consider the torment and bravery of his former professor. Draco wondered if he'd meet that same fate. Would he have to spend the rest of his life struggling to find work, living in the shadow of his past?
“Well fuck you too then and get off me.” Pansy shoved at Draco, to which he protested.
A tawny school owl landed near his mug, depositing an envelope. Draco fed it a bit of hash brown before reaching for the envelope as the owl flew off.
Blaise barked with laughter, “I’m not lying — your breath smells like death.”
He couldn’t yet see Eir or Niamh, but The Score by Fugees was playing throughout the shop, so Draco made his way through to the back room. The musty scent of old records and marijuana was stifling, but now came as a comfort to Draco.
Draco felt a great sense of relief as he left the shop, a grim smile plastered on his face as he headed up towards the hustle and bustle of Diagon Alley - he’d done it, the plan had been set into motion. As he turned back on to Diagon Alley, Draco was ambushed by a flurry of robes and bags.
Potter didn’t, his mouth twisting unpleasantly, "There's something different about you this year, Malfoy, and I'm sure I know why. I've been watching you, you're always lurking about, acting suspicious."
“You will do it my son. You will.”
A week after the argument with his father, Draco wrote a letter to Eir and Niamh and explained that he was having family problems and would only be able to see them once more before Christmas. It was brief but the severity of the situation was aptly conveyed, as Draco soon had long replies that Polky delivered to him. Niamh demanded details and suggested he ran away to her place, where Eir simply stated Friday would work best and that he would organise some shifts for the Christmas break if he would like to return to the shop. There was no doubt in Draco’s mind that he was coming back, he needed to.
“Yes Master. Do you need to go somewhere?”
His mother had put him to bed last night, and he felt pathetic. Draco’s head felt hollow, thoughts forming and unravelling at the same time. It was a strain to focus on anything. There was a weight on his chest that made it difficult to breathe. Draco was fever-hot and goosebumps ran up his arms.
“Oi! I wasn’t that bad,” Niamh lowered her voice in imitation, “
“It’s
“Draco. Come.”
Horrified, he locked the doors and revved the engine to escape the shrubbery, when he found his eyes locked with a rather red pair of teenage ones. The boy had landed in the ferns below and was yelling a series of strange obscenities before panting and lying still. John was frozen in his seat with shock, watching the boy’s shallow breaths condense in the morning air.
Draco frowned. “Where is she now?”
“So what does that mean, that there’s a whole other world that we know absolutely nothing about?” Eir looked incredulous.
He gives the young wizard a pointed look. At this point, the boy just nodded not understanding ‘smack’ but was stunned that this slightly grubby man knew he was struggling. No one ever seen through him like this before.
“Narcissa, Draco
Narcissa knew that she should have stayed at Yarrow Manor to watch over Draco, but this was much more important. Her hands shook as she waited to apparate to the top of Spinner’s End to meet her sister. However, there was no doubt in her mind that Draco was with his Muggle friends, and that Polky was taking good care of him.
to do.”
From the corner of his vision, Draco could see Potter dithering about beside his desk, torn between escaping to the other side of the classroom and keeping himself in Sluggy’s good books.
She made a fierce character, with her hair a mass of dark curls sitting atop her angular face and grey eyes. Tattoos decorated her arms, piercings ran up her ears, chunky rings on each of her fingers. She was short and slight in build, often wearing platformed boots to make herself seem taller. She frequently made jabs at Draco and Eir for being ‘giants’. Draco had to chuckle each time she did - if only she knew about real giants. But now her anger made her tower over him, his pep slowly decreasing until he felt like a wet lettuce.
(See the end of the chapter for
get any worse.
Draco broke out of his reverie and involuntarily blushed as Snape suddenly barked out that it was the end of the lesson— and something about his life being infinitely worse due to the existence of this particular class and the ignorant students it supplied.
Inside the van, the were drums sounding and the choir was screeching at full volume, when John noticed a gory, dislocated arm swing over the wall a few yards in front of his van. Throwing his tea in the air, swearing profusely as the scalding liquid seeped into his workmen’s jeans, he gripped the steering wheel with both hands and promptly veered off the road into the ditch.
The full moon passed without too much issue, and Draco was feeling much better by Saturday. Polky had agreed to a final trip to Newcastleton before Draco’s return to Hogwarts the next day.
Vincent was in the middle of a particularly hilarious recount of his disastrous family trip to Malta when a small third year girl timidly entered the compartment to give Blaise an invitation to something called the Slug Club.
She took a deep breath and started again.
“Okay… Eir.”
Draco had seen the Dark Lord practice Leglimancy on unsuspecting Death Eaters over the summer, but he never thought for a second that his professors could do it. It was an obscure and forgotten branch of magic, and it sent his mind into overdrive. What would happen if Professor Snape had seen his transformations? The task? His muggle friends? Being silent wasn’t going to be enough, he needed to protect his mind.
Draco was also surprised to hear about the common violent actions against lesbians and gays in the muggle world. Granted, it wasn’t sunshine and rainbows in his world, but there was legislation to prevent things getting out of hand and most people were open. Though unfortunately, thanks to the Death Eaters there were rising accounts of targeted attacks.
And despite all the
Snape walked past him and Pansy towards Potter and Weasley, and Draco anticipated a fall out — as Snape was looking particularly tetchy.
Draco knew how his friends would react if he told them the truth about what had happened over the summer, and the anxiety hung like a rain cloud at the back of his mind. They couldn’t ever find out, it would be detrimental to Draco’s whole future if anyone actually did. And, if he was correct about his suspicions of Snape being a Legilimens, then he needed to learn how to defend himself. For present and future use. Maybe he should send a letter home, get some help from his mother over the half term? Yes, he would send his mother a letter after they finish their tea.
Draco huffed but didn’t contest it as he recalled the long hours he had spent with Crabbe to ensure him a decent grade. They both knew that he would’ve failed otherwise. Still, Draco couldn’t help his disappointment at being abandoned by Vince to be alone in a classroom full of Gryffindors.
Also, we haven't mentioned it in a while but we have a playlist that you can listen to! Its called 'i never sleep cos sleep is the cousin to death' (original, we know), use the url below!
Potter’s gaze cast about, as if standing in Draco’s presence physically pained him. "Merlin, I can't believe I almost forgot how infuriating you are. Always acting so superior.”
Now, the house closed in around him with it’s pervasive, clammy claws. He was lucky to have Niamh and Eir. Draco pressed himself up against the cold glass, eyes trained on the illuminated garden of kelp below him.
curse on multiple people over the last year. But the way his mother stressed ‘murder’, he knew this wasn’t just some alley cat witch.
“Right. Are you sure that’s all it was?” Blaise looked genuinely concerned, and Draco hated it.
“You are a Dark Creature with the Dark Lord’s blessing and curse. The Dark Lord has his reasons for what he did to us, but this is unjustifiable. Go and get changed into something more suitable.”
Eventually, hunger and the end of the cigarette put an end to his wallowing.
“Yes, that’s exactly what I’m saying. I’m also saying that its kept a secret for a reason, so you can’t tell anyone about it.” Draco gave both of his friends a pointed look.
The two felt like they had come to an agreement. Draco looked at the clock and realised he needed to go, if he were to meet Polky on time. Eir sent him on his way with a reminder to come in tomorrow.
“Yeah but now, the finishing touches!”
“It’s alright, I’ve had a lot of time to think about it.”
Draco had thought that this time might have been easier; seen as he had survived the first. But this was worse, much worse. He felt immobilised by the fever-like feeling, he was restless, ravenous.
Narcissa straightened herself out and mirrored Severus’ body language. She was here for a reason and no amount of distrust on Bella’s part was going to stop her. Severus seemed to sense Bellatrix’s defeat before looking at Narcissa.
“Lucius don’t be ridiculous. He wouldn’t have asked Draco to do it. What kind of a man are you? To put our son, our
“We both know that's because you helped.”
ARGH its been fucking ages since we uploaded! But now we're at home in quarantine and can write without any school work (final exams have been cancelled!) or distractions. We hope everyone's okay at the moment - look after yourselves!
However, the last fortnight had changed his life so suddenly, so thoroughly, he was reflecting for first time in his life. His past actions filled him with an overwhelming sense of shame, and now silence was more agreeable, at least until he understood this new Draco.
“Severus, I know I ought not to be here, I have been told to say nothing to anyone, but -”
The shop had a wealth of information on the more
He didn’t get it, wasn’t Potter supposed to be all for peace and prosperity for all? Why did he continually have to antagonize Draco just for the hell of it? Of course, it was usually the other way round, so Draco had to admit that it was no surprise that Potter would act like that.
“Pathetic, Weasley. Here let me show you—” Snape began to flick his wand when Harry cried, “
Draco’s irritation got the better of him when Borgin suggested that he take the necklace with him.
Draco was speechless, each word felt like a needle to the heart. “That’s not — how could? I —”
me to give you a bloody nose?”
Pansy was smirking at him, mouthed ‘
Draco straightened up to come face to face with none other than The Chosen One himself, Potter. Jesus, could he catch a break? It was like the whole word had been against him that evening. Draco wanted to say something — anything — but it was as if he’d lost the ability to form words. His head felt like it was shrinking, and his chest was painfully tight.
“You see now Draco,” Lucius grabbed his shoulders and pressed their foreheads together, “You are uniquely able to m-murder him. You can restore the Dark Lord’s faith in us.”
“No, I am telling the truth!”
He waited alone outside the classroom, leaning against the wall as he watched the rest of his classmates arrive. The Gryffindors ignored his brooding and waited in chattering groups closer to the door. Draco’s fellow Slytherins stood apart from their red-and-gold clad peers, but no one went beyond acknowledging his presence.
“Oh, fuck off Pansy.”
Since getting a job, Draco had spent a lot of his time curating a collection of muggle clothes that he was really very proud of. In particular, a beat up pair of Docs and skinny, black Levis that he bought at a thrift stall in the fortnightly farmers’ market. Eir and Niamh had donated some of their band t shirts to him, along with an assortment of fleeces and sweaters that had spent too much time at the bottom of cupboards. For once in his life, Draco’s ‘main’ wardrobe wasn’t new and tailored, although still mainly black. His clothes were soft and worn, frayed and baggy, and he loved them all. All the pouches of ‘baccy he was collecting for school were carefully wrapped in handkerchiefs and slid between neatly folded tees and jeans. A new scent of lavender, tobacco and old clung to his skin and clothes, complimenting his new found hobbies.
Potter was glaring at him, seething from across the carriage. Draco wished he could disappear.
“Good one Pansy! Yeah, such a know it all.
“Yeah, I’m fine. It’s nothing.” Draco recoiled in shame at his clipped tone — she was just trying to help. But Merlin, he did not need her pity. “Look — I’m sorry if I was ever nasty to you, but I don’t need your sympathy. I’m doing just fine as it is.” What a fucking lie, wow. He stood up hastily, beyond ready to leave this disaster waiting to happen.
Draco started to feel anxious when they reached the piercing room. Glass cabinets lined the walls, filled with jewelled earrings and dull titanium studs. Draco turned to Niamh, who had just finished taking out and sterilising the piercing needles.
The room wasn’t lit any better than the street, but it had a surprising amount of character. Books lined the walls and an abused lounge set was highlighted by the precariously hung candelabra. Severus gestured towards the sofa and Narcissa removed her cloak before she perched on the lumpy settee. Bellatrix stonily moved to stand behind her, without taking off her cloak.
“Special baccy for the occasion.” Eir grinned.
“Don’t worry, I can see them too.” A lofty voice made itself known from inside the tall carriage. The boys jolted.
The breeze was warm against his skin, and Draco let go of the tension in his shoulders as he began to write the letter for his mother. Their letters had never been very heartfelt, and this was no different. Draco tried to keep his reasons behind needing to become an Occlumens vague and related to The Task — to whatever and whoever he may have to deal with. He didn’t mention his panic attack.
Narcissa knelt down beside him, whispering words of comfort in his ear as she cradled Draco’s head to her chest. Merlin, he felt pathetic. A few moments passed before Draco began to insist that he was okay, feeling like a child as he pushed against his mother’s embrace. Narcissa gave him one last worried look before they headed to the platform, faces grim as they saw the crowd of families waiting to pass through the barrier.
“Draco, darling, are you going to get up?” Blaise’s voice cut through Draco’s sleepy thoughts.
“So where’ve you been? I had to handle a drunk Niamh by myself on Saturday.” Eir laughed and ducked away from Niamh’s swatting hand.
Potter, eyes fixed on the front of the classroom, looked distinctly sheepish,“It wasn’t my fault.” A moment passed in tense silence, “I don’t want to be anywhere near you.”
“What muggle friends? I wouldn’t engage with such
“All done. Looks pretty fuckin sick if you ask me.”
Eir and Niamh were looking up at him with soft expressions, and Draco sensed that they were unsure of how to process what he’d just said. A beat passed before Eir stood up, arms wide as he crossed the room to engulf Draco in a tight hug. Niamh followed suit and shuffled along to hug their legs from the floor - Draco laughed, a sob caught in his throat.
The day passed by with very few customers and many pots of tea, the lack of tourists indicating the end of summer. The door was open as it was still warm outside, a constant chorus of crickets matched the gentle jazz being played on the hifi set.
“Number one: The Beatles and Jimi are kings, no debate.”
“Now that’s just rude. And a lie.”
“Are you okay, Draco?”
Song: Yesterday by the Beatles
"Well, if you're going to be like that, I don't think we could ever get along. You obviously have zero taste."
Potter was sitting at a desk in the middle of the group, Weasley and Granger flanked on either side, seemingly completely engrossed in his note taking. Draco rolled his eyes,
Draco’s eyes darted up to find Pansy Parkinson, Blaise Zabini at her side, weighed down with various bags of school supplies and clutching a melting ice cream in her right hand. They both seemed to be shocked at Draco’s presence.
Monday 16th September 1996
Pushing his way past a group of wizards, Draco groaned in embarrassment as he recalled the incident between himself and Potter while getting his new robes. The constant paranoia of the seamstress moving his left sleeve all the time - possibly exposing his Greyback scar - and the presence of the trio had made him particularly aggressive.
The first few hours back were absolutely humiliating — never in his entire life had Draco felt so utterly pathetic.
“Then you ought to hold your tongue!” Bellatrix exploded, “especially in
always acting superior? Take a look in the mirror, bud.”
“Draco, I don’t —” Luna began, but Draco was already stepping through the door, his thoughts running a mile a minute, not hearing whatever it was that Luna had said.
Pansy made a grunt of agreement, and Greg began to recount some incident with Finnigan he’d had earlier that day. Draco’s cringed — it didn’t seem fun to watch others getting bullied anymore. And it was with a certain kind of clarity that Draco realised just how incredibly pathetic it was to laugh at a fellow student getting bullied by a
“No, I won’t. I don’t want to change, Father.”
Blaise glanced at Draco with amusement. “Well, seen as we’re all without ice cream - should we go to Fortescue's? I’m sweating like a pig.”
He shook out his cloak and robes before striding down the narrow walkway.
“It... is very secret. But -”
long.”
A beat passed. Without looking up from her copy of the Daily Prophet, Narcissa said “You're free for day.”
Draco shook himself, forcing a smile. “It’s fine, I’ll get over it.” He knew it was a lie, and sensed that Eir knew too.
“Evening, boys. You’re the last ones today.”
Draco scoffed. “Uh — no. I most definitely do not ‘have a bird’, Vince. I was just taking my time.”
“Hello Draco, I hope you’re feeling better.” Draco turned around to find himself face to face with Luna Lovegood. Draco groaned, painfully aware of his friends staring.
“I don’t give troll’s arse what he thinks!”
Hope you guys are coping well at the moment! We are fine and apologise for our less-than-satisfactory uploading "schedule".
A clatter of books behind him made Draco jump and whip around his seat, wand raised. Almost forgetting, he hastily ripped off his headphones.
The next full moon was coming up soon, and Draco was becoming more snappy and irritable as his next Change drew closer. He was having trouble sleeping, haunted by the memories of the night he was Turned. His skin felt prickly all over, like a fever, his senses sharpened to an inhuman degree. It scared him, really, that he had so little control over himself.
“So,” Draco drawled, “you know how to fix it?”
Draco scoffed as Borgin bowed deeply in response before he turned to leave the shop, and he uttered a final, firm word of warning to the shop owner.
“Oh for fuck’s sake Blaise…” Pansy covered her face with her hands, failing to hide the tell-tale shake of her shoulders.
A number of miles away, Kielder Water lay still in the hazy sunset. Pine trees, towering above the horizon and browning in the summer heat, hugged the banks of the reservoir. Hues of pastel pink, purple and blue were mirrored in the water, the moon tucked the sun into bed behind the silhouetted peaks. Beneath the glassy surface, silver finned trout and carp circled the glowing kelp-coated towers of Yarrow Manor. Years of algae had stained the thick granite walls a dark shade of green, the Malfoy family crest barely visible above the huge, mahogany doors. Spectral yellow lights formed a perimeter between the manor and the blue-green gloom of the reservoir.
“What the fuck, Malfoy? Watch where you’re going!”
Eir came out of the stock room and looked between the two of them. He quickly came over and gave Draco a hug. Draco finally felt those hot tears breach the dam and he softly sniffled in to his friend’s shoulder. After a while, they relaxed and stepped away from each other.
He felt like death incarnate as his head throbbed along to the pounding of his heart and his hair clung to his sweaty forehead.
Memories of those awful weeks before his first full moon, when Greyback had claimed him as his own, flooded Draco’s mind. The instinctual brutality of the Dark Lord’s followers knew no ends, and the countless, mindless slaughters Draco was witness to made something twist and ache in his stomach. They had wanted him to join them, permanently, but Narcissa had argued Draco’s value in being at Hogwarts. He was extremely grateful.
“My what?”
Lucius’ gaze was cold and calm, Draco swallowed reflexively and his hands were fidgeting with the frayed hem of his Fugees t-shirt.
Soon ‘It Was Written’ came to an end and Draco dressed it in it’s sleeve before putting on a mixtape he made. He hoped Eir liked it - he was still struggling with the technology.
In the words of Ricky Baker: shit is getting real. We hope you liked that, and we're just really proud of ourselves cos it didn't take us AGES to upload this time!
Eir waved his matchbox of cigarettes, with an amused look on his face. Draco remained silent, but nodded in agreement. Eir moved out from behind the counter, and guided Draco to the door.
Draco snorted, “Fucking hell, Potter.”
A painful lump formed in his throat. Draco felt completely helpless as he finally reached the entrance to the Slytherin common room. He took a moment to calm himself, managing to stop the tears from falling before he walked in.
Narcissa blamed herself for all of Draco’s recent changes - he most certainly wasn’t the same boy she’d known before the summer - and she worried about his inevitable return to Hogwarts. How would he cope with the task at hand? Would the other students notice how much her son had changed?
Somewhere outside Kershope forest, along the border of Scotland, a milkman was starting his rounds. It had been an especially scorching week for July, but John was grateful that the humidity hadn’t set in yet for the day as the sun rose. John Armstrong exited his lonning in his van onto the B road heading towards Newcastleton, lined with dry stone walls, wilting bracken and the odd farm steading. He was enjoying a particularly animated version of O Fortuna on Classic FM, while he steered with one hand and drank his tea in the other, speeding past yellowing fields of wild grass and waking sheep.
“He’s going through some kind of mid-thirties angst moment, I guess.”
Song: Superstar by Ms. Lauryn Hill
“So, what can I do for you?”
“Oh come off it, Potter.” Draco huffed and moved to grab his bags whilst Potter performed some only mildly oafish maneuvers to get down from the luggage rack. Harry looked at Draco as if he were some sort of unintelligible philosophical conundrum — Draco had to look away, hastily gathering his things. He couldn’t let anything jeopardise his mission, and it felt as though Potter was looking straight through him.
He was on his way to the Library to hide from Vince during a game of Hide and Seek. Pansy had turned her nose up at their childish antics when Blaise had suggested it, and Draco had only accepted to give him an excuse to hide away for the rest of the afternoon.
come back from this. The
“Right, I have some conditions and rules for you working here.”
“He’s still here, living and breathing.” Draco raised his hand in mock salute. Potter had the nerve to chuckle. Merlin, what was happening? Whatever it was, he needed to reel it in.
“It’s fine, I’m not offended.” Luna turned to meet Draco’s gaze. “I guess that losing someone is like losing a part of yourself. So, even though you’re always trying to find it again, you learn to live without it and grow stronger as time goes on.”
“We all communicate in different ways. You can differentiate between Paul and John, André 3000 and Big Boi or George Micheal and Andrew Ridgeley. And it's like everyone has their own language that speaks from their heart to yours.” Eir touched Draco’s sternum with his forefinger.
Despite everything, Draco couldn’t help but worry for his father. “The Dark Lord has given us a shot at full redemption, Draco. He’s given me a task that will finally bring us back into his good graces.”
They made their way out of the shop and down the street to Niamh's parlour. Eir asking Draco every couple of metres if he was sure that he wanted to go ahead with it. Draco was certain though, he wanted to go back to Hogwarts with a piece of the summer with him. A pile of muggle clothes wouldn’t go down well.
Bellatrix gasped behind them. Narcissa knew it was considerable ask. The Unbreakable Vow was ancient magic, the basis of the Wizarding world. Severus looked deep into her eyes, blankly.
“Sure then.”
Niamh passed Draco a small mirror so he could have a look at her work. “It’s perfect.” He whispered, a grin finding its way onto his face. Eir nodded in approval.
The muggle clothes he had collected over the summer had been rescued by Polky and stored in the elves' kitchen yesterday. So he lay in bed glassy eyed, dressed in a robe. It itched.
Draco's laugh was hollow, “Oh spare me, Potter.
Polky had packed a combination of Draco’s muggle and wizard clothes into his trunk, along with some of Eir’s ‘special baccy’ and various other wizard things that Draco resented greatly. Who needed a golden cauldron or spellotape when there might not be occasion to use them once the Dark Lord reigns? Just quietly tape up a book spine when Death Eaters cleanse Gloustershire of Muggles and Half Breeds? Draco snorted and relaxed into the bath water.
After a few tears and much blinking, Niamh showed Draco how to lightly line his eyes and apply mascara. He looked like a completely different person, like someone who could go to a Muggle rock concert in Camden.
. Well then shall we go to that new bakery that Seeker Weekly reviewed? Sounds like a nice place.”
“Shut up Malfoy, I couldn’t get across the classroom without Slughorn seeing me.” Potter muttered, looking pathetically sulky.
“Do you know why I came back, Draco?”
Draco took a step back from the door as his parents continued arguing in desperate tones. Just as he began to turn away, trying to make as little noise as possible, Narcissa burst out of the room, knocking Draco to the side before stopping in her tracks.
“Yeah, you?”
“Who is it?”
Narcissa spilt a little wine on herself as she set her glass down and gripped Severus' hands between her own. She bowed her head to their hands and kissed them.
Niamh made a move to grab his arm, to check for needle marks he supposed, but Draco flinched back anyways. All she would find was more gashes and a weird rash from a nettle patch he fell in. Alas, the pain and shame was the same, and the guarded look he gave her silenced any further chastising.
Crackling filled the space between them as the needle reached the centre of the record and side A of ‘It Was Written’ stopped turning. Eir got up, flipped the record and repositioned the needle. The intro to ‘Black Girl Lost’ started playing.
“That
Draco raised his eyebrows and gave a small smile "Really?". He looked around the clustered little shop, considering Eir's offer. The walls were covered with film posters, newspapers and magazines as a cheap alternative to wallpaper, and shelves were concave, bursting with records, cassettes and VHS tapes. The counter beside Draco was sticky, plastered with stickers, stained with mug rings and tea splatters. He gestured to the clunky machine with too many buttons, sitting proudly atop the counter and said, "Alright then. But you'll have to show me what to do with that…
Hours later Draco’s palms were sweating as he stood outside King’s Cross with his mother, the brick building looming over them. He shook himself before heading inside at a brisk pace, his feet moving subconsciously through the station as he fidgeted with a loose thread in his pocket.
The voices became clearer, as Draco slowly approached the door. But even with his superior hearing, Draco could only catch fragments. “The Dark Lord… complete trust in him… a mission… been chosen… forgiveness...”
“Well, what do you all think?” He didn’t even try to hide his anxiety — they would see through it anyway.
“That looks like something from a period drama, not the twentieth century.” Niamh remarked.
It was Monday and Draco was lying in bed trying his hardest not to think about his upcoming Defence Against the Dark Arts and Potions lessons with the Gryffindors that afternoon.
Narcissa carefully pinched her right hand pinky between her left hand forefinger and thumb. Draco had found it comforting as a child. Her baby boy. She let out a dry sob, interrupting Severus and Bellatrix. They stopped momentarily before starting again. Narcissa cradled her head in her hands.
been there?” Draco gestured behind himself. Potter looked just as surprised, his face a picture of shock and confusion. “Why have I never seen them before?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Haha! I’ve got you!”
Draco’s heart was beating wildly in his chest. He didn’t want to face his father, didn’t want to learn what his parents had been bickering about. Narcissa looked stunned by her son’s presence, and Draco was sure he looked like a deer caught in the headlights.
The trek up to the Owlery was obscenely long — and involved far too many stairs. Draco made his way up to the tall tower in less than ten minutes, his breath coming out in short, shallow pants and his heart pounding in his temples.
With a childish hex, Narcissa wretched her arm free and stormed ahead. Her arms hugged her body and she let out a silent sob. Quickly, she wiped her tears away and turned onto a cobbled street.
Luna didn’t respond.
Draco sulked alone a little longer until Pansy showed up, and they could head into the classroom. Pansy wittered on about her Herbology lesson as they sat at their usual desk in the back corner of the room. Draco was only half listening— he’d been glad to drop Herbology at the end of their fifth year and found it about as interesting as Professor Binns.
“Y’ alright?”
“Eir, why do you like music so much? I mean, you said that it helped a lot when you were recovering. But why not drawing, boxing, or writing?”
Draco stayed quiet, and his friends had the grace to not pester him.
Sunday 1st September 1996
is a bad movie.”
The door jingled as Draco stepped into the shop. By now, it felt more like a home than the ancient walls of his family’s estates. But the familiar scent of hash and damp permeating from the upstairs apartment never failed to make Draco’s nose crease in faint disgust before he acclimatised.
Eir was right in a way, he supposed.
“We weren’t spying, honest! We were just urm, well. We just wanted some alone time.” The girls both turned a deep shade of scarlet.
Sorry this has taken so long to upload! We've been really busy recently.
Her watch chimed, and she stepped forward. With a pop she was at the top of Spinner’s End and striding down the hill. Narcissa heard Bellatrix appear behind her when some bushes rustled on the bank.
“It’s sick mate, really.”
Blaise waited a moment before clambering on top of Draco, effectively trapping him beneath the duvet. “Oh, for Merlin’s sake, Blaise. Stop, you—you— ” Draco broke off, laughing. He half-heartedly struggled before giving in, letting Blaise’s weight settle above him.
Draco waited until he was sure they were gone before letting his shoulders slump. He sighed, “For
Narcissa gasped and froze. This had been her worst fear, while Bella was delighted. Her mirth was clear. Severus moved from his seat to lean against the window frame, he matched his long, black curtains. It transpired that he knew of the plan, the tension in Narcissa’s body was alleviated slightly. He was choosing his words carefully too.
Lucius had left shortly after leaving his task to Draco, and was ambushed by Aurors on the way back to the Malfoy Manor. Narcissa hadn’t told Draco, but she would have to before Hogwarts started again. He was going to be carrying a lot on his shoulders this year; she wished he was just a normal boy again. As a wife, she was greatly shaken by Lucius’ arrest but as a mother, she felt relieved. Narcissa was, despite everything, a very good mother.
There was a moment of silence before Niamh and Eir broke out into fits of laughter. Draco’s heart plummeted - they didn't believe him. But, Draco supposed, if he hadn’t grown up with magic, then maybe he’d be laughing too.
Draco stood in front of the mirror in his bathroom, still shocked to see his new hair. His mother hadn’t seen it yet, and Draco wondered want her reaction would be — and everyone else’s.
Draco shook his head, “Unfortunately, it’s shut. Florean Fortescue has been compromised.”
company.”
Something dangerous flashed in Lucius’ eyes, and Draco suddenly felt very small. It would be the only time since becoming a werewolf that he felt innocent in the face of Darkness.
Draco felt as if he was drowning outside in Kielder Water when his mother hissed that word. Murder. In a way he wasn’t surprised. He was sure his father had killed someone before and he knew his parents has used the
Song: Waterfalls by TLC
Draco waited outside the Potions classroom and rolled a cigarette. He hadn’t smoked since he last saw Eir and Niamh and so decided it was finally time to break into his stash of muggle wacky baccy. After class he would go to the owlery and climb on to the roof and smoke. Good plan.
.” Draco let out a breathy laugh.
The two friends were hugging each other, Potter’s impish face buried in Lovegood’s silvery hair. And as Harry pulled away, Luna shifted so that she held his face, whispering comfort to him.
Narcissa was struck by Severus’ appearance, as he was wearing a black silk robe, which she noted with some surprise and disgust. His angular, sallow face was pulled tight by a high, scraped back bun. Narcissa had assumed that he would be properly dressed for the meeting, but Severus seemed to lack formality in his own home.
“Is that The Beatles?”
In Shoulder of Mutton, Eir, Draco and a few others crowded around the far end of the pub's dingy bar. It was a Friday night, so everyone from the town and surrounding farmsteads had come in for a couple pints. It was a crowd that Draco loved, the novelty of being just one of the lads never wore off. But unlike them, the swoopy rush of alcohol quickly vanished due his new werewolf metabolism, earning him a reputation.
They both wandered upstairs, Eir was rolling a joint. Niamh had been preparing all afternoon for the evening’s activities. There were semi burnt biscuits scattered around in bowls, and bags of crisps strewn across all available surfaces. Draco noticed the plastic bag full of the necessary items on the kitchen counter and got excited. Finally, the transformation would be complete in time for school.
Before he was Turned, he had always felt close to his mother. And although Draco’s mother had never been particularly warm or compassionate, the Molly Weasley type, he had always been certain in her love for him. Now, it was like she tried to avoid him as much as possible. He knew that she still cared for him, but nowadays her gaze never quite reached him, her hands never reached out to him.
“Eir, can you bring some crisps? I am starving.”
Blaise gave Draco an apprehensive look, “It er, looks great, mate. I like the eyeliner.”
Draco still had no clue what Nas was rapping about half the time. The American muggle slang and culture was completely lost on him but he liked the way the beats and hooks sounded, often finding himself lost in the hypnotic flows. And the lyrics he did understand, he felt strangely connected to.
a-a-affliction will be forgotten.”
“Because I was once where you are now. I used to feel really fucking low, like, all the time. I was lonely, depressed, anxious all the time. I was doing nothing with my life, going nowhere, achieving nothing. I had no friends… I thought smack was the only way to escape it. To get out. Because when I was high, I had no cares. I felt fucking invincible… but I wasn’t. And I guess… I guess I just want to help you before you end up like me.”
Once finished, Draco carefully scanned the room for a suitably unoccupied elf. He spotted one and considered his approach. He couldn’t very well go and demand something, that’s what his father would do, but he also didn’t know how to be polite to an elf. Do they have names? Customs? He knew not to give clothes - that would set them free - but what to do? He walked over to the elf and cleared his throat, the skinny creature swung round and nervously hopped foot to foot.
Draco took a deep breath. “Does it get easier with time? I mean, of course the hurt never leaves you, but — you know.”
“You’re embarrassing yourself, Potter.” Draco was honestly surprised that Potter was suddenly so bothered about him. For the past couple years they had pretty much reached a stalemate. Potter had stopped paying attention to Draco— he'd had much more important things to focus on than petty grudges— and Draco had enjoyed being able to do what he'd wanted. “Did you actually have something important to say?” Draco crossed his arms with what he hoped looked like nonchalance.
“I’m good, thanks.”
“Of course. I wouldn’t let Niamh down.”
Draco was very rarely disturbed, and anyone that did stumble across his hideout were not the sort of people to question his Walkman and earphones. It was risky, but Draco didn’t care — he needed the calm the music brought. From his spot Draco could look out across the valley — and watch the try-outs on the Quidditch pitch. God-damn, he missed Quidditch.
“What about everyone else! What about the questions? And the other Death Eaters Draco? They are already questioning our loyalty!”
Draco faltered — there had been a time when he had been both of those things. He shifted to lay his head back on Pansy’s lap as Vincent fussed with the window, swearing as the blasted thing refused to open. It still hurt to accept his father’s incarceration, regardless of how much of a bastard his father was.
. They’d sooner have dinner with the
Draco awoke in the comfort of his mahogany bed at Yarrow Manor. He couldn’t remember the previous night, it was like he had a mild case of amnesia. It’d been like this the last time too. He could just about summon fragments of memories, remember only the scents of the forest and the coppery taste of warm blood.
“I guess you Muggles have needed to make up for all the stuff we can do with our wands.” Draco had explained the term ‘muggle’ to his friends before, but they still looked at him with slight offence and confusion.
Potter scoffed, stumbling over a desk leg as he reached Draco. “Shut up, Malfoy. I know you’re hiding something and I’ll find out what it is.”
Niamh clapped her hands, giddy. “Noice. Let’s get going.”
What had been a rather good start to the morning had turned into something from a cheap, paperback gothic novel. Dazed, he slowly opened the van door, heaved himself off his seat and went to check on the boy.
“You need aspirin? A fag?”
“Alright then. Let’s get your hair dried and see what we can do about your face.”
Draco wasn’t paying attention as he turned a corner and ran straight into someone, causing him to get a faceful of armpit. And, consequently, a whiff of some truly awful BO.
N.E.W.Ts were starting and schedules were due tomorrow. As well as his first official day of attempting to assassinate Dumbledore. Draco breathed in through his nose and sighed into the bed before getting up and unpacking his trunk. The walkman and cassettes were quickly stored in his designated sock drawer, as well as his eyeliner and mascara. He hid the rest of his muggle items and grabbed his wash stuff. A hot shower was needed.
“What do you mean?” Draco tried to keep his voice level as he swung his legs around to see the intruder.
Lucius stared at him and asked who he thought it was. And the only person other than Harry that entered Draco’s mind, was Dumbledore. But surely not. How could his father kill him? Dumbledore was the most powerful wizard alive - other than the Dark Lord of course. Besides, his father would never be able to get in to Hogwarts.
Snape was slowly making his way towards their desk, his eyes trained on Draco whilst he discussed Inferi with the rest of the class. As he came closer, Draco felt as though there had been some kind of penetration of his mind — as if some growing vines were trying to wrap themselves around his thoughts. He tried to push against it, putting all his energy into trying to fight the invasive tentacles off until the pressure on his mind suddenly disappeared, and the Professor turned away to belittle Granger.

Draco wanted to slap himself, he usually just left and this was highly embarrassing.
Draco huffed in frustration, “Of course you wouldn’t get it.”
, her head bent down as she turned away from him.
Pansy let out a yelp of a laugh, and several neighbouring tables gave them murderous looks. Up front, Snape was giving the rest of the class a particularly dramatic speech about the ‘
The door announced his arrival, which sounded painfully similar to The Glass Onion’s wind chimes. A cluster of shrunken heads watched him as he closed the door. Draco was conscious that he didn’t look like a normal customer. Besides being young, his heavy cloak and slicked back hair signalled wealth.
“That’s better.”
ridiculous.”
rang in Draco’s ears as he walked to Potions. Potter truly was The One that everyone was talking about. Not just surviving The Dark Lord’s attack when he was baby, but the one that the prophecy mentioned. The prophecy that The Dark Lord obsesses over. Draco was sure that not many other people would understand the weight of those words that Snape said, but he did.
So Draco is finally at school! From the frying pan and into the fire. Sorry it took a  w h i l e  to upload, this is a true slow-burn. Thank you for sticking with us and we hope you enjoy this chapter! :)))
"Oh! You mean this lil' beauty?"
In summary:
The familiar echoing allegretto vivace of heels instinctively straightened Draco’s spine and had him cast his eyes down at the marble floor. Narcissa entered the hall and put the jar beside her son on the table before telling him to apply it every three hours to his abrasions. A pervasive, heavy silence filled the air between them as Draco slipped off the table and stood beside his mother.
“Do you mean you teleported here, like in
“Oh, okay.” Lovegood looked relatively unfazed as she turned away from Draco and towards the rest of the Ravenclaws. Draco sighed in relief.
“Number two: you need to come into work sober. No smack or alcohol on the job or the night before. Understood?”
“Don’t you dare - don’t you dare blame my husband!”
Draco found he was still on high alert from the night before, his senses sharp and clear. The faint, lingering smell of his mother’s perfume told him that she had only just recently left him. The sheets beside him felt warm from someone else’s body heat - she had been watching him.
Lucius spun on his heel, his robes swirling around him. He resembled a merman for a split second, slick hair bursting forth from a black sea.
Draco was sitting on a damp and mossy log by the side of the reservoir by the time the sun began to sink below the crest of the horizon. His mother had left him some time ago with a flick of her wrist and a muttered
Draco contemplated the offer. Since the Dark Lord had cursed his family, Draco and Narcissa had been at the summer house to figure out the new ‘normal’. Draco knew his father just couldn’t look at him.
“Thanks.” Draco whispered.
As much as Draco was dreading Potions alone, Defence Against the Dark Arts was a close runner up for Worst Class. It was another Slytherin-Gryffindor group with no other than the Golden Trio themselves and the absolute ignoramus Harry Potter. But, Snape was teaching this year, so Draco was comforted by the promise of favouritism and the humiliation of Gryffindors.
“It might be possible… for me to help Draco.”
to blend in Draco! Not draw more attention! What would your father say?”
“You’re just leaving? No curses or threats?” Potter said.
Draco gave a weak smile as he was handed a massive, chipped mug from some amusement park which was filled with saccharin milky tea. If anyone he knew were to see him now, cradling tea against his chest, no less from a muggle, they would be stupefied. He watched with bewilderment as Eir lifted the needle and changed the record, and sounds from New York city played.
The usual hustle and bustle of the house elves had ceased, and the portraits lining the dim corridor wore smug expressions. As Draco made his way down the hallway, his ears pricked at the hissing of a hushed and heated conversation. A strip of yellow light escaped from the ajar library door.
Niamh had taken to self-harm to deal with the pain she felt, but had stopped some years ago. She had subsequently covered her scars with beautiful, intricate tattoos. She wasn’t ashamed of them, she said, but rather liked the idea of taking something symbolic of her struggle and making it beautiful. She said she’d do the same for Draco if he wanted - he felt touched and excited by the idea of it. He just didn’t know what to get yet.
“Yeah no shit. Sounds like it.”
Slughorn paid Harry’s protests no mind, waving him off and muttering about his ‘humble nature’. Draco barely held back a groan. “Well, now that everyone’s partnered up for the term, we can get started.”
Draco felt distinctly uncomfortable. He didn’t really know what to say — he hadn’t ever experienced losing someone he loved, so Draco doubted that anything he said could be of any help.
“So, what’s up? Still wanting to go ahead with the new look?” Eir glanced at Draco over his shoulder whilst he locked the front door.
Draco cleared his throat, “Stop looking at me like I’m an animal at the zoo.”
His breaths were coming out in short, shallow pants. He clutched at his chest. Draco barely registered Luna laying him down across the seats, her soft voice muting the all-encompassing pain. Draco thought he was dying.
“I reckon he’s gonna last the year. He’s practically in a relationship with Dumbledore, so he’s got that going for him.” Blaise smirked into their mug of Horlicks.
“Certainly, Narcissa. I shall make the Unbreakable Vow. Perhaps your sister will consent to being our Bonder.”
Vincent and Greg were still relatively speechless, muttering protests in response to Pansy’s insult. Draco snorted, anxiety still weighing on his limbs like lead, and turned to board the train. He hadn’t spotted Potter yet, so all was well.
Draco groaned. “Why are you like this? And what makes you think that I was getting with someone on my way back from the Owlery?”
Draco obliged when Narcissa lifted his sweaty neck to pour water down his parched throat, and couldn’t protest when she began to spoon porridge into his mouth. Draco hadn’t realised just how hungry he had been until then, and savored the feeling of a full stomach. He wondered what time it was - it was always dark in Yarrow Manor.
(See the end of the chapter for
With his left ear throbbing and glinting in the sunset, Draco was overcome with a sense of sated happiness as they walked away from the shop.
Today however, an old fleece and worn combat pants would have to do. Draco’s headache had subsided but his skin felt like fire ants were exploring underneath.
“I’ve made my decision. Leave me alone!”
By now, they’d both finished their cigarettes, and Draco felt pleasantly placated. “It’d be good to have someone to talk to, to be honest.” Draco mumbled. Eir nodded his head towards the door, and they headed back inside.
Draco certainly felt ridiculous, bickering with Potter as if they were eleven years old again.
“Luna, how come you helped me the other day? You know, when I was panicking?”
They were breathing heavily. Sweat dripped down his father’s face and Draco grew more and more clammy as his body flushed hot and cold. Lucius’ nails dug into his skin, and his own broke crescents into his palms.
Narcissa hurried along the bank side path and slipped through a rusty gate to walk between the Muggle dwellings. Bellatrix followed her while constantly protesting about the task at hand: Narcissa ignored her. Their cloaks whipped around them as a gust of wind tunnelled down the alley way. The sisters darted between orange patches of light and deep shadows. Bellatrix finally caught up and implored that he was not trustworthy. Narcissa turned around spat:
Draco woke up, face sore and mouth dry, to the sound of a house elf running his bath. The grandfather clock in the hallway sounded seven chimes, and the elf left on the seventh ring. His limbs were heavy, body molded into the bed and he decided to stay there for eternity. Several minutes passed, apathetic and dull. A pop let him know the elf was back, he opened his eyes and saw his muggle boots deposited in the centre of the room, polished and gleaming. The fleece and jeans from yesterday were also clean, waiting for him next to the shoes. Draco rolled over to escape the sight of them, but it was too late, the Beatles invaded his mind and Eir was beckoning him to the Glass Onion. Guilt and curiosity are amazing motivators.
“Psh, that man worships the ground you walk on, you could blow up the classroom and he’d praise you.”
Eir chuckled, “I take it we haven’t then.”
“Yes, I get it — okay? Good. Lets go.”
“My idiot radar’s going off, I see Potter on the horizon.” Millicent Bulstrode indicated behind Draco.
Queen was blaring from the radio and Niamh was dancing. In contrast to the stiff balls he had attended as a kid, Muggle dancing was a lot freer. Or rather, Draco suspected, his parents had kept him separate from other influences. As Eir and Draco entered the kitchen, they joined in on Niamh’s boogieing. Draco had mastered the ‘step and sway’, as well as an assortment of limb flailing and jumping combinations.
They still had over an hour before they arrived at Hogwarts, and Draco couldn’t help but smirk at the idiocy of his rival — what was Potter trying to achieve? Wouldn’t someone come looking for him, eventually? Unless The Weasle and Granger were in on it too — bloody typical.
will have unlimited access to Dumbledore starting in September.
Niamh had been showing Draco a new piercing she had gotten, and he enquired about the process of getting one. Piercings weren’t popular in the Wizarding world, people favoring long pendants and hats as accessories. However, Muggle fashion was interesting and diverse, Punks and American Emo youth were particularly interesting. They inspired a sense of civil disobedience that Draco loved and hadn’t been properly exposed to as a cultural phenomenon.
“No- I mean, yeah. I guess. It’s different though.
“Well that was fucking weird, care to explain yourself?” Blaise clamped their hand down on Draco’s shoulder, making him jump.
“Oh, she died when I was little.” Draco looked over at Luna, her face strangely serene. “I’m sorry.”
The wizard looked appalled at Eir’s direct attitude for a moment, before answering that he indeed was not a local.
“Well, the new Nas record came today, so fucking brilliant mate.”
The three discussed the issue at hand, regularly interrupted by Narcissa’s sobbing. The tiny room wasn't very well ventilated, so the windows slowly steamed up. As the temperature climbed, so did Narcissa’s hysteria. The trio ultimately clarified that Draco’s life was of no value to the Dark Lord, and that Dumbledore needed to die by the end of the year.
“That’s cheating! I found you!”
It was the unmistakable boom of someone apparating. Eir was startled and Draco sighed, he knew it was time to go home. A moment passed before the shop wind chimes tinkled and the door opened, revealing a stiff, middle aged woman in a long, ebony coat. He had hoped it was the house elf.
A moment passed, and Draco was beginning to feel immensely stupid before he heard a barely audible “
Narcissa lost all composure again. Bella would never understand, she wasn’t a mother, she barely functioned as a sister. Bella was wholly devoted to the Dark Lord. Nothing could ever compare.
Eir knelt in front of him and placed a hand on his shoulder, “Draco, I think you have been on a bad bender. We can get you some help. How ‘bout that?”
“Yeah, yes I do. Could you take me to the muggle town near here?”
Draco watched as Gryffindors and Slytherins filled the rows of desks, each house keeping to themselves. Insults were hurled back and forth from Gryffindors and Slytherins alike. Draco groaned inwardly, already willing time to move faster. When Snape declared that it was a theory lesson, and that they should get their books out, Draco felt ready to spontaneously combust.
Eir grabbed Draco’s shoulders and moved him to the only proper chair in the shop. Draco curled up on it and lifted his head to give his friends a weak smile. He cringed at his feebleness.
“Everybody take your seats!” Slughorn ordered, “No shuffling about— Finnigan, sit down!”
“You’ll show me more music?”
“What? He would’ve told me off.” Potter shifted uncomfortably in his seat.
Slowly easing the teen into a sitting position, he edged the fleece over his head and supported his weight with his arms. He then lifted the boy to his feet, and was grateful to see the fleece had preserved his modesty until his knobbly knees. A few shaky steps and they were in the van and off to the GP’s house with four pints of milk and a medical emergency.
“Blowing smoke rings. It’s very difficult, my father prides himself on being able to do it.” Luna leaned in conspiringly, “But I’d say that he’s actually not as good as you.”
Niamh excitedly put the hair dryer down and went to the plastic bag. She flashed an eyeliner pencil and some mascara at them both.
Draco kept his head down and ignored the vicious looks he and his mother were receiving - the nasty comments muttered under other wizards’ breaths as they pushed through the throng. Everyone knew about Lucius’ arrest, and they all had something to say about Draco’s appearance. Draco was sure they all believed he had received the Dark Mark — sold his soul to a diabolical cause.
He started crying again, but this time his face didn’t scrunch up like a pug, his tears slid from lush lashes and his breathing leveled. Gradually, Draco slid down and hugged his pillow, humming all the while.
“My friend taught me how to do it, but she’s way better than me.” Draco watched as Luna walked over to a mottled grey, scraggly looking owl to pet it. “I’m trying to make the rings turn into different shapes.”
. You are a
“Oh — for God’s sake — just fuck off, Potter.” Draco huffed.
“For Merlin’s sake Draco, we were worried! We sent so many owls to Malfoy Manor we thought someone would demand a restraining order!”
As Draco was settling into the rhythm of the work, someone was tapping their foot against the floor and he struggled to concentrate as the minutes ticked by.
“Thanks for the support, Nott.” Draco quipped.
Lucius was largely at fault, she admitted that, but no one else was to know that. Their honour was slipping. Honour was their only meaningful asset besides money, and it made her very uncomfortable. Severus and Bella were still arguing, but she could sense Severus was winning. He was extremely good with words, which Narcissa appreciated.
Sitting on the window sill, Draco looked out into the murky depths of Kielder Water. When he was little, he loved coming to the manor in the summers. Draco had always marveled at the gatehouse and slate steps and magic of the ancient home. He’d spent hours sitting by the window, trying to spot fish or merfolk. The long corridors and vast, empty rooms provided infinite hiding places in which he’d read until dinner.
Draco lowered his wand as he registered that his attackers were in fact two sheepish Hufflepuff students that looked to be in their fourth year.
’. You do know that, right?”
“Oh, fuck you.” Draco huffed and rolled over to press his face into his pillows.
Blaise, bless them, cleared their throat, clearly thrown by Draco’s sudden change in attitude. “Erm, well. From what I could tell, he only invited influential people, or people who are just really good at Potions.” Draco flinched, Blaise’s eyes widened. “Not that you’re bad at Potions! I just doubt he would’ve wanted to invite the son of a convicted Death Eater…” Blaise cringed.
Narcissa sucked in her breath and closed her eyes for a moment. Draco knew he had pushed it too far — Father was in prison and he was basically sentenced to death. He didn’t like hurting his Mum.
Blaise gave him a Look. “We were doing a puzzle this evening, where were you?”
Soon they were all sitting in the Great Hall enjoying hash browns, eggs and beans. Draco sipped his tea, missing Eir’s extensive herbal tea collection. Soft thuds sounded around the hall as the morning post was delivered. The wonderful thing about the first morning of the year is that everyone receives post, as the timetables are delivered by owl.
Borgin and Burkes was the Wizard equivalent of a Muggle taxidermy come antique oddity store. It had a strange, deeply unsettling atmosphere that left many vowing never to return. But the more savoury types always came back.
Draco eyed her for a moment— he had been more concerned about his inevitable boredom, not whether or not a Gryffindor had hurled some sort of abuse their way.
“Okay, princess.”
“I told you, I was at the Owlery.”
“Oh really? Thank you.”
“Well I have got to pay you if you’re going to work here.”
His mother sounded distressed. “You can’t do this, Lucius… we’ve been punished enough… no redemption…”
“Want a cuppa then? We’ll talk about it.”
Draco took the stairs two at a time, his pulse racing. Shame clouded his vision, his legs felt like lead, panic was beginning to take hold. He kept his head down as he stormed down the corridor, ignoring anyone he came across. A few jeered at his new look — but he had never been popular, so he was used to it.
He swallowed bile as he entered the grimy shop.
The last month had been a nightmare. The Malfoy’s and Black’s had always been proud, pureblood families with ancestry dating back to the Medieval ages, which administered plenty of pressure for all affiliated. The Dark Lord was the radicalised essence of the drivel that drove many of the pureblood families, and his father. It was this that lead to his father’s punishment. Shame, dishonour, humiliation. Draco was suspicious of muggles, muggle-borns witches and wizards and half-bloods, he was always told they were lesser. But lately muggles had been kinder than his own father. And he was a dark creature, a monster. Not any better than the scum on a muggle’s shoe.
The song at the beginning of the chapter is I Can't Go To Sleep by Wu-Tang Clan. Would recommend that you listen to it w headphones - chilling.
A couple of days after his transformation, Draco felt infinitely better. Polky had agreed to apparate him to the Glass Onion, and he now stood just off the main road, trying to build up the courage to cross over to the music shop. It had been almost a week since he last saw Eir, and Draco was sure that Eir would think that he’d ‘gone off the rails’ again.
Blinking as his eyes adjusted to the brightness of the room, he suddenly felt keenly embarrassed and exposed, and glanced down to see that he was indeed still wearing the fleece he’d been put into earlier that morning. A wave of shame overwhelmed him as he thought of someone seeing him so vulnerable and defenceless.
Draco wasn’t a killer, he couldn’t do what his father needed. At school he was known for being a bit of a bully - and often hexed people for no good reason - but working for Professor Umbridge and the Dark Lord were two very frightfully different things. He was too exhausted to feel angry, but somewhere in Draco’s mind he thought his father was a coward.
Bending down to feel the clammy forehead of the teen with the back of his hand, John asked
“Penny for your thoughts?”
Narcissa turned and walked away swiftly, the striking of heel against stone resonated in the empty manor. A portrait hissed at Draco as he picked up the jar and exited the hall quietly after his mother, making his way to his room.
They stopped as they turned to go - Pansy stood staring at the side of Draco’s head. He raised a self-conscious hand to his ear, realising what she was looking at.
Potions was seemingly off to a good start. Draco stood at a slight distance from the other Sixth Year Slytherins, listening to their banter. He caught Theodore Nott stealing glances at him every now and then, causing his neck to prickle hotly. Draco liked Theo— he was genuine, didn’t care much for gossip, and seemed less interested in the Dark Lord’s ongoings than the rest of the pureblooded Slytherins. And, Draco had to admit, he was fairly easy on the eyes. He flushed as Theo sent another searching glance his way.
“So, where’re you wanting it?”
Draco’s hands had been shaking when picking at his dinner, and he wasn’t able to meet anyone’s gaze when his friends had asked what happened. Draco couldn’t bloody well tell them that
Everyone was on high alert, and it seemed like every other house thought that all Slytherins were murderous supremacists. Which was just ridiculous, and Draco worried for the first years and the abuse they’d receive. Of course, there was some sort of truth in the rumours — obviously, Draco’s own family were heavily involved — but they were children, for Merlin’s sake, and he highly doubted that anyone in the younger years were very clued up on the inner workings of the Dark Lord’s plans.
As his fingers became increasingly wrinkly, Draco hummed the tune to Octopus’s Garden. His reverie was broken when a loud knock came from the door, followed by Blaise’s voice.
Draco felt uneasy stepping into Yarrow Manor that evening. The fresh piercing was now a dull ache at the side of his head and he was contemplating getting a tattoo next week. After they had left the parlour that evening, Niamh, Eir and Draco had then spent too much time and money in the pub. Draco’s head had been pleasantly swimming.
“Well, I think it could be very beautiful.” Luna wandered over to the windowsill and sat across from Draco. “And what a beautiful sunset, too.”
A slow-moving mass of students formed as they all tried to leave the Great Hall, and Draco’s hope that they could put their reputation of being Scary Sixth Year Slytherins to use was swiftly dampened as they shuffled along with the rest of the crowd.
Peering up at John with one eye open, a brief look of confusion took over the boy’s features. After looking at him for another two seconds John added, “Maybe I should lend you a jumper?”. He received a slow nod of the affirmative nature and John went to the van to get his spare fleece.
“Stop being a smart-arse, Malfoy.”
But despite this, he just couldn’t bring himself to talk about everything that had happened, because saying it out loud made it real. “Not really.”
Draco took a deep breath, and suddenly his heart was beating very fast. Honesty wasn’t something that he was taught as a child, but it was something that Muggles cherished.
Draco sighed, and he could feel the pull of the moon in his shoulders. “I just need you to tell me how to do it.” Sweat formed on Borgin’s brow, and he licked his lips in a nervous gesture. Draco was surprised he wasn’t in similar shape.
If he wasn’t dead.
“Uh huh. Sending a letter home doesn’t take
Draco wondered if he was losing his mind, he knew that could happen to victims of the curse. He vaguely recalled that it had happened to a classmate’s parents, but he couldn’t place whose.
In the bath he sunk beneath the bubbles and held his breath until his lungs burned and his ear canals were swamped. It was warm, hushed and soothing like a mother’s womb. Afterwards he dressed in his muggle clothes and went to the kitchen, rubber soles creeping along the dark halls. Since being bitten, the elves had become an unusual source of comfort and remorse. The creatures had often been the victims of the Malfoy’s cruelty, lesser beings lucky enough to be serving a pure household. Dirty rodents that Lucius used to teach Draco the importance of hierarchy, tradition and punishment. Now he was on their level, perhaps lower, and it wasn’t lost on the elves. They didn’t trust each other, but Draco didn’t hurt them or taunt them anymore. So in return, the elves allowed him into the kitchen to hide and eat.
Draco followed her gaze to look out onto the valley, the mountains a harsh silhouette against the blended shades of pinks and oranges. The surface of the lake rippled as a soft breeze sauntered across the landscape. Draco often resented that he was so accustomed to the view, because it genuinely was just so beautiful, and he almost never took a moment to appreciate it.
“The Dark Lord trusts him, doesn’t he?”
Quietly the wizard introduced himself, “I am Draco Malfoy, could you show me some more music?”
Blaise chuckled beside Draco. “Pansy, darling, your ice cream has completely melted.”
Severus flicked his wand to a wall of books and a yelp sounded as a hidden door flew open to reveal a narrow staircase and a weasley man. Wormtail wrung his hands, one of which was covered in a gleaming silver glove. Severus sneered at him, and called for some elf-wine before dismissing the other man.
(See the end of the chapter for
Peeling back the covers, he eased himself out of the creaking bed. A pile of muggle clothes were left on a chair and he hurriedly put them on. He then made his way towards the closed window and saw that he was on the ground floor, so he pushed open the window and left the clinic.
was not an enjoyable film, due to its completely lacklustre characters and slow-moving plot, whilst Eir was trying to counter with the philosophical points raised throughout the film. Draco watched their faces and gestures placate as Niamh and Eir realised that their pints were finished and the discussion was going nowhere.
At this time of the year, Draco and his friends liked going on walks throughout the grounds to soak up the last of the summer sun. In their second year, Pansy had found a secluded beach area behind the castle where they spent many hours jumping in and out of the freezing water or lying starfish-like on the bank.
Potter straightened up, pointing an accusing finger at Draco. “No,
“Uh —
Blaise was perched on the armchair in the room watching the boys pull on socks, comb hair and straighten robes. Their sharp eyes pierced Goyle’s duvet and they sent a sharp gust of icy wind with a swift flick of their wand.
Eir couldn’t seem to contain himself, his shoulders shaking with silent laughter.
Rolling over to his left side, Draco discovered the various healing potions and ointments littered across the surface of his bedside table. His heart squeezed, tight and uncomfortable in his chest.
“Are you going for some sort of record, Draco?” Pansy gave him an incredulous look.
, I don’t need your help! I don’t know what happened, but it wasn’t serious and it probably won’t happen again, so yeah. Thanks but just leave me alone, okay?”
“Well thanks, Niamh. Feels great.” Draco grinned at his friends. They hadn’t quite grasped the concept of the wizarding world, but Draco supposed that they never truly could.
Sunday 1st September 1996
“Your Ma is gonna be pissed mate.”
“What the fuck are you doing spying on me?” Draco had lowered his wand, but still had his guard up.
Having never done this before, Draco feigned nonchalance as, with trembling fingers, he attempted to strike the match. Watching a few more of Draco’s attempts, Eir took the matches and lit the cigarette for him.
“I don’t know what you’re trying to say, Potter.”
Draco found his owl — a large, tawny eagle owl Narcissa had picked out for him during their trip to Diagon Alley — and attached his letter to her leg. “It would be very helpful if you could make this a quick trip, Nuwanda.” The owl ruffled her feathers, snapping at him until he gave her some treats. “For fucks sake, could you go now please?” She squawked at him one last time before she took off, visibly taking her time about it.
Vince nodded, pointing his spoon at Draco. “Yup, and he’ll definitely be giving the Gryffindors hell this year too, which’ll be fun.”
Draco’s heart squeezed as he looked away from the intimate moment. He missed Eir and Niamh, and desperately wished for the mind-numbing calm of his carefully stowed away music.
“Everyone, you should all be taking notes from our Harry here. Building bridges and setting aside his differences by choosing to partner up with Mr Malfoy over there.”
Clearing his throat, Draco kept his voice steady and eyes level with Borgin’s as he explained his predicament. A deep sense of self-loathing welled up in his chest as Draco recalled all the years in which this behaviour came naturally to him; and the damage it had caused.
As Niamh pierced the needle through his cartilage, Draco found it wasn’t all bad. In comparison to the recent transformation he’d experienced, it really was nothing to fuss over, Draco reasoned.
Draco shifted under Blaise’s weight so that his lungs didn’t feel so tight, and Blaise looked up, their chin on Draco’s chest. “You have really bad morning breath.”
Draco groaned as he turned to see Potter, having left Weasley and Granger mid-conversation, weaving between desks towards him.
Draco felt his heart squeeze in affection for Niamh as she bickered with Eir - they’d become quite close over the past weeks. Just a few days prior, she’d seen some of Draco’s scars on his arms, and showed him her own. In a moment of uncharacteristic vulnerability, Draco spent the rest of the afternoon talking with Niamh about their families. Draco had found it strange, that he felt comfortable talking about his parents and the cold, oppressiveness of his upbringing with Niamh.
Niamh took them all inside and showed them her drawings and equipment. Draco was fascinated to see the instruments, neon lights and crude remarks etched into the walls, but simultaneously beautiful art and complete free expression.
Well done Potter, 1-0.
A deafening crack resonated off the forest, amplified in the lake’s bowl. Retching soon followed and the night sky was shattered as a ripple broke out from the centre of Kielder Water. A cross appeared dripping and green, succeeded by the small, eighteenth century watch house that served as the gate to Yarrow manor. Smooth, slate stones rose soon after and Narcissa Malfoy dragged her disorientated son across them, into the building.
He panted and rubbed his face, pulling his eyelids and lips all directions. Unbeknownst to Draco, Narcissa’s hand was resting on his door, her feet silent without her heels. She knew he couldn’t cast a silencing spell and had been listening to his ordeal through the door. Lifting her hand from the door to her lips, she left to go to bed again. Draco sniffled and remade his cocoon in his bed, leaving the lamp on.
“Family Draco, is everything we are. We are pureblood. We are
“Well — have fun with that.” Draco could barely get the words out. “You tell me in Potions if you find anything interesting.” He mock-saluted Potter as he turned to continue his journey back to his dorm.
Bella was the same during their teens. The subtle changes and then all of a sudden being so distant, intense. The only thing that they could ever talk about was the war, and now they couldn’t even agree on that.
The door of the Glass Onion swung open and sent the wind chimes into song as Draco shuffled into the shop. Over the last few weeks he had learnt how to use the till, muggle money and the record player as well as what a junkie was and how very similar it was to his furry little problem.
Draco woke himself up by his screaming. Sweating and shaking and spluttering, he frantically turned on his bedside lamp and watched the shadows leave the room.
"I wouldn't ever accuse it of being beautiful."
“I can show you some techniques to help.”
“No? Perhaps this will make you more confident.”
“Yes,
After spending pretty much everyday with Eir, Draco had learnt that, despite his love for the rock and punk classics, Eir had a deep appreciation for Nas. Eir had once confided in Draco that Illmatic had helped him through recovering from his relapse two years prior.
Draco thought about the Dark Lord and his followers. Besides their fear and hysteria, their eyes seemed soulless. He was always told that half bloods, dark creatures and muggles had no souls, but he knew he had one. And his was hurting, in need of nourishment.
Quickly glancing down, he saw his arm was limp, a crusty gash ran up his forearm to meet his dislocated shoulder.
Draco was beginning to seriously regret his decision to have such a drastic makeover when he caught a glimpse of Hogwarts students ahead of him, and had to duck around a corner to catch his breath.

“You gonna hex me, or are you just gonna glare at me until I disappear?” Potter smirked, dimples forming in his brown skin. Draco’s neck prickled, uncomfortably hot.
Draco curled up in a foetal position, his arms hugging his folded legs, knees knocking his wobbling chin. His red eyes welling up, but the tears wouldn’t come. He stared vacantly at his dark room. The house was only illuminated by fat, beeswax candles that dripped onto their brass holders.
At this, Niamh and Eir stepped forward to inspect the hawthorn wand, and all of a sudden, Draco felt distinctly odd. Because despite carrying his wand around all summer, Draco hadn’t even felt the urge to use it.
“My father is what happened. And- and I apparated.” Draco felt ridiculous, it was just over a week since his father had used the curse on him, and he still felt dizzy and fatigued. Plus, now Eir and Niamh were looking at him like he’d grown a second head.
Saturday 7th September 1996
Niamh swore, “Did you just-”
It would be bliss to just disappear into the world of Muggles and leave all of this behind.
, alright! I take it back - just please stop pushing me!”
Part of the reason why we've taken so long to upload this chapter is due to the transphobic comments made by J.K. recently. For a while, we didn't feel comfortable about continuing with this story, as other people have fully removed the Harry Potter series from their lives, and we definitely DO NOT support her views at all. Our fic is obviously not canon-compliant, and as queer writers we will/do include lots of queer representation. So, fuck J.K.!
Draco pouted like a petulant child, “I will be needing you to exit my chambers now. You’ve hurt my feelings.” He nodded towards his curtains.
When it was time to close up shop, Eir presented him with a homemade mix-tape. He explained that it was some homework for Draco to study, which he felt honoured to do.
A moment of silence followed. Draco realised that there was no way that he could pretend nothing had happened, and so decided that since Lovegood was relatively harmless, he would just go along with it. With caution.
Eir leaned in closer to Draco. “Hey, what’s up with you? You’ve been really out of it this evening.”
Wednesday 28th August 1996
“Yes, I feel fucking brilliant, she’s just crazy is all.” Draco spat.
“So, how come we can all see them?” Draco glanced at Luna, expectant. She seemed to consider her answer, and Draco started to feel anxious as Lovegood’s expression turned sorrowful.
He didn’t really like the fact that he’d become so dependent on the cigs; he didn’t like having no control over his impulses. Especially when he was feeling so awful. But he found that he relished the much needed relief they offered.
just because you were afraid to upset that buffoon?” he hissed.
It was the morning before Draco’s second transformation, and the werewolf lay atop his bedsheets, the cool, damp air in the room chilling his sweat-slick skin. Draco felt as though his whole body was on fire, his skull being ripped in two. The goosebumps and prickles on his skin made him shiver. His dry tongue sat heavy within his aching jaw.
Lucius flicked his hair and adjusted his robe before turning away from his son, signalling the end of the conversation. Draco suddenly felt cold, and his chest tightened.
Narcissa and Bellatrix entered.
A groan was his answer.
A moment passed before Draco willed himself to look back up at his friends.
His father had become more and more paranoid, short-tempered, manic; the betrayal and hatred burned in Draco’s chest, hot like acid.
“Wait!”
“It’s a piercing.” Draco squared his shoulders, defensive.
Draco cursed under his breath before turning to sprint around the corner from his friend. “No you bloody well haven’t!” He yelled breathlessly, barking out a laugh as he ran past some bewildered looking first years.
Song: The World Is Yours by Nas
“Possibly…” Borgin was infuriating to deal with, and Draco was beginning to lose his patience as the pathetic man tried to dance around committing to the task at hand. He couldn’t afford any setbacks and Borgin was the only person he could realistically use.
Narcissa drew Draco slowly behind her as Lucius stopped his pacing and turned to stare into the ashes of the cold hearth. Draco reached down to squeeze his mother’s hand, and he suddenly felt like he was a small child again.
A smirk found its way onto Draco’s face, “Oh you know, just here and there.” He shrugged non-commitantly, trying to keep up a playful pretense. Pansy swore under her breath and shared a Look with Blaise.
Draco watched as realisation played across his friends’ faces. Blaise stepped forward to place a hand on Draco’s shoulder, their face grave. Pansy shot Draco an odd look from where she stood.
“-if Lucius hadn’t-”
. We are
Eir set the needle down, and string instruments sounded. Draco started cheesing as the opening beats played.
“If you are imagining I can persuade the Dark Lord to change his mind, I am afraid there is no hope, none at all.”
“Potter! What a surprising and wonderful show of diplomacy!” Slughorn suddenly boomed from the front of the classroom.
Eir was opening the shop when he saw the kid outside, just staring listlessly at the hand painted sign. It struck him that he must have looked like that once too, and went outside to offer him a cup of tea.
Draco muttered his thanks, and swiftly left the room, his lips twitching upwards as he made his way to the kitchen.
