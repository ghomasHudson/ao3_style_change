Draco became so caught up in his thoughts that he nearly fell off his perch when the staircase suddenly lurched to admit the object of his obsession. Clinging to the stone for dear life, he willed his fluttering, panicked heart to settle after the scare.
That flat-faced, dead-behind-the-eyes Ukranian has nothing to offer beyond his six-pack. You have terrible taste in men.
After a light lunch of stale bread, hard cheese, and lukewarm pumpkin juice, Harry laid down in a bit of shade for a rest. He'd had a crap night of sleep (again) and had been working harder in the last 15 hours than he had since retiring from the force. He was asleep almost as soon as he closed his eyes.
Draco twitched a little as he noted Potter's inattention to his perfect arse. And it was perfect, dammit! Why couldn't Potter appreciate it the way Draco thought he should?
Draco allowed Harry to control their stride as the Slytherin grew used to having someone inside him. It was only a little different than what he had imagined (he had thought the experience would be excruciating, but was happy to note it wasn't nearly so bad, quite possibly thanks to his years of intense wanking in there.) Once he was certain he could move he began to slowly thrust back, squeezing Harry tight as he fluxed his hips and lower back.
He planted his feet flat on the mattress and gripped the slats of his headboard for leverage. It wasn't perfect--that would require the use of his hands--but thrusting in the cradle of Draco's arse, virtually deflowering him but for a technicality of position, was damn close to it.
He freed Harry's member with a tug on his trousers and pants, leaving them at the Auror's ankles. He couldn't help but stare once he finished his task. The Auror's cock wasn't gigantic (like the rumors said), but it was thick. The vein throbbed, the head already glistened with the first sign of precum, and the skin (flushed now in a dark-pink) was a shade different than the rest of him.
When they arrived, they were greeted formally by the maître d' standing tall at a dark podium and immediately led to their table by a fancy-robed hostess. She tittered a bit at the idea of seating 'the Harry Potter' but at least she wasn't rude to Draco (whether because she didn't recognize him or because she was more professional than that, Harry didn't know).
He'd skipped the afternoon meal in favour of his experiments because he was nearing a breakthrough. To make matters worse, it seemed his metabolism was heightened in this form--his gut was on the verge of digesting itself.
Draco smiled to himself as he decided it suited the hero rather well to have such an...eclectic arrangement of furniture.
"You're ridiculous," Potter chuckled. He gripped Draco around the middle and shook him on the desk, pretending to wrestle. "I don't know how much of this is the ferret in you but I hope at least some of it stays," he confessed. Draco latched onto his hand with his forepaws and kicked at him with his back, feeling the freedom to be a good deal more silly than usual. He could grant that this unwanted transformation had had an unexpected benefit or two.
"If you're this frisky now, I wonder how you'll be if we have sex?" Draco chuckled darkly. "Shall we rut and save the suck for later, you beast?"
If he were to be harshly critical, neither element was particularly special on its own (besides the fact that Harry had made it, which was more than just "special") but the combination itself gave rise to new texture and a delightful mix of hot and cold that Draco had never experienced before.
Malfoy, for his part, was coated in a sheen of perspiration and his hair had come completely unbound. It framed his face with wild, sweaty tendrils, his deep-set eyes were fever bright. And he was grinning like a loon.
Granger and Weasley were obvious even to me (before they knew it, I suspect). I agree that the word 'inevitable' applies. Good for them.
Harry wasn't sure he liked the glint that sparked in Malfoy's quicksilver eyes (though his cock, ever the optimist, was encouraged by it).
"Running away already? Do I really scare you that much?" Draco asked with a dramatically sad sigh. He drank deeply from his glass, enjoying the burn in his throat. He didn't bother with prudence when it came to drinking as his tolerance was so high due to years of forced consumption at formal parties and social gatherings required of all "proper" pure bloods. Drinking like a fish was practically embedded into his DNA.
Draco chose to forgo his next nap in favor of writing letters: one to Gringrotts to ask about Harry's official title, another to his father to let him know he would not be available next Wednesday (but didn't mention it would be because of dinner with a "mudblood" and Weasley), and the last to his mother asking if she would send more expensive chocolates from that gourmet chocolatier he liked. He set them all aside for sending later as he couldn't send them while staying with Harry (he didn't want to accidentally alert anyone to where the man lived somehow and he had promised to avoid contacting people). After, still choosing to avoid his usual cat nap, he decided to read (in the nude, of course) until Harry returned.
I was right: the gloves do look good on you. So did the smile you sported when you opened the last gift (I admit--I spied). This one is not so thrilling, but it's almost just as old. Since you haven't got an appreciation for quality lager, I hope you'll enjoy this wine.
Draco was holding his quill loosely, running theoretical antidote variations through his head, when an ominous burble and snap sounded from behind him. He turned just in time to see the potion erupt in a thick plume of purple smoke before exploding violently--coating him in hot, sticky goo.
Draco held out a hand when asked and quickly made work of the door, pushing it open. His arm returned to its place around Harry neck as his eyes roamed about the room. It was far more impressive than Draco would have guessed, despite the place being an ancestral home (after all, the man had mismatched furniture in his sitting room and apparently no matching silverware either.)
Draco, with his slightly quirked lips and piercing stare, seemed serious about his intentions. It wasn't that Harry wasn't interested. He was, with reservation. But...
"It'll be an early bedtime with no treats for you, Edward," Andromeda informed her grandson, frown severe. "And you'll go straight to the bath when we get home," she added, eying the sticky mess with distaste.
Concentrating on his food, and the fact that it was such a rich chocolate, definitely had a relaxing effect. He sucked on his thumb and then practically fellated his own middle digit. He placed the rest of the cookie into the bag, to save for later, and then proceeded to clean his fingers--not noticing the spot on his lip.
The whole affair had not been terrible. Granger asked questions Draco was far too happy to answer that caused Weasley and Harry alike to choke on their food or drink--mainly about Draco's take on several different toys, favorite sexual positions, and hot spots along the male anatomy. Granger claimed research, but Draco suspected it was revenge on Weasley. Either way, his once non-existent affection for the bushy-haired woman rose a few quarters in Draco's books.
"You forgot?!" Harry hissed, pulling his trousers on and keeping an ear trained on the ruckus below to assess how many people were in the building and what the level of threat was. "That bloody bint has tried to
He was being modest. Some kinds of boasting were fine, but saying, 'I can easily hold my own against three skilled wizards,' seemed off-puttingly prideful (even if it was true).
But the events of the last few minutes had left him with a sour stomach and sorely disappointed. His unlikely partnership with Potter had been so much more positive and productive than he could have hoped that by the time Granger arrived and displayed her famous wit, he'd begun to believe he might be cured by nightfall.
“How’s your magic feeling now?” he asked (both for want of anything better to say and out of genuine curiosity).
That elicited a soft chuckle from Draco while he ate another spoonful of the surprisingly good dish. His foot jerked a little as the arch was touched but he did his best not to acknowledge it. Instead, he straightened his toes and pressed them against Potter's flat stomach.
He wondered what it felt like on the receiving end and if he would like it. Whenever he'd imagined being with a man, it had always been with him on top. Without even trying to (probably), Draco had convinced him to reconsider his opinion.
Draco nodded. "I wasn't going to let her through. No offense, but she hates you," he shrugged as he stood and gathered his dishes to set into the sink. The half full plate of dinner he left on the counter in case Harry was a stickler for saving rather than wasting any food.
The moment Harry went for another bite (this time with more cake than raspberry), Draco caught his wrist and stole the piece right off his fork. He made a hum of approval.
Draco thrust his fingers into Harry's mouth gently, letting Harry do most of the work. His other hand pressed into Harry's hip. Once his fingers were wet enough, Draco pulled them slowly away from the Auror's mouth and slipped them back down toward his hole.
Well, no more! Computer has internet capability again and you should be seeing regular updates until the end now! I can't guarantee exactly
? If so, I am impressed with your ability to keep that detail out of the public conversation. I know you are a highly private individual, but the fact that the press hasn't yet caught wind of that juicy tidbit is a testament to your discretion.
After a thorough inspection of said features--Draco was taking his sweet time hanging his coat on his chair--Harry decided he'd like the ensemble more after they returned home at the end of the night.
It was that those notes comprised nearly all of his life's work and what may very well be his greatest accomplishment as a potioneer. Not something he was eager to part with.
He looked his greedy fill, feeling rather like a starving man at a buffet. He didn't know where to begin. Draco's sweet, pink nipples stiffened to peaks in the cool, open air. The flat planes of his stomach quivered in anticipation. His legs--
Draco chuckled. The amount of lube Harry conjured was far more than needed and almost covered his entire hand verus a dollop into his palm. The blonde felt rather smug about putting the Auror into such a mind scrambling position as to not be able to concentrate on a simple spell.
Harry snorted and picked up his own menu for perusal. "Your life is so hard," he replied sarcastically.
P.S. Not that I want to control your decisions, but please do me a favor and avoid anything too tight or revealing (unless you're planning to cheat.) Thanks!
"I know all about jilted lovers," she confided to Harry a moment later, giving him a bracing squeeze and commiserating smile. Harry briefly worried she was about to tell him something he was woefully under-qualified to hear, but, thankfully, she settled back to her own work. "You really should think about getting a restraining order, love," she suggested kindly over her monitor, gifting him with the perfect out.
Back muscles screaming with strain, he used his arms to pull Draco down hard on him with each thrust up. Draco gasped deliciously.
The image of my long, lithe body stretched out above or below your broad, muscular one is absolute perfection. Like two pieces of a puzzle, pet.
Malfoy flexed the fingers of his right hand, curling them into a loose fist and then relaxing it, appraising the range of motion and his control as he did so. The damage to his nervous system was readily apparent (his fist neither closed nor opened fully) but he had enough muscle control that he should still be able to perform most day-to-day activities in Harry’s opinion. With enough practice and care, he’d seen folks do incredible things with less—amputation situations and the like. People were infinitely adaptable, it seemed, when they had the proper mindset.
"Remember earlier when you asked how you were going to give me inappropriate public hard ons?" Harry said archly when Draco resettled in his chair. "You're doing just fine, even with your limitations."
Later that evening, after Harry had bid his apologies and goodbyes to the pinched-faced celebrants, the bloody suit had been banished to the floor of his wardrobe, and a generous amount of firewhisky had been poured and consumed, he climbed into bed to unwind with a few chapters of the latest trashy romance he was reading.
Had he misinterpreted Harry's purpose in being there? That seemed to be what he was implying with his dig. As if Harry would use the pretense of Auror business to pull a bloke. (He'd only ever done that once, and it had been to pull a
"You're probably right," he replied, pretending to think it over. "I think I will." Decisively now. "Today." He was already up and putting his things in his bag. "
Harry laughed from deep in his belly about the idea of Lucius dropping dead over the books. Malfoy looked him over with obvious appreciation in his gaze, making Harry flush.
Draco dug into his pocket and produced a black velvet box. It was thin and square, and when he opened it he revealed a small crystalline disc with what appeared to be white specks suspended inside. He handed it to Harry carefully.
With a kiss to the tender spot behind Draco's ear, he removed his hand and carelessly wiped it on the sheets. (They'd need washing when they were done anyway.)
You think my eyes are stunning, eh? I'll be sure to remind you of that as soon as you're sober, with written evidence no less! And you even admitted to how easy it is to pay me such a compliment.
"Well I like chocolate, so I don't have to worry about that," he joked, grateful that Ron took him seriously enough to change tactics. His friend gave him a flat frown in response.
It might be fun, but I would have to think about it. That's a lot of media coverage, a lot of screaming crowd, and a lot of hell to come after... Can I at least avoid being hassled before hand?
My letter was completely sincere! Every part of it. I wasn't trying to make a big deal about the fancying you bit, I just wanted to cheer you up.
Your attentions toward a certain employee have not gone unnoticed by your co-workers. Rumors have already begun to spread like wildfire about whatever torrid affair you two could be carrying on. The way you look at the man cannot be mistaken, even if I happen to know the gossips are quite misinformed in their speculation. Nevertheless, I thought you might fancy this framed photograph of him. (It is a rather good one, if I do say so myself.)
Finished with the task at hand (but not his mental turmoil), Harry pushed the IFC trolley into the corner and made his way to the front of the clinic to pull Adrian's file for progress notes. The kid was doing well--with almost full mobility back in his leg, he'd be discharged soon and back on the court not long after that. Harry'd promised to come cheer for him at his next big game; Adrian said he'd hold him to it. (Because Harry was bloody decent,
"Look," he said, by way of both explanation and apology, "I pissed him off and now he won't talk to me and that's the long and short of it." He sincerely hoped they both could leave it at that.
The warning growl that vibrated in Draco's chest was small but sincere. And he paired it with his most fearsome glare.
Draco's head fell back against the door as his mouth was suddenly released. He was practically heaving with the need to fill his burning lungs.
"You know," he began again, attempting to be coy, "since we're on the subject of you and blokes... How is the git--I mean, Malfoy's case coming? Find the fellow who nearly did him in yet?"
His fingers itched to card through Malfoy’s hair, the strands of which, he remembered, had flown freely when the force of their magic had created noticeable breezes in the living room they now occupied. The sun was still well above the tops of the imposing trees that staked the perimeter of the Malfoy lands. It shone brightly through the many windows Harry had requested be opened to banish the pervasive gloom and stale air of disuse from the space. He could feel the light and warmth of it on his face but it was nothing compared to the heat radiating from the six-foot-plus furnace that had chosen a muggy July afternoon to reveal himself as a Hufflepuff in Slytherin’s clothing.
It was another long day at the Ministry ("long" because there hadn't been an interesting case in ages, which was a good thing for the citizenry but dreadfully boring for Aurors. The most excitement happening that week involved a flasher, one robbery, and the Weasley Wizard Wheezes shop having another explosion due to experimentation gone wrong.) He had been watching Harry mull over a large number of files for the past hour.
"It was clear he still had feelings for you and you'd been so obsessed with him in school and your track record with women hasn't exactly been stellar, has it? And then there was that thing with Seamus and you making eyes at other men when you were drunk, so I thought it was worth a try." She'd said all that while fluttering around the room filing legal briefs and sorting twenty-pound tomes, discussing Harry's entire embarrassing, frustrating, confusing process of sexual identity formation as though it were as trivial as a pudding recipe, and all without taking a single breath as far as he could tell.
"You are exactly as horrible as I would expect a Slytherin to be," he retorted, waving his empty fork accusingly. "Bite stealing cock tease."
So just the three? Well, damn. Looks like I have plenty of room for improvement, then. Those are good qualities to have all the same, so thanks, but a lot of people are selfless and brave--like Neville or Hermione. What makes me different? Besides being speccy. Unless you think glasses are sexy.
It had been a month. A whole damn month and Harry hadn't made any progress on Draco's case. Slytherins were crafty and Parkinson and Zabini particularly so. They'd covered their tracks well and their solicitors had buried him and Ron in a mountain of paperwork.
"The public is not aware of the extent of that injury," he admitted, somewhat stilted. "I didn't quit because I was traumatized or pushed over the edge into mental instability like the papers claimed." A flash of unwelcome memory nearly took his breath away (he might have been a
Thank you for your constant support, patience, and all the kind commentary. I did not mean to leave you guys hanging for the last chapter for so long, but I am in college and between Mid-Terms, Finals, theater productions (my minor, formerly my Main), a wedding, and a multitude of health issues (stomach viruses suck) I have been prevented. Don't get me started on the things holding up Playout! I'm not complaining, mind--life is good for both of us. I just mean it's hard to slow down while you're enjoying the roller coaster.
He realized belatedly he had noticed it in the hall, though faintly. His brain hadn't had a chance to register the scent before he'd crawled under the door. By that point, it was much too late.
Ron had turned his attention to the files since the conversation was far outside of both their comfort zones, but he didn't drop the subject. Harry knew he was being protective out of genuine concern so he tried to answer the questions in that same spirit.
"Let me help," Draco said in a cooing tone, just before vanishing Harry's clothes. "Oh, your hand, too. Want me to take care of that?"
Hermione had cornered Harry two weeks ago over the fact she'd given him 'two whole weeks' to come to her about Draco and he still hadn't done so. She wasn't pleased, which had less to do with the fact he was dating Draco than that he hadn't had the good grace to tell his best friend about it. She wasn't thrilled to pieces, mind, but she was cautiously supportive and had taken an active interest in their dating life, which she deemed romantically insufficient thus far. Hence the fancy date.
Of course, he knew quite well what the Auror referred too. He just wanted to see if he could get Potter to voice it for him.
At any rate, that dare was a great deal easier than the one that followed it: letting Pansy have her wicked way with me for two minutes. Damn harpy left scratch marks. And now Nott is giving me the eye.
Are we just going to shag or is there a possibility for a lot more? I figured I could come up with enough reasons by Friday why dating me is a good idea, but since this is last minute and all...
Harry nudged Draco away from his ticklish neck and leaned back so he could look him in the face to gauge his level of sincerity. There was just no telling with the gutter-minded tease.
Of course I didn't throw away your keepsakes--I'm not a monster. What I disposed of was the accumulated detritus from several years' worth of greasy takeaway as well as dozens of outdated memos and briefings.
His hair, a tangled mess from his time beneath Potter's skirt, swung loose about his face. The dress swished and rustled with every motion. His breath was hot and humid on his forearms, his arse both burned and sang.
After losing the Aurors and much of his leg, he'd just about lost his mind along with them. His work was everything to him. It gave him meaning. Purpose.
He knew what Harry had meant before, but he also knew the well-intentioned Gryffindor had no idea what he was doing. But now that Draco so incredibly sensitized, he had an impossibly small likelihood of failure.
Malfoy nodded thoughtfully. "Easy enough," he replied, before becoming visibly distracted by a spasm in his eyelid.
"What have you been doing all this time?" Harry sarcastically retorted as he wrapped his arms around Draco and pulled him in for a hug, angling his face downward to avoid getting a mouth full of water. He pressed several wet kisses to Draco's shoulder and prominent clavicle.
. You are neither my doctor, nor my Healer within these walls—you are my manservant, if you recall?”
Harry chuckled as Malfoy (Draco) paused just a few seconds too long to come up with his next comeback. And when he did, it wasn't exactly a stunner. The man was shaken, and Harry felt surprisingly smug for the implicit victory therein.
Unsure what the safe, wise, or appropriate response to a loaded statement like that could be, Harry simply made a non-committal sound.
," he was forced to complain as breathing became impossible (partly due to the sudden increase in his blood pressure). A telltale jutting became more and more obvious beneath the thin fabric of the skirt with each bit of flesh Draco revealed.
Harry drew in a quick, surprised breath through his nostrils. Even though he'd asked the question, he apparently hadn't been prepared for Draco to say yes.
"He was under the effects of Veritaserum when he provided that information," he said significantly. "Ron talked to Parkinson and Zabini last night but they refused to answer any questions."
Draco laughed despite himself and decided he was quite all right with the events of the day for bringing him there. Difficult as it was to believe.
I do happen to think that spectacles are sexy, particularly the thin-framed ones you've been sporting recently. And you possess a couple of necessary traits that Ms. Granger lacks for my tastes. Mr. Longbottom, on the other hand, is more well-suited, but he is missing the edge that sets you apart. You are powerful, challenging, exciting...
Totally nude, on his knees, with his chest and face pressed into the wall for support. His eyes were screwed tightly shut as he worked himself with one speeding hand on his cock and the other three knuckles deep in his arse. His hair was damp and matted, his spectacles abandoned, and his mouth hung open as he whimpered and panted.
What it was he had thought to add disappeared as his eyes went wide until they were as round as saucers. He had been shuffling in place as his agitation vibrated down from his brain to his limbs in an unconscious self-soothing attempt, but all went still when something began to crawl into his trouser leg and wrap tight around his ankle up to his calf.
snooping," he scolded petulantly, holding the novel defensively to his chest. "You are such an entitled, infuriating prat! This is the thanks I get for letting you into my home? Ugh!"
Maybe Malfoy noticed the beads sweat that had broken out on Harry’s forehead or perhaps it was the greenish tint to his complexion or the hunted look in his eyes, but he subsided and gestured for Harry to rejoin him on the couch.
At any rate, the appropriate license for modified muggle items is inside and the watch has been charmed to run on magic instead of a battery (for obvious reasons).
Frowning, Harry adjusted the strap of his satchel so it rested more comfortably on his shoulder and considered just what it was about Malfoy that got under his skin. A dog barked madly somewhere in the distance but he took no notice of it. His thoughts were elsewhere.
No. It wasn't possible. Not unless Draco was the world's greatest actor, and even then he would have a hard time accepting it: Draco was just too sincere for him to believe he would try to hurt him like that.
“Did you know you were capable of blushing on the back of your neck?” Malfoy asked conversationally, deceptively innocent.
The amount of semen that actually came out of him was relatively small, but his entire body heaved and quaked as the climax ripped through him, triggered like an avalanche by the pain-pleasure jolt of Draco twisting both of his nipples and rocking hard onto his aching prick.
Malfoy narrowed his eyes. "Of course I did, you imbecile," he spat, testy as a kneazel. "But given that your very
It also made him feel funny in his ferrety bits, but that was a sensation best left unexplored. He did
He thrust with abandon, movements becoming jerky and abrupt as his muscles and ligaments strained, the tension building to a critical threshold. He was on the agonizing cusp for what felt like an eternity, this orgasm not so easily won after the two that preceded it. He needed just a little bit more but couldn't get it on his own. Not tied up like he was.
Potter remained unmoving, expression soft and kind, putting the ferret part of Draco at ease. Perhaps he'd learned that trick from the Groundskeeper. Warily, Draco extended a paw towards him and held it there.
He sighed and slowly turned to lay on his back with his eyes gazing across the ceiling in thought. He smiled softly to himself as he recalled their impromptu dinner. The night had been exciting, and Potter (Harry) was surprisingly funny, clever, and so straight forward he nearly threw the exceptionally blunt Draco for a loop. Conversation (and kissing) came easy between them, despite their old rivalry and the years spent apart... Well, actually spending years apart may very well be why they got along so well now.
, princess," he announced dryly before toppling Draco sideways onto the couch and standing. "We are going to
Draco's mouth formed a small "oh" of surprise as Harry fell to his knees. One hand instantly went to land on the drowned mass that was his hair, the tendrils of which seemed to curl about his fingers. His other hand braced the wall as he bent forward over the Auror. The first lips on cock contact he ever had was surprisingly electric, sending a shiver down his spine that ended just at the base of his shaft.
Godrick, when Draco's voice went low and sultry and his smirk was all wickedly playful, Harry's libido
"Well, I can at least get this place cleaned up so Hermione won't have to wait to brew after she's cracked your barmy code," Potter announced, more to himself than Draco, it seemed.
He shot the git a warning glare and flipped open the lid as Malfoy circled back around to drop onto the couch like the shiftless lay-a-bout he'd apparently become. Sure enough, the box contained an empty plastic syringe with a hypodermic needle, nestled on a scrap of black velvet. He wordlessly levitated the implement so he could inspect it from every angle without touching it.
That wasn't what Draco expected, but pleasant the surprise was all the same. He gasped as he was thrown against the door in a fit of animalistic lust and again as he felt the Auror's erection meet his currently flaccid (but not for long) cock. He barely had time to appreciate the man's outfit!
Ron blinked at Harry's unexpected outburst--there was a bit of wild magic playing about his figure, as well as a telltale glint of anger in his eyes. He frowned at the sudden change in atmosphere.
The whole school is watching you. Some are waiting to see if you'll violently snap, others if you'll drop out. You know this already. But I don't think you realize how much some of the younger ones, the Slytherins especially, look up to you. They see what I see--a chance for a better future.
Lucius eyed the Auror's office with an undisguised look of disdain. It was far too small, the desk was cluttered, the place smelled of commoner's tea, and the lights were giving him a headache. The elder Malfoy sneered as he casually made his way from the door and a mere foot from Potter's desk. With a clearing of his throat he schooled his features and stared down his nose coldly at the man, exactly as he did when Potter was a boy.
Draco turned back from the sink once he knew the burn in his cheeks was well controlled. He grinned sheepishly at the skillet, even offering a shrug. "Whoops! Knew I forgot something." (There was no real apology in his voice.)
Harry shrugged, obviously none-too-concerned for his lack of punctuality. His grin widened as Malf--
might even come out to watch. You always were beautiful when you flew. When you weren't trying to knock me off my broom, that is.
"The name of an over-the-counter Muggle painkiller," he answered, tucking the pen into his lapel in case he wanted it later. "You'll need it. They're not nearly as effective as potions, but it'll take the edge off, at least. And because they operate by a different mechanism than magic, they won't be affected by your tolerance or interfere with your withdrawal process. You can pick up a bottle at Tesco on your way home."
While that wasn't strictly-speaking true, it was close enough. Especially where Malfoy was concerned.
"You couldn't even give me a chance to change?" Draco clucked his tongue. "Now I'm over dressed." He held his hands at his sides and looked down at his outfit disapprovingly. "Fine," he sighed, since the point was now moot. "As long as you're paying. I will reserve judgement until after I eat the food. Until then, I will attempt to be nice. Attempt," he underscored. "No promises."
It didn't slip his noticing that Draco was exceedingly polite in his reference to S.P.E.W. but he thought it best to gloss over that topic for now. He took another bite then continued.
had recently been by. Lengthening his stride and laughing on an exhale, he hurried to follow after--
"I was supposed to use a cane during the first several months of my recovery," he admitted, swallowing a grimace. Malfoy watched him closely out of the corner of his eye, hawklike and intent. "I hated the thing. It made me feel like a cripple."
He was on the verge of babbling. A big, fat tell if there ever was one. Realizing this, he reeled himself in. He took a deep, steadying breath in through his nose--the bridge of which he pinched between his thumb and forefinger in an attempt to stave off the tension headache he could feel forming--held it for a beat, and released it with a gusty exhale.
Draco fell uncomfortably onto the Head Auror's desk with Potter on top of him. He didn't have time to enjoy the hot licking to his ear before they Apparated and his back banged onto the old wood- barely missing the sharp quill stand. He looked up at the man straddling his hips and pouted.
He wanted to ask if Draco was ready, if he was sure, but he'd already said yes to both. He might grow irritated or doubt Harry's willingness if he continued with the questions. So he lined up his prick with Draco's entrance and pushed.
Draco gently pulled the door open, looking like a doctor ready to operate sans gloves. He smirked underneath his mask and quirked one fine brow as he approached. Once he arrived, he placed the briefcase on the bed.
He pulled the apron off over Draco's head and palmed his hardening shaft, combing his fingers through the soft, blond thatch of curls from which it sprouted.
"As for Goyle, perhaps you're right. I hope to know soon either way." He leaned close to Draco and entreated, "Can you promise me you won't try to talk to the other two until it's sorted?"
"Incredible and earth shattering?" Harry repeated with a shit-eating grin. "You do know how to stroke my ego. ...Among other things." (He couldn't resist.) He propped himself up on his elbows to see Draco's face, thinking about his answer with the seconds he bought.
The case is resolved. It was as straightforward as it appeared, unfortunately. Man gets mad. Man attacks wife. Man is sentenced to parole and mandatory visits with a Mind Healer. I have filed all the necessary paperwork.
Malfoy regarded him with a mixture of amusement and skepticism but graciously replied, “By all means.” He gestured to the table where all manner of good foods were spread out before them. The excess of both variety and quantity made Harry feel somewhat guilty, but his stomach rallied to overwhelm his conscience and he began heaping sausages and potatoes on his plate like it was his first night at Hogwarts.
"Until what now?" he asked cheekily as he forced Draco to wrap his legs around his waist in order to remain upright, causing Draco's cock to be sandwiched between them.
For the life of him, Harry could not figure out how to handle Malfoy's little taunts and challenges. Did he want Harry to sit next to him? If so, Harry should take the chair. But if he took the chair, then Malfoy would smirk and call him a coward. It was impossible to win.
Given the unusual way this conversation came about, I am trying really hard to shake the sensation of fate; a) because I hate it, and b) because I don't want to scare you away.
Draco laughed as he was pulled into Harry's side. He hugged the Auror's waist with one arm, nestling the other under his neck. He grinned wide and returned the kiss to his lover's cheek.
Not that Harry'd ever be able to explain it to Ron, but this was exactly why he wanted to date Draco--he met him exactly where he was at, knowing intuitively what he wanted and delivering. He stoked the flames of Harry's desire until his heart raced and his body sang with sensation.
Draco glared icicles as his protective gear was pulled away. At least the git had been gentle and didn't tear his hair out.
A smile pulled at the corners of Draco's mouth. "Maybe," was all he said before pulling him in for a long-overdue snog.
the one the Aurors don't know about. And I'll have Pansy send her something pretty. Or practical. Whichever she prefers.
Draco leaned close enough to Harry's back for his body heat to be felt, or at least to cause a frisson of energy between them (as the water was hot enough to disguise any additional warmth).
"Maybe this is all a misunderstanding." (It wasn't. He knew it wasn't. But he was trying to be sensitive.) "If so, the investigation will clear that up. I promise to hurry everything along as much as I can. In the meantime," he fixed Draco with a focused gaze, "you shouldn't have any contact with them." It was critical Draco understood that piece. "If Goyle was right, it might not be safe for you to do so. Even if he was wrong, you're still in danger. Whoever set the trap in the garden wasn't him. I think you should have an Auror escort with you any time you leave your house from now until this is settled. And Draco," he softened his tone, "I'm sorry." He trailed his thumb over Draco's knuckles. "I know this is bloody awful."
"Edward Remus Lupin!" Andromeda scolded sternly. From beneath a pile of seemingly everything that had once occupied Harry's lower cupboards, Teddy peeked out.
Well, not an outright lie--Malfoy's body was clearly protesting the paces Harry put it through--but it wasn't the reason for the sudden return of his ill-temper. One didn't have to be a retired Auror to figure that out (though it probably helped). Malfoy'd been fine on the stair climber, cordial even, but somewhere in the three minutes between Harry leaving him and his arrival at the mat, his uncharacteristic goodwill had dried up entirely. He was sullen and withdrawn for the remainder of the session, at turns snappish or completely silent despite Harry's best efforts to return to the brief almost-pleasant conversation they'd shared earlier.
Draco's body went rigid and he came, hot and wet, in Harry's hand. (Not the first time and hopefully not for the last). The muscles of his arse spasmed around Harry's prick, triggering his own release and ripping a harsh cry from his lungs.
Draco's heart was thudding hard against his chest. Of course Harry-bloody-Potter would be that good at hand-jobs and even better at such rough, verbal seduction. For a second he thought he might come from Harry's words alone.
"It's here if you need it," he said, placing the potion on the nightstand. "I have to go now but, uh...you don't."
He shrugged out of his coat--made difficult by the way he was pinned--and went to work open the buttons of his shirt. He winced with a sucking gasp when his bruised knuckles brushed Draco's abdomen.
When he could do no more, he gave Draco's ring a parting kiss, sat back on his heels, and took his shaft in one hand, stroking his glistening entrance with the thumb of the other.
How much longer until you are cleared for duty? I will probably regret saying this, but the office is duller without you.
"I want you to put a finger in me, Draco," he directed, almost shocked he'd managed to say it out loud. His stomach muscles jumped and spasmed when Draco lifted his head and fixed him with his liquid metal stare.
Draco thought he was being sly with that kiss. Both Hermione and Ron had seen it--evidenced by a wry quirk of lips and a grimace, respectively.
"I'm on to you, Malfoy," he said jokingly, eyes narrowed and heart still racing. "I've deduced your evil plot: you're trying to shag me to death."
It was too much. He sat up and pulled Draco with him to capture his mouth in a hungry, possessive kiss, unwilling to think about just how long they could have been doing this if only they'd known.
Harry only broke away when his burning lungs couldn't be ignored any longer. Panting, he grinned up at the sexy, sexy man looming over him, a loose fall of hair obscuring one grey eye. "My birthday is
Draco sat back on his haunches. "Oh, that's right," he said, "you wouldn't have known. Father was able to keep it out of the papers, but my mother lives in France now. I thought she was just on a long leave, but alas parents are separated and on the way to divorce. Which isn't to say they aren't friendly. Father even greeted her with a hug and they enjoyed a long tea time together upon her arrival. I don't know the reason for their separation and I only just discovered the news of the divorce myself, but I suspect it has something to do with the fact my father and I have more in common than our coloration and regrettable past behaviour," Draco shrugged as he paused in his explanation to take a much needed breath. "I always suspected Father had something of a crush on Severus... When he was still part of the council he would use that authority to visit the school after hours on the pretense of meetings with my Godfather for one 'official' thing or another. That, and he had taken a fancy to a retired Quidditch player who looks almost exactly like the man. It wasn't until Severus died that Father finally woke from his insanity."
I am writing to you on behalf of my best friend and formerly betrothed, Draco Malfoy, who seems to be content pining away for you from a respectable distance without making his feelings known...like a pathetic, spineless twat. (He knows where I stand on the matter.)
Draco nodded and stood from the couch, in that slow and lazy way he had adopted over the years. He playfully ruffled the Auror's hair as he passed on his way to the hall and hummed to himself as he exited, acting almost as if he was not only comfortable in the small mansion but
"I want you to squeeze yourself. Tight, you hear? And no holding back on any noises! I want to hear you..."
A bottle of champagne sat on the small table in front of them. Harry poured a generous amount into each of their flutes and offered one to Draco. "To new horizons," he toasted, smirking over the rim of his glass.
He finished his task and went to wash his hands, back to Potter and eyes downcast as a light tinge of pink graced his fair cheeks.
Harry was having such a grand time tending to Draco's needs, he would have been fine wanking the bloke to completion and worrying about himself after, but then he might miss out on his only opportunity to shag
"Missed you," he replied when he was finally allowed to break his mouth away and pant for air. "Missed this." He nudged Draco's shoulder until he was leaning back far enough for Harry to reach his chest with his tongue. Thus accomplished, he laved Draco's nipple and sealed his mouth over it for a sucking kiss, wanking him with a loose grip as he did so.
Just for that, Draco tackled the impertinent brat. He should have learned by now Draco didn't have to be a ferret to
"Your mother's 'in town?'" he repeated after a moment, surprised. "Does she not live here?" Lucius resided at the Manor, he knew, because the Aurors kept tabs on him as one of the conditions of his parole. It was news to him that Narcissa wasn't there with the bastard.
"Why don't you try me and find out?" he suggested tightly, half hoping Lucius would take him up on the offer.
I appreciate your thoughtfulness on the Granger matter. I'd like to wait and see if the tree we're growing bears fruit before involving friends and family. It would be terrible if we couldn't work something out and everyone knew we had tried. I don't even want to think about all the hate mail... But if this does work I could care less what anyone might have to say against it.
I didn't write to you initially because I thought (erroneously) you would be more likely to read something from a neutral party. It seemed that if you were going to reject something outright, it would be unsolicited mail from your schoolyard rival, no? I admit, I wrote when I did as a last ditch attempt, with no expectation it would bear fruit. In this case, I am glad to have been proven wrong.
"Are you certain you're ready?" Despite asking, Draco lifted one hand to Harry's lips and pressed two of his fingers there. "Suck."
"Satisfied? Speaking of 'princess'..." Draco began with a smirk and a chuckle, "Just who could this Princess D I've heard about you consorting with recently be? The papers are all aflutter about it."
"Third door on the right," he answered, indicating the hallway with a careless toss of his head. He stared a second too long at Malfoy's sockless feet and wondered if he'd ever found bare feet sexy before that moment. Those feet--long, narrow, pale, and with a very high arch--were unusually captivating.
Just get better soon. I would happily suffer even the bludgeoned mess you call a face again if only to do
I may leave work early. And I've got at least two week's worth of vacation days saved up. Don't make plans.
Gieves was a willowy man. Mid-50s. Sandy blond hair styled impeccably, with robes to match. He wore small, square wire-framed spectacles, which he peered over most of the time. He did so then to note the other person in the room, bent over with his naked arse in the air to retrieve the towering stilettos Pansy had paired with the gown. His face didn't so much as flicker, not even when Potter turned around with a cheeky grin, revealing himself to be the Saviour of Wizarding World.
Draco yipped twice, nearly hopping in his enthusiasm. "The second one," Potter translated. (His assistance was probably unnecessary but Draco couldn't fault the desire to feel useful.)
Thanks for the files. I was going spare with nothing to do but writing a few letters here and there. As soon as I get out I may actually organize my living room (which I have also been meaning to do for a year.)
It was after dark when the owl returned bearing Potter's response. Draco was in the middle of dinner; nothing too fancy, just a meal of random veggies and a chicken cooked in thick, white wine sauce. He had just stuffed another slice into his mouth when the owl surprised him. He quirked a brow and stood from his dining room to allow the bird in, this time through his kitchen window. The poor thing seemed tired now... Did Potter live terribly far from him? Or did the Ministry just over work their birds? Either way, he offered the ruffled creature a perch and some chicken and peas before unrolling the scroll.
"You sure do like your tarts," Ron laughed and shook his head at his best friend's antics as he moved to pull the first file from the in-box. "Maybe if the next fit bloke you saw was covered in the stuff you'd finally be willing to admit you like men."
Harry was grateful for the distraction of Malfoy retrieving his wand because that stretch had just been absurd.
The fact that I favour the children shouldn't be a mystery to you. They are almost always innocents caught up in frightening circumstances that are beyond their control. ...Ringing any bells?
But he was also resilient. Hard-working and determined. Surprisingly humble in spite of his upbringing. Charming even, on rare occasions.
Harry awoke before Draco (which wasn't all that surprising seeing as it was still morning). They'd tossed and turned through the night and ended up spooning, with Harry on Draco's back. His arm was cast possessively over Draco's waist and Draco's ticklish nape was a scant inch away from his face. Try as he might, Harry couldn't resist the temptation to rub his nose in the soft hairs there.
"I better'n like you," Harry slurred, smiling inanely and enjoying the warm, boneless feeling suffusing his body.
Draco appraised him speculatively. "Maybe. You are no longer scowling hard enough to ruin your pretty face so I think my work here is done."
," was about all he could manage by way of commentary through the harsh breaths he took. "Second... Second time today you nearly suffocated me..."
He was enjoying this one. The protagonist was a demanding and driven restauranteur, considered by many to be a culinary genius, but his exacting standards and abrasive personality meant he had a high rate of turnover in his kitchen...as well as in his bedroom. That is, until a plucky and intrepid young food critic had the audacity to write a mediocre review, which earned him the attention and ire of the chef. The chemistry between them was as hot and spicy as Harry's curry--they traded insults like they were declarations of love and were as likely to steal away to the walk-in refrigerator for a snog as they were to have a shouting match in the middle of the restaurant. It was unconventional, sure, but it was interesting and Harry was totally hooked.
"This will be a tremendous help to the investigation," he said reassuringly, passing the opaque bottle to Malfoy. "And I won't dillydally in your memory--we should only have to watch it once." Harry didn't have a perfect memory, but his mind did a good job of honing in on the relevant details and retaining them well enough to develop a good general picture of a crime scene.
Just as Draco was finishing his first (of what would be a few) glasses of tainted punch he heard his surname being gasped by an oddly familiar voice. With a glass petal still tipped gently at his lips, Draco froze in shock.
Draco bucked at the pain and Harry met his pelvis with his own, grinding their erections together and reveling in the spine-tingling sensation of another man's prick. What was happening between them felt nothing like being with a woman--it was hard and sharp and aggressively demanding and, Godrick, he was loving it.
Harry allowed some emotion into his voice, the weight of his conviction lending strength to his words, "You've already served your time. This self-imposed house arrest is unfair. And I couldn't care less what the papers say about me. They have been printing lies since I was a kid. A sterling political reputation and positive public image mean next to nothing to me, I have no intention of running for Minister. What I care about is doing what's right. In this case, that's helping you," he pointed at Malfoy to underscore the statement. "So would you be willing to give me a pensieve memory of that night?"
Filtering out the sensory noise as best he could, he cautiously poked his head out and saw what he'd expected--Potter was indeed wanking.
He dropped his head on Harry's shoulder and curled one leg over his meaty thighs. His hold was loose due to his exhaustion.
This gift is another muggle one. Be careful with it--it scratches easily and doesn't work as well once it's been damaged. It's called a Compact Disc (CD for short) and it's really quite brilliant. I've put a bunch of my favourite Christmas songs on there. Muggle and Wizard bands, both. You have to use a CD player to listen to it, but Arthur has one you can borrow until your next gift comes.
Harry grinned as he followed Draco to the desk. Instead of leaning forward and draping himself over his partner like before, he dropped carefully to his knees between Draco's legs and moved to grip and spread his arse cheeks.
Bixby snapped his knobby fingers and the cabinet beneath the vanity opened to reveal a pile of plush white towels. His expression dared Harry to ask for anything else. Being a contrary bastard in his own right, Harry briefly considered requesting fresh flowers or a bottle of chilled champagne but quickly thought better of it. The elf already despised him—no sense making it worse.
Potter kissed his clavicle. "Does it help any if I say you make a particularly fearsome ferret?" he simpered.
, he sighed, heaving himself up to standing with effort. He took four dragging steps to the edge of the table and butted against Potter's chin.
Realizing that two seconds too many had ticked by without a response from his quarter and Malfoy’s expression had turned from pleasantly open to curious and guarded, Harry hastily cleared his throat.
He summoned a pillow from the bed to make kneeling more comfortable and got into position behind Draco's head. "Wet your hair for me, please," he requested, pouring shampoo into his hands and working up a rich lather.
Said prick leapt at the idea. "Is that supposed to be a threat?" Harry asked, genuinely curious. Draco's tone indicated as much but the words were nothing but enticing. So much so, Harry considered apparating them straight to Grimmauld in full view of any muggle passersby, Statute of Secrecy be damned.
Harry leaned forward on his elbows, interlacing his fingers in front of him. "In that case, what brought you to me? Or, more accurately, to a Muggle occupational therapist?"
With Draco pressed so snugly against him, Harry could feel quite readily the effect his attentions were having on him.
Harry and Draco waved good bye until their guests apparated away, and then the door closed. The blonde huffed.
Pansy was wearing a dress almost to her knickers and heels that looked almost a foot high. Blaise was wearing a ridiculous jester hat that someone had stuffed onto his dome. And then, there was Draco: short hair, loose top, dragon leather pants, and half-gloves. They glowed and changed colors under the lights and bumped into each other and every body that came close. Pansy wrapped herself around a random bloke who happened to catch her fancy and he dragged her off. Blaise was talking up a small group of females, as charming as ever. Draco, abandoned, deigned to leave the stage. His footing was somewhat off (he was buzzed and exhausted) when, just as he reached the edge of the floor... A young man with ruffled black hair, large spectacles, and green eyes approached.
If you know, as you claim, that I am cleverer than to have misconstrued your intent, you should also know that I would never answer so bald a question without some form of insurance that my reply won't be used against me.
Draco stared at Potter for a long moment as he considered the request (demand?) with trepidation. It wasn't just the attack itself that made him nervous about entering the memory with the Auror; there was something in there that he was certain would screw up whatever tentative association was forming between them.
"You're too gracious, Pans," Draco replied with a roll of his eyes as he settled onto the hearth. "Speaking of 'being busy'," he said, changing the topic to suit his fancy, "I might be myself tonight."
"If you wanted this to be about more than sex," he murmured, clasping Draco's wiry bicep, "this maybe isn't the best way to go about it. Not that I'm complaining," he hastened to amend.
Unable to stall much longer, he sat up and withdrew his hand. Draco whimpered. Harry shushed him gently and rested the other on Draco's thigh for balance, then guided his cock until the head, flushed deep red and glistening, nudged Draco's pucker. Rather than pushing in straight away, he dragged it across Draco's winking entrance, toying with him to test the limits of his notoriously thin patience.
“Mm,” Malfoy hummed by way of reply. Gingerly he picked himself up, ineffectually smoothing the creases in his robe and tugging his sleeves down to his wrists, concerned with appearances even here.
Malfoy's answer was dry and dispassionate--he'd obviously recited the list before. "Uncontrollable muscle spasms particularly in my face, sporadic involuntary neck and hand movements and/or tremors, rigidity in some muscle groups," here he held up his right hand for Harry's inspection, "numbness and tingling in my extremities, loss of balance, occasional shooting pain."
"It's entirely muggle," Harry affirmed, drinking in the sight of Draco so awed. "Just wait til you see the inside."
Harry groaned loudly. The dirty talk always did him in. (Who could resist such naughty words in that pretty, proper accent? Certainly not him.)
Malfoy. He's a manipulative git and I heard he's a whore to boot. You don't want to get your rocks off on that one--there's no telling what a Slytherin might be carrying, especially him."
"Watch it," Harry warned, checking his immediate and instinctive flash of anger as best he could. "You might end up like Zabini."
Are you trying to tell me that you're using your precious dare in some kind of charitable act of service? How droll. I'm not sure I should be taking hairstyle advice from you, of all people. It is endearingly trusting of you to ask for your dare on the as yet unfulfilled expectation that I will make good on mine, however.
"Did you know they have bacon flavors now?" Draco pointed to the sign to bring Harry's attention back to the joys of ice cream. "Chocolate maple bacon, orange bacon, and syrup and bacon. I think we should stick to something more basic today, but I had no idea bacon was such a popular flavor."
"That's the spirit," Sarah cheered, nodding her approval. "We can manage without you for an afternoon." Her fingers flew over the keyboard as she pulled up the appointment grid. She had his schedule cleared almost before he was even finished packing. (Harry made up his mind to talk to the Director about a well-deserved raise for the woman.)
He scooped up the half-empty bottle of wine--the third one they'd opened--along with Draco's glass, and led him upstairs, settling him in an overstuffed chair in the den. After pouring him a generous amount of wine and getting a cheerful fire crackling in the fireplace, he told Draco to put up his feet and relax while he went and got a few things ready.
"Harry," Draco murmured seductively as his hands slithered up to lay about his head and his legs widened to give the ravenette more room. "You have no idea how long I've wanted this. Who knew it would only take a bit of flu? I should have hexed you sick or something so we could have gotten to this sooner."
all laid out and loose. Harry folded both hands tightly in his lap and focused on the important details of what the man had said.
The last one had been delivered through panting breaths while Malfoy struggled with his nemesis, the trampoline. He'd beamed--full-on
Draco tilted his head and widened his legs to give Harry better access. He smirked and thought with amusement,
"C'mere," he said, tugging him back down again. He pulled Draco into a kiss and ran both hands through his hair to loosen it.
Alone with his thoughts, he racked his mind for any clues of this secret interest in him Potter apparently harboured. Everyone knew Draco was gay, of course. There was no sense in hiding it. But Potter had always been enigmatic about his dating life. The papers had snapped a few pictures of him lunching with male Quidditch players on occasion and speculated wildly about the nature of their relationship, but it was easy to write that off as tabloid fodder--after all, he lunched with female Quidditch players, as well. It was hardly compelling evidence the man might be bi-sexual, but the Prophet seldom troubled itself over such trivialities. The fact that Potter got himself off while thinking about Draco, on the other hand...
"What is the meaning of this, Harry?" he asked, hurt and disappointment writ clear in his weathered features. He urged his still-tense son into the wingback chair beside him. With few exceptions, everyone had been rooted to their respective spots since the initial
worried. He had a good thing going at the Centre for Applied Physiotherapy and he didn't care to have unscrupulous reporters or obsessive fans showing up and disrupting his practice just because Malfoy reneged on his dubious word.
(That doesn't seem like much of a challenge. I did it anyway, but what is the point if no one sees it?)
He couldn't be entirely sure because almost everything was drowned out by the sound of the water spraying out of the shower head and the blood rushing in his skull. (The absolute filth Draco whispered directly into his ear was a notable exception.)
"Says the man who orders everything with butter or cream sauce and thinks chocolate is a food group," Harry scoffed, grinning. He took another bite of his cheeseburger before answering Draco's question. "You avoided the pickles when I brought you a ploughman's the other day. I figured it was a general disdain."
"... Maybe it wouldn't be so bad getting out a little, even if it is to the Ministry..." He sighed as he stared out the glass and across the expansive backyard. His home was small, especially when compared to the Manor, but the yard was still big and covered in thousands of wild flowers and berries. He never bothered with lawn work--just content to let it all go wild. A small smile graced his lips as he leaned into the window and sighed.
Draco let Harry pull him away, thanked the counter-girl again before leaving, and hesitantly followed Harry outside--this time regaining his lover's hand and holding tight. The blonde licked his cone tentatively as the sun once again rained down upon their faces and doing his best to ignore the growing crowd.
If you didn't expect me to reciprocate, why tell me? I thought that perhaps I had been more obvious than I initially thought, which prompted the confession. Were you hoping to scare me away?
, remember," he prompted, just before whispering a spell and tying Harry's wrists to the headboard with magical bonds. The conjured ropes spilled from the wand and quickly latched around the Auror until he was properly affixed to the bed.
"It's just music tonight," Harry answered, hoping that didn't dampen Draco's enthusiasm. "Mozart. You've probably heard of him. He is considered one of the greatest muggle composers of all time." (Hermione had given Harry an art historical lecture when they settled on the plan for the evening.)
"That's fine," Malfoy muttered, probably as relieved as Harry at the promise of a diversion. “But I will need to change first. I wasn’t expecting to work up a sweat this morning.”
After filling his own plate more generously than Harry would have expected given the other man’s slender frame, Malfoy remarked, “I find myself rather more peckish than usual. Is that true for you, as well?” He eyed Harry’s obscene plate. “You always did have a...
Well, he certainly acted bashful like Potter did when there was a chance the man was mistaken. But what if he was on polyjuice? It was strictly forbidden to use another employee's hair (or any hairs outside of under cover jobs) especially for this sort of circumstance, but that didn't mean he wasn't a very determined snoop.
Harry groaned with pleasure. "I may or may not have some Slytherin tendencies," he replied, backing Draco against the counter and lifting him up on to it. He mouthed Draco's sharp clavicle and smooth upper pectoral, dragging his teeth over the creamy, unblemished skin (it begged to be marked).
Anyway, if you had been there, you would have dealt with the girl and probably been fine since you've had Dragon Pox before. Not to mention you never discussed this particular illness with me, Mister Protocol. Part of the reason you were assigned as my partner was for things like this (and because no one else wanted you, so it was either me or boring desk work unless someone else volunteered, but mainly the whole "keep Potter out of the hospital" thing).
The blonde wore a surgeon's mask with face shield, medical robes, and a cap over his hair. In one hand was a small bag--a briefcase, rather--and in the other he held his wand and began casting disinfectants and cleansers as he slowly made his way to the stairs and toward the bedroom.
"Sorry for doing that without warning," he apologized after they'd landed (referring to the apparation, not the punch). "We can go to Grimmauld if you'd rather, but I didn't want to presume."
After a beat he added fake sternly, "But you are going to have to ease off all the coy innuendos and unsubtle taunting and ruddy skintight clothing," he raised a pointed brow at Malfoy's shirt, "if you want me to keep my hands to myself."
Instinctively, Harry reached out his hand, placing it on Malfoy's tense forearm. "Hang on, then," he urged, mind racing to make sense of the scene. "You came to see me for a
Draco blinked. "... A greasy newspaper cone? Why would anyone eat anything out of a newspaper cone?" He didn't mention he hadn't even had chips before, though he knew of them, of course. "Especially a greasy one."
Harry grinned, shaking off Draco's fingers (pretending to snap at them when Draco took his sweet time removing them from his face). "You know me so well," he responded snidely (even though it was true). "Maybe
Without waiting for Harry's answer, he voiced the next most pressing thought clamoring for attention in his head. "So, work. From what I have gathered you are currently the only Auror without an extensive medical record. Yes, you've sustained injuries--both serious and not, but for someone whom I imagine attracts so much trouble, I would think you'd have been hurt more often. Not that I want you to be," he quickly amended. "It's actually a relief." He peered closely at Harry. "Is it because of Weasley or are you just
I'm sure you're missing me to bits. Never fear, darling, I'll be back by your side before you know it.
I admit, I'm bored now without you around. We've had a heavy load this weekend, but I am not allowed to leave the confides of the office alone... So they have me on desk duty performing inane acts such as double checking spelling of others' reports or taking phone calls for everyone in the department, including the idiots downstairs. Don't we have a few secretaries for this?
. It had to be close to dinner time. What little light filtered through the murky lake water outside his window had been steadily dimming since they'd arrived at the lab. If it weren't for the torches lining the walls, they wouldn't be able to see much of anything.
Potter could have done worse, to be sure, but targeting Draco's hair two times in a row was ill-advised. His retribution would be meted out with extreme prejudice. First, however, Draco needed to spell his hair again, and he was most displeased by it because doing so was liable to result in split ends.
--to the full-length mirror he kept in the lab. He knew what he would see in its reflection long before he arrived, though he tried valiantly to deny it until the last possible moment.
Merlin's tits, it was worse than a snit. Draco had his knickers full in a twist. And Harry's begrudging remorse was quickly giving way to annoyance--he did not appreciate being raked over the coals for things that, while clumsy, weren't ill-intentioned.
Slowly, ever so slowly, he shook his wand out of his forearm holster. The plant gripped harder and twined higher, but not enough to prevent him from casting a tightly controlled flagrante at its roots. It shiriveled and died with a whimper, releasing him. He shook off the hanging tendrils and took off at a run after Draco, wand held at the ready.
Usually I find your heartless bitch routine amusing. When it is aimed at me, however, it wears thin.
"Sorry about that nasty business, gentlemen," the girl apologized sympathetically, surprisingly formal in her diction given the way she looked. "Do you know what you want or would you like to try some samples? The chocolate maple bacon is quite good, actually." The last was directed at Draco.
"You should make yourself comfortable," he murmured against Draco's lips, trailing a hand up his side. He kissed him again before vowing, "I intend to do this right."
Harry turned his face heavenward. Whether for an answer, a prayer for peace, or that they both might be smote where they stood, he wasn’t sure.
And he had such a triumphant look in his eyes as he clutched the ball to himself that Harry couldn't be arsed to care about the soppy grin he wore in response. That is, until Malfoy loosed the witticism with enough sexual undertone in his leer to make Harry splutter.
"Let's talk about that later," Harry hedged, glancing significantly at their audience. Draco nodded but his smirk told Harry the conversation was far from over.
Draco continued to stare down at his food and dip his crisp until he finally grew tired of it and set the dripping fry down on his plate. He shrugged as his hands slipped into his lap and his eyes noted the anthill design his ketchup had taken.
"That feels... Weird and good at the same time..." Draco commented, though words left him as his entrance was slowly invaded by the stiffened end of his tongue--the pink muscle teasing his entrance.
Forgive me if I am not terribly moved by the woeful plight of the Golden Boy. That said, if you haven't solved your own problem by then, I could be persuaded to lend a hand (in a manner of speaking) when I return Friday.
those will be, but it will not be taking the insane months-long time it had before. It should be more like once a week to every two weeks at worst.
I still dabble in Potions in my off time. I imagine I might retire to it someday. If opening my own orphanage doesn't pan out.
Draco decided to rake his hands through Harry's hair for fun until he could properly see the famous scar. He leaned forward and gave it a quick kiss.
Slowly, carefully, Harry closed his left hand around Malfoy’s so that it was totally encased within his palms. With that much skin-on-skin contact, there was a noticeable hum of magic that made the hairs on the back of Harry’s arms stand up and the wandlight brighter still.
Harry found himself in a darkened room in Malfoy Manor, somewhere he hadn't been in many years and, frankly, never expected to be again. Suddenly questioning the wisdom of this plan, he covered his bits with his hands and looked hastily about for unwanted company. Draco stepped gracefully out of the flames a moment later--completely unabashed in his nudity--and sauntered up next to him with a predatory smirk on his face and victorious gleam in his liquid metal eyes.
And maybe we could spend some time getting to know each other again afterward? When we aren't insanely busy and when you're not distracting me with Quidditch and associated leathers?
"I would have done anyway," Harry replied, deftly untying the apron's knots. "That's just good manners."
Draco observed Harry closely after taking a seat. He tilted his head and bit his lip in thought before nodding to himself and standing back up.
Harry should have known better than to offer anything approaching sympathy to Malfoy. The prickly, unstable, irrational, infuriating
And would it be so impulsive, really? After all, we both admitted to wanting the other for years (on and off on your end it seems, rather consistently on mine). We also both admitted to having high expectations of the other and wanting to be careful about how we approach things (you more so than I, for certain).
Seeing nothing for it and deciding he was long overdue to apologize anyway, he splayed his palm in the center of Draco's chest and leaned in to whisper, "I nearly killed you in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom."
Regrettably, Draco didn't have the luxury of continuing that line of thought--Potter was a spartan bather. The water shut off mere minutes after he started and the door to the loo opened another minute after that. From it wafted the alluring scent of Potter's soap.
I have had quite enough of destiny for one lifetime, thank you. If that's what it takes to obtain a partner, I should probably buy a dog or something to address the fact I'll be forever alone.
Excuse me? Yes, I was being a bit playful, but I wouldn't say no to such a... Collaboration between partners. I just wasn't expecting that kind of response, considering our history (even with all the nice things you've said about me in these exchanges.) Perhaps you're sicker than you think?
It took Harry a long minute to process Malfoy's question because his brain got hung up on images of the unreasonably sexy blond wanking the days away. (He did not miss the fact that no other men had been listed as inspiration, however.)
Harry grinned, happy to oblige. He took over holding Draco's legs and leaned his weight into the next grinding circle of his pelvis. "Like that?" he asked smugly (and unnecessarily given the high pitched whine Draco made in response). He repeated the gesture and Draco's fingers scrabbled on his shoulders, surely leaving welts behind. He kept it up a few times more but as the pressure built in his balls, his restraint faltered. He withdrew most of the way and snapped his hips forward, coming perilously close to coming as his whole prick was squeezed.
"Blaise used to ask me to watch when he would have sex. Kinky bastard, that one. Sometimes he and his partners would use toys. He likes men and women, so that was actually how I discovered I was gay... I didn't care to see breasts. I also walked in on an orgy in the common room late one night when I wanted a snack from the kitchens. The Slytherin dorms were home to quite a bit of debauchery."
"Nn, so aggressive," Draco sighed and lifted his knees to his chest before opening them wider. "Merlin, yes... I've been waiting all day for it."
"It's not written backwards..." she muttered to herself. "And it doesn't appear as though you've swapped pairs..."
"In that case... How would you like to address things? I assume you know how I feel about it. Rather obvious, really."
"Just sad then?" Potter asked, stroking two fingers down Draco's spine, making him shiver. He inclined his head in a slight nod. "Hermione will figure it out," Potter replied reassuringly, endlessly confident. "You'll be back to your grumpy, not-at-all-cuddly self in no time."
Draco held out one of his long, pale hands with a slow sigh. It was more of his need for an anchor versus the usual affection.
When was the last time you were on a broom? You should take one out to start practicing for tryouts after your house arrest is over.
Though your terms are as simple as I might expect from you, your wisdom about getting to know one another is sound. I would hate to think you are only interested in me because I am gay and available.
Harry arched his back to push into Draco's demanding hands, spreading his legs wider for better access. With their torsos pressed together, his own hands wandered from his partner's hips--one grasping the hairs at the back of Draco's head in order to pull him down close enough for Harry to bite his thin lower lip as the other slithered beneath Draco's thigh and lifted. Their cocks met with the action and Harry didn't hesitate to grind against him.
Draco blinked owlishly at him, hurt, confused, and eager to deny. Harry sighed. "Until we know one way or another, you need to be extra careful."
Hoisting Draco's hips so he would have more access and using the hand that was already lubed, he rubbed the pads of his index and middle fingers over Draco's slick, winking pucker.
Using his fingers, he popped a juicy red beet into his mouth and savored the burst of flavour from Draco's citrus vinaigrette as he waited for Draco to serve himself.
As they made another turn about the dance floor, Harry began to find himself affected as well; heart thrumming in his throat for a reason wholly different from the physical exertion of the routine.
Malfoy consented with a curt nod and Harry wasted no time in doing so lest his mercurial patient change his mind.
“Half four,” he replied, running number charts through his brain in the hopes arithmancy could dash cold water on his rebellious libido.
Malfoy sent the pillow sailing through the air with a flick of his wrist and a gentle tug on Harry’s magic. It landed with a quiet
Draco bit his bottom lip as he took a step back to appreciate Harry now that he was fully on display. His firm chest and abdomen were just as mouth-watering as they had been earlier--tempting Draco to touch, lick, and even bite. Harry had strong, stocky legs, perfectly proportioned to the rest of him, and well-toned arms. All of him shone with drying perspiration.
One hand cradled the back of Draco's skull, threading through his fine, silky hair, and the other went to his own aching cock to gather what lube he could. Thrusting his tongue against Draco's and tracing the ridges of the roof of his mouth, relishing in the warm, honeyed taste of him (and the remnants of his afternoon tea), he reached behind Draco and nudged his hand out of the way.
"Does that mean I might have a chance after all?" There was a little hope and playfulness (and a lot of indication) in his tone. He crossed his legs, prominently displaying one of his bare feet again as it hung just above the coffee table between them, and tilted his head. "Ask away. Before you jump me, I mean."
You ought to begin making farewells to your penis--if it has reached the glowing stage, it is not long for this world.
Not only was he not nearly as fit as Neville (who had surprised everyone with his dramatic transformation in late adolescence), but he had no need for the princely sum Witch Weekly offered for the photos. With a baby on the way and Hannah considering selling the Leaky to stay at home full time, the money Neville earned gave them some peace of mind. Harry, on the other hand, had two large vaults at Gringotts, no dependents to worry about, and an aversion to having his picture taken. No amount of galleons could convince him to stare seriously in the middle distance while slouching in cotton pants and an open dressing gown, bulge prominently on display.
"I would suggest taking a walk out there, but I do believe I snakes and spiders running amok. Who knows what else, but the neighborhood itself is muggle so perhaps nothing magical that might try to strangle us at least?"
Harry grinned wolfishly. Malfoy's pupils were blown wide, his lips flushed red and cheeks tinged pink, and he panted for breath. He'd reached for sass and couldn't find it, which meant a job well done for him.
"Unofficially, since Christmas," Harry replied truthfully (knowing and dreading how poorly that news would be received). He tried to lessen the sting by adding, "But just a couple of months, officially."
"At any rate, after a couple minutes of you being nice to me, I realized you must need me for something. You're never nice to me otherwise." Draco wanted to argue that Potter was hardly a paragon of kindness toward him either, but again, now was not the time. "It wasn't hard to put two and two together after that. Since you didn't go to Minerva, I'm assuming you don't want her to know. Which means you probably did this to yourself, yes?"
It shouldn't be all that surprising, he supposed a moment later, since Malfoy was bent. It didn't seem the sort of thing the pureblood would go for, however. The books were somewhat cheap and tawdry, for all that they were well-written. If nothing else, shouldn't they be hidden away in his room, instead of on display in a position of honor in the otherwise tasteful and decorous flat?
"I don't even like you," Potter groused. The claim rang hollow when he moved to pet Draco before he'd even finished speaking.
Anyway, your mum sent me the glass you drank from the night you started acting queer and it came back positive for an Amortentia subtype. I'm working on a list of suspects now.
Thus prepared, he grasped Draco's prick once again, steadying them both with his other hand on his hip, and began wanking in earnest--tight, sure strokes that culminated in a twist around Draco's slick crown.
He watched Potter closely, his countenance a little too innocent now. He waited until Potter brought a spoonful of curry to his lips before slipping a bare foot between his legs and petting his calf through his trousers.
Harry didn’t trust himself to respond appropriately so he cleared his throat, cleared it a second time for good measure, then mumbled an assent. Bloody Malfoy spoke in double entendres so often, he was never sure how to interpret even seemingly innocent sentences like that one.
But he had contacted Malfoy as an Auror, he reminded himself with a stern shake of his head. He would be strictly professional--brief and by-the-books--when he visited that afternoon.
... Give me more!" Draco threw his head back and groaned in appreciation as Harry's fingers scraped across his prostate. "Right there...!"
You may tie me up, but only if you plan to use the ropes for proper games. In addition to being generously well-endowed, I am
"Yes. It's brilliant and I'm an arsehole. Mostly I'm an arsehole, though," Draco turned back to Harry and smirked. "And not the kind you like."
Harry was relieved (mostly) that Malfoy was putting aside the flirting at last. The sooner he could make real headway on this investigation, the sooner he could...think about the conflictual feelings and urges the man stirred up in him. Or something.
Draco gave Harry's stomach a final nip; despite his words, he placed himself between Harry's legs and leaned down to lick a thick, wet stripe up the length of the Gryffindor's cock--from base to tip, where his tongue flicked off.
The voice was right. Harry mentally shook himself and took a step back, widening the space between them even more. He knew Malfoy joked like that because it always got a rise out of him. It wasn’t anything new. No sense taking it personally now.
Unfortunately for the surprisingly eager Harry, Draco was satisfied by leaving the man's neck bruised with love bites. With one hand he held his cone, and with the other he briefly cupped and pressed into Harry's growing erection... Just before letting go and turning to walk away--attention once again on his food. He quickly ate the remainder of his fish.
Let me answer your question with a question: If you had the opportunity to make a first impression a second time, would you take it? Or put another way, if you could introduce yourself to someone as you, plain and simple--without all the baggage of regrettable tattoos and bitter rivalries--wouldn't you want to?
"I was excited?" Draco offered with a cheeky grin and only a hint of genuine apology. Harry rolled his eyes.
Come off it, Malfoy. I've got heaps of paperwork to catch up on. And Robards wanted my arrest report last week. I can't afford to miss another day. So what if I'm still a bit feverish and queasy? I'll keep to my side of the office and quarantine the germs. It's not like we're going to be snogging or anything. Just don't drink from my teacup and you should be fine.
He hooked his ankles behind Draco's back to pull him in closer, moaning at the sensation of Draco's hard cock dragging against his own.
Those things involved candles, soft music, and a warm bath, and took more than a few minutes to prepare, even with the help of magic.
Just as a sneer was beginning to form on his face, he caught Draco looking worriedly at him. He quickly tamped down on his negative emotions and gave what he hoped was a reassuring smile. "I am looking forward to dinner and your company," he said (mostly honestly), quietly enough that only Draco could hear.
"Yes, actually," he replied, voice slightly strangled. He coughed a second time to loosen his vocal cords and continued, "I want to have Ron and Hermione over for dinner this week. With us," he added significantly, rubbing his thumb over Draco's knuckles. "And then I want to take you out in public. Diagon maybe. And put the rumors about your identity to rest. Assuming you're ok with it," he hedged.
Harry waited for Malfoy at the Welcome Witch's station, figuring that would be the best place to find him since they had neglected to arrange a meeting spot beforehand.
"Well, then, Potter, it has been... Interesting," he offered in as bored a mien as he could muster. "I'm off to get cake, then! Good bye."
Harry thought about continuing as though he hadn't heard the git--he was obviously being sarcastic, anyway. (Malfoy must be as bored as him and had probably decided that a bit of Gryffindor baiting sounded more fun than standing around drinking or tampering with the refreshments.)
Draco didn't seem to realize what a distraction his lips and borderline nudity were. He stood once again (stretching himself out with his arms high above his head one last time) and walked around his couch with his wand in hand, apparently heading upstairs.
Feeling equal parts victorious and relieved, Harry sat on a rolling stool across from him, resting on his thighs the pale blue new patient folder he carried. 'M. Billingsley' read the neat black type on the label--meaning Harry wasn't the only one using a false name there. For the sake of their tenuous truce, he refrained from comment.
fretting, trying to distract himself from fretting, and insisting to anyone who asked that he was perfectly fine, really, and most certainly wasn't fretting ('why would you even think that, Hermione?').
...Swimming sounds nice the way you describe it. Almost like flying, indeed. Unfortunately, I haven't wanted to go back in the water since the Triwizard Tournament. I can kick around a bit if I need to and I might wade in the shallows on a hot day, but I get anxious if it's more than waist deep.
Draco blinked in surprise as Potter grew intensely angry. He took a few steps back with his hands up on the defensive and eyes wide.
The risk of scarring is great enough as it is and Merlin knows you've got plenty of them already. You look like you got into a fight with the Monster Book of Monsters and lost.
Godrick's knob, Harry shouldn't have let Malfoy have the rest of that potion. He was flip enough without it lowering his inhibitions.
Harry's eyes nearly rolled into the back of his head when Draco sunk down onto him and a deep, almost tortured groan was wrenched from him.
"I have competition, eh?" Draco asked with a sultry tone to his voice, a quirk of his fine brow, and a seductive smirk. He advanced the short distance between them and pulled Harry into a tight embrace. "I suppose I will have to rectify that."
It was a sleepless night after that leading up to their public date about the wizarding world the next day. His heart wouldn't stop hammering. It took a dose of sleeping drought (half a bottle only) to finally pass out.
,” Malfoy whispered, and a pulse of shared magic responded, putting out not only the wandlight but every single lamp in the room.
Your eleventh gift is mistletoe and it is in my office. Along with your twelfth. I'll let you unwrap that one early if you promise not to tell.
"Actually," he responded, full-throated and low, "I was rather looking forward to that suck." He punctuated the words with another firm roll of his hips.
"You're ridiculous," Harry said affectionately to his rumpled boyfriend, bending down to kiss him good morning (or, more likely, goodnight, since there was no way he'd be staying up).
I am pleasantly tingly and comfortably relaxed but still in possession of my full faculties, I assure you. For which reason, Nott will not be allowed within a metre of my person--it would take a good deal more than Pansy's patented suicide blend to make me reconsider that position. As for the aforementioned shrew herself, a bit of fun for the sake of a game hardly constitutes a renunciation of cock. I am still most unambiguously bent. And willing to risk another letter or two.
Fretfully, Harry carried the tea service back upstairs and found Malfoy where he'd left him--shirtless and bootless, but still in trousers, at least. He appeared to be asleep, so Harry settled quietly into one of the chairs and blew across the surface of his tea to cool it, contemplating the strange, maddening, sexy man before him.
He was just about to say as much when a familiar patronus glided in through the wall. The otter splashed about his head in phantom waves and Hermione's worried voice came through, "Harry, I don't know where you are, but we've just learned someone spiked the punch. It's a lust potion. If you're with someone else please, for the love of Merlin, keep your pants on and report to the first aid station so we can get you the antidote."
"It's gonna be ok," he said comfortingly, putting an arm around Draco's waist and holding tight. "I'm here. I'm not going anywhere."
Draco draped his legs around Harry's thighs and wrapped his arms around the Auror's neck, hugging him tight and suckling on his lips for a long second.
Simultaneously grieving the loss of physical contact and sighing inwardly with relief, he righted his glasses and stretched the worst of the kinks out. (His unhelpful brain suggested a bed was a preferable location for cuddling and they should most definitely try that next time.) Malfoy’s hair was the disaster for once, especially the side that was both crushed flat and sticking in odd directions from where he’d been laying and Harry found it more than a little endearing.
"It might be sexier, but I'm not willing to risk damaging your skin to find out," Harry replied, burying his face against Draco's neck. He felt sleepy and content, but he wasn't the one laying in come or having it seep out his arse. Draco could solve the problem himself if he was so concerned about it.
Draco turned back and stuck his tongue out at Harry as childishly as possible. He then sat properly in his chair and scooted close to the table.
Harry wouldn't be able to look at a Christmas meal on that table the same way again, not with Draco spread out like a feast before him. Godrick but the man was delectable in nothing but his expensive briefs.
Potter stopped immediately. "What?" he said, looking around for the unknown threat. Draco pointed at the nearest splatter mark and shook his head urgently. Potter sighed, giving him an expression that was simultaneously indignant and indulgent.
I have included with this letter a bottle of my proprietary calamine and dittany blend. It should help with both concerns. (
Harry waited patiently for Draco to come out from under the dress. He bent down as far as he could comfortably go (nearly toppling over) and grabbed Draco around the waist to lift him up.
Apparently Draco didn't have a say in the matter. That was fine--he really was hungry and it would be challenging to forage for himself as he was.
Apparently the salacious rumors about Slytherin house were true. That was a disturbing thought. And of course Malfoy had waited until Harry'd taken another bite before saying all of that. It would be his luck to meet his end choking on a carrot because of the man's lack of filter and preponderance of cheek.
Maybe it was because he had never consummated a relationship before, but as eager as he had been against the door a minute ago it was also fairly easy to keep control of his libido. Much easier, it seemed, than for Harry.
He alternated broad swipes of his tongue with circles around the outside and probing thrusts, working Draco wet and loose until his jaw ached something fierce.
"You said something about... Auror escorts?" he leaned toward Harry as his voice deepened. "Does that mean you'll be following me around everywhere, all day and night?"
"Well then... Take me inside so I can exact the revenge I mentioned before. You know, the one where I promised to let you fuck my throat?"
Draco slumped against him when he finished and Harry wrapped the arm that had been holding him still around his chest to keep him steady.
"Let's play it by ear," Harry replied pragmatically, electing not to comment on the fact Draco was holding his hand so tightly he could feel his bones grinding against each other.
Draco tsked and went to baby whatever he had in the pan. Harry sidled up next to him and appraised the multi-part dish he had going. Not too shabby.
He didn't want to talk about it any more than was necessary. Lucius' appearance had been a bad omen: the day that started off so well ended with a frustratingly anti-climactic attempt to arrest Parkinson, who'd apparently gone to ground after they brought Zabini in. Supposedly no one had seen her since the day previous and the search of her home suggested that she'd packed up for a long trip (empty wardrobe, missing toiletries in the bathroom). He wasn't going to tell Draco, though. Not yet, anyway. He didn't want to worry him any more than was necessary--he dealt with enough anxiety already.
Once he was satisfied that his hair and body were properly rinsed, Draco turned to Harry, intending to take the soap and wash himself until an idea struck.
"Are we going to keep chatting about you fucking me," he goaded, spearing Draco with a challenging stare, "or are you actually going to do it?"
appeared as any other upscale restaurant would from the outside. The whole street, at first blush, seemed almost like Diagon Alley--and in a way it was, only far more expensive. There were shops, of course, including a chocolatier Draco occasionally frequented and an owlery down the street that he knew housed only Eagle owls. And all of Wizarding London's best fashion houses were crammed along the narrow alley (much larger on the inside with the judicious application of wizardspace).
. The one who'd glared at them for no discernible reason right before they'd been attacked by Devil's Snare.
"Lube," he ordered, shifting his arse to the edge of the desk for easy access. His years of wank fantasies of the man were foreplay enough.
vanish this if you prefer. I purposely wore some old clothes I have no love for anymore just for the occasion, as I was half-expecting to have to play literal doctor. I even brought my own special, home-made remedies with me," Draco hinted at the bag still perched on the bed as he spoke.
You're determined. And brave. Scoff all you want, but it took real courage to defy so many naysayers and come back here to finish your schooling and I have a lot respect for you for it.
"Rubbish does not belong on the ground, Harry," he admonished playfully with a smug smirk to match. He turned to quirk a brow at the man. "Coming?"
Pansy's once fiery glare turned frigid. She smirked in a way that just showed a sliver of teeth, making them appear fanged from that angle.
"Bollocks," Harry scoffed, fingering the edge of Draco's mask before untying the satin ribbon that held it in place. "It was completely sincere and you know it." He smirked into Draco's pale, pretty eyes (what right did he have to have lashes that thick and long? Harry'd never noticed before because their colour was so light they were hard to see from a distance). "But if you need more convincing," he purred, cupping Draco's cheek and sliding his hand around to the back of his head to pull him down until their lips nearly touched, "I can give you more convincing."
He apparated them both to doorstep of his flat. There was no chance of Draco getting splinched with as tightly as he'd wrapped himself around Harry--he began taking Harry's trousers off before they even got inside.
," Draco panted in reply. "Fuck me like you mean it. Hard and deep. No stopping." He had to pause for breath between each phrase because Potter had complied immediately and it was glorious.
Draco moaned low as he was bucked into roughly. He fluxed his hips and stomach and squeezed his insides tight, otherwise allowing his bed partner to control their pace and movement. His hands gripped Harry's waist hard enough to bruise to keep his balance and not be accidentally knocked off.
P.S. Your desk is surprisingly clean and organized, despite its surface indicating otherwise. Bully for you!
Lucius waved a hand, as if to silently say Potter's dismissal and the finer details of how the blonde arrived meant little to nothing (and as far as Lucius was concerned, they did.)
Draco wasn't sure who moved first, but Potter was horizontal in a flash, stretched out on top of him with his fingers in Draco's hair and his tongue down his throat. Draco, for his part, had one leg wrapped around Potter's thighs while his greedy hands lifted his shirt to get at the blazing skin beneath.
"Wait, what?" Harry replayed Draco's words in a head that was woefully deprived of blood and slow to respond because of it. "You think I'm not me?" He cast
At first Harry wasn't sure who Lucius could have meant by someone he'd lost--unless old Snakeface was all that precious to him--but then he remembered the uncomfortable fact he'd done a good job of forgetting: that Lucius and Severus had had some kind of thing before Draco was born.
Draco gasped with genuine surprise. He stared, wide-eyed and shocked into speechlessness, up at his talented partner.
Pacing the length of the Burrow's crowded living room with an excess of agitation, Harry said the first thing that came to him.
"I did say there was plenty we could do leading up to sex... And you seem like you need some help," he smirked before undoing the top button. "Let's put my blow job theory to the test, hmm?"
Finally a directive Draco could comply with. It probably didn't hurt that the feeling Harry wanted him to focus on was good enough to have his toes curling.
I only meant I know you are capable of having "the best" among pure-bloods, so I found it surprising you'd apparently want me so bad. As for Parkinson, if things work out I'd thank her. I was tempted to keep the photo (it was rather captivating) but I would have felt guiltier about it every second if I did.
But then he calmed once again. There was no inappropriate touching or questions once he had Potter on the couch. No, he was perfectly happy just to make himself comfortable between his legs and on his chest, laying his head down on the Auror's shoulder. His breathing began to slow indicating he was falling asleep.
He put his work frustration aside and straightened his suit in the mirror. He had a date to get to and a handsome bloke to pick up.
"Hmmm... Well, besides this lovely new mark on my neck, what did you have in mind?" Draco quirked a brow. Their position was becoming an annoyance for his back, so he carefully crawled onto the surface again and sat at his place on Harry's lap--cradling his cock between his cheeks and curling his knees at Harry's sides. "I was thinking I would leave a bright and shiny new bruise right here at your jaw, but perhaps that isn't clear enough for others?"
Wine is a superior beverage, yes, but the menu this evening is a dangerous array of mixed drinks that I am sure to regret in the morning...though I am not nearly as inebriated as I seem to have led you to believe.
Did Malfoy even know he’d called him by his first name? It wasn’t unusual for him to refer to Harry as ‘Henry’ at the Centre but this was different. Was it an accident? Would he do it again? How was he—
"Well, technically," Draco had to pause between words to catch his breath, "Well, technically, you didn't obey any orders."
He set to work on the rest of Draco's buttons and rid him of the shirt, letting his hands roam freely over the delightful expanse of his long, lean torso and kissing a path from his collar bone to his mouth.
With one last suck across the dip, he set the spoon down into his empty ramekin and grabbed his napkin to dab fastidiously around his mouth.
...Which turned out to be nothing more an aguamenti charm, probably set to go off automatically every morning to keep the lawns looking so green.
"You won't get anything more out of me," Harry vowed, levelly as he could manage, clenching his hands at his sides. "No matter how long you sit there staring. So you can see yourself out or wait for an escort from Security, who I am going to summon now."
"To embarrass me, then," he ventured, knowing full-well he sounded like a right arse but feeling too committed at this point to quit.
"Come here, Teddy," Andromeda instructed, holding her hand out to him. "The adults need to talk. Let's see if we can help Kreacher in the kitchen."
The irreverent question, coupled with Malfoy's sultry drawl and trademark smirk, hit Harry like a punch of lust straight to the gut. Apparently what he had mistaken as the effects of the potion were actually just...Malfoy.
! Mrs. Weasley made it. Can we eat it before dinner? Grandma said we hafta wait 'til after dinner but it's your birthday so if you say we can eat it first, we should get to eat it first."
Gladys was grinning lewdly at her magazine when Harry approached. He'd already seen this one. Everyone had seen it. Neville (aka Hogwarts Herbology Hunk) had finally been talked out of his trousers. The issue sold out in record time.
"No, thank you," Harry replied, relieved. "I'd rather let them misconstrue my actions and fill their pages with baseless speculation than twist my actual words. I can laugh the former off much easier than the latter."
"Merlin, Potter," Draco exclaimed, throwing his arms over the shorter man's shoulders for balance, "if I'd known you were this eager, I would have had you over a desk ages ago."
"Hermione, Ron--Draco," he introduced; trying to move past the baggage of last names (and possible slurs). "Draco--Hermione and Ron."
Draco finally released the grip he had on Harry's ass and slid his hands instead to the Auror's hips. He pushed up, arching his body away lazily, and turned until he was facing Harry again. His arms went around Harry's neck and his lips moved to kiss and nibble along his jaw.
His hands were on the move again: first roaming over the Auror's hips and under the curve of his ass before grabbing both globes and squeezing tight. He shifted his legs apart to accommodate Harry's stance and forced their erections to rub together even harder by jerking him forward.
"Nor do I reciprocate the offer by inviting someone out to a bar for a drink or bring them lunch and tea," Draco replied with a particularly tight downward thrust. "As for the outfit, well, I receive compliments from everyone everyday. How was I supposed to know different when it came to you? Some of us actually
"Ah, yes. So I do," Draco chuckled as he took another helping of cake and ate it with a content sigh. "It has a truffle-like texture, I think. Now, tell me when you plan to have this dinner with Granger and Weasley. I suppose I should go shopping for some clothes... Besides what I tried to wear today, I still only have tight or revealing pieces, unless you don't consider backless things skimpy for a male?"
Harry's smile was slow and glittering. "It's not spoiling if you deserve it," he explained, beginning to unbutton Draco's shirt.
Since Draco was engaging Hermione in a conversation Ron wouldn't appreciate anyway, Harry took the opportunity to pull him aside with a nod at the door and a tightly spoken, "Ron, a word?"
If they went too far it might ruin the tentative relationship they were developing. It was like ripping skin off, forcing his mouth away from Potter's with a loud gasp. He squeezed Potter's fine, firm arse once before both hands moved to still his rolling hips.
How Malfoy could swing so rapidly from cocky swagger to sweet shyness was mind boggling. The nervous way he fidgeted made Harry want to leap to comfort and reassure, but he was trying to be better about his impulsiveness these days. Was a relationship with a man he'd known as an antagonist when they were boys and who was now little better than a stranger really something he wanted to jump blindly into?
Pretend I can barely wipe my own arse in order to trade your precious secrets to the very newspaper that spent more than a year dragging my name through the mud and
The blonde turned away to peer around the office, which was practically bare beyond a calendar on the wall and a poster of the Chudley Canons. Potter's desk had a few trinkets, but nothing spectacular. The other desk just a foot or so away, had a signed snitch, a number of strange little objects (toys from Weasley Wizard Wheezes?), and the chair had a Chudley Canons colored cover. He smirked to himself as he already knew who Potter's partner was. Apparently becoming a husband and father hadn't totally matured Weasley.
"Hm, no. I've had enough of walking for one day. After all, I did head straight for your place after a full day with Mother. Let's go back and... Relax a bit," and there was plenty of suggestion with that remark, wasn't there? "In fact, you should carry me! I'm running low on energy and if I am going to bear the label 'princess', then I should be entitled to a few perks--including riding my knight.
Harry did as he was told, pausing frequently to give Draco the opportunity to instruct him and watching closely for signs of distress. Draco remained quiet but he no longer appeared at risk of biting through his lip, at least.
"So, what now? We only just arrived at the park... Walk some more? Public sex? Or head back to your place?"
Harry shifted his attention inward, assessing his own magical stores. Like Malfoy, he found the well substantially replenished, the quiet hum of power singing through his veins when his metaphorical ears were attuned to it.
At first I was certain your owl had to be a prank. George is working on a forgery quill that magically duplicates people's handwriting--it's nearly indistinguishable from the real thing. But then I checked and found your magical signature all over the parchment and I owled your mother and she assured me that you are not in your right mind, which was frankly obvious from the content of your letter.
"I know it's my own fault, mind," his smirk returned. "Terribly sexy and all that. But I also admit it's hard to behave around you..."
Without further ado, he pulled Potter's zipper down as far as it would go, exposing a tempting vee of tanned skin from Potter's collarbone to the middle of his sternum. He bent forward to sample a taste, delighting in the musky, salty tang of fresh sweat. (One of the perks of the physically demanding job they shared.)
"Ohhh f-fuuuck...!" Draco drawled out as he dug his knees in, stiffened his mid-section, and held onto the headboard for dear life as he was roughly taken. His cock was growing hard again, despite its previous protest, though after his hard climax before the building up felt bruising.
Harry made a show of considering Draco's plate. "Well I guess since you ate most of it..." He drew out the words as if reluctant and stood to retrieve the French vanilla ice cream from the freezer.
likely to believe me if you knew who I was, I'm afraid. Hence the letters. Suffice it to say, I am not a Slytherin.
"I think I will," he replied, voice a silky combination of sex and threat. He tugged Draco's wand from his unresistant hold and set it in the grass near his thigh. He then took Draco's slender wrists in hand and pinned them loosely behind his back, making his chest open as his spine arched forward.
"We were just...uh...waiting for you," Potter said defensively, tugging at his fringe as he did so. Even without the tell, it was woefully unconvincing. His prevarication was so bad, in fact, that it probably had the opposite effect and made Granger think they had been up to something decidedly less innocent than a bit of play.
"You like it rough, do you?" he responded, voice like gravel. He withdrew completely and flipped Draco onto his stomach, hoisting his arse in the air before entering him roughly from behind. "That more to your liking, pet?" he drawled.
Harry did suck Draco's fingers, but not because he thought that would be sufficient lubrication--he knew enough about the mechanics (thanks to a book from Hermione, embarrassingly) to insist on real lube when it came to. No, he did it because it was fucking hot.
Draco maintained eye contact with Harry the whole time he worked himself down his shaft and, Godrick, that alone was almost his undoing.
Owl me in the morning if you still want to. I admit I am curious to know how much of this is the potion...
He hadn't had nearly enough fun in his life to date. So screw anyone who cocked an eye at two giggling blokes holding hands as they rounded the building just east of the Hall.
"Extenuating circumstances," Harry countered cheekily, tipping the bottle into Draco's glass and filling it to the brim.
Lastly, you may notice a distinct lack of Draco snark in the next couple of chapters (or rather not as much as there should be.) It'll return, and in full force. No worries.
"Like my outfit?" He asked as he held his arms out and stood straight from the column. "I'm hoping I'll be less likely to attend these things if I don't look the part of a proper guest."
Draco looked so comically sad over the mess he'd made of his clothes that Harry couldn't help but laugh--the man had (quite literally) brought it on himself, after all.
"Every time I saw you in Quidditch leathers, Auror robes, in those ridiculous muggle jeans... All I ever thought about was what it would take to get you naked and have you for all mine for a night. Longer if I could, but let's not get ahead of ourselves.
He nipped the edge of Draco's jaw and then his lower lip. Propping himself up on his arms and gazing down into Draco's wide-blown pupils, he asked, "What now?"
He released Draco's hip to begin unbuttoning his own shirt with his off-hand, maintaining the tempo of his right with little difficulty (he'd always been good at split-mind tasks). He finished off the buttons and opened his shirt to expose his chest and abdomen--scarred and lightly furred, but not unappealing, he knew.
He didn't know how good a job he was doing hitting Draco's prostate, but he sure could toss him off confidently. He let go of Draco's knee to take up his prick and wank him to completion, trying desperately to hold off his own impending climax long enough to see Draco through.
He was probably right. Harry fumbled with the door handle, grinning, and struggling to support the both of them.
Harry watched as his dinner companion set to his meal with dainty reserve--he was ready for seconds before Draco had even finished half his first. He didn't know if it was because Draco didn't care for the food or if it was just the way he ate. He supposed (with a private smile and a tiny flutter of...something...in his belly) that they'd have to have more meals together in order for him to find out.
He openly gawked without thought to the dress being wound about his body to the point of crushing as Draco began to casually undress. He chuckled to himself at the thought that the pureblood had wanted to be so presentable for Gieves not ten minutes earlier and now didn't seem care one whit what the tailor saw.
Draco keened, eyelids falling shut and fingers digging into his own thighs. Harry waited until he had his attention again--irritation flashing in his silver gaze this time. "I love you," he said, before pushing home.
"Happy birthday," he purred, leaning in for a kiss. Harry was not reluctant in reciprocating. Draco flicked his wand over his shoulder, shutting and locking the door without looking, and took Harry's mouth in a searing, possessive kiss.
Hermione had asked what it was about Draco that attracted Harry enough to overcome their years of negative history and risk of public censure. It wasn't an easy question to answer, but when it came down to it, Draco was fun. He excited Harry and challenged him. Irritated him and made him laugh. Kept him on his toes. Made things interesting.
Wrapping a flannel around his waist and walking with a decided spring in his step, Harry made his way upstairs to put on a t-shirt and well-worn pair of denims. He scrubbed the flannel over his head to get out the excess water and grabbed a change of clothes for Draco. They probably weren't up to his high sartorial standards, but beggars can't be choosers.
He didn't wait for an answer. Draco had given him permission to vanish the clothes, so they were gone in the blink of an eye and a flexing of Harry's will.
You know I wasn't going to ask, since you tend to be pretty tight lipped yourself, but why do you refuse to use first names when offered?
natural, by all rights, it was anything but. And to share such a connection with Malfoy? That was downright terrifying.
He summoned their server for the check and settled it with a sizable stack of galleons. Draco excused himself to the loo.
Harry froze. He hadn't planned on outing himself midway into the catastrophe that was their first date. Then again, he hadn't planned on getting attacked by murderous plants either.
With those tasks complete, he turned his attention to the large stack of files that had appeared on his desk sometime after he left yesterday.
won't be wanking here all the same. Your commentary was hilarious, though. Thanks anyway tor the thought (and the gifts).
And that is what you get for going into other people's bathrooms and using their toiletries without permission while "they" are away on a much-needed holiday from
He certainly didn't appreciate being called a coward--even implicitly--but a juvenile tactic like that should not affect a seasoned Auror like himself, who had been trained to resist physical and psychological torture of the highest magnitude. He could shake off an
"Tell me," he prompted, "what was it you had planned for the Garden before those stupid plants mucked everything up?"
How about that! I was planning on adopting someday, as well. Or asking one of my friends to be a surrogate mother. Hermione and Ginny both offered, actually, but I told them I wanted to wait until I have a stable partner. Teddy is a handful as a crazy toddler, I can't imagine how hard a
Pressing his own erection into Draco's leg, he began to wank Draco in earnest, trailing kisses down his neck and stretching himself almost to the point of pain to do so while still keeping Draco's arms pinned (because the Slytherin was so bloody
He pushed the curtain aside to take a look into Potter's shower. There was some soap, shampoo, a loofa... And a book. One Draco recognized. He grinned wide as he lifted the novel and peered at the cover.
"Mr. Billingsley," he said in greeting, trying for professional cordiality. He offered his hand...and was summarily dismissed with an upturned nose and disdainful sniff. That stung more than he let on (though turnabout was fair play, he supposed, remembering a scrawny pair of first years and a life-alteringly bad first impression).
"Your hand is so rough and warm," he practically moaned as he was fondled through the laces of his trousers. "I can't wait for you to touch my cock... To squeeze me and stroke me with those talented hands..."
," and tugged at Harry's pubes once again. He let go of the black curls to slide lower and tease the edge of the Auror's erection, petting his jutting hipbone and the stretch of skin between cock and thigh.
Oh well. He still liked the man (against his better judgment). Sex wasn't the only thing he was interested in. And this revelation took a lot of pressure off so--
With a final wet slurp and a playful swat, he released Draco's cheeks and kneeled at the foot of the bed, retrieving the abandoned bottle of lube. He unstoppered it and poured a generous amount into his hand to coat his aching member, pressing the extra into Draco's hole with two fingers when he was done.
I just realized that I neglected to answer your earlier question about my career choice. It is good of you to recognize my talent for Potions. While it
He shuddered when Draco pulled out--far too soon for his tastes--but smiled at the sweet, soft kiss he was treated to afterwards. He wouldn't have pegged the Slytherin for being such a softie. Wrapping still-shaky legs around Draco's waist (ignoring the twinge of pain in his hips at the gesture) and holding his face in both hands, he thrust his tongue inside Draco's mouth to kiss him hungrily.
I guess I'll just go into town and pull a muggle...or something. My secretary David likes me, apparently, but I am iffy about employee relations.
"Obviously that's me," he answered, resigned to his fate. He stepped back a pace to give the agitated man some breathing room, bumping his glasses up his nose as he did so. "And it should be equally obvious why I practice under an assumed name."
"You noticed him, too, eh? Not too subtle is he?" Draco chuckled. "It's whatever you want to do, love. I couldn't care less what they think or say. It would end up as gay-hate, Death Eater, Hero-Gone-Traitor, scumbag tripe no matter what we said. Perhaps it would be better to consult your Quibbler friend? What was her name... Luna, yes? If you really want to give a statement to the Prophet boy over there, however, I'll comply."
Draco licked his lips, which tingled pleasantly from what he assumed to be spearmint toothpaste. He certainly was telling the truth about having just brushed before Draco came over. He shook his head to regain his composure and huffed at the other Auror indignantly.
Harry pulled Draco in for an embrace. "Lucky for you I've got courage to spare," he grinned before kissing him soundly.
Bless her, she was on the right track, but it would be so much faster if he could just show her. He stood fully upright and reached for the book, grunting and snorting to get her attention.
he thought smugly, just before leaning down and swallowing Draco's hardening member to the hilt. Draco let out an adorable yip of surprise and Harry relished drawing out the tease with a slow, sucking drag up the shaft. When he got to the end, he flicked the slit with the pointed tip of his tongue, savouring the musky flavour of precome gathering there. He hummed in delight.
I dare you to write something embarrassing somewhere on your body. You may decide what and where. You won't have to show me--I trust your sense of honour to compel your follow through.
Draco lifted his hips, still pressed on by Potter, and jerked them forward. He made sure Potter was in the right position coming down to have their cocks rub together.
Draco chuckled darkly and leaned close enough to his date beside him to whisper in his ear, "Very good. It
"Then no more godchildren for you to spoil. Remember that!" Ron "warned" right back as they entered the kitchen. While they were gone, Hermione had made herself comfortable beside Draco, who seemed extra fidgetty from the unwanted additional attention.
"I suggest," he continued in a sultry tone as he leaned forward to bite Harry's jaw just below his ear, "that we continue our snogging session. Now that we're both sated, our cocks shouldn't be too much of a factor, and if they become one we can just sixty-nine them back into submission. Or mutual wanking. Or I could introduce you to some of my toys. One of them vibrates into your perineum while it fucks you--it's charmed to thrust on its own until you command it to stop."
At this rate Harry wouldn't last. His legs quivered and his moans grew louder as his bollocks tightened up, but the feel of Malfoy's hot, wet mouth and talented tongue wasn't something he wanted to spoil so soon.
"About that confession from before... Any chance the cute smile you threw me really meant something?"
Malfoy's face was unreadable--competing emotions chased their way across his sharp features so quickly Harry couldn't keep up.
Two more days if I am lucky. I can't actually tell if I am getting any better, but apparently that's normal.
He shook his head then snorted a laugh. "And you change course faster than an Abraxan foal. I think you have gone way too long without talking to other people."
"I am not in the habit of sleeping with individuals who are part of an ongoing investigation," he answered, fixing Malfoy with a serious expression. He was reminding himself just as much as the irrepressible tease, however. "Nor would I take advantage of someone who is emotionally compromised or under the influence of a potion. If you aren't in the mood to discuss your case, you can apparate or Floo home from here. In the meantime, I will continue trying to do my job."
He cleared his throat and rubbed the back of his neck, uncomfortable. He and Ron didn't usually have 'feelings talks.'
No treacle tart for you, I'm afraid. St. Mungo's checks for that sort of thing. We'll just have to get you one when you are finally released.
It was only after the pain had (mostly) subsided that he realized how very uncomfortable the rest of him was. His skin was once again sticky with long-cooled sweat, his spine bent at an unpleasant angle, the arm he had tentatively put around Malfoy (to prevent him from accidentally rolling onto the ground! Certainly nothing untoward) was half-numb from the effort, and he had a persistent itch under his right shoulder blade that he couldn’t possibly reach without disturbing the precarious balance of their perch. In spite of all that, if he was perfectly being honest with himself...it was rather nice to be sitting there holding Malfoy.
Harry grinned, pleased and relieved to have successfully navigated those treacherous waters. "I've always been clever," he asserted. "It's just hard to notice when I'm standing next to Hermione."
Harry's brain felt like treacle, his back muscles throbbed, and there was a vague buzzing in his ears but, all told, he was really quite content. His limbs were heavy and warm, his lust sated. Oh, and Draco Malfoy was in his bed. Spooning up next to him, in fact. And Harry couldn't be more pleased.
Draco approached the counter with a frown and a tight hold on Harry, before he could run after the family and possibly hex the father into the ground. He sighed and pulled his boyfriend to the counter.
"My office is closer," Harry argued with a saucy wink. He didn't want to wait any longer than was strictly necessary, but he also wasn't willing to invite Draco into his home just yet. Some risks were easier to mitigate than others (and his office was heavily warded on the off chance he'd seriously underestimated the man). He craned his neck to whisper in Draco's ear, "And I have clearance to Apparate anywhere in the building." He flicked his tongue out for a single, hot lick, and whisked them both to Level Two.
First name again. There'd been none of that when Granger was around. Draco didn't bother to reply, though he resolved to bite the git if he attempted bringing him to the infirmary.
"I'm going to suck you so hard you'll forget your name," Draco promised in a low, dark voice before sliding his tongue down Harry's length again and engulfing the head once he arrived.
"How long is it going to take you to accept that this is just bedtime?" Harry asked with affectionate exasperation. Draco smirked in response and pulled him to his feet, through the door, and toward bed--leaving the rest of Harry's now forgotten tart.
I threw a great many things away--I do hope you are not missing anything sentimental when you return. That would just be dreadful, would it not?
The blonde stretched himself out across his couch like a languid cat first: his legs straightening out over the seat, toes spreading, torso twisting slightly, and his elbows curling over the comfortable arm. After a quick yawn, he finally stood up and walked around the couch. He picked up his wand from where he left it on the dining room table (he no longer needed a wand for basic locking charms he had done them so often), visible from where Harry sat, and quickly returned.
"I can't feel past my waist," Harry answered in a strangled voice, panting desperately for air. His face was red from exertion. "Aren't these things... For slimming? I don't think a man's ribs are meant to bend... This way...
"It's been a short while, but you ought to know before you do this... I love you. And I guarantee I'll be that much more attached afterward, so you better not toss me away in the morning! You don't have to feel the same, mind, and I'll completely understand if you don't. Just... I figured you should know."
"I wouldn't say no to you being starkers," Harry answered with a roguish grin, "but you might catch a chill. Grimmauld can get draughty."
--Harry wasn't sure if he wanted to kiss or curse whoever had helped the handsome git select his outfit at the sporting goods store. The skintight black Under Armour ensemble left very little to the imagination and was far more flattering than a base layer shirt-and-shorts combo had any right to be. Though Malfoy was skinnier than his lean frame could rightly justify, the long lines of his body were as appealing as ever and a few weeks of proper diet and exercise would lend him that bit of healthfulness he was missing. Harry would see to it that that happened.
Settling on a time-tested move--one that he'd enjoyed immensely the last time he tried it--Draco smiled innocently as he offered Harry some of his chicken, presenting it on his fork with a casual air. The Auror, of course, hesitated, but upon Draco's smile turning slowly into a hurt pout he gave in. Just as his lips wrapped around the morsel, Draco's bare foot found its way into Harry's lap and pressed.
As soon as Potter's brow twitched at his challenge Draco knew he had won. It was the man's tell, from as far back as second year. Apparently he had not figured it out yet. The fork fell to the plate and the happy screaming was back in full force in Draco's head. He remained silent and passive as Potter approached. A breathy "Harry" escaped into the Auror's mouth just as their lips connected. It was an awkward angle for the man, he knew, but an opportunity like this wasn't guaranteed to come again--he wouldn't waste it. Putting what experience he had and all the research and study he had done to good use (at last), he tilted his head into the sudden kiss to allow full access to his mouth, which parted with an intent for more. He licked the pink edge of Potter's lips in question.
Draco practically cackled under his breath when Harry groaned. A triumphant smirk played about his lips as he settled into his seat just in time for dinner to arrive. The server girl bustled about professionally enough, but there was light pink on her cheeks--possibly from observing his thumb sucking. He quirked a brow as her breasts came too close to hitting him in the face (they were quite large. How did she not fall under the weight?), but soon she was gone and in her busty place their starters. Draco's mouth, much to his own surprise, watered from the smell of pea soup laced with--he sniffed more closely--mint and panna cotta.
-ed his own wand to clean their mess. Already Harry was falling asleep, as he always did after sex. Draco on the other hand was only mildly exhausted, but didn't have the heart to force a sleepy Potter to remain awake--he was cute when he was tired or sleeping. Instead, he got comfortable, held his lover close, and forced himself to sleep by going over every Ancient Rune he could recall (which was nearly all of them.)
“What time is it?” Malfoy asked slowly, getting his bearings while he remained perfectly ensconced on Harry’s lap. His voice was deeper, slightly husky, rough around the edges and not quite as crisp as in full wakefulness. And it did dangerous things to Harry, summoning thoughts and associations that would have been risky on a good day but were downright suicidal with Malfoy lounging in proximity to his groin.
Draco bent his knees and laid his left leg at his side as the other hovered above the bed over his hip. He held his upright knee with one hand as the other gripped the blanket and squeezed. His brows furrowed as he was slowly penetrated by a single digit.
When he couldn't possibly eat another bite, he moved away from the carnage on his half-empty plate to groom himself meticulously. Only once he was clean did he check on Potter, still eating quietly behind him.
He turned his eyes to Harry's chocolate confection and unconsciously licked his lips at the sight. He did love chocolate...
In "retaliation", he used his leg to rub into Harry's insistent hardness, still partially pressed against his thigh.
Draco laughed as he was dragged down to the couch, purposely landing on the Auror's lap--awkwardly at first, until he got comfortable and settled on the man's thighs with his hands on Harry's waist. He grinned mischievously.
Potter retrieved his spectacles from the nightstand and balanced them on his nose. "Well, it's still bloody impressive. Wizards have been trying to figure out a potion like that for almost as long as there have been animagi."
"Keep touching me, just like that," Draco breathed as he grabbed for Harry's wand near the bottle of lubricant. He quickly cast the necessary spells, opening Harry's way.
"I'm ready," Draco panted, pressing himself up on his forearms to look back at at his partner. Potter grinned, mouth and chin shiny with saliva he hadn't taken the time to wipe, green eyes heavy-lidded and dark under long, sooty lashes. He'd lost his spectacles at some point, Draco noted belatedly.
Harry wanted to keep snogging but he couldn't support himself on one arm and continue doing what he was doing with the other (and that job took precedence at the moment).
He cleared his throat so that his next question wouldn't come out a strangled squeak. "How can you be so sure I won't bore or anger you?" He would hate to make up his mind about Malfoy only to have the fickle man rescind his offer.
"Do it," Draco released his leg when his arm started to cramp and instead used it to caress the side of Harry's face, his thumb pressing into the skin of Harry's lips. He stared up into Harry's brilliant, practically glowing green eyes with a trace of uncertainty, but it wasn't for the act they were about to commit. Draco turned his eyes away for a moment, closed them with a deep breath, and then turned back looking determined.
"No," Arthur murmured. "I don't reckon it is." He turned to Harry and leveled him with a gaze that may as well have been legilimency for all he could resist it.
"She's in the zone," Potter explained, grinning ruefully. "A cauldron could explode in here and she might not notice." He swiped the book from Granger--who protested shrilly--and set it before him, even going so far as to open it to the correct potion-stained page.
If you don't want me, that's fine. But I refuse to hear you or anyone say that you're not worthy of me. I am the only one who gets to make that decision and I am more than a little peeved you would suggest otherwise.
"And, no, I am not scared to dance with a man," he added tightly (because Malfoy's taunt demanded a reply), "but that was not part of my agreement with Robards for this event. I demand at least a week of paid leave if he expects me to dance."
"I see," Draco continued with his slow, deep pace as he spoke. "I'll be sure to cancel my appointments, then, just as soon as I fuck you into oblivion."
Draco huffed a laugh as he turned to look at Harry again. The man was rumpled and sweaty once more, but looked so casual, even as he sported a throbbing erection between his thick, hairy thighs. Draco lifted a hand and pushed it into Harry's chest, splaying his fingers across a firm, equally hairy pectoral.
But it wasn't a bluff. He'd meant every word. He just hadn't been thinking all that clearly when he said them. Or, rather, wrote them.
This time just four months ago they had been exchanging family gossip and laughing at a private cafe. It seemed so unreal to think she was really out to get him, but the evidence was right there--promising to have him gang-raped and laughing at the idea (well, had been. She was now cursing at the top of her lungs).
Besides food, they had continued experimenting until very few things were left from their sexual repertoire, including actual penetration. In between ruts, their conversations grew increasingly intimate (and Harry had even convinced him to read his smut out loud, which turned into another kink). No one would have to worry about the health of their sex drives for a long time, it seemed.
"When did you start wearing it so long, by the way?" he inquired, pouring the finished batter into buttered ramekins (and sneaking a taste from the bowl).
"Allow me to approach this subject from another angle," he began as he sat at the chair before Potter's desk. "What will it take to get you to break up with him?"
"You're stalling," Lucius said simply. "Bringing up the past won't sway me. I lost someone quite precious due to those mistakes and I won't let them happen again. My son, in particular, means more to me then you will ever know... or believe.
In response to Harry's warning, Draco drew back, but not all the way off. The knowledge that he wanted Harry to come in his mouth combined with the additional stimulation from his hands was enough to push him over the edge.
The draught worked wonderfully. Draco's body had no immunity to the potion, having avoided the stuff nearly all his life, and the result was obvious. He stretched himself out in a style reminiscent to the time Potter had come to visit: arms sliding above his head (his tight shirt riding up), legs spreading out with toes straightening, and his back arching high. After the stretch, he leaned forward and pinned the Auror with a sultry smile.
"It is," Draco said simply as he licked his spoon. He laved the back of the silver utensil until it was devoid of chocolate. Even when he spoke, he hardly paused in his eating. His dessert was actually finished off before Harry's. He smirked. "For an amateur."
"None for me, thanks," he replied with forced politeness about the apparently spiked punch. No way was he trusting any drink the Slytherin had tampered with. "I'm representing the Ministry tonight."
Feeling no small measure of consternation, he attempted moving the conversation into safe, familiar territory.
"If we get out of this okay you can yell at me all you like," Draco whispered in concern. "I don't care, just don't do anything rash."
It used to be that he said it to everyone he dated, starting with Ginny, until he realized that it wasn't true. What he felt was similar, but not the same: fondness, lust, infatuation, attachment.
He'd joked to Draco that he wouldn't know what to do with himself without him there (despite having lived alone since Hogwarts and rather enjoying his solitude under normal circumstances), so Draco thoughtfully left a copy of his latest work in progress. ('
"How do we place our order?" he asked, more than ready to move on to the next phase of their dinner.
However, he knew why it mattered to Potter: because it was Potter. Mentioning the needle may have been a mistake, and now the Slytherin wondered why he had mentioned it at all.
"Merlin's tits!" Harry yelped. He didn't turn around, though. That would give her too much satisfaction. No, he marched with as much dignity as he could muster to the owlry (arsecheek stinging all the while) to set up his appointment with Malfoy and request permission to access the restitution fund records. It would be easier for him if Malfoy was willing to meet at his office but Harry offered to return to his residence if he'd rather. Now that he'd been there once, he could apparate directly to the front door, at least.
within its ancient walls... At first he thought it was because he was so comfortable with Harry, before he recalled that Grimmauld belonged to the Blacks; that meant that this was one of his ancestral homes. Of course he belonged.
Draco concentrated on Harry's hansom, though a bit muggle, outfit versus the idea of the crowd surely awaiting them. The stares and gossip he could handle without issue (he was used to them), but it was the strong possibility they might be approached... By anyone... That made him most uneasy. He took a long breath, kissed Harry's temple (silently begging not to be left alone anywhere), and walked with Harry through Diagon Alley.
"... I knew this was too good to be true. Harry Potter hates me. What paper do you work for and how much am I going to have to pay to keep your mouth shut?"
Draco nodded curtly for greeting and he received much the same treatment back, with an added dubious glare from Weasley. However, in the interest of Harry and not wanting to be rude, Draco quickly offered a smile that was somewhat awkward but at least it hadn't been a sneer.
"Only if I want them to mount a rescue effort," Harry countered with a grin, pressing his chest into Draco's and wrapping his arms around his waist. "In this case, I am a willing hostage. But if you think to try anything funny," he warned, mostly (but not entirely) joking, "don't forget that I am the Head Auror for a reason: even with all the dark and mysterious artefacts at your disposal, you couldn't hold me against my will."
"I know it hurts," he murmured, meaning the bone-deep ache that came from physically pushing oneself as Malfoy had done. As he'd been instructed to do. "That'll get worse before it gets better. But it does get better, in time." Small consolation in the midst of it, he knew. He pushed a hand through his hair, regretting his inability to offer comfort of any value.
Without knowing an address for Malfoy's house, and seeing no better options at present, he tossed the powder into the flames and called out, "Number 12 Grimmauld Place."
Sarah, thankfully, was only too happy to allow him the use of her phone--she'd never seen him so ruffled (and that was saying something considering his recent preoccupation with a particularly rufflesome individual). Harry promptly called the police to report suspicious activity and took great satisfaction in spying a harried-looking reporter scuttling off some twenty minutes later, after having been questioned at length by two brawny bobbies (who were none too keen on grown men leering at unaccompanied schoolchildren). Back to whatever hole he crawled out of, Harry thought smugly.
"I'm not easy," he countered. "Just because it took you and 'Mione years to finally shag doesn't mean the rest of us need to operate on that timeline." He dodged the quill Ron threw at him in response and continued, "Malfoy's not the first bloke I've fancied. You know that as well as I do. He's just the first I've been willing to consider actually taking the gamble on."
"Harry," Draco breathed in surprise as he flashed him a smile, "What happened to your rule about not spoiling me or I might start expecting it all the time?"
Malfoy took it and inspected it closely. "What's this?" he frowned. (Pinched brows, slightly downturned lips... Confusion; Harry was getting good at identifying them.)
However, there wasn't time to think about how to level the playing field, not with Harry's hand gripping his cock even tighter and his nipple being twisted so pleasantly. Those machinations would be saved for another day. Draco leaned back into Harry, his head lolling onto his shoulder. The bite to his tender muscle was a bit of a surprise, though not because of the bite itself... But because of the intense suckling and teeth digging--the intention of leaving a purposeful mark--that shocked the blonde Slytherin.
"And please feel free to leave the deadly plants off the menu," he quipped, taking up the soap once again. "It's too bad we didn't get to do what I had planned in the Garden Room, though I have faith that your plans will more than make up for it."
If there was a silver lining to be found, maybe Robards would think twice before forcing him to attend the next stuffy society function.
robes," yet, he didn't seem to mind letting the ravenette curl a leg over his thigh or snuggling closer. If anything, he was struggling not to
charm. 8:43. He'd promised Robards he would stay til nine (in exchange for a three day weekend the following week). Deciding the enemy he knew was better than the one he didn't, he angled his body towards Malfoy and crossed his arms.
Harry still hadn't had a chance to catch his breath, but he was quite all right with it now. At some point during that glorious snog, he'd released Draco's sides to clap at the lean muscles of his back. They bunched and flexed deliciously with Draco's ministrations, which were almost too good to even consider.
Draco rolled his eyes at Harry for the princess quip, but the kiss easily stole his attention. He wanted to lean in for more, and was already headed that way, his lips gently grazing Harry's when the idea of street food was mentioned. Draco leaned back and raised an incredulous brow.
"'Any minute', you said? You may want to move a little faster. Or does the thought of seeing me nude intimidate you that much?"
"You don't seem the type to enjoy flowery words and sweet nothings, so I'll say this... Either take off your clothes and let me feel your thick, hot cock inside me or I'm taking tops his time."
Turning to Harry, he blurted, "I know why you would have rushed to accuse me ten years ago but why on earth would you do it now? What did you think I stood to gain from sending the papers after you?"
"Do you want a third," he asked, "or....?" He left the rest of the question unspoken, suddenly shy about the phrasing.
"I didn't think you wanted me," Draco admitted. "I was only planning to flirt a little tonight, but then I knew and changed my mind."
Draco sighed into Harry shoulder and closed his eyes, giving way to sensation as his body was loosened. He kissed the flesh he met there before slowly sitting up right once again. When asked, Draco smirked devilishly and shoved the sick man back onto the bed.
"I knew he was lying the next day when I saw my private doctor and asked him to look. I was fine. Blaise apologized, bought me lots of sweets, and never tried it again so I let it go... But he did try to grab me a few times, annoyed me until I would watch him have sex, and climbed into my bed naked a few times... Considering how the whole house was, I thought it was normal. Everyone was fucking someone and usually with someone else."
Draco rolled his eyes and let Harry's arse go to dig his heels and the balls of his hands into the mattress. They were still hanging off the edge of his bed, which made leverage a little tougher but Draco succeeded all the same as he pushed himself along the bed--wriggling his hips and bucking off to dislodge Harry in the process- until he was sitting, knees up, in the middle of the bed.
, especially after everything he had done during the War, was such a far cry from reality for him that every day he spent with the man felt almost like a dream (though all of that was far too Hufflepuff to ever admit out loud.) Finding out Blaise and Pansy, his two closest confidants, might truly be "out to get him" was just as unbelievable and practically Earth shattering. And he hadn't been allowed to speak to either them, by floo or owl. Draco had expected them to at least attempt to speak with him, though--orders to avoid him or not, but received nothing. It almost felt like weird cosmic sacrifice--Pansy and Blaise in exchange for Harry. One he was more than willing to make if they were really behind any of the attacks.
"Mmphmf," Harry replied around a mouthful of eager Slytherin. He walked Draco backwards until they both tumbled onto the sofa, their kisses becoming more urgent with the introduction of the horizontal plane.
I've got a black market pensieve memory that somehow missed burning in the cleansing fire you might find interesting...
How did he want to proceed? His stomach growled again, having a clear opinion on the subject. "How about we do dinner, for starters," he chuckled, rubbing the back of his neck in mild apprehension. "I can throw something together, if you'd like to stay?"
Harry, for his part, was far from calm, but he remained silent. In the tense moment that followed Teddy squirmed free from Andromeda's grasp and came barreling into him, peppering him with a barrage of questions and comments faster than a speeding Snitch. "Uncle Harry! Uncle Harry! It's your birthday! We surprised you! Were you very surprised? Why were you kissing Cousin Draco? There's gonna be cake! With
Harry tried to keep the tension he felt out of his muscles. That was a damned loaded question if ever there was one.
He repositioned himself so that his legs were curled over Harry's clothed hips and squeezed, his arms held stiff above his head.
Draco pulled his wand from his thigh holster and redressed the Auror (mostly, he wasn't quite done oggling the man's lovely cock so he purposely left that out) and cleaned his lover with a quick pair of spells. Once that task was accomplished, he put the wand back in its sheathe and climbed into Harry's still exposed lap, knowing he was too spent for the action to be arousing. He hugged Harry's neck and pressed his lips against the other man's in a sweet, soft kiss.
Not only is the glow still present, but I think it has intensified. I don't even need a Lumos to see when I walk around the flat at night.
Sarah--sweet, lovely Sarah--patted his arm and shooed the other two away. "You have patients waiting" she chided, unconcerned by the twin sour expressions that earned her. "Harpies," she muttered behind their retreating backs.
Two hours, one interrogation, and a hefty dose of veritaserum later and Harry had secured a written confession. Goyle admitted to attacking Draco in the club, but denied all knowledge of the Devil's Snares in the restaurant.
Draco thrust up against Harry's straining erection, effectively silencing his wayward thoughts and crumbling the last of his meager resistance.
"So, what are we waiting for? It's a Saturday, nothing is going on, and I'm bored as hell! Let's go interrogate a bird in the name of Princess D. Oh, and be careful if you go near Gladys. She's mad you're 'cheating' on her."
Draco sighed. He hadn't been concentrating much on his mind (hoping he could distract Harry enough to have him forget their conversation.)
Both arms had been forced around Harry's neck and he instinctively curved himself into the Auror to center his weight. In the mean time, and it was possibly quite a dumb move (especially considering his most recent request), Draco leaned in close to breathe gently on Harry's ear while nipping and licking the shell.
Draco panted and gasped above him, eyelids fluttering, bottom lip pulled tight between his teeth, hair a sweaty mess from the exertion (and Harry pawing at it), jumper rucked up to reveal a pale stretch of skin, and trousers undone just enough for him to get at his leaking prick.
you! I know we haven't spent that much time together, but I would think you'd know--" he choked on an almost-sob, but swallowed it down along with whatever else he was going to say. "Forget it. I'm getting the manager and sorting this shit out."
"Fine. But I had better at least be a pretty princess or I will withhold other things far more satisfying than your dessert."
He went straight for the mantle. He had a burning question and no time to waste. It took a moment to locate the Floo powder, but as soon as he did he tossed a pinch of it into the fire.
"So impatient," he tsked, nipping Draco's bottom lip. "Remember 30 seconds ago when I said I was going to do this right? I meant that."
He was tempted to kiss Potter until he had no choice but to smile... Unfortunately, Draco--even in his addled state--knew what a horrible idea that would be.
Remembering how well the ploy had worked last time, he took a step into Malfoy's periphery, near enough that the man could turn to look at him if he wanted without compromising his balance, and prepared himself for a confession of sorts.
Harry gave an affronted gasp and yanked the book from Malfoy's thieving clutches, dumping everything off his lap as he stood. "I said
He gave Harry's cheek a noisy kiss before letting him go in exchange for the Auror's hand. Draco winked.
That would explain the relatively sudden emergence of such pronounced symptoms, then. Malfoy had seemed fine at the Ministry's Holiday Gala last year (not that Harry had been paying particularly close attention or anything).
"You did well, Auror Potter. Who knew you had taste?" Draco chuckled, picking up a pair of complimentary opera glasses sat upon a golden stem. He looked at the contraption curiously. He recognized what they were, of course, but they were bent into the stem. A moment or two of experimenting finally released the binoculars and he snapped them into place properly. Draco held them up with a triumphant grin.
Malfoy looked as though this pleased him. His expression didn't change, per se, but there was some subtle current beneath it that Harry picked up on.
Well, what am I supposed to do then? It isn't as if (normal, private) men are knocking down the door to have sex with me (despite what you think), and the few that do openly want me are just in it for celebrity status, which means even if it's a one-time pull I can't be too careful, because likely as not it'll end up in the Prophet.
Following directions was not one of Malfoy's strong suits (no real surprise there). Harry went to get the vegetables he was supposed to add to the skillet and did it for him, stepping back quickly to avoid a face full of hissing steam. He then filled a bowl with boiling water for couscous and saved the rest for tea.
"I'm not going to try to justify it," Harry went on. "I was inappropriate and out of line. I shouldn't've accused you, and I definitely shouldn't've come to your home to do it. I was wrong. And I'm sorry."
Harry barked a laugh. "You are delightful, you know that?" he replied jovially, leaning forward to drop a quick kiss on Draco's knee. He didn't hesitate after that, though. There was a fine line between an irritated Draco and a frigid Draco.
Lots of people. Who would want to hex and/or badly injure him, or worse. He gulped as discretely as he could, held his head up high, and attempted his old cocky mien that had seen him through other rough times.
Even with the slightly bickering quality to their conversation (or maybe because of it), he was having a good time. He chomped four chips at once and lead Draco around a bend. The park was in sight now, green treetops over a wrought iron fence.
"It's not the only way," he responded carefully after first clearing his throat to dislodge the unpleasant dryness that had settled in. He gestured to a tall, lanky kid in basketball shorts and a loose-fitting tee (Adrian Allard, 16, promising young point guard--torn ACL) doing agility drills with a ladder, and then to a slow-moving pensioner wearing a dull grey sweatsuit (Harold Larsen of Chelsea, 62, hip replacement) huffing and puffing on a stationary bike. "It's perfectly fine, though."
He laughed. "Guess I'm not a princess anymore, eh? Though I admit, I think I look sexy with long hair... Then again, when I am not?" There was plenty of mock snobbishness behind the smirk he sported. "So, my not-so-charming knight, what did you have in mind? And yes, you're still a knight and I still expect to be protected if a dragon comes by. Or murderous plants. Speaking of... Have you ever heard of the Tentacular? Curious new sex toy for the tentacle fetish. It's based off the Devil's Snare, of all things!"
Teddy made a weak sound of protest. "I was just arranging it on the counter," he claimed, scuffing the toe of his shoe against the floor.
There was something just so damned beautiful about watching Potter get so worked up, and over Draco of all things. A light blush tinted his pale features as he stared on at the passion being displayed right there in his living room.
Your eyes are the most stunning I've ever seen. It's too bad they're always hidden by those godawful specs.
The chips weren't spicy. Not even a little. They had a dash of pepper, sure, but that hardly constituted
His wandering mind came back to Malfoy. Harry could just picture him insulting a poor, cowering sous chef until the girl broke down in tears. Could see him smirking haughtily as his restaurant earned its third Michelin star. Trailing warm chocolate sauce down his--
Why do you want me to call you fit? You don't need me to remind you, narcissistic git. Everyone already knows.
Potter, the insufferable imbecile, sat there in his damp towel, grinning and clapping like he was at the bloody circus. He kept remarking how clever Draco was and that his "tricks" were brilliant.
Rubbing his fists against eyelids that felt like sandpaper, Harry reckoned he was hardly any better than the people who'd rushed to accuse him of every wrongdoing for so much of his life: the Dursleys; the Press; the wizarding public; Malfoy, once upon a time; Snape (though his reasons were more complex). For all that they had made his days a living hell, they'd at least had
"Merlin, Draco," Harry breathed a deep sigh of relief. "I was worried about you. I'm fine." He took in Draco's disheveled appearance--the man looked like he'd been in a fight with a rabid quill. "What in the world have you been up to?"
He remained still as Harry twirled and tugged at it. It was an oddly pleasant feeling to have his hair played with--another first for him. Of course, his mother used to brush and style it when he was younger, but it had never been touched just for the sake of doing so.
"Yes, I am," Draco removed his hands as Harry reached full chub and stood, carefully making his way back to his seat and settling back down--just in time for the girl to push back the curtain and enter with their desserts.
"I know you live alone here now, but what about your elves?" he asked in response to the suggestion he undress early. "Wouldn't they be uncomfortable seeing me walk around in the all together?"
Harry crossed his arms, smirking. "Do you mean to tell me you didn't research Mr. Collins ahead of time?"
Harry kneaded his right leg without thought, the idea of what he was about to say triggering phantom pain.
Malfoy demurred, though he was obviously pleased. (Harry’d figured early on that compliments were the best way to Malfoy’s heart, but they had to be genuine or they’d backfire; fortunately it worked out that Malfoy had no shortage of praiseworthy material in Harry’s book).
There's no good way to say this and I apologize sincerely if I offend, but how do I know I won't see the things I write to you in the papers or another godawful unauthorized tell-all exposé?
To his relief, Draco didn't linger, instead moving the flat of his palm back up Harry's spine and wrapping his other hand around Harry's front to card through the hair on his lower abdomen. His prick strained at the nearness of Draco's hand and he subconsciously widened his stance and canted his hips in silent plea, bracing his hands on the wall as he did so.
Malfoy pursed his lips. "I couldn't care less what you choose to do with your time," he answered testily. Harry resisted the urge to snap back, reminding himself of his surlier patients and the calm, helpful demeanor that usually worked to deflate their bad attitudes. "If you would please refer me to another clinic with a high caliber therapist
"I hope that's not the only reason you requested me as a partner," he said teasingly, getting into position all the same. His mouth watered at the sight of Potter's thick, swollen prick. A pearly drop of precome gathered at the slit and he leaned forward to lap it up.
"Don't worry... I promise to take care of your stuff should you die during the visit. I'll use Grimmauld Place to store my porn."
Harry's anger rose (along with sickening bile in the back of his throat). That Draco would even consider letting either of his so-called-friends rape him--because, let's not split hairs, that's what he was describing--just so he could keep them happy made his wild magic snarl and snap.
He looked like shit: well-dressed, fit, and surprisingly put together, but exhausted, emotionally worn out, shaken to his core. He hid it well, but Harry could read it plain as day in the tight draw of his shoulders and the pinched lines around his mouth.
As he rounded the corner to close in on his prey, he noted smugly that Draco hadn't told him to keep his hands to himself.
He went through a battery of questions regarding the onset and progression of Malfoy's condition, his nutrition, exercise, and sleeping habits, recreational activities, support systems, and other relevant information. He did a bang-up job maintaining a cooly disinterested expression at Malfoy's admission that he was not currently sexually active. (
"Any form of heavy activity is bad for the flu, but if you're going to be so insistent I suppose there is no point in trying to dissuade you." Draco barely suppressed a smile as he playfully turned his head so that his chin was properly up. "You seem to be 'well enough' to do most of the work, so you can do the fucking."
He spent a few moments looking around the room, ignoring Harry completely. Harry took a steadying breath and tried to see it through his eyes.
I am afraid your Great Gitness will have to make do without me. I am on medical quarantine and cannot return to work until St. Mungo's clears me.
And what ever happened to the girl Weasley? And the rest of the Golden Trio? Are they married yet? Popping out curly-headed, ginger-haired children by the dozen? If not, it is only a matter of time, I'm sure.
Draco turned in several circles and scratched compulsively at the cushions before he was ready to lay down. Potter returned a minute later with a bottle of pumpkin juice and a saucer of water.
. His drunken fooling about with other blokes had been limited to over-the-trousers action. Now, however, faced with Draco's very real, very present erection, he was both intimidated and intrigued.
Harry indulged Draco for a few minutes (it was hardly an imposition), but the hardwood floor was unforgiving and Draco was made out of a great many pointy parts so it wasn't long before his discomfort won out over his enjoyment of what was otherwise a brilliant snog.
Draco jumped back and looked around the kitchen as the glasses suddenly began to shake and clatter. He thought for certain he felt the house itself shake as Harry grew suddenly angry. Draco tensed and watched Harry wide-eyed as he dashed from the room--and watched in both terror and fascination as Harry conjured a huge ball of intense, swirling fire. Draco didn't dare move until that light was distinguished, staring unblinking at the display. Once it was done Draco shakily moved to stand on his feet and walk into the living room, choosing to stand by the edge of the kitchen floor instead of approach too quickly.
He dropped to the floor, grateful for the plush rug before the hearth providing his knees with a cushion and radiant heat from the fire to keep him warm, and lifted the hem of the dress to reveal Potter's lovely prick once again. It was by no means massive, but it was more than adequate for his purposes, with a pair of close-shaven bollocks to match.
He watched the tawny owl glide through the window and idly wondered if Malfoy would still be in his pyjamas when it arrived. He then gave himself a mental shake. He had no business thinking about Malfoy in his pyjamas...even if the penguins sliding on their bellies and having tiny snowball fights were kind of cute. And Malfoy without a shirt was--
When he could, he traced his finger tips along Draco's crack and circled his furrowed pucker, giving him a chance to get used to the feeling of his fingers before gingerly pressing one inside.
"Is that answer enough for you?" he panted (sexily?) after wiping his mouth with the back of his hand.
"Yes, I will. Not what I expected, but this means far more than just a claiming trinket," Draco breathed, slowly regaining his composure as he shifted his thoughts and anxiety around to focus once again on Harry. "That actually does mean a lot to me. But what if someone attacks us? And your job... Isn't it already hard considering who you are and how many out there hope to challenge you for it?"
Thus settled, he pushed off the wall, intent to return to the birthday festivities...when Draco pushed him right back to claim a greedy snog and grope. Harry yelped when his arse was rudely pinched.
I am honoured to be counted among those you trust "not to run their mouths." Your secret is safe with me. Strange, isn't it?
"...Maybe Greg misunderstood Pansy?" he offered meekly after a minute. "He has had a crush on her forever, so maybe he just
You Gryffindors are such obstinate prudes. Do you really think no one has ever wanked in St. Mungo's before? And if word of it did get out, what would the headline be, "Harry Potter Has A Sex Drive! And Other Facts That Should Surprise Abolutely No One"?
"It is far too early to be drinking too much, and considering the past week... What is in my glass is all I am having before I become an alcoholic. Even being born with the stuff in my veins does not mean it should become a crutch for emotional distress."
Harry's tongue felt heavy and awkward in his mouth. He wanted to call out. To say goodbye, at least. Even a grunt of acknowledgement.
Do you know your owl became a symbol of peace after the war? I imagine you did. It might surprise you to learn, however, that I had her painting commissioned by an artist who has reproduced her likeness before: your friend Ms. Lovegood. I hope I am not being insensitive by having had this made but I know how you miss her. Having never had a pet, I can't say I understand such a bond, but I easily recognize how devastating it can be to lose one. May this gift bring you even a fraction of the peace your Hedwig represents.
"Mmm, you're so hard," he moaned, playing it up for effect, tightening and relaxing his fist on Draco's prick. "I bet you want to come. Do you, Draco?"
By "then some", do you mean that after I rip your clothes off, I get to suck you dry and shag you all night?
Harry delighted in the sounds Draco was making, from the unrestrained noises of pleasure to the flippant commentary, even the wet squelch of his prick sliding between his fingers.
Draco unlocked the door, but didn't open it. He was washing his face for the fifth time until his skin was flushed and his bangs were damp. He had changed his outfit into a "Harry-approved-for-guests" button-up shirt and folded trousers.
No longer sticky with spit, sweat, lube, and drying come, he straightened his clothes and attempted to coax some manner of style into his hair, giving it up for a bad job after a few pointless tries.
He took the seat across from Draco and put his forearms on the table, decorum be damned. He leaned forward on to them in order to be closer to his date when he proclaimed, "I think you just like being difficult."
"You--How did--I am stuck between extremely turned on and impressed. I've heard of some wizards and witches who could move things or do simple spells with their minds, but
"You're so sexy, Harry," he purred, carding his fingers through the ample fur on Harry's abdomen. "And the noises you make...!"
Of the rest of the individuals in attendance (besides Luna, who continued smiling sweetly), one snarled, three blushed and stammered, and the pair of idiots laughed like hyenas.
Or at all, apparently. The last of his control left him when Harry decided to look up and lock eyes, which was an impossibly erotic sight with those shockingly green irises of his (the stuff of many years' worth of fantasies). His mouth opened to speak a warning but nothing more than an odd whine escaped as he came.
I am fairly certain that soliciting sex from a muggle while your prick is lit up like a Christmas tree is a violation of the Statute of Secrecy. But
His snapped his mouth closed with an audible clack, his face shuttered as if it had wards of its own. He then slammed the door hard enough to rattle the hinges. It rang with justified finality as a shimmering curtain of magic flowed over the Manor's exterior.
As they grew closer to the counter, the girl attending smiled warmly at them both. Upon closer inspection of her face Draco realized he may already know this girl...
And for your information, I happen to think your hair would look better down than gelled back, that's all.)
(rival, Saviour, wank-fantasy extraordinaire), agreeing to come to the Manor to be fitted for a ball gown. And what was, by all appearances, a date.
"You're on your own!" Harry shouted from the hall. He couldn't get away fast enough. Dear Merlin, he hoped Malfoy still had his trousers on when he returned. (Mostly, anyway.) Maybe he shouldn't come back. With as loopy as Malfoy was, he'd probably just sleep. How much trouble could he get into before the potion wore off?
Draco spread his legs to give Harry more room and gloated, "I have been told I am far too sexy for my own good."
"You think I'm enscorcelled? Why? I'll have you know that your fine arse has been the subject of quite a few shameful dreams of mine, since I was about fourteen."
"The stew sounds good," he decided after a brief contemplation. "Will you be bored watching me eat if I get that and dessert?"
He reluctantly eased off and freed himself from the confines of the skirts, leaving both hands beneath it to knead Potter's muscular thighs. "That was rather the idea," he retorted dryly. "But if you'd rather wait until I'm buried inside you, that can be arranged."
"You," he answered ineloquently, short of breath and dizzy with lust. It didn't seem wise for him to control the action--he could hurt Draco and he didn't want that. He just wanted the man's pretty, vulgar mouth on his prick.
