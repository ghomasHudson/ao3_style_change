“Precisely. These are our Muggle test subjects. We’ve imbued each of them with a tiny sliver of magic, just enough to get the blood flowing, so to speak. Then we test their abilities by putting them in a situation where they might need it—something of severe emotional or physical distress: fights for resources or starvation, for example.
open. Harry had only been able to get there because he lived half a mile away, and it was still a half-mile of biting wind and numb fingers and riding his bike as carefully as he could over all the ice.
“I—it was a stupid question, Draco! Let it go!”  Harry was turning bright red, which was unbelievably attractive for a variety of reasons.
They worked around each other in almost complete silence, save for the ambient sounds of the café’s indie playlist. Harry hated the quiet--he missed Anna's relentless chatter, or Ron's attempts to create new songs over the 'deep, introspective melodies. He missed being able to
“We’ve been testing the effects on wizards, as well. Purely for research purposes, of course. I myself have been able to imbibe wizarding magic, and even do a thing or two with it that I never could before.”
The woman inspected a nail. “I’d be much more worried about yourselves, if I were you. After all, once our main phase of the experiment is complete, you’ll be as expendable as the Mudblood.”
Draco pulled Harry through the door and shut it behind him, then pressed Harry against it. Harry felt him reach behind him and latch the door, and he shivered.
They’d started making up all kinds of ridiculous rules. You had to make yourself fly to touch the wall. You could create illusions to distract your opponent from where the ball was. You could only use your feet to move the ball. Malfoy was a helpless cheater; he kept Summoning the ball and casting Repulsion Charms, and several times he’d nearly tackled Harry in his effort to get to the wall first.
Ariana looked at him for a moment. “Aberforth talked to me about you, too, you know. After you left.”
“Do you want me to make you forget?”  Draco whispered, his wand still pressed into Harry’s neck. “That’s what you want, right? You want to stop loving me?” his voice broke at the end, but he managed to control himself, stop the tears from falling, keep his lip from trembling.
Harry turned around. The confidence was back in Draco’s posture, straight-backed and at ease. He even seemed to be looking
He got to his feet just as Draco attacked, launching himself at the witch. They went down in a flurry of tangled limbs, and Harry felt a sudden burst of wet warmth as her blood splashed across his face.
“They took our magic.” Ron held up the rod. “I don’t know if there’s a way to get it back. I think—it’s gone.”
He found Malfoy in seconds, partly because there were only ten or so people left in the castle, but also because Malfoy was always in the library this time of day. He had been for the entire seventh year, and Harry could never figure out why.
If Harry had known he was going to be snowed in at work, he would have hoped that it would be with Anna, who could make little pictures in the lattes. Or Martha, who always gave him chocolates.
Harry closed his eyes, thinking. Had they left the Vanishing Cabinet—surely not, someone would have moved it after it had been put to its horrible purpose. Then again, who knew what changes had been made under Snape’s regime? Who knew whether McGonagall even knew the full details?
But not long after they’d stepped outside their usual enchantments, something had struck Harry viciously on the back of the head.
Truthfully, Draco had been glad to go to Hogwarts for the spring semester. He hated being in the house when they were like that. It was as though he were intruding on the living dead.
Hermione sighed.  “He hasn’t been—right –since the war. None of us have, but for Harry, it got worse after graduation.” She eyed Draco speculatively. “He’s really lonely, and he won’t
The next thing Harry knew, he and Draco were on the bed, Draco’s mouth still latched onto his neck.  Draco deftly unbuckled Harry’s belt and pulled his pants down, running his fingers over Harry’s shaft in a way that made Harry’s stomach knot and his skin catch fire.
All he knew was that if anyone from the Ministry knew exactly what he had really done, he wouldn’t even be put in a cell. He’d be put down, like a rabid animal.
I hope you're having as much fun as I am! I'm working on the last chapter now (hopefully it will actually be the last one. lol). It's gonna be a great time.
He looked at the owls perched all around him, and thought with a pang of Sirius. It felt like all he did here was walk the paths of old memories. Ghosts followed him at every turn.
Harry smiled in memory, though. The D.A. meetings had been some of the best moments of his life, the ones where he really felt like he was doing something useful, contributing outside the influence of Dumbledore or any of the other adults who sought to run his life.
Harry was about to say something when McGonagall’s voice sounded, magically magnified so that it resonated throughout the castle:
But Harry didn’t have much time to speculate. He could feel the tension building, catching along his spine and spreading outward.
"Anna was my favorite person in the world," Draco said. "And I fell in love with her. And then she met him." He shook his head. "Everyone was so excited when they got together. She'd loved him for so long, and it always seemed like he never even noticed. Except
Harry thought, but the thoughts weren’t his. They were someone else’s, someone who knew him through this bond and beyond it, someone across a gulf of miscommunication and pain and death.
But it wasn’t the grim living arrangements that caught Draco and Hermione’s attention.. It was the prisoners. . They were skinny, some of them emaciated. They glared at them with hooded eyes, but didn’t move. A few didn’t even stir from where they lay in a heap. Draco could hear their heartbeats, alternately rapid and slow, the heartbeats of constant panic and fear, the slow thud fo the dying.
“We need to go,” Hermione approached them, holding hands with Ron. “Once we get to the top, we should be able to Disapparate.”
"Absolutely not. No traffic lights, idiots who don't know how to drive, iced roads that haven't been treated. You're staying here."
There was a groan from the cell opposite him. With an effort, Harry maneuvered himself so that he was sitting cross-legged on the floor. “Ron, talk to me. I need to know that you’re alright.”
“I want to know why you’re doing this. Having me desiccated, dried up, unable to cause any trouble--isn’t that what you’ve always wanted? You and Ginny can fly off into the sunset—”
His commitment to avoiding phones had lasted as long as the end of the first week. Talking to only McGonagall and Trelawney would do that to you. McGonagall spoke only of what he could be doing to prepare for N.E.W.T.s, whereas Trelawney…well, she hadn’t ever stopped making Doomsday prophecies.
"Sometimes.” Harry said softly. And he didn’t know why, what made him say it, but he continued: "My parents died in a car crash when I was two. I never really knew them."
After a few minutes, however, his mind quickly turned to the task at hand. Malfoy was in Hogsmeade, and he’d bet ten thousand Galleons it was to do something Dark or dangerous, or both.
Lucius stood there silently for a moment. Then, as his face began to crumple inward, he shrugged off the Healer’s touch. “Go! Hurry! Save my—save your mother.”” Lucius’ voice broke.
Well, that’s what I was trying to tell you. Since we have a mandatory lockdown, and your mother’s immune system might not be able to handle exposure—”
“I’m shocked, Granger! You stole blood!” Draco wagged the thermos at her. “How could you? Lives could be lost—"
Harry opened his mouth to retort, but Hermione kicked him under the table. Draco smirked. Potter was so
"Can I get you anything else?"  Harry asked desperately. At least if he was standing at the breakfast bar, he’d have something to do with his hands.
He slumped against the wall of the changing room, letting himself break down for just this one moment, this one second. Letting the full weight of all that had passed between himself and Draco press into him, drown him. Tears sprang to his eyes, and a single sob choked out. He dug his fingernails into his palms.
He even would have been happy with the night guy, Travis, who always smelled like Cheetos and called women 'females'.
“We hope your vampire tracking is something they haven’t thought of. If they’re anything like the Death Eaters here, they won’t have taken precautions from people who aren’t—"
She walked over to the wall at the back of the room, which housed an enormous screen, showing video feeds of prisoners, the outside desert and guards patrolling, looking purposeful and deliberate. Dijikistra tapped a few commands into the screen, and the glowing image of a door appeared in the middle of it. She tapped the outline, and the image shimmered and became a doorway. “It’s time for you to see what we’re capable of,” she said, then disappeared inside.
Draco could feel him trembling. But Potter wouldn’t let out a whimper of pain. He wouldn’t even ask for mercy.
If it was the only good thing that Draco could do in his worthless, meandering existence, it was enough.
“No one gets to be the hero in this.” Draco said. “We’re in this together.” He nipped at Harry’s neck, enough to raise a welt on Harry’s skin.
“I don’t believe they’ve taken our magic forever.” Harry said firmly. “There must be some way for us to get it back. And we’re going to figure it out.”
Granger was one of Potter’s best friends. And it was her they’d tortured that night, her that Bellatrix had sliced open, all because she was a Mudblood. Worthless. Expendable.
And Harry Potter opened the door, barefoot, in pajama pants and a tank top, his wand pointed warily at Draco’s face. “What are you doing here?”
a little too loud, and he finally stalked over, snarling that dragons never acted like that and why were people so hard on Jaime Lannister anyway?
Could it be? His wand was laying on the floor, within easy reach. Someone must have dropped it! Steeling himself, Harry reached through the bars, groping desperately.
Draco was getting desperate. He was down to his final blood bag, and he felt constantly weak and exhausted. It didn’t help that he was having to eat normal food so often; which tasted like sawdust.
“Can the two of you stop bickering? I’d like some peace and quiet.” Harry glared down at his pancakes. A part of him looked forward to spending the break alone, but the other part wanted to listen to Ron and Hermione bicker some more.
Harry stopped. The last thing he needed was to antagonize Draco and get fired. Maybe work would be boring, but at least it was warm. He could barely feel the tips of his fingers, and his toes felt like blocks of ice. "Okay."
But the door swung open again, and the cowboy and witch reemerged. The cowboy pointed his wand at Ron’s cell door, which burst open.
Harry exchanged a glance with Draco, and for a moment he wanted to do the same, rush into his arms and hold him there, hold him and never let him go again—
Draco said nothing to that. Potter’s heart was racing, and Draco’s fangs were starting to descend. He looked down for a moment, trying to control himself. “Whatever, Harry.” He said. “You’re always the better person. Happy?”
Draco’s wand leapt out of his hand. Harry leapt forward and caught it, returning it to Draco with a laugh.
“I’m seventeen. What I do is my own business.” Malfoy said. Though his limbs were immobile, he could still speak. “I don’t have to explain anything to you.”
Draco had been having dreams about what he was missing. Sinking his fangs into an unsuspecting victim’s neck, feeling them shudder against him, the warm and salty gush of blood as it entered his mouth.
Draco stepped out of the lift and wandered down the hallway, barely paying attention to the few wizards who greeted him as he passed.
“I’m shocked you know what posthumous means, though since you’re using it incorrectly, it really can’t be helped.” Hermione said nastily.
“Really? So why bother asking me? Why not just clamp me in irons and put me in Azkaban?” He could be so frustrating sometimes, and so beautiful, and Draco was fairly sure that if he kept staring at him with his muscles looking like
The second floor opened onto a hallway that overlooked the floor below, still festooned with a chandelier remarkably similar to the one that had plummeted on top of Hermione on that terrible night—
Hermione hadn’t mentioned Harry, and Draco had been too embarrassed to ask. What if Potter didn’t want to talk to him? What if he was looking over her shoulder, making sure she didn’t say anything?
He didn’t know how many he had killed. Like a coward, he had turned away from the bodies when he was sated, spoken not a word to his parents as they led him back to their mansion, looked away from the casualty lists that adorned the
Draco pasted a smile onto his face (he’d been practicing for months; you’d have to really know him to know that he didn’t mean it). He and Harry shook hands, both of them positively beaming. “Draco.” Potter said coolly, his deep green eyes expressionless, and bottomless.
If Draco wasn’t upset about his own predicament, it might have been satisfying that Potter had finally found a rule he couldn’t worm his way around. “That’s insane! How will we survive that long?”
“I won’t take your blood until you’re begging me, Harry Potter,” Draco growled. “I’m not going to be another monster in the dark for you. If you want me to bite into your neck, to feel me suck and take until you’re half-mad with it, you have to ask. You have to say it.”
“Harry, you saved the Wizarding World. It’s not like they’re going to fail you. Besides, what if this thing lasts long? You don’t want to be here by yourself!” Ron was more earnest than the situation demanded, and Harry knew that he just still felt bad about uninviting him to his family’s.
“Yes, the cards all show it, Harry!’ She shook one at him aggressively. “Famine. Destruction. Death looms ever closer!"
“We don’t know how much longer that communication will be allowed,” Hermione said. “Besides, owls can be intercepted, as you well know.”
"So basically, Anna dumped him, and he never got over it. And it ruined their friendship, and nobody would talk to him, and now, well--seems like he's taking it out on you."
Draco brought his knees to his chest and leaned against the headboard, urging his heart rate to slow down, his breathing to even out. He closed his eyes, concentrating. Calling forth Harry’s voice, that feeling that had laced between them in Vegas, connecting once again when Harry had returned to London a few hours ago.
“No, there’s no need to derail your plans over me. Really.” Harry forced a smile against the heaviness that descended in his chest. “Just write to me, okay?”
But Ron but his head back in his hands, digging his palms into his eyes. “Where’s Hermione when you need her?”
He was only conscious of a sudden stillness, an uncomfortable notion that something was out of place.
"Whatever. Come on." Draco handed him a lighter and gestured to the candles arrayed about the shop. "Light these. Then do me a favor and close the blinds.”
Hermione did not look motivated by this information. “Can’t you feel anything? Do you know if he’s alright? Where are they?”
“Can’t trust you.” Potter hissed, but he’d stopped casting and only circled Draco warily, his wand pointed at his chest.
And Harry said it, his eyes following Draco’s tongue as he licked some of the sweat from his lip. “What if you drank from me?”
“Your mother’s condition results in a genetic disfigurement.” She began. “Vampire blood, while capable of healing great wounds, cannot change a person’s DNA—"
He only came back to full awareness when he heard a member of the catering pound on the door. “Mr. Malfoy,” the man had a quaver in his voice, no doubt wondering what sort of fucking could wring out that much noise. “Your guests are asking for you.”
Draco huffed. His eyelids were getting so heavy, and these beds really were spectacularly soft. “I wouldn’t mind killing you.” He half-mumbled. “It would give me some peace and quiet, at least.”
When Draco arrived at the Slytherin common room, he quickly whispered the password and dashed to his dormitory, flinging himself on his bed and putting his hand over his eyes.
highly recommend listening to crush culture by conan gray during the club scene because I basically listened to it on repeat while I wrote this chapter. also--he went off. .
“Did not destroy the entire room, just the Room of Hidden Things,” Draco rolled his eyes. “Honestly, you think Granger’s the only one with magical knowledge?”
But instead, he just watched as Potter set his jaw and disappeared. He heard Potter’s footsteps as he tramped through the property, then a
Draco arrived two days before, and the connection had become thinner, tenuous. Vague sentiment, caught like the dissipating waves of the ocean as they rolled onto the shore. But it was still there. Draco could call it up when he wanted, just to see if Harry was okay. To see if what had been between them remained.
“I will have a Healer come and test you tomorrow, Mr. Potter. You’ll have to stay a few days to ensure no contamination, of course, but should you test negative--”
Draco’s  features softened. He reached up  and touched Harry’s cheek, running his fingers along his jaw as though remembering its shape. His fingertips caught at Harry’s chin.
He rushed forward, trying not to overhear the whispered exchange between Ron and Hermione, which seemed to oscillate frantically between seduction and concern for his well-being.
But Draco had already disappeared through the door, back down the velvet-lined staircase to the foyer below. He should have known that this party was a mistake, shouldn’t have allowed his father to talk him into it.
Lucius’ lips trembled. He pressed them together. His long white hair, usually thick and shiny, was in straggly strands, pulled back in a bun. The bones stood out sharply on his cheekbones, and his eyes had a sunken-in look to them
“Your mother is much safer with you here.” McGonagall finished in her clipped voice. “We are united on this, Mr. Malfoy. Your father has already informed me that should you arrive at their door, he will simply send you back here.”
"Oh, hell no," said a voice, and Harry looked up to see Draco, sliding a foot experimentally across the ice. He looked over at his car, an old Mustang, which was caked in snow and ice. "Shit." He said. "Shit, shit, shit."
. “I’ve loved you this whole time. Since quarantine. Since before then, the bathroom in Sixth Year. Since that day on the Hogwarts Express. All I’ve ever done is try to stop loving you. I’ve tried to fight it, to fight
“Like anyone would want to go to your home, Malfoy,” Harry muttered. “No one wants to watch your father drink mimosas and impulse-buy expensive art.”
“I thought you were dead.” Draco said, an edge in his voice, the hurt starting to shine through, like blood seeping through a cloth. “That’s what it felt like. You were just—gone. Is that what you wanted?”
Draco stepped out from behind the columns, and he swelled with pride as he noticed the press’s gasps of surprise and approval. He wore a black and rose brocade tuxedo, adorned with a lion and serpent along the lapels. The suit fit him perfectly, and he could tell that more than a few of those gazes held more than admiration as they traced his path across the floor.
“Don’t you? Vampire blood can heal, after all. Perhaps a dose of yours will cure your mother’s condition. Perhaps, were she to die with your blood in her system, she would be able to join you forever—”
Madame Dijikistra, however, seemed unperturbed by her odd behavior. “We’ll start in the lab,” she said smoothly, gesturing toward a hallway to her left, which was festooned with bright orbs of light.  “There are some new trials that look promising.”
“There he is! Back from the dead,” Zabini greeted Draco with a sneer as he stumbled into the room, a glass of cognac already in hand, his shirtfront rumpled. “How was the plague?”
Hermione touched the back of his hand with hers, a gesture they’d gotten into after Ron left, a way of checking in with the other.
"Malfoy?" Blaise laughed. "Ignore him. He's been an ass to everyone since he got dumped by his girlfriend."
"I don't hate you." Draco said again, but he seemed to be struggling with something. Harry could practically feel it, turning the air liquid with tension, so that every flex of Draco's shoulders, every shift in his seat, was in slow motion. Harry had never felt so attuned to someone in his life, and he wondered how much was the vodka and the night, and how much was the same thing he'd felt the first time he'd walked up to Draco, and felt that pit in his stomach that meant his world had shifted.
Not everyone fancies you, Potter.” Draco sneered. “That heroic attitude is a turnoff for some of us.”
Harry’s hand went up to the tiny scars on his neck, the puncture wounds that, luckily had escaped the notice of any of his friends.
Draco wrapped his arms tightly around Harry, the blood hitting him with a sudden wave of ecstasy. He’d been attracted to the guy in the bar, sure but this was
Draco’s face twisted, but his fangs were lengthening, and his mouth was open, panting. “If you want to leave,” he said. “You should do that now.”
Harry reached for the portrait, then pulled his hand away. “The vampire blood won’t really bring them back—he has to know that. There is no cure for death—he’ll fail, or he’ll make it worse. Is that what he’s trying—tell me!”
Harry stared at the dot of Draco in the Slytherin dormitories, wondering if Draco could feel him watching, wishing he was a better Legilimens.
There were so many other things Harry wanted to say, things he wanted to do. He wanted to never leave this moment, to keep Draco
Ron looked as though he were having a hard time grasping recent events. Or that might just be the bruise purpling over his eye. He glanced at the door. “They’re going to set off alarms. He won’t be down for long, and with most of us unable to do magic—”
"Aren't they? You graduated from U of H. Major in English. Rejected from all the major master's programs. You like to read, but you hate doing research. Your parents are divorced, and you have two siblings that you aren't really close to. Your last boyfriend was a guy in your computer science class, and you broke up because you caught him cheating."
At least his father hadn’t told anyone about his condition. The scandal would be far too disastrous.
Neville gulped. “Well, that’s the thing—it’s—spreading to the wizarding community. Several members of Puddlemere United have fallen ill after visiting a local pub.
“It’s not that they think it’s your fault, or they blame you.” She said. “It’s just that grief can be irrational.”
would come on too strong. And he wasn't sure exactly what was happening between the two of them, only that the cafe seemed a lot hotter, and Draco's eyes were wide and glistening, and there was a little tracery of veins along his neck that Harry could see even now, and he had a sudden urge to run his lips along them, to feel where the blood pulsed---
“Malfoy,” Harry muttered, trying to ignore the tightness in his pants, to convince himself it was nothing more than the mood of the club. “What the hell?”
Harry took advantage of his distraction. His mind hazy, dizzy with blood loss and lust, he rolled them over and fumbled at Draco’s belt to pull his pants down. Harry licked a long stripe from Draco’s collarbone to his navel, then ran his lips down to Draco’s balls, sucking them into his mouth, pinning Draco to the bed with one hand while the other boy writhed above him.
“Are you sure you want to do this?” Harry had asked Draco the night before, Draco’s head pillowed against his arm. “We don’t have to tell anyone. I don’t mind if you’re not ready.”
Draco glared at them as he sat as far across the table as possible. He grabbed a piece of chicken and tore into it viciously. It was bad enough that he had to fake eating dinner; worse that he was doing it in front of Potter and McGonagall. The least he could do was make sure they didn’t notice how much he was eating; people usually tried to politely ignore bad table manners.
“No. The letter indicated that she had been ill for some time, and it has worsened.” Her eyes blinked at him behind the spectacles. “Is there something I should know, Mr. Malfoy?”
But even though severing the bond had stopped the forays into Draco’s awareness, even though the niggling consciousness at the edge of his own disappeared, even though he could no longer recall flashes of awareness from a London flat, the smell of the Ministry at dawn, the contempt that oozed off of Draco’s coworkers, even though that was all gone—
And that’s when Draco lost it. “Of course I am! Because Merlin forbid I do anything worthwhile with my life. Merlin forbid I do anything decent. I saved your life. I saved your
They played in silence for a while, but it was clear that Draco was better at the game than Harry. Finally, when Draco took his inevitable checkmate, Harry said. "Do you want to ask me anything?"
He pulled out the map of Vegas that Hermione had foisted upon him as soon as he agreed to the endeavor. “Do you have
. It was absolutely infuriating—he didn’t care about these diseases. He probably thought only wizards descended from Muggles were susceptible; it was exactly the kind of pureblood thinking that he was known for.
He simply reached around Harry, the wool of his sweater brushing against Harry's chest, and withdrew the chess set. He smelled like a combination of mint and coffee beans, and Harry felt something inside him tighten at his closeness.
“Of course, of course.” The cowboy tipped his hat, but there was a slight edge to his voice when he said, “First we’ll meet up with my associate. This way.”
“I call them livestock,” Dijikistra said. “I need a certain type of course—witches and wizards who come into full realization and control of their powers are best—the magic increases with awareness.”
“Are you going to stop him, or are you going to help him?” Ariana asked. “Because Draco doesn’t need the Chosen One, Harry Potter. He just needs someone to hold his hand and tell him it’s going to be okay. Someone who has faced the unimaginable, and survived.”
The corner of McGonagall’s mouth twitched. “I see. Well, as Potter has a particular talent for eavesdropping—
“I would have thought you, of all people, would know the importance of prophecies, would know their value. But very well, Potter, very well. Do as you normally would.” She lowered her head, and Harry thought her shoulders shook with a sob.
They sat in silence again, but Harry could swear that there was less animosity between them than there had been. In the past, it felt like Draco spent every moment in a room with him wishing that he could walk out of it.
“You and I both haven’t had any contact with Muggles.”       “Get the fuck away from me, Potter!” Malfoy’s wand was out now, leveled at Harry’s chest. He didn’t even know why he was reacting this way. In the past, he would have been delighted to find out Potter had contracted a deadly virus, and honored to have passed it to him.
“Let’s talk about what we’re gonna do when we get there.” He said, trying to distract himself from his thoughts, which kept turning with unerring tendency toward that night, when Potter had faced him across a marble floor, his voice thick with pain.
He arrived before Harry, his hands delicately behind his back so as to hide their shaking. “You ready for this?” Draco whispered
“It’s the safest way to travel long distance,” Hermione said patiently. “No wizard would expect us to use Muggle transportation.”
He hadn’t even looked disappointed when, after Hermione had heard that Ron was going off with his family, she’d tentatively stated that she wanted a holiday away with her parents as well. “We always wanted to go to Italy as a family,” she’d said, “We’ve never been. Now seems like a good time, since—”
When would he stop feeling the cost of this war? When would he stop seeing all the lives he had interrupted, all the families he had torn apart?
“Abraxas.” Hermione snapped, glaring at him coldly. “And we aren’t concerned with pleasantries, Mr. Bolton. Show us your research. I have a degree in Healing, and I’m not easily impressed.”
Dijikstra smiled like Bellatrix had smiled, moments after she’d found out Draco was a vampire. “That is what they
Draco took one step away from the door. He arched an eyebrow, struggling to maintain his bravado. “Why? Afraid I would unduly influence Auror investigations?”
Harry had tuned her out, thinking of taking a fly around the Quidditch pitch later, when she suddenly slammed something on the table in front of him. He jumped, then rolled his eyes.
“He felt bad about it, you know.” Ariana spoke, startling Harry out of his reverie. She still had that quizzical half-smile on her face, and her wide, pale eyes contained a certain depth to them, the feeling that a very old person looked out of that child’s face. “Talked to me for quite some time about it, how he needed to go but hated that he was proving you right. How it was probably what he deserved, to be locked in here with you.”
Draco looked up. Harry was watching him, but with none of the hostility of before. His brow was furrowed, and his fingers were tapping a staccato rhythm on his thigh. “Can you--hypnotize people?”
“He also told me that they need gold. They’re in desperate need of an investor. One who quietly supports their cause from afar. One who is so well-known that he’ll be let in without question. One with large sums of money and no conscience.  I’ve already sent an owl to make the necessary introductions, and an initial payment just to get them interested.”
Harry heard whispering in an odd language, and a chill went up his spine. Something dangerous lurked on the other side of that door, he was sure of it.
So they ended up moving the television to the middle of the room, where Harry conjured a couch. Draco pulled over a few blankets from his side (adorned in Slytherin colors, of course) and they took up their opposite ends with a businesslike attitude, barely speaking except when Draco asked questions; he was behind, and he refused to catch up on his own.
Draco and Harry wake up the next morning to dire news from Professor McGonagall. Introspection and desperation ensue. They talk to a portrait. It's real sad.
“Come on, Granger. This is me. You’ve never hesitated to show me how much of a better witch you are.”
Voldemort to stop the battle to let him find Draco, no matter what it cost, no matter the Dark Lord’s plan. .
As the silence stretched between them, the days lengthening, Draco had clung to that connection, the only proof of what had passed between them, that it hadn’t been a dream or his own wishful thinking. A connection that would never be severed.
The animosity between them had been absolute from the first day, when Harry had arrived for his first real shift at the café. He’d found Draco rifling through the breakfast bar, meticulously lining up the napkins and arranging the straws.
“Of course not.” Hermione said. “The magic goes into the nearest neutral object, typically the tool used to siphon it in the first place. That same tool will also transfer the wizard’s magic back, given the right spell.” She raised her wand and took the rod from Ron. Then, she started muttering a chant to herself, drawing it out until it resembled a song.
“They need money a lot more than they’re letting on,” Draco said to Hermione out of the corner of his mouth, keeping his eyes locked on the couple ahead of them.
In spite of Harry and Draco’s resistance, the lines between them were becoming increasingly blurred. It seemed like it took a lot more effort to stay apart than to be together.  Draco was studying a Switching Spell for N.E.W.T.s, and he needed someone to practice on  (at first, Harry had been supremely resistant to this; letting Draco curse him went against everything he had learned since the age of eleven), and Harry had wanted to practice levitation…
“Oh, you’ll have patience for this one. I believe you are acquainted.” Dijikstra smiled serenely, and Draco felt Hermione tense beside him. ‘
Draco shook the feelings away. He couldn’t feel this way about Potter anymore. He was his enemy, his adversary.
“Ron?” Harry’s mouth felt dry. He groped around the floor until he found one of the bottles of water they’d been leaving at his cell for the last few days. He took a few swallows, then said, a little louder, “Ron? Are you alright?”
The moment was an iridescent bubble, magical and exhilarating. It was the snow, turning the mundane into the sudden magic. Harry could feel Draco's heart hammering against his own, and it seemed to echo the way he felt again that pit in his stomach, and the world shifting beneath his feet.
He had felt it every time he’d looked at Draco, since Draco had drank his blood during quarantine.  He’d felt it when he’d refused Draco at the party, when Draco had pressed him against the wall at his mother’s funeral. Every day that Draco had sneered at him at the Ministry. Every moment since he’d been aware of it, that feeling had been there.
After all, it would be antithetical for Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter to have anything in common, even accidentally.
Even now, Harry approached her with a certain wariness. He didn’t know what she would say to him, if her portrait truly interacted with others the way other magical paintings did. After all, Ariana had been sickly, damaged by the assault she’d undergone as a child. Perhaps the only person she spoke to was Aberforth…
He swung his feet over his bed with a curse, hunting around for his shoes and socks. If Malfoy was gone, Harry knew exactly where he was.
“Whatever you want.” Draco leaned against the wall, all of his energy suddenly gone. “Just do it, Harry. I don’t care anymore.”
“Yes,” Draco looked away so that Potter wouldn’t know the whole truth. He could get blood from any human with a heartbeat, true. That had been well established.
It was almost like being in quarantine again, except now he didn’t have to sneak out to clubs, and he could take whatever unsuspecting victim he wanted home. He could try to use them to fill the void Potter had left, and if they had to take a Blood Replenishing Potion after, so be it.
“Shh.” Draco sat across from her and started adjusting his shirt. “I didn’t hook up with him; I just had to get him alone. Turns out he’s a wizard.”
Draco had gone to the fountain at the back of the property, overgrown and ill-kept since his mother’s death. Lucius had only bothered to maintain the greenery around the walking trails, and all manner of birds and other creatures flitted in and out of the fountain. Beetles crawled on the ground; it looked like the fish within had begun to reproduce, and there was moss staining the edges of the white marble.
“It still sounds like you wanted me gone,” There was an undercurrent of hurt Draco’s in his voice, and the kettle was now a dull roar. “So I’ll do you a favor.”
During the sex scenes, Harry studiously studied the carpet, willing himself to think of anything but Draco in one of Petyr Baelish’s brothels…
“Nice to meet you,” Draco said, trying not to reveal how much her iron grip was crushing his fingers, or the wave of energy he’d felt emanate from her. It was like standing too close to a furnace. His nose wrinkled—how was the woman emanating magic?
Draco knew what he’d been asking. Harry had wanted him to go all in. He’d wanted more than back-corridor hookups and late nights.
"Look, Potter if you die, then it'll be my fault, and I really can't stand the guilt, okay? What the hell am I supposed to say to your poor mother? I annoyed you enough that you risked death from exposure to get away from me?"
Draco didn’t need more than that. Harry tried to reach for him, to hold onto him, but he was too fast. “Stop!” Harry shouted helplessly, as Draco raced toward the house.
. Before he could change the channel, he heard Draco laugh softly along with the track. He turned halfway around in his chair.
It was only when they broke apart so that Harry could pull Draco to the bedroom that he understood what Harry had been saying, like emerging for air after a long time spent underwater.
A tall wizard with silver streaks in his hair met them at the entrance. He was dressed in a pewter gray suit, paired incongruously with cowboy boots and hat, and he had a piece of grass stuck between his teeth. “Evenin’” he said as they approached, offering his hand for Draco and Hermione to shake. “Name’s Heath Bolton.”
Harry climbed the stairs, his feet pounding on the rungs, feeling the music pulse through his body, along with the rising surge of his hatred.
Harry awoke with a start, fighting off the grip of nightmares. It was still dark; nearly 2am, and dawn was a long way from arriving over the horizon.
It was all such a fucking joke. His parents needn’t worry. No disease, magical or otherwise, would ever affect him again.
First, Draco had come down to the Great Hall to find that the House tables had been replaced by a single table in the middle.
At the funeral, Draco sat in the front row, his back straight, his blonde hair stark against his dark robes. And whenever Harry tried to talk to him, he turned to talk to someone else.
Draco was sipping from the hot chocolate, his badass combat boots propped on a table. Harry left the show on, bewildered. He didn't think he'd ever heard Draco laugh.
Draco hated how his voice sounded, how lost and vulnerable. “You can’t tell anyone about this. Ever.”
“I would rather neither of you waste my time with dishonesty.  I have known the two of you far too long to not know a duel when I see one. My office.
“You have already been exposed. That means you continue to be contagious, particularly if you develop symptoms. Mr. Longbottom has removed the traces from your skin, but your cough, your saliva, will all contain traces of the virus for the next few days.”
In quarantine, it was easier to hide it. He’d just reply to Hermione’s text messages, post an occasional photo of a squirrel outside his window on the SnapChat she’d made him get. Exercise. Keep to a routine.
Draco was silent for a moment, his head whirling. Was that what had been going on this entire time? Had he loved Harry Potter from the beginning, from that first day on the Hogwarts Express?
Draco's eyes flashed, but he was silent as Harry went on. " I love my adopted parents, but—no matter how much someone loves you, sometimes they just die on you.  Or they leave. Everyone leaves, one way or another. So what's the point of getting close to anybody? What's the use in all that hurt?" Harry stopped himself from going on, trying to blink away the tears. What was wrong with him? He
When he reached the bottom, he was greeted by a floating tray of champagne. Draco plucked a glass and sipped it, his taste buds alert for any hint of drugs.
He started pacing around the cafe, trolling for distractions. He wished he'd brought his switch or a book at least--the magazines were, after all, the kind of material that you should never read seriously.
“Time to go, Malfoy.” Harry grabbed his arm, but the other boy was incredibly strong. It was like trying to move stone.
“Apologies,” Dijikstra said, withdrawing her hand. “But you must see that your funding will cause us to make progress. Undeniable, world-altering progress!”
“That’s what I’m saying!” Harry protested, his voice at a normal volume now. “Voldemort’s dead, we’re all back at Hogwarts, and he’s still on. The same.
Draco had certainly had dreams like this, where Potter was laid out beneath him, and he’d sunk his fangs in and tasted his blood as it pulsed down his throat, dreams that always happened just before he woke, to the real Potter watching him with that curious expression, like Draco was an Arithmancy problem that needed solving.
“Just came to see if you were alive,” Draco said, interlacing his fingers. “And you are accounted for, so—” he got to his feet and carefully put the stool back into its proper place, then started toward the door. “Have a good night,” he tossed over this shoulder as he entered the foyer.
him lifting weights with the rest of the Slytherin Quidditch team, his muscles gleaming in the Sun..
Harry shook his head. “I promised him this. He has a thing for grand gestures.” Inside, though, Harry was agreeing with Hermione. What if this was all a ruse? What if Draco was doing all of this just to humiliate him?
and he could already feel a bruise forming on his knee. Maybe it would be smart to stay in until the roads thawed out. There were sure to be dozens of accidents in weather like this.
After a moment, his heart rate started to return to normal. He remembered—Draco had been trying to leave, and Harry had been trying to stop him.
Harry frowned. Malfoy usually would have taken care to hide such obvious marks of his passing. Did he
“We took both of their magics.” Bolton said. “Potter and the blood traitor’s, Weaselby or something.”
“Are you alright, Harry?” Hermione’s voice came sharply over the divide, and she emerged a moment later, causing Ron to whirl in panic. “Hermione,” he said, half-amused, half-exasperated. “This is the
Draco squinted, but he could see nothing. Someone was invisible, lurking in the shadows. Someone who didn’t have a problem moving without being seen.
Harry bit his lip. Who was she to lecture him like a child, after what he’d done? He could probably walk into the Auror office now and be handed a job, why did he even bother—
She shook herself.  “You must be talking about Mr. Malfoy. Draco is on the upper level. Should I let him know you’re coming?”
The woman smiled, and Harry saw for the first time that she had slit-pupiled eyes, and a curious pattern to her skin. Her dress, which he’d thought to be make of a shimmering material resembling snakeskin, seemed to be reforming and unfurling before their very eyes, the hues changing subtly through every whirl of fabric.
But Hermione was unfazed. “Honestly, don’t you lot read? She took the rod, holding the gem up to the light so that it sparkled.. “A magical siphon is not a revolutionary concept. Dark wizards have been attempting it for centuries—there are even rumors that Niccolo Machiavellli used it to siphon power from wizards who threatened him.”
“Let’s worry about our dinner plans later.” Madame Dijikstra smiled at them in a way that made Draco’s skin crawl. “This is where we house our most promising specimens. I think you’ll be very pleased with our results.”
In this part of Texas, snow was a fairytale: far-fetched and fantastic. Everyone spoke about the snow in hushed tones, as though speaking about it too much would scare the winter miracle away. People told stories about how the air smelled different, of were children on toboggans, the whole world was at a standstill.
"Or they pretend to hate each other for half the book, then fall in love at the end." Harry said, thinking of
a spell erase nearly a decade of duels, insults thrown in the hallways, fights, spells and breakneck attacks?
Draco certainly kept himself busy for an hour or so after that, reliving the experience. Imagining what would have happened if he’d waited a little while to drink, if Potter had laid
Draco shook his head, willing his fangs back into his mouth. He stood. “If you all will excuse me,” He said. Good night, Professor, Harry.”
Draco wondered what his father would think if he saw him now. Lucius Malfoy didn’t come to the Ministry very often these days—everyone who had sucked up to him had been thoroughly relieved of their position under Shacklebolt’s regime.
scar carved into her skin, one which no amount of potions and elixirs had ever managed to remove entirely. “Maybe it’s time to put all this aside.”
But how could his family be in danger? What could Draco be doing to help them? Even if they didn’t have the virus, Draco should know that his best option would be to stay away—
“It’s a huge castle, Potter,” Draco spoke around the fangs descending in his mouth, not daring to do more than a half turn-around. “It shouldn’t be hard for you to stay away from me, unless you’re still obsessed with me, that is.”
about Ginny in months? That all of his dreams were filled with a single person, slender, with blonde hair and icy blue-grey eyes.
hungry. Potter’s heart was beating fast, pumping that delicious blood through his veins. His cheeks were flushed with it.
Draco wanted to drink from him longer, he wanted this to last. He wanted to remember this moment for the rest of his life, because love could always bring destruction. And who knew how long either of them would make it in a world fraught with Death Eaters and Dark wizards and politicians, bloodsucking, power hungry monsters who wanted to bleed them dry? Who knew if they would have anything more than this night?
“Professor, if I might have a word?” Malfoy looked curiously flushed, his eyes bright in the light. “I have a request to make of you.”
His father didn’t leave her side, didn’t say a word to Draco. Just kept her thin hand between his own, watching her every breath and movement like he was afraid they were her last.
Draco’s turned up his nose. “I don’t have patience for blood traitors and half-bloods,” he sneered, tapping the back of Hermione’s hand with his wand as he did so, silently signaling to her not to make a move, not yet. She was practically vibrating with rage, and it was hard to keep the duo’s focus on him.
Suddenly, Harry heard a crash, as though a door had slammed. It came from the right side of the alleyway, where it branched into another. Harry crept forward, kicking himself for not grabbing the Invisibility Cloak.
Harry didn’t know how long they did that. Coaxed each other through orgasm after orgasm like taking drugs, hit after hit.
Hermione’s disapproving expression looked curious on the waiter’s face, but it still had the same power. “Are you ready, or do you need to look in the mirror one more time?”
Harry sat back against the wall, his mind whirring through possibility after possibility, discarding them one after the other. He’d never planned to be in a situation where magic itself was unavailable to him, where he’d have a magical instrument but no power to channel through it.
When he'd opened the door and found the cafe dark and Draco sitting with his arms crossed at one of the tables, his heart sank.
Draco sighed. The color in his cheeks had turned a darker pinkish red since the vodka, and he looked tired and soft all of a sudden, as though the alcohol and the rush of the game had worn his hard places away.
But it seemed to be just expensive, sweet champagne. He took another glass and handed it to Hermione as she descended, stiff-legged and awkward in the waiter’s enormous feet.
Maybe they were too damaged to be close to anyone else, to feel close to someone ever again, but at least they understood each other.
“Potter wouldn’t know a moral grey area if it hit him in the face.” Draco said. “Stopping me is the right thing to do. Always.”
thanks again to @tearinmyarc for helping edit, especially since I keep writing on Benadryl, which makes me sleep-write nonsense.
But Ariana had already turned and begun walking down the tunnel behind her portrait. The passageway opened, and it was clear she was done talking to him.
“Well, as you can see,” Draco gulped down the rest of his Firewhiskey, relishing the tingling sensation that spread to his limbs. He spread his arms, sending the glass to the floor, where it shattered. “I’m grand.”
“GET OUT.” Draco screamed. “LEAVE US ALONE. YOU DID THIS. YOU—I’LL KILL YOU! I’LL KILL YOU, HARRY POTTER.”
He tried to scream, but the charm held him fast. Tried to warn Ron, to cry, to beg, but he couldn’t move.
The photos were taken, and Draco retreated back down the steps. Now that the main portion of the evening was done, he could politely retire for the evening.
seem like Malfoy’s scene.  He leaned in close to the waitress, until he saw her eyes catch on the scar across his forehead. Her mouth fell open into a perfect ‘O.’ “I’m looking for someone. Blonde hair, snooty expression? Slytherin?”
"But the panini press is better." Draco flashed him a quick grin, and Harry had to grip onto the table from the force of it.
“We ought to prepare for the worst. Gather the teachers here, and you may stay as Head Boy. Potter and Malfoy, you are dismissed, and not a word to anyone.”
When the sandwiches were ready, Draco grabbed them both some waters, and they sat down on the same velvet couch Harry had occupied earlier, side by side. Draco crossed his legs, his knee barely brushing the edge of Harry's thigh.
Draco checked his watch. The sun was already starting to turn the room gray, light filtering through the window next to Potter’s bed.  Potter would be coming around any moment now…
“We’ll come with you.” Blaise stretched languidly.  “I’ve never been one for school-sanctioned events anyway.”
“I can’t be infected.” Draco said. “My blood, my cells—the virus affects humans. And I am not a human being anymore.”
“She’s--I’m sure she’s coming.” Harry said. “Just takes a while to get backup, going to London and all.”
He’d landed his Thestral just next to Malfoy’s. The pair had already huddled together in the trees, happy to be with a member of their herd
seemed anxious at first, but that could have been anything. He probably just hated being in Harry’s presence. Harry was pretty sure that they were allergic to each other. Having Malfoy’s eyes on him too much always made him itch. Even looking at his dot on the Marauder’s Map did it—like the hatred was yawning across their entire magical distance. He was so
"Wait--" Harry frowned at a Lord of the Rings chess set, whose box seemed to be jutting out from the wall-- "No way.'
Harry looked down the table to a group of Ravenclaw and Gryffindor first-years. They were typing away frantically on their phones, looking anxious. One of them coughed, and the others all jumped, looking around nervously.
This stupid school, Potter and his friends. No one ever cared what he felt. No one gave him the benefit of the doubt.
Draco whirled, letting his vampire attributes sharpen his features, turn his smirk into a snarl. Letting himself look as cold and threatening as possible.
But perhaps it would be prudent to find another drink first. Draco went back into the foyer, preparing to re-enter the ballroom and make a beeline for the bar. His vampire liver seemed to have an abominable alcohol tolerance—three cognacs in, and he was barely buzzed.
But Draco had Harry in his teeth now; he could tell by the way his green eyes flashed, the way his hands were clenched into fists. Draco couldn’t let go. “She couldn’t forgive you, could she? For dumping her after Dumbledore died, leaving her in the dark for an entire year? You decided to be noble and cut her loose, but you didn’t think about how she’d feel. You imploded, and didn’t consider that she’d be hit with the shrapnel—”
Harry felt a surge of hatred. Maybe he should just leave Malfoy to his fate. Maybe contracting a “Muggle disease” would be a fitting and ironic way for him to die.
So I THOUGHT that I would only be writing one more chapter, but then I was like, 'I gotta talk about Draco on a plane, and 'I gotta make fun of Las Vegas,' so here we are! Featuring a few original characters, Draco and Hermione hate-bonding (the best kind of friendship), and a magical necklace that links Hermione and Ron through the power of love, because they're the only straights that matter.
Harry burst through the door, his wand raised, ready to cast a stinging hex, a Repulsion Charm, anything to prevent Draco from making the biggest mistake of his life—
Harry knew it was about Fred’s death, reconciling with Percy, trying to heal from all of the wounds that were still fresh after Voldemort’s defeat, even though it had been nearly a year. But it still stung when Ron had awkwardly said he wasn’t invited—the Weasleys had always considered Harry family before, what was so different now?
Malfoy had never cared much about his studies before; he’d always been either smart enough or well-connected enough to get good marks regardless. So why was he spending hours in the library every day, reading?
Draco downed his cognac in a few quick swallows, relishing the burn it brought to his eyes and throat. He hadn’t seen Potter yet this evening; he’d heard the clamor, of course, when he had entered, but he’d snuck up a side corridor into the upstairs wing of the grand country house, towards the sound of Parkinson’s mocking laughter and Zabini’s smooth drawl.
The woman herself looked to be in her thirties, with an austere and fierce expression. She shook Draco’s hand firmly and looked into his eyes. “Madame Dijikstra,” she said. “Though you may call me Diane, if that suits you.”
And Harry, who couldn't wait one more second, twisted his fists up in Draco's sweater and pulled him down, so that Draco's mouth slanted across his.
Okay, so I actually am sure that there's 13 chapters now. Well, 12 chapters and an epilogue, because I've drafted everything. Yay!
Harry hoped that Ron would be able to throw off the Imperius Curse, like Harry had been helping him to do. Hoped that he’d have the good sense to run, to get help before these wizards hurt anybody else.
Hermione ran a hand through her hair. “And I don’t want to call on the other Aurors for backup, since—”
Draco rolled over, propping his head up with one hand. That effort alone exhausted him; he’d become so weak. The thought of Harry offering, of finally wanting what Draco himself had dared to want, was making him even more light-headed.
His muscles burned, and his chest ached. He still felt weak and exhausted, and even though his wand was in his hand, there was no magic to be had.
“Oh, right.” Harry moved the piece back. He moved a castle forward, and Draco immediately took it with one of his pawns.
Never mind that his mother was pale and sickly, red splotches standing out along her skin. Her Healers never left her room with anything but somber expressions, and his father—
Draco sat up. “Exactly. You’re thorny; you cut open anything you touch, anyone you love. You’re just a weakness.”
But this time, Lucius didn’t take no for an answer. A rustle of velvet and silk hit Draco full in the face, casting a shroud of black over his vision. “It’s not a request.”
Harry had to get right in front of them before they noticed him, and it was Malfoy who noticed him first, his bright blue eyes widening.
“I have some studying to catch up on,” Harry said, which made Hermione pull a skeptical face. “Really! I’m so behind!”
me—if you want this all to—stop, I understand. But I—I’m going to fucking love you until the end of my immortal existence. When this city crumbles to dust, I will love you from the ashes. But I understand if I’m not what you want, and I’ll go away—”
“Looks like we’re cancelling our trips, then.” Ron glanced at Harry. “Do you want to come home with me?”
“You won’t.” Said Harry through gritted teeth. “You can’t.” He reached with his left hand and grabbed his wand. “
more. Because I love you, Harry Potter. I think I’ve been in love with you since that very first day on the Hogwarts Express, and I tried so hard to run from it, because I knew it was going to be over for me. I knew the moment I kissed you for the first time, touched you—there is never going to be anyone else,
“It’s probably not that big of a deal,” Ron said. “The Muggles will find a solution eventually. It won’t affect
Terrified that, since he’d stepped outside of quarantine and flown here himself, he was endangering more people than he would save.
“RON.” Hermione shouted, reaching for him, the spell suddenly broken. Ron wrenched the rod out of the cowboy’s hands, but the cowboy swatted him across the face. Ron dropped it, and it rolled across the floor. Both men dove for it, and the cowboy snatched it up, but Ron elbowed him in the face and grappled with him for the rod.
‘His mother was dying,” Madame Malkin clucked sympathetically as she started to measure Ron’s arms and legs. “He wanted to be there for her.”
It gets sappy and sweet here, and I'm not sorry at all for it. Thank you again to @tearinmyarc for editing ALL of this, even though we both thought it was gonna be like a quarter of the length it turned out to be.
“Certainly,” Dijikstra said.  “Once we get the rest of the world to cooperate. Imagine what people will pay to steal magic from the ‘Chosen One.’ I know quite a few Death Eaters who are desperate to have their revenge. The process is even more painful than the Cruciatus Curse.”
With none of the usual haunts open, Harry had no idea what Malfoy would do in Hogsmeade. Of course, he could have simply used it as a stopping-off point for Apparition, which meant he could be anywhere by now…
So Harry hadn’t protested when Ron had explained the Weasleys’ plans. He hadn’t pushed Ginny when she’d said she needed time, time to be by herself and work through the trauma she’d experience fighting the Death Eaters at Hogwarts.
“Look.” Draco turned to him. “I’m going. You can either get out of my way, or I can make you.” His fangs slid down over his lips.
But in these moments, watching Harry pace, talk to Hermione, glance surreptitiously at the photographers and fireplaces that ringed the Atrium, run a hand through his hair so that it got ruffled again…
“My brother had a fascination with mastering Death.” She said. “As did your old master. Do I need to tell you how it ended for them? The only true master of Death lies unconscious behind you, a master because he chose not to cheat Death. Because he accepted it with open arms, and did not try to go against nature--”
He skidded around a corner and raced down the hallway, bent down low to keep the Invisibility Cloak from flapping around his ankles.
Harry’s wand was rolling across the floor, no doubt where it had been kicked during the struggle. He picked it up and turned it over and over in his fingers, thinking.
He stopped. The lights were back on, but something had changed. The witch was floating above him, and her dress had changed. Instead of fabric that twisted, furling and unfurling in different panels and sheens, the dress had become a collection of serpents, writhing and reforming, collecting so that they slithered across the floor.
Next, McGonagall and Potter were sitting across from each other, talking like two old friends. He wondered if McGonagall would tell Potter about his mother. It would be just like her, thinking it might instill Potter’s sympathy.
"Right." Harry looked up the number and dialed. He listened to the automated voice on the phone. "Just says they're aware of outages." he said. "But it's not looking good."
Lucius was a heartbeat behind him, both of them too full of adrenaline and hope, tragedy and despair, to think of casting a spell.
Draco straightened his tie and shot a smug look over at Hermione. They both wore silk, three-piece suits. While Hermione had opted for the simpler, black option (they’d had to guess at the waiter’s measurements, and she’d already been about to murder Draco for how long he’d been spending in the shop), Draco was bedecked in a brilliant blue and gray floral suit that set off his coloring perfectly and made his eyes nearly glow in the setting sun.
“Did she get torn apart by a wild animal? It would have been better to take her alive.” the American president asked.
Lucius shook his head. “You have no idea what you’re talking about. The Healer assured me that you were vulnerable—" Lucius began to pace back and forth along the gate, twisting his hands in his hair, “Why would you come—”
“Figuring out a place for us to sleep,” Draco said. “Unless you plan to wash in the water fountain.”
“A nice little cocktail. Veritaserum, mixed in with some other stuff. He’ll have a terrible headache tomorrow, and he won’t remember a thing.” Draco smiled widely. “It’s a concoction of my own creation.”
Harry kept busying himself with the dishes. He set out two of his mugs, then reached into the cabinet for tea bags, depositing them carefully in the cups.
Perhaps one day, when they finally got married, they’d be so enamored with each other that they wouldn’t stop to wonder about him at all…
Harry tried desperately to hear something, anything, coming from further inside the facility. The sound of footsteps, the beep of electronic security monitors, the slide of a door being opened,
But Aberforth never really said much. Whenever Harry asked him, he simply grunted about needing to tend to an old goat farm, or he told Harry to go somewhere else if he wanted to be a therapist.
“Like leave me the fuck alone.” Draco laid back on the bed and flung his hand over his eyes. “You’re so
"Potter," Draco looked up at him, and there was something far too raw in his eyes. It was almost as though he was afraid.  "Always the sunny optimism with you. Doesn’t it get exhausting?”
Harry had thought it was difficult being around Malfoy while school was in session, but it was doubly difficult now. There was no way to avoid him, no steady stream of other students to dull the painful brilliance of his hair, or to dissipate his sneers and mocking remarks.
But—he stopped for a moment as he clasped the silver and emerald brooch, fashioned in the shape of a serpent, that was supposed to fasten the clasp of his traveling cloak.
Harry grasped Draco’s wrist. Draco’s eyes darkened, and Harry saw fangs start to peek out over his lower lip.
Harry shut the door and walked across the foyer to the kitchen, waving his wand at one of the kitchen barstools so that it slid out.  Harry put fresh water in the kettle and placed it back on the stove, then pointed his wand at it, listening to ensure that it had begun to heat. He heard Draco sit behind the bar, shuffling his chair so that it squeaked on the hardwood floor.
Harry’s next question was spoken soft and quickly, as though he was afraid of the answer. “Do you want—
“I was hungry—and you helped me out.” He said. “We fucked, Potter. Do you want a fucking greeting card?”
He still liked to come to the Owlery, even though he found himself looking for Hedwig without realizing it. He hadn’t gotten a new owl; to do so at this point seemed like an insult, when Hedwig had died defending him. She had been his only friend at the Dursleys.
“Unless you can give me a reason why you, out of anyone else, can neither carry nor imbibe a virus, you will not be able to see them.”
Back in London, he waited, nursing that connection like a sputtering flame. He used a Muggle cell phone to keep in communication with Granger, who apparently seemed keen on the idea of them becoming running mates. Before he’d fallen asleep, she’d texted him that they’d just arrived back in London, that they were all heading in to get some rest.
Of course Potter would be impervious to compulsion. He’d already proven himself able to throw off the Imperius Curse with hardly any training, because he was just
Draco looked down. "I uh--lived here for a while. Right after I graduated. I was living with Anna, but--"
Harry shrugged. Malfoy was an opportunistic weasel, and always had been. McGonagall was mad if she didn’t know that.
“Look.” Draco dropped his wand, letting it roll on the floor over to the corner. “I’m unarmed. I’m not trying to attack you.”
McGonagall seemed to have guessed the nature of Harry’s thoughts, because she gave a deep sigh before continuing. “You could do a great deal more good if you worked together. The war is over, and we are on the same side. Are we not, Mr. Malfoy?”
And then she was gone, disappearing back up the staircase. Draco heard the stomp of boots on stone, then silence.
After a couple weeks, Harry finally got the courage to ask one of the other managers, Blaise, about it.
Hermione opened her mouth to say something, but he was already disappearing inside the restaurant. He passed tourists posing in front of a cardboard cutout of the Eiffel Tower, a gift shop where tourists could buy little miniature towers for their home. “Ridiculous,” Draco scoffed, checking the price tag. “Everything about this town is fake.”
“Thanks.” Harry stepped into the passage, barely paying attention to the path in front of him. Why had she said those things? What did she mean? Did she really think he felt
They met eyes for a second, and Draco thought suddenly of the fantasy which had emerged so suddenly in his head—his fangs in Harry’s neck, the sweet blood running down, the way Potter would
It wasn’t until Malfoy actually started walking along the seventh floor corridor that Harry realized it.
Harry glared at the glass, disgusted. He couldn’t be here. He couldn’t be seen here. These were exactly the kind fo selfish, sycophantic people who had cozied up to him the minute Voldemort’s body started to rot.  He couldn’t pretend to be one of them, nor could he pretend that so many of them had willfully ignored the call to fight when the Battle of Hogwarts began.
A jet of green light flew out of his wand, blasting a hole in the Earth just beyond where Harry knelt.
,” Draco said, making sure his voice carried so that Harry, Ron and Hermione could hear it all the way across the Great Hall, “For the students who have to stay here over spring break because they’re not
“Mr. Malfoy, your parents have sent you a message. Your mother has fallen ill and requests you come home at once.”
Hermione opened her mouth to ask something else, but Draco held up a hand. “This is all very alluring, but I’ve seen no proof. For all I know, you’re some crackpot with a journal and too much time on your hands. Have you successfully tested this—
But sometimes he wondered what might have gone differently that day on the Hogwarts Express, if Ron hadn’t sat in his compartment. What might have changed, had he taken Draco’s hand? Would he still have so many people to burden? Would he have been better off with the Dursleys, who’d never have done a thing for him?
With Potter, and his necessity to always be there, trying to ruin everything he wanted. Always proving to be the better wizard, the better man. Looking over his shoulder, asking questions, those infuriating green eyes and that shock of black hair that never seemed to lay flat, liked he’d just gotten off the Quidditch pitch….
Take-off had been a nightmare. When the plane had started to race down the runway, Draco had been horrified to see the nonchalant, even bored expressions of the Muggles around him. Only the children seemed to be paying attention; several of them gave ‘whoops’ of excitement and gasps of delight as the plane finally took to the air.
Honestly, all the righteousness made Draco want to vomit. It made him want to corner Harry and just—kiss the living daylights out of him.
“How did Malfoy react?” Hermione asked suddenly. “Learning that wizards are susceptible to a Muggle disease must be the Ninth Circle of Hell for him and his family.”
Harry wondered if he would die like this, if Draco had planned this, a way to finally kill the famous Harry Potter.  “Draco—” he whispered, trying to tell him that he was passing out, but he couldn’t say anything more. The world was turning fuzzy at the edges, and Draco was still drinking and drinking like he would never stop.
Harry pushed his hands into his eyes until bursts of color appeared behind them. Draco had nearly killed Katie Bell, nearly poisoned Ron to death. And he’d set that trap for Dumbledore, at the top of the tallest tower, all because Voldemort would have killed his family otherwise…
The hairs on the back of his neck stood up, but he kept his expression placid. Hermione knelt to kiss the woman’s hand, “Abraxas,” she murmured, holding her hand just a little bit too long. “Delighted.”
He hadn’t been able to fall asleep; the newfound nourishment was coursing through his veins, giving him a burst of energy.
Harry swallowed and swarmed up Draco’s body. He felt feverish, pressing hot kisses to Draco’s lips, licking his fangs to see if he could taste the vampire venom.
"It's the only two player game here besides poker and Go Fish." Harry said. "And I hate Go Fish, and I don't understand Poker."
"Besides, that wasn't what I called you over for." He reached behind the chess set and pulled out a glass bottle, about half full.
Draco kept snarling, his fangs gleaming, blood staining his chin. “Get away from me, Harry,” The closer Harry got, the more Draco shook. The more broken he sounded. “Get awaay. I don’t
Hermione tapped her fingers on the table. “They’re obviously going to have some defenses. Maybe if we did something like when we snuck into the Ministry—”
recipient. There will be no more Squibs, no more Muggleborns. Magic only to those who deserve it, and for a price, of course.”
But what if it didn’t matter that they loved each other? What if Draco’s grand gesture was too little, too late?
The dark-haired figure to the left of Percy Weasley was barely recognizable. A shade of stubble shadowed his jaw, and he seemed to have spent a lot of time exercising outdoors, if the thick muscles that slid beneath his white robes and his tan were of any indication.
“Don’t see why he would be.” Ron said. “Not like he cares if he finishes anyway. Didn’t he run off home in the middle of quarantine?”
Harry raised his hand to his lip. Felt the tiny puncture Draco had made through his lower lip. It was already starting to swell.
“Better than nothing!” Harry held his arms out. “So is it just a matter of time? Am I going to wake up with your fangs in my throat?” He blushed.
McGonagall had accused Harry of being too suspicious of Malfoy; everyone had. And look where it had led them.
"No." Draco looked up from his phone, and his eyes met Harry's. "Sorry," He said. "It's just--my phone is about to die, which is kind of like an EKG and ventilator rolled into one for me, so I'm a little--"
“What are you doing in the Room of Requirement?” Potter looked a little embarrassed at being caught, but his self-righteousness won out, like always.
Harry closed out of the article without reading further. It was more of the same; he wondered why Hermione bothered to even send them to him.
“Did you honestly expect Draco Malfoy to show up to his own press conference on time?” Hermione looked thoroughly unperturbed as she examined the sparkling engagement ring on her finger. “I don’t see why you have to make an announcement anyway. It’s none of their business.”
“Deal.” Harry pushed past her and began to shove his way through the crowd, which finally thinned out as he approached the staircase. He held onto the railing as he climbed the steps, looking around to make sure no one was watching him.
“Do you want to—” Harry asked, not sure what he was asking, but he didn’t have time to figure it out. Draco had already crushed his lips to his.
?” Harry sounded genuinely hurt now, but Draco knew he would have to do more to drive the knife in deeper.
A surge of hope went through him like lightning, and he leapt forward, tackling the cowboy to the ground. The cowboy’s wand clattered out of his reach. Harry grabbed his hair and slammed his head against the floor, but the cowboy dug his fingers into Harry’s eyes, and Harry released him, reeling.
"It's not like we have to play a game." Draco frowned. "We'll just have to clean all this up later."
Blaise was standing at the entrance, with red and blue lights flashing behind him. "We're evacuating y'all in case the pipes burst." He said. "Warming centers are gonna be the only places with power. But by all means,” he smirked. “Snuggle up."
“There are Caterwauling and anti-Apparition Charms around Hogwarts and the whole of the surrounding communities.” McGonagall said. “You will not leave this castle undetected.”
“Narcissist.” Draco murmured softly, just to see the color deepen. “Not everyone is in love with you.”
Harry was still shouting; he couldn’t help himself, and the kettle shrieked, sure to wake the neighbors, but he only shouted all the louder. “I’m afraid—I am--going to love you for the rest of my life.”
“How did your lot win the war of American Independence?” Draco asked the waiter, who was stunningly attractive, with bright blonde hair and tattoos.  “How did we lose to
Draco held up a hand, thinking. He had to get the exact order of the words right. Longbottom had done it first—so it must have had security measures against Snape, the Carrows, and other students.
Worse, it had intensified, like the sun’s rays at dawn, climbing across the Earth until they painted it golden.
McGonagall arrived the next day in person, having cast a Bubble Head charm around herself as a precaution.
"Okay, but can you press pause on the gooey shit? You're making the first responders uncomfortable.”
Eventually, Draco’s sobs had subsided, and he was leaning into Harry’s touch, staring vacantly into space, when the Healer had walked in. She said someone about making arrangements, decisions to be made, events to plan, and Harry had been ushered out of the room.
He left the office before Percy could utter another word. He’d probably suggest that Draco send one of those infernal memos, but Draco preferred to be out of the office, away from Weasley’s accusing gaze.
"I made hot chocolate. Do you want some?" Harry held up a mug, already topped with whipped cream and peppermint shavings.
"Well, it's the whole Lost Generation, isn't it? The general air of disillusionment with the American--'
Draco was suddenly standing before his father, his face feral, his lips pulled back to reveal his fangs—“say his name.”
He looked up for a moment, and his eyes met Harry’s. All the grief in them seemed to vanish, replaced by a simmering rage. His pupils widened, and his eyes turned black. His fangs descended so quickly, they pierced his bottom lip, and it was with a mouthful of blood that he spat at Harry:
“Get on your dress robes,” Lucius had appeared at his bedroom door in a shimmer of silk and velvet, his sleek hair brushed and bound back in a ribbon, his silver-topped cane setting off his aura of elegance. “We’re going to your graduation party.”
Harry looked at him for a long moment, then lowered his wand. He sat on the bed and crossed his arms. “So?”
Harry was saved from his downward spiral by Draco, who suddenly arrived, looking breathless and excited.
No matter what Harry did, no matter how many times he came in early or stayed late, offered to give Draco extra breaks, cleaned without being asked, the tension was still as palpable as ever.
“Please, Professor.” Draco felt a tear escape and trickle down his cheek. “It might be my last chance to see them.
“Why? Is she tired of having a coward for a son?” Harry rose to his feet, clenching his fists at his sides. “Does she want to trade you for a son who doesn’t run away at the first sign of a fight?”
Ariana was watching him as though she detected the turmoil going on inside. “Don’t make the mistakes my brother did, Harry. Don’t push someone you love into darkness.”
Draco tentatively stepped toward one, thinking it mere illusion, but the snake hissed and struck. Only his vampire reflexes saved him from being bitten, and he could feel the
But Harry was still looking at him with that obnoxious expression on his face. Merlin, couldn’t Potter ever just leave it
Neville muttered a charm, tracing it over Malfoy’s body. “He’s certainly been exposed.” Neville said. “But—I don’t think he’s actually contracted—”
Harry didn’t know anything about vampire venom. He hadn’t bothered to learn; he had basically slept through Defense Against the Dark Arts this year. It wasn’t like anyone was going to fail the person who’d killed the Dark Lord.
The woman pulled her hand away, running the other over it, as though to rub away Hermione’s lips. “I was so excited to get your owl,” she said. “Heath and I have made such progress, and I would hate for our research to be shut down at such a crucial juncture.” She took a step back, surveying them both through narrowed eyes. May I say,” she added. “The two of you look stunning.”
"But I only live a half mile away.” Harry hauled his bike up and tried to roll it, then nearly fell as he slid on the ice again. “I can walk--"
