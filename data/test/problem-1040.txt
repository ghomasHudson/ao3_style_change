"Harry?" Draco asks once Harry has kicked his shoes off.
"Yeah, love." Draco leans up, presses a kiss to Harry's jaw, and Harry shifts so he can kiss Draco properly.
"No."
"There is no me and Draco." Harry says, quiet and broken.
"Love you too 'Mione." Harry turns around to say, walking backwards so he can wink at her cheekily, and before he turns back around he sees her roll her eyes at him.
"I dunno, since like fourth year." He says and Draco blushes again. Harrys cocky smirk reappears and Draco knows he's fucked.
"He told me to make sure you're okay." Harry whispers and Ron frowns.
"Okay, who want's a butterbeer?" Harry asks and Hermione rolls her eyes but smiles at him and Draco feels his heart swell because he had no idea Harry would actually look out for him like this. Hermione and Draco nod before they all walk into the three broomsticks.
"Yeah."
"It seems when your parents knew Voldemort was after them they saved something for you, or, should I say, multiple things."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Was that intentionally Morse code?" He whispers, and Harry nods, he didn't think Draco would know Morse code but God is he glad he does. He wants to leave. He's been in the hall for nearly half an hour and he's starting to want to go into hiding again.
"So how are you?"
"Cool, good luck telling Weasley." He says just as Professor Slughorn calls the class' attention.
"In all honesty I sat with him the first time intending on thanking him for speaking on mine and my mother's behalf. And to apologise for the part I played in making his life harder than it needed to be. But I didn't know what to say or if he'd want to listen, so I helped him with potions instead. I kept trying though, but every time it would just end in silent studying and now it's just a habit." Malfoy says and Hermione nods.
"Yeah?"
"That was nice of them." He mutters and Blaise smirks.
"Come on, Harry." Seamus says once they've packed up their bags, and the two walk side by side towards the great hall.
"W-what book?" He asks, worrying his bottom lip. He doesn't think Harry would have found out he saw his sketchbook, but that means he must know Draco gave him Pride and Prejudice. He didn't think Harry would ever find out who gave him that book. Maybe he was just hoping Harry wouldn't figure it out so he didn't have to deal with his reaction.
"Finally!" He all but jumps onto the bed and pulls Harry into a hug, grabbing Draco's arm and forcing him to join in, causing them to end up lying in a heap. "Merlin I've been waiting for this day for years!" Blaise pulls back a little so he can grin at Harry and Draco before he gets off them. Harry and Draco sit up, hands still connected, and shift so they're both sat leaning against Draco's headboard, and Blaise sits down on Draco's bed opposite them.
"Harry." Teddy says in his adorable baby voice and Harry smiles slightly as Teddies hand wraps around his finger.
Harry decides as he drags himself out of bed that he's not even going to pretend to eat anymore. He doesn't care enough to keep up the illusion anymore. He's too exhausted to do anything and honestly what's the worst that could happen. He goes to the library and sits in the back corner. He wants to give Draco's book back to him, and thank him for it, but he's not sure how he can go about doing that. Harry sighs and rests his head in his arms on the desk. He's so damn tired, but he doesn't dare fall asleep where he is, knowing that he'll almost definitely wake up crying or screaming and he really doesn't want that to happen in a library. He hears someone sit down opposite him and someone else sits to his left, and only knows who it is because he can smell Draco. They sit in silence for a few minutes before the person opposite speaks.
Harry's walking back from quidditch practice when he sees Hermione and Malfoy talking across the courtyard. At first he thought Malfoy was being a dick to Hermione as usual, but then he realises Draco is relaxed against the wall and Hermione is actually smiling at him. It almost looks like Malfoy is flirting with her. Hermione starts to walk away but when Malfoy calls "thanks Granger" after her she turns and smiles at him. She actually gives Malfoy a legit smile. And he gives her a smile back. Granted it's not as genuine as the ones he gives Harry at night but it still awakens the green eyed monster in Harrys gut.
"It is nothing personal, Mister Malfoy, I just need Mister Potter to try and get as much rest as he can today. He had a visitor earlier and it did not do him any good." Madam Pomfrey explains and Draco frowns but nods.
"You do! I am flattered!" He chuckles and Draco glares at him, shifting backwards.
"You've been off the past few days, Harry." Draco whispers and Harry nods, his hair tickling Draco's neck.
"I'm gonna go to the library, gotta get some DADA work done and write a letter to Andromeda." He says, figuring they want some alone time anyway. He stands up and grabs his bag, flinging it over his shoulder and crouching down.
Harry glances over when he hears the hospital wing door open and sighs when he sees Hermione, turning his head to look away from her. Billy fell asleep 20 minutes ago and Harry is so bored which is not a good thing, but he really doesn't want to talk to any of his so called 'friends.' He hears Hermione getting closer and contemplates pretending he's asleep, but he's too tired to pretend.
"Well the only person I didn't want to see them has seen them so it doesn't matter." Harry explains and Ron nods in understanding.
Harry is holding Draco's hand like his life depends on it. They're sat in a carriage on the Hogwarts express, Harry next to the window, Draco right next to him, and Blaise and Pansy opposite. They've been on the train for an hour, and all of them can see that Harry is not okay about going home. He's leaning his head on Draco's shoulder, listening to Pansy and Blaise talk about some party Blaise’s  parents are throwing over the Christmas holiday that they are both obligated to attend. Draco and his mother are invited too, and Draco is trying his hardest to get out it.
The room doesn't fall silent like Harry was expecting, but the people nearest the door turn to see who had entered, and they stare in shock when they see Draco Malfoy hand in hand with Harry Potter. Harry immediately regrets coming, but he knows he can't leave now, and he knows he's here for Draco, because Draco asked him to come with him. He squeezes his hand and stands up straight, and tries to be polite when Mrs Zabini walks over to greet Narcissa and Draco.
"Hey." He greets with a smile.
"They're nice slytherins." Harry mutters and everyone chuckles.
"Apparently not." Harry finally tears his gaze away from his friend and Teddy and notices Malfoy. He pauses for a second before looking over at Hermione. She nods subtly and he smiles slightly.
"Minerva spoke to you about therapy?" Harry nods.
"Are you okay?" He asks and Draco nods.
"I know."
"Oh, er, he said he was sorry, and I said I forgave him." He says before whispering "Hermione can we go for a walk? I need to talk to you alone?" Hermione nods and Harry takes Teddy off of Ginny before they leave the hall and head outside.
"Not even a little bit, but we've got until dinner so..." Draco says and Harry rolls his eyes.
"So how and when did you figure out there's a secret passageway in the castle?" Draco asks as Harry leads him down the narrow tunnel.
"Granger. Do you know where Potter is?" He asks, trying to suppress a smile when Teddy walks over and wraps his arms around him.
Harry manages to finish his potions essay after an hour and takes a deep breath, running his hands through his hair, before standing up and grabbing the book. He know's Blaise is still in the library because from where Harry is he would have seen and heard him leave, so he figures he should give him the book so he can use it. Harry walks round a corner to where he knows Blaise usually sits and freezes slightly when he sees Blaise is sat with Malfoy. They both look up when they hear Harry's steps and Blaise smiles slightly.
"Really?" He asks, loving the sound of that.
"I will ensure that whatever players you select for the team will be respectful of you, lest they lose their place on the team." McGonagall says and Harry nods.
Harry spends most of the lesson staring at Malfoy or feeling Malfoy stare at him, and by the time the lesson ends Harry realises he took barely any notes. He's going to need to ask Hermione for hers so he can do the essay. They walk out of the dungeons and Harry turns to Hermione.
"Come and eat, Harry sir, and then you must go to bed." Harry nods before pulling himself off the sofa, following Kreacher into the kitchen and sitting down. Kreacher fills his plate with pie and mash, covering it in gravy the way Harry likes, and then he sets the plate down. Harry really isn't in the mood to eat, but he knows he needs to, and it does look delicious, so he forces himself to take a bite.
Their walk lasts for an hour in total. Most of it in silence but they keep their little fingers linked the whole time. When they reach the castle Harry unlinks their fingers and bids Draco a good night before making his way to the Gryffindor common room. Harry is dreading going back to his dorm, but since it's only 8pm when he enters the room it's empty. Harry figures no one will bother him if he's asleep so he decides to go straight to bed.
"Well I was. But I was going to have to go no matter what. At least now I will have Harry there to make it slightly more bearable." Narcissa smiles.
They sit by the lake, leaning against a big tree trunk and chat casually as Teddy runs around chasing birds Hermione has conjured and giggling. After a while Harry gets kind of sick of the fact that people keep purposely walking near the trio and staring at Harry and he swears it's happening more than usual. He voices his concern to Ron and Hermione expecting them to say he's imagining it and that he's probably too tired and stressed, however Hermione just laughs.
"It was Blaise's idea. I told him it would be stupid, but then they said it would be a big 'fuck you' to everyone and that it would be funny."
There are around 20 Gryffindors on the pitch waiting, and Harry silently thanks McGonagall for being so specific about who she allowed to tryout.
"Come on, he'll get over it eventually. He's just mad that we used to fuck about. He probably thinks we still do." George says and Harry sighs.
"If you're gonna have a shower that hot you should open the window." Malfoy says, quieter, and Harry turns to look at him, noticing the way Malfoys eyes scan his exposed body.
"Harry?" Harry looks up at Draco before looking back down. They're sat on Harry's bed in the Gryffindor common room because Harry needed a break after herbology and had homework to do and insisted that Draco come with him. Harry's leaning back against the headboard, and Draco is sat against one of posts holding up the bed curtains at the foot of the bed. They're both facing each other; Draco watching Harry write.
"You wouldn't have. You're not a bad person. You're a good person that bad things happened to." Draco says, quoting one of the memories that they watched the other day of Sirius and Harry at Christmas.
"But people expect me to be okay. They still think I'm some sort of saviour."
"People can't just leave me the fuck alone can they?" He asks, making Hermione chuckle.
"Harry!" Hermione calls and Harry sighs. People have started leaving the hall now and those around are looking at him and Hermione. Harry stops walking, halfway up the stairs, and turns to look at Hermione. He pulls the bottom of his top up so he can wipe his face with it whilst he's waiting and when Hermione gets to him she frowns.
"Phase two. Nice or nah?" He asks and Draco looks thoughtful for a second and Harry decides he needs to do something quick or the second years will be gone, so he grabs Draco by the collar and presses him against the wall.
"What?"
"Harry- That's... They- But- They'd lock you in a cupboard?!" Draco asks in shock and Harry nods with a slight shrug.
"You didn't answer my question, Draco." Harry says and Draco shrugs, threading his fingers through Harry's hair again.
Hope you like this chapter, I've decided I'm going to continue writing this fic, but when I post chapter 50 I'll ask if you think I should continue or if you want me to end it <3
"Consider it done." He says before walking over to his friends, and Harry walks over to Hermione and Ron.
"Bad day. I er, I don't really wanna talk about it." He whispers and Draco nods, accepting that Harry wont say anything. Instead he just squeezes Harry's hand and presses their foreheads together as both of their eyes drift shut.
"Have you spoken to her?"
"I'll see you later, mate." Harry squeezes Ron's forearm gently in a way he's hoping says thank you. Ron nods to show he understands before leaving the room, knowing Harry is going to be looked after.
"Hey Harry, you're very welcome. Oh, just so you know, there's a pool going about your tattoo." She says as he picks Teddy up and smiles the smile that he reserves for Teddy, and Malfoy, but he doesn't know Hermione knows that.
The Slytherins disappear along with the crowd of students watching and as Harry is about to turn and walk back to his dorm room he feels a hand grab his forearm and drag him towards the bridge. He looks at Ron and frowns.
"Well he can't be in the castle. We've searched every floor 3 times. He must be somewhere else." She says before sighing, silently cursing the fact that they don't have the map. They know Harry still has it, but they don't even know if he brought it back to Hogwarts with him.
"Just- go slow." He says and Harry kisses his nose.
"Harry come on." Hermione says and Harrys about to open his mouth and talk but Hermione gives him a look that shuts his mouth immediately and he sighs. He gives her a look and she smiles slightly and gives him another look and Draco comes to the conclusion that they're having a silent conversation so he just watches the interaction in fascination, wishing he knew a look that would shut Harry up. Hermione gives Harry another look and he rolls his eyes before sitting up and pulling on a shirt and his converse.
"I shouldn't say, Mister Zabini." Madam Pomfrey says and Blaise frowns.
“I was worried about you.” Harry mutters before burying his face in Dracos hair.
Harry silently and wandlessly casts the colloportus charm to lock the door before his lips meet Dracos and his fingers thread into his hair. Dracos breath gets caught in his throat and he runs his hands over Harrys chest and Harry grins, deepening the kiss.
"I thought Weasley was okay now?" He frowns and Harry shrugs.
"Draco only has 2 blushes. When someone mentions how in love with Harry he is or when he has to talk about him and Harry. And since Harry is right here I guessed someones talking about them fucking." Pansy says and Harry looks at Pansy, intrigued.
"You're not getting out of this." Blaise says, smiling slightly. Harry sighs but rolls his eyes and holds out his hand, silently accio'ing his broom, which flies right into his hand within around 15 seconds.
"Harry doesn't like the fact that you're mad at him. I don't like the fact that he's not happy."
"How come you're up here?"
Harry wakes up at 6am and sighs, sitting up in bed and running his hand through his hair. He lets out a big yawn and stretches before climbing out of bed and pulling on some joggers and a thin hoodie along with his converse, deciding to go for a run to keep his mind at bay.
"Harry?" Draco whispers.
It's 12am the next day when Harry finally finishes reading the books and thinks he has an understanding of how the stone works. He takes a deep breath and runs his hands through his hair before standing up and picking up the books. He puts them all back on their respective shelves before leaving the library. He walks down the stairs to the entrance-way, intending on going to the forest, but runs into Rhys and Will from his team.
"It's dinner time." He says, and Harry finally opens his eyes, locking them with Draco's, giving him a pleading look.
He will have to maintain this 'friendship' for as long as he can until Draco comes to his senses and tells him to fuck off. The day Draco has that realisation will break Harry; he's just hoping it's no day soon. See, the thing Harry has come to realise, is that he belongs to Draco, in ways he doesn't think anyone, himself included, will be able to understand. He's physically unable to live without him, not that he'd want to live without Draco anyway. He just knows he's going to have to at some point. The other thing Harry is starting to realise, however, is that the more time he spends with Draco, the more he falls in love with him. He's had a thing for Draco ever since first year; at first he thought it was hatred, then in sixth year he'd convinced himself he was only so obsessed with Draco because he needed to figure out what he was doing. He knew deep down in fifth year that he had the realisation that he thought Draco was attractive, and he was able to admire him from afar, not thinking anything would ever happen because he still hated Draco and he was certain the feeling was reciprocated.
"Harry?"
”Lovely.” Pansy says and Draco blushes.
"When you use magic without a wand or actually saying anything. Not many experienced older wizards can do that. It reminds me how powerful you are." Draco murmurs into Harry's chest and Harry smirks, casting a charm to cover them with a blanket.
"So the poll ends at dinner today because young Harry here is finally gonna put you all out of your misery. We stop taking guesses at 5." Seamus calls and a few people get up and walk over, ready to make their guess. Harry rolls his eyes and walks out of the hall with Ron and Hermione.
Anyway we're back to our regular scheduled programming :) I hope you are all enjoying this and I hope you like the new chapter :) <3
"That's nothing, Potter. Don't worry about it." He says as he takes the bag off of the woman at the til with a smile and a thank you.
"Brilliant!"
"Absolutely not." Draco snaps.
"What the fuck is that noise?" Dean asks and Ron looks over at Harrys bed to see his broom shuffling out from under his bed.
"Maybe I should get a shirt with your face on it so people understand to leave you the fuck alone." Harry says and Draco chuckles.
"You know what I meant, Harry." Draco says softly.
"Hey boys, it's Friday!" Hermione smirks and Ron raises an eyebrow.
"And Draco loves Harry."
"And you never eat much anyway?"
"Of course I did, he's gonna be the youngest quidditch player in a, well, since me." Harry says smugly and Draco rolls his eyes.
"And they get on way more than I ever though Gryffindors and Slytherins could."
Sorry I took so long! I like to have a big backlog of chapters ready to go so if I get writers block I don't need to make you wait that long, but I've only got 3 written currently and I have major writers block so I was putting off posting but I'm hoping my brain starts working again soon! Fingers crossed!
"You better." He says before squeezing Harry's hand again. "Try and get some sleep." He says, voice soft, and Harry nods despite knowing he wont.
”It’s hard work.”
"Okay, congrats on making the team everyone. First we're gonna warm up so just, you know, fly laps." Harry says and he and the team mount their brooms and start flying laps. Practice lasts an hour and a half, and ends when Harry notices the Slytherin team waiting to use the pitch for their practice. He lands and calls his team over, praising them for a great first practice, then walks over to Blaise and hands him the key to the chest, trying not to look disappointed when he realises that Malfoy isn't on the team.
"You need to stop doing that." Blaise says the second he enters the wing and Harry shrugs, not moving his gaze from the ceiling.
"You are a person Harry. You bleed and you cry and you feel. And you were made to do things no one should have to do, and you had expectations of you that no one should have of them. But the war is over, and you're alive. And- I'm glad you are." And Draco doesn't know what else to say but Harry then holds him tighter and rests his head on Dracos shoulder and maybe he doesn't need to say anything else.
"How long was I asleep?"
"Yeah." Harry grins. Ron holds out a hand and Harry grabs it, letting him pull him up, and the second he's standing he's pulled into a hug by Ginny, shortly followed by the rest of the team.
"Okay, why is Draco blushing what have you done? Who mentioned him and Harry fucking?" She asks and Seamus raises an eyebrow.
"Yeah, why has he done something?" Ron asks and Harry sighs, this wont go well.
"I love you, you know." Harry says when Draco hasn't responded and Draco smiles slightly.
"Draco please." Harry says, straddling Draco so he's forced to look at him.
"Alright!" Seamus and Dean call from Harrys right as they stand up, and every conversation stops at once.
"You don't smell like fire whisky anymore." Draco mutters against Harrys neck and Harry shivers, his neck is one of his sensitive spots.
"Hippogriff feather." Harry murmurs and Draco doesn't even know if the fat lady heard him but she opens anyway. The common room isn't full but it's not empty either, there's around 12 kids sat around working or chatting, and when Draco enters the common room they all watch him carefully, until they realise he's supporting Harry, when they promptly mind their own business.
"Yeah, damn I'm gonna have to listen to bloody Jason complain about me being late again." Harry mutters as he shoves on his quidditch boots before standing up and looking at Draco. "You coming?" Draco nods, getting off the bed and accepting Harry's hand before Harry leads them out of the dorm and towards the quidditch pitch. Ron doesn't mention how natural it was for them to hold hands.
“Sometimes you don't notice it's happening until it's over." Draco says and Harry frowns slightly.
"Not literally. But you get the gist."
"I think if he sees how happy you and Draco make each other he wont be able to stay mad for long." Now that Draco has heard that George isn't trying to fuck Harry he feels a lot better about everything so he smiles slightly and walks round the corner so Harry will see him as he walks into the castle but so it doesn't look like he was snooping. As he's walking away, however, he hears Harry tell George he misses him and Draco wonders if he misses seeing him or misses fucking him and now he's confused again.
"I see ye with Malfoy las' night. Ye getting along?" Hagrid asks as he hands Harry a mug of tea.
"I was going to, and then I couldn't find you. And then shit hit the fan."
"Well I almost killed you too."
"He knows about the book." Draco says and Blaise raises an eyebrow.
"You regretting it?" Hermione asks quietly and Harry shakes his head.
"He could have spent the night with someone?" She says hesitantly and everyone stops to look at her.
"I do have a question though." Hermione adds and he looks very nervous but stays quiet indicating Hermione can continue.
"You know, I don't have my broom." Harry mutters as they walk to the quidditch pitch, and Blaise rolls his eyes.
"Not all of us are top of every class, Potter." Harry rolls his eyes.
"Because one, it's Malfoy, and two, he has literally no interest in me and doesn't feel the same so what is the point? Also, three, he's Malfoy." He says and she sighs.
"Why did you stay with them?" Draco asks after a while, voice barely above a whisper. It's been about an hour since they read Harry's diary. Draco's head is resting on Harry's shoulder, Harry's is resting on top of Draco's and he has his eyes shut.
"You're here!" Draco calls, and Harry looks away from Narcissa to see Draco walking over to them and Harry is fairly certain his brain has short circuited because
"Damn right." He grins before turning to his textbook.
"I used to love watching you play too, Draco, don't worry." He says and Draco blushes deeper and Harry remembers yet again how great it is to make Draco blush.
"Everything." Harry whispers, eyes watering, and Draco curls their legs tighter together.
"I'll see them every weekend." Harry says and Seamus pauses for a second before bursting out laughing, which makes Harry start laughing.
"Good run?" She asks and Harry shrugs, taking a sip of his drink.
"Wouldn't you like to know." Harry winks at him and Seamus pouts, not being able to press Harry more because Professor McGonagall has started the class.
"I can't move in, love." Harry says softly, smiling at the suggestion because that kind of sounds great, "Besides, I'm spending the 23rd and Christmas Eve with Andromeda and Teddy."
"Okay, Everyone wanting to be keeper raise your hand." Harry says and 4 people raise their hands.
"Oh, and Potter?" She says before he leaves the room.
"I don't know. I'm never fully okay. But sometimes I'm more okay than other times." Harry says, cringing at how bad he is at communication. Talking to Draco is harder than he thought.
"You keep an eye on me?" He asks and Harry nods.
"I'm okay. I'll be fine." Harry just desperately wants to go for a run and forget about everything that's going on or has happened.
"Trust me." He whispers, walking backwards and slowly leading Draco by the hands up the stairs to the bedroom Harry sleeps in, their clothes long forgotten in a heap on the front room floor.
"Draco, will you be my boyfriend?" He asks, figuring he might as well not fuck about and just make it clear what his intentions are. No wonder Draco's confused, they snog for an hour and haven't spoken about it since. Draco's eyes widen slightly before his expression changes from one of shock to happiness.
"Hey, mate." Ron says. Harry looks at him and forces a smile as a way of hello.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Now come on. I need to sleep." Harry says, pulling Draco towards his bed.
"Dunno really. I was always close to Fred and George, and when Fred died George and I got closer. We were both kind of depressed and it was just easier to talk to him because he didn't try and cheer me up, he just let me be sad. Like you do." Harry says and Draco nods, smiling slightly to hide the fact that he knows there's more to it.
"What are they?" Draco asks softly, standing next to Harry and looking at him.
"George? As in Weasley? As in there's no need to be jealous?" Draco asks, actually hurt that Harry could say it so casually.
"Look who woke up." Blaise jokes as Harry yawns.
"He's watching over Ron at the moment." His mum says and Harry nods. He would go and let Ron see Fred but he knows Fred doesn't want that and Ron doesn't need that. It wouldn't end well.
"Well no, but then you gave Blaise your essay for us to use." Draco finally meets Harry's gaze, biting his lip.
"You alright?" Draco asks from his bed.
"McGonagall wanted to talk to us."
"Draco, I meant every word." He says easily and Draco admires his courage.
"Mother." Draco says to get her attention and she jumps slightly as she looks up before smiling.
"I will, promise."
"Yeah, sorry." Harry says, voice thick with exhaustion.
"Are you okay?" He asks, trying to sound as concerned as possible.
"You gonna stop staring at me?" Harry asks quietly with a smirk on his face and Draco doesn't know if he wants to punch him or kiss him. There's a slight pause before Draco is able to speak.
Also also... Just wanted to say thank you for sticking with me through all my bullshit <3 even my irl friends have abandoned me so thank you and I love you <3
I'm joking <3
"You alright?" Ron sounds hesitant and Harry wonders what's going on.
Harry walks straight to his usual table in the back corner of the library, and when he reaches the table he almost hesitates when he sees Malfoy, Parkinson and Zabini sat at the table close to his. He considers going back to the common room, but he doesn't want to deal with his friends, so he just sits down and pulls out his sketch book. He starts to sketch his view out the window, but gives up half way through. He can tell Malfoy and his friends keep looking over at him, whether it's because they used to hate each other or because he has a dark love bite on his neck that is very visible despite his dark skin Harry isn't sure. He glances over at Malfoy to see him writing, his hair is loose and the way the sun is shining on his face makes him look so beautiful that Harry can't not draw him. He sketches Malfoy with the focused look on his face as he writes, and when Malfoy finishes his essay and is talking to his friends and Parkinson says something that makes Malfoy smile a slightly reserved smile Harry can't help but to draw him again. He takes subtle glances until he's finished the sketch, and just as he finishes adding the final touches he hears Hermione and Ron approaching. Harry quickly closes his sketchbook and shoves it in his bag before pulling out a random textbook, opening it just as Hermione and Ron reach his table.
"Come on, lets go find the others."
"Mister Zabini would you be so kind as to give us a moment?" Pomfrey asks and Blaise nods, standing up and leaving the hospital wing.
"What's wrong?" Draco murmurs against his skin, "And don't say nothing, because you're an appalling liar."
”You’re welcome.”
"Harry we love you so much. Please look after yourself, love." Lily whispers and Harry nods.
"Why the sigh?" Ron asks and Harry shrugs.
Harry feels rough. He's been eating, because Kreacher makes him eat, but he hasn't slept in the few days he's been home. He received a letter from Draco the day they returned home asking if he wanted to visit or if Harry wanted Draco to come see him, mentioning the fact that he told his mother and she wants to properly meet Harry. Harry replied saying he didn't want to impose, but he does want to see Draco and if his mother wants to see Harry then he will. She saved his life, after all. Draco's reply didn't take long, saying Harry won't be imposing and that both him and his mother really want him to visit the manor, so Harry accepted.
"Just glad I could help." Draco whispers and a piece of hair falls into his eyes and Harry brushes it out of the way, loving how soft his hair is.
"Then leave me alone!" Harry snaps back.
"Why would he go to the snakes?" Ron asks and Seamus frowns.
When Draco gets back to his dorm he finds Harry sitting up in his bed, guitar in his arms. He's still wearing the joggers he was wearing earlier but he seems to have found one of the few muggle clothing items that Draco owns, a black hoodie, and is now wearing that too. He looks up when Draco enters and smiles almost sheepishly.
"You're not bad, you know." She says quietly, and Harry smiles slightly. No one's seen anything he's drawn before, mainly because he only really draws Draco.
"Can it wait until tomorrow? Please? I'm really tired." He says and she nods so Harry picks up Teddy and leaves the hall.
"I know." Draco mumbles and Harry smiles.
"I know, Potter. Now what can I do for you?" She asks and he shrugs.
It's a few days later and Harry hasn't spoken about what made him so upset and stressed the other day. Harry's kept to himself, and he goes on a run during dinner, after which Harry meets Draco, Blaise, and Pansy outside the hall and the four of them make their way to the Slytherin common room. Draco and Blaise sit on the sofa near the fire, Pansy sits in the armchair next to the sofa, and Harry sits on the floor, leaning back against the front of Pansy’s chair. Draco and Blaise are talking about something or another, Harry is half paying attention as he watches Draco, a glint in his eye that Pansy can’t help but smile about because he looks so entranced, she has no way of knowing that Harry is having the biggest internal battle he's ever faced. Pansy is watching Harry, and she grins when she sees a hairband around his wrist. She sits up straight, causing Harry to look up at her.
"Fuck off." Draco mutters and Harry chuckles again.
"Then come back to the common room!" Ron shouts and Blaise takes a step forward.
"What?" He asks, genuinely confused.
"So what did McGonagall say last night?" He asks as they start walking to Potions.
"You look incredible too, Pansy." Draco says before lowering his voice, "I'm still not sure this was a good idea."
"C'mon." Blaise says, leading Harry over to Draco. Harry follows nervously. He's been in the Slytherin common room once before but he was disguised as a Slytherin at the time. It's still pretty much the same though. Blaise puts his hand on Harry's shoulder and leads him to an arm chair next to where Draco is sat, pushing him down gently so he's sat down.
"Thank you." Harry smiles and rests his forehead on Dracos back.
"I hope so. Take a seat Potter." She says with a smile and Harry turns around to see most of the class is here. He walks over to his table in the back corner and sits down, pulling his hoodie sleeves over his hands. He knows people are watching him, his money is on Ron and Blaise, but he doesn't lift his gaze from the desk in front of him to check. McGonagall starts the class and Harry decides to spend the lesson writing his essay for potions, since he knows everything McGonagall is talking about.
"You did the essay?" He asks and Harry nods, shifting his backpack further onto his shoulder.
"Potter?" Draco asks softly and Harry blinks heavily before looking up.
"If you're gonna have attitude I don't think I want you sleeping on me anymore." Harry jokes and Draco pouts, gripping Harry's shirt.
"Harry?" He whispers, "Wake up." Harry groans to say he's awake and Draco smiles slightly and leans back a bit, moving his hand back to stroke Harry's cheek and Harry's eyes flutter open.
"It's going to be fun!" He's grinning, devious and maybe slightly evil, and Harry chuckles.
"Mister Potter, sir." Winky says as he enters and Harry sits at a table.
"What?" Harry asks, not able to focus on anything other than the fact that not only did Voldemort kill his parents but he killed his little sister.
"How come?" He's stroking Harry's back out of habit and it's sending shivers down Harry's spine. Harry isn't sure he wants to say exactly why he couldn't sleep so he presses his lips together and shrugs slightly.
Harry doesn't go to his dorm like he knows he should. He can't face Hermione's disappointment at the fact that he missed another meal, or Ron's sadness when Harry won't join in his conversations about quidditch. Quidditch. It's Wednesday, which means Harry only has 2 days to give McGonagall an answer about being Quidditch captain. Harry finds himself outside of Professor McGonagalls office and knocks on the door, hoping she's back from dinner and isn't busy.
"It's not my fault my father was a pure blood dickhead." He says and Harry chuckles.
"Can I go on a run?" McGonagall thinks for a second.
"I still miss you."
"Harry I know we weren't supportive but you didn't tell us anything."
"Where's your broom then, captain?" Harry asks and Blaise chuckles.
“Yeah?” He says.
"Wha- Why didn't you tell me?" He doesn't sound angry or upset, just confused.
"I went for a walk." He mumbles.
It’s Friday. Draco still hasn’t worked up the courage to interact with Potter apart from looking at him longingly or in concern. It’s driving Pansy and Blaise mad.
"Potter I don't know where I'm going." Draco mutters and Harry almost rolls his eyes at how ridiculous this scenario is.
"Harry, are you okay?" Luna rushes over and kneels beside him, touching his bare arm. "You're freezing!" She quickly casts a warming charm on him before sending up sparks so the others know she has him.
"Believe me, darlin, I haven't even thought about anyone since I finally got you." Harry murmurs in his ear and Dracos last remaining defense crumbles immediately.
"What a great idea, I don't know why I didn't think of that." He says, continuing his dinner. "I did." He adds, swallowing his food. "He didn't want to impose." Draco rolls his eyes as if he's had that conversation with Harry many times and always got the same answer, and Narcissa shakes her head with a fond smile.
"So, how are you?" He asks quietly and Harry looks at him over the cauldron.
"Not at me. I noticed Ron shoot a curse and I directed it to the side. It hit the other end of the pitch. I think I'm just tired and emotional and I used legilimency on 5 people and then silently and wandlessly redirected a curse." Harry says and McGonagall nods.
"Yeah!" He shouts back across the common room, standing up to join them,
”Yeah. You- you look great.” Draco echoes, blushing slightly, and Harry smiles slightly, nervously,  before standing up and turning back to Pansy.
"Not really. I don't want to be an auror. I know I'd make a good auror and people expect me to become one. But I don't think I can. I don't really wanna be fighting dark wizards anymore. I've been doing that for 18 years." Harry explains and McGonagall nods.
"Hermione he is our friend and he is flying with a snake. Literally." He says and Hermione sighs.
"He said he didn't need the mental image of us snogging." Harry says, smirking.
"I don't think so Teddy. Nanny Dromeda will be better by then and you'll be with her." Harry says, "But, I am going to give you your present now." Harry says and Teddy grins.
"So how was tryouts?" Ron asks and Harry shrugs.
"Hi, er, thanks." Harry says, handing the book to Blaise who takes it and places it on the desk in front of Draco, who is watching Harry with a weird look that Harry has never seen on anyone before.
"I don't know." Harry says, keeping his gaze on the ceiling. Blaise is silent for a few seconds, watching him. Harry's eyes flicker to different spots on the ceiling and Blaise can tell he's thinking.
"Like what?"
When Harry wakes up it's to Draco sleeping soundly. The sun is shining in streaks through the window behind him and it's causing a soft glow behind him and he looks so peaceful and beautiful and Harry decides he's going to tell him. He's going to tell him exactly how he feels, and he's going to tell Draco how much he needs him, and then it's going to be up to Draco to say whether he feels the same or not. Which he doesn't, and then he's going to feel too weird to be around Harry, and then Harry will feel awful and he will have to stop sleeping with him, and then Harry's going to have to go back to having nightmares every night and he won't be able to cope with that, he knows he won't. Then it's settled.
"Harry, mate, you're not gonna curse us." Dean says and Harry's gaze hardens and his jaw sets. Yes he fucking will.
"New book?" Hermione asks and Harry nods, looking down at it.
"Weasley." Draco whispers back and Harry nods slightly, leaning away from Draco to look at Ron. Ron places his hand on Harry's shoulder and squeezes.
By the time they get back to the common room an hour later the entire school has heard at least one of the names.
"Me too." They both have love bites, dark and big, on their necks, and Seamus is sure he's going to have bruises from Harry's grip, like how he's certain he's left bruises on Harry's hip.
"You okay?" Draco asks, voice soft and quiet. Harry isn't sure so he checks. He still feels a little bit dizzy, and he has a slight headache but the hand that is still rhythmically threading through his hair, as if unconsciously, is helping a great deal to both ease the headache and relax him.
"He's been crying." Blaise says and Draco frowns.
"Harry are you okay?" Blaise asks and Harry bites his cheek and gives Blaise a sort of pained look that says 'no but there's people near by, including Ron and Hermione who have just left the hall, that can hear us so I won't actually say that.' Blaise seems to understand, because he nods slowly and steps slightly closer.
"Harry I know you feel guilty about the war but starving yourself isn't helping anything." Draco says in his ear and Harry freezes, which makes Draco realise what he said. Well there goes the plan of getting Harry to tell him himself.
"So I bring the tone down? Depress the rest of you because I'm sad?"
"Potter do I need to talk to Madam Pomfrey and see if there's any way she can help you?" McGonagall asks and Harry sighs and shakes his head.
"It's not the reason I'm talking to Blaise. In fact it makes it slightly more awkward."
"You going to be okay?" Harry glances out the window, spotting Kingsley waiting for him, a few feet away from Narcissa Malfoy, before sighing and turning back to Draco with a small smile, trying to look like he's being honest when he says yes. "I'll write to you." Draco promises and Harry nods.
Harry has gone full radio silence, and it is freaking everyone out.
”Absolutely.” She turns to Blaise and Draco.
"Do- do you want to try and get some sleep now?" Harry presses his lips together. He would usually immediately say no to sleep, knowing that he will have nightmares, but if Draco is asking it might mean that he's going to stay with Harry whilst he sleeps, which means Harry wont have nightmares. Draco is watching Harry have some sort of internal battle, and waits patiently until Harry finally nods, eyes nervous for a split second before they shine with mischief.
"Hey, Harry." Fred says quietly before reaching out and hugging him. "I miss you. Tell George I'm okay and I'm watching over him. Make sure Ron and Ginny are okay. Tell Charlie if he doesn't marry Oliver then I will haunt him." He jokes and Harry nods. He didn't know he would be able to feel them, and upon realising this he squeezes Fred tight before turning to Sirius. He's missed his hugs so much, and when he's pulled into Sirius' chest and feels Sirius' chin on his head he can't help but cry into his chest.
"Fuck off, Blaise." Draco mutters, blushing, and Blaise smirks triumphantly.
"Okay, listen, Harry's asleep and he actually for once looks peaceful and if he's getting proper sleep I don't want to interrupt him." He leaves out the Malfoy part because he knows Dean and Seamus will probably go and interrupt them.
"Thank you, Potter." He says sincerely and Harry smiles, looking him in the eyes. Suddenly an announcement sounds to let eighth years know their curfew is in 10 minutes and Draco bites his lip.
"So what would you want?" Harry asks and Draco shrugs.
"Without me."
"I know it's nothing to do with me but I figured someone should check on you." Blaise says softly and Harry looks at him, seeing genuine worry, and he sighs.
"Fucking Quidditch." Harry mutters and Draco rolls his eyes.
"Come on lets get you a drink." Pansy adds, gesturing to the bar at the other end of the room.
"You think she knows somethings up?" He asks and Harry chuckles at him.
"No. I don't believe we have." Brandon says.
"Hi." He mutters, and Kingsley smiles wider.
"Helping him. Looking after him..." He pauses, wondering if he should say what he was going to before deciding fuck it. "Loving him." Dracos eyes widen but the blush on his cheeks tells Ron he's right.
"I, er- I see a therapist." Then after a second he adds "Apparently I'm more fucked up than everyone thought." He jokes slightly and Draco looks at him for a second, and if Harry had turned to meet his gaze he would have seen pain and sympathy in his eyes.
"I'm glad you're talking to someone, Harry. Even if it isn't us." She says and Harry turns his head to look at her. The second they lock eyes Harry has to force himself not to wince. All he can think of when he looks at her is hearing her scream in Malfoy Manner.
"Is that it mate?" Ron asks and Harry turns to look at him so he can see his reaction.
They wait quietly until Harry knocks on the door and pushes it open. He's wearing joggers and a hoodie and his hair is a mess as per usual. He looks between Draco and McGonagall a few times before frowning, confused. Draco smiles slightly because how could Harry not tell him he chose to room with Draco.
"What's up?" Seamus asks, resting his head on top of Harry's. He knows why Harry's sad most of the time, but he asks anyway in case there's something else bothering him.
“I’m gonna be an uncle!” Sirius says before pulling Lily in to join their hug, the other two joining in too.
"As do you, Blaise." Harry got on surprisingly well with the Slytherins.
”I reckon it’s a girl.” Draco says and Harry chuckles at him.
"Well, if you insist. You may go. And as you actually did the homework you do not need to come to detention." He says and Harry nods, leaving the classroom. He walks to his next lesson, History of Magic, and arrives just before the class starts. He places his essay on Professor Binns desk, who nods as a thank you, before making his way to his seat in the middle of the right row, next to Ron and behind Hermione. Draco is sat in the row behind Harry and a few seats to the left, and Harry can feel Dracos eyes on him through most of the lesson. Harry doesn't pay attention, though, and instead decides to read. Harry finishes sense and sensibility half way through the lesson and takes to looking out the window for the last half an hour. Hermione keeps turning round to ask if he's okay and Ron keeps giving him worried looks throughout the class and by the end of the hour he's had enough. The second Professor Binns says they can go Harry is out of his chair and on his way to the library before anyone can so much as call his name.
"Hermione I'm confused." He whispers and she follows his gaze to Malfoy.
"What's up?" Harry shrugs.
"Your mum knows?" He asks.
"If it's because he told your brother before he told you-" Draco starts and Ron interrupts him.
"I know, Potter, I was at the yule ball."
"I guess we do."
"I'm okay. You can move." Draco murmurs and Harry nods, resting his head on Dracos shoulder as he slowly pushes all the way in and it takes all he has not to come from the sensation of that alone. Draco's hand is in Harry's hair and tugging hard whilst the other is gripping Harrys hand tight and Harry is concerned he's hurting him so he lifts his head to see Draco's face. His eyes are squeezed shut and his lips are parted slightly and swollen from the kissing and his eyes flutter open to look at Harry and Harry feels his heart explode.
Harry can't read past those two words. The way
"They haven't been through as much as you, Harry. They were part of the war and they lost people, but you've been fighting your own battles since ye were a baby. You've been through more than any of them. That's why it affects you more than it effects them." Hagrid says and Harry nods.
"No, he just asked why I'm here then left." Harry presses his lips together and glances at Draco, meeting his gaze. Draco is watching Harry carefully, thinking about the drawings he saw and how soft Harry's hair is. Harry frowns slightly, his head tilting to the side slightly.
"Oh... Or we can not?" Harry asks and Draco rolls his eyes.
"Really?" Harry nods, looking at the floor in front of him. He's not great at lying, but he knows he and Draco need to discuss this before he can start spilling about their relationship.
"You're nervous?" Draco asks as they walk down the long path towards the front door, and Harry nods. He feels a bit sick, and the closer they get the door the worse he feels.
When they wake up they stand side by side next to the box of memories.
"3 hours, why?"
When he gets to the common room he sees Hermione, Ron and, surprisingly, Draco sat on the sofa by the fireplace. Draco is the first to notice him and when he sees Harry's smile he smiles.
"Thanks, the thing is for the essay we need to write about the origin of the spell but I've had a lot on my mind and I wasn't really paying attention during class and I will look it up later but just to get me started would you be willing to give me a brief overview?" Draco asks before adding, "I don't want to bother you but you're genuinely the best in our year and the professor is so busy." He bites his lip nervously, genuinely concerned this won't work, but Hermione just nods understandingly.
"After what?" Draco asks, not prying but asking in case Harry wants to talk about it.
Gryffindor are winning 60-50 when Harry finally catches a glimpse of the snitch and makes a beeline for it. The Ravenclaw seeker sees it at the same time and they both end up side by side diving towards the ground after the snitch. Harry smirks slightly as they near the ground, knowing full well Duncan, the Ravenclaw seeker, will give up before he does. Sure enough when there's only around 8 foot between the two boys and the solid ground Duncan pulls up, leaving Harry to grab the snitch. He knows he's going to hit the floor, so he grabs the snitch and rolls off of his broom in one swift motion, hitting the ground from 6ft up and rolling a bit on the floor before stopping. The whistle's been blown and his team are running towards him in concern.
“You- you do realise that was abuse right?” Draco says nervously and Harry tenses.
Harry and Draco decide to tell Blaise first, mainly because he shares a room with them most of the time and he probably already knows. They figure the sooner the better, too, so they only wait until the next day. They're sat on Draco's bed after lunch, cross legged and facing each other, knees pressed together, talking about nothing in particular but holding hands, Harry playing with Draco's fingers again. Harry is telling him about Remus and Sirius, and Draco is looking at him like he hung the moon in the sky. Blaise enters the room quietly, but smiles when he sees the way Draco looks so entranced and happy and just so damn in love.
"What?" He asks.
*Some not quite age appropriate stuff happens in this chapter you have been warned*
"Go to sleep, Harry." Blaise whispers before carefully getting out of the bed. Harry's asleep in minutes.
"Of course he doesn't know. He's so oblivious." The two lie in silence after that. Harry wondering what the fuck he's going to do, Blaise wondering how he's going to help Harry if he's moving back to the Gryffindor tower where not only is Blaise not allowed to go, but where he most definitely is not welcome.
"Okay, just let me know." Rhys says, walking back to the castle, not even acknowledging Draco's presence.
"Er, Granger, I er, I want to apologise for the way I treated you." Malfoy stutters but the sincerity is clear in his voice and Hermione smiles, knowing he means it.
"You wont curse me Draco." Harry breathes into his ear and Draco doesn't know how much longer he's going to be able to cope without grabbing Harry and kissing him. Harry is so sure of himself and he's right, Draco couldn't curse him. But he does hate how Harry can do nothing more than look at him and he's a gooey mess.
"I'm sorry." He whimpers and James shakes his head.
"Don't test me darlin, cause you know I would." Harry smirks and Draco blushes slightly.
"Yeah. You can move." He says and Harry kisses him passionately, placing the hand that isn't holding Dracos on the blond's side, as he pulls almost all the way out and thrusts back in, hitting Draco's prostate straight on. Draco lets out a loud moan into the kiss and Harry swallows it greedily.
"Er, I think he's in our common room." Harry bites his lip and runs a hand through his messy hair before looking back at the girl.
”Well his friends are clearly incompetent and either haven’t noticed or are so stupid they can’t help him. I mean Weasel asked him if he was okay 5 times in Potions today, and Granger keeps telling him he should eat. Yes he should eat because it looks like he hasn’t eaten in fucking months, I know for a fact he hasn't eaten anything since we've been back here, but her talking about it is clearly just making him feel worse. They don't know how to cheer him up or make him feel better, like what kind of ridiculous friends are they?” Draco rants and Pansy glances at Blaise, who shrugs.
"I love you." Harry smiles.
"The only people that knew were the members of the order and your aunt and uncle." She says and Harry frowns.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Unfortunately for me, you're a part of my life now, Harry." Draco's joking and Harry smiles slightly. "I can't enter a room without looking for you in it, subconsciously or not." Draco whispers and Harry catches his gaze and they stare at each other for a moment and Harry is searching for something and Draco doesn't know what it is but then Harry seems to find it, or not, Draco isn't sure, and Harry is raising their hands slightly and pressing a kiss to the back of Draco's hands and Draco blushes and Harry smiles slightly, resting their foreheads against each other again, eyes shut and hands connected.
"What do you think I want to do?" Draco whispers and Harry smiles, his mouth still next to Draco's ear so he can't see his expression.
"You're right, we shouldn't have come." Harry laughs again, drops Draco's hand and wraps his arm around his waist.
"You were the best keeper Rhys, don't tell the others, but you're welcome." Harry forces a smile, and Rhys grins.
"Yeah?" Draco chuckles.
"I'll come." And the grin that Draco gives him makes all the nerves Harry felt about the party worth it.
"Only partly. He came to see Ginny." Harry says, quieter so Ron doesn't hear. They basically were friends with benefits if he's being honest.
"Draco, dear, Harry is a lot nicer than the last boy you dated."
"No you're not." He says, and his tone is so much softer and more caring the Harry ever thought possible, and then before Harry can even respond Malfoy is turning around, opening the window and walking out of the bathroom. Harry stands still for a second, half because the room hasn't cooled down yet and he still feels dizzy, but also because his stomach is going crazy right now because Malfoy isn't just beautiful, he's also soft and caring. Although, does he care? Or is Harry seeing what he want's to see? Harry sighs before pulling on some clothes and grabbing his stuff, making his way to his dorm to put it all away before he has to go to herbology.
"No one has spoken to me about it. Ron was mad I didn't tell him. Then again I don't tell him a lot of things these days so I should probably get used to that." Harry mumbles and McGonagall frowns.
"You have feelings for me?" He asks and Harry rolls his eyes.
"Yeah okay." Harry says and Blaise smiles.
"After I left the library. Did anything happen?" Harry struggles to think that far back, having spent most of this morning thinking about how Dracos fingers felt as they ran over his dragon before remembering that Dracos tattoo will probably react to these thoughts and forcing himself to think of something else.
"Not you exactly, just, the idea of you not being here. You leaving. When school ends and I'm not gonna have you anymore." Harry sounds so genuinely scared that it breaks Draco's heart.
"I hate everything." Harry mutters and Seamus hugs him tighter.
"It does. However is it not better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all?" Harry frowns slightly and McGonagall continues, "Love usually ends in pain or sadness, Harry. But if you can have years, months, or even just weeks, full of happiness and love then surely it's worth it?"
“A pensive. Harry’s parents and Godfather left him memories.” Draco explains. Hermione frowns.
"You're a lot easier to break than I thought you would be." Harry mumbles, looking straight into Dracos eyes.
"No, I'm sorry, I'm fine. Go back to class." Harry says quietly and Blaise shakes his head.
"How'd you get in here?" She asks and Ron smiles awkwardly.
"That and the fact that you over-exhausted yourself." She says sternly and Harry shrinks into his pillow. He knows she's right but he doesn't need Draco and Blaise to know how fucked up he is. Pomfrey sighs and leaves the potion on his bedside table before walking away and Blaise looks at Harry.
"Don't need to be in the hospital wing anymore. s'long as I come to meals and stuff." Harry says, frowning slightly, and Draco looks at him for a second.
"I have transfiguration but it finishes at 4. I know fifth year has double herbology but I think it finishes at 3." Will says.
“I’m so sorry Harry.” He murmurs into Harry’s messy hair and Harry buries his head in Draco’s neck.
"I can't do it." He whimpers and Madam Pomfrey nods.
"I could do it for you." Draco raises an eyebrow.
"Okay. Had trouble falling asleep though." Harry admits and Draco frowns.
"You look great, Harry." She reassures, and Harry relaxes slightly.
"You just had a chat? Nothing happened? At all? Nothing? You? You are capable of being in the same room as someone you've fucked without fucking them?" Seamus asks, sounding genuinely shocked, and Harry smirks.
"Well yeah, can't argue with that. But you're also very pretty." Harry says and Draco looks shocked.
"And?" He asks and Harry pauses for a second.
"How did you know those so fast?" Blaise asks, glancing at Harry's parchment, and Harry shrugs.
"How?"
"I just- I was around." Harry mutters, continuing to stir the potion. Blaise watches him carefully as Harry keeps his gaze on the potion, as if trying to avoid everyone or pretend there's no one else there.
"And you went back to your aunt and uncle after the school year? Even after that?"
"Don't bring that up. How could you forgive him? And how could you tell George before me?" Ron asks angrily before standing up and walking away.
They continue the conversation as they enter the hall and sit down and as they talk Hermione notices Harry is so distracted by talking about Draco that he doesn't even realise he's eating dinner. Hermione's smile grows wider after this realisation and Harry looks at her confused.
"You're just going to upset him more."
"Lets go then." Blaise says, and Harry nods, standing up slowly.
"So, he should still know it's you by the handwriting, no?"
"Harry Potter." Harry says, holding his hand out.
"Alright you win." Harry says before kissing the back of Dracos hand.
"It has everything to do with you."
"You talk to my mother?" He asks and Harry smiles slightly.
"Makes a change." Harry breathes a laugh and Draco smiles properly.
"An how are things with Ron an that?"
"Harry I'm sorry." Ron says and Harry bites his lip. One glance in Rons eyes and he knows he's sincere, but he can't look at him for long. Ron notices this.
"No." Ron presses his knee against Harry's.
"Except mister Zabini and mister Malfoy."
"I know. Harry loves him too." Blaise nods.
Ron smiles at him when he walks into the classroom, and Harry nods in recognition, avoiding Dean's eyes for now. He's still not sure he's forgiven Dean. Harry sits next to Pansy, on the table behind Draco and Blaise, Blaise in front of Harry and Draco in front of Pansy, and half way through the lesson he gets bored and starts to draw. He sketches Draco as he can see him now in the corner of his parchment, and he notices Pansy watching him, transfixed, so he quickly sketches Blaise too, even though it's pretty much just the back of his head.
"I'm not top of every class, but fine, I'll get up."
"I was wondering if you had thought more about your future." She asks and Harry shakes his head.
"Ron, I need to tell you something. And you probably wont like it but I really hope you're okay with it." Harry rambles slightly and Ron frowns.
"Maybe you've lost your touch." Harry jokes quietly and Draco rolls his eyes and reaches his left hand up to run through Harry's hair.
"There you are!" Blaise says as he enters their dorm, immediately freezing when he sees Harry lying in Draco's bed. Draco carefully moves his forehead away from Harry's before turning to glare at Blaise, his fingers still buried in Harry's hair.
They hear raised voices, one belonging to the headteacher, from outside the hall after 10 minuets and everyone looks around confused before Headmaster McGonagall walks into the hall looking slightly annoyed and holding a baby with pastel green hair and bright blue eyes. Harry recognises him immediately as his two year old godson and frowns.
"Are you okay?" He asks and Harry bites the inside of his cheek. He would usually lie, especially to people he supposedly hated a few weeks ago, but for some reason, maybe because his friends haven't bothered to ask him in half a week, he just want's to be honest.
"I can?"
"Thanks, Harry." She says and Harry frowns slightly.
"It- what if it doesn't have to hurt?" Harry can't let himself believe that.
"Potter." She says and Harry almost laughs because she sounds so formal and reluctant.
"Was he nice to you? He didn't force you into anything did he?" He asks and Draco shakes his head.
"Alright, leave him alone now. We need to go to potions." Harry says and everyone agrees so Harry lets his hand fall from Draco's back to by his side and the four of them walk to potions.
Harry goes on his fourth run of the day, having to fit them in between classes. He's confused and sad and so damn tired and the sleep he had when he was lying on Draco was the first time in years that Harry didn't wake up from a nightmare and he knows it was because of Draco being there. He's top of every class, and he attends meals but doesn't eat, secretly vanishing food when Winky isn't looking to keep McGonagall off his back, and he's dizzy a lot and he's always exhausted and the dark bags under his eyes are a permanent part of his appearance now because he can't sleep for longer than 10 minutes before he's waking up from a nightmare. He showers because it's something to do but he puts no effort into his appearance and he's a mess and he lives in joggers and hoodies or muggle band t-shirts that belonged to Sirius.
"You seem kinda stressed. Also you're actually talking to me without punching me in the face." Draco says, referencing when she punched him years ago.
"You're not gonna sleep sitting up, Potter." Draco mumbles, and Harry breathes a laugh before sighing and lying down, his head on Draco's ridiculously soft pillow. Draco looks at him for a second and Harry takes a deep breath before looking up at him.
"Yes, professor?" Harry asks, half smiling slightly guiltily, as he reaches the table.
"I know, Potter. And may I say Poppy told me you have been eating and I am very proud of you." Harry bites his lip and looks down.
"I know."
"Well he's the only person that can help Harry, and we should thank him for it."
"Dwaco sad." Teddy says, his voice full of so much sympathy and Harry can see so much of Remus in him.
"Harry sir, It is good to have you back." Kreacher says, and Harry turns his head to the side to look at him.
"I would love to, Professor." Harry says and McGonagall smiles.
"Awww Draco, that's sweet." He says before they’re interrupted yet again.
"Traitor." He mutters and Harry chuckles.
"If you've really downgraded." Pansy immediately bursts into laughter.
The drawer of the table is open slightly and Draco can see a few books in it and he knows he shouldn't but he's curious and Harry's asleep and there's no one else here. He reaches over, careful not to jostle Harry, and opens the drawer more. The top book is the one Draco gave him and Draco's heart beats a little faster. The second book is what looks like a notebook. Draco pulls it out of the drawer, curious, and opens it to the first page. What he sees causes all of the oxygen to leave his lungs and he has to remind himself to breath again.
"Then- I- I think I want to do it. It'd be nice to have a distraction other than school work. And I miss it. A lot." Harry says and McGonagall smiles.
"But you must eat, sir. Winky insists." She says and Harry sighs, forcing down a few bites of the roll she hands him. Winky doesn't look pleased but seems to be fine with the fact that he's actually eaten something, and hands him another glass of water, which Harry downs gratefully.
He wants something to represent Harry; He prevented Draco and his mother from going to Azkaban but he also saved Dracos life. Besides, he's been in love with him since second year when Draco realised the so-called 'hatred' was actually just love.
Firstly, it's the one year anniversary of me posting the first chapter of this fic... How crazy is that?!
They spend the rest of the afternoon in the common room and after dinner Harry and Draco go up to their room.
”Beautiful.” Harry says, and Blaise laughs and Draco chuckles and Pansy smiles fondly and none of them mention the fact that Harry is running his hands through the sides and back of Dracos hair, careful not to disturb the style but threading his fingers through as if unconsciously. And when Blaise joins Pansy on the sofa and Draco stays on the floor in between Harry’s legs no one questions it.
He can't. 20 minutes later Rhys is heavy panting and sweating like crazy.
"What'd going on?" She asks, and Harry can see the concern clear in her eyes.
"We went through this earlier, darlin." He says, smirking and Draco pouts at him. Harry smirks and gets up, walking over to Draco and putting his hands either side of Draco's head against the headrest. He's still standing up so Draco has to look up at him and his face is chest height as Harry is leaning.
"Mister Potter I was not finished with you yet!" She says sternly, wanting to give him some dreamless sleep or see if there was anything else she could do. Harry glances at her before biting his lip. He really doesn't like to disrespect her, so he just sighs and sits back down on the bed, his back to Blaise and Malfoy.
"You don't still do that, do you?" Draco jokes quietly and Harry breathes out a laugh.
"Thank you, professor." Harry says as more students filter slowly into the class. Harry walks back to his desk and sits down just as Blaise sits next to him.
"See this is the problem. I love you loads Georgie but he doesn't get that I have been in love with Draco since I was 15 and I'm not gonna be fucking you because I've got him and I love him. Does Ron really think I'm that much of a shit person that I'm gonna cheat on Draco with the brother of my best friend?" Harry sounds hurt and Dracos heart basically bursts; Harry's been in love with him since he was 15? So he did used to fuck George. Draco's gonna have to figure out a way to bring that up subtlety and ask him about it.
"You jealous, Malfoy?" Draco focuses his gaze on his hand in Harry's. Harry is playing with his fingers absentmindedly and it makes Draco's heart flutter.
"Hey." Draco whispers, and Harry realises he's tensed up and is holding Dracos hand slightly too tight and is gripping his side tight too and he releases immediately, hoping he didn't hurt him.
"Draco, love, get up." Harry whispers and Draco opens his eyes and glares at him, but Harry called him love and he loves that so he gets up anyway.
Draco sees George sat with his hand on Harrys leg and frowns, walking closer and hiding behind a pillar so he can hear what they're saying. He knows he should trust Harry but George was looking at him weird and he's curious.
Draco walks up the stairs to the astronomy tower and breathes a sigh of relief when he sees Harry. He hasn't been able to find him since he left the library 4 hours ago. Harry hears footsteps approach and knows who it is immediately.
"I see a therapist but I'm still depressed. And I feel empty and tired and I don't know what I'm doing. I can't remember the last time I ate. And I'm so tired. All the time. And I don't know why I keep trying. And I just want to give up. But sometimes..." Harry trails off.
"And you were okay with it?" She asks Ron.
"He sticks up for people that deserve it. He sticks up for people he cares about." Hermione says and Draco glances at the back of Harry again. He's leans against the bar, chatting to the barman, and Draco can't help but feel jealous when the barman smiles as he hands over the drinks. Harry walks back over to the table and his heart flutters slightly at the way Draco is watching him. Harry puts the drinks on the table before sitting next to Draco, pressing his knee against Dracos and Draco has to bite the inside of his cheek in order to stop himself from grinning like a lunatic in the middle of the pub.
"I'll get the ingredients." Harry says, figuring it's only fair since Blaise got them last time. He walks over to the cupboard, ignoring the looks Hermione and Seamus give him. Harry reaches for the scurvy grass at the same time as Malfoy and Harry notices the other boy blush when their hands touch. They both pull their hands back quickly, and when Malfoy doesn't reach for it again Harry takes the jar off the shelf and holds it out to Malfoy. Malfoy looks shocked for a second, not meeting Harry's gaze, before he takes 5 blades of grass.
"How did you make it move?" He asks and Harry smiles rather sheepishly.
Harry has been asleep for 3 hours. Pansy came to join Blaise and Draco, glancing at Harry and Draco before smiling slightly as she sits next to Blaise. The three are talking quietly and joking around like they usually do, just at a lower volume, all the while Draco doesn't stop moving his hands through Harry's hair and across his back and down his sides.
"Harry I hear Draco is your secret boyfriend." A Ravenclaw calls and Harry smirks.
"If you need anything." Harry nods again before showing Kingsley out, thanking him because he's actually been so good to Harry since the war,
"I'll try." He lies, pressing a kiss to Draco's cheek before picking up his backpack and leaving the carriage, giving Draco's hand one last squeeze before getting off the train.
"But... since when?" He asks and Harry shrugs, seeming so confident that Draco's annoyed he's such a nervous mess.
"Oh yeah, not like exploding but blew up like a balloon." Draco laughs.
He runs and he keeps running until his legs go numb; and when he finally feels like his lungs are on fire and he's struggling to breath he slows to a light jog and runs for another half an hour before he stops, breathing heavily, and makes his way to his dorm so he can shower. He's not sure what time it is. He knows he missed dinner and it's dark outside but not too dark, so it's probably around 9pm. Harry showers on the sixth floor and by the time he gets back to his dorm he's exhausted. It's around quarter to ten and the beds in his dorm are unoccupied so he walks over and sits down, pulling the curtains around so he's hidden. He reaches into his trunk and grabs the notebook that he hid under clothes before sitting back against his headboard. He doesn't always open and read the notebook, and he doesn't always add to it, sometimes he just holds it, because even that is enough to remind him of every single thing that's ever happened to him. Today is one of those days. He's not adding anything new to the innumerable pages that he's written over the years. He's simply sitting there, on a Friday night, in the dark, the rain hitting the window and the distant sound of thunder accompanied by the occasional flash of lightning, wallowing in the horrific nightmare that is his past.
Harry debates whether he should continue his breakdown or tell Malfoy not to be a nosey prick and piss off. Draco watches Harry's expression change from guilt to looking torn before his expression goes back to looking guilty and sad.
"He's fine." Seamus says, and Hermione shakes her head.
Okay so I completely forgot to post this chapter earlier today and now it’s 10 past midnight but I’m gonna post it anyway and I just hope you all like it <3
"Thus begins the pain that will come my way." Draco jokes and Harry chuckles.
"Yeah, that's a relatively new development." He says and Draco laughs slightly, making Harry frown.
"Hi." His voice sounds raspy as he hasn't spoken in who knows how long, so he clears his throat and continues. "Sorry I didn't write much." He only wrote back so they knew he was alive.
"Yeah. Probably." Draco stands up and holds his hand out for Harry who takes it, standing with him.
"Okay." Draco says, shrugging his shoulder slightly so Harry sits up. They let go of each others hands whilst they stand up, and as they're leaving the hall Harry links their little fingers together and he knows how this looks, he knows what everyone will think and assume, but he doesn't really care. The entirety of Slytherin already think he and Draco are together as they know Harry spends almost every night in their dorm, so it's not like this will shock anyone. They probably expect it.
"Teddy." He calls softly and Teddy stops giggling at the birds and looks at Harry. Harry holds his arms open and Teddy runs into them, allowing him to scoop him up. They say bye to Ron and Hermione, Harry telling them he'll see them at lunch probably, and they make their way to the library.
"It was there when I woke up." Harry says, realising that if Blaise didn't know about it then Draco must have brought it. Blaise must notice the same thing because his eyes widen slightly before he smirks.
"What?" Draco whispers back and Harry looks into his eyes, trying to figure out what to say.
"You're so fucking smug." Draco mutters and Harry just winks before leaning forward and pressing his lips against Dracos. Draco melts against Harry and Harrys hands move from either side of Dracos head to in his hair, threading his fingers through the usually perfect blond hair, deepening the kiss.
"It's fine. Don't worry."
"And have you eaten anything?" Harry presses his lips together and avoids the gaze of the three people around him.
"Yeah, go figure."
"Had to."
"I think Harry said something to them all, but like, in their heads, because they sort of just, left." Draco says.
"Sorry." He mutters before rushing away, and Harry flexes his hand a few times, taking a breath to calm down before turning to Blaise.
"I didn't want to be a part of any of this." She says and Harry sighs.
"You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue. Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean... yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen." Harry continues looking Draco in the eyes, and Draco knows his face is bright red but for whatever reason he can't break the eye contact. Harry's expression is unreadable as he continues, but he's admiring the way Draco is looking at him.
"Harry, I don't know why you're surprised. You knew you had to hold your breath for an hour in fourth year and didn't try to figure out how until an hour before you had to do so." Hermione says and Harry rolls his eyes, shoving a chip in his mouth.
"Don't need to when you can warm me up, do I." He says and Draco looks at him, pleading him slightly.
"Seamus, Jason, Dean, Cedric, and George." Harry says, biting his lip.
"So Harry, how was trying to work with a baby and a Malfoy?" Ron asks as Harry lets Teddy sit on the bench next to him, holding the bear that had been in his bag.
"He told you?!" Blaise asks, kind of excited because Draco is finally,
"Alright well," He turns to Draco. "Harry has no parents or biological siblings, sorry for bringing it up mate, therefore as the next best thing, I am going to give you what sounds like a joke but is actually a very serious and very real threat if you hurt our boy, you're going to say that you wont and then you and Harry are going to do that gross cringe thing where you grin at each other all lovey dovey and I'm probably going to vom. So if you hurt our Harry I will hex your dick off and force you to eat it." George says and Harry laughs.
"Yeah?" He asks, pausing as he's putting his textbook back in his bag.
“I’m gonna be a dad!” He grins and Sirius pats his back.
"Yeah..."
Quick question... I'm kind of at a loss as to how I want Harry and Draco to get together, like, I've got SO many ideas, I just don't know which one to use and I need your opinion please!!!
"Okay. I saw you and Mr. Zabini talking earlier. Was that something I should be concerned about?"
Blaise enters the hospital wing and looks over at Harry's bed to see him fast asleep, one arm across his stomach and the other hanging over the side of the bed. He looks somewhat peaceful for the first time in ages and Blaise smiles slightly, hoping Harry is actually getting some decent sleep for once. Blaise sits in the chair next to Harry's bed and after a few minutes Harry starts whimpering. Blaise watches helplessly for a minute before Harry whimpers and his eyes snap open with a gasp.
"I'm sorry I didn't help you. You know, that's the most I've heard you say in months." Ron jokes, and Harry smiles slightly.
"Where are we going?" Draco asks and Harry smiles.
"Harry- He's scared. He's constantly scared and he's constantly hurting and he doesn't want to involve anyone in that. Keeps saying that lo-"
"Is there something wrong, professor?" Draco asks and she smiles sincerely.
"Hey, Ron?" Seamus whispers as he sits down opposite him.
"I need you to say it, Draco." He says, needing verbal confirmation or he will feel like Draco is only doing it because he feels like he needs to.
"How about a one on one seeker match later? Or we can just chat?" He mutters quietly, and Harry thinks for a second. He can see a confused almost annoyed look on his friends faces out of the corner of his eye, but he figures at least Blaise cares enough to try and help him.
"You also didn't eat lunch." Malfoy says.
"You just love to tease me don't you, Potter." Draco says and Harry grins.
"I wanted to show you how much you mean to me, and I figured showing you my spot would kinda send that message. And..." He trails off and Draco bites his lip.
“I get that a lot.” He jokes, wiping his eye. Something about seeing his parents so happy to be having him makes him emotional.
"And you're always sad."
"Well I'm thrilled that I'm winning." Seamus says, winking at Harry who smirks.
"People that are fine do not go missing for 11 hours." She says, her tone somehow both snappy and soft towards Seamus and Harry respectively. Harry looks down at the grass beneath his feet, wanting nothing more than to go and sleep or at least shower, however they have breakfast and then classes so he can't do either of those. Except he's not hungry so he can skip breakfast for a shower.
"Just stuff." He says and Harry rolls his eyes.
"You tell anyone about this Potter and I'll hex your balls off." He growls and Harry grins at him, seeing an unknown emotion flash in Draco's eyes.
"Of course mister Potter sir." Winky puts a plate of food in front of him and Harry grimaces at it. It's pie. He likes pie. He just can't bring himself to eat. He takes a small amount of mash on his fork and slowly forces himself to eat it. He manages to eat almost half of the pie and a few mouthfuls of mash before putting his fork down, deciding he can't make himself eat any more. He leaves the kitchen and manages to get half way to the hospital wing when he runs into McGonagall.
"Good or things would've got very awkward very quickly." Harry says and Draco rolls his eyes before leaning forward hesitantly and pressing his lips against Harry's. Harry pulls away after a few minutes and chuckles slightly.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I've spoken to Professor McGonagall and a few healers from St. Mungos. We think you have PTSD, Harry." She says softly and Harry looks at her for a second before nodding. It makes sense. Sirius told him that he had PTSD when he was in Azkaban, about the war, and then when he got out of Azkaban about being in prison. Harry recognised his symptoms from when Sirius would tell him about it.
"Give us a spin, Harry!" Seamus calls and Harry chuckles at his childish behaviour. Harry holds his arms out to the sides and slowly turns around so everyone in the hall can see his tattoos.
"You okay?" Harry knows Ron can tell when he's lying.
"You?"
"I-" The room is dark, the only light from the moon shining through the window above them, and Harry can't help but wish he could lean forward and kiss Draco. "I'm really hoping being with you will help." Harry whispers, and it's not only because he doesn't want to have nightmares, but because then he'll have an excuse to sleep with Draco every night. Draco strokes Harry's cheek again softly before smiling slightly.
"I'm sure, Harry." Draco says, loving how sweet Harry is. Harry presses a kiss to Draco's forehead before pulling him into a kiss, which Draco immediately deepens. As they kiss Harry walks Draco over to the bed and pushes him onto it, not breaking their kiss as he crawls on top of him and leans on his forearms so he's touching Draco but not crushing him. Dracos legs are wrapped around Harry’s waist and his hands are running all over Harry's body whilst Harry's hands in Dracos hair, loving how his usually neat hair is an absolute mess and is so soft. They stay like this for a few minutes, just kissing and feeling and loving each other, before Draco wants more.
I just want to thank you all for being so bloody patient, I love you all so much ♥
"Well Seamus has the most votes, then second place Malfoy with Jason being a very close third. I'm personally offended that I have so few votes, I mean Blaise has more votes than me." Dean says and Harry chuckles.
Shits about to get real cute my dudes
"You're so pretty." He says, and just like that Draco is looking at him with all the love in the world.
"You looked a little worried or something earlier." Draco says and Harry bites his lips again. He's never been this nervous before.
Draco's eyes have filled with tears, and Harry didn't want to make him cry.
"Well that's cause you're not trying hard enough." Draco says, rolling onto his side too. Harry bites his lip.
"Okay so after dinner Malfoy came to my room and we spoke and I taught him how to do a patronus and I showed him my tattoos and he said he wanted to cover his dark mark so I tattoo'd over it for him and Hermione I am actually fucked." Harry ends with a sigh and Hermione rolls her eyes.
He finds her sitting alone in the back of the library, as usual, and sits opposite her.
Draco was going to go and do homework or something in the library, but Harry starts walking towards the quidditch pitch and doesn't let go of his hand, and that's how Draco ends up in the stands watching the Gryffindor team practice. He doesn't mind, because this is just an excuse to watch Harry play, and Harry looks amazing when he's flying through the air, focused look on his face. So he doesn't mind sitting on the bench in the cold watching Harry captain his team. That is until Harry flies near their keeper and the git starts flirting with him. Draco glares at Davies for the rest of the practice.
Silence hurts more than any insult Draco could have shouted at him.
"Shit! Hermione can you watch Teddy?" Harry asks, already passing him to her as he and Ron run to the quidditch pitch and into the changing rooms. He forgot it was the day of the first match of the season. They hurriedly change into their quidditch robes and grab their brooms before getting ready to go onto the pitch.
"I think you should shut up." Harry replies, stepping closer to Draco.
"Thank you."
"Yeah, they do that sometimes. I think they get bored." Harry say which is true, but Draco's was definitely triggered by his emotions.
"I don't know." He mumbles, closing his eyes with a sigh. Draco's thumb strokes across his cheek again and Harry leans forward and rests their foreheads against each other again. Draco takes a deep breath before running a hand through Harry's hair.
"Iris." He tells her and she frowns.
Ron is looking at him in shock and Harry can't take it anymore. He just sighs, grabs his book, and leaves the room, walking past Hermione, Ginny, Dean and Seamus, who apparently were all listening at the door. They look guiltily at Harry as he walks past but he doesn't stop to listen to them try and defend themselves, instead walking down the stairs and straight out of the common room. He doesn't know where he's going, but he needs to get away from his friends. He walks around, trying to keep the tears from running down his cheeks, until he finds himself outside of the headmasters office. He debates whether or not he should knock, before deciding against it. He doesn't want to disrupt her. He continues wondering the castle, and as it's only 8:30 there are still a few people walking around. Harry doesn't know what he needs or wants to do, but when he sees a third year Slytherin on the ground floor he feels the need to talk to Blaise.
"I know. I'll give you time to think about it, but I really think it will be good for you."
Draco doesn't know for sure what makes Potter so broken, but he has a pretty good idea. He does want to know for certain though, and if Potter won't tell him then he'll need to get one of his friends to. Weasley is completely out of the question; they hate each other. Draco refuses to talk to the Weaslette because she's annoying and, aren't her and Potter dating? Seamus and Dean will definitely not say anything and will tell Potter he's trying to get information. Neville is just a lost cause, so that leaves Granger. Draco has a pretty good idea of how to get her to talk. Either get her so mad that she starts ranting without realising what she's saying and hope she spills what's wrong with Potter, or ask her about a class and while she's excitedly talking about school slyly bring up Potter. He decides not to get on her bad side, anymore than he already is, and try the 'butter her up' option first.
"Harry you need to eat." Harry shrugs and steps away from the bench, not even bothering to answer before he leaves the hall. All he wants to do is go to his dorm and sleep, but Malfoy will show up eventually. But there is one place no one will think to look for him. Instead of turning right and going up the stairs he turns left and walks out of the castle.
"You sure you're not gonna eat anything?" Draco asks quietly, squeezing Harry's hand slightly which he's been holding throughout lunch. Harry blinks his eyes open before shaking his head, which is still resting on Draco's shoulder.
"Party in the room of requirement?" Dean calls and Ron grins.
"Harry?" Draco asks, and Harry blinks himself out of his daze.
"You think we've caused enough chaos?" Draco murmurs, his head resting on Harry's shoulder, tracing the scars on his torso, still slightly breathless from what he and Harry have spent all morning doing.
"We are less disgusting than you and Ron." Harry jokes and Ron leans back in his chair and shrugs one shoulder, smiling at Hermione, who blushes faintly.
Harry walks up to his room and sits Teddy on his lap facing him once he's sat down on the sofa. It's Teddy's birthday soon but Harry feels like Teddy's grandmother will be well enough to care for him soon and he will probably be back with her on his birthday. Harry accio's his present to him and Teddy grins.
"Why?" He asks and it's Draco's turn to frown.
Deciding this is a good idea, Harry starts walking towards the tower, following behind his friends, and he slips away undetected as they enter the hall before him. Harry makes his way to the dorm, grabbing his shower stuff and some clothes, before making his way to the 6th floor. There's a bathroom that not many people know about down a fairly unused hallway, and Harry knows he wont be interrupted. He strips out of his clothes and turns the water on as hot as it will go before stepping into the shower. The water is so hot that it almost feels cold as it hits Harrys cold skin and he winces slightly but doesn't turn it down, instead he steps fully under the shower head and winces again when the steaming hot water hits his scalp.
They're met halfway between the quidditch pitch and the forest, and Harry isn't expecting Hermione to cry when she sees him. He really isn't expecting Ron to breathe a sigh of relief and pull him into a hug. Ron hates hugs.
"What's wrong, pup?" Sirius asks, sitting on the bed next to him, and Harry whimpers when Sirius pulls him into a hug.
Harry and Draco run into Ron as they're leaving the library, their little fingers hooked together.
"Well it's more than you said in September." He says, taking Harry's bag from him and gripping his shoulder. Harry glances at Draco long enough to see him smile in his direction before Draco and the station disappear and he's stood in front of 12 Grimmauld place. Kingsley enters the house first, something about making sure there's no one hiding there despite the countless protection charms on the house, and Harry walks in behind him. It's clean and bright and he can tell Kreacher has lit Harry's favourite candle somewhere because it smells of his white vanilla bean candle, along with the distinct waft of pie coming from the kitchen. Kingsley puts Harry's bag in the living room before turning to Harry, looking nervous to leave him on his own.
"I know, Professor."
"Yeah, looking forward to the match next week?" Harry's eyes widen and he sits up straight.
"My book. I figured it was you, cause it was either you or Blaise and unless he's a better actor than I thought he had no idea it was here." Harry says, smiling slightly, and Dracos eyes flicker from Harry's face to the book and back again.
"Nothing much. Told me I'm meant to eat. Also told me I'm meant to stay with you or Malfoy. Nothing else really." He says and Blaise nods.
He sits in the very back corner during History of Magic, next to Blaise, and when Draco enters the classroom he sits on the other side of Blaise, Pansy next to Draco. Harry hasn't seen Pansy much, and he hasn't spoken to her at all, but she gives him a sympathetic smile as she sits down and Harry figures she's not that bad. Professor Binns is rambling on about something or another and Harry sighs, feeling the thoughts and emotions and fear taking over, and he knows he needs to get the hell out of the class before he has a full on breakdown.
"Same goes for you too, Gryffindors. Now mount your brooms." He says and both teams do, each keeper flying to the ends of the pitch and the rest hovering above their captains.
"A few."
"So you have a tattoo?" Draco asks trying to change the subject but also curious. He's wanted to cover his dark mark with one ever since he got it, even more so when the Dark Lord was defeated, and whoever did Potters could do his.
Anyway hope you like the chapter :)
Nothing has changed between the two during the day, though. They still only call each other by their last name, they still make sarcastic comments and jokes and still outwardly 'hate' each other, but at night when they're alone in their dorm room, just the two of them, they're both so sweet and nice and supportive to each other and they're both so in love that it's a shame they won't tell each other.
"Okay. I think that's enough practice for today." Blaise announces through breaths as he slowly composes himself and the two teams turn to look at Harry and Blaise.
"Is there something you ain't telling me, mate?" He asks and Harry bites his lip, the least he could do is tell Ron that he and Draco aren't fighting 24/7.
"You both look incredible! Way to make us all look like shit." Pansy says, and Harry rolls his eyes because Pansy always looks beautiful.
"I miss you, Georgie." Harry smiles sadly and George chuckles, pulling Harry into a bear hug.
"I wonder what form mine would take." Draco thinks out loud and Potter looks at him.
"Like the fact that he is the best friend of Mr. Malfoy." She says with a smirk and Harry's eyes widen slightly before he quickly looks down, fiddling with the bottom of his shirt.
"So are you going to introduce me to your dashing friend?" Narcissa teases Draco, and he rolls his eyes but plays along. He guesses they actually haven't been properly introduced.
"Harry." She says softly and Harry sighs.
"I'll see you at lunch." Harry promises and Blaise sighs.
They're in no particular order, just the order of which Harry remembered them and wrote them down. But the notebook is full of things like this from Harry's past. No one knows about the notebook, and no one knows any of the things written in it apart from the people that did or witnessed them. It's a book full of things Harry is ashamed of, and he doesn't want anyone to know. He hears people entering the common room and puts the book back in his bedside table before anyone comes in, instead picking up sense and sensibility. He's almost finished it when a cat patronus appears in front of him and tells him he is supposed to be in McGonagalls office, so Harry sighs, stands up and makes his way to her office.
"I don't know what to do with this information." He says and Hermione chuckles.
"Darlin you do realise just because he's third doesn't mean I want to date him. He just happened to be one of the people I used to start rumours." Harry kisses Draco on the lips before smirking.
"Okay. But if you don't turn up for lunch I will personally drag you there." He says and he looks at Harry for a second longer before sighing again and patting Harry's leg.
They run a few more drills and by the end of tryouts everyone is sweating and out of breath and exhausted but excited. They all land and Harry lands in front of them. He's out of breath, having been flying up and down the pitch and running back and forth and having to shout to be heard for the past 2 and a half hours. He pulls off his hoodie, forgetting he hasn't got a top on underneath but not caring, and wipes his face with it.
"You're perfect for each other." He says, voice quiet and genuine. Draco blushes, but his hand doesn't stop threading through the mess of curls on Harry's head.
"Thank you." He rushes to his dorm room, knowing it's empty, and drops his bag off before taking off for his run. There are students on the grass outside who watch him as he jogs past them, but Harry ignores them and keeps running. He has no idea what to do now. Ron is going to expect him to talk to him now that they've made up, and so is Seamus. Harry really doesn't want to talk to them. On Harry's second lap of the grounds he hears footsteps behind him and looks to see Rhys running behind him.
"Was that an invitation, Harry?" Seamus smirks, leaning close to harry, and Harry sees Draco out of the corner of his eye looking nervous, as if he thinks Harry's being serious. Harry leans forward as if he's about to kiss Seamus but stops with a few inches between them.
"It's okay, honestly."
"You know, I do actually do work sometimes." He mutters and Hermione smiles at him, before nodding at Ron and then at Draco before raising an eyebrow. Harry just rolls his eyes at her. He hasn't officially told Ron that him and Draco are together, but he knows Ron isn't stupid and can easily put 2 and 2 together.
"And you brought a guest." She says, looking at Harry carefully, and Narcissa smiles at him.
"You ready?" Harry nods before raising their linked hands and pressing a kiss to Draco's knuckles.
"When did she find out?" He asks.
"Well I ran into your future husband and we both reached for the book so I let him take it." Blaise says and Draco's eyes widen.
"I need to get to class but I'll come see you again later, yeah?"
"Potter how are you?" She asks and Harry shrugs, forcing himself to take a bite of a potato. He may have slept for a few hours but it was full of fear and nightmares and he still feels exhausted.
"How many songs do you know?" He asks instead, nodding to the guitar, and Harry shrugs.
"Oh, Hey Granger, Weasley. Sorry I'll leave you to it." Draco says and Hermione smiles.
(See the end of the chapter for
"We were just talking." Seamus says, looking at Harry in a pleading way, as if he desperately want's to talk to him. Blaise looks at Harry and he looks conflicted.
Harry takes Teddy to Ms Pomfrey before rejoining Hermione and Ron at the potions classroom.
"Added to what?" Harry asks and he can feel Dracos eyes on him. McGonagall stands from her chair, walks over to a shelf and picks up a fairly large black leather box, like a smaller version of a trunk. She walks over and places it on the desk in front of Harry before standing to the side. On the top of the box are the letters HJP written in gold. Harry stands up, looks at it, then looks at McGonagall.
"Homework, Harry?" He asks, snapping Harry out of his daydream. He's only been back 3 days and he's already being called out in class. Harry blinks slowly before looking up at Slughorn. Professor Slughorn is looking at him expectantly and Harry can feel the eyes of the class on him too. It seems they've all paused in the middle of packing up to watch the interaction. Harry just shrugs and Slughorn sighs.
"Everything, I guess." Harry feels sick all of a sudden, the memory of everything washing over him like a tidal wave.
"You wanna talk?" Seamus asks and Harry shakes his head. Seamus sighs and squeezes Harrys shoulder tighter before leading him down the corridor on the left and up some stairs until they're in an empty classroom. Harry sighs and sits on a desk and Seamus shuts the door and sits next to him.
"No. But who they were is." Draco says and Harry sighs.
so I thought I'd post again this week because I'm a lovely person and I love you. It is absolutely for that reason and definitely not because I'm bored at work. Definitely not. Maybe a little. Anyway hope you enjoy :)
"Watch it. I may be lying on your lap but I'll still curse the fuck out of you." Harry jokes and Draco rolls his eyes but Harry notices his pale cheeks turn slightly pink.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Do you think Ron will ever be okay with us?" Draco asks, resting his arms around Harrys neck loosely.
"He's welcome here, Draco. Any time, for however long." Narcissa says softly, and Draco smiles at her.
"Be right back." He mutters before walking over to McGonagall.
"Yeah well you look good when you fly." Draco says and Harry smiles.
"You were also supposed to stay with either Blaise or Draco."
"Harry, are you okay?" Hermione asks and Harry can tell Malfoy, Pansy and Blaise are subtlety listening to their conversation and he can feel Malfoys eyes on him. Harry looks up from his book at Hermione and nods. Hermione frowns and looks desperately at Harry, who sighs.
"Thank you." Harry grins, kisses him again.
"I- I can't." He mutters, taking a sip, and he sees Hagrid looking at him sadly.
Throughout the lesson Seamus keeps leaning into Harry and whispering names to see how he reacts, but he just shakes his head and whispers 'after class'. The second the lesson ends Seamus grins and grabs Harrys arm, pulling him out of the greenhouse and round a corner where no one is.
"I won't pretend I don't know how you feel, Harry. I was engaged once, to a muggle, whom I loved dearly, but my mother was a wizard and when my father found out it ruined their marriage, so I knew a relationship between wizard and muggle wouldn't work out, and I left him. I left him to prevent the inevitably painful end that would eventually happen, but in doing so I cut down the time I had with him. I could have had so many more years with him, but I was scared." She says, and Harry can hear the emotion in her voice. Harry doesn't know what to say. She has a point, as she always does, but Harry is still scared.
"Whats up?" Harry asks, not really in the mood to be confronted.
"Now?" Harry offers and Draco nods. Harry instructs Draco to stand up and he stands beside him.
"Thanks." He says and Harry can't keep the small smile off his face.
"Are you okay?" Draco asks and Harry sighs. Not really. He's head over heels in love with Draco but will never tell him and he wishes he could talk to Draco but he can't and he keeps thinking about the blond boy that has somehow taken his heart and ran off with it. Of course he can't say that so he just mutters that he's fine.
“Draco, what’s wrong? You look like a lovesick puppy.” Pansy teases and Draco glares at her. It's been 2 hours since Potter left the library and he can't stop thinking about how unhappy he looked.
"So are we! Harry how could you!" Seamus shouts dramatically and Harry bites his lip.
Anyways I hope you all like the update, let me know what you thing <3
They walk to the great hall together before Draco goes over to join Pansy at the slytherin table.
"Oh, Draco, you really need to talk to him." She sighs, feeling bad for her best friend. Draco knows she's right, but how on earth is he going to even begin to talk to Potter.
"What happened?" Dean asks when they convene in the boys dorm after herbology. Seamus is leaning against his chest as usual, the others spread around the dorm room. Seamus explains his conversation with Harry and what Harry said and by the end of it everyone is looking guilty.
"Well-"
"How can you be so sure?" Draco tries with a witty remark but he's kind of breathless and he sounds more needy than annoyed.
"Nah I'll do it." Harry says before standing up and moving further down the table to sit next to Rhys and Will Cameron, one of the new Beaters, who is in sixth year.
"I've been thinking." A voice next to him says and Harry didn't know there was anyone with him.
"I don't let myself think about it." Harry says and Hagrid nods.
"I don't know what I'm doing." Harry looks beyond the lake, staring where the mountains meet the stars.
"I'll tell you later." Harry says before motioning for Draco to walk with him. There's a few people near the tree when they get to it so Harry takes out the cloak and removes the charm so it's normal sized. He puts his wand back in his back pocket and checks no one is looking before stepping closer to Draco and throwing the cloak round both of them. Draco struggles to breath when Harry steps closer and frowns in confusion when Harry throws a cloak round them both, still confused why they're standing next to the whomping willow.
"Mate what are you doing?" Ron asks and Harry doesn't know what to do. Everyone is looking at him and he hates it when everyone is looking at him and Draco and Blaise are just waiting to see what Harry says but Ron and Dean and everyone is looking at him expectantly and he can't help it. Before he can stop himself he's looking into Rons head again, seeing the conversation he had earlier with the rest of the guys, and takes a shaky breath in as he leaves his mind.
"Why?"
"Can he come here? At least for the first visit?"
"I don't think your dorm-mates will like it much if they find a snake here." Draco says and Harry shifts away from Draco slightly before lying down, his head in Dracos lap. He'll blame exhaustion if Draco questions him.
"We're gallivanting." Harry says with a smirk. He respects McGonagall to no end but he can't help but sass a teacher given the chance. McGonagall tries not to smile but she can't help it, she's grown rather fond of Harry too, so much so that she knows he's keeping something from her.
"By the entrance hall." Blaise stands up immediately and, after a look to Draco that he hoped told him everything would be fine, he leaves the common room.
"I'm Harry fucking Potter. Besides, I do this all the time." He says, admiring how Dracos eyes basically glow in the dark.
"What if he wakes up? Or has a nightmare?"
"Yes, Harry. I love you." Harry smiles slightly, but it quickly changes to a small frown.
"Sorry."
"Why didn't you like your aunt and uncle?" Draco asks, he assumed Harry would have been spoiled when he was a kid, considering he was the one that defeated Voldemort.
(See the end of the chapter for
"What about Draco?" Harry is about to talk about the book, but then he stops himself. Does he really want Blaise to know he knows? Blaise might tell Draco, and Harry wants to be the one to do that. If he ever figures out how to mention it, or if he ever get's Draco alone.
"Well it worked, didn't it?" She asks just as Seamus rounds the corner and freezes. He looks between the Slytherins before his eyes land on Harry, clearly asleep but not writhing around or screaming and crying like he usually is. Seamus' eyes widen slightly.
"Nothing really, wanted to know if we had homework." Harry lies easily and Ron nods, not buying it at all.
"I couldn't get too drunk, Draco. I have a quidditch match today. Actually I have a quidditch match in a few hours so I need to get up at some point." He says but he doesn't actually make a move to get up and when Draco buries his head in Harrys neck Harry wishes he never had to get up again.
"I need to help Harry." He says simply, and Blaise and Pansy let it go.
"We miss you too, but you're doing so well, Harry." James says and Harry shakes his head.
"I'm fine." He mumbles quietly, knowing he's lying but not being able to make himself feel guilty. He sees Malfoy frown out of the corner of his eye and wonders what he's thinking about. However he can't exactly go and ask him so he just bites his lip and looks down. He puts his textbook in his bag and stands up, not knowing where he's going but knowing if he has to look at the worried pleading look on Hermione's face any longer he's going to break down.
"You're actually eating." She says and Harry looks down at his half empty plate before looking up at Hermione in shock.
"Did something happen?" She asks and Harry smirks.
"Hey." Harry murmurs into Dracos hair, wrapping his arms around Draco and pulling him against his chest.
"Yes Harry?" Hermione asks, looking amused. Harry walks over so he's behind her and wraps his arms around her, leaning close.
"So what's he doing? Why is he talking to Zabini."
They decide to apparate to the manor, rather than using the flu, so they start to walk outside of the protection charms cast on Grimmauld place and the surrounding streets, chatting as they walk.
"We miss you too, kiddo. We're always going to be here for you."
"Yay! Lets go!" He says, standing up and pulling Draco up by the arm. He looks at Harry, who is now gripping his book too because he kind of just wants to finish it.
"Hi." He says.
They make their way up to the dorm room and settle into bed, noses almost touching and legs tangled together.
"You look great too." Draco's eyes travel across every inch of his face before settling on his lips, and Harry gets the hint. He leans forward and closes the gap, pressing a soft kiss to Draco's lips.
"Alright you'll probably never hear me say this ever again but thank you, Harry." Blaise says and Harry frowns.
“What about you?” James asks Lily.
Hermione just smiles at him.
Hermione leans close to Harry and whispers "look at that. Your best friend and boyfriend are bonding." She smirks when Harry blushes, imagining what it would be like to be Draco's boyfriend.
"Same time next week?" Harry asks. He really enjoyed talking to someone about everything that has happened, especially someone that wasn't there.
"You okay, Potter?" Draco asks once he's stood next to him. Harry just shrugs.
"Pride and Prejudice."
Hermione grabs some coins from Harrys draw before smiling, saying bye and leaving the room.
"Are you feeling better though?" Draco asks as they make their way down the stairs when Harry stumbles slightly into Draco.
"It's okay. But if I have to watch you play the least you could do is not die." He says and Harry chuckles.
"I need to get going, but thanks for coming back with me." Harry says and Rhys grins.
"What makes you say that?" He asks, absentmindedly taking another bite of his pie.
and Harry wants nothing more than to hold him close and kiss him. Draco has become his safety blanket. His will to live. He's shared more with Draco than he has with Ron and Hermione. He's been vulnerable with Draco, and Draco has helped him. Harry moves his hand up and moves a piece of hair back, out of Dracos face, before resting his hand back on his side. Draco responds by shifting a leg so it's in between both of Harry's, tangling their legs together. He's still asleep so he's doing it unconsciously but it still makes Harry's heart flutter. Harry shifts closer to Draco, careful not to wake him, and rests their foreheads against each other again, letting the gentle sounds of Draco breathing finally lull him to sleep.
"Iris? I like it." He says and McGonagall smiles too.
Harry stands him on the floor and passes him his present. Teddy unwraps it and sees a toy broomstick, much like the one Sirius gave Harry on his first birthday. Teddy excitedly climbs on and starts riding it round the room whilst Harry watches him happily. The broom only hovers about a foot off the floor so if he was to fall off of it he would be fine, besides, the floor is covered in thick soft carpet so it's a soft landing. Harry sits on the floor, cross legged leaning against the front of the sofa, and watching Teddy fly around catching the snitch Dumbledore left Harry in his will.
"Yes, why, is something wrong?" Narcissa smiles sadly at him.
"I guess I'm lucky I don't need to tell my parents." He says sadly and Draco frowns at him.
"Goodnight, Kreacher."
"But surely we would have seen if a Gryffindor cursed?"
"Come on. I think Kreacher took your stuff straight up to my room." Harry feels a lot less stressed now, so he squeezes Draco's hand and lets him lead him up to his room.
When Draco looks up after about 10 seconds and his eyes meet Harrys again and Harry smiles and winks at him the hall goes silent. For around 3 seconds. Then Seamus and Dean and Hermione and Ron start clapping and within seconds the hall erupts in cheers and clapping and Harry sees Draco smile in relief and Harry can't help it. He climbs over the Gryffindor table and walks to the Slytherin table so he's stood where Draco is sat before leaning down and placing a kiss on his lips. He grins against Draco's lips when the cheering gets louder and pulls away slightly.
I started a uni degree that was meant to be part time and is actually full time so I've been doing that as well as a full time job, work has been so busy and so stressful, my mental health is at an all time low, my asthma is getting worse and worse, and I'm just all round having a bad time right now.
"Enough of that, Potter. We both know you don't call me Professor unless you think you're in trouble." She says with a knowing smile and Harry smiles a little more.
"I, er- whenever I think about something that happened, something that fucked me up, I write it down." Harry explains and Draco looks up at Harry before looking back down at the book.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Hey Winky, Is it okay if I eat in here again?"
"I was instructed by Mr Black and Mr Lupin. And because 21 is the age your parents were when they died." She says and Harrys eyes widen.
"You'll let the Slytherins in but not us?"
“It wasn’t. They didn’t.” He says, his eyes filling with tears and Draco grabs Harry’s hand with the one that’s not threading through his hair.
"What about?"
"There wasn't a doubt in my mind that you would be able to." He says and Draco fills with even more love for the boy in front of him. Merlin if his father could see him now he'd go ballistic.
Harry leads Draco over to the sofa. He really wants to tell Draco that the constellation and dragon tattoos are for him, hence the green dragon with silver eyes. Also Harry literally has the constellation Draco's named after, if he hasn't got the hint he doesn't know how much more obvious he can be. Draco and Harry sit opposite each other on the sofa, their legs crossed, and Harry takes Dracos left hand in his and holds it in his lap so his dark mark is facing up. Harry takes his wand, holding it how he holds a quill, and whispers incantations as he slowly draws a dragon over Dracos dark mark and heals as he goes. He also adds the magic that makes it move, but the more he think about Draco the more he interferes with the magic, and he links himself to Dracos tattoo. It doesn't affect the tattoo looks wise but the dragon on his forearm will react to Harrys touch more than other peoples and will react to Harrys emotions towards Draco. This means if he feels anything towards Draco, like if someone is being mean to him and Harry gets mad for him, the dragon will react, and if he shows too much emotion, such as love, for him, the dragon will react. When Harry's done drawing the dragon and colouring in it's eyes he adds a few flowers around it and whispers a final healing incantation before he holds Dracos arm up, so he can have a final look at it. He smiles proudly at his work and looks up at Draco, who is looking at the tattoo with such adoration.
They leave for herbology half an hour early so there aren't that many people in the corridor. Harry sees a couple of second year Hufflepuffs further down the corridor and smirks before turning to Draco.
"I know, but when you love someone you'll do anything to make them feel better. Like sitting in a dorm that isn't theirs and staying there because you're asleep on them and they know you need the sleep, even when your friend walks in and asks why they're there. Or visiting you every day in the hospital wing. Or threatening to curse your best friend because they're threatening someone you love. Or sitting on the rail of a bridge older than this school in the freezing cold." Ron says and Harry rests his head on Rons shoulder.
"Wanna talk about it?" Harry would say no but he's so tired and it's 4am. And Harry has missed Ron. He sees him as his brother, and things have been off for the past few months but he's missed him a lot and there's something about being on the edge of a high bridge at 4am in the cold with his first real best friend that makes him talk.
"How did you find out what I told him anyway? Surely he didn't tell you." She asks and Harry blushes slightly.
"She told us about how you redirected a curse." Blaise says softly.
"I don't think you understand how much you help me." Harry whispers, and Draco squeezes his hand slightly.
"So going back to the Gryffindor common room is off the table?"
"What for?"
"No." He answers honestly. Draco nods, he knew that anyway. He knew there was no way Harry got any sleep last night; he can tell by the look on his face.
"Everything."
"Sometimes?"
There's only 3 days until the Christmas break and he's scared, because yeah, he and Draco love each other and it's great and Draco is already talking about Harry visiting him or him visiting Harry, but Harry knows that will only be for a few days at most, and he's going to have to spend the rest of the holiday alone. Molly offered for him to stay at the Burrow, but Harry declined almost immediately. He loves her, and he loves the rest of the Weasley family, but Ginny is still mad at him, and he can't face Molly or Arthur without knowing he's the reason they lost a son. He can't face George without knowing he's the reason he lost his twin. He just can't. So he's going to spend Christmas at Grimmauld place with Kreacher, and he'll maybe get a letter from the Weasleys and he'll get a letter from Hagrid and maybe McGonagall and he'll read them a thousand times over to pretend he's not completely alone. So all in all Harry isn't looking forward to Christmas.
"What happened?"
"Well can you gallivant up to your dormitory?" She asks with a smirk, easily reacting to the banter with banter.
"Wow." He breathes, and he didn't mean to say that out loud but Draco blushes and Harry thinks he looks so damn fucking beautiful. He's wearing black trousers and a black shirt, but his jacket is dark green velvet and he looks absolutely incredible. "I mean-" Harry cuts himself off before shaking his head. "No that's right actually." He smiles slightly and Draco blushes darker.
"Shut up. Seriously..." Draco takes a deep breath. "Do you think your parents would like me?" Harry wasn't expecting it, and he can hear the nerves in his voice and he can't help but squeeze him tighter.
"I- I'll think about it. But, Professor I really don't think it's a good idea. I'm already the centre of everyone's attention and to be honest I just want them all to leave me alone." Harry mumbles.
"Yeah. Not too sure why but we were walking and then I told him I died and he said he's glad I came back." Harry says briefly and Hagrid smiles.
"Yeah, I don't think that would go well." He says as Hermione joins them and they leave the shop.
"Well yeah you but you've also been talking about how you would absolutely fuck him and how hot he is since you were 14." She chuckles and Draco blushes, glad the people near them are loud enough that they drown out their conversation.
"Fine, you?"
The two spend a while talking, Harry tells Ron everything about the pensive and the memories and him and Draco, skipping the details to spare Ron being scared for life, and their trip to hogsmeade and about Iris.
Draco realises after an hour that he should wake Harry up so they can sleep in an actual bed and not on the sofa. He leans closer to Harry and moves to his ear.
"Come back to the castle, man. It's almost dinner time and you need to drink some water or something." Rhys says and Harry shakes his head.
"What else happened?" Blaise asks, smirking.
"Being here." Draco can feel Harry's breath on his lips and he's so sincere and he so sad and Draco wants to hug him forever.
Also not to tease but boy the next chapter is so cute!!!
"There's so many things wrong with me Ron. I'm so messed up. I'm broken beyond repair, and I can't deal with it. He shouldn't have to. No one else should have to."
"You don't curse people when their back is turned." Draco says when he realises most people are looking at him in shocked confusion. Harry smirks at him knowingly and he sees Hermione smile when Draco blushes slightly.
"Well when I was teaching him to do a patronus he had trouble and said it's because he doesn't have any significantly happy memories. He told me about his childhood and so I told him about mine. When he still couldn't think of a happy memory I told him to think of a person and it worked and his patronus is a gray wolf." Harry says and Hermione smirks at him.
"That's hot, you know." Draco murmurs and Harry frowns.
"How ye bin?" Harry shrugs.
"If you don't want to talk, then that's fine. But, Potter, if you ever need anything, I'm here." She says and Harry nods.
They both fall asleep lying facing each other on Dracos bed shortly after, waking up hours later when Hermione comes in to get Harry for dinner. She walks in and sees them lying together and thanks God that she convinced Ron to meet them in the hall rather than come with her to get Harry. She almost doesn't want to wake them up because they look so sweet and content and happy. But she knows Harry needs to eat so she walks over to the side of the bed Harry is lying on and gently grabs his shoulder.
"I figured you'd want it." Draco says softly and Harry smiles slightly.
"You figured right." Harry says.
(See the end of the chapter for
"You know why. I don't eat much and Hermione likes to make sure I actually go to meals." He says and Draco watches as his hands run through Harry's hair.
Draco marvels at the beauty of Harry's magic. Teddy is watching in amazement and he looks how Draco feels.
"Maybe when we've finished this potion you can drink some." Blaise says, stirring it slowly. It turns from muddy green to vibrant green. Harry huffs a laugh at his attempt to cheer him up, and Blaise smiles slightly.
"You need to stay healthy, Potter. However I know your friends are always on your back, so I will not be. What about socially?"
"Fuck." Harry mutters as they leave the hall as quick as they can.
"Hey, Harry." Ginny calls as he enters the common room after his chat with McGonagall. Harry looks up and nods once in recognition before continuing to walk up to his dorm room. Ron is the only one there when he enters and Harry bites his lip as he walks over to his bed.
"Have you told anyone? About wha' ye went through?"
"About an hour ago." Malfoy says quietly and Harry hears Madam Pomfrey sigh.
"You're lying Draco." He says softly and Draco takes a deep breath. Harry is so close to him and he's topless and his muscles are perfect and how has he got such a great body even though it's covered in scars. Draco feels slightly lightheaded.
"So you got another tattoo." Draco states and Harry smiles slightly.
"Harry someone's gonna see." Draco says; they're in a secluded corner but someone could still see them.
Okay so I wasn't really sure how to end this tbh and I might change the end if I get a better idea but I didn't wanna drag this out any longer than necessary so I hope you like it :)
"I'll see you later Potter." He whispers before leaving the room. Harry takes a deep breath and grabs his bag before rushing to DADA.
"No, Ron! I don't know! You exclude me because I am still fucked up because of the war? Because I still miss the people we lost, the people that died because of me? Because I lost every single person that was even close to family I ever had? Because I have nightmares and flashbacks to when I actually died? Because I died during the war, Ron! But no one knows that! No one knows! You can't even fucking begin to know what I went through!" Harry shouts, finally snapping, as tears fall down his cheeks. He doesn't understand how everyone is so okay.
"I love you too." Harry places his hands on Draco's waist and slowly pulls him closer, pressing his chapped and bitten lips against Draco's soft ones in a sweet kiss neither of them thought would ever happen.
"Potter felt dizzy." Malfoy says simply and Ron stands in the doorway in silence for a few moments before frowning. Draco is expecting him to ask more questions or tell him to get out or tell him to leave Harry alone, so when Ron simply picks up a quill from the desk and walks back out of the room Draco is more than surprised. He looks back down at Harry, noticing his hand is still threading through his hair, and releases the breath he didn't realise he was holding.
"Yeah?" He asks, turning to the blond.
"So you think everyone's going to think we're perfect for each other?" Draco asks nervously and Harry nods.
(See the end of the chapter for
"You think I'm hot?" He asks and Harry laughs.
"Granger. Weasley." He greets, still blushing, and Harry smiles. He's glad Ron and Hermione aren't against him and Draco being together.
"Why'd you butter it then?"
"Fair enough. You have a point." Harry says and Draco looks at him, blushing even deeper.
"Finish this year, and the job is yours." She says, placing a hand on his shoulder and squeezing slightly.
The grounds are empty as they walk back to the castle so they hurry up to the common room before they get caught. The eighth years have a later curfew than the rest of the school but they'll still get questioned as to why they're wandering around together at 11pm.
"Who says we were making out?" Harry asks and Hermione rolls her eyes.
"Or it was tactical, Potter." Draco says, growling his last name just at the two girls walk past and he smirks when they start whispering.
"I knew it!" Seamus grins before stopping and looking thoughtful, watching Draco as he stands talking to Pansy.
"Hey Ron."
"Come on, Potter." He says and Harry sighs, standing up too.
"It smells good, Kreacher. Thank you." Harry was going to free Kreacher, after the war when he moved here, but Kreacher didn't want to leave the house, and Harry is kind of glad. They've formed a weird sort of friendship, and Harry is happy to have him. This does mean, however, that he has to eat, because he doesn't want to upset Kreacher. He's not too happy about that.
"Around middle of August. A few weeks after I moved out of the burrow." Harry says and Draco bites his lip.
"Hey." Ron says awkwardly, and Blaise, Draco and Pansy glance at Harry, who isn't meeting Rons gaze.
"Just finishing quidditch practice. But he's coming here after." Hermione says.
"Harry I know this is the least of your worries but you should eat. We have classes today." Hermione says and Harry sighs, the tears have stopped now and his eyes hurt.
"I'll go talk to him." She says and Draco raises an eyebrow in confusion.
"What happened? Why did he tell you?" She asks smiling slightly. It takes a lot to make Harry blush and Draco's managed it without even needing to be there.
"This is the night he ran away." Harry says, mostly to himself but also so Draco knows.
"It's okay. We missed you. How have you been?" She asks as they climb into a carriage. Harry just shrugs.
"Yeah. Ended up on the night bus and went to the leaky cauldron for the rest of the summer."
"You should smile more, it's a good look." Harry says and before he leaves Draco calls "right back at you." Making Harry blush.
"I mean, Draco is also technically meant to hate you." Draco blushes but shrugs.
"Thanks Mione. I'll go see him next weekend." Harry says and she nods.
"Didn't want him to curse you, did I." Harry says and Draco blushes.
"Thanks Mione, you're the best!" He says before he and Ron grab their brooms and make their way to the quidditch pitch. They change and make their way outside of the changing rooms and when the whole team is ready they start practicing. Harry loves flying, it makes him feel so free. He sees Teddy sat on Hermiones lap in the stands, smiling as Hermione points him out to the toddler and he watches Harry fly around. Practice lasts about an hour and a half before they decide to call it a day. As they're getting changed Katie Bell turns to Harry.
"You want me to bring you anything?" Harry shakes his head and watches as Draco gets up.
"Thought it would be a nice surprise. You should definitely try out for seeker though." Blaise says and Draco bites his lip as they sit down at their table.
"Way to ruin the moment." Draco grins.
"Your moans are amazing." Harry groans into Draco's ear and Draco blushes. Harry can tell he's close and he can feel Draco's erection throbbing against his lower stomach so he figures Draco is close too. He moves the hand on Dracos side to his dick and starts pumping and after a few minutes Draco is screaming out Harry's name and clenching around Harry as he shoots his load all over his chest and Harrys hand which sends him over the edge and he arrives inside Draco. Harrys vision goes blurry but he can see Draco and he looks fucking angelic. His eyes are shining so bright and he's shining with sweat and he's panting and he looks so blissful and happy and this is the most amazing he's ever looked.
"Of course." They make their way there and when the door appears and they enter the room it's a nice, cosy room. There's sofas and big armchairs facing a big grand fireplace and a coffee table and it's relaxing and calming and Harry thinks it's pretty much perfect.
"You need to stop feeling guilty, mate." Seamus says, wrapping his arm around Harry's shoulder. The boys never care about being close, probably because they're Gryffindors and don't care what other people think. Ron is always a bit weird about it but Seamus, Dean and Harry don't care.
"Any time." Harry smiles back.
"Mornin'."
“Oh my god.” Harry mutters, bringing a hand up to his mouth, suddenly feeling like he’s about to throw up. Dracos eyes widen too.
I'm trying, I promise <3
"Surprised they let you."
"I'll see you then." Harry shakes Michael's hand before he leaves.
"All I need to do is make sure people hear me saying someone's name in a 'totally whispered and secretive' conversation, so I'm gonna go recruit Hermione." Harry says before winking at Draco and leaving the dorm room.
"Nothing I just didn't like the way that woman was looking at you." Harry says and Draco looks past Harry before looking back at him.
Harry collapses onto the bench next to her, opposite Ron and Ginny, and sighs, resting his head on his arms, which are crossed on the table. Being center of attention is tiring, but avoiding being center of attention is exhausting.
"I meant it though." Draco says sincerely just as Narcissa appears to let them know it's time to go.
"Just really don't want to fuck it up." Harry whispers before smiling slightly at Draco, lifting their hands and kissing Dracos before turning back to the door, trying to steady his racing heart as Draco opens the door and leads Harry into the room. Narcissa is sat in an armchair by the fire, reading a book that she seems completely focused on.
"Harry! How you feeling?" Blaise steadies him before looking him over. When he's satisfied that Harry seems okay he looks him in the eyes again.
"C'mon Potter, he's had a thing for you for ages. Blaise said when you practised together it was ridiculously obvious." Draco is pouting again by the end of it and Harry grins.
"How ya doing, Georgie?" Harry asks, wrapping his arms around George tightly. After the war him and George really bonded, especially as he was staying at the burrow for the first half of the summer. They were both broken and Harry was pretty much suicidal. George was the one that helped him.
"It's okay." Harry stands the guitar up against the wall next to him and shuffles into the corner of the windowsill, crossing his legs.
"Yeah, I like it in here." Harry says as Draco tries to stifle a yawn. "You wanna take a nap?" Harry asks softly and Draco bites his lip before shrugging and lying down with his head resting on Harry's lap.
"Common room?" Ron asks and Harry shakes his head.
"Harry finish your water." Madam Pomfrey says and Harry sighs, sitting up slightly so he can drink. The water cools him slightly and when he finishes it and lies back down Draco frowns at him.
Okay firstly this fic passed 10K reads that is INSANE! Secondly this chapter is so cute and don't you deny it <3 Hope you enjoyed :)
Draco's worried about Harry.
"No. No buts. Harry you are top of all of your classes and you are eating again, albeit reluctantly, and you accepted McGonagalls offer of a therapist, and you're talking to people. Granted it's mainly McGonagall, Pomfrey and a few Slytherins but Harry we're proud of you." Remus says and Harry looks at him with watery eyes.
Lily appears in the front room, a baby bump showing now, and sits next to James, who grabs her hand in his right and places his left on the bump.
"Well that depends what time they were walking down the corridor." Harry smirks.
"I miss you." He whispers before dropping the stone into his pocket and watching as the people disappear. He wipes his face on his shirt before taking a deep breath and starting to walk back to the castle. He wanders aimlessly around the castle before sighing and making his way to the quad. He sits on the wall, leaning against one of the arches with his feet up and knees bent, and pulls out his book. He's gone through 5 of McGonagalls in the past few weeks, and he's now back to pride and prejudice. He still has no idea where it came from, and whoever gave it to him has not yet asked for it back. He opens it and scans through it again. He only read it once, and he didn't look at the pages for a clue as to who the book belongs to. There is nothing in the book that gives away where it came from, apart from small neat writing on the title page in the top right corner that reads
"How many people did you fuck before me?" He asks, figuring he can find out about George this way.
"Yep."
"I'll survive."
"Oh I'm the stubborn one?" He asks, annoyed, getting off the table and walking over to Draco.
"What's up? Where you going?" Blaise asks, ready to stand up in case Harry gets dizzy.
"Where did you go? I was worried sick!" Hermione asks in that motherly tone that reminds Harry so much of Mrs Weasley.
"Nah, I think I'll make you find out with everyone else." Harry says, catching Dracos eye who shrugs, telling Harry he doesn't mind if a few more people find out now.
"Where is he?"
"Draco, dear, please use proper sentences." Draco huffs because he knows that she knows what he's trying to say, she's just going to make him say it.
"Nice view." He says, still looking out over the mountains.
"Not being funny mate, but what the fuck happened?" Harry asks as he walks over to Ron, making sure he's in between the Slytherins and the Gryffindors when he releases the spell. One of the slytherins casts a spell at Harry, which hits him in the back but doesn't do much damage, and Harry turns around, looking royally pissed off.
“Harry it’s time for- are you okay?” Hermione asks and Harry shakes his head.
"What have you done?" Draco mutters and Blaise chuckles.
"Well I've seen a type of blush you haven't, Parkinson." Harry smirks and Draco blushes harder.
He puts his essay in his bag along with his text book before standing up and looking round at the books on the shelves. He starts browsing books on astronomy, not only because he has the class Sunday night, but also because he likes the subject. He likes knowing that there are things that are so far away and so beautiful and it makes his worries and problems seem so insignificant, for a second, at least. He wanders round a corner, his gaze fixed on reading the spines of the books, and finally finds the one he was looking for when he feels someones gaze on him. He turns around and sees Malfoy and Zabini sat at a table, both of them watching him carefully. Harry turns back to the bookcase and picks up the book before walking back to his table, but he for some reason can't stop thinking of Malfoy and his fucking face and the fact that he had a faint blush on his cheeks which means he was probably talking about Harry, even if Harry didn't hear him. Harry felt slightly self conscious under their gaze. He's only wearing slim fit joggers and a tight t-shirt, whereas Malfoy is wearing a shirt and trousers and looking like a fucking model. Zabini isn't exactly dressed like a mess either. Harry knows he has a good body, and this t-shirt isn't exactly hiding it, but he still feels under dressed.
"How do you know I'm gonna say yes?" He asks and Harry smirks.
"Hello, Dw- Dwa-" Teddy tries. He looks at Harry and Harry smiles, nodding encouragingly and he looks back at Malfoy.
"Of course." Draco says to McGonagall, who smiles slightly at the two of them before turning and walking down the hall.
"Really? Why?" Draco asks and Hermione smiles slightly.
"Why?"
"Do you want to reconsider my offer of dreamless sleep?"
"Enough now." He says and Harry rolls his eyes.
"Why you sat on your ones?" He asks, sitting on the same section of the wall as Harry so his thigh is pressed against Harrys knee.
"What kind of run in?" She asks concerned and Draco knows the concern is for Harry. He explains what happened and what was said and, when he mentions what Harry said about Hermione, instead of getting upset like Draco thought she would she just smiles.
"But why bring you and Malfoy into it?" Harry asks, annoyed with her, just as the Gargoyle springs into motion and Malfoy and McGonagall exit the doorway.
Now though, now he can lie with Draco at night, and he can walk around with their fingers linked like a constant pinky promise, and he can't pretend he hates him anymore, but he also knows Draco doesn't hate him either, and that makes it so much harder to pretend he isn't in love with him. Every second they spend together makes Harry's heart ache because it becomes more and more normal, and Harry can't let this become his normal, even though he knows it's far too late to back out now.
"You going to be okay?" Harry nods, trying to offer him a quick smile.
"Sure you're ready captain? You don't need more practice?" He asks jokingly and Harry rolls his eyes and shoves his shoulder lightly.
"Okay." He says, looking back down at the quidditch book. Harry looks at Hermione and she just shrugs so he looks back at Ron.
"What time is it?" He asks, voice deeper than usual and laced with sleep. Draco feels his heart stutter.
"Dude we are gonna kick Ravenclaws ass tomorrow, don't worry." Ron says and Harry smiles slightly because Ron is always so good at hyping up a quidditch match.
"Really?" Draco asks in an impressed yet shocked tone.
"Listen I know you're mad at us and that's understandable but we miss you Harry, and we're worried about you." He says and Harry pulls his arm out of Seamus' grip.
"Yeah please. I know people know I have it but I don't really want them to know what it is and stuff." Harry says and she nods in understanding. When they're changed Harry and Ron take their brooms back to their dorms and Harry goes to find Hermione who said she'd wait in the library. He walks in and finds her in the back corner sitting with Malfoy. This is an interesting turn of events.
"I'm not really hungry, Winky."
"Guess I gotta go, Potter." He says, standing up and grabbing his bag, not rolling his shirt sleeve back down but rolling his other up and Harry grins.
"I was jus' thinkin'." He whispers, staring deep into Dracos eyes.
It's huge.
"Anytime, 'arry."
"Hey Harry. Malfoy." Ron smiles at Harry, then nods at Draco, and Harry realises they should probably just tell him now.
"Why?"
"You ever think about leaving?"
"If 13 year old me knew what was going on now he'd probably die of shock." He says at Draco's questioning glance and Draco laughs.
"I don't know." He sighs. "We'll think of something." Draco nods.
"It's a map of the school. It shows where every single person that is at school or on school grounds is every second of every day." Harry says, proud of his dad and his friends for making it.
"You okay?" He asks softly and Harry shrugs, walking towards him and falling into a hug.
"Well none of them are actually going to kill him." Pansy adds.
"But seriously, Draco. If you're worried about him, he should come here, or you should go there." Draco nods.
"Are you sure?"
"You sure you're okay with this?" He asks and Harry nods.
"You smell like Draco." He says and Draco tilts his head up so he can look Harry in the eyes.
"I've not given up. I'm doing my work, Professor, I just- It's hard to focus." Harry says quietly and McGonagall nods.
Love you all loads <3
"I wasn't sure I was going to be until last night." Harry mumbles, lying slightly because he knew 2 days ago, and Rons face softens slightly, probably because this is the most he's heard Harry say since the war.
"Were you looking at the Gryffindors or were you looking at mister Potter?" The boys pause. As soon as Harry raised his wand they both turned to look at him, surprised that Harry was going to fight his friends.
"No rude remarks or anything?" She asks in disbelief.
"Winky, would you be so kind as to get Harry some lunch? And then make sure he eats it. He doesn't have to eat it all, just as much as he can."  Winky agrees and McGonagall nods, satisfied, before leaving. Harry sits and eats half of the soup he's given before thanking Winky and leaving the kitchen, intending on going straight to herbology, despite being 10 minutes early. However as he walks past the entrance to greenhouse 2 a hand grabs his arm and pulls him into it. Harry frowns and looks up to see Seamus.
"What you said last night. How I'm a part of your life. How you're definitely a part of mine now. Have been for the past 7 years, really." Harry's voice is laced with sleep and his eyes are focused on Dracos and Draco is smiling slightly. "I need you now. I rely on you. And I know that's not fair on you. I was thinkin' bout how we used to fight all the time, and now we don't, and I like that." Harry sighs, his eyes running over Dracos face before returning to his eyes. "You look so peaceful when you're asleep, and you're so vulnerable, but then so am I." Draco is kind of lost for words, but it's okay because Harry isn't done. "I-I'm scared." Draco frowns as Harry's hand grips the back of his shirt gently.
"I need to get ready but I'm not letting you get away with this." Harry says before climbing out of bed and putting his quidditch robes on. He runs his hands through his hair a few times before pulling on his shoes.
"Draco, dear, I have listened to you talk about Harry Potter for 7 years. I have been preparing myself for this moment since then." She jokes, and Draco smiles.
"Harry? Where you going?" Ron asks, his voice slurred with sleep, and Harry looks over to see him leaning up in bed.
"I still can't look at them, but I also don't want to talk to them. I don't really want to talk to anyone."
"I don't want to start a fight in the middle of the Zabini home, so I'm just going to warn you." Harry tugs on Brandon's hand, getting in his space, "I think it would do you well to remember that I can do no wrong in the eyes of the ministry, so if you make Draco feel uncomfortable or upset again I will kill you." Harry growls, voice low, and Brandon pulls his hand out of Harry's grip, nods slightly.
"Me too."
Draco stirs and he opens his eyes to look at harry and he smiles slightly before frowning.
"Yeah?" Draco hesitates for a second, wondering if maybe he's going too far.
"That doesn't mean anything." Harry says and Hermione rolls her eyes.
"Everything."
"McGonagall won't let me."
“Oh my god. Harry I’m so sorry.” She whispers and he wraps his arms around her, burying his face in her hair.
"Yes?" He asks slowly before frowning. "Where's the book?"
"Go where?"
"You're welcome." Harry stops sketching after that and goes back to trying to listen to Professor McGonagall.
"I mean... we could easily just stay here?"
"And are there other motives for your blooming friendship with Mr. Zabini?" McGonagall asks with a knowing smirk and Harry frowns.
"Do you want everyone to know it's you?" Harry asks and Draco shrugs.
"Hi, Harry." A first year boy says with a bright smile as Harry leads Draco over to the sofa by the fire.
"I wasn't going to hand you over. I wanted you to win." Draco says and Harry smiles and moves slightly so he can kiss Draco's forehead. He decides not to talk more about how fucked up both of their lives have been, so instead he presses his forehead against Draco's and takes a deep breath in.
"I didn't want to." He adds and McGonagall smiles sadly.
"Oh... Why?" She frowns and Ron realises that someone who has publicly hated Draco for years coming to find him in the middle of the night looks a bit suspicious.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Okay team, lets go." Harry says, slightly dreading it but he knows it will build his teams spirit and it's a good bonding experience and all that. The team walk to Hogsmeade together, chatting about whatever, and when they get to the the ice cream parlour they grab a table in the corner. Harry sits in the very corner, next to Will and opposite Rhys. He joins in the conversation as much as he can, so not much, and he eats ice cream and avoids Ginny's gaze as he listens to his team. They're bonding and getting along well and Harry is glad he has such a good team and his chest fills with pride. They talk about strategy for their first game in a few weeks and they make jokes and at 2 Harry realises he needs to start making his way back to Hogwarts. Most of the team want to stay in Hogsmeade, but Rhys says he'll walk Harry back because 'we can't leave the captain alone and vulnerable, one of the other teams might kidnap and torture him to get our game plan!'
"Is that why I have to stay here?"
"I have something that may help him. I was instructed, by Mr Black and Mr Lupin, to wait until his 21st birthday. However I feel that he should have them now." She says before sending her patronus to go and get Harry.
"Well, should you want to, I would love to take you on as either a DADA or Quidditch teacher." McGonagall says and Harrys eyes widen.
"Are you okay?" Harry nods, turning back to his essay, and Draco resists the urge to roll his eyes. "Harry?" His voice is soft and Harry knows he can tell he's lying. Harry sighs, putting his quill down and sitting back in his chair, resting his head on Draco's shoulder. Draco threads their fingers together and Harry lifts their hands to press a kiss against Draco's knuckles.
"Morning, Potter." He says quietly and Harry looks at him for a second, not expecting him to talk to him.
"When I first learnt how to produce one I used the memory of when I found out I could leave my Aunt and Uncle. Then it was Sirius; I found out I had a godfather and wouldn't need to go back to the Dursleys; I finally had a good family. That didn't last long. After he died it took me a while to be able to cast a Patronus again. During the war, when I was walking to the forest, I had the resurrection stone, and I saw my parents and Sirius and Remus. They spoke to me, and they've been my happy memory since." Harry says and Draco smiles slightly at the reminiscent look in Harry's eyes.
"Is that really what you think of me?" He asks, his voice small.
Also thank you for all the love you are giving me on this and my other fics, it means a lot and it makes me feel warm and mushy inside <3
"Oh, I told Ron." Harry says and Hermione rolls her eyes.
"So what happened to you yesterday?" Blaise asks once everyone has started brewing and Harry pauses mid stir.
"It was amazing." He says and Blaise frowns suddenly.
"Can what?" He asks, voice just as soft.
"Yeah." He says and Harry grins, grabbing his chin softly and turning Draco's face to look at him before pecking him softly on the lips.
"During the war when I went to the forest to see Voldemort, he killed me. I died, and no one knew until today." Harry says and Blaise's eyes widen.
So I'm not sure how many chapters this will be or how long it will be between each chapter is posted, I was going to wait until I had at least a couple ready before I started posting it but if I don't post the first chapter soon it will be deleted and who has time for that honestly, not me :') Anyway I hope you like this fic and I'm sorry if it takes me a while to update, I'm nearly 20 years old and I'm v v busy <3
Draco watches Harry cautiously, knowing he's zoned out and wanting to make sure he's not going to have a breakdown in the middle of class. Harry looks over at him after a minute or two and Draco mouths 'you okay?' to him and Harry nods, smiling slightly but not looking that genuine. Draco raises an eyebrow and Harry sighs before looking back over at Professor McGonagall.
"I don't know what you mean..."
"Harry forgave you, you know. He knew you didn't have a choice. When I asked him why he was going to testify for you he said that both you and your mother saved his life, and that it wasn't your fault. He couldn't bare to see innocent people spend their life in Azkaban like his godfather had to." She says and Malfoy looks intrigued and is about to say something else when a voice they both know well is heard.
"I think so." He says nervously.
"I'm proud of you." Draco says and Harry grins, walking over to Draco and wrapping his arms around him.
"Thank you, Harry." Seamus says and Harry sighs.
"Yes but he's also the boy who lived."
"No, I need to write an essay for Study of Ancient Runes." She says, bidding them farewell before walking off towards the library.
His session with Michael today was mainly about the past week. Harry tells Michael about how he doesn't see the point, how he can't sleep, doesn't feel like eating.
"Why'd you pick that song?" Draco whispers and Harry's eyes dart between Dracos eyes.
"Oh yeah. I wonder why they didn't tell me about her."
"Granger?" Draco asks quietly as he sits on the other end of the sofa. She looks up and smiles slightly.
"For what?"
"Why are you rushing?" He asks, and Draco's mind immediately goes to Harry in their dorm. How long has he been gone? What if Harry has fallen asleep again and is having a nightmare? What if he decided he didn't want to stay in the dorm and has gone back to his own. He definitely wont sleep in his own dorm. Not unless Draco is there.
"Hey, I think that's a good shout. He's gonna love it." Harry says as he stops next to Draco.
"What about these?" He asks and Draco walks over to the two Gryffindors and looks at the table.
"Okay... Why?" Ron sighs.
"What?" He asks, concerned for a second before he sees the look on her face and realised she just caught that interaction.
"You standing there for a reason Draco?" Hermione asks and Draco blushes slightly before sitting on his bed and Hermione laughs.
"Thank you professor." He says and she smiles at the both of them before walking up the stairs to her sleeping quarters.
"We're going to head back to the common room. You wanna come?" She asks and he shrugs, nodding.
"Laugh it off." Draco's voice is so soft and Harry's heart flutters.
Blaise has Quidditch practice after potions so Harry leaves the class with Malfoy. They're walking in a comfortable silence, Harry feeling lightheaded for some reason and Draco is walking next to him, staying alert just in case Harry collapses. Harry isn't sure where they're going and he's certain that Malfoy doesn't know either, they're just walking side by side. Harry gets a weird prickly feeling in the back of his neck and pauses slightly. He knows this feeling, and it worries him. Draco stops next to him and frowns. He's about to ask what's wrong when Harry's eyes widen and he pushes Draco to the side just as a spell shoots past him, narrowly avoiding Harry. Harry spins around with a dark look clouding his face and he casts expelliarmus silently at the fifth year behind them before taking in a shaky breath. The fifth year runs off down the hall and Harry reaches out and grabs Draco's arm to keep himself steady.
"Not if I love you too." Draco whispers, his grip on Harry's arm tightening again, and Harry looks at him carefully, as if reading him, and after a few moments he releases a breath he didn't know he was holding.
"Yeah, I know." Harry says before sighing, pausing for a second and moving so he's lying on Draco's lap again. The scene is exactly the same as it was earlier, except they both have exceptionally messy hair, not that Harry's hair is much different, and their lips are slightly swollen. Dracos hand immediately threads through Harrys hair when he rests his head in his lap again and Harry sighs in content, lying with his eyes closed.
"Wasn't it just." He agrees before he catches Weasleys eye and he immediately stops smiling before turning back to look at Professor Sprout.
"Even people that didn't make the team loved it. They said it was better than any quidditch lesson they've had." Ginny says and, as if on cue, a fifth year, Jane Campbell, walks over.
"You sure me going is a good idea?" Draco nods before shrugging.
The next day after lunch Hermione, Teddy and Harry make their way to the entrance hall to meet Andromeda, Teddy gripping Harrys hand as if he's scared to let go. Andromeda arrives and Teddy runs to her and hugs her before Andromeda hugs Harry, thanking him for looking after Teddy and talking to Draco for a few minutes.
"Honestly Pansy the things you come up with. How on earth am I supposed to talk to Potter? We hate each other." Draco says and Pansy chuckles.
Little life update though: I’m still sick which sucks but I managed to get the Shane Dawson pallets and lipsticks and I am so excited about it
"What happy memory do you use?" He asks curiously, not wanting to ask any questions because there's a scared look on Harrys face and Draco can tell Harry is still pretty much traumatised by his childhood.
Harry sees pain on Dracos face and immediately freezes.
"He's coming to the Zabini Christmas party." Draco says with a small smile because he knows it's probably a bad idea but it made Harry smile so it's got to be worth it.
"Really?" Draco nods.
"It's your birthday soon, buddy." Harry says softly and Teddy nods.
"They vary. There are a few from Petunia, and some from the other members of the order. Or specific, special moments your parents, Mr Lupin and Mr Black wanted you to see." McGonagall says and Harry nods, not wanting to speak because he feels like he'll start crying.
"Without a doubt." He mutters back before smiling. "I can't believe I produced a corporeal patronus." He says in disbelief as he turns to look at Harry, who is looking at the wolf proudly.
"I'll see you later, Blaise."
"No, you really blew up your aunt?" Draco chuckles and Harry nods, smiling slightly.
"Which part?" He asks.
"Harry... I'm so sorry." He says and Harry frowns.
"Potter." Draco says in recognition before looking back at his book.
Harry walks up to the common room and looks around, not knowing what to do. Seamus and Dean are sat on the sofa by the fire and when Seamus sees Harry he opens his arms. Harry walks over, drops his bag on the coffee table, and collapses onto the sofa. Seamus shifts so he's lying down and Harry lies next to him, neither of them saying a word. Dean rolls his eyes but lies on the other side of Harry, him and Seamus wrapping Harry up in a hug with him buried in between them.
"Thanks Seamus." Harry smiles, not looking away from the Professor.
"Yes, this is another secret passageway. This is my favorite one though, because my dad and his friends used to use this one all the time. We're in the shrieking shack. No it's not haunted, but I'll tell you that story later too." He says and Draco looks at him with so many different emotions on his face and Harry smiles.
"I will force that down your throat." He says and Harry breaths a laugh when Billy shouts "ooh kinky."
"Draco what's up?" Harry asks, genuinely concerned that he's having some sort of stroke or something. When Draco stays silent Harry moves his hand to rest on Dracos leg, figuring it's something he doesn't want to say or talk about.
"That's good, yeah? And why would he have that mental image?" Draco asks, blushing slightly.
"He's meant to be with Andromeda, what's he doing here? Is she okay?" He asks as Teddy's hands grip his shirt and he stands on his lap to look at Hermione.
“No, we were waiting for you.” James says as Sirius sits next to him.
"Where's your broom?"
"I wasn't going to." Harry says, voice quiet and wobbly as a tear falls from his eye. Draco reaches over and wipes it away.
"I told Draco I love him." He says simply, eyes on Draco, and Draco blushes darker and he can't stop looking into Harry's eyes and he can't stop the grin that spreads across his face, and Blaise grins wider.
Harry puts his book on the bedside table and motions for Draco to sit next to him. Draco bites his lip nervously before he sits down and Harry rests his head in Draco's lap. He does this with everyone, apart from Ron, because it's comforting and they always end up playing with his hair which he loves. Sure enough Dracos fingers immediately start threading through his hair. Harry is now lying on his back and his right arm is thrown over his stomach. He stays silent and Draco frowns down at him.
