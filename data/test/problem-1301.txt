“Well” Harry smirked weakly and licked his lips. “The attention has always been on me, no matter what I do. And I’ve known for a while that I was gay, but never really had an idea of how to tell the public and even if I should. So when that situation happened, I just decided to… take on the responsibility of being the public’s attention. I usually am and that way Wilson had at least the possibility to go and hide somewhere.”
“Hey Charlie! How’s it going?”
Madam Pomfrey rushed towards them and Draco told her his suspicions, which were quickly confirmed by a different spell. No more long parchments! Draco was really glad he no longer needed to read all these bad things his relatives did to him.
Narrowing his eyes, Potter suddenly seemed to realise about what she might have talked to him. “Oh, shit, I am so sorry. Listen, she’s very protective of me...” he rolled his eyes. “Sometimes she behaves as if she was my mother.”
“I’ll try to remember that.” Harry managed a genuine smile as they entered the Hospital Wing.
And while he felt rather good today and he was sure to live twenty more years at least, he was also aware that he had good days, even weeks. And then it usually crashed down on him and he couldn’t even move one muscle. So the fact that he was doing so well today must be scaring Ginny a little. Luna had always been more optimistic, though she once told him that she hoped he wasn’t going to die.
Goodbye from jolly_love
“I know, you already answered it in your surprised ‘What? No!’-call” Zabini smirked. “So how can I help you?”
A snowball hit Harry in the middle of the face, throwing him to the ground. Bewildered, Harry brushed the snow out of his face, before he looked up, seeing Malfoy doubling over with laughter. He was wearing a very nice fitting black coat with a deeply red colored scarf around his neck. His hair was slightly tamed, though a strain of hair was loosely falling into his face which made him look even better. More human if Harry had to be honest.
Chuckling, Draco entangled himself from the Gryffindor and got a pout and some almost desperate puppy eyes which nearly made him weak enough to head back to bed. However, he was strong and went to take a shower. From the bedroom, he heard Harry groaning and then what seemed, him getting up as well.
“Of course” Draco winked at him. “If anybody asks me out right whether or not we’re dating, I’d tell them that firstly, hell had to open up and the devil himself had to threaten me. Otherwise, I’d never want to be in the same room as you, alone.”
Draco shook his head, disapprovingly. What was this Gryffindor thinking?! “You know, they’re more potent, right? They could just be killing you faster! Black market potions are rarely good for anyone.”
An eerie silence suddenly took up all the space and Draco frowned at Potter, who didn’t seem to notice what he had just said. Pansy frowned as well, looking at the badly drawn picture, though for some reason, after Potter had said it was a Thestral, you could actually see it.
“Absolutely not! Harry, I thought I’d never get to see you again!” Pansy grinned, while Potter laughed. Draco frowned and watched them closely. Since when were Pansy and Potter so buddy-buddy? No, they seemed more – almost friends?
His ward turned to Granger again and was now grinning broadly. “Hally Potty!”
“You drive a hard bargain, Harry” Draco smirked. “I accept your conditions.”
While Harry was racing towards the shower, Draco made a quick walk towards the kitchen. There was always some elf awake sometimes even three or then. And they had always been nice to him whenever he had walked in there to get something to drink – mostly hot chocolate. Draco was sure that his ward could use something like that today.
Pansy chuckled. “These are all the pictures of the Christmas banquet you took. Those are of everybody” Pansy pointed to the left pile, while Draco frowned at her.
“Why?” Theodore asked and frowned as he looked over to his wife, who was in a rather heated discussion at the girl’s table.
“Don’t trust what he says” Alamar whispered and winked at Harry. “He’s got a personal trunk full of my letters and he keeps re-reading them almost every other day.” His laughter was so warm and clearly in love.
“Oh, I’m not kidding, Weasel!” Nott shrugged his shoulders with a smirk on his lips.
“I think you’re losing touch with reality, Draco” Harry said and he was clearly trying his hardest to bite back his laughter, though he was close to breaking. And that was Draco’s goal right now.
Before he could say something, McGonagall sighed, as she turned to the two of them. “Gentlemen, is there not one single meal where we can have some peace between you two. I
He wasn’t even half done with the booklet, when Harry stormed in with sparkling eyes, bringing so much cold and even wetter snow into their home, while he laughed. Eric wasn’t far behind though he was packed with stuff they bought.
While Potter kept laughing, Draco slid from the bar and walked to the nearest table, sitting down at it. The barkeeper joined him rather quickly and beamed at him. “Thank you so much. I don’t know what I would have done without you!”
“Pansy, if you ever decide to kill them, I will either give you an alibi or help you. Depending on what you need” Draco said darkly, staring at the two new points on the parchment. How did they not go to the healer after something like that?! Even if it was a clean break, it still hurt like hell!
“You want to eat an apple?”
Madam Pomfrey had said that at the end of the week he was going to have his memories back from his eleventh birthday. They had met that day... And he had probably made the worst impression ever. He had been a snob all throughout Hogwarts and he had hated Harry so much...
Graeme turned to the parchment and an assistant took it and fully immersed the document into the potion. Draco frowned slightly and even more, when he took it out and there was his name…
Harry snickered and shook his head. “Shrink it down, guys! We’re wizards! You look like Muggles who have no idea what’s going on!”
The Savior giggled and hugged the teddy bear again. Sighing, Draco got up again, looking over the quiet Common Room. “I know people think you’re cute, but you definitely are not!” he said looking away from Potter, who was now beaming at him again. Why was Potter being such an annoyingly happy baby?! Draco knew that he was going to have to work hard on keeping his marks up to his own standard. Potter was nothing more than an inconvenience.
Harry nodded and added another sentence, which made Draco feel slightly uncomfortable. “But he likes Mama Penguin a lot and he’s always nice and helping her!”
Hermione widened her eyes and looked at Draco “Blood adoption on babies? That has to hurt!”
“We’re going to celebrate the future wedding now already!” Molly said.
Grinning, Harry rolled his eyes. “Good! That’s all I wanted. To be one of the idiots.”
Harry frowned. What did they talk about? Draco’s eyes, his pure love, his sex drive…
Room of Requirement. NOW!
“Copy that.” Harry beamed and already decided to give Pansy the estate as a birthday present. Ever since it was clear that she wouldn’t get it, she had been incredibly destroyed. And now... everything seemed perfect.
“I do not believe that for a second, but let’s pretend I do” Harry winked at him and cleared his throat. “Anyway, thank you.”
Jason grinned at him and took out a small invitation. “Sunday, the thirteenth. Any plans for then?”
Their customer grinned at both of them and closed the door silently again. “So jumpy, both of you. Keep calm, it’s only your favourite customer” Draco said smirking. “It’s like I’ve just caught you making out. Which I know is impossible.”
“Draco, stop pressuring yourself into this... role you’ve been playing for the past seven years” Ginny said while rolling her eyes. “The war’s over, Hogwarts wants to be open for everyone and every house. So, we absolutely do not care that you’re in Slytherin
Draco smirked. “I know; that’s why I’ve asked Theo and Ze to look after baby Potter!”
“Oh no, angel, no, go to your dad!” Draco said and smiled down at her. “I’m almost finished here.”
Harry grabbed the sweet apple tea and poured the boiling water over it. “It’s too personal. With any other client, I can just be myself, but with him, I… I don’t know. I don’t think I could stay neutral. I don’t want to judge him based on what I think of him.”
As if to prove his point, Potter’s eyes widened and he grinned. “Thit!”
Nodding, Harry grabbed his husband’s hand and they headed back into the castle, Padfoot walking happily after them. Each of them had their own thoughts: Harry was thinking about that animal farm Madam Pomfrey had said and he was sure that Draco in his head was trying to figure out if he wanted to take up the free Healer’s position once Madam Pomfrey was gone or if he just wanted to continue their random adventures in the Muggle and Wizarding world. And well, Padfoot was probably thinking about food or what the smell by the stair was… or maybe he tried to figure out how to take over the world while being stuck in a body of a dog.
Severus nodded, taking a thoughtful sip. “He’s got a strong soul.”
Harry frowned and shook his head. “No. Dray, why haven’t you told me what I did to you? That scar is not from fighting some soldier! I did that to you! How can you ask me to forgive you, when it’s me who has to ask for forgiveness!?”
“Harry, you also need to settle some day, you know? Find someone?” Hermione interrupted him and she had almost the same expression that Ron had.
First names it was then. “I’m a little confused that my last meeting isn’t going to be with Harry.” He walked into the room, while Maria returned to her desk.
Grinning, Harry shrugged his shoulders. “Hm, and why exactly do you know that?”
Harry almost spoke about ‘Draco being a prick’, though swallowed that comment and grinned at his best friend. Neville seemed to have read his mind as he smirked quickly, before he too looked at Ron.
Draco pulled the satchel over his head and left the room as well, motioning his ward to follow him, which he did. The three men slowly made their way back to the official elevators in the Ministry. They weren't slow because they deliberately walked slow; it was because Potter wanted to see everything that was to see on their way.
Not only Harry had lost track of time, since Draco honestly couldn’t tell when he had entered the library and when he had left it again. For all he knew, he could have spent five years inside that tiny room. Though once again, he should have felt hungry, if he really just spent five years inside that room. Unless of course, there were some magical blockers around it – Draco decided to check for magical blockers as soon as he could. Who knew what the Blacks had placed around the library!
She looked up with raised eyebrows. “Alright, that’s it!” Even though it seemed harsh, her wide grin showed that she actually wasn’t as mad as she sounded. “Get down here, right now!”
Without a word, she passed the parchment to him and he read it through, growing even whiter with every line he read.
There are still a few countries that might change their mind: Switzerland is still on the verge of choosing either side. It might be best to leave while it’s still open and Italy has seen a more relaxed approach to the creature laws. For now, Italy might be the next country to open the borders. We’ll keep informing you if anything changes.
Pansy wasn’t talking, as she stormed into the room and hugged Harry, who was only half a head shorter than she was. Both beamed at each other and Draco started to chuckle.
Harry chuckled as he dodged Blaise’s joke attack. “How could you! I should scream for help, Madam Pomfrey would come running!”
“It’s almost nine o’clock, Benjamin. I do need to get up” Potter remarked and tried to get out of bed. Draco grabbed him and imprisoned him in his hug. The Gryffindor fell back in his bed, laughing. He seemed so happy and it somehow made Draco happy as well. And he weirdly felt safe right here right now. The Gryffindor placed a soft kiss on Draco’s temple. “Let me go, please.”
“I guess you need to think about what you’ve just realised” Potter told him and grabbed his glass, walking up the stairs. “Lock the door and turn the lights off, once you’re done.”
Harry nodded softly. “I’m going for a little walk along the Forbidden Forest. Care to join me?”
Finally, he saw a narrow but high house which was had the name
Wordlessly, Draco placed baby Potter inside and looked at Severus, not really sure what to believe anymore. Severus seemed so natural with baby Potter even though he had clearly hated him when they were in school (or rather a little younger than now).
Harry frowned. “What’s going on with a brothel?”
Harry checked the time and apparently decided to get up, but Draco held him down and climbed on top of him, laying his head down on his chest. Chuckling, Harry put his arms around him. “It’s probably Connor, Draco. I need to open the door, otherwise he’s just going to continue knocking.”
As if this hadn’t been enough, Harry had apparently decided to add insult to injury: “At least Draco listens to me when I tell him I have a nightmare and I want someone to talk me through it.”
Pansy had narrowed her eyes and her expression had become harder and harder the longer Draco was talking and now she looked as if she could murder them all. Actually, that was how he felt as well.
Whoever is now Magical Guardian of my son shall receive the content inside vault 372. There should be enough gold inside to give our son everything he’ll need until he’s reached the end of Hogwarts and he can get himself a job and earn his own money.
Eric rolled his eyes, knowing very well that Alamar was absolutely not going to waste any food. He grabbed the almost empty watering pot and poured it out over the grass when he walked to the other end of the garden to pour some water in.
He seemed rather amused by their discussion. “Well, I mean if I won the lottery I’d buy Manor and rebuilt it into either a day school for children with magical parents or I’d turn it into an animal friendly environment for people who go on holiday and don’t want to leave their animals home alone. I haven’t decided yet.” He shrugged his shoulders and grinned.
Frowning slightly, Draco turned it into a smirk and shrugged his shoulders. “I’ll take that as a compliment. Thanks, Weasley.”
Neville nodded and squeezed his shoulders, before he walked into the castle. Blaise smiled at him and held up his hands. “I promise not to tell anything about your relationship to Pansy. I’ll make it sound as if believe you were going through a divorce.”
Nodding, she sighed. “He doesn’t know me. I’ve been keeping an eye on little Harry Potter. And I was very surprised to see him in this very house, enjoying himself.”
Draco woke up fairly early and found himself entangled in Potter’s embrace in the Saviour’s bed. It smelled like cinnamon and apples. He was suddenly highly awake and tried to remember what happened the other night.
“What, with words?” Harry chuckled. “That only ever seemed to work for you, Malfoy. And I did visit a mind healer for the last year of Auror training, so I hope I won’t kill you during this mission if you start attacking me with words again.”
These nights were safe from surprises. Surprises like the Dark Lord arriving at the Manor, trying to convince him to join his fucked up spiel of power and fear, and safe from anyone even trying to get close to him. He didn’t like the sound of thunder as much as the next person, but he knew what it meant: safety.
Seamus shook his head. “Does that mean we could actually know your… wife?”
A huge smile came across his face, as he recognized him. “Draco Malfoy! By Sal’zar, yoo’ve groon quite a bit! Ah min' th' day ye first cam intae mah stair! Ye waur sae wee!”
“Not the point.” Pansy said it so quietly that Draco had to listen very closely.
The worker had apparently also seen the owl and he shook his head. “Oh no; we have other barn owls as well. He’s a little on edge. We saved him from a rather traumatic owl breeder. He still has to recover from what they did to him. Over here we have…”
Harry rolled his eyes. Out of the corner of his eyes, he saw Draco getting up and walking around the table. Their eyes met and his husband winked at him, before he bent over the table to look at a map that Blaise had rolled out onto it. While they were talking more and trying to do whatever, Harry felt a few more eyes on him.
Before they could say more, there was movement to their left and Harry turned to see Bill standing there, his hands at his hips as he raised his eyebrows. Draco looked at him as well, which made the redhead shake his head.
Harry chuckled and shook his head. “In that case, maybe I shouldn’t have put you, Padma and Pansy into the same room, huh?”
Draco chuckled. “Thank you, bear.” He wanted to add something else, when Harry interrupted him rather quickly.
Smirking, Potter answered quickly. “You know I can’t say no. How long do you want to work? Since it’s your holiday, you should enjoy a few free days, right?”
Hermione smiled down at her daughter and nodded. “We’re running out of family names for girls. Molly only had boys except for Ginny and when we were pregnant I had to promise her not to use ‘Ginevra’ for our first born.”
Before he could ask what he should do about it, Madam Pomfrey, already started talking. “Don’t worry, Mr. Malfoy, I’ve already cured it. For us, it’s nothing special; we can just heal it like that.”
Weasley shrugged his shoulders and pressed his lips together, before answering.
The Slytherin seemed to inspect him, though didn’t say a thing. Harry got up and dragged himself to a kitchen cabinet. He opened it and grabbed the dragon leather bound booklet inside. Back at the table, he placed it in front of Draco.
By this time, Hermione turned back to Draco, somehow happy that Harry had left them. And probably also that he was otherwise preoccupied. “So, what did you do to his relatives?” she asked.
Your teapot
Draco was quiet for a while, but sensing King’s eagerness to finally end this uncomfortable call, he simply answered with: “Thank you very much for the opportunity, Sir.” He would have liked to add a ‘Can I think about it’ at the end, but wisely chose to bid goodbye instead.
“No worries” McGonagall answered. “The surprise I had for everyone had been a team jeopardy game in their houses. Unsurprisingly, Ravenclaw won.”
“Really?” Longbottom pretended to be very surprised, which made Harry actually snort, while he giggled. Draco was sure he had realized that he could make the other Gryffindor laugh with whatever they were doing. “I thought the dungeons were a few thousand years behind our capacity!”
“Good morning!” Neville said, grabbing their Kneazel and placing him on his lap, as he sat down by the table. Merlin looked curiously onto what was present to him so closely, though Neville expertly kept him away from getting anything.
That seemed to be proof, since Draco caught a very interested squirrel hopping on top of the wall, following them closely. Smirking over this animal, Draco turned back to Harry, who placed a flower on top of his parent’s grave.
Harry rolled his eyes, though he didn’t trust his emotions enough to look over at Draco. Ever since the couple’s therapy, their dynamic had changed ever so slightly. Harry couldn’t believe that his husband was okay with stepping back from their years of arguing – sometimes even dirty discussions.
All that commotion brought their youngest daughter Sophie out of her room and she quickly followed her older siblings. Even though Caellum was double her age, these two also liked to do a lot together.
“I’m just thinking of the next five horrendous days upon us” Harry answered and sighed. Draco grabbed his hand and pulled him onto the sofa, where the Slytherin then sat down next to him. Their silver rings lit up for a second.
“There’s something else to doing this hidden away from everyone” Harry said while he was catching his breath again.
Draco nodded. So he needed to go to two classes with baby Potter. He was really hoping that his nemesis wasn’t going to act up in there.
Teddy looked at him, incredibly confused as if he had thought there were only three people present, including him. And so he stared at Draco for a while, clearly thinking and chewing his fingers, when he lit up. “Ecco!”
The only person slightly out of his comfort zone was Weasley, who just sat there, staring at Potter wide-eyed, as if he wasn’t sure whether he was dreaming or not.
“How do you know?”
Alamar snorted and shook his head. “Stop calling us ‘young’ would be a good start?”
“Not sure yet. Severus wants me to go into a new potion’s project. But I think enjoying life should be rather high on my list as well.”
Love, Hermione
His best friend crossed her arms. “Okay. So it’s time to teach him how to read I guess.”
“Maybe you should be nicer to people, you never know who you’re talking to” Draco said calmly, while he continued to eat.
our house color, but this just looks as if you’re still looking for Hercules.”
“I don’t know what you’re referring to, but this is your wand, Draco. I totally forgot about it and I’m sorry. But maybe you want it back now?” Harry seemed a little flustered, probably because he was really sorry for having forgotten it or because he was just too tired for it all.
Draco turned to look and found Hermione and Pansy along with Theodore in what seemed to be heated discussion, Neville trying to shush his girlfriend playfully and Ron leaning over a book with Blaise, where they seemed to be talking about a topic rather sternly. Millicent for now hadn’t decided which group she wanted to be part of.
In fact, he actually just started to realize what was going to happen in the next few months… He would be needing this booklet very much, he was sure of it.
Silence. Both were just drinking their hot chocolates and Harry was clearly trying not to look at Draco. However, he knew that with time and patience, his ward be manage to gain enough energy to tell him what was going on in his mind.
A malicious smile crossed Draco’s lips and he winked at her. “I was waiting for a moment like this, where I could play all of you.” He turned to Harry and kissed his cheek. “Except you of course.”
Hermione smirked. “You clearly don’t remember our first year, Draco. I was an insufferable know-it-all. I still kind of am, but I’m trying to better myself. In first year, I was way too focused on not being expelled; I believed it to be worse than dying.”
Draco shrugged his shoulder, closing his eyes and started breathing calmly. It was as if he was about to fall asleep again. “It’s four a.m. What kind of tosser is awake that early?!”
There was a giggle around the Common Room and Draco shook his head.  It was nearly midnight! “Why is he still awake, Theodore? Pansy!”
“I hate this family” Pansy commented, when she had look at the parchment. “At least they can no longer hurt him!” Draco silently agreed, while Madam Pomfrey started healing his broken bone and finished up with Harry.
“Is there an age line?” Anthony asked, innocently.
James, who seemed to be more talkative, answered immediately. “School was daft. There’s this knew child, Tobias, and he thinks he’s better than us, because he’s originally from London!”
? You had a lawyer and everything.”
Malfoy looked at him from the corner of his eyes and shook his head. “Both of you are talking about things that shouldn’t interest you.”
“Well, yes, we were looking for Hufflepuff’s Cup. So… yeah.”
Harry laughed. “Got it. So I won’t tell you all my secrets.”
Potter tilted his head and squealed. “Thit!”
Harry shrugged his shoulders. “I sold it to Ministry. It still has some of the strongest wards around it and I mean Dumbledore basically made it a safe house for the Order. So now, the Head Auror has decided to keep it a safe house for undercover Aurors. I think Sirius would have been okay with it. And that was the only thing that could get me out of the Auror program. I told them I’d take the house back if they wouldn’t let me and Neville leave.” Harry smirked. “Of course, I couldn’t do that, because I already used all the money they gave me to buy this apartment. But they were scared and actually let us go without any problems.”
Harry sighed. He knew his friends were right. In all honesty, he had just wanted to protect his childhood friend – however, her actions hadn’t been right. Even if she didn’t know about the effect of that potion, she should have asked her husband or any pureblood for help.
Kind regards,
“Anything I can help you with?” Draco asked and presented them with a bored look. He wasn’t bored at all. In fact, inside he was trembling. Granger had always scared him slightly. Weasley was easy to look through, but after she had punched him in third year, he had realized that he had absolutely no way of calculating her. And he hated it to his core.
Smiling weakly, Pansy sat down on the bed and shook her head. “No darling. But don’t you worry, I’ll be happy again.”
“Draco, hey! Sorry, I didn’t even look at the phone. How are you doing?”
Without much said, he cast a floating spell and hurried through the halls, Harry floating in tow until he reached the Hospital Wing.
Draco smirked when he looked at Harry. “And I think that just proves that you’re a Snake, Harry.”
chose to.”
No winners. Just survivors. He had survived a lot: The Injury Parchment was proof of that. But what did he experience while he was being hunted? This boy was such a strong fighter! Ever since he had seen the light of the world: parents killed when he wasn’t even two years old, abused by his relatives, fought throughout all the hardships happening at Hogwarts and ended up winning...
They made it through the door and he indeed found them all sitting there, laughing, talking and just doing something. Luckily, Draco knew that Ginny had offered to take a walk with Harry, so he was certainly entertained.
As Draco entered the Room of Requirement three days later, a sudden flashback overcame him and he saw fire everywhere. Smoke rushing towards the sky, fiery wings of monsters claiming all the living, breathing, not fire prove things. It only lasted until baby Potter put his arms around his neck and said something sounding like ‘dada’.
in the Ministry of Magic,
“I can see it.” She then pointed at Harry who was hiding his face in his hands, though his shoulders were a clear sign of laughter. “And Harry isn’t that good at hiding. Actually, he never was” she grinned, probably remembering the time where they played hide and seek and Harry kept giggling.
This earned Neville a bunch of laughter around the table and a very evil glance from no other than Ron. When he turned to his wife, for some back up, Hermione held up her hands and shook her head. “That is your own battle, hun. You need to accept that cooking isn’t your talent.”
“Good evening, Miss Parkinson!” She smiled and bowed slightly. “I am very glad we were finally able to find a day and time where we could meet! So, you must be Mr. Malfoy and this fine young gentleman is Mr. Potter?”
While they were talking, Granger kneeled next to Draco and after a suspicious look at him for a second, she turned to the child on his lap. “Hello there. I’m Hermione, that’s Ron” she pointed to the redhead, who waved halfheartedly. “What’s your name?”
When Madam Pomfrey came back and gave Harry some potions to take, Pansy sat down on the chair next to Harry again. Something had changed with Harry’s demeanor. Only when the mediwitch went back to write a few sentences on a parchment, he looked at Draco and it actually seemed sad.
On the way to her home, they walked by a building called ‘school’, that didn’t look any different than a normal house, a barber and hairdresser and a few normal houses. At the other end of the village, he could see Victor walking around his sheep and a brown dog keeping the animals in check.
Nodding silently, Harry concentrated on his shoes. He wasn’t ready to discuss what had happened. In fact, he wanted to forget all of it as fast as possible. Did the house maybe possess memory eliminating powers?
Blaise snorted and rolled his eyes, which matched Millicent’s expression exactly. Theodore was watching Potter intently, and Draco felt a little jealous once again, over how Pansy talked to Potter and gave him all her attention. Not that he wanted to be in his position, Pansy was his best friend, nothing more, but he seemed to be carefree and happy…
Draco sat up, wiping tears from his eyes and held his hands up in surrender. “I know, I know, Pans. Sorry about that. It’s just too precious.”
Harry narrowed his eyes. “Are you feeling like you’re shrinking or like bad memories are coming up?”
“Pansy wasn’t talking about Potter, to be honest” Theodore grinned as he placed he essay on his satchel. “And I have to say… I think everyone here’s right. Granger and Weasley shouldn’t  have waited this long to do something, if this would have happened to you, we would be destroying the Gryffindor Common Room and it’s not normal.”
Rolling his eyes, Harry smiled innocently. “I’ll tell you when my next date is so you can come see what a total disaster it turns into, when my date realizes I’m
“You’re not a gentleman, darling.”
“Wake up, Draco!”
Rolling his eyes, Harry let go and smirked. “It’s just us!”
McGonagall nodded. “I am just going to eat breakfast. The feast will be held for an additional thirty minutes. Make sure to get something to eat.” She passed them and Draco could see a smirk on her lips, which he was sure she didn’t actually want to let anybody see.
Draco shrugged his shoulders. “Not from my side, I can assure you that.”
They talked for a while about their families, before Harry finally went upstairs to pack his things and Eric went to help. Alamar stayed in the kitchen reading up on new creature laws in Europe, and the panic that was slowly settling in. This wasn’t a good time to be living close. Luckily, they were moving away as soon as they could.
Harry smiled weakly as he let the meat and sauce float over to the table. “Then you would have been stunned by my magic use before I got sick. I could do all kinds of things.”
Draco remained standing and read through all the boxes, before he shook his head and joined Harry. Kissing his earlobe, he whispered soft words. Harry leaned back and placed his arms around his neck.
scar. He quickly pulled the jumper higher, so it was hiding under the fabric again.
Sitting close to the fire, feeling the warmth, even though the coldness of the wind made him wanting to scream at the coming winter, he closed his eyes, listening to the thunder exploding, the wind making the waves roar and the rain shooting rocks at the castle as if it was some sort of twisted game. He had always liked these nights.
Finally, after a good two minutes, he pulled himself to his feet and walked to the kitchen, Draco right behind him. He opened a kitchen cabinet and grabbed a green glowing potion in an identical vial as the one he had given his former classmate.
He leaned in, kissing the former Gryffindor softly and felt Harry pulling him closer. In the end, he leaned his head against Harry’s chest and they silently watched time go by, eating strawberries and enjoying life, as the stars wandered over the night sky and the sun slowly changed the night into an unbelievably beautiful morning.
Harry groaned. “Fine! I’ll do it.” He sighed. “I’ll call him tomorrow. It’s a little late today and I have quite a few things on my plate right now.” For one, he also needed to get his planner back from Ron and meet him in the Leaky.
“I am your Magical Guardian and I can tell you to come down here!” Draco said, crossing his arms.
Draco felt his lips curl into a grin and shook his head. “Why three?”
“No” Harry responded and watched carefully, as Malfoy walked over to the hole in the floor. “That would mean it’s my mistake that we can’t get out. It can’t all be my mistake!”
“He wasn’t there.”
Harry looked over to his friend. “So, what do you want to do then, if not telling on us?”
“With Fred and George as your brothers, I don’t think that’s a good idea. I’d rather have Hermione as Head of House. At least then I know that the people actually learn something and aren’t just given free prank material.”
Draco rolled his eyes, but caught Pansy trying her hardest to hide the smile. “No, Potter, these are not
Draco stared at the page. His mother had been released? He felt jealousy bubble up to the surface as he looked at the writing. While she hadn’t officially been a Death Eater, she had also been in bed with them. The Dark Lord had trusted her very much, especially for a Non-Death Eater.
Later that day, Draco returned to the pub and was surprised to find a good number of people inside. The door to the kitchen was open as well and a middle aged woman dressed in shining yellow and with blowing brown hair, who had clearly seen the worst in life and accepted that life was unexplainable, walked out with three plates of food.
Harry smirked. She really was good – well, they were standing there hugging so closely. She surely must have also heard the
It shouldn’t be that, right? He should feel awesome, be proud of what he did. And now, even if they had caught some unimportant criminal, he really didn’t feel good. It was just another day, another criminal another day on the job. It was a job in which he wasn’t happy.
Malfoy rolled his eyes and glared at Nott. “It could be literally anybody, Theo.” He grabbed Harry and pulled him down into the basement. Ron followed almost immediately and Harry could hear Nott sigh, before he walked down the creaky stairs as well.
When he looked over to Draco, he saw his tired-out body and pulled him into a hug with his free arm. Draco just groaned tiredly and nodded. “I just want to go home and sleep, to be honest. The thing that just happened was a little bit too much for my brain.”
“Pansy Pandora Parkinson” Harry started, mocking her with the same tone she had used for him, when both Draco and Pansy widened her eyes in surprise. Before he could even continue mocking Pansy’s phrasing, she hushed them.
Draco wanted to get up and leave, but the damn Veritaserum kept him there – talking. Talking about things he would have never said out loud. “But I’m the worst person possible! I’ve scared Harry into thinking that he’s getting punished for nothing! I want to kill his relatives every time I read that fucked up parchment and I can’t even... I’m so dead inside, Severus! Caring for him makes me realize how much of an idiot I’ve been! I hate it all!”
Harry smiled softly. “Well, I noticed how uncomfortable you’ve been the whole day. And I’m sorry for making the beans explode all over you this early into the day.” He smiled softly, and continued speaking before his husband would – he already saw him opening his mouth. “So, I decided to make it up to you and clean your hair. To make sure that there’s no residue of beans or sauce in there.”
“Cookies?” Harry’s eyes widened and he grinned broadly.
Nora lay down next to the table, putting her head on her paws, but still watching him intently. She seemed glad that someone else was here who could help Harry. He could tell that she liked Draco as well, it took her usually a day or two to get used to strange people, though with the Slytherin, she seemed at ease almost immediately.
! I keep learning new things about Harry and wonder how he’s not more messed up.”
A ping in his phone made Draco frown and he looked at the screen, where Harry had sent a picture of himself sleeping. “You took a picture?!”
“Don’t worry, bear. It’s just something I need to figure out.”
1/10 (interrupted by Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore), without interruption: 7/10
Potter got even redder (if that was possible) and rolled his eyes. “If you tell anyone what you’ve seen I will kill you! And no one will ever find your body!”
“Absolutely! And I’m not just saying it because Blaise told me to.”
Well, probably not the latter, but he should tell him the rest. Before Draco could say anything, Potter kneeled behind him, pulling him back in a hug. He then sat down properly and Draco found himself sitting on Potter’s lap.
Hermione smirked. “I don’t think that’s true.” She accepted the tea Harry placed on the kitchen table and smiled at him. “Are you interested in coming over on Christmas? Or do you want to – again – spend it with this secret boyfriend of yours?”
Daphne grinned. “There must be other things, right Draco? He’s your husband; you should know a lot of things about him?”
Harry practically dragged Draco into their room, where Draco had left the parchment. While Draco quickly transfigured a cushion into an additional chair to be placed at the desk, Harry sat down on the already existing chair.
It took nearly a full minute, until the Hat spoke up. “
“Hasn’t so far” Nicolai shrugged his shoulders again. “So why would that happen right now?” He leaned forward and smiled at him. “I should thank you for doing this thing for me. And” he motioned towards him. “Keep up the good work.”
“No” Eric shook his head. “I need to figure this out.”
Blaise snorted and tried hiding his amusement by clearing his throat, after Pansy glared at him. “Maybe he’s good at being a baby, right?”
“Oh darling, you’ve tried to hex me a lot of times. Never really got me, though” Pansy answered, smirking and camera in place.
“Let me just tell you, that you need to hide this thing between the two of you a little more. There have already been a lot of theories from everyone” Pansy said and smirked, before she added: “Neville thinks you’re in a relationship.”
Chuckling, the blond wizard shook his head. “I’m earning money, Potter. As long as I’m getting money, I will be paying you for coffee and sweets.”
Draco looked up, luckily having ended the letter and found Potter standing next to him smiling. “Hi there, Harry. How are you doing?”
Madam Pomfrey accepted the parchment again and smiled at Draco. “I should congratulate you now, Mr. Malfoy. As it looks for now, he will be ageing faster. The next year will take two weeks and after that week by week. I would like for you to come by every week. This parchment is slightly alerting. Should there be other injuries it’s best to look at them and maybe heal them magically.”
Finally, he grinned at the Slytherin. “Now take your clothes off, Draco and get in!”
Draco chuckled and shrugged his shoulders. “We’ll never know. Actually, if I tell him that they were looking for him and ask what it means, he might tell us.”
Potter looked after the animal, waving again. “Bye bye!”
“Why does Aurora sleep in my room? I thought she belonged with you?” Harry asked and Alamar could make out a soft purring noise. He was sure that Harry was petting Aurora and that their Krimnee was probably already half asleep.
He rolled his eyes and still placed a kiss on his husband’s lips. “I hate you so much.”
Harry sighed. He rubbed his forehead and looked at Neville. “What happens if I’ll press charges?”
Lovegood chuckled. “All babies are. Additionally, I don’t think the Wrackspurts in the dungeons are very good for him.”
Harry grinned, whistling for Padfoot who came running. “See you next week” he said, before Draco apparated them back to Hogwarts. This evening had been a nice ending to this crazy week. There should be nothing else happening.
Weaslette grinned. “None taken, Malfoy. Ron said they were going to see Harry and I wanted to see him as well.”
Seamus shook his head. “No. But I’m not going to let you go swimming by yourself, so I’ll follow.”
“And what am I then?” Draco asked and smirked. “Am I not real?” He touched his arm and pretended to be looking at himself, while little Harry actually showed a ghost of a smile. “Do you think I’m a ghost?” Draco asked, touching his arm again.
“Well, this stupid class reunion thing is going to end tomorrow. I wouldn’t mind coming by in the afternoon. Does that work for… you?” Harry offered, grinning over how bad this call must sound to the two Slytherins in the Common Room.
He was then surprised by a door opening and walked out of the room to find Draco standing there. “Hey.” Harry smiled and walked towards the blond man.
However, at the same time, Harry got up as well. “Do not
Draco shook his head. “Merlin, I wonder how Harry’s not completely lost his mind.”
Ginny smirked. “Let’s just say it’s been a few years since I’ve seen you naked.”
A voice made him open his eyes and he gasped for air. Turning his head, he found Harry sitting on his bed, leaning over him and looking very concerned. “Draco, love, nobody’s going to hurt you” he said calmly, running his fingers through his hair to bring him down from this terrible nightmare.
He saw how Harry’s eyes grew big and he shook his head. “I went in front of a bunch of people to save you? Even before you were my Magical Guardian?”
Draco groaned and shook his head. How was he supposed to deal with Potter and his own personal problems, while studying for his N.E.W.T.s?! Potter had already been an inconvenience when he wasn’t a baby and now that he was… His life couldn’t get worse.
Harry smirked, though decided not to say anything. She was probably right. In fact, when Draco looked up and smiled at him, he was aware of the sudden changes in his expression – going even softer and his eyes… so soft, so full of love. Harry knew he was safe, whenever Draco looked at him that way. There was no way on earth he would let anything happen to him.
“One more guest, guys. Only one more.” Blaise grinned, but stopped dead in his tracks as soon as he had set one foot inside their home. He stared at everything wide eyed, as if he wasn’t able to believe what he was seeing here. “You
Draco could tell that Potter hated both times he was there. Not that Draco was complaining, because every time his ex would walk in, Potter turned all his attention to Draco.
“Sure” Draco answered and glanced at Harry.
“What’s going on in this story?”
“Okay.” Draco frowned and motioned outside, where he just saw a very familiar man. “Then what is Father doing here?”
“Apples?” Draco smirked. “But you’ve been eating apples for the past few days… How about pumpkin?”
“Nice!” Malfoy got up and walked towards the two still arguing wizards. Nott had apparently promised Ron to give him another huge black eye to match his look of being depressed, which Ron did not appreciate whatsoever. Malfoy laughed and shook his head. “Darlings, calm down. Theo, do you have the list of what’s inside?”
Draco widened his eyes. He gaped his mouth, as if he wasn’t sure what to say. Finally, he leaned back and shook his head. “Shit. I’m sorry to hear that.”
Next to the bakery, there was a just as small butchery. The second he walked by, Mrs Williams left the shop and Draco offered to carry the meat to her home. She agreed thankfully and compared him to Potter, with his gentleman manners.
“Yes, sir” Harry grinned, capturing his husband’s lips in a tender kiss again, before he left the room for a quick shower. After that, he decided to take a back-route to the apparition spot. The last thing he wanted was to be seen by a smug Hermione who didn’t realize her mistake yet. Actually, maybe he wanted to be in the room when she figured out what kind of mistake she made.
Hermione frowned and followed his gaze, sighing. “Well, Draco, You’re doing
I hast been privy that thou hast turned aroint from me. What didst I doth to deserve this, except love thou moe than I belike should'st hast? Thou decided to stand by the magical marriage contract and not by thy known. I wot thou still love me. Hence, I am writing thou this 'i hopes thou might reconsider. I wot it might only be 'i vain, alas, it is mine last hope. Prithee, allow us to meet one moe time - only once. Thou are
It was quiet for a while, where everyone watched the TV. There were three police officers arriving and making some quite inappropriate jokes over the victims they had found in that house.
Harry saw the Slytherin hiding a smirk. He was terrible at it. “Harry, I am pretty sure your friend feels as if he’s the reason you’re in this situation. Weasley won’t just accept that your life now sucks and he’s got his wife, children and happily ever after.”
Nott nodded and smirked. “The house by the lake. Aurors have been trying to get inside and find out what’s inside for a few centuries by now, but nobody seemed to have success with it. So for some very unknown reason, they tasked us four with the mission of getting inside and figuring out what it is and whose it is. And also, if it is in fact harmful, to eliminate it.”
For quite a while, nobody was speaking, as they simply enjoyed their drinks. In the middle of the night. It was rather strange, but also weirdly comforting. Before Draco finished his drink, Severus started to speak again.
(See the end of the chapter for
He hadn’t been alone for even two hours, when the door to the office opened again. This time however, Harry hadn’t really heard it. He was still studying a profile which could match one of the other customers and whistling to the new Christmas song on the radio.
“Did you just… Did you just wink at a baby?” Draco asked and shook his head.
Theodore nodded. “Tell us everything you can find out! I want to know it all! Poor baby Potter!”
King apparently wasn’t done talking. “In fact, I have given you a lot of freedoms being an Auror Trainee. Once you’re back in London, you will be on desk duty until I can trust you again.”
As he opened the door towards the Room of Requirement, he heard Potter laugh and when Draco looked inside, the Gryffindor was running around with something in his arms that Weaslette was trying to get back, though she clearly was pretending not to be able to get it.
Draco sighed. “I didn’t train him, guys.”
When Draco walked towards his favorite little bakery in one of the back alleys, he stopped suddenly. A very familiar looking head of hair had taken his attention. Harry Potter was in this store?! Before he turned on his heels and walked back to his own office, Draco stopped in the middle of this action. His eyes darted over the Gryffindor again and he wet his lips.
Finally, the lunch rush seemed to be over and Harry fell into a chair, groaning. “Why on earth did I think it was a good idea to open up a coffee shop?! Why didn’t you stop me?”
“Let me show you something, Harry. I’ve found the potion’s laboratory.”
Frowning, Ron looked after her as she left the room again. “How does she even know the password?”
Hermione frowned. “I haven’t heard from any of them in the last few years, do you know anything?”
“Finally!” he groaned and cleaned his robes from any dust. Ron followed out of the basement and took off the Auror robe and shook it out.
Weirdly enough, Hermione started to chuckle and shook her head. “Well, at least we have
William stood up tall and glared at the Aurors. “I am not the one ign'ring nature, thee mushrump chasing daws! Thee bethink me weak and sick for mine own way of living, though I am the strongest wizard of thee all!” And with that, he threw the quill like a dart at the Auror. It actually penetrated the secure wall the Aurors had built up. William turned around even before he was able to see what damage his had made and exploded the building.
“Well, you found me, bear. How can I help you?”
Harry had been quiet since the beginning; however, before Draco could once again say that this thing was absolutely stupid, he finally spoke up. “I’ll do it.” It sounded so determined that Draco's blood froze.
“Pounds” Harry corrected and Draco saw him trying to hold back a grin, though he only barely managed. “Go on.” He walked closer and sat down between Pansy and Draco, when the latter put his arm around his boyfriend and smiled at him.
Malfoy snorted and opened another door on the opposite end of the hallway, far away from the other Aurors. “Potter, it’s not surprising you had no idea. They tried to get around their feelings by hating each other.” He smirked. “We all know that can’t last long.”
Widening his eyes, Harry shook his head. “No. What…” he frowned. “You just changed tones so fast, I’m not able to follow. And also: what makes you think I’m supposed to help him? He made my Hogwarts years some of my worst years of my life.”
“If you continue this, I might not want you in my bed tonight. So you can go snuggle Pansy” Harry raised his eyebrows at Draco who snorted. He walked closer to him, placing his other hand around Harry and pulling him into an even closer hug.
Harry nodded as well. “Stay strong like a bamboo in the wind.”
Hermione shook her head, though there was a smile on her face. “The best thing in my opinion is to figure out what you’ve got in common. Then, you can work with that and include it into your date somehow?”
Groaning, Harry fell through the door of the Room of Requirement. Everything looked cozy, though he didn’t care one bit. His body tried to make him turn around, walk away from this hiding place. It took everything in his power not to let that feeling dominate.
“I’m really sorry for what they made you do” Malfoy said and shook his head. “Theo can be a real nitwit when he doesn’t get what he wants. Not that this excuses his shitty behavior.”
“A lion” Pansy giggled.
His friends and his ward followed quickly and they made it to the Great Hall in almost record time. Harry was extremely happy and he sprinted in front of them, which made Blaise start running after him trying to outdo him and then Pansy and in the end they all ran up the stairs.
Nymphadora went through the same thing, so should you have any questions, I’ll make sure to have her answer them for you. In short: The Patronus realizes love and protection and changes to the stronger Patronus. We both know Harry once chased away quite a lot of Dementors with his, so it was natural for yours to adapt.
Draco laughed as he turned to his best friend. “Don’t you have another date to go to, Pans?”
Draco snorted. “Just ‘oh’? Good reaction, Golden Boy.” He wanted to get up from the couch, when Harry held him back.
Harry smiled softly. “That’s nice. I guess the child would be happy to have a stay at home dad.”
“I can’t wait.” He kissed Draco and pulled him into a hug. “I love you.” And with that he just left, as if he was afraid what Draco had to say about that.
“Why thank you, love. I think we can agree that we both are rather amazing at playing our class mates, though I am honestly not sure how we could top this tomorrow.”
“Yes.” Eric was the one to answer. He grabbed an arrow and sat down, cleaning the metal tip. “We’ve spent enough time here and it’s time Harry gets out of that home and away from Dumbledore’s influences.”
From the looks of it, he was about to do exactly that. “I believe, you’ve heard about Ian?” Draco nodded silently, so that Aaron could continue talking. “Well, pardon my French, but he was a total shitbag. Ian came here looking for somebody to keep him company while he was out here, doing God knows what.” He rolled his eyes and sighed. “Sirius has an open heart for everyone. So Ian decided to get a roof over his head, by using him. He fell head over heels in love with him.”
Draco felt hot tears trailing down his face and he turned to his side, grabbing on tight to Harry and starting to cry. Harry helped him into a sitting position and after climbing over him and leaning against the wall; he pulled him on his laps.
Hermione frowned slightly. “Around eleven o’clock. Since we’re in eighth year we can stay as long as we want” she added while shrugging her shoulders.
“Talk to me, Draco.”
“Good morning Remus, you seem to have had a nice night” Draco smirked and Remus sighed, shaking his head.
Speaking of… “Hey Harry” Draco walked across the room to where Harry sat down in their favorite secret location. “Hermione told me to give a message.”
“It’s okay, Harry. It’s going to be fine. I’m here for you, bear!”
slept until 11am, I’m awake since seven.”
“That kind of magic can hurt pregnant women” Draco explained and grinned, before he shrugged his shoulders. “I gave them all a good scare, love. Once we’re back home, I’ll certainly have to show you.”
Harry had made it to the door safely, when the ceiling opened up and thousands upon thousands of different colored rose pedals floated down towards the ground. It made Harry happy to see Vanessa holding her breath and Henry in complete awe, as well as all the attention away from the Minister.
“You have?” Harry asked and chuckled. “I was mostly working in the Muggle World.”
“I don’t know, honestly. I just think it’s time for something new.”
Draco Malfoy agreed and rolled his eyes. “It’s almost as if they want to scare us into fearing for our lives, since most Slytherins hadn’t felt extreme fear during the war.”
“Okay?” Draco narrowed his eyes. “And what do you want him to do with this information?”
The Slytherin chuckled. “I always thought you’d write a book, though I never guessed it was something like this. It’s rather depressing.”
He then turned to Draco. “Thank you, Draco. Really. Your only job was to look after me and you did so much more! I feel as if I had a happy childhood, even though I
“Let’s hope so.” Minerva agreed, though she didn’t sound sincere. Albus nodded and cursed himself over the fact that he thought he could trust her.
“Well, there were some weird things going on, before your parents died, you know?” Alamar said and smiled weakly. “And the rumour is that all of this was staged by him. So, we wanted to save you from being used your whole life.”
“Why did he die?” Harry asked.
Ron widened his eyes. “That… I…” he shook his head. “It’s not the same.”
Harry grinned. “It makes me wonder how many other people might be wandering the halls then.”
Frowning, Draco inspected Harry. He said it as if it was just an information of who had called in the afternoon and not the fact that this deadly curse was seriously messing with his head. It also looked as if this wasn’t really affecting him. Or at least, not anymore.
Draco almost succeeded in hiding a grin, which Weaslette actually detected and narrowed her eyes at him. She didn’t say anything else, though. Simply put her hand into the air and grinned again a second later. “Just stating the obvious, mum! I’ll be in the kitchen, making salad or something.”
If you intent on travelling to any of the aforementioned countries or you are staying there, please stay hidden and don’t move. Creature rescue boats are travelling up and down the shore of France and Spain to bring you to Portugal, however, do not intent to do anything hasty. Creature allies warned of reckless behavior, as Thomas Opal said in his creature press conference: “The best thing we can do is what we’ve always done. Hide and wait for the storm to pass. There is only so much build up a storm can have.”
“Mada… What?” Draco frowned at his ward and grinned shortly after. “Who told you about this place?”
“I’ll try” Toby answered and they stopped the call.
And the last name was the head of the Black family tree, the person who seemingly started this whole family of dark wizards – Thormund Vance Black. His name was so well readable, so impeccably kept, Draco narrowed his eyes at it. Something had to happen around it.
Chuckling, Harry placed a kiss on his forehead and hummed. “That’s good, love. You know you can always come to me if you had a nightmare, right?”
Harry chuckled and shrugged his shoulders. “She still has a collection of nice teacups and one time when we went shopping I told her to ‘come along teacup’, since she was looking at more of them and she decided to call me ‘teapot’ then. That’s how it happened.”
“Right.”
This time, Draco couldn’t contain his laughter and he shook his head. “Um… we’re not naming strawberry cakes, bear.”
belongs to you? They have the best books ever!”
Looking up, Draco found a trio of Gryffindors coming closer. Neville was leading the pack, as if he had replaced Harry in being the Golden Trio’s leader, and grinned when he found Pansy.
” he was by now really calm and almost seemed as if he had come to peace with what he was saying. However, it sounded also dangerously close to an actual explosion, “that Sirius died.”
Harry shrugged his shoulders. “Always have been and always will be. Comes with the title, I assume.”
While he came back to the couch, he held it towards Draco. “I’m not sure why Michael sent it to us, maybe he doesn’t like Pansy. But you can have it. They have a 99% success rate.”
His godfather sighed. “I’ve just visited the headmistress and she would like me to tell you that Potter’s friends believe you’re keeping him from them on purpose. They want to request some time where they could be around him as well.”
“No” the Slytherin rolled his eyes. He walked closer and raised his eyebrows. Harry stood with his back basically against the stone walls and in front of him was his husband, looking so intrigued. He could smell the vanilla scent so clearly, it was enough to mess with his head. “You know which one” Draco whispered and breathed heavily.
“Do we need to discuss this now?” Harry answered and tilted his head. “I’d rather go to bed, sleeping in your arms until the house elves come to wake us like the old days.”
The two Slytherins made their way up the stairs while Daphne and Draco helped them – mostly Pansy with everything she needed. And that only left the Gryffindors, Hannah and Susan at the table full of food.
The form of a Patronus may change during the course of a witch or wizard’s life. Instances have been known of the form of the Patronus transforming due to bereavement, falling in love or profound shifts in a person’s character. Some witches and wizards may be unable to produce a Patronus at all until they have undergone some kind of psychic shock.
Potter shook his head. “Not as of lately, no.”
“Harry, bear, wake up!”
The other Gryffindor groaned, clearly not happy that Ron either didn’t read everything or just wasn’t getting it. “They wanted to make the people stop the testing, Ron. Read the second part again,
“Harry!” Hermione called and basically jumped around his neck. Harry had just had enough time to put his arms around her and counter the sudden attack to not fall over. Through the bushy hair of his friend, he saw her husband enter and barely hold it together.
“How do you know my full name?!” She shook her head, clearly confused and surprised. “I’ve only told Draco, my middle name is absolutely stupid and I hate my parents for having given me two names starting with a P when my last name also starts with a P!”
“Is it easier?” Pansy asked, before she sighed and rephrased what she meant. “Does it ever get… normal?”
Draco simply shook his head. “That wasn’t a compliment.”
“Still nothing, no.”
Draco bit his tongue, clearly intrigued by the winery, but knowing that Benjamin would never ever drink wine, he ordered the beer Victor had offered him. Potter placed it in front of him, while he explained where it was from. “Preston Ward” he pointed to the young man playing billiard with two women. Just this moment, he started laughing loudly and showed off his muscles. However, the orange shirt he was wearing did nothing for his looks, “he crafts his own beer and it’s rather good.”
Time seemed to stop, while Draco tried to process this new information. “You’re kidding right? This is all just an elaborate prank of some sorts and…”
Smirking, Draco pulled away and sat up. “Do you want to have another go at me?”
“I should have known.”
“It’s a good way to start over. People need to drink, I can meet new people – normal people – and I keep hiding in plain sight.” Potter said very impartial, apparently not wanting to argue over something he seemed to enjoy.
Draco glared at him, though it didn’t have any impact, as Harry snorted. Shaking his head, Draco shoved him to the side and rolled his eyes.
And so, Harry snuck up into his room and grabbed everything he needed as quietly as possible, even placing a silencing charm around him just in case something would fall. Luckily, Neville and Ron were still asleep as he closed the door and walked back down into the Common Room.
Harry smiled. “Yes, of course. I have been thinking about what we’ve talked about.” He stopped and looked at the floor, making sure this really was what he had wanted to do. Finally, he looked up again and nodded. “I think I want to accept the opportunity of taking over Hogwarts, Prof… Minerva. I just need to discuss this further with… my wife.” Shit, why did he have to lie to her?!
Smirking, Draco shook his head. “Not really. Exploding Snap is a game I’ve never really liked.”
“Bring him here?” Albus offered and smiled again. He needed to have full control over the little war hero. Only then could he fulfil his goal of taking over the Wizarding World and finally chase these stupid creatures out of Great Britain and eventually destroy them all. Especially the north with all the fairies fighting was a huge thorn in his side. “I believe some creature has kidnapped him.” Albus pointed at the parchment nodded, while Severus weakly copied his actions.
Shaking his head, though still smiling fondly at his ward, they made their way towards McGonagall’s office, where they would be using her fire place to go directly to Remus’. In his letter, he had written that they were going to inspect the house James Potter had left them and that if everything worked, they would be moving there even before Christmas had come. Most of Teddy’s things were already there and so Remus’ suggested they'd meet there.
by using magic. These relatives should be thrown into Azkaban or whatever the Muggle version was of it. No, actually, Draco wanted them in Azkaban. At least when the Dementors had still been around: They would have sucked the souls out of their bodies. If they even possessed one. No person would do something like that if they had a soul.
Before he could say more, Draco interrupted him: “I really don’t want to be that person… But I need to speak to your boss.”
“I guess that’s a compliment?” Harry smirked leaning at his door.
It was quiet for a moment, until Hermione cleared her throat. “Why did you do that?”
They walked to the department and were rather quickly seen by Minister Graeme, the official for blood adoption. He led them into a dark room with all walls being painted in black and no windows. When he closed the door, the candles on the walls flickered due to the sudden gust of wind. Three old looking chairs stood on the other side of the table, where Graeme sat down and motioned them to sit.
He was brought back to reality a few minutes later, when Pansy sat down next to him again and nodded, as if to say that Blaise was okay with their plan. Draco smiled gratefully.
“I’d like to ask your opinion on something as well, actually” Neville said and he smiled sheepishly. “Professor Sprout wants to retire in three years. She’s asked me to replace her. Of course, McGonagall already agreed that I would make a good professor, and they would help me get everything done in the course of next year. So, I could be a professor in two years! What do you think?”
Granger agreed. “In Defense, Parkinson couldn’t stop talking about him. Actually, neither could Zabini or Nott. I truly believe that they would do anything to help Harry getting older again.”
After a mock bow towards him, Harry pushed the book with some force into Draco’s chest, which made him cough. A few people’s muffled laughter could be heard as Draco tried to catch some air again, while he stared down Harry.
Neville grinned. “Or you could just revert back to the old Gryffindor Harry Potter and be late some thirty minutes or so?”
Pansy burst out laughing, while Theodore got red with embarrassment and Draco shook his head, not approving of what his friend had said. “No cursing in front of the baby, Theodore! Honestly!”
Draco sat on the bar, silently raising an eyebrow. He noticed Potter having serious trouble controlling his facial expression.
Draco thought that was stupid.
? Potter, take some pride in this name, even if you hate it.”
The Auror bit his lower lip. “Well, I was wondering if you had intercepted some letters in the last two or three months.” Of course he had. It was his job after all. But Draco felt better easing into the discussion than bolting into what he wanted right away.
With only a little chuckle, Harry finally turned on his back and wiped the tears out of his face. “That was good!”
“We do have a newborn baby that keeps all of us busy.” Draco grinned and placed the tray on top of the table, a little away from Lily so she could keep drawing. “Even though he's the sweetest, it's still a lot of work.”
“I would never let that…”
Smiling softly, Draco pulled him closer and kissed his temple again. “So, what were you and McGonagall talking about anyway?”
Shrugging his shoulders, Draco smiled. “You didn’t try and force Potter to do anything. And he already knows Lovegood, so he probably felt safe around you as well.”
Severus raised his eyebrows and shrugged his shoulders. “I know of nothing. If you want to confirm the will, you need to send it to the Ministry. Head over to Professor McGonagall, she’ll be sure to give you some kind of person you can turn to.”
‘Draco’, he typed in.
The unexpected hero if this conversation was Malfoy, as he stepped next to Harry and shook his head. “Come on, you cannot say something like that. We all want to leave here!”
Draco’s jaw tightened and he narrowed his eyes, before he shook his head, relaxing slightly. He still had the hard look and Harry was sure if it had just been the three of them, he would have started yelling at Hermione. Just because she was apparently trying the same trick twice, though Harry didn’t think there was something inside this time.
Potter on the other side of the bars seemed unfazed. “Interested for the wrong reasons, Mr. King. If you would have talked to the Minister, you would have realised it a long time ago.” He then smiled so sweet Draco was about to puke at King. “However, there’s no need for that, as I will have a personal meeting with him, right now. Good day to you, Sir.”
She smiled, apparently oblivious to his quite clear uncharacteristic behavior. “It is!” she answered and grabbed Draco’s book, opening it, as if there was nothing wrong with the world.
His husband knelt down, opened the box and jumped back when a white ferret sat down and blinked up at him. Seamus, Dean and Gregory screamed while they laughed, Millicent threw her hand over her mouth most likely to force herself not to laugh. The other Slytherins looked aghast at that animal, while Susan, Ernest and Parvati started giggling and Ron and Hannah sat there with wide eyes, though Ron snorted soon after, trying to hide his laughter with a cough.
Harry shrugged his shoulders, while he leaned at the door frame looking into the kitchen. “I thought it was easier to leave. I honestly just looked into it, because Ron said it was going to be fun. I just missed you way too much!” He sighed and looked at Draco again softly. “So, are we good?”
Exhaling loudly, Harry bent down and placed his hands on his knees, just to keep himself from rolling into a ball and hiding somewhere he felt safe. His eyes darted over all corners just to make sure that nothing had changed. Malfoy seemed to have noticed it, as he walked closer and lightly placed his hand on his back.
Draco shrugged his shoulders. “Frankly, I have no idea. You seemed to be in need of some…thing. So, I’ve decided to stay here for a bit.”
The second message was slightly more aggressive.
“Poppy, what happened?” he asked, slightly breathless.
“No. That’s a word, right?”
“What is this?!” Pansy asked breathlessly.
Neville rolled his eyes while he got up. “Enjoy your essays, Professor Potter.”
Draco chuckled softly. “Alright, listen up!”
Harry’s expression turned dark for a second, when Pansy mentioned the person responsible for his godfather’s death. Even though she hadn’t cast the death spell, Sirius hadn’t seen her spell coming and had therefore been unable to react.
“Oh, she did a whole lot for us, Theodore” Harry answered and beamed at the Slytherin. “She helped Draco and me to talk about our future and our relationship. It was amazing, really. And thank you so much for insisting!”
Lupin started to laugh and nodded. The tension between them seemed to have resorted. “The godfather of my son is now a baby as well, that is just hilarious.” He chuckled and nodded then. “I see you’re taking good care of him.”
The group was quiet, until Draco placed Potter into the crib next to his couch. Potter gave a soft hum and moved slightly, once Draco gave him Severus’ Teddy bear. Turning to Blaise and Theodore, he raised his eyebrows. “Do you think you can look after Potter for an hour?”
“I’m having enough!” Harry stated and packed up his things. “I’m going to the lake.”
“I’m going to look for Hermione and Ron. They were a group of two, so I want to see whether my influence was bad or not. As in: are they doing better together or not…”
out?” Zabini’s eyes widened and he frowned. “I mean, I am gay, but...”
! “Of course, bear!” he smiled as Harry beamed at him and leaned in for one more kiss. Which then turned into two and three and four.
Just then the door opened again to reveal two Slytherins entering: Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini entered. They looked very much at ease with each other, arm in arm, as they slowly made their way into the Common Room. If Harry had to be honest, he had to say, that Pansy’s stomach looked a little bigger than ususal.
“I did not!”
Groaning, Draco rolled his eyes. “He’s different.” At the sight of Weasley about to start talking, Draco continued. “I don’t know what happened. I just know that he cares about Harry. For some weird reason, Harry seems to have grown on him. So if he wants to take care of
“Harry, we’re really worried! Can you not just tell us something? So that we don’t have to be scared that you could die and we wouldn’t realize until it’s too late?”
Pansy’s suspicious look to both of them didn’t seem to stop Draco from shrugging his shoulders and grinning. As if she had figured out what was going on, she laughed and shook her head, before she walked into the kitchen.
Harry nodded. “Yes! Your hot chocolate is the best!”
Draco nodded, though he saw his mask of happiness slightly fading. Before he could see more of Potter’s true emotions, the man smiled at him and turned around. “If you excuse me, I need to find that stupid thing before I open today. Otherwise, I can stay closed for today.” With that he was in his room, door closed and... locked.
She transformed into Weasley, and he shook his head as well. “Slytherin, really Harry? There’s not a wizard or witch that turned out bad. I thought you knew better than this.”
Draco smirked and they left the Room of Requirement, wandering the halls back down to the Great Hall. Luckily for Harry, since Draco had been awake for so long, he had somehow gotten their clothes from their rooms, so they didn’t even have to go back to the tower.
“Yes please” Draco winked at him, which almost made him lose his poise.
Draco sighed dramatically. “That depends on if it’s worth it or not, Potter!”
The twins were taken aback and held up their hands in mock surrender. “You trained him well, Malfoy” George said and there was hint of mischief in his eyes.
“Someone ought to remind you how to act normal around Muggles” Alamar grinned and looked over to Harry’s house where a nosy woman just looked outside and glared at them. He smiled and waved at her, while she quickly tore the curtains close.
Well, if the news about Draco losing his name had travelled fast… the news about Professor Snape about to adopt him had travelled lightning fast. Draco suspected either Harry – telling Hermione and his friends – or Pansy – telling Neville. Either way, by the end of the day, the whole castle knew what they wanted to do the next day.
“Please don’t hurt my friends” Harry chuckled, though he understood his actions rather well. He was also surprised that Blaise would do something like that for him.
Sighing, Draco fell into a chair and tried his hardest to hide his tears in his hands. He really wanted to be strong, especially in front of Pansy. He didn’t need her pity! He just wanted to go on with his life as if nothing happened! As if Harry was still his normal obnoxious self and they were going to see each other in the Great Hall, being snarky and hateful.
The server nodded and motioned to the cake. “You can just come up and get whatever you’d like and we’ll bring it to the table.”
“Do you think” Ron started slowly and took a deep breath.” That I could maybe be a professor? You know, for Dark Arts?”
Harry turned and grinned at Draco. “You need to enjoy life more, Dray! It’s a somewhat beautiful day, the birds are singing, we’re laughing. Life is good!”
He rubbed his hand over where he thought he had read his name and when the grey dust fell off… there it was.
“I am so happy to hear that!” Harry grinned. “I was busy working in the Muggle World.”
Draco was sitting in the library reading a book Madam Pince didn’t let him take out of the library, when a few people walked by, talking about how ‘nice Professor Snape was to take in a homeless Draco Perdita’. They hadn't been the first to talk about that. Right in front of him. Did they all think he was stupid not to realize that they tried... something?
Harry was quiet, clearly thinking about what they had just said. “So” he finally started, still trying to make heads and tails of this story, “you basically decided to torture my relatives? Who’s the example?”
McGonagall agreed with his godfather and added: “I would have gladly given Miss Granger or Mr. Weasley the obligation to look after their friend, however, the Magical Guardian’s Test has the highest power. So, until he’s reached his actual age again, you’re his guardian.”
Harry nodded slightly, still somewhat unsure. Draco ruffled through the raven hair and smiled at his ward. “Because you are nothing but a good boy! I can’t punish you for being amazing and doing all the right things!”
“Don’t worry, Mr. Malfoy.” Maria smiled and nodded. “The Christmas times are always stressful and sometimes we just need a little break.”
“I know! Especially in third year, but I don’t really know how to. I’ve tried but…” he stopped and shrugged his shoulders. That was probably to indicate that he just couldn’t do it or hadn’t yet figured out how to perform the spell.
“No” he shook his head vehemently, so that his brown hair flew into his face. “I just saw him walking up the stairs.”
You know, I first wrote that this chapter wouldn’t have big revelations, but that changed xD So yeah, Some revelations will be head in the middle of a storm :D Let me know how you like it though :)
She also told me that I could ask for whatever I needed, she’d try and help me with it. I might forget about this as well, so I’m writing it down, just in case. Shit, I hate this curse.
Pansy’s eyes lit up with excitement. “You are so right!”
“The same would happen should the Hat choose Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff, however, we do believe that it will be the same house. It’s just a courtesy to the Book of Acceptance and the Sorting Ceremony” the Headmistress continued as she smiled at him.
Laughing, Draco nodded. Yes, Pansy had for some reason decided she wanted to have more parties. Not that anybody was against it. The younger years enjoyed seeing the parties and the older years were looking forward to something like that. Especially since nobody thought they could have even an ounce of freedom in the next few weeks.
“Yup. They said you’ll know what it means” Pansy said when he sat down next to Harry, picking up a book uninterested. "So... do you know what it means?"
“On second thought” he started and turned back to Harry, “I’ll go and meet the Minister by the front and lead him in.” He walked off, while Harry bit back a smirk.
Harry didn’t have to wait long for an answer and he chuckled at it.
Malfoy snorted. “That’s what you always say when you’re here, Potter, which might I remind you is every other week. Sometimes even twice.”
Thank you for being part of this journey, it was amazing to read all your comments. I'm glad I've started this idea.
Pansy started laughing as soon as she had gotten over the cuteness of the situation and Draco chuckled, ruffling through Harry’s hair, before turning to the animal and accepting the letter. The owl flew away as soon as Draco had gotten the letter free.
Hey Teapot
Hermione think you’re doing good things, I believe you.”
“If you say it like that, exactly.” Remus motioned Draco to follow him and they walked to the corner where two small chairs had been placed. They sat down and Draco placed his ward on the floor, where he started playing with his teddy bear.
He chuckled, once Draco put it down again. “You’ve gotten soft, Draco. A few months ago, you would have definitely emptied it over me!”
Severus had stayed for about half an hour, where Potter had started to show him a lot of different things he had gotten and then played with him.
“Pretty much, yes. You can call me your assistant for the next two days, if you’d like.”
“Well” Eric turned back to Alamar. “Her action absolutely doesn’t put my mind at ease.”
“Just promise me to play nice for the next... let’s say three days. Okay?” It was interesting that this was coming from Ron, who had made it his mission in their last year to make Draco’s life a living hell. Harry had lost count of how many times his then boyfriend had come crying to him in the Room of Requirement, because he couldn’t live with the constant harassment anymore. It had almost gone to the point, where Harry had been about to reveal his relationship with the Slytherin, though Draco had stopped him rather quickly.
Ron wants to know when you’re paying him back the money for getting you out of prison. Alternatively, he also suggested accepting your Merlin First Class, should you wish to part ways. Teapot, if you give him the medal, I WANT the Moontrimmer!
Harry shook his head and smiled at his husband – most likely a very love-sick smile, if he had analysed the annoyed looks from both Neville and Blaise correctly. “Oh no, darling. I am happy that
Your incredibly busy teapot
Pansy nodded. “And before you ask, yes I told them to try riding non-magical horses at the beginning, but they really wanted the magical ones.”
“We talked to him about two months ago; he said he was heading towards York. I’m pretty sure he’s going to go to Scotland.”
call yourself my father, Lucius. I have lost my name four years ago. That includes anybody else in this family.” Draco raised his eyebrows again and sighed. “And now, with the utmost respect, I would like you to leave. I’ve enjoyed this day so far. You’re just going to ruin it again.”
Harry nodded enthusiastically. “True, yes. Okay, so Ravo asked it: ‘Are you okay?’ The kitten looked at Ravo and shook its head. ‘No. I fell down from the tree!’ and Ravo said: ‘You’re a kitten, so you landed on your feet!’”
“Well, everyone deserves an animal friend! Some people in Slytherin even have pet snakes” Draco smiled. “Did you know that Salazar apparently had a pet snake? Apparently, Gryffindor had a cat.”
Apparently, since Pansy seemed unable to finish her sentence, Harry finished it for her: “We travelled around England, trying to find all the hidden objects that could maybe be Horcruxes. The first one I destroyed when I was in second year. There was a diary through which Tom Riddle used to open the Chamber of Secrets. Then there’s the ring, which cursed Dumbledore.”
“Hi Harry” Ron grinned. “I just had to tell ‘Mione that you should have been just five minutes behind us. Why are you only coming in now?” He had a knowing grin and if Harry hadn’t known it better, he would have assumed that he already knew that Draco and he had had sex before.
Harry grinned. “I remember you telling me I wasn’t getting any more chocolate cake the other day... so you...”
Blaise frowned and narrowed his eyes. “If anybody wants to hurt you, I will freak out!”
Draco chuckled and kissed his cheek. “Absolutely. He doesn’t trust you with anything that has to do with money.”
However, this comment made all of them look at Potter, who was by now playing contently with his teddy bear. What did happen that made his bone break? Draco did not want to know, yet… he needed to know. He needed to know what his relatives did to this sweet boy who was so happy!
Draco snorted and moved to lay closer to him. “Daphne would say that, yes. And Pansy, if she knew that we were happily married.”
“Potter, come on!” Draco shook his head and seemed actually mad at him. “You should know that you can’t just do something without practice. I mean, how often did you practice the…” he seemed to think for a good explanation and shrugged his shoulders then. “The Patronus?”
“I didn’t think you’d come today.”
!” Draco crossed his arms while Harry laughed loudly.
“When the hell did that happen? Did the couple’s therapy help? Did Pansy’s idea with locking you in a room help? I’m so confused” Theodore shook his head, his irritation visible on his face.
The room could have been marked as a broom’s closet, since it wasn’t really big. The four of them had been able to stay in there, but five would have been slightly uncomfortable, though still possible. There were two torches, which weren’t burning and… well, nothing else, just bare walls.
A nice lady walked towards him with a friendly smile and Draco returned it. “Hi, I’m supposed to meet Milos King. The reservation is for King.”
“I am” Harry answered and walked into the kitchen. “Where is everyone?”
If Pansy had wanted Draco or Blaise to agree, their answers were drowned out by Millicent who was speaking rather loudly. “Of course, he will! Just think: He wakes up in
Gryffindor (2x)
I've been posting for every day now. Tomorrow you won't be so lucky, I'm working from morning to evening. But maybe you'll get another chapter on Sunday :)
“There’s a trapdoor!”
“I don’t think so.” Harry sighed again and looked at his beer. “His mother’s about to die and he wanted me to pretend to be his boyfriend so she would be happy. And I suddenly had this idea that Draco would fit with his personality rather well.” Thoughtfully, he grabbed his beer and took a sip. “And I think to see him move on was… not the easiest thing.”
“I don’t know” Draco answered, definitely not giving away his ward. “What in Merlin’s name happened?”
“Not really. I knew a family whose great-great-grandfather had a curse like that thrown at him and it continued through the male lineage. Just because the original caster is dead, doesn’t mean the curse can’t connect to its origin.”
Harry nodded and grabbed his own wand. He could still feel where Malfoy had touched him and pulled him downstairs. It was weird, but warm somehow. Well, never mind that, he had no time to think about that.
“Of course I had something to do with that!” Harry frowned, before he smirked. “Skeeter said I had the Dark Mark on me, she threw together some weird picture which was clearly faked and then had the audacity to tell the public that I had ‘finally turned against all that was holy in the Wizarding World’. How was I supposed to just let her continue with that?”
“Wipe that mopey expression from your face, Pans. I’ve talked to your lovely Neville Longbottom and I found out... I think he actually really likes you! I cannot believe how something like that could have happened?!”
Minerva McGonagall nodded grimly. “Reese will only rest once he’s killed every last creature on earth.”
Harry looked up and smiled. “Hey Pans! Hi Theo!”
“You’re right” he said softly and glanced at Pansy, before kissing his boyfriend again. This time much softer, to give him some much needed time to figure out what reality was.
Well, even if there was a serial killer coming to his place, Draco was sure that with his level of magic, Potter could easily defend himself.
Harry snorted. “Yeah, because every Azkaban escapee comes after me? I seriously doubt it.”
He had now a little time to look at the house and the man. Actually, Remus looked rather relaxed and he was wearing comfortable clothing, which Draco would have actually preferred, but his damn pure blood upbringing had drilled it into him that you should always go out looking the nicest you could. Well, the house was huge. With only Teddy’s belongings, the massive living room looked even bigger. So, Potter Senior had given away his slightly smaller mansion. The walls were very white, though still dirty. Maybe that was because it hadn’t been used for quite some time.
As Pansy realized that Draco was awake, she cancelled the spell and grinned at him. “Good morning, Draco. Do you want to know how long you’ve slept?”
“There are rumors going around in the teacher’s lounge” Severus continued and chuckled. “I honestly think it’s a little untactful to talk about student’s relationships. Well, it’s the Golden Boy, now isn’t it?”
The man at the door raised one eyebrow and shook his head. “How come you became an Auror and everything? You never seemed keen to work for the Ministry.”
Draco narrowed his eyes. Where was this going? “No, nothing was broken or anything.”
Harry chuckled. “Nothing, really. But I need a little help with all the work. And I do trust my partner has studied the craft and knows what he’s doing.”
The tea still in his hands, he decided to check with the owlery in the Ministry as well as the Surveillance of Fireplaces. They intercepted some owls and sometimes checked the fire places. Maybe they had done so for the Weasley-Granger household and had anything to tell him.
Neville nodded. “I know exactly what you mean. I mean it’s nice that Hogwarts set up all these things, but why do we need to see them? We remember them...” he rolled his eyes. Harry smiled weakly.
Chuckling softly, Harry kissed his husband’s forehead and stood up. “Do you want some cheesy lines, then? You, Draco Potter, are my sun. I gravitate towards you and you are my world.” He frowned. “That needs some work.”
things about him. So, he would rather stay out here, hope that Harry would... somehow remember good things about him too. He had been raising him, right? That was a good thing?
“You look so happy, Nora?” Harry said and petted her head. “Do you know what’s behind this door, then?” As he pushed down the door handle, they suddenly stood in Harry’s bedroom, or the one he had taken over as one. “Oh.”
“It’s already night, Ron” Harry smirked and saw his friend widen his eyes and staring at the window.
“Ah, Mister Potter!” Professor Flitwick greeted him with a big smile. Padfoot sat down next to the former professor expecting some petting, which he received after a quick visible confusion. “I’ve heard so many great things about your career.”
Harry chuckled softly. “If we’re already putting our children in houses, how about we throw Tommy into Slytherin? He might look like me, but he’s certainly a Snake, through and through.”
“Of course.” Harry grabbed the plates and smiled at Draco, before he left the room. He did hope that Molly wasn’t going too hard on him.
Draco had just wanted to comment on how beautiful it was when Harry sat up and opened his own satchel, taking out a parchment. He seemed to look for something else and finally took out a thin book, which he did not show the title just yet. Slightly intrigued by the secrecy, Draco sat up properly as well and frowned at his boyfriend.
As the mediwitch nodded and went to her desk to write a letter to Severus, Harry turned to Draco and frowned. “Hey, Draco, what is love?”
Nodding, Harry grinned. “Okay!”
“Harry, what’s going on?”
Harry narrowed his eyes. “So, you’re saying you’re fine with it?”
He also did not want to be faced with the option of his ward remembering things about him.
The Gryffindor looked at him a little longer than what seemed to be normal, before he turned back to the curtains with a smile on his lips. It was an odd, though very soft smile, like someone would smile at a cat or a dog they really loved.
Harry cleared his throat. “Remus told me to give you this parchment. I haven’t read it, since he doesn’t want me to.” He handed Draco a parchment and smiled. “For what it’s worth, Dray, don’t overthink this.”
“I have a feeling you’ve changed your name again” Madam Pomfrey continued, already having caught onto what Draco was insinuating.
“I do not lose my way... P...” Harry tried to come up with a word staring with p so his little hiccup didn’t look or sound suspicious, but he couldn’t come up with anything. And now, it sure as hell looked exactly that way.
“Are you good?” Ron asked, his red face almost matching the red hair.
“He’s not bad, just a lot of work.”
Harry turned to follow Ron’s gaze, seeing Terrance smiling at him. His eyes were so soft and full of love. It gave Harry an almost tipsy feeling. He returned the smile and blew him a kiss. Terrance chuckled, before Hermione got his attention back and introduced him to Ginny.
far, we gave the women voting power fifty years ago – that’s incredibly bad looking if we check with other wizarding communities around the world.”
Harry growled. “It already
“You still haven’t told me what you smell!” Draco laughed as he got up too.
“Talk to me, Harry. What’s the problem?” Draco sat down on an arm chair crossed-leg and waited for his ward to talk.
“Of course, my love!” Draco smiled down at him. “They will all get a heart attack with what we’re playing.”
Even though they were in the shadows, Eric exhaled as they finally entered the safety of the Gringott’s creature wards. What the wizards didn’t know was that the goblins were on their side ever since the wizards and witched started taking away their gold. The creature wards made every creature either look like a goblin or a wizard or witch, depending on what was closer – people could make of that what they wanted.
Harry groaned and placed his head in his hands. “I wasn’t thinking, Ginny.”
Well, the kitchen was still almost fully furnished. In actuality, it had even more things on the table. Alamar pushed the bow and arrows aside and let the one-pot-pasta float onto the table. Eric already sat there, looking at the plan they had made in the last five weeks.
Some branches cracked and Harry jumped up. “That’s it for tonight” Harry said loudly and turned to the castle. He hurried up, looking over his shoulders, though nothing followed him. And with Padfoot next to him, nothing should be there to hurt him. His own paranoia had gotten to him, most likely.
Hey Harry!
Potter chuckled. It was soft and airy, but the deep voice made it sound almost earthy and exotic. “That’s what you’re saying now, Malfoy.”
“That’s just how things are. There’s no real explanation for that.”
“Okay, Harry, we really do need all of them” Draco motioned to the map on the table, which was the smallest piece and could have maybe fit into the backpack – or some other pocket. Harry’s sight lingered on the casual movement of his boyfriend a little longer, seeing the little muscle plays under his plain white shirt and finally turned to the object, once Draco frowned at him.
Not long after, Ginny served the food she had been cooking – it looked as if it was Asian food. Luna handed Harry the potion he had been taking before every meal and he downed it quickly, just now realizing how hungry he had gotten. And Ginny was just an amazing cook.
He quickly whistled for Padfoot who ran happily down the hall towards him. “Hey, good boy” Harry grinned. “Let me check something.”
“That might be more likely” Harry answered and watched as Severus finally caught Lily and tickled her, while she tried to escape him and Caellum tried everything to protect his older sister. Harry smiled at their chaos, seeing Emmet playing with Merlin who seemed to enjoy their shared play time. “That’s probably true.”
Looking at Draco, Harry moved his hand up to his cheek. “Darling” he said softly and moved to a kneeling position. “You do not have to be afraid of that.”
“You’re talking about Potter” Draco interrupted her, before she would get any more inappropriate. Baby Potter had started to draw something on the parchment with a grey crayon, eyes wide. Draco shook his head and turned back to the discussion happening right now.
“Would you please follow me to the History of Magic classroom?” It wasn’t a question. If it had been a question, Draco would have probably said no and told her to wait for about ten minutes so they could get their stories straight. What now?
Harry sighed. “There’s no turning back now, is there?”
Draco shook his head. “No! Why aren’t you home? I had quite a hard day and I was actually looking forward to snuggle with someone and then you’re not there. It’s almost eleven!”
Sophie cheered and jumped from Harry’s lap. She ran to the kitchen and Harry smiled at Draco. “Looks like it didn’t work.”
“I said she took every possible test” Severus emphasized. He took another sip from his tea and leaned back in his chair. “She only showed you the Magical Guardian Test, since this one is the easiest to understand. There are others that are not as loose and involve a lot of thinking to be understood and... never mind. No matter which test Minerva performed, you were Harry’s Guardian.”
Harry smirked. “Well okay. Think of the Marauders, then. But I’ll doubt that’ll help you.” He got up and walked to the kitchen where Draco heard him opening a bottle of wine.
“Sorry, sorry! Potter, don’t say that” Theodore held his hands in the air and shook his head as well.
Chuckling, Harry put his arms around his boyfriend’s neck and shrugged his shoulders. “You give me the opportunity to be so.” He kissed Neville and smiled. “Since we’re already talking about moving a little bit faster. Do you want to come to the Weasley Christmas celebration with me tonight? As my official boyfriend?”
King listened up immediately. “Interesting. One of my other guys has found something as well.”
“Thinking back, we should have just let the Hat put us there!” Fred turned to his brother who rolled his eyes and hit his brother with some paper over the head. As soon as the paper touched his head, it exploded in a huge glitter bomb.
Hermione shrugged his shoulders. “Everyone is different. Parkinson was very nice. If you would have told me in Hogwarts, that one day we would have a civilized discussion or that I would be happy to see her having children, I probably would have told you to start living in reality.”
“I never thought of it that way...” Draco frowned, looking at Harry. He wondered what he went through in this year on the run.
Smirking, Harry leaned back, crossing his arms over his chest. “Hermione.” He echoed her inflexion, which seemed to trip her up, as she opened her mouth, speechless a few times, before she shook her head.
The man standing there was wearing a black suit, elegant tie and his black leather bag seemed very expensive. However, Draco was very good at seeing the differences between fakes and real expensive stuff. This one was clearly faked. His brown hair was styled with way too much hair gel. In fact, his whole personality looked more fake than real.
Draco snorted. “
He didn’t join him in the shower, so he finished quickly and dressed in his formal wear from the party again. Luckily, he had a few outfits in his office, so that wasn’t going to be a problem. He just wanted to hide from his father. At least until he knew what he and Harry were going to be.
Padma looked at her sister in shock. “You knew? And didn’t tell me?!”
‘Help’ Potter mouthed, though his eyes couldn’t focus anymore. Draco needed the knocking to stop, so he quickly walked over and opened the door. Connor was just about to say something, next to the opened mail, but Draco grabbed it and closed to door again.
Before they could say something, Potter scowled and clumsily patted the book that was open in front of him. “Lire!” he somewhat yelled and Draco shook his head until he realized that baby Potter was speaking French and wanted Blaise to continue reading the book.
“Remus. Um... Hello. I did not expect to find you here.”
Eric and Alamar head to Gringott's to see if there's anything wrong with Harry.
Draco leaned forward and frowned at the toddler on his laps. “And who am I then, mister?”
Harry smirked. “Thank you Headmistress. Will that be all?”
Nodding, Draco turned around, but waited a second, before looking back at her. “You’re a witch, aren’t you?”
“I have, yes.” Draco held up his hands as if he was trying to show off his innocence. Though after the next step, he snaked his arms around Harry’s waist and pulled him closer.
“It is?” Draco asked and glanced at Theodore who was grinning from ear to ear, even though he was play fighting with Harry. “So, who’s got your interest, darling?”
Leaning back, Harry held out his hands and Draco got up to sit down on his husband’s lap. “They want me to take over everything.”
Shrugging his shoulders, Harry resumed eating his chips. He didn’t really mind that, as long as he could stay with Eric and Alamar and Aurora. “I don’t mind.”
“We rescued young Harry Potter from a house that was full of Dumbledore’s magic and we wanted to make sure that if we went out of the country, he wouldn’t be able to find us” Eric explained when he turned back to his old friend.
Before he got up, he realized that something had fallen out of the book. It was a letter sent with Muggle post, it seemed. It was addressed to Harry coming from none other than Hermione Weasley. It looked as if Granger had married the Weasel. Draco debated whether or not to look into the envelope. It really wasn’t what he was supposed to do. He was supposed to read the book Harry had given him and find a cure. Reading a letter that fell out of the book seemed a little personal. Then again… the letter had been inside the book. Maybe it contained something important…
Harry was apparently too tired to fight him since he followed without complaining and even let himself be pushed into a chair. Draco grabbed a wine bottle and two glasses and poured them both a glass. Sliding it over the table, he marveled at the sight in front of him. Harry gingerly grabbed the wine glass, did his best impression of what a wine lover should do and took a sip, before putting it down, trying his hardest not to look disgusted. It was always the same and Draco loved it. Harry did so too, he was sure, why else would he do the same thing over and over again?
“That’s disgusting!” Theodore called and jumped up.
Minerva sighed. “Nobody wants to be registered with the
Harry felt Malfoy walk up next to him and he could smell the fragrance Malfoy used so much better in this small room. It made him shudder slightly.
Harry smiled down at him and put him into the crib, where their crazy Kneazel Merlin joined him after a few seconds and the two of them started playing with a ball. Harry had always loved to watch Merlin play with the children; however, he needed to find Draco. Something didn’t feel right.
“I do” Harry grinned. “But something’s personal.”
“What?” Ginny took a sip of her wine and shook her head. “How did she know that?”
“I like to eat, so sometimes we go out into a restaurant” Ron offered, while Hermione raised her eyebrows at him.
The bats continued hunting for food, the dogs howled at the moon again and the cats hissed at each other just as they had before. Only two people had changed. And they would never be the same.
Draco could tell that Pansy had been waiting for the perfect moment to ask her question and this seemed to be it, when the door opened and a few Gryffindors walked in. Namely, Hermione, Ron, Neville and Ginny.
However, looking at the happily squealing baby made it really hard to be mad at him. Well, Draco could still try.
Harry smiled and nodded. Now would be the best way to say something that indicated he had problems with Draco being his husband, right? Only… how could he say that?
“Hogwarts has an emergency? What kind?”
Outside, Pansy stood there, clearly waiting for Draco. “Draco darling, how are you feeling?”
Harry turned back to the lake, but he changed how he sat after a moment, so he could more easily look over to Draco. That might have been a good thing, right?
If he was honest though, he had never been willing to become an Auror. He had just told Severus that he wanted to become an Auror to get his father furious, with which he had succeeded. So actually, it was a relief to not have to go into this job. The only negative point there was that he once again had no idea what he wanted to become.
Draco nodded, tears in his eyes and he threw his arms around his neck and nuzzled into the crook of his neck. Before Harry even realized it, he found his husband crying. Without thinking, he pressed him closer, rubbing his back.
“Maybe this story’s why you were strong enough to tell your mother that you’re not going to marry the girl? Because Diana also didn’t get married to Leon. I’m sure this movie was an outrage when it first came out. It seems to be quite an old movie.” Harry grinned and got up to check the date.
Before he could even think of something to say to that, his phone rang and Draco happily accepted the call, hoping for someone to save him from this terrible situation. He had accepted this call so quickly that it hadn’t occurred to him to look at the screen and see who was calling him.
Draco just wanted to answer his ward’s question, when he frowned slightly. “Ze is kissing someone? That’s new.”
“Right” Pansy grinned and shook her head. “Do sit down, most are already awake and have eaten.”
Madam Pomfrey shook her head and looked at Draco. “Should you discuss a way to harm them, you better wait until I’m out of earshot. That way I could deny knowing anything about it.” She turned back to Potter, checking the arm of the somehow still unknowing child. “It’s fine for know. Stay here for another hour and everything should be healed. Then, we can start the ageing process again.” She nodded and hurried out of the privacy bubble, while Draco chuckled.
“Just... let it go, Hermione. I think we’ve grown apart. And that’s fine by me. I live my life, you live yours. Merry Christmas.”
“Yeah” Harry nodded. “Until I was there over the summer, I always figured he lived in a huge Manor, like the Malfoy Manor.”
Ian smirked. “I just had an idea: I don’t think you two are an actual pair. I think you’re housing him until he decides to walk away and he just knows about me and decided to make you look better.”
“He didn’t just leave, Harry” Kingsley said, still frowning and watching him intently.
Harry shook his head. “From what I've learnt; if you take someone's name you kind of take away they're family magic. They're left with their own magical core or whatever. The fact that you were still powerfull even though you had no name, proves how powerful you are.”
He turned and looked at his ward who had a concerned expression on his face, when they climbed another set of stairs.
Before he could reach her, Charlie held his hand back. “Don’t touch him! It’s another sense that could mess him up right now. You need to let the magic do its work.”
has all the normal books, for Hogwarts students and some for the casual reader and then the special books. Some of them can’t even be bought.”
For some reason, Draco didn’t like this option much. He sighed and shook his head. “I was hoping you… this matchmaker could help me find a boyfriend for my mother’s Christmas Masquerade. She keeps insisting that she has better taste in men, but they’re just not my type.”
“I never would have guessed!” Draco feigned surprise and winked at him. “The way you kissed me was kind of speaking for itself.”
Mrs Williams shook her head. “If you’d like to see him, he’s on the hill. He barely sleeps, even though we’re about to have snow any day now, he stays outside pretty much all the time.”
warm.” Draco couldn’t resist a smirk and he even chuckled, while Harry explained his reasoning for putting a penguin onto that island.
Finally, after quite some time, they reached the apparition spot and Draco along with Harry apparated to Diagon Alley. Once again, he avoided the actual Diagon Alley and turned into a small alley on the right, almost next to the Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes (which Harry almost wasn’t able to keep his eyes off).
The boy widened his eyes and he shook his head. “You can’t do that! Only Prefects and Head boys and girls can take points! And he’s torturing Harry Potter!” Cambell pointed an accusatory finger at Draco.
Chuckling, Harry motioned her to the small kitchen at the end of the hallway. “You don’t need to ask me that, ‘Mione. Maria is a phenomenal cook and whenever she catches me not really eating, I’m ordered to come by her house and eat. In a way, she’s worse than Molly.”
Best wishes
Nodding, Draco grabbed a few pounds and put them into the tip jar. “Draco, we’ve been over this, stop paying!” Harry rolled his eyes.
“You’re welcome, Harry. One good turn deserves another, you know.”
“Very well” Minerva seemed to get the rather obvious hint and smiled. “I decided to offer you a few options for living with your husband while being the headmaster. There has never been a headmaster who was married, however, quite a few professors have been and are still married, and they have a variety of options for their home life. I thought I presented them to you, just in case you were interested.”
Nott agreed and grabbed his bag. “Let’s see what’s inside.”
Harry shook his head. “I don’t feel lucky.”
Chuckling, his former professor shook his head. “Don’t you worry, Draco. I think it needed to happen that way. It made it official that I’m a werewolf and through that I could join the werewolves and be a secret agent for Dumbledore. There’s a point to everything.”
Millicent snorted and rolled her eyes. “In your dreams, Malfoy! I will never like Potter. And baby Potter is just annoying.”
“Hi. I’m Harry James Potter, can I have some of this?”
Potter’s round eyes turned back to him again and he looked clearly interested. “Why?”
Harry nodded and he led them through the tunnels to a huge room. It had a few snake heads on the side and at the back there was a statue and…
Smiling, Potter put down his glass and got up. He walked behind the bar and took out a pamphlet, which he laid on the table in front of Draco. “I have always tried to hide away, so one day, around four years ago; I went to France and found a job at this winery. They became like a second family, before my past got hold of me and dragged me back to England.”
After the careful evaluation, Draco finally nodded. “He is. Don’t worry, we don’t want to... take him away from his friends or whatever. We just want him to have a nice and happy childhood. And you can ask him or Pansy or Theodore, I didn’t want him to go through the Sorting Ceremony again. He wanted to do it on his own accord.”
“Don’t let Ron hear that! He’s still quite jealous.” She greeted him and pulled him into the chair right next to hers. “So, with Neville married, you have to be next. And don’t pretend that you don’t know what I’m talking about. Neville told us that there is someone!”
Draco smiled at him and then turned towards the house, which seemed to be holding its breath as if it was waiting for what Draco would come up with. “Well, maybe the name
And he would lean in, kiss her softly on her lips and keep his eyes closed just a millisecond longer than she would. Draco’s heart was always racing at this point. It was everything he had always wanted.
Harry was gobsmacked and stared at Eric, when he found his pointy ears again. It really did look like the man escaped a fairy tale book. “Is Alamar also a fairy?” he asked.
“I don’t understand!” Draco sighed and rubbed his forehead. “Where would he go?”
“That’s all I’m asking.”
“You can’t know something that never happened, Harry” Luna said and smiled softly. “Besides, I always thought that the two of you would make a good team had you been friendly from the beginning. Draco always has had too many Nargles around him. I haven’t seen him lately, but I think Azkaban takes them away.”
Kira sighed, but her eyes sparkled, as she started talk. “I did. Mother was ruthless. She’s really not in the mood to fight for a few more hundred years. This had been our land first. What did these idiots think they could just take it over?!” She pulled her shirt away from her neck and showed a deep red scar running from her neck down to her shoulder, where it disappeared under the clothes. “Got this nasty scar from a stupidly used magical trick by the wizards. It’ll be gone in a few decades, but I cannot believe I didn’t see it coming!”
Malfoy took a step back, gathering snow as well. “Telling him about what?”
Pansy walked closer to Harry and opened her arms in a hug, which the former Gryffindor also accepted. “You look great, darling!”
Harry grabbed his phone and forced his body not to follow the clear somehow visible blue line that brought him to Draco, but to walk to the Room of Requirement. He needed to do something, or this would most likely end with him ripping Draco’s clothes from his body right in front of everyone.
“Don’t you dare!” Draco grinned. “At least not here.”
Draco had serious trouble hiding his grin as he got up, stepped out of the puddle and tried to clean his clothes from the dirt. He helped Pansy out of the mud and turned back to McGonagall. “Good afternoon, headmistress. Have you come to enjoy an afternoon outside?”
“Yes please!” Harry giggled
Even though Severus had given no explanation to the other station, Draco laughed and shrugged his shoulders. “That wouldn’t be his first swear words, Severus. Theodore said shit in front of him and he liked that word.”
Ron choked on the Butterbeer and Hermione widened her eyes as well as if she had not thought he was actually telling them something he was hiding. Neville was the only one around them who had already known it. He smirked and winked at Harry as if he knew exactly who he was married to, though Harry doubted that. Blaise and Pansy seemed both speechless as they looked at the ring.
Nott, Malfoy and Ron had tried to open the door for the better part of the morning. In fact, the sun was already really high; it could be early in the afternoon. What made him think he could actually open this place?
That was the first time Severus had called him son. It felt so much better and warmer than it had always felt when his former father had used that word. Usually, it had been followed up by what he had done wrong. They looked at each other and Severus smiled softly.
Harry nodded. “I think I’ll pass on that.”
He groaned as Luna helped him getting to his feet and after the first step towards the kitchen, he finally answered. “I don’t remember, Luna. Maybe I have, maybe I haven’t.”
“Oh, you’re memory must have some serious flaws then, because I remember almost pissing my pants” Harry answered and grinned.
“I would love to, but...” Pansy looked at Draco, contemplating silently whether or not she should follow her and get something to drink.
break loose.”
Malfoy frowned at him and raised his eyebrows shortly after. “With you? Not a chance, Potter. Get out of here!” He laughed and shook his head.
“I did. It helped me find myself and what I think is my purpose.”
Potter shook his head, while his body was still shaking visibly. Draco sighed quietly, but sat down next to him. He should tell Potter that the war has been over for a while now, but his Muggle counterpart wouldn’t know about that. He also couldn’t just tell him that there was nothing dangerous in the fire. Some nights, he woke up in cold sweat as well, having dreamt about the Room of Requirement and him dying in it.
Kingsley smiled and continued as if he didn’t care that Draco had interrupted him. “Some of you might know that Harry Potter lives with his relatives. I would like to ask you all some questions. What do you know about them?”
The group burst out laughing, mostly unable to believe what just happened. Theodore quickly climbed out of the lake, wild eyes, though he dried himself and looked up with the calculated Slytherin eyes that were definitely planning something. “That was one step too far, Harry! I hope you’re ready for what I’m throwing your way!”
“It’s nice to be here, Mrs. Weasley” Blaise said politely to which Molly was quick to remind him not to call her like that and that she was ‘Molly’.
Sighing, Harry nodded. “Pansy – we ran away. Literally. I was afraid they were tracking us still. I’m actually surprised that the Ministry hasn’t told you, since you’re supposed to start working there. But neither I nor Neville really wanted to be there. And the process to get out of the Auror Training Program would have taken a month to complete. And I was not going to wait another month to see Draco.” He smiled softly at him and Draco chuckled, already having forgiven him for not having been there more.
“What if I wanted to ask someone to go on a date I have never talked to nor have any idea whether or not they would even be interested? How would I do that best?”
Various (see additional list)
“What…” Draco wanted to say something, but Harry quickly shook his head and sent him a warning glance.
Harry frowned and turned to Draco, intending on asking what he had asked Luna to draw, when he found his boyfriend on his knees. “Harry James Potter, you make me the happiest person on this world. You never want anything from me and you helped me through all my hardships. And you never abandoned me even though I’m sure it would have been easier sometimes.”
They went to the Infirmary right after dinner; however, not only Draco had walked there with Harry… Theodore, Pansy, Blaise and Millicent had all followed. Nobody seemed to be willing to let Harry go through with finally remembering everything. Actually, it wasn't that. He already did remember everything. They didn't want to... stop caring for him, it seemed.
Before Draco could say something, Harry actually pulled him onto his lap and slightly looked up at him. After the first surprise, Draco grinned, leaning in and softly touching Harry’s lips with his own.
Before Harry could respond, the door was opened again and Draco Malfoy walked in with his friend Pansy Parkinson in tow. They were too far away for Harry to hear what they were talking about and while Neville seemed to have realized that their discussion was over – or he wanted it to be over – he grabbed his book again, falling into the world of Healing Potions again.
“Don’t bother, Weaslette. If anybody should say they’re sorry, I’m the one. So: I’m sorry.”
Harry smiled lovingly. “But I’m not professional.”
“Thank you, Harry!” she whispered, even though Draco heard it as well.
Harry shrugged his shoulders, as he added the cream to the sauce. “Anything from me being able to get out of bed to just laying there and not being in too much pain.”
Nodding, Draco rolled his eyes. “Secondly… I think I’m just afraid what everyone would say, especially Harry’s friends. They always hated me.”
“I felt like that for quite a long time actually” Malfoy continued. “If you want to know the exact time I figured out I was kind of into you, it was the Ministry’s first annual Quidditch game.” He smirked and seemed to develop a soft red color in his face as well.
Draco and Pansy looked at each other. In the end, Draco was the one to speak up. “Not really in his adulthood. I mean we saw him and he heard a few things, but it’s not really personally.”
Ginny chocked on a piece of cake and placed it on the table, before she coughed and turned back to Harry. With wide eyes, she swallowed the cake and shook her head. “No! No, you can’t do that!”
“Yes, I think it would help my ward to be looking after an owl. And to be honest, hearing about his story, it matches his rather well.”
Harry smirked and shrugged his shoulders. “I mean, it’s finished once we decide it’s finished. Ravo’s school could be literally two minutes away, or the cat could be completely messed up and point him into the wrong direction.” He handed Draco the parchment, where their continued story could be read.
“We should just leave right now!” Dean said and groaned rather overly exaggerating with throwing his hands into the air.
Alamar laughed over Eric’s defeated expressions. Yes, family talk wasn’t really his favourite topic. Nevertheless, he seemed to have himself under control when he answered Harry. “I do, yes. Kira is the youngest of all of us. And I’m a decade older. The next closer sibling is I believe one and a half century older than us, so we always felt like we needed to stick together if we wanted to be someone.”
Severus nodded. “Should you have any problems, you can always come here. However, I do believe that Draco and any other eighth year are surely there to help you before I am. Still, if there is anything happening, you can always come and knock.”
“I need some information about a specific fire place” Draco explained. The witch nodded and asked which one. Draco as usual felt a little embarrassed as he once again said Weasley’s and Granger’s fire place.
Daphne spoke up and decided to play along. “There must be another reason as to why you were hiding the ring.”
“Of course you have.” Potter rolled his eyes and waved Draco into the kitchen.
And of course did he not like magic, when he was punished after having done
Before Draco could press the contact info and call his boss, his phone rang and King was on the other end.
“Then how do you know he thinks the same? Maybe he just didn’t say anything, because these were his friends and he didn’t want to attack them?” Draco suddenly frowned. What had his life come to?! Was he seriously defending a Gryffindor right now? What had happened to his beautifully controlled world?!
Draco blushed while Harry chuckled quietly. “I have tried to tell him that, Madam Pomfrey, but he just doesn’t believe me.”
“Absolutely. You were my trial child and I think you turned out pretty good.” Pansy winked back.
Everyone had been worried about his mental health. And Draco was happy that his ward had another session with the mental healer (whatever the name was again) on Monday.
Harry shrugged his shoulders and looked away, blushing slightly. “I had not intended on something like that. I think I was being led by too much anger.”
McGonagall stopped and waited for everyone to come closer. She then explained how Hogwarts was one of the leading schools in a few different areas, but Care of Magical Creatures was one of them. “We have students coming from all over the world to learn from our very experienced professors here.”
“Oh my… He really is a baby!” she exclaimed and walked over slowly. Weasley shook his head and followed his girlfriend, while Lovegood smiled.
“I don’t know.” Draco said and shrugged his shoulders nonchalantly. “It’s a magical scar, you can’t fix those.”
The Slytherin nodded and smiled, before he vanished behind the secret door that seemed to disappear as soon as the wood touched the other wooden parts. By now, the knocking had intensified. Harry rolled his eyes and took a few more steps to the door and opened it spirited.
Pansy stopped dead in her track and stared at Harry. “You’re kidding, right?”
When they walked into the room, it was another memorabilia room for all the fallen students and for the Battle of Hogwarts. There were pieces of Hogwarts, pictures of the Battle and whatever the families of the victims had wanted to donate to this room.
“What just happened?” Ron asked and fell onto the couch next to Harry, making Padfoot move away or he had Ron’s feet in his face.
Smirking, Harry pulled Draco into another kiss. He always felt so happy whenever he was close to the Slytherin. Just the warmth of the other man’s skin, the smell of his shampoo and the careful eyes on him… all of that was what he never knew he needed.
Kingsley nodded. “I would first like to hear where everyone has been. Mr. Malfoy, let’s start with you: What did you do Friday night?”
Shaking his head, Draco made sure to tell him that this wasn’t an option. “She won’t be giving you any as well.”
“Um…” Harry looked at the floor, where he just saw a few smaller and bigger cases, before he looked back at Malfoy unsure of which one he should take.
They left the office and Harry quickly turned to Theodore. “Hey, Theo, what does one have to do theoretically speaking to take someone’s name?”
Harry turned back to the piano and nodded as well. “It just came back a little late. I wish I could have helped you earlier.”
Their class mates truly didn’t make sense sometimes. Harry rubbed his forehead, pretending to keep the nonexistent tears at bay and cleared his throat when he heard the announcement that the game would start in ten minutes.
This time, Harry could hold back his laughter and he closed the door laughing. “Good move.”
“If I get to play with you again, absolutely!”
Finally, after about ten minutes of tense silence and only baby Potter’s weird inhuman-like noises and Severus’ irrational chuckles, McGonagall entered the room, followed by Professor Sprout and Madam Pomfrey.
“They won’t laugh off the couple’s therapist!” Blaise argued.
“There are a lot of things here, Mil!” Pansy called back, laughing.
Daisy laughed and shooed both men out of her kitchen. Potter greeted the men at the table and started with a beer for them. “Benjamin, could you help me out for today? Olivia and James had to go to London and get school supplies; Aaron is taking them, so I have no help today.”
This made even him laugh. “I see” he grinned. “Do you know your actual name, then?”
“I’m not doing something meaningless. I’m helping...” His mother interrupted him, before he could say something. That wasn’t surprising. Both his parents thought that his job was stupid and he could earn so much more money if he had gone into politics. However, he had seen how it had ended for his father and decided not to do anything that would land him in the eyes of the public.
Nodding, Ron looked slightly impressed. “I mean, take over Hogwarts, mate! What could you lose?”
Harry squealed. “Teddy!” A burst of accidental magic brought his very own teddy bear to him and he laughed, while Draco shook his head. It had actually been the very first action of his magic and Draco thought it was awesome!
Draco walked into the Common Room the next day to find Harry sitting there, quietly reading a book and tapping his feet to some music – in his head. As if Harry had heard him, he looked up and smiled broadly.
“Client” Harry chuckled and shook his head. “No. But Draco still is. If you’re okay, I could tell him to meet you tomorrow. He’s busy today, Pansy is throwing a Christmas Banquet.” Harry smirked and grabbed his phone. “But tomorrow in the afternoon in the café next to the shop where you buy your suits?”
In times like these, it always just seemed like they were the only one on the entire earth. Well, Padfoot was around mostly as well, but he belonged to them and it never felt as if he didn’t have his place with them.
“What is then?” Harry asked as they started walking again. They needed to see whether or not one or both Weasley twins were available to look at the vault.
Harry smiled, closing his eyes again and relaxing further into Draco’s loving care. Without him, he was sure that he wouldn’t have been able to make it far. Draco had always looked out for him, always had the best interest in mind for him. He was indeed the best husband for him.
Harry looked at her and after another silent ten seconds, he nodded. “Of course. It surely means a lot to get the Wonder Boy telling the Ministry to let you go.”
“You are a constant happy memory, Lily!” Harry smiled at the blonde haired girl and nodded. “In fact, I think this whole family is such a memory.”
As he sat down, at the table again, Hermione seemed to have read his expression expertly. “Don’t worry Harry; they’re going to the next Quidditch World Cup together. They haven’t talked about anything else for the past five months.”
Draco looked at Madam Pomfrey who started to talk right now. It was a welcomed distraction from his own mind.
Opening the door, Alamar found Harry once again rolled into a ball and Aurora raced through his legs and jumped on the bed, meowing softly and effectively waking up Harry. When he saw Aurora looking at him, he sat up quickly, grabbed his glasses and hugged the Krimnee.
“He started much earlier than Harry did” Draco remarked and looked at his ward, who seemed to be fascinated by the new baby around.
When it was quiet afterwards, Eric frowned and turned to Harry. “How come you ask Alamar what he does but not me?”
“Okay, guys!” Neville shook his head, looking from one to the other. “Honestly, it’s like nothing exists outside of your relationship! I’ve been calling for you to stop for about five minutes.”
“You’re falling for him, aren’t you?”
Oh boy, that was going to be a long talk… Harry raised his eyebrows silently. He really wanted to burst out laughing, but he really couldn’t. Not if he wanted to continue playing his classmates.
Draco turned around to see Harry lying on the floor, laughing loudly. His eyes were twinkling again and he immediately recognized his ward again. This boy was the one he had raised. Draco felt his heart lighten again. Without thinking too hard about it, he had managed to get Harry back into his happy positive mind state. His ward ran out of the cupboard and fell around his neck.
Turning to Theodore, Draco smirked. “Are you okay, Theo? Do you maybe want a few ideas for how you could get back at Harry?”
Luckily, tonight was time to party and Harry had been invited to the after game party along with his friends and his boss – Draco Malfoy. Even though Draco was financing the Pride of Portree, their team captain was still Keene. And Draco had decided not to intervene when she wanted some changes. However, getting Harry to be a part of the Pride of Portree had been Draco’s decision. Nevertheless, Keene had been rather happy about that. Especially since in the next game after Harry had been chosen to be their Seeker, they had to fight someone else. Ginny Weasley-Lovegood. Surprisingly, Harry had won and Keene had accepted him into her team immediately.
His godfather sighed. “For that to know, I do have to tell you about his past or rather mine. Lily, his mother, had finally gotten us fools – by that I mean her husband and me – to talk to each other. We weren’t friends, by no means but she wanted us to at least be able to be in a room without trying to kill each other. Lily took Potter to meet me a few times before they died and every time I gave him this teddy bear to play with.”
Nodding, Harry shrugged his shoulders. “I can’t let the fake lawyer leave without a little showdown” he said as if that was the worst idea ever.
Draco placed the will from James Potter on the table and smiled weakly. “We only have the will, Grunvur.”
Well then, time to go and hunt one specific Gryffindor. Draco quickly glanced into the Hospital Wing, though there was absolutely no one inside. “What a surprise” he muttered as he made his way to the library. Most Gryffindors spent their free time in the library studying things for their N.E.W.T.s. How depressing.
So, he sat at the table, doing his Transfiguration homework, keeping an eye on his ward and his friends. After half an hour, Potter was sitting on Lovegood’s lap, playing with dolls (and Weaslette), while talking to Granger in his almost understandable, yet still far away from actual speech talk. Some words were French others were English and most words were just made up or a mix between French and English. Granger however, really seemed to be able to talk to him, since she asked a lot of questions regarding his story and he answered in his language, which she once again pretended to understand.
Well, Draco liked to sit down there in the middle of the night, when everyone went to bed, put up a soundproof bubble-charm and play a little bit of jazz. His father had always told him that there was no feeling supposed to be in music. The people writing the music already put emotion into the pieces, he didn’t have to overdo it. So he had always hated the classical writers.
Harry caught Blaise about to say something, most likely how Harry had once asked out Draco and held his husbands mouth closed. “Be nice, B.” He then planted a kiss on his cheek, when Molly walked back out of the kitchen with champagne and flavoured water for the children – and quite possibly Hermione as well.
While he lay there, surrounded by Draco’s scent and his seemingly undying love, Harry opened an eye and found his husband with such a soft look on his face, that he could have started to cry, had he not been so tired.
He cleared his throat and Harry caught his eyes flicker over Hermione and for a quick moment, he thought that Blaise was going to tell everyone what she did. “Draco came to me, complaining about something Harry did, so I wanted to confront him. I got really angry and I think that made him change his mind and he told me about the game two days ago, or maybe yesterday, I don’t remember.”
The guard at the door to Azkaban looked just as surprised as everyone else always did, seeing him outside his own home. These days, Harry hadn’t been out much. The only time he had even left his own four walls was to attend Teddy’s graduation from Hogwarts and he had barely made it through. He was just getting sicker and sicker and there was apparently only one thing that could safe him: his own death.
It was already almost eleven o’clock. How long had he waited there? Once again sighing, Draco hurried down the corridor, evaded Severus – who he was sure had nevertheless seen him – and actually made it in a few minutes to the lake.
Draco didn’t know what to say. He would have never guessed… any of this. “I’m sorry.”
When Severus opened the door, Draco found a large group of Adults trying to calm down the crying baby, of which Draco hadn’t gotten a good look. McGonagall turned around and seemed relieved at the sight of Draco.
Harry grinned. “Right? Someone who’s afraid of losing power to an
Harry nodded, rubbing his forehead. “Yes, just give me a few moments.”
“Big deal. It’s not like anyone cares about it” Harry chuckled.
Draco handed him his fork and kept a careful eye on Potter. However, the toddler had somehow managed to work out how forks were supposed to work and grabbed a small piece of tomato skillfully. Once he placed it into his mouth, he tilted his head and started to laugh quickly after.
Teacup,
“There is always work to do, Harry! Besides, I heard you guys got Eastoft! Congrats!” Hermione grinned, while Harry rolled his eyes.
“Thank you for telling me Dray. I have feelings for you as well and I would like to see where it goes. As for that other thing…” Harry smirked, pretending as if it wasn’t such a big deal. “Just think about it that way: If we would have been together before I was turned into a baby, you would have taken care of me as well, right?”
Oliver held up his hands in mocked defeat and chuckled. “Of course, Draco. Can you go and grab the owl, young man? You can take him home right now, if you’d like to. I’ll give you the booklet of what you should do to help him get over his past.”
Potter smiled slightly. “Well, I have been working in... or rather studying law. I stopped after just one semester and decided to do something different with my life. You see, I should have accepted the path my parents made for me. However, I just couldn’t do it anymore.” After a few seconds in which Draco wasn’t sure if he should comment on anything, he continued again, looking rather normal. “I’m also much happier here than I would have been in law.”
Chuckling, Draco got up, went over to the TV he had hidden in the corner and placed his favorite movie in there. When he turned around, Harry held a bowl of popcorn up. “I figured you’d want to watch your favorite movie, so I brought snacks.”
“Draco, yes. It’s me.” Draco chuckled. “It’s the eighth largest constellation in the night sky. When I was a child my mother used to tell me that I could do something amazing that would also catapult me to a status of famous wizards.” He sighed and nestled into Harry’s side again, trying to say what he wanted to say as quietly as possible, so Harry wouldn’t hear it. Even though he really wanted him to hear it. “Never thought it would be for being on the wrong side of war.”
Draco smiled down at his ward. “You want to learn how to play the piano? Why?”
Harry laughed and shook his head. “You can try!”
“No, because this one is actually going to help you, you idiot.”
Chuckling to himself, Harry walked to the door and turned around, one last time. He saw Draco pointing something out on the map and quickly looking up and shooting him a smile. Harry grinned and closed the door behind him. Oh what he would give right now to end this day in Draco’s arms, enjoying whatever wine his husband had chosen for the night, listening to some jazz. That would have been the perfect ending to such a day.
“If I had the strength left, I would probably hunt you around the garden, but…” he yawned, while Draco chuckled.
Draco sighed and pulled his ward into a hug. “I don’t have an answer for that, bear. I think it might be because you’re still growing up? So the dream somehow intercepted your reality…”
“Nothing!” Harry grinned, and bit his lower lip in an effort of keeping it together. Which he didn’t manage at all.
Harry looked down at him and frowned slightly. “How do you know it’s Connor?”
Before he could start with the client room, his phone vibrated and he took it out to see a text from Ginny.
Weasley frowned. “Why wasn’t he in our lessons?”
Draco was quiet for a few moments, until he frowned and shook his head. “It’s far too early for something like that, Harry. What is that even supposed to mean?”
Despite everything that had happened, Draco had to laugh. That was the best idea Pansy had ever had! “Yes! A thousand times yes, Pans! Where do you want to live, though?”
Harry shook his head and pouted. “You’re already in my arms! I am not letting you go!”
He huffed and shook his head. “Guys, leave him alone. I don’t want him to be scared because he thinks he’s seeing double.”
The former Gryffindor shook his head, flabbergasted. “It’s
Neville chuckled and shook his head, kissing the top of Pansy’s head. Draco watched Harry smile weakly and then turning back to his other friends. There was something in his eyes, something like… jealousy? How had he never seen something like that?! Maybe Harry was just too tired to hide his true emotions… Or maybe Draco was just interpreting everything wrongly!
The other Gryffindor beamed. “Thanks, Harry! It means a lot coming from you!”
Theodore raised his eyebrows at her and she sighed and motioned him to go on. “The Muggles call it something like the unconscious brain. So, all the information is still there, yet not ready for him to tap into.”
Smirking, Harry sat at the edge of a huge bathtub – it was more a small swimming pool. His legs were in the water and he played with it, happily splashing it around. Suddenly another loud splash made both men look over to the corner, where a small dog pool was situated, where Padfoot enjoyed his water. The room really did know what Harry wanted to have here.
Harry shook his head. “How did Hermione get her hands on a potion like that?!”
“Ethan came by and we drank a few beer! Nothing too bad” Lucas explained laughing.
Harry turned his head rather quickly towards her and shrugged his shoulders. “What do you mean? There’s nothing going on between him and me and I mean, we still hate each other.”
Well, yes, that convinced Draco rather fast. He agreed and Madam Pomfrey did the spell. The parchment that came out of this spell was rather uplifting, Draco thought. It basically stated that Harry had a normal and healthy body. Nothing was broken, no other problems, no illnesses and most of all: his body height was appropriate for his age.
“Draco, don’t turn to starve yourself over losing Harry” Theodore said. He was sitting on the opposite side of Draco and pushed some eggs and bacon closer to his plate.
“It’s probably just in your sleep-deprived state” Harry answered and dodged Remus wanting to push him a few steps back.
When he entered the shop, a sound of a few trumpets erupted and Harry winced, before trying to hiding his smirk in time for Malfoy to walk out from the back.
Draco wasn’t sure if he should comment on what he had seen, so he decided to check out the pub. It looked rather nice from outside. The rustic appearance seemed to be something that Potter had built on top of the normal structure.
Severus got up and turned to Draco. “Let’s get to work, Draco. We’ve had a few harder potions to make in class. I can tell you as well that one of these
Just then, Harry caught sight of Draco walking closer. Next to him – holding his hand – was indeed Raphaél, the tall light brown haired man from Canada. Harry had to bite back a triumphant smirk, deciding that a death glare was the best option for having spotted them. While almost everyone around him, even the smaller groups, turned to look into the direction Harry was staring at, he used that to see whether or not Raphaél truly was up for this. He seemed slightly nervous, though Draco seemed to reaffirm him that everything was going to be okay. The Canadian wore black suit bottoms and a rather nice fitting slightly grey shirt, which Harry had never seen him wear – actually nothing of that seemed like he would wear it on his own free will.
Smiling weakly, Draco shook his head. “This is supposed to be my question, Harry. It’s by far past midnight. Why are you still working?”
Draco chuckled and shook his head. “So, in order to keep it short, Harry: In being your Magical Guardian, I hope to get a second chance with being your friend. And speaking of Magical Guardian: We figured out that your relatives weren’t nice to you. That’s why we go to Madam Pomfrey. She checks whether or not everything’s okay with your body and whether or not you can grow up properly.”
Shrugging his shoulders, Harry was still grinning. “I don’t know. I mean, looking at the flat doesn’t mean you have to take it…”
“Tell me what you find, love. I don’t think I’ll be able to sleep before you’re both back.” Eric sighed. “And be careful. Aurora wouldn’t walk with you if it’s safe.”
“That wasn’t part of the questioning. Two or three, which one do you think is wrong?”
Draco sighed and nodded. “Let’s just get this year over, Pans. I can’t wait for us finally graduating!” And leaving this place, where he had just too many memories of either him hurting Harry or the little Gryffindor playing and joking around. Well, he didn’t say that last part our loud, but he was sure Pansy knew exactly what he thought.
His friend smiled, softly. “You need some help.”
“Okay, how about... ‘In the forest, he lost sight of his older brothers.’”
Sighing, Draco answered honestly. “I will come home, Neil. In a few weeks, I promise.”
“So I’ve heard!” Harry chuckled. “Hermione’s really looking forward to getting to work with you. I have never seen her talk about it that much… well, no. That’s a lie. But you know what I’m talking about.”
Panting heavily, Harry opened his eyes, seemed to be very confused and sat up in his bed. He faced the wall and shook his head, looking around until he found Draco.
“Thanks, Dray!”
Finally, Daphne cleared her throat. “Okay, Harry can we talk about the obvious thing here?”
Draco widened his eyes in mocked innocence. “I have no idea what you’re talking about. But pray tell what do you smell right now?”
Draco ran a hand through his hair and smirked. “In a heartbeat!”
It was another Saturday evening, Luna and Ginny would be coming over tomorrow. Harry didn’t know when exactly, not that Draco cared much about it. He had already placed a comfortable looking chair into the library and decided he was going to spend his day down there, researching. None of the books he had picked up so far had revealed anything. He was currently reading through the Museum looking side of the family library. These books were so old that they were spelt, so that they wouldn’t crumble to dust.
Sighing, Draco looked back over the lake. That was a very good question. He hadn’t understood it himself yet, though he knew it deep inside his heart that he’d finally had enough of the Ministry.
“There’s a rumour floating around Hogwarts that Harry’s a Slytherin now?” he asked rather quietly.
Laughing, Harry shook his head. “You’re with another Auror, Ron. Calm down.” He smirked and shook his head. “Nott doesn’t play around.”
Laughing, Draco shook his head. “Yes, that’s okay, don’t worry. I think you’re just fine.”
“It is something, Harry and we’re going to Madam Pomfrey, right now!” Draco stated and got up. This also brought Pansy back out of her trans-like state and she got up as well.
Sighing, Draco held up his hands. “No, I’m not talking about Jason. Your husband’s different.”
Well, that someone was certainly Harry. He wasn’t a good singer, but it also wasn’t bad. Draco smirked and looked around the room for his own clothes. After a few moments, a knock at his door made him go and open it. In front of him stood Pansy and Theodore.
Draco held his hands up and sighed. At the same time as Pansy said it, he echoed her with his own version of what was happening. “You want to have a big family and once Potter’s an adult, you’re going to add it to your huge collection of things you bought for Potter, but are going to keep for yourself. I know.”
They ate in silence for a while, until Harry started talking again. “So, what do you want to do after Hogwarts?”
Harry chuckled. “Well, the thought of adding rose pedals never crossed my mind until now, so you’ll have to imagine that yourself if you’d want that.” He splashed a little water over Draco’s trousers lying on the floor, only to receive a death glare from his husband.
Draco rolled his eyes, though he couldn’t stop grinning. “For you maybe.”
Harry smiled and sat down by his side, putting his arm around his shoulders and pulling him into a hug. Draco sighed softly and snuggled into his side, an arm around his waist, when he closed his eyes.
“Thank you, Neville. Been practising for a speech like that.” Harry smirked as the door opened that second and Blaise pulled Draco out, who was screaming swear words at the people listening to him.
“You know what I mean!”
“My heart is not for sale!” Bill said loudly, looking pointedly at his wife, who was still laughing and didn’t have time to calm down yet. The grin on his lips was proof that he knew there was no way a deal like that would even happen.
Harry laughed loudly and shook his head. He got up and motioned them to do so as well. “Severus told me to get all of you up to the Great Hall. The ceremony is about to start and they want all of us there as well.”
An owl suddenly drew his attention away from his depressive thoughts and he got up, sighing. Opening up the window, he found his mother’s owl. “Great.” The owl probably didn’t understand his sarcastic wording. He still shrugged his shoulders and turned to the drawer to get some owl treats.
Ginny helped me with making the house service dog accessible. I cannot believe she’d do something like that for me! I’ve given up on life, I think. But now, I have something to live for again. I will fight again. For my cute angel on four legs Nora. Thank you Ginny! You are my very own savior.
“When did you first realize something was wrong?” Draco asked and pulled the booklet closer.
Draco seemed to want to convince him that there was in fact nothing wrong with him. Harry knew better. He leaned closer and pressed a soft kiss on his lips. Making sure that Draco was aware that he loved him. There was nothing he wouldn’t do for him. Absolutely nothing.
When Draco was being pulled into the room by his ward, he passed by Hermione and she smiled apologetically. “Anyway, thank you. And I’m really sorry about Ron’s behaviour.”
“Oh, I didn’t start” Harry snorted. That was all the fun he was allowed to show if he wanted to keep them from seeing how much he enjoyed this.
Draco’s godfather either didn’t care enough to say something else or decided to ignore them. He turned to Draco and nodded what seemed to be a quite formal greeting. “Zabini would like to request your return to the Common Room. Some sort of accident happened.”
This made the Slytherin laugh, when the door was opened again and Draco Malfoy walked in with his friend Pansy Parkinson in tow.
Harry walked around the corner, heading to the Great Hall for breakfast, and was immediately yanked behind a portrait. He almost yelled something, when Draco held his mouth closed. The Slytherin smirked and shook his head. Harry was happy that he had told Hermione and Ron to go ahead, they would have immediately jumped after him, had they see that happening.
Oh, how Harry would have loved to tell him off. He really couldn’t, since that would have been far too obvious. He just hoped that Draco would stay in the library and that the library would keep him hidden. “Sure. But I would like to know why you think he could be here? The only time I really left the house was when I visited him or rather, when I tried to see him.”
That also means that had the MGT been done in another place, another wizard could have been chosen to be Harry’s guardian.
Draco sighed and rolled his eyes. He had to tell King the truth. He was only allowed two more days, before he was expected to go back. So, at least he had to tell him that he had found Potter in Scotland.
Draco nodded and sniffled again. “I didn’t take the potion, because I thought it would be too much for you. Taking care of five children, then.”
When Harry saw Draco enter the room again, he pointed to a few letters. “Draco what’s this?”
Madam Pomfrey seemed to understand what he wanted, without him having had to say something. “Well, the Injury Parchment provides us with the necessary information about his past and luckily, we can fix whatever is broken.” She smiled, while Draco nodded, still slightly confused. The mediwitch continued. “So, what we’re doing now… or rather what I
“Do you think we can find out who they were?”
“Harry! Did something happen? I’m sorry, my magic must have stopped working... Is everything okay?” Draco asked, honestly scared that Harry had hurt himself or something.
Oh. Harry smiled warmly. “I suppose he didn’t have your permission to call you that.”
“You are not responsible, Harry. What has you this guilty?” Draco smiled, hoping it seemed trustworthy and that Harry would continue talking. Why would he think he was responsible? And what meant ‘everything’?!
“Oh come on! That man is an open book! He tells everyone who wants to listen, that his childhood was traumatic!”
“A game?” Harry frowned and sat up straight. The amused expression on her face could only be a bad sign. McGonagall placed the parchment in front of him. There was a hint of a smirk on her face and Harry narrowed his eyes. He looked at the parchment and saw on top written ‘BINGO’.
“Yes.” Draco said that without even waiting a beat and Harry smiled at him, softly, squeezing his hand for which he received a squeeze in return.
Harry stopped and turned around to Kevin: “Did you already run a check for Alisha? She put her profile down yesterday and I think Malcolm would be a nice pair. I’m not sure, yet, but can you check them?”
Harry walked over and carefully pushed him on his back, lying on top of him. “I would never tell you to do something, love.” With that, he kissed him softly.
“What were you saying, Ze?” Harry asked with a rather cocky attitude.
Both Slytherin stopped what they were doing and turned to Potter who grinned at Draco. “Dray!” He shook his teddy bear, before hugging it. The Gryffindor looked as if he had just had a revelation.
“You think this is funny?” Draco asked, though Harry was in no state to answer and it made Draco chuckle as well, completely forgetting how he had hit his head.
“I did. I was going to come home for lunch and ask what you wanted to do. In all honesty, I would have gone and told them to keep out of your love life since they don’t own you. But you have to tell me what you want me to do.”
When he looked at Potter, he saw him quickly jerk up, but yawning and snuggling closer into his arms. “I know you’re tired, bear, we’re almost there.”
Smiling softly, Harry placed a kiss on his cheek. “Thanks, darling.”
“Right. Longbottom, a talk please” Draco said as he composed himself again. What Ginny said and how everyone seemed to be genuinely okay with him around them and especially with Harry in Slytherin, meant more to him that he wanted to admit. Out loud that was.
He walked closer and Draco shuffled to the side so Harry could sit on the chair as well. He was so close... The smell of cinnamon and rose was definitely coming from him and Draco had suddenly quite a lot of trouble focusing on the piano.
“But Aunt Bella tried to kill… all of them! She tortured Granger for Salazar’s sake!” Draco remembered the screams in the Manor, echoing through the halls and the whole house actually. He had wanted to run then. He had wanted to free Potter and his friends and make a run for his own freedom. But he couldn’t. There had been Death Eaters everywhere and his father had known him too well. Positioning him in his room and he stood at the door, checking up on him.
“Can you take away Dumbledore’s magical core restrictions on Harry?” Alamar asked and looked at Harry, who was peacefully asleep, while Aurora slept equally as peacefully on his legs. It was a cute picture, though Eric needed to concentrate on something else.
“Hey Harry” a female voice said. Luna! Harry relaxed slightly, before another thought entered his mind.
His best friend apparently wanted to say something, also because he had once again used ‘darling’ to talk to her. He knew full well that she hated it, even though she called everyone darling. Well, she apparently decided against it, since she rolled her eyes and turned back to the book in her hands.
Henry shook his head. “You’re going to ruin yourself if you keep paying for stuff yourself, Harry.”
Just because Ron got promoted to Vice Head Auror a few months ago, doesn’t mean that we’ve forgotten about you. Heal your hand, get yourself together again, and we’ll see you in a few days.
Draco nodded. “They definitely went through some hard times.” He remembered Aunt Bella torturing Hermione in his Manor and bit his lower lip, turning to the food. “Looks like we need to talk to Harry once dinner is over.”
Nodding, the Gryffindor went back inside and was back rather quick with Potter’s two best friends. “See you around” Longbottom waved and was gone.
Before he could get up, Harry held his arm back and smiled tiredly. “Can you stay with me? I’m not that… strong.”
Harry snorted and turned to look at his dog, who was still happily chewing the bone. She seemed to calm and it made him happy to know that she was also being looked after.
to see what it was.
It was Molly Weasley.
“Perfectly alright. That means I get to see Draco more often, since I can be here when he’s here as well.”
“What’s going on, Harry?” he asked quietly, rubbing his back.
“It certainly would look like that if we weren’t alone” Harry said, pressing another kiss on top of Draco’s head. “Messing with our classmates who think it’s okay to use our relationship as a basis of whatever game they were playing… that was fun.”
Once they were all gone – the two other Aurors as well, Kingsley started talking again. “Harry’s relatives have been placed in magical care; however, we believe that there is no hope for any of them. His uncle is but a vessel of himself and his aunt has had some serious trauma as well. Once Harry’s grown up, you might have to tell him what happened.”
As Draco entered the Common Room with Harry trailing behind him, he held the door open and his ward skipped through it, happy to see his friends again. Draco thought it was just too precious when he ran up to Millicent and asked her whether or not they could go outside and play in the snow. It had snowed over night again and in the secret garden, there was tons of new soft white snow.
At the same time, Draco cancelled the spells, Harry started yelling at him and Neville opened the door, forcefully pulling Harry out while Padfoot looked slightly spooked and followed them as well. When Neville finally closed the kitchen door, Harry pulled his arm back and glared at him.
“You two make quite the pair, Sirius” Evelyn remarked.
There were five cauldrons neatly stacked on each other, a wooden rack which was full of magically preserved ingredients stood in the middle of the room under a what Draco presumed was a magical plant lamp. It was stronger than the other three lamps in this rather big room and the plants that were alive on the very top of the rack seemed to enjoy it.
Harry snorted and quickly recounted what their discussion had been like. Draco laughed loudly and shook his head. “And here I thought I had to make the first step to make it look like we hate each other! You’re a genius, Harry Potter.”
Frowning, Draco watched Potter a little closer. Had he ever not jumped at the idea of bickering and fighting with him? This feeling of… not arguing with Potter was new. And he didn’t like it. Draco looked at the curtains on the ground, barely touching the stone and moving softly in the nightly breeze from wherever that wind came from.
Once again, McGonagall explained what her intentions were with this room and how proud she was of it. Apparently, a lot of students came here to learn or study about the history of Hogwarts.
The man chuckled and looked around. His soft laugh was so warm and welcoming as if he was hugging Boy only through his vocal cords alone. When he finally looked back at Boy, he still had a soft and honest smile. “Well, I’ve seen you working, ever since we moved into that house” he pointed at Mrs. Figg’s old house. “And I think I saw your family drive away and leave you outside. So, I wanted to ask: Are you okay?”
Harry sighed. “I was actually hoping you’d come with us, because I am slightly frightened of what... everyone will say there.”
Pansy was furious, when she once again screamed so loud, Harry was afraid she would be losing her voice by the end of the week. “Because you made his hair different!”
On the bar sat another younger man. He had black hair, almost as black as Potter’s himself and was in the middle of a story talking to the Gryffindor who kept interrupting him to through around some mildly amusing comments.
Draco smirked and crouched down. “I love it! It really suits you!”
“So, six years and he’s only your boyfriend?” Ron asked and finished washing the dishes.
Harry felt safe here!
Harry tried his hardest to bite down the smirk and shook his head. “Isn’t there supposed to be some truce between us, Malfoy?” His former last name came out so much easier now.
“Or I just don’t care much about them, because you are the only place I can call home.”
Charlie nodded. “Suit yourself. Pansy?”
Harry rubbed his eyes and looked up at Draco through his tears. Some were still running down the side of his face into his hair. “Why is my life so fucked up?”
“I don’t think so” Harry said behind Draco and with some magic rushing through the air, their Kneazel floated through the air and landed on his feet next to the invisible wall. “How did you even get up there? Honestly, I think we have a circus animal here.”
“Nope, you don’t!” Harry shook his head and ran towards Pansy, hugging her.
Draco chuckled, as he let Potter play with his hand. “I saw that he has nightmares last night. And I think I’ve realized that I have nightmares as well and that maybe we’re not that different.”
The yellow parchment copy was a document he had gotten through some secret help and with huge letters, there was a
Harry got up. “What if Neville has to drag me out of here, because I want to run at you? There are still people outside, right?” he asked and his friend nodded.
“What, no!” Harry shook his head. “I... This... You just told me? Just like that?”
Pansy grinned. “It’s Potter, Draco. When has he ever done something usual?”
Draco grinned and opened a door quickly, peering inside, before he pulled Harry with him. “You’re mine for the rest of the night” he declared and pulled him into a passionate kiss once Harry had closed the door.
Pansy chuckled, entered his room and closed the door behind her. “Dray, we’ve been friends for so long! Do you really think you can keep something like that from me?”
Alamar chuckled. “We’re in Russia. In Sviyazhsk to be exact. Eric needs to confirm our arrival first and then we can move on and finally hide from stupid people.”
As a vampire, Alamar would be shipped back to Croatia or wherever they thought vampires were from. And once he was shipped back there, he was in the system. No creature wanted that. There had only been a few reports of creatures who survived and ran away after years inside it. What they said wasn’t good.
After Draco read the letter Weasley sent to Potter he had some new clues. The Weasel knew Potter was staying in Edinburgh and that was one month and a few weeks ago. So Potter really must be in Scotland.
Snorting, Harry nodded and carefully ran one of his fingers over the shirt on the right side. It was rather prominent even if the color was more at the bottom and shouldn’t be seen easily. However, the slightly green shirt let the red color stick out extremely.
“In all honesty, I think you see more people who go there as a last resort, don’t you think?” Draco asked and seemed to have relaxed quite a bit from the earlier questions.
Turning back, Graeme vanished the potion and turned back to Draco and Severus. “And with that, the blood adoption is finished. You are now officially family. The physical changes to your will take place over the next week, so don’t be alarmed.” The Minister nodded once and spelt the parchment dry again, before he turned back to Draco. “In actuality, Mr. Snape, if the adopted person is off age, sometimes there aren’t any changes, just so you’re not surprised if nothing happens. The blood adoption has more effects when it’s performed on children.”
They were quiet for a while and Draco had a weird feeling that Harry was looking for a reason to receive a hug. He made a mental note to hug his ward a few more times. Well, he was definitely also looking for answers about the thing that was going on in his head with Jeremia and all the other boys.
“I believe Dumbledore showed him all the memories so he would be prepared for what would happen in the future. I mean, he is sixteen years old now, right? In sixth year… Dumbledore died. He knew since the beginning of the year that he would die. At least with all the memories given to Harry, someone else could finish what he couldn’t.”
The war has certainly had its toll on everyone, especially you. I am sorry if the trust you had in your family was buried once your father invited the Dark Lord into this house. So, I am hoping we could meet and maybe have our relationship back to a somewhat normal mother-son-relationship.
“Do you see the star over the lake, on top of the mountain there?” he pointed to the shadow under a particularly bright shining star. Harry nodded and Draco smiled. “That’s called Gamma Draconis.”
“Harry is married!” Ron stared at Draco with wide eyes.
Draco smirked and shrugged his shoulders. “If I’m going in, you’re going in as well. I just hope you have brought some extra clothes for you as well.”
No, the true joy of watching people was when you were somewhere you didn’t know anybody and you could just sit there and do nothing – well, except for people watching. Not that they had any time to do that.
“Come here, Draco. This potion will turn you back into a human” he held out the potion and the dog walked closer. He sat down and looked up, trying to get the vial into his paws. “No, I need to give it to you, unless you want to lick it from the ground?”
Harry chuckled at the surprised look of his best friend. “Did Molly honestly not tell you I’d be bringing my boyfriend? I asked her if that would be fine!”
The other Gryffindor in the kitchen laughed and rolled his eyes, while Harry whistled for Padfoot. Draco ruffled his fur while he walked by and stepped back deeper into the kitchen. Meanwhile, Neville grabbed Harry’s arm and looked at Draco, who raised his wand.
