“I can find my own way,” Draco says cooly. “Professor, since you’re disallowing me to leave, who will fix the hazards left in the corridor?”
be seen by his friends. Harry cuts out the new article with himself and Malfoy in it, and makes sure to spell-hide all and any incriminating items.
But despite this affirmation and reassurance, the dragon lurks under his skin, threatening to clog his throat.
Pain radiates at every step, but Draco doesn’t slow down until he’s under the cover of the Forbidden Forest. Tall trees leave the Forest dark and murky despite the daylight. His breath visibly condenses in the air. It must be cold, but he’s hot, smoke licking up his throat. He manages to tug off his robes in time before the transformation takes over. Bones break into new bones, break through his skin, new organs grow and new skin and scales stretch over his body.
The first time he had transformed was at the Manor after the War. When the fear had subsided, and the War Trials over. His father had tossed some words, and Draco had tossed some words back and they dissolved into an argument over the dining table.
Draco gets up early to see the few Slytherins who are heading home for their Winter Break. He hands them two new protective badges. He also pats the thestrals pulling the carriages.
The four Eighth Year Slytherins gather in their dorm room. After Draco tells the context to Blaise and Harry, Harry makes a grumpy expression.
“What’s with that expression?” Lucius says sourly. “Even if Draco did fight Greyback, it’s over and done with! You should be congratulating him.”
Sorry about the “snapshot” nature of the scenes *sweats* I just feel like it’s important to see multiple aspects of various things coming together~
Harry slaps Draco on the arm. “We have so many things to do. I almost feel like we should adopt Hermione’s planning system—”
slightly?!!! More than once, Solicitor Malfoy would cross his arms, such that his ring hand and finger would be in clear display…
“No, no, I’m fine.” Harry puts his book on the bedside table along with his glasses, and closes his eyes.
Official #2 looks back towards where the castle should be, to where Gryffindor Tower has fallen over. “The public is not going to be happy about this…”
Harry tries, but his control of magic has never been that fine. By the time Draco returns to him, Harry’s face is contorted with frustration.
Draco smooths his robes, Slytherin crest clear. “Right now, I believe that my actions are optimal at ensuring the safety of the Slytherins. Is there anything else you wish to discuss? Otherwise, I must return to matters of Slytherin House.”
“Professor Garren’s coming,” Felicity says, face dark, hand worrying the thick braid over her shoulder. “He’s heading down the stairs as we speak.”
There’s a rare emotion in his chest. Regret. Did announcing his challenge help? Was it just a temporary reprieve before it gets
Hitchly pales, and then goes red with anger. “Wow, the MInistry is fucking corrupt! All you Order of the Phoenix people!”
And it turns out that his worry is unfounded. All his Slytherins return safely for dinner that night, as they will continue to the following nights. Perhaps, without all the winding corridors, it’s harder for other students to carry out sneak attacks. Perhaps, the professors are making a greater effort to watch over the students. Perhaps, the collapse of Hogwarts has become a bonding mechanism.
Ginevra looks like she’s going to stand up and attempt to punch Draco from across the table. She stops though when Lovegood wraps a hand around her arm.
Draco ends up cleaning up some flooding in a corridor; spelling away graffiti from the walls along another corridor. However, Filch stops him when he points his wand at a defaced portrait.
Draco pulls his pile of presents closer, because he’s next. Among other things, there’s jewellery from his parents and Blaise. Aster has given him a complex text on potions, and Nolan gifted him a small silver dragon charm. The small silver dragon moves languidly, curling itself around Draco’s thumb like a large ring.
Draco, however, doesn’t take it immediately. “Harry, do you think we should have tried harder to keep Slytherin as part of Hogwarts? Suppose we never splitted. Suppose we kept that Unspeakable and any other Ministry people
Today is the last full day of the school year. Tomorrow, the graduating seventh and eighth years will get to leave via the enchanted boats across the lake.
The Gryffindor entrance opens and Ginny and Luna appear. “Oh, Harry, you’re here?” Ginny says. “Wanna play a Quidditch game?”
If that was someone from Gryffindor who fell...If it had been a Slytherin who had sabotaged the staircase...
Harry’s eyes are bright as the light catches on the ring on his hand. He takes the ring from the box and holds Draco’s hand carefully as he slips Draco’s ring on.
,” he chides it. He scorgifies himself, and gives Potter and Hagrid a refined nod. “Have a good day, Professor. Potter.” It takes a bit of pushing to leave the thestrals, but Hagrid and Potter don’t stop him.
Draco said nothing. Instead, he topped up Harry’s glass. “Harry, try this.” He picked up a morsel of food and delivered it to Harry’s mouth.
The other students are just about to look at them when Harry and his crew appear at the doors. Harry has a ridiculous pointy red hat on his head and a sack over his shoulder.
It doesn’t help that some students like to come and watch, making comments about what they would have done different, spouting off basic spells they’ve just learnt as though they’re now experts in magical castle building.
“That we were thinking of establishing a private Slytherin dueling practice club, now that we have duelist extraordinaire, Harry Potter,” Draco lies.
he’s not going to enter with ‘the boy who lived’ back-door pass…But he knows she means wells, so he eats the food that Draco packed for him quietly.
“Okay…” Harry blushed, unable to look at anyone’s faces as he sat down on Draco’s lap, his back against Draco’s chest, his heat tucked under Draco’s chin. Harry’s hole ached, knowing that Draco’s cock was so close, separated by only a few layers of fabric. It didn’t help that the other Weasleys were bustling about.
.” Malfoy rolls his eyes and Harry smirks back, barely registering what the rest of the group are doing.
Potter’s mouth turns down. “You’re welcome, Draco and the others make them...You...you can come to Slytherin, you know. You don’t have to resort, just move down to Slytherin. You don’t even have to go back to Gryffindor. The house-elves are happy to move your things safely.”
“I’m fine,” Harry says pre-emptively. “I’ll see you later.” He and Creevey head to the Gryffindor table, where Granger and Weasley await.
Various Gryffindors are lazing around the common room. They all look at Harry with complicated eyes. A student who Harry recognises from the morning after the full moon looks away.
, are the confusing thoughts tugging at him. Fire licks at his fingertips, and his back aches for phantom wings.
“Now, what service do you wish from Gringotts?” Malfoy asks as they walk back to the apparition point.
In the now quiet Great Hall, Professors McGonagall, Flitwick, Garren, Sprout and Hooch gather on the front stage, examining the three remaining banners.
With an inward sigh, Draco stands up and moves to sit between Nolan and Harley. Both of them give Draco wounded looks.
Malfoy’s eyes are breath-catchingly close, and they’re looking at him, silver lit up in flashes by the lights along the way, and Harry wonders what would happen if Harry’s just a little closer—
But this was the first time Harry had ever seen Draco’s ankles. He could hardly believe how delicate they looked—that they were hiding under Draco’s boots the entire time.
Meanwhile, Weasley’s suspicion of the dishes on the table hasn’t gone away. “That’s curry, right? I hope it’s not spicy, it looks spicy…”
She starts off with normal diagnostic spells, then proceeds to increasingly archaic ones. Some of them check his blood. Those are very refined spells, for figuring out who is pureblood and who is not.
Actually, Harry had a bag with expandable wizarding space too—Hermione had a side-company that produced them following on from her beaded handbag. Even Draco’s had Hermione’s company’s insignia. It was just that Harry rarely went out to Wizarding places, so he always forgot; and if he went shopping in Muggle places, it was too conspicuous, and better to just cast a spell to lighten any shopping bags instead.
A number of people pointed out the subtle vibes of [daddy] dom Draco and wishwars reminded me that I have a fic that has dom Draco!! It’s called
There are two ways to do it: one is to use their wand to cast various spells and wards. Felicity and Pansy take charge of this. The second is to directly weave their own magic into building around them, but this is only suitable for the older students who have more magic under their control, since the nature of the direct injection means that it’s not under the confines of a neat spell.
“I’m one of those Slytherins, Mason,” Harry says sharply. He crosses his arms. “Now, go, before I tell McGonagall.”
a certain someone in Slytherin whose name starts with B has talked to them some more) because a breakfast table appears in the Slytherin Commons, complete with teas and coffees and the enticing scent of fresh, delicate pastry.
The thestral herd splits up. Pansy and Blaise and the bulk of the herd head to the far side. Their job is to ambush and take out Greyback’s followers.
“Very well, we won’t establish a practice club,” Draco says. “How was your date with Weasley? Did you enjoy Madam Puddifoots?”
Meanwhile, in Potions’ class, Draco is once again working with Potter on a partnered brewing exercise.
Draco folds the letter up neatly, seals it with his personal seal, and heads to the owlery to send it.
“Good evening, Pansy, Draco,” he greets, the corner of his mouth upturned in a cool, amused smile. “The elves are
Draco ignores her, and flags down Felicity Shafiq, seventh year prefect and in charge of going-ons outside Slytherin House. “Felicity, any information on Potter?”
Meanwhile, Pansy is smirking. “Very well, I’ll just date your ex-boyfriend instead, isn’t that right, Harry? Come to this side of the table, sit with me…”
“Wha—” Harry’s mouth dropped. “No, no way,” he blustered and flustered. Draco wanted to squish Harry’s cheeks for how adorable he was being.
“Yes, it was the new Potions Professor and Draco Malfoy,” one of the portraits in the corridor says. “We saw Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter and Blaise Zabini fix up the corridor. Good as new!”
Harry sits back as Hermione speaks. She has organised this meeting to discuss more effective measures of ensuring unity, and with all her determination and flush of success at securing this meeting, Harry hasn’t been able to tell her that Garren is
The building contributions from each house needs to be as evenly divided as possible, and that means Draco must
Potter frowns. “I don’t know if it makes me feel better. Maybe most of the Slytherins didn’t fight for Hogwarts. Or didn’t fight at all. But that’s not all your fault, is it? McGonagall forced you all to go back to the Dungeons.” He sighs heavily. “Would it kill people to be
Ginny’s eyes flash a mischievous light. “Harry told me he has some grandmaster plan to make things better.”
For a day’s work, it’s good progress, all of which is documented by an internal member on the Ministry team.
Draco smirks and pushes Harry along to be entertained by the younger Slytherins. Later, Draco will hear them compare the handwriting-correcting quills Draco gifted them all—of course, he bought different styles/versions for each person.
Draco turns to Potter now. “Potter, I’ll accompany you to the Library to retrieve your items. We need to talk about how you ran down here…”
The door opens with a clatter as things fall from Potter’s hands. “—Urk. Sorry!” Potter slaps a hand over his eyes.
And Lucius and Narcissa find out that they suddenly have a lot of grandchildren, out of wedlock, without Malfoy blood, and many of them only a few years younger than Draco.
Draco is very amused as the younger Slytherins make him sit down and take a break, even though moving the Slytherin Building wasn’t nearly as hard as it looked—Hogwarts did most of the effort.
Everyone should have their protective badges, but Draco sits such that he can keep an eye on everyone. Harry sits next to him, so obviously Granger and Weasley are also at his table.
Draco grunts noncommittally, purposefully not reminding Harry about Pansy. And Creevey isn’t the only person Draco is angry about. “Where were Granger and Weasley? Why weren’t they accompanying you back? They should know it’s not safe.”
they do.” The thestral moves from Draco’s hair to his arm. With a huff, Draco obligingly pets the thestral.
He’s aware that Pansy and Blaise are flanking him. He’s aware that Pansy has told Potter to stay back. He’s aware of Potter protesting to his own friends, their voices getting smaller and smaller.
“And, oh, good designs may also be considered for the rebuilt Hogwarts, and competent students may be able to participate in the rebuilding under professor supervision,” Professor Flitwick adds.
Potter’s cheeks go red. “What—you—no!” He hides his face behind the thestral leader, and asks her, “Hey, can
Harry’s eyes snapped up, a blush detectable on his brown skin. “What if I didn’t want to look at your stupid face? I bet those joggers are comfortable, aren’t they?”
“I should have bitten you,” Greyback snarls. “If the Dark Lord hadn’t stopped me, you would have been my little
The four of them head up the stairs of Hogwarts to McGonagall’s office. Draco enters the floo first, to open the connection to Malfoy Manor.
Narcissa smiles gently, but her eyes have no warmth. “Does the Ministry prohibit its citizens from writing a petition? But that cannot be, I surely remember a petition that was the instigator of a recent bill passed in the Wizengamot. Unfortunately, Ministry incompetence made a horrible mess. Who do they expect to clean it up?”
Pansy and Draco, who are currently seated on the Eighth Year throne sofa of black velvet and gold-gilt frame, both turn to them.
With a flick of McGonagall’s wand, the ring of lights around them brighten as lines of magic criss-cross the Hogwarts site, sparking more magic to spring forth.
Harry’s heart starts to throb in his chest as the next words spill from his mouth: “You would do that for your loved ones?”
“For all their actions, the Ministry is tolerating Aegis,” Draco says, lip curling in distaste. “The
McGonagall’s back is stiff, jaw tight. “I understand you and the Slytherins are undergoing rough times. But you cannot simply take Slytherin
Draco frowns. “Yes, Potter?” Potter had been having breakfast with Granger and Weasley at the Gryffindor table. Potter usually returns back to his side, but it’s typically with an expectant, warm expression, and not the current pout on Potter’s face.
I am here,” she says, looking at both Draco and Aster. “Come by again tomorrow, earlier if you please.”
His eyes widened. Who knows where he got it from, but Draco was wearing a loose night robe, with a deep vee opening putting half of his chest on display. There was only the lightest of scars... Draco’s long legs extended from under the robes, his skin exceptionally contrasting against Harry’s red and gold sheets.
Harry ignores Malfoy’s tone. “Thanks for the—” Harry lifts the chess set. “Have a good day, Malfoy.”
Garren is so disgusted that he can no longer teach NEWTs Potions, so McGonagall has had to call in a replacement Potions professor. Everyone rejoices, which is a more positive bonding experience than Harry&Draco’s PDA.
“Except both sides are getting raided,” Harry mutters. “This is a big mess. Why is there such a mess?” He stuffs the last of the chocolate pudding in his mouth. “Anyway, I better get going.” Across the Hall, there is only Draco and a handful of other Slytherins—the rest of the Slytherins have left already. Harry’s not surprised that sticky Nolan is one of the Slytherins remaining.
With that, he walks into the Forest. Only Harry and Nolan follow him closely; the other students indeed scatter a little in order to have some privacy in their transformation.
“Why, two students came and talked to us on a very similar topic just this morning! They were quite interested in certain descriptions, would you like to listen too?”
But Harry’s work at Magical Games and Sports was going well, and the Department recently had increased funding to support a wider range of sports, and aside from the increase in work, Harry still found it enjoyable.
: *tearfully* he's abandoned us (his parents) for his boyfriend!!! [[the cabbage we raised is getting eaten by a pig  (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻ ]]
“Like how Draco asks if the Slytherins are sleeping well. Like how he stayed back over the Winter Break, because there were other Slytherins who were staying back.”
Garren is one of the people helping to separate Ravenclaw Tower into different components, under the direction of Flitwick. Rather than being in command, Garren has to work alongside the students. He’s not even highly regarded as some of the ex-Ravenclaw alumni that McGonagall has called in.
Draco scowls, pushing away her hand. “If you’re so bored, Pansy, then shouldn’t you be working on the two-way communication function on the badges for me?” he says, raising an unimpressed eyebrow.
“No, young master Draco. Madame was reading this beforehand.” Tilly summons and gives Draco a copy of the
Draco’s jaw tightens. “About how I treated you negatively during our past years of Hogwarts. And how I incited others to treat you and others the same way. You’re right, it hurts. We are all students of Hogwarts, as chosen by Hogwarts. I had no right to debate your right to be here.”
Draco sits down at the Slytherin table, facing outwards. He gives Potter a raised eyebrow from across the Hall as he pours himself a cup of coffee. Potter scowls back weakly, more of a pout than anything. Draco smirks. No doubt Potter’s been thinking the entire night for a good comeback to Draco’s
Malfoy scoffs. “As though I wish to blend in with the hoi polloi.” His lip curls. “Many of them dress
“And the temperature charms are gone too,” Pomona realises, brows drawing together. “How did they hit the spell anchor…” She trails off.
(Draco likes his shoulders and chest, despite the scars. After Harry sputters out fervent apologies about the
Harry grabs Draco’s hand and makes him continue patting. “Yes. It was particularly useful in certain years.”
Harry greatly enjoyed each and every dish. More than once, Malfoy would order more of a particular dish, and then place it in front of Harry.
Potter’s guilty expression says everything. “I...forgot. I told Garren that it was my fault, but he gave you detention anyway.”
Harry’s eyes widened. He looked down, pressing a hand against his stomach. Just at that moment, Draco pulled out slightly and then thrust back in.
Blaise smiles self-deprecatingly. “If you are willing, the elves will move your portrait out of the castle as a safety precaution. However, the door must open first.”
Harry wanted to disappear on the spot, but there were Anti-Apparation Wards all over Diagon Alley for safety reasons. Panic spiked in Harry’s chest, his eyes searching desperately for a nearby Apparation Point, but he found none. There was nothing else he could do but
Draco smiles helplessly at them and closes the door. He walks back to bed, intent on gathering Harry up in his arms and hugging him tight to make up for the fact that Harry made him deal with the kids.
Harry shakes his head. “Not unless you decide to stay. We have some Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws who have moved down with us. Mostly siblings.”
He turns around to find Harry’s clothes on a messy pile on the floor and Harry reclining completely naked on their bed. Harry’s legs are parted, his hand draped over his inner thigh, close to but not quite touching his arse, which is dark pink and so fucking enticing. Draco could make a shrine to that arse, though for tax and censorship purposes, he should set up a religion to Harry Potter more generally…
Over the next few days, Draco joins teams of professors and seventh and eighth year students in mixed-House groups to levitate new stone into place, as supervised by McGonagall. As every stone is laid, it must be magically connected with Hogwarts itself, which can be done either by McGonagall, Draco and the other Head of Houses, and Blaise. Lee Jordan takes many pictures with great relish and sends them to all his favourite news outlets. The
Hitchly grits his teeth, forcing out a, “Understood, Head Auror. And have a good day, Head Auror, Auror Inkwood,” before he slinks away.
With each breath, he settles. The burning need to take the dragon form fades, as does the weirdness of the form itself: six limbs, counting his wings; the extra stomach filled with fire.
Blaise places a solemn hand over his heart. “No matter how far I go, Hogwarts is always my first love.”
There’s a slightly grey pallor to Aster’s pale skin. Draco makes a mental note to drag Aster out into the sun on the weekend.
Later that night, Harry sits on a familiar-yet-not sofa in the Gryffindor common room, holding his mug of hot chocolate against his lips.
Jamie glares at him and mutinously takes a bite of his biscuit, then another. The biscuit is crisp and sweet and very chocolatey, the way many Slytherins like it after Mr Malfoy all introduced them to fancy chocolate.
Before Harry has even finished talking, Draco is already getting out Harry's warm clothes. "Very well, I'll accompany you."
, Draco thinks to himself. He sits down on his belly and drapes his wings on the ground and stays still. Hagrid is the first to move, getting up close with awe.
In the adrenalin of Draco racing to find Harry, apparating him away from the Aurors to a dark empty alley...he burns to keep Harry close, yet Harry is annoyed at him.
Harry let out a loud cry of pleasure as sensation overcame him. Heat spread from Draco’s cock, come exploded out from his own cock, painting his chest in white. “Draco!”
At least dinner helps loosen Harry up again. Harry smiles naturally when Jamie comes by bearing a tray with two glass mugs of hot chocolate and a plate of cookies.
Narcissa and Lucius are sitting on one sofa, ropes pulling their hands behind their backs, their wands on the coffee table out of reach. Meanwhile four other Aurors lounge on the other sofa, clearly not doing any interrogation at all.
Mr. Malfoy’s hand is warm, and firmly pats his head, ruffling his fur and stroking down to his shoulders.
Even if...the snow balls keep melting in his hands, damn it. How can using his wand to form snowballs be called cheating??
The badges will have to be given out to most vulnerable students first: the Slytherin First Years. There are not many Slytherin First Years, making the few that entered his House all the more precious, regardless of their blood status.
“What, haven’t I played with you recently?” Draco pats its head and neck and flank. “Have you been practising your flying? Listening to your leader?”
Draco shoots a glare at the smirking Blaise as Mrs Norris presses herself against Draco’s chest, much like how Pansy does when they’re going to sleep.
Pansy tilts her head a little. Her eyes glint. “Now that you mention it...it doesn’t feel right that you’re sleeping alone on Christmas eve.”
“Hm.” Draco presses firmly against Harry’s prostate. Harry’s back arches, pulling his fingers deeper. Oh, how beautiful is that deep blush against Harry’s brown skin, crawling down Harry’s neck; how beautiful the spark of green as Harry’s unfocused eyes look to him; how beautiful the curls that tumble across the silken pillows.
Harry’s eyes lit up. His mind started to wander as he thought about what this gift Malfoy prepared for him could be.
He stands up, just as the Malfoy Genealogy Book on his desk flips open. Lucius’s eyes widen as the pages flick past till they reach the latest generation.
“Don’t take that tone with me, Potter,” Draco said, tapping Harry on the nose. “I expect to live to at least two hundred. A few years is a but a tiny drop.”
Mary sneers. “I sincerely hope you weren’t helping out Greyback that night,” she continues in a quiet, threatening tone.
Draco shrugs one shoulder. “You’ve known that for seven years, surely.” He pointedly sits his quill back in its little holder, steeples his fingers, and gives Harry a serious look.  “How may I help you?”
The thestral leader moves over to him. She nudges him lightly, while the other spread out, placing themselves between the Slytherins and the school.
Taylor immediately shakes his head. He knows the gossip about how close Hooch and McGonagall are, he’s not going to say anything to
“There are still hours of this event left,” Draco tells Harry. “Make sure you dance and think of me.”
dragon, Draco would be like a werewolf. Tainted blood. Less than human. Unreliable and dangerous. No family would want to marry their daughter to him.
Chatter fills the common room as the children do the serious business of choosing what gift they will open first.
Draco hands Granger the sheet of parchment McGonagall had previously given him—she didn’t say to return it, and it’s highly unlikely that Granger will use it to sabotage the school.
Jamie pouts. “You weren’t gone for that long, and I’ve definitely been good!” He looks at all the snacks that he has eaten already with his friends. “Um, should I ask the house-elves to make more of those chocolate-coffee brownies that you like?”
you wish to fight me?” Draco drawls, bringing the dragon closer to his skin, just enough to sharpen the points of his teeth, point his fingers. He’s glad that Harry’s behind him and can’t see this.
In fact, Narcissa does not mind overly much whether or not her son is homosexual. None of that matters, as long as he remembers his duty and ultimately marries a witch as he should.
: We’ll have to prepare for the wedding. My mother will not allow less than 500 guests. We can host it at Malfoy Manor or any other venue if you desire. What is the overall theme you would prefer? Overall colour scheme? Primary flowers?
In truth, he had become a children’s book author and illustrator. He painted wonderfully bright drawings and wrote happy, whimsical stories. His books were sold in both muggle and wizarding bookstores under the pseudonym of one of his titular characters, Mr Little Deer. (Though the muggle versions only had static pictures.)
Thoughts about terrorising muggleborns completely disappear, and Nolan dozes off in Mr. Malfoy’s calming presence.
He knows that will make them even more exposed. It’s not sustainable, and each of the eighth and seventh years will have to work harder. Already, he’s recruited some of the sixth years into escorting the lower years.
regretting trying to help the Aurors capture Greyback,” he says. “Catching him would make things better.”
Draco might have better luck convincing a cat to play with a cat tower instead of the boxed packaging it comes in.
“Come sit with us at the Gryffindor table,” Hermione says, “You haven’t spoken to Ginny and the others for a while, right?”
It wasn’t as though Draco had anything better to do. Harry had some earl grey chiffon, and he didn’t seem to like it very much.
husband,” Harry said. Was it just him, or had he accidentally unlocked sex-fiend Draco? Harry didn’t know whether to cry or to look forward to their future activities...
As usual, Professor Vector goes through the arithmancy, and then does a simple example for everyone to follow, then a more complicated example.
McGonagall goes on to ask him about how he’s doing, and Harry answers her truthfully. The Slytherins have been treating him well. He even shows her the milk chocolate bar Malfoy gave him. It’s his favourite flavour.
On one side, Harry in golden robes is being led by Arthur Weasley, followed by his attendants: Hermione and Ron.
, the best action. If something is broken, he prefers to take it apart before putting it back together. But he has grown up with the knowledge of Hogwarts, Hogwarts that has been standing for generations upon generations.
The Minister for Magic makes a light sound, calling attention to him. “During the Battle of Hogwarts last year, the Castle suffered damage and was rebuilt with the generous help of Hogwarts staff, volunteers, and the Ministry. The collapse of Hogwarts Castle is a tragic event. However, we can again rebuild the castle, restore our pasts and build for our future. There have been a number of teams who wish to lead the task in rebuilding. Today will be the start of the work by the team from the British Ministry, led by Wizengamot Member Holly Griffiths.”
It’s technically only symbolic: Slytherin has already been reintegrated when they revived Hogwarts. But that kind of integration is only visible to those like Draco who can sense Hogwarts’ magic.
Draco pours his mother a small cup of tea, then himself. He levitates his mother’s portion over before taking a sip of his tea. Its scent is lightly floral and sweet, its warmth dissonant with the mood in the tent.
.” He groans, then visibly forces himself to relax. “Forget it, we need to work out what to do with Slytherin.”
Blaise nods. “Then listen to Draco and myself.” Blaise’s eyes land meaningfully on Draco, and how Draco’s fingers rest against Hogwarts’ wall.
As per Blaise’s promise, he stands up to tell everyone exactly why the Ministry rebuilding attempt failed.
Draco pulls away from her grip. “Severus’s old office has private sleeping quarters. I could stay there.”
Draco quirks his lips slightly and reaches out to grab Harry’s wrist. “Don’t crash into the wall, Potter. You need to save your brain cells.”
Robards makes a note on the file and stands up. “Healer Murie, send me the final report as soon as possible.” He waves his wand, lighting up the Floo in his office. “In order to register Draco Malfoy and his dragon form, I will require Mr Malfoy to transform. This Floo has been temporarily routed to a very large room within the Ministry. Go through.”
Draco rubbed slowly, carefully monitoring Harry’s expressions. His fingers felt Harry’s prostate. He gently rubbed it and the surrounding area, slowly increasing the pressure.
Harry jerks back, causing Draco’s hand on his knee to slip. He doesn’t meet Draco’s eyes, mumbling, “I think they want to open their presents now.”
“I didn’t say you did,” Harry says innocently, though there’s a sparkle in his eyes. “Wow, Draco, are you comparing yourself with a toy?
Harry listens with half an ear. He’s not like Hermione, able to plan years into the future. There’s still Aegis to deal with, the wrong atmosphere in Hogwarts, and many of the jobs Hermione mentions is useless if Harry can’t get the scores required for them, and
talking,” Pansy says loudly. She levitates a mug of warm spiced pumpkin juice to Draco and Potter. “Drink. eat. You need to regain your energy after the blood sacrifice. And look—the first and second years worked
By the time Draco returns to the Slytherin Commons, the central firepit ebbs low. There are two figures, however. Potter, knees up staring at the flames, and Nolan who’s asleep on the couch.
Harry began to grow lightheaded, unable to figure out how to breath through his nose. HIs breath turned into pants, and at last, Draco broke the kiss.
“Hm.” Draco slowly sat back...showing off his long legs and pretty ankles and soft cock. “We’ll definitely be coming later.”
Draco goes out to greet the thestrals too. He smiles with exasperation when one young thestral bumps its head onto his shoulder.
started to permeate the flat. It wasn’t the same as when they were flatmates. It wasn’t the same when they were friends-with-occasional-benefits. Draco thought it was because they were different people now. They had both grown their separate ways. What he marvelled in was that they
Between Draco and Potter, they pet all the little ones. When one of them tries to pull Draco though, Draco has to firmly resist.
Harry hugs it and rubs his face against it. “Yep, it can! It’s nice and soft, no beard-burn at all.”
Finally, Narcissa summons a house elf. “Go and secretly watch over young master Draco,” she orders. “Do not let him be taken away by the Aurors!”
A moment later, Garren goes flying. His wand slaps into Draco’s free hand. Pain radiates across Draco’s chest, and for a beat, his heart stops. It starts again through the numbing cold of the stunner.
Nolan’s chest starts to get choked up as Harry and Draco walk over to him, and he’s not sure if the gilded open box in his hands—which contains the rings—is shaking or not. He smiles wobbly when Draco gives him a warm look.
being the key word, as he never finishes it: Ron goes off to the joke shop with George, and Harry ends up in a muggle baking masterclass. Malfoy, on the other hand, continues his mysterious training at the Ministry (he’s an Unspeakable, clearly), and can be frequently found in the Grimmauld Place library, the Malfoy Manor library, or flooing between the two. Sometimes, Harry will put his experimental baked goods on a plate near Malfoy, and watch from behind the stacks. Malfoy eats absently, and Harry giggles when Malfoy
Here lies Hogwarts’ centre, where the blending of the four Houses is strongest. Every stone they put into place needs to be integrated with the rest of Hogwarts’ magic by members of all four houses. Once they establish the basic connection, Hogwarts’ magic reaches out and wraps around the initial magic to complete the integration.
Nolan whimpers. Instinct makes him bow his head. Pride is the only thing stopping him from rolling over on his back and presenting his stomach.
Draco unconsciously thinks of Nolan and Francis and Jamie and many of the other young Slytherins. It’s all Harry’s fault for constantly teasing Draco about being their parent, and the dragon’s fault for thinking of them as his dragonlings.
Blaise casts a spell on the floor underneath Taylor and his friends. The floor tilts, becoming slippery. The Gryffindor students slide all the way down to the other end of the corridor. Pansy’s lips curl up.
Harry giggles. “Oh? So that beauty doesn’t come naturally?” He laughs when Draco rubs his head in retaliation.
“I have no intention of stealing your cat!” Draco tugs Mrs Norris away from him, and puts her down, but she ends up rubbing against his leg instead.
In fact, Harry didn’t feel cold anymore. No, he felt much too hot. But he was reluctant to take off the scarf that Malfoy had carefully wrapped it around him, and he was not going to tell Malfoy to remove his arm either.
Harry’s eyebrows go up, and he leans in close to Malfoy. It all looks right, though...and he smiles to himself. “I didn’t know you
Students from the other Houses look on in a mixture of envy and disdain at the Slytherins having a ‘party’. But they don’t make any big moves out of fear of the thestrals. They just talk among themselves. They don’t want to believe what McGonagall said.
going flying today.” He lowers his voice. “Didn’t I promise you I’ll feed you a lot of meat? You shouldn’t do something so rigorous as flying directly after a meal.”
Slytherin eyes narrow in on Ron. Harry clears his throat and leans against Draco, who technically isn’t part of the House-unity team, but is there because it involves people entering the Slytherin Building. “It’s a long story. I’ll tell you later.”
Lovegood doesn’t even blink as she sets down her own levitating crate, and dips one hand into it to grab a slick piece of unidentified meat. She continues to smile as she feeds a thestral. “I’m so happy the two of you have talked!”
to announce himself as the Head of Slytherin! He dared to act in the stead of Salazar Slytherin! Even Merlin, the great Slytherin, would not dare to act in Salazar Slytherin’s place! You! You and that damned Lucius brat! Is that how you raise children? I will not have Draco Malfoy on
“I’m glad you’re here, Draco,” Harry suddenly says quietly. “Don’t listen to what the papers say, I’m glad I saved you. You’re not
(Draco rarely wore anything short sleeve, not even in the house, even though they had already hashed out that Harry would live if he saw Draco’s Dark Mark.)
“Then how do you expect to put Slytherin back without the Ministry going up in arms? They can come and knock down your rebuilding plan.”
Draco hands up a food box and a flask. “All the food is kept warm, don’t worry,” he says. “And you forgot your scarf
, shocked creatures fleeing from the Dungeon’s path. The water becomes lighter and lighter, until the ground and
Draco rolls over onto the bed, clutching his heart. “You wound me, Potter, so terribly, the world is ending—”
The scale of the damage is much, much greater than what Draco has faced before during his rounds with Blaise. But the details he can see are also sharper. As his fingers rest against Hogwarts, a plan to fix each part coalesces in his mind.
Draco’s breath becomes a sharp hiss through his teeth. His claws dig into the stone floor as he pulls himself into a sitting position. He accepts Pansy’s hand to stand up.
“Hindering Aurors from capturing Greyback, wilful destruction of Hogwarts, contempt of the Ministry and obstructing justice. We are
Draco has to tug before Potter lets go of Draco’s robes. Potter flushes and mutters a sorry. “But they did
an owl,” Draco said. They parted ways, and Draco returned home. A little sad. A little nostalgic already, but feeling better for it.
“I’m Draco’s second,” Potter says, crossing his arms. His magical aura bleeds out, making the Hufflepuff grimace.
“I...with them. I’ll see you in Potions, okay?” Harry ducks his head guiltily and hurries up to join in with the Slytherin group departing the Great Hall.
While Hermione and Ron are being embarrassed, Harry takes the opportunity to detach from them. He grins as he trots up to Malfoy and Zabini.
In the end, Lucius scowls and proverbially throws his hands in the air. “Invite whichever riffraff you want, you’re
Pansy steps aside, allowing Hagrid to step out. Hagrid opens the box and a large soft dragon as big as him pops out.
“However, his magical levels are very low. Dangerously so.” Madam Pomfrey casts a few spells, settling some magic under Draco’s skin, but it doesn’t get absorbed. Madam Pomfrey sighs slightly. “I will cast some life support spells that will maintain his body while his magic slowly recovers. Move away, Mr Potter. ”
“Don’t you dare!” Narcissa snaps, snatching the letter from him. After she reads it, she and Lucius start arguing once more.
Harry’s smile widened. Happiness radiated from him. “Actually, I’m Little Deer.” He didn’t know what compelled him to admit that—well, maybe because he wanted to brag about it.
But he has to keep his expression happy and his words light, or else his reputation will drop even more. Oh, how he despises Draco Malfoy, a mere
Conservative wizarding newspapers bring Aegis out as an example to promote their anti-muggleborn agenda, while some other papers re-drudge up how the Death Eater sentences were so much worse, and not to mention, the Ministry is clearly covering up Draco Malfoy’s animagus form—until a reporter finds out that Draco Malfoy
” Draco’s wings beat to the side, glaring at the thestral that has nudged his side mid-air. Then, he rolls his eyes. It’s the thestral leader…
Harry was planning to jump straight into Aegis and Greyback and his anger about it all—but he bites down his words and forces out a smile instead, grabbing Ron and Hermione both into a big hug.
Harry grins as Jamie’s conversation starts to get more random. He raises his voice: “Everyone, eat your lunch and gather around! Let’s go over the renovation plan for the new Slytherin!”
According to the letters from Narcissa and numerous other parents of Slytherins, Aegis has been systematically targeting the houses of purebloods.
Michelle is more measured and mature in her thanks, and Alyss is shy. That’s okay, Michelle says that Jamie talks enough for the three of them.
on a date too! We ate in the rose gardens, and then we even went flying together! Oh, and Draco picked these roses for me! There are still many roses in the rose garden if you want, Draco basically bought twice as many flower bushes to make it more full.”
They mutually part ways, and Harry tries not to sigh. So much for House unity, when he himself can barely retain his friendships.
Inwardly, Draco sighs. They were supposed to use their Slytherin wiles to dominate their chosen fields, not to act spoiled and elicit sympathy!
Blaise walks alongside Draco to the tables laden with snacks and surrounded by groups of students from all the houses enjoying the garden, the snacks, and their company.
(Malfoy’s partial to earl grey and chiffon cakes. Harry’s partial to—he quotes Malfoy—the most sickly sweet desserts.)
While the older students get to directly help out, the younger students come together to think of more things they could add to the new castle. Word is that if you tell Jamie Ottley in Slytherin, then there’s a much higher chance of it being included. This leads to the introduction of many students to the house-elves of Hogwarts.
She turns to the Ministry officials. “You said you didn’t want Slytherin in Hogwarts. Now, there is no Slytherin in Hogwarts. Happy?”
“It is something we can now factor in,” Blaise muses. “In conjunction with your victory over Garren.”
“Recover well,” Flitwick says. He smiles and greets Pansy and Blaise, and goes to talk to Pomfrey before leaving.
Draco eventually captures Harry and solves their problems after a ~roll~ around in bed (and some communication!). After that, they can be seen walking hand-in-hand together.
Swiftly, Draco makes his way through the Manor, his magical senses flaring out. His lips tighten as he takes in the broken glass, smashed artifacts, and ripped portraits. The air is filled with the sizzle of magic, of
Lucius snorts. “No, it’s your fault! Who wanted to name him Draco? Who made him so weak that the Dark Lord decided to
Two certain students dressed in black muggle clothing came to the staircase on Friday, and left behind an unknown device that caused a magical ripple that some of the portraits could detect.
Harry tilts his head up and gazes at the semi-transparent projection of their future Hogwarts, an ache he didn’t realise was there now dissipating.
“That’s right,” Blaise agrees. “If we build Hogwarts, Hogwarts must agree. And Hogwarts won’t agree if Slytherin is not included. The rebuilding of Hogwarts must be organic, not rigid.”
, Taylor thinks. If Aegis can’t do it, he can’t do it either. It looks like Slytherin is here to stay.
:...Did you know I was almost sorted into Slytherin? *hand forms a fist* Malfoy will have to give me a head pat then! *runs off to the Headmistress’s office*
After their kissing, Harry rearranges Draco’s arms around him, and leans back against his chest. And stares into the fire.
“Rather than worry about that, you should worry about what you’re going to wear to our date on Sunday,” Draco says.
Draco Malfoy, but I’m quite sure that it was a student. And able to apparate through Hogwarts’ wards.”
After that, Blaise shows the 3D blueprints of the castle and begins opening the floor for everyone’s suggestions and begins modifying the blueprints immediately in response.
“It feels good, doesn’t it?” Draco said in a horse voice. “You’re so sensitive, Harry. You feel so good. Be good and come, okay? Show me your face…”
Draco leads the way downstairs. He can smell traces of his parents and the Aurors. He strides over to one of the side rooms and opens the door.
When the papers arrive, Draco can barely contain his urge to carry Harry back to the Slytherin commons.
thought about how Draco was able to find him so easily. This is because when Harry has the Map, he has no trouble finding Draco.
It was a rare Saturday that Harry and Draco could spend together. Draco wrapped his arms around Harry when he saw the frown on Harry’s face. “What is it?”
“Really? Is that true?” Charlie’s brows creased slightly. His gaze was directed at Harry’s face, avoiding Harry’s groin.
Draco continues talking with his friends, but half of his attention is on the mood in the Great Hall. The whispers that have been steadily growing. The ones about
“The construction itself was physically and magically sound,” another theorist says mildly. “Unfortunately, the unique magic of Hogwarts means that typical methods are not suitable.”
Draco briefly smirks at Harry’s antics, but then his face grows serious. “Are you sure? Hogwarts is falling around us. Of course, I’m not doubting your attraction to
“He should speak with my father, I’m sure they’ll get along, if it weren’t for the fact that they’ll hex each other.”
Harry entered the living room, carrying two mugs of hot chocolate. Draco was flipping through the new children’s books that Harry had recently bought as research. The fire crackled cheerfully in the hearth. When Draco looked up and smiled, warmth flowed in Harry’s heart. His heart started to thud as he thought about what he wanted to say...
“Recently, I made a new friend. Someone who I hated when I was first sorted. But it has made me realise that the War hurt
In the Great Hall, icy chandeliers grace the ceiling, and the air is filled with sparkles. Multiple decorated fir trees line the sides, and the four long tables have been condensed into two.
didn’t know he was going to come at that time,” Draco mutters. “Life is hardly going to change. Garren wasn’t doing anything of particular importance.” Then, he turns his head towards the door on instinct.
Harry props an arm on the back of the seat, and twists his body to look directly at Malfoy. “And the goblins seem to like you.”
Pansy flooed over rather quick after that. “Draco? Are you alright?” she asked, and hugged him tightly.
Little does he know that Robards had already retrieved the evidence of him contacting the papers. Unspeakables and Hit Wizards have the abilities to uncover magical traces. And so, in the foreseeable future, Hitchly will never be working with sensitive information in the DMLE, and will have no legal way to punish those that he thinks should be punished. He would only be able to keep his head down against the threat of his own punishment, lest the same fate of
Professor Flitwick: “......Animagus transformations are typically from human to a non-magical creature
“Was worried for me, the utter do-gooder,” Draco snorts. “Go off to lunch, I should be healed by dinner.”
Draco’s head whips around, immediately seeing Harry leading a group of Slytherins out onto the balcony, some of them haphazardly dressed, others still in their sleepwear.
There is Malfoy’s chest that Harry had only been able to catch glimpses of in the Forbidden Forest and in the Hospital Wing... The curve of Malfoy’s muscles aren’t as well defined as Zabini’s, but...
“You really can,” Potter says firmly. “Don’t worry, you won’t be the first. There are already a few Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs staying down in Slytherin now. Blaise is really good at making the rooms larger for everyone. You have to be respectful of the other Slytherins, of course, but we’ll be respectful back. It doesn’t make sense if we only help you on the night of the full moon...Alice?”
Draco promises that he will help with any subject changes and personally request any changes from McGonagall. Blaise and Pansy have both started brainstorming lists of career prospects and connections—in particular, Blaise’s and his mother’s connections remain expansive.
“Don’t be scared, Potter,” Draco says, when he notices Harry shifting closer to Draco, and away from a young wolf-student who is...also shifting towards Draco.
But then he felt obliged to look after the werewolf students, and then the friends and siblings of the Slytherins, including various muggleborns...
“You’re a bastard, Malfoy!” one of the goblins calls back. “We’ll have your guts if the dragon stealer tries
Malfoy led him down the Muggle-filled streets. Harry kept his grip on his sleeve, lest he became separated.
“We should just leave this trash to heal slowly and painfully,” Pansy replies, nudging Creevey with her foot. She kicks him in the shin. “Creevey! I thought Harry was your
“What the hell!” Harry retorts. He and the other Slytherins cast their own shield charms to block the Ministry team’s attack.
“Then go back to sleep.” Draco casts a strong warming charm for her and Blaise and re-tucks the blankets back over them.
With short movements, Draco summons a separate quilt for the other students a few meters away from him, and levitates over the leftover plates of meat to them. For good measure, he casts a strong warming charm.
McGonagall pinches the bridge of her nose. “I see. Your resorting was a very reckless action. Are you
Since Pansy gave Draco that book on muggle courting habits, doesn’t that mean she knows that Draco likes someone who grew up around muggles?
“The problem is the lack of inter-house unity and ignorance. Clearly, everyone needs to take an expanded form of Muggle Studies together, so that everyone can realise we’re all humans at the end of the day.”
Draco is also secretly relieved. Hogwarts’ magic is tightly woven and very good and Hogwarts obediently remained cool and calm during the panel’s evaluation instead of emitting off happy magic—like it is now. Thankfully, Unspeakable Nightshade didn’t object enough to turn the panel’s decision around.
Minerva takes a look, even though the historical situation is the opposite of what occurred between Malfoy and Garren.
With others around, Narcissa will not reprimand him too severely. “That matter with Hogwarts, have you no awareness of your own safety, Draco?”
: ...where's my private potions lesson??? Why didn't Malfoy hug me and cover my hand with his and showed me how to cut potions ingredients???
Pansy’s lip curls in distaste. “Come on, tell me. If your actions were for the better good, then you don’t have anything to hide. Aegis gave you the soul orb, and you
could tell me what the next step is?” Draco says with a raise of his brow, completely unaffected by Potter’s
Neville Longbottom stumbles out of one of the tents, still dressed in his pyjamas. “Eh? Malfoy…” he rubs his eyes blearily.
When the wind blows, a gentle shower of petals drift around them. Some of them land on Harry’s hair. Draco reaches out and sweeps some away. Harry’s wide-eye expression soothes some of the nerves in Draco’s chest.
Harry blushed at Draco’s intense look. He felt a little weird having his cock out like this in the living room of his home.
” A figure leaps out from the tree above them, teeth sharp, eyes angry, fingernails curled like claws.
Aster Grace looks curiously at the papers Professor Vector has just handed out to everyone in their Arithmancy class. These are the same papers that they’d seen in Professor Flitwick’s class, for making architectural plans.
them into a space they feel unsafe goes against every single damn instinct that dragon side of him infuses. Perhaps some of that unsafe feeling is perceived and not all true. But until Draco knows for
The sex was really good gift. But the best gift...was Harry’s heart, which Harry had already been slowly giving to him ever since they started dating.
Potter grimaces and hunches his shoulders. “Yeah, well. She thinks I still want to be an Auror.” He darts a glance at Draco.
More than one person looked jealously at Draco’s meticulously prepared lunch, with its numerous colours and delicious scents. But they were not allowed to have a taste, and could only suffocatingly go to the Ministry canteen, or outside, for their loveless lunch.
Granger huffs. “Making the house-elves work again. If Dennis and the others are in the Hospital Wing, then you should be safe, Harry. There’s no need to sit here.”
When none of the Slytherins move, Draco adds, “If you have an assignment due that you haven’t done, you’re
At one such dinner, Hermione started to nudge Harry about going outside and meeting new people again.
“The unity meeting!” Harry’s mind races. Forget about bonding activities, right now, they need to work together to hold Hogwarts together.
There is a moment of fear and some gasps of shock among the visitors when the flock of thestrals suddenly descend. But they are soon embarrassed as the students mingle freely with the large skeletal-like beasts.
With one last shove, Draco draws his hands back, crossing his arms and blocking the doorway to the rooms. “Listening to
Draco meets Granger’s gaze dead on. “I apologise, Granger, for all my past misendeavours against you. You deserved better.” He turned to Weasley. “I apologise, Weasley, for all my past taunts against you. Your family is not a weakness but a strength.” And finally, he turned to Potter. “I apologise, Potter. I blamed you for my own failings, when in fact you truly are a great wizard.”
Draco immediately notices when Hogwarts recollapses—the sound and the magical pulse are hard to ignore. He frowns slightly and sends his magic out to investigate. He’s a little surprised to sense Hogwarts wakefulness, which lasts for less than fifteen minutes.
Draco brings the dragon a little closer to the surface just as Mrs Norris launches herself at him. Her claws dig into his robes, but not through his scale-plated skin underneath.
Nolan’s face falls, but he dashes away a moment later, Harley following with him. Felicity pulls out her communication badge and sends a message to Pansy.
“Na-ah! Don’t thank me, I’m doing important work,” Pansy says. She smirks. “I also made sure to add sound-proofing charms for you.”
Draco does not even bother to sigh. He only hopes that the house-elves will bring Jamie back when they send dinner over.
Draco glances at Potter’s schedule, which he has obtained from Felicity, which she obtained from Potter-surveillance. Around him are the other Seventh Years.
“The full moon is approaching. Have you been taking Wolfsbane?” Pomfrey immediately questions. Draco knows that she knows that Draco brews Wolfsbane. Worry furrows her brows. “Wolfsbane should not be suitable for a were-dragon. However, there is no published equivalent of dragonsbane potion. How have you managed?”
Draco hides a wince. After Blaise’s gift, he’s regretting not buying the expensive ring with embedded emeralds instead.
It’s not just Harry. Some of his Slytherins have family—and old friends—in the other Houses too. But the situation has become impossible to ignore. The Wizengamot
: I heard Mr Potter say that you are like a mama duck! Here, you can have this picture as a present!
Harry closed the door, directing Malfoy to the ground floor living room where he had prepared a small slim wand case. He picked it up and turned around to hand it to Malfoy.
Draco’s chest tightens. He can’t look away. His lips part. His grip on Harry’s hair tightens. “Harry…”
“Did you notice that tonight is the full moon?” Mary Green says, turning her gaze towards the Slytherin building and the Forbidden Forest behind it.
The Slytherin Banner now hangs on the wall next to the Slytherin Dungeon’s entrance. There is no point hiding, everyone knows their location.
,” and looks away as Ginny and Luna exchange those silent looks that couples have. They make Harry breakfast and Luna hangs up colourful paintings.
“Hm. I want to...keep this between us for now,” Harry said. Telling others was scary, and he didn’t want other people’s criticism.
At the Ministry, Anderson warily reports what has happened to the Vice Minister, who belongs to the faction that pushed for the Slytherin separation bill.
No two subsequent chairs are alike, and most of them don’t even hold till the end of the lesson, but Professor O’Conor nonetheless gives them full marks.
There is no doubt that the other purebloods in Britain would read this news and think it is true. They’ll refuse any future marriage talks. No matter how Narcissa tries to convince them, no family would accept a son-in-law whose homosexuality is “known” in public. They will only turn blind-eyes to quiet extra-marital homosexual affairs.
Malfoy continued, “Mr Little Deer is their role model. One of them spends all his days drawing from those books. He wants to be an illustrator when he grows up.”
“It’s good practice for me,” Harry says. “Hermione, don’t you remember that Defence professor was one of my possible career options?”
Grinning, Harry allowed Draco to slip in next to him, quickly snuggling against Draco. Draco held him tight as he told the fairytale, wrapping them both up in protective magic. At certain points, Harry would glance up with a smile, utter comfort in his green eyes, and Draco would be humbled by the trust, would re-vow to destroy all of Harry’s enemies—which Draco
Malfoy drew an unfamiliar wand and cast. A shiver went down Harry’s spine as Malfoy’s magic cloaked him.

Regardless, the potions laboratory now has a dedicated table for the improvements on the badges and Pansy’s healing potions, space for the dedicated Slytherins who have their brewing projects, including Aster, and space for tutoring sessions.
The sound draws students from their classrooms and causes the Ministry officials to race out of the castle, followed by McGonagall.
“I’ll begin first,” Shacklebolt says. “I am aware of Aegis’s raid on Malfoy Manor...but the Aurors are stretched thin. They always have been, but it’s been worse after the War. It’ll take at least two years, more, to train up more Aurors. At this point in time, Greyback is the bigger threat. And none of those attacked by Aegis have come forward to file a report.”
McGonagall’s Independent Hogwarts declaration makes a huge splash on the front pages of the papers the next day, with her speech printed verbatim. This is combined with articles talking about the timely re-collapse of the rebuilding attempt of Hogwarts by the Ministry team.
Multiple heads in the Gryffindor commons turn to him. Harry glares unrepentantly back at them all. Some of them look back at him sullenly.
Harry nods. They shift positions and lie back down again; Pansy grabs Harry’s arm, making sure he stays close.
The Unspeakable says softly, “You have no separated Slytherin, have you? That’s why the Sorting Hat still thinks Slytherin is a part of Hogwarts.” He draws his wand. “Don’t stop me, Headmistress, or you will be reported for obstructing the law and removed for your post.”
thank you for your care of Harry Potter on Samhain,” he tells the thestral leader. “Not that you needed to, I had everything under control.”
Draco nods. Droplets of his blood fall into each cauldron. In an instant, the blue-ish colours of the potions turn to a deep fire red. Draco frowns, jotting this down. No, it would have been impossible for that potion the Dark Lord gave him to only contain dragon blood...what else was in there? What was causing this reaction?
Blaise sighs lightly. “Don’t be so hasty, Draco. Hogwarts is not ready yet. Tomorrow, I’ll take Felicity and the house-elves for the final round of Hogwarts.”
A heavy stone forms in Harry’s stomach. “Don’t tell me. You think that Hogwarts is going to fall apart
As for the ‘official’ meetings, the Eighth Years have their careers meetings at the start of the new week, scattered between their free periods and the afternoon after classes.
,” McGonagall says in a very dry tone. “Teaching is much preferable to dealing with the Hogwarts Board of Governors at the moment. Go, I won’t delay your afternoon any longer.”
After mumbling quietly about the story of how he and Ron infiltrated Slytherin back in Second Year, Harry finishes off with the comment that he has been waiting all evening to say:
, including me, chose him. He’s a much better Head of House than you probably ever were! We're going to actually make things better, not like you!” Harry grabs Draco’s sleeve. “Forget him, let’s go.”
Aside from that, Harry still has most of his meals with Ron and Hermione, and sits next to them in most of his classes. He follows Malfoy and Blaise between classes, accompanying the younger students sometimes.
“Oi, Malfoy!” a goblin calls out. “Kekor wants to see you. A new shipment of contracts have arrived.”
“Ah, woops! Come in, come in.” Harry put the lid back on and allowed Malfoy into his house. “Did you make these?”
With that, Draco took off to the coldest, windiest part of Scotland, rented out a hut in the middle of nowhere for a few nights. For a brief while, he felt
Journalists in the crowd itched to take a photo, but they remembered the thorough reprimands from top management, and the mind-boggling process they would need to go through to submit
“It’s my mother’s, actually,” Draco said. “She let out the allowance for me, opened the shoulders and arms. Can you make out the faint off-shade of blue? That’s the extra fabric we put in.” It wasn’t
“Take this as a reminder, then,” McGonagall says evenly. “It is possible that your actions made Aegis sympathetic to you. But you must remember that Aegis is a terrorist organisation. Please stay away from them.”
“Ugh, it’s all the fancy food again,” Weasley grumbles. “Where’s a good full english breakfast?” A few seconds later, a full english appears in front of him.
. He stalked towards the bed, a leer twisting up his lips. With the utmost care, he cast a localised warming charm and slowly pulled back the blankets covering Harry’s lower half. Harry was curled up on his side, his smooth bottom curving out.
“Your own magic occupies your body all the time, hence it feels natural and difficult to distinguish.” Draco grabs Harry’s hands. “Now, can you feel my magic?”
Molly Weasley did away with Bellatrix.) But he does set Vince’s favourite sweets on the offering tables.
Really, there’s nothing Harry can do but go to Gringotts. And this time, he’s going to be withdrawing galleons
But all good things come to an end, like the end to their evening. Once again, Malfoy needed to leave.
“Okay, I’ll stop teasing you. You can place an express owl order if you want. Or think about your strengths. For example, baking—”
Harry participates in the clearing. “Finally, we can begin properly.” He looks at Draco next to him on one side, and Neville on the other. “Hm, it feels like after the battle again when we helped the rebuilding over the summer.”
Draco clears his throat. “Yes, I understand. With...everything...there are also some things I need to do before lunch.”
The other Aurors’ eyes widen in shock. Some of them are unable to stop the guilty expressions spreading on their faces.
Sweat beads on Garren’s forehead, his wand movements sharp and messy. His spells are in complete disregard for his environment; a statue fractures, the corner of a portrait frame starts to burn.
“When was this????” Ron said, betrayed. Weren’t he and Harry best mates? Didn’t they tell each other everything?? Well, aside from the details of their love-lives, admittedly...
McGonagall is ‘in charge’ of everyone else, as well as being the key person who weaves all the strands of magic into one cohesive whole.
Draco sweeps away a large swathe of the rubble into a pile against the far wall as Potter mumbles. Draco walks over to the wall. All the intricate stonework, destroyed. He runs a finger across the edge of one crater.
Harry flashed a quick smile. “Thanks.” He got up and fingered the material of Draco’s robes: dark blue-purple, with pinpricks of stars, and faint lines to show the constellations. The design shifted as the seasons shifted, but in the few minutes, there was no discernable change. “Is this new?”
Greyback is flanked by roughly-clothed members of his group. Bartholomew is among the Aurors desperately trying to control the situation, but they’re surrounded by
He can also feel how Hogwarts is trying to hold everything together. But he knows...that the inevitable will happen.
Rather than writing anything on the blackboard, Professor O’Conor hands out prepared parchments with the set of spells written down. After briefly going through the spells, the professor explains some of the magical theory behind the kind of transfiguration they want to do, as well as issues of permanence.
Blaise looks between Draco and Harry again. “I noticed a disturbance in Hogwarts. But clearly it was a happy disturbance. Do restrain your emotions, though. Your combined magic can rile up Hogwarts.”
,” Draco says pointedly. They might be cousins, but they are cousins in the way he and the late Nymphadora Tonks were cousins—Lovegood’s father is struck off from Malfoy family trees.
is accompanied by pursed lips. He looks like he wants to say something more. Harry’s sure, though, and so Malfoy nods and dives into research about death.
Harry can’t help but shift, a scoff in his mind. Being in Slytherin for over a month now, Harry could be blind and still understand that Draco looks after everyone in Slytherin House.
Nolan immediately jumps up, carrying a potion over to Draco. “Mr Malfoy, why are you carrying Potter? Why don’t you just levitate him?”
“Professor!” Potter shouts, relentlessly progressing towards the front of the Hall, and completely ignoring his friends.
We did not explore whether authors had more works on fanfiction.net or tumblr. Also, note that the prediction results are not “stable”: in different training iterations, a different random 80% of known data is used as input, for example, and this affects the subsequent predictive model produced.
Harry can still remember his hug with Malfoy and Parkinson. How warm and cozy it felt. Is that how Parkinson and Zabini and Malfoy feel when they hug each other to sleep?
Minerva’s lips tighten. In the last few days, she has had a headache. The magic in Hogwarts is unsettled, getting worse to the lower floors. All the charms are
“Malfoy—er, Draco,” Harry greets with an encouraging smile. He holds out a potted plant. “This is for you! It’s a bit late for a new-job present, but it’s very low maintenance.” He pushes it into Malfoy’s stomach, and Malfoy takes it, blinking and frowning.
Harry mentally pulled himself from the gutter when he saw Molly and the others spilling out from the Burrow.
Draco relaxes, his lips curling up slightly. He starts clapping, leading the wave of applause. Oh, how exquisite is that expression on the Wizengamot Member’s face?
“...I’m sure I taste horrible, thanks,” Robards says. He talks with McGonagall on some other follow up matters and ultimately leaves without talking to Malfoy in dragon form.
Draco felt wistful. If he had...but the past could not be changed; even time turners only made a past that was already consistent with the present.
Harry would not be standing if it weren’t for Draco’s support. He has known that this will happen for a while now, but
“The best way to recover and settle your magic is to sleep. But first...you need to tell me what happened.”
“Blood magic, a thestral-picked yule log…” McGonagall mutters. “Children these days…” She sighs. “Very well. Is there anything you'd like to tell me?”
,” Harry says cheekily, sitting up too. He lays a hand on Draco’s thigh, leans in despite the awkward angle. Draco lifts a slow hand to caress Harry’s cheek, and that’s that, and they both live happily ever after.
“Ah, yes. That was quite surprising, but I hope it was enlightening. But he’s back in Wizarding London now, if you were hoping to meet him.”
Harry’s hand alighted with the sensation of Malfoy’s touch. His green emerald eyes grew round, his cheeks darkening.
Draco liked to joke when he caught Harry looking at him, faint smile on his face. He would wrestle with Harry, and make him laugh. But truthfully, he didn’t mind those moments. It would be hypocritical of him: he had caught himself doing exactly the same.
Draco feels McGonagall’s assessing look, sharp on the side of his face. Draco ignores it, stepping forward to brush his hands against the heartstone once more. It feels very different from Hogwarts. But he knows intrinsically that the Manor is temporarily stable.
Despite himself, Draco finds himself flying over the clearing where the students are. Where the thestrals are. Where
Senior Ministry Official Anderson scowls. “What else can we do? We will say that the Headmistress of Hogwarts would rather let the whole castle fall than remove Slytherin. It is blackmail to force us to rescind the bill. How can the removal of the dungeons lead to this? We all saw that the new supports were very stable.”
“I don’t know, that sounds better than having Mrs Weasley ask me why I broke up with Ginny, and seeing George without Fred.”
“We had hot chocolate in Gryffindor last night, when Harry was with Hermione and Ron,” Creevey says, lifting his chin.
Mr. Malfoy takes off his boots and sits down right at the center, back supported by cushions and legs stretched out. “What are you waiting for?”
“Very good, thank you for your aid, Mr Malfoy,” McGonagall says. “One last matter, though. Mr Potter.”
Draco smirks. “Oh, Harry. All the papers need to do is present it as an excuse they are giving for their incompetence. Doesn’t it make sense for the headmistress of Hogwarts to lead the rebuilding? Furthermore,
“I’m going to start planning those lessons and writing to Professor McGonagall,” Hermione says promptly the moment they leave Garren’s office.
,” Draco said archly. But Harry just kept laughing, and then Draco cracked a grin too, and decided it was time for them to go home.
Harry swallows, his eyes growing sour. “What are you saying sorry for? That Unspeakable would have done it anyway. The Ministry would have done it anyway. Fuck.
Harry kept his head down and handed the token to the shopkeeper. The shopkeeper didn’t act out-of-the-ordinary, passing him the box of ordered potions, a little bigger than his handspan in width. Harry breathed a sigh of relief. The shopkeeper was probably accustomed to disguised customers.
Professor Garren returns on Sunday afternoon. Draco is called to a Transfiguration classroom by Professor McGonagall. Harry accompanies him.
Jamie Ottley arrives with Charlie Weasley, as he has been doing a summer internship at the Romanian dragon reserve along with a couple of other students interested in dragons and Greg Goyle, the latter of whom has also been working at the reserve after his community hours were completed.
“If you hated Potter that much, you should have told him to take his gold and leave Gringotts altogether. Barclays has a wizarding branch in London—”
The date is chosen such that it's away from the full moon, though over the last few years, werewolves, through various training, have started to gain some control over their transformation the way Draco can control his. And with the introduction of the scholarships and monetary support in honour of Remus Lupin, as paid by Harry, there are now also more Healers and magical academics studying medicine relating to werewolves.
here!” Gardiner shouts. She tries to wandlessly summon her wand back, but Draco’s grip on it is much tighter than her spell can dislodge.
Harry smiles knowingly at Draco as the two of them head back to Slytherin. Despite the scowl Draco is shooting at him now, he knows just how soft Draco is on the inside.
“Yes, we had some business to deal with,” Draco answers smoothly. “I heard that McGonagall still intends to hold the Ravenclaw-Slytherin match despite the Slytherin separation. The Quidditch pitch has been deemed safe enough, the match will be this weekend.”
At that, Harry rolls his eyes. “Alright, Mother.” He gets his head rubbed for his transgressions, and beams as he unrepently enjoys the sensation.
“It’s going to be a long time before we mend our relationship,” Andromeda says pointedly. “It won’t ever be the same.”
Harry found his bagiest clothing and covered himself up. Then, very super calmly, he walked out again. He gave a sigh of relief. Draco’s loose robe had now turned into a long sleeved long night shirt and long pyjama pants.
Shacklebolt gives everyone a stern look. “The Ministry has decided to give this team two weeks. After two weeks, we will assess their progress and evaluate whether or not they are suitable. Among those conducting this evaluation will be the Headmistress of Hogwarts herself, the person who has the clearest knowledge on the nature of Hogwarts. We will also bring in a panel of expert magical theorists.”
Hooch smiles encouragingly. “If not, you can join me and some of the other students working on the Gryffindor rooms. We cannot be slower than the Ravenclaws to reinstate our tower!”
Laurel Gardiner and her friends in Hufflepuff take their ‘study session’ time as a break, heading over to the Slytherin Corridor in case anyone dares to come out. Some other Hufflepuffs keep their head down, hurrying to the Hogwarts Library instead.
“No, this won’t do. I’m going to find you something comfortable to wear, and then we’re going to watch our first movie ever.”
Harry wriggled out of bed and tucked Draco in. Excited, Harry went downstairs to make Draco breakfast and lunch.
“It’s for your own good,” Dennis says. “This will take all the dark magic from you. And then you’ll be entirely Good Harry again.”
Harry can’t look directly at the things Pansy is holding. If he wears them and Draco sees, Harry would never live it down. “No, no! I’m not!”
If only they could get some kind of help. But it’s not as though Draco can just precast shield charms and have the kids carry them around. It’s not as though Draco could somehow transfer their injuries to himself, so that only one person would be out of action...
“We’ll have to see if your Muggle studies tutors have time,” Draco warns. “But first...are there any
A warm hand rubs Harry’s head, the fingers lightly scratching. “Go to sleep, don’t worry so much. Do you want me to sing you a lullaby?”
Hogwarts’ walls glow with magic. In front of their eyes, the banners duplicate and duplicate, filling the front and side walls. The banners hanging on the front wall move aside as another banner unfurls: the Hogwarts emblem banner, with the symbols of four Houses.
Once everyone is standing, Draco puts away all the blankets and cushions and quilts. Together, they leave the Forest. Harry has somewhat recovered, as he hands out some pre-prepared hot drinks from his picnic basket.
it,” he mutters. “How can you just...do that and walk on? If they can’t do house unity, why can’t they just ignore us and act normal?”
“Hello Professor, you wouldn’t mind if I returned with you to Hogwarts, would you? I would really like to see the new castle and catch up with Hagrid and the others,” he asks, with a non-disguised look in Draco’s direction.
But their enemies are getting smarter. Draco is left scrambling to keep up and protect his Slytherins.
: HAHAHAHAHAHA, I can just imagine all their faces when they find out that I hooked up with Harry (｀∀´)Ψ
At this point, Draco has desensitised to it. “Don’t talk about things not suitable for children in public.”
McGonagall nods as though nothing is the matter. “Very good. You may leave, Mr Malfoy, Mr Potter. Have a good evening.”
Shacklebolt’s gavel comes down. “The Wizengamot has voted. Slytherin is no longer a part of Hogwarts. Therefore, our next order of business is to discuss the Slytherin exit strategy.”
,” Aster says, a little dry. “That was ages ago, it didn’t even hurt for long, because of Draco and Pansy…
Harry’s body arched as he came, the sweet cry issued from his lips swallowed up by Draco. He’ll look at Harry’s orgasm face next time. Draco’s own release came with a low groan.
Harry is writing his Magical Creatures essay. Ron is doing a similar thing next to him, while Hermione is staring at her own work with a critical eye.
“So what, they still—aren’t you going to do anything, Mr Malfoy?” Nolan bursts out. He fists his robes, leaning forward in his sitting position. “If we let them go like that, they’ll just get more and more bold! We’re losing!”
Draco shoots her a sharp look and proceeds to round up all the Slytherins for the Hogwarts Christmas Fest. Everyone is dressed up properly in formal robes.
Down in Slytherin, Draco immediately stops lecturing. He unerringly meets Blaise’s gaze from across the Commons.
Jamie gulps, sticking closer to Ella, eyes darting to Michelle. Michelle purses her lips. Both of them are thinking about the protective badges in their pockets.
“Don’t enter yet!” McGonagall reminds the happy students. “The staff and I must check the integrity of the connections and put in the necessary staircases and ramps.”
Draco takes out Harry’s cake after dinner and serves himself and Harry a slice first. Only then does he give the rest to the younger Slytherins to divide among themselves.
Draco wraps a firm hand around Harry’s waist and apparates them, using the bonds to the other Slytherins as a guide to pull him back. They land outside Hogwarts’ front gates. Hogwarts accepts them inside, and Draco takes out his broom, returning it to its usual size.
“Waiting for your little Friday morning confession,” Pansy drawls. “Who knew you two Ravenclaws were budding murderers. Unfortunately, you don’t know how to get away with it.”
Malfoy’s look is unimpressed. He hands Harry the papers. “The name of the charity, the amount—in both numerical form and written form—and your signature.”
: Ah. But I did get to sleep with Malfoy...with half a dozen students present...It can be called "sharing one bed". Hehehe... 😜😇
Harry’s eyes also glint. “Come on, Draco. I want to be a dragon rider too, like in those muggle novels—”
Blaise, who keeps a watch while doing his school work, hides a belittingly smile, his outward face remaining serene.
Over the next few days, makeshift classrooms go up—but at least they’re more solid than the tents before. These classrooms are made with the older students' help and feature new fancy things like sky lights and large windows that let in light. The astronomy classroom even has a charmed ceiling that shows the stars and planets as they are as though the sun is not there.
Given that they have to attend the Christmas Feast with the rest of the school tomorrow, the Slytherins go all out with Christmas Eve Dinner.
Granger sits down with her lips pressed tightly together, while Weasley casts a suspicious look at the dishes on the table.
There’s a picture of Gringotts: Harry is handing Malfoy a gift bag—Harry remembers, inside there was a new mug with the Queen on it that he thought Malfoy would appreciate. It’s a bit blurry, but photo-Harry and photo-Malfoy seem to be having a good time.
going to come to Hogwarts. McGonagall won’t let it happen...Pansy said that if you got like this I should force you to leave the castle.”
New Year’s Day ends up being much like the days before. The other students are unaware of Aegis’s latest attack, and there is no point worrying them.
The next hour or so is spent helping Jamie gather a new gift of trinkets and toys. Draco buys Jamie a new bag via express owl order.
The two of them walk towards the Hogwarts castle ruins. Thankfully, Pansy is successful in stopping any Slytherin (such as Nolan) from following them.
“Bisexual-erasure,” Harry grumbles, his voice interrupting Draco’s thoughts. “Have you seen the second page? Why wasn’t this on the first page?”
on our agenda. Seeing that you have finished copying down the assignment, why don’t you turn to page 300 of your textbook and start reading ahead?”
Gryffindors almost killed Harry,” Pansy says, holding up her jar. “This is a soul orb that Aegis sent to Creevey.”
“But first, the badges...I love you, Pansy,” Draco says. He summons an armful of other things and heads swiftly down to Severus’s potions laboratory, narrowly missing Pansy’s annoyed hex.
The Hufflepuff glares. “Laurel Gardiner,” she grounds out. “I shouldn’t be surprised that you’re unable to recognise anyone beyond your scared
Maybe Draco and Potter haven’t...fully undergone puberty yet? Pansy laughs to herself. As she snuggles up with Draco again, she feels glad that Potter decided to join Slytherin.
Draco might have promised to make Christmas day a lively one for Harry...but Harry’s made it lively for everyone.
, filled with impossible happenings. Yet they had happened, and now Draco’s life has turned out like this, and it will change again at the next stage of his life.
“I mean,” Potter continues, “If no one is studying, we may as well have fun now, right? Before lunch and before the Quidditch match later…”
Draco frowns slightly. It’s not that bad, but now that Felicity mentions it, he feels very light-headed. How many soul orbs has he crushed now...? How much magic did he give Harry…?
Draco is about to retort when a spike of fear travels down one of his bonds. Draco starts walking quickly, following the direction of the bond.
“—I can go faster, alone,” Draco says. “I need you to hold down Slytherin.” Not even waiting for Pansy’s protest, Draco runs out.
After breakfast, Blaise leads Felicity and a small group of house elves around Hogwarts castle. They methodically record down the spell architecture of Hogwarts. As Blaise soothes Hogwarts, he and Felicity cast detailed surveillance spells to produce a stack of blueprints. Meanwhile, the house-elves are stripping the walls of the paintings and statues and moving them to a safer place out in the grounds.
Harry drops his eyes. “It was just Hermione’s Patronus, I need to reply,” he mumbles, searching for his wand and glasses.
’s things.” Mary tosses her head and stalks over to Ben Taylor’s group, the vocal dissidents in Gryffindor.
“I’ll keep an eye out about Aegis, though,” Hermione placates. “We should ask if Luna or her father have heard anything…”
“You may not know this, but I am involved in the Dragon Division at the Silver Emerald Group,” Pansy says truthfully.
” one the Gryffidors says in a sly voice. “Trying to find where we sleep at night…” The boy laughs when his friends shove him with a “
Then, he hops down and walks over to the other table, where all the non-Slytherin students are gathered.
“It’s fine,” Harry says magnanimously. “I spend every other night with Draco, it’s only fair that you pay attention to Nolan tonight.”
“No.” Draco makes an expression of distaste. “Potter, are you worried about me? I could get up and walk away if Madam Pomfrey will let me, you should know how overly cautious she is.”
” Draco drawls. He inwardly grins at Jamie’s wide-eye look. “Just make sure to eat your vegetables.”
“Uggggggnnn…” Harry’s body arches. His arse tightens around Draco’s cock, as he spurts all over his stomach.
, and it would be no problem for Draco and the others to stay in the North Wing the entire time. In the worse case, Draco will do just that.
Meanwhile, Draco takes out all the items he had prepared, re-enlarging them with a  swish of his wand. Very large thick quilts hover an inch above the cold ground, piled high with cushions and blankets. A modified curved shield charm above will keep out any rain or snow, and help keep in the heat.
The different year levels are currently studying different creatures. Hagrid explains some basic things to the upper years first before moving onto the younger years who he personally supervises.
was the one who invited Charlie, and after Charlie was gone, he’ll remind Harry who the best top was.
He can’t see the figures, no doubt cloaked by disillusion magic. But he can still smell them. Some of them float above the water, some of them stand by the edge of the Lake.
That’s when he notices the silvery otter Patronus. It opens its mouth and speaks in Hermione’s voice: “Harry! Did something happen? You weren’t at breakfast today.” The otter dissipates.
Draco huffs lightly. He manoeuvres in the bed, tilting Harry’s chin up. In the darkness, Harry can only see outlines, heightening his sense of sound and touch.
Draco shoots her a grumpy look. If everyone could allow him some privacy, he could bring up more of his dragon side to heal faster. He decides to ignore her spell casting and has Blaise summon him some new clothes and have the blood-stained items handed over to the house-elves for cleaning.
Draco smoothly ordered two cones, one in hot chocolate-and-coffee and the other in spiced gingerbread-and-treacle. He gave both to Harry.
.” She casts her diagnostics, her eyes tracking over patterns only she could see. “...How peculiar.”
in Britain lost something. Friends. Family. Your own body, your futures,” Draco says. “On both sides. Losing you two...I will not accept it.” He gives them both a head ruffle.
Mr Malfoy’s fingers scratch under Nolan’s chin. With a low rumble, Nolan rolls onto his back. It would normally be too cold to do that, but the air around Mr Malfoy is pleasantly warm and cozy.
“I can’t believe they dared to use it in class!” Nolan shouts, throwing a glare at the Muggle Studies classroom door.
Sunlight bathes the corridors on the morning the students return from the spring break. Now that the Gryffindors and Ravenclaws also get to move back into their towers, their uncomfortable feelings (envy, jealousy) towards the Slytherins and Hufflepuffs disappear in favour of exploring the new castle.
Harry’s brow wrinkles in concentration. He envisions his magic as wisps of silvery light, like the wisps of a Patronus. A light breeze whirls around him as he gathers the magic, making him feel a little twitchy and needing to jump up and
“Harry…” Hermione sighs with a disappointed tone. “Why do you still care so much about Malfoy? It’s not up to you to help reform him. He’s
Nothing out of the ordinary happens as the group moves through Hogwarts Castle. They wait quietly until the transfiguration professor arrives, and only then do Harry and the others head down to Potions.
Ron eagerly reached out and popped an hors d'oeuvre into his mouth. “What’s Malfoy doing in the kitchen anyway?”
Right now, Draco laid stiffly on his back while Harry shifted around for a comfortable position. Once Harry stilled, Draco
“If you’re interested in continuing to delve into the technical aspects, then Professor Vector has some papers. I’m sure Professor Garren will speak with you about your future career prospects, but allow me to be biased and say that you would do well with a Charms Mastery.”
Jamie happily greets Michelle Nguyen and makes an exaggerated confused face when she starts talking about the novelty mini rituals she’s been able to create as part of
, the Commons is surprisingly quiet. Even the student signing with the merpeople by the glass window is making subdued movements.
Draco reaches out and pats both Harry and Nolan on the head. “Yes, yes. Now, why don’t we give the thestrals some food for helping us?”
Draco meets his mother’s eyes, and they silently head to the master bedroom. McGonagall follows them.
is the one to break the silence. “...So, do you have an intensive study plan for me this Winter Break?”
Seeing all this, Minerva McGonagall feels so very, very proud and satisfied. She’s also happy to move back into a solid, physical office, with everything placed how she likes it.
Madame Pomfrey checks that everyone is okay before letting them enter the Forest, only sighing at Draco and Harry following them. For once, Nolan walks while talking with the other students, instead of sticking by Draco’s side. Draco has the feeling of,
Malfoy doesn’t enter the vault, and Harry feels like he can calm down a little. He realises that Malfoy didn’t
Pansy also pats the wall. “Is that it?” She pouts when Hogwarts’ reception of her is not nearly as obvious. “If only Hogwarts had eyes that I could cast Legilimency on.”
But when Draco pulled out again, the emptiness made Harry clench down, his hole fluttering around nothing.
now to fix those complications!” Draco insisted. “I don’t want you to regret it, Mum. I can’t imagine what having siblings was like. However...Mum, I want to meet my aunt too.”
Professor O’Conor then demonstrates all the spells, having the class repeat after her a few times. Then she splits everyone into groups. Once again, students from different houses are mixed together, albeit in different groups from Professor Flitwick’s. It’s as though the professors have been talking amongst themselves about their lesson plans.
Harry was planning something, but he wasn’t telling Draco. So Draco told him a bit about his job: the mechanics of it, if not the research. But then Draco returned the question—was there something about Harry’s job that was on his mind?
The two of them exit, and not long after, Draco can hear the sound of the floo as McGonagall leaves for the Board meeting.
Thankfully, the badge in his pocket means that it doesn’t hurt when his head knocks against the wall. He glares up at Garren.
,” the tallest of the Hufflepuffs says, with a coy smile. She waves a hand. “It’s a free castle.” She and the rest of her Hufflepuff gang wear their robes open in the mugglish style.
Pansy leans back on the sofa she’s sitting on, tilting her head slightly. “Ah, back so soon?” she asks with a little smirk.
in his name. Who knew that one day Draco would be dating someone who is technically richer than him...
In the afternoon, Draco duels against some Gryffindors out in some gardens behind Hogwarts. Potter is once again tasked with holding Draco’s robes. As the Gryffindors slink away with their tails between their legs, Draco flicks his hair back.
As Draco steps forward, his eyes capture his surroundings. Those members of Greyback’s crew near him quickly shift away, letting Draco and Harry into the “circle”, then closing back up again.
“...Do we, um, kiss now? Or should we wait til our first date on Valentine’s day?” Harry shyly looks down his hand grasping Draco’s robes.
.” Pansy steps up to him and touches his face. Draco winces—turns out those phantom bruises are real after all. As Pansy keeps prodding though, the pain recedes.
Harry sucks in a sharp breath. “Summon physical shields to block,” he immediately says, pointing his wand into the darkness.
One of Draco’s hands moved to cradle the back of Harry’s head, his fingers lightly tugging Harry’s hair.
“And when did you become Hagrid’s lackey? As much as you love talking to me, another time, Potter. I can’t have your friends murdering me for monopolising your time.” Draco shoves Potter towards Granger and Weasley. “Now go back to your parents.”
Pansy scrunches up her nose, giving him an exasperated look. But she and Blaise finally heed Pomfrey’s words and leave for the night.
. He finally learns that Malfoy’s working with the goblins because no one else had wanted him (“How short-sighted of them!” Harry told Malfoy plainly), but now Harry has questions like,
“Then I would say the same to you. Doesn’t that make you a teen parent?” Harry bursts out laughing, not stopping even when Draco jabs him in the arm. “It might be that when summer comes, some of them might want to go with you.”
He flies through Hogwarts, out of the great doors, over the gardens, through the gate. A quick check to see no one is watching, and then Draco leaps into the air and transforms in one fluid motion.
If Hogwarts wasn’t deteriorating around them, then what would Harry be doing now? Spending class absently gazing at Draco?
Despite her frown at Draco’s high temperature, Madam Pomfrey lets Draco go in the morning, so he’s back in the Slytherin Commons just as groups are preparing to leave for breakfast.
And so, the two of them returned to Grimmauld Place safely. Harry apparated them both inside into the ground floor living room.
Pansy accepts his change of topic, but Draco’s only half listening to her. He can hear the whispers around the Great Hall. Can feel their gazes. He knows they’ll get worse outside the presence of the professors.
relied on you in the past? Both you and Hermione...you could have been helping curb the students in Gryffindor. Especially the ones who hate me now for going into Slytherin.”
Credible members of the press, key figures including Kingsley Shacklebolt, past alumni, and parents of students, are all invited to the celebration at Hogwarts. Visitors will be able to tour Hogwarts, and the students get to have the day off. Images of the new castle will grace the papers in the upcoming days.
Draco hums and crouches down. If he focuses, he can feel Hogwarts’ pulse, much like a wound. Draco suffuses in his magic and releases whatever half-formed hexes those Ravenclaws were attempting. The backlash catches Draco on the back of his hand, cutting deep. It heals barely a minute later.
Blaise’s smile looks a lot like Pansy’s knowing one. “Hm, Potter must have come last night after we left.”
Harry adjusts the collar of his new emerald green shirt (all the better to avoid suspicion), runs a hand through his hair, and heads off to
When the last person is finished, Wizengamot Member Griffiths returns to the podium and asks for any questions.
But Draco’s not foolish enough to engage the entire herd in battle, despite the fact that they had herded
“Best out of three,” Draco says. “I’m heading to lunch. If you want to starve, that is not my problem.” He casts a cleaning charm himself and takes his robes back from Potter.
Harry rolls his eyes. “What happened to your beauty sleep? You don’t even sleep in! We already got rid of Greyback...Charms homework, you said? Flitwick likes you, he’ll definitely give you an extension.”
Malfoy gave him a matching, albeit slightly larger, ring. While Malfoy was still on one knee, Harry placed the ring on him.
“Harry Potter! Harry Potter!” the house elves greet Harry with excitement. “How can we be helping you?”
McGonagall briefly closes her eyes and then opens them again to watch as the last of Slytherin’s magic is expelled from the castle, leaving nothing but rubble and scattered leftover magic.
have to read and mark all those assignments. But somehow, Harry doesn’t think the Education Board would let him give out multiple-choice-only assignments.
“Hmm...If I said I dislike the sun in the morning when I want to continue sleeping, would you do something about it?”
Harry wrinkles his brows. Once he suppresses his own magic, he can sense the magic of Hogwarts. But it’s all a big blurry mess—he can’t
. Are you a real fan or an anti-fan? A moment later and Harry would have been dead! Or at best, made into a squib!”
On Sunday morning, Draco begins scheduling Head-of-House meetings with all the Slytherins, so that he can gather any last requests for the Hogwarts rebuilding and see how the rebuilding efforts have affected study, and follow up from the career talks a few months previous.
Blaise peacefully accepts this instruction. While the Hogwarts staff and students clear an open space, the Ministry workers recover the stone blocks and bricks that are still whole, and use spells that repair other fundamental building elements.
Draco placed one type of each cupcake on the tray with the tea and brought them into the lounge. “But she’s not my best friend...not like how you
Aside from the Slytherins, Hogwarts is mostly empty during the Winter Break, and Garren is mercifully gone. Nonetheless, Draco and Blaise continue their regular rounds of the floors by the Slytherin Dungeons.
In the end, Draco has chosen to hold lunch in the rose gardens, as it truly is the most suitable place that was well chosen by past-Draco.
than Malfoy, which is pointless because obviously Harry knows what’s going on with his life. Why aren’t there articles about spotting Malfoy at, say, a university? Or out in muggle London looking confused? Or eating ice cream at Fortescues?
Nolan’s face is full of reluctance. “But Mr Malfoy…” His voice goes tiny as he says, “You were hurt, we were so scared…”
Harry can’t help but laugh. “Don’t worry, Ron.” He fiddles with his quill, and decides to take out some other homework; he’ll only leave once Draco and the others finish.
Bartholomew finally says, “Sir, now that this information is public, we need to decide on a course of action and stance for the following press meeting.”
Narcissa gives Lucius a glare before turning to Draco. “I will prepare the North Wing for their arrival.”
“I don’t know,” McGonagall says heavily. “The earlier incident happened in a blind spot. The portraits by the Kitchens are all still-lifes of food, not sentient portraits. As for the stairs...it is unclear.”
Francis smirks. “He wrote a letter to my parents saying that he’s staying back to teach us advanced dueling. Non-negotiable.”
Aster raises an eyebrow. “So. You’re going to let me tell Pansy that you got hit in the chest by a stunner and just walked it off?”
together in the current. What he marvelled was how they were getting to know each other all over again, how
“A bunch of others saw us leaving Gryffindor,” he says. “They’ll know when we don’t come back. By the way...thanks for that protective badge. It was from you, right?”
Harry beamed. “It’s pretty neat, isn’t it? It’s nice to know that children across the world can enjoy the same story and the same pictures. I bet you can read many of those languages.”
In the last portion of the class where everyone is practicing, Flitwick makes a round handing out marked assignments.
“Oh, go to bed!” Draco told them. “Isn’t it past your bedtime?” He squabbled with the teenagers, damn kids.
It’s the Easter Break at Hogwarts! Draco decides to bring all his children and Harry to Malfoy Manor—it’s time to meet their grandparents, after all.
Draco’s eyes sweep over all the expectant little faces. “...It is indeed ‘later’ in comparison to last night. I presume everyone has done their assignments and is thus free, then?”
Inside the tent, Draco hesitates for a moment before pulling the other seat in front of McGonagall’s desk and sitting down. “Shall I summon a house-elf for some tea?”
Heat spreads to Harry’s ears. “Whatever, I would have jinxed you so badly…” He stands up. “There’s still time before bed, I’m going to do some work,” he announces.
The next morning, the second years ask to skip Potions and Muggle studies, and the third years ask to skip Potions.
While anti-Slytherin articles appear, as do gossip about the rumoured Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy relationship, they are far from enough to keep the heat off the Ministry’s failings.
When Draco finally regained the presence to stop, he realised that Harry was in a half daze, half unconscious.
going. Didn’t I already tell you this?” Potter’s voice rises as he steps back from Granger and Weasley. “Just go, before you miss the last carriage!”
Harry rubs his hair sheepishly. “I mean, it feels that way, since I’ve mostly been hanging out down here.”
Harry’s already given back Malfoy’s wand (there goes that excuse), but Harry’s nothing if not driven when he has an Important Task to do.
Draco smirks, but that smirk drops a moment later. “Unfortunately, there is no way we can fix this anymore. The Ministry was too hasty.”
Closest to the gates stands a group of Ministry officials with three accompanying Aurors. Rita Skeeter goes up to them, but the Aurors block her way.
from ordinary animagi, to Malfoy’s dragon form being the result of nuclear radiation and subsequent mutation and therefore not a traditional animagus form...
Garren’s eyes had been a little hot on the Ravenclaw students clustered around Professor Flitwick...but unfortunately, Flitwick has no intention to retire as the Head of Ravenclaw any time soon.
Harry steps back in Malfoy’s way. “Oh, come on, Malfoy.” He glances over Malfoy. “Your robes are pretty today,” he says, and smiles.
badges,” Draco tells Aster. “We spent a lot of our free time plotting. Lots of Gryffindors to foil.”
With all the dishonest spectators gone, Draco looks back to the Slytherin team’s practice. With the team’s enthusiasm to practice has drastically reduced, Evander has switched them to doing drills instead of a mock match.
A secret. A dirty, unworthy little secret. But Draco was Draco, and he was too much, and that was all he could ever be for someone.
“If you two are going to continue your lovey dovey chatting at 3am in the morning, can you please do it in your own bed?” Pansy says.
“If he’s your adopted son, why can’t I pat him too?” Harry says in a very serious tone. His hand reaches out for Nolan’s head.
Hogwarts glows as wedding guests admire the castle and the scenery. Hogwarts glows brighter when Blaise Zabini arrives.
The deadly hot flames change into pure red magic that stuns the Aegis members. The magic fades away a moment later as a tail sweeps across the surface of the water and flings frozen witches and wizards towards the shore.
They shadow the Slytherins down the stairs. Keep following past their own floor, down to the dungeons. At this rate, they’ll find out Slytherin’s location.
Draco looks at the pudgy stomach Harry keeps poking, to the soft wings and the big apparently-cute-looking eyes. “The resemblance is lost on me,” he says drily.
Blaise steps forward and smoothly reports on the Death Eater attacks and subsequent Knockturn Alley riots.
Harry’s eyes widened in panic. He fumbled to pull the hood back down, but the wind kept pushing it back, revealing his distinctive black curls and an even more distinctive scar.
However, the moment Draco gets into bed, Pansy and Blaise trap him, each crossing an arm and leg over him.
Draco casts warming charms, which soon has everyone sleepy. Once Draco lies down, Harry, after the tiniest bit of hesitation, lies down next to him, while Nolan takes the other side. The other werewolves settle around them, and the thestral herd also stay, the young thestrals piling into a sleepy group together, while a few of the adult thestrals stand guard.
Pomfrey sighs. “Very well, Mr. Malfoy.” She dissipates the privacy charm and opens the curtains. “Get some rest.”
She allows the Ministry team to come in, along with one member of the press: Lee Jordan, much to the displeasure of the rest of the journalists.
In the afternoon, Harry has already scheduled to meet with Ron and Hermione. So after eating lunch, Harry moves from the Slytherin table to the Gryffindor table, as usual ignoring the eyes that follow him.
Draco’s heart rate picks up. His hands get clammy. He doesn’t want to say it. But it’s the perfect opportunity to do so.
He doubles over, clutching at his heart, feeling like something is being ripped out. His magic lashes out, but finds no foe to fight.
All the Gryffindors, of course, ignored his comment to flee. They’re all in various states on the floor, a few meters back from there they had been originally standing. Draco narrows his eyes, his teeth sharpening.
“I need you to face Professor Garren, and allow him to disarm you.” McGonagall has not a trace of sarcasm. “If, and when, a Ministry inspection comes, Professor Garren needs his wand’s allegiance.”
“It’s just a lot, okay. Sure, Greyback is locked up, but Aegis is still out there. There’s no house unity at all. We can’t expect the Professors to do everything...You shouldn’t have gone to Garren, you know,” Harry adds, a little spitefully. “He’s not the Head of Slytherin anymore. Not according to Hogwarts. Keep that a secret, yeah?”
At least, on the weekend, she’ll be able to see Harry again. Harry sent her and Ron a message to meet in one of the classrooms near the Slytherin dungeons. To her surprise though, when she heads out with Ron, Ginny and Neville are also heading out in the same direction.
“Brave Gryffindor,” Draco said lightly. He pushed in a second finger. At the brief tightening of Harry’s brows, Draco stilled his fingers and instead pinched Harry’s nipple. Harry’s eyes snapped open, his lips in a slight pout. Draco gave him a kiss in apology.
“After 8am, because you should all get enough sleep first,” Draco decides, even as it stabs his own heart. All the students drag their feet up to bed.
, showing that it’s about 2 am in the morning. “Do you all know what time it is?” he says dryly. “You should all go to bed, especially since you gave me some of your magic.”
“Actually, he’s making dessert. I can cook meals fine, but he’s the dessert expert. And he thought it would be more appropriate for him to do the bulk of the cooking.” Harry’s smile was soft and his eyes loving.
Draco takes off his heavy school robes and hands them to Potter. Underneath, he has a starched white shirt with a ruffled front and puffed sleeves, and black pressed trousers. He tilts his head cockily. “Next.”
“Of course, you’re the Headmistress of Hogwarts,” Bartholomew says, his lip curling in distaste. He doesn’t sit down, instead towering over Draco. “I shall begin the recording,” he says, spelling out parchment and quill. “Where were you last Friday night?”
Perhaps it’s the warmer weather, but the students tonight are more active than usual, running about in the area around the clearing.
As Hogwarts falls, the Ministry officials’ mouths drop open. Hufflepuff rushes up to ground level and becomes a separate building. The outer walls collapse as stone blocks fall. Dust blooms into the air. It’s due to that staff and students casting
They sit closer together than ever, their conversation in hushed tones. It’s a far cry from the victorious chatter whenever Slytherin won a quidditch match in the previous years.
Little nudges, almost like Legilimency, brush against Draco. They draw his attention immediately to the faded areas that need refreshing, the broken spell threads that need fixing.
“One of my father’s best friends was a werewolf,” Harry says. “They all learnt to be animagi to keep him company.” The pile of Malfoy and wolves and blankets and cushions looks a lot more cosy than the Shrieking Shack.
Malfoy shoots him a satisfied little smirk that has Harry stunned all the way to the currency exchange counter. Malfoy makes short work of the exchange, the calculated numbers flashing by, and Harry’s handed a receipt and heft of British pound notes.
“We don’t really know each other, not anymore,” Draco said. “Go to your friends, Harry. Don’t ever neglect them. They’ll worry. In fact, I’m sure they’re already worrying. I know how you three hate fighting.”
They clearly have not looked at the blueprints Blaise kindly allowed them, or else they would have seen the complex interlocking pattern, both magical and physical, that allows such a magically-unique building as Hogwarts castle to exist. The Ministry Building may be equally magical, but it lacks the soul that Hogwarts has.
“I say, you Ministry people have to think what it means for Hogwarts. Without Slytherin, Hogwarts is basically missing a lung—”
the Dark Lord’s favourite for a reason. More so than the Killing Curse—can’t suffer if you’re dead.”
After dinner, the two cleaned up together with a few waves of their wand, and they moved back to the living room. Harry took out his stack of picture books to show Malfoy.
Outside, Malfoy and Zabini stand a distance away, giving him a little privacy. Their tall figures, straight postures, and their sleek and fitted robes...Malfoy and Zabini are very different from the people Harry knows in Gryffindor.
As they approach the Great Hall, a group of Gryffindors approach from the opposite direction. Ben Taylor’s leading them, and he looks big even in comparison to the other bulky Gryfinddors.
Draco smiles in amusement. Aster Grace is a potions adept—one of the best, aside from Draco obviously.
“Yes, yes,” Harry nudges Draco first, and they both carefully walk around sleeping thestrals, and carefully step over sleeping werewolves to get back to their original spots in the middle of the blanket nest.
“I still have your letter,” Harry says. It’s true, it’s in the top drawer of Harry’s desk back at Grimmauld Place, along with other Malfoy paraphernalia.
They remain like that for an unknown amount of time, with Nolan lightly dozing in the warmth and softness under the arms of Mr Malfoy. It’s the first time Nolan truly doesn’t mind his wolf form, because a small part of him suspects Mr Malfoy would never allow this if they were in human form.
By the time the Wolfsbane is finished, a number of other Slytherin students have arrived to use the Potions laboratory. Sticky Potter won’t hear of remaining to continue practicing his potion, instead following Draco and Aster back to the Slytherin Commons. Aster discreetly sends off tonight’s vials of Wolfsbane (though it’s no secret which Slytherin is a werewolf—disappearing every full moon is rather obvious).
Pansy snorts. “You’ve been looking for him all day. Do you think it’s safe for him to be out in the Forbidden Forest, alone?”
Mlafoy huffs, but he lets Harry get away with it. They leave the establishment, and Harry sticks his hands in his pockets, feeling rather pleased.
Harry jumps. “Professor! Right, yes, we were just going. Come on, Draco. Professor, you go have dinner too.”
Harry’s eyes snap up. “Don’t you want to hear me?” he says, eyebrows rising, smiling hovering on his lips.
Draco snorts. “Yes, I imagine so,” he drawls, “That happens when you have Bellatrix and the Dark Lord teaching you.” He was being truthful to Gardiner all those weeks ago—she should have tried the
, your son posed himself as the Head of Slytherin, and announced that Slytherin was now separated from Hogwarts! A thousand years of tradition,
“Dark spells against Greyback are much more effective,” Draco says. “Greyback’s constitution means that he is naturally resistant against many spells.”
Draco nods slightly to Pansy. She leads everyone else inside, leaving Draco outside with McGonagall.
, he snorts in frustration. He reverses the transformation and has his trousers on, threading arm through shirt just as Hagrid—and
Draco habitually pats Harry’s head to coax him to sleep. He freezes when Harry’s hand lightly grazes against his chest. Harry’s eyes open, reflecting dim light in the dark.
Gryffindor Ben Taylor huffs. “Whatever then, I need to prepare for Quidditch practice anyway.” With his lead, the Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs leave.
After the large engagement party a year ago, Harry was so tired and didn’t want to hold a wedding at all. However, at the threat of a surprise wedding instead, he capitulates.
Harry finishes the rest of his hot chocolate and stands up, attracting Ron and Hermione’s attention.
The other bonds stretch tight as his connection to Harry shortens. London smog irritates the back of his throat. Patches of bright lights mark the Muggle areas, and the haze of magic mark Wizarding London. Draco dives.
Draco glances at Harry. He really shouldn’t be surprised that Harry’s on a first-name basis with the Minister for Magic.
,” he begs. He sneaks a hand down to his own cock, trying to ease the pressure—and cries out when Malfoy pushes both of his arms into the bed.
He greets Tom, and ambles down Diagon Alley. It’s a bright and sunny afternoon, and Harry’s day had started with a
They don’t have any such luck this time either, the daft things. Draco swishes his tail, hoping they’ll move onto something else.
Draco rolls his eyes. He rises up, takes the ring box, and puts on the right ring on Harry’s finger. “There. Now put on mine.”
Neville smartly moves away from the couple trying to compete against each other. While he didn’t mind helping them with their date, he really does not need to watch their unusual manner of displaying affection at such close quarters!
That evening, none of the Slytherins want to do any homework, instead preferring to ogle the fallen Hogwarts. This includes Harry, who is roaming with the other Slytherins. Draco has to follow to supervise them.
“The world needs big-hearted people like Mr Harry Potter,” Draco says back lightly. “After all, you can’t expect
He turns to address Headmistress McGonagall. “By the grace of the Head of Hogwarts, we will require time to move Slytherin from the rest of Hogwarts.”
Malfoy held his arm out. Harry took it and was sidealonged to an Apparition Point in Central London.
In his embarrassment, he has completely forgotten that the other students were also snuggled up with Draco through the night…
Not long after, along with the tray of meat Harry originally summoned, there are trays of other types of meat, berries, bowls of water, and an assortment of savoury and sweet pies suitable for humans.
In the Ministry, a number of Wizengamot members and various other officials are annoyed. Releasing this kind of information on a
Harry lifts up the flask and food box. “This? Breakfast. I just woke up.” He gives Hermione an apologetic look.
Draco groaned too as he came. His stroking became erratic as he pulled the last sensations from them both.
A moment later, the door is pushed open. “What was that?” Draco says, eyes narrowed in suspicion. “Something floated into the room.” His eyes fix on Harry. “Are you injured?”
There’s no signature, but there’s no need. Greyback sneers. “A year older and he’s grown all cocky, heh?”
Pansy obliviates them all. The rest of them gather the collected criminals, tie them up, and send them all whisking away via portkey.
Harry clears his throat. “I don’t know why the house-elves sent it out now! We can have my one later.”
Yes, Alice can sense it very well. She drinks down the nasty potion in one go, glancing to where the Slytherins are gathered around Malfoy and Potter. That Nolan Larch gets head pats from Malfoy…
“Hello, Harry, Malfoy,” Ravenclaw Patil says. Gryffindor Patil is a bit more reticent, looking around with guarded eyes.
Harry’s top drawer at his desk in Grimmauld Place is starting to overflow with new notes and receipts, and the second drawer down has been cleared for the new information.
, too clingy, too cloying. It was then he understood that Harry must have felt the same way. Harry never wanted Draco because Draco wasn’t worth the want.
The Ministry advertisement for reporting dark magic activity appears again. Draco thinks he can remain calm, but the dragon inside of him thinks differently. It sees a
Immediately after Potions ends, Pansy gives Draco a nod, and she and Felicity head to the Hogwarts Library.
It is barely three hours past midnight that Draco awakes again—two hours since Draco went to bed after making sure all the Slytherins have gone to sleep.
Hermione’s lips purse. “That’s true. If those Aegis members really wanted to help, they would join the Aurors. Oh! Harry, have you figured out what you want to do?”
Narcissa ends up becoming distracted when Ms Zabini arrives alongside Blaise. The two retire to Narcissa’s drawing room with afternoon tea and catch up on old times and reminisce on when their sons were young.
Malfoy’s hand presses Harry’s back lightly, nudging him forwards and into the attached potions laboratory.
“Hmm,” Draco hums with an unconvinced tone. He focuses on exuding more heat, so warm that with his robes and with fluffy Nolan half lying on him, he doesn’t need a blanket. His shield above them is almost as good as a cover of his wings would be.
But Malfoy’s still visiting the Hospital Wing, and when he’s not, he’s taking a tiny vial of potion in the mornings.
For now, he enjoys spreading his wings, breathing dramatic fire, and all-in-all luxuriating in the advantages of his dragon form. There is no sense of disconnect between his human form and his dragon form. He is no longer forced to transform but instead chooses to do so.
A burst of sharp coldness flickers in Narcissa’s eyes. Her smile turns mocking. “I imagine you asked the Headmistress of Hogwarts but she refused. Why should I agree?”
All the house tables have been truncated in half, in order to create an open space. The typical floating candles have been replaced by jack-o-lanterns, with an array of carved faces, and peculiar music plays in the background (later, one of the Slytherin first years will inform him it’s muggle music). The other students are also dressed up as...
McGonagall’s face remains serious, but there is a brightness in her eyes. “Yes, I hope that all the students will join me for dinner.”
Harry grabbed onto bedding, clinging on as Draco’s cock delivered waves and waves of pleasure. His own hard cock was rubbed against the bed at each thrust, smearing precome all over the bedding.
Draco starts to pat Harry’s head. Harry’s lips curl up as the soft tingling feeling spreads from his scalp down his body.
While Potter’s protesting to Weasley that there’s nothing going on, Pansy slows to Granger’s pace. Draco catches Pansy
Alice swallows. If the other Slytherins are like Malfoy and Potter, then Slytherin is a safer place to be for a werewolf like her.
Then, as usual, they head back to Grimmauld Place to relax in the sitting room. Malfoy summons a beast of a book about something complicated about earth magic and its connection to the apparition charm, and so Harry gets a book for himself too. Harry feels settled, though, and much too lazy to read. He finds himself studying Malfoy’s profile: more angular than pointy these days. Those eyes that could center Harry in the world, and those lips so often quirked up in smirk at Harry. Harry dozes off despite himself, and wakes up in bed the next day.
“...Harry and us, we’ve stuck together for seven years. You’re underestimating us,” Weasley says, while his hands pick up his knife and fork to eat.
Chapter 42! Did you know it was back in chapter 32 that the Hogwarts rebuilding was mentioned? ALSO 150k!!
Harry’s lips twitch in a mixture of exasperation and amusement, while Draco snickers at the very familiar scene.
Draco’s lips quirk, and he rubs Harley’s head affectionately. “You two are both falling behind Sequoia Hawks,” he chides.
Then, in mid-May, after examining every part of the castle multiple times for any last additions, McGonagall finally declares that Hogwarts’ reconstruction is finished.
The first thing Harry saw were familiar hands holding a tray of freshly baked croissants. Then he looked up (and up and up) to see a familiar face.
Malfoy casts a spell that turns half of the miniature Hogwarts invisible, showing the staircases and…
As for that not-telling-Pansy-bastard Draco…That night, Pansy gets into bed and traps Draco under her.
one of the key things that keep them together nor features high in their list of activities—it didn’t before, and it doesn’t after. It leaves them more time to argue about other things instead, like the best kind of coffee to go with a buttery croissant.)
Draco looks more closely at the fraying edges of Hogwarts’ magic. He can see how parts of it are trying to knit together against the repulsion. Holes in the magical weave further away from the main cut are healing, but at the edge, strings of magic are cast, only to fall and dangle, unable to reach the other side. It’s just too big.
When Draco wakes up in the morning, properly, there is another owl from his mother. Draco takes the letter and sits down at his desk.
As the main food service ends, the music gets louder and students start contorting their bodies (Draco hesitates to call it ‘dancing’). There’s even the girl Weasley with Luna Lovegood. But no Potter.
Garren stalks to the opposite end of the space. Meanwhile, Harry positions himself a few meters to Draco’s side.
Draco can feel his peaceful, green-eyes-black-curls-Potter-free days slipping away like the wind. He turns back to his friends, and frowns when he realises they’re looking at him.
Putting that matter aside, Draco conjures a small tent for himself, with the opening facing away from the crowd of students and the tall Hagrid towering over them. Draco doesn’t want to ruin another robe—the
“Anyway,” Potter continues. “Kingsley offered me a place with the Aurors. No NEWTs, he said, for anyone who fought in the War. Didn’t accept, in the end. But I said I’ll help out.”
Harry makes a tiny grumble of dissent, but his body is really too used to it; he quickly falls asleep.
“I was joking,” Draco said. He held Harry’s hand, pressing a kiss on each finger. “I also want to stay. Where is your ring?”
Upon seeing the group of excitable third year Slytherins converge upon him, Blaise puts down his papers and bestows a smile upon the three who carry most of the excitement, Alberta Bulstrode, Raven Flint, and Rose Datta. In contrast, Nolan Larch and Harley Gerble look like they’ve been dragged along.
“It’s Christmas Eve, I can’t in good conscience let you sleep alone.” Her voice says that it’s not a request, but an order.
Harry thinks of all the pureblood homes Aegis has been destroying, and hence all the people they’ve offended. “Somehow, I don’t think so,” he says. “Anyway, I thought you didn't like vigilante groups taking the law upon themselves...it’s not the War anymore.”
Harry grinned. “It should be. Luna has been very kind in teaching me how to make proper tea. I have a reference sheet for different temperatures and time, though I still can’t do a tea ceremony like she can. By the way, she’s my literary agent.”
: Liu Ning is an alpha who everyone thinks is a beta. He works for alpha President Yan Qiang. On the first day of spring, Yan Qiang decides to ask Liu Ning out on a date...
Draco glances at Pansy. She shrugs and yawns for real this time. “Harry’s a big boy now, isn’t he,” she says.
Draco and Harry bickering about their age difference (of ~two months) is like...one of my favourite things lol. For those who read danmei. Imagine Harry calling Draco gege...... 🥺🥺
“Yes?” Draco whispered. “Are you cold? I could retrieve another duvet, or activate the warming charms.”
Slytherins. He wasn’t elected by the general student body, he was just part of Slytherin, and all he had to do was worry about the Slytherins and do his best to create a safe environment for them.
“Do you think I’m being overly anxious about it all?” Harry says quietly as they walk towards the castle ruins.
. Flipping through, she bookmarks a number of pages. “There have been duels between professors and students before. There was one occasion where wand allegiances were changed as a result, when a professor completely suppressed the student...ah, it was here.”
Harry waits with Draco at the front doors of Hogwarts; Draco for the other Slytherins, and Harry for Ron and Hermione.
The staircase has been fixed by the time Pansy and Felicity head there early Monday morning before the other students stir. Pansy has had to leave the warmth of Draco’s side, with all three Slytherin boys still sleeping.
Harry laughs. “But, the answer of course is that every common room should have a chocolate fountain.”
“Good evening,” McGonagall says. She summons a few parcels onto her desk. “Mr Taylor, I have intercepted a number of parcels that were meant for you.”
A few days later, Harry was seriously watercolour painting a delicate fairy-like scene of moons and stars and clouds and trees. Sunlight filtered through the window, making Harry himself a beautiful, delicate painting with no one to appreciate.
Meanwhile, similar internal changes are also being made to Hufflepuff. The entrance of Hufflepuff is also further widened, with big wooden doors and plants crawling across the wood.
With students moving around the classroom, shifting singular tables together to sit with friends, Aster glances to River Hall again, and jolts when their eyes meet.
“Hmm.” With a flick of magic, Harry’s trousers and pants disappear. Harry’s beautiful, adorable cock springs up, now unconfined. It’s flushed, and when Draco wraps a hand around it, pearly precome oozes out.
From Harry Potter to Neville Longbottom, to the second year Gryffindors...they’re all traitors! How can they collude with the Slytherins? Don’t they remember what Aegis said? They, as Gryffindors, have the responsibility to uphold the right side!
Harry, sweet, sweet Harry, sends Draco some magic anyway. Using it, Draco spreads his awareness out to blanket the entirety of Hogwarts, and links it back with Harry.
“What indeed,” Filius says heavily. He’s under no illusion about whether Draco Malfoy will tell him what happened.
Draco is about to leave Blaise to speak with Potter, but Blaise grabs Draco’s arm and pulls him close.
Draco and Blaise are in charge of checking Slytherin, while McGonagall assists Professor Sprout with Hufflepuff.
, I’m coming inside of you!” Charlie’s own orgasm rolled through his body as his come penetrated deep into Harry’s body.
Draco leaps down from his broom, landing right between Laurel Gardiner and his Slytherins. Gardiner stumbles back.
Neville greets Hannah first, and after their inquistory looks, Hannah says, “Yes, Harry talked to me too. And this is Maira….she has an older brother who’s in Slytherin. I think, for now, it would be best if she moved out of the House…”
the purpose of soul orbs,” Draco says. “They were originally developed to be used on dying wizards. They were going to die regardless, and thus thought useful to harvest their magic before it dissipates back to the earth. Turning it to other uses is simple. The main bottleneck is the creation of these orbs requires expensive materials, time, and skill. And they can only be used once.”
In fact, the touch is so light that it’s almost ticklish. It takes a lot of effort for Draco to keep his tail still.
Malfoy Manor is in South England. He prays that his father was not stupid enough to let Greyback in for a visit.
...scratch that last sentence, Hermione just saw Harry sneaking a kiss with Draco. And they were now holding hands under the table…
Grudgingly learning from Blaise, Draco finds it easier to skim his fingers across the walls. Magic activates under his fingertips, the colours intertwining and glowing across the wall surface. Is it his imagination, or has the spell patterns visibly frayed in the short time that Draco dueled with those Ravenclaws? Draco’s eyelids lower. It’s as though Howarts has aged...was the Battle the turning point?
Potter startles. “Um, okay…” He quickly steps forward away from Draco’s hand and leads the way to the Great Hall for lunch.
Draco raises an eyebrow. “Oh? Are you going to start acting like a proper Head of Slytherin? Are you
Despite Potter’s panicked face, he doesn’t mess up the potion base. He’s also capable of following simple, precise instructions, which is good when Draco’s hand starts bleeding out of the blue and he has to quickly and quietly
Pansy flicks him on the forehead. “Watch your expression, dear,” she drawls. “If Hogwarts considers you the Head of Slytherin, then that means you have
Not long after, Draco came over with a tray filled with tiny little appetisers. He placed it on the coffee table and headed back to the kitchen.
to where Slytherin students want to go, and while Felicity finds a long way to reach the Great Hall and classrooms above, it’s not a sustainable solution.
“It’s not necessary,” Mr. Malfoy says, sounding distracted. He’s doing something complicated with the badge in his hands.
McGonagall looks at him, unamused. “Good day, Mr Malfoy and Ms Parkinson. I look forward to seeing you at the feast tomorrow.”
We can also compare our model to human guess. The best human guesser in the poll obtained 18% accuracy. We also beat this metric with up to 60% accuracy.
I can combine this extra knowledge with numerous runs of the machine learning in an adhoc way, and doing this increased the correct percentage from 55% to 68%.
While Hermione is disgruntled that Harry has not been joining them for breakfast of late, she’s happy that he has joined them for dinner.
,” Ben Taylor says stiffly, crossing his arms as he glares at the students rushing to help the professors.
Draco’s lips curls. It may look like his father’s handwriting, but when has his father ever written so casually to him? When has he ever used the word ’please’?
Zabini comes out from the bathroom and gets into the bed too. “Pansy, don’t hoard him!” he says, pulling Malfoy partially away from Parkinson’s grip.
“Draco, right now feelings are good. We need to capitalise on it, we can’t be pretentious with our win,” Harry says seriously. “Don’t you remember the Winter break? When we were able to have fun with the other Houses? We can get to that point again. If you’re scared, we can make sure some of the other Professors also come.”
The papers that morning have the mysterious capture of Greyback and his gang. They think it’s Aegis’s doing. Tensions towards Greyback drop...but the idolisation of Aegis rises.
Next morning, Draco distributes pepper-ups to sleepy fifth years who’d helped him, and the prototype badges to some fourth years to test out. The elves seem to have taken initiative (
Hermione doesn’t know the name ‘Aster’, but she does remember the face of the student that fell down the Hogwarts staircase.
“These last two weeks went by really fast,” Harry finally mumbles. “I felt like we hardly did anything. Like it was a holiday for us. Do you think we can start building tomorrow? Will McGonagall shorten classes so that we can help?”
Below, the students of the other Houses eat cheerfully, vindictively in some cases. No owls will be allowed into the Great Hall this morning, as McGonagall needs to check all the mail for soul orbs first.
“Bedroom, Potter,” Malfoy whispers into Harry’s ear. The lips against the shell of Harry’s ear, the vibrations of the sound make Harry shiver. “Unless you want to do it in the corridor.”
McGonagall veritably glides to the front, her demeanor serious and calm, though Draco bets she’s mocking the Ministry team in her heart.
Harry quickly follows her lead. Slowly, they peel back the disillusion charms, layer by layer to reveal figures dressed in black.
Despite the water rushing down his body, Harry had his glasses on as he held his cock, looking at it this way and that.
“Merlin, it’s the great Harry Potter! Dammit, where’s my parchment and self-inking quill?? I want to get a signature!”
“Hush, go to sleep,” Draco whispered. He caressed Harry’s hair, one of the few things he could easily touch.
Draco takes his arm back, sleeve covering the Dark Mark. “When I finally returned to Malfoy Manor at the end of it all. After the War Trials. And when my
Malfoy makes a choked sound, much to Harry’s evil delight, and quickly heads back into the mysterious workings of Gringotts. Meanwhile, Harry gets prodded outside by the goblin guards.
Some dutiful heads nod. McGonagall’s nostrils flare in frustration at the disobedient students, but what can she do? She can’t make them all swear a Wizard’s oath.
His mother is in the main hall, her hand the Manor’s heartstone where all the central wards should be anchored. Her face is twisted into a grimace, clothes dishevelled, and glints of red blood stain her fingers.
“By doing this, we will avoid the worse,” Blaise says evenly. “The Hufflepuff commons is the only area remaining after this.”
Harry’s lips twist in discomfort. “Don’t do that. You know...Snape tried to save my mum. Failed though.”
After having argued with Narcissa, the two of them had viewed Draco’s memory. Right now, Narcissa is turning the Manor library upside down trying to figure out just what the Dark Lord and Greyback concocted.
” The student is dressed in all black muggle clothing, and has a matte-black mask over their lower face.
than just classes. Like those career meetings. Someone who can listen to their students without prejudice. And actually do something about their problems.”
In the evening, Draco, Pansy, and Blaise sit close together on their bed as Draco quietly relays what he told Pansy to Blaise as well.
In the end, Harry organises a House-Unity meeting after all, gathering Blaise, Luna, Ginny, Hermione, Ron, Neville and Hannah to the gardens.
“You mean the corridor outside Severus’ old office was destroyed??” Minerva says, aghast. After confirming this with the portrait, she rushes to the corridor.
There’s an insistent tapping on the bedroom door that has woken Draco. He pulls away from Pansy and Blaise.
For a brief moment, Narcissa’s eyes sweep to McGonagall, then back to Draco. “I can focus, if you charge.”
“I’m awake,” Harry grumbled, glaring a little. His voice had deepened again, shifting from the higher tone he had used during the scene.
Harry, getting the message, says, “That’s right, Hogwarts is sentient! Not really surprising given how old Hogwarts is!”
McGonagall’s lips twitch...up. “You see, it is one of the few things the Ministry can check. They, however, cannot check who Hogwarts considers the Head of Slytherin.”
: .....he really bites............(；⌣̀_⌣́)  [but then ⬛⬛ happens and Harry’s face cannot be show here] )
Harry’s brain fizzled. He couldn’t multitask like Draco! But luckily, Draco was able to take over. He pressed their two cocks together, stroking both at the same time with a hand slicked with magical lube.
“Oh, Harry,” Pansy says, catching him before he heads back inside the Slytherin Building. “Don’t forget tomorrow! I’ll meet you after breakfast to find something suitable for you to wear. I have Blaise’s permission to resize anything from his wardrobe.”
“Well, they forced Malfoy to do it instead. And you know how much Malfoy hates me, so I have to keep on his good side.”
“That’s sorted then,” Pansy interrupts. “The rest of us will leave first, and you two will leave last, understood?”
The Slytherin renovations are almost entirely handed over to the Slytherin students, while the professors and alumni work on finishing the lower floors and starting building the walls for the ground and upper floors.
There’s a concerning number of disruptions. Aside from the large, crude spell-destruction, Draco finds many small imperfections. In a place like Hogwarts that can heal itself, those imperfections should
“Here is as good a place as any,” Mr Malfoy is saying. He draws his wand, and suddenly small squares from his pocket becomes large fluffy quilts and an abundance of cushions.
Draco is alarmed that this technique has worked so well. He fervently hopes their enemies don’t catch on with this.
Auror Hitchly is at the front of the group. “Mr and Mrs Malfoy, I’m sure you’ve heard of what your son has done. But who knew that you would also be colluding with him?”
“I know.” Not all the carriages are being used, so only a smaller crew of thestrals are required today.
, Draco thinks fondly. “Potter, enemies in the open are easier to deal with than enemies in the dark. If Ginevra and I ever duel, you can be my second.”
Draco raises an eyebrow. Now, how did Potter know that? Surely Potter didn’t scour the entire Forest?
“It’s not your job,” Hermione says. “They should just attend class like everyone else. If they’re not going to class, then what is the point of staying at Hogwarts? For the
McGonagall’s lips twist into a pained smile. “And you did not stop to think that only Slytherin was conducting the old rituals? Did you not stop and think how that would upset the delicate balance of Hogwarts? I understand that you grew up in an old Manor house. Hogwarts is older yet again. Your duel with Professor Garren has left Hogwarts wavering and jittery, and you’ve further exacerbated it.”
The unknown data set contained 44 fics. The known data set contained 2579 fics, of which some authors featured prominently (note that digthewriter was ultimately an author in the HD Fanfair 2019; however, given that they often both draw and write, I had kept them in).
Over a thousand years, the separation of the magic of the four Founders has been blurred, twisting together to create new colours. Over a thousand years, the magic is Hogwarts is no longer solely of the four Founders. Instead, it is intertwined with all magic and sentiments of its thousands of inhabitants.
“It’s definitely not something the rest of us can do easily,” Pansy says. “I just don’t understand how Aegis was able to make so many of them.”
Harry bites down his lip. Swallows. Pants, open mouthed, as Malfoy feeds in centimeter by centimeter, as Harry’s body swallows Malfoy’s cock. It’s—everything—all his focus in on how Malfoy’s cock is opening him up, stretching him out.
Draco bites back a snort. Blaise’s own smooth words no doubt played a role. Draco will have to be wary about any elves falling in love with him and professing their new allegiance. McGonagall would
After washing up, Harry went into the living room with a blanket and a novel. He needed to tell Draco about what happened, but he wanted to say it in person...Draco should come over again tonight, he had said so earlier that day. So Harry read his book and waited.
At the moment, one of Ron’s owls was nesting near one of the heating elements. Negesydd was a brown barn owl with spots of white. She was growing older and liked the more quiet environment of Harry’s house—at least when there weren’t kids around.
“Felicity and I will walk ahead, you two go as slowly as you want,” Pansy suddenly says. She grabs Felicity’s arm and pulls her away first.
“Why, if it isn’t pretty little Draco Malfoy,” Greyback drawls. He leers, sharp teeth glinting. “Why, this must be a sign.”
Harry gulps and steps back towards his own bed. After testing the springiness of the mattress, Harry’s happy to find that it feels just like his own bed. It even smells right, too.
Pansy laughs. “Well, I’m going back to bed. You two can do whatever you want.” She heads into Slytherin first, and closes the entrance behind her, leaving Harry and Draco standing outside in the dim light of predawn.
And how could Hermione let Harry walk back alone that night, letting her anger overtake her consideration for Harry’s safety?
If Draco was telling his mother to mend fences with Andromeda, then he’d have to mend fences with his father too. “Tell him I want to talk to him after lunch—by myself, Mum.”
With an itchiness in his chest, Draco returns to Hogwarts Castle for the night. He doesn’t sleep for long, waking up early the next morning.
No students, no teachers, no fucking Slytherin Head of House, and herd dynamics that Draco needn’t worry about.
Coming at this time though, what is in those Aurors’ minds? It is far past the time for most rituals.
Further magic is used to stabilise everything, while the house-elves now start work on their new kitchen. By the evening, the Hufflepuff students and Slytherin students all move back into their dorms, much to the yearning jealousy of the other houses.
The muggle parents are in particular very shocked. Though in hindsight, they’re not sure why they’re so surprised.  A magical dragon should be expected, especially for a school whose motto is
Draco met with his mother on the last Sunday of every month. Sometimes, he saw his father too, but not always. Draco was a dutiful son. His parents may have not liked his work at the Ministry, but Draco always made sure to keep up to date with his share of the Malfoy holdings. He obediently followed his mother as she showed him the winter roses that had come to bloom. He quietly gave suggestions when asked about the set of rooms his mother was now renovating. He kept his mouth shut when his mother hinted about the upcoming marriage season.
been skipping classes,” a tall Ravenclaw says, as a group of them approach from yet another direction. “If you’re
After his come was well down the drain, Harry put on a pair of pants, draped the towel across his shoulders and left the ensuite, intent on picking some clothes from his wardrobe.
Draco pushes him, and he jumps out of reach, giggling. But, he indeed pulls out the warm over-robe that Draco recently gave him to match the hat, scarf and gloves that the second years got him.
“Let's go back,” Draco agrees. The thestrals carry them back to the edge of the Forest, and they fly back the rest of the way.
RIght now, the sky is dark but the moon has not yet risen. Draco accompanies three Slytherin students, Nolan Larch, Mesa Wattle, and Martin Gamp. They join with the larger group from the other houses, as well as Madam Pomfrey. While Madam Pomfrey attends to the students from the other houses, Draco distributes the last Wolfsbane potions to the Slytherins.
Draco can perfectly imagine Potter’s confused face. Next bench over, Blaise is looking at him, a smirk at the corner of his lips.
Blaise prompts himself up on an arm, lips pursed as he examines Draco’s face. “When you healed Draco, did they go back to Jamie?”
something. If there’s a problem, students should go to a professor, and if it’s bad enough, it can be escalated to the Aurors.
Harry’s brain screams. Harry lays a hand on Malfoy’s arm, and flutters his eyelashes. “I just changed the bedsheets.”
“So what?” Harry leans in closer, lowering his voice. “You have the map. You know where I’ll be. And I can send a patronus if anything goes wrong.”
Draco and Harry sit with their backs against the wall; with a strong unwillingness, Granger and Weasley sit opposite them. Draco makes sure that Harry starts before beginning to eat breakfast himself.
Potter tilts his head. “But you said partners. And I was working with Ron and Hermione.” He beckons Draco and winks. “I hope you’re ready for me to drag you down a few grades.”
Harry’s lips quirked up slightly. “Thanks for coming.” He held out the jar of floo powder to Malfoy.
He discusses this big problem with his friends. None of them remembered the names of the house-elves, and since the house-elves work for Hogwarts, it is unclear whether they could be
Draco pulls apart Harry’s clothes. He lowers his head and takes one of the dark pink nubs into his mouth, sucking, teasing, biting.
Harry wanted to please him and keep pleasing him. He couldn’t quite remember exactly how to please his Dom. But Harry didn’t have to worry. That was a job for his Daddy.
break the terms of his parole?” Auror Hitchly scoffs. “Headmistress McGonagal, you sure do favour Draco Malfoy, willing to obstruct the law for him!”
“I received my mother’s owl…” Draco gives a brief summary of what happened. He has nothing in this matter to hide pertaining to what Aegis had done.
Draco sighs lightly at the confused expression on Harry’s face. He climbs on the bed and gives Harry a kiss on the nose.
The low sound of joyful Christmas songs builds a rich undercurrent to the clatter of cutlery and the laughter and bubbling voices.
“That’s right, you were so awesome!” Nolan says, his eyes glowing, his admiration overtaking the worry. “So big! Your wings are gigantic!”
“It’s clearly due to the enchantments on the Room!” Hermione replies in frustration.  “I already explained this years ago. Thinking about your wishes whilst walking back and forth forms a rudimentary ritual. Magic infused in the room reacts to your magic and temporarily transfigures and reconfigures to your desire.
“I’m sorry that I did nothing to help. I could have—should have—helped your resistance, because we were friends.”
Alyss is a good student—all the first years are, regardless of their blood status. They’re attentive and active during the tutoring sessions that some of the seventh years hold. There aren’t any tests for the first years today, and even if there were, they wouldn’t act like this.
To her surprise, she first sees the entire herd of thestrals. She then sees a two-meter tall miniature version of Hogwarts, except it’s not what Hogwarts used to be. The castle is not complete: a number of students are working on it, including Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter.
, then I’ll do it. How would you like to sleep between Pansy and myself this time? Or...Blaise and myself?”
. The lake shore against one side, the Forbidden Forest towards the other side, and the Hogwarts castle towering a distance away.
Draco glances at Harry and smiles. “Harry and myself were sleeping in the Forbidden Forest. Madam Pomfrey and the thestrals can attest.”
Harry wants to spend longer and longer in Hogwarts castle, but Draco won’t allow it. Ultimately, on Wednesday evening, he threatens to carry Harry back to Slytherin, and only then does Harry acquiesce.
Harry’s dreams were all different types of baked desserts. Draco likes apples and chocolate, so the best thing is to combine the two. “...Does anyone here know how to bake such a cake?”
Charlie wasn’t even looking at him, Instead his eyes were focused on Harry’s vague form. His tongue darted out slightly, interested.
Malfoy shoots him an irritated look, and changes direction. They end up heading into a place that says
Draco has dragon fire. If he enlaces it with magic, perhaps he could compress the raw magic edges and merge them into a solid mass.
During the day time, when Professors are in their classrooms and most students are studying, Minerva McGonagall returns to the staircase where Aster Grace had fallen.
“As you know, Halloween is next Saturday,” Garren says. “Headmistress McGonagall has allowed for a Halloween feast, and encourages everyone to dress up. There’s no trick-or-treating, but there
That afternoon after classes, Draco is surprised when Jamie, after showing Draco his scribbly drawings for a new charms classroom, goes running off to see the house-elves with a second year Gryffindor boy and a second year Ravenclaw boy.
“Right.” Ron throws them a glance but follows Blaise as he circles the area around Gryffindor Tower.
At Hermione’s worried expression, Harry laughs. “You think I’m a werewolf? I’m not. I just hang out with the other students in the Forest, it’s my...what, third? time now.”
“...So you really do play with them,” Weasley says. His eyes are on the young Slytherins jumping up for rides on the young thestrals.
It doesn’t help that Lee Jordan and a number of other students with cameras have been watching them rebuild, clearly waiting for them to fail again.
as to attack another student, at least no Gryffindor like her. After all, they’ve all been through a War, and everyone should have
Professor McGonagall gets up from her tackle of the Unspeakable, but it’s too late. She can see the cracks in Hogwarts’ magic, the sudden snap of breakage.
After breakfast, Draco talks to Aster and Blaise, planning to hand out badges to the students he was with during the full moon. They may not be Slytherins...but now, Draco can’t let them suffer outside of the night.
His nails turn into claws, tearing through the paper. He has to restrain himself and give the paper to the confused Harry to read.
By the time Blaise finishes opening his gifts, which include a large pile from his mother and from the families of his late step fathers, the Slytherin Commons is bustling with chatter Slytherins showing off their gifts.
“In part,” Draco Malfoy agrees with a faint smile. He looks to the younger students—a mix of Houses—that are slowly levitating mini blocks of stone. “Why don’t you explain to the Headmistress exactly what you’re doing?”
Narcissa Malfoy barely looks at the second article: this is something she has communicated with Minerva McGonagall about. In fact, it should have appeared on the first page of the
On Saturday afternoon, McGonagall calls a halt to the rebuilding and tells everyone to have a good rest.
Draco, Pansy, and Blaise have divided up time slots over the two days of the weekend. Using the empty Head Boy’s chambers as a private office that can be accessed from within Slytherin, at least two of them meet one-by-one with the upper-year Slytherins to discuss careers.
There may also be some extras (😏 future smut 😏) that won’t be in the main story but as part of the series
The next morning, he wakes up full of energy, ready to roll up his sleeves and help rebuild Hogwarts!
“Mr Malfoy, if you have any information about Aegis, it should be reported to the Aurors...” McGonagall frowns.
“This is your fault for inciting duels in the first place!” she reprimands. “Who drew their wand first? Who cast the first spell?! I don’t believe these rumours.”
“Hello, Negs,” Harry said softly to the owl. “Fancy carrying a note for me?” He held out his folded up letter.
The corner of Draco’s mouth lifts in amusement. “No, I can’t stop you at all.” Then, he helps another Slytherin into the back of another thestral wanting to join in on the fun.
“The wound transfer meant that a death-killing fall was divided up between Aster and myself, leading to neither of us dying.”
aftermath simply isn’t as good. After taking off his clothes, Draco’s eyes close briefly before he steps out and transforms.
“You betrayed your own House,” Taylor retorts. “Which makes perfect sense because you’re a slimy Slytherin!”
Flitwick’s expression lightens. “Ah, yes, Rubeus—Hagrid—mentioned whether or not you wanted to accompany him to meet the thestrals again.”
a wand at a portrait!” Filch snaps. Throwing a glare at Draco, Filch steps closer to the portrait. He shoos its occupant out—a witch who has escaped unscathed—and tugs the portrait from the wall.
Minerva McGonagall gives the Aurors in the office an imperious look that makes them all remember the innate fear of a teacher about to reprimand them.
Harry pouts, tilting his head up—just in time for Draco’s supposed-to-be-hair-kiss to land on Harry’s forehead instead.
Madam Pomfrey’s magic immediately joins Flitwicks as they enter the Hospital Wing, and Draco’s set down on a bed. The scent of muskiness and baked goods follow them in.
“...The—what—you! You’re a prick, Draco Lucius Malfoy,” Potter says, words fumbling a tad. It’s definitely
Early Sunday morning, McGonagall is sorting through the mail as usual. She frowns slightly as she finds a number of suspicious packages containing yet more suspicious devices.
“Hermione, Ron, come through here,” Harry says. Once his friends enter, the entrance closes again, leaving the three of them in a small, green-decorated room.
“...Malfoy, I’m an Eighth Year too. Also. Badges? Really?” Harry picks up the Slytherin-S badge with amusement.
balls, Draco magically pulls out a table and chairs and dark pink flowers that have their own slight glow.
Once Pomfrey leaves—with a small vial of Draco’s blood—Flitwick sighs heavily, casting a privacy charm around them.
“It’s the magic that you feel,” Draco says. “The stories say that long ago, the entire earth felt like this. But these days, we are left only with the ley lines, and places with concentrated magic like Hogwarts.”
“Then get dressed, there will be a meeting for all Slytherins leaving the Commons about the soul orb.”
“I understand that you are an accomplished Potions Master,” Draco says, gaze cool. “It is tradition that the Potions Professor is Head of Slytherin.”
As a reward for Draco’s hard work during the parent-teacher interviews, Harry gives him a personal massage~
A sourness grows in his heart as some of his ‘fellow’ Gryffindors, one by one, get lured into friendships with the Slytherins.
“I didn’t know I was a wizard then,” Harry says patiently. “And the Ministry would have locked me up for underage magic, or something.”
And Pansy was wrong—Potter was safe the entire time, because Draco could sense the thestrals just beyond keeping any other Forest creatures away from Potter.
By the large window facing the Great Lake is padded seating, and a Slytherin student communicating via sign language with a small group of merpeople. On the other side of the Common are windows—clearly charmed ones, showing the night sky—and there are square tables and proper chairs where some Slytherins are seated, eating and chatting with relaxed smiles on their faces. There’s also a table with what looks enticingly like trays of biscuits under the slightest glimmer of a preservation charm.
The Slytherins head out to dinner in the Great Hall by shifts. Draco dons a half-hearted costume of long cloak with comically large feathers and joins one of those groups.
Harry’s chest tightens a moment, but he pushes on, “Yes, still. Teddy’s going to be five soon, isn’t he? Surely he could...they have new child-safe ones these days! I’ll be sure to be there to look after him.”
widely at Draco and Harry. “If you two had taken any longer, I might have grabbed your heads and forced you to kiss.”
It takes Draco a bit of work to tease out Potter’s favourite classes and hobbies. Eventually, Draco is able to write out a list of possible careers for Potter to think more about: ranging from charity work (Draco wrote that, because it would suit hero-Harry-Potter), to teaching (Potter says that Granger suggested it), to baker (on account of Potter’s sweet tooth and Draco refilling Potter’s hot chocolate
Pansy snorts, while Draco sheepishly replies, “I crush them, while carefully channelling the magic back to where it should go.”
“It would be very nice if we other Heads of Houses had similar robes to yours, Mr Malfoy,” Flitwick says. Since his makeover a few years past, he has become more aware of robes and their styles.
“You should,” Draco said gently. “Your friends love you. Go have dinner with them, and talk it out, whatever it is.”
In the privacy of Draco’s mind, he’s allowed to much prefer Lovegood and Ginevra at the Slytherin table than to Granger and Weasley. At least Lovegood and Ginevra don’t look at Draco as though he’s trying to steal their precious child.
Although Hufflepuff and Slytherin have been re-integrated, they still need to undergo some renovations. Because of this, the Hufflepuff students move back into their temporary accommodation—
, they certainly separated in time! I’ll go talk to the Minister before McGonagall twists her words. She may be the Headmistress, but Hogwarts is a state school! Does she want to sue us for breaking Hogwarts? Well, we can do the same thing!”
He doesn’t ask though, looking at Harry’s dark expression that appears when he thinks no one is looking.
can’t cast a Patronus charm?” Harry teases. “I was successful in my third year. I must be a genius!”
Harry's missed out on so much of his dad’s culture, both the wizarding and the Indian side. What about Samhain and Yule, that Draco had to teach Harry about?
Draco’s expression immediately drops. He holds Harry and turns his head to the snickering students. “Is that how you talk to your step father and your step-step father?”
Michelle runs up to support Ella, and the group of them start heading off. Jamie throws back a concerned look, but he quickly looks away when Draco gives him a stern look.
When they enter the Forest, Aster starts looking for potions ingredients—they’re not here to help Draco, but rather taking the opportunity to forage. Mesa goes along with them.
Harry blushed brilliantly. Not only from Malfoy’s words, but also from the fact that Malfoy was half-literally holding him. “We-we shouldn’t kiss unless we’re official boyfriends!”
Draco and the other Head of Houses also spread out, such that they and McGonagall stand at equal points of a pentagon, with Hogwarts’ heartstone by McGonagall’s side.
Draco doesn’t like it. He doesn’t like the idea of any of the Slytherins going through all that pain.
“Don’t make me ask Pansy to watch you all do your assignments later,” Draco concedes. “Come along, then.”
, aside from everything else, wouldn’t it be so cool to have a Head of House that can turn into a dragon?!”
As part of fanfiction writing, some words (e.g. character names, places, spells) are much more common. This makes it more difficult to distinguish different authors. This is compounded by the fact that some authors
Harry reaches out and grabs Draco’s robes, his green eyes picking up all the low pre-dawn light. “Luckily McGonagall was there…”
Draco sets his quill down and looks up to see two first years. Alyss Singh is pushing Francis Mallow forward.
Pansy folds up all the various papers and throws them on one of the coffee tables in the Slytherin Commons, yawning. The other students can read them and laugh at the Ministry later.
Wolf Martin and wolf-Mesa, after seeing Nolan presenting his stomach to Mr Malfoy, finally trot over.
“Does O’Conor really think this kind of transfigured furniture is suitable for Hogwarts? Transfigured furniture is for poor people!” Ellis says, wrinkling his nose. “They should get real chairs. What if the transfiguration reverses in the middle of class?”
—Professor Garren has holed himself up in his tent, presumably to mark some assignments. Just a while ago, he had been hovering with the other professors who are answering all the students’ questions, but no one wanted to ask him about anything aside from potions.
Harry stares at Draco for a moment. “Suspicious, Malfoy.” He lifts his plate with two hands. His eyes grow wide.
Draco pulls out his protective badge, tapping it to activate. “Felicity. Can you increase the power?”
Draco inclines his head slightly. Seeing as the ritual is over, Draco breaks from the formation first, strolling to his Slytherins-and-extras.
The next morning, Harry woke up with an unusual yet familiar sensation. He tightened reflexively. A deep red flush came over him when he realised that Draco’s cock was still inside him.
“Keep saying it like that, and Pansy will think we’re shagging,” Draco says with a roll of his eyes. “Blaise probably already does.”
Draco resists the urge to rub his temples at the two children clamouring for his attention in the middle of a Hogwarts corridor. He was never this annoying when he was their age.
Draco and Blaise share a look. Blaise heads up to the mezzanine library area, while Draco walks to the central firepit.
Garren’s face goes a little frozen. “It is known that he and another Eighth Year Slytherin have been liaising with the Headmistress…” His smile fades slightly when he spots the contingent of house-elves arriving too, along with the Hogwarts ghosts.
,” Draco drawls. He takes off his boots and situates himself near the middle of the nest. Harry settles down next to him, on the opposite side of Nolan. The students settle around him, fur and legs and tails overlapping, bodies half in, half out of the blankets.
. It has fallen due to the removal of Slytherin, which was enforced by the Wizengamot bill. Hogwarts has fallen because of disunity. Slytherin might have been pulling away from the other three Houses, but that does not excuse the blatant bullying that some of you committed. Do you remember my request for House unity at the beginning of the year? Now, look at what Hogwarts has become. It can only be rebuilt if we all work together.”
Draco remained silent. He was afraid that if he talked, his eyes would start watering and then Harry would
that worries him, that urges him to pluck Harry away from the Gryffindor table to the relative safety of Slytherin.
The sound of pecking at the door wakes Draco up. It’s barely 5am. Draco extracts himself from Harry and Blaise, pulling the blankets back up again.
Draco’s eyes narrow at the Ravenclaw student side-eyeing Slytherin and Gryffindor and where Harry is sitting. He makes a strike against them in his heart.
Draco’s eyes darkened. A moment later, he pushed Harry back down on the sofa, dropping kisses on Harry’s cheeks, on his forehead, on his nose, and a little nibble on his ear...
The next morning, Mary Green tries to visit the Forbidden Forest, her face pale with lack of sleep. Unfortunately, she bumps into Madam Pomfrey near the edge of the Forest.
One of the theorists says to a journalist, “McGonagall has made great progress! Hogwarts’ magic is fully integrated, the seamlessness is amazing! Mark my words, I’ll be applying for a grant to further study how this can be possible…”
Draco Malfoy, dressed in his Head-of-Slytherin robes, stands complacently next to Professor Flitwick.
At this time, most students are in their classes, so the grounds of Hogwarts are relatively quiet. Many officials have eyes towards the Slytherin building, but McGonagall steers them away from it and to the castle instead.
have gone to Malfoy Manor, or waited for dinner with Andromeda, but the threat of Narcissa Malfoy is too great.
Draco’s jaw tightens. He can feel the tug in his chest. His Slytherins are so close—they must be in one of the classrooms on the corridor yonder, cleaning.
a good boy) had kept inside of him. Draco avoided Harry’s prostate, wanting to keep Harry this pliant for just a while longer.
In the evening, Draco takes Potter with him to Snape’s old office and the potions laboratory. Aster is already there, and Draco assists them on brewing Wolfsbane. Neither of them tell Potter what they’re brewing. Draco easily side-tracks Potter by making him re-brew a potion they recently did in class, but now
“Why are they both chocolate?” Hedge grumbles, despite taking a bite. “You should have an assortment instead!”
, he’s put in a group with two other boys, neither of them Slytherins. Under Flitwick’s stern eye, everyone in each group must introduce themselves to their new group-mates.
Madam Pomfrey continues to look unamused. “And I suppose Mr Potter will sneak out again once I leave.”
Draco closes his eyes, but he’s highly aware of Harry next to him, from the sound of his breath, to the warmth from his body, to the bond that connects them.
A hand rubs his head. Harry’s heart immediately goes all soft. It definitely means something! He turns his head to Draco.
“As for the other subjects, I can teach the Slytherins Transfiguration. Professor Coates has also suggested a muggle field trip to allow students to mingle and become acquainted with each other in a different setting.”
More important is the progress of Hogwarts. As both a Head of House and as the person that directly led to the separation of Hogwarts, Draco has a responsibility to ensure that the new Hogwarts is even better.
Potter laughs, eyes curving in humour. “No that’s right, you’re going to have a threesome marriage with Zabini and Parkinson…”
The sharp-eyed crowd had seen Harry’s turn. Those at the head of the pack skidded to a stop at the side-alley entrance, grinning.
The glimmers of magic at the corner of Draco’s eyes are based on how Tris Chandler sees magic in the Circle of Magic series~ (I’m basically putting in my fave magic tropes and concepts lol. But as Author, I’m allowed!!). Also, want to read more about Sentient Hogwarts from me? There is a bit of it towards the end of
The house was toasty warm compared to the icy coldness outside. Harry took off his jacket, throwing it on the sofa. Then he slowly unwound the scarf and held it out to Malfoy, hesitantly looking up at him.
looking away,” Flitwick says. “You're one of my best students. You know dozens of shield charms. You could invent your own, I would imagine.”
Draco’s heart felt like a little Harry-shaped-paw was gently scratching at it. He stood up and pulled Harry up against him and hugged him. Not too tightly, because he was afraid.
“We’re doing that now,” Harry confirmed, and leaned down to kiss him. More than words, their actions showed, and Draco could believe that they finally both understood each other.
And as a compromise to Jamie and many other students who dreamt of a slide inside the castle, McGonagall has agreed that the students can build a playground outside instead, and new fields are marked out for games that aren’t quidditch.
“Well, obviously, my dear mother,” Draco says. “And by extension, my father. But as I understand it, the Owls to Malfoy Manor are tracked, and my father has a Ministry tracker, and I assume the Ministry has been diligent in their surveillance.”
At Hogwarts, however, the air is much more relaxed. By the end of lunch, Minister for Magic Shacklebolt has approved the paperwork and Hogwarts officially becomes an independent school.
When Draco presses a hand against the wall, the magic underneath jumps and swirls. It presses against Draco’s fingers, and flitters when Draco impulsively transfers a touch of magic.
which contains text that cannot be directly used in machine learning, into input like this for example:
Draco rolls his eyes. He says drily, “I noticed when you followed me into the Hospital Wing. Don’t play blind, Potter.”
“You need to rest and recover for the day tomorrow. We can’t have you working dead on your feet,” Draco said, voice brooking no argument.
Harry didn’t. He and his partner, back then, had moved to a different place. But Harry invited him over to his current flat, and it was
He retrieves his mother’s weekly package, trying to calm down. He puts one of the chocolates into his mouth. It melts immediately, flooding his mouth with sweetness as he opens her letter, detailing trivialities about the weather and gardening. Under his gaze, the cipher spell rearranges and the true words are revealed.
He gets up and goes over and kneels down on one knee. He takes Harry’s warm brown hand in his own and looks into Harry’s green eyes.
“Alright, Slytherins,” Draco raises his voice. “Go back from whence you came, unless you want to help me clean up.”
“Don’t worry, Potter, there’s no need for a diviner. If there is anything you need...Pansy will surely help you.”
“Their plan is fundamentally flawed. They are using Hogwarts stone to rebuild. Stone that has been soaked in the magic of all the four houses for a thousand years. The Ministry is trying to use this stone to build something that Hogwarts itself is fundamentally against...” Blaise sighs. “If the Ministry chooses to build in a new location with fresh stone, the new castle
Harry and Draco continue their atrocious amounts of PDA (dog food), even though it’s not yet Valentine’s Day. (The students shudder to think what they’ll do on Valentine’s day…)
Harry gathers Hermione and Ron into a comforting hug—for them. “I’ll be fine,” he says confidently, tugging them along as he follows Malfoy and Zabini out of the Great Hall.
Draco grabs his hand and puts it on Draco’s cock instead. “Prepare me then,” he says coolly. “You’re still loose, aren’t you? Come on, Harry.”
“It’s Christmas, and it’s my last year here,” Harry is saying, getting on the front stage. “And I wanted to show my appreciation for you.” With Jamie’s help, he pulls out a number of wrapped gifts. Checking names, Harry hands one to each amused and confused Hogwarts Professor present. “Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas,” Harry says cheerfully.
Draco lets the pressure of the dragon press down on them for the briefest of moments, forcing the wolves to bow their heads a little more. “As long as they stay peaceful,” he says coolly.
have to see all day.” He runs his fingers up the column of Harry’s neck, splaying them possessively against Harry’s cheek, Draco’s pale fingers against Harry’s deep warm skin.
When Harry attempts to greet a student from Ravenclaw who had participated in the winter break daily snowfights, the student gives the briefest of return greetings and hurries away.
