“But he wasn’t a monster to me, was he?” Draco spat back. “He gave me a home when I didn’t have one, he gave me food when I was hungry, gave me kindness and attention.” He smiled viciously. “Like you.”
After a moment of fussing with the dial, Harry found the station, the announcer calling out the names of the players on the field, the cheers from the crowd still overwhelmingly loud at the sound of Ginny. And Harry was grateful to be home listening to the game rather than braving the stands, although Ginny had been disappointed.
Lucious Malfoy died on January 1st. Neville told Harry when he poked his head into Savage’s office in the middle of the afternoon on the 2nd, “Did you hear Malfoy killed himself over the holiday?”
“Can you have a relationship with someone you only dream about? I haven’t seen the man with my own eyes since my trial.” Draco sat back and crossed his arms. “Does your lover like to take walks through Muggle London during your lunch hour?”
And Harry pulled back abruptly, “I don’t know that. He’s probably been kidnapped by people who kill Werewolves,” he said, his voice rough and broken.
He should probably say something more, explain, something. But those words felt right, and he didn’t have any more. And besides, there was something else he needed to do, something more important.
“Yes, because my parents don’t have millions of Galleons stashed away to bribe anyone who might know, to purchase ingredients and illegally brewed potions, and blah blah blah.”
And then there were painfully bright lights, and the squeak of sneakers on tile, the sounds of beeping and labored breathing. And Grace’s voice, “Tell me where we are.”
Harry nodded at her, and then turned to George. “Mind if we go through the shop? It’ll make less of a fuss.”
Harry was struck a bit dumb by the look on Draco’s face, faltered just slightly at the sight, and then promptly stumbled over his own two feet. He flailed to keep from pitching onto the table, his hand weaving in the air, tea slopping over the side of the cup.
Draco laughed lightly. “You are terrible at this.” And moved his own hands to push Harry’s trousers to the floor before pulling him closer and thrusting his cock lazily against Harry’s. He undid his own button and zip and began pushing Harry closer to the bed, not bothering to finish what Harry had started with his shirt.
“You seem quite popular with your students.” Harry did not emphasize the female part, because he was still trying to maintain a friendly attitude.
Harry stepped back. “I think you’ve got a dislocated shoulder, James. Let me fix it for you.” He took out his wand, and James flinched just a little, just enough to let Harry know he was muggle too. “Merlin help us.” That registry was worthless. “Episkey.” Harry cast, and they all watched as James’s arm moved back into place.
“It sounds like you are making good time.” She slowly turned the crank on the first generator. There was a low whine of warning.
Hermione gave Teddy a smile. “Malfoy isn’t very nice, but then I wasn’t very nice either. I was hoping that he and I could make a fresh start, put all that past behind us.”
“Yep. Atkinson informed me Monday afternoon via memo that he had recovered his lost artifact and our services were no longer needed. I would have informed you earlier, obviously, but with all that chaos, I hadn’t even seen the memo until this morning.”
He was a little distracted and didn’t see Oliver lurking near the corner, but he certainly felt his grabby hands on his bicept while the bartender was pouring the ale. “Harry,” he exhaled wetly into Harry’s ear.
Across from the loo, three people stumbled out of a room, and Harry suddenly couldn’t look away from them. The tall one looked a bit like a thug with tattoos peeking out from underneath his shirt. And then Harry shouted, “Tetchy Bloke!”
Millicent and Goyle exchanged sad looks, and Millicent put down her muffin. “We have. She owled us right away, and I’m sorry, but we haven’t heard from him.”
Draco felt a bit like he might not breathe. “I take my work very seriously, Thomas. It is imperative that these devices be protected from residual and accidental magic due to the electricity. I am not sure how many times I need to explain this. I have created several generators.” He explained as if to a small child. “They create electricity, the muggle discovery that powers things. Electricity and magic don’t mix well, and often explode when combined. I never use magic in my lab as I enjoy using all of my limbs.” He crossed his arms angrily.
“Not helping.” Harry took another drink and looked through the room. “Maybe I should approach someone?”
The muttering did not stop, and it was entirely possible that Draco broke several shepherdesses in his effort to search through them all. Nothing a quick reparo couldn’t fix, but each time Draco’s shoulders got a little tighter and his language a little more colorful. “Bleeding bints, tarts the lot of you. Not a pillow biter in the lot.”
And Draco thought of Sawyer that day, out in the crowd. Draco had been at the Ministry for probation, and couldn’t--his head all a mess with anger and loneliness, feeling trapped. And he’d gone outside rather than to the floos, and he’d smelled him in the crowd. He’d been thinking about what it was like at the Manor surrounded by his parents and all those awful memories. And then it wafted over, that beautiful, warm scent, like chocolate. Their eyes had met through the crowd, and it was like Teddy, but more tentative, gentle and sort of confused. But they’d both accepted before they’d known, circled through the crowd until they’d met. And Draco had stuck out his hand, “Hello, Draco Malfoy. You?”
“I swear I will help you fulfill your vow to me.” And Harry sliced his hand, deeper than Malfoy had done and the blood poured out dripping onto the floor. And Harry pressed their hands together hard and then harder.
But Harry didn’t want to hear them. Malfoy could say any of a thousand things, but in that tone, with that expression, Harry knew he didn’t want to hear a single one. Somehow this thing between them had become important. It was going to end, would have to end, but not right now, not today. “Please.” He kissed Malfoy. “Please come with me.”
“Behind you.” And Sawyer turned to look, locked eyes with Potter, and then turned back into Draco’s arms, pushed himself a touch closer. “You go tell the others. I’ll distract Potter.”
Harry had all but moved back into Grimmauld Place in the following two weeks, only returning to the flat twice for laundry. He slept in his old room, across the hall from Jude, and he made no comment when he nearly bowled Sarah over in the hall on his way to the loo while she had been creeping into Jude’s room. It was easy to fall into habits there, to make eggs and pancakes for breakfast, to spend the morning rehabbing the dining room (since there were three of them in the house now), to spend the afternoon trying to adjust the clutch on the Triumph.
Sometimes, when Harry looked at Draco, there was this desperate clawing thing inside his chest that ached fiercely. He’d stand in the doorway of the Stubborn Goat, or see the peek of his blond hair over the blankets in the bed or the frown on his face from across a crowd, and he’d
Maybe it was the dim light, but Harry suddenly thought of Malfoy in the club, with his head thrown back and his leg thrust between Sawyer’s. It was a different sort of relaxed, a different sort of openness, but there were so few people Harry had seen those same states. He and Ginny had gone clubbing a few times, back when Harry had more free time during Auror training and before she accepted an offer with the HolyHead Harpies. She was probably the only other one Harry had seen with her head thrown back, long hair shaking to the off beat of the club and clumped up on the pillow where she’d scrapped the tangled mess from the back of her neck to sleep.
But they were all here for the match, and a celebratory dinner at the Sleeping Noggin Harry had arranged as a surprise. Since he didn’t work as much as everyone else.
“You look like you could use a bite, hm?” Molly hummed at him. “Didn’t they feed you at all at that school?”
With that reminder, he stood up and went down to the parlour. God it was nice that the floo worked again, no more stepping outside in the horrible weather to apparate. Andromeda was sitting in there reading a book and enjoying the quiet while Teddy was out on a playdate.
When Harry looked back at the door a few minutes later, he reminded himself it was early still, that there was plenty of time, that Draco wouldn’t show up if there was work to do at the Port, and on a Friday night there was sure to be plenty of work to finish.
“Oh please, you think that line works on anyone? You’ve been so caught up in him forever. Maybe not so much lately, but if you’re lightning, he’s the tallest tree around, and that’s probably not ever going to change.”
And Draco squeezed his eyes shut to hold back the onslaught. There was work to do, and then a movie to watch, and tomorrow there would be deliveries, and Evan had some new beer he wanted to taste. And Draco had been thinking it was time to add something to the specialty menu. This was where he was supposed to be, this was where he could make a difference and prove his worth. And he could make other people’s lives better by just staying out of them. “Alright, Mint Chocolate Chip it is.”
“I am sure he would be delighted.” Astoria smiled brightly at Draco and then turned back to Hermione and carried on with the conversation.
He couldn’t hope for more than that, no matter how kind Andromeda was or how comfortable he felt in the house. Those hopes and needs weren’t ever going to be fulfilled. And certainly not from Potter! Potter was never going to be the one to hand Draco a cool cloth when the wolfsbane made him sick, and Potter wasn’t going to go clubbing with him when he couldn’t sit still inside for one second longer. And Potter wasn’t going to sit next to him at meals and hold his hand, or wrap his arm around Draco’s waist, or press their foreheads together. Or let Draco do any of those things to him.
“I swear I will! I will shout it out here in the hall until every fucking person in this building knows. And then I’m going to march out into the street and shout until everyone there hears. I’m going to take out an advert in every fucking paper!”
Tilly reached over for the coffee pot and filled the two cups. “Him or her?” she asked, pouring a ridiculous amount of sugar into hers.
He was busy thinking about how the rings would look on Ginny’s finger when Ron gave a little gasp and said, “Oh, a fede ring.” He peered closely at a display of men’s rings.
“Usually, when I talk about this kind of stuff, I’m drunk or in the middle of a panic attack or talking to my therapist. I lack the skills needed for your crisis.”
Malfoy was still on the floor, but sitting up, when Harry reappeared wrapped in a towel. He had one leg down and one leg up and leaned his head against his knee. Harry noticed he was still wearing the same joggers. He grabbed the first trousers and shirt he saw and threw them in Malfoy’s direction. “Take a shower and put those on.”
Evan and Tilly rushed out of Tilly’s room and then froze in the doorway when Draco turned to look at Tilly. She took in the streaks on his cheeks and the way his shoulders tilted inwards. “Oh Dray, what happened?”
It was a small flat, with the kitchen right off the entry, a small living room, and a short hall with two bedrooms and a bath. Harry could see just about everything from the doorway. Mrs. Green was standing at the counter, fussing with a plate of biscuits on a trey while the kettle boiled. There were dirty dishes in the sink and an empty skillet on the stove. Harry had to look away, but the living room wasn’t much better. There was a pile of photo albums on the table next to a box of tissues.
“I know!” Draco dared to lift his head and look Harry in the eye, and then repeated softly. “I know. And part of what makes me not that person any more is that I don’t live in that world anymore. I don’t do magic, and I don’t go to wizarding places. I do this now.” He gestured to the office around him.
And Harry twisted his wrists, still pinned the wall above him. He wanted to be closer, wanted to catch Draco, to touch him and do some licking of his own. And he wanted to stay there, pinned to the wall, listening to the sounds Draco was making and feeling the weight of him. Harry might have whined a little.
“She doesn’t love you any more than you love her,” Draco pointed out. “And okay, you want to be able to see James and Lily and Al all the time and that will be bad. But Al is going to be leaving in a few months for Hogwarts anyway. And Lily, shouldn’t Lily get the chance to know Dean? I’m not saying you should give her up or anything, but aren’t two dads better than one? Just promise me you’ll think about it?”
“I-I’m just grateful to be able to see you, my son.” She reached out and ran a hand down his arm. “I’ve missed you.”
“Never mind, I’ll just give her my mobile and Tilly can tell her.” Harry looked up from the floor and at Jude. “It’s going to be okay. I won’t let anything happen to Sarah. I will get you guys out of there. I promise, okay?”
They kept moving forward in that slow, carefully way until there was a crash of breaking glass and a loud thump on creaky metal. Ron and Harry looked at each other and then Ron quickly apparated on to the fire escape. “Petrificus Totalus!” Ron shouted, and Harry heard the sound of a body hitting the staircase.
Malfoy froze, hands still on his head, and the items in the room froze and hung in the air. “No no no!” He crouched down on the floor and began rocking back and forth. “No!”
Draco sighed lovingly. “Yeah, you naked with your hands full of clean dishes. What’s not to like? Are you really staying?”
Harry was surprised to see just how short she was in the house of amazon women. Draco dropped Harry’s hand and strode over to the hob where he bent and pressed a kiss to Mama Gigi’s cheek. She smiled, cheeks turning just the faintest bit pink. “And where have you been all day, young man. Those pies are not going to bake themselves!”
Henri chuckled softly. “He is certainly stubborn.” He placed the cork carefully on the edge of the crate. “I will leave you to your work now.”
Oh, I didn't really think about this while I was writing the notes, but there should probably be a warning of some kind for this chapter. I don't want to give too much away, but there is some self harm and discussions of abusive relationships. If anybody sees anything else that needs a more specific warning, please let me know so that I can fix that in these notes. Thanks!
It felt like a different kind of betrayal, to be the one left behind to pick up the pieces of someone else’s broken life.
“Uh huh,” she said with no sincerity at all, “And it didn’t have anything to do at all with that bloke trying to put a baby in your man.”
Harry took a breath and remembered that Draco didn’t know, that he hadn’t said the words out loud to anyone other than his therapist. Not Ron or Hermione, there wasn’t anyone else he wanted to tell. He was ashamed that it had taken him so long to find the courage. So Harry took a breath and closed his eyes, and found the words right there where he had left them. “For a long time, I couldn’t give you those things. I couldn’t be your friend.”
“What happened to you?” Harry stepped closer, tilted Malfoy’s face up to see the damage more clearly. He held his wand to the edge of the swelling, where it would be the least painful and muttered, “Episkey.”
“Um, definitely more smoke, and,” Draco tried to remember what the whiskey had tasted like, but just remembered the feeling of being in that room with Potter. “You know, I only tasted it the once, and it was sort of a-a--” He clenched his hand around the glass. “That was around the time I tried to burn off the Dark Mark.” He said it loudly, confidently, to cover up his uncertainty and fear.
Harry pressed his lips together in a thin line and looked at Draco. Truthfully, he didn’t know what Draco would want him to do, but going to the Ministry was the right thing to do. Was the place where he could do something.
And Luis knelt down again, put his bowl of blood on the edge of the bed, and soothed both hands down Draco’s face. “Oh, do not worry. I will not leave you alone with the Fwooper for long. With the Philosopher's Stone and the last living follower of Voldemort at my side, I will remake this world as it was meant to be. I will save you.” He ran a soothing hand across Draco’s arm.
After the science program, they watched a program on foxes, and when Harry started to gather the dirty dishes, Malfoy stood up too. “You cooked. I should clean.”
Draco shook his head, and then corrected himself. “I mean, he came into my interrogation room, but not since then.” He swallowed and pulled himself up. Better not to think about that interruption.
Draco was laying down on the bench; he had been trying to nap all afternoon, the guard kept coming in and poking him every time he drifted off. “I know many things. Which one are you talking about now?”
Jenkins rolled her eyes, and started tapping away at her computer. Technically, Roxi wasn’t supposed to track phones without a supervisor’s approval, but most everyone in the department used the software to keep track of errant children or siblings. Draco was usually the one tracking down Marie or Lacy for Roxie.
And Harry did the only thing he could to rectify the situation, he shut the door and locked it with a loud, “Colloportus!” It wouldn’t keep her out for long, but maybe long enough.
Draco flipped open the top and stared down at the ring inside. “It’s a Fede ring.” He didn’t sound excited or confused or anything, just said the words dumbly, staring at the little silver ring nestled into it’s velvet box.
Hermione took a seat in the chair closest to Sarah. “I thought it best if we spoke privately.” She glanced at the cuffs restricting Sarah to the bench. “If I take those off, are you going to attack me?”
Jude went very still on the sofa. “Actually, I was thinking about looking for a Muggle job.” He said it too casually.
“I’m actually looking for someone, and I was wondering if you maybe saw him around.” Harry showed her the picture of Malfoy.
“It will do,” Draco replied, opening the first drawer to see a selection of knives. He placed his bag on the counter and opened the next drawer, systematically noting the range of supplies and tools. He didn’t notice when Hermione left.
“I don’t know.” Harry tried to focus on his curry, but couldn’t seem to force his fork to his mouth.
“Look, Sampson, help!” Jones, Harry was pretty sure her name was Jones but had to double check her name tag to be sure, smiled brightly. “It’s always nice to have help.” She was young, or at least younger than Harry. Lots of trainees who failed out of the Auror Academy ended up in booking, reception, or archives. And she was pretty too, with a heart shaped face and soft curls, dressed in a navy blouse and matching skirt.
Harry rolled to the side, just enough that he could lay down and press his lips against Draco’s ear without having to hold himself up or crush him. He threw his leg over Draco’s hip and his arm over his chest to rest on that tangle of scars. Harry pressed closer to Draco, as close as he could and whispered, “Draco Lucius Malfoy, you are the most contradictory man I have ever met, and I love you fiercely.”
Draco flicked the phone again and stared at the screen, the screen that had lit up an hour ago with a text from Neil. A text that changed their “date” to five pm today, at some little coffee shop about three minutes from his job and nearly thirty minutes from the bar. “Manipulative prick,” Draco muttered, and then smacked his phone before it spun off the counter.
Harry stepped up to the bar and ordered a water, leaned against the counter and scanned the crowd. There was a couple on the dance floor with particularly grabby hands, a girl sobbing into her drink at a table not too far away, and a man down the counter seated at a stool caught Harry’s eye and splayed his knees wider. Harry stared at his crotch for half a second before catching himself, shaking his head, and gratefully taking the water from the bartender.
He stilled again and slowly turned around, but Granger had already gone. For a moment Draco couldn’t breath. It was, perhaps, a bit premature, but the whole day had gone rather a lot better than he had imagined it would. Of course, he was only halfway through the first day, and he had yet to see Mother at the Manor which he had avoided rather pointedly for ten years. Surely that would be when the other shoe fell.
The Chinese take-away covered the kitchen table. She’d brought noodles and pork, some sort of prawn dish, a curried beef thing with rice, aubergines, and some vegetable rice combination.
And the truth was so much worse, “I--He’s--” Harry looked at Ginny and then said quietly, “I think he’s my friend.”
“Sorry, Harry!” Andromeda shouted from the kitchen. They all long since learned not to open the door when they heard the floo or the smoke would billow out into the hallway and onto the stairs. Teddy loved it when they had, running through the house, leaving sooty footprints, and then squealing loudly as Harry hauled him into the bath.
“Why, yes.” Astoria suddenly looked very pleased. “Blaise and I share several hobbies, and I often have lunch with him. His experiments into magical signatures are fascinating, and I enjoy discussing the origins of magic.”
Harry wasn’t exactly in a good mood when he arrived at work an hour later. Malfoy had used up all the hot water and then proceeded to sit, cross-legged, on the balcony floor bickering with himself, which Harry only knew because he spent several minutes trying to break into the argument to find out if Malfoy wanted some eggs which resulted in a loud shout of “Fucking Questions!” At which point Harry slammed the door shut and tried to drown himself in coffee.
On and on Dean asked. Never about the subjects of the dreams but the mechanics of them. What potions did Draco take, how often did he dream, how often did he have regular dreams. What his emotional state had been at the time of each dream, had he drunk any alcohol. On and on and on.
Evan glanced down at the other end where Tilly whispered desperately to Draco. He turned back to Harry and said, “I don’t like you.”
And Harry couldn’t help but line himself up and push hard and fast. Draco cried out and clenched tight around him, because he wasn’t loose, not quite enough, and he wasn’t wet, not quite enough. But Harry couldn’t wait to do things properly, and he bit down on Draco’s shoulder, and Draco shuddered, hands clawing desperately in his shirt and hips bucking wildly to get Harry to move faster and harder and deeper.
They both sipped in silence for a moment, and then Dan asked, “Do you want to get out of here with me?”
“You’re drunk,” Malfoy gasped, when Harry moved from his mouth to his neck and sucked. “I-I-god that’s nice.” He moaned when Harry licked the corner of his jaw. “Harry,” he pushed Harry’s head away enough to look him in the eye. “Is this what you want?”
“I can’t take you to the hospital,” Dean said. “But I can let you see Harry.” He put the vial in his pocket. “If you tell Ron--” he uncapped the vial and poured it on the ground.
After much thinking and gnashing of teeth, I kind of thought it would be interesting/funny if a lot of wizarding music was just bad covers of muggle music. (Seriously, imagine it, Narcissa, Lucius, tiny Draco opening Christmas presents and listening to a cover of All I Want For Christmas is My Two Front Teeth, Lucius humming under his breath while Draco tears through wrapping paper.) And so, Draco likes music, likes listening to it with his Mum and, were he a muggle, would be the kind of high schooler who insists on getting his records on vinyl. Like, he would be SUPER pretentious about his music. But, because wizarding music just isn't great, he never quite gets into. Until he makes some muggle friends (spoiler alert, he makes muggle friends in this story) and discovers that wizarding music is like 60% covers and then dives head first into the music world and develops this sort of insane love of covers--good covers, bad covers, all the covers, loves them remorselessly. So, if you are paying attention to the links, there are quite a few covers including this cover of Girl Put Your Record On.
She gave him a small smile. “And here I thought all those nights you and Harry were having terribly loud sex.”
Which Maisie did. Because she was observant like a good Auror should be. With one last concerned look in his direction, she went back to her paperwork, and Harry owled a request for the records from Malfoy’s probation meetings and then began to furiously scribble on his own account of yesterday’s interviews
He took a break for lunch around 2pm and then went back to his desk to plan. By the end of the day, he hadn’t come up with a single one that was actually workable. There was just too much he didn’t know. Where was Draco? Was Atkinson holding him somewhere or was he there willingly? Why had Atkison carved into Draco? Were there other Unspeakables working with him? Hermione said he was unpopular, but that didn’t mean he worked alone. What was the security like? It had been unpleasant before, surely it would be worse now.
Harry shook his head. “Not usually, but I like to come here to let loose. I live close and no one here knows me.”
And Harry looked at Draco, at his grey eyes and the way his hair fell across his forehead, at the pinkness of his lips and the paleness of his eyelashes. He remembered walking into the kitchen in his dream and the pleased feeling in his belly. “We’re fighting.”
“I wasn’t saying you should.” Harry took the plates from her. “I didn’t have a point to make. I was just thinking.”
And the conversation turned to a lively debate on the various pros and cons of different restaurants. Draco suggested Indian which Hermione whole-heartedly seconded, but then Harry suggested they go someplace more British as Draco would be leaving the continent.
Back at the table, the parents were discussing an upcoming charity ball. Astoria slid into the conversation easily, but Draco found it difficult to focus. He kept clenching and unclenching his hand under the table, and his quiet was noticed. Narcissa gave her son several concerned glances, and he gave her a tight smile in return.
“Really, that’s your question?” Draco drank more of his tea. “Probably around the time I was eight. My tutor told me the story of how he defeated the Dark Lord. I was an impressionable youth. When did yours?”
Draco pushed his bacon around on the plate with one finger. “Wolfsbane is poisonous, right? But everybody has a different tolerance level, so what would have killed Nicole would have just made Mark very sick. He was the most tolerant Were I’ve ever met, it would have taken two or three times the level of wolfsbane to kill him. And Nicole never took the stuff, except the one time.” He shrugged and then bit into the bacon.
Hermione elbowed Ron until he stood up too. “We ought to get home too.” She slid out of the bench and everyone said their goodbyes as they walked towards the door.
He shook his head, and she touched his arm again, lighter this time, hesitantly. “Yes, I’m--” His gaze caught on her red hair and yellow dress. This was Ginny, love of his life and all that rot. He took a deep breath. “Yeah, I’m alright.”
Back in the dining room, he made polite conversation, nibbled at the cake and made no motion to touch his coffee. Astoria could offer him everything he had wanted, a chance to restore his family’s reputation, the chance to make a difference in the prejudices of England, potentially an heir to carry on the family name. Desires that he had given up when he decided to study in America. After the trial, after that horrible war, he had resigned himself to being a footnote in history books, a comment on how the Malfoy family after centuries of racism and bigotry had made strides to right their wrongs. It would, of course, have looked nothing like that, more like *Draco Malfoy would later invent the potion to allow magic and electricity to coincide, perhaps in response to the horrible guilt he felt for the part his family played in the war”. And even that, he felt was overly ambitious.
Abruptly, Malfoy dropped the hand at his mouth and turned to Harry. His eyes were darting back and forth between Harry and the front door, Harry and the kitchen window, Harry and the bedroom. “Answers? Questions,” he said quickly, nervously, and went back to biting his thumb. “No question. Wrong answer. Find the answer, then find the question.”
Harry didn’t and he had some questions now about wolfsbane. He could take Teddy to school and then stop at Malfoy’s flat. “Thanks.” Harry nodded and gathered his things.
He had been scheduling deliveries, most importantly the brewing equipment he and Tilly had purchased for Evan, since he’d arrived that morning at 11. And now, he was covering Tilly’s lunch, then he’d dash off for the stupid meeting, and then manage the bar until closing. Which was fine, but long, and made all the longer still by annoying dealings with manipulative people who were going to hoard information over Draco until they got what they wanted, regardless of whether Draco wanted to give it.
Ginny nodded and licked her lips. “Just after the war it was like you were so full of life, you were so passionate and loving and just full. But then it was like that slowly drained out of you, and it was hard for all of us to watch. When we saw you with Trevor, it was sort of like the light came back into your eyes. You looked so happy.”
“We come back.” But it was a question that bothered Harry for the five hours they spent walking through West End. It was a quiet night, and the hours passed slowly, which gave Harry plenty of time to decide on breakfast, the opportunity to pick a location, to second guess that choice, to find a different one.
Draco squinted and tried to decide if it was worth arguing with the man. “Can I have some water?” He rubbed his tongue around in his mouth.
Ron ignored his comment and picked the first journal up off the table to flip through the pages to the right date. “I want to know about this date.” He pushed the journal across the table.
“You’re okay. We’ve got you.” Harry started to stand, hauling Draco up with him. “Come on, let’s get you to St Mungos and then call Roxi.”
“He didn’t know where he was when he woke up, and he kept talking about blood and darkness.” Harry watched her push the needle into Draco’s arm, and Draco groaned.
Draco had not gone far, having paused to cross the Black-Water twice before there was more screaming from the Not-Prey and more of the Not-Pack. Three of them, and they smelled of the Crackle. The Crackle did not come from them, but from some other wolf, a Not-Wolf-Wolf, who crackled into the air in front of Draco with the Crackle Stick. Draco had a Crackle Stick, but no way to wield it in this form.
“But not about Pack.” Malfoy went back to scraping his nails along the cup. “I can’t tell you that. I can tell you they wouldn’t have done something like this.”
And Tilly watched too, with her perfect view from behind the counter of the three of them. She saw that hopeful, earnest expression replace the nervous one that had been plaguing him since Sarah had first arrived. They had all worried about Draco, about whether someone else would darken their doorstep, because Draco had confessed the events of that night when the whiskey had finally numbed him enough that the words could actually slip from his mouth.
“And I said not gonna happen.” He crossed his arms, body going still, and Harry sensed another confrontation brewing.
“Don’t take it personally.” Draco scowled, but his criticism was mostly self directed. “As I am sure Roxi can attest, I don’t play well with others.”
“Thank you, Astoria,” Draco said when he could speak calmly again. “I have been concerned about the investigation, and it is a relief to know that it has been resolved.” His words were calm, but his heart was racing, and Draco wasn’t sure how long he would be able to keep his emotions contained. “Perhaps we should return?”
Draco reached across the counter and took Harry’s hand. His skin was still so pale and the contrast between him and Harry felt so close. “When I left, I left all those expectations that people had of me. I left behind the idea that I had to marry a woman, I don’t know that I want to get married at all really. And I left behind all those ideas my parents had about who I should spend time with and what I should do as a-a life’s pursuit, I guess. Here, now, I’m just myself.”
“He is.” Hermione smiled. “He’s resilient, and clever, and stubborn, and brave. And he spent all of Hogwarts just trying not to die. He didn’t have a chance to find out what else he could be. He didn’t know that he could be playful or that he could have his own family or that he might want to do something other than fight. He’s been fighting his whole life.”
“Was it Him? Did you dream about Him?” Draco asked, and Harry nodded. “Right.” He smoothed his hands up and down Harry’s arms, licked his lips, and took deep, shuddering breaths of his own. “Right. We’re going out.” He pushed back the tangled blankets.
“It’s a missing persons case. Sort of.” Harry put down the parchment. “Why are you here?” Maybe changing the subject back to her would distract her?
“Those don’t seem to be good odds.” Draco shrugged. “The blood work came back on Harry. How did you know about the sleeping potions?” Dean asked, trying to sound friendly. Apparently he got to be the good Auror rather than the bad..
Harry nodded and then looked at the house only he could see. It was one thing to give the address to Draco, and quite another to give it to this strange woman. He’d kept it this way to keep out reporters and other nosy people.
Tilly frowned. “I suppose if there had been some place else you could have gone, then you probably wouldn’t have gotten into this mess in the first place?”
Harry liked having dinner with Ron and Hermione almost as much as he liked having dinner with just Jude at Grimmauld Place. Ron usually cooked, and he did fantastic things with chicken that made their whole flat smell like rosemary. Ginny always laughed a lot, and even Harry felt comfortable crowded around their very small table.
Draco paused, leaned back in his chair, and looked at Harry. “Yeah. They’re clever.” He furrowed his brow almost defensively, and Harry felt his heart beat harder. “Did you know they can fly? Not like us. They have these huge machines called aeroplanes and they fill them up with something called fuel…” And he explained about airports and flight attendants and pilots while his finger clicked away on the keys.
Draco paused, soap still lathered over his hands, a muggle place. Could he really go to a muggle place?
“Harry, my boy.” Kingsley clapped him on the shoulder. “Ready for that speech?” But he wasn’t really asking and before Harry could reply moved on to say something to the new owner of Fortesque’s. Harry only felt a little bad that he couldn’t remember her name.
“You’re right!” Harry put his hands up in surrender. “You’ve given us a bigger break then we’ve had. Any chance you might look at the others? You might know them.”
And if she didn’t, then Draco certainly wasn’t going to point out all the reasons she was clearly missing. “Then, if you will excuse me, I’ll return to the lab and begin again.”
Harry stood in the hallway outside the open door listening to the voices inside the office. He could make out three, two female students and Dr. Connor, and they were discussing some theory or other that Hermione would have probably instantly known, but Harry didn't. And anyway, Harry wasn’t really listening to the words, but more the tone.
And around again. And again. And again, until Weatherby knocked on the door and asked if Master needed a late night snack or drink.
“Sarah.” He breathed, and then suddenly, everything was too fast and not fast enough as he tore across the room and yanked her close.
“It’s okay to have hopes you know. Maybe it won’t work between you and Harry, but you deserve something that makes you happy. What do you want from your life, Draco?”
And then Robards was standing in front of his desk, exchanging strange pleasantries with Val who had her hard-auror-here face on, the one she usually used when keeping the public from a crime scene. Not a good sign.
That was much harder, but Harry did remember the ‘Life’s work destroyed by bigoted anger’ part which he recited back to Roxi faithfully.
Harry should be used to the way his stomach cramped up when she talked about him missing her games. “We listened to it on the wireless. Sounds like all those extra practice sessions are paying off,” he said instead of trying to defend himself. They’d already had that fight last week when he’d first told her, and then again on Friday when she’d suggested bringing Jude straight to the stadium.
Draco couldn’t hear the other person, but he had a sudden flash to last night and had his suspicions.
Harry took two steps away to open the cupboard for a glass. Two steps too far. When he turned to face the sink, glass in his hand, he could see Draco, with a knife slicing into his left arm, blood dripping onto the floor. And he drew the knife up his arm again.
And Harry could feel her hands stroking up and down his back, slow and careful. It felt good, and he pulled back just far enough to see her. There were words he should say, but they seemed stuck in his throat. He swallowed again, and managed to choke out, “I found him.”
“Night of the full moon, we think, since we found his pelt.” Harry continued. Ajax’s face went a bit red. “But I know he went missing on Saturday last.”
One of them sipped from a cup, and suddenly, Draco knew exactly where he wanted to go. He turned at the next corner and made for the strange shop with the rows of computers, not the tiny ones that fit in hands, but the big ones that sat on tables and desks, that some muggles used for playing those awful shooting games and those strange moving pictures.
“Well,” Harry started slowly. “She’s--” He paused and thought about Ginny, about her dancing at the club in her yellow dress and standing outside at Christmas talking about Quidditch. “She’s fun. Beautiful. Athletic. But mostly, she’s just fun.” He shrugged a little.
“They hunt us down for something that was done to us! Your Aurors! They make us vulnerable, and leave us at the mercy of regular people! Who are starting to notice. What do you think will happen when the police discover that those ‘wild wolves’ are Werewolves? Every time you speak to that Auror you put us a little more at risk.” Ajax crowded in close, giving Draco nowhere to go. “It’s unacceptable.”
Neville shrugged and shoved his fork into his turkey and noodles. “Gran gets all kinds of invitations these days. I swear she’s gone more than I am. We’ve gone a whole week without seeing each other.”
It all slotted into place then. Malfoy wasn’t supposed to know about the nightmares, wasn’t supposed to sleep in the bed and wake Harry gently from them. He wasn’t supposed to press soft kisses to the back of Draco’s neck and ask about his day. His ring wasn’t supposed to be on Draco’s finger.
She closed her eyes and let out a slow breath, and for the first time Draco realized she had been trying to take the attention from him, protecting him as if he were one of her own. Draco reached out under the table and squeezed her hand tightly before facing his own barrage of questions: what were his brewing methods, the location of his laboratory, how he came to be so skilled. They asked how Draco became involved in the Werewolf population, about his bite, about his Pack.
He thought about Draco’s lips close to his ear, hot air as Draco spoke, breathless and low. “Fuck, you smell good.” And Harry spilled over his fist, his own voice breathless as he gasped out, “Fuck.”
Faye cocked her head to the side. “And if we need you, then we will call you. Many of us are magical, after all, we can apparate if needed.”
They all paused as the food was set down on the table. Malfoy didn’t waste a moment as Harry’s plate was set down, he reached out and snatched a triangle of toast, cramming it into his mouth and getting crumbs all over his face.
And right now, Harry wanted Draco. If that meant this pathetic excuse for a human in front of him had to go for Harry to get what he wanted, then he would just have to go.
Immediately upon stepping into the stark white room, Draco felt more settled. There were three cauldrons stacked on a long table, and a room of cabinets along the back wall. Feeling vaguely at home for the first time since he’d received that Owl from his mother six months ago, Draco walked up to the counter and ran his hands along the granite top.
And then Drao was twisting, popping his knee and pushing up aggressively into Harry’s space. His breath hot on Harry’s neck, and Harry grabbed Draco’s hips, lined them up and rolled against him, both of them hard and dragging against each other. Draco brought a hand up and pushed Harry back half a step, twisted back around again, and ground his ass back against Harry until Harry groaned.
“Hey,” Harry reached out and grabbed Malfoy’s elbow. “I need to stop over there.” He pointed across the hall.
Hermione said something about his eye, but Harry brushed off her attempts to heal it, and Ginny pressed up against his side. And Harry could feel the warmth of her, the press of her breast against his side, her arm around his waist along with the ache in his face and his hand and his foot. He felt warm and alive.
It felt sort of final to Harry, that encounter in the loo, the way Malfoy had stormed out, the angry way he had shoved the wand back at Harry in the main room under the auspicious gaze of the bartender. It had felt like they wouldn’t see each other again, but that hadn’t been quite true. Harry had seen him once in the Atrium, and he had started to walk over before realizing that Malfoy was being berated by a young woman. Harry hadn’t wanted to get involved in that, told himself that Malfoy deserved to be yelled at by strangers on the street, that all Death Eaters should experience that. That it had nothing to do with the Prophet reporters who were always lurking in the Atrium.
Narcissa didn’t say anything, but there was something disapproving in the lines around her mouth. “She’s been quite busy with the primary school. They have been raising funds to start a preschool program, something to help the children socialize.”
Draco licked his lips. “I’m registered now, I won’t be home anyway. And my body is still recovering from the bullet so I can’t take regular wolfsbane, it will have to be the hyssop potion.”
They pulled answers from him like teeth from gums until the words bleed out of him freely. Draco spoke of Sawyer, by name, and of Sawyer’s strangely divided Pack. How he began brewing first for the pack, and then others because it was a sign of respect. He explained that Sawyer had gone missing, his murder, and how he, Draco, became Packless. How he became involved in the investigation by Harry Potter, about his own kidnapping, and that the Packs had come en masse to his aide. Draco offered up his own memory of the event as testimony.
Harry stood, dumbfounded, in the kitchen for several minutes after Jude and Sarah wandered off still laughing at him. Because he
They were close enough to the table that Ginny, Hermione, Neville and Hannah could all hear, and Ginny immediately came to Harry’s defense. “He was just defending himself. Harry would never start a fight.”
The woman sighed, her steps faltering slightly. “Not yet. But someplace close. I wanted to do King’s Head, but it’s so full of all those stuffed heads, I’m not sure anyone will notice a wolf pelt.”
For another five minutes, Draco waited outside. He was now definitely late, but it had been worth it, to see who went inside, to speak with Florence. He pushed himself off the wall and walked through the door. The bell jingled as he stepped inside, and only one person looked up.
Roxi watched them until they were no longer visible and then picked the gold scales case because the grandson seemed potentially suspicious, and really, there were enough lunar landing hoax theories.
He had finished that painful task and begun sketching out the generator when Granger returned at noon. “Sorry,” She bustled in, “lost track of time a bit.” She inhaled and scrunched up her nose. “Is that tea tree?”
Seriously? Harry rolled his eyes. “And you thought crawling in next to me, after being pretty clear about not wanting to sleep in my bed, was the way to get a little more shut-eye?” He had meant it to be a statement wrapped up in sarcasm, but Harry couldn’t help the questioning inflection at the end.
He watched carefully from the new angle as the large group entered, stomping their feet and pulling off mittens and gloves. He stared intently and didn’t realize he’d been muttering under his breath, “Please, please.”
It was easy enough to walk across the room, to squeeze around the tables and chairs, to mutter the occasional, excuse me, as he made his way towards Draco. The whole thing went a bit to shit when Draco looked up because his eyes met Harry and then went a bit--well, soft really, as if he was grateful to see Harry standing there clutching his cup of steeping tea awkwardly
Should he move her hand where he wanted it? Jude had said to make sure she felt good first. Should Harry put his hand on her knee? Did she even want him to touch her? He was having a little trouble breathing.
“Excuse me!” Draco shouted. “But we were all almost killed by evil werewolves, and a literal mad man lived in my house, and I have an actually evil tattoo on my arm that literally cannot be removed! That letter could kill all of us! It could be cursed to explode as soon as someone opens it! It could--I don’t know! Do you know how many different curses there are?! Because I don’t, and my family has been inventing them since the 10th century!”
“Shockingly, that doesn’t make me feel any better about this.” Ron ran his hands through his hair as the consequences started to dawn on him.
or anything, but it wasn’t right was it? For a gay man to marry a straight woman? Surely Malfoy could understand that. It was utterly outrageous in fact, and completely crazy that he was even considering it!
Robards wasn’t even looking at Harry, but piercing Draco with a dark look. “I expect you to be here, no excuses, not one minute--”
With no small amount of trepidation, Draco reached out. He locked his gaze, and his focus, on his hand to keep it still, and it was only through dumb luck that he grabbed the envelope on the first try. He pulled the parchment from the envelope and carefully unfolded it so that neither Dean nor Weasley could see the ink. For surely this would be a private thing. In the bottom corner was the small square for his thumb. But when Draco touched it, light glittered across the page as the words appeared. He let go of the square and put the paper down so that no one else would be able to read the words. “I need my glasses.” Draco got out the small silver spectacles and then picked up the paper again to read.
“For months now you have done nothing but drone on about the importance of re-establishing the Malfoy name as one of honor and respectability. This is how one accomplishes that goal, by going to events, by charming people, by making the right kinds of connections. Have you any idea how far a connection with the Fawleys or the Macmillans could get you? It’d be easier if they had daughters of an age with you, but they have sons who would make excellent friends and the fathers may be able to help you find a prestigious position. Or the Greengrasses? Either Astoria or Daphne would make an excellent wife for you, and their bloodline goes back nearly as far as the Malfoy line.”
But Harry snatched his wrist before he could actually make an escape. “Wait. We haven’t been able to identify the victim.”
“No, I mean us, what are we doing, a couple of weeks every few months, some nice dates followed by months of no letters or firecalls because we’re both too busy to remember? I’m an Auror and I’ve got Teddy, I can’t be following you around like a groupie. And you’ve got your whole career ahead of you. What are we doing?” An elbow from a passerby caught Harry in the back, and he realized they were standing still in the middle of a moving crowd.
“I mean, he didn’t even have his own clothes at my place. I was always making him wear my old stuff. And, I didn’t take him out very often. There was so much we could have done, that I know he would have liked to do. Like this wedding tomorrow. I know he would have wanted to go.”
The Sales Clerk held out the ring, and both Harry and Ron took turns holding it close to their faces to peer at the tiny thing. “We’ll take it.” Ron nodded very seriously at her.
“Hand me my wand, Ginny?” He whispered, and Ginny passed it over without looking away from the game. Carefully, Harry charmed Malfoy into the bedroom, and watched him nest into the pillows and blankets.
So it was with no small amount of relief that Harry saw the new white paint in the front hall still looked new and the wallpaper was the nice green stripes that he and Jude had installed over Christmas.
“It’s not Trevor, actually.” Harry fussed with the napkin in his lap. “Different case, but I just can’t get a handle on the motivations.”
The noise and the lights and the uncomfortable bench, so unlike anything Draco knew, it took only a matter of minutes before he fell asleep, head tilted back and snoring lightly from the alcohol. Draco slept for a solid six hours, he slept through the clanging on the bars and the murmurs of other offenders. He slept through the shouting of Aurors and the flush of the communal toilet. He slept right up until another Auror shook him awake to announce that his mother had just paid his fines and he was free to go with a grimace on his face.
Harry took the file back to the office he still shared with Savage although she wasn’t there. For a moment he stared at the partially completed report waiting for him, and then decided to finish it. After all, Malfoy would be wherever he went during the day that wasn’t the Manor, and Harry would have to wait until later to go out looking for him anyway. He sat down and tucked the file in the top drawer where he wouldn’t have to look at Draco’s sullen expression or even be reminded of it.
And the longer he listened, the more Draco hoped that last one was true, because he didn’t hear Teddy’s quick steps.
“And whipped cream.” Draco’s face lit up in a sudden, wicked smile. “And we could have breakfast in bed.
So what if that flat had never been all that welcoming, it had still been better than the studio Draco kept. So what if Draco had never been able to follow Ajax, Ajax hadn’t made requests as abominable as his father. He’d put aside ideas of happiness in exchange for a life that was better than the Manor. He didn’t need love and sex and a home as long as he had a Pack, Teddy now.
“Alright.” Dr. Conners put his hands back up, the empty one over his head. “I’m going to put my cup down now, if you don’t mind.” He knelt slowly, put the cup on the floor next the the wall slowly, and then stood slowly.
“This new Ministry,” Priscilla tutted away, “they have no respect for the tradition of things. Just last week, my Princeton came home for our weekly family dinner complaining that they demanded he remove a family portrait from his office! The cheek! My ancestor Perseus Parkinson has hung in that office since he decided not to run for reelection in 1733! The insult of it!”
But Friday and Saturday came and went without a peep from Malfoy. Harry had gone out early Saturday with Ron and Neville to a wizarding pub, and Harry had spent a stupid amount of time reading over the menu and wondering what drinks Draco would have liked to try. They had about eight different whiskeys, and Harry ended up tasting six of them before Neville and Ron decided to call it a night.
And for a moment, Harry considered it, imagined pulling his arm back and letting it fly with painful precision. Several times. Even in his imagination, it was exhausting. And besides, the food would be ready soon. “I guess that makes you an enigma wrapped in a mystery coated in sarcasm and asine rules.”
“Merlin! You were there!” Harry shouted, and people in the tube station stopped to stare at him. “You were there that night! I knew you were there!”
“I don’t know.” Harry shuffled out the door. “Calm down Tilly, I’m going find out what’s going on. Just give me a minute.” He put the mobile down on the coffee table, but didn’t ring off.
Val led the way to Wheatley Street to a beautiful brick maisonette, and then rang the bell for an Ingrid Gladstone. She answered the buzz with an aggrieved,”What?”
Malfoy rolled off his lap. “Sometimes I hate you. Sometimes I don’t.” He curled up onto his knees, in the fetal position. “Please take me to bed.”
Jude leaned into Draco just enough to feel some of the warmth of him. “I’d forgotten what it was like, to feel that afraid.”
“If she was reported missing, you’ll be able to find a record. She was ten, when she was bit, never went to Hogwarts, never got a wand, but she had magic.” And Malfoy carefully folded her up and placed her next to the first. His hands trailed along the tote slowly.
“Good. You’ll be receiving the standard 3% raise, and we will meet again next month to discuss your progress with communication. That’s all.”
Draco was saved from further conversation on politics by the announcement of dinner. He finished his gimlet and offered Astoria his arm. The dinner conversation remained on safe topics, favorite meals, summertime traditions, Americans in general. Astoria laughed at all the right moments when Draco shared stories of Roxi’s sisters. He was charmingly engaging when Marcella talked about the school. And then, just before the dessert, Astoria asked if he might like a tour of the house.
The Aurors threw Draco and Jude into a holding cell while the effects of the stunners wore off, but then quickly separated them into different interrogation rooms when they began to rouse. They handcuffed him to the metal table, which should have felt incredibly insulting, but Draco’s head still felt muzzy, throbbing dully at the back, and he couldn’t quite muster the energy to be upset.
“Oh, isn’t it that Swedish girl?” Harry fell back into the conversation. Maybe he’d go for a long run this evening, before bed. Wear himself down hard so that maybe he wouldn’t spend the night staring at the ceiling and then pretending to sleep when Ginny woke at 5am for practice.
Harry spent a long time looking over the pastries, deciding which ones he would like best, wondering which ones Malfoy would like best, and then deciding, if Harry were to buy some for Malfoy, which he would buy. And while common sense would dictate that Harry ought to buy the ones he thought Malfoy would like, reality said Harry would buy the ones with the most calories.
“I will be studying for my NEWTS and looking for a Ministry job,” Draco replied smoothly. He was so very tired of this conversation. Last week had been the Notts, and the week before that the Greengrass's, and Draco found it harder and harder every week to drag himself to the table for these meals and repeat the same pathetic lines as if he were some side character in a play.
“I will,” he growled back and pushed against Malfoy who didn’t budge. “I will solve this case, in spite of you and Atkinson,” He shoved again. “And I will make sure that everyone knows what you’ve done!”
Another Auror pair, Terry Boot and someone from R and D that Harry didn’t recognize began scanning for magical residue. They had a few very interesting devices that had just been approved for use, but the scanner had been around for ages. Terry gave it a whack and pointed it up towards the pelt. He shook his head at the R and D bloke.
It had gotten chipped the first time Harry had ever spent the night at Draco’s flat. They’d had a huge row, Harry in the middle of the street, Draco leaning out his window, each shouting at the other in the middle of the night until that older woman had stuck her head out and complained that they ought to just shag and get it out of their systems. Harry had gone up to the flat and Draco had ranted about how he was too loud, always sharing his business with every stranger who walked down the street. And Harry had pinned him against the kitchen island and whispered in a husky voice that maybe they
But when Ginny stepped out and waved at the crowd, people started screaming her name. She smiled and waved a little bigger and Harry watched as she laughed at something one of her teammates said.
Malfoy’s voice was soft, considered, as he started on the tale. “In the land that is now Rome, two brothers were raised in the wild. They were twins, the same age, and spent their days running wild as their father was dead and their mother too busy with the running of the farm to worry about them. They spent their days hunting for wild figs and cherries to gorge upon.”
It was Mr. Greengrass who commented on it though. “I hope we are not boring you with talk of the biggest summer event.”
Harry physically shuddered. “Oh, I think that’s us.” Not too much farther ahead, at the very front was a stretch of eight empty seats. He quickly pushed through the remaining spectators and fell into the seat on the far end, Ron right next to him. “When are the others arriving?”
For the moment, Hermione stood back and looked through the room. Andromeda was trying to convince Teddy that he did not need to eat any more of the sandwiches, but that he might enjoy some of the carrots. Teddy was eyeing the cheese tray instead. Faye and Florence were laughing in a corner while Ajax scowled, probably trying to look fierce but utterly failing with the way he kept glancing at Florence with wide eyes.
Had that been what happened last night? Draco finally made it to the bottom of his shirt and he looked up at her. She’d propped her chin in her hand and was looking expectantly at him, so Draco said, “Oh. Why is it called the walk of shame?”
There was another chorus of approval, but Ajax stared at Harry. “We can’t just leave him out. He’s Draco’s Pack.”
And Draco bit his lip. It was a terrible idea, he should say no. Him and Harry, in a club, with loud music and rocking bodies. “Sounds fun.”
Draco turned his face in towards the back of the sofa to hide. He hadn’t known to be wary of that feeling until it was too late with Sawyer, until they were already Pack. And now Potter had unwittingly done that to Teddy.
Harry finished his eggs and looked up, Malfoy was looking at his plate. “I’ve got to shower, but there’s eggs on the counter if you want to make your own.” Harry nodded at the package. He stood stretched up, and then locked eyes with Malfoy again.
Together they stumbled towards the door, Draco chucking the wand away at the last minute. Outside, they ran, not bothering to look back to see if anyone gave chase. Another set of footsteps fell in step with Draco and Tilly, and the spell started to trickle off of them. They were blocks from the building now, close to a tube station. And Tilly pulled Draco down the steps, Evan just behind them.
“I had a-well, the nice way to say it is a sheltered childhood. Grew up in a rural town in Ohio, went to church every Sunday, did well in school, I had a promise ring.” She pushed her food around absently. “I was the good child, and my older brother was the rebel.”
St. Mungo’s ran about a thousand tests, and Robard’s himself came in to take everyone’s statements. “What a mess, a right cock-up this one.” He just kept repeating. The French are going to be pissed.”
“We are here for consensus, not infighting.” An older man said from somewhere in the middle of the table. He was dressed in shabby clothes with shaggy hair and nails that needed to be clipped. He looked at Harry. “To be clear, we have come at your bidding, to assist you with your Pack, and we have some expectations of your behavior, Auror.”
“Fuck,” Val replied. She stood up, and Harry followed suit. “Well, thanks, Ingrid, it’s been very helpful.”
Draco turned to see a woman dressed in maroon robes with that Auror badge pinned over her chest. He couldn’t quite drag his eyes up higher than that--bile rising in his throat again.
Tilly pulled up the sleeve, the button for his cuff now long lost, and gasped. She ran one finger down the entire length of the Dark Mark while tears leaked out of Draco’s eyes. “Shit.”
They were half way around the pond, weaving carefully through a group of trees when something moving fast rammed into Draco from behind. Draco had just enough time to catch sight of a wild tangle of red curls, before he was pitched over the front of his broom. She was close enough that Draco was able to reach out, tuck her in close and hit the ground first, mostly with his shoulder.
“Yeah,” Jude kept looking at him, at the circles under his eyes, the tired slope of his shoulders--he smelled too. Jude tried not to wrinkle his nose. “It’ll take time.”
“Isn’t that your prerogative?” Was Atkinson going to be an enormous pain in the arse for the entire case?
It felt slow, like Harry was molten hot and everything else was icy cold and he had to cut through the air just to take a step. It felt like he couldn’t move fast enough, like he wouldn’t get there in time. But then, in the blink of an eye, he shoved Malfoy (hands hitting against a hard chest) and shouting, the fire burning through him.
“I brought wolfsbane. Have you seen Draco?” The two sentences ran together, and Ajax froze for a moment. And then the door shut for a second time.
Ron groaned a little. “Hermione has made a spreadsheet to keep track of everything. And she’s getting very--I don’t know, mate.” He sighed. “She’s not sleeping well, and I think I made a mistake asking her to marry me.”
Disturbed only when Vale popped up before anyone else and growled in a particularly angry tone, “There were two!”
Draco swished his tail as if to say “fuck you” and leapt up on the bed. He turned three circles and then curled up in the same place he had been sitting when Harry arrived.
Early could be good! Maybe then he could beg off at ten, the less time he spent there close to closing, the less chance of running into Malfoy. He quickly dumped the roasting pan in the bubbly sink. “That’s a great idea, Gin. Let’s go now.”
Harry tried to fight down a roll of nausea at the sight. “Scan it quick so we can get it out of here.”
“They were poisoned,” Harry said. “It’s not being treated as such because they aren’t recognized as a Pack, but that’s what happened. Kathleen was killed and then her Pack poisoned by wolfsbane.”
What was she saying? Was she actually saying Draco was a danger? “He took his wolfsbane, he is perfectly safe!”
It took five minutes for him to climb back into the booth. “God, I needed that. I haven’t laughed like that in so long.” He wiped tears from his eyes. “Oh, jesus. What were we talking about?”
“Yes.” Draco swallowed the lump in his throat. “Perhaps we should step over there.” He nodded towards a stall. “So I can give it to you?”
Draco nodded. “I will bring some brooms. I am not very familiar with any of the parks in the area, perhaps you could make a suggestion.”
“I have heard some rumors about our population as well,” Faye said. “There are many things you do not understand about Werewolves. That is why I have come.” She gestured to the dead body again. “We will no longer tolerate your claim to us if you will not treat us as equal. We wish to live in peace either as muggles or as magical, most of us do not care. But we will no longer allow you to treat us as mere dogs to come and go at your beck and call.”
For a moment they both just stood there in the aisle: Malfoy watching Harry, Harry trying to ignore the prickling on the back of his neck.
Draco rummaged through the cabinet for the sour mix and then through the fridge for cold sparkling water or ice or something else to tone down the flavor.
And then they were inside the flat, and Malfoy was nibbling his way across Harry’s jaw, and Harry’s knees were giving out just a little bit as he licked the corner of Harry’s mouth.
“What?” the word was punched out of Harry. He’d known that Draco would be upset after Friday, known they’d crossed a line, but he hadn’t thought it had been a
It was comforting in the loo, Harry realized, the heavy door cut off the noise of the dining room, and it was lit a little brighter, not so shadowy in the corners. And, most importantly, there were lots of doors to duck behind so he didn’t have to see anyone as he tried somewhat desperately to remember how to breathe.
“Can’t imagine working with my family,” Ginny replied. “God, can you imagine all of us at Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes? I’d have to be committed for matricide.”
They had already watched every episode of The Flying Circus, eaten about eight pints of ice cream, Tilly had tried to convince Draco to go out two nights ago. He’d just looked at her morosely and hidden in the bathroom with his phone for an hour. With a sigh, Tilly got out her mobile and rang Evan. “Can you come over?”
Draco shrugged. “If it looks like it came from an animal, you should probably tell someone.” And they all went back to the grueling task of searching.
“I do not.” She frowned a bit. “I spend most of my time assisting Mother with her charities and visiting with friends.”
“Absolutely not!” Lucius smacked his cane on the floor. “Draco is going to his home, where he can be properly protected from this sort of nonsense.”
In the end, Harry bought a large tea and a breakfast sandwich because he was hungry. Atkinson, he noticed, had coffee. While waiting for the sandwich, Harry struck up a conversation with the barista and sipped on his delightfully hot tea.
“I might be able to find out where she was,” Draco insisted. “I can’t promise; Neil’s a prick and might not tell me anything just because I want to know.” He grabbed his mobile and started scrolling for Neil’s number.
At least the parlour was done, and the kitchen, and most of the dining room now. They could start those meetings right away, even if there wasn’t a place for people to sleep yet. He’d do the downstairs loo first.
Harry wasn’t entirely sure what he was talking about, but he seemed to be in a confiding mood. “Yeah, it’s very flattering when they come up to me on the street, asking for my autograph.” This was not a thing that happened anymore, mostly because Harry avoided wizarding London. He wandered over to the bookshelves. “You’ve got quite a collection here. I’ve a friend who would be quite jealous. Is this a first printing of Magic in the Beginning?”
Well! Harry certainly wasn’t going to apologize for being short! “I just wanted to know what you heard and saw.”
He stepped into a large crowd and tried to lose Harry in it, but Harry kept up because that was just the day Draco was having. Harry grabbed him again, pulling him to a stop in the middle of all the people. “I was looking for you.”
when the stranger next to him stumbled over his own two feet. Automatically, Draco reached out a steadying hand, and the stranger smiled as he regained his footing.
It felt strange, as if Draco were both present and gone from his life at the same time. As if Harry, in finally trying to make a place for Draco in his life, was coming to the realization that he, Harry, had a life to live. The war had been hard, and, slowly, bit by bit, he’d fallen into lazy habits. He went to work, ate takeaway, and watched telly in a Muggle flat. It had taken an old enemy-turned-something-else to pull Harry back into the world.
“Mr. Potter, I can see quite clearly that you have case files to be reviewed. Mr. Robards is quite busy at the moment.” She held out her hand to take them.
For Harry, it's a whole different kind of low, the kind of low that drives him to drink until he can't remember, to push painful memories away--expect in those middle of the night moments when reality is worse.
“I demand to speak with Robards!” Harry shouted from the hallway. “I’ll take this all the way to Kingsley!” And the door shut, cutting off the noise abruptly.
He lost the fight and sulked his way to the other end of the department for the forty-five minutes it took to hunt down the file because some moron had filed it under Phiz instead of Waters-Phiz like any sensible person would. As a result, by the time Harry returned to Savage’s office, Malfoy and his mother had both arrived and left and everyone still in the office was talking about the death.
“Oh Christ, did I come while they were talking to you? Are you trying to order while you’re hard and confused? Please tell me you're hard and confused.”
“We don’t believe you. People don’t just share dreams. Hermione’s got several Unspeakables researching it. There isn’t a trace of evidence to support your story”
They got off and then took a cab to her parent’s rowhouse. It was the last one in the line, all pretty stone facades with beautifully maintained front gardens. Tilly squared her shoulders as they got out of the cab, and Draco touched her hand. “It’s going to be fine. I’m here, and we can leave any time.”
And Malfoy shoved him away. “The fuck is wrong with you Potter? Huh? I’m not fucking going in there!”
Roxi knocked loudly on the door, and then stuck her head in the room without waiting for a reply. Jenkins was in the middle of talking to a Junior Auror. “Can I help you?” She raised her eyebrows annoyed.
Neil stepped forward. “I know you, Draco. And yeah, you’re the good, sweet, sheltered boy living life in the big city. But deep down,” he poked Draco in the chest, over his heart. “Deep down in here, you’re a little bit wicked too.”
“No. You were having a nightmare and you just woke up confused.” Harry propped himself up on his elbows to look Draco in the eye. “You shouldn’t have left.”
When Jude went into work at the bar, Sarah went with him. And sometimes Hermione stopped by the house with take-away, usually around lunch time. She’d spend half an hour leaning against the kitchen counter and chatting with Harry while Sarah and Jude devoured noodles or curry or those enormous meat pasties. Afterwards, Hermione would disappear with Sarah, and both Harry and Jude would watch with varying degrees of anxiety.
“What materials are you missing? If you need something sooner, you need only tell me.” Hermione insisted.
“Zey will ruin it.” He muttered just loud enough for Draco to hear. “Américains stupides. Ce sont des ingrédients délicats. ils les ruineront…” He was practically growling the r’s.
Except for the containment field at the other end which was filthy. There was a table and single chair not completely covered in horribleness, but Harry wasn’t sure the bed could ever be cleaned. And then it dawned on Harry, that Draco was confined inside the containment field.
Evan gave the shaker a good shake and poured out four drinks, each one with their smoke lined glass.
And Draco huffed and sneered, “Yeah? You think? And who’s the one who called me family. I didn’t do that. I wouldn’t do that. You did.”
Draco kicked at the floor. “It isn’t what you said, it’s that you think it’s true. Most people don’t.”
Harry let out a breath he hadn’t realized he’d been holding as Ron clapped his shoulder. “It’s alright, mate. Not everyone is expecting you to pop the question at any moment.”
And then he looked at the man sleeping in the bed next to him. He and Luc had been on again-off again for years now, and they had only recently started up again. While the sex was pleasant, Draco wasn’t sure if he was more than mildly interested.
Narcissa wasn’t looking at Draco, but at their reflection in the mirror. And Draco realized when he looked up, that perhaps she was saying rather a lot of things in those awkward pauses. He reached across the table and put his hand over hers. “They’re good people. And they’ve been there for me when no one else was.”
Could they smell that on him? God, that had been yesterday morning, and Harry had showered! He nodded anyway.
When he looked back at the table, Draco was smiling at the waitress and handing her a pile of notes. Then he stood up, looked at Harry, and then began to slowly walk over with his hands in his pockets. He looked as non threatening as Harry had ever seen him, and he had a sudden image of Draco shifted and curled around sleeping Rosie, how careful he had been, how concerned about her safety. The wizarding world was doing the entire Werewolf population a disservice.
There was a trick to pouring the liquid, to mixing slow but steady, to getting the balls to release from their molds. It was messy and took concentration, and both Draco and Jude were grateful for the escape.
“No. I don’t know how to help him.” That’s what he thought he been doing, in talking to Draco, in taking him to the kitchen, but that hadn’t helped at all. It had made things worse. Bad things had happened to Draco, things that maybe couldn’t be fixed. “I don’t know if he can be helped.”
Harry watched the steam rise swirling from his own cup as it drifted up and faded into the air. “What?” He finally met her gaze.
“I can speak for no Pack but my own.” Faye stared at Williams unblinkingly. “And I have come here, to this place where I am so distinctly unwelcome for everything that I am, to assist you in your goal of ruling over a peaceful city. I cannot speak for other Alphas, but I can tell you that we are angry, that the recent events, the murders of my brothers and sisters have made it clear to all of us how little
Harry tried not to frown, he really did. “Fine. Not much new in the world of cold cases.” Although, there were three new files on his desk he should be going through. “What about the Wizengamot? Did you get your clause into that bill?”
With practised ease, he slipped from underneath the blankets and walked over to his desk. The top drawer had a secret latch where he kept his journal. Still naked, Draco sat down to write the dream, just as he had since that very first night.
Narcissa Malfoy swept elegantly into the interrogation room and then sat primly on her seat across from Harry. Her hair was going white but in that graceful way that made her look ageless and beautiful. She had lines around her face that hadn’t been there the last time Harry had seen her.
If Malfoy had been assisting the Department of Mysteries, why hadn’t he contacted any of his friends? Seriously, not once in five years? If Harry had done something like that to Ron or Hermione, they would have been storming the Ministry after only a few days. And why would Malfoy choose not to contact them? That wasn’t part of his probation. He tucked the list into his pocket, and turned back to Atkinson. Other interviews seemed pointless, but maybe there was something to be gained by seeing Malfoy’s flat. “Where was
She was drowned out by Teddy shouting, “Someone’s here! Someone’s here!” And then he dashed out of the kitchen and down the hall where he met the full gaze of Faye. “Ooh,” He said coming to a complete stand still.
Malfoy had stopped trying to get away. He turned around, pressed his face into Harry and hissed, “Yeah, great idea. Why don’t I just go in there, huh? What do you think all these people here are going to think if I go in there?”
The noise jerked Malfoy’s attention away from Harry’s cock and to the reason they were there. He quickly yanked at his own trousers, fumbling to get them off, to turn and bend over the side of the bed so that Harry could work a slick finger inside of him. And Harry did. Inside, Malfoy was an inferno, so hot and tight, and Harry could barely move his finger, barely understood what he should do now. But he was definitely not going to fit unless Malfoy relaxed.
Definitely a muggle then. “We’ve found some remains over the last few months. I was hoping you would take a look and let me know if you recognize any of them.”
“Jude and Robards practically came to blows. Sarah insists she can handle undercover work, and she’s not even sixteen yet!” she called from the bedroom. “The only thing we could all agree on was keeping Harry out of it.”
“I would have to examine the damage again, but a minimum of 7 days.” And that was seven working days, excluding any days he would not be able to work. “Am I to assume then that the project will proceed?”
“Oh my god,” Sophie leaned in close. “It was a nightmare. He’d just broken up with this block and was moping everywhere. Tilly and I couldn’t do a thing with him. So, Tilly rings up Evan, and I guess he tells Evan all about this drink he had one night, and Evan convinces him they need to recreate it. It was nothing but weeks of tasting whiskeys, I thought Tilly was going to give up drinking altogether.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “It’s a simple choice, either, you go out and get you some, or you get your rocks off every morning rubbing up against me.” He paused. “Or, I sleep on the sofa. That’s worked out well so far.”
They both looked up at the oddly bright patch of wall that had so recently housed the painting. “I was tired of her shouting at me.”
Harry gave her a grimace for a smile anyway, and she clapped a hand on his shoulder. “Come on, Potter, we’ll catch them. Nothing stands in your way.”
And there was this moment, just like in the bar, where Draco just sort of flashed forward to what it might be like, dressed in Evan’s hoodie, with dark hair, his headphones blasting out The Score as he waited in line. People wouldn’t recognize him like that, not all muggle, and it wouldn’t violate any of Gringotts security measures. It wasn’t a glamour that could dissipate with a wave of a wand.
Ginny picked up take away for dinner, and Harry thought about how nice it would be at Grimmauld Place when he could cook dinner most nights. She chatted about the new training regimen, and how she was going to get arms like a beater while Harry thought about firecalling Molly and Arthur after the meal. And then, Harry wondered if perhaps he should take down some of the spells, make it easier to get something like a telly for the evenings? Sarah would probably like that, since she’d been living muggle for so long. And there must be others who would like it too. Maybe he ought to make the house more halfway, halfway between Magical and Muggle.
Hermione glanced between the two of them, and Harry saw Draco spine go ridgid as if he were being judged. “It is a very complicated process. I feel like I don’t know very much about the particulars of the project even though we’ve been planning it for several months now.”
He was storming over even before making a conscious decision, and he wrapped a hand around Draco’s bicep, burning like a furnace. (And smooth, and it was Draco’s skin, and Draco’s arm, said a small part of Harry’s brain set on repeat.) He pulled and Draco stumbled, and his bloke friend locked an arm around Draco’s waist defensively. (Draco’s waist, Draco’s waist.)
It worked rather well until Neville and Hannah showed up, and Ginny grabbed the one free chair to stick at the end of the table. Harry helped her pull it over, as Ginny told Hannah and Neville to take their seats because she wanted to get the next round anyway. Obviously Ginny had done it on purpose so that she could sit on Harry’s lap--leaving early still very much on her mind. Harry’s stomach rolled as he sat and waited for her to return with the next round.
But Harry jerked away from her. He couldn’t be here, not a moment longer. He was angry and drunk, and he loved each and every one of these people to death, death being the important word right now. “I’m going.” And then he was out the door, and storming down the pavement.
Hermione clasped her hands together on her lap. “I want to help you. I want to help you be safe from Greyback and together with Jude. I want to make that happen for you.”
And if Draco waited for Harry to come into the bar, who knew what he might interrupt, who knew what kind of scene he might cause. Outside, in the alley, Draco might have more control over the situation. Maybe.
“And the ones hunting us.” Faye spoke up. She’d taken the seat opposite Harry, at the foot of the table. “It’s time that we start showing the world just what we are capable of.”
“Guess we’d better,” Val repeated. She offered her arm, and reluctantly, Harry took it. A loud crack later, and they arrived at their usual apparition point.
Harry ran a hand across his back in an attempt to soothe him which was not entirely unsuccessful, and then he turned back to face Hermione and Ron in the doorway. They were both panting, and Ron was pointing his wand at Draco while Hermione half ran, half stumbled into the room.
“Sure.” Jude gathered up the take away and the plasticware while Harry got the drinks, and then they settled into the front parlour.
“You don’t have to!” Hermione said quickly, hand on his knee, trying to comfort. “You quit, you don’t have to do it. You can do whatever you want.”
“Fuck you.” Draco jerked his gaze away, into the alley, then ran his hands through his hair. Harry licked his lips at the sight of Draco disheveled and uncertain. And his breath came in short, shallow bursts that spoke of fights long past, of spilled drinks, and insistent hands. And then, very quietly, Draco said, “Fuck me.”
Draco stood up, didn’t bother with his own trousers which were somewhere on the stairs anyway. “The fuck is wrong with you?” He was supposed to shout too, but these words were just as soft, full of concern rather than vitriol. He walked around the bed, but didn’t reach out to touch Harry, looked at the slope of Harry’s shoulders, at his relaxed hands, at the way he stared out the window instead of glaring at Draco.
Draco gestured towards the books. “You’ve clearly read what you could of them. You know what happened.”
“Maybe he’s changed?” Harry suggested, thinking about aeroplanes and the moon and how Draco had called them clever.
She had the shopping in the kitchen and was putting away the dry goods into the various cupboards. Milk, eggs, and the truly expensive amounts of meat that Draco and Teddy consumed were still sitting out on the table. “Good morning, Aunt.”
Draco wanted to listen to Harry, he wanted to not take up with Luc. But Harry wasn’t here, he was in England waking up next to his wife to the sounds of their three children. He was getting dressed or perhaps his own morning relaxation. And Draco wanted that. He wanted to be the one tempting Harry to stay in bed, to be late to work, and so he let Luc pull him back to the bed. Just as he had let Luc kiss him against the bedroom wall last night and just as he would let Luc do it again the next time he asked.
“Wait here.” Harry ducked back in the room, and Draco could hear him say, “I’m taking Malfoy back to the lab. I’ll figure out what happened.” And then he was back at Draco’s side, and they were both walking as fast as possible without actually running to the apparition point.
Harry stared up at the windows and tried to decide where else Draco might go. His office was still a possibility, but he’d never stayed the weekend there before. He couldn’t have gone to his old flat; Harry had bribed the landlord into letting Draco’s lease lapse without telling him and then paid another couple’s deposit to move in. He wouldn’t go back to the Manor for anything longer than lunch with his mother.
Harry gave her a smile. With Teddy as his only real experience with children, Harry couldn’t say if this behavior was typical or not. He could say, however, that he loved the enthusiasm with which Teddy tackled everything. The way he could remain so still, crouched on the patio and watching ants file by, the way he ran to the broomshed and then squealed around the yard with one broom in hand so excited and not even in the air yet, the way he would lay in Harry’s arms, pointing at all the pictures in the books, talking excitedly until all of a sudden he was asleep and the story not finished yet. “Well, I hear they grow quite fast.”
And Draco shoved a hand between them, tore at buttons and zips and shitty, stupid elastic until he could get a hand around the two of them together. “Fuck you, Potter.” He breathed at the first scrape of their cocks against each other.
And he was fully awake and spent and realized that Malfoy was still in his arms, and they were both panting, and Harry was sticky.
And if that wasn’t a cold shower for Harry’s good mood, nothing was. His mouth straightened into a thin line. “Not exactly. He’s here for business.”
“Absolutely!” Draco said in all earnestness. “And if I were, you know, looking to be in that-that sort of relationship, she would be my first choice.”
“No!” Harry shouted at her. “She deserves to be protected! She deserves a home and people who will take care of her!” And then he turned away from her to stare angrily at the door.
For a long moment Draco didn’t move, held himself rigid, but he didn’t push away. And Harry waited. He waited for the moment that Draco relaxed against him and gave in. “I’ll stay with you the whole time. It won’t be bad. It’ll be loud, and everyone will want to meet you, but there will be the kids and they’re plenty distracting. The attention won’t be on you for long.” Harry brushed his nose into the short hairs at the base of Malfoy’s neck.
Draco sighed up at the clouds, finger pulling at the tear in his pocket. “It’s like this right, we can smell it on someone, like pheromones or something, a compatibility or a-an awareness. And you can sorta reach out and accept it, or reject it.” Draco looked down and scuffed his trainer along the pavement. “He didn’t know he was doing it, when you called me family. And I--god, I couldn’t reject a little boy, not when he wouldn’t understand. It’s-it’s awful, to be rejected like that.”
And then Harry saw that while Teddy was a constant whirl of motion, grabbing books out of Harry’s hands and hurling them across the floor, kicking his legs up in the air, flinging his hands about and smacking everyone in the face, Malfoy only got more and more still.
Draco turned back to the yard. Teddy was rolling through the grass now, rubbing dirt into his clothes and waving his arms and legs in the air. “He is. He’s just a Were too.”
They didn’t stay any longer at the Port. Draco locked up all the doors, and then the four of them went back to his place. Tilly was dozing on the sofa and woke up when Draco unlocked the door.
When Malfoy returned, he was dressed in trousers and the button down from yesterday that Andromeda had washed earlier. The top two buttons were undone and he was still barefoot, and Harry liked it, the casual elegance of it. He looked approachable and slightly mussed.
“I’ve seen you look at him, you know.” She picked up a pot and set it in the sink to fill with water.
“Couldn’t leave you here,” Harry said quietly, gasping for air. “Had to fulfill my vow.” The cup broke, and Harry trailed his fingers through the liquid
“Please. I prefer my men not half starved and crazy. And I prefer my crazy houseguests to wear clean clothes. Next time just find something in my closet to wear and put the dirty clothes in the hamper.” He didn’t look at Malfoy, but the silence emanating from Malfoy was palpable.
Harry started to say something back, something like how can a wizard be afraid of fire, but Tilly tapped Draco on the shoulder and Harry didn’t want to say something in case she didn’t know. “Can I talk to you, Dray?” She raised her eyebrows and stared something at him, something that Harry correctly interrupted as dislike for Harry.
Back at his desk, Harry flipped open the file of probation reports. There were five years of records in here, surely there was something, some hint, some clue hidden in five years worth of reports. He read through them, trying not to think, but to just absorb the information, let it fill his mind and put the pieces together without active thought.
Malfoy stepped away from him, closer to the door and wrapped his arms around himself again. “You should see me shifted.” And then he disappeared out the door, and Harry heard the first step creak as he went upstairs, probably for a shirt.
“I know.” Harry replied, and oddly enough, it didn’t bother him at all to be in this place where people didn’t like him. They didn’t know him. They didn’t know that his parents died, that there had been this devastating prophecy, that Harry had been destined to save the world. Here, they expected Harry to be obnoxious and sort of terrible. And even though Harry didn’t think he was obnoxious or terrible at all, it was a nice change.
She stamped on his foot, hard, halfway through the space. “If you ever call me delicate again, I will personally ensure that you never procreate again. And I will do it with my teeth!” She hissed angrily.
Draco’s eyes darted up to him, and Harry realized Draco had been avoiding his gaze the whole meal. He reached forward and picked up his own, still mostly full plate. “No.” The chair scrapped angrily across the floor as he stood, at least, Harry thought it sounded angry. “Please excuse me.”
Malfoy was crying, silent tears carving clean streaks on his dirty face while his shoulders shook. This was not the same Malfoy who, five years ago, had  stood boldly before the Wizengamot, whom Harry had called for leniency for, who had stood for hours while they debated his fate in his perfectly pressed and tailored robes. “What happened to you?”
“Ginny came with her hair dyed purple, thought Mum’s head would explode. And then Ginny pointed out Charlie’s been dying his hair for years, and he had an earring, and the fight sort of escalated from there.”
The rumble of the train grew until it whistled piercingly (causing a twinge of pain deep in the bowels of Harry’s head) and it arrived. By this point, Harry wanted nothing more than to collect Jude and return to Grimmauld Place for takeaway and ice cream, mint chocolate chip purchased just for the occasion.
Draco shifted in his seat just once. “Illinois is not a secret, but I would appreciate it if you kept the other information to yourself. Nothing’s been decided, and I’d rather keep my personal life private for as long as I can.” He pulled an envelope out of his pocket. “This is from Roxi.”
But Draco shook his head ignoring the strange way this brother spoke in favor of his prey; the Man-Prey needed to die.
Inside, the air felt heavy, smothering, and there were about a thousand bodies packed in tightly all the way from the bar to the door. As Harry pushed his way through the sweaty throng, he saw Neville dancing with Luna underneath a spotlight. She shimmied back and forth while Neville sweated profusely trying to keep up. He found Ron and Hermione sharing a beer at a table near the bar where Dean and Seamus chatted with the bartender.
It was still early, barely past midnight, and Sawyer was lurking in the tube station when Draco arrived breathless and giddy. “What happened?” Sawyer asked, eyes darting around in case someone had followed Draco.
Malfoy narrowed his eyes in what could have been irritation or merely consideration. It was hard to tell when his face betrayed so little emotion. “Uni, Potter, where else.” He shook his head. “Can you take me to Granger’s office or not?”
