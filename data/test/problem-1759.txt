Ron would forever be ashamed of what he did next.
Draco closed his eyes on it all.
The person who had always been a threat to the life he lived had become the only one who could make him feel safe.
'No!  Ron, no.  I...I...'  Harry stuttered.  'I didn't mean...'
But Harry would always make it better, nothing was as bad when Harry was there.
He had told them, told them all that he couldn't go back, didn't dare close his eyes.  But they made him.  He drank when he wanted to scream.  He swallowed the tainted water because Harry asked him to.
'No.  I suppose not.'  Changing the pillowcases, Harry placed them neatly at the head of the little bed.  'He hit me in the face, broke my glasses.  I had a black eye for weeks.  He was a big man, strong.'
'But...'
'Is that true?'  Seamus raised his eyebrows.
'You...'  Nott stuttered, and for once, in all of the mess the Malfoy boy had caused, Nott had to wonder at the reasons why.  He felt the shame his own words had brought, he felt the pain shining in Draco's eyes.  'Tell me, Malfoy...'  Nott hissed, low and heavy in the cramped cupboard.  Finally wanting, needing to understand.  'Tell me why you did what you did.  Tell me why your own family cannot stand to be with you, why Snape had to die, and why you did not stay and fight.  Tell me why you have turned your back on your friends and family.  Your entire life.'
'N...nothing's wrong.'  Draco shook his head, denial was all he had left.  'It's not.'
Each and every last one of them saw the Dark Lord.
The unmitigating, relentless pain of being held under Cruciatus, that spell turning his stomach to liquid fire, expelling his bowels humiliatingly onto the already filthy floor.  The unending laughter, the disgust, the stench of being left, unclean, thirsty, starving.
'Not all the time.'  Draco stared into his bowl, his stomach turning over at the though of spooning the mixture into his mouth.  'Do they not realise that you are never there?'
It was never in doubt, not for Harry.  The moment the words had spilled from his lips, he knew without question, without thought, that he spoke the truth.
'Yes, this will be done also.'  She dipped her eyes, swinging slowly open when the headmistress respected the ancient rules and spoke the password.
'Draco, I'm so sorry.'  Harry dropped to his knees where he had left the blond boy, tugging on the hem of the robe.  'Are you okay?'  He asked before that familiar face came into view.
And the lonely blond boy.  Dismissed, forgotten.  Hidden behind the castle walls.  The one who had unknowingly broke his heart.
'I...I am...'  His eyes, wet and huge looking up at Harry.  'Please.  Don't.'
But the tables had been pushed to the edges of the hall, a small scattering of chairs.  There was music coming from somewhere undiscovered.  Several of the younger students had already picked an area to dance in, and were doing so with unbridled glee.  Seamus was making himself known among the year eights, a bottle of Firewhisky smuggled under his jumper.  Pouring liberal splashes into glasses whenever one was raised.
'I have a visitor for you, Draco.'  Madam Pomfrey put her head around the door.  A smile gracing her lips.  'It appears that he cannot keep away.'
Harry reached out, his fingers finding Draco's listless hands lying on top of the thick blankets.  Fingertips ghosting over trembling skin, bruised, cut, aching.  Draco taking comfort from the gentle touch.
'He saved my life.  I owe it to him to go into his home again.  It's the least I can do.'  Draco sighed his relief at finally being touched, his hand tightening around Harry's.
The woman came over, and Draco immediately recoiled.  The place might be different, but why should the people?
She had been there, the day Dumbledore had laid the defenseless orphan baby on the doorstep of a family who would treat him with nothing but fear and contempt.  She remembered it only too clearly.  How she had stood aside and allowed it to happen with barely a word.
Taking her into the small kitchen that was hers alone, McGonagall set out two china cups and poured them both tea.  'I would opt for something stronger, but I fear that the time of day prevents this.'
'It's a long story.'  Harry shrugged.  'I'll tell it to you one day, if you'd like?'  Pleased when Draco nodded.  'She also gave me some old books.  They were a right state, my cousin had almost destroyed them.  Pages missing, scribbled all over, the covers torn off.  Anyway, she gave them to me.  I loved those books.'  Harry said wistfully.  'I couldn't get enough of them.  Read them all cover to cover so many times that they all but fell apart in my hands.  They...they became like my friends.'  Harry blushed, surprised at himself for telling Draco something he had never spoken about to anyone before.  'I didn't have any friends when I was little, but I had them.'  He reached out and picked up the book on the top of the pile.  'When I came home for the Christmas holidays in my third year, the books were gone.'
A cut above his eye, blood running down his face.
Harry didn't try to stop the note of frustration from creeping into his voice.  Hadn't they had this conversation before?  When would Draco finally listen to all he said?  'Why not?  I'm not going anywhere, Draco.  You have to believe that I'm not going to walk away from this.'
'He was going to Hex me, Hermione.  I don't understand him.  Perhaps I never really did.'
A pitiful whimper scratched it's way out of Draco's throat.  So full of misery and pain that Madam Pomfrey dropped her wand, allowing it to clatter to the floor as if it were a branding iron.
'I want it back.'  Ron broke, his head falling to her shoulder where he was quickly gathered close, his words muffled in her robes.  'I want my friend back.'
'You can have as much time as you need, Draco.  We can keep you safe here.  No one will be able to find you.'
It includes thoughts and descriptions of suicide.  If any of this makes you uncomfortable, please do not read this chapter.  It does not affect the rest of the story should you wish to skip this part.
'Malfoy?'  Shocked, Neville crept forward, all thoughts of his own warmth gone from his mind.
Silly kisses after that, played alongside late night games of dare, teasing and spinning bottles.  Kisses that really meant nothing, kisses that would never be more than teenage jokes.
'Thirsty.'  Draco gasped, precious drops of water escaping down his chin.  'Can't...  Can't remember...'  Water.  How long had it been since he last had water?  Aunt Bella?  No, that wasn't right.  This morning?  Water for breakfast.  Toast forgotten.  Butter and jam making his stomach turn.  But that wasn't right either.  The corridor...  McGonagall's sharp rap on his shoulder...  Harry's rejection...
'Why?  So you'll feel better?  Why should I tell you any of it?'  He tore his hand free.  She didn't get to do this to him, it was too late for comfort.  'It's got nothing to do with anyone.  You've made your feelings quite clear on the subject.  I think that's enough for me.'
The door had closed and no one came back.  He had been left to die.  There were no more hands, no more visits.  The rotting corpses continued to decay, but they no longer danced.  He was alone.
'Potter's friends are the brightest of them all, they will know that something is amiss.'
He had always believed Draco's eyes to be a cold grey, hard and unforgiving.  But now that he was so very close, Harry could see them for what they truly were.
'I...I only wanted to see the stars.'  A choked whisper, his knees giving way.  It was too late.  Harry couldn't save him, no one could save him.
Cursing himself that he was unable to place a silencing charm around the bed, he sat beside Harry, his hand instinctively reaching out before he thought better of it.  Was it still okay to touch him?  Would Harry even want him too?
All he wanted to do was defy Draco's request, pull him up in his arms, take him away from all the glares, the shocked whispers.  Run away, escape this cruelty once and for all.  Draco didn't deserve this.
He had battled trolls and men, dueled wizards and fought spiders with knowing only one spell, struck down a monster in the walls with a thrust of a borrowed sword.  He had held Dobby's tiny fragile body as the freed House Elf had breathed his last, knowing only too clearly that the brave soul had sacrificed his life for his own.
'Harry,' Draco smiled.  'You didn't.  You are exhausted.  You have been looking after me for so long now that I can hardly remember a time when you were not here.  You come here, night after night, making me stronger, making be able to face what's to come.  You did that for me.  And it's making you ill.  It's no wonder that you spoke up, you had to.'
'Draco?  It's time to move.'  Harry's whisper shattering the easy silence. 'It's really late.  We need to go to bed.'  It pained him, but he gave the sleeping boy a gentle shake.  Draco stirred, his head shifting slightly, a frown beginning to appear.
'You have time, Draco.  There is no hurry.  Your wand, and I, for that matter, are going nowhere.  You have come a long way, and I understand how hard this has been for you.'
Unlike the boy beside her, she had glanced in Harry's direction as she had spoken to the Gryffindor group.  Helpless was the first word that had came to her.  Helpless.  And desperate to be by Draco's side.
'Careful.'  Harry soothed, his voice edged with the dust from the corridor.  'Try and sip it.'
'Let me stay.'
'When have I ever wanted easy?'  Harry pressed forehead to Draco's, his fingers on his face, his eyes.  His lips.  'I only want you.'
Draco cowered from the questioning fingertips that brushed against his icy skin.  So cold...  So thirsty...  The man in the dark always wanted to touch him, hurt him and claim him for his very own, no matter how hard he begged, or how much he promised.  It was so dark...  Someone was crying to him in sobbing bursts.  His name, over and over and over again.  Different.  Strange and somehow familiar.
'No, I don't.'  She chuckled lightly, taking Ron's slowly loosening hand in hers.  'I think we are all tired, sad, and sick of wondering when things are going to go back to some kind of normality.  I bet you anything you like that Harry is still sitting up in the common room, waiting for you to get back.'
Only, only he wasn't like that with anyone else.  He could hardly imagine sitting with Ron in this way, or Hermione, or anyone.  Only Draco.
'Harry, Hermione is talking to you.'  Neville told him quietly, nudging his shoulder.
'...  Besides the Potions room.'  The Fat Lady was still talking, her shrill words spilling from her distressed face.  'They say, they all say, they saw the Dark Lord.  Back from the dead.'  She paused for a breath as she tugged at her dress, pulling it out of shape.  'Oh, do tell us, Minerva.  Tell us.'  She was distraught, all the portraits watching this frantic exchange bore the same expression.  Owlish eyes in old and fair faces, unblinking as they hung on her every word, waiting for whatever the Headmistress might say.  Would she damn them all back to the hellish War?
'You okay?'  Harry asked, stopping them both in their unsteady journey.
Bloody Harry Potter.
'Is...is he dead?'  Hagrid asked, his voice shaking, his footsteps not venturing further than the doorway.
'I...I don't want anyone to see me, not yet.'  Draco told him, panic already stopping his voice.  The thought of bumping into a teacher, or a student...  His blood ran cold through his veins.  He couldn't stand that.
Hadn't Harry taken hours and hours to show him how it was done?  If he could do it then, after months on the floor of that dark place, then he could do it again.  He had only been sitting here for a moment against the wall of the candlelit hallway, his face pressed to his knees, terrified that once again Theodore would jump out of the darkness and begin his malicious taunts all over again.
'No.  Don't be sorry.  I think I would want that answer too.'
He allowed Harry to sit him up.  It hurt, it hurt to move, to breath.  But Harry was there, easing him gently back against a pile of Hagrid's pillows.
'I...I found him.'  Hagrid stuttered, shutting the door tightly behind them.  'In the Forest.'  He pointed a meaty finger at his bed.  'Someone left him there.  Not a stitch on him.'  Hagrid swallowed thickly.  'I...I tried to warm him up, Harry.  I...I don't want to leave him on his own, but I have to get him help.'  Hagrid broke down, great sobs rattling from his throat.  'He's dyin', Harry.'
But he knew the breeze was chasing away the last vestiges of his nightmare, the tormented dreams that had stopped either of them from sleeping throughout the night.  He allowed Draco more time, he could warm him soon, they was still time enough for that, just.
'I'm not going to abandon him just so I can go to bed!' Harry immediately went on the defensive.  The thought of not returning to Draco made his skin itch.
She could easily take out her wand and as quick as a flash she could have both the weary boys safely ensconced within Gryffindor's walls once more.  But for Draco magic only meant fear.  Silent screaming and sickness. Darkness and voices from beyond.
'Me neither.'  He made no attempt to load his plate with tempting food.  'Guess Harry didn't either.'  He nodded towards Harry's vacant space.  'Unless he hasn't woken up yet.'
And she had to close the Library for the night.
Theo nodded, his jaw set, his eyes as cold as steel.  'It did.'  The niggling idea at the back of his mind had forced itself forward, refusing to be shut away.  There was still one thing left that he could do for his old friend.  'But there is something I can do.'
'My parents lost their minds because of Malfoy's twisted family, Ron lost his brother, Colin died...'
'And I don't care. Soup first.'
And it would have been completely black inside of that potions store cupboard had it not been for the muck encrusted window, tucked up in the wall.  And had the morning sunlight been dimmed with clouds, and had the window been just a touch higher, or a just a shade dirtier, Draco never would have seen the way that light caught on the edge of the blue glass.  The painfully sharp edge glowing so prettily in that morning shaft of light.
'Always with you.'  Harry sobbed back a breath.  'I do, you know.  I do love you.'
He should have taken Draco's hand that very first night and walked away without a second thought.  Taken him from this place that had once been home to them both.  Get him away, from all the voices, from all the stares.  Take him to where they both could find sanctuary.  He had a house, he had money enough for them both.  And Harry knew they would have been able to find happiness within those waiting walls.
'I've not had one of these in years.'  Draco's tired eyes lighing on the box.  A smile crept over his lips.  'Not since I was little.'
That voice was lying to him.  He was a killer, everyone in his world knew that.
But there had been something wrong, it had always been there, and Ron had known from the moment the Slytherin had crossed the threshold into Gryffindor.  So very fucking wrong.
'I should have guessed that it would be you, Potter.'  Filch sighed wearily.  'Who else would be wandering the halls at this late hour.'
She had seen this boy as a babe in Hagrid's safe arms.  She had watched helpless as he was left on the doorstep of a family that could find no love in their hearts for him.  She had looked on as Harry did everything that was asked of him, without question, without pause.
'Draco...'  Again guilt clawed in his stomach.  He was the one who had put that pain in Draco's voice.  That sorrow.
'You already have.  Draco needs you to be strong, to get him through what he has suffered and all that he will continue to go through.'
The child was so young, and had been so innocent in the ways of the world.  It made his old heart ache to see the Malfoy boy sobbing in the corridor, not a friend to his name.
Murderer.
They clung to each other in the silence, the darkness.
'Harry...  Don't.'  His voice firm.  However much he wanted this, deep in his heart he knew it was the right thing to do.  Harry would be disgusted.
Sweet sleep was itching at Draco consciousness when McGonagall appeared once more.  He had been so very close to jumping off that wobbling precipice, falling into dark oblivion.  To do that, to take that step, was to give himself over to whatever lay in wait.
'I...I...'  Stuttering, overwhelmed with shame at his own uselessness.  He should be stronger now, should at the very least be able to take a water glass.  'I can't hold it.'  He had to tell her, desperation for the water overcoming everything.  His thirst reminding him of the Cell.
In a sickening spin of bone and flesh, Father turned into Mother.
The trunk still sat at the foot of his bed.  Still untouched, a memory made solid.
'Professor?'  Nott was the first into the room, plastering on a smirk which he now threw at Malfoy.
'I'll sort it.'  Was his answer, gruff and straight to the point.  'Leave it with me.'
They lied.
'Won't he die?'  Harry choked out.  He desperately wanted to go to the boy, but was powerless to help.
Tears that had no ending in sight, so very close to the precious card.  Draco slid it back where he treasured it, safe from the damp that crawled across his cheeks.  It wouldn't do to get the picture wet.  He had no wand to dry it with, didn't want a wand.  Not now, not ever.
'What's that?'  He had asked, pointing, already distracted.
'I don't think that is enough.'
But she had done her best with his schooling.  The boy was clever, that was never in doubt.  He would go far, if he had a mind to.  If he ultimately had any choice.
'Bed.'  She caught Draco's almost silent hum.  'Your bed.  Want...  Want to be warm.'  He pressed himself up against Harry, allowing the dark haired boy to hold his slight weight.
He hadn't asked him.  And if truth be told he had been afraid to.  Didn't really want the answer to what he suspected.  Ginny.
'Can't we do this later?'  Harry asked sharply.  'He's exhausted.'
'G...go.'  Draco gasped, looking up.  'P...please...'  His eyes huge and wet.  Sitting on the floor, surrounded by his belongings, a strong scent in the air.
'Of couse.'  Professor Binns motioned Harry up with a wave of his hand.
It was a Chocolate Frog card.
McGonagall wanted to say that she was shocked by Harry's almost question.  But it only made her sad.
'I...I can't help him.'  Draco told her, tears choking in his throat.  Panic making him unable to catch his breath.
'Me too.'  Draco admits, feeling foolish in his flushing embarrassment.  Like he is speaking the deepest secrets of his very soul.  Perhaps he is.  Perhaps it is long overdue.  'I missed you.'  He says what he has always known, from the moment he left that safety of the tapestry, and Harry.  'So much.'
Draco would find himself, late in the night, running his fingertips around the corners, barely touching the fine gold ink as it shone and glittered under the bright light of his lamp.  So very careful with his most prized possession.
'Now coming.'
'Who!'  Harry would have his answer, one way or another.
Harry was no fool, it was the right and sensible way of the world.  There would always be an upstart wizard, intent on embracing the darkness of all consuming power, craving death and destruction like so many before.  Just as there would always be a band of heroes clinging to the light, ready to draw their wands and fight for what it truly meant to be good.
Harry, his Harry.  His best friend throughout his childhood and beyond.  Kissing.  Kissing Draco Malfoy.  Scourge of Hogwarts, sworn enemy of Gryffindor.  The one they all hated, the one Harry hated.  Kissing.  They had been kissing.  Wrapped around each other, hands holding, touching, stroking.  And kissing.  The word stung, he couldn't shake the thought, the image.  So blatant, so open.  So disgusting.
Another barrage of questions skirted around, Draco realised with a sigh.  Only five days to get through and it would be a welcome solitary weekend once more.
'Hey!'  Ron exclaimed loudly.
Hogwarts was the only home he had previously known, and being back here had instantly felt right.
'We are not friends.'  Draco told her quietly.  'We never have been.'  He turned his head away from the water, from her searching gaze.
'Reading in the dark?'  Filch queried, his interest piqued.
'I don't know what else to do, Harry.  I'm sorry.'  She turned her head from his searching gaze.  'Just go.'
She had now seen his hard won life and happiness torn away by him, the nasty little Death Eater who had brought nothing but death and destruction into Hogwarts.
'What the...?'  Ron was the first to speak, his unfinished question hanging in the air between the two couples.  One standing in the open doorway, the draft from the hallway lightly banging the forgotten portrait against the stone wall, the other locked together, hands unable, unwilling to let go.
His recoil had been instantaneous.  Wrenching his hand away so fast he surely hurt her.  Twisting from her grip.  His stomach aching.  He had to get out, get away.  It was too warm in the room, he felt dizzy, faint.  Throwing back the covers, his feet on the cool floor, his back turned to her.  She had reached out, confused.  He could remember every little movement she made.  The shame still burnt in his chest.
'I told them I was going to bed.'  Harry shook his head, intertwining his fingers with Draco's  'I don't think they even noticed.  They haven't stopped all night, Draco.  It's...it's fucking horrible having to listen to all the shit they are making up, all the tales that are flying around about you.'
'Yes, you might.  You did.'  He waited as Slughorn drew deeply from the little bottle.  'But you would not have known what they were capable of.'  He waved off Slughorn's offer of the bottle, the smell of the strong contents already making him nauseous.
'Draco, I can't.'  Harry felt his own tears falling.  There was nothing he could do.  There was nothing anyone could do.
'How...  How is he?'  Harry's voice whisper soft in the silence of the empty corridor.
'I see the news has already traveled far.'  McGonagall scowled, casting her stinging gaze up and down the castle walls, noticing that none of the watching portraits would meet her eyes.
In the end it had been a relief to be back.  To be away from The Burrow.  The only house he had ever known was a comfort still, the restored familiarity after that terrible blaze was a relief.  But...  His family was incomplete.  His home was incomplete.
'I think Madam Pomfrey is scared of you.'  Draco shared his secret quietly.  'She...she thought you would be mad if you woke up in your own bed, or in one of the hospital ones.  So, she put you in here.  With me.'  Draco's words rushing out of him, shy, hesitant.  'D...do you mind?'  He lightly bit his lip, catching the soft flesh between his teeth and tugging slightly.
Not bothering to kick off his slippers or discard his dressing gown, he climbed up onto his bed, dropped the curtains to seclude himself from the rest of his friends, curled himself up into a tight ball, and began to sob.
'I already have that.'  Harry told him, kissing Draco's cheek, his gentle kisses trailing down the side of his face.  'There is nothing I want more than this.'
'I can't do anything else.'  Harry whispered into Draco's hair.  'I never thought I had a place, even coming to Hogwarts I was an outsider, an oddity.  Someone to be stared at, talked about.  Hermione and Ron took me in, but even they saw something different in me.  I didn't fit in anywhere, not really.  I guess I never felt like I had a home.  Not a real one.'
He was powerless.  He could offer no comfort, or a helping arm across the path.  He could only watch, and wait for night to fall.  Until every single body were within their own beds, and asleep.  He could not take chances, not with them, not with Draco.  He had to respect his wishes.  Harry didn't care if he was discovered in Draco's bed, he didn't give a damn if the entire school became aware of where he spent his nights.  But Draco was.   And that was all that mattered.
'Come on.  It's okay.'  Hagrid carefully squeezed the slight shoulder beneath his hand, his strength held in check.  'You have nothing to be frightened of in there.  It's home.'
Gregory Goyle had heard things.
'Go, Harry.  I'll cover for you.'  Neville looked from his headmistress to his friend, frightened by what he saw pass between them.  Unspoken words that left Harry terrified, colour draining from his face in moments.  'You need to go.'  He had to give the stricken boy a little shove, break him out of his stupor.
Ron's hopeful wish for a normal evening came shattering down around him.
'I can't leave you, Draco.  I'm not going to.'
'Yes.  It will.'  Professor McGonagall nodded her agreement.  She took another sip, fixing Madam Pomfrey with her steady gaze.
'Did...did I pass out?'  He remembered a sudden dizziness, a pounding in his head.  And then nothing.
'You still with me?'  Harry was there, on the bed, his leg tucked under him, his hand on Draco's cheek.  Gently brushing away the last of the drying tears.
'You almost died.'  Harry's voice broke.  'I thought y...you were going to.'  He pressed Draco closer.  'I...I never knew.  I never knew what you...  What you meant to...to...'  Harry's sharp intake of breath startled Draco.  'After all this time.  So much time.'
'You sound as though you have forgiven them.'
'Not sleeping, mate?'  Ron asked, knowing only too well the personal battles at bedtime.
There was no warmth to be found here, but it was an ending.  The pain would stop, the evil would cease and he would slip away into eternal darkness.  He could taste it's sweetness, feel it's welcome.
Two chairs sat pushed closely together, one heavy with soft covers, piled high with cushions.  The other void of any comfort, the bare slatted wood clearly waiting for Harry.
'I...  I think you would...  f...follow me anywhere.'  Draco's lips quirked as he tried for a smile.  'I can't...  can't seem to get rid of y...you.'
Murmurs in his hallway, talking between those robed figures that visited his father.
'Please.'  He begged.  She had to go.  Why wouldn't she just leave?  'It...it's...  I'm all right.'
'He killed them.'  They heard him murmur, voice empty.  'Made me see.  Left them.  I...I couldn't reach, the chain wouldn't let me.  I only wanted to be close.'  He sobbed.  'Just one more time.'
He had hurt Draco.  And for that reason alone Nott deserved all that he could deliver.
'I know.  I wanted to check to see if you were all right.'  Neville stepped into the room, fishing in his pocket for the clean tissue he always carried with him.  'I overheard Ron and Hermione talking about it over breakfast.'
Yes, clearly he belonged to their Lord and Master.  But strangely, he was generous with his possession.  He was willing, and keen to share his prize.
'Just when you start to bend to me, you show an act of willfulness.  I will not have it, Draco.'  A relentless fury from the figure over him.  'Do you not learn anything?  Why do you insist on fighting me?  You are mine now, my sweet child.  I only want the best for you.'
He was Harry Potter's very worst nightmare.
Draco knew it was his fault.  He hadn't been looking, he was distracted.  Wanted his bed.  The solitude.  Wanted warm arms and kind, gentle words.  Wanted them to chase the world away.  It was all too much.  He couldn't look up, couldn't make eye contact with those hooded eyes glaring down at him.  He deserved it all.
'You were not to know.'  Madam Pomfrey tried to placate him.  'The care of Draco lies solely with me.  I was the one to urge the potion onto him.  You are not to blame, Harry.'
'Thanks!'  Harry grinned.
And then Draco saw him.
He had killed him, watched him vanish into the ether.  His scar stopped throbbing, his mind was his own again.  Voldemort was dead.  But not for Draco.
'Yes, my lord.'  A figure in a mask answering.  Why bother with a mask?  Draco knew that voice.  This man was a father to a friend, a man he had known, a man who had raped him moments ago.
Safety was tenuous in his early years.  His home had never truly been a place he was comfortable in.  He had never known when there would be a knock at the door, a Death Eater at the breakfast table.
'Later, Draco.  You'll thank me later, I promise.'  She settled him back against the soft bedding, fussed with the covers.
'Ready then?'  Harry asked, not liking this one bit.
So, Malfoy would stop at nothing.  It was already clear just from the repeated rumours flying around the castle that the Gryffindor's had finally seen sense and thrown the dirty slut from their rooms.
Whispering, always whispering.
Draco felt himself flush under Harry's gaze.  Whoever would have believed that Harry Potter would shed tears over the son of a Death Eater, the son of Lucius Malfoy?  A boy who also bore the same fateful mark on his forearm as his father.  It was unthinkable.
Once again he felt his face flush with heat as he pulled the fraying drawstring closed around his few possessions.  But it was something.  A little lasting part of Harry that he would never have to give up, would never have to walk away from.
But this 'thing' with Malfoy.  No, Harry shook himself, fingers slipping on the slick broom.  Not Malfoy.  Draco.  This 'thing' with Draco had come out of nowhere.  Hitting his carefully constructed life, shaking him to his core.
Gripped by pain and fear, his body would not be still, shaking, trembling.  He knew hurt now.  Understood real agony that had been beyond his comprehension before.  Not anymore.  This was what it meant to die.
The tatty bag, carried by the tatty boy.  The boy with stripes across his back and blood hidden under his sleeve.  Glass in his hand and tears in his eyes as he sat alone in the potions cupboard, as Ron had walked away from the sight, refusing to help, to even acknowledge that there was anything wrong with him.
It was the haunted look in those grey eyes, the sunken pallor of his thin skin, and the way the borrowed robe hung around his once lithe body.  Now wasted and fragile.
Draco sat, waited under the cover of curtains.  Sleep was out of the question, not unless he wanted to face the demons of the past alone.  The sound of Nott's laughing voice.
What had he done?
He wasn't gone long, but still Draco could feel them circling the bed.  If he only closed his eyes...
And there would always, always be a Chocolate Frog card ready and waiting to capture these figures within a golden frame.
'Draco, you didn't need to do this.'  Harry turned to him, watching as Draco's skin flushed.  They would spend the night together, it was unspoken.  Harry would pull him close, touching that fire warmed skin, leave the curtains open, watch the stars from the windows.  'What is it?
Folds of a once beautiful black dress, now faded and torn.  Sewn just for her, encrusted with jewels that still glittered and glowed as they caught the last of the light, as the person that was once Draco's mother swirled almost majestically before her son.  Strips of flesh hanging from tattered hands that reached towards him.
It was the secret thrill for the start of a brand new school week, and all the possibilities it could bring.  Whether that be an unexpected test he could get top marks in, perhaps a Potions assignment that he would excel at.  A dueling class when he could send an opponent on his back, or even a quiet Runes lesson when understanding would all fall into place.
'No one could have known what he was to become.'  Draco told him.  'My own father chose to follow him into that darkness.'
'I'm sorry, Harry.  But something happened to Draco in that Cell.  We have scant information, we have to know.'  McGonagall told him.  'Draco, please.'  She urged the blond boy to continue.
Silver.  Flecked with the palest of blue, they held a warmth that Harry hadn't know to be possible in such a light colour.  Pain tightly in check behind them, but despite all that, despite everything, it still didn't manage to dim the intensity of colour that danced within those shocking orbs.
There were a lot of things the red head should have done differently that day.
'Because they love you, Harry.'  McGonagall reached into her robes, pulling a clean tissue from its folds.  She handed it to Harry.  'And they always have.  You yourself doubted Mr Malfoy, you and he shared such a dramatic past, full of nothing but anger and childhood violence.  In no way am I condoning what your friends said to you and he, but, I can only imagine the shock it must have brought your companions upon seeing you both in such a delicate position.  They need time to process this surprising turn of events.'  She fell into silence as Harry took the time to wipe his eyes.
'There is a person, or several people, within this room who have deliberately set out to harm, humiliate and cause great distress, with no regard for the devastating consequences of their wicked actions.'  She allowed her crushing words to sink in, watching carefully for any spark of admission, any sign that the culprit held any remorse.  'Never, in all my years of being a teacher, and your headmistress, have I ever felt such shame towards any of my students.'  She saw more tears, she saw red faces and the tops of heads as her students lowered their gaze.
'Yeah.'
He had to end it.
'Maybe it doesn't.  Not to him, anyway.'  She shrugged her shoulders.  'It's our last year, maybe he wants to move on from how things used to be, and concentrate on his future.'
'You did the right thing, Poppy.'  Professor McGonagall put a placating hand on the arm of her fretful friend.  'It appears to me that Harry is on the edge of dangerous where Draco is concerned.  The very air crackles around him whenever Draco appears to be suffering or is in distress.  I fear the repercussions if Harry is forced to part from him.  So yes, you were right in placing Mr Potter beside him for tonight.'
But it was more than that.  Snide, sneeky comments whenever Draco walked by, dark glares and muttered hatred.  Harry wanted to scream at them all.  How was it that they could not see the pain in Draco's eyes, that deep ache in his fragile body?  Why were they all so very cruel?
Harry had done this, all of this.
'Haven't we all?  My brother died.'
'He can't do this.'  Harry spoke up.  'Don't ask him too.'  His attention turned to Draco, shivering, crying.  'You will have to figure out how to help him without all the questions.  It's not fair to put him through it.'
Harry wanted to escape, to go back to a boy only feet away, lying in a bed that swamped him.  He didn't want to follow McGonagall's advice.  He didn't need food, sleep.  He needed to be sitting beside Malfoy.
Blinking in the light.
A slight nod, and Harry was there.  Gathering him up so very carefully.
Draco forcing himself to stay awake, blinking back the grit and fear.  Wanting so desperately to give in, to close his exhausted eyes and forget, if only for a moment.
He wanted his Mother.  He wanted Harry.
'Harry...'  Draco felt the lump grow in his throat.  'You...you would trust me with your fathers cloak?'
The darkness, the mold and damp.  So much blood.  So much filth.
'Harry, it's all right.'  Draco consoled, his thumb rubbing gentle circles over his hand, down his wrist.  He too had heard the Fat Lady and her muted voice.  Yes, she had not been friendly, she had not been kind.  But he understood.  'It doesn't matter anymore.'
'It's really not the done thing, Minerva, but...'
Over and over and over, Harry's warm fingers brushed against him, soft, careful strokes to his vulnerable flesh.
She was so good, kind.  She never reprimanded or demanded.  But still he would catch the disappointment in her eyes, her sadness as she carried away the hardly touched meals.
Let the dark man take him.
Biting back a sigh, fixing a smile into place, he pushed himself away from the window, dragging his eyes from Draco's progress across the damp grounds.
He had been the one to lead the wolf in, three nights away from the fullness of the moon.  Already in the grip of it's bloodlust, the Werewolf's body was heavy with the realisation of the beast caged within it's human prison.
'Mr Malfoy...'
Please forgive me taking your map from you, believe me when I say that no harm will come to it.
'Harry...'  He gasped, his hands reaching out to touch the solid chest of the body in front of him, to ground him, to make him realise that he was real, that Harry was real.
And here Harry sat, at the table with his evening meal cooling in front of him, terrified to move, to even open his mouth for fear that he would do untold damage.  Fear that he would climb up onto the table amidst the plates and glasses and detritus, draw his wand and hex them all into next week for even daring to mentioning Draco's name.
What would a seasoned Witch be so frightened of?  Why send a useless Squib to take care of it?
The congealing mass of scrambled eggs made his stomach lurch.  He moved the mess around his plate, trying to give the impression of eating without actually bringing the fork to his lips.  How could he even think about eating while Draco lay in torment?  How could anyone?
'There isn't anyone to come in.'  Harry grinned.
'I...I've h...had worse.'  He stuttered, sucking in a breath when her hand returned to his stomach, the weakened muscle quivering under her fingers.  He wanted to scream at her, wanted to bat her terrible hands away, dash the stinking, useless potion across the walls.  It wouldn't work, why should this one be any different to the rest?  How could she not see that?
They fell asleep together. It was never mentioned.
'You haven't, not at all.  Don't think that.'  Neville squeezed him tightly, his hold almost bruising.  'You have done the very best for him, and Draco knows that.  He might come back, once he realises the way you feel about him.'
It all went unnoticed by the two boys sat before the fire.
'I am.  Thank you.'  Raising his tear streaked face, Harry smiled.
'D...dreaming.'  Draco turned his head to the sound of Harry's gentle voice.  He was too afraid to open his eyes, knowing that he would only see darkness, the four walls of the Cell closing in around him.  The sound of his own screaming.  Not the soft cadence of the voice that promised him the world.
'Hagrid's back.'  Harry took hold of Draco's hand and held it to his chest, his attention back to being fixed entirely on the boy in his arms.  'Nothing to worry about.'
'Git.'  Ron muttered under his breath, rubbing at his arm.  He wanted to do nothing more than shove Nott to the floor and plant his fist into his grinning face.  Shaking the destructive thoughts away, he continued into the store cupboard.
But it had been in his nightmares.  Every night, when he closed his eyes on the day and looked into his deep imagination.  It was exactly this.
His moth-eaten bag, adopted from lost property all those months ago, had finally given up.  The fraying seams parting the moment it had slipped through his trembling fingers.  Clattering unnoticed to the floor, Draco's few possessions scattering across the hard flagstones, ready to be trampled upon by his muted classmates.
'Don't ever be ashamed.  Don't ever think that you are not worth anything.'  He took a breath, knowing what was about to spill from his lips.  'You are beautiful.'  He found his skin again, pushing his hand up and under the soft cotton top.  His palm against Draco's back.  'You are warm, alive.  That's all I could ever wish for.'  His fingers sure, stroking across that evil he found, the raised scars that caused so much pain.  Serpents twisting across once smooth skin.  All the terrible things that were done to the boy who lay in his arms.
Draco's heart was still pounding as he dared to look out through the crack Nott had left.
'I fucking heard you!'  He shouted into the quiet room.  'You had to ruin it, didn't you.  You had to ruin my night.'
Harry was his home.
'We have to move.'  Harry told Draco gently, immediately regretting it when Draco clutched him tighter.
Harry didn't know how long he had stood in the darkness.  He only knew that it was silent now, the hallway beyond the tapestry still.  Dinner was over, everyone had gone back where they needed to be.  All apart from him.
Draco couldn't stop the rush of tears, burying his face into Harry's chest and gasping sobs against him.  'Y...you s...shouldn't say things l...like that.'
'I didn't save Draco though did I.'  Harry whispered, shame and tears coming to the fore.  'It was too late for him.'  He quickly scrubbed his hand over his tired eyes.  'How can anyone live with what has been done to him?  How can any of us go back to normal after everything that has happened?'
He pressed his forehead to Draco's, his hands reaching up to frame his tired, grey face.  'I'll go and run you a bath.'  He spoke, his voice soft, his words measured.  'You sit here and I'll be right back, okay?'
He inhaled sharply when she touched the open skin again, his body twisting.
He could ignore it.  Block out the whining noise and pretend that all he could hear was the whistling air and the desperately gulping breaths under his fingers.
'No.  They are waiting.'  Draco's eyelids flickered.  He tried to open them, but it was useless.  He had to warn him.  Harry had to leave.  He had to run as far away from this place as possible.  They couldn't get Harry too.  'I...I can see them.'
'Guess what?'  He exclaimed breathlessly.
'Potter.' Professor McGonagall stood before them.  Her hands wringing together, haunted, afraid.  She certainly didn't look as though she was about to reprimand them for being out of the common room and in the kitchens any time soon.  'You...you need to come with me.'  She struggled to find her words, her eyes flitting between the two boys.
'No...'
'Sit by the fire.'  Hagrid instructed.  'You look bloody freezing.'  He made his lumbering way to the stove, began setting out the tea things.  'So then, lad, how are you getting along?  Harry tells me that you are back in your classes.'
He took his seat opposite, making no move to pull anything from his tatty bag.  He simply placed it calmly on the floor beside his feet, folding his trembling hands neatly into his lap, willing them to keep still.  This was not going to be a usual Thursday evening of extra study.
'T...Thank you.'
'Yes.'  She nodded, reaching for a smile that would not come.  'That is all you can do.  And it has to be enough.'
'I'm...I'm s...sorry.'  Draco's voice could hardly be heard in the silent room.
The hard stone beneath him was cold and uncomfortable, his wet, smelling trousers rubbed against his skin, and his eyes prickled with shame.  But, it was a blessing to be sitting down, they had walked so very far.
He wouldn't look, not tonight.
He had a life, friends that he had to get back to.  Friends that would want to know where he had been all afternoon, friends that would expect to spend the evening with him.  Homework, classes, laughter.  They all belonged to Harry.
'Harry...'
'He is not going to leave the boy in a hurry, Minerva.'  Poppy sighed.  'But I for one am glad that Draco has found someone.  It has been a long time since he has had anyone looking after him.  His injuries are a testament to that.'
'He will be okay.'  A soft voice close to her ear made Hermione start.  She turned to the person now standing beside her.
'All right there, lad?'  A stupid question when he thought about it, but he knew not to make the boy jump with a mistimed hand on his trembling shoulder.  There was no telling what sort of effect his gnarled touch would have upon him.
Neville saw.
Hours of lonely work had gone into this.  Draco couldn't feel that telltale of static that he now felt around magic.  There was no fear, there was no danger of screaming panic.  Harry had placed each and every light, each candle, each blanket, by hand.
So many memories.  Too many to understand.  He wanted to sleep, he wanted to forget.  He knew he could do neither.
Harry was kissing him back, his lips warm, wet with tears, grasping him tighter, pulling his body closer.  Pouring all of his pain, all of his heartbreak into it.
'And you?'
'Thank you.'  He murmured, blinking heavy eyelids, looking at the boy sitting beside him.  'What...what do you think people would say?'
'I'd like that.'  Harry smiled, finally feeling useful.  'What would you like to listen to first?'
'I love you.'
Magic.
But it would still be cold.  It would always just be the dirty floor of an open corridor.  The stone hard, the glass sharp, the eyes watching.  This was no place for two battle scarred, world weary young men to lie.
Such a wanton little whore.  He would do anything for an easy life.
'I have his potion.'  McGonagall told him, gesturing to the slight bulge in the pocket of her robe.  'You still want to sit with him?'
'I didn't dump Ginny.  It...'  He said softly.
Draco accepted the pain before it washed over him in sickening waves of memory and fear.  Held on as darkness rushed forward to meet him, his eyes clouded with black fog when Harry helped him, easing him to his trembling legs.
'Go and get help.  I'll...I'll stay with him.'
'Yes.'  A nod, a whisper.
'It's weird that he didn't go home.'  Seamus appeared beside them, his breathing heavy from the long climb up to the Tower, but still eager to be a part of this new piece of gossip concerning the Slytherin boy.  'I would have though that Malfoy, of all people, wouldn't have wanted to be around here for Christmas.  But then he has been acting strangly since coming back.'
The flicker of the firelight that blazed in Draco's sliver eyes, the uncertainly melting away as he sunk closer, kissing him over and over and over again.
'It was me.'  Theo shook off Milly's hand, her startled squeak unheard.  'I brought the Boggart to Draco.'
Blood and glass and broken bodies littering the floor, stepping into them, onto them.  Unable to do anything more than cover over the worst with ragged robes and tapestries torn from the walls.
His friend had turned into a man without him realising, and this man was killing someone before his very eyes.
Professor McGonagall finally allowed a solitary tear to escape.  For the injured boy in Hagrid's hut.  And for the one who walked quietly back to his own bed.
'I did!'  Harry told her.  'Twice.'
Was it truly worth the risk for the sake of a piece of chocolate? Over and over and over he turned the box.
In silence that boy watched her open those great doors that revealed a room full of waiting students, all waiting for words his Headmistress could not find.
He would never be rid of it.  It circled him wherever he went.  People, places.  The Castle.  It was everywhere.  He could run.  He could leave.  Travel so far that no one would know his name, no one would ever know where it was he came from.
Perhaps no one deserved neat little explanations?  Why did anyone have to know what really happened to the boy from Slytherin House?
His own nightmares were never far away.
'There are people here who think the world of you, Draco.'  She turned back to him as she reached her door.  'Don't ever be scared of that.'
'No hospital beds.'  Harry didn't allow her the chance to finish, cutting her off before she could make any more unwanted suggestions about Draco's life.  'No more secret rooms and curtains and silencing charms.  No more magic.'  His sigh was empty, exhausted.  'It's enough, he's not hiding anymore.  It's not fair.'
'Would it truly be so bad?'  Hermione contemplated.  'Harry and Malfoy.  If...  If that was what they wanted?'  She expected a biting reply from him, but what she received surprised her.
Draco took the drink from her and gave it a tentative sip, ever aware of the water he had drank in Hagrid's hut.  Surely she would not slip him something?
Unleashed the Boggart for all to see.
'Listen to me.'  Harry whispered against Draco's skin, his throat warming under his lips.  'If this is it, if tonight never happens again, then I will always treasure it.  There is no expectations, Draco, I won't ever think that way.  All I want is for you to feel safe with me, that is more important than anything.'
'Look at how he tries to scream.  Look at the way he tries to move away from your touch.  Do it again.'
'Hold your tongue!'  McGonagall barked, almost drawing her wand from the folds of her gown.  'It was a Boggart, nothing more, nothing less.  It was a cruel prank, done to invoke the most pain.'
Draco had nothing left.
'Is it running when you are old enough to decide what's right?'  Harry couldn't contain his sigh.  'I'm sick of it all, Draco.  All this saviour bullshit.  I see them looking at me in the halls, all the new students, even the old ones stare at me.'
But, finding another word that best told Draco's story was impossible.
'Yes, just like Harry's.'  She smiled, seeing for herself the pull the wand had over Draco.  'I believe this wand will be yours.'
'Yes, I suppose she did.'  Harry turned Draco's face to his, his fingers gentle, his thumb catching tears that still fell.  'I miss them so much, Harry.  How...how do I stand it?'
'Silence!'  McGonagall's boom rang throughout the broken corridor, harmless sparks flying from her clutched wand, scattering across the ceiling and making a couple of the students scream in surprise.  'All of you!'  Fury clouded her voice, her eyes blazing as she raked her gaze across the now shocked silent crowd.
'You are the bravest person I know.'  Slughorn forced a watery smile.  'I do not know how you stand it.'
'Have we lost him?'  Ron asked her softly, his eyes pleading for an answer that she just couldn't find.  'Have we really lost Harry?'
I didn't go looking for him.'  Harry admitted.  'I couldn't.'  He leaned into Draco's touch with a weary sigh.  'Would you come with me?  If...If I left?'
'No.'  His voice could hardly be heard in the silent room, his hands clenching over and over in his lap.  He wanted to scream, cry, dash from the room.  Anything to get away from the hateful box and all it stood for.
'Harry...'  McGonagall paused, uncharacteristically unable to find the right words.  'There...there has been a problem.'
A few moments of the sound of a scraping chair, a shuffling forward of heavy feet, then Hagrid was encircling him in strong arms that spoke of safety, protection.  Layers of coarse clothing that smelled of cold and winter, and the promise of spring.
'I'm sorry.'  Draco spoke carefully.
'Nothing will.'  He heaved a sigh, keeping still under her careful, painful touch.  He wouldn't tell her how it burned, she was sad enough.
Harry Potter would never like him, would never call him friend, and Draco knew he had been ridiculous to even consider the possibility.  Harry Potter was better, braver, stronger.  Clever and selfless, and so very very kind.  Everything he would never be, everything he would never have.
'I don't want you to go.  I don't ever want you to go.'  Draco told him softly.  It was the truth.  No matter what happened now, he needed Harry.  Even if his time with him was drawing to a close.
'You are being dramatic.'
Going to her rooms to give her his customary kiss goodnight, he had caught her dabbing her eyes with a handkerchief, a tattered paperback in her hand.  A man and woman caught in an embrace adorned the cracked cover, their hands roaming freely over each other.
He had looked on in growing horror and realisation as Harry's face fell, as his eyes screwed shut, as the hand that held his fork tightened, began to shake.  And it had instantly fallen into place.
So many shadowy imaginings, so many wrong deeds.
'Fang?'  Hagrid ventured deeper into the trees, following his Boarhound's low cry.  'What you up to, boy?'  His voice unsteady.  Fang was not one for making a fuss, something had rattled him.
He was quiet when Harry came.
Imposing, formidable, dark and ancient.  Over the last few days the trunk had come to symbolise much more than a nod to his past.  It had become everything.
'He has fought for me.'  He stared down at those safe, sure hands that held his.  'But it is time for him to have his life back.  It's already been long enough.  Harry has helped me more than I could ever wish, it is time I gave him something in return.'
Those pretty brown eyes looking at him with such hurt, such desperate longing.  Wanting, needing to be told that this was some sick joke, that Harry had not been kissing the one person she could not abide.  A member of a family she had learnt to hate.  A family who had threatened her way and her entire future.  She had every right to be angry, to be fucking furious.  Draco had come to stand for the very worst of humanity.  And there he was, her best friend, kissing him.  Wrapped around the enemy.
'You can't even give me a reason, can you, Greg?'  Nott watched as Greg cast his eyes away, unable to meet the interested faces.
Here he was, being held by Harry, being helped from the floor, being treated so carefully, with so much gentleness it made his heart ache.  Harry's arms around him, his body so close that it was difficult to tell where he stopped and Harry began.  Harry rocking him, chasing away the pain that rattled through his broken body, halting the words, the hissing that was his hopeless companion.
'It's okay, you know.  You don't have to always be the strong one, the one with all the answers.'  Neville slung his arm around Harry's bare shoulders.  'You can ask for help.'  He was not in the least bit shocked when Harry finally dissolved into floods of tears.  Pulling him in closer, Neville didn't say a word.
'There is so very little else I can do for either of you, Harry.'  Her voice tailed away as she mounted the staircase, stealing herself to deal with the fractious door of Gryffindor Tower.
All it needed was a single footstep.  That arm around him, always around him, was lending him a strength he didn't have alone.  Just one tiny step and he could pretend to be normal, could pretend that everything was fine.  It wasn't, and never would be, but just for a moment.
Why did they stay?
'I d...don't think it...it w...will this time.'  Draco tried to speak, his voice broken.
'You continue to defy me.'  A heavy slap, a split lip and the metallic tang of blood filled his mouth.  'You will do whatever I wish, you will grant me all I desire.  You forget, you belong to me now, your parents cannot help you.'  He stood, monstrous over the boy cowering on the floor.  With a flick of his wand, the decomposing bodies stopped their harrowing charade, crumbling to the floor in a clatter of putrid flesh and bones.  'I will have you whipped for your insolence.  Let's see how well you defy me after your pretty little back is softened once more.'
Neville had never witnessed Professor McGonagall like that.  The Headmistress was always impeccable, had always been a strong, stern woman, always a voice of reason, of strength.  Something terrible had to have happened to put that worried look on her face.  No, Neville realised with a sickening jolt, not worried.  Outright scared.
'Really.'  Harry managed a smile, when all he wanted to do was scream.
It was hard to look through the open door and not be greeted by the sight of Professor Snape.  This dark and damp classroom had been a place of safety for Draco.  A haven where the man who taught him knew what his life was really like, a man who had always been able to see thought the bravado and the confidence.  Had seen the little lost boy underneath it all.
'It's...it's a..all g..gone.'  The boy sobbed, his fists curling tighter.  'It's...it's my fault.'
A creak of a door, heavy iron scraping against the stone floor.  It was a sound he was only too familiar with.  It signaled more pain, more hurt, more everything.  He couldn't see, could only feel as something different happened this time, a fresh torment as he was roughly picked up by cold hands, carried into the freezing night.  His back screamed in silent agony, deep cuts rubbing against the figure that held him in a devils clutch.  He was dying, why wasn't he allowed to let go?  Why this constant stream of Hell?
A flash of green Quidditch robes caught his eye before his senses were assaulted by the smell of bergamot.
He didn't remember someone dressing him, but someone surely had.  It wasn't permitted here.  Not here in the Cell.  Perhaps his begging had been answered?  Perhaps someone had finally taken pity?
'You are incredible.' Draco whispered to him, afraid that Harry would be able to pick up all the tiny inflections in his words.  Would he one day be able to see?  To truly know all the secrets of his heart?  His voice shaking, his words catching.  'And the fact that you don't realise it, don't understand it, only makes you more so.'
'Yes, Potter.  Everyone has gone.'  She got to her knees, touched his arm.  'I am so sorry this has happened to you both.  So sorry.'
There was movement in the hut, hushed voices and footsteps.  The afternoon was getting darker, the evening drawing closer.  Were they leaving him?  Was he to spend the night alone?  Draco's stomach plummeted.  He couldn't.
Draco knew instantly, knew his secret had to be discovered.  He couldn't allow Harry to think he had put another mark onto his skin.
Eyes staring, unseeing.  The green voice too hard to reach.  The light fading.
The Halloween feast was turning out to be an unusual affair.
Harry could pinpoint the exact moment when everything had turned itself around, when he no longer felt shame for his own label.
'I'm sorry.'  Neville blurted, his own eyes filling rapidly.
'I've got water, soap.'  He told him.  'Clean pyjamas.  Mine, I'm afraid.  I didn't know where to get spare ones.  I hope you don't mind.'  Draco shook his head, tried not to grin.  'Great!  And fresh bedding.'
'I don't ever want to hurt you.'  Harry whispered.
It surely would have been better than this.  In a puddle of his own piss, surrounded by shock and shame.  Surrounded by his rapist, the one who would always, always own him, body and soul.  Blood and bone.
He reached out for the shining glass, the thin skin of his fingertips grazing over the rough stone floor, catching, parting.  He was that careless now.  His only thought was to hold that broken bottle close to his body.  To where the voices lived.
'Harry makes for a good friend.  He is extremely loyal to the people he cares about.'
You didn't forget that, Draco knew.  At least he never would.  Harry Potter was someone now, not that dark haired boy from his early youth.  Someone who had appeared to have everything Draco did not.  Someone to hate, to envy, to want to be near.
The night grew late, the stars moved across the sky, and still Harry and Draco sat.  Lost in the world of Harry's making.
'No need to apologise, mate.  Just returning the favour.'  He grinned.  'I might not ever mention it, but I do remember that night you got in my bed.  And I appreciate what you did for me.  You being there made me realise that I wasn't on my own.  Just like you are not now.'
He couldn't stay.  Not in that room  Not with her.
This particular student clearly thought none of those things.
'You did all this?'  Draco asked when they rounded the corner.
Now was the time for a little retribution.
Harry's promise still rang in his ears.  He said he would be back, swore that it wouldn't take long to turn on the taps and fill the bath with steaming water to help wash away the memories.  And then left him alone with a brushing kiss to his hair.
Draco glanced around the empty room, knowing full well that he was alone, and had been for hours now.  But that didn't stop the feelings of guilt, like he was wrong to have this secret, like it carried with it shame that couldn't be shared, shouldn't be discovered.
'And I would not dream of asking you to.'  She tried to calm him.  'But Harry, you are not sleeping.  You are not eating.'
And Ron.  He had been right, it wasn't fair.  He should have died, Merlin knew he had wanted to.
'It's all right.'  Harry stroked his hair, could see the fear in his rigid body.  'It's all done now.'
Could a few cuts be as bad as that?  Not many, two or three, as deep as he could bear.  Across the Dark Mark.
'I remember it all.'  He spoke softly.  'I...I can't ever forget.'
It was reckless to dream.
'I brought you something.'  Harry told him once Pomfrey had closed the door firmly behind him.  Holding out his hands, Draco could see that Harry was carrying with him some books and a strange looking blue thing resting on the top.  A rubber bag with a stopper.  'It's a hot water bottle.'  Harry noticed Draco scrunching up his forehead in confusion  'It's a Muggle thing, it will keep you warm.'  He placed the items on the bottom of Draco's bed, mindful of his legs.  'I've put a charm on it, it will stay hot for hours.  You always look so cold.'  He added softly, embarrassed.
Sorry would never make Ron see, and it could not put a smile back on Hermione's face.  It wouldn't give Harry his life back, or undo all the wrong.  But Draco needed it, as much as he had ever needed anything.  He had to say the word before it was all over.
'A...ashamed.'
Draco sucked in a breath, his skin a deep purple and aching.
McGonagall guided him from the room.  The low murmur that followed them grew until Draco could hear it from the foot of the stairs.  Angry voices rising in pitch until it was a veritable wall of noise at his back.
'I miss them so much.'  Draco whispered.  'But I would not want them to see the mess He has made of me.'  Harry felt his eyes prickle with tears, his thumb rubbing gentle circles on Draco's thin wrist. 'Mother was very proud of her looks, so was Father.  They took care of the way they dressed, of their bodies.  It was important to them, and I guess they instilled that into me also.  But now, now they would be horrified.'
'You don't have to understand it, Draco.  You just have to accept it.'  She smiled sadly.
He blinked in his surroundings, a hut of some sort, a dizzy recollection tugged, just at the edge of his memory.
He saw his only hope of salvation gasp his last gasp.  Cold, hard, so very dead.  The lifeless body looking up at him from yet another cruel vision, from the wet ground, from the gaping bite in his unmoving throat, his lifeblood spilling onto the unforgiving floor.
Harry sighed his relief, venturing around the corner to make sure that Filch was indeed heading in the opposite direction.  Several minutes ticked by before he was truly satisfied that he and Draco were once again alone. He headed back to where he had left him, safe under his fathers Invisibility Cloak.
'Harry, what the fuck?  This isn't you, this isn't right.  You hate him!  You can't be doing this, you can't be...be kissing him!'  Ron forced the vile word from his lips, the very taste of it twisting his stomach into a sickening knot.  'Have you forgotten everything?  You hate him more than you have ever hated anyone.'
It was dark there.  Dark and warm and within his reach.
'How can you say that?  How can that even be true?'
And he would know.  Harry would know what he had put to use.  He would imagine the sight.  Blame himself forever.  Carry the burden of knowing it was something that had once belonged to him, that he had given freely to provide a little warmth, a little comfort.  Not eternal sleep, not the coldness of death.
He had promised him, sworn that he would do nothing, say nothing.  Pretend that they hadn't spent the last months chasing away nightmares, wrapped together in blankets, hands stroking, calming.
Draco was far from being okay.  His chest heaving, his eyes blown wide with fright.
There were patches of light in his darkness.  The surety that he would be released, that he would never have to return to Azkaban.  His plea that he never meant to escape, not really.  How could he refuse what the Dark Lord bid?
It was Harry.
'You gonna stand there all day?'  Oddly reminiscent of his own words to Harry that morning, Hagrid's gruff, friendly voice made him jump.  Fang stepped forward, sniffing, interested in the boy who seemed strangely familiar.
Right up until the visit from his son.
And later, when McGonagall had apeared and spirited him away, that haunted look in her eyes, Neville had vowed to himself there and then that he would allow Harry his secret.  He would never ask, he would never mention it again.
Curled up on the floor, kicked, bleeding, taunted.  A circle of men, wands drawn.  They liked to see him cry, to see him beg.  They would always part for the one who demanded it.  They would show Him what they had done, what Draco had always deserved.
'Draco...'
'I have made so many mistakes, Draco.  So many.  If I had known...'  He paused, shaking his head.  'I taught that boy, all those long years ago.  And...  There was already a darkness in him, long before he came here.  I fear he was always headed in the direction of evil.  But...  I was foolish, stupid, even then.'
'I didn't.'  Harry admitted.  'I just wish I had been able to do it sooner.  So many people died, Draco.  So many people hurt by him.  Look at what he did to you.'
'Ginny looks happy.'  Was the first thing from Draco later, much later, that night.
'Are you sure?'  Harry's brow furrowed, he knew better, but he also knew not to push.  Draco was allowed his secrets, however much it hurt to see him keep them close.  'I'm not going anywhere, you do know that.  You can tell me anything, anytime.'
'He took everything from me, he left nothing behind.  My parents, my home, my future.  He even took my...my virginity.'  He gulped away the word, feeling so much shame rush through him.  'I will not allow him to take my voice.'
Draco's head moved weakly from side to side, his eyes tightly closed, trapping the terror within.  His left arm filled with cramp.  His fingers curled around on themselves.  Stiff and locked with pain.  The Dark Mark making itself known.  He whimpered quietly, softly.  Afraid of being heard, terrified of the figures who no longer guarded his sleep.
Friday nights always saw the same group of people gathered around the Gryffindor fireplace.  Chatting, reading, ploughing through homework, or, in in the case of Harry and Ron, playing a considered, oftentimes noisy, game of Chess.
'You coming down for breakfast, mate?'
'Draco, shh.'  Harry stopped him, seeing for himself the rising tide of tears that threatened to engulf the exhausted boy.  'There is no rush, no need to even be thinking about such things.  What we have, what we did, it's right.  It's only about us, not what you think we should be doing.  That...that kiss, it was perfect.'
Shame crept up on Draco, he was a state.  How could Harry stand to touch him like this?  The smell emanating from his filthy body was surely overwhelming.  But still Harry held him.  Only a child could be forgiven for wetting himself.  And Draco was far from that.
'Something did happen to you tonight, didn't it?'  His hold on Draco tightened, his eyes darkening.  'I could see it in your face when you came back from McGonagall, you had been crying.  Was it her?  Or was it something else, someone else?'
'I'm fine.'
Sparks of blue flame, yellow fire.  Of red Crucio.
'Ah.'  She smiled wistfully, beckoning him closer.  'It is something your father very much disapproves of.'  She offered him the book.  'He believes that this frivolity of mine should be extinguished.  It does not do well to dream, he tells me.  But, Draco, my darling.  Sometimes dreams are the one thing that make a life worth living.  Do you not think?'
'That's it, Malfoy.  Turn on the water works now that Mummy and Daddy aren't here to save you.  I hear they are living the high life in France, that true?'  Nott cocked his head, still not moving, his fingers circling.  'Do you honestly think they give a fuck what happens to you now?'  He finally drew away, smirking at the reaction he had caused.  'Well, you never know, perhaps you'll get to find out for yourself sooner or later.'  He backed up, blowing a kiss in Draco's direction.  'After all, there is no telling what's behind the corner.'
'I lied, Hermione...'  Her answering words to him were swallowed by McGonagall clearing her throat.
'Harry...'  Madam Pomfrey interjected.
Several people turned in his direction as Harry's feet carried him through the smiling portrait hole and onto the threadbare rug.
'You did lie to me.'  His voice was dry, darkness in his tone, his eyes flashing dangerously as he took in the sight before him.
Harry touched his lips, the memory still burning against his skin.
He would buy Draco a Chocolate Frog.
'That's enough now, Minerva.'
'Burns.'  He bit back a gasp, trying to keep from moving away from the hands that were rubbing into his wounds.
He shook away the thought quickly, it would not do to dwell on what was waiting for them.
'About what?'  Harry's fingers moving slowly over Draco's palms, drawing circles.
His arms wrapped around him, ever thankful that Draco allowed this closeness.
She carefully placed her hand on his twitching leg, preventing him without words from storming off down the corridor to brood alone.  'Grief is a terrible thing, as you well know.'  Her voice was kind, filled with understanding.  'And it had the ability to make monsters out of the kindness of souls.  Your friends want to see you happy, they want to protect you and wish you nothing but the best in life.'
'Anywhere, Draco. Anywhere at all.'
'I'm sorry.'  Harry tried to speak, his throat thick with tears once more.  'I'm sorry.'  He stopped, pulled Draco close as he struggled to catch his breath, waited for the fog to lift.
'Did you sleep?' He asked her quietly, his eyes straying to Harry's empty chair.
'In time you can.'
He could take away the pain and the fear and hold him until he slept again, until he smiled.
'Yes.'  She smiled sadly at the boy in his charge.  'I think you are right, Argus.  Thank you for bringing him to me.  You did the right thing.'
'I very much doubt that.'  Ron spoke, somewhat apprehensive.  The hate in Harry's eyes coming back to mind.  'But let's find out, shall we.'
He had a name.
'As I'll ever be.'  He answered. And so, against his better judgment, Harry held out his strong, steady hands, ready for Draco to take.
Snape would never...  He wouldn't do that...  He wasn't like that.
Cut it out.
'Don't let me keep you.'  Ron stood aside.
Stripped of his expensive clothing, thrown into the basement celler that had always remained empty under his ownership, Nott had looked on as the boy was cast down those stone steps, locked into the darkness.  He hadn't bothered to pay much thought to him.
He may have teased, he may have cajoled, he might have even hidden her books on more than one occasion, just to get her to take a break.  Just so she would sit with him for a while.  But he was always proud.
'Come with me.  You're so cold.'
'Why did he do it?'  Ron paused, looking at Hermione's distracted face.  'Why did he pick Harry like that?'
And when he did, the sight before him made him weep.
He was out of the classroom before anyone could offer up further questions.
Harry's world fell away as he stared at the card in his shaking hand.
'Tell me the truth, Draco.  Please.'  His hands tightened, pulling Draco ever closer.  'I need to know.'  He couldn't stop the sudden sobs that gripped his chest with icy claws.  His face pressed up against Draco, soaking his pale skin with salty tears.  'Are you b...being kind?'
'No.  It's not my wand.'  He was gone, vanishing into the darkness of the hallway.
'Yeah, sorry.  I didn't mean to intrude.'  Neville spoke gently, seeing for himself that spark of hope die in Harry's emerald eyes.
'There wasn't anyone else.'  Draco whispered, taking the mug from Hagrid, wrapping his cold hands around it.
'You never told me about Hogsmeade.'
'No, I...I'm going to go and see Hagrid today.'  He stared at the window ledge, at where their hands lay.  He wanted that hand to reach across the scant distance, just a brush of fingers.  It would be enough.  But he wouldn't ask.
'He's dying!'  Harry blinked, 'I'd say that isn't at all easy!'
Heartbroken and sobbing, Ron's little sister had confided in her.  About the Room of Requirements.  About that big, soft bed.  She had talked of her own hands, touching him, guiding him.  Her longing, her desire deep for Harry.  She spoke in faltering sentences of the way he had pulled free, his body unable, his own desire never quite catching alight.  His hand wrenching, burning.  She had wanted him so much, but he had never wanted her.  Not like that, never like that.
Had it been days or weeks?  Draco never thought to count the nights, the days without end.  All he knew were these safe four walls.  Three people coming to visit.
'Are you sure you are ready for this?'  Harry was not happy, clear resistance in his eyes.  'Madam Pomfrey said only if you are feeling up to it.'  His head cocked, fingers twitching by his thighs, standing over him as Draco sat on the very edge of his bed.  'You already look really pale.'
Hagrid laid the dying boy on his bed, tears and fury clouding his vision.  Who would do such a thing to someone?  Who would want to hurt a living person in such a way?  Hagrid had seen some horrors in his time, things that he didn't think upon, but this...  This was something else.
'I guarantee you that this will help.'  She held out a glass of water.  'I have put a little Dreamless Sleep potion in here.  Can you drink it for me?'  Draco turned his head, wanting the water, but not the darkness of sleep.  So thirsty.  It wasn't fair.
'I should have been honest with her from the start.  It...it was never meant to be, and I think I always knew that.'  He let a sigh escape, the weight of the world heavy on his shoulders.
'I...I'm sorry.'
The day was not theirs, but the common room was.  Another feast in the Great Hall, remaining students dining with the teachers on this special day.  Some had stayed, most had not.  Draco joined them all, finally.  Shocking Harry, the boy had sat near.  Only teachers spoke to him, the students still showing their contempt to the boy who had vanished for so very long.
'Everything.'  Ron finished what Hermione could not, his hand resting lightly in her hair as she sobbed.  'It was everything.'  When McGonagall turned her face to look up at the young pair standing before her, she saw pain etched in his face. 'Was it true?'  He asked, clearly battling to keep his own voice in check.  'Was that how it was for him?  Malfoy?'
'You deserve this, bastard child.  You deserve all I can dream up for you.'  Fingers higher still, clawing at his thighs. 'You think they liked watching you under me?  Watching you writhe and squirm?  They saw a darkness in you, Draco, a will to defy me.  You cannot escape me, Draco.  You shall belong to me.  Forever.'
Harry pulled at his scarf, wanted it tight enough to hurt, to choke.  To feel some of the pain Draco had felt as hands had wrapped around him, bruising.
'They look at me like I have done something incredible, like they are proud to be walking in the same space as me, breathing the same air.  I'm still just me.  A scruffy kid who grew up in a cupboard.  I'm still just a student, same as them.'
Nott remembered how it really had made so much sense in his head.
A rattling of chains being dragged across the floor, jangling with an air of finality.  A gaping face, a tightly clasped cage around a grinning maw.  A man close to a wolf, naked, hard with the need for release.  Crawling over the flagstones, indistinct shapes holding him tightly in check, ready to unleash the beast.
Snape would know what to say, Snape would not have avoided him, would not have kept his head to the floor whenever they happened to pass in the corridors, or offer construction in a lesson.
'You won't tell me.'  Ron's voice dropped, he turned his back.  'What's so fucking important that you can give up every single thing so easily?  Tell me, Harry.  Just tell me!'
'Can't...can't you make him sleep?  So he won't feel it.'  Harry whispered, unable to drag his eyes from the naked, emaciated form.
Yes, Harry trod the familiar path, quiet and in the presence of good friends, but his head remained back at the castle.  He couldn't help but wonder if he and Draco would ever make this walk together.  Side by side, laughing, joking, chatting with friends who accepted this strange new friendship easily.
'My back...  My scars.  I'm a mess, Harry.  You...you shouldn't touch me.'  He could feel the tears coming, furious at himself.  He had meant to stay strong.  He didn't want the pity, he wanted to make Harry know that it was all right to not touch him, he understood.  'It's okay, really.  I can't look, I wouldn't never expect you to think that it's okay either.  You shouldn't touch something so...so awful, so ugly.'
'I don't know what I need.'  Harry finally broke the silence.  'I gave up thinking that way a long, long time ago.  Need never came into my life.'
'You are, Harry.  Don't...Don't say that.  I'm sorry, I wasn't thinking.  That's not what I think.  No.'
Four days, that was all it had been.  Just four little days.  He could almost pretend that it hadn't happened.  That Draco had not left him behind.
The one with the whip.  He was raising it above his head, ready to bring it lashing down across a bare back.  Too many times to count.  Splashes of blood over his robes, in his hair.
He had to protect Harry.
It had been the look in Harry's eyes that had hurt the most.  More than the shoving to the floor, and the drawing of his wand.  There had been a look of such pure hatred radiating from the dark haired boy of his family, that the blood in Ron's veins had froze, his heart skipping a sickening beat.  It was the new memory of that look that had Ron wiping at his eyes as he walked down the empty hallways.  The Library the focus of his direction.
He didn't want to be anywhere.
'You are doing wonderfully by Draco.  He is lucky to have you.'
'Some things have always been worth fighting for.'  Harry answered.  They were so very close, a breath all that separated them.  'You are one of them.'
Milly's anger dulled.  How could she keep her hot anger in the face of Greg's brokenhearted distress.  Would she have done the very same thing if she had been in his position?
'Ron, it's only Quidditch.'  Harry tried for a smile, wanted his friend to realise he was being ridiculous.
'What?'  Ron turned, wrenching his body from Harry's bruising grip.  'You're sticking up for him?  You hate him more than any of us!'
'It was not your fault, Draco.  You did what was right.'
But he was powerless to help.  Draco wouldn't want him here, didn't need him.
Hermione wasn't holding his arm hard enough to hurt, and Harry Potter, the boy from the platform, the boy who had become his friend, his very best friend, wasn't choking the life from a Slytherin in the corridor of Hogwarts.
'Draco...'
'Make me understand it, Harry.  Give me a reason why you are creeping out at night to be with the bastard who made your life, all of our lives Hell for so bloody long.'
He was all right, Ron had to tell himself.  Malfoy was back at his desk.  He wasn't in pain, he wasn't bleeding.  He was almost smiling as he packed up his books and stiff white quill.
She watched silently as Harry stepped forward, finally breaking out of the spell they both seemed to be under.
'Harry?'  Draco's whispered question told him everything.  He knew, had already guessed just from the look on his reddened face.
Ron knew that if he just kept pretending, If he didn't speak, didn't move, then it hadn't happened.  Right?  Wasn't that how things worked?  Harry hadn't spoken, it was just his tired imagination playing dirty tricks.  Harry wouldn't do that, Harry loved Quidditch, it was his life.  Ron allowed his fingers to graze the figure he was next to move.  Just keep pretending.  First year.  Just for tonight, just for a few hours more.  Was that really too much to ask?
'Where do you think he is?'  Ron asked after a time had passed.  'Do you think he's with him?  Malfoy?'  His voice hushed as he glanced around the room, making sure that they could not be overheard.
'Have you touched it?'  Her eyes dropping to the terrible Mark burned into his forearm.
Harry couldn't help but smile, his own tiredness washing over him.  It was so tempting to follow Draco into sleep.  But he had to keep his eyes open.  If for one moment he allowed himself that tiny luxury, then all could be lost.
Draco had obviously turned his vile attentions to the new Potions Master.
He already knew the title, he had seen it in Malfoy's trembling hold the night he walked from the common room, barefoot and crying, seen the way Malfoy had clutching this book close to his chest, his wasted arms wrapped around the heavy tome like it was the one and only thing that made him feel safe.
He had willfully, and willingly killed.
'Harry...'
'Come on, Hermione, it's Quidditch!'  Ron told his girlfriend.  'Even I'd miss a meal for that!'
It stilled his feet in the damp grass, her question almost choking him, hanging unanswered in the cool evening air.  His hands shook, his head pounded.  Her words like a fist, driving into his stomach.  'Don't make me answer that, Hermione.'
'I told him.'  Harry stumbled on, desperate for Draco to be angry.  He wanted Draco to yell, scream at him.  Wanted Draco to hate him as much as he hated himself.  'He said such horrible things about you, lies.  And...and I told him. You can't forgive that, Draco.  Please.'  Harry scrubbed angrily at his already sore eyes.  'I betrayed you.'
'Like?'  Harry pressed, his natural curiosity aroused.
Draco had nothing left.
'Draco.'  Harry couldn't make his feet move.  Could hardly breath at the sight.  Draco propped up in the bed.  His face deathy pale, his eyes red rimmed and damp with tears.  He looked shocked, stunned.  Lost.  'I...I'm so sorry.'
'You know something, don't you?'  Raising her eyebrows in question, her gaze trying to penetrate his mind.
'What?  Why?'  Ron looked immediately crestfallen.  'But it's been planned for ages!'
'McGonagall told you I was returning back to lessons today, didn't she?'  Draco sighed, was there no end to the pain he was causing him?
Harry's scream tore through the hallway, his wand erupting in an ear-splitting spell of fire and boiling anger that had the glass shattering in the windows above and streaming to the floor in deadly shards.
'I...I always knew you would.'  His lips quirked, almost a smile.
'It's all forgotten.'  Harry told him, his breath warm against his cheek.  'Don't think about it.'
'It's all right.'  Three simple words were whispered into his hair, lips moving with a careful kiss.  Harry.  It would always be Harry.  'You are safe now.  No one can hurt you.  Never again, Draco.  I swear it with my life.'
He almost hesitated in getting up from the battered chair he sat in, almost let Malfoy walk away without a word.
'Sorry.'  Harry shrugged.  'Force of habit.'
'No.  No sleep.'  Draco murmured.  The thought of closing his eyes was more than he could stand.  'Can't.'
'You should return to the castle.'  Madam Pomfrey spoke.  She feared for Harry.  The boy may have saved the wizarding world, but he was still only that, a boy.  One who had already experienced too much pain and heartache for someone so young.  'Hagrid will take you.'  She beckoned the giant over from where he stood at the stove, pretending to brew tea.
He should have pressed that glass so deep, wrapped that dressing gown cord so tightly around his throat.  So what if they had to find him?  It wouldn't matter, he wouldn't know.
'Don't.  Don't do this.  Don't push me away.  I can't stop all this, I can't make everyone else see who you are, what you mean to me.  I can't make anything better for you, or give you back all you have lost.  But, Draco, please, you have...  You have to...'  It was all too much.  The night closing around him, the argument with Ron, the pain in Draco's voice.  Harry couldn't bear it.  'You said it, Draco, you said the words.  Don't...don't take them back.  Not now.'
So carefully Harry cradled the back of his head as he tilted the water glass to his lips, helping him to drink deeply from the glass that had been sitting out all night.
'Is it that time already?'  Slughorn rose from the chair slowly, and Nott could see the last traces of tears in the old man's eyes.  'Right, yes.  Lesson time.'  He turned from the Slytherin student, dragging a hand over his face and easing an ache from his shoulders with a shrug.  His back to the room as Nott leveled a glare at Malfoy.
And that night, when he was getting himself ready for bed, with a warm bath running in his own private bathroom, he could take that stolen little knife from his pocket and sit it on the edge of his warm bath.  Where it would stay, watching, waiting patiently for him to undress and slide into the water.
This, this right here was normal.  Sitting across from Harry Potter, the chessboard laid out in front of them.  For this brief, fleeting moment he could be back in that first year.  All the horrors, all the heartache hadn't happened.  He could pretend.  What would be the harm in pretending?
The thunder was headed his way, turning the sky to midnight, but Harry gave it no thought.  His mind already a malstrom of emotions that nothing could hope to compare to.
'Y...  Yes.'  He swallowed down the bile that was clawing up his throat.
'No need.'  Filch brushed away the comment, deciding that the boy didn't need to have him watch his slow breakdown.  Chosing to look away as Draco wiped ineffectually at his tears.  He bent, his dry bones cracking in the cold morning chill, and picked up the book Draco had dropped to the floor.
'I burned his tea.  He yelled, I shouted back, told him I hated living with them, that I wished he was dead and not my parents.  He had a bad day at work, I guess.'  Harry shrugged at the memory.  'Anyway, I was carrying on, we were alone.  I don't think he would have dared to do it if my aunt was home.  She hated me, but she wouldn't want that.  He lashed out, I pushed him too far.'
He had cried, he had called her name out into the walls.
'I'll stay with you.'  Harry promised, dropping a kiss to Draco's hair.  'I'll always stay with you.'
'Sit up, Draco.'  Madam Pomfrey helped him lean against the pillows.  'You are okay.  It's only a nightmare.'
Removal of the Dark Mark would achieve nothing other than a severed limb, a life changed irrevocably.  It shouldn't be possible to be owned by a dead man, death should have broken that bond.
Draco would never do any of those things.
A cough tore through his body.  He couldn't catch his breath, couldn't move.  He was going to suffocate.  Terror gripped him.  Why wouldn't they let him die?  When would this pain be over?
'You were very good with Draco tonight.  I believe you would make an exceptional healer.'  She decided not to think about the words Harry had just spoken.
'Why Harry?'  Ron asked quietly.  'Out of all the people you could have messed with, why Harry?'
'It's not you.'  Harry told him.
A memory that felt like it belonged to someone else.  Far away and untouchable.  A memory of Harry.
'If...if you want m...me too.'  He couldn't help but cry.  If Harry wished it, Draco would drink.  Knowing full well what was waiting for him in the dark.
He would sneak back into his bed, only emerging when the others woke, pretending that he had indeed spent the night behind his curtains.  Leaving all of the other boys none the wiser to his night-time sojourn.
Touched him, threatened him.  Taunted and laughed at his tears.
Nothing.
'You...you need to go.'  Draco's heart clenched.  Harry wasn't his to keep.
'Nothing worth having ever is.'  Harry replied softly.
'Don't say that.'
'Yes.'  Harry whispered his reply, his gaze never wavering.  'And for me.  I...I would have missed you.'
New blood, fresh blood.
'I know, I'm sorry.  But we have to move.  It will be morning soon.  You'll be warmer in bed.'
And pain.  So much pain.
'Erm, Draco.  Why am I in your bed?'  He felt his face flood with heat.  Draco pressed so close to him.
'Draco...'
All he had was the specters.  Circling his bed, drawing ever closer.
'Spy.'  Nott's eyes glancing back and forth, aware that the room was beginning to fill, knowing that he would have to take his own seat.  'Later, Malfoy.'  He spat, 'You can count on me seeing you later.'  He knocked his arm hard against Draco as he shoved his way passed.
Neville set the water within reach of Harry.  Getting to his knees, he began packing away Draco's only belongings.
'Ssh, I'm sorry.'  Harry's heart twisted, his fingers finding the side of Draco's cheek.  Thumb carefully rubbing over still bruised eyelids.  'I didn't mean to put you through that.  I really am so very sorry.'
'I don't have the time, all right!'  He snapped at her.  'I'm not the important one in all of this.  He is.'
He was drowning.
Not quite nothing.
'What for?'
Draco didn't need to pull anything from the trunk to know that it was all a mess.  He did it anyway.  Stained cloth, wrecked books and crusted parchment lay all around the devastated boy, his legs pulled under him despite the pain.  Nothing mattered anymore.
'Really?'  Draco asked, his voice so full of unexpected hope that Harry felt his eyes prickle, as his blood silently boiled.  How dare they.  How fucking dare they do that to him?
'He almost died.'  Harry told him, his body deflating.  'I'll not see him hurt again.  Do you hear me?'
He wasn't here, a ghost, a presence without form, without a voice.  He had been speaking the truth when he told Harry that he could live with it, it was better than he deserved, than he ever expected.  He stayed in the shadows, mostly confining himself to his bed, the curtains closed.  Harry his only visitor.
'Draco, it's...it's not doing anything.  I thought...'  Her words wrenched his heart.  He heard the bowl being set aside.  Yet another round of pain and hopelessness for nothing. She ran her finger over a particularly deep cut, the knive carving an unrecognisable symbol, it's edges rough, the skin pulled roughly together in its ragged attempt at healing.  'I thought this one might work.'
Touches.
'Where was he in the War, Harry, tell me that?'
Carved from a single piece of oak, stained dark, polished to a high shine, it really was a thing of beauty.  Bought for him by proud parents when his Hogwarts letter had been delivered.  His mother by his side as it was purchased by his father.  Draco full of trepidation at the sight of this mighty sign that his life was finally beginning.  He was a wizard.
He tossed wood onto the fire, banking it up higher, closed the windows and instructed his faithful boarhound to guard the boy while he went to fetch help.
'I...I haven't been sleeping in my bed.'  Harry told him quietly.  'But I can't tell you, Neville.  I'm sorry.  It is not my secret to share.'
Despite it all, Draco almost managed a smile, slipping away into sleep.
'A stupid apology won't ever be enough.  Nothing will ever be enough.'  Milly frowned.  'We will never be a friend to him again, and we don't deserve to be.'
'No.'  Hardly a whisper, blind with pain, numb with panic.  'Wait.'  His bare feet shifting imperceptibly, forcing himself to stay upright, forcing himself not to fall into Harry.  His throat full, vicious tears stinging his dimming eyes, his knees threatening to buckle, ready, waiting to collapse.
'Can you remember any others?'  McGonagall asked, reluctant.
All the blood he had mopped, all the bodies he had helped carry into the Great Hall still sat within his head.  Waiting to reappear whenever he strode through the place he had called home for such a long time.
He had wanted to tell her the truth, wanted her to know that he hadn't even looked for the bottle she needed.  He wanted to tell her what he had seen, what Draco was doing to himself.  But the words would not come.
Like a lot of little boys, he had collected them.  Spent his generous pocket money on the frivolity.  Each one new from the packet, chocolate devoured in moments, the cards a little treasure to be looked over, read and ultimately forgotten, thrown into his bedside draw, waiting for the collection to grow.
'All right, perhaps not right here.'  Harry grinned.  'But...  Somewhere.'
It had been a simple case of pure luck and chance that he had been passing by the staff room yesterday evening.   And such good fortune that he had caught the conversation Professor Sprout and Filch were having, just in the doorway.  Whatever had been said before he happened across them was almost at an end, but still, it was worth paying attention to.  Stepping behind a corner, Nott had listened with growing interest.
'Who's there?'  A voice came out of the darkness, instantly stopping whatever Draco was about to say.  'I said, who's there?'  The voice boomed, growing ever closer to where they stood.
'Don't.'  Harry warned, his hand tightening around Draco's.
He loved him.  Loved him despite the past, the heartbreaking present and the uncertain future.
'What if...'  She tailed off, looking for words that she never thought possible.  'What if it's not that.  What if Harry really does like him, Ron?  What then?'
'Do not allow your doubt, your past to take Draco from you.  Don't ever allow anyone to do that.'  She set her jaw, squeezed his hand tightly, the stoic headmistress once more.  'You fight for him.  And yes, perhaps you will get things wrong, perhaps you both will.  But never stop fighting.  However hard it gets.'
'No.'  He shook his head.  'I want it over.  What...what do you want to know?'
Draco could tell from the distracted way Harry touched him that he was a million miles away.
He grasped it tightly, the glass already biting into his palm.  But Draco didn't notice the slow drip of blood. Over and over he twisted the glass, holding it up to the little light.  How it shone in the room, the one that felt like his Cell.
'Did Ron hurt you?'
'I'm here.'  Was all Harry answered.
Not once, in all the long years of their friendship had Neville been scared of him.  Scared of what he could do, in awe of the raw power he possessed, yes, without a doubt.  But never truly frightened by him.  Right up until tonight, until moments ago.
He knew that name.
His hand reaching out as Draco made himself move through the students.  Closer and closer still.
Hours passed, minutes.  Draco didn't know.  Harry was his world, his safety.  The only thing that Draco wanted.
'You know you have me, Harry.'  Draco squeezed his eyes shut, tears escaping through the tighly closed lids.  'I think in a way you always have.'  He couldn't understand why the words were coming from him now.  He had guarded them closely for so long.  'I...I thought I could be alone, I didn't want to bring someone into the life I had.  I vowed to never do that.  I thought that it would be simple, and it was.  For so long it was.  Until...until I...I was...was...  Until you.'  He stopped, setting aside his book and easing his aching body to the floor.  Harry helping him, touching him.
Days passed with no light, no thought apart from the realisation that thirst would be his end.  He had thought that the torture would take him to his maker, but no.  The lonely act of dehydration would succeed when all other methods had failed.  He accepted it with a weary countenance.  It was better to be alone, to slip away and know no more.
'I don't want to hear any of it.'  Harry slammed his book shut, tossing it to one side, cutting her off before she could utter another word.  Whatever she was going to say would only ever be pointless.  Why did she have to come looking for him?  Why couldn't everyone just leave him be?
'...Dead...'  Someone choked, all other words stolen from her.  A nightmare would follow them into sleep that night.
'This.  Us.'
'Draco...'
Naked and bleeding, dying and thirsty, Draco's faltering words and desperate plees had ground their way into Harry's heart and lodged there, forever.
'Yes.  He brought you here, to his home.'
Harry had helped Draco to the floor, to the rug that lay before the blazing fire, the only source of light in the empty common room.  They sat leaning against the chair at their backs, hips touching.  Glitter caught in Harry's dark hair, like a thousand tiny stars, catching the glow from the dancing flames.  Draco's most favourite thing of his surprising day.
Nott.
Don't you dare!'  Draco was shocked at the very idea, his eyes blown wide.
'Harry...  Ssh.'  Draco's hand fell to the top of Harry's head.  'It's all going to be all right.'  His words sounded foolish, stupid in his ears.  There was nothing he could do, nothing he could say that would help take away Harry's pain.
'We always had the most enormous tree.'  Draco told him, staring into the fire.  He could feel Harry's eyes upon him, watching rapt as Draco told him the tale.  'Mother would never allow anyone to touch it.'  He closed his eyes, remembering.  He could see it now, the tree standing in the drawing room, almost reaching the ceiling.  'People didn't know, but her intricate spell work was truly something to behold.'  Draco continued softly.  'For hours and hours she would sit at the kitchen table, her wand in her hand, creating each and every decoration for that tree, every one made from the thinnest glass.  I could watch her all day.  The concentration on her face.  She was so...so beautiful, Harry.'
He had to get it off, had to bare himself to his Lord.
Harry hadn't moved from the spot Draco left, leaning against the cold stone of the window ledge, gazing out across the grounds.  From this vantage point he could watch Draco as he made his solitary way back to the castle from the edge of the Forbidden Forest.  How long he had stood here, waiting to catch sight of Draco again, Harry couldn't tell.  But his legs had locked into place, and his hands were chilled through from the draft.
She looked upon the dark eyes of the leering wolf.  Already crouched, a straining chain around his thick neck.  Coming closer and closer still.  Exposed and aroused.  Wanting and desperate.  Saliva and unspeakable fluid pooling on the ground as the man creature dragged his lumbering, heavy form closer still.
It was too hard.
At first the idea of taking gratification from male flesh turned his stomach.  He had never given it much thought before, his inclinations didn't fall that way.  But...  This child, this boy, so much like his mother.  Once a pale beauty.  Soft, tempting skin and waves of white blond hair.  Gentle limbs and a stillness that made his body ache in a way he hadn't believed possible.
'You cannot avoid your lesson forever, Potter.'  Professor McGonagall rounded the corner, her eyes falling on Harry in the bright glow of sunlight streaming through the window where he sat in the alcove.  'Soon there will be exams, and where will that leave you?'  She joined him on the stone seat.  'I'm assuming the problem is Mr Malfoy.'
Only...
'He's quit Quidditch.'  Ron said morosely.  'Just quit, like it means nothing.'
Draco understood all to well the problems in having a conversation about himself, let alone asking that much hated question, "How are you?"  Merlin knew he had heard it enough from McGonagall and Madam Pomfrey, and as much as he liked and admired the two witches, that ever present question was always tricky to answer.
Theo was always grinning now.  Greg realised as he looked up from his failing potion and into the face of his Housemate and friend.  For the past few days he had watched as Theo laughed in corners, opened letters at the breakfast table, and had a general air of happiness.  Something that had been lacking of late in the house of the snake.
There was no doubt in his mind that the hands he stared down at, alien and unwelcoming and oddly belonging, would so very easily have squeezed the last dying breath from Nott's unresisting body.
'She has nothing left to try, Harry.  She's finished.'  Draco forced the words out before Harry got the chance to continue.  The stars began to blur with tears.  'I have them forever.  The scars.  They won't go.  I...I don't think they will fade.  She...she said they might, but I know.  I feel it, deep down.  This is the way of it for me.'  His rattling sigh shook his body, the cold creeping into his limbs despite all of Harry's care.
The clock on the wall slowly ticked it's way into the night. The fire crackled and burned, threatened to go out.
Nott's poisonous words a memory, lost among all the others.
'I'm not running away, Milly, I promise you.'  Theo told her, binding Greg's scarf around his bruised and aching throat.  'I will come back, I swear it.  But there is something I need to take care of first.  Something I should have done a long, long time ago.'
'I'm not sure that anyone can.'  Pomfrey told him.
Cold and shivering in soaked clothes that were too big, too thin against the biting breeze that whipped around his wasting body.  His hair still patchy, his skin still as pale as the grave.  New nightmares carving deep lines around his silver eyes and...  And blood.
Rage boiled inside of him, listening to the quiet, heartbreaking sounds Draco was making from under the blankets.  The muffled sobs ripped through his head, burned in his chest.  It was torture for Draco to be picked up, to be carried the short distance to the castle.  But there was no other way.
'It's...  It's okay.'  Draco coughed, 'D...don't cry.'
Tiny writing, so small that he had to screw his eyes up, anything to focus on the swimming letters.  Peering closer, his eyes finally widening when he realised what it was that sat in his lap.
Harry sat on the edge of the bed, finally getting a look at the pale boy.  Shocked at what he saw.
'Forgive me, my boy.  It was wrong of me to ask such a question.'
'I have something here that will help you to sleep.'
'It's too late, Hermione.  I don't need, or want, your apologies.'  Harry began ripping out blades of grass that surrounded him.  He wanted to feel angry, he wanted to lash out, hurt her with words.  The way she had hurt him.  But all he felt was hollow.  What was the point in anger?  In causing her pain?  It wouldn't change anything.  Draco would still be gone.
It hadn't taken the clever boy long to figure it out.  And following the slow caretaker hadn't been hard, and neither had slipping into his office space when the old man had locked it up for the night.
'Waiting for you.'
They were his best friends, and he had kept so much of himself back since the War.  He had too.  He had to be the strong one, it was only to be expected.
'Oh, Harry.'  Draco sighed, leaning against him, overcome.
It wasn't a dream, some deviled fiction of a fevered mind, some glint of a nighttime terror that no spider or snake could compare.
Draco paused, stopped.  His hand rubbing at his face.  And Harry knew instantly that he had been crying, probably still was.
Harry turned to the sound that spilled down to where they still sat, where it continued to rise in pitch, joined by other noises.  Shouting, more screams.  Crying.  McGonagall's hand still keeping him seated.  His stomach lurched.  The War.  The cacophony of the fight, the sobs of the dying.
Madam Pomfrey almost had it right, but Draco still had dreams that shook his nights, made him cry and gasp and cling like a terrified child.
'So what?  How can that be an excuse?  Greg raised his head.  'I was scared, I was too stupid to do the right thing.  I knew they would have thrown me down in the dungeons with him,  I knew it.  And I was too much of a coward to stand up for him.  So...  So I let it happen.'
'Don't go.'  Draco's voice was so soft that he had to strain to hear him.
Draco was always last to leave the classroom.
He wouldn't do it.
He wanted to tell him, wanted to tell him all of it, from the wand on McGonagall's floor, to the words Nott had spat in his face.  He wanted to tell him that his arm ached with a cold fury, throbbing under his pyjamas.  Voldemort's curse had him good tonight.  The knock from Ron had only compounded the pain.
'It's no matter.'  The giant shrugged, finally joining Draco at the fire.  In silence he poured two great mugs of tea, heaping in spoonfulls of sugar.
'There...  There was a Boggart.'  Hermione stepped forward, her hand still clasped tightly within Ron's grip.  'In the cupboard.  'It...  It... became...'  She could no longer speak, turning to Ron, she buried her face into his shoulder.
She knew all his shame, all his body.  It had been her hands that had gotten him into the salted bath, her hands that had washed away the blood between his legs.  She knew what had been done to him, they all did.  How his body had been used.  His stomach clenched at the thought, the little clear soup Pomfrey had gotten into him threatening to reappear.
A bed big enough for him to stretch out, the covers thick and so very warm.  He had his own desk, the wood gleaming with fresh polish, along with a set of quills, ink and parchment, all ready to be used.
'It's okay.'  Draco told him.  'W...what do you need to know?'
She would be there, studious as she ever was.  The hour of the night didn't make a difference when there were exams rapidly approaching.  She was the best, she was going to be so much, determined to achieve everything she set out to do.
Hermione was almost about to turn from the grounds and head back inside the warm castle when a flash of black caught her eye.  She hadn't thought to look along the far wall, had figured that Harry would be sitting under a tree, or soring through the evening air on his broom.
Anything to make that precious moment last.
'Are you okay, Harry?'  Hermione dropped back so she could walk beside him, taking Ron along with her.  'You have been rather quiet recently.'
Draco lay exhausted, his mind stretched to breaking point yet again, his hand carefully held by Harry.  It wasn't enough.  It would never be enough.
'I'm here.'  Warm arms wrapped around him, pulled him in and held on.
Argus Filch was no stranger to early mornings.
'Will it hurt him?  Harry's stomach dropped, surely Draco had already been through too much.
He had been young when he first discovered his mother's secret inclination towards that particular genre.  Father was out for the evening, and Draco already knew better than to ask where.  So it was only his mother that he visited before bed that night.
'I...I can't.'  Draco sobbed, his voice breaking.  'Make...Make it s...stop.'
'I hope one day you can find it in your heart to forgive me, Harry.'  Draco whispered into the gloom that surrounded them.  He could make out the soft flutter of Harry's dark eyelashes against his pale cheek.  Had he always been this pale?  Draco thought, or was this a result of all he had done to the slumbering Harry?
It had been the complete look of betrayal on the faces of the two people he loved that had been the final nail in his cold coffin.
Harry was caught up in reverie and only happened to see a light blazing in the window of Hagrid's hut when he passed one of the many windows on his journey.  Smiling deeply, he finally had a place to head for.  Hagrid was always up for a chat and a cup of tea, whatever the hour.
'Of course.'  Harry called out.  Draco waited for Harry to pull his hand away, to put some distance between them.  He did neither.  Instead of tugging his hand from Draco's, he got up off the wooden chair and sat on the bed, drawing Draco's hand into his lap and cradling it gently.  Like it was the most natural thing in the world.
Harry tugged him back to rest against his warming body, his legs sliding either side of him.  Pressed so tightly together.  Draco could feel his face heat up at the unexpected intimacy of the act.  He stuttered, grasping for words that wouldn't come, for a protest that felt hollow.  He wanted this, more than anything in the world.  How could Harry keep doing this to him?  Make him feel like nothing was more important than just sitting in the dark, his body so very close.
Only, his body refused to listen to his plea.
'I...'  There was that stutter again, Draco couldn't make it stop.  He could feel bile rise up in his throat.  He was going to be sick.  'I'm sorry.'  He would say those words forever.
They were all around him.  Laughing, taunting, wands drawn.  Cruciatus tearing though his weak body.  They held him in it's curse, all the while watching, waiting for him to break.  Waiting for him to cry out and beg for whatever they demanded.
Filch, looking somewhat sorry and unsure.  He knew, Draco realised, the look in his eyes told him all he needed.  His stomach in knots at the thought.  He would have heard, the teachers would have talked amongst themselves about him over their morning coffee, it was only to be expected.  His shame open to them all, even the caretaker.
'You can't make this right, you can't understand it.'  Harry shook his head.  'I told him what happened to you.'
Seen the money fall into Voldemort's own hands, his father willingly parting with coins and gold and anything else worth a damn that he had ever owned.  Brainwashed, perhaps, but nevertheless, it was gone.
He could make a loop, a knot with just enough room to slip his head through, allowing it to rest around his neck.  The hook on the back of the door would suffice.  Just the gentlest of pressures, a slight lean forward.  It wouldn't take much.
All along Draco had been living under the dark cloud of torture, of abandonment and death.  And Harry had been the one, the only one of them all, who had cared enough to help.  And he had destroyed it, destroyed Malfoy with his selfishness.
And Greg had known.
Mrs Norris treading slowly behind.
She had wiped away a fruitless tear as she set quill to paper and addressed a letter to that same baby, now a little boy who was kept in a cupboard.  Knowing full well that she would do nothing to alter his path.
He heard the quiet mutter of Harry's voice, the soft whoosh of flames as the fire was lit with a hasty wave, warmth instantly flooding the room.  He heard the sound of doors closing, sheltering them from the sleeping students.  Harry's footsteps coming back, his hands reaching for him once more.
'Yeah.'  Harry agreed, not moving.
'It's not the only thing that matters, Harry.'
'I don't know how to be.'  Harry admitted, doing his best to stop the rising tide of tears that he knew would overwhelm him.
'Why d..did you stay?'
'Don't touch me.'  Harry warned, ducking away from his oldest friend when Hagrid went to put his huge arm around his shoulders.  He could feel the rage of his magic coursing through his body, threatening to erupt at any provocation.  'I'm not leaving.'
It was a Boggart.
The truth had frightened him, changed everything he thought he already knew.  Surely after that there could be nothing?  It would be better for all concerned if that great revelation was tucked safely away.  It signalled the end to his already young, fractured attempts at a romantic life.
'I'm not going anywhere.'  Harry told him, his feet taking him to the bed.
Harry's dressing gown cord still hung from the Gryffindor red robe.
Hermione was in the Library, no doubt tucked away in some quiet corner, studying, always studying.  Neville had his head down, sitting beside the fire, picking his way through an enormous tome about some plant or another.  Seamus was laughing about something, demanding attention, surely an explosion was imminent?  Even the pale-faced interloper was away.
He would not be like his father.  He would not run.
'Yours too.'  Harry told him, smiling.
The stories...  The hope.
His wand lay forgotten by his side, a reminder of the noise and the destruction Draco had heard in his distant dream.
He had closed his eyes as Draco had walked away.  He hadn't fought for him, he hadn't begged loud enough.  He hadn't looked for his room, or wherever it was he now slept.
'He's so quiet.'  Ron stood, placing several pieces of broken glass on the desk top.
There was a book.  Just a book.
'You weren't.'  Harry shook his head, his fingers tightening.  'And even if you had been, you have more right than most to be angry sometimes, all the time in fact.'
Someone distant, warm and dry and lit by a bright fire.  Burning embers glittering in a mop of ebony hair, green eyes and a taste of home.
'You look exhausted.'  Harry breathed softly, once again reaching up, touching Draco's face with gentle fingers, the soft, crinkled skin around his eyes.  'You are not sleeping.'  It wasn't a question, but still Draco found himself shaking his head.
'I keep fucking it up, don't I?'  Harry had to say, had to know.
'Yes.'  Draco whispered back, his body already unconsciously leaning closer.  'Thank you, for tonight.'  Ever close, his hand lifting, touching that face before him.  'It was perfect.  Would...would you take me out there again?  One night.'
'Now get out of here.'
A dying child.
For weeks he had been watching his childhood friend, waiting for the opportune moment.  When the halls were silent, empty, when there was no possibility of being caught.  It had tried all of his patience, not something he was especially gifted with at the best of times.  But this was important, this needed to be put to rights.
Harry picked up Draco's hand, threading his fingers through Draco's.  Fragile bones shifting under translucent skin.
Dear Harry.
Nott laughed, his breath hot and close, scalding Draco's skin.  'Do you know, if I was that way inclined, I might be temped to see what exactly is the attraction between your legs.'  His hand reached out, closer and closer still.  Until his fingertips grazed the front of Draco's trousers.  'You disgust me.'  Nott sneered, his lips curling.  'What must dear old Daddy think of you now, hey?'  He caressed the buttons of Draco's trousers.  'Slut.'
So cold...  So thirsty... Draco shook himself before the nightmare took hold again, before the dark man extended his hand once more.
Harry tried, he really did, but the cracked whisper from Draco had him in tears.  Again.
The words were remembered, Oliver Twist had now became his own favourite.  But there was something about the way Harry had read this story to him.  He couldn't hope to do the tale justice.  His fingers skimmed across the paper, picking out paragraphs, sentences.  All with the voice of Harry in his head.
Gryffindor was safe.  Yes, they may all hate him.  Loathe him with a passion, but he was still safe.  They didn't torment him, they didn't accuse, threaten.  They ignored.  And right now, that was better than anything.
Harry wished for the return of Christmas.
He wanted to scream at her, wanted nothing more than to shove them all aside.  Return to the castle.  Search for the life he had left behind.
'I have gossip!'  Seamus declared, both of his hands slamming noisily onto the table, making cutlery dance.  'And even you will be interested in this, Hermione.'
'It's okay.'  Draco spoke, a shamed smile touching the corners of his lips.  'I k...know.  I know you were.'  He took Harry's trembling hands into his own and squeezed with what little strength remained left to him.  'No sorry.'
'It is going to be okay.'  Harry's voice, gentle with understanding.
'What?'  Harry snapped out of his reverie, his head whipping up to face his friends.  'Oh, sorry.'
The door had closed behind her, a key was turned in the lock.
'Where did you find it?'  Immediately alert, she rubbed the sleep from her eyes.  'I've been seaching for hours and have had no luck.'
'It's for me too.'  Harry admitted.  'I...I needed some time.'
Harry knew he had gone, long before he opened his eyes, but the wish was still there as he slid his hand across the tiny space.  Praying, hoping for the touch of that warm body he had become so familiar with.  He needed to have Draco smile under his hands, curl himself closer, reassuring him with words that this was all a horrible nightmare.  That he was still here, that he would never leave.
Until Harry.
His broken sobs echoing down the hallway and escaping through the open windows.
'I don't care.'  Harry told him, his hold tightening.  'I don't care about anyone else.'
'Could you tell me?'  She asked gently.  'I know it's hard, Draco.  But it is important.'
'Please, just trust me when I say that I need to be with him.'  He wanted to cry.  It was all too much.
His arm a constant ache, a tightening of the muscle, a fire within.  He wanted to take cold steal to it, wanted to blur the darkness with stripes of blood, parted flesh and ragged skin.  Wanted to cut it out, cut it all away.
And still Harry ran.
'So what if I do?'  Nott snorted,  'He's come back here like he has every right.  Getting himself in with the Gryffindors, stayed in their fucking House, for Merlin's sake.  I bet he has made a play for Potter, he's certainly been spreading himself around.'  Theo sniffed in disgust.  And where are the apologies, hey?  Where are the tears for Vince, or for any of your family?  For anyone?  He's not even said hello to any of you, has he?'  He watched with satisfaction as all eyes were averted.  Malfoy had indeed not acknowledged a single one of them since his surprising return.  He huffed his growing pleasure.  'See, that's exactly what I thought.'
'Lies.'  Spat a boy, a sneer of contempt writ across his twisting features.  Green emblazoned across his chest.  'He wouldn't do that, I know.'  The boy shook his head, resisting the urge to believe all he had seen.  His own family.  His...  His own brother would never do such a thing.  Lies.  All of it lies.
'It's...it's not what you think.'
The dawn of a new day made itself known to the boys in the little hidden room.  The first rays of sunlight inching through the small window, breakfast would be soon.
The man who raised him, dandled him on his lap, sang him to sleep.  Watched as that beloved man bore down on Malfoy, soft words spilling from a smiling mouth as he edged closer.  Wanting to caress pale, cold bruised skin.  Steal his sickening pleasure from the blond child.  Clothes being torn off in haste, his body ready to violate.
His father.
It was there, in the flush of his cheeks, in the warm touch of his shaking hands.  The gently cautious brush of lips against soft skin as they gave in to sleep, murmuring words of goodnight.  This was something more.  Something between them that had no name.  Not then.
'Don't remind me!'
The slightest of whispers brought Madam Pomfrey running.  The room was charmed to pick up any sound of Draco's distress, however small the noise.
'Do you know I once carried Harry out of that same forest.'  His voice was low, a rumbling coming from deep inside his chest where Draco lay his head.  'Damn well broke my heart did that.'  Hagrid sighed at the painful memory.  'But I tell you something now, that turned out all right in the end.'
The feel of the thin body in his arms was too terrible to think about.  His fractured bones, the blood, the little whimper of pain.  It was too much.
If only it could be that simple.
'Ssh, you're not dreaming.  You are safe now.'
After all, some things remained the same.
'I brought you something.'  Harry finally broke the easy silence the pair had fallen into.  He reached over to his chair, his mind finally made up, careful not to jostle Draco too much.  Snatching up the box, he placed it upon Draco's knee.
'No.'  Harry whipped his head around, glaring at the Professor.  'He doesn't belong there.  You...you know what was done to him.  You know what those people did.'  He spat, his hand tightened around Draco's ankle.  'I don't need to remind you.'
'It's Filch.'  Harry spoke, taking in Draco's wide, terrified expression.
'No one will get up.  You need to be by the fire, you are freezing.'  Harry answered Draco's concern before he could fully voice it.  'I've lived with them all for too long, I know what they are like when asleep.  It was usually just me roaming the place while everyone else stayed in their beds.'  He fussed with blankets, drawing them up around their bodies.
'I...I don't think I could.'
'I can't say goodbye.'  Harry breathed, chasing him back, pressing his forehead to Draco's, his hold tight on Draco's hips.  'I can't do it.'
Finally the boy on the floor, soaked in his own urine, shaking and silent.  Finally he had picked.  Decided on the one thing that terrified him more than the rest.  This man creature.  This bleached spector with the curious face and the curling hands.  Bone white wand.  He had a form, he had a voice.
'What happened?'
Mrs Norris padded along in front of him, never straying too far, especially now.  She too had seen the War, had stood over the bodies of the students she had long spied upon.  And Argus was only too aware of the toll it had taken on his beloved cat, his most loyal, and perhaps his only, friend.
'No.  Go...go back, Potter.  I have to do this alone.'
'Harry.'  Draco breathed, his bag falling from his fingers, silently praying that he wouldn't break down.  His heart was racing, pounding so loudly that it was a wonder Harry couldn't hear it from where he stood.  He knew he needed to get away from this place, this moment.  Needed to get as much distance between him and Harry as possible.  This was just too cruel.
'One you cannot wake from.  One made flesh.'  He was over him, reaching, wanting to touch.  That wand...  'Take off your clothes, my prince.  Let me look upon what belongs to me.'
There had been no Muggle books in Draco's childhood.  The Manor was not lacking in literature, far from it.  Reading was plentiful, and Draco had whiled away many an hour in the Manor Library on a cold, lonely holiday.  Certainly no Muggle books were allowed to sully his Father's extensive collection.
'There isn't anything that can help him, Neville.  He's been too badly hurt.'
It wasn't the shadowed speech of his Lord and Master, waiting and wanting in the mouldering darkness.
He could kill him.  After all, he had done it before.  It would be so easy to do it again.
Countless hours of holding him as he sobbed brokenhearted tears in her arms came back to mind.
Lying in wait, hidden behind his long clothes.  Calling out to him when he wanted to sleep, when he dared to close his eyes.  What if McGonagall had it wrong?  What if Dumbledore's notes and untidy scribblings didn't have all the answers to the black spells of Voldemort?  What if cutting was the answer after all?
'Draco...'
'So many...  Look at what I did to you...'  And another, as he turned Draco to face him once more.  His eyes burning, his throat closing.  Over Draco's chest, cutting past his collarbone and curling into his neck.  'How did I not see before?  Draco...'
Hogwarts hadn't been able to give his life the protection he craved.  He had to be the strong one, bold and brash and hard.  It was all an act.  The lonely little boy longed for anonymity, for a place to hide and take shelter from the shadows at home.
What had he become when he stood aside and watched Malfoy walk away?
Ron took a step back, Hermione's imploring eyes burning into his as her bruising fingers let him go, begging him without words to do something, anything to bring this to an end.  But Ron knew he couldn't stop it, just as he knew he couldn't do anything anymore.
Home.
Only pain.
He could remember the feel of her in his arms like it was only yesterday.  Naked, warm.  Soft in all the right places, her body rising and falling in gentle curves.  Flawless skin, sweet perfume.
He sat, uncomfortable and silent with pain on the hard wooden chair that would be easy to clean after the mess he had made of himself.  Piss and vomit and tears.  Sweat and shame soaked into the clothes that clung to him.
Four pairs of eyes looked upon Draco.
'You did it.  You stood up.'  Harry offering what little comfort he could, his fingers moving in gentle rhythm against his cotton covered back.
'Draco...'  Harry felt his world fall apart.
McGonagall sat behind her desk, her sharp eyes focused as Draco stepped into the room.  She wasn't smiling, not tonight.  Her posture tight, upright, waiting, watching him carefully.
Time and potions would have to take care of the rest.
He could picture it now, as clear as the afternoon sunlight that shone through the last of the ebbing rain clouds.  Standing on that vast stairway of the strange and ancient castle, a place he had to think of as his home for the immediate future.  Summoning his courage, his hand had reached out, all that time past.  Wanting to be the brave little boy he always had to play.  Needing to be clever, to be scathing and obnoxious.  It made the anxious fluttering butterflies whirling in his stomach easier to cope with.
'That is way more than one condition.'  He had to smile in the face of Harry's obvious concern, grinning all the more when Harry scowled.  'But yes, okay.  I'll agree to it all.'
'Payback for what?'  Greg had to ask him, an uneasy feeling building in his chest.
'I can't.'  He shook his head, closed his eyes as Harry's warmth, his magic came closer.  'You know can't do that to you anymore, don't make this any harder.'
'There is now.'  Hagrid told him.  'I know this place isn't nice for you, that it can never be more than a bad memory, but...but it's warm here, dry.  If you ever want to just sit and chat, have a cup of tea, you are more than welcome.'
He could do it, of course he could.  One foot in front of the other.
'Run away, you mean?'
'I...I ruin everything.'  He began to sob.  'Look.'  Uncurling his fingers, he pushed the mass into Harry's hands.  Harry held it carefully, not realising at first what it was he was mean to be looking at.  'Letters.'  Draco choked around his tears.  'Fix them.'
'Draco...'  Harry was up on the bed, wrapping his arms around Draco's trembling body.  'Don't ever say that again.'  Harry whispered, a cold fury to his words, his anger barely in check.  He wanted to rage, scream, tear holes in the world.  How dare that excuse for a human do this to him?  How dare anyone?  'You didn't deserve anything.'
'Stalking me now?'  Harry felt his anger rise, felt his hands clench.  Not Neville, why did it have to be Neville?
'You could use it, you know, to go out.  If...if you wanted.'  Harry tried to not let Draco's incredulity get to him, but the instant watering of those silver eyes that turned to him had his chest tightening.  'Only if you wanted to.'
How could she find the words to address them all over the rape and humiliation over a boy?  A young boy she had grown to think of with fondness.  A child she had comforted, read to and watch weep.
The knowledge that once again Harry kept his distance brought unwanted tears to Draco's eyes.  Harry stayed away because of him.  Again.
'You could tell me all about it on the way to Hogsmeade.'  Ron bounced.
'No.  You...you saved me, you...you were kind to me.  Even after all I did to you.'
'It..it's...'  Draco faltered, overcome.  'Thank you.'  He did what would have been unimaginable a year, half a year ago.  Taking Harry's hand in his, he raised it to his mouth, pressing his lips against the skin on the back of Harry's hand.  'You have given me such a lovely day.'  He murmured, not letting go.  'You stayed for me, didn't you?'
Comfort, that was all it was.  Friendship.
She had poured over enormous tomes, flicked through paper thin books, studied scribbled notes, and rifled through aging loose parchment.  And still came up with nothing.  If Albus...  She gave herself pause.  Thinking in that way was a dark path to take, but she had to admit, if Albus had still been alive he might surely know some way to help the boy.  She herself had nothing more to give.
The magic that suddenly filled the room sent a wave of panic crashing into Draco.  So strong that his legs shook where he stood, threatened to buckle.
'The dead will stay that way, Theo.'  Millicent's voice timid, but so sure.  'Revenge is the path to madness.  The past has surely taught you that.'
He should have killed the boy.  Hindsight was a marvelous, absurd thing.  There was no going back, there would be no chance again to draw his wand and cast that terrible spell overflowing with green light and ghastly words.  No chance again to wrap his hands around that tender throat and squeeze the fragile life from the body that was dying anyway.
Draco.  Dying.  Where he couldn't help, couldn't touch him.  Where he didn't know about that dark Cell in which Draco lay, with the festering corpses of his treasured family tucked away into the corner.
Strong arms laid him down, wrapped him up in layers of warmth.  Draco allowed himself to sink into the dream, because what else could it truly be?  There was no help for someone like him, someone who didn't deserve this care, this protection.  He was nothing.  The dream swept over him, dragging him down into its beautiful embrace.
'Draco, don't.'  Harry begged, his voice full of tears.
His eyelids were too heavy.  They flickered closed against his will.  The voice in his head pressing against his skull.  Wanting him to sleep, waiting for him to relinquish his hold on this new, beautiful reality that had been granted.
'She loved you more.'
The scars that littered his aching body would not pale, each and every one as pink as the day Madam Pomfrey had applied her burning tincture.
They hadn't thought much of it at first.   There was always someone playing around and yelling with laughter.   The noise little more than the constant background hum to Hogwarts.
Landing took an effort, the gusting wind wanting to keep him in the air, wanted Harry for it's prisoner.  Finally his feet touched firm ground.  Head down against the storm, Harry made his way morosely to the changing rooms.  He couldn't hope to notice that his slow progress across the waterlogged pitch was being watched by a single pair of eyes.  Eyes that had watched him for days now.  Knowing eyes.
'Oh.  I...  Erm...'  He turned, stuttered.  Hagrid had seen him, all of him.  Crying, sobbing, calling out for everything to stop.  Bleeding, dying on his bed, screaming and begging for the boy who lived.  Weeping on that shoulder, clutching Harry.  Hagrid had seen everything.
The only escape was flying.  Harry knew that he couldn't spend the evening in the common room, stifled by chatter and inane gossip.  He wanted Draco.  Only ever Draco.
It was beautiful in its simplicity.  Ten inches of the finest English oak, carved so purely, so delicate that it looked fragile, an impossibility.  Draco could feel the waves of magic emanating from it.  It drew him in, tugged at something deep inside, his feet already moving to where it lay.  Jet black thread so fine, woven into the handle, a random detail of pattern that added to its allure.
Harry murmured, his head rising at the slight noise Draco's padding feet made as he edged closer.  'I...  I was coming back, I promise.  I'm sorry, I just...  Just...'  His voice left him, turning instead to dry sobs as Draco dropped to the floor before him.
'I demand answers, I want reasons and explanations.  But most of all, I want a name.'
'You too, Miss Granger.  To the Great Hall.'  This was no time for polite conversations and sympathy.  Not for the girl.  Not yet.
'No one?'  The question was an innocent one.  But one he could not repeat the answer to.  He glanced up and met deep brown eyes.  Hermione.  It was Hermione.  He had to pray that she wouldn't see his oncoming tears.  Of all the people to see him like this...
A woman and a bowl of water.  The drops escaping over the porcelain edges.  Soon the bowl would be empty.
'Sorry.'  Harry whispered again, allowing the gown to fall into his hands.  'That's better.'  Smiling, he gathered the fabric up, tucked it under his arm.
Harry clung to the memories, the good and the terrible, blind to all that surrounded him.  Blind to all but Draco.
He whipped his glasses off angrily, pressing the delicate lenses against his robe and rubbing them clear.
'She thought Malfoy might have done something Unforgivable to you, mate.'  Ron grinned from behind his girlfriend, dropping cumbersome bags to the floor without a care.
Ron stood, silent with horror at the sight before him.
'It's over, Harry.  It...  It has to be o...over.'  Draco sobbed.  'This...  This is not how things are with us.  It n...never was before.  It can't be now.'
'It's...it's nice.'  Draco turned his attention to the fire, to the heat that always helped his aching limbs.
'This is not your fault.'  McGonagall told him.  'None of us had any reason to suspect that the potion would not work.'
But...  The idea of seeking sanctuary in Hagrid's hut was now unthinkable.  Draco had been there, once.  Dying in that bloody great bed.  His blood staining the sheets, and his own hands.  The smell of desperation, of terror, hanging in the air.  Harry knew he couldn't face those memories with the taste of Draco still on his lips, the feel of him pressed so close.
'Do what you like to me, Ron.  I don't care anymore.  Just leave Draco alone.' Harry sighed, spreading his arms wide, ready to accept any punishment Ron deemed fit.  He was so very tired by it all.  'He hasn't done anything to me, he hasn't got me under a spell.  It's us.  We...  Draco and I are friends.  More than that...  More than anything.'
Round and round and round they went, holding each other, a swirl of tattered skirts and clicking heals.  Skeletal hands reaching out for their son, beckoning him closer, asking him to join in their frightful display despite the clinging chains and the agony.
Professor McGonagall knew the sound of explosions.  She had listened to the echoing silence of the dead, heard the desperate pleas of the dying.  All contained within the walls of the place she called home.
He would always be a murderer.
Perhaps Hagrid would put him up for the night.  He knew the giant would not bombard him with unwanted questions.  He would probably worry, that was a given, but Harry knew Hagrid would respect his need for silence.  And tea.  Lots of tea.
'Watch where you're going, Wesley.'  He laughed at Ron's startled expression.  All in all, it was turning out to be a good morning for the Slytherin boy.
Ron turned to watch Malfoy leave, watched as he stumbled, a pronounced limp making his steps appear difficult.  He had to steady himself against the wall more than once.  It was painful to witness.  He was only in a pair of pyjamas.  His naked feet looked a little blue.  It was only just February, there was still a frost in the air.  Where would he go?  Ron couldn't stop himself from thinking, dressed like that.
'Draco Malfoy is back.'
Would his Mother know him now?  His Father?
'She wouldn't ask me.  He told her I tripped up, fell down the stairs.  I know he felt bad for what he had done.  He bought me new glasses.  I think she realised.'
The castle would never fully recover from all it had bore witness to, its memories living in the very foundations.
Harry's fingers tightened one last time.
Telling Ron and Hermione that there was a book he needed to get from the Library, Harry rushed off.  There was no reason to look back, no reason to believe that Ron and Hermione would think anything odd about his behavior.  He knew that he would not be missed, they had each other.
'Harry?'  Hermione's soft, tentative voice broke through his thoughts, she reached out, touching his arm as he stared at her, the sound of Ron laughing at something Seamus was saying pounded through his aching head.
He had a blanket on his lap, held a book.  Harry didn't need to be near to know what that book was.  A beautiful leather bound, gilt-edged book by a long dead Muggle author.
Nott was still smirking as he shouldered roughly past Ron, almost knocking him into the wall.
Madam Pomfrey and Professor McGonagall each took a side of Hagrid's enormous armchair by the fire.  The healing spells that had been performed over Draco had left the two witches in need of a few hours rest.
'See if you can sleep, Draco.'  McGonagall's voice startled him.  She knew, of course she knew he wasn't sleeping.  She gently touched his arm, bringing tears to his eyes as he parted his lids.  'You can stay here for as long as you need.'  Sitting in what little space remained on the sofa where he lay, she kept her hand on him.  'You will always have a home at Hogwarts, Draco.  I care about your well-being.  I care about you.'
Damn them all.  Every last one.
Draco could hear the water already running, just steps away in the little tiled bathroom tucked into the far corner.  Harry had left the door slightly ajar, and hot steam had begun filling the gap, creeping into the bedroom where he waited on his hard chair.
'It's just chocolate.'  She told him sadly, quite aware of what he must be thinking.  'I am afraid we all learnt our lesson after that night.'
Draco had known, from the very moment he had first held the Chocolate Frog card that showed the face of the boy he used to hate so much.  Known from that moment on that he had fallen for Harry Potter.
The headmistress had really pulled out all the stops in acquiring the best room for him.  She had ensured that he had everything he could possibly want or need within the four cream painted walls that he would now call home.
'You don't have to do anything you don't want to, Draco.'  Harry told him.  'This is entirely up to you.'
Did he know where Draco lay?  Did he know that Voldemort was making sure he saw it all in mindless flashes of red, of consuming fire.  The images disjointed, out of time.  Did he know where Draco curled up on the cold floor, waiting for the endless visits?  Would he have carried him away?  Risked his life for a tantrum throwing, spoilt child?  What use were questions that had never been voiced, it was done, dead and gone and over.  It didn't matter now, Snape was dead, they were all dead.
'I have one of Salazar Slytherin somewhere, I'll find it for you, chuck this one in the bin.'  Disgusted, he tossed the offending card that bore his likeness onto the pile of books that still rested neatly on Draco's table.
Harry pulled him in with a sigh, his hands wrapping around his slight body, taking away the hurt, the words.  Impossibly closer.
'I wish you wouldn't.'  A shy smile touched his eyes.  'But I guess...  I love you too.'
'T...there isn't a right way.'  Draco spoke softly, doing his best to swallow back his tears, his hand finding the soft, dark strands of Harry's hair.  If only his wasted body would allow him to drag the heartsick boy close, crush him to his chest.
'Harry, you are no killer.'  That someone spoke to him again, hurting him as the hand squeezed tighter still.  'Let him go.'
The soft voices penetrated his mind, he even thought he heard his name.
'He already knows.'  Harry blinked, leaning heavily against his friend, managing to draw a little comfort from his tight embrace.  'He had to go, I understand that, especially after the way everyone has treated him.  I just wish...  I wish he had taken me with him.'
Harry would never be able to forget.  He would never forget the feel of Draco in his arms, in his life.  In his bed.  Curled up so closely together.  The missing part of him finally found.
'Don't forgive me, Draco, please, don't.  I sent you back there.'
'Hi.'  Said Harry, pink staining his cheeks  'I thought you might like a little company?'  His voice hopeful.
'Harry...'
Betrayal.  That one word would end his life with Draco.  Would put an end to everything he never knew he needed.  To surrender this strange new friendship would break his heart.  To walk out of this room once and for all, to say goodbye...
The Boggart had been many things in the time allowed to it.
Sold them all to the enemy.  The Malfoy child was treacherous, his own parents disgusted, fled the country under a malstrom of shame and fear.  Why else was the boy in Gryffindor?  Why else was he sharing a room with the Dark Lord's mortal enemy?
Pure and powerful, and above all else, unforgiving.
Draco had been stolen by the dark magic of a madman and spat back out.  Claimed with it, and ultimately broken by it.
He had to pull himself together and get back to Draco before the whispering shadows tried to claw him back.
Walking over to the window, he threw it open, the welcome burst of fresh morning air hitting his face, washing away the worst of the night.  The long, lonely night.  Hours spent watching Draco not sleeping, worried sick when he couldn't free him from the stupor the memories had caused.  The vacant eyes, the random babble that spilled from his mouth.  Harry was terrified of losing him.
Him.  It was him.
Hermione had tried to talk to him over his uneaten plate of food, she had touched his arm, and he knew from the look in her big, sad eyes, that she was going to try and get through to him.  An inane babble of questions over his whereabouts, or why he wasn't eating.  Or why couldn't he talk to her?  He didn't want her sympathy, or her attempts at understanding.  He didn't want Ron looking over at him from under his hooded eyes, wanting to ask questions of his own.
'The angels were always my favourite.  It would take her so much time to make each one.  She would spin the glass from her wand, heating it gently, guiding it with her fingers.  I...I stole one.  Went down late at night and just plucked it from the tree.  Mother knew instantly.  She didn't tell me off, she only told me to put it back.  I did as she asked, but I so wanted it.'  He smiled sadly at the memory, leaning heavily into Harry's side, taking strength from him.  'No more was said about it.  After Christmas the tree was taken down, and all the decorations wrapped up and put away for the following year.  I guess I put it from my mind.  But...but my mother didn't.  I found it, in my trunk on the first day back.  She gave it to me, Harry.  She knew I loved it so much that I was willing to steal it from her.  To take what she had loved.'
Harry had discovered it.
Mother crying in the corner, Father silent with horror.  Watching as Draco was reduced to nothing.  A toy to be used, a plaything to torture.
Magic.  Harry was trying to protect him from his magic.
And Harry.  Of course Harry.  He would be waiting for him.  Not able to show it, that was out of the question.  But Draco knew that Harry would raise his head, look as he entered, his emerald eyes watching, just to see if he was all right.
The thing crashed from dark robes and glimmering silver masks.  Wands spilling light and whips soaked in blood.
'Leave us alone.'  Harry snapped, his voice containing more power than she had been expecting.  'Can't you see it's too much?'  He twisted his body away from her, drawing Draco closer.
Had to make sure the boy paid for what he had done.
The first time was with Ron, in his little bedroom back at The Burrow.  Ron had snored, and Harry had hardly slept, but anything was better than being at Privet Drive.
'I would love that.'  Harry took the book, opening the cover.  'Happy Christmas, Draco.'
'Draco...  Please.'
Crying.  Always crying.
'It's okay.'  Was Harry's only reply.
'And if it is?'
'Don't you ever, ever say that word again.  Not about him.  Not ever.'  His voice low, dangerous.  'You want to know where he was?  Do you really want to do this?'  Harry pushing his face close, fury flashing in his emerald eyes.  A darkness consuming him.  'He was bleeding on the floor of a filthy dungeon after being tortured and gang raped and left for dead by Voldemort and his cohorts.  That's where he was, Neville.  That's where he has always been.'
It meant that Draco, however tired he might be, had to endure the journey with only Potter as his aid.
It was for the best.
A naked boy who had been tortured, starved, beaten, raped and left to die in the forest.  A Draco who had cried, sobbed and screamed for the agony to stop.  A Draco who had allowed him to drip water onto his poor lips, desperate for a few drops of liquid.
Despite all that he fought against it, Harry had become his world, it was useless to pretend otherwise.
'What are you even doing here, Malfoy?  No one wants you here, no one even likes you!'  Finally Ron had someone worthy to vent his anger upon.  'Why don't you crawl back under the rock you came from, bastard.  You might find your parents there waiting for you.' He snapped, cruel, vicious.  It wasn't like him, he wasn't this spiteful person.  But...But why Malfoy?  Why was he here when so many were not?
So many people had bore witness to his memories, to the people that haunted his nights and crept into his waking hours.  The Wolf.  The man with the words.  Aunt Bella and her water bowl.  His...  His parents...  And Him.  They had all seen Him.  Draco couldn't stop the whimper that escaped his throat.
'We can't get it back, Ron.'  She said.  'It's gone, it can't come back, it can't ever be as it was.  We are not those children anymore.'  She sighed softly as Ron's face crumbled, her words striking home.  She was right, she was always right.  'We will never have that feeling of pure joy, of the excitement of seeing Hogwarts for the first time.'  Her heart aching for all that they had lost.  'It's gone forever.'
'All I wanted was a night.  Is that too much to ask for?  Just one night?'  He raised his hands, brought them slapping down to his sides.  'Why can't things stay the same?  Why not?'  He could feel his growing tears.  This was not what he wanted.
Oliver Twist.
'Draco.'  Harry stopped instantly, his head rising from the ground to lock his gaze upon those silver eyes he was afraid he would never look into again.
'Are you quite sure about that, Potter?'  She rasied an eyebrow.  'Madam Pomfrey has informed me that you spend your lunch hours sitting with Mr. Malfoy.'  Harry remained silent, resolutely not making eye contact.  'You need to look after yourself, Harry.'
'I...I lied to him.  I made him drink.'  Harry's voice broke.
'So pretty.'
Draco nodded slightly.  Whatever Potter had brought, whatever that thing was, it appeared innocuous enough.  Harry lifted up a corner of Draco's covers, his hand shaking.  This was Malfoy, his brain reminded him.  They didn't do this, they were not like this.  He ignored the thought, sliding the bottle beside Draco's trembling legs.
'The poor boy cannot take anymore.  We have done all we can for now.'  The nurse knew that Draco was in need of much more healing, but that would prove Harry right, they would be killing him.
'No...'  His voice cracked.  Snape...  No.  It was horrible, those words, that face before him.
'Tell that to my Father.'  Draco whispered, his anger drifting away to empty sadness.
Draco picked up the parcel shyly, wanting to believe the reason behind his warmed cheeks was the fire.
Or he could vanish, disappear to someplace where he wouldn't be known.  Surely there would be be somewhere that wouldn't recognise the stark blond hair of a Malfoy.  Find shelter, a roof over his head.
Neville knew that he had no longer had a choice, he would have to confront Harry.  Had to know if Ginny was the reason he no longer slept in his own bed.  Was he still seeing her?  Was she cheating on Dean?
'I don't know where that is.'  Harry told her, confusion briefly flashing through his darkened eyes.  The boy looked exhausted.  Wherever it was they chose, she was going to ensure they had hot food to eat, and more than a sip from a shared water glass.
'It's okay.'  Harry's hands tugging at him.  'Come on, sit over there.'  He got him to an alcove, a stone seat.  'Stay there, don't move, don't say anything.'  He drew the hood of the gown up, covering Draco's head.
It was only a second, a blink of opportunity, but Harry's attention was drawn briefly away from the man under his aching grip.  That second allowed Theo a desperate gulp of air, his throat convulsing under Harry's fingers as that breath filtered into his burning lungs. The darkness wasn't quite yet complete, he had been given another chance.
Ginny.  It was with Ginny.  But the lest said about that the better.
'Just shut up.'  Harry sighed, his fury draining away to crushing sadness.  'You'll get what you want, Neville.  He won't want me near after I tell him what I've done.'
He was nothing.
There could only be one thought left to him now.
They were torturing him.
Ron wanted to run.  Tuck himself away in the Gryffindor bedroom, hide under the covers of his safe little bed with his hands pressed tightly over his ears and stay right there.
'Please...'  The child begged.
'What kind of something?'  She eyes him warily.
Of course, it was Saturday.  Harry realised suddenly.  Saturday.  And a much discussed trip into Hogsmeade.  They had talked about little else in the lead up to returning to school.  And now he couldn't go.  No, not couldn't, Harry thought.  Didn't want to.  He wanted, needed, to be elsewhere.  He would have to lie.  Again.
He heard the soft scrape of Harry's wand being drawn from the mantel, where Neville had carefully placed it earlier.
'Make them stop.'  Draco begged.  'I'll...I'll do anything you want, just make them stop.'
Ron could feel his eyes burning, the bitter sting of unshed tears that he didn't deserve.  How dare he?  How dare he feel the shame, the act of his own cruelty, the guilt?  Malfoy...  Draco had been hurting himself, ready to hack into his own flesh, and all he had done in answer was put his head down and walk away.  What kind of man, what kind of monster did that make him?
'Cruciatus.'  Draco told them.  'He...He was fond of that.'  His breath quickened at the memory.  'He liked to make m...me scream.'
Shuffling footsteps shook him from his torturous thoughts.  Someone was heading in his direction.  Glancing around quickly for a fast place to hide, Draco willed his heavy feet to move from where he still stood, his eyes landing on a hidden alcove, a hanging tapestry beside it would provide further solitude.   If only he could get there in time.  Ideas of Nott, looking to continue his unspeakable tirade flashed through his foggy head.
Coming to a quick decision, he held out his arm for the boy to either ignore, or take.  The offer was there whatever he chose.
'I wish I could help, I wish I could take it all away from you.  It's not right, what's happening.'
'Never sorry.'  Harry told him, 'We promised.'  He pressed his lips to Draco's sweat damp forehead.  'I missed you too much for sorry's.'
And Him.
'You have a plan.'  Madam Pomfrey grinned, her head tilting.  'I know you too well, Minerva.'
His best friend.
'And where should I be?'  Harry didn't wait for Draco to reply.  Tired, emotional, raw.  Harry needing this closeness as much as Draco right now.  'You promised me, Draco.  You promised that you wouldn't push me away.'  His voice harsher than he intended.
'No.  Leave...leave me.'
His hopes for a quiet moment with Draco were however dashed when upon opening the door to his tiny bedroom, his eyes lit on Professor Slughorn, sitting in his chair.  His hands folded upon his lap, he was chatting animatedly to a very tearful Draco.  Harry immediately felt his blood begin to boil.
'I want you.  I only ever want you.'  Harry whispered, his face turning in Draco's soft hand.  His lips pressing to his palm.  He shuddered, the cold of the night, the lingering shock of the evening leaching the fight, the last of the warmth from his body.
Harry?
Draco would surely hate him after tonight.  He had trusted him, shown Harry that there was more to the world other than magic.  It wasn't everything, it wasn't even that important.  Not when you sat through the night with someone, simply holding their hand and reading in the quiet.
'If I am not allowed to say that, then you musn't either.'  A ghost of a smile, a flicker of that silver again, a twitch of his hand resting on the curve of Harry's hip deep under the blankets.
'No, no, it was...it was...'  Draco felt his eyes sting.  Fighting to hold back tears that would never be over, he reached up, cupped Harry's worried face.  'How do you do it, Harry?  How do you make me believe that everything is going to be okay?
'I'm sorry.'
It would be almost effortless to do it again, tighten his grip just that little bit more, crush the Slytherin's windpipe.  Twist his hand to the right, break his fragile neck.  He would die easily then.  So very quickly.
'That...That dark place.'  Draco whispered, all of his attention fixed on Harry.  'When I close my eyes...'
'No, absolutely.'  She nodded, throwing her door wide to allow Draco inside.
'You are?  Why?'  Harry frowned at the boy watching him.
Let them take it all.
Blood welled up at the tip of the glass.  A single bead that grew under the press of the pretty blue fragment.
'Draco, what's wrong?'  Harry asked him slowly.  'Did Madam Pomfrey hurt you?'
'No.  No, it's not.  You are right.'  Professor McGonagall shook her head.  'Do...'  She paused, not wanting the answer to what she knew she had to ask.  'Do you and Draco wish to leave Hogwarts?  I can find you somewhere.  Somewhere far away from here.'
'Yes.  I am afraid that Harry will have to face some tough questions if he is to stay by Draco's side in all of this.'
'You are being too hard on yourself, Harry.'  Draco spoke kindly, understanding.  'I think you are forgetting that you had other, far more pressing concerns at the time.'  He huffed out a laugh.  'Your love life was not important.'
'Best I be getting back to my bucket and mop, some brat has flooded that toilet again.'  He rolled his eyes in exasperation before venturing off down the darkened corridor once again, the shadows swallowing his retreating figure.
'You cannot know that.'  Harry closed his eyes, too afraid to meet Draco's gaze.  Too afraid of what he saw reflected back at him.
He would never be able to right the wrong in letting the child live, his wish of freedom slipping through his fingers.
'No!'  The thought filled him with sickness.  I'd never...  No.  He's...he's not touching it.  It's evil.  I'd not let him touch something so foul.'
All he needed to do was steal it, stash it away in the broom cupboard at his back, and wait.
'Did your aunt ask you what happened?'
All he wanted was to be left alone.
But there was one book he placed carefully inside his bag.  One that he would treasure above all others.
'Harry?'  He asked, his twisted fingers finding purchase on soft wool.
'Too hard to talk to me?  Best friends, Harry.  Bloody Hell.'  He turned his back.  'Why?  Why have you quit the team?  Why now?'
'They are all dead now.'  Theo glanced around the corridor, the crowds had thinned out, just a few clueless stragglers now headed up to the Great Hall.  'Almost all.'
He tried to control his racing heart, half afraid that she would be able to hear it in the quiet room, pounding against his ribcage.  He didn't attempt to find his voice, didn't ask a question.  He already knew what lay in wait inside of that plain, dark box, not befitting the power it contained.  It deserved more, Draco knew that, as much as he loathed it.
He had already lost so much, he couldn't bear the thought that this too would come to harm.
'I don't want to put him through any more pain, Harry.  It is not necessary for him to feel a thing.'
The weight of carrying Draco's secret was heavy on his shoulders.  The long nights spent by his side were taking their toll, and it was beginning to show.
'You t...told me.'  Draco coughed, the words sticking in his throat.  Upset at Harry's tale.
He was used to being silent, his slippered feet made no noise as he wandered the halls, not seeing a single soul.  Even the school spirits were absent.  The castle was his alone.
It was when Draco had sobbed out his name, crusting blood trapped underneath his broken fingernails, hair torn out in vicious handfuls.  Lips cracked and bleeding.  Pain and fear writ over his sallow features, Madam Pomfrey and her burning potion, her relentless fingers rubbing it deeply into Draco's open, infected body.
When the silence fell and he was given a brief reprieve, he could picture her, sitting up in her luxurious bed.  Surrounded by the best that power, money and fear could buy.
Mummy and Daddy...  His memories forced him from the hut and into darkness.
'Are you sure you don't want Harry in here for this?'  She turned to him, apprehension in her worn features.   She was showing her age, Draco realised.  Her grey hair twisted up into a messy bun, held off her lined face with a tight black band.  The years were passing for them all.
Harry brought him back.
He could slip a shining knife into his pocket during Potions.  No one would know.  Just tuck it carefully away, think about it later.
That pretty blue glass pressed into his thigh, all the viciously sharp edges digging through the cotton of his piss soaked, stinking trousers.  Draco could feel the way it wanted to cut into him, the way Harry's own leg was so close to his dirty little secret.
Harry had never seen it with his own eyes.
He did it again, and again, and again.  Lost in the feel of Harry gently encircling him, his hand warm and soothing on his stomach, fingers so close to the buttons that covered his skin.  To have that hand slip inside...  To have Harry touch him.
'What on earth happened to him, Minerva?  He is in a right state.'
Draco reasoned that water from a bubbling pot would work better, but he had no means to do this.  An open flame in this room?  With his nagging nightmares and shaking hands?  Surely that would only pave the way to disaster.
'Found him in the corridors.'  Filch stood before her, doing his level best to not glance at her attire, his hands on Draco's shoulders.  'I'd say he needs warming up.'
'They were wrong.'  Anger sparking off his skin, crackling the air around them.  'So fucking wrong.'
'So why?'  Ron asked again, desperate for an answer to the question that had plagued him since witnessing their shocking kiss.  'I know you can tell me, I know you, Malfoy.  I've always known about you.'  He didn't stop the sneer that coloured his voice.  So what if Malfoy looked sick?  So bloody what if he was upset.  The blond bastard was trying to ruin Harry's life, again.  He couldn't stand idly by and allow that to happen.  He had to protect Harry if he wasn't going to do it for himself.
'Harry...'  Draco got out, his voice high and stricken.  'I...I can't...'  He couldn't move, frozen with fear.
It fell open in his own shaking hands, the noise and the shouts fading into nothingness as the pages parted, just where a bookmark held its place.  Only it wasn't just a simple bookmark of paper and stitching.
Her fur came out in clumps now whenever he took it on himself to groom her, her once sharp eyes cloudy with age.  She slept more, they both did.  Age was calling to them, and sometimes he felt like he was only too eager to rush towards it.
'Come on, lad.'  He spoke, bringing to an end the pain of watching the boy stammer for a suitable answer.  Let's get you to Professor McGonagall.  She'll look after you.'
'You lie.  You brought this upon yourself.  Your parents dance because of you, they died because of you.'  A sickening grin, a wet touch of a tongue against his cheek.  'I can make them do so much more.  What would you like to see them do?'
His body lying taut, the crackling wand being drawn over his aching flesh with a static touch, tiny licks of a blue curse, unknown to him, but so very real against his paralysed prone form.
They would share sweets again, wouldn't they?  Harry would take pity over his tight ball of mangled corned beef sandwiches and spend his pocket full of gold on treats from them to eat in their solitary carriage.  Harry would show him his scar once again, and watch, rapt as Ron tried to turn his pet yellow with a clearing of his throat and a borrowed spell.
He loved him.
One across his hollow stomach.  Slicing its way through a delicate dusting of white blond hair.  And another.  This one snaking its way under a livid red wound, one that would never truly heal.  Long and low against his hip, its path skirting over his protruding bones, up and around the base of his spine as Harry turned him, pressing his hands to urge him around.  All the better to look at the past of his tortures.
He could already feel the chill of the covers against his legs as he climbed his way into bed.  He wouldn't sleep, he wouldn't.  But still the lure of comfort, the soft pillows at his back, the heavy fullness of the duvet, all called out to him.  And pulling a tome of Ancient Runes onto his thighs, he began to read.
Her hollow apology made Harry seethe, his body instantly tense.  And if it wasn't for the simple fact that Draco still leaned weakly against him, his breathing stuttered and slow, he would have raged his fury at her.  Banged upon the closed door, demanding reasons and answers.
'Draco...'  Harry felt the cold hard ball of dread forming in his stomach.  He knew instantly what had happened. The heavily stained clothes, the mess of paper and parchment, the small bundle of squares in Draco's lap with a red ribbon staining through them all, the smell in the air.  The empty shampoo bottle at Draco's feet.
Harry shook his head, wanting nothing more than to be rid of the sight that haunted his own dreams.
'You are safe now.  You are home.'  Harry's words were laced with fear as he spoke through the fog that surrounded him.
Harry scrubbed his hands furiously over his face, surprised to see them come back bloody.  Dark and dry crusted flakes flecked his palms.  He didn't remember hurting himself.  Looking down in his otherwise empty hands, he was shocked to notice them shaking.  When had that started?  Was he always shaking?  Hot tears rose up from his chest, burning a path to his eyes before spilling over and began coursing down his filthy face.
He wasn't all right, not this time, and Draco knew that he wouldn't be able to hide it.  Harry would be able to see the drying tears that ached to reappear, the shaking that never left.  And later he would ask.  They would be alone.  Harry would hold his hand, whisper that it was okay, that he was listening.
'I have no doubt that each and every one of you is aware of all that occurred today, within this very castle.'  Her eyes raked through the students and teachers alike.  'I would like to tell you all that what you saw, or indeed heard about through mindless tattle is untrue.  That it was a trick, a stupid prank, an imagination of the most terrible kind.'
Harry's own nightmare, sobbing on the floor.  Back carved into dark stripes of rotting infection.  Shaking shoulders and a whimper.  A dying boy, trapped in a body that was no longer his own.  He would never shake that image, it would mercilessly haunt his dreams, touch his daylight.  The boy he loved lying before him.
'Greyback.  It was Greyback.'  Sobbed a child, his hand reaching out for a friend, anyone who could erase that lascivious grin.
'He will kill you, Theo.'  Milly pleaded.  'Look at him!'
His feet wouldn't cooperate, refusing to move from the stone step.
'I want to look after you.  Always.  Forever.'
'What?'  Nott barked, sliding back into the chair he had left only moments ago, his eyes already raking around the table.
Harry didn't blame him, not one bit.  If it had been months ago, he would be revelling in the same gossip, wanting to know everything about the boy from Slythrin who they all presumed had vanished in cowardice with his fated parents, or even dead.  It had no real consequence for any of them.
'What happens now?'  Harry asked her quietly.  'I want to help him, but I don't know how to.'
Where would he go?
'You let me.'  Harry whispered.  'You let me touch you.  You let me look at you.'
'It's okay, now Draco.  You are safe here.'  The face of the woman came into view, a soft, caring face.  One that had looked after him before. It was Madam Pomfrey holding out the water.  'You are back at Hogwarts.'
After all, it was only a piece of broken glass.
'Hey, you have nothing to be sorry for.  Don't ever think you have to say that to me.'
He was so thirsty.
He knew she loved the dark haired boy like a son.  She had watched him grow, she had been the one to stand up for him when no one else had given a though to it.  She had seen through the Saviour moniker, had seen the frightened little boy underneath it all.
'No.'  She shook her head.
'I'm going to put you to sleep now, Draco.'  Madam Pomfrey spoke to him, holding out the tiny bottle, inky black against the light from the window.
