He sat on the rocking chair and stared at his sleeping son, He was so adorable with Rosy cheeks and messy hair.
First slap came with a familiar rush of pain and then pleasure,
"Oh no, Mimosa is being here now. Masters can sleep. Mimosa can be staying awake." She Replied excitedly whispering.
His master asked him about his day and he told him how he had finished the potion order he had received the previous week and had ordered a new batch of ingredients before cooking dinner.
"Now I'm going to spank you 17 times for last 17 days of your unruly behaviour and then 3 times because of today's naughtiness." His master said in a husky voice which he hadn't been able to detect earlier.
Harry honestly wasn't ignoring his pet from last few weeks, He was just so tired all the time after waking multiple times in night because of Jamie's cries. Even when Draco tried to pacify their son instantly, harry had already woken up by then. Draco hadn't been any better. Getting Moodier and crankier. Today's Initiative was a bit of the surprise.
He slipped something cold in his ring finger and Draco couldn't think about anything in his mind,
"Hmm, I've been yours for a long time my lovely, it was you who was running away at every drop of sickle, I won't be bringing anyone to my bed other than you till the last day you're alive my love. Happy?" His master's amused and love filled sleepy tone entered his ears,
"One, Thankyou master" he cried out
He felt his feet being lifted and then felt another padded chair under them. His master removed him black heels and caressed his feet a little. He felt himself relaxing unconsciously. His master loved him. He could take everything his master dish out.
He braced himself and replied with Meek answering Meows. He had lost count and hoped his master didn't ask for how much were left.
He asked for color and got only a meow in reply. Draco was gone too deep under to consent any longer.
Their relationship had blossomed in last 9 months, Draco losing a bit of his submissiveness as he grew heavy with their child and becoming whiny and demanding like he was before.
Harry had learned to adjust, else in danger of facing a face full of whatever Draco can get his hands on. Usually a pillow, as harry had became overprotective and confined his husband to bed in last few months, who had than started to rebel. Harry couldn't punish his Pregnant Partner even if he became annoyed with Draco's behaviour and learnt to control his temper and itching hands, often smacking lightly on Draco thigh in warning.
"Color pet?" His master asked.
He came out of his thoughts as he heard Mimosa entering the room and settled Jamie in his crib. He pointed at the transfigured bed for Mimosa and she silently nodded.
His master never sent him away, there was no use. He had nothing, not even clothes on his back were his own, everything his family used to own was his new master's property.
As the door opened, he got to see slack jaw reaction of his master as soon as he was noticed.
He would need to dress up, maybe he can plead to his lord to wear female dress robes. he had many dress robes in feminine cut and if how his lord licked his lips when he saw him in them was any indication he might get permission to wear them at the dinner.
"Are you ready my dear?" his master asked softly, asking about his decision for the conversation which had happened a week ago.
Great! Now he was angry while his master was angry. Not a good combination.
"Well, Now you're Officially Draco Harry Potter, My wedded husband from now to eternity, Mine." His master said with love filled voice, as it couldn't be anything else.
"Sleep love, I'll get Jamie cleaned and fed." He ordered Draco gently, mindful of company.
"kneel" His lord commanded, and a shiver ran through Draco's body. he fell on his knees instantly knowing his lord was in mood to play tonight.
Another Two in succession on same spot on Upper thigh.
His back was flushed to the front of his lord's broad chest and his hair was in his lord's hands.
He had followed his new master to his home, ranted and raved at one thing or another till his master finally got annoyed at him and claimed him fully as his slave, his brood-mare. He was fed a contraption potion and then left alone to sulk.
His master nodded and banished all the dirty dishes to the sink.
"Umm, it's nothing much master. I mean My lord Husband, ignore it." He deflected, he didn't want to ruin this lovely moment with his useless questions. He was happy that his master had graced him with his name and ring. And a child of his very own in very near future as well.
He saw the elf Mimosa reading to Jamie from one of the nursery tale in the books kept on bedside table.
He was always ticklish on his belly,
"My darling brave kitty. Taking his punishment so well."
"Well, look how horny my bitch is for me." his master whispered, he was now wearing a plain white t-shirt and a blue ripped jeans, commando. Draco was forced to see his master change his clothes while he was struck in his Position.
Draco was glowing during and after his pregnancy. He was never able to gain his pre-war body with losing so much weight during those years, but now his husband looked sexy with his body filled with some mass and some grab-able curves present. He would need to ask Mimosa to regulate Draco's diet. Draco liked skipping meals when he was too busy or was pouting for some reason or other.
They fucked like animals for a long while and then harry grabbed his erect cock with the hand which was previously in his vagina.
"Just give it to me husband. Please fuck me." He screamed at harry and was thankful that he had remembered to Silence nursery's entrance in evening before His lord came home.
"Thankyou mimosa, You did good. Now Can you watch Jamie tonight whenever he wakes up, Draco is down for night and he hadn't had a proper night of rest in months. I can transfigure something for you to lay down here."
He could even taste his own precum while sucking the foot and feel his saliva on his cock where his master was playing with it.
His master was right to treat him like this. He had been very uncooperative from last many weeks. He seriously loved his little snitch but Jamie was just so tiring and restless. He kept him awake at all the random hours. He suspected that his master probably took a nap at his office. He wasn't that lucky.
He set 2 place settings and stood as his master served himself.
He moaned without trying to control himself, he had never felt this sensation before, and now he was feeling a very different pleasure than getting fucked in his ass. No wonder his master liked using females, He would take sex change potion all the time if his master wanted so.
He screamed. He felt his eyes swelling with tears now but then he heard his master's voice and felt himself relaxing a bit.
He could stare at his lovely for hours and hours without tiring.
As clock struck 7, His master stood and streched. His muscles bulging under the fitted white formal shirt he was wearing and Draco could feel his own drool on his chest as he looked at his master.
He took a cold shower to wash the day off him and slid beside his husband.
Molly had gifted him a first part of a Book of complied articles written by her. Who knew Molly Weasley was a column writer for witch weekly, Well apparantly no one except her husband knew about her profession.
"Dinner can wait my pet, I'd rather first have you as dessert." They have moved into the living room, where fire was lit in the huge fireplace which dominated the room.
Well if that was how master was going to be today.
"Three, Thankyou master, please more" He said in a pleading voice, requesting his master to fully use him as was his intended purpose.
His lovely kitten took everything and then he felt Draco's body going slack only after 15 spanks.
And he was right, after a few minutes his felt his husband caressing his hair. He increased the intensity of his sucking and hollowed out his cheeks taking him down his throat.
"What do you think the Baby would be? A boy or girl." he asked aloud, wonder clear in his voice.
"None of that love, come up here." His husband said and held out his arms.
He said in low voice, looking around searching for something appropriate to transfigure. Many of the furniture here was gift from his adopted family and Potter family heirlooms.
His leash was dropped as soon as they crossed the threshold and the door was closed.
He didn't enter the room and just looked them from threshold and smiled at the picture they made. He was reminded of his own nanny elf. Honey used to read and sing to him whenever he woke up in night to make him sleep.
After a few minutes of cleaning he felt Draco stirring a bit. He had closed his eyes sometime ago, when they were climbing the stairs and now his eyes looked very hazy half opened.
Rest of the spanking went into a haze. He felt himself slipping deeper into the sub space and just Meowing whenever he felt pain.
"You did well pet, don't worry, shhh My lovely dragon" His master's soothing voice reached him through a fog, a fog he experienced just a few times in previous years.
Ginny scoffed. "Whatever." She laced her fingers together with Luna's. "Come, Luna, let's go to my room."
Harry blushed. Maybe his feelings for Draco were a little stronger than he had initially thought they were. Maybe he liked it.
"Did you just call me Draco?" 'Oh fuck' Harry thought to himself. 'Oh fuck fuck fuck fuck.' Why did he have to say that? It's just Malfoy. He probably thinks he's being all soft and stupid right now.
Why did he, of all people, have to do this.
"You are bringing the entire operation in danger, Draco."
"What?"
'No, not gonna say it now.' Draco teased.
Besides, there was something about seeing Harry sleep in his childhood bed that made him feel contented. Some sort of verification that he had accepted every part of him, even the stuck up prejudiced part of from when he was younger.
“I'm friends with Harry-freaking-Potter.”
But he couldn't hug Harry Potter. Right? They're enemies. It's weird to hug him. Eventhough Draco wanted it more than anything.
Harry hated seeing Draco so sad, but he couldn't help the smile forming on his face as he smelled his hair.
"Yeah yeah, quit the act Potter. I know about you and Draco."
"Yes, of course. I mean, some of the elderly family members are close minded, but I don't think there's ever been actual trouble or something."
Harry clenched his teeth and nodded. "Yeah, I mean. I sort of already figured that out..."
Draco felt a shiver run down his spine. He knew the consequences. He was reminded of them every time he took off his shirt.
The footsteps on the map stood still in the boy's bathroom, not in one of the stalls, but at the sink. Harry watched them for a minute but they still hadn't moved.
"He's not my b-"
Narcissa stood up and turned towards Voldemort en his followers.
"Honestly your my last resort, Potter." She said while biting her thumb nail, panic rising in her voice. "I don't know what to do. I've tried everything. Talking to him, keeping my distance, letting Blaise talk to him. He won't talk. He barely eats."
He wanted to tell them about everything Dumbledore showed him, but he couldn't.
Maybe it’s not all just fun and games.
"Leave it," he smiled, "I like looking at you."
Fire, everywhere. Pure chaos. He didn't know what to do.
They stared at each other.
“Draco?”
Harry made his way towards Draco, their eyes locked.
"Why, do you have surprise planned?" He said with a wink.
"We're not together. We only kissed once. That's it."
'Something about the fact that it was strawberry flavoured and pink should have warned you.' Draco grinned.
"D? Who is D?"
Goyle ran away and Draco got up. He looked at Harry.
He made his way to them, Voldemort smiled at him.
Had he grabbed it on purpose? Or was it jus due to his anger last night?
He probably would. Maybe their relationship would have been less... complicated.
'But I want to change. I want to do something good with my life, I want to do something good for the world. I just don't know what. Or how.'
After apparating in an alley, he walked a few minutes and arrived at a pub.
He kissed his head. "Do you wanna go somewhere? Somewhere a bit more... private?"
"Hey" Draco looked around the room: there was a crackling fire to his right with a tapestry in front of it, the couch Harry was sitting on, and to his left a big bed with throw pillows.
After living in a closet for 10 years, Harry got claustrophobia. It was bad. Only Ron and Hermione knew. He was forced to tell them after he had a panic attack when he got stuck at the Burrow.
Harry looked at him, hurt in his eyes. Hope, fear. His lips moved, almost unnoticeably, "Draco" he mouthed.
"I'll... I'll see you in the hall, okay? I need to do something." Harry told Ron. He nodded and walked away.
It was Harry. Undoubtedly.
“Draco. You know I love you. But why in Merlin's name would you want to be anything more than enemies with Potter. I'm not saying kill him but at least hold up the Slytherin pride.”
'A professor? High aim-'
"But you need to know that's it not your fault, okay? They are awful people. What they did to you was because of them, not because of you."
"Then work harder. Your last attempt went horrible."
"Just promise me one thing." Harry said.
"Yeah no shit Potter. Everyone hates you-"
Ron and Hermione followed him and continued their conversation about the upcoming quidditch game. Harry was about to make some comments when he was distracted by blond hair.
"I can't. I have no choice, Harry."
Draco leaned over and laid down on top of him. "9:20"
Harry grinned and made his way to the Great Hall for lunch.
"Dumbledore is the only one Voldemort fears. How do you not understand that him being alive is more important than your parents?"
He stroked the color gently. Would Harry still have his? How would he have reacted when he noticed it?
Snape turned around and walked away quickly.
Draco blushed. Was this guy flirting with him? Merlin, he's horrible at picking up social cues.
"Oh of course you did!" Myrtle cried out "I wish I had been kissed back when I was alive..."
“I really, really want to explain... Please...”
Draco nodded.
"It's about Draco." Her face went serious. More so than usual. "He hasn't left his room in two days."
Harry slowly walked closer to him and could now see his red and puffy eyes in the mirror.
Enough to give him the confidence to finally stand up to Voldemort and throw Harry his wand some moments later in the battle.
'Shut up and eat your bloody dinner.' Harry said, cheeks flushing red.
Narcissa looked at her son, then back at Harry.
"Set the table pet", his master commanded, he could feel the warmth of a gentle cleaning charm on his hands and his body, while his master sat on the table and waved his hand summoning all the cooked food to the table.
"Welcome to parenthood Sir." The Nurse cleaning and disinfecting the room said with a light chuckle.
"Good my little kitten. Now you would clearly Meow after every blow. I'm going to use a Spoon tonight. Bratty pet don't deserve their masters' hands. Alright?"
Who could've guessed that his tough and macho lord was a cuddler in sleep. Well here he was, cuddling his now one and only pet without hesitation. His lord kept his word, he wasn't going to bring another in between them ever now they were Officially husbands. honestly it was his fault for never being what his lord wanted him to be. He had fought hard against their arrangement and now finally he was pleasing and satisfactory enough for his master.
"Ask Draco, whatever is in your mind ask my lovely husband."
Draco was waiting for his lord to come home. He had already prepared dinner and dessert as well as taken a bath with scented oils just like his lord preferred him to smell.
Smack! Smack! Smack!
His lord was now sitting on his special arm chair and held his hair in his hand.
"It is my pleasure" harry said smiling wickedly at him and slid into his ass in one instant. It was like a missing piece of himself was finally re-uniting with him.
He swinged his thong clad dick and balls a bit, jiggled his butt, his tongue was hanging out. He whined like the bitch he was still his master didn't touch him.
His master's hand roamed all over his body, tugging at his nipples with one hand, while another fucked his ass with 4 fingers in it. He felt sucking at his neck, near his ownership collar, His master was being extra attentive tonight, he had never felt that much loved before.
He came with a primal raw scream, which could have woken all of neighborhood if not for secrecy wards on their home, he felt Harry's emptying himself into his arse with a moan and then falling half over him.
Draco slipped into familiar old pose and his master just stood there looking at him. He knew his face must be red right now because of his master's gaze but still he acted.
He giggled again, His husband.
Hermione hadn't Understood his reasons but Molly had. She was mother of 7 children and then had adopted him and Hermione then Draco as hers as well. and we'll Hermione wasn't a parent yet. She wasn't even married yet, as her relation with Ron didn't survive. Ron just wasn't ambitious enough for her, he was happy to work at WWW with his brother and live a simple life. He was dating a sweet girl 2 years their junior right now and was content. He was a normal guy.
A husband he was already planning on filling up with another baby soon in many creative ways.
He laughed as harry continued to lightly tickle him for few seconds until harry was laughing with him as well.
"Come on pretty bitch, don't keep those lovely sounds inside you. let them out. I like when my bitch Moan with her delicious voice.
"Oh my lovely, don't worry you would be beautiful swollen with my child in your womb." His master's hand was roaming on his belly, he felt tingles when his master fingered his belly button a little and he let out a giggle.
He had to take an internal sex change potion 3 days ago, His master hadn't taken him since last week when he had asked for a child of his own to love and spoil.
He felt his master tracing his butt and thighs with the spoon without touching it with his hands. Cruel master, denying his pet's favourite thing.
He stammered, "Mass sster"
His master loved to play with Draco as was his right. Draco was his lord's toy, favourite toy. His lord had several others but they never stayed for long. and never came back, from last few months his lord didn't bring another toy to play with to his home. Draco felt that finally his lord was satisfied with him and now his lord was even taking him to formal dinner with him, he had even listened to his request last week and had considered fulfilling it.
Then he felt a cold sensation in his anal passage cleaning it and then warmth of protection and lubracatio charm.
His son was sleeping and looked so cute with his messy black hair and tiny hands clenched into fists.
It was a bit bare, still it had space and bed and was far away from nursery.
He wouldn't let Draco slip away again.
"Green Master." He somberly replied. This was a punishment, not a pleasure spanking.
He was being spooned with his master's solid frame with a hand on his ass and another on his stomach.
He was openly sobbing now, rutting on the spanking bench to feel some pleasure on his cock, balls and vagina.
Draco woke up and saw that it was still night out there. He had probably slept for just a few hours. He wasn't used to sleeping all night, so he grabbed pyjama bottoms and went to check on Jamie. His husband was still sleeping.
It had been so long since they had sex that it felt like first time all over.
He would talk to Draco tomorrow about tonight's events. But they were here and sleep was a precious commodity.
He looked down at the food he had prepared just an hour ago. It was still steaming a little.
His husband's cock was at full mast now and his hold on hair had tightened by a fair bit.
"whatever youuu wanttt" He moaned as his husband bit his ear lightly and his one hand had wandered on his chest and was playing with one of his dark swollen nipple.
"There my dear, All filled up. Ready to bear my children in your sweet little tummy." His master said and he just hummed in content note. He was too boneless for a verbal response.
"Jameson Harry Potter, Newest and littlest member of Potter household. My lovely son." He looked with awe at the tiny human being he had helped in creating.
Harry rammed into him like a wild hippogriff going at it and he was unable to do anything except screaming and sobbing at the sensation overload. It had been so long.
Even Mrs Weasley had adopted a set of twin elf siblings who honestly did a lot in help her cope with her  depression. George was all too willing to convert the elven siblings into himself and his late brother's copy, and Fred's ghost always encouraged his brother.
His master conjured a soft wet cloth and wiped his sweaty body, he didn't had very high pain tolerance so he was physically rewarded only on few special occasions.
"Mmm Pet" His lord called,
Then there were 4 smacks on his other thigh in succession and tears flowed down from his eyes.
"So what shall we do about that my lovely?" Harry's voice grew even more husky if that was possible.
"Twenty three, Thankyou my master"
"Mmm, sleep for now my sweet Dragon, I'll shower you with all the pretty stones whenever you want." His lord whispered in his ear while he played with his hand sleepily.
His master tied his leash to a chair's top and left him there. Kneeling on floor like a forgotten piece of furniture. Was his punishment going to be Time out like this? doing nothing and just being a kitten.
"I am horny my lord. I am sorry if I disturbed you." He pretended to look down in embarrassment. He wasn't even a bit.
"So my naughty Draco is horny? Hmm" His husband whispered in his ear after holding him tightly and spooning from behind.
His husband just fingered his vagina for now. They had discussed that Draco would go on conventional birth control only after an appointment with his healer. So he wasn't going to be fucked there.
"Remove the thong pet. I want to see my toy properly." His master finally commanded.
For now he just watched over his sleeping husband and child with soft smile on his face.
"Would you be mine as well, My lord Husband, Or you'll have those people...?" He trailed off, not able to finish his question and praying his master won't be displeased at his audacity.
Harry hated using spoon on his lovely Draco but his hand were tired today after signing all those documents and helping Hermione make amendments to a bill which was urgent and he knew how to use spoon lightly. They had done this before.
He put him down and removed the butt plug gently.
He would have to bathe before bed now else Jamie would get all smelly from his sweat. That elf was watching his son though. Don't his master trust him enough?
9 months later
He lovingly carded a hand through his husband's hair and felt him under his hands.
"You can lay for a while Miss Mimosa. This room has everything Jamie needs so you won't have any problem in night. I've left Curry and Rice for you in the kitchen, You can go eat it now while I look after little Jamie here." He said and shooed her away.
His master tensed up slightly behind him,
Next slap came too near to the butt plug still filling his ass shaking it a bit,
Mimosa was a fine creature, just in her early 30s and full of joy, he had adopted her as soon as he read her profile.
Draco looked at their tiny infant with so much wonder and love that harry fell in love with Draco all over again.
As his master entered the bedroom, he took position at the side of the door. He was kneeling on all 4 with his ass high in the air, his tongue out hanging and he shook his butt, his cock swinging in the air, just like his master liked him to behave.
Harry rolled instantly caring not to crush him and then held him in his strong arms and they stayed like that in silence for few long minutes as they tried to catch their breath.
"You can add husband in the list of addresses you're allowed to use darling. I won't begrudge you from calling me your husband, Paperwork has been filed for 5 years but you never accepted me before fully." His master assured him in a soothing tone.
He slowly cleaned up his act, he had always known that he would be someone's brood-mare, when his father had signed him off as Dark lord's slave while in his 7th year Easter holidays, he had felt life leaving him.
next came on the juncture of his thigh and bubble butt,
He wore pink lipstick and even applied some blush and eye makeup tonight, it was a special day after all.
Draco PoV
Everything was alright with in the world.
Hermione though, She was a cannonball. She had passion and fire and ambition to reach high. She was now dating Victor Krum, Again. Victor had accepted Appleby Arrows' contract as seeker after retiring from international Quidditch scene an year ago.
His master manually inserted a short conjured leash in his collar.
Harry just fondly shook his head. His son and husband both looked very similar when sleeping. Adorable.
"Don't worry about that my love. I went too hard on you. I should've remembered that it had been a long while since we indulged in hardcore stuff. I'm sorry for overdoing it." His generous and Sweet husband said to him, holding him even closer if that was possible.
He hadn't forgotten his brat's behaviour as he came home. Draco could've tried this after dinner atleast. He was hungry. Well there it was. The perfect punishment for his kitten.
As he was thinking this, his son started to cry, He looked helplessly at the nurse, who smiled softly at his cluelessness and helped him clean and feed his tiny newborn with a bottle filled with some sort of milk or white solution, well Draco would know for sure.
"So it is. Come pet, we will celebrate this day properly in bedroom." His master took hold of his leash and sent all the dirty dishes flying in the sink with a negligible wave of his hand filling the room with feel of magic which tingled at his skin.
"Thankyou My Lord Husband, I won't displease you. I promise." He said internally bouncing with pleasure.
He moved forward and removed his lord's heavy boots and stood up to remove the travelling cloak as well.
"Hold that my lovely." He heard the command.
He moaned.
He had 'Curves' now. Master Harry hadn't even touched him sexually since his 9th month into pregnancy. saying he was too fragile or some rot.
"Green master." He murmured like he was going to let a small punishment come in between his Lord's playtime.
Still he ate slowly and managed to not spill anything on the floor. His face was dirty but that would be cleaned when his master wished.
His master told him about his own day, endless meetings and his dealings with useless politicians.
Less thinking about his son and more about his brat of the husband.
For now he lifted his lovely brat in his arms and saw blown pupils on Draco's face. He was making kitty sounds absent mindedly. Yes, Gone under subspace.
"Mmm let's start doll, you know the drill. Count loudly or we would start again." His master said as he fondled his ass. He could feel his erect cock leaking in all its 3 inch erect glory, his vaginal opening under his balls squirming in anticipation, leaking a bit of pre cum as well.
His master sensed his hesitation in an instant, too aware of his cues and ticks,
He let out a sigh of pleasure and relief as felt his master's magic wash over him and seal his vaginal opening with some rubbery barrier after he removed him cock from there.
They didn't need some fancy elf in their home. Draco could manage their home just fine.
From front door holding hands. The elf was included in wards now, so it was here to stay. Maybe this was a good thing. He could sleep at nights now. The Elf was probably female, His master had called it Mimosa, And Mimosa was a feminine drink and some kind of plant.
"June 5 master." he said blushing heavily at his master's expression towards him. It was his birthday and the day his master had finally claimed him 5 years ago.
He left the room and went back to his own room. His husband sleepily asked, "Jamie Asleep?"
He transfigured a Small footrest into a padded elf sized bed and settled it in the side.
"You Present a lovely sight my pet, Suck". His lord said and shoved one foot on Draco's mouth while his other foot played with Draco's cock, teasing the base of his anus and sensative vaginal opening where butt plug connected as well. His balls were tingling with the sensations as he sucked the big toe of his master.
He had stopped himself just in time from saying one aloud. It had been many months since he was spanked in anyway.
His master came a few moments after him, his vaginal opening clutching at his master's cock tightly, not willing to let it go.
He didn't have permission to stand so he dragged his thong down to his knees still kneeling on the floor. His dick and balls which half hanged before were now on display.
His master was reading some mail which has came in evening and as usual Draco had left the mail on tray in drawing room while absent mindedly squeezing Draco's balls with his toe fingers.
Harry himself was facing a bit of Backlash after the birth of his son with Draco, many people weren't happy. They wanted someone without any link to death eaters at his arm, He didn't care. Draco was his and he was Draco's. Everyone else could go rot. And Jamie, their little bludger was a blessing. Well he could atleast aim like a bludger with his tiny peeny at anyone.
He dedicated himself to sucking Harry's cock and was rewarded with a heavy load of cum only a few minutes later.
He carefully climbed the stairs and went into their bedroom. After depositing his husband on their bed and cleaned him with a wet rag. He cleaned sticking food from Draco's face and hair, and then vanished his conjured kitten ears.
"Yes Master" I replied eagerly,
Draco had sang Jamie to sleep after feeding him. He was tired but won't wait any longer. He had been cleared by his healer a month ago as soon as his vaginal opening healed, It would be always there until he got it operated and closed but for now he knew that his Lord Husband wanted more children, well so did he. He won't be able to handle his child with pregnancy so soon after Jamie but still his husband hadn't even played with him for last 3 months. He had counted!
He slept and dreamt of running around chasing pitter patter of little feet in their home.
Then he felt a hard smack on his Ass and he cried out,
He had willingly dressed as a Cat today. He didn't knew this was going to happen. He just wanted to be fucked and maybe played with a bit.
Smack! Smack! Smack! Smack!
He saw his lord standing up and felt a little hope. Maybe he would receive his punishment now and then he can go and sulk in some corner. They didn't need an elf.
He counted back from 50 to 0. Trying to control his anger.
He left the room without entering properly not wanting to disturb the duo. His husband had chosen well.
He crawled behind his lord, always a few steps at back but matching his lord's 2 legs with his 4. He was naked with a pink poodle tail butt plug still in his asshole.
The dark lord had kept him naked and collared on the dirty cold floor for 3 entire days without food and any relief till holidays ended.
Another on his other butt cheek,
Master dropped his hair and waved his wand, a leash attacked to his collar appeared just as his robe vanished.
His master noticing his expression, winked at him and moved to the dining room holding his leash in one hand. He followed word-lessly, his erect dick was hanging useless as his master tucked himself properly and buttoned his trousers.
Harry vanished the sweat and cum from their bodies but their bedsheet was ruined, they fell asleep smiling and holding each other as they didn't care about that.
He had missed this. Children were blessing but they were a lot of work. He hadn't been able to care for his husband meanwhile.
His husband grabbed his cock and pumped it a bit, then his husband commanded him to cum in that damned sexy voice of his.
A few moments later his master slid back into the silk sheets, under the blanket and cocooned him again.
"Oh Master harry, I gave little master Jamie some milk from the box in here. you were being busy with other master. Then master Jamie be sleeping and Mimosa Silenced the door. Yes she did." Mimosa babbled at pulled at her ears a bit when he looked at her.
“Yeah, that sounds like a good idea.” Harry leaned back against the tree and took a sip of his tea. Some of the tension eased out of his shoulders. He closed his eyes again. The next time he woke up he was in bed. The clock on the wall said it was three in the morning and his head still hurt, but he was awake. He took something for his headache and tried to read for a while, but he kept getting distracted. The piece of folded up paper on the desk dragged his attention away from his book one time too many so he got up and settled himself at his desk. He thought for a while before starting his letter. He stretched out his shoulders and dug some paper out of his desk. When he’d finally found a pen, he began to write.
For the next couple of hours people popped in and out to get their hair and makeup done and Harry was thriving. He adored seeing the finished product and knowing that he’d created it. Molly couldn’t get over how shiny he’d managed to get her hair and Audrey was astounded with the victory rolls that Harry had produces. The vintage style suited her down to the ground. He’d given Lucy soft, beachy waves and affixed an ever-lasting daisy into her hair. It was nearing twelve and he’d just started working on Fleur when Luna arrived. Luna and Fleur were going to be bridesmaids and Ginny was the Maid of Honour. They’d decided to go with soft curls with the front part taken back and braided down the back of the hair. Fleur was as breath-taking as ever when Harry had finished with her and Cho revelled in doing her makeup while he did Luna’s hair. He noticed that Ginny was struggling to take their eyes off the grinning woman sat in the chair in front of him. She was chatting about what stories she’d been working on at work and Ginny hung off every word she said. Harry new they’d be perfect for one another if they did decide to pursue a relationship and a feeling nagged at the pit of Harry’s stomach. It wasn’t jealousy or envy. He was incredibly happy for Ginny at the prospect of them finding love. He couldn’t figure out what it was, but it felt something like longing.
Comments would be much appreciated to let me know if you're enjoying the story, what you're enjoying about it and what I could work on to improve. Your feedback will help me be better :)
“You like it then?”
“Nothing. We’ll split bills and things, but I already own the house so it’s not like I’ll be paying a mortgage or anything. All I ask is that you give me a hand with the renovations.” Luna nodded enthusiastically.
“I’m going for a shower Gin, then we’ll do your hair. You’re welcome to hide out in here for a while if you like.”
I'm not 100% happy with this chapter and it's not particularly long, but it's kind of a bridge chapter and I'm hoping to have more up soon.
When he awoke, Ginny was cradling him, making soothing noises to try and calm him. He woke up screaming less and less, but it still happened, and when it did Ginny was nearly always there to help him. His heart began to slow after a while, and he wiped the tears away from his eyes.
Chapter Four: Memories
As more people came into the kitchen, they began helping to sort through the vegetables, putting them away however they needed to be stored. Harry made everyone cups of tea and when Ginny came down, they gratefully accepted theirs. They looked around the room nervously, but everyone just acted normal, or smiled reassuringly. Some of the tension seemed to leave their shoulders and they relaxed into helping with the vegetables.  Neville and Arthur chatted excitedly about Arthur’s next plans for the garden and Seamus offered to make him some more raised beds. Harry looked around at the smiling, happy faces and a wave of affection for his friends and family washed over him. When Audrey walked into the room, she pulled Ginny into a hug.
“Thanks.” He greedily gulped at the water; his throat felt like a desert. His head and muscles felt somewhat better though. “How are you Mrs Granger?”
“That’s amazing news!” Harry hugged his friend tight. He was so full of joy for them and he knew they would both be amazing parents. He knew that Bill and Fleur’s baby and Ron and Hermione’s baby would both have childhoods filled with love and family and it made Harry teary with happiness. They re-joined the rest of the group and say waiting no-so-patiently for the alert from Bill. They drank copious amounts of tea and ate scones that George and Angelina had brought. When the call finally came it was nearly six in the evening and they all floo’d over to the hospital.
“Mr potter,
“Oh, no one. Just a friend.” Ginny blushed slightly, the tips of their ears becoming a soft pink. Harry had never noticed Ginny’s ears did that when they blushed, they’d always been hidden behind their hair. He decided to drop it and instead asked Ginny if she wanted a cup of tea bringing up. Tea fixed everything.
Anyway, I hope you enjoy the next chapter!
“I don’t think I can face him after what happened. He’ll never let me live it down. And I don’t know if I’d be able to work with Malfoy even if I hadn’t fallen onto my face in front of him and had him carry me in his bloody arms back to The Burrow.”
“Yeah, that would be cool. I can always chat to him and see where it goes.” The other men nodded, and Dean wrote the address down for him. Harry folded it up and put in the pockets of his shorts, thanking them.
Harry didn’t make a speech. They’d decided that Ginny was going to do it instead, as Harry found talking in front of crowds uncomfortable. It always reminded him of being in front of the court at all of the trials after the war. His eyes drifted back to Malfoy as he thought about this, remembering speaking at his trial. Malfoy had looked incredibly ill at his trial. He was gaunt and he had large black bags under his eyes. His bones had jutted out of his translucent skin and it looked like it would tear. Harry had felt sorry for him then and he had taken the decision to speak in favour of Malfoy receiving a much reduced sentence. He knew that they were both just kids at the end of the day, manipulated by those that were meant to protect them. Malfoy was watching Ginny speak with what looked like real interest, taking in the anecdote about their childhood and teenage years. He supposed Malfoy didn’t really know anything about what life had been like for them, and he didn’t know what life had really been like for Malfoy. Once again the grey eyes locked with his own and Harry looked away. He couldn’t hide the blush this time, and he had no idea where the butterflies in his stomach had come from. He was grateful when the speeches had finished, and he could busy himself with the lemon meringue that had appeared in front of him.
If you let me know when you’re free, I’ll be there. My schedule isn’t particularly full at the minute.
“We can pass you his business address so you can owl him, if you like?” Dean asked, and Harry nodded.
It was this picture that Harry was looking at when he heard his door creak open. He lifted his head to see Ginny poking her head around the door.
“It’s eleven thirty and you’re still in bed.” They said accusingly. “What were me meant to be doing this morning?”
The next day people emerged slowly throughout the day. Harry woke up earlier than he thought he would and set about helping with the great tidy up operation. They all worked hard, wanting to have everything sorted as soon as possible. By five everything was spotless and by six everyone was sat around eating. A lot of people had gone home but the dismantling of the huts was a job for the day after. Harry’s body ached and he was exhausted, but the day before had been worth it. Ron and Hermione were still at their bungalow and he didn’t expect to see them for a few days. He found a spot under a shaded tree with a cold drink and closed his eyes for a second.
The sky outside was a soft blue with fluffy clouds drifting lazily by. It was still hot, but the sun had lost some of its intensity, making it a more comfortable heat. Harry wandered around outside, already on his second cup of tea. He helped where he could and fetched sustenance for people when they needed it. His big job was coming the next day; the day of the actual wedding, when he was meant to be styling hair. The ceremony would be starting at two in the afternoon, so he would likely have to have made a start by eight at the latest. He preferred staying up late and sleeping in late, but he knew a couple of days getting up early would be worth it. He was also excited to work alongside Cho. She was going to be doing the makeup for the day and she was absolutely wonderful at it. She specialised in wedding and special events makeup and had travelled around the world, going where her business took her. Harry almost envied her; she was getting to do the thing she loved the most while also getting to see the world. He decided to talk to her about it when he saw her and ask her if there were any pitfalls to it.
Sincerely,
The rest of the day saw Harry helping when and where he could and there was another buffet put out in the evening for all of the guests. All of the work that could be done that day had been done by then and everyone say around outside, talking and unwinding after the long day. Harry was reminded once again how lucky he was to have such an amazing adoptive family and group of friends. They’d all worked tirelessly throughout the day to make sure that Ron and Hermione’s wedding the day after would be perfect. He looked around at everyone laughing and nattering about anything and everything and felt like he well and truly belonged. He was safe and happy here, but he also couldn’t wait to see what came next. He was looking forward to the wedding the day after, he was looking forward to the birth of Bill and Fleur’s baby, he was looking forward to seeing what the tiny seed of an idea about the salon would grow into with his friends’ and family’s help.
“You should go down and have something to eat. Mum’s fretting.” Ginny all but dragged him down the stairs and sat him in front of a plate of food. He ate, though he wasn’t hungry, thanked Molly and then excused himself. It was only six in the evening, but he was exhausted. He decided to try and sleep as much as he could before going to the meeting the next day.
Fleur let me know that you had the flu. You really shouldn’t have made yourself more ill just to attend the meeting. I would have understood if you had postponed our meeting for a different date.
Harry had just shown Draco how to make a grilled cheese sandwich (he said it was his new favourite food) when Draco asked him about his claustrophobia.
Draco lifted his head. "What do you mean, love?"
Snape harshly did so. "Put your wand away."
Draco sighed relieved and hugged him, pushing his nose in his neck. Fuck he missed him. So much. He kissed him right where his curly hair met the top of his ear.
Harry tapped some cabinets with his wand and lead the dishes to the dinner room and placed them on the big table. Draco followed with the floating lasagna and salad.
"Okay, sounds... fun? What's your point." Hermione asked.
Draco smiled. 'You're done at four, right?'
Draco rubbed his temple, his shoulders tensed. Then he whispered. "It's happening tonight..."
Nervously he took Dumbledore's arm and they disapparated to a rock on the ocean near the entrance of a cave.
Harry carefully wrapped his arms around Draco's waist. He felt the other boy smile in the kiss.
“Fine?”
Snape was holding his arm painfully, the two of the making their way to the Room of Requirement, ready to welcome the Death Eaters.
Draco was surprised by the sudden touch as Harry pushed up his sleeve as far as he could. He stood there, his arm stretched out, Harry writing on his arm, his strong hand still holding his wrist. They were closer than they'd been in a long time.
"Please, Myrtle I-"
They stared at each other for what felt like hours.
"Hi" Harry said as he looked at him with a big smile.
"Thank you." She whispered in his ear, still hugging him. "Thank you."
"Yeah, well, he is. He died two years ago. You know him, actually. He's Sirius Black."
Harry sighed, rolled his eyes and opened the stall-door.
Dumbledore was dead.
"Ooooohhh"
Harry stared at him, his cheeks bright red. 'I love you so much.'
"N-no. You don't get it. W-we need to get out..."
He turned towards the voice. "Yeah, I'm here."
Draco let Harry pick something, gin and tonic, as he didn't know any muggle drinks.
"Oh yes. He's a very sensitive boy, you know."
"Please don't cut me out. Just tell me."
He placed his hands in the black hair and kissed back hard, his tongue exploring the mouth that had gotten so familiar to him these past week. He pulled back softly.
Things went well as long as he made sure he didn't got himself stuck in small spaces. But it was in sixth year when he found himself trapped again, this time in a small cupboard.
"Show off" Pansy smiled, "You could try it though."
Draco nodded and smiled. 'I think I like that as well.'
“Pansy!”
He clenched his jaw. Fuck Snape.
He looked through his closet again. His eyes fell on the sweater on his right. Harry's sweater, to be exact.
He had kept it together before, but now everything came out and he couldn't stop sobbing in Harry's sweater, which still had his scent.
After a quick shower Draco pulled on his clothes, muggle jeans and one of Harry's comfy sweaters he had nicked a few days before.
"Don't you 'Hi, Pansy' me? Who the hell do you think I am? Some stupid first year?"
The sounds around them dimmed away until it was just them looking at each other. Harry's hand trembled as he was still clenching his wand.
"There's, no, I mean-" Harry said shaking his head, his chest tightening.
Breathe in, breathe out. He opened the door.
Draco smiled and pulled Harry closer, placing his hands on the other boy's neck.
Draco's been off lately, Pansy and Blaise had noticed it even before he did. So after lots of complaining and pushing, he told them everything about what happened a week ago.
"Fine. I'll guess!"
He stared at the lake, not knowing what to say. Should he be honest? Should he just tell her? He told Harry, sure he could tell his best friend.
Harry just laughed at them as Luna straightened out her dress and took Ginny's hand.
"I would trust you with anything."
Draco was staring at the wall as it slowly changed into a wooden door. He put his hand on the handle and pushed, part of him afraid he wouldn't find Harry but the room he's been visiting the whole year.
Draco laughed as Pansy made all kinds of disgusted faces. He missed her.
"No, I'm free. I'd love to come with you. Where do you live?"
"I already do a lot of things in secret, why not add kissing a Slytherin?"
"I knew it! You're hiding something from me!"
Luna stroked some hairs out of her girlfriend's face. "Just let them be happy, sweetheart..."
Every now and then he'd feel someone place a hand on his shoulder or whisper "my condoleances" in his ear, not that he cared.
"Well they didn't. " Harry said, "They hate me. They always treated me like... I don't know, like I wasn't their nephew but someone who worked for them. But instead of money I got payed in hits."
He didn't want to confront Draco. Not after what had happened between them.
Last chapter...
Draco blushed. 'A muggle school will be odd, but I think it will be good for me. Less drama. No people who know me.
He smiled when he heard the silly song. He was now standing a few steps away from the portret, hidden from the people coming in and out. He hadn't particularly thought this part through.
Draco sighed “Fine. Fine! I'll just. Become his friend. Right?”
'Mais bien sûr,' Draco said, 'les Malfoys sont très fiers de leur origine française.'*
"You don't deserve that." Draco said after staring at him from a while. "What those people did to you. You don't deserve that."
He really hoped they would.
"Or wasn't that what you were day dreaming about?"
Harry clenched up.
"I'll give you the details Wednesday."
Harry looked up at him and smiled sadly.
Snape was staring down at him, fire in his eyes, jaw clenched. His hand was still tightly wrapped around Draco's arm.
Harry was leaning back in his chair, watching the people dance on the dancefloor. Bill and Fleur were laughing with Molly and Arthur and Ginny was dancing with Hermione.
'Classes 'till four, then therapy from half past four 'till half past five.' He answered as he put on his shoes and jacket.
"Yes, yes. I am aware of that, Severus." Voldemort continued as he lifted his hand away from Draco's shoulder. "But I do believe a form of punishment should be given."
Draco shook his head. "You don't understand. He'll kill my parents if I don't do it."
Harry took his hands and moved closer to him, their knees touching. "Just tell me what is going on. I've been worried. Parkinson's been worried."
"I love you." Harry agreed, kissing him again, "I can't believe how easy it is to say that."
"What? No of course not. Why would you think that?" Shit shit shit.
But he couldn't.
Maybe.
Draco shrugged, 'I don't know. I was kind of busy fighting a war.'
"Wait" he said as he grabbed one of Harry's wrists.
Draco walked him to the front door. 'I'll see you tonight at your place, right? That way we can get ready for tomorrow.'
“You know your dad is gonna kill you if he’d ever find out?” Pansy said.
The boy he loved, the only boy he'd ever loved was gone.
"Yes, no. Of course I want to. That's not the problem. I-" Fuck, why was it so hard to just say it?
"It's him, right? He told me he liked a boy but I would've never guessed it was you!"
Ginny raised an eyebrow "Luna, what boy are you talking about?" She turned to Harry "Was that what you were thinking about yesterday? When I asked you?"
"Fine!" Hermione begrudgingly said.
"Good."
(See the end of the chapter for
There were a few regular students working in the café as he was cleaning the coffee machine, soft jazz music was playing in the background.
And they never had to hide again.
'Not funny.' Harry chuckled. 'But seriously, you speak French?'
All he could do was lie there, his body presses against Draco's, and hope that maybe one day he could say it out loud. Maybe.
"How dare you say that!" Draco was now yelling, "Do you really think my parents are less important than some old man? How fucking dare you, you don't even have parents!"
"I- eh... I don't know why I'm doing this... But... Thanks for not telling anyone about, you know..."
"That's not what I- Nevermind." Harry rolled his eyes. "Fine. I'll come. What time?"
Leave your thoughts in the comments and vote on this chapter if you like it! The next chapter is already up! I upload every Friday!
Draco looked amazed at the boy in front of him, already determined to kiss every scar and every freckly. He started kissing Harry again and quickly lowered his attention to his neck - 'Merlin he smells amazing' - and then his chest.
"O shut your mouth, Potter."
“Oh my gosh you bloody moron.” Blaise said. “Just become his friend, take him into some empty classroom and say 'Hi. I like you. Do you like me back?' It's that simple.”
"Yes. I'm ready."
“Holy shit.” Blaise said.
"Of course there is," Luna continued "I've always known you like him. That's why I decided to lock you up together. That way you two had no choice but to confront your feelings."
They took of their pants, then more. Until all that was left was Harry's lips on Draco's body, his strong fingers, then lots of lube and moans.
"Well, nothing, really. I'm just hyped."
"N-nothing." He said and looked at Harry from across the hall. He couldn't stop smiling.
"Because Snape came up to me and said he needed to talk to you." She hissed, "And I know him, okay? I know that that wasn't about a grade or something. It was really serious. He was angry."
He smiled at Draco. 'He sounds amazing. I'll still give you that coffee, though. To celebrate your teaching plans and this lucky bloke.'
Draco was standing over the sink. Crying. He couldn't do this.
Harry started breathing difficult and his hands were shaking. Draco raised an eyebrow and looked at him
Harry stared at her and blinked.
When he sat down at the table for dinner - he looked for Draco but there was still no sign of him - and heard his friends talk about the Ravenclaw party, he felt so alone.
"Because it's decided that's when it's happening."
"Done with this? Do you mean us?"
He had just one thought crossing his mind over and over again. He knew he could never admit it, he could barely admit it to himself, but he couldn't say it out loud. That just wasn't how this relationship worked.
All of the sudden they were stopped by spells being fired towards them. Draco saw at least one professor and what must be another Weasley, but there were also students fighting along them. Students he knew, Granger and that weird Lovegood girl.
"Oh. Hello." He said.
What did you wanted to tell us?” Pansy asked when Draco called her and Blaise to sit down with him in his bed.
“I'm not expecting anything from you.” Draco said after he told Harry all he was allowed to. About how You-Know-Who made him kill Dumbledore or else he’d kill Draco’s parents. About how he absolutely hated everything that had to do with the war. “But please, please. Don't. Tell. Anyone.'”
"Wait, what?"
Draco blushed.
'You're with me. You're home. You're okay. Just take a few deep breaths.'
"Hey do you wanna, ehm... Go to the bed?" Harry asked with a shy smile. "I mean, shit, not in that way, just thought-"
He sat down next to him on the couch.
"We've been here so long already?"
"Avada Kedavra" a voice said. It wasn't Draco's. It was Snape. Immediately after he had said it Harry was able to move again.
“And hey,” Harry said and Draco turned around. “You tell me if you're about to do something dumb again. Okay? We'll figure something out.”
But this was more important. They had found Katie just lying there. She looked so sad and scared.
"Wanna go to the Room of Requirement?" Harry whispered against Draco lips.
Draco clenched his jaw.
"I'll take a shower if you come with me."
"Yes you did. You called me Draco." The blond said with a small grin. "What happened to Malfoy?"
Draco swallowed the lump in his throat.
So what they hugged? They weren't friends. They didn't have to talk. They only hugged because he practically wasn't breathing. Nothing had changed for Harry. They were still enemies.
"Hey there, what can I get the two of you?" A waiter had come up to there table.
"Is that a love letter I see there?"
Harry sipped his drink and bit his lip.
"Sir, before we go, there's something I need to tell you."
"Hello Harry" she said with a wink.
"What? Parkinson, with all due respect but how could I go in there? I'm not particularly friends with them?"
Draco took a deep breath, his shoulders still tense.
They entered the castle through a side entrance.
"Do it..." Draco whispered softly, "It's okay, I deserve it..."
Draco stared at him in disbelieve.
The curtains opened before he could finish his sentence.
It was low light but still very cosy. Some people were sitting at the bar and a few were dancing on the music that was playing in the background. He could clearly tell it was a muggle bar, which he liked, it was more private, but there was something different about it.
Draco opened his closet for the millionth time that night. Was he wearing the right outfit?
"Nine. But everyone will be casually late so probably ten thirty."
"How could you?" Harry said quietly.
Slytherin's locket was a fake.
Harry put wrapped his arms around Draco's waist and leaned forward, almost closing the distance between their faces."
This couldn't be true. It couldn't be.
After he had a quick shower he made his way to the Great Hall, probably more likely to get lunch than breakfast, but he didn't mind.
It felt weird, though. He lost his virginity three nights ago and he couldn't tell his friends. Not even Ron.
And so, before Harry could say another word about Draco's plan, Dumbledore told him what they'd be doing tonight.
Maybe if the DA would be able to stop Snape and the Death Eaters.
Draco bit his lip anxiously. "Yeah... I know... Sorry."
Longer chapter than usual, I hope you liked it because I worked pretty hard on this one! Leave kudos or comments if you want. I upload every Friday!
When Draco had exited the Room of Requirement that morning he felt a hand grabbing him harshly.
(See the end of the chapter for
The audience gasped as Harry got up.
"Can I go now?"
Draco blushed. "Yeah?"
A cold hand gripped his shoulder.
“And in the meantime...” Harry continued “...do you wanna, maybe, if you want to... be friends?”
Then it was quiet.
Harry tried to breath normally and fly to the exit, but he kept thinking about those hands holding him. Draco's smell. His nose touching his neck.
"Miss Parkinson, I would hate to take away the points I have just given Slytherin." Slughorn suddenly interrupted. "Please say silent."
If Draco had done this Harry needed to know why. He had theories, of course, but he should ask him first. Face to face.
It was three days later.
“Yeah. Fine. I won't tell anyone.”
Draco couldn't possibly hide the smile on his face even if he wanted to. Not that he did.
"I know, I know. Trust me, I'm as surprised as you are... But there's just something about him." Harry said.
Draco had convinced his mom to start paying the house elves after the war. She had been reluctant at first but eventually she'd agreed.
"Oh shit, sorry Harry." Ginny said, her cheeks flushing red. "We were just-" She didn't finish her sentence.
This was way better than before. There was no stress, no crying and no leaving.
He looked at the grave Hermione was standing at.
"C-congratulations on the game." He said, his voice still trembling.
He had put it in his suitcase, stuffed under his other clothes.
Draco stared down at his bed, on which they were all sitting. He hated this. Bloody feelings. He should've just ignored all of it. Pushed it away.
Harry was high on endorphins. Music around him, everyone happy and drinking butter beer. People kept congratulating him. He and the team were being treated like gods.
"Why didn't you tell anyone?..."
"...and everyone is okay with that?" Harry asked carefully.
He now realised he was still pointing it at him.
Oh no. No no no no no. He didn't want to stop talking to Harry.
Draco leaned forward and kissed him softly. "I missed you..."
"Do you want to?" Harry whispered.
Dear Merlin, please don't let it be the last time.
'Oh Draco loves cooking!' Narcissa said. 'Ever since he was a little boy he wanted to help the house elves in the kitchen. And then he'd come up to Lucius and I and show us whatever he had made, cookies or pumpkin pastries or shepard's pie. He'd always look so proud of what he had created!'
'Shit, that's right. You tell him about the panic attack from last Thursday, promise?'
Draco swallowed.
Harry nodded enthusiastically. "Can I take off yours?"
Draco sniffed and placed his head on Harry's shoulder.
"Oh." Harry smiled. "To be honest, me neither."
Harry defended Draco and Narcissa, they only got a very light punishment.
Draco raised an eyebrow. "Your godfather? I thought your whole family was... dead?"
Right?
"Screw quidditch. Why are you crying? Here of all places?"
"I think we'll make it work. Don't you agree?" Harry asked.
He was wearing black dress pants, his torso uncovered.
He let all his thoughts and worries drift away, until there was only him and Harry.
"Draco?"
Hermione smiled and Ron continued.
"Great, let me give you the address." He got out a ballpoint, he had taken a liking to muggle items recently,  from an inside pocket of his dinner jacket, the only formal wear he was able to find for the trial, and took Draco's right wrist in his hand.
"Nooo! I wanna know! Please..." she cried.
Draco got a little scared. He'd never seen Harry like this. He always was the brave and annoying Gryffindor.
Harry turned towards his friends again while quickly putting the note in his pocket.
Pansy gawked at him and started laughing loudly. "You fucking didn't! That's amazing! Oh wait no, now I'm picturing it. Ew. Ew, ew, ew, ew!"
He really hoped so.
The student raised an eyebrow, 'then what are you the right guy for? Not working in a coffee shop for the rest of your life, I hope?'
Draco and Pansy talk and Harry plays quidditch
They locked eyes if only for less than a second. But it was enough.
Or live in fear.
“Okay. Great.”
“Did what?” She asked.
"Oh shut your mouth." He laughed back. "I'm serious. Do you have plans or...?"
Harry exited the classroom as soon as McGonagall told her class they could leave.
"I am very sorry. I was overwhelmed with all these feelings and I didn't know what to do with them. But I really want to make it up to you. If you let me."
"Really, Harry" Hermione said "stop stalking Malfoy. You've been acting so weird lately..."
(See the end of the chapter for
The crowd gasped but continued celebrating the victory as the two girls smiled at each other.
“What do you want Potter?” he said while quickly wiping off the tears from his face.
There was just one moment where he and Harry made eye contact. It lasted just a few seconds but Draco could clearly see the hurt and confusion in his eyes before they quickly turned back to his plate.
He pulled off the white shirt he was wearing and threw it on his bed.
"I want you to come with me... We can run away. That way we can just be together. And you don't have to hurt anyone... Will you come with me?"
'Just me and my horrible cooking.' Harry laughed.
Draco smiled and nodded. "You think you can leave your celebration party?"
He didn't even got to say goodbye.
Draco lifted his head at stared into green eyes. "It's not not your party." He said with a grin. "You deserve it though. You're the captain."
"No thanks Hermione. I'll see you guys at the party." Harry left without waiting for any more commentary from them.
He slowly rolled over, looking for a clock of some sorts. The room quickly provided one. '8:47' Harry read, bringing the clock closer to his eyes. He didn't know where his glasses were nor did he care.
Draco tightly wrapped his arms around Harry's waist.
"Oh... Ehm, yeah? I guess."
"Yeah... I know... Hey Myrtle."
Harry never thought he'd be friends with Draco Malfoy, but to his surprise it felt very natural to be around him.
He smiled shyly and then pushed Harry on the bed, grinding up against him.
She aggressively pointed at him and then herself and nudged her head again, her lips pouted and nostrils wide.

He was about to go down the stairs and look for Draco as he heard a soft sobbing. He turned around to see where it was coming from and went around a corner.
"Draco-fucking-Malfoy! We need to talk, now."
Harry placed his hands on Draco's lower back, his fingers touching the exposed skin as he kisses him softly.
Pansy looked at him confused.
Draco wanted to say something, anything. Beg him to stay and help him. Kiss him and tell him he loved him over and over again. But he just stood there, watching Harry grab his sweater and glasses from the bedroom and wand from the nightstand, and make his way to the door of the dorm room.
Draco laughed and took a big bite, pointing to mouth, indicating that he couldn't speak.
He kept quiet.
"You're one of the secret keepers now." Draco complemented. "And you would trust me with that kind of crucial information?"
Harry carefully sat down next to him, leaving some space between them.
"Harry? Are you okay? What happened?" "N-nothing, 'mione... It's fine... Really." Harry answered, desperate to change the subject.
Katie Bell had gotten back from St Mungo's that morning and it had wrecked him.
Draco smiled and walked to the door.
When Harry made his way to the Gryffindor common room to get his Invisibility Cloak he quickly gave Ron and Hermione his Felix Felicis and told then roughly what was going on.
Harry lay down in his bed, cheeks flushing red.
Draco let go of his hand and clenched his teeth. "We should probably go separately."
"What is it Potter?" He snapped, though he was actually a little concerned.
“Harry, I told you I have to. I have t-”
"Don't worry about it. I'm handling it."
"I know we will."
"When was the last time you took a shower?"
'Wait really?'
“What is it, Malfoy?”
Narcissa chuckled, keeping her napkin in front of her mouth.
"Thorns" Pansy whispered again.
Harry looked at him. Draco standing between them, staring at him. He didn't move a muscle.
"The last thing I know of is you and him becoming friends? Sort of?"
He clenched his jaw. "It's a horrible family, isn't it? When Sirius went to Azkaban I thought maybe my mom would visit sometime but she never did. I didn't even know it was still being used."
"No" Harry was splashing some water in his face.
Harry couldn't answer however. His breathing went funny and his hands became sweaty. The closet was small, especially for two sixteen year old guys. He felt the wall in his back and Draco's chest on his.
“Have you been crying?”
"Why? I-I'm sorry. Too personal. Especially for us."
"Run, you fool!" Snape told Draco and so he did.
He looked at himself in the mirror, his face dripping with water. He took the sweater that was laying to his right and used it to wipe his face dry. Except, that wasn't his sweater.
Draco walked out and went back to the Slytherin common room.
His hand weakend and his wand fell on the ground. He sank down and leaned against the sinks.
Draco smiled and looked at him teasingly. He swallowed. 'Fine, fine... But don't laugh at me, promise?'
And so he did. He ran up the stairs as fast as he could.
"Your shirt, I mean." He continued as Harry raised an eyebrow.
"The panick attack?"
"About you and Draco being together?"
It took some time for Draco to realise what he meant.
He placed a hand in Draco's neck and kissed him softly. The blond, though a little caught off guard, kissed back.
Draco smiled, tears were forming in his eyes and sighed. "Thank you."
Harry sat up, taking Draco's hands in his own. "I'm not going back to school next year."
Please, I have to talk to you.
"No. I'm done with this." If Harry'd just leave they could talk tomorrow and fix everything. Merlin, if only they could fix everything.
The boy looked at him, actively listening, not judging.
"Like I said. You two had to confess your feeling to each other."
"Maybe we could meet somewhere? If you'd let me, of course?"
This was inevitable. He was lucky he wasn't been dead already.
He pushed himself up and allowed his fingers to run over Harry's torso.
Merlin, he loved him. He missed him. He wished he had made another choice. He wished he could kiss him. He wished he could take his hand and run away right now.
Hope you liked it! Give kudos if you want or let me know what you think! Next chapter is already up! I upload every Friday!
Eventually a dark shadow had appeared.
Let me know what you think! Next chapter is already up! ;)
"Oh yeah. Me too." He smiled and quickly let go of Harry's wrist which he now realised he was still holding.
He didn't defend Lucius, though. He got a life sentence.
"Good morning." Draco smiled. It felt amazing, he wished he could say that every morning.
Draco looked at the railing, trying to hide his flushed cheeks.
Leave kudos and comments if you want! Next chapter is already up!
'Thanks. I'm alright.' He says, his throat is sore.
Draco looked at him, smiling bashfully. 'I love you so much too...' he said softly. 'Now shut up 'cause you're making me cry.'
Harry sighed and nodded. 'Are you nervous?' He asked.
“Yeah. I figured after all this shit we've told each other, we're close enough to call us friends... But if you don't want to I unde-”
He screams and sits up.
More smut coming :) Won't be very explicit because I cannot write that lmao. Enjoy!
Harry quickly got Draco and pulled him up on his broom, just in time as the fire had taken over everything now. The only safe place was up in the air, but it wouldn't be for much longer.
Ron pulled him towards the Great Hall for lunch and continued talking.
What if he hadn't gotten the note? What if Draco accidentally dropped it on the floor instead of in Harry's hand? What if had been taken and thrown away by a teacher? Or worse, what if Harry had read it but decided to not show up? What if he had ruined it all by walking away that night?
He wanted to explain how amazing Draco was, how sweet and caring and funny and vulnerable and hot he was. But he couldn't.
"You shouldn't have. You're not my mom."
Draco was waiting anxiously. The Death Eaters had just gotten word of some group of "rebels".
The portret opened and two girls stumbled in.
"Yeah, how?"
Harry blinked and frowned at him.
He hoped and he hoped and hoped that maybe... just maybe...
Harry grabbed Draco's leg and placed it over his lap, still kissing him passionately.
He cramped up and whimpered. It felt like his bones were on fire.
"Yeah, eh, my aunt and uncle didn't bother giving me an actual bedroom but instead made me sleep in a cupboard under the stairs..."
"I really have to go back now, sorry."
They still had about three quarters until anyone would notice they had gone missing.
Harry stared at him with some disbelief in his eyes.
Harry leaned forward and pressed their lips together. Draco leaned in. He had missed Harry so much. Missed this so much.
"Why would you like him? He's a greasy little ferret! You hate him! His parents are followers of You-Know-Who..." She whispered the last part.
He wasn't fully realizing what he was doing. He hadn't been for a very, very long time.
"Oh, hi Myrtle" he greeted her with a smile.
He took a sip of water, waiting for Myrtle to say just another random girl's name so that he'd finally be able to go back to Snape's class. Not that that would be much fun.
"I-ehm..."
'No! How come you never told me?' He asked, raising an eyebrow.
Harry finally got the message and stood up abruptly. "Sorry guys, gotta go."
He just wished it could be so easy for him and Draco.
Meet me at the astronomy tower at 9.
Not just the stuff in the Daily Prophet, or even the Quibbler. The real stuff. Even if it's just because of Harry's dumb (cute, let's be honest) curiousity.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry nodded slowly.
Harry nodded. "I'm sorry."
He arrived at the Astronomy Tower and saw Dumbledore standing there. He shouted: "Expelliarmus!"
"Just leave me alone, okay. Focus on your bloody classes, would you?" His eyes still focused on the table.
"So this is it..." Harry said and clenched his jaw.
"Blaise too. Even Crabbe and Goyle notice something is different about you. It sucks that you're not telling us. At least tell me. I promise I wo-"
"I... I didn't."
Harry traced his hand over Draco's back, "We could..."
"You went looking for me?"
"Sorry sir." Pansy said with a big smile but rolled her eyes at Draco when the professor turned away.
Two heads turned towards Blaise. A tiny grin appeared on his face.
Harry opened his eyes slowly and they smiled at each other.
"...Did something happen between the two of you? Did you have a fight? I swear to Merlin if you hurt him I will fucking mu-"
Harry nodded.
Draco didn't move or say anything, he knew Voldemort wasn't waiting for an excuse.
She didn't say anything. She just hugged him tightly but lovingly.
"We're not going to the game?"
Harry nodded. "Yeah, you have some catching up to do."
"Just. Just don't tell anyone. Okay?"
He turned around and grabbed her hands. Pansy stood up, raising an eyebrow.
Harry grabbed Draco's chin and made him look into his eyes.
“I know what you told me. But I'll help you find a way. I'll be here for you. To help you. I promise.”
"What is wrong with you?"
'Not friends' was better than 'enemies'.
'I-I don't know,' he laughed shyly, 'I don't think I'm the right guy for that.'
He kept hoping. Hoping that maybe Draco'd have a change of heart. Hoping for something or someone to save them.
But then again, Draco was the one to hug him. Hug him, of all things.
"What became real?" Harry asked, taking a step forward.
He grinned “What? Afraid to be vulnerable around me?”
"Do the smart thing and end things with Potter today. Obliviate him and be done with it."
He looked at Draco, still standing behind his mother.
He had mixed feelings about being back here. He still hadn't brought up the courage to enter the room You-Know-Who had stayed in, let alone the basement.
“Us? Friends? You and me?”
Spells flew around his ears and he fired some too. He would not let them stop him now, he was too close.
Harry was in shock but was too panicked to stop him. They stood there for a while, Draco holding him tightly as he couldn't help but smile at the scent of Harry's neck. It reminded him of amortentia...
They kissed again, Harry's fingers taking the hem of Draco shirt and pulling it up.
Soft crying. A dark figure. Then pain. So much pain. His chest tightens. The feeling of loneliness surrounds him. And crippling fear. 'You'll never be good enough!' He hears someone say. He tries to focus on something else, anything else. But there's nothing besides the horrible aching in his chest. He can't breathe.
Draco started fidgeting with his fingers.
They fell to the ground, the fire still chasing them.
He shook his head. "I'm fine. I was just... sad. That I couldn't go in there and kiss you. Or even just go in."
'Just fucking do it you coward...' Draco whispered to himself as he wrapped his arms around the trembling boy infront of him.
"Harry Potter... is dead."
He walked to her, the voices singing Christmas songs in the church in the background.
Ron turned his head towards them. "Honestly, mom has invited so many people, I don't even know half of them. I think that the one with the black hair is my third cousin twice removed? The other one is his husband."
"I'm just... going through something. I think."
Harry was staring at her with eyes wide open.
"Wait, like. Not at all? I haven't seen him but I figured he just tried to keep his distance from me or something..."
Draco started grinding his teeth as soon as Pansy mentioned Snape.
"Oh, that's a bummer. Then what did you do?"
"Of course we have time for that, it's an emergency. I'll talk to Dumbledore tonight and you and your family could go tomorrow."
"What is it Potter? Didn't your parents taught you how to answer a question like a normal person?" Draco grumbled.
Now, lighted by the fire, he could see every indent, every muscle and every mark.
Harry didn't speak.
Then, more Death Eaters entered, all of them encouraging Draco to "just kill him".
"I think it's what Dumbledore would have wanted." She explained when Ron gave her questioning look.
He started walking to his dorm when she continued talking.
"What?" Harry said confused.
"What's that big grin about, Dray?"
"The Dark Lord is getting impatient, Draco."
Harry caught a glimpse Pansy who was sitting down in one of the back corners. He knew she had to miss him too...
Harry raised an eyebrow "Oh. Okay..."
Harry stood frozen. Hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak and unable to move by the Body-Biding Curse.
"-but there's that Ravenclaw party tonight. I'll make sure everyone is gone and then you can sneak in."
"I know I there are some things that have to be said..." Draco broke the silence. His voice was sweet and vulnerable. "...about us, I mean."
"Currently in Islington, in my godfather's house."
"Great, actually. You know, given circumstances. In fact I... came out."
"I don't really wanna talk about that shit right now... Okay?"
"It's just... I know how you feel. I- I have them too..."
He looked at him questioning, 'Because I speak French?'
He was separated from the noisy crowd by a cold, thick wall. He felt so alone.
Draco reached across the table and took his hand. Harry didn't respond.
The boy grinned, biting his lip. 'You said it was your break, could I offer you a coffee? I mean you'll still have to make it yourself, but I'll pay.'
Harry swallowed, "Yes. I would like that."
“No. Shut up. Just go away.”
“Dray... Is that true?” Pansy looked back at Draco. He stared at her and looked down.
“Okay.”
Hii! This chapter will have just a little bit of smut near the end. Enjoy:)
“I had to hug him. Panic attack, remember.”
/// They have found each other, now they have to find themselves. ///
"What? Of course you have. I just gave you one."
"It does." Draco agreed, "Because you don't have to pretend to be someone you're not."
"Well? You said you wanted to talk?"
"Then what is it, can I see?"
Draco woke up about half an hour later. He felt Harry's arm around him and smiled. He rolled around and saw Harry's cute face. He gave him a soft peck.
He wiped away his tears as he heard the crowd cheer loudly. Pansy pulled away and sniffed.
“How would you know.”
“Are you responsible for what happened to Katie?”
Silence.
After having kissed every part of Harry's body, Draco pulled him out of the shower. they quickly dried themselves and put on underwear and pants. Harry was about grab his sweater when Draco stopped him.
"I couldn't do it, you know..." he whispered again. "Dumbledore was right, I couldn't do it... I kept thinking..."
"Well, can't they run away too? I'm sure the Order could find them a safe house or something."
But then there was the third.
Harry leaned forward an pressed his lips against Draco's. It was... weird. They were both surprised and half crying, not knowing what to do with their hands.
He rolled his eyes and tried not to smile. He failed.
Draco nodded. Of course this was okay. He had Harry all to himself.
"No. Not really. I mean, they know about it. I think. But I don't talk about it much. Not with them, not with anyone." Harry said as he leaned against the table, staring at the ground.
“Promise me. Promise you won't tell anyone. Not even your friends.”
“It was you, right? Who did this to Katie...”
But it was the best thing Harry ever did.
Draco was hurt by that but swallowed the lump in his throat and spoke:
"So you still wanna be friends?"
"Oh, can't a girl float around the castle, looking at the students."
"Yes." Harry said begrudgingly.
'Oh, you know. Pretty relaxed.' Draco said. 'Work was quiet. I ended up in a conversation with one of the costumers about... me? Specifically about me not knowing what I want to do with my life...'
Not only had he seen more pain these months than in his entire life, he had also caused more pain. Meanwhile he had become numb to it.
"I do not wish to discuss the matter any further. We have more important business to attend. Do you wish to come with me tonight?"
He nodded and laced their fingers together.
Would he still have been friends with Hermione? And Ron? Would he have been a better person? Or would he have been worse? Would he have met Remus sooner? Would Sirius still be alive?
"Oh... Okay..." Thank Merlin Hermione knew when to stop.
"Yeah I guess." He said.
"Leave Potter and go!" Snape said again, this time more bothered.
Instead of an answer he got another kiss. They smiled at each other.
'In the kitchen!' He yelled to the hallway as he took the lasagna out of the oven. A few moments later he felt Harry's strong arms wrap around his waist and his lips pressing against his shoulder.
Draco winked and got up, quickly making his way to the adjacent bathroom.
"It was a hide out for the Order of the Phoenix for a while," Harry explained, "Dumbledore was the secret keeper so no one unauthorised could get in. But now he's dead which means..."
"Oh shut up." Harry laughed, "It's not my party."
This startled him a little. “Well, ehm...
“Yes. I-I think I like him.”
“I told you... T-to go... away...” Draco he sobbed quietly.
Draco was sitting on a chair around the big black table. He could feel the cold steal through his clothes. His hands were folded on his lap and his eyes looked straight forward, fixed and the grey wall.
"Excuse me? Are you calling me-"
“...I don't know” he answered.
They were dancing and smiling at each other. Kissing each other or brushing their noses together every now and then.
"Oh. Right." Harry answered, the words hurt him more than he'd expected. "See you in five?"
Harry smiled. "Thanks, Gin."
"You're going to kill Dumbledore? Are you serious? What the fuck Draco. How are we even discussing this?" Harry stood up, his hand going through his hair.
"Just leave them, mate."
"Thanks."
He hated Draco.
Draco sat down against a wall, crying. He curled up and pressed his nose in the sweater, his tears soaking the fabric.
Draco took a deep breath. He looked at Harry. His was looking down at his drink, he looked bad.
Light switched on. Dark eyes with sharp eyebrows above them stared at him.
'Ehm, I should tell you that I'm in a relationship... I-I don't if that was what you me-'
"Shut up Pansy, Merlin." Draco hissed.
Your hug, your presence, helped him calm down. You can't ignore that Draco.”
Draco and Harry comfort each other :)
"What, no no! I would never. I don't know what could be wrong either. I promise."
"Draco?" He heard someone whisper. "Are you here?"
"Don't worry, dingus. We're totally gonna kick ass tomorrow." Ginny said as she plopped down on the couch next to Harry.
Draco was gone.
Draco waved him goodbye and started getting ready to go to his job.
'Except for me' Draco thought. It made him smile.
"I love you."
Harry walked to Draco and tapped him on the shoulder.
"You look, I don't have my glasses."
What do you think will happen next chapter? Let me know what you think of this one and leave kudos if you liked it :) Next chapter is already up! I upload every Friday!
Harry woke up. The first thing he saw was the back of Draco's head, his hair all messy. He looked at the scars below them, there weren't that many, Harry knew Voldemort preferred the cruciatus curse which didn't leave any marks. No physical marks anyway.
The door opened and Draco turned around to see who was there. Probably some first year who he could easily tell to bugger off.
Draco agreed and they quickly discarded their shirts.
He shook his head, grabbed a dark green shirt and got on his way.
'No, no, it definitely was,' he turned to Draco, 'I was telling her about the time I used yoghurt drink instead of milk to make scrambled eggs.'
He shook his head and entered.
He wished he could just enter, mingle in with the partying crowd and kiss Harry.
"So, Dray. What was the thing with Snape?"
Draco was waiting at the Astronomy tower. It was 8:59 and his nerves had gotten worse the past few minutes he had been standing here.
He stood there for some time, he had no idea how long, but finally forced himself to go to move to the bathroom. He figured maybe some cold water in his face would wake him from this nightmare.
He heard laughter coming from the dining room and recognised his mom's soft chuckle and Harry's loud laugh.
Draco sighed relieved. "Really?"
Harry wanted to see him so badly.
Hermione was about to say something but Harry beat her to it. "I think so too, Luna." He said with a smile.
"You need to act quickly, you hear me? Or there will be consequences."
"Harry, what the fuck?" Draco said as he quickly walked to him. He grabbed his arm and pulled him onto his bed.
He could join them now, Harry thought. He could just say 'I'm sorry I'm such a dick, I want to help you defeat him.' And everything would be alright.
"Draco?"
Now he looked so vulnerable. He just didn't know what to do. He needed to calm him down before somehing bad happened. Draco's had dreams about being stuck in a cupboard with Harry, but in those dreams there always was a lot more making out and a lot less freaking out.
It were two men, one with black hair, one with blond hair.
'You're okay, Draco. It's just a nightmare. You're okay.'
Harry laughed, "I don't even know her."
"I want you to leave. Now."
Him and Ron were walking to the Great Hall when Harry saw that familliar blond hair again. It was almost a week after The Incident and Harry was surprised how few reactions he had gotten. He thought Draco would've told the entire Slytherin house about his panick attack.
His face may have been disfigured but he had spent enough hours looking at him, letting his fingers trace his eyes, his hair, his mouth, to know it was him.
Then the silence was broken by Blaise.
But it was someone taller with dark hair and glasses.
"Fuck sakes, Luna. Why would you do that?"
Well, annoying? If annoying means absolutely cute, hot and adorable, then yes. Draco has had a crush on him since their first meeting in Diagon Alley.
"I'll meet you there, say, eight?" Harry said as he took a step back.
"Yes what?"
Harry smiled, closed his eyes and tried to sleep.
They looked at each other, smiling softly.
'Oh, please. Don't be so childish.' He laughed back.
"So she sent you over? Figures. I've been a bitch to her."
Torture, death, the most horrible people he bas ever met, and now the Lovegood girl was locked in his basement.
She smiled proudly "What's 'a little bit more'?"
Part of him had hoped that Harry would forget about him and move on. Part of him was so extremely happy he came to see him.
“N-no. It wasn't me. Why would I...
It was the morning of the final quidditch match and everyone was making their way to the stadium, including Draco.
"Yeah, that was really rude of you. You hurt me."
"Yes Harry?"
He was worried about what had happened to him and wondered what was to come.
"Leave."
"Wait, Potter. Hold on." He grabbed Harry's wrist. He couldn't stop now. He was so close to an actual talk. Why did he ruin it. Harry even called him Dr-
"Sorry Pans, it's just- Your face gets all red and cute when you're mad."
Harry grinned.  "Okay then" He said as Draco got on his knees again, resting his hands on Harry's hips before unzipping his pants and pulling them down.
"Are you okay Potter?... What's going on?..." Harry's throat closed up and leaned against the wall with shaking legs.
It was ten past two, a relative quiet time in the coffee shop he had been working as a barista. It was located in the quieter bit London, busy enough for him to keep his mind off of things, but quiet enough to not be stressing the whole time.
And now there was nothing holding them back anymore. He could kiss him whenever he wanted to.
"Sorry sir, I didn't quite hear you."
Harry raised an eyebrow at her, at which she rolled her eyes.
"I am so sorry for hurting you. I shouldn't have lied to you... or hidden things from you."
"Of course I have to." He answered. "Don't you understand?"
"What? No. Merlin, Draco can't you be serious for just a second? Never mind. I have to go anyway. I should've never talked to you in the first place."
“I thought we were on a first name basis?”
"Hi, Pansy."
'What subject were you thinking?' Harry asked as he took another bite.
"Mornin'" Harry groaned back. "We should probably get up."
"Ron, don't be so rude. We were that young once too." Hermione said.
"...okay. I trust you." She said, tears in her eyes. She hugged him tightly and whispered. "You're not a bad person."
“I can explain.”
"Don't come crying to me when he breaks your heart. Which he will."
"And you and that boy?" Luna asked in her usual dreamy voice.
"Draco?" Harry said as he walked towards him.
The figure kneeled behind him and laid her hand on his shoulder.
All he could do was fuck the boy he loved, and love him back, and hope that it wouldn't be the last time.
"Of course." Harry said softly.
“I did it.”
They made a sharp turn and flew to the blokes.
Harry kiss his cheek and pulls him down again, his arms wrapping around him.
Draco pulled away his hand and took a step backward. 'Shit,' he thought 'what have I done.'
She stared and him and smiled. "Don't you ever ignore me again, you hear me? I missed you. Now let's go some place where we can talk."
"So?" He asked.
“Because he's always obsessing over you, he's always staring at you during dinner and let's not forget the fact that your hug calmed him down in that, ironically enough, closet. Do you really think, I don't know, Grabbe's hug would've helped? No. It wouldn't have. Because he thinks he's annoying, which, let's be honest, he kind of is.
"Of course, Ms Malfoy." Harry said, a bit surprised.
He saw Harry sitting at a booth in the back, Draco made his way to him and sat down.
Harry heard the pain in Draco's voice.
"Ehm no one, Myrtle. Just leave it alone, okay? I have to go back to class anyway."
"Yeah," he said, snapping back to reality, "Hey, eh, who are those men over there?" He nodded his head to the couple.
“You better. Save it for Dumbledore.”
"Don't get me wrong, it's sounds amazing, but-"
Hermione hooked her arm in his and laid her head on his shoulder.
"What? When was that decided? Who decided that?" He could no longer hide the panic in his voice.
Oh, right, they're just called teachers in the muggle world.
After Snape's lecture two days ago he spent his entire night fixing the Vanishing Cabinet. He didn't want to do this, he really didn't. But what choice did he have.
"What?" Harry asked softly with that dopey smile of him on his face.
The battle of the Astronomy tower and what happened after...
He made his way to the door, getting some pats on his back and high fives as he walked through the crowd.
He turned around. He was looking at Narcissa Malfoy, Draco standing behind him shyly.
"We'll do things ourselves. You know, the muggle way" He had said. Draco had rolled his eyes but smiled.
He couldn't help bit smile when he said that and the blond himself got butterflies in his stomach when Harry said it.
He pushed Draco's chin away with more force than necessary.
"Of course I am."
Draco was walking towards him making direct eye contact, ignoring Pansy's rambling.
Everyone was looking at him.
"Do we have that in the wizarding world?" He half whispered.
Draco smiled. "Yes. Absolutely."
Or in the darkness.
"Pansy why are you so paranoid!"
Right?
"Severus... Please..." Dumbledore begged.
He walked over to one of of the tables to take the empty cup from one of the students, about to ask him if he wanted a refill, when his eyes fell on one of the books that was laying open on the table. It was filled with drawings and pictures of cells and tissue.
Harry smiled and turned him around. 'Obviously you,' he said as he pressed his lips against Draco's, 'and also the food.'
'Not friends' was better than 'enemies'.
"Harry..." Hermione said softly, the snow blurring her voice.
Because even after all he did, he still missed Draco.
He shared all of his stories and some more details ("Not too much, Dray. I don't want to be wanking and have Potter's weird body pop up in my mind!"). Then, however, Pansy mentioned something he wasn't prepared for.
His mother, Narcissa, was the one asking him.
He was pacing through the tower, looking up at every little sound he heard, hoping it was Harry.
"Where did you just come from?"
Harry was still standing still, looking at Draco. He was looking back at him, people were walking past them, going on with their day. But they didn't notice. It was just them.
"W-we need to get out..." Harry mumbled.
She was biting her lip and nudged her head towards the exit. Since it wasn't an important meal there were people going in and out every fe minutes or so.
Harry grinned, 'How did that happen? Did he ask for an americano, a chocolate chip cookie, and a existential crisis?'
"Draco?"
“Merlin relax. If you didn't do it to Katie then why have you been crying?”
Draco smiles softly in his boyfriends chest and closes his eyes.
"-we all sing: Weasley is our king!"
His eyes went black again. Harry was laying on the cold ground, his hands were touching the wet leaves of the ground of the Forbidden Forest.
The only thing keeping him sane was the Gryffindor sweater he was wearing, carefully hidden beneath his robes.
Harry nearly choked. 'You speak French?'
Snape ordered the remaining Death Eaters to escape. Harry pursues them further down onto the grounds.
Harry smiled and quickly took it off.
Ginny and Luna sat down on his other side. Luna was wearing a soft pink dress, unlike all the other people dressed in black.
"Anything"
"Don't make this more akward than it is." Draco snapped back.
It was quiet. The only sound was that of the wind and some of the dangerous beasts hidden far away in the forest.
"Unimportant. You are ready, right?"
His house no longer felt like home. He had taken over the most part. Every room now contained terrible memories.
Draco grinned. "Yeah, sure. I'll just ask the Ravenclaws to throw a party every night."
He was wearing his black suit and his hair was slicked back neatly. He was smiling at Harry shyly.
Harry took Draco's hand. "I'm glad I went looking for you."
"That was..."
"What?" Draco whispered.
"I am really sorry for what I did."
Harry had felt numb ever since he left the Slytherin dorm last night. He hadn't spoken to anybody since and had barely slept.
Draco and Harry talk about the future...
Harry stared at him for a bit longer than comfortable. "Okay. Fine."
If only he could have told Dumbledore about his plan.
That hurt. He hated the way he had acted when he was younger... Maybe he shouldn't have said that, but Harry had said something stupid as well.
"Draco? Are you alright?"
"Draco, go. I'll handle this." Snape said.
"Fine. I called you Draco. I'm sorry."
“Pansy? Are you even listening to me?”
They stood up and Harry was about to go around the corner, holding Draco's hand, when he was stopped.
"Don't worry, don't worry. Everyone is to the Ravenclaw party. Parkinson said she'd take care of it."
"No, no. Don't be sorry. Please. I get that you want to share this. Do you... Do you talk to Granger and Weasley about this?"
Tears ran down his cheeks as the torture continued. He screamed until he blacked out.
Draco thought for a moment, squinting his eyes. 'I could become a professor...'
"I didn't know what you wanted, really... I hope this is okay."
"I don't know what you think you're doing but you better stop it very, very quickly."
Did he fuck everything up?
Harry was happy for them. Really.
"Tell whom?"
"Ohw how exciting! Let me think, let me think... Is it Dddddddaphne Greengrass?"
"How is the assignment going?"
"Actually," Harry interrupted him, "I know a place. If that's okay?"
This chapter will have parts of the book (Half Blood Prince) in it near the end but I won't write them all out because I assume you all know what happens. Enjoy!
They needed to win by a margin of three hundred points to be first, a tall order and yet Harry had never seen his team fly better.
And so they finished their drinks and made their way to a dark ally, kissing each other again, their warm bodies pressed against one another in the cold of the night, before disapparating to Grimmauld Place 12.
Draco couldn't fully process what happened. How could he? And what was he supposed to do now? There were two options: pretend it didn't happen and never talk about it again, or do what he wanted to do for the past year and kiss the boy he liked.
"Can't we just talk about this?"
The door opened and people pushed their way in.
The students left quickly and Draco leaned against one of the tables, his nails carving in the old wood.
"Is he alive?" The soft but stern voice whispered. "Draco, is he alive?"
Draco looked at her, then back at Harry and walked away quickly.
'Oh, I recognise that behaviour!' Harry grinned. 'He makes the most amazing meals but I'm always the one cleaning it up.'
"Hmm... How about we lie here for another ten minutes, make out a little, and then get up."
He curled up beside Draco again and threw one arm over him.
'No,' Harry said, 'because you are amazing. And because everything you say and everything you do reminds me of how amazing you are. And because you're so adorable and funny and smart and because I've only really known you for two years, with a year long break, but I already know that I will never get tired of you.'
"What? No! Pansy, come on."
"Yeah, no, of course. Quidditch is all that's on my mind right now."
"I know, trust me, I know. It's all I can think about, it's all I allow myself to think about. Except when I'm with him. And I don't know what's going to happen but for once I'm actually okay with that. All I know is that these past few weeks have been the best weeks of my life. So can you just please let me have this?"
"I'm going away... There are some things that I need to do before I can defeat Voldemort."
Draco moaned softly as he slowly grind his hips forward, looking for any sort of friction.
"Yeah that's not gonna happen, Potter. If he won't leave his room to get food he won't leave his room for a bang."
"I wish we could do this every day." Draco mumbled in Harry's neck, giving him soft kisses all over.
This was what he wanted, right? They kissed. Harry liked him. Right? Or was this just because he was emotional? He never thought about the consequences. What were they going to do? They couldn't actually date? Right? They couldn't. What if his father found out? This all became so real so suddenly.
“Fine.
"Yeah. That." Draco smiled softly but immediately looked fern again.
Draco stared at the schoolboard in front of him, barely taking in what Slughorn was telling the class. The past two weeks he hadn't thought about anything but that stupid kiss. That amazing kiss. Harry and him hadn't spoken since that night.
“I'm not going away.”
Would he still have fallen for Draco?
"Dead." She announced. It was followed by a lot of celebration.
Harry got worse and worse and he wouldn't stop shaking. He looked horrible.
He sank to the ground and leaned his head against the wall.
"Using Amortentia to get Potter."
Harry, Ron and Hermione were running away from Crabbe, who had gone crazy. He had conjured Fiendfyre and it had quickly spread throughout the room, the stacks of hidden things already starting to fall over.
He took a deep breath. "I know this may sound crazy, but Snape and Draco are planning to-" Dumbledore cut him off before he could even get to the point.
'Oh I'm sure it wasn't that terrible.' Narcissa said, trying to comfort him, as she placed her hand on Harry's.
Or apologise.
"Fine."
He quickly sneaked into the dorm, which was still covered in confetti, crisps and empty bottles. He even saw a quidditch shirt from Peakes, one of the beaters.
"Mr. Malfoy, could you please answer my question?" Slughorn said.
"Y-yeah?"
"But I am your friend" she snapped, "and I'm worried about you."
Draco stared at the bulge in front of him and then looked up, asking for permission.
He looked back and saw the Draco climbing up a stack of chair and falling dangerously. He wouldn't get out of this alive.
Harry smiled and wipes away another tear. Merlin, he felt so awkward. He really didn't want to cry but what Draco said? They way he said it? It did something with him. He never had someone tell him that before. Sure, he knew what the Dursleys do wasn't his fault. Except, sometimes, he didn't.
Harry was startled by the high voice that was coming from above.
“Fine. What do you want Harry?”
"I can't," Draco said as he stood up, Pansy's hand falling on her lap, "I wish I could, but I just can't."
He went around a corner, ending up in an empty corridor leading towards the exit. He could already see and hear the crowd.
And so, Voldemort made his way back to the castle and told the army at Hogwarts:
At that moment he couldn't think about what Snape would do. Or his dad. Or You-Know-Who.
"Okay, you have 3 guesses."
Pansy grinned, "You should go and congratulate your boyfriend."
He nodded, “I promise. If you promise you won't... You know... Try to kill...”
Harry laughed at that. "I think I like that option the best."
"Or, maybe a bit more than friends?"
Harry looked around to make sure there was really no one else around, then whispered. "Draco."
Leave kudos on this chapter if you liked it and follow me if you want to get a notification when I upload a new chapter. Next chapter is already up!
"Thanks, Gin."
She took his hand and led them to a bench near the lake, far away from the quidditch crowd.
He wanted to celebrate the end of the school year with them, but he couldn't.
"I don't wanna talk, Blaise." Draco murmured.
Harry rolled his eyes. "Wow, that one was low, even for you."
"Crucio." Voldemort said as excruciating pain hit Draco.
The boys got in, softly grinding their hard dicks together. Draco moaned when Harry pushed his tongue down his throat and cupped his ass.
Harry nodded ever so slightly. Only she could see it.
Draco pulled away slowly when he felt Harry's breathing slow down and his arms relax. Harry stared at him awkwardly
He looked at the clock. Seven forty. He was anxious.
It didn't.
"No, I don't think so. I stumbled into this place on accident. I couldn't sleep one night so I just started walking around. I randomly entered a bar and I decided to stay. It feels nice..."
"Draco?" Pansy asked softly as she placed her hand on his arm. Her fingers resting on that horrible mark engraved in his skin forever, neatly covered with his long black sleeve.
Harry smiled proudly, 'Really? What?'
“I can't tell you... I-I just... I-if he...”
"Oh I'll make you." He smiled and leaned in closer
Harry was gone. Just like that. And with him all hope Draco had left.
'What's so funny?' He smiled as he sat down at the large table.
"Yes. I understand."
He didn't even know what had happened. All he knew was that the seconds that followed felt like hours.
The blond looked at him having a panick attack, which it obviously was, he had experienced enough of them himself to recognise one. Usually Pansy holding him tightly would slowly make them stop.
"Are you bloody serious, mate?" Ron yelled back.
Draco kicked him under the table, 'Shut up,' he smiled, 'I did actually figure out what I wanted to do...'
"Wait, does than mean that you own the Black house now?"
"Oh. We use the thorns." Draco said, finally answering Slughorn's question, "Although Zygmunt Budge suggested to use the petals since these will make the potion last longer."
Hastly flying over the fire that had now taken over almost all of the room, Harry yelled: "We can't leave them!"
"You've changed, Draco. You used to tell me everything, about stupid Potter, about your parents. Everything. But this year you're different... I don't like it..."
"I get that you're a horny sixteen year old, but really? Potter?"
The Death Eaters groaned disappointedly and made their ways to the dungeon, only leaving Hermione behind.
Draco's eyes widened. "Siris Black is your godfather?"
Every sound, every shadow, everything reminded him of Draco, Draco, Draco.
"Snape will tell me more tomorrow afternoon. All I know is that some Death Eaters will come through the Vanishing Clo-"
"Yeah I understand that much" Draco said annoyed.
"I will never-" Draco said, roaming his hands over Harry's body, "-get enough of this. Of you."
The Death Eaters followed them a few moments later. Harry hit one of them, Yaxley, he thought his name was, with a full body binding curse.
"Sorry Dray... Sorry I didn't mean that." He said, his voice soft.
Fuck, he still couldn't believe what they'd done.
"This doesn't mean anything, right? Us being on first-name-basis. It's just because the attacks. We're still... We're still not friends."
Draco smiled a little, but his father, for once, wasn’t the person he was worried about. He thought about the scary creature that had been hunting his dreams.
"Stop bloody grinning, I'm pissed at you!"
'Terrified.'
Almost everyone was talking about the upcoming quidditch match. Ravenclaw versus Gryffindor, it would determine whether they'd win the championship.
'He'd always leave the kitchen a complete disaster, however.' Narcissa continued. 'I should probably pay the house elves double to make up for the mess they had to clean up back then.'
"Oh, sorry, I thought you wanted to-"
They looked at each other. Then Draco turned around and walked away.
Harry nodded again. He could see the hurt in Draco's eyes.
Hagrid's Hut had been badly damaged by the fire.
“What? He'd be totally up for it. I can tell.”
"I missed you too." Harry smiled. "But you were the one who's been avoiding me."
"We just kissed. And then... a little bit more."
Ten fifteen. Harry knocked on the door. Parkinson had promised him that every Slytherin was out, but if she was wrong, well, he'd be fucked.
"Oh okay, should we come with? I'm almost done e-"
"Hmm I had thought I would do this later love, but this is a good occasion as any." His master said and left the bed and padded across the room.
He was thrust into for what felt like hours till he could feel he was about to come, from there! His first vaginal orgasm, His cock was also fully erect ready to ejaculate at littlest of motivation.
As clock struck 6 in the evening, wards signalled arrival of his lord. He opened the main door and allowed his lord to enter the home then promptly fell on floor and removed his lord's boots. He put them on Cleaning mat near the door and then stood and removed his lord's robe heavy Black robe.
3 was a lovely number and he wasn't going to stop till he had 3 children of his own. 3 Heirs for 3 titles and estates he had to pass on.
Then he was moaning like a bitch in heat as his husband expertly played with his body.
He felt his master's excitement under his thighs and felt his cock trying to respond but that was was naught. He still had that cock ring on it.
"We are going out on coming Friday at Griffin's Palace,  6:00 in the evening, Remember it and dress code is formal. Remind me on Friday morning." His lord said,
His master grabbed him and removed his hanging thong and the butt plug from his ass. He was lying on his master's lap now, face down, his master was still sitting on kitchen's chair.
"Okay master." replied Draco and continued sucking on his master's feet. his master changed foot while he was replying, now the foot that was previously on his balls and cock was in his mouth.
He vanished the leash and loosened his pet's collar belt a bit. His love needed to breathe. He removed the cock ring as well.
He licked some water and tried to eat his rice. He got them all over his face. It wasn't his usual neat style. But he was a pet right now. and pets ate in pet bowls.
Potter, Black and the title he acquired from his husband, Malfoy.
"Mmm thanks Husband, I'm sorry this labor just took a lot out of me." His ever compliant husband tried to give excuse for his tiredness. How cute.
He knew he had done many wrongs towards Draco, but his compassionate and lovely Draco always understood and forgave him.
His master was taking proper time to give him his birthday present, how can he be not thankful after years of his spoiled whinings.
He was in posture for so long that for once he thought his lord had forgotten about him.
Maybe this punishment was too hard after gap of many months. He would have to discuss this with his husband later.
After that he grabbed his husband's limp cock and started sucking on it. He licked and took the balls in the mouth as well and it was a very wet blowjob. If this didn't woke his husband, then nothing could.
With a wave of his master's hand, a blanket slid over them and lights turned off.
His master gently lifted him up in his strong arms and took him to the bed.
He felt his insides tingling. In a bad way. He didn't like object spanking! He liked his Master's hand on his arse. His master's lovely hands punishing and rewarding him. Not some wooden spoon.
He remembered his mother telling him once that all female elves were motherly. His own Female mother wasn't but Honey, his nanny elf had cared for him into his teen years.
"My Lord Husband is a good address as well. Hmm you shall address me with that for atleast a month now pet, I like it very much." He could hear amusement in his master's voice and wondered if his master would be fully his from now on.
No don't think about your son. Think about how could you be better. His master bought an elf in their home today.
He baby didn't look like much with pink shriveled skin, squishy face and tufts of wispy black on his tiny head with eyes closed tightly. He checked if his son had all 10 fingers and toes and then gave their son to his husband to hold.
"Seven, Thankyou my merciful lord" He said almost in awe filled voice.
Now he looked at his husband of 9 months and couldn't imagine a life without him. His perfect boys, both Draco and Jamie.
"Don't be afraid Doll, I won't be get upset at any questions you ask today." His master said not letting the little matter go anywhere,
He opened his master's trousers and took the semi erect cock in his mouth. he could never get the whole cock in his mouth so he fitted as much as he could while held his arms behind his back. His master's feet were now playing with his ass, smacking it with his foot whenever he felt like it. Draco felt totally owned.
On his way back down to the kitchen, Harry heard raised voiced coming from the room that Percy and Audrey were staying in.
“Well, he was there as Pansy’s plus one. They live together so it made sense that she would bring him. Harry felt his heart sinking and he couldn’t quite figure out why. Of course Pany and Malfoy were together. They had been throughout most of school and it made sense that they would continue their relationship now. Hermione gave him and odd sort of look and laid her hand on his forehead. She made sure he took his medication before she left and by the time she went, it was half past nine and his eyes were weary again. He let himself slip into a more comfortable sleep. This time he couldn’t remember any of the dreams he had.
“I think mum will blow up if you don’t get up soon, mate.” Ron looked just as tired as he felt, but there was an excitement coming off him that felt like static. Harry obliged and dragged himself out of bed, deciding to at least go downstairs and show his face so Molly knew he was there to help if she needed him. There was a continental-style breakfast laid out on the table that people could help themselves to as and when they woke up or were hungry. There was a slight orange sheen that hung over it, telling Harry someone had placed a ‘keep fresh’ charm on the food. There were cold meats, cheeses, smoked salmon and kippers, breads, preserves, honey (from the bees in the garden, Harry hoped), boiled eggs, different kinds of cereals, fruits, natural yoghurt and on hot plates there was everything you would want for a fried breakfast. There were two great vats too; one labelled ‘coffee’ and the other ‘hot water’, with a basket that contained a selection of teas and jugs of different milks including almond milk for Ginny. Harry sighed happily, grabbing a plate and filling it up with all of the delicious things on offer. He made himself a cup of tea and poured Ron a mug of coffee, adding three sugars to it and handing it to him.
He showered quickly, towelled himself dry and pulled on the shorts and t-shirt that he’d brought into the bathroom with him before venturing back into the bedroom, hair still dripping slightly. Ginny was laid on his bed when he got back to the bedroom, reading a quidditch tactics book.
I hope you’re feeling somewhat better than you did at our last meeting. If you still wish to meet, we can either try again at the coffee shop, or I can travel to The Burrow and meet you there if you’re still feeling under the weather. I don’t usually travel to meet my clients but I’m willing to make an exception for you due to your illness.
“Mind if I come in?”
“How’re things going with you guys?” Harry was genuinely curious.
“Leave this room, now.” George said through gritted teeth.
“Harry cut it for me. I think it suits me.” They crossed their arms firmly. Eyes flashing daringly at Percy.
“A tea would be lovely, thank you.” Before long they both had steaming drinks in front of them and Malfoy dug around in his bag, bringing out a notebook and a pen.
“Now, please explain your idea to me. You don’t mind if I make notes while you speak?”
“I’ll sleep on it. I want something edgy and awesome. Maybe some kind of quiff.” As they said that, they laid their head on Harry’s shoulder, contemplating different hair styles. He wrapped his arm around their waist and sipped at his tea. It was cold.
Harry felt much better that day, but he still took his potion as instructed by Fleur. She would be staying in the hospital for a few days for observations as a precaution because the baby had been born just over a week early, but they both seemed fine. His appetite was fully back, and he ate his breakfast outside while he watched Ginny train, giving them pointers here and there. Their try-outs were getting closer by the day and they’d taken some time off for the wedding and the birth of the baby, so they were on a very strict routine. It was still warm, and Harry lounged in the sun, enjoying the rays on his face. He watched the members of the Weasley household coming to and fro and decided that he should reply to Malfoy’s letter. He said goodbye to Ginny and went up to his room.
“I’m okay. Me and Ron have been decorating at the bungalow. Molly invited us round for dinner today and that’s when we found out you were ill. I’m kind of annoyed that no one thought to tell us before.”
Ron and Hermione got together at the end of the war. There was something about them that just fit. Hermione was strong and independent, and Ron loved that about her. He knew that she could look after herself and he admired her passion and drive. She’d gone back to Hogwarts to study and get the qualifications she needed to get the job she wanted at the Ministry. She threw herself into her studies as a way of dealing with her grief and as a way of proving herself to others. Ron stayed at The Burrow and looked after his mum. He cooked and cleaned on the days that she couldn’t get out of bed and he drew a lot. He would go out for hours walking and drawing landscapes. He drew a portrait of Hermione for their first anniversary and it was one of the most beautiful things that Harry had ever seen. He’d managed to catch her power, calm confidence and wicked mischief whilst also perfectly portraying her soft curves, perfect skin and gorgeous bouncy hair. It really was a masterpiece. After a while he started drawing up plans for buildings that Dean and Seamus were working on. They offered him a position in their business as a partner. He declined, saying he’d rather work freelance, but they would have first dibs on him if they ever needed him. It was tough for the couple at the start of their relationship. They were apart for a lot of it, only seeing each other at weekends and during the holidays, and they were both broken and grieving. They made it work though. The three of them spent the weekends and holidays that Hermione was back from Hogwarts looking for ways to fid her parents and restore their memories. It took them seven and a half months, but they managed it with the help of the rest of the family and the teachers at Hogwarts. Harry blinked a couple of times, picking up a handful of blueberries and anchoring himself back in the present. Ginny squeezed his shoulder supportively and left to go and find more cider for the rest of the group and gooseberryade for themselves.
After a while, Charlie, Bill and Fleur went back into the house and Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Dean, Seamus and Neville sat reminiscing about their days at Hogwarts. Neville had become a professor of Herbology at Hogwarts the year before after his Grandmother had passed away and was looking forward to going back after the summer. He adored his job; he swore when he took up the position that no child under his care would ever feel the way he did at school and Harry knew that he would stick to his word. He also wrote a plant advice column for the Quibbler and dabbled in landscaping and flower arranging in his spare time, if he ever had any. He’d been ecstatic when Ron and Hermione had asked him to do the flowers for their wedding. Dean and Seamus had brought Noodle along with them and the three dogs were bounding around the garden, making a game of who could make the biggest splashes in the pond. The group sat watching and laughing at the dogs, making bets on which one would run up to them and shake water all over them first.
“Please don’t put that idea in my head. Not Percy.” They shook their head as if trying to clear the image from their mind’s eye.
“Mr Potter,
“Luna has been looking for somewhere to stay in London. She’s opening a new office up in Diagon Alley and Tomas will be taking over the branch in Hogsmeade. If you’re looking for a housemate then I’m sure she’d be happy to muck in with the renovations. I’m sure she’d be glad of not having to floo or apparate, she says both make her feel sick. I doubt she’d want to stay forever though. She’s nearly got enough saved to buy a nice little flat somewhere.” Ginny had begun rambling a little, trying to justify their suggestion. They only ever seemed to get flustered when talking about Luna.
“Malfoy carried you into The Burrow in his arms. You should be thanking Mr Malfoy, not blaming him. You’re sick Harry. You need fluids and lots of rest before you go exciting yourself.” Harry nodded his head and accepted the drink that she offered him. It was vile, but he drank it anyway. His muscles and head instantly felt a little better. A small sigh of relief escaped his lips.
“Would you like a coffee, Mr Potter? Their dark roast is simply delectable.” Malfoy motioned toward a seat, offering it to Harry, but before he could properly register what was happening the floor was racing towards his face and the whole world turned to black. Grey eyes and the feeling of floating tugged at the edges of Harry’s consciousness, but he couldn’t drag himself back from the warm darkness.
Hermione and Ron arrived later with Hermione’s parents and fish and chips for everyone. They decided to eat outside as the weather had cooled slightly, making it a lovely late afternoon. The sweet smell from the flowers that Neville had been working on wafted in the air, and Arthur provided the group with more cider, but this time he gave fresh lemonade to the people who weren’t drinking.
“It went well. We’re meeting again in a couple of days when Malfoy has had a chance to look over the plans.” Harry poured the hot water into the mug and stirred thoughtfully. “I’m going to move into Grimmauld. I’m going to renovate it a bit at a time- starting with the rooms I need to live in- and live there. It’ll be easier for me if I’m going to work in London. It’s going to feel pretty empty there though.” Ginny made a small noise in the back of their throat and leaned forward in their chair.
“Dear Blaise,
When Harry got back to the kitchen, Arthur and Lucy were carrying baskets of vegetables into the kitchen from the garden.
“Okay Gin,” Harry replied, “So what’s the favour?”
“So, you and Luna, eh?” He managed a small smirk.
The Weasley kids and Harry decided to go out for a friendly game of quidditch before lunch, Fleur and Hermione watching from a blanket set up under a large parasol. Ron, Bill, and Harry were on one tea; Charlie, Ginny and George were on the other. The game soon became fierce and sweat was dripping off them all before they’d finished. Ron had become a pretty good keeper, but he was no match against Ginny. They were relying on Harry to catch the snitch, but the game came to an end before that happened when Arthur came out with a tray of his home brewed cider and two gooseberryaids for Ginny and Fleur. They were all parched and the cold beverages felt like heaven as they lounged in the shade, sipping and chatting. Molly was soon walking out of the house towards them, lugging the picnic that her and Ron had prepared the day before. It was spread out on blankets and everyone ate ravenously, and silence fell upon them for a while. When a lot of the food had been consumed and people were picking at bits that were left, conversation started up again and turned towards the upcoming wedding.
Harry decided to try and get out of bed and, while he was sill a bit wobbly on his feet, he managed it. He gave Fleur a hug before she left and she smiled sweetly at him. Bill looked nervous as he carried the hospital bag out to the car. Harry had a small amount of breakfast and a cup of tea, which tasted amazing. He felt better than he had done in days. He didn’t know what kind of potion Fleur had given him, but it was definitely working. Ginny went outside to train, and Molly paced the house, tidying things that didn’t really need tidying. Harry sat looking absentmindedly out of the window. He couldn’t seem to shake the image of Malfoy out of his head. He couldn’t deny that the other many was gorgeous. He was slender and tall and his eyes seemed to see inside Harry. The way that his long fingers had wrapped delicately around the stem of his wine glass at the wedding made Harry’s heart race. But they didn’t get along. How could Harry work with him on such an important project when he both disliked and wanted to maul the other man. He would have to owl Blaise and ask him if he had anyone else to work with. He decided that he would do it the next day.
Ginny came up not long after with some chicken soup made by Molly and some bread. He managed some of it, but he still had a very small appetite. He placed the bowl on the side and turned to Ginny.
I'm going off canon slightly here with the next generation kids, please forgive me for that.
“You’re meant to be nocturnal you silly bird.” Harry said fondly, stroking the small owl’s feathers before tying the note to him and sending him off. He’d never bought a new owl after losing Hedwig, but he guessed that he would probably have to get one at some point. He couldn’t borrow Pig forever, especially if he was going to move out to Gimmauld. He couldn’t believe that he was actually considering moving there, or setting up a salon, but when he thought about it, it seemed to make sense to him somehow. He sat at the kitchen table with a cup of tea and watched the sun come up. Ginny was the first person up, as they usually were. They liked to train early in the day because it wasn’t as warm.
I hope you are well,
Evening rolled into night and the day’s hard work began taking its toll on people. One by one the group thinned out as they returned to their huts or to the house to get some sleep before the next day. Harry decided to take a shower before going to bed to wash the day off himself. On the way into the house he saw Hermione and he remembered the words that Pansy had said.
“But..” Percy started, looking lost.
“But seriously Gin, I’m super happy for you.” They smiled a genuine smile.
“Not at all Gin.” He replied, moving the pictured to give them space to sit on the bed. They spent a little while looking through some more of the pictures, making comments about each one. Harry carefully put them away when they’d finished.
“Harry, not to sound horrible or anything, but you look like shit.”
Charlie had stayed at The Burrow for the first year, then he’d gone back to Romania to begin rebuilding the Dragon Sanctuary. It had taken George the previous four and half years to heal enough to begin working on the Wheezes’ products again. He’d been dating Angelina for a year and he split his time between The Burrow and her flat in London. Harry had graciously accepted Molly’s offer to live with them at The Burrow. Technically he was the owner of both Grimmauld place and Godric’s Hollow, but he just didn’t have the drive to fix either of them up or face the memories that they held. Ginny and Harry had tried being a couple again for a while after the war, but they came to the realisation that they just weren’t right for one another. They loved each other, but they were not in love. Ginny devoted her time and passion to Quidditch, and she was better than Harry could ever have hoped to have been.
“The letters.” They said, thinking carefully about their words. “I’ve been talking a lot with Luna lately. I mean, we’ve always spoken a lot; she’s one of my best friends, but we’ve speaking a lot more lately. I thought that she might be able to help me understand some of the feeling’s I’ve been having about my gender lately. I remember when she came out as trans when we were in school and I spoke to her about it a lot. She always seemed so secure in her knowledge of who she is, but I’ve just felt so confused for so long. I wondered if I was trans, but when I really spoke to her about it, I realised that there really was more than just male and female. She really helped me to understand that it’s okay that I feel like this and that I’m not just confused, and I don’t have to ‘pick a side’. The only problem is that I think I’m in love with her and I know she’s not interested in me that way. Or, I didn’t think she was but the letters have been getting more frequent and longer and I think we might even be flirting. But I don’t know. I don’t know if that’s just me wishful thinking or just completely making it up in my head because of how I feel, and I don’t even know if I just feel this way because she’s been so nice to me and I’m just thankful that I’ve had her to talk to and thankful that she understands me. But then again you’ve been super lovely and I don’t want to kiss you.” They took in a deep breath and looked up at Harry. “No offence.”
