He did not know what else to do, not when Teddy wouldn’t let Harry try to heal him. He felt helpless, unable to do anything more than murmuring soft words of love and encouragement, promising that Draco would be there soon.
Harry snorted, shaking his head. Now that Harry knew that his godson was spending time with Draco, he could recognize why and
Of course Draco’s relationship with Jesse was serious...why wouldn’t it be? They had been photographed at a gala together months prior, and now...
Taking one last drag from his pint, Harry stood from the booth, giving his friends one final cold stare. “For Teddy’s sake, I hope you’re right. I hope Malfoy
Harry glanced at the elderly man, hoping to find some understanding there, but was only met with disappointment as the man slowly shook his head. He swallowed loudly, taking a deep breath. Harry hated disappointing his godson, but he knew that Andromeda would have his head if he brought a Kneazle back with them.
As he reached the landing of the stairs, Harry could hear a soft voice, echoing down the hallway. It rose and fell, following the narration of a story.
Andromeda remained where she was, turning her head to observe Harry as he approached, sitting back gracefully on her heels. “Good morning, Harry.”
, Harry...” he whispered against his skin. Draco pulled back gently before thrusting back into Harry with such force that Harry screamed into the pillow. He quickly set a punishing rhythm, cock dragging across Harry’s prostate on every few strokes, sending sparks of pleasure coursing through his body. “Gods, you feel so good, Harry. So good for me.”
“Oh, right. Of course,” Harry’s shoulders slumped as he nodded in understanding. He hesitated, taking a deep breath, before quickly saying, “Another time, then.”
sounded in the distance, and all three of them turned towards the cottage. Silence rang throughout the garden, before a hurried voice called out. “Teddy? Aunt 'Dromeda?”
Malfoy froze, eyes widening as he stared back at Harry. Harry could see Teddy grinning to his side, looking back and forth between his cousin and godfather, but he could not tear his own gaze from Malfoy’s.
He breathed deeply, attempting to calm himself as his heart began to thrum against his chest, hope sparking within. If what Ginny said was true—if Jesse really wasn’t dating Draco, but rather
“Nothing,” Teddy shrugged. He reached for Gary, picking him up gently and placing him on his shoulders, then stood and grinned sharply at Harry. “Let’s start lunch! Nana’s not here. Can we make pizza?”
“Oh, right...” Harry nodded dumbly. Clearing his throat, Harry turned back to Teddy. “Sorry, Ted. Dra—er, Malfoy’s right. Crumble comes after lunch.”
Malfoy huffed, tucking his hands underneath Teddy’s armpits and lifting him from the counter, depositing him gently on the kitchen floor. “Do you
Teddy bounced in place before hopping after the man. Harry paused, watching his godson for a moment before slowly following. He had a sudden feeling that, whatever was happening here, he would not get out of it.
Harry propped himself onto his elbows, gazing hungrily at the bulge beneath Draco’s black silk pants. He fingered the band and began to pull down, watching enraptured as the fabric strained before suddenly releasing, Draco’s thick cock freeing itself from the confines of his briefs and landing heavily against his stomach.
Teddy cheered, pulling his hand from Andromeda’s and skipping down the hallway, while Andromeda serenely followed behind him. Harry watched them go before turning back to the kitchen sink, still full of suds with clean dishes drying neatly beside it, wondering what the fuck had just happened.
“Yes. I couldn’t very well tell Teddy we couldn’t keep Gary. Not with the connection they share,” Harry shrugged, choosing not to disclose the fact that Teddy had also been rather convincing at the Menagerie.
Harry paused in the entryway, watching as Teddy gazed up at Malfoy with such a pure adoration that Harry’s breath caught.
“He’ll be there, Teddy, don’t worry,” Harry said confidently, smiling reassuringly at his godson. “Draco just has to finish his shift, and then he will come to Grimmauld and tuck you in. How does that sound?”
Harry hummed, glancing once more towards the door of the room before turning on the spot, disregarding any proper discharge protocols, to Disapparate back to Grimmauld Place.
“Well, then. It’s just you and me, Ted!” Harry grinned quickly, pushing aside any lingering confusion. “What do you say we go see Ginny and the Harpies practice?”
Andromeda delicately cleared her throat, throwing a smug glance Harry’s way, before she summoned her things and strode to the hearth.
Andromeda let out a soft breath, leaning back in her armchair and tucking one ankle behind the other. “Certainly, it is not my place to reveal another’s intimate feelings, darling. I am merely stating what I have observed.”
Malfoy was helping Teddy learn how to control his metamorphmagi abilities. Why else would he do that other than to mold Teddy into a mini-Malfoy, to instill his own pureblood biases into Harry’s innocent godson?
Dean had, surely with the encouragement of Seamus, given Ginny a bright pink pair of jogging bottoms, apparently popular amongst Muggle leisurely wear, with
Why would Draco want to be with someone who lived in an old, shambly home? Someone who had an unfriendly house elf and a stubborn Kneazle. Draco was a bloody
Harry breathed out heavily through his nose, glaring down at Ginny before reluctantly nodding his head.
Harry rolled his eyes, his head thunking painfully against the back of the booth as he let it fall. “Of course not, Hermione. That is what he
Teddy beamed up at him, silver eyes glimmering with pride. He clutched at the handle of his training broom, knuckles turning white as he turned around. “Where should I go?”
Hermione waved a hand in front of her, as if dismissing her rambling and reminding herself to get back on track, “Anyway, the case itself is irrelevant.”
for weeks, don’t you? We are very nearly raising a child together—a rather extraordinary one—even if only on the weekends. If you are
everyone to think,” Harry proclaimed, his hands hitting the kitchen table with more force than he’d intended. “He’s sitting around, doing what? Nothing. Turning up at Andy’s home at all hours to corrupt poor Teddy!”
Draco hummed softly, tilting his head to one side as he observed Harry for a moment more before turning back to Teddy.
!” Harry started, voice faltering on a hoarse moan as a wet tongue lapped against him. His back arched, arse lifting to chase the pleasure as he buried his face into his pillow.
Harry caught himself glancing towards Malfoy more than he would like to admit. Now that they had agreed to be friendly towards one another, he found that he was still curious about how Malfoy interacted with Andromeda and Teddy—more so, even, than he had when he suspected the man was up to something.
“I know,” Harry replies, strained. “I know I’m the last person you would want to be bonded to, and the last person you’d want to have to spend time with outside of work, but they’ll fix it soon. And then we’ll just go back to how it was before. It’s– We’ll figure it out.”
Draco shoves Harry off his lap, stands up, and walks into the kitchen. His mind is blank, terrifyingly still.
“I also get my beauty sleep,” Draco says cheerfully, but he turns his face aside, his chapped bottom lip trembling. Harry moves across the room to sit beside Draco’s sleep-warm form.
Stretching out again, Harry checks the time with his wand and sighs in contentment; it’s Sunday, and  they have an unspoken agreement that on Sundays they have a lie-in and then drink coffee together while watching Muggle kids cartoons that make Draco adorably confused. As Harry stretches his foot pokes a warm lump on the end of his bed and he hears an agitated little chirp, snorting as he lifts his head to look at the vague Pepper-colored blob on the end of his bed. She stretches and rolls over as Harry flops back onto the pillow. He has time to roll over and go back to sleep too, and he nearly does before he catches the smell of bacon wafting from down the hall. He sits up, rubbing his eyes from a moment and absentmindedly patting Pepper’s head before shoving on his glasses and padding down the hall. He finds Draco in the kitchen, concentrating very hard on flipping bacon in a sizzling pan.
For the first few weeks, Draco told himself the feelings were due to the bond, though the Healer said there was no emotional compulsion. Before they were cursed the two of them were barely acquaintances, civil at best. But it’s hard for Draco to lie to himself when the strongest ache for Harry’s presence isn’t the itch under his skin, but the vise around his heart.
, the very prim way Draco asks Harry to fuck him. Harry doesn’t reply, staring straight ahead until Draco sighs. “You’re fucked up too, you know,” he says. His voice is flat, a surprising lack of venom behind the words, and for the first time Harry wonders if Draco is also exhausted by this. “I know why you never let me stay the night. Try convincing me to give you more of myself when you’re ready to let me in, too.”
“Yes,” Harry says slowly, because he does; they’re his favorite. As Draco swirls off into the kitchen, Harry blinks after him, feeling as though he’s missed something significant.
“You like that?” Draco murmurs, unable to tear his gaze away from the lust-blown pupils of Harry’s green eyes. He soothes his fingertips across Harry’s scalp and thrusts the tiniest bit upwards into the wet heat of Harry’s mouth. “You want to know that you’re good for me?”
“Come here.” His voice is raw and heavy, and I’m helpless to resist him. My thighs hit the edge of the mattress and he reaches for me tentatively before looking up. “May I touch you?”
Clutching a plate to his chest, Harry takes a deep breath, then another. He can manage being attracted to Draco. He’s gone months now, knowing that it’s just something small, and living with Draco isn’t going to change that. Right?
“I like that you’re soft,” Draco murmurs, and Harry believes her. “It makes you feel real. Like you’re something that won’t slip through my hands.”
you– Harry, you make me soup when I’m sick and give me your jumpers when I get cold and you wear the socks I make for you, even the barely sock-shaped ones from when I first learnt to knit, and I don’t even have to tell you when I’ve had a hard day because you somehow already have
“Because you do this to it.” With a flap of her hands, Malfoy moves closer to the middle of the sofa. “Fine. Come here.”
He lasts three days before he’s standing on the threshold of Draco’s flat at midnight, knocking hard.
“And yet you like me,” I sing-song, wiggling around on his lap until he bucks up against me with a whine. “Uh-huh, that’s what I thought. Now, your options.” I present the open sanitization box to Draco to look through as I grab the harness and slide off of him yet again, pulling down my pajama bottoms, then my pants after I check with Draco that’s alright. For a moment he simply watches me as I step into the harness, staring at the dark patch of hair between my thighs, his gaze hungry.
Draco gasps, gesturing wildly and nearly knocking over his drink until he can find words again. “I’m not
He cocks his head just right. It isn’t. It shouldn’t be. It can’t be. Take a step back, then another.
and lifts himself up, leaving Draco aching for friction. He shifts until he’s straddling Draco’s waist, purposefully avoiding brushing against Draco’s cock. Harry’s own cock is flushed and hard, nestled within the black curls between his legs, and Draco wants so desperately to taste him. Harry’s so slick already– Draco can feel it on his stomach. He shifts slightly, pushing his wrists up against Harry’s grip to no avail.
“Always. Always, with you,” Draco replies, and spins Harry again until he’s dizzy with happiness, cradled in the home they’ve made together.
“Mhm.” Harry stays still as Draco’s hand slips underneath the hem of her shirt. Her fingers trace a path along Harry’s stomach, digging into the fat at her hip.
“Do you think this is too much?” Harry asks her, but she just blinks at him with her big blue eyes. “I mean, I just think he deserves a space that’s his own, you know. And it’s nearly the end of September, when it gets colder he’s going to want blankets and lots of pillows and…” Harry trails off as Pepper gets bored of his petting and bats a lazy paw at his arm. “Hey, rude. Yeah, I know, it’s probably a bit much, but it's just because I like him. No,” Harry says, flushing hotly even though he’s alone with his cat who’s staring at him like she’s trying to see into his soul. “No, it’s because I
“Draco,” Harry says helplessly, coming to a stop next to the foot of the bed. There are long lengths of sheer fabric strung above the bed, pink and blue and green; something out of a dreamscape. He knows the sheets here, knows Draco’s body like his own. “Stop for a second.”
“Wait,” Harry gasps, pulling his mouth away just enough that the heat of Draco’s skin isn’t making him even dizzier. His head is spinning, thrumming something terribly overwhelming. He
“Well, I’ll just give you a rundown of the information we have so far and what we’re planning to do,” she starts, and by the time they’re both discharged Draco’s head is swimming with confusion and he is
“Well, but you like it now, don’t you?” Draco takes a long drink to avoid answering the question, and Harry snorts. Warm hands wrap around Draco’s feet and he bites back a frankly obscene moan as Harry starts to rub his arches. “Untruth. I’m a Healer trainee on general rotation.”
“You motherfucker–” Draco yanks Harry back underneath him and Ginny rolls her eyes, addressing the rest of the room.
“More than I let you see,” Draco amends quietly, and Harry goes silent, still trembling in Draco’s embrace. “Let’s sleep, then.”
“I have to get creative sometimes,” Draco mutters, trying not to look pleased as Harry tangles his fingers into Draco’s wind-swept hair.
“Okay, it’s okay,” Harry soothes. “It’s just in the loo, you can come with me. The lighting will be better there anyways.” He walks to the bathroom, Draco padding softly behind him with his hand still wrapped around Harry’s wrist. He sits quietly on the closed toilet as Harry rummages around in his medicine cabinet until he finds the potion.
“I don’t want to lose you,” Harry whispers, and he didn’t want to say that because it’s too much and it will scare Draco away but he’s
“Shouldn’t you be doing that during work hours?” Harry asks, his eyebrows scrunching up in the middle with worry. Draco tries not to think about how that expression is becoming more frequent on Harry’s face whenever Draco talks about his job– he can’t dwell on it. He has to have this job, because if he gets promoted, then he’ll get to put his name on the articles, and people will see that he’s doing something. That he’s capable of his own achievements.
“Well,” Harry says, more subdued. Draco tries to meet his eyes in the mirror, but Harry looks away. “Ready for bed, then?”
Draco rolls to face Harry. They’re both still naked; Harry’s length lies soft against Draco’s leg, strangely comforting. “Do you mean defining our relationship?”
“Draco,” Harry repeats yet again, and I can feel his breath warm on my cheek. “Draco, I haven’t– I want...” He trails off, and I tighten my grip on his arm, hoping against all odds that he feels this too, this tangible thing between us. I’m hoping on the stars, on my own name, on my soft heart.
“Burnt my hand,” Draco says, sounding strained, and Harry does turn around now, very quickly. Draco is clutching his fingers and glaring at the hob like it personally offended him which, Harry has to admit, it
“I want you,” Draco whispers, so quietly Harry almost doesn’t hear him. Harry sighs and presses his body back down over Draco’s, running a free hand down his upper arm, ignoring the confession that crowds up into his throat. Draco can’t mean it like Harry wants him to.
“I have to fix this,” Harry says, and that’s when Draco notices there’s a considerable amount of some sort of smoke or vapor coming out of Harry’s mouth everytime he speaks.
“Fucking gorgeous,” Harry pants against Draco’s cheek, and Draco can’t do anything but babble nonsensical strings of words,
Draco shifts on the sofa, pulling his knees up to his chest but leaving his hand in Harry’s. His gaze meets Harry’s, strangely unreadable– Draco usually wears his heart on his sleeve, at least when it’s just them.
He’s looking down at his fingers now, his prickly mask dropped. It makes him look very, very, young.
“She learned how to be human. She loved and lost and danced with her bare feet, and cut off all her hair at her chin.” Draco makes a small sound as she grabs onto Harry’s shirt with a tight fist, and Harry smiles. “She keeps learning, every day. Sometimes she remembers being cradled in the deep night sky, and wakes up scared, but she’s alway alright.”
“What–” Harry blinks, his thoughts sluggish as he tries to breathe deeply. “Draco, of course. Of course it’s yes, did you think I’d say no?”
Harry lets his hand drop and sits back. “I’m not following.” Draco closes his eyes for a moment then holds up his left arm, where the Dark Mark is on full display underneath his rolled up sleeve, and Harry sucks in a breath.
“I want to taste you, I want to–” Draco breaks off as Harry reaches behind himself, wrapping a hand around Draco’s cock almost absentmindedly, his impossibly green eyes still intent on Draco’s. He doesn’t move his hand at all, just rests it there.
“Are you cold?” Draco asks, leaning back in sudden worry. “You should’ve kept the blanket on, I completely forgot– fuck–”
“We’re attempting the curse-breaking tomorrow. Full moon, like Hermione said. Doesn’t give you much time, Potter.”
, he says. You just like being a brat, hm?” I pour even more lube over my fingers, ignoring the sporadic pulling on my hair. “I thought you wanted me to fuck you.”
enough for him!” Draco cries, squeezing his eyes shut tightly, and there’s a significant, lingering lull in the conversation of the brunch-goers around them.
“Oh, I’ve tried,” he replies, picking up the end of my trailing question. “You can’t really get leverage though, and like, when you turn the grav back on, it’s just, the come kinda goes... everywhere. So really, really not worth it.”
“What’s wrong is that the back half of my engines have melted,” I snap, already tired of being patronised. “And don’t call me kid, I am
“Of course,” Draco says, but then blinks as something settles in his chest, reassured. “Oh. I– yes.”
“Draco?” Harry raises his head a bit, a crease of worry appearing between his eyebrows. “What’s wrong?”
“Yeah, I know. You’re going to be like spaghetti for a while. I’m going to get you to drink water while we’re in the bath, though. You need to hydrate.” Harry exhales, then presses a kiss to Draco’s head. “You are so,
of Hary’s mouth is what does it. Draco comes with a distant shout, his cock pulsing in between the slide of their stomachs, his vision going black around the edges. When he blinks his eyes open, not realizing he had closed them, Harry’s face fills his vision.
wanting this is overwhelming, when Draco has forced himself to believe that Harry is simply good at pretending.
“What?” Draco whispers, turning back to face Harry. He’s trembling now, and Harry can’t help but wrap his arms around Draco, nearly crushing him with the force of his hug.
Harry doesn’t understand how they can be so perfect. Wonderfully curved, with that heartbreaking dip right in the middle of his top lip. Plush and soft, murmuring things against Harry’s skin late at night or on sun-soaked mornings.
But sometimes, being married to Harry Potter goes a bit more like this: being stuck at an hours-long gala, schmoozing with rich purebloods in order to secure funds for the Potter-Malfoy charity foundation, delicately stuffing one’s face with hors d'oeuvres in order to avoid probing, gossip-fueled questions.
“You think.” Potter repeats, exasperation back in their tone. I can almost hear the eye roll. “The Silver Swan is often used as a ferrying vessel. Unless you’ve modified the docking equipment, it’ll be standard.”
. He pushes Harry up a bit with his hands until he can lick up the underside of Harry’s cock, causing Harry to shake around him. Moving further back he licks a long stripe with the flat of his tongue before pressing the tip into Harry just briefly, exactly the way Harry likes, and yes,
“Yes,” Draco says, whining slightly as Harry slips his finger in. He tries to keep quiet, to make it easier for both of them, but– “
Dares are irresistible– Draco lunges. When their hands meet, that’s a flash of sparks that crackle electric through Harry’s arm. Draco yelps, but he’s grinning, eyes dancing as he looks at Harry.
“That’s the idea,” Harry says, pulling the dildo nearly all the way out before thrusting back in. Draco squirms, trying to push himself further down into the toy, desperate to feel full. “God, look at you. How long do you think you were at the gala?”
“I wanted to,” Harry says, and it’s so earnest that Draco sinks down to his soft new rug and promptly bursts into tears. Harry is there in a heartbeat, arms tight around Draco as he sobs. He murmurs unintelligible words into Draco’s hair, rocking them both slowly until Draco’s calm enough to speak, his voice rough.
“Well.” Draco’s throat is painfully dry. “I mean. If– if I have time, I suppose.” He’s fooling no one– Harry’s eyes had pierced straight through him earlier, right into his lonely heart. But Harry’s being casual, so Draco can be casual.
“I’m trying to fix Draco’s room,” he replies, and she stares at him piercingly for a moment before looking up towards the ceiling, clearly trying to fight a grin. “What?”
“Oh,” Harry scoffs, rolling his eyes. “No, you didn’t run away, you just left with a suitcase and refused to talk to me for three weeks. And what the hell do you mean
“Was that good for you?” Draco asks, and I roll over just enough to see his flushed lips and shining, slick chin. His voice is sweet and open, and I realize he’s genuinely asking.
“Oh,” Draco whispers. A small part of him wants to turn to the side, to see how Harry is taking this news, but his self-preservation wins out and he stares straight ahead, tracing his gaze down a fine crack in the plaster of the opposite wall. “That seems rather…”
for him to have such nice legs. I hadn’t prepared myself for that possibility, as I was busy trying to compartmentalize his very nice face.
He already knew that Draco’s job at the Prophet is demanding– to hear Draco talk about it, he’s basically a glorified intern who does enough work for two other staff. Whenever they’ve hung out before, Draco seemed bright and a little bit wired, but Harry thought that was just his personality. Barely two days into living with him, though, Harry can already see exactly how much Draco’s work affects every part of his life.
“Fuck me,” Draco says, his words coming out much more desparate than he intends. “Potter, you better
“Harry,” Draco says, pushing more insistently against Harry and groaning in frustration when Harry moves away slightly, flashing a cheeky grin. “Don’t be mean.”
“From the things I want.” Harry is panting, his breath warm on Draco’s chin. “Yes, I want to be friends, but I also want– I also want–” Harry breaks off to pepper kisses over Draco’s jaw and cheeks, not stopping until Draco is wiggling underneath him, trying not to giggle manically. It isn’t fair, because he’s
“Hey.” Harry hovers in the doorway, unsure whether to move further into the room or not. Usually Draco is already shrugging off his shirt by now, but he just sits, looking at his hands. Harry moves to sit beside him, leaving a small bit of space in between their bodies that feels palpable. The itch underneath his skin settles to a low buzz.
“I have– I have– Draco let me up let me up–” He’s frantic so you do, peeling your body from his. He digs his hand into his jean pocket and pulls out a battered square of folded paper. Eyes pleading, he hands it to you, watching as you unfold it. A photograph. It’s a photograph, you and him, wind-kissed cheeks pressed together, bright pink. He’s got one arm around your waist and the other triumphantly holding a snitch. You’re wearing a red Gryffindor jumper, your green scarf looped around his neck. Nestled in the lower corner is a scratchily drawn heart in red ink, next to Harry’s thigh. The photograph is still, taken on Hermione’s muggle camera, but you can still feel how alive he was. How alive both of you were.
“Hermione,” Draco says, holding his hands out helplessly. “I don’t think I’m the best person for this, you’re so much closer to him…”
Harry yells, lining up his cock and slamming into Draco much too fast and hard, but he doesn’t fucking care. Draco sobs sharply, going boneless in Harry’s arms as Harry fucks into him.
“So,” Harry whispers now, “I’ve been trying to make this as pain-free as possible for you. I’ll keep our relationship professional, I just thought…” There’s a small sound that may have been a laugh, but it warps in the darkness. “I thought maybe we were friends.”
“Harry.” Hermione’s eyes are wide, her croissant halted halfway to her mouth. “You know you’re not supposed to use it–”
“You should clean yourself up,” Harry says scratchily as Draco runs confident hands down Harry’s arms. “Or you’re just gonna stay sticky.”
“Skipping the foreplay?” I tease, but nod down at him anyways, and I can’t help the gasp that falls from my mouth when he lightly trails his fingertips over the head of my cock. He wraps his other hand around the loose harness, tugging me closer.
“Okay,” he whispers, and I feel his hand travel up from my arm to my shoulder to my neck, searching in the dark. His fingers reach my jaw, then my mouth, pressing down lightly. “May I…?”
Draco trips on his way out of Harry’s Floo, muttering a curse as he rights himself. When he looks up Harry is right there, just standing in the middle of his sitting room rug, staring at Draco.
“Your turn,” Harry murmurs, and before long Draco is writhing underneath Harry, bracketed by his body, blissed out at the sensation of Harry’s fingers in between his thighs.
“Hm?” Harry summons a pair of handcuffs from the drawer, the soft blue ones Draco favors. He’s biting his bottom lip in concentration and Draco wants to swallow him whole.
“Firstly!” Pansy replies, her smile wide and sharp. “Don’t shame people’s kinks. And we won’t actually know. We’ll just know who
Draco hums. “I’m relearning.” She doesn’t say more, so Harry doesn’t press. Draco’s fingers are impossibly soothing, and Harry lets her head be moved side to side, then tilted forward. When Draco twists the hair tie around the end of Harry’s braid, she hums in satisfaction.
“Yeah?” Draco replies, too turned on to parse the question until Harry holds out a palm and a mid-size blue dildo smacks into his hand, along with a soft leather harness.
“Are you sure? You don’t have much here.” Harry turns, surveying the small number of boxes scattered across the floor.
The spell indicates that only Harry’s arms are affected, and Draco doesn’t give himself time to be relieved as he slides Harry’s thick leather jacket off as gently as he can. He bites back a gasp as he catches sight of Harry’s arms, his skin dark against the bright white of his t-shirt.
“I know you are.” Harry snaps a hairband around the end of his braid and slides under the covers. “I’m sorry it’s worse for you,” he whispers, but Draco is already asleep, his shoulder pressed to Harry’s.
“I love you, too.” Harry kisses Draco’s forehead again for good measure, and Draco sighs softly. There will be time later to get both of them properly clean, but for now Harry just holds Draco, soft and trusting, the love in his chest almost too much to bear.
“This isn’t your fault.” Draco gestures vaguely at his face. His gaze is bright, darting across Harry’s expression. “That was someone– someone else's decision. I could’ve been more direct with you, I suppose. I was just scared.”
in me,” Draco snaps, and Harry freezes above him, then starts to laugh. The sound is rich and rumbles right through Draco’s chest, but he doesn’t let himself sink into it. He wiggles fitfully, pushing at Harry’s shoulders. “Don’t
As Potter looks ahead once more I take the time to study him. The moment  I’d stepped on his ship earlier I’d nearly fallen on my face; any attraction I’ve felt to men before now is laughable in the face of Potter. He’s short, much shorter than me, but clearly sturdy; his sleeves are rolled up to his elbows and his forearms flex as his fingers fly across the console. The white shirt he’s wearing is half unbuttoned, showing off flashes of a dark chest scattered with black hair and two curving pinkish scars, and he’s wearing leather suspenders.
“I adore you,” Harry murmurs into the fabric of Draco’s shirt, one of Harry’s endless band shirts that Draco scoffs at but still slips on to wear to bed because they’re irresistably soft.
“Trust me,” Harry repeats, and there’s a sudden wet warmth surrounding Draco’s cock. He jerks up into Harry’s mouth, certain for one frantic moment he will come instantly, but then Harry pulls off, mouthing gently down the underside of Draco’s cock with a hand cupped to the front.
“Can I come by tomorrow?” Draco asks softly once Harry puts the car in park outside of Draco’s run-down block of flats.
“I can see you,” Harry says, too happy for someone who has been magically blinded for hours. Draco slumps down at the end of the couch, dropping his head into his hands, the adrenaline finally wearing off. “Are you okay?” Harry asks, and the couch shifts as he moves closer.
“Let me fix it, baby.” Harry’s already reaching out, grabbing Draco’s hand tenderly and cradling it in his own. “Oh, ouch, okay. Let me get my salve from the bathroom, okay?”
Harry shakes his head, blearily opening his eyes to find Draco looking back at him, sitting loose-limbed and naked in between Harry’s legs. His long hair is pulled up in a high ponytail that was sleek at one point but is now a mess of flyaways, and there are deep purple lovebites scattered along his neck from before he had pushed Harry down onto the bed and summoned the rope. Draco smiles at him, just a quirk of his lips, and Harry can’t help but grin back, too happy and safe to do anything else.
“Yeah,” Harry says, pressing his lips into the back of Draco’s neck. “Okay. If you want crepes, we can do crepes.”
“God, you’re ruthless,” Draco murmurs, half to himself and half to whatever cosmic force is enacting its retribution on him now. But of course Harry is
Harry shifts, and Draco wraps his hands around Harry’s hips, digging his fingers into the fat there. Harry looks down, away from Draco’s searching gaze. “I… I don’t know if I can tell you.”
“I bet you’re so wet,” Harry says sweetly, keeping his voice low even as Draco manages to get a hand free and smack Harry across the cheek, sending hot arousal thrumming through Harry’s stomach and thighs.
“Hey, spaceman,” Draco says, knocking me on the side of the head, and I take in a gulping breath. “Everything good?”
“You’re going to sleep like the dead tonight,” Draco says with a little laugh, leaning down to press a kiss to Harry’s ankle bone. Harry hums, and Draco moves on to his other leg, repeating his ritual. He’s just as self assured undoing the ties as he is when he does them up, his bright eyes intent on Harry’s body. There’s a pattern to it that’s soothing– Draco slides his fingers under the rope, releasing the pressure on Harry’s skin, then wraps the length around his free hand. Slide, release, wrap.
“I just didn’t want to take advantage. And I don’t want this to be a one and done thing. If I have you, I’m not letting you go. I couldn’t. You’re too brilliant, and sharp, and fucking–
“No, shhh.” Harry wraps a hand around Draco’s cock again, unmoving, the sensation making Draco jerk his hips up, gasping as his ankle bindings pull tight. “Tell me about it.”
“Okay,” Harry says, and wandlessly Vanishes the cuffs back to the drawer. Draco goes boneless, so Harry helps him move his arms to a comfortable position on the bed.  “Anything else you need?”
“Mhm,” Draco says into Harry’s jaw. He can feel Harry’s bright smile, and everything feels terribly fragile, but
“I’m not upset,” he whispers frantically, not wanting Harry to misread his response. “I– I’m overwhelmed, no one has ever– thank you, Harry. Thank you,
“You didn’t love me,” Draco says right into Harry’s ear, close enough to be heard over the music. Under his hands Harry is trembling, heat wavering off his skin “Harry, you didn’t. Don’t say that.”
“I don’t need–” Draco jerks as Harry’s fingers skim down his jaw. He meets Harry’s eyes wildly, and Harry realizes that Draco is afraid Harry will hurt him again. The thought is a knife dug into his heart, and he keeps his touch light.
Harry fiddles with something on the console and then nods to himself, spinning his chair to look at me straight on. The pulsing attraction in my chest hitches up even higher, because for all his tight muscles and gaping shirt, his face is the real showstopper. There’s a bone white scar shaped like lightning that cuts through his eye all the way down to his cheek. The iris in that eye is milky white, the other a shade of green that doesn’t exist on Scorpius. The curve of his strong jaw seems to
, but right now there are gold rings on Harry’s fingers and lips pressed sunshine-warm to Draco’s temple, and Draco isn’t afraid of the dawn.
They're about the furthest apart they can be, and Harry’s skin is tingling. Draco blinks sleepily at him from the bed as Harry braids his hair over his shoulder, tucking in stray curls.
“Yep,” I reply. I want to get out of here as soon as possible, but I also don’t know this man at all. Crown prince or no, he could kill me and take my ship the second my back is turned. Though he did manage to fuck up piloting a Silver Swan, so that’s doubtful. He couldn’t handle a fraction of Hedwig. “You have to come to the cockpit with me though.”
The room was silent for a moment as Andromeda charmed the pot to pour two cups of tea. “Milk and sugar?” she asked softly, not waiting for a response before a two cubes of sugar floated from the bowl, dropping into the cups of tea, followed by a splash of milk.
“I am afraid that Draco is not here to offer his expertise. He got held up this morning.” Andromeda’s eyes did not move as she spoke, set firmly upon Harry.
Letting out a shaky breath, Harry forced himself to look away from Teddy—who had morphed, Harry had no doubt about it, to resemble both Draco and Harry.
“Oh, nothing,” George shrugged, taking a leisurely sip from his drink as he watched Harry, “This all just sounds very familiar, is all.”
Harry startled as Draco charged towards him. He reached for Harry’s arm, fingers digging into his wrist as he pulled Harry into an empty room across from Teddy’s.
. So now obviously he hates me. And why wouldn’t he!? Merlin, what else would you think of the man who wants your bloody perfect boyfriend?”
He turned his head, watching as Draco made his way up the stairs, trousers pulling tightly against his arse.
“Mm, yes...well,” a rosy blush began to spread across his cheeks, “I certainly couldn’t say no when Teddy was so badly injured, now, could I?”
Carefully, Harry stood, grimacing at the spasm of pain that shot through his body. Teddy must have seen it because he ran to his side, reaching out to hold Harry’s hand between his own. “Draco, help!” he cried, “Harry is still hurt!”
For how explosive their initial collision was, it rapidly calmed. Desperation morphed into tenderness, lips slowing as they dragged against one another. Harry drew his hand up Draco’s firm back until his fingers tangled in silky hair. He tugged gently, a deep moan vibrating from the man’s throat before Draco pressed forward, pushing Harry backwards until he felt the solid wall of the sitting room against his back. Harry rested his hands against Draco’s hips, grasping at the sharp bones protruding above the seam of his trousers. His fingers dipped beneath the fabric, searching for the warmth of Draco’s skin.
Harry lifted Teddy from his lap, standing up so that they could all say their farewells. As he turned, he caught sight of Draco, leaning casually against a wall, ankles crossed, elongating the sleek line of his body.
Harry clenched his fists together at his sides, pursing his lips and turning his head so that he could watch as Ginny helped Teddy re-mount his training broom. He had no desire to see Draco being fawned over by his boyfriend.
“Harry, can we get one?” he begged, holding the white Pygmy Puff in his hands. It stared up at him with huge eyes, and Harry couldn’t stop himself from cringing. He hated the little puff balls. As much as he wanted to be a good godfather to Teddy, he just couldn’t do this.
Harry stood, riveted as he watched them make their goodbyes. Despite having seen how gentle he was with the boy before, the comfort with which Malfoy displayed such casual affection towards Teddy was still a surprise, entirely unexpected from Harry’s previous views of who Malfoy was.
“Thank you, darling,” Andromeda’s smile softened with pleasure—and how did Malfoy know that Hydrangeas were her favorite flower?
“I promise!” Teddy called out, rolling over on the floor so that he could smile up at Andromeda while Gary pranced around on his stomach.
“Alright, my dear,” Andromeda said soothingly, “Draco is quite competent, of course. I trust that he healed Teddy’s bruises with the utmost professionalism and care.”
“I can’t stay,” Draco snapped, running a hand quickly through his hair, the normally pristine coif falling into disarray.
By the time Saturday arrived, Grimmauld Place was transformed, the once dull hallways now bright, sunlight reverberating throughout and bringing a warmth that Harry had never felt in the home. He had remodeled when he moved in after the war, trying to make it less gloomy, but it had never seemed as alive, as welcoming, as it did now.
“Can we go home now?” Teddy walked into the room, one hand reaching to grasp at Harry’s fingers as the other reached for Draco’s, looking up at both of them with wide eyes. “Please?”
His fingers twisted in the sheets and he turned his face into the pillow, trying to stifle his moans as Draco masterfully rolled his hips, working his way in to the hilt. When he finally paused, balls resting heavily against Harry’s arse, Harry shuddered. Draco let out a shaky breath, running a hand soothingly along Harry’s back and leaning forward to press an open-mouthed kiss against Harry’s sweaty neck.
“Yes, I do believe I understood that,” Draco said flatly. Harry hesitated before looking back at Draco, only to find the man gazing at him with amusement shining in his eyes. “Harry...If you think that I did not already know that Teddy spent Sunday mornings with the Weasleys, you are even more daft than I originally thought.”
for trouncing you so thoroughly!”—Teddy suddenly let out a loud yawn, his jaw cracking as it widened.
“Of course, darling. Now, behave for Harry,” Andromeda ran a hand through Teddy’s turquoise locks before making her way around the kitchen table. She paused briefly next to Harry, placing a firm hand on his shoulder and squeezing, just once, lips twitching in a smirk as she strode out of the kitchen.
Chuckling, the man nodded, reaching for his wand and waving it before the barrier. It shivered, a small archway forming at the bottom. With a flick of its tail, the Kneazle gracefully leapt from its perch, landing on all four paws in front of the archway, before striding through it and stopping at Teddy’s feet, gazing up with curious green eyes.
Harry froze, staring blankly at Malfoy. He had been certain that he was being discreet. He hadn’t followed Malfoy around like he had in sixth year; he had only asked a few questions, arrived a little early on Saturdays.
“Well...I know you normally spend time with Teddy until after lunch. Isn’t this cutting into that time?” Harry faltered, wondering why he even
Harry choked, coughing as tea spewed from his mouth, some dripping out of his nose. He was sure that his face was as red as a blast-ended skrewt for how hot he suddenly was. Setting his tea beside him, the china clattering loudly against the furniture, Harry took a few moments to gather himself. He took deep, slow breaths in an effort to soothe his aching lungs.
He was quite happy as he was, here, with Teddy and his friends. In fact, he realized, he was happy whenever he was with Teddy—at the Burrow, at Grimmauld Place, and even at Andromeda’s cottage.
At least Draco would be easy to find. Harry knew he had a shift at St. Mungo’s on Monday’s, so they could Apparate there and Draco would have everything needed to heal Teddy. “Can I pick you up? Or do you need me to levitate you?”
“Of course not.” Draco heaved a deep sigh, lifting up from the ground and hovering within arms reach of Harry. “She demanded that we strike a bargain—the likes of which I will
Harry watched, helpless as he flew towards the boy—too far away. Teddy’s grey eyes shimmered with fear as his hands lost their grip on the training broom, arms windmilling frantically in the air as he began to fall.
Teddy’s breath stuttered as he attempted to quiet his sobs. His lower lip trembled, hands reaching to Harry, “Up, please.”
Not bothering to warn the creature, Harry Disapparated, landing just outside of Andromeda’s front door with a
“Fine,” Teddy whined, kicking gently at the kitchen floor. He turned one last pleading look towards Harry, silver eyes glimmering, before Malfoy swiftly interrupted any attempt at subterfuge.
“Er, yes...but I was wrong, Draco. I know that, now.” He took a deep breath. “I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have acted like such a twat. But I
Draco stood in the doorway, a halo of light from the hallway highlighting his figure, bright eyes frantic as they flickered around the room, settling on Teddy immediately. His platinum hair was a mess, strands sticking up in every direction, cheeks flushed and breath heavy, as if he had ran down the corridors in his haste to get to them rather than pausing to Apparate.
Harry reached out, gently tracing the dimple that appeared in Draco’s cheeks, as he quietly replied, “Hello.”
but Harry quickly drew a line through it. As much as he adored Luna, he knew that working at her sanctuary was not a career he wanted to pursue.
Harry now spent his days caring for Teddy. He had given up searching for a career, knowing that he was more fulfilled raising his godson and helping with Quidditch Camp every month than he would be doing anything else.
“Aunt ‘Dromeda!” Malfoy’s voice spoke above him, higher than normal and sounding choked. “Have you finished your painting?”
“Surely, Master Harry has clean clothes in his wardrobe,” Kreacher grumbled, slowly making his way to the door, “Master Harry’s blood traitor friend brought him clothes while he was washing. Kreacher did not touch it.”
Inhaling quickly, Harry cleared his throat. He squeezed his eyes shut, breathing slowly in an attempt to calm his suddenly rapid breaths.
“What?” Draco’s steely gaze snapped back to Harry, eyes wide and pink lips parted. His cheeks were flushed—whether from his efforts to get to Teddy or from Harry’s statement, Harry was not sure—and Harry could not help but notice the light smattering of freckles across Draco’s cheeks that stood out against the blush.
Draco chuckled, low and deep as he grinned sharply. “Sweet Salazar, Potter...what do you think we’ve been doing for the past few weeks?”
Beer sloshed over the rim of his pint as Harry slammed it back onto the table. The noise of the bar was distant in the protection of the modified
Teddy heaved a dramatic sigh, flinging his arms over his head, and Harry could not stop himself from snickering. Teddy had certainly developed a flair for the dramatic, and Harry suspected he learned it from his cousin.
at me, and I know there’s nothing you want more than to be at my side. There’s no rush, there’s no obligation for– for physical affection. You could simply hold me on the couch all night and I’ll be happy. We’re still allowed
“Bloody hell, that’s too many crises to have at once. Up you get,” Harry says, and a warm hand pulls me onto the bed. For a long time I just sit, shaking, crying. I
“Harry!” Hermione’s voice is frantic, her hand wrapped around his shoulder. He can feel the pressure from each of her fingertips. “I just got Draco to St. Mungo’s. I’m going to bring you there now.”
He crooks his fingers again and I melt into the bed, tightening my hold on his curls. “I just want you to enjoy yourself too–”
“Shhh.” Very slowly, Harry begins to thrust his fingers again. “Shh, pet, let me make sure you’re ready.”
, so this is what they do. Harry demands an answer, gives Draco a chance to catch his breath and think about it, and they either move on or renegotiate.
“When I quit the Auror trainee program, Kingsley asked me if I would be up to working on something completely different for the Ministry. I wasn’t… I didn’t quit the Aurors because of the Ministry, or anything, I was just having panic attacks and wild magic outbursts and– anyways, he said I could really help people with the strength of my magic.” Harry presses his mouth hard to Draco’s neck, his breath warm through the soft fabric of Draco’s shirt. “When he told me I would be fixing leylines it didn’t sound too hard. I told him I’d do it, because the Ministry had lost anyone else who could fix it in the Ministry raids during the war, but the leylines are affecting wixen all over. It has to be top secret, which is why I have to heal myself and can’t go to St. Mungo’s. I know it hurts, but I’m the only one who can help. So,” Harry shrugs, “here I am.”
“Dying!” Harry all but yells, pacing across the floor in front of Hermione, who’s seated on her couch and watching him with worried eyes. “It’s a blood curse someone put on him right after the war, he’s known the whole time but it hadn’t manifested until a few months ago, and there’s–” Harry breaks off, breathing hard. “There’s no countercurse. He’s looked for five
“It has to be,” Draco states fiercely, snapping his gaze up to Harry’s, eyes glittering. “I can’t do anything about it and I– and I–
“I thought you would be upset.” Draco’s voice is so small, the way it gets when he’s terrified. “I thought– I thought– I just want to be so good to you, Harry, and I–” He breaks off with a small sob and Harry rocks them gently side to side, rubbing his hand in circles over Draco’s back.
“Tell me,” Harry says, low in his throat. “Tell me what this was like, to have this inside you at the gala.”
“Yellow,” Draco gasps, and Harry stills immediately, his cock buried in Draco. “I’m– I’m sorry, I just–”
“You good?” Harry asks, taking another bite of toast and not bothering to turn around. Dramatics are a given in this household, and Harry’s long since learned not to be phased by it.
For a wild moment Draco wants to laugh at Harry’s politeness while on the brink of orgasm, but then he nods. Harry says something inaudible and the invisible band around Draco’s cock
Afterwards, Draco lays against Harry’s bare chest, her hair sticking to Harry’s skin. They’re clean and warm, the sated tenderness of the moment making Harry's eyelids heavy.
“Draco?” Harry murmurs when she opens it, staring at Draco where she stands pale and trembling in her white nightgown. “Are you alright?”
at him in so long, and Harry Potter doesn’t look anything like the scrawny, war-torn boy who testified for Draco four years ago. No, he’s a man now, a head taller than Draco– though that isn’t hard to manage, thanks to the fact that Draco hit his current height somewhere around fourth year– and built like he could throw people around if he really wanted to. But his hands, while insistent, were gentle on Draco’s hips.
He hums in happiness and quicker than I expect my orgasm is buzzing up through my thighs, bursting into pleasure as he works me through it with warm, wet lips. Someone is moaning, and I have a suspicion that it’s me. Eventually I pull off of him, shuddering with overstimulation and crumpling boneless by his side.
The first time they fuck, in the upstairs bathroom of Pansy’s new townhouse, it’s sloppy and frantic. Harry whispers
“It could be…” Draco sniffs, and Harry realizes he’s crying again, silvery tears sliding down his cheek. “It could just be because we have to do this, and that makes you feel–”
The reality of his own words is flooding Harry’s mind, replaying every moment he forced himself to step back as Draco’s relationships fell apart, then held out his hands to pick up the pieces. “You’re so– you need someone who can be kind and gentle with you and I’m– I’m afraid I won’t be, I’m afraid I’ll hurt you, that I’d be too protective or overbearing or
Before Harry leaves, he presses his hand to Draco’s jumper-clad bicep. His grip is firm, and something about it, the casual touch and the proximity of Harry’s smile, shakes Draco to his core.
When Harry raises his head, he sees tear tracks down Draco’s cheeks, still glittering. Draco is slumped against Harry and the dresser, his breath coming in little pants through his nose. There are angry red marks dug into his cheek when Harry pulls his hand away, perfectly finger-shaped imprints of what Harry has done. Blood wells to the surface of his shoulder, a small red pearl.
Harry shrugs. “I’m back in London permanently. And that was the best sex I’ve ever had. I wouldn’t be opposed to getting you in my bed again.”
about you. What you need is to take care of yourself and let your friends into your life and let me–” Draco pauses, trying to find the words for his terrifyingly big feelings. “I want to be here. For you. And you need to
“Yeah,” he says, his voice low against my lips. “I do want. Just wanna point out that you said grav.”
“Well…” he licks his lips, and I reach down, pressing my thumb to his bottom lip, marveling at its softness. He smiles, a crooked thing. “I like being– taken care of. Not having to lead. To be …” he flushes, pink spreading from his cheeks to his neck. “I’d rather like to be fucked.” His voice is prim around the word and heat thrums sharp in my groin.
“You like this,” Harry says sweetly into Draco’s ear. The chain clinks as he wraps the end around his palm and buries his hand into Draco’s hair, pulling his head up off the sheets.
Hermione smiles at him, that bright smile that makes her look years younger. “Alright, git, back into the fray.”
“He needs someone who isn’t afraid of what he’s capable of!” Draco shouts, slamming a hand down on the roof of the frankly
“Let me at least get to the bed,” Draco says, the end of his sentence lost into Harry’s mouth. Harry groans in protest, biting down on Draco’s bottom lip insistently. The molding of their bedroom doorway digs hard into Draco’s back, but he stops caring as Harry presses a hand to the underside of his thigh. He hooks Draco’s leg around his hip, giving him a better angle to press his body against Draco’s clothed, aching cock.
Draco squirms, trying to keep his breathing steady. “Suck my cock,” he says, too needy to be a demand, and when he comes down Harry’s throat and murmurs
“You’re gagging for it,” he says quietly, reverently. Draco squirms underneath the scrutiny of Harry’s gaze; there’s nearly too much adoration for him to handle, right now.
The day of Harry’s first art exhibition, he’s a nervous wreck. He comes through Draco’s floo, claiming he left his nice shoes in Draco’s flat, but then just sits on the sofa and clenches his fists for a while as Draco flutters around with tea. Eventually, Draco sits down beside him, wrapping a hand around Harry’s knee.
When Draco pads back into the living room, Harry’s eyes are cracked open, glittering in the light of the lamps Draco had turned on to read. Draco kneels on the floor by Harry and grabs Harry’s face in his hands.
the struggle, likes trying to get away from Harry, and Harry wants what Draco wants. “You– you don’t get to
“They do,” I say, trying not to sound stiff. “All of them.” If I had any friends, I would flay myself alive before letting them call me
“We can be gentle like this, too,” Draco murmurs, sliding Harry’s shirt down her shoulder. “If you want.”
“Shh. It’s alright.” Harry wraps her arm around Draco, pulling her closer, self-consciousness be damned. Though Draco is taller, she presses her head underneath Harry’s chin and Harry feels like she’s protecting something very precious, very delicate. Draco’s hair smells like vanilla, and Harry holds her tighter.
“Don’t apologize, baby.” Harry keeps his voice gentle, dropping the mock-sweet tone he’s used this whole time. “We have safewords for a reason. What do you need?”
“You… you stayed for breakfast,” Harry says softly, and his hurt is so much worse than his anger. “You asked me about my day. I listened when you talked, because I was interested in what you had to say. I…” Harry makes a wet sound, the dim light glinting off his glasses for a second. “Okay. You know what? Fine. I should’ve known that you– that I wouldn’t be enough.”
“He said he couldn’t help it. He didn’t mean to,” Draco says, his eyes still closed and his voice still unsettlingly light. “He just couldn’t help it.”
“Maybe,” Harry says with a grin. His shirt is rucked up around his hips and his jean flies are open, revealing tight black pants. “Wrists, please.” Draco complies, flexing his wrists slightly just to test the sensation as Harry guides his hands onto the pillow above his head. “Keep those there.”
Humming in my throat, I lean closer to the display and rotate the rendering of the ship with the pads of my fingers. Weird. “This doesn’t look like a ship that should be out this far.”
They’ve slept in the same bed since Nashville, when Harry stormed out of the room without thinking and Draco blacked out; Harry couldn’t stop crying when Draco came to. With his arms wrapped around Draco to stop his shaking, any lingering anger melted into reluctant relief that he wasn’t alone.
and expect me to have the resources to treat your clearly magical burns. This could have been so much worse. Why didn’t you go to Saint Mungo’s?”
“God,” Draco gasps, losing himself momentarily as he shudders in pleasure. “God, no, I’m not– I don’t
I choke on my inhale then laugh, keeping my hands on his warm skin, touching him the way I’ve wanted to since the moment we met. “Bossy. You’ve done this before, then?”
“You want it,” Harry says, yanking Draco’s trousers and pants down to his knees in one smooth motion, the trouser button pinging on the floor somewhere. He wandlessly summons lube and pushes a finger into Draco without warning, even as Draco
“Alright,” I reply, unsure how to explain that this works perfectly because I need to sleep further away from the door or else I feel too exposed. Growing up with the threat of assassination can do that to you. Not that I was constantly under threat, just… the dangers of being royalty. Or at least a
The person– Potter– mutters something to themself. “Are you the only one on the ship?” they ask, that cursory tone back in their voice like they’re reading off of a list of memorized questions.
Yet here he is, frozen in panic while Harry lays beside him, tucking his chin against Draco’s shoulder. Draco startles as the soft material of the flannel touches his stomach, but as Harry starts to rub small circles he relaxes into the sensation. When Draco is sufficiently clean, Harry tosses the flannel onto his bedside table and nuzzles his nose into the crook of Draco’s neck.
It’s the first thing Harry thinks when he wakes up now, stretching out on the bed before rolling onto his side, unable to stop his grin.
“You have to be touching,” Lila says evenly, like she isn’t shattering Draco’s carefully maintained grip on his own feelings. “Skin to skin contact. Contact through clothing doesn’t work very well, I’m afraid.”
“There’s a one million unit reward on your head,” I say, and his body goes entirely still. “If you’re returned to Scorpius alive and unharmed.”
“Draco?” Harry calls, his voice thin. Draco grips onto the edge of his sink, hard enough that his knuckles go white, and when he looks up at his own reflection in the window he understands what this is.
“So help me, I do,” Harry replies, still chuckling. Where his body meets mine I can feel slickness, so I wiggle underneath him until I feel his cock slide across my skin and he gasps.
“Your mouth looks like it was made to suck cock,” I murmur, peppering kisses to his collarbone in between my words. “Heart shaped and decadent.”
Harry is frozen in disbelief, uncomprehending of Draco’s lips on hers, and it’s only when Draco starts to pull away that Harry realizes what’s happening and shoves her hands into Draco’s hair, chasing her mouth until they’re kissing again. Every line of Draco’s body is sharp but her lips are so impossibly soft, moving tentatively against Harry’s, and Harry never wants this to end. She wants to kiss Draco every second for the rest of her life, because Draco is making the tiniest noises, and her hair is incredibly soft, and she tastes like strawberries. Eventually Draco pulls away but doesn’t go far, panting against Harry’s slack mouth.
“God.” There’s teeth dug into Draco’s skin for the barest moment, then Harry pushes his thigh between Draco’s and everything is stars, stars, stars. “Can I tell you what I’m going to do to you?” Draco gasps out something affirmative, something desperate, and Harry’s mouth is by his ear, his fingers still digging into Draco’s hips. “I’m going to take you to bed, and ride you until you scream,” Harry murmurs. “Tomorrow you’re going to wake up in my arms, and I’ll kiss you slow and fuck you even slower. And I’m going to tell you every day that you’re more than good enough for me, until you believe it the way I do, right down to my core. How does that sound?”
“Let me get more lube,” Harry says quietly against Draco’s neck. “And a pillow for you.” Draco just nods, too overwhelmed to speak. Harry settles smug between his thighs, Draco’s legs hooked over his arms.
“Not many,” Draco responds as he follows Harry to his new room, formerly Harry’s guest room. On sunny days the room stays bright thanks to the large windows, but it currently sits dark and gloomy. Harry throws up a small wandless
“You’re mad,” Draco says, but a crooked grin is working its way onto his face. He has a single dimple, and Harry wants to press his tongue into it, to experience Draco’s pretty face–
It’s the combination of Harry’s soothing tone, his hot forehead pressed to Draco’s, and the ghosts of a nightmare still lingering that sends Draco into short, gasping sobs.
“You want me. You want me to be yours.” Draco rolls his hips again, laughing breathlessly as Harry slides his hips forward slightly. “Oh god, you want me, you–
did that, because he wanted to. He had Draco in his palms, blind to what Draco was giving him, and he had fucking drawn
“Harry,” Draco says an indeterminate amount of time later. Harry glances at him, taking in his thin pink lips, the furrow in his brow. Draco only calls him Harry when he’s exhausted, but he looks very awake right now.
” Draco shouts as Harry shifts down between his knees, sliding in a finger up to the knuckle, thumbing over the tip of Draco’s cock. They had negotiated this earlier, too– Draco usually prefers anal, but sometimes he wants to be fucked here, and Harry
“Would you like…” Harry swallows hard as Draco watches her with wide eyes. She looks luminescent in the faint moonlight spilling in through the window, all long lines, her skin glowing as white as her nightgown. Harry feels plain and small next to her, terribly conscious of her ratty boxers. “Would you like me to hold you?”
“Tap my thigh if you need me to get up,” I say breathlessly, bracing my forearm against the wall and resting my forehead on it. Furrowing his brows, Draco hollows out his cheeks as if I’d issued him a challenge, and I try to drag in air. What does he like? Praise, praise he likes–
“Harry?” Draco says, his voice firmer than before. Concern ripples through his mind, and he starts to sit up before he feels the weight of Harry’s gaze, and
“What–” Harry huffs a laugh, trying to pull away from Draco. “Obviously untruth, you’ve done that one a thousand times.” He’s right– Draco pulls that card whenever Harry’s feeling shitty, but right now– right now–
“I rarely know how to think, when it comes to you,” Draco says automatically, and Harry laughs, sharply delighted.
“I– I should sleep,” Harry says in a rush, nearly tripping over her feet as she gets off the couch. There’s a small furrow in between Draco’s pale eyebrows, but Harry doesn’t dwell on it. “I’ll– I’ll see you in Potions, tomorrow.”
The second time it happens is barely two weeks later, with the skin on Harry’s arms cracking apart like desert dirt after a rainstorm. Draco yells at him until he’s hoarse, but Harry still refuses to go to St. Mungo’s and refuses to tell Draco why, so Draco angrily makes a pot of tea and observes Harry’s arms until he’s sure his homebrew potion worked. The next day, he corners Hermione during the brief moments their breaks overlap.
Harry opens her mouth, then closes it, words dying in her throat. She turns to look at Draco, lingering on the mole beneath Draco’s eye. Draco keeps staring straight forward, her eyes flickering orange and yellow.
“I’d rather not be wearing your pants right now, I’ve decided,” Draco says primly, the frankly sinful roll of his hips undermining his tone. I can feel a patch of wetness against the material of the harness as he moves, and I see the moment he notices it too– his gaze goes sharp and heavy. “Enjoying yourself?”
“Do what again?” Harry asks, his voice teasingly light as though he’s feigning innocence, but before Draco can kick up a fuss Harry’s fingertip finds Draco’s prostate and Draco whimpers, jerking in Harry’s arms. “Yeah, that’s it,” Harry murmurs, biting down hard enough on Draco’s shoulder that it’ll bruise by tomorrow. “You like that, angel?”
Draco flinches, desperately wishing he could melt into the stone wall at his back. The person who spoke, a Ravenclaw he doesn’t recognize, takes a step towards him. On instinct he scrambles backwards, trying to calculate the distance to the nearest classroom door. His Charms class had let out early, so there’s no other students around yet.
“Then let me cook for you every day,” Harry continues. Draco kisses the back of his hand, light as a promise, and Harry closes his eyes, exhaling a breath he’s been holding for a lifetime.
Draco sighs, running a hand through his hair and messing up his already mussed bun. “I don’t spend a lot of time in my room, really. So I don’t have too much.”
“You have handcuffs?” I ask without thinking, and his expression goes dark, hungry. A moment passes by and I shiver as he blinks, an easy smile tugging at his perfectly-shaped lips.
“Stop,” Draco says quietly, reaching out to pull Harry onto the bed and into Draco’s arms. His hands are gentle, gentler than he’s ever been.
“You can create electricity with your body,” Harry says, and Draco’s eyebrows shoot towards his hairline.
“Fuck off,” Harry mumbles, already feeling prickly as he rolls over to face the wall. There’s a huff and a clatter behind him, so he drags the covers up over his ears to muffle the sounds of Draco taking his frustration out on the furniture.
“What is it?” Draco turns his face down into the pillow, pressing closer to Harry’s hand. Balancing the notebook on his thigh, Harry hastily scrawls something along the bottom of the page before turning it towards Draco. His mouth presses into a tight line, as though bracing for something.
“Don’t, don’t,” Draco says frantically, grabbing Harry’s hips and keeping him still. “Don’t, I’m– I’m okay.”
“Tell me you want it,” Harry says, low in his throat. His hand drops from Draco’s hair to grip the back of his neck. The possessive weight nearly makes Draco come right then, but he drags air into his lungs, willing the heat in his thighs to simmer a little longer, until Harry lets him come. Harry’s other hand runs over the sensitive skin of Draco’s arse, raw and stinging with the ghost of Harry’s handprints.
“Okay, baby,” Harry says, immediately sitting fully on Draco’s cock and stilling. “Tell me what you need.”
“Harry, I did it!” Draco nearly yells, belatedly noticing the unusual way Harry’s wringing his hands, but he ploughs on. “I said
“Oh my god,” Draco says, his tone somehow managing to be exasperated and incredulous at the same time. “I underestimated how oblivious you are.”
“Harry,” Draco says, fitting himself to Harry’s side and immediately feeling safer. “Let’s just go.”
“The grey Oxfords,” he says as he strides into the kitchen, stopping in his tracks at the full plate of breakfast laid out on the table. Harry is in front of the hob, setting the kettle to boil– his flat is muggle, and Draco has noticed he does almost everything in the kitchen the muggle way.
“Nope, it’s a planet. Technically? More like, the shell of a planet. The whole thing is hollow, but it’s still very much inhabited.”
“I’m sorry I’m on top of you.” Harry rolls away to face the ceiling, leaving one hand on the back of Draco’s neck, smushed against the pillow. “I just– fuck. Sorry.”
“Wait,” Draco whispers, the pain sharper than pleasure for a moment, and Harry freezes immediately. He’s at the right angle to lay a kiss to Draco’s collarbone and he does, over and over again, humming softly when Draco buries his free hand in his dark curls.
“Done,” Draco says softly, and Harry immediately rolls onto his side to wrap his body around Draco, laying his head in Draco’s lap. Gentle fingers start working their way through his curls, and he sinks into the feeling.
– back on. I stumble for a moment, my heavy bones foreign to me, but then Harry is on me, his mouth hot against the hollow of my throat as he moves us back toward the sleeping quarters. Before he can get me down into the bunk I pull away slightly and smirk down at him.
“Well, g’night, I guess,” Harry mumbles, and she feels Malfoy’s eyes track her until she turns around the doorway to the girls wing.
Harry stares down at Draco’s hand, his vision blurring with the threat of tears. “He wasn’t treating you the way you deserve.”
“Do I want to know why you have a shrunken headboard with you?” she asks as soon as he tumbles out of her Floo, and Harry grins sheepishly.
There’s a buzzing in Draco’s ears, panic and relief and confusion jumbled together, so he does the only thing he can right now: he presses his lips against Harry’s. There’s a startled little sound that could’ve come from either of them, then Harry’s kissing Draco back as though he’s trying to memorize the way Draco moves. Draco lets himself be pressed into the mattress, covered by Harry’s desperation.
.” Draco loves him like this, in the moment that Harry collects himself and takes charge without losing his intensity.
“Okay,” he says briskly when he’s done. Harry is sitting up and staring at him, looking half amused and half startled. “Don’t say anything until we get to my flat and I figure out what’s wrong or I may punch you.” Harry opens his mouth, and Draco points at him violently. “Do

“Come on. Come up here.” I need him inside me in every way, today. I need his cock in my mouth while my hole still flutters everytime I move. “Sit on my face. You’re gagging for it.”
Harry shifts, his free hand finding Draco’s, sliding his other hand away from Draco’s neck. The shape of his body is imprinted on the edge of Draco’s vision, a wavering marker that this is real, that Harry is here. Here, in between Draco’s soft sheets.
three year anniversary,” Draco says, then yelps as Harry rolls him over onto his stomach. Soft red rope is knotted down Draco’s back, keeping his arms pulled straight behind him and his feet digging into the back of his thighs. Harry takes a moment to admire his own handiwork, then smooths a hand over the pale curve of Draco’s arse.
Harry flops backwards across the bed, stretching his arms out and closing his eyes. “Loo is the door right next to this one.”
“I’m assuming since you didn’t know what grav means, you haven’t ever done this,” I say, and his eyes fly open. “Hedwig, turn off the grav,” I state right as Draco’s eyes go wide in realization.
“How do you know what friendship bracelets are?” Harry asks after a while. Draco is doing something complicated with her hair, but it feels nice so Harry doesn’t complain. “I thought those were just a Muggle thing.”
“Harry,” Draco breathes as he steps into his room, his shoes immediately sinking into a plush sky blue rug laid over the hardwood floor. He barely even recognizes his own room, with its former plain grey bed sheets and bare walls, because this is
“I– I was– yes, I was trying to get comfortable, because if I–” Harry slides the dildo out just to thrust it back in hard, and Draco shudders. “If I sat back too far, it would– ah– hit my prostate, and it kept
“I know you said you care but you always act so frustrated about healing me,” Harry says, not looking at Draco. His voice is heartbreakingly small.
The all-consuming anger flooding every part of Harry’s body dies down with the realization that it won’t help Draco, not right now, and what he
he’s hiding something, he has a reward on his head across four star systems. But now that he’s sitting here in my ship it’s already more complicated than
“I just…” Harry trails off, curling into himself, so Draco pulls Harry close to his chest and murmurs nonsense into dark curls until he feels Harry’s breathing slow.
can’t,” Harry says with a smirk, but it falters as Draco continues to stare. “No, it’s not really something you can win at.”
Harry smiles underneath you, teary-eyed and wild, manic and happy, pressing his palm to yours. His magic pushes insistently at your own until your joined palms glow molten gold.
“Just relax,” I tell him, kicking my feet out into the air as the familiar feeling of weightlessness overtakes me. I keep the grav on most of the time so that it’s not a huge adjustment when I’m planetside for a while, but I like to turn it off every so often and just hang out.
Draco scoffs. “Tomorrow, the Ministry better pray I don’t come in there to give them a piece of my mind.” He stretches, wiggling a little bit when Harry runs tickling fingers down his bare ribs. “I’m too busy to be mad right now, though.”
All of the air punches it’s way out of Draco’s lungs, and he curls himself around Harry, holding on almost too tightly, desperately. He’d suspected, wished, hoped Harry felt as strongly as he did, but Draco has never been brave.
“You didn’t have to make me breakfast,” Draco replies, immediately wincing at his blunt tone. He used to be better about tempering his thoughts, his words, but he simply doesn’t have the
“Well,” Harry says, shooting Draco a smile that could rival the sun. “I think I can work with that.”
Harry shrugs, shuffling his feet around on the carpet. “It’s cool? It’s like magic, but without magic.”
“Pity,” Draco murmurs, holding Harry even tighter as Harry spells the room dark. “Of course it was good, it’s you.”
“There you are. You know how to beg for it.” Harry lifts up onto an elbow and reaches for the bottle of lube, pouring a frankly obscene amount over his fingers before sliding his hand around the length of his dick. His knuckles brush across Draco’s cock and Draco whines, bucking his hips up. “Shh,” Harry soothes, wrapping his slick hand around Draco’s cock but not moving it. “Tell me how you want it.”
“I…” Draco swallows, unable to find the words to express how Harry was the one who made him realize this. “Thank you.”
“Oh, my darlingest,” Draco says, fluttering his eyelashes like a Hollywood film star. “Please, do let me go. I’m
Harry laughs and follows Draco through the Floo, trying not to let his thoughts linger on the curve of Draco’s smile. It’s the tiniest crush, that’s all, barely anything, and they’re roommates now.
,” Draco repeats, something desperate in his eyes, and Harry presses a kiss to his cheek, then his jaw, before catching Draco’s lips again. This time when Harry pulls away Draco chases his lips before blushing deeply.
know I can’t actually get pregnant,” Draco says when it’s clear that Harry isn’t going to emerge anytime soon. He doesn’t know if talking about it will make it worse, but he doesn’t have a clue what else to do. “I also know that you want to
,” Draco insists, whacking my arm for good measure. “I’ll remind you you’re talking to a prince,” he continues haughtily, trying to fight a smile, and I roll my eyes as I take my mug from his hands. That’s his favorite comeback– I think it’s because he’s easing into the idea of not being a prince anymore. He hasn’t told me much beyond his breakdown that first night, other than insisting over and over again that he won’t go back, only looking vaguely reassured when I tell him I won’t let anyone make him go back. Luckily I haven’t caught wind of anything on him in the news, so hopefully no one caught a trace of my ship right next to his in the Jkin system. Hedwig has good shields, but I rely much more on her sensors to pick up danger and her speed to get me the hell away from it. If we haven’t had any trouble so far, odds are good that we won’t for a while, at least until we have to dock on a planet for fuel. That’s a problem for future-me, though.
“You’re a bit of a brat, did you know?” Harry has that crooked smile back on his face, like they’re both in on something.
“I love you very much,” Draco says, barely above a whisper, and Harry shifts, gently taking Draco’s cock on his tongue. He tamps down the urge to hum in contentment and instead rests his cheek on Draco’s thigh. The hair there is downy soft and wispy. Harry closes his eyes and breathes through his nose, letting himself relax into the all-encompassing sensation of
Downstairs, the Floo roars as Harry steps out of the fireplace, the way he does every Sunday night at eight sharp.
he gasped that first time, sweat slick dark skin pressed to yours, warmth in you over you around you, pink mouth hot sin against your throat.
“Maybe I’d like that,” he replies, and before I can come up with something snippy to say back he’s angling the head of his dick into me and I can’t think at all.
Opening his eyes, Draco grins, the lopsided kind that shows off his single dimple. To anyone else it would be convincing, but Harry knows better. “Quite. The bruise will fade, and it already doesn’t hurt. Thank you for the potion. I’ll just–”
“Hey.” Draco smiles ruefully, just an upward tilt of one corner of his mouth. “Can I… can I come in?”
Afterwards, in the dark, under the covers, Harry presses his lips to Draco’s bare shoulder, exhaling like he’s about to speak.
“Keep these here?” Draco repeats with a smirk that reshapes into a gasp as Harry nips at his neck with no warning. “Wait– ah, Harry, my robes–”
“Only if you don’t,” I reply, the words coming out thick with exhaustion. Harry laughs quietly and turns to face me– I can feel the bed shift.
. Draco learns that being in a crowd stresses Harry out, that he has never been uncomfortable with Draco’s presence, just the settings in which they bumped into each other; like this, just the two of them, Harry is so impossibly bright, his grin contagious.
Harry snorts. “First thing to know about living here– Pepper is the biggest drama queen in existence.”
no, but it doesn’t mean anything.” Harry slides his fingers out of Draco fully, pulling them apart from each other and marveling at the string of slickness that hangs between his knuckles. Draco trembles in front of him, his thighs spread obscenely, his cock a mess of wetness, the pink furl of his arsehole tightening as he presses down onto the sheets, clearly trying to find friction. Harry smacks him across the arse for it, and Draco whimpers before he goes still. Harry conjures lube into his palm and struggles to shove his joggers down to his knees, then simply Vanishes them altogether before stroking his neglected cock– he’s achingly hard, and just the touch of his fingers makes his toes curl.
“Harry,” I gasp, reaching down to still his hand, because if he keeps praising me and fucking me on his fingers I am going to come
“You’re okay, it’s okay,” Harry murmurs, reaching up to enfold Draco into his arms. Against his shoulder Draco takes heaving breaths, clearly trying and failing to stop crying. Harry gently pulls Draco forward until he slides off the toilet, crumpling down in Harry’s lap. “Shhh, I know. I know.” Harry keeps murmuring nonsense into Draco’s ear, rubbing his back in small circles. He’s never seen Draco like this, and every sob digs right into his heart. Eventually Draco quiets, hiccuping softly as he shakes in Harry’s arms.
“So you agree that I’m the sexpert,” Harry says gravely, his mouth twitching into a smirk when Draco’s eyes fly open.
It starts with Harry’s red and gold tie wrapped around Draco’s wrists, tied to the bedpost of the twin bed they share more nights than not. Their shared room is small and close, lit faintly by the half-moon hanging over the castle grounds like a watchman. Draco’s naked body nearly glows under Harry’s hands, his long arms stretched over his head.
He recalls Harry’s disappointment, the way his tentative smile fell, the small nod of understanding, like Harry had expected this but was hoping for something different.
“Anything for you, sweetheart,” Harry says, and he means it. Draco just snorts and ducks their head.
Harry presses her mouth to the top of Draco’s head, trying not to smile. “You think I have cute knees?” Draco huffs, rolling out of Harry’s arms dramatically, and Harry rolls onto her side, reaching back out. Her arms feel empty without Draco in them. “No, come back. I won’t tease you about thinking my knees are cute.”
“You idiot,” Draco gasps when they break apart, sounding as though he’s a second away from either crying or laughing. Harry gulps in a breath, still dazed from the feeling of Draco’s soft lips on his own. “You idiot. Of course I like you. I thought you knew and were just politely turning me down!”
“You’ve done very well.” Harry looks at Draco for a moment, then leans down to press a kiss to his forehead. “Can you give me a colour first?”
, too. She wants to know Draco, to see her and be seen in return, to kiss the hollow of Draco’s flushed throat.
“Would you like to go on a date?” Draco murmurs, bracing for rejection as soon as the words have left his mouth, but Harry only smiles, wide and boyishly happy, as he nods.
“Firstly, I wanted to,” Harry says, seemingly unruffled by Draco’s tone. “Secondly, I thought that's what we agreed on when we decided to be flatmates. I deal with all the flat stuff since you’re busy at work.”
“C’mon,” Hermione says softly, nudging Harry’s shoulder. As they head on, leaving Malfoy standing in the hallway pulling at the ends of her hair, Harry forces herself to think about the Charms essay she needs to finish.
“Darling,” Draco says, and Harry hums as he slides his lips around the tip of Draco’s cock. “Oh– fuck, that’s good,” Draco stutters. Harry hums again, pleased, and starts to bob his head. “You’re so good, Harry.”
“Takeout?” Harry says, and Draco snaps back to the present. “That way we don’t have to go to a restaurant and hold hands the whole time.”
He convinces himself of this every week, and every week he loses his nerve before he even reaches Draco’s bedroom.
“You’re shaking,” Harry says abruptly. He pulls Draco into his lap, and suddenly everything shifts back into rightness in Draco’s chest. Draco sinks down against Harry, fighting down the sudden and terrible urge to cry. “Baby,” Harry murmurs, his voice tinged with concern. “Baby, what’s wrong?”
“Please,” Harry whispers, and it’s the way his voice cracks that sends Draco lurching back towards the bed. He kneels down on the mattress next to Harry, holding his hands upturned in surrender even as Harry leans away warily.
“But we could be,” Harry whispers, and Draco falls quiet. “We could be, if… god, everything hurts, and I– I keep losing days to this terrible
, his fingers digging into Draco’s thigh as he loses his grip on the dildo. Draco watches raptly as Harry shudders, his muscles rippling as he stiffens, then goes boneless. He drops forward, blinking his eyes open, grinning when he catches sight of Draco’s expression.
Fingers digging into Draco’s waist, Harry kisses him, fierce and tender all at once, and Draco wants to cry.
Understanding hits Draco like a train and leaves his heart scattered in its wake. “Darling, I’m not just saying that. You really do make me feel so good,
“Okay,” Harry says, soothing a hand down Draco’s ribs. He’s so pretty, splayed out like this, his silvery hair spilling across the pillow, the Gryffindor red stark against his wrists. Harry swallows hard. “I want to. I’ll take care of you.”
It’s been three days since the restaurant, three days of more pie and a bouquet of daisies that sits on Harry’s side table, but he hadn’t said anything yet, knowing that Draco needs to do things his way no matter how much Harry wants to just snog him senseless.
“Someone sounds desperate.” Harry yanks Draco’s pajama pants down to his thighs with his free hand, pressing his thumb into Draco’s throat when Draco hisses at the cool night air.
“Don’t touch my shit!” Harry yells. Twisted satisfaction bubbles up his chest when Draco flinches hard, trying to push himself further back into the dresser. The edge must be digging into his back, and he’s knocked a couple of things to the floor, but he’s staring at Harry like it’s the only thing he knows how to do.
“Yes. Yes, please,” I reply, and he huffs out a soft laugh before his lips find mine, tentative as a whisper. With no floor to give me leverage I move my hands to his shirt and grab onto the fabric, pulling him closer, kissing him deeper. His mouth opens up under mine, hot and insistent, and I melt against him. I can’t tell if I’m lightheaded from kissing him, or if that’s just what it feels like to kiss with no gravity, but my eyes fall shut and I lose myself in him.
“Why’d you stay with him then?” Harry looks back up to Draco’s face, blinking away the wetness. Draco looks to the side, then shrugs.
“Why do you even still go to work? You’re clearly…” Harry searches for a kind enough word, stirring the almost-ready soup, his feet bare on the cool tiles of Draco’s kitchen. The street light pours in through the windows, bisecting the early winter nightfall.
Harry bites back a smile as he looks at his boyfriend. They’ve only been in the new flat together for a week, but he’d vastly underestimated how little Draco truly understands about a Muggle apartment. “Where?”
“I guessed.” Harry smiles ruefully, his voice soft. “If someone took away everything I owned, my house, I would be… it would stick with me. Having a space that’s yours, having things that are yours, is important.”
Huffing out a sigh, Draco dramatically flops down onto the couch built into the wall. His hair spills over the side, rippling white in the low light of the ship. His pale legs are endless beneath navy boxers. “You’re a menace. I’d regret asking about it, but
“This is my bed!” Harry continues, and I scoff. “I could’ve just left you out in space, but nooooo, I had to do the good thing and bring you onboard, and then you try to sleep in my bed?”
“You like that?” he asks with a snap of his hips, and I jolt, still gripping my cock. He thrusts into me again and again, sweat smearing where our skin meets. “Hold your legs like this,” he commands, so I do, tucking my hands behind my knees and holding myself open for him. He plants his hands flat on the bed next to my shoulders and thrusts into me hard enough that I move up the bed a few inches.
“My hair is too short to braid,” Draco murmurs. Harry twists around, trying to catch Draco’s eyes, but Draco looks away. Harry turns her body around fully, knocking her knees into Draco’s.
are fantastic. You’re talented, and your work is beautiful, and if anyone can’t see that it’s because they lack taste and cannot understand good art. And I’ll be there the whole time to fend off anyone being a dick.”
thanks to rooney and lou for holding my hand thru this one specifically, and haley who has been fabulously beta reading every one of these chapters!
“It’s my ship!” Harry cries, his hands buried in his curls. The ambient lights of the ship have dimmed; Harry explained that it keeps time with the days and night of Catchpole to keep his body on a good sleep schedule. I’ve been exhausted for hours after having slept days on the Silver Swan with one eye open, but he insisted that I wait for the proper time to sleep. Then he told me I was getting a blanket on the floor, which I promptly told him was unacceptable.
“Draco,” Harry says, punched out and raw, and then they’re kissing again, their bodies slotting together, heat to heat, heart to heart. Harry’s hands are wrapped around Draco’s hips, tugging him closer, insistent,
“I’m going to push you off the sofa,” Draco says tetchily. Harry, who is pressed between Draco and the sofa back, snorts at the empty threat.
“I’m so sorry,” Harry says for what must be the tenth time. “I– I didn’t mean to make it get so tense so quickly, but he wasn’t taking your comfort seriously and then said he could
Harry sits frozen with his mouth dropped open, and Draco’s chest heaves as he presses his hands up to his own mouth, then his temples.
“What?” I bite out, clenching and unclenching my fingers. Everything in my body feels wobbly, like it’s been rearranged and put back to rights with everything off by a centimeter.
“Stop, stop,” Draco says, still laughing as Harry collapses down onto the couch and pulls Draco down next to him, dropping his hands. “Maybe Pansy would pull together an emergency Gay Brunch since I’ll be free.”
“Well.” Draco throws an arm around Harry’s waist, strangely nervous all of a sudden. “I mean, if you want things to be casual, I guess I can–”
“Don’t move, just for a moment. Just– just,” I breath out, losing my train of thought as Harry wraps a hand around the back of my thigh, digging his fingers into my skin. At my request he doesn’t move his hips at all, letting me adjust to the feeling of being so, so full. “Give me a moment.”
. That familiar knot of anger punches through his sternum and he grabs Draco under the chin, his finger pressed to the pounding pulse there.
“Harry,” Draco mumbles, his mouth pressed to Harry’s shoulder. He’s blinking rapidly, his grey eyes unfocused and his entire expression painfully soft. Secretly, this is Harry’s favorite part of having sex like this– Draco stripped bare and vulnerable in his arms afterwards, giving Harry the chance to truly take care of him. He shifts Draco slightly and cleans up the mess of their sheets with a quick spell. The skin of Draco’s arms is starting to gooseflesh, so Harry also summons the blanket thrown over the chair in the corner of the room and tucks it over both of their shoulders. When they’re settled and warm, Harry presses a soft kiss to Draco’s forehead.
Harry summons the matching ankle cuffs while Draco tugs at the restraints around his wrists. Draco bends a knee up until he almost unseats Harry, who slams his hands down onto Draco’s shoulders with a warning glance. The motion causes the tip of his cock to brush Harry’s arse and the plug to push up against his prostate, and heat flashes through Draco’s stomach.
“Harry,” he says, gazing at the picture a moment longer before turning to Harry, who looks up from scratching under Pepper’s chin. “I really don’t have many things. But I don’t mind.” He doesn’t mention how the Ministry seizing the Manor and everything inside it might have left a gaping hole in his heart that he doesn’t know how to fix, because it’s
“Thank you,” Harry says and winds his fingers into Draco’s hair, tugging him forward with a yank that makes Draco gasp. As Draco presses his lips against the slick heat of Harry’s cock, he lets his eyes fall shut, safe under Harry’s hands.
“You also looked so lonely,” Harry says softly, and Draco freezes. He thought– he thought he was doing alright, faking it, through the haze of alcohol and the glitter of club lights. Something twists in his chest and he tries to jerk away, but there’s nowhere to go, nowhere to escape to. Harry is everything, right now.
“Baby,” Harry says tenderly, reaching a hand down between their bodies to wrap around Draco’s cock, and the sudden pressure is just enough. Draco shouts as his orgasm hits him, heat flooding all the way down to his toes as he shakes through it. Harry keeps thrusting, increasingly frantic until he shudders too, dropping the full weight of his body onto Draco, apparently uncaring of the come that's now growing tacky between their stomachs. After a few moments Draco shifts, wincing at the length of Harry’s dick still inside him.
I don’t know how long I keep my eyes closed, but all I know is Harry. Harry, Harry, Harry. Warm hands on my arms and laughter and weightlessness.
The last thing Harry remembers is Draco’s hushed laughter, warm fingers rubbing gentle circles against her skin, and the unbearably tender feeling of happiness.
“I–” Harry’s face crumples a bit, and he looks away. “I don’t actually want to get you pregnant. Even if I were able to. You– you know that? I just–
“Okay.” Draco presses his forehead to Harry’s. Both of them are breathing hard, and Draco trembles with relief and the proximity of Harry.
“Harry,” Draco whispers, and Harry doesn’t know who moves first but they’re kissing across the middle console, warm and desperate, and that’s when Harry realizes he can’t feel the bond at all.
“Untruth. No one loves you romantically,” Draco amends, his voice muffled in the collar of Harry’s jumper, and Harry goes completely still beneath him.
“Well…” Lila tilts her head, peering at Draco with sharp brown eyes. “You must stay within proximity of each other. Your cores will interfere with your internal temperatures if you put too much distance between yourselves.”
All of Draco’s guilt is washed away when Harry shows up in the middle of a Tuesday, Draco’s day off, with his green eyes completely glassy.
“I don’t know what you want with them yet. I don’t know what you’re trying to do. But mark my words, I’m going to find out,” Harry hissed, leaning forward once more.
Draco chucked quietly, vanishing the flannel and crawling back into bed. He lay down beside Harry, lifting the blankets to cover them both.
Malfoy was looking determinedly over Harry’s shoulder. His pale face was flushed, a rosy hue painted across the apples of his cheeks to the tips of his ears.
Harry bit his lip so hard he could taste blood. He could feel his own eyes begin to fill with tears, frustrated that he could not help ease his godson’s pain. He wasn’t even the person that Teddy
Andromeda pursed her lips with a hum, raising her eyebrows in question once more as she stared at Harry before nodding once. “Be good, everyone. Floo if you need me.”
for how fierce it was. Harry gasped against Draco’s lips before a low groan tore itself from his throat and he
“Er...yes,” Harry nodded shakily. He shot a glance towards Malfoy, whose eyes were lowered, cheeks flushed as he refused to meet anyone’s gaze.
earlier this week. Who’s to say he wasn’t out with that bloke again, doing who knows what, ignoring every responsibility he has to Teddy?”
After a few moments, Harry hesitantly lifted his eyes, breathing in sharply as they met bright silver, watching him inquisitively.
As he regained his balance, Harry looked back at Malfoy and froze as he stared into silver eyes, twinkling with mirth, eyebrows raised and a smirk tugging at his thin lips. He could feel his cheeks heat with embarrassment, and sheepishly rubbed the back of his neck, huffing out a stilted chuckle as he glanced away.
Taking a deep breath, Harry exhaled heavily, running his hands across his face, fingers trembling as he realized just how monumentally
“It doesn’t surprise me!” Harry said quickly, shrugging when Draco raised a questioning brow towards him. “You’re...er...well, you’re good...with Teddy. And other things...so I’m sure you’re good at this.”
“Yes, Potter,” Draco snapped, and Harry could not help wincing as Draco reverted to his surname, after they had made so much progress recently. “It may surprise you, but I am quite good at what I do.”
Draco hesitated, eyes flickering from Teddy to Harry. Harry sucked his bottom lip between his teeth, pleased when he saw Draco’s eyes follow the movement.
“Er...Hangover Potion, Kreacher...please,” Harry squeezed his eyes shut again, clutching the sheets around him in an effort to stop the room from spinning.
“Alright, Tedward,” Draco started, turning to face the boy, “I will join you this evening after my shift. How does that sound?”
“Really?!” Teddy nearly began to shake with his excitement. His hair shimmered, shifting between colors before settling to a blotchy pattern reflecting the calico markings of the Kneazle in front of him. Seeing the display, the Kneazle let out a loud purr, standing up and arching as it rubbed itself against the barrier, as if to touch Teddy.
Gary skittered beneath the love seat, leaving only Harry, Malfoy and a distraught Teddy in the middle of the sitting room. Harry instantly fell to his knees in front of his godson, reaching out to hold him, desperately spewing out reassurances, “Teddy, are you okay? It’s okay, you’re going to be okay!”
Andromeda blinked, feigning innocence as she raised one eyebrow inquisitively. “What about that is confusing? I rather think that it is quite obvious.”
“No, Tedward,” Malfoy repeated, narrowing his eyes slightly as he looked down at the child, “Lunch is had
Harry huffed, his nostrils flaring as he took a jolted step back. His eyes ran down the length of the man before him, taking in the lean lines of him, adorned in sleek trousers and a sharp shirt.
It felt as if a bucket of ice water had been thrown across him as he stared at the scars marring Draco’s pale skin—scars that
indicating that Malfoy has Disapparated. He stood in place for a moment, trying to decipher what had happened. Malfoy had actually seemed...
“Right.” Draco nodded hastily. As he strode past, making his way to the steep stairwell and towards Teddy, Draco’s fingers brushed lightly against Harry’s own.
Hesitantly, Harry raised his eyes to Malfoy, curious if the other man thought this was as strange as Harry did.
Silver eyes glinted with a challenge as they stared back at Harry. He clenched his jaw tightly, fists held tightly at his sides. Of course he had a problem with that. What gave Malfoy the nerve to intrude upon Andromeda and Teddy’s quiet home, bringing who knows what kind of darkness with him?
Harry blinked lazily, a lazy smile spreading across his face. He relaxed further into his sheets as Draco cleaned the spunk from his skin. Just as Draco began to turn towards the en suite, presumably to dispose of the dirtied flannel, Harry reached forward, his fingers grasping at the air.
Harry groaned, rolling his eyes and tossing his hands in the air in exasperation, “Merlin, Malfoy. His name is
Draco’s eyes were riveted to their joined hands, a small wrinkle forming between his brows. His cheeks were beginning to pinken and although his face remained inscrutable, when he lifted his eyes to meet Harry’s there was an intensity within them that was hypnotizing.
“Malfoy would be better at that—he cooks with you, doesn’t he? Why don’t you ask him?” Harry questioned, proud of himself for smoothly bringing up Malfoy’s involvement. He turned to look at Andromeda once more, only to see her gazing at him intently. Harry immediately focused on his mental shields. He still wasn’t sure whether or not Andromeda had any particular skill in legilimency, but looking at her now he did
Harry smiled softly, holding Teddy’s hand gently in his own as he bent down to pick up the forgotten training broom. He looked around for his own broom before remembering it had snapped in the collision with Draco earlier, and the debris had already been vanished by the volunteers.
Teddy tripped as he skidded to a stop in front of Ginny.“Now that they are better, can we fly some more?” he asked, “Please?”
“It’s because this was never going to be casual, for me, and he knows that, and he didn’t think it would be the same for you,” Draco murmured against Harry’s lips, voice low and breathy. “I have liked you for longer than I care to admit. I will deny it if I need to—believe me, I will. But
“Yes, ma’am,” Harry murmured, shifting back on his heels as if it could help distance him from Andromeda’s ire. She appraised him for a moment before nodding her head once and turning towards the kitchen cupboards.
He wanted this every night. Teddy—at Grimmauld place—curled against Draco’s side at the end of the night as Draco read him a bedtime story.
Andromeda nodded as she stopped in front of him, lifting her thin hand to gently pat his cheek, “Yes, dear. Cissy wanted me to Portkey over as quickly as possible today. There is a charity event this afternoon she wants me to accompany her to, and it requires an early arrival. My only delay in departing was to ensure that you arrived for Teddy.”
Within moments, the pitter patter of paws echoed down the halls, and Gary nonchalantly strode into the sitting room. He flicked his tail, gazing up at Harry as if questioning what was taking
Draco laughed, running his fingers fondly through Teddy’s messy hair. “Then I will see you this evening.” He turned, grasping a handful of Floo powder in one hand and tossing it into the hearth. With one last glance towards Harry, Draco stepped into the flames and with a
Malfoy’s pale brows rose until they were hidden behind his tousled fringe. “She wanted you to look like...a muggle prostitute?” He questioned, his eyes roaming over Harry’s body again.
Andromeda merely chuckled, tilting her head and looking at him as if she were indulging a child, “Neither of you are as subtle as you think that you are, my dear.”
Dancing the waltz alongside Malfoy felt a lot different than dancing with Parvati at the Yule Ball. He was used to tripping over his feet, stepping on his partners toes, whenever he danced. Yet Malfoy’s firm hand on his back led him gracefully through the room and Harry didn’t stumble once.
Harry did not dare look at Draco—he did not want to see the look of adoration that must be writ across his face, having his muscular heroic Healer boyfriend coming to their aid, with his stupid coiffed hair and sparkling brown eyes.
“You’re manipulating them,” Harry blurted, snapping his eyes back up to Malfoy’s. If Malfoy seemed stiff before, he was a statue now, face frozen as he stared back at Harry, shoulders tight and back straight against the shelf he was leaning against.
“What?” Teddy tilted his head back so that he could stare directly at Malfoy. “Aren’t you staying for lunch?”
Almost immediately, Teddy’s eyes shifted back to their deep brown as he focused on George. He held the Pygmy Puff gently to his chest, stroking the top of its round body.
“Er, no...” He started, running a hand through his hair only to get his fingers caught in tangled strands. “No, I came early today. You should stay...spend time with Teddy, like normal. I’ll just...join, if that’s alright.”
Teddy’s screams stuttered as he tried to catch his breath. Silver eyes blinked, blurry with tears as they gazed up at Harry. “Hurts—” Teddy sobbed, “—D-Draco!”
“Harry, you have to pick something!” Teddy laughed, kicking his legs lightly against Harry’s thighs.
Molly’s voice called out from inside, letting them know brunch was ready. Ginny and Ron pushed at each other as they hurried inside, Harry hesitating where he stood.
“Harry—“Andromeda started, placing a hand on Teddy’s shoulder and trying to pull him back as she stepped toward Malfoy and Harry.
It wasn’t until Draco’s fingers pulled at his hair, dragging him away, that Harry pulled back. He whined, panting, as Draco wrapped his hands around Harry’s arms and hauled him upwards.
“What?” Harry asked, standing up straighter. He didn’t understand why they were staring at him like this, as if he had done something both incredibly stupid and ingenious.
Harry swallowed thickly, running his fingers nervously through his messy curls. “So, did you...er, that is...did you want to stay over?”
