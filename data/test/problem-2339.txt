Draco mentally counted the number of weeks until the holidays, wishing desperately for time to pass quickly, because he was starting to wonder if he would survive the constant tension for that long.
“I’m sure you have a dozen more just like them.”
"And anyway, they'd have to catch me first." He rolled the broomstick from one hand to the next. "Well? Are we on?"
He was unreal.
“Sure. You know where to find me.”
“I’m still fucking eating it, Potter! Do you see me with this lamb on my fork?” He waved it in Potter’s grinning face. “What did you think I was going to do with it? Paint its portrait? Have a little chat with it? No, I’m going to eat it, you absolute monster.”
Pansy's eyes narrowed, then a dangerous recognition dawned on her face. "This has something to do with Potter, doesn't it?"
"You're kidding."
Auror Potter," Potter said to the quill, followed by a pointed look at Draco. "Is that it?"
Draco licks his lips and waits for Harry to meet his eyes. “I want a lot of things, Harry.”
The bastard bloody
"But I reckoned, perhaps, if he'd be willing to go to dinner with me, I'd stick around," Draco said.
“Even though I always lost?”
With a growl, Briggs turned on her heel and headed back towards the lift. Draco felt the bite of her stinging hex just as the doors slid shut. He winced but kept on his feet. Juvenile. Briggs’ magic was as weak as he'd anticipated – like brown coffee or the last drag of a cigarette before you hit the filter. Now, if Potter had hit him with that, it would have been a wildfire, a flash flood, a shock of lightning.
Potter looked briefly taken aback. “You can pay for those,” he said.
"That's acceptable," Draco's mouth said, but in his mind, he was screaming. Why couldn't Potter ask to meet in the safety of the morning, when daylight could offer the guise of professionalism?
“Oh for goodness’ sake,” Pansy says, exasperated, and heads to the back room. She’s going for the wine in the icebox, Draco’s sure of it.
Harry shook his head.
Potter shook his head but didn’t elaborate.
“Um, sir? You called?”
And directly into the fucking troll foot umbrella stand.
to wank over Harry Potter. He wasn’t thinking about him with his hand down the borrowed joggers working slowly over his cock. Was it big? God, it probably was, because of course Potter would have a big cock. The world was completely unfair like that.
But Potter merely huffed and carried on with his casual inspection. "Anything stolen?"
“There’s something else I want to say to you, but I’m afraid you’ll leave,” Harry said, his breath hot and humid against Draco’s neck, his voice thick with exhaustion.
As soon as Draco pulled the last stitch tight, severing the thread with a slash of his wand, he slumped. He dragged the first deep breath into his lungs in what felt like hours.
“Bisexual,” Harry corrected with a resolute nod.
“And how did that turn out for you?” Draco sneered.
How can he have missed this? It was so bloody obvious! He’s almost embarrassed it took him so long. Of course, that leaves him to confront the conundrum of what he ought to do next. It isn't as if he can ring Potter on the Floo and ask him out to dinner. And anyway, Draco rarely does the asking, much preferring to put up chase and let the suitors fall all over themselves to impress him. But this is different. Potter is different. And Draco hasn’t the foggiest idea where to start.
"Mm, had it made. Ginny insisted. Said the Harpies t-shirt with the hole in the armpit probably wasn't appropriate."
“Party’s over, Potter.”
Hermione's expression shifted to something far more familiar — a harried sort of exasperation. "That's not — I just wish —"
“Don’t tell anyone, but I secretly love this song.”
Ron laughed loudly. “Right you are, mate. Right you are. Come on you great git, no more sulking. You’re missing your party.”
“I doubted your motives, yes. I was certain you were here for… other reasons. Foolish reasons. But now I see you have poured your heart into this. And it is stunning. Bravo,” Emile said, clapping his hands together. “Bravo, my love.”
“I don’t know, and even if I did, I’m not at liberty to say. Good day, Mister Malfoy. Try and stay out of trouble.” And with that, she got into the lift and was gone.
"He's definitely looking now."
“I recall you sitting in my chair boasting about your abilities to get people to do as you say, and look at you now. Bloody gullible. I thought you were supposed to be clever.”
“I’m used to covering it,” Potter says with a pout, rubbing at the scar across his forehead, which cuts into his right eyebrow and ends just above his eye.
Potter chuckled and it was so low and deep it sounded almost like a growl. “It’s a warning.”
that falls from Draco’s lips… it’s torture of the sweetest kind.
Potter jumped on the sofa in his sock feet. He was horribly off-tune and Draco was laughing so hard he felt high.
“Exactly.”
Draco tripped to the nearest bin and vomited. His body shook painfully, wracked with tremors as he retched, gasping in each breath as though drowning. He wiped his mouth on the back of his hand and sank to the floor, leaning against the wall and curling in on himself.
He tucked Draco's wand back into his jeans and looked at him sheepishly through dark lashes.
Weasley fiddled with the knobs built into the dash of the Jeep. There was a loud, tinny screech, muffled static, then the wail of a guitar followed by a drumbeat so fast and low Draco could feel it thrum in the pit of his stomach.
"Can I help you?" Draco asked when the Auror fixed her flint-black gaze on Draco, scanning him up and down, not appearing impressed in the slightest.
"No cheating, Potter."
“You’re awfully confident,” Harry said, turning to him. There was a small smirk on his lips, but his eyes were searching, flicking back and forth between Draco’s own in a way that made him feel flayed open, as if Harry were looking for weakness, a chip in his armour.
“Are we strapped with this one, too?” he asked.
"Fuck," Potter muttered to the ceiling.
Who knew Potter could look so edible in tight trousers and a well-tailored shirt, unbuttoned nearly to the waist with a tie hanging loose around his collar. If that was what Potter was hiding under all that scarlet, Draco had half a mind to send a complaint. He didn’t know to whom, exactly – the uniform designing department, the Minister of Magic, Potter himself – because honestly, it was a disservice to mankind. He was certain that a lot fewer criminals would skip their parole meetings if Potter walked around looking like
The tension leaked from Potter’s muscles and he slumped with a sigh, releasing his grip on Draco’s neck to tug at a fistful of his own hair. Draco tipped off him to one side, sprawling back against the opposite arm of the sofa, one knee bent, wincing as the wetness seeped from his body. They sat in silence, catching their breath until Potter straightened. He dropped a kiss onto Draco’s kneecap, then disappeared into the toilet. He returned a moment later with a wet flannel, which he handed to Draco.
Draco barked out a surprised laugh. “I’m not quite that unforgiving, though I gave him some flat-front trousers in a nice charcoal for every single birthday.” He shook his head. “I wish I could take responsibility for removing the twit from my life. Alas, I cannot.”
But when Draco finally stepped out of the toilet and padded back into the bedroom, it was to find Harry nestled face-down in a pillow, breathing softly, the sheets tangled around his waist.
The Healers had no updates, only repeated what they already knew: That Harry was stable, that he was healing, that it would take time, that it could take forever.
Draco didn’t mean for it to sound so fond, but he was drunk and, fortunately, so was Potter, based on the way he smiled blearily at Draco and sunk deeper into the sofa.
“Oh, Draco. You pretend to be so dull, but I know you better. Look at you, all buttoned up and business-like. It’s like you don’t want anyone to know you’re a dirty slag. Cobra in the grass, you are.”
Harry is good at this, at divesting Draco of clothing as quickly as possibly, entirely out of necessity, because if Harry had his way, Draco would never need to bother with clothes again. He was striking in robes and Muggle bespoke alike, self-possessed and confident, but it only made Harry want to tear away the layers faster, to get straight to skin and scars, where Harry could check for marks, could clock the teeth marks, rug burns, indentations of fingerprints that didn’t belong to him.
"Draco."
. He needed to know if Harry was alright and he needed to know
He'd kept Pansy in the dark during his final days in England. Cruelty wasn't his intention, but what was he expected to do? He could hardly admit to himself all the foolish things he'd done. To put them to voice and lay them flat in front of Pansy to scrutinise was unfathomable. Because that would make them
Because that was what they did, wasn’t it? Draco had read the books. He knew what happened to people who fought through wars. Sure, they craved a normal life, longed for peace. But there was always that
“I’m sorry to disappoint you, darling, but there is no one aiming to win this prickish, sort-of-charming heart,” Draco said and drained his Prosecco.
“Malfoy, no! I’ll be sick on Zabini’s expensive sofa.”
“It’s a beautiful jacket. Will bring out your eyes. But you should skip the tie,” she said, and with the tip of one sharp fingernail, flicked the collar of Draco’s shirt, unbuttoned a touch too low, as always. “Just wouldn’t be
That night, Draco drank an entire bottle of firewhisky and followed it with two vials of Dreamless Sleep. As the potions mercifully dragged him under, Draco thought how nice it would be to never wake again.
. Sometimes he would reach down and squeeze the base of Harry's cock, pulling him back viciously from the brink.
Draco rolled onto his stomach, pillowing his head on his hands, and shrugged. "Parents, Manor. Fancy dinner. Awkward silence. Maybe a drunken fight with Father, if we're feeling lively. The usual."
. If he did, it would lead him to conclusions he couldn’t face, admissions and words he’d never spoken, thought, or even heard.
Draco scrubbed a hand across his jaw. "There was a break-in at the shop."
But Weasley was already walking through the front door of an ivy-covered brick building. Draco followed her, the bell over the door tinkling softly as it closed behind him. The room was humid, with plants absolutely everywhere. It had the same chaotic, almost
"Any plans for Christmas?" Potter repeated.
“God, Draco, please. I’m dying here,” he murmured against Draco’s mouth, his hips twitching, almost unseating Draco and wresting a growl from his chest.
“Potter’s
Draco suffered a few weeks on Pansy’s hard old sofa until Harry found out and came to his rescue. Typical heroic Gryffindor. And after sleeping in this bed for nearly four months, it’s almost starting to feel like home. Draco feels safe here, though the house is dark and dusty and reeks of mildew in certain places. Half of it stays locked up because Harry only exists in a few rooms: the kitchen, the sitting room, and his bedroom. And while those rooms are only a touch less dust-caked than the rest, they
"Since the beginning. Harry thinks he's clever, but I happen to be married to the smartest person both of us know." He smirked, but the wind whipped that away too. "He reckons you left England because of him."
“Mm, perhaps. But I suppose the real question is, can he control himself around you?”
Draco touched the wand concealed in his sleeve and muttered a charm to draw the man’s attention. It wasn’t anything drastic, just a handy little thing he’d learned from a burlesque dancer in Rio. When the man turned, Draco gave him his filthiest grin and watched as he weaved determinedly through the crowd toward Draco, like a fish pulled helplessly on a line.
“So, is your boyfriend going to be here?” Potter asked, voice echoing into the glass he refused to move away from his face.
“I don’t have to ask what you’re doing here, Draco,” she said, placing her glass on the table. “I know you got yourself arrested for doing something childish. Again.”
"Can't? Or won't?"
Draco gasped. Potter’s hand was hot and rough and the angle was all wrong but it didn’t matter because Potter was straddling him with his uniform half unbuttoned and his bottom lip clamped between his teeth and Draco did not hate that one bit.
Harry knew he shouldn’t want Malfoy the way he did. Not because Malfoy was a man, but because he was
“The Rosado will pair better. And their steak is incredible,” Potter said with a shrug, unrolling his silverware from his linen napkin.
“Oh, it’s back to Potter now, is it? Great.” Harry says with a huff.
Harry smirks and shrugs. “I like what I like.”
“That’s why you love me,” Draco replied with a smirk. “So fond of things that breathe fire
“Merlin, Potter. You’re making the rest of us look bad with those heroics,” Watts exclaimed, a wide grin on his boyish face
Weasley stepped up and took the bag of tea from Draco’s outstretched arm and sniffed it, eyes fluttering shut. “Fuck, I love this stuff.” He eyed the other bag, nose twitching much like Draco’s had. “That’ll be for the Ukrainian Ironbellies. I’ll let you hang onto that. Harry’s round back. Hold on.”
“Those poor sad bastards don’t know what they’re missing,” Pansy says.
“Alright,” he said with a sigh and in a surprisingly deft move, swivelled his body to thread one leg over the bike so he was once again straddling it. He patted the leather of the seat behind him. “Hop on. It’s been an age since I had a pretty thing on the back of my bike, anyway.”
"You already said it was too late for dinner."
Draco snorted and tried so hard to tamp down on his smirk that it made his cheek ache.
"No," Draco said too quickly, then winced because Potter was smirking and shaking his head.
“Draco.” A heavy hand settled on Draco’s shoulder, shaking him from his mental gymnastics, as Marcus’ voice cut through the fog.
“I’m saying you look exhausted, Draco. You’re working yourself into the ground.
“You’re making me feel underdressed,” Potter says, plucking at his jumper.
"Yeah. I — I think that would be good."
“I’m sorry! I like this song.”
“Okay,” Draco said with a put-upon sigh. “I like you.”
“Sure. Doesn’t yours?”
"In the cupboard," Harry said. His eyes flicked away from the view to Draco, then he sighed. "I suppose that means you want me to make you one."
He removed the folder Bridges handed over from his jacket and held it out to Draco. Draco took it with a frown. He didn't particularly want to look, didn't give a fuck about the stupid case, not with Potter lying half-dead in that hospital bed. But he opened the folder anyway, only to be confronted by a face he recognised.
“Be honest with me,” he said. “Is he going to pull through?”
Harry barked out a laugh, and it echoed into the night to be carried away by the wind, dashed on the rocks, and lost to the waves. “The bastard doesn’t stand a chance.”
“Tell me you’re mine,” Harry says, and it sounds wrong, half animal, hardly like words at all.
"Because you care what everyone thinks."
"Very good. Just lock up when you're finished?"
Draco curled forward, buried his burning face into Harry’s shoulder as he babbled, “Shut up, shut up,
“Sure I do. Don’t I?” Harry frowned.
“Why don’t you want to ride on my motorbike?”
“I may be dramatic, but at least I’m not the one posing
“I think you did.” Potter’s voice sounded soft and a little dreamy, which did not bode well on the blood-loss front.
“Nope, I don’t think I do.”
“Guess who I arrested last night,” Harry bated as everyone leaned in closer. Harry gestured to Hannah Abbot at the bar for a drink of his own. “No, really. I want you to try and guess.”
Draco hated stakeouts with Potter. For one, it involved them sitting in close quarters for long periods of time. The first few they suffered through as partners were painfully awkward while they sat in silence, each minute stretching longer than the last. Over time, they became more bearable, if no less terrible. Potter was quite chatty once you got him started, and Draco was subsequently subjected to hours of inane prattling about Potter’s new broomstick, his godson Teddy, Granger’s latest bout of academic brilliance, the previous nights’ Quidditch scores, or the newest nonsense from the Weasel’s joke shop.
Potter released him. “Good night, Malfoy.”
Harry woke the next morning cocooned in warm blankets. It was still early, the sun just barely casting its watery dawn light across Harry's face. His muscles ached and when he stretched, about ten different things popped and cracked in an immensely satisfying way.
Draco sips his drink to keep from croaking. “Evening, Potter,” he says, and is pleased that it comes out smooth and unwavering.
“Wouldn’t dream of it,” Harry says, grabbing the hand that isn’t holding the coffeepot and kisses it. Draco’s fingers flex and curl, but he doesn’t pull away. Harry releases him and he drifts away, but Harry doesn’t mind. He closes his eyes and listens to Draco’s bare feet shuffle across the kitchen floor and smiles.
“I do,” Draco says, weaving his scarf around his neck. “Often. Alas, that isn’t all I want to do.”
Draco scoffs. “And draw the attention away from the man of the evening? I would never!”
The server blinked a few times, then nodded wildly. “Of course, Mr Harry Potter, sir.” And he scampered back towards the kitchen, knocking into three different bodies and a chair in his haste.
Despite the size of the room, the crowds pressed in around Potter. Everyone wanted a piece of him — a piece of his time, his fame, his money. Even for someone as verbose as Draco, it was bloody exhausting. It forced him to bat away a deluge of questions, none of which had anything to do with Potter himself, or Draco, even. Like a bunch of circling vultures, they descended, picking away at them until Draco was ready to bloody scream.
He grabbed a fistful of Potter’s hair and yanked him back with a gasp. Potter’s eyes were dark and a little feral and Draco nearly reconsidered allowing him to stop ravishing him, but no, he had to get Potter horizontal immediately.
“That dick again? Merlin, Harry. Just quit already.” Ginny helped herself to a beer and popped the cap with her wand. She stuck her gum to the inside of the bottle cap and hopped onto the counter, freckled legs swinging, heels hitting the cupboards with the backs of her trainers. “Shacklebolt would absolutely ream him for losing you.”
He glanced around the Paris flat he called home. The golden, autumn sunlight streamed through ceiling-high windows that overlooked the streets of Montmartre, with a spectacular view of the Sacré-Cœur in the distance, perched pale and gleaming at the top of the butte. Inside, the sheets draped over the furniture fluttered in the morning breeze like ghosts. Suitcases lay open and empty across his bed, and though the closet doors were flung wide, his suits and robes remained on their hangers.
Mrs Quill died four years after Draco started working for her, and she left the shop to him. Although he’s taken things in a different direction, he likes to think she would be proud. He misses her, sometimes.
Harry killed the engine with another kick of his boot and Draco gasped his first breath since hitting the ground. He released his death grip on Harry's waist, ripped the helmet from his head, and tossed it to the sidewalk. The silence rang in his ears as Draco stumbled from the back of the bike. He had to stand with his hands on his knees and his eyes squeezed shut for a solid ten seconds to get his lungs to start working properly again.
“Shut up, Malfoy.”
"Don't
“That
“And don’t you forget it.” Pansy set down her drink and held out her hand. “Come on. Dance with me.”
Malfoy was attractive, and if he were anyone other than Draco fucking Malfoy, Harry might have considered it. But it didn't matter how fit he was, this was Malfoy and Malfoy always had an angle. Harry wouldn’t be fool enough to fall for it.
By the fourth drink, Jason (or was it Joshua? Shit, he’d already forgotten) was happily licking Draco’s neck. It felt rather nice, but Draco could only tolerate the man slobbering all over him for so long, so he told Justin to get them a cab.
Potter rolled off him with a groan, and Draco whimpered as Potter's cock slipped from his body.
Draco took one of Potter’s hands in his and scrubbed the blood from his fingers, then did the same with the other, while Potter watched him from his slump with half-lidded eyes.
"Good. I just asked for the most expensive shit they have."
It takes Harry a moment, probably longer than it would have if Draco weren’t splayed out naked on his carpet, but it starts to piece together in his mind. It is his job, after all, putting together puzzles with too few clues, getting people to admit things that have no intention of admitting. The timing is just too convenient. And Draco can’t fool him, though he may try.
Draco was never someone to deny himself a thing he wanted – certainly not when that thing was trapped beneath his weight and looking up at him with such fiery intensity it made him ache – but something in the denial was sweetly addicting. Potter was drunk and pliant and Draco thought he could probably shove Potter over the edge, could just kiss him with tongue and teeth and Potter might give into him, but it was then that Draco realized he didn’t want it like that. He didn’t want to trick Potter into his bed, he wanted him to go freely, to submit to the desires he so obviously had, and do so without reservation. For once, Draco wanted to win the game without an ace up his sleeve, he wanted to win because his hand was the best and because he deserved it. He wanted Potter to let him win, fair and square.
“Draco, please,” he groans as Draco finally eases all the way down, until there is nothing between them and Draco can feel Harry’s heart beat in time with his own.
Harry snorted and plucked a screw from the handful to look at it more closely, his eyes nearly crossing behind his glasses. “No. Just a friend thing.”
"Tell Potter I'm busy. I have a store to run. The DMLE must have qualified potion handlers on payroll," Draco replied with a haughty sniff and dismissive wave of his hand.
Harry sighs, mumbles a “goodnight,” and then the door is clicking shut behind him.
“What’s going on with you and Potter?”
"Head Auror Potter took a blood-letting curse to the chest."
“Don’t you dare. I need her.”
Potter left his bloody hand there all the way to the DMLE, and Draco might have preferred the handcuffs to that, because they were drawing attention. He could feel the eyes of every witch and wizard in the Ministry atrium burning against the back of his neck as they swivelled to watch them pass. He couldn't decide if it was because people saw Draco Malfoy traipsing through the Ministry with Head Auror Potter, or if that was the sort of treatment Potter always received simply by existing.
“Alas, no. It seems both our exes have moved on without us.” Draco wanted to ask more. Wanted to know how long Weasley had been in Romania, how long he’d been seeing other blokes. If Potter was seeing anyone. But instead, he said, “I best be getting back.”
Harry’s hips twitch beneath him as Draco trails his fingers back down his chest, through the thatch of dark hair beneath his navel, and to the clasp of his trousers.
“Not as such. You’re not so well known in France, though I am accustomed to seeing your name in the English papers Draco had delivered.”
Draco grabs him by the collar of his unbuttoned shirt and brings their faces close together. “I’m not a fucking virgin, Potter! And while I’m touched by your rather sudden bout of romanticism, I want this so bloody badly, I don’t care if we do it in the back of a bus. But, fortunately, we are here, in my lovely shop, and you are wearing
Potter vanished the cigarette in a puff of smoke and nodded. “After you.”
Draco growls. “Potter! Yves Saint Laurent was a Muggle; I’ve clearly come around!”
“Would you tell him and my brother not to miss dinner next Sunday? Mum’s starting to make a fuss, huffing and calling her children ungrateful. It’s honestly getting annoying.”
Harry is looking at him again. Draco knows it, though he keeps his lids shut tight. Harry releases his wrists and holds Draco’s face between his hands. Draco can feel the trails made by Harry’s eyes as he takes in Draco’s blotchy cheeks and tear tracks.
“Let’s go,” Draco said.
Draco opened the top to see the paperwork for a man with a deep laceration in his leg — released, no permanent damage. And the next, an older woman who didn’t make it out of the A&E — deceased. And then the young Auror with the face wound — released. Diagnosis, permanent blindness in her left eye. Draco paused. He turned the file around for Marcus to see.
“Not what I meant,” he said with a roll of his eyes. “I have no privacy. Anyone I date is either there for the attention or ends up hating me because of it. Muggles don’t know who I am. It’s easier that way. Without the expectations.”
“Someone?” Hermione asked. “Harry, are you seeing somebody?”
But Love had found Draco. And while it didn't come with the comfort and clarity he'd hoped for, Love arrived unequivocally, irrevocably, and without mercy. It was less a warm ray of butter-yellow sunshine parting grey clouds, and more of a brick to the head, or a swift kick to the gut with steel-toed boots.
“Merlin, I think Granger has knickers more substantial than that,” he says, with a shake of his head.
Potter laughed outright, and Draco thought perhaps someone had let loose two dozen pixies in his chest. He really shouldn't tease Potter. And he certainly shouldn't try to make him laugh. He ought to ignore the tosser completely, with his easy smile, strong arms, broad chest…
“Draco,” she gasped. Her willowy hands clutched his sleeve as she drew him closer. “I told them it had to be you. That it couldn’t be anyone else. You must help him. She didn't mean any harm. He knew that. They trust him ever so, but he got too close.”
One of Pansy’s greasy attachés reappeared, a frosty martini glass in each hand. Pansy took them both, sniffed, then glared at him. “You’re joking, right? What is this swill? Try again!”
Emile was fit, that was for certain. Draco couldn't help but watch him, and maybe that gave Emile the wrong impression. Draco didn't watch Emile simply because he was beautiful and charming and charismatic, though he was all of those things. Draco watched him because sometimes, out of the corner of his eye, Draco would see that tousled coif of dark hair, those bright eyes against olive skin, and think, if only for a second, that Potter was there.
If it weren’t for the pain of the stretch, Draco would have come straight down Harry’s throat. As appealing as that sounds and as badly as he wants to paint Harry from the inside, he also wants more. He has one shot, and bloody hell, it is going to hurt once it is over. He might as well make it worth it.
“It’s the real estate listings, Potter. We’re going to find you a new house.”
"Full of surprises," Potter said under his breath, as if speaking to himself. He held out a hand to Draco.
“No,” Draco says. “I’m going to bed.”
Draco clucked his tongue and accepted a wet kiss to his temple. “Serves you right.”
The corners of the Daily Prophet crumpled in Lucius’ tightening fist and Draco heard him inhale sharply. Narcissa wore a look of mild alarm as Lucius pushed from his chair to stand in front of Draco.
Draco smirks, but his heart sinks.
“Yeah, I know, fuck you.”
"Right. They needed it, and you had it. Probably would have got away with it. But it was
“Best gift?”
Malfoy smiled sweetly at Harry over his shoulder as Ms. Witherbottom guided Harry toward the back yard.
Draco groaned. The last thing he needed was images of Potter in leather trousers knocking about in his skull. Hell, pretty much any mental images of Potter were a decidedly bad idea with the way Draco's dreams had taken to torturing him nightly. He dared not admit it to Pansy, but he was feeling rather run down. Even on the nights he turned in early, he woke feeling as though he'd gone ten laps around the Quidditch pitch.
to stay. I
Potter raised a brow. “Oh, we looked into it. In fact, I looked into it personally. You were...ah…fine.”
Potter stepped back a pace, and Draco barely held back a keening whimper at the loss of his heat.
Draco barked out a laugh. And once he started, he couldn’t stop. He laughed long and loud with his head thrown back. He grabbed the box out of Harry’s hands and tossed it onto the kitchen counter. He flung his arms around Harry’s neck and kissed him, hard, and Harry’s look of baffled confusion melted away, his face splitting into a grin.
“Harry Potter, it is a
"So, you'll give your statement? It's protocol, after all," Potter said.
"Pans, stop. I don't want to talk about it." He dropped the Prada wingtips into the suitcase next to the Ferragamo’s then strode across the room to collect the suit. He tried to shoulder Pansy aside to get to it, but she barely even teetered on her high heels.
Draco boggled. “Who the fuck would I want to see, Pans? Just because you’re skipping around merrily with a bunch of Huffllepuffs and ruddy Gryffindors these days does not, for one second, mean I want to see them. And they
"You said that the last two times," Emile said with a sigh. Actually, it was probably more like five or six times, but Draco had only recently let Emile in on his process, simply because Emile was clever, and Draco thought he might be useful. Also, he was easy to talk to, and it kept Draco's fellow students off his back. Apparently, muttering to yourself all the time was
“You’re a snob and a lush, Draco Malfoy.”
Potter chuckled, head lolling back against the chair. “Charlie told me not to. But there’s just something about someone telling me no that makes me want to do it more.”
“You need to charm the higher-ups if you want your little organisation to get its footing, right?” Pansy asks, and Potter shrugs. “All the money and fame in the world aren’t going to open the pocketbooks of pureblood society if they think you don’t know what you’re doing. In fact, they’ll happily spit on your shoes, if you give them the chance.”
“Five Card Draw?” Harry asked.
"I don't have to do a fucking thing, Emile. This is my
"Well, well. Look who crashed the party," Pansy purred over his shoulder, startling Draco out of his glowering strop.
Harry was pulled from his thoughts when Hermione came bustling up with a pretty witch with chestnut hair and a sweet smile in tow.
They greet acquaintances with polite handshakes and how-do-you-dos as they make their way to the bar, where Pansy orders a Pinot Gris and Draco a double whisky neat. They sip as they survey the crowd, pretending they aren’t seeking anyone in particular.
Potter's hands found their way into the back of Draco's trousers, warm, sure, and welcome. "Definitely not."
Mark bought Draco another drink, this one clear with a couple of olives in it, because he said Draco looked far too posh to be drinking such swill. This drink tasted like the forest after rain, and Draco found it far more palatable than his first, which Mark warned might have been petrol.
“Sounds about right.”
“I have work to do,” Draco said, training his eyes on the parchment in front of him.
Harry keened. “
Potter’s eyebrows got lost in his hairline.
“Temporarily. My reasons for returning to England are purely entrepreneurial. London is the next biggest market, and it's the obvious choice if I intend to expand my business,” Draco said with a sniff and a generous wave of his hand, unlit cigarette still perched between his fingers.
“Like what?” Blaise’s voice was closer.
He nodded. "She's talking, according to Bridges. Been a huge help. Though you might be out an employee. She's moving back to Dublin to stay with her mum, or that's what Bridges gathered."
Theo glances across the room and lifts one eyebrow, then shakes his head. “Hagsville.”
Draco groaned and pulled back as much as he could, but Harry chased after him. He sucked Draco’s bitten bottom lip into his mouth, worried it between his teeth.
Draco scowled. Irma would probably get him decaf, anyway. She said he was a terror after too much espresso.
Draco stepped in close. He placed one hand on Potter’s shoulder, warm even through the cotton shirt he’d thrown over his vest when the sun leached away. Then, he threaded a leg carefully over the back and settled behind him, hips pressed against Potter’s arse and arms wrapped around his middle, clasped together just above his navel. He rested his chin on Potter’s shoulder, and the engine revved as the growl crescendoed into a roar. Potter kicked off, and they barrelled forward at breakneck speed.
“No, you didn’t.”
"I am a man of propriety, if nothing else, darling. And Hannah makes the best cappuccino in London. I am only as charming as I need to be, and I must confess, I need her."
, Draco thought. He didn't dare look at her, fearing the worst; that he'd been recognised and was about to be booted out on his arse. But before his fears could manifest, she scampered away, back inside the café.
Draco rolled his eyes. "Circe's tits, Pans. Just wear the fucking glasses."
The Wednesday after Harry’s accident, Draco received an owl. It was incredibly fortunate because Draco’s days were beginning to drag, one bleeding into the next, only differentiating themselves as days with Harry versus days without him. It was obvious which one Draco preferred, but he decided not to get his hopes up that he would hear from Harry, as that would only lead to disappointment, frustration, and eventually madness. He was fairly certain he was already on the verge.
Draco expected it rough and hurried, and wouldn’t have minded in the least, because just like every time Harry got his hands on him, he was desperate for it. But Harry slowed his movements, his fingers wrapping around Draco’s cock with something that almost felt like reverence. The heat of his gaze flickered across Draco’s face, warmer than sunshine, and Draco could feel it even without opening his eyes.
Potter sat up a little straighter. “Am I interrupting?”
“Pity,” Malfoy said, his eyes raking up Harry’s body one final time before he busied himself with the squealing teapot.
“Such jealousy, Draco. Afraid I’ll charm your young man away from you?” she asked, smoke leaking from the corner of her mouth.
Draco did turn then, but Weasley was already gone, stepping back into the interrogation room, the door shutting behind him.
"If you consider dark, brooding men with mad hair, stubble, and a hero complex attractive, then yes. I suppose he looks passable."
“I see.” Jerry was frowning now.
The room was suddenly too small, too warm, too crowded. He could feel the panic blooming in his chest, cold and creeping, as it worked its long fingers around his neck and squeezed. Soon, he would be gasping for breath. He knew the signs all too well.
“I don’t read the papers,” Potter said.
Harry folded the silver paper around the photo and cradled it against his chest.
“Oh, shut up,” Draco retorted, though it didn’t have any bite. “What about you? Why don’t you fall in love with some Hufflepuff and have a crup and a picket fence and spawn some brats, if you’re so keen.”
“Well, Miss Melgren, I think it’s fair to say, your surgery was a success!” Marcus said, his voice effusive and face beaming.
Potter smirked and bit his lip. “Wouldn’t you like to know.”
"What?" he snapped, spinning back around to his notebook, though the words blurred together, his eyes unblinking.
, not like Draco. They could build their shiny new lives and put the war behind them, but Draco would always be on the outside looking in, no matter how many lives he saved with his work, no matter how many times he proved he had changed. It would never be enough, and it was preposterous to think things could ever be different.
Draco had lingered in a state of denial for weeks, though his Portkey had long since been booked. He reminded himself for the thousandth time that he ought to be pleased that his hard work and perseverance led him to such an opportunity. But the mere thought of returning to England made his stomach roil and his throat squeeze shut.
“Well, this has been...illuminating,” Draco said, stubbing out his cigarette and draining his gin. “But, fortunately, Harry and I have somewhere else to be, which is...over there. Somewhere. Away from you. Goodbye. Have a nice evening.” He grabbed Potter by the shirtsleeve and dragged him across the room toward the bar, where he promptly ordered two shots of tequila. The Americans always drank tequila when things went to hell and that particular moment seemed as apt as any.
Draco rolled his eyes and poured a bit more in her glass.
“So, what, you’re trying to fatten me up? Give me cavities? Seems a bit below your station, Potter, but it must be something.”
“Unfortunately, I think Potter might be thicker than even I realised,” Pansy says. “He probably thinks you’re just being friendly.”
“Draco and I met here a few weeks back, didn’t we, Draco?”
didn’t throw
Potter watched him, fevered gaze flitting between Draco’s slick cock, the pink flush of his chest, and the feral hunger in his eyes. And when Draco sat back and lined himself up, Potter’s focus didn’t demur. He licked his lips and tightened his fists around the bars of the headboard, one calf sliding against the outside of Draco’s thigh. It was an oddly soothing gesture and an invitation if Draco ever felt one. Without further hesitation, Draco took a deep breath and pressed in. He buried himself to the hilt in one smooth movement, lube easing the friction.
But he doesn’t.
“You want this?” Harry asks. “You want me?”
“Is it, Harry? Is it really? Do you mean to tell me that no one else aside from you is capable of doing their job? That is always
"That's… unusual," Draco admitted. "You think it's a Muggle sympathiser?"
you live, Potter?”
“I like living with you,” Harry says with a helpless shrug. “I like… having you around.”
"Yeah, I'm here," Potter said, sounding strained to Draco, but maybe that was his hopeful imagination.
Surprise flickered across Potter’s face. “That’s true.”
Draco shoots a sharp look at Blaise. “You didn’t tell them?”
"Right you are," Draco agreed.
Harry felt his face flush red and when he chanced a look at Malfoy, the slimy git was grinning at him, smoke curling from his nostrils.
Draco cursed as Harry ground down in Draco’s lap. They were both hard already — it never took long. Draco existed on the knife-edge of arousal every second he spent with Harry. He assumed it would fade over the months as they continued to see each other. Thought that it would ease into something softer and more comfortable over the many nights Draco spent in Harry’s cabin, or during the equal number of nights Harry spent in Draco’s London flat. But it didn’t. If anything, it grew sharper.
The desk was creaking, and Draco was clutching at Potter's hair, scraping blunt fingernails across the back of his neck as he pulled Potter's mouth against his own. They kissed messily, all teeth and tongues, and it was perfect, it was bloody brilliant and Draco was going to come. He was going to come in Harry Potter's hand, pinning him against his big important desk in his big fancy office and just the
Draco held up both hands. "No, Madame. You owe me nothing. That was our agreement."
“Probably. I haven’t decided. Let’s find out if you’ve earned it, shall we?”
"Don't need them, remember?"
"I skim them," Draco admitted. "I thought the elections were coming up. Why would there be a vote so close to the elections?"
Merlin. Draco needed a drink.
Blaise highlights something on the document in front of him and waves an idle hand in Draco and Pansy’s direction. “Draco and Pans have generously offered their assistance with the party planning.”
Draco shook his head and squared his shoulders. “No, you’re alright. This isn’t the first run-in, unfortunately.” He sighed, running an exasperated hand through his perfectly coiffed hair. “God, it’s like adding bloody insult to injury.”
“No, you’re alright,” Harry said, but at least he was back to smiling in that crooked, fond way that Draco was becoming a bit addicted to.
“My, Harry, so sensitive.” He skated the tips of those fingers up Harry’s length, a touch so light it was little more than a tickle.
"I've had too much champagne to Apparate," Draco said, straightening. "Shall we get a taxi? I've been practising."
"You're early," Draco said, stepping forward to take her hand and kiss her cheek. "And a bit overdressed for a soft opening to a bloody potions shop, don't you think?"
“You’re bloody right, I would have! It is totally unfair the things you lot got away with. And you’re an absolute idiot for telling me this! What’s wrong with you? Honestly.”
"Yes, that's the bloody problem! And can't you call him Harry? After all this time?"
"I wanted to think about it for a while." Harry shrugged.
Potter's hands moved from his face to grip his shoulders, steadying him. "Breathe. Just breathe."
"And I also realised I was still stupidly in love with you."
"I have to," Draco said with a shake of his head.
“Oh my
Narcissa gave him a polite smile. Draco suspected she knew he was lying, but was too afraid to admit it, or too frightened of setting off her husband.
, but — if someone were — someone who isn’t me, of course, if he perhaps—”
He nodded. “Break in the case.”
Pansy let out an exasperated sigh and shut her magazine, dropping it on top of the stack. “It’s just a party, Draco. And since I know, for a fact, that you will be in town and available, I saw fit to invite you. You are one of my oldest and dearest friends, are you not?”
Draco shrugged. He’d meant to clean that up but was too busy moping and waiting on Harry to be bothered.
Draco reeled back, blinking at her in surprise. Pansy held one scolding finger up to his face.
"I've been thinking about this," he said as he ran his palms up Harry's thighs. "You have no idea how much."
"Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck," Draco whined. His fingers dug into the skin at Potter's shoulders, probably causing blood to pool in the crescent moon indentations left by his nails, though he couldn't see it. He couldn't see anything. He was too afraid to open his eyes again.
“About?!”
“Draco told me you’re a gardener, Harry,” Ms. Witherbottom said to Harry, pulling his attention from puzzling over Malfoy. “This house has the loveliest little patch out back. Come look.”
Pansy scampers over to the rack at the far end of the room as Draco sorts the money in the till and makes a couple of notes on his inventory form.
Draco shook his head, resigned, and continued his angry stalk to the Floo.
Emile frowned. "What is there to understand? Did you not call me at near dawn looking as though you've seen a ghost? What are you really doing in London, Draco? That isn't your world anymore. Those aren't your people. You've told me a hundred times; they will always see you as the child you were. They have suffered as you have, and their memories are just as long." Emile paused, and he leaned forward, his expression imploring. "Tell me the truth. Have the dreams started again?"
The words had barely fallen from Draco’s lips and Potter was on him again. His hands, no longer held in tight fists, were viciously tearing at buttons. Gasping into biting kisses, hissing at the first contact of skin and against skin.
“It’s convenient, is it?”
“Get out of my office, Potter. I’m busy. And take this with you,” he said, prodding the cup again.
Their kisses grew messy and desperate, and Draco hardly noticed when the sun sunk below the horizon and blinked out, leaving only the fading ombre of gold to deep purple in the sky.
It was no matter. It was a relief, honestly. Draco had an incredibly productive day and his desk remained clear of poisoned coffees and Potter’s presumptuous arse. And if Draco made more trips past the DMLE than necessary, it was only because it was on the way to the canteen and Draco needed another cup of tea, some biscuits, a file from Mildred in accounts payable, oh, and would you look at that? Draco’s tea was empty again, he ought to get some more.
“Why would you be afraid?” Draco asks blandly — too blandly — while studying the ceiling.
“You want me to fill you up and fuck you, nice and slow, while I tell you how incredible you look spread out beneath me, how you were made to take my cock.”
"Suit yourself." Potter gave him a funny little salute, grabbed his drink from the bar, and disappeared into the crowd.
with his feet in the pool when he found himself confronted by a rumpled Harry Potter positively
Draco shook his head, and suffered a painful flush of embarrassment that made him want to flee, to crumple to the ground at Potter’s feet, to bloody
It was only his first week in England and Draco was already going out of his mind with boredom. He paced Blaise’s penthouse like a caged cat. He raided Blaise’s closet and wine cabinet. He watched the telly and leafed through his record collection. But mostly, he wanked on every surface, just to spite Blaise for leaving him behind.
“Save it, you slag. Think about it, Draco. He’s a ruddy Gryffindor –”
“I quit,” Draco replied with a shake of his head.
He almost forgot about Ginny's warning. That was until Harry saw Draco Malfoy standing at the bar, sipping champagne with Luna and Parkinson, wearing the sharpest dove grey suit Harry had ever seen.
"Alright then," Potter said with a shrug. "Wanna dance?"
Harry's smile spread slow and sweet as honey. "Yeah. I'd like."
"You didn't seem to give two shits about that last night!" Potter exploded. "Don't lie to me. This has nothing to do with that. Just say whatever it is you want to say to me."
"Certainly not!" she exclaimed, then leaned in. "And I might make an appearance at the after-party for Magda Munson's spring release. You should come with me! I'll get you in a pair of her leather trousers if it kills me."
The nerves that fluttered in Harry's gut were there because he wanted Draco to be pleased — hell, he wanted him to be
"You have no bloody right to talk about Luna that way, you nasty little twat."
Weasley snorted. “Who? You’re joking, right?”
. Slim with broad shoulders, muscled forearms, dark hair, dark skin, darker scowl.
the way out of our trousers this time."
Hermione’s frown deepened. It was no secret that Harry had gotten into it with Briggs. Unfortunately for Harry, Hermione was the smartest person he knew, and he had no doubt she was already starting to put the pieces together. Harry wanted desperately to escape her withering disapproval before she figured it all out.
Harry shifted the weight between his feet, unsettled. “Does he know you’re telling me this?”
Draco just smiled into his coffee. Potter used the loo to change this time, thank Merlin, and returned to the kitchen in last night’s suit trousers and Draco’s t-shirt, a lime green Mungo’s shirt he'd acquired after the last intra-department Quidditch match with his name emblazoned in curling silver script on the back.
Now he was saddled with the wanker for the next two months and Harry was certain that Robards had done it on purpose.
Theo nods towards Potter. “And if he doesn’t see the way you look at him, doesn’t see you for who you are, then neither is he.”
“And you have Lovegood to blame for that. She put it on your hospital paperwork.”
"Malfoy, so nice of you to join us. I see Bridges didn't need to resort to…" he lowered his voice, "desperate measures." Behind him, the brutish Auror — Bridges, apparently — patted the cuffs on her belt, and Potter winked at her.
Draco wobbled his head. "There is something charming about her, I suppose."
“From the Muggle shop. I know Harry likes to smoke when he’s drunk. Or brooding. You better give that back to him, it looks like he’s barreling towards both.”
Potter must have recognised the invitation for what it was, because he gusted out a shaky breath that cooled Draco's fevered, sweat-damp skin, raising goose pimples in its wake. Potter's fingers disappeared for a fraction of a second, and Draco heard him mutter a word under his breath. There was a rustle of fabric, and Draco lifted his head from the mattress to catch as Potter's wand sailed across the room. He barely touched the thing, eyes intent on his right hand, then dropped it back to the floor. And when those fingers returned to Draco's body, they were wet.
Harry smiled into his drink. “Yes.”
Harry rolled his eyes. Even the incredible view couldn’t make Malfoy any more palatable. “I’m good, thanks. Let’s get this over with. Wand.”
Draco wastes no time. He yanks the bow tie from his own neck, because it’s hard enough to breathe as it is with Harry looking up at him with bright eyes and flushed cheeks, and then sinks down into Harry’s lap. Draco rocks forward to press their hips together as he places a hand on either side of Harry’s face. He kisses him, and Harry opens easily for him, sucking his tongue and running hands up Draco’s spread thighs to grip his arse.
bloody sofa and —
"So you
It wasn't until many hours later, while Draco sat on the front steps outside his flat, a glass of wine in one hand and cigarette pinched between two fingers, that Hermione's warning came back to him in a startling burst of clarity.
. Wanting Harry Potter would never be anything but a crisis.
still sat on the counter where he'd left it, and he reached out a hand, pulling it closer until he could see the headline and the photograph of Harry Potter with his face tucked into the neck of another man, who grinned with lowered lashes.
Harry’s chuckle was throaty as he nipped at Draco’s ear.
“Happy birthday, Harry.” Hermione kissed him on the cheek.
For all that Mr Walton was round, his wife was little more than a wisp, lost beneath the heavy folds of her formal robes as she glided up to them. Draco kissed the papery back of her hand, unsure how she lifted it with the weight of the diamonds on her fingers.
It wasn’t that Potter was unfriendly to those around him. He waved back to anyone that acknowledged him with something more than blatant gawping. He even offered a hearty hello and a friendly handshake to the head of Magical Sports and Games.
“My god, Potter, how ever do you keep your head atop your shoulders with all that weight?”
Draco wiggles his wallet from the tight back pocket of his trousers. “How about this: I give you whatever I’ve got inside, and you let me keep the wallet. I got this one in Milan, handmade! I’m quite fond of it.”
“Don’t you?” he replied.
“Oh, gracious no,” Draco gasped and tugged it from Harry’s hands. “If you have any love for that hideous thing, do not leave me alone with it because I promise you, I will
Draco snorted at the thought. Maybe dragging themselves through the mud would prove worthwhile for the Parkinsons, but there was no redemption for the Malfoys. They may have narrowly avoided life sentences in Azkaban, but imprisonment awaited Draco nonetheless.
“Hi,” Potter said, stepping up to Draco. His smile straightened, but his eyes glinted dangerously, causing wild starbursts to explode in Draco’s chest.
“Tell me, Marcus. What do you know about Harry Potter?”
Potter’s responding laugh is so loud, Draco feels it bang against his chest, even though he does not know what’s so bloody funny.
, but he said nothing.
Draco threw back his head and laughed. Because truthfully, no. He’d never thought about being anything, really.
Follow me on
Draco’s orgasm burned low in his belly, a simmering ache that expanded and then slammed into him. It knocked the wind from his lungs and blacked out his vision as he grunted, every muscle in his body tightening and cramping to the point of pain, then releasing all at once as relief flooded his veins, leaving him tingling and gasping for breath.
“Don’t do it, Draco,” she said with an exasperated sigh.
“No shit,” Draco drawled with a roll of his eyes.
Harry lines himself up and pushes in, tearing a shattering groan from Draco, the arms propping him on all fours shaking, threatening to give way. Draco takes it so well and Harry smiles, pleased, as he gives an experimental thrust of his hips, luxuriating in the tight drag around his cock.
“Sure,” Harry replies. “You’re so skinny I bet that cold cuts right to the bone. And I’ve seen what happens when you try to cast while drunk. I don’t fancy taking you to Mungo’s when you catch that excuse for a shirt on fire. Again.”
“Harry Potter is no longer with the DMLE,” she said succinctly as she straightened her robes and tucked the parchment into her briefcase with a wave of her wand.
The balcony wasn't empty, as Draco had hoped. There was a small group of young men smoking fragrant cigars and drinking scotch so peaty Draco could smell it from the doorway. There was a cluster of young girls speaking in hushed tones in the opposite corner, and a stuffy old goblin and a paunchy wizard with a beard were in the midst of a heated argument at the far end.
He glances up, distracted by the lovely, blotchy blush across Draco’s chest. But while Draco’s long fingers should have been threading into Harry’s curls like usual, they are instead thrown over his face, covering his eyes.
"Don't worry about him," Potter said with a shake of his head.
Draco wasn’t fool enough to tell Ginevra Weasley that he was looking for Potter, because if there was one person the Weaslette guarded with equal ferocity, it was Potter. The man had a bloody ginger army forming a perimeter around him at all times, and it was as exhausting as it was impenetrable.
In two days, Harry would turn twenty-eight. He looked around him at the old and grizzled faces, as well as the bright and hopeful ones from his year. He didn’t see himself in any of them. If he had so little joy in his work by twenty-eight, there’d be nothing left of him by the time he reached forty.
“Better now that you’re here,” she said with a saucy grin that made her wrinkled face look ten years younger.
"One of the better ones this season," Weasley agreed. "Did you see Pike take that dive at the end there? Thought he'd gone mental and fallen off his broomstick. Of course, Harry saw the Snitch even before he did. Announced it and everything, casual as you like."
Draco spins around to face him, smoothing the wrinkles from the sleeves of his shirt and stuffing the front of Harry’s shirt into his trousers. A French tuck is the perfect blend of casual and put-together, and it suits Harry well. “Yes. Where I’m going to fuck you after we make an appearance at the after-party. You wanted a bed, didn’t you? I’ll even let you buy me dinner. Or perhaps breakfast tomorrow?”
“I see,” Potter said. He stretched his legs out in front of him so that they tucked just under Draco’s desk and Draco had to scoot his chair back to avoid bumping the toe of his oxford against Potter’s clunky boot. It only reinforced Draco’s assumption that Potter had no sense of spatial awareness.
Draco resisted the urge to wipe his damp palm on his trouser leg and took Potter’s hand, and they went whirling through space.
“You aren’t curious at all? You don’t want to know why you can use my wand when no one else can?”
“Yes, thank you. Thank goodness you checked, Potter. Not sure how I managed the trip to my flat all these years without you.”
“What the fuck was I supposed to do. You’re clearly not going to do anything about it, beyond rolling around feeling sorry for yourself. It’s pathetic and a little embarrassing.”
“No. You can’t. But why you don’t leverage it more often, I’ll never understand.”
Draco dropped his suitcases in the entryway and took a deep breath.
Draco groaned and pressed the entire length of his body against Harry's. Gods, he was so bloody warm, and Draco was certain he'd never need a warming charm again if he could just keep Harry close enough to ward off the chill. Harry slipped a thigh between Draco's legs, gasping into their kiss when he felt Draco's interest resting hot and heavy against him. Draco shifted his hips, dragging his already half-hard cock against the firm muscle of Harry's thigh and fuck, it felt so good. Draco pulled back just far enough to catch his breath, but Harry kept their hips aligned with a tug at the waistband of Draco's trousers.
"On schedule," Draco replied. "That's why I called. I need you to send over the last of the stock I set aside before I left. I've got the storage warded, and I'd like to get everything in place sooner rather than later."
Draco snorted. "From you? Not bloody likely. And anyway, who says I'm going home? Well, not my home, that is."
The other two men shared a look, then Weasley shrugged. “Need a ride?”
“Everywhere,” Draco sighed. “And nowhere.”
Weasley smiled, like the daft person he very clearly was, and gathered the harness from its heap on the ground with a spell. He guided it to the Jeep and dropped it into the front seat, then corralled Potter and Draco into the backseat. And while Draco did
Just then, Draco's forgotten potion popped loudly, then exploded, dousing them both in purple goo. Draco's eyes went wide and without thinking, he grabbed his wand from where it sat unguarded, tucked into the pocket of Emile's trousers, and shot an Augamenti at his face, then at his own, drenching them both.
McConnell strained against his bonds; his angry mumblings muffled by the magical gag across his lips.
Draco did, although he took his time about it. He didn’t want Potter to get the idea that he could order Draco around like that, pointing and grunting one-word commands like some kind of uniformed ape.
Harry grinned so wide his eyes crinkled and his dimples reached devastating depths. And right then, three things about Harry Potter became clear to Draco. They were things that Harry’s friends had told him, though he’d been unable to truly understand them before that moment. The first was Weasley’s warning that Harry would never say a thing outright. The second was that Harry said the most when he wasn’t speaking at all. And the last: that loving Harry was the easiest thing in the world. All Draco had to do was convince Harry to let himself be loved.
“What?” Draco asks, suspicious.
“Get that filthy thing away from the wound,” he said as he approached. He pushed Weasley’s shirt away and grabbed Potter by the wrist. He took out his wand and pulled Potter’s arm straight, making him hiss. “Fucking idiot, Potter. Something is wrong with your bloody brain. Riding dragons, honestly,” he grumbled as he cast a series of cleaning spells and a few quick charms to help the blood clot.
. That part never failed to surprise Draco. Draco didn't expect to see Potter again, but the following Saturday, as he nursed a gin martini at the bar, scanning the crowd, Potter tipped his whisky in Draco's direction, and Draco's heart thundered out a beat so loud he could almost hear it over the music. He resisted the urge to approach Potter for a full fifteen minutes before curiosity got the better of him.
Potter's finger's in Draco's hair were beginning to tighten, fingernails scratching deliciously against his scalp, and he knew if he kept it up just a little longer Potter would come down his throat, and Draco would welcome it.
But then Harry saw his mum’s face in his mind, smiling out from that frame, cradled in silver paper and his hand tightened on his pint glass. He just couldn’t parcel out the meaning behind it. Deep down, Harry knew what he wanted it to mean. He wanted it to mean that the frisson of
As far as scars go, Draco thinks Potter’s looks suitably dangerous. He’d once found it hideous, an ugly gash across Potter’s sort-of attractive face. But now that Potter is grown, it makes him look mysterious.
now occupied every crevice in his mind not already dedicated to work, and a few corners that were. It was frustrating, maddening, and it took all of Draco’s significant self-control to keep from just throwing up his hands to the heavens halfway through a follow-up exam with a patient because Draco’s brain decided to supply him with a detailed image of Harry in the back of Weasley’s Jeep — eyes wild and magic whipping around him like a storm. Or when he accidentally paid the tea cart witch three hundred Muggle pounds for a watery cup of coffee and a dry scone because he was too busy thinking about the way Harry’s hair looked splayed across a white pillowcase.
Harry cranked the volume and the tinny riff of a guitar flooded the room. The drums thumped a few times, followed by a tuneless sort of singing by a man who sounded like he had a stuffy nose. Draco winced.
