“What kind of things do you learn?”
, in fact, in his garden back on Olympus but in a room that was lit only by several lamps in the corners of the walls that looked like they were filled with… magma?
“Do you hate being a sex worker?” Harry asked, curiously.
, we’re done. I’m fucking
Harry was like a fire. He was destructive and hotheaded and passionate and simply unable to be contained.
!” He screamed, kicking and biting and fighting as wildly as he could. The stranger’s grip didn’t loosen, and in fact the arm wrapped itself around his waist and held him firmly.
“I’m sorry, come again?”
“If I may ask, why did you decide to come and work here, out of all places? From what I’ve heard, your grades were stellar, and you could have done
He slipped in a third finger, pushing on Draco’s prostate insistently.
Rufus felt his eyes widen. “Wait! Wait, Potter, what do you want? I’ll do- “
“Did you not hear me the first time? I said I want you to sign my arse.”
“Kouroi!” He jumped and spun around. Standing behind him, in her ethereal glory, was his mother. Her cacao eyes blazed with godly fury, and her skin was starting to glow a bit. Draco tsked in his mind. She always was quick to her temper.
Draco paused and looked down at the direction of the voice. Standing in front of him was a little girl who couldn’t have been more than a few years old. Her dark brown hair was combed and put into two neat buns, although Draco could see some curls sticking out of them.
Ok y'all. I have absolutely no excuse for being absent for 4 months. I am a terrible person.
“I wish to see my father.” When the image formed, he gasped. His father was lying on the floor of the forest ground. His leg and side were clearly mauled, and he wasn’t moving.
“I- I’ve never done it before,’ Draco lied. Well, that was a bit of an untruth, but he wasn’t about to tell Harry the details of his sex life. “I’m not sure.”
“I- I can’t take anymore.”
“Yes, Mr. Harry?” Her voice was soft, but clinical, Draco noticed.
“Asphodel,” he said. To be truthful, he hadn’t been paying attention at all to the woman, but Asphodel was where a majority of the souls he judged went to, so it was the safest option.
“Harry carried you here,” Pansy replied.
“Anyways, you two can leave now. When you come over, you can ask me whatever you want.”
Draco was shocked and not shocked at the same time.
“Do you not want to do it, dear?”
.” He sneered.
He continued this for the next hour until he finally finished. Harry’s hair was still a bit tangled, but in a far better shape than it was before.
“And how did he take it?”
“Harry, they’re attacking us! We can’t hold our own for long!” Hermione cried, shaking him as hard as she could with her tiny arms.
“I don’t know how you make this so good.” Draco said over a mouthful from his third bowl. Harry laughed.
He was
. He didn’t even know why he was getting turned on just from a simple touch. Well, Draco did have that effect on him.
“What’s up?’ Cormac smiled at him. Draco shrugged.
“So, what can we do for the collab?” Draco asked as he took a bite out of his cookie.
"Next week."
They separated a minute later, breathless but happy.
“I love you,” Draco whispered onto Harry’s lips.
“He still is.” He said ruefully. He started talking to her about his day, only interrupted by his father’s yell from the kitchen.
He left his crown behind, and didn’t bother to fix his hair or his chiton either. When he got to the flowers, he took a moment to merely admire them before bending down to pluck some.
“A Compilation of Greek Playlets and Tragedies: Volume I.” Draco’s heart lurched. He had only read a few of the Greek playwrights, and while he loved them, there weren’t many in the local library to read.
more organized with him in charge. But Harry was not honest at all, and there was no way in Tartarus he would even say that to anybody.
“Draco, you have to make sure that you don’t fall for his tricks. He’s a
He held back a sob as he searched through the forest desperately.
Harry laughed at that. “You really are something.”
Anyways, I hope you like it •>•
“I’m just being careful, Draco. And you really shouldn’t snap like that. People will avoid you.”
“Great. Let’s go.”
‘Yeah. Do you?’
Draco froze. “Oh.
, I’m so sorry I asked.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “I would be much happier if they avoided me, thank you very much. I don’t know how or why you still tolerate me.”
Draco was still in shock. TheGoldenSnitch wanted to do a
“Alright,” Draco said, not really paying attention to it. He walked over to the nearest sofa and sat down to read, not even wiping away the dust on his clothes.
“Where am I?” He wondered to himself quietly. He needed to find his way back quickly so he could find his way home.
Harry felt his cock start to rise rapidly and strain against the cotton of his boxers.
It turned to Draco, its features looking worriedly. As it lifted Draco up from the ground, Draco passed out.
“Demeter?”
Anyways, is the ending of the chapter too abrupt? I'm not sure.
.” Draco begged. With a snarl, Harry snapped his hips and pushed in all the way to the hilt. He started to pump in and out of Draco’s tight, wonderful,
“Wait!” Draco shouted. Harry froze, immediately lowering his hands from Draco’s hips.

“Me.”
He knew that he loved Harry too.
However, after a few seconds, the black magic sunk into her flesh, with nothing happening after that. The kings, who were waiting in excitement (clearly, Harry’s bloodthirst had rubbed off on them), frowned when nothing happened to the woman.
“Just wait.” Cormac whined, holding his arms down and pressing up against him. He leaned forward-
"Why did you want to marry me?"
As Potter recounted the story of his childhood, Draco felt the sickening feeling in his stomach become bigger and bigger. When he finally finished, he looked expectantly at Draco.
Harry, Ron and Hermione all nodded. “That would be great.”
of his time there. He didn’t really mind the thought.
Suddenly, he heard a tree branch snap. He froze. Slowly, he turned to his left and almost wet his pants. There was a very large man standing a few feet away from him. But the man looked… animalistic. Even more so than the beast. The man had fur on his face, claws, and looked distinctly… wolfish.
He sighed and pulled off the silk covers from his body. The orange-red glow of the sunrise lit up his room and tinted his skin to warm shades of peach and honey. He slipped off his night gown and stretched widely, grimacing as his bones cracked and shifted back into place from lying down for so long. Since his mother was fast asleep (and would probably be so for the next few hours, at least) this would be the
Harry immediately noticed his reaction. He sighed.
“I mean
Draco and Hermione were in the break room when the alarm sounded, and they had both stared at each other in shock before Hermione sprang into action, locking the doors and closing all the windows. Draco sat in shock before she tapped his arm impatiently.
big thing.”
“Hey love.” Draco looked up from his book and sighed in relief.
As he gets lost in his nostalgia, he fails to notice the front door opening and the sound of soft footsteps fill the quiet apartment. He only notices when the figure leaning on his doorframe clears his throat rather awkwardly. He immediately snaps up his head and instantly gets lost into those pools of fog swirling with specks of blue ink.
“Harry?” No response. Draco let out a soft cry. “No,
Cedric suddenly grinned again, which disoriented Draco for a moment. “Alright then. I shall see you then.” As a parting gesture, he picked up Draco’s hand in his own and kissed it softly. Draco blushed heavily, momentarily blindsided.
“Ah!” Draco mewled, his back bowing impossibly upwards. “What is- what is
“Draco, tell me what happened.” His voice was deep and sent shivers down Draco’s spine.
“Harry!” Hermione scolded, swatting his head with her hand.
Harry smirks at him. "Done talking?"
He wondered what he would see this time. He was sure that his parents wouldn’t be in the scene anymore; despite the fact that he still missed them and loved them dearly, he had come to terms with their death. Perhaps he would see himself as a famous Quidditch star? Or something else?
“’Kidnap’ is a strong word, you know. I’m simply taking you into my domain for some time.”
“Relax, boy.” Draco spun around but didn’t see anyone there.
He waved and walked up to them. Harry discreetly adjusted his ripped jeans and black tee. He might as well look nice for Draco.
The twelve astronauts descended from the space ship onto the base station on Planet Polus. It seemed that two of them, the blond in white and the brunette in red already knew each other, judging by the way they were tangled up with each other.
“There goes poor little Malfoy!” Draco groaned and turned around to face Seamus Finnegan and Dean Thomas. They liked to taunt him about his family’s poverty and lack of status.
Harry’s about to give another answer, before he remembers the French man from just a week or two ago. He feels his cheeks heat up again.
was a very rich man). Draco had insisted on cooking the normal way, although it was hard, considering the different kinds of plants and animals here compared to Earth.
.” Draco gasped. Harry slowly pulled out of him until only the tip remained inside, before pushing in quickly. Draco yelped.
“I wanted to give you something.” Harry’s tone was apprehensive.
She rolled her eyes. “Whatever, Malfoy.”
“You can try. Nobody’s ever managed to untangle it before, and I doubt you could.
appreciate getting hot meals more than once a week.
Draco laughed into his chest. He allowed Harry to whisk him away from the ballroom. On the way, he caught his parents’ eyes. Narcissa winked at them. With the palace physicians back, Harry had arranged for her to receive the best medicines in the kingdom. She had recovered very quickly, to Draco’s delight. Lucius raised his glass to Draco, winking. He scowled at Harry, however, who simply responded by making a face. His father was still wary of Harry, but Draco knew that he would come around soon enough.
Mandy reached into her purse and brought them out, handing them to Harry.
“What?”
Draco smiled to himself as he filed Harry’s nails. Draco had finally convinced him to have a spa day where they just relaxed and gossiped. So far, it was doing them a world of good.
. I- she’s not bad at all and I really like her and
“He’s kind of a big deal though. He has like ten
The way it had all started was funny, really. Instead of becoming an Auror after graduating from Hogwarts, Harry had instead remained in Grimmauld Place to take care of Teddy. Andromeda had contracted a rare magical strain of polio, and while it hadn’t killed her, she had lost the use of her lower body. Harry had offered to take care of Teddy for the nest year while she was in motor rehabilitation; she agreed happily.
“There’s no point, Harry.” Draco murmured. Harry ignored him.
“Come for me, love,” Harry said roughly and swallowed around Draco’s cock again. Draco moaned loudly as he came in Harry’s mouth, whimpering as Harry swallowed his come and licked the head of his cock relentlessly.
anything by it. It was just for business. Nothing more.
husband spread across the bed, all he saw was Draco in Harry's Weasley sweater and red booty shorts eating straight from a large jar of Nutella with a large silver spoon. In front of him was Harry's laptop, the bright colors from it shining on Draco's face.
It had gotten over three million likes in just a day. Draco counted that as success.
The townspeople cheered as Harry led Draco to the middle of the wedding hall. They had decided to get married in the palace, and it had not taken long to convert the ballroom into a suitable location.
Draco knew that he looked just as, if not more ridiculous than Harry. His own hair was in pigtails, and he had a charcoal face mask on. He had just taken the cucumber slices off of his eyes a few minutes ago.
Draco couldn’t think of anything but how Harry’s warm breath felt against his ear and how much he smelled of Old Spice.
“That’s surprising. What’s someone as rich as you doing with a whore?”
“They’re doing fine, but I can’t hug you now.” Draco laughed, holding up his dirty hands to show Harry. He had taken to gardening, as it was the only was he could get fresh air. Harry didn’t let him go out, but it was only because Harry wanted to protect him. Besides, Grimmauld Place (well, Potter Manor, really) was big enough for him to explore any room he wanted when he was bored.
"Draco, love I'm home!" Harry called out, closing the door behind him. He was about to call out again when he noticed a trail of rose petals on the floor. They started at the doorway, and went all the way to the hallway, where it led into the door of their bedroom and disappeared.
Thankfully, Zeus got the cue. He winked at Harry and vanished into thin air, leaving his throne behind to disintegrate into small particles of light.
he act like everything was alright?
“I’m alright. Just unprepared for the temperature drop.” Draco admitted sheepishly. The man smiled at him.
Harry remembers how soft his arse was, and he feels his face heat up even more.
“I don’t want to even look at them.” He growled. Draco pouted, and slid a hand down his bare chest suggestively.
Draco was already lost in the sensations and Harry had barely even started yet.
“There’s no point whining about it now. You can do something else for him another time.”
Harry hummed. “I like you.”
“Yes, my son. Kouroi.” Zeus threaded his fingers with each other and leaned forward.
“Oh well, I had assumed that you would be a good person to tell my
Harry smiled softly and walked away from Narcissa Malfoy’s dead body to Draco, shaking his head when the blond tried to scoot away from him. The protective bubble he was in was very strong, and wouldn’t even break to the toughest of spells.
“If you don’t have anything more to say, then you can leave. I wish to be alone.” Harry said.
“It’s me, Harry! We went to elementary and middle school together!”
"You could have gone for someone much better-"
“Are you coming, Draco?’
“Can you come untouched for me? Can you, love?”
Draco pulled Hermione back, and patted her back. He scribbled into his notebook again and handed it to Harry.
“Oh my god!” Draco exclaimed.
Draco nodded, trying not to blush. It wasn’t everyday handsome guys flirted with him so openly.

Draco lets out a satisfied hum (which sounds almost like a small moan) and watches with a small smirk as Harry signs his arse.
annoying.”
Blaise and Terry eventually had to drag a screaming Hannah away from the cafeteria and into the airlock room. They ejected her with just enough oxygen to last for a few minutes before she would eventually die of asphyxiation.
A few erratic thrusts later and Harry was coming deep inside of Draco.
“W-what?” Harry blushed. Draco rose an eyebrow.
"So why were there rose petals on the floor?" Harry asked, moving to sit down next to him on the large bed.
Harry grinned. “How about I take you out to coffee?”
“Ok, I get the point. And you can call me Harry.”
“Are you seriously
Now, it was time for the Herbologists to start restoring Earth to its former glory.

“Father! Are you here? Please answer me!” Draco shouted desperately.
“Are you sure you still want to do this? You
Harry looked at him straight in the eye. “Are you in love with me?”
“Don’t say that.”
Instead of answering, Draco took Harry’s cock into his mouth all the way down to the hilt.
With a deep breath, Harry got up and sprinted out of the room, barely hearing Ron and Hermione cheer after him.
Draco switches it to
It was a bit easier now that Harry had shrunk a few inches. He was still taller than Draco, but only by about a couple of inches now compared to the whole foot from before.
Things were mundane for the next two years until Harry had met Draco working in
Draco frowned as Harry led him into the empty ballroom. It was dusty, and it was illuminated only by some flickering candles in the chandelier above.
"Who doesn't?"
Over the years, humans had become smarter and colder. Most people lived alone, save the lucky few who managed to find love in a cold world like this.
It was almost time for the party, and Draco had nothing to wear. There were countless different outfits in his wardrobe, each one more beautiful than the last. There were his cloudy, translucent himations that were made of morning dew and enticingly showed off his godly body. There were the chitons made of gentle springtime winds and white rose petals that caressed his skin like a teasing fingertip. There were even some robes spun from brilliant gold thread and woven electrum threads that sparkled in the sunlight and would surely make him stand out in the crowd (despite the fact that he hated people pining over him, he
“No,” Draco replied. He wasn’t going to give in to this monster.
“Time to meet!” A loud voice echoed over the speaker. Draco swallowed the remains of his meal cube, prying the gummy bits out of his teeth with his tongue as he left his hover-house and sat at the door, his legs dangling hundreds of feet above the ground. He took his gravity boots from the mudroom and put them on, making his way towards the giant tent in the center of all the hover-houses surrounding it. When he walked on air, Draco liked to look down at the world below. It looked beautiful and ugly at the same time.
Draco scowled as he handed her the coins. “How did you know where I was going?”
Draco nodded and continued to eat his lunch, grateful for the change of subject. But as Granger continued to rant, Draco found himself thinking about what she had told him. How was he acting different? As far as he was concerned, absolutely nothing had changed about him. Well, maybe one thing…
What do you think?
Draco gave him an odd look. "Are you blind? I'm eating."
Ever since that day, they had spent all their remaining time together, chatting or playing around or fucking. It was even up to the point that Harry had booked Draco every night for the foreseeable future.
Hey guys! I'm so sorry I've been gone for so long, but I hope that I can start regularly updating now! I've planned it for once every two weeks, so I hope that works out! Also, I feel much better so that's a plus too 🥳
“You’re a really cool guy.” He remarked. Draco laughed.
. On the outside, however, he merely raised an eyebrow.
A harsh tug on his shoulder yanked him out of his thoughts. He looked down at Hermione, who’s brown skin had turned a sickly pale color.
It had been a few hours since he and his mother had gotten home, and he was bored out of his mind. His mother had retired to her bedroom the minute they arrived, leaving Draco all by himself. He had tried sleeping but gave up after an hour. Where was Hypnos when you needed him?

“Please please
Draco hummed nonchalantly as he summoned the potions and candles from the shelf right behind him. “You’re lucky you came now. I’m almost out of Calming Draughts.”
“Coming right up.” Mr. Ollivander disappeared into his shop to get the fish. As Draco waited, he felt a presence behind him. He turned around and met the broad chest of Cedric Diggory. He groaned.
“But... why are you doing this? Killing people?”
Draco didn’t bother to correct him. The git wouldn’t listen to him, anyways.
“Who says we can’t fuck over there? I’m sure Scrimgeour would
At least Harry’s father was easy to read; his face was in a look of pure shock and fury.
Harry gripped his cigar tightly and took another puff. How was his little darling the result of his
“Get the fuck off me!”
"Promise that you won't laugh." He sighs.
Once they arrived at his room, he hastily made to run inside. Before he could, the beast lifted up his small hand and

, and not sleep around like his own father did. As far as Draco was concerned, nobody had met his requirements, so he was not taking anybody. Besides, it wasn’t as if his mother would just send him off to anybody, anyways. She was even more adamant about him remaining a virgin that
“Bye.” He said weakly, as he all but ran out of Harry’s room.
Harry ignored her and continued to stare into the mirror. There was only a little bit left, and even that piece was starting to form spiderweb cracks in it.
I'll update this week (I actually promise this time.)
“No, we can’t.” Draco’s voice was a bit too breathless; he cursed himself.
Aphrodite’s palace glowed beautifully in the dark blue sky. Pastel colored lights illuminated the interior, giving it a soft glow in the dark. There were many people mingling outside, some more drunk than others. He was fairly sure that at least one of them were naked. Probably a minor god and a nymph. He shook his head at their childish antics.
Suddenly, food appeared onto the table out of the blue. Draco shrieked.
he’s gotten himself into.
“Hello, mother.” He said softly, accepting her weak embrace. “How are you?”
“Go tell her that I shall attend the party. Now begone!” He picked up the scroll from the platter and unrolled it as the servant quickly vanished.
Cedric smirked to himself as he fastened his cloak onto his broad shoulders. Really, it wasn’t hard to convince the mental asylum warden to lock up the old Malfoy patriarch (not without a bribe, of course).
He appeared in front of their flat and opened the door slowly, as not to shock Draco if he was in the kitchen.
Harry held him, rubbing his back until he was spent.
“How did I get here?” Draco asked curiously.
“I can’t believe you asked them to play this.” He smiled as they started to step in time with the song. It had taken several lessons, but Draco was now proficient in ballroom dancing. Well, slow dancing at least.
Before he could sit down to eat, he felt a warm breath on his neck. Trembling, he turned around slowly and came face to face with a monstrous creature.
“Too dark for you. Try this one.” She pushed forward an emerald green long sleeve jacket and black leather trousers. Once he did, Draco had to admit it was beautiful. The shirt buttoned all the way down to his waist, where it split into a V and ran down open to his calves, exposing his legs. The trousers hugged his legs perfectly, and the black laced boots Pansy had given him completed the look rather well.
Surprisingly, it had cleaned up well. Its horns and calves were gleaming, and its claws were trimmed to a much shorter length than they were before. It was wearing a midnight blue cloak over a white shirt- which was partially unbuttoned, showing Draco its hairy, human chest- and matching blue trousers.
He slowly pushed his tongue into Draco’s tight hole, holding Draco tightly enough not to allow any movement. He licked at his clenching walls and savored the choked breaths coming from above. Draco tasted clean and sweaty and musky and heavy on his tongue, and Harry
. I want to go home!”
time.”
“Where are you going?” The beast growled. Draco ignored it and started walking out of the room.
As he was about to talk again, his father’s voice filled the house.
When Draco finally realized what was happening around him, he laughed weakly.
The part he liked the most was the gold clip he had used to put his hair in a messy bun on the top of his head. It was studded with rubies, and it looked magnificent.
Harry’s mother burst into tears, but Harry barely spared her a glance. Instead, he picked up Draco and took them both upstairs, ignoring his stricken parents behind him.
“Why are you yelling, sir? And who are you?” She asked, politely.
In just two weeks, the killer had struck again. This time, it was Ron.
"Um..." He starts, not knowing how to explain himself.
As Cedric left (not before sending a sly smirk to Potter), Potter scowled at his retreating back before turning back to Draco.

“And who are you to tell me?”

The waitress handed them their drinks and left. Draco eyed the open bottle warily. It looked… alright.
Kore didn’t even falter or blink. “And I’ll call you worse if you don’t answer my question!”
After a few more tense seconds, Harry finally finishes with a flourish and drops the marker onto the floor. He doesn’t even realize he’s sweating until a large drop of the salty liquid drips into his eye.

Once Draco had typed in the passcode for the gates (it even had a fucking
Potter stepped into the room, and Rufus felt his blood chill. He looked exactly the same as he always did–messy green hair, bloody red grin, purple suit, and trousers–but the way he stared at Rufus made him fear for his life even more.
"Nice choice." Harry smirks.
“No! It is too dangerous.” His mother shook her head. “Please, my dear.”
Harry leaned forward and shoved all of the papers on his desk onto the floor, not even thinking twice about it. He could always sort them out later, and his only priority now was to fuck his husband senseless.
“I was just testing out some new flowers I created, mum. I think that I may have found a way to create grains just from their blossoms!” He said excitedly, hoping she would buy into it.
Draco involuntarily shuddered; the way Harry talked so coldly of humans was a bit frightening, especially considering that he himself was one.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry eyes him suspiciously, but doesn't say anything. Soon, Jade brings their drinks. Instead of getting to know each other, they just sit on the bean bags admiring the silence and the view. For some reason, Draco prefers this to mindless chatter.
He walked under the overbearing iron gateway and took several random turns until he was sure that he was lost in the blooming rose hedges and the pointed iron poles poking out of them. The path was wide enough for several people to stand in it side-by-side, which was just what Harry needed. The only thing that illuminated his path was the twinkling stars and the full moon in the indigo sky, as well as the flashing lights from Aphrodite’s palace.
“There are only two: you cannot leave the castle and you must stay out of the west wing.”
did this?”
Draco huffed angrily and yanked his hand from Harry’s grasp. “Fine.” He got up and stomped out of the office, slamming the door behind him. Harry winced and sighed as he rubbed his temples. Great. Now he would have to spend another five hours pampering Draco to make him happy again. Not that he minded much, but Draco was rather hard to coax when he was in a mood.

He quickly finished it off and looked around to make sure that nobody had seen him. Thankfully, nobody was watching him, and he used the opportunity to swipe and lick away the rest of the honey that had seeped onto his mouth and chin.
“That’s nice. What do your parents do for a living?” Draco asked. Harry’s face tightened momentarily.
“I give up!” It growled. Before it could leave, Pansy spoke up, hobbling towards the door.
“Draco.” Harry cut in, gripping his hands tightly. “It’s really ok. I’m used to it.”
Draco shook his head. “It won’t be as good as yours.”
“Are you sure?” He asked. Harry smiled and nodded. “How about your parents?”
"Calm down, Malfoy." Harry actually sounds alarmed.
constellation twinkled brightly in the sky, and Draco mentally traced out the shape. Of course, it looked nothing like a woman, but that was what the imagination was for, anyways.
Harry’s face tightened. “They’re dead.”
“I- goodbye Hermione,” he said. “I hope you have a good life.”
Draco laughed. “I’m pretty sure I can convince you to do anything I want you to.”

Draco Malfoy is fucking
Draco jumped off of the horse and ran up to his father
She sighed in exasperation but reduced her pace. Draco could see their house in the distance, standing majestically in the midnight blue sky. The lights were on, which meant that the servants were probably cleaning up the house and preparing it for their arrival. The party had lasted for several days, after all.
He pulls on a pair of blue satin pajamas. Yes, he still enjoys wearing matching jammies.
As he smoked, he closed his eyes and let his mind wander away, to his realm, to his little darling, to-
Draco let out a breathless shriek as Harry shoved his entire tongue into Draco without warning, before taking it out and using a finger to rub all the spit around. All he could feel was a tight ball of pleasure coiling tightly in his stomach, and he knew it wouldn’t be long before-
“Just one is enough.”
Truth be told, Draco was already
“Justin! Prepare my horse and my pack! I’m going to see what’s happening for myself.”
Harry stretched out his limbs after he left the court room, wincing as his bones cracked loudly. He had left court early, handing his seat over to Thanatos, who was more than used to this. If Harry had to be honest, he would admit that he wasn’t even half as responsible as Thanatos was, and the Underworld would be

As they took her away, she laughed coldly.
"Obviously. I'm probably the most interesting person you'll ever come across in your life."

Suddenly, the butterfly started to fly and flapped away from his finger. He watched it idly and trailed its path until he realized where it was going. There was an enormous patch of narcissus flowers, which made him gasp. They were extremely rare, and his mother would
Harry shrugged. “More efficient, a good alibi, and it’s better than being lonely all the time.”
I might still post a few drabbles, but probably nothing too wordy.
“Father! Please answer me!”
“Merlin.” He cursed. He needed to leave.
“Try this!” A coat on a hanger zipped towards him. It was a deep red color with golden linings on the cuffs. Before he could take it off the hanger, Pansy muttered “No… clashes with his skin tone,” and pushed forward a different suit. This one was a royal purple jacket, complete with a cream-colored shirt and purple trousers.
Thanks for reading, and sorry :((
“Fuck, I’m coming!” He cried. Harry pressed against his prostate insistently, and Draco was screaming his release. He gasped and clutched the bedsheets tightly as he came, moaning incomprehensible words and babbling helplessly. He vaguely felt Harry climax into him as well, and as he calmed down, he felt Harry’s come drip out of his hole slowly.
“Stand
“Can you at least be grateful?”
Draco didn’t know why he stayed, but something just drew him towards Potter.
“Don’t touch me!” The man snarled and freed Draco to attend to his pierced skin. Before Draco could scramble away, the man punched him in the stomach, sending him to the floor and taking away his breath. His head knocked against a tree root and he groaned.
As a response, Harry lifted up the fringe he had grown to cover his scar. Once the man saw it, he turned pale and scrambled away from the vanquisher of the Dark Lord at a very quick pace.
He cautiously made his way to the gigantic front doors of the palace. He left his horse in the stable and walked up to the palace doors, pushing them open. Rusty creaks filled the air. Inside the palace was very beautiful in a rustic sort of way. Gigantic crystal chandeliers hung from the domed ceiling, shining a light on the large dining table that was surely the length of his own humble abode, if not twice that. For some strange reason, on the dining table, there were plates of food and several bowls of soup.
“Yes, Harry,
He got up and ran up to the door, cursing as he realized that it was locked. He assumed that Cedric had proceeded to take him to the mental asylum, the bastard.
“It’s your prostate.” Harry smiled as he rubbed down on the spot relentlessly, making Draco quiver and gasp.
“Lemon drop?” Mr. Dumbledore offered. Draco chuckled and picked one from the little bag on the desk to put in his mouth.
The folded strap of his ivory chiton had slipped off of his shoulder, revealing his pale chest to the world. His long hair was already coming out of the braid he had put it in earlier that day. He had taken off his leather sandals and placed them on the ground to dry when the sun was still high in the mid-afternoon sky (he had gone to explore some nearby ponds a few hours before). His sacred crown, made of interwoven laurel leaves and cloudberry stems, had been thrown haphazardly to the ground beside him – he hated wearing it, but his mother insisted. Despite the fact that he was less than presentable at the moment, Draco had never felt happier.
He paused for a moment, just long enough to make Draco squirm impatiently. Then, he pulled Draco’s pale arse cheeks apart and licked a long stripe up his arse crack.
It was ironic that the Earth was nearly perfect, yet so desolate and bleak.
“Thank you so much, sir.” Draco smiled. “I shall see you again tomorrow.”
was interesting news.
As he smoothed his hair over, he heard a knock on the door. As it opened, he steeled himself and stood up to face the beast.
“Awwww, thank you cutiepie101. My arse is fabulous indeed.” He faked a hair flip.
He got up, groaning as he stretched. He started making his way to the other side of the palace. The west wing.
Harry shrugged. “You can try, but I’ll always come after you, love.” He had muttered to Draco.
. He would never understand them.
“Well, get over here then. Come talk about it.” Harry smiled. Draco sat on the bed with a huff and crossed his legs. Harry took his hand and started to put on a base coat of nail polish. Draco knew that he had skipped several steps in the manicure process but he refrained from pointing them out.
“It’s ok. Maybe we’ll meet up later?” Draco asked.
- replied. She walked towards him on her stumpy wooden legs, making him yelp and scramble away.
Ten excruciating minutes later, Draco finally arrived at the hospital. The nurses took one look at the bandaged man and sprang into action, gently ushering into the nearest room.
“Good morning Phillina. How are you?”
“It’s alright, love.” Harry murmured into the blond’s hair, ignoring the way he squirmed and tried to free himself from Harry’s tight grasp.
Before Harry could answer, Draco came up with an idea. He quickly put Harry’s hair up in a high ponytail and grabbed a fine-toothed comb from the dresser. He slowly traced out a narrow strip of hair at the nape of Harry’s neck and pulled it out of the ponytail. He combed it out until it was silky and smooth.
fall in love with him. Then, he would be Cedric’s to take and use as he willed.
. The man was an angel, sitting in his heaven and Harry was the forbidden snake, the poisoned apple that the man would bite into and fall into evil, into the darkness, into
too invested in his and Harry's pretend love life.
The piece of the Horcrux had stayed on the part of his soul that aligned directly with his heart.
“Oops.” Draco smirked. Some people in the chat seemed worried.

“Fine.” He snarled.
“Let’s get out of here.”
“Thank you, sir.” Draco smiled. He paid him quickly, and with a wave, was off to his family’s small cottage on the edge of the town.
"You were

“Hey Draco.” Cormac sounded a bit breathless. “I’m sorry I haven’t called you.”
with him. And there was a time that I caught him leaving Potter’s room with a love bite on his neck. When I tried to ask him, he told me that it was just his boyfriend. And I believed him, somehow.”
Draco picked up a small potion from behind the register and bagged it with the other tooth ache potion.
“There.” Harry stepped back, satisfied. Draco quickly gathered himself together.
Draco looked at the person’s face and gasped.
“Thanks. It was my godfather’s.” Harry smiled. It was clear he was fond of it.
Harry picked up a small handheld mirror from the dresser and handed it to Draco.
?” Draco gasped. He and Harry had been best friends for
a monster. He had spent several sleepless nights pondering about it, and each time he came up with nothing. He didn’t deny that Potter hadn’t committed crimes or anything, but he definitely wasn’t the stereotypical supervillain he had expected to see.
“Yes, me. I am an enchantress from the North. I have heard of your arrogance from all around me and decided to come and see if the rumors were true. Unfortunately, they are.”
He moaned again when Harry’s hand strayed down to his arse, kneading it and squeezing it gently. The other moved to his cock and started to pump it gently.
where the Horcrux had been on his body, and how it had blackened the part of his body where it had resided.
The day had been particularly hard on the two of them, and they were no closer to finding out the mystery killer than they were three weeks since Pansy had been ejected.
Draco glares at him. "Sod off four-eyes."
“Father! Are you alright?” Draco rushed into the kitchen, only to see his father clutching a piece of parchment tightly, smiling brightly.
” Harry groaned. Of course, she just had to bring the time when he had needed her help to try and make Ron and Hermione fall in love with each other (it was merely for the benefit of the Underworld as a whole – their combined intellect would make Harry even better off than he already was - and
Potter scowled. “Shut it, Malfoy. Anyways, I came for a Calming Draught. And some of those lavender candles you’ve got.”
The fact that Harry's being this poetic was another sign that he's screwed.
Draco covered his mouth with his free hand, unable to contain his smile. On the back of the card was Harry’s phone number.
“What do you think?” He asked the small, unassuming butterfly. Its antennae twitched and bobbed happily, totally unaware of the mini crisis Draco was going through.
Harry growled and removed his fingers from the blond, almost coming at the sight of his stretched, shiny hole.
“Draco.” Even half-dead, his father’s voice was still joyful. Draco propped him up against a tree and began rinsing the wounds on his leg and stomach. His father winced but didn’t complain once.
“You didn’t have too.” Was all Draco said.
Cho didn’t really recall them from the space ship, but then again she didn’t recall anybody, really.
“What the
again.”
“I didn’t tell you to do that.” He muttered, almost fondly stroking Draco’s hair.
“Yes.”
“Lord Hades?” Harry’s eyes snapped open to see the three kings staring at him. “Your vote, my Lord?”
“Or else I’ll die,” Harry whispered.
“Why in the
Draco got up, dusting off his alloyed jeans as he walked back to his hover-house. He usually attracted people because of his exotic looks. There weren’t many natural blonds anymore; being a platinum blond was even rarer.

"What? I see absolutely
“Blaise is alright. A bit of a prick, but he’s cool.” Ron shrugged. Harry noticed that Ron and Hermione kept on stealing glances at each other, blushing when they were caught. A slow grin formed on his face.
He couldn’t believe that this was real.
His name was dracothegaynerd (quite a funny name in Harry’s opinion). Out of curiosity, Harry clicked on his username and got taken to his page. He had five million followers (‘Not bad,’ Harry thought) and the thumbnails of his videos looked interesting, from pranks to lip-syncing to transitions to showing off different kinds of outfits and basically lots of different kinds.
did you just call me?”
He was a fool to think that Draco could ever love a beast like him.
“Harry, you’re going to be fine. Just take deep breaths, deep breaths-” Draco choked out, the tears already running down his face.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Fine. We’ll talk for ten minutes and nothing more.”
“Oh!” Draco gasped. Harry growled and gripped Draco’s thighs tightly as he plunged his tongue into Draco’s arsehole, enjoying the clean, musky taste of it. Draco whined and squirmed, and kept on letting out these little gasps that drove Harry
Draco woke up in a large bed. He stretched, before sitting up.
“You lied,” she whispered. Draco bit his lip and said nothing. She gasped and covered her mouth with a shaky hand.
“See, you do it like
Draco ran inside the house to fasten his cloak and was met by his pale mother in the kitchen. She was leaning heavily on the wall, clutching the windowsill to support herself.
“You’ll come from my cock only.” Harry growled. Draco whimpered.

“Granger. I can look out for myself, thank you very much. Now if you’ll excuse me, I have a
“Are you close, love?” Harry teased. Draco whimpered and nodded. “No coming for you yet. You need to earn it.”
He sighed and shrugged off his lab coat, straightening out the creases in it before he hung it on the rack. The lights were off, and the only thing that illuminated the room was the streetlight by the corner of the building, filling his office with an eerie orange glow.
“How is school like?” Draco asked as they sat in the garden; it was his favorite place to be, and Harry often let him indulge in it.
“’Fuck’ indeed, love. Now, spread those legs for me and let me fuck you into a pulp.”
“Of course it is.” Draco said. “I’m a genius.”
"Now if you'll excuse me, I need to finish my face scrub Potter." And with a 'hmph' Draco marched away. Harry smiled after him.
“Harry,” Hermione’s tone was soft and gentle. “Even if it doesn’t work, we’re going to be alright.”
After their initial encounter, the two of them had just clicked, for some reason. They remained great friends for the next few months, and Harry had quickly developed feelings for the blond. When he told his best mates, Ron and Hermione had been skeptical, not because of who Draco was but because Harry had refused to see a Mind-Healer after the War.

As Cedric fished out the money from his pocket, Potter stepped up to the counter.

“And if you’re insinuating that I would cheat on my boyfriend, then- “
“Draco!” Draco smiled softly as the old man, Mr. Dumbledore, hobbled over to him. He was quite old but extremely wise.
“I’m alright. Where is Auxo?”
“I don’t care if you do or don’t.”
response to this man’s request. Before he can come up with something to say, the man huffs and blows away a long strand of white-blond hair from his eyes.
To his relief, he heard a muffled voice coming from upstairs. Draco rushed up the stairs, taking them two at a time.
“Why, only you, my dear.” Cedric smiled, sliding a muscular arm around Draco’s slender waist and pulling him close to his chest.
“I guess so.” Draco shrugged. Harry gripped his waist tighter, making the large shirt he was wearing bunch up.
“Nice to meet you, Draco.” He said.
with him? This had never happened before.
“But-but-” Harry silenced him with a soft kiss. “Please don’t cry, love. Everything will be alright.”
Before Draco could deny, the beast was already leading them to the center of the ballroom.
Harry was bored out of his mind. Hermione had all but dragged him to the bookstore to get her some new textbooks, only to abandon him with absolutely
to see one of them that had grown naturally! Not to mention that he would have
"Abghoost." Harry replies. He's not surprised that Draco doesn't know what it is. His dad's side of the family was Persian, so he had taught Sirius and his husband, Remus, lots of different Persian recipes and lots of other recipes he could get his hands on; they had taught Harry. Harry was a particular fan Mediterranean food and and West African dishes.
Draco rolled his eyes but didn’t respond. Before the beast could speak up, a cart rolled in through the large open doors at top speed, screeching to a halt at Draco’s bedside. As he squinted, he realized that Mrs. Weasley and the other people (well,
His anger at the beast doubled. How
The thought of his family made his hunger go away. He wondered with dismay how his parents would be coping without him.
Now he was walking briskly in the chilly weather, hugging himself tightly. Their flat was only a five minute walk from Hogwarts, so he decided to just go by foot. Now, he was regretting passing up the option of a warm, toasty car.
“How does eight sound?” Cormac said. Everyone nodded in agreement. “Sounds like a date then!”
Before he could come up with an actual plan, Draco came out of the backroom holding a bouquet of flowers that looked
“Harry, don’t listen to him. He’ll be down in thirty minutes. I’ll make sure of it.”
. Unfortunately, Draco wasn’t impressed.
“Unfortunately, I don’t have much time today. I was wondering if you could just read me a short story today.”
Draco whimpered again, but it was cut short into a breathless moan as Harry spread his arse cheeks and licked his hole.
The beast smiled again at him. Draco smiled back softly, before remembering who it was and sneered instead.
“Here you go, lad!” He turned and saw Mr. Ollivander holding three giant fishes. He gratefully put the fish into his basket.
gay for him. He could run over with a motorcycle me and I’d say thank you.”
?! His name is
Harry sniggered. “It’s really good!”
“Yes. To my base station on Planet X. You’ll never lack and you’ll spend the rest of your days in luxury.”
The next time Potter came around, Draco already had a customer around. Cedric Diggory, who was a vampire, was in dire need of something to help cure his tooth aches.
He slowly fucked Draco just up to that knuckle, making Draco sob in desperation. Harry smirked. This was what he wanted, so this was what he would get.
“Since you’re new to this place and all, I could give you a tour of Hogwarts and Hogsmeade.” His voice was deeper and quieter than it was before; it sent shivers down Draco’s spine.
, to be honest.
Harry looked at himself in the mirror, contemplating the recent events. Over the course of three weeks, Draco had started slowly warming up to him and the palace residents, although he still had his fits sometimes. Now, he had daily conversations with Hermione and had become good friends with Neville as well. He was even willing to talk to Harry sometimes, which Harry counted as progress.
Harry leaned forward to kiss Draco again, who returned it desperately.
supply. And Draco was here, talking to their son.
Like how he was pounding into Draco, his nails digging into Draco’s pale skin and ignoring Draco’s weak pleas for him to
“Hi Harry.” Draco smiled, putting down the phone and turning to face Harry.
Ever since they had started dating six months ago, Draco was sure that Harry was already used to his craziness. Now, Draco spent most of his time at Harry’s house (the one he had inherited from his parents) and was pretty sure that soon he would start spending
Wherever he stepped, the grass withered away, the trees cowered away from his dark aura. Even the animals knew better than to get in his way. The ground became a dying wasteland beneath his feet and all around him, but that wasn’t his concern. Demeter could easily fix that, anyways.
“I’m alright. I hope Cedric isn’t still troubling you.” She smiled.
“I’m alright, Mrs. Weasley.” He answered. Ginny hopped forward to the front of the cart, the tea in her cup sloshing around precariously.
? I’m just a hideous beast.”
“We’re your fucking
“Do you recognize me now?” She gleamed, wickedly. With a snap of her fingers, she transformed into the old hag the Prince had seen earlier that day.
Potter raised an eyebrow. “You really want to hear everything?”
to pass up.”
. The pet name made Draco’s stomach slip.
They walk to the counter. "Jade!" Harry calls out. A few seconds later, a lady comes out of the back room. She has a pink pixie cut, several piercings and tattoos on her arms. Draco only has one tattoo, which was on his ribs. It said 'Happiness can be found in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light.' He didn't know who had said it, but it felt... personal for some reason.
.” She said proudly. “You should go inside, though. We can practice in the afternoon before we go to Aphrodite’s party.”
He noticed a piece of paper tucked underneath it. With no small amount of trepidation, he took it, careful not to tip the flowers out of the vase and unfolded it.
Harry shrugged. He did that a lot. “Boring. There are only like fifty people my age, and I only associate with them for PR.”
Prince Harry merely laughed. “Get out of my sight, old hag!” And he kicked her out of spite and went on his way. Little did he know that the old woman was an enchantress in disguise who wanted to test the Prince for herself. Once he was out of sight, she hatched a cunning plan.
“Where could he be?” He thought. His mother was worried. Very worried, which made her even sicker than she already was.
, and the soft atmosphere of the flower shop made him look even more adorable. And he had
“I’m coming I’m coming I’m coming.” Draco cried. He clenched around Harry’s cock as he came violently against his pale chest, making Harry hiss.
Before Cormac could talk again, a waiter interrupted them.
“You shall come down for breakfast in a half-hour.” Draco recognized the chilling voice. It was the beast himself.
Really, it hadn’t been hard to get the villagers to rally. They were all fools.
“Um, now that I think of it, yes actually,” Cedric started. He leaned forward on the counter with one elbow and looked down at Draco.
Although she was a wardrobe, her voice was deadly. Draco gulped.
“Are you done yet?” Potter cut in, rudely. Draco put down his log and glared at him.
How was it his fault that people wanted to take Draco away from him? Harry knew better. He knew just how much everybody despised their relationship and hid it under barely-polished veneers of politeness.
Draco could feel his already weak resolve cracking even more. “I- “
“That’s the conservatory.” Draco gasped softly. The room was gigantic, and the domed glass ceiling let the bright sunlight fall onto the rows and rows of flowers and fruits.
As the party slowly started to draw to an end, Draco found himself being dragged back to the house by his irate mother.
“You!” He shouted.
Harry is immediately blown away by his new roommate. He has the palest skin, with hair like polished marble. It is in a neat bun on the nape of his neck. He isn't handsome, or even attractive. He is beautiful; he is elegant; he is all sharp angles and smooth skin. Harry blushes thinking about it.
“Do you want more, love?”
you.” Without registering what he was doing, he kissed Harry’s cheek out of sheer gratitude. Before any of them could react, Draco was already out of the door and running away at full speed.
As he approached the grand doors, he smirked as he sensed several heads turning to watch him in awe. Even though they were all drunk on godly wine, the movement still flattered him. Now, as long as none of them tried any funny business, he would be fine.
Harry shrugged. “Alright, I guess. It’s gradually becoming better.”
Hermione had really chewed him out for that one. He smiled wistfully. She had acted as if a mere tree nymph was worth giving a damn for! But then again, that was Hermione. Protector of the ‘innocents.’ He snorted and chuckled quietly to himself.
, out of his meadow? How did they even know where to find him in the first place?
“Father!” He yelled, running out the front door. To his dismay, he only saw the family horse, Aries, bucking wildly.
She didn’t follow him.
She looked nervous for a moment, before steeling her face. “I know what you’re doing.”
Draco waved at them politely.
He walks into the living room and oh
He did a double take, before standing up from the bed he was on (which was covered with
When Harry woke up, his soul was completely black.
As it was, now Harry had to listen to her rant and nag and lecture him about lagging behind on his godly duties. Surely, the world could survive on its own for just
When Draco finally released him, he looked a bit better than he did before.
They turned around and left the room, not looking back once.
“You have to let him warm up to you, Harry. You
“Yes, love?” Harry asked, immediately slowing.
“Yeah. Let me take you there.” They both got up and dusted themselves off. Harry led Draco into the house, which was as impressive on the inside as it was on the outside. There were floating bots, and lots of sleek edges. It was mostly white and pristine, compared to the outside world.
When he finally got Harry to his bed, he had smiled softly when he noticed a small teddy bear on his bed.

He screamed and stumbled backwards as a large chariot (which was being pulled by
He found himself in the green fields a few minutes later, the tall grass reaching up and tickling his knees gently. In the distance, he could see his mother’s palace standing tall and proud, the early morning sunlight reflecting off of the golden rooftops. On its sides, it was surrounded by flowers of every kind, ranging from aquamarine roses to orange sunflowers. That was mostly his own doing.
A lot happens in this chapter, so I hope you enjoy it. I hope its not substandard, but I don't feel like I did it as well as I usually do :/
Harry gives him an odd look, then shrugs and continues watching the movie on the TV.
Draco shrank back, and for some reason it made Harry feel
“Harry.” Draco said, firmly. The whole room went silent.
“If you ask me, Blaise is the suspicious one. He’s all quiet and mysterious and shit.” Theo snuffed, inspecting his nails haughtily as he talked.
Draco shuddered. “What are you going to do about it?”
?” Harry begs. He pouts his lip, and Draco had to admit, he looks fucking
‘Really? With you? Oh my God,
His father was lying on the cold ground, with blood pooled around him. Lying next to him was a blood-stained sword.
Harry and Draco sat in the back silently of the room as their crew members argued and shouted and screamed at each other.
"No, don't touch him! He's for Starfire! Get your hands off him!" He shouts to the TV.
Draco sucked in a breath. “What?”
Harry tapped the arm rest of his seat impatiently. “I’ve been busy, ‘Mione.”
Now, it was just Draco, Harry, Blaise, Theo and Terry left.
“I know what you’re doing with Harry Potter, Draco. And I need you to change patients.
Draco wasn’t one to deny an opportunity and turning away the brothel in favor of a circus was madness when he was so desperate.
In a trance, he walked into the garden, marveling the beautiful flora and plants. He was so fixated, he didn’t realize his patron standing behind him.
On the inside, Harry was
” Harry roared, pushing his mother away and cradling Draco into his arms.
. Like, I am
Draco watches the rest of the movie even though he has no idea what the fuck is going on.
“Nah. I’m used to it.” He shrugged. He handed it to Draco insistently.
“Oh, um…” Harry trailed off, rubbing the back of his neck sheepishly with a large hand.
Apollo slowly released his waist. “Fine then, sweetheart.”
Her foolish pride had ensured her ultimate demise. Harry chuckled to himself at the image. After he had destroyed her willow tree, it was quite enjoyable to watch her slow, painful death.
“That would be really nice.” Draco smiled. He didn’t feel the glare coming from behind them.
at him.
“He’s been with me the whole time.” Draco retorted. “He’s innocent.”
Harry doesn't know what Hogwarts is like yet, but from the website he had already started taking a liking to it. It had homey feel to it. Plus, his parents had gone here.
“Draco.” Bot 1 said. “You have been booked for tonight. Get ready to leave in thirty minutes. The rest of you, listen up.”
“Yes,” he whispered. “Yes, I am.”
Lucius snarled as he fought off the three wolves that had cornered him and his horse. They were vicious, biting at his leg and the horse, but even they were no match for the wrath of Lucius Malfoy.
He tied them all together with a string of twine and placed them in a small papyrus bag.
“Mandy!” Harry yelled. A HealerBot materialized before him.
“That’s tough.” Harry said, blowing on Draco’s nails to make the base coat dry faster. “How about your mum?”
Draco jumped and spun around. He saw the beast standing at a doorway to his left. He looked livid.
He arched his back into the contact, shivering as Harry swirled the nub around with his tongue.
He admires himself in front of the mirror.
"Shut up, you ponce." He muttered, kissing Draco's back softly.
"Draco Potter-Malfoy, you stop that right now." Harry cut in firmly. He reached up to cup Draco's
He stood up to get the phone on the dresser. It was Cormac. He frowned and picked the call.
“Be patient, love.” He could feel Harry smirk against his skin as he sucked love bites into Draco’s chest.
“Are you done?” Draco asked, inspecting his nails. They weren’t half bad.
Draco hummed softly to himself as he placed pot of hydrangeas on the open windowsill to let it get more sunlight. The shop was peacefully empty, the wind chimes on the ceiling tinkling softly in the breeze.
“Yes, it does.” Pansy smiled. “Now hurry up and brush your hair. He’ll be here any second now!”
Draco was
He secured it behind his ear and moved on to the next flower. A dove-white aster. Its myriad of petals were slightly curved inwards, giving it a rounded shape. He gently touched the pointed tips and pushed them even closer to the center as he looked up into the night sky. Astraea’s legacy would live on forever.* He knew immediately where she was; his mother had taught him how to stargaze when he was still young. The
Before he can speak up again, the audience of the show in the large auditorium cheer loudly, making both men laugh.
There was nothing he could do but wait.
“Why are you leaving?” It snarled, moving in front of him to block the door.
Draco shrugged and picked up his fork. “I know. He’s unlike any other patient I’ve had before.”
“And stay out!” The beast yelled as Greyback scampered away.
“It’s mine.” Draco says helpfully. Harry stares at him.
She sniffed, and Draco realized she was crying. The news anchor comforted her as she wiped her tears with a small handkerchief. “I just hope he’s ok. And I hope he- “
Draco hummed. “Can I have five of those, actually?”
"What do you mean?" Draco asks, even though he knows exactly what Harry means.
“Lord Hades, shall we banish her now?” King Minos asked, already starting to rise in his seat in anger. Harry’s smirk widened.
Draco was confused. It had been a week since the beast had apologized, and ever since then, it had been acting… strange. It was friendly and surprisingly charming for such a brute creature.
“So? Do you like it?” Draco asked, shifting slightly so he could grind his erection against Harry’s growing one.
Draco scrambled upwards and started to run away, but a large hand suddenly grasped his upper arm and yanked him backwards, and into the chariot.
“Good morning dear.” Mrs. Weasley chirped back to it. Draco still wasn’t sure what object Mrs. Weasley was, or what any
Cedric looked stunned for a moment, pressing his fingers softly to his now-red cheek. “Grab him.”
Draco howled in frustration. “
“Lord Hades?” Harry snapped out of his thought to see King Aeacus staring at him, with slight concern in his eyes.
"Ah." He sighs, content. Harry laughs at him again.
“Hey Hermione. Who’s this?” He walked up to them, eyeing the blond slightly. He noticed that he was in staffer’s uniform.
“If it is an invitation to a party, tell Lady Aphrodite that I will not be able to attend any gatherings for some time. I am quite busy with my duties and I cannot ignore them.”
“But I want to talk to you, love.” He pouted. He looked annoyingly cute.
Draco sighs as he and Harry get down. People are still staring. He walks briskly into the cafe, which is called Jade’s Java. It has a homey feel to it, which Draco likes. There are tables and chairs, but there are also teal beanbags next to the windows and folded blue blankets on the carpeted floor. In one corner, there are bookshelves filled with books and magazines. It looks bohemian and avant-garde.
“Thanks.” Draco flushed, wearing it. It smelled of pumpkin spice and an earthier, richer scent. It was too big on him, the sleeves dwarfing his arms and the hem of it reaching his mid thighs.
Draco cocked an eyebrow. “Why?”
“Wait!” He exclaimed. Harry had warned him about his stamina before, and it wasn’t his fault he was still hard. Draco was just being forgetful again. “It’s ok. You can keep going.”
Some time later (Rufus couldn’t tell how long it was) Malfoy stumbled into the room. His red and black bodysuit was half torn off his body, and there were several angry red bite marks and bruises all over him. His eyes had a sort of glazed look in them, even more than Rufus usually noticed in them whenever they encountered. Clearly, he hadn’t even bothered to clean up after his and Potter’s…

that his father would be able to hear him, so why wasn’t he helping him?
, although its pointed teeth made it look demonic.
“Thank you for joining me.” It said. Draco flushed, partly out of anger and partly out of embarrassment.
“Father!” He yelled. There was another staircase leading to another floor. As he kept on going higher, he kept on getting closer to his father.
“I love you.”
Draco usually talks to his reflection whenever he sees himself in a mirror. His mother used to joke about calling him Narcissus instead of Draco. Of course, that would have been weird because his mother's name is Narcissa.
Draco raised an eyebrow as Potter simply stretched lazily on his cot, before smiling smugly.
Soon, Draco came out with the flowers.
! Or I’ll make you wish you- ”
He's about to dismiss it when he notices the name of the person messaging him. Wait-
The next day, Hermione dragged Harry back to the bookstore to get some
“Get into the cart.”
He unlocked the glass doors and looked down at the package. He gasped. It was the purple carnations he had given Harry earlier. Only now, there were dozens, and each one had a silver filigree on the tips. There was a note nestled in between the petals. Draco picked it up, quivering in anticipation.
“Almost.” Draco sighed. “These things are
. The wood table was covered in a white tablecloth, and had a small vase of short roses in the middle. It was already set for two, with gold embroidered plates and cutlery. There were candles all around the room and the lights were off, which left the room with a soft yellow glow. There were even rose petals on the floor and the table cloth, as well as a cart next to the table that was full of food.
“Sounds good.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “What were you so busy with that has more importance than our assignment?”
To be honest, it was a very...
?” Draco gave him a murderous glare, but that was ruined completely when Harry reached down to massage Draco’s slightly swollen rim, making even more come leak out of it. He slipped a finger inside, relishing in Draco’s loud moan.
He ran to the door and tried to open it but it was locked.
“Hey, Draco!” Harry called out. For some reason, he was louder than he usually was.
“No, it’s perfect.”
Harry can do nothing but gape as Draco shimmies out of his leather trousers and-

“Why on earth is it called the Three Broomsticks?” Draco said, confused. Harry shrugged.

Draco nodded, looking away from Harry’s bright eyes.

They all started talking about people Draco had never heard before. Cormac was the first to notice his confusion.
“What?”
going to eat that squid leg.
“Hello, Chief. How are you faring?” Malfoy grinned widely and leaned against the unpainted concrete walls, not more than six feet away from Rufus. He gulped, and suddenly the room felt smaller than it already was.
It took all of Harry’s willpower not to jump in shock. That, and several centuries of his training as well.
“Harry?” Draco asked, cupping Harry’s cheek in his hands.
“But after some time, he started to act much weirder. He would get really defensive about Potter, and once he even told me that Potter was
He heard more muffled voices.
“Same as every day. Quite mundane, honestly. And also, Cedric is still trying to court me.” Draco grimaced.
Harry gripped Draco tighter.
The interviewer, a quite boisterous man named Seamus Finnegan, laughs loudly, and grips the handle of his chair tightly.
Draco sighs as he pulls his hair out of the tight bun it’s in. His skull aches. He brings out a fine-toothed comb for his pocket and starts to comb it out.
“What would that be dear Madame?” He asked, enthralled by her beauty.
“Please.” He gasped as Harry pinched his nipples lightly. He felt Harry smile into his neck.
The curse was broken.
Olympus was a glorious place. Even Draco couldn’t deny it. Each mountain ridge had buildings and houses more beautiful than the last. It was a blur of polished marble, pure gold and hundreds, if not
Then he remembered. The
He groaned. Of course, his attempt to escape would end miserably.
“Fuck, you were so good, love,” Harry sighed into Draco’s hair. Draco clutched onto Harry’s shoulders tightly, panting heavily as he felt the last of the aftershocks ravage his body.
“It’s alright, really. And you can call me Harry. Draco, right?” Draco looked up at Harry, who was smiling softly at him.
He tried to push Cormac away, but the latter was much stronger than him even when drunk.
Without warning, he flipped Draco around and pushed his chest onto the table. He positioned him just so that Draco’s cock hung off the edge of the table. Harry still cast a cushioning charm on the edge of the table, just to make Draco more comfortable. In response, Draco sighed and settled down into the desk.
“Surprisingly well. He’s mellowed out a lot over the past few years.” Draco replied as he turned around to shift some flower pots around on the shelf.
Without further ado, he cast a wandless lube charm on his fingers and rubbed them together to warm it up a bit. Then, he rubbed his middle finger against Draco’s pink hole, making it look shiny and absolutely edible. Draco gasped and bucked his hips. Harry gave it another small lick, before pushing in the tip of his middle finger, just enough to stretch Draco’s hole by the smallest amount.
“I’m sorry for yelling at you like that. But to be fair, I
like you, Harry!"
"I guess it was alright." He shrugged. Draco scowled.

“If you don’t let me leave right
“Good morning Mrs. Weasley.” Draco turned to the beast and was shocked that it was actually
“I second that, demonsareassholes. I
, I’m coming.” Harry moaned, and shot his load inside Draco’s warm mouth. Draco kept on sucking and humming, swallowing Harry’s bitter come eagerly. When Harry finished emptying his load, he pulled out of Draco’s swollen lips slowly, shaking his head.
Draco made his way over to a vine of grapes and plucked one off curiously. He popped it into his mouth and nearly moaned aloud. It was sweet and slightly sour at the same time.
“Why are we here?”
“Hey Ron, Hermione.” He smiled, picking up Ron and Hermione to set them on the table while keeping Crookshanks in his lap to stroke him. At first, Harry had hated him, but now he was infatuated with the damn thing.
Hermione hissed at him, and reached out to twist his ear. “Harry, what’s
“Told you!”
“Oh. Well, maybe this isn’t so weird, but I remember this French guy who asked me to sign his, um, behind.”
They both watched silently as all of the remaining crew members argued. They finally settled on Pansy as the most likely suspect.
“It’s amazing. Just wait and see.”
“Are you sure you want to come, love?”
Harry doesn’t know why he’s taking his time with the signature; sure, it was in an…
She rolled her eyes. “Kouroi, anybody with common sense would be able to figure it out. That being said, I don’t know how you’ve managed to keep it from your mother this long.”
“How? The moment I even suggest it they start looking like fucking tomatoes.”
“Thanks a lot, mate. I’ll see you around!” Potter grinned. He placed the gold coins on the counter, where they magically floated into the money register.
"Harry?" He asked after a beat of silence.
Despite himself, Draco flushed softly. “I know, mother. It’s just… you tend to overdo it sometimes.”
“Yes. He said quite bluntly that he thought I was handsome.”
“You’re making a mess everywhere!”
It looked like a world from a fairytale. Everything was so... nature-y. The were strange purple-leaved trees that were literally miles wide, each of them serving as a block of apartments. The houses were actually grown out straight from the ground, and the roofs were covered in leaves.
“Your old man here was trespassing.” It said, almost curiously. “And so are you.”
The sight of Draco looking so debauched sent Harry over the edge, and he thrust deep into the blond as he came.

Harry was just trying to protect Draco. He didn’t see what he was doing wrong.
“I mainly came here to ask for wedding flowers. My best mates are getting married in a few days and I have no idea what kind of flowers to give them.”
the episodes?"
about what had just happened.
“Now, put your right hand on my shoulder.” It guided. Draco blushed and placed them, although he had to stretch a bit because the beast was rather tall.
Draco also noticed that Harry kept on looking down at his arse when he thought Draco wasn’t looking.
Each table in the back was big enough to fit about eight people, compared to the smaller four seaters around the front. There were also booths aligning the wall.
Draco couldn’t sleep.
to help his current situation.
“My name is Kore and I
Ron and Hermione, his managers, are very unhappy about it but that's mostly because they have to spend their time sorting out Harry’s messages instead of shagging in secret (although, everybody knows they're shagging so it's not much of a secret anyway).
"I'm allowed to do whatever I want. Hmph." He stuck his tongue out at Harry childishly.
“You fiend.” he muttered, pulling Draco into a long, unhurried kiss. “Fine. But
Harry leaned forward and thrust into Draco again.
Around him, what was remaining of Malfoy Manor lit up the night sky with a show of impressive flames, no doubt terrifying the neighbors. It was only a matter of time before the Aurors arrived, but Harry already had what he needed.
He sat on it and groaned softly as his body finally relaxed. This was familiar, this was comfortable, this was his nature. Settling into his royal throne, ruling over everybody in his world and crushing any opposition with a simple command.
Mirror-Malfoy kept sweeping for a few more minutes until he dropped the broom and turned back around.
It had been a month since the start of their mission, and somebody had killed Parvati and Neville. Nobody had any idea who it was or why anybody would have any reason to murder somebody.
He sighs as he mindlessly scrolls through his Instagram feed. It’s getting a bit tiring, honestly, and he’s considering asking everybody to stop because his phone is starting to glitch from the massive influx of booty pictures.
.” His father had tears in his eyes, and Draco couldn’t bring himself to look at them.
To Draco’s horror, the horses started to gallop – back into the Underworld.
“Greetings, dear dragon.” Cedric flirted. Draco sighed.
Harry sneered at the dead body as he pulled his diamond-encrusted dagger out of its chest. The blood had managed to stain everywhere, including his new trousers, and he was rather annoyed by that.
“Alright, Kouroi. Let’s go home and get some rest, alright?”
?” Draco nearly yelled, shoving him back.
“Love you.” Draco smiled. Harry ruffled his hair fondly.
He dropped to his knees, still clutching the sword.
By the time they reached his bedroom, Draco was in tears.
to, but I guess I was wrong.”
Please comment! Thanks!
Draco couldn’t have anticipated what happened next. One moment, he was smelling some flowers, and the next the ground had split open and literally spilled out heat and molten rocks from the depths of the Underworld.
Draco looked at him like he was out of it. “No sex? Why did you order me then?”
Draco Malfoy is drowning into those pools of liquid emerald. The boy’s eyes are extremely captivating. With extreme effort, Draco pulls himself free from their grasp.
“By the way, I used the lotion you recommended!” And with that, Potter left the shop in a happy little strut.
Then their eyes met. Draco had to physically bite back a gasp.
Draco snorted mentally. The last time he had talked to a field spirit, things had not gone well. At all. Several terse words had exchanged, and he had never talked to another one of them after that.

** were at guard. Although they were sisters, it was easy to tell them apart. Thallo’s chocolate brown hair was in a neat bun, and she wore a dress made of rainbow beams and flower petals. Auxo’s curly, auburn hair was interwoven with borrowed bits of sunlight and pieces of the summertime sky into two neat braids. Carpo was the most serious looking of the three, and she was the only one who was holding her spear properly. Her simple, but beautiful tunic was covered by her chestnut-brown peplos.
“I thought I got rid of you, Greyback.” It growled, towering over Greyback. It bashed Greyback’s head against the tree again for good measure. Draco could hazily see the bloodstains it left behind.
Finally, he was ready for the party. The sun had already set a while ago, and if he had to estimate, he was about half an hour late. That wasn’t much, anyways. Aphrodite’s parties lasted for days, sometimes even
“No.” Harry said firmly. “I just want to talk.”
“Alright, how many?”
When they were in the cafe, wrapped up in blankets and admiring the view, it was all Harry could do to not pounce on him. The way the sunset's glow contoured his sharp face was ethereal.
"Hey!"
“Take him away,” he muttered, already flipping to the next piece of parchment in front of him. There was an unusually large stack today, although there weren’t any wars going on. Well, Harry didn’t
Harry didn’t miss the use of his own words being thrown back at him. He clenched his jaw and counted to three in his head, before he said something that he would regret later on.
“Draco,” he sighed. His voice was mostly calm now.
“Do you like it?” The beast asked him.
“Cedric, get away from Harry.
“Good afternoon, Mr. Potter,” Draco said once he entered the room. However, Potter wasn’t sitting in the chaise like he usually was. Instead, he was on the chair where Draco usually sat, holding a notebook and a pencil in his hands.
“No, I can assure my fans that I am definitely not a reptile working for the CIA, thank you very much.”
It was Harry.
“You’ll pay for that.” He snarled.
Ten minutes later, he landed in front of a
"Calm down, blondie."
“Leave him alone.” He had demanded, to their astonishment. The man looked shocked at first, then sneered.
“Hold it up in front of
Harry sighs to himself and switches off the stove. Since Draco is pants at cooking, he usually does the kitchen work. The one times that Draco tried to help led to disaster.
“You have no right to know that.”
He withdrew his finger and sent Mandy away, wiping his finger with the cloth.
And waited.
"Okay blondie."
Turns out there were some potions Harry
Draco looks at the menu over their heads. It's in chalk, but is written in beautiful calligraphy.
Harry’s breath suddenly became rapid and ragged, and he couldn’t help but imagine what lay underneath his darling’s beautiful outfit. Harry wanted to drag him away, rip off his clothes and
Harry sighed as he Apparated away from
He sighed and put the comb on the table. “This isn’t going to work. I need to do something else.”
“Harry,” he cried out weakly. When Harry continued to piston into him, he cleared his voice and called out to him louder. “
“Don’t worry mate, just try it. It’s amazing.” Cormac grinned at him.
“Wait! Ok wait, I’m sorry,” she said sheepishly. “I- I’m just trying to look out for you because Harry Potter is- “
Draco nodded without hesitating. He knew that this day would come, eventually. And besides, Harry needed him by his side. To help the citizens who had no clue they were being brainwashed by the city government.
Harry was now in front of him. He crouched down to Draco’s level and reached out to wipe the tears that were coming out of his eyes. Draco flinched and pressed himself into the wall.
Harry huffed a laugh into his neck. His breath was hot. “And what the fuck is that?”
“Where’s Father?” Draco asked, a sick feeling crawling into his gut. The horse nudged its head as if it wanted to take Draco somewhere.
(III)
“B-but what about your paperwork?” Draco tried. He whimpered when Harry pressed down on his prostate again.
Harry led him out to the airlock room, and Draco cried.
“You were the person last seen in the electrical room, Hannah!”
Draco scowled. “I hate my parents. Well, my dad anyways.”
“Fuck.” Harry sighed, falling on the bed next to Draco.
could do this to the blond.
? Just like… oh.
Draco nodded. “He’ll be helpful. Thank you.”
Draco departed the library and made his way to his family’s small cottage.
blind anyways." Draco commented dryly, making Harry laugh.
“Hello, Draco. I’m Hermione, Harry’s best friend. He’s talked to us about you.” She smiled warmly.
“I-I can explain.” Cormac sighed, rubbing a hand over his face. Draco held a hand up.
“My uncle used to hit me. And my aunt too. Any Dudley too.”
Once he opens it, he immediately gasps out loud. Embarrassingly, his cock starts to harden in his boxers, but he ignores it because
“Love you.” Harry whispered.
The servant gulped audibly and trembled a little more. “Lady Aphrodite said that I should remind you of the favor she performed for you if you refuse the invitation. She also said to tell you that there’s no way you can avoid them anymore.”
Harry pulled his cheeks open again and watched Draco’s hole clench right in front of his eyes. The sight of it almost made him come, just from how hot it was. He quickly reached down and pulled his erect cock out of his sweatpants, stroking it teasingly. He shuddered, before turning back to the lovely arse in front of him.
invested in Potter. Now he found himself thinking about Potter’s personality, his cheeky grins, the secret stares he would give Draco when he thought he wasn’t looking. Draco didn’t know what to think anymore. He even caught himself thinking of how Potter was actually quite handsome: his strong jawline, his tanned skin, his lean stomach, his
And then, as if the Fates were watching (and surely planning something cruel for him), the memories of the day before came rushing into his mind.
Harry grunted, but complied with Draco. They kept on repeating the exercises for several minutes until Draco saw Harry’s body relax.
Draco’s stomach filled with dread as the mirror began to swirl with mist. Soon, it formed the image of the beast lying on his bed, looking pale and sickly.
“You’re pretty cool too.”
Draco blushed. “I’d… I’d rather see you.” He said quietly.
“I know that you want him.”
There was a comfortable silence for a few moments.
Before Harry could stop himself, he asked, “What do you see?”

Harry stepped into the familiar room and inhaled the old scent of magic and dusty books.
Narcissa Malfoy looked imperious even in death, something that Harry had to admire. It seemed that the old Malfoy matriarch never let go of her pride, even if it cost her her own life.
“Don’t call me that.” Draco said, slightly annoyed. “And let go of me.”
And with those words, King Harry Potter and Consort King Draco Potter-Malfoy fell into a peaceful slumber.
They snuggled into the couch and watched their movie happily. And if they paused the movie halfway to make out, well, nobody had to know that.
“Don’t be greedy, love. Do you want me to
*koprìas - dirty buffoon
“If you’re making it, I’ll eat anything.” Draco moaned over the rich stew. Harry laughed again.
He still wore the hair clip in his hair. He smiled whenever he saw it in the mirror.
“You know, my uncle used to beat me up a lot,” Potter cut in, as nonchalantly as if he was talking about the weather. Draco felt his eyes widen. What?
“Any time from now would be good. I have a tight schedule, Potter.” He doesn’t even call Harry by his first name. Fucking hell.
