Hermione had given him a hug, of course, even though the last time he’d seen her she’d been shouting at him through the floo. And Mrs. Weasley had embraced him as she always had, though she had a sad look on her face whenever she looked between him and Ginny.
“You can’t say you don’t care,” says Draco. There’s moisture gathered in the corner of his eye, Harry can see it pooling there. Would rather look at his face than the ugly mark.
Draco’s cock is still resting wetly against his thigh when Harry finally detaches the scratchy lace bra. It’s ruined now; Draco’s teeth have torn a hole in one of the fine lacey cups. Harry almost feels a pang at its loss--it was brand new only hours ago--but then he reminds himself that he doesn’t exactly enjoy wearing those things.
Harry tuts at him. “Not busy enough I suppose,” he says and increases the speed of the vibrator. Draco immediately trembles, but his hips are also immediately still, wary of increasing the stimulation he’s already feeling. “That’s better,” says Harry and then he presses the tip of Draco’s cock against his hole.
Draco’s hands continue to work his shaft, holding him straight even as Harry tugs Draco’s mouth off him with a hand in his hair.
At first Harry thought through a number of answers he had given to others. When he’d quit, he’d told his boss he might like to work at the French Ministry for a bit. After the divorce hearing he’d told Ginny that he just needed to get out of England. To the few people he could call friends by the time he’d left, he’d lied that he had always been somewhat of a Francophile. All of these things could have been true, and might have been at one point in his life, but they weren’t the real reason.
It’s too much and still not enough. Draco doesn’t know if he wants it to end or go on forever. The vibrator keeps thrusting and he can’t hold back his noises any longer. It hurts now, the constant buzzing and pressure, and his whole body is stretched and shaking.
“Lovely to meet you, Harry. Would you like to come to a party with me tomorrow night, since Draco has neglected to invite you himself?”
At least he had tried, Harry told himself in the days that followed while he tried to adjust to a Malfoy-less world. It would have been worse to string himself along just to enjoy the other man’s company when he knew he wanted more.
Malfoy passed him a bottle of wine with an orange label and said, “Try this one instead, it pairs much better with fish.”
Two fingers ease gently into his hole and Draco whimpers as he’s filled again. Potter licks a stripe from the base of his cock to the tip, right over Draco’s fingers where he’s holding it.
They’re staring at one another over the dining room table in Draco’s rooms. Their forgotten dinner plates are pushed to the side, half-finished, the dessert untouched in Draco’s exuberance upon hearing that Harry hasn’t prepared his lessons for tomorrow. They’d not woken up together, but had met up for lunch and hadn’t left one another's presence since, not even when Harry had had to fetch his work from his tower office.
Perhaps sensing that he’s still hesitating Draco lets his expression relax again and says; “Please Harry, you know what I need.”
“Fuck that’s hot,” whines Harry. He’ll never understand how Draco can stand it, but he loves the thought of Draco walking around with an arse full of his cum.
Frederick looks confused, and anxious, and desperate, all looks Harry is intimately familiar with. It’s not that Frederick is bad looking; he might have turned Harry’s head in another setting, but he’s no longer new to this game. He can spot obsessive and unhealthy easily these days.
He clenches around Potter’s fingers who laughs and affectionately bites the globe of his arse. “Greedy. You’re not getting that yet. Not until you’re begging for it. Not until you’ve taken this.”
There were no more trips to Montmartre, no more parties with Lauren. Just Harry and listening to Malfoy complain about whatever the topic of the day happened to be while he drank bad coffee and sat in uncomfortably stiff chairs.
He’s wearing trousers under his robes tonight, so it takes Harry a moment to pull them off and part Draco’s robes around his chest and legs. The angle isn’t quite right either so Harry uses another cushioning charm under Draco’s lower back to lift his arse up. Draco’s mouth drops open again, probably thinking he’s about to get fucked, the tart, if the way he immediately spreads his legs is any indication.
In what Harry felt was a wise and diplomatic move, he decided not to inform Malfoy that he shouldn’t use the name ‘geranium’ if he didn’t mean to talk about them. “Right. What’s up?”
Malfoy was still bright red, and his face was still all wrinkled, but this news was apparently enough for him to lean forward in interest and rest one hand on Harry’s. It was instantly drawn away of course, but he’d done it all the same. “What do you mean, Moody was a Death Eater?”
Harry laughs and then reaches out to swing Draco around in a wide circle until he’s laughing. The featherlight charm is still on and Draco’s lying on his back suspended in the air at chest height in front of Harry while he works. He twirls around in a circle, spinning until the momentum gives out and Harry pulls him back in by a hanging rope.
“I had to throw that sweater away,” says Harry. “I scourgified it twice, but I could swear I still smelled urinal cakes, it was disgusting.”
Neville sighs again. “Nah, I’m knackered, promised Hannah we’d look at paint samples for the nursery as well. Best deal with this lot then.” The sixth years are twitching as hair grows in their noses and ears and the hair on their heads goes grey and wiry. Rigby stumbles into a limp, hand on his curving back.
He spells Draco first who immediately howls and then spells himself. Dear Merlin, it's fantastic. It’s like the tightest arse and the wettest mouth all in one, covering his whole cock, rippling up and down his shaft. He falls into Draco and they end up propped against one another, leaning on each other’s shoulders, although Harry’s got the use of his hands. He digs his fingers into Draco’s waist sharp enough to leave bruises, but at the moment he doesn’t even care. The absolute only thing that matters is that intensely pleasurable feeling surrounding his cock.
A smile which faded as he walked past Malfoy’s shop and saw the deep scowl the other man was giving the geranium he was watering.
He’d been a little nervous, standing out in the corridor, knocking so late, hoping Draco wasn’t already asleep and that he wouldn’t have to make the long walk back to his lonely tower rooms. He’d never come to Draco’s rooms without Draco before, but he’d had a long day and didn’t want to sleep alone.
Draco leans back and arches against him. “I love the mirrors. Thank you for that. But now I want to know how you’re going to take care of that,” and fuck, his nimble fingers, even tied, have managed to feel out Harry’s hard cock.
Harry scoffs and pushes Draco back. “Shut the hell up about that, Malfoy. No one gives a toss about that except you, you idiot. I’ve got your potion so you can untwist alright?”
A cold, heavy, well-deserved weight settled in Harry’s stomach. So, Lucas wasn’t the sort to leave his wife and three kids…
But Malfoy wasn’t listening, he was on his mobile again, pounding at the touch screen and likely sending another unnecessary message. Harry hopped he was telling Lucas to fuck off, but he rather doubted it.
Their cocks line up and Harry drinks in Draco’s little whimpers, forcing his head to angle back up for more kisses. Harry holds Draco in place, angling his chin just right and pushes his tongue back between his lips.
Malfoy did not seem surprised by this. “Tried to pick a place that was the furthest from Wizarding Paris without being in the suburbs?” he asked.
Harry gets up on his knees before him, naked, holding his cock in one hand while he thumbs his foreskin down.
Matthew’s hand reached across the table again, this time to flick the hair from Harry’s eyes. Harry shook his head away, but laughed, enjoying the easy exchange. It had been a very long time since he’d so enjoyed the company of another person. He was thinking it would be good to increase the intimacy in their relationship.
“Look at you pushing back on my fingers,” says Harry as he gives a vicious twist. “You’re going to feel so good on my cock, aren’t you?”
The beads have never done this before. It must be something new, a spell Percy’s withheld, or something that Harry knows about. It’s not a vibration, it's more of a wiggle, as the beads shift side to side, like… like a snake perhaps? It’s incessant, flicking against his sensitive walls, stretching him in a new and different way, rubbing against his prostate.
“So dirty,” agrees Draco with a moan that makes Harry’s cock throb. “I had to soap it up real good, my balls too, cover them in suds, massage them all over, rinse off in the warm, pulsing water.” Draco’s lips are so close Harry can feel the movement of each word on his neck, just behind his ear, feeling each warm breath. “You know what else was dirty?” he asks. Instead of answering Harry moans. “That’s right, my filthy arsehole. You came in it this morning, do you remember? Pounded me into this mattress before my alarm went off and told me to carry your cum in me all day. My pants were so sticky, you have no idea.”
“Oh right,” says Harry. He wiggles two fingers beneath the knot, plenty of room. “How does it feel?” he asks Draco.
“It’s, uh, really nice, thank you.” He’s supposed to appreciate it right? Draco would get annoyed if he is anything, but thankful, surely.
“Absolutely, under no circumstances look in the back refrigerator. There’s a poisonous snake in there and not a box of macarons.”
There is always the possibility that Draco will tire of him. Maybe next week will be the week the green invitation does not arrive. Then again, maybe by next week Harry will find himself someone new. Or maybe they’ll continue this twisted relationship they have. Maybe they have a shot at something more. Maybe.
“No,” he snapped. “It’s just the regular sort of geranium. The regular sort of geranium that has a regular sort of life, and regularly fucking stands me up without regularly fucking calling.”
Eddie shares a story about a biting teapot that makes Draco laugh and then invites him up to his rooms to finish the agenda during lunch. Draco agrees before Eddie excuses himself to prepare for his first class.
But Draco doesn’t know what’s got him so excited because the cards on his arse cheeks are going off, all of them, and it feels like being spanked in quick succession, each slap overlapping the next. He’s glad his mouth is free because he whimpers and moans through the pain and his arse clenches around the beads inside. The beads start to twist and pulse just as Harry thrusts himself back into his mouth again.
Another card goes off against his chest just as Harry’scockhead pops into the beginning of his throat. He shouts around the intrusion, then immediately gags, but Harry’s cock pops right out as he swings away. It’s back a second later, and the process is repeated, pop, snap, gag, pop, snap, gag. Harry’s hands come up around his ears and hold his head in place, keeping him from rocking and he starts thrusting in and up, lets Draco start sucking again, running his tongue frantically against the vein on the underside of his cock, filling his mouth with a steady trickle of precum.
He liked the Eiffel Tower quite a bit. It was only a twenty-minute walk from his new flat, and it served as a location marker for whenever he became lost in the city. There was a part of the park at its base that was sectioned off from the rest by winding beds of flowers. Sometimes he sat there and looked up at the great tower. Sometimes he brought a baguette to eat while he rested on the grass. Sometimes he would think of his children, or his ex-wife, or even the numerous paramours that had led to his eventual divorce. Sometimes he would think of Hogwarts and wonder if the giant squid was still alive. Mostly he would sit, munching on brie and bacon, and pretend he was happy with the choices he had made in his life.
Because Draco is a traditionalist, a matching garter belt and two black stockings follow, the bracers connecting on Harry’s thighs with small nude-colored ribbons. Draco takes extra care in adjusting each pale bow before rising gracefully to his feet and picking up the bra.
Harry wondered what made him do it even as he waved a waiter over and indicated in gestures that he wanted a table in the less popular indoor seating area. Maybe he had been thinking of Hogwarts too much lately. Maybe it was just too easy to fall back into bad habits. Mostly, he was curious.
The man’s forehead crinkled. Harry was annoyed to note that it did not make him look ugly in the least. “Anglais? Non, Français seulement.” Then he turned back around and faced the still closed toilet door.
The other man looked drawn and tired, but had smiled when he caught sight of Harry standing at the door.
Harry scrambles off the bed and uses the ropes to rock Draco forward one more time to give him another peck on the lips. “You always have the best ideas,” he says.
He had been steadily sniffling and nuzzling into Harry and his sudden words must have woken him from a near doze. Harry forced his mind to clear and hummed against Malfoy’s forehead. “You had no money, but a friend let you stay at his place for free.”
‘84 is in easy reach, but they have to work together to shift the other boxes to get to ‘82. By the time they’ve got it, the mirror has been revealed and Draco can’t help catching his reflection in it to make sure his hair is still in place. There’s some dust on his robes, he brushes off, but otherwise, he’s still looking as expected. They get to ‘82 and Neville hoists it up in his arms.
He’d had been instantly suspicious when he’d arrived after his own detention with first year Gloria Green, poor thing, to find Draco so relaxed and that Pervert Portrait hanging on the wall in the bedroom. It’s not exactly cheating is it? Getting off with a portrait. Is it even really sex? It’s not like a portrait can penetrate Draco in any way, and Harry doubts Draco gets off rubbing his cock against the frame.
On Wednesday morning Harry toyed with the card as he stared at the white ceiling above his bed. There’d been water damage at some point. The paint was cracked and blistered in places as if about to burst. He could stay at home and see if he could fix it. There was a DIY shop on the corner and he was sure the problem was only cosmetic. He could even look up household spells, but he vaguely thought that would be cheating.
The students are all popping something in their mouth now, doing a terrible job of looking casual, one grows a sudden beard, the other shoots up several inches.
“I have some ideas,” he admits. There are some rather interesting scenarios he’s been kicking about. Things he knows Draco wouldn’t be adverse to at all. He’s been dying to try those handcuffs out again, or maybe something a bit more involved.
He can feel the heat rise to his face. He hadn’t had a thought of leaving behind his sex toy with his supposed fuck buddy, but he certainly hadn’t expected to discover said sex toy displayed in the school he works in!
“Obviously not,” Harry snapped harsher than he had intended. Malfoy gave him a surprised look, but returned to his reading quickly enough.
“You do realize that every little thing that happened before, after, and during the war was not entirely your fault, right? But if you do insist on blaming yourself, I have a list of things that are, in fact, related to you.”
Harry has to squeeze his eyes shut and process that for a moment which is when he notices his glasses are missing. “I’ve lost my glasses,” he says stupidly.
“You look sad,” Kate said one day when she and Harry were sitting in the park enjoying the fruit salad she had brought for them. Harry was bouncing Kate’s little daughter Emily in his lap and thinking about when Lily was that small. He’d seen her only yesterday at Kings Cross, had held her in his arms as they waved James and Albus goodbye. He and Ginny had each taken one of Lily’s hands and walked her back to Ginny’s car and he had felt like a part of a proper family again.
Harry wasn’t sure if his type was cosmopolitan and attractive, and his first instinct was to say thanks by no thanks, but then he caught sight of a woman traipsing through the park trying to sell carnations to men to give to their sweethearts. So instead he shrugged and said, “Tell me about him.”
He doesn’t know if Potter can see him, or just knows where he is, but either way, Draco decides to give him a show. He’s still ridiculously sensitive, but he knows from experience that if he just ignores his cock for now and concentrates on the toy sliding in and out of his arse he can work himself back up. Well, he’d be forced to anyway with the way the vibrator is battering his prostate, but hopefully, he can help things along.
He’s just tipping the crushed bicorn horn into the potion when Potter grabs him by the hips again and presses his hard cock against his hole. There’s no way to tell who's moan is louder as he slowly sinks in, Draco’s rim blossoming open and sucking in every inch.
Thankfully this bar was a mixing pot of cultural backgrounds and languages. He talked to a few men who spoke various proficiencies of English and drank enough to feel tipsy before he was approached by anyone of interest. He accepted the shot he was handed before he took in what was on offer.
Paris had been beautifully decorated for Christmas, and had retained its holiday charm even several days after the holiday.
They have to part to pull their shirts off, something Draco seems to agree with judging by the “yes, yes, yes,” he pants as Harry pulls away. It’s an awkward dance, and Harry forgets to undo his cuffs at first, he’s too distracted by Draco sucking on his bottom lip in his determination to continue their kiss.
Potter’s fingers slide out of his hole and he wipes them against Draco’s thigh, the arse. He takes a long look at the mess Draco’s made of himself then smiles wickedly and says; “I really do.”
“I think I’d like to know what that’s like,” Malfoy moved his head back until he was staring at Harry. His eyes were red and swollen, Harry noted.
After the divorce he told his children that he was moving to Paris because he wanted something new. What he really wanted was to escape the embarrassment of having his separation and numerous infidelities trotted into the public domain. What he really, really wanted was to crawl into a hole until his name was forgotten entirely, but he still had three children and monthly alimony payments so he settled on Paris.
It’s impossible to maintain an air of dignity, and they both know Draco’s a total slut for it so he doesn’t try and hold back his noises anymore. The dual onslaught of Potter’s fingers rubbing his prostate and his cock slipping in and out of Potter’s throat is near painful. He can’t last, but he holds out as long as he can, to enjoy the view of Potter between his legs, glasses tangled in his hair, mouth wrapped viciously around his cock.
He gasps soundlessly and the sensation. It’s not the worst thing he’s felt, but the sharp, sparking blast is more painful than he remembers. Or maybe it’s just because it’s so unexpected. He tries to count again and makes it to eight before a card goes off between his toes.
“Coffee first,” he had said by way of an introduction, so Harry had ordered himself an espresso and a croissant. Malfoy had ordered something that came in a tall clear glass and was overflowing with whipped cream. Thankfully he had read the front page of his newspaper and ignored the looks Harry kept sending his cream covered lips.
“Shush darling, hold on, finite incantatem. There, silencing charm. Now let me hear those pretty sounds.”
Harry watched the juice trickle against the dark skin and drip into the hollow at the boy’s throat. He licked his lips at the sight and raised his glass in a toast. “Je veux t’enculer,” he said.
He’d known when it was time to leave. Had been glad when that time had come even. Had jumped at McGonagall’s offer when she’d owled, shared a memorable evening with Neville over drinks at the Leaky to learn what it might be like. He’d taken the leap and it was great. Hard, but great.
Draco hums his agreement against his ear. “I used one soapy finger, and then two. Opened up that dirty hole and cleaned out all your cum. Felt so empty without you. I thought about going to your office, grabbing my ankles and beginning you fuck me.”
His eyes are still closed so Draco’s lips when they come, are a bit of a surprise. They’ve kissed before, of course, he’s only just stolen a peck himself, but it’s rare and it’s only been in the heat of passion or when they’ve forgotten themselves. Or mostly when Harry forgets himself, as Draco never initiates it, never seems to like it when Harry kisses him, he’s always pushing him away.
Francis Bellamy is a little cheat, but he’s a Slytherin so Draco’s hardly going to take points from his own house unless he has to.
He stops for too long, Potter’s noticed and Draco’s jumping for his tweezers again as that hand squeezes his balls firmly. A whine escapes his throat. It’s not painful, but it’s not pleasant and it makes it that much harder to get his fingers working the tweezers properly.
The blankets around his waist shifted above the weight that rested between Harry’s splayed knees. He watched the mound rise and fall and pictured what was happening beneath it until he remembered through the lust filled haze that he could simply remove the blankets and see for himself.
Eventually, Potter has to stand up and they both wince as his cock slips out. Draco straightens, pulls up his briefs, lets his robes fall back down and tries to ignore the uncomfortable wetness between his cheeks and against his cock.
His newly made bracelet unwinds from his wrist and slides out from under his robes. It’s long, thin, black, made of metal, and because it’s in the stylized shape of a snake Harry can make the metal wake up and obey.
Draco pressed up against Harry’s side and sought out his hand with one of his own. Harry slid their palms together and clutched at the other man’s fingers.
Draco shoves him again. “What the hell is wrong with you? Do you have any idea how long that potion took me to make? Six bloody months!”
“Oh,” replied Draco with mock surprise, but the anger in his eyes was very real. “Did they? I’m so sorry to argue with you Mr. Auror Potter, sir, because clearly you know everything.”
“It reminds me of the Wizarding world,” Malfoy said after he’d pulled the tomato from his baguette and popped it into his mouth.
“You asked Dervish to spell a dildo for you?” How is Harry going to show his face in Hogsmeade when it comes out who Draco buys all of his dirty little trinkets for.
“Alright,” he continues. “I’m still not comfortable with this then. You’ve more than enough money, why be paid at all?”
When Draco is finished, not a single finger is left accidentally stained by the polish, but he spends several moments inspecting each to ensure that this is true. A second coat follows with a spell to ensure the paint dries as expected.
With a heavy sigh, Malfoy relented. “It means ‘I want to have sex with you,’ I promise you’re going to want to use that one at some point. Unless you’ve become celibate in your advanced age.”
Harry comes and stands at Draco’s side just in time to see Francis double cast and although the twitchy ears hex breaks up Frankie’s Protego the nonverbal leg-locker sends the boy to the floor in a heap.
He drops to his knees and licks a broad strip up Harry’s stomach, cleaning up his own cum, moaning as if it’s the most delicious thing he’s ever tasted and looks up at Harry with wide grey eyes. “Please,” he begs.
At the time Lily had given Malfoy a confused look. Later she’d pulled Harry aside and explained that she thought Malfoy was Harry’s boyfriend.
And ah, yes, fertility spell. Probably doesn’t do a pureblood family any good to find a way to get their homosexual sons off easier without involving a woman unless there’s somehow an heir out of the deal.
For some reason Malfoy looked confused. “Potter, this morning I told my landlady to suck my balls, why on earth would I be bothered by calling Daniel a cock-sucking, shop-keeping whore? It’s not like he took offense. It’s just business.”
Draco doesn’t take offence either, gives Harry a particularly smooth suck and uses his tongue to tease at the base of his shaft. He slides down once, until his nose is against Harry’s boxers, nearly to the base and then pulls off entirely with a wet smack. Harry takes the brief reprieve as a chance to let his trousers drop and push his boxers down his thighs. Draco, cock drunk and wide-mouthed, watches him, his hand parting his robes and sneaking into his trousers.
Harry takes a step back, raises Draco into the air a bit more so that Draco’s inverted face is even with his own and releases the charm.
Sometimes, they would meet for coffee before work. Not as a set thing, but more accidental run-ins before the elevators. Hermoine would be brimming with her usual excitement, ready for the challenges of the new day. Chatting away about the latest research she’d read out of Norway and how it might be implemented or the community outreach initiative she’d underwritten. Then when she’d turn and ask him about his day, he’d have nothing to say. Not one thing that filled him with that same enthusiasm, that same happiness.
One of Malfoy’s hands ended up tangled in Harry’s hair. He pulled at the hairs at the nape of Harry’s neck and tugged Harry’s lips back up to his. They kissed for a long time, and let their hands explore one another’s bodies. They both remained entirely clothed, but Harry sought out the shape of Malfoy’s lean muscles by running his hands over his shirt, as Malfoy slid his hands down his back. It was dark and slow and lazy, as if they had all the time in the world and so when eventually Malfoy pressed his palm against Harry’s clothed prick and Harry came, he gasped in surprise against Malfoy’s mouth. Malfoy followed a moment later, as he ground his erection against Harry’s hip.
It had to be done. Harry had started it around the time he’d found out Draco had never had a coca-cola before. Purebloods, it turned out, lived very sheltered lives and Draco had no idea what he’d been missing. Harry intends to show him.
Not the bit with knowing about Dark Arts, or working with the kids. That he thinks he’s pretty good at actually. It’s the other bits. The meetings, the assessments, the marking, the planning, the parent messages, all the rest. It’s only his second year though, and he’s better than he was before, so he’s improving, but it’s still hard. Not like the Auror’s at all, which while frustrating sometimes, came as naturally as flying.
“Well I’m knackered,” he told the group. “And I’ve double Defense with the fifth years in ten minutes, just going to have a quick cuppa and rest if you don’t mind.”
But Malfoy’s eyes had narrowed as he took in Harry’s tighter than normal clothes. “Where’re you coming from Potter? I thought your flat was that way?” He jerked his head in the direction that Harry had been walking to and where indeed his flat was located.
The ropes pull Draco’s hands up and over his head, just how Harry likes them. He opens his mouth to talk but Harry silences him with a silencio. “No,” he says. “You don’t need to talk. Or see for that matter, obscuro.” The blindfold wraps around Draco’s head, covering his eyes, so he can’t see it coming when Harry places a hand on his chest and shoves.
The professors evacuate as quickly as possible before the Headmistress can think of anything else to add to their already busy schedules. Harry only puts on the show of scurrying out the door but adapts a pace languid enough for Draco to catch up to and leads them towards a quiet corridor. The third floor should be nice and empty right now as the others head back towards their personal rooms or offices.
This Christmas was decidedly better than the last, Harry decided. The Weasley’s were still holding a grudge against him for cheating on Ginny, which was fair, but they had reluctantly allowed him to join in on the Christmas festivities. It had been hard to see the look on Ron’s face when he had first flooed in from his London hotel, but later when the other man passed him a whiskey with a firm nod, he knew that things were getting better. Ron might never again speak to him the way he used to, but at least he didn’t want Harry dead.
Harry doesn’t say anything, they both know the law well enough, but he does look up enough to see Draco’s eyes looking back at him. They’re shining.
Upon seeing him, the boy smiled, flashing a row of teeth that were impossibly white against dark brown skin. The boy gestured to the food and rattled off something in Spanish, but Harry understood the meaning well enough.
Draco shakes him until Harry’s teeth rattle. “You utter fuckface, think with something other than your fat cock for once will you?”
The newspaper came out again once the train began moving, as did Malfoy’s tongue-to-teeth habit. Somehow the other man managed both feats all while standing upright on the moving train, one arm slung around a strategically placed pole to help maintain balance. Harry claimed a plastic seat as quickly as possible and instantly preferred the cramped form of travel to floo.
“Right,” Harry said when Malfoy didn’t look up for several minutes. “I’ll just be going then. Happy birthday, Malfoy.”
Malfoy hadn’t noticed Harry standing awkwardly on the sidewalk outside of the café, and likely wouldn’t, given how he was practically bent over the table towards his dining mate. No, tonight there was only one man for Malfoy’s eyes and it wasn’t Harry.
Harry still has hesitations, but Draco’s done it before, knows what he’s talking about, is the fucking Potions Master for Merlin’s sake. And if he says he wants it, then who is Harry to judge?
Harry can’t help but run a hand down Draco’s pale torso, letting his fingers feel the smooth skin there, the beginning of some softness around his belly, and the muscles of his chest. Draco’s hair is such a light blond, that his chest looks smooth, but when he feels it the little hairs there tickle his fingertips. He pauses to pay a bit of attention to Draco’s nipples, running the pad of his forefinger against one then the other until both are standing out sharply against his chest.
“Oh, what do we have here?” Potter’s found his cock is what, and despite himself, Draco’s getting hard at the attention.
“Get?” Harry snaps. “You get exactly what I’m willing to give you, no more, no less.” He pushes Frederick’s grabbing hand aside and for good measure takes a step back.
“Nothing wrong with playing the field, Hermione. Just because you didn’t need to doesn’t mean the rest of us are so lucky.”
They’ve been teasing about it, and it has taken a long time, so they lost any sexual edge associated with the activity ages ago, but seeing Draco strung up with his cock dangling forward from between his bound legs, he’s suddenly remembering why they decided to do this.
Harry huffs. He still can’t get over how dirty Draco is sometimes. He doesn’t even look up from cutting his carrots, knife and fork balanced delicately in his hands. Harry sort of loves it.
He isn’t. It’s a surprise, Potter coming out and asking outright, but he had picked up on the hints. He’d also been very happy pretending he hadn’t.
Potter’s eyes linger for a moment. Draco wonders if he’s going to press the issue. “Okay then. Christmas.”
“I think I want to try and pursue something—someone new. Have a proper go at a real relationship. An honest one.”
Draco bites him hard, but before Harry can reclaim his sore thumb, he’s soothing it with his tongue. Harry was right, he’s got Draco alone in an unused corridor, it’s only been a few minutes, and already Draco is ready for it. He really is such a cock slut. Harry really does love it.
“Do you see how much I like you now? How much I want you?” Potter says finally. He’s whispering, perhaps afraid to disturb Draco’s thoughts.
Harry did know. Draco had complained about it all last year. That, and how fiendishly difficult it was to make and how annoyed he was that it was being put on the N.E.W.T. curriculum for this year.
“Such as?” asked Harry, taking the bait, even though he knew it was a diversionary tactic. However, he had no desire to continue exploring their previous topic, at least not without further contemplation. Perhaps with something stronger to drink than rapidly cooling coffee.
“Oh-key, Phot-her,” Draco managed from around the gooey chocolate. He hadn’t even tried to finish his bite before answering, or covered his mouth.
No matter how annoyed, tired, sensitive, and fucked out he is, Draco will never get over the feeling of a cock cumming buried in his hole. Potter’s cock is particularly fantastic, he takes a long time to cum, cock twitching and jumping with every pulse. They both moan through the sensation then still, catching their breath until Potter starts to soften.
He didn’t want to explain all of this to Kate. They were passing friends only, who met in the park on sunny days and talked about superficial things like their favorite wine, and what shoes Kate wanted to buy next time she went shopping.
“You do realize that it’s illegal to read another wizard’s mail?” he says as he falls into an armchair. There’s no point in removing the mail in question from Hermione’s hands; she’d only accuse him of hiding something then.
He has the audacity to giggle. “Shh, there we go, that’s better, isn’t it? I’m so proud of you darling, you did so well.” Draco’s so wrung out, so over-sensitive that he relaxes into Potter’s gentle head petting and soothing words.
Draco smirks and tucks his fingers into the waistband of Harry’s trousers. “Want me pliant and happy, on my knees for you, desperate for a touch, a taste?” His fingers tease through the fabric of his shirt until they come in contact with bare skin. The fingertips just barely tracing the thin skin over his hip bones on either side.
“It’s your own fault,” Potter says as he fingers Draco open. “When I told you to pay me back with something good I was just thinking of tying your hands to the headboard, but then you had to go and show off your naughty toy drawer.”
And Harry does reach down to pet Draco's furled hole. “Let’s see,” he says concentrating. “There was cleaning, then lubrication, then stretching,” and with each word he nonverbally and wandlessly casts the spells that Draco had cast on him. It’s the stretching that’s the worst, going from relaxed to suddenly full, then empty and gaping in the span of a second is enough to make your heart skip a beat. Draco’s mouth falls open and his balls draw up tight at the sensation, the muscles on his abdomen go rigid.
Harry nodded seriously. “It’ll be a year since the divorce, and it’s not like Ginny and I were serious about each other for some time before that.”
“His nonverbal spells are impressive,” says Draco. “I wanted to see what he could do. Might be ready for some more specialised training, don’t you think?”
The last knot is tricky as he’s nearly run out of rope, but he’s getting the hang of it now and it catches in the end. He tests it with his fingers and takes a step back.
“Well, if there are no complaints there I think we can leave it at that,” says McGonagall. “Our Thursday morning meeting will also be cancelled this week as we complete the induction activities for the first years— Neville don’t forget you’ve volunteered for the safety drill of what to do if you encounter the giant squid— but I expect Heads of Houses to meet with me on Friday morning to discuss any potential safeguarding issues with your new charges. That will be all then, enjoy your evening.”
Overall, Harry enjoyed himself. Even if the other adults were not keen on making conversation, he still had the company of his children and all of his nieces and nephews. Even Teddy and Andromeda had stopped by to spend time with him. And as he had come bearing Parisian presents, he had been as popular as Father Christmas for a few minutes.
They are in the middle of the Great Hall at Hogwarts and regularly attend professional development sessions about the dangers of that exact subject. Harry reminds him; “Aren’t you the Potions Master? What am I supposed to say here?”
Too many years had passed since Harry had had a risk-free argument. The past ten years had been filled with plenty of arguments with his children and his wife, but very little banter. With his wife he’d rarely had the option to defend his own cause and had merely shut up when he’d been told to. With the children, whenever he felt he wasn’t on solid ground anymore he simply told them a white lie, or gave them a daddy-knows-best kind of line. During desperate times he was even known to provide a distraction in the guise of a sweetie or a shiny object.
“Hey, Hermione, didn’t know you were stopping by,” he says as he makes his way to the kitchen to deposit his bundle.
“He’s not really a toy though is he?” says Harry. Draco’s fingers running through his hair aren’t doing the usual job of relaxing him. He feels all wound up, coiled like a spring. He’d been hoping to get his energy out with Draco in bed, but it seems like Draco’s already had his fun without him.
“Right that,” said Harry. He was starting to feel vaguely uncomfortable, and guilty for some reason.
This turned out to be the extent of their communication skills as Sergio only spoke a few bits and pieces of English, and Harry only knew about the same in either Spanish or French. But still, Harry left Sergio’s little flat with a bounce in his step and a smile on his face.
Harry blinks, realises that he’s laying on the floor of a pub toilet, just shy of a puddle of his cum and groans.
They stare at one another for a moment and Draco doesn’t know what to do. He doesn’t know if they are going to fight or fuck.
There was the sharp feeling of panic, an echo from his days before the divorce when he’d used an alias, glamour, or polyjuice. But this boy was a Muggle, and even if he weren’t, no one cared about Harry Potter in Paris.
“Well, what do you want then?” Harry snapped. He had a sudden and desperate urge to retreat back into his lonely solidarity. What did he care about Draco Malfoy anyway?
Draco had started on his front first, to let Harry tie his arms behind his back. It’s not a very tight tie, his arms are hanging loosely now, behind him, wrapped in intricate knots from his wrists nearly to his shoulders. He’d also managed a criss-cross sort of pattern across the top of his chest and down one leg. He had intended to do both legs, as well as his stomach, but perhaps another day.
“He let me have the flat and gave me money for groceries and things so long as I entertained him whenever he decided to show up,” Malfoy was still whispering.
“Well I happen to think you’d be quite sexy in an apron, Ron,” says Hermoine, batting her eyelashes in exaggeration.
The children came to visit two weeks later. He had them for a glorious six weeks before they’d be returned to their mother. James was already at Hogwarts, but September would be Albus’ first year and his youngest son could hardly stop talking about what things would be like.
“Christmas,” repeats Potter. He doesn’t look quite as happy, but there’s still a pleased puppy dog look on his face. “You’re not still unsure?”
Potter sighs and fiddles absently with an uneaten piece of toast. They don't have time to sit here any longer, they both have classes to teach, but Draco doesn’t want to leave on a sour note.
“Take it, Draco. Love it when you gag on my cock,” says Harry and he’s close and breathless. “Love what a cock slut you are, always so desperate to get your lips wrapped around me. Going to fill you up with my cum, spray your dirty little face.”
It’s one of the first times Draco’s been grateful to be left-handed, despite all the tutors he’s endured who’ve tried to force him to write with his right. Thankfully it never took, so it's as easy as anything to reach out with his free hand to find Harry’s hand. He gives the fingers a gentle squeeze, turns his hand over, and presses their palms together.
“Well it’s been nice talking to you, Professor Malfoy, have a good day!” There’s no shame in running, he decides. For now at least.
Afterwards, Draco sets aside his wand, and gently arranges Harry’s hands in his lap before sliding down to the floor and kneeling at Harry’s feet. The slippers are removed and displaced with care, and Harry’s feet exchange their perch of soft cushioning for firm thighs.
The squid isn’t a great listener, but he is a good distraction. Harry has to keep moving out of reach of the tentacles searching for his fish bucket. He has to duck and weave, remaining close enough to the water’s edge to toss the dead fish in, but far enough away to avoid capture. He tries to make a game of it, seeing how high and how far he can get those tentacles to stretch and it takes some of the sting out of the day.
There had been a day or two of discomfort when they’d first arrived by portkey. He hadn’t seen them since that last strained Christmas, where there had been an uncomfortable level of honesty about Harry’s actions amongst the Potter and Weasley families. He was sure little Lily didn’t fully understand what being gay entailed, but even she hadn’t been spared the information that her father had chosen to cheat on his long-time wife with an embarrassing number of men.
And it’s a shame he can’t hear Draco agree with him, can’t hear those little moans he enjoys so much, so he cancels the silencing and blindfolding spell.
When he looked over it was to find Malfoy toying absently with his fork, pushing it against the rocket that had garnished his meal.
“That’s personal, Potter,” snaps Draco, but it’s half-hearted considering he’s leaning into Harry’s space, tipping his head up for the potion.
Potter points and Eddie’s eyes follow until they are both meeting Draco’s eyes and he feels his cock stiffening up again. Eddie can’t see him, but Draco’s not sure what he can hear. Draco can hear the wet, sucking sound of the vibrator sliding in and out of his hole, but can they? He’s too afraid to let loose all the little sounds he wants to so to hold them back he bites into the gag which now makes a lot more sense. He’d thought Potter had just wanted to shut him up for once.
Draco whimpers, and tries to clear his head. He’s let his head fall onto his arms and it’s hard to straighten up again with Potter’s hand holding him so firmly in such a delicate place. His ingredients are all lined up, just how he left them, but the haze of arousal is making it hard to think.
There’s a snort and then Draco’s swung his thigh over both of Harry’s, trapping him to the bed. “I’ll have my goblin transfer the money to that accountant of yours, but so long as I’m paying extra…”
“Git,” said Harry, because he couldn’t think of an appropriate insult when he was suitably impressed. “Is there much need for a degree in floristing?”
And that’s when Draco recovers enough to realize that although Potter is looking right at him, Eddie is looking somewhere just over his shoulder. Like he can’t see him at all.
Yes, he wants to say, do it, but he can’t so he hums and sucks and licks instead and the second Harry tenses and he feels his cock tighten in his mouth, the beads are pulled viciously from his arse, rubbing relentlessly against his prostate. He screams as he cums and as he does Harry pulls him forward by the ropes until Harry’s cockhead is pushed directly down the back of his throat. He gags and tries to swallow around Harry’s cock as his twitches and spurts into the empty air. His whole body is jumping and shaking and another card snaps against his thigh. He can’t bloody breath with Harry’s cock in his throat so he gags hard again and the movement makes his cock jump and spurt again.
It doesn’t take long for Draco to reach his crest like this, Potter’s cock doing its job filling him up and nudging against his prostate over and over until finally, his arse clenches around Potter and his cock spurts into the empty air.
A week later when Harry was halfway through painting his bedroom a deep royal blue a thought occurred to him. A few actual living potted plants on the balcony and maybe a vase or two of colorful flowers in the kitchen would really do wonders to brighten up the place. Then realizing his train of thought, Harry scowled at the half finished wall angrily and painted a large, bold, ‘NO’ in the remaining white space. He stared at it for a while, until he felt that the intention had sunk in and then painted over it.
Malfoy was frowning at him when he opened the door. “Potter,” he said before shoving his way inside.
Slowly, like it’s the hardest thing he’s ever done, Draco blinks. Harry watches the lids slide shut and hold for a moment before they open again revealing Draco’s steel-grey eyes. “That’s not possible,” he says.
Draco takes his hand with a knowing smirk, eyes briefly dipping down and then back up again. “Well met, Professor Potter.”
It’s Draco’s favourite vibrator. It’s long and slim, fantastic for filling him up just so and torturing his prostate. It’s the toy that taught him how to cum hands-free and turned him into such a desperate bottom. It makes him crazy.
Sergio pouted perfectly. His lips were plump and swollen looking, and they were pressed out and together. His eyes were closed, adding to the look of pure concentration on his young face.
On their date the conversation flowed easily and they shared a bottle of wine and several glasses of cognac before calling it a night. They had agreed early on that setups were a bit awkward, and had decided to take things slow and that there would be no hard feelings if one of them didn’t want a second date. It turned out that both of them did indeed want to see the other again. They left with loose plans to meet in a few days and a very continental brush of lips against cheeks.
It felt like a holiday and for the first time since he’d arrived Harry felt good with how his life had turned out. His children still loved him, and he was happy.
He swirls his robes around him and stalks off. He only gets as far as the stairs before Potter grabs him by the arm.
Harry was sitting across the room staring at his hands when Malfoy woke up. The other man’s eyes were open, staring questioningly at him, as if surprised to find him sitting so far away. Harry stared back.
Like all French café’s, the tables faced outward towards the street, so that Harry and Malfoy sat side by side, instead of across from one another. It gave them a good view of the foot traffic, and allowed for excellent people watching while they talked.
Draco barely hears the words, he’s whining, clenching around Potter’s fingers as his cum spurts out, arching into the empty air. Draco loses track of how many times he pulses, cock wet and twitching. All at once, it’s too much. Potter’s fingertips teasing his prostate become painful, his rim too stretched around them. He’s sticky, he’s uncomfortable, and yes, he’s splattered cum down the front of his formal school robes and the welcome feast is starting any minute now.
The Hogwarts Express rolls in with the usual cacophony. Owls, cats, rats, and of course, young witches and wizards of all ages spill out onto the platform. Hagrid has time to turn and say; “Here we go, gents,” before he’s striding into the thick of it bellowing for the first years.
It was after midnight before Malfoy acknowledged his presence and even then he had only merited a brief nod as Malfoy was pulled out the door by his ‘no good,’ married, sometimes-boyfriend, Lucas. Harry was sure that Malfoy wouldn’t be returning to make further conversation this time. So he thanked a glassy eyed Lauren for the invitation, left his half-empty drink in the kitchen, and went home promising himself to stay as far away from Malfoy as possible.
Neville sighs the sigh of the perpetually exhausted, a common sound in the staff room, and turns. “I don’t know why they bother to try it on,” he complains. “The student should know by now that the pub’s going to be crawling with teachers soon.”
Draco gives him two fingers, but he does close his eyes, and cover them with his hands. Harry looks around the neat office, far more organised than his own. There’s a large snake plant in the corner, Harry slips the vial in between the long leaves, making sure it’s tucked out of sight, but easy enough to retrieve when the time comes.
Malfoy’s eyes sharpened. He’d never told Harry that, and Harry had never let on that he knew. Apparently Malfoy liked to pretend that Lucas was solely devoted to him, despite the fact that Harry had only ever seen them together a handful of times, (thankfully).
Harry doesn’t look over as he sits down, but his free hand is resting on his knee, under the table, out of sight of their colleagues. Draco shifts so they are sitting shoulder to shoulder and puts his things on the table to start taking his own notes.
Potter just shrugs. “Untwist, Draco. I meet the students in the classroom, it’s more practical. Hardly anyone comes up here except staff. And house-elves.”
Draco decides to ignore him and takes himself in hand. He’d already worked himself up before arriving so it doesn’t take long to stroke his cock into hardness again. Potter, he notices, has the time to watch and doesn’t try to return to his work.
But no, Eddie’s finally fucking leaving and Potter is putting a locking spell on the door and turning to face him with a smirk.
If Harry had ever given any thought to actually having lunch with Draco Malfoy he wouldn’t have thought they had anything to talk about. However, the conversation flowed with surprising ease as they ate their croque madame. It was interspersed with a heavy dose of bickering, eye rolling and occasional French cursing, but it still flowed.
The look on Malfoy’s face was a familiar one to Harry. It was the look that Malfoy had regularly given Harry when they were at Hogwarts. Harry rather thought it meant something like, ‘What business do you have being in my esteemed company you miserable piece of filth.’ Instead Malfoy said, “Does it sound like I’m talking about a fucking geranium, Potter?”
It’s no hardship to close his eyes and submit to Draco’s ministrations, though it is difficult to remain still while doing so. For this part, at least, Draco prefers him to remain as motionless and silent as possible, and Harry is very good at his job.
As usual, Draco ignores Harry’s obvious erection, even when it is practically twitching against his arm. Instead Draco massages the lotion into Harry’s stomach, then chest, then up and over his shoulders where he knocks the rest of the robe from Harry’s upper body. Once his arms are carefully removed, the remaining material falls around the circular stool, still captured under Harry’s arse and thighs, but no longer covering his body.
Draco eyes him up for a moment but is already turning back to Percy. “Speak for yourself, Percy’s never steered me wrong before. He likes my cock too much to break it, don’t you, you old pervert?”
The git actually looked like he was enjoying himself. Harry narrowed his eyes. “My lot knew the rules just fine, it was your lot that was always breaking them.”
“Potter,” he wines. “Hurry up, I've got work to finish.” Why does this man always have the worst timing?
Which of course leads to the first time, then the second, then the third. And wow, they have fucked a lot.
Draco watches him go and tries to make sense of what just happened. It’s all a mess in his head and he doesn’t know what he wants, but he has the feeling he’s just royally fucked up.
“School,” said Malfoy finally. Once the woman had bounced her gaze from Harry to Malfoy and back several times, waiting for an answer. “Boarding school, before L’Universite.”
Draco pulls his cock roughly, it’s still sticky with pre-cum and lube from earlier and it feels hot and heavy in his hand. Potter licks his lips and runs a hand down Draco’s thigh from the knee over his shoulder straight down to his open hole. They both moan when Potter’s fingers find the dripping mess there.
“If you touch anything then I’ll be forced to cut off your hands and feed them to my pet crocodile.”
It’s fucking fantastic. Harry makes him wait, holds his cock in his hand and tugs Draco forward, traces his lips with the tip. Draco breath pants out between parted lips as Harry stroke his foreskin down.
The thought doesn’t go any further, the squid slaps a tentacle against the bucket, knocking three fish into the dusty shore and Harry has to jump to avoid the other two tentacles that come in for the feast. The fish are quickly pulled back into the lake and in no time the tentacles are right back in line for more.
Draco gives his nearest nipple a teasing suck, then tucks himself into the crook of Harry’s arm. “Don’t be ridiculous. I watched him spell the gloves to the necklace, then I copied the spell on a dildo. How was the connection? I would have tested them myself, but I couldn’t figure out how since it would have been a closed feedback loop.”
Malfoy was opening the cabinets, apparently to locate a cup and saucer. He’d already turned the kettle on. “No espresso pot?” he asked.
It was hard to look the other man in the eye after that. He wished he had the strength to stop coming by Malfoy’s shop at all.
“You could have just said you wanted to fuck me,” he says, making conversation while he frots absently against Draco. “You know I’d be up for it anytime you ask. I’m quite looking forward to it now actually, just look at this pretty thing.” And pretty it is, Harry loves Draco’s cock, loves how it sticks out from his body all pale and thin, loves it from his swollen tip to his round tight balls. “I’m quite looking forward to having it in me. Don’t worry though. I’m okay with doing all the work. I think you’re quite busy aren’t you?”
For a brief moment he thought Malfoy was leaning into him, perhaps giving in, but then Harry felt the sharp point of a wand pressed against his chest.
The boy, and yes he was definitely young enough to still be called a boy by Harry, bit his lip and fluttered his lashes. It looked like the sort of move that had been practiced in front of a mirror.
Draco nods, as Harry’s cum slides down one cheek and holds Harry’s cock back to his lips. He is painstakingly gentle, closing his mouth reverently over Harry’s messy cockhead, cradling his softening shaft in his palms. He doesn’t suck, but uses his soft tongue, cleaning up all of Harry's cum.
He stops bouncing and grinds himself down on Draco’s cock, letting it pulse in his hole, letting those vibrations tingle faintly against his sensitive skin. He pulls up, luxuriating in the long slide, Draco’s cockhead stroking him from within until it nearly pops out of his hole, then the long slide back in as Harry sits back down. “Going to cum all over that pretty face,” he says as he jerks off. He’s so close, just needs a little more.
Neville shakes his head and starts lifting boxes. “McGonagall took the files. She said she’d meet us in the staff room.”
Draco makes an exuberant slash across Harry’s diary. It’s rather unnecessarily dramatic in Harry’s opinion, but he’s not going to argue.
He was so very, very tired and he just wanted this all to end so he could go back to being happy again. But he shushed Draco’s quiet tears and ran his hand up and down the other man’s back the way he used to when his children had a nightmare.
Draco is boneless in his arms, but his fingers are working at Harry’s tie, then his shirt buttons, then his own until they are pressed bare chest to bare chest. It’s another new sensation and they both moan at the contact. Their trysts normally only involve divesting themselves of the necessary items, and although Harry has seen all of Draco’s skin in bits and pieces he’s suddenly desperate to see it all at once.
Resting his weight on his feet Draco lifts himself and angles his hole over Potter’s cock. It’s an awkward angle, but he’s slippery and open so it’s easy enough to find Potter’s cockhead by catching it on his rim. He sighs as he welcomes it into his body, loving that first initial, unyielding stretch. He can’t get as deep as he’d like, but he can angle his hips so Potter’s cock is just hitting his prostate. He needs the extra stimulation because he’s not going to be able to get his hand on himself in this position. He needs both hands gripping the desk behind him for leverage.
They are sitting across from one another at La Côte d’Or. Draco has changed his plain trousers and robes for dark slacks and a fine blue shirt. The colors match Harry’s own outfit, a high boat-neck navy frock accented by pearl earrings and barrettes. There’s also a diamond engagement ring on Harry’s fourth finger and a silver clutch resting on the table. Harry’s hair has been pulled and pinned back in such a way as to make it appear that there is much more of it than there is beneath the artificial bun at the back of his head.
Draco tries to kick him, the second he feels the vibrations, but Harry’s not having it, and just gives his thigh a playful slap. It’s the same vibrator he used to torture Draco beneath his invisibility cloak and he hasn’t been as much of a fan since then. Harry slides it in deep, feeling the tumble of intense vibration on his fingertips. “There we go,” he says. “I know how desperate your hole gets, darling. Wanted to make sure it’s well-fed while we’re busy. Let me just spell it in place, I wouldn't want it to fall out now.”
“You actually spoke French,” said Malfoy incredulously after carefully watching Harry converse with the till attendant who rang him up and helped him bag his purchases. Harry just shrugged. He was meeting with Marie twice a week now, and both her English and his French was improving little by little.
When he turns around, Draco is still standing, slim hands covering his eyes and half his face, and yes, his lips are moving in little movements as he counts. Harry’s chest clenches in affection. He makes him wait for a few more hippogryphs, just so he can watch, before clearing his throat.
“I care,” he explains. “Of course I do, but not enough not to want this. Not enough to stop wanting you.”
“And I assume you took payment for those flowers?” Another nod. “But decided to only tell me about them instead of actually bringing them to me?”
Malfoy gave him a look that made him think he had not been so successful in his efforts, and which somehow also said the familiar, ‘Don’t be stupid, Potter.’
“Because I will answer your questions and you will answer mine.” Malfoy paused; fingers poised to hand Harry a scrap of paper without actually passing it over. “And,” he added. “You look a bit lost.” Then with a toss of his hand and a mocking smirk Malfoy left the table and sauntered out onto the busy Parisian street.
“Yeah, Hermoine helped me figure out the spells to make it work at Hogwarts. It’s very finicky so we can’t get too close, but I thought you might want to see it.”
The summer went by faster than Harry wanted it too. Every day he was aware he was losing time with his children. They filled July with jaunts to the French countryside, interspersed with lazing around Harry’s flat or Malfoy’s flower shop. Lily’s collection of bouquets grew until Harry’s entire flat began to resemble a florist shop itself, and James and Albus were routinely roped into acting Junior Associates, as Malfoy liked to call them. Harry rather felt that Malfoy was just taking advantage of available child labor, but Malfoy steadfastedly assured him he was teaching valuable business skills.
“An escort,” affirmed Harry. “Not a prostitute. I agreed to escort you to your work function--not to allow you to paw at me like I’m some kind of whore.”
Draco nods then uses his wand like a normal wizard to levitate the first box into place. His spell fails when he jumps, looking over his shoulder, but the only thing he sees across the room is Neville and McGonagall opening up the box and rifling through the papers there. He turns back, and sure enough, through the remaining boxes, in the mirror, is Harry.
There’s a little smile on Neville’s lips and he’s gone all soft. “Not unless your greatest desire is to meet my baby daughter.” And that’s right, Neville’s wife Hannah just found out in September that she’s pregnant. “I see her and Hannah and me in our cottage in Hogsmeade.” He glances sidelong at Draco. “Feel like sharing yours?”
Harry hummed in response. It wasn’t the first time Malfoy had said as much. It had been eight months since he’d last slept with a man, and over a year since he’d last slept with Ginny so Malfoy was not wrong.
After he fixed it, he could paint the ceiling blue. Harry seemed to recall Ginny saying something about blue being a soothing color for a bedroom. It was supposed to help you fall asleep. He tried to imagine the whole bedroom blue, and then wondered what shade would induce the most relaxation. But then he glanced down at the card in his hands and his distraction efforts failed.
“Finite incantatem,” Harry whispers against his chest, too tired to do so nonverbally. One of Draco’s arms comes up around his shoulders and the other, predictably, goes to play with his hair. Harry’s still not a fan of excessive touch, and it's a challenge considering Draco is part octopus, but he’s beginning to enjoy the gentle tug and scrape of fingers through his curls. So long as it’s Draco.
Malfoy didn’t acknowledge Harry’s newly aware state and simply continued his exploration. The fingertips traced along his jaw, then back up to his cheekbones, and against his forehead. Harry closed his eyes as the fingers trailed down his face and opened both again when the fingers stopped against his lips.
It wasn’t something Harry needed to think about it at all, but he felt he owed Matthew enough to try. “I don’t think I ever asked if you liked Lucas better than me, did I?”
The chair scrapes loudly against the stone as he hurriedly stands. There’s a group of fifth years at the Gryffindor table who look ready to leap to his defence. The Gryffindors usually seem to like their prickly Potions Master, but even Harry can tell that the fake smile and murderous look in Draco’s eyes are coming off a bit unhinged.
And judging from the way Draco’s eyes have been following him, he thinks a repeat performance might be expected after class. He seems particularly drawn to eyeing up his holster. It’s just Auror standard issue and he always wears to Dueling Club for ease and manoeuvrability, but maybe Draco’s not seen it before. It's a brown dragonhide and goes around each of Harry’s shoulders and his back. It seems to be doing things for Draco.
“Next time,” smiles Aurora. “I have night classes with the third years this evening. We’re working on our star charts.”
The front of his robes are soaked through and the touch of the rough fabric is suddenly too much, but Draco gives himself one last squeeze as the last drops spill out.
“Not necessarily,” continues Percy. “That’s what the rope across the chest is for, weight distribution. It looks more uncomfortable than it is.”
“You don’t want to commemorate the moment, Potter? I’m offended,” said Malfoy as he looked over the menu.
He’s really anything but, his legs are stiff, his hole is full and aching now the fucking is over, and his face is pressed uncomfortably against the table. Oh, and another set of his robes are ruined. It is sort of nice having Potter’s weight pressed against the length of his body though so he doesn’t say anything.
Harry doesn’t think he will. He has the least teaching experience of any of the professors at Hogwarts, but he does have six years in the Auror Corp under his belt and he knows himself well enough that he’ll always cram at the last minute over-preparing in advance. He’s even worse without Hermoine’s influence, but he does always get it done in the end. Even if he has to stay up to 2 am because someone’s left him stiff and frustrated.
“Took you long enough,” said Malfoy when he opened the door, and then he pulled Harry forward by his shirtfront and proceeded to devour his mouth.
And then before he knew it, it was summer, and it had been months since he’d seen Malfoy or his kids, so when Lily suggested a walk down to Malfoy’s shop he’d said yes.
Marie smiles. “Just so long as you understand that I expect you to be thinking of me when I ride you into the mattress tonight.”
It’s hard not to let that hurt his feelings, but Harry is nothing if not determined. “We could though. Have a drink, in public, at a bar. I’d like to at least.”
It was a ridiculous place, Harry had concluded by the time their food and drink had arrived, but he loved it instantly.
Malfoy was slumped dramatically across the glass countertop at the till. “You know things are bad when Harry bloody Potter is getting more action than you are,” he mumbled into his arms loud enough for the words to have been intended to be overheard.
Draco huffs again, but maybe he’s also blowing the hair out of his eyes because he’s hung his head back and is looking at himself in the mirror from an upside-down angle now. “You and that bloody list,” he says.
Then there are the newer memories, the ones that started last year when Potter joined the faculty Draco’s been a part of for the past five years. The first staff meeting when they’d stared at one another curiously, then all the petty little arguments they’d had; over the tea biscuits, the patrol schedule, the best seat at the Head Table. There are other memories too. Ones that surprise him, ones interspersed with the ones he remembers. Images of Draco resting his head in his hand, idly stroking his lip as he reads over the agenda, Draco laughing with a group of sixth years in the corridor, Draco running his hands through his hair to remove the excess water after being caught out in a storm. The emotions associated are complicated and a surprising mirror of his own; attraction, affection, lust, obsession.
And Harry was left with an annoying buzzing in his head, a mostly eaten chocolate torte (that was admittedly excellent), and the bill.
The black ropes stand out sharply against Draco’s white skin, and already Harry wonders what another colour might look like. Purple maybe, or green, he’d probably prefer green. He looks gorgeous like this, stretched out, on display, balanced nearly perfectly still. The longer he looks, the harder he gets, especially when he thinks of other ways he could tie Draco up. Ways that would open him up, like if his knees were splayed, or bound to his chest.
Harry fumbled for his wand and eliminated the mess even as he pressed closed mouthed kisses against Malfoy’s lips. Then he clutched the other man against his chest tightly and drifted back into sleep.
Every minute or two another card snaps, leaping off his skin with a sharp slap if balanced too precariously, or rattling harshly against his skin if tucked firmly against a rope. Each time one goes off he can hear Percy groan.
Somehow Harry did not manage to suppress his smile. He did try, really. “I don’t think that’s what that says at all, Malfoy.”
“I don’t think I should see Lucas anymore, either,” but from the way he said it, Harry knew that even if he meant the words that didn’t mean he was going to stop anytime soon.
Draco huffs and snaps; “Glad you’re so relaxed,” but his heart isn’t in, Harry can tell. “Shall I expect to continue to be your test dummy then?”
Harry lets him down gently, this time tipping him onto his own two feet. He detaches the rope connecting his arms to his ankles and helps rub the feeling back into his tense shoulders. “That was beautiful, thank you,” he says, kissing the back of his neck.
It’s a pretty normal pub night. Hermoine and Ron don’t have many chances to get away now that little Rosie is old enough to show off some of that Weasley mischief. It’s nice to have these chances to catch up, even though they don’t talk about much of anything at all. Harry shares stories about the students, but doesn’t feel like he has much else to talk about. There’s only one big thing going on in his life he wants to share, and he can’t. Or, he could, but until Draco says it’s okay he’s not going to risk ruining it.
It’s never really bothered him though. Chaos has always surrounded Harry and Dueling Club is a special kind of chaos that will always remind him of DA. Usually Neville assists, but the mandrakes are at a critical point in their development so Harry had had to bribe Draco with a blowjob to step in on his night off. It hadn’t been a bad price to pay at all.
Harry nodded in understanding and they shared a brief moment of commiseration for the standards of their education.
“Ron!” Hermione shoots, but then with another shake of her head she apparently gives up on the whole conversation and leaves the dining room.
There are a number of spells and potions to render temporary breasts. God knows Harry had seen them before, and they are not his favorite. Looking like a girl is one thing, in his preference, but he wants to know he’s still a man underneath the lotion and lace. Thankfully, Draco must feel at least partially the same way, since he never even attempts to grant Harry cleavage. Instead the bra is wireless and flat, and covers Harry’s chest without adding anything to it. The lace is rough against Harry’s nipples, but he drastically prefers that feeling to soft padding. Later, when they are out, he’ll feel the rough glide against his nipples with every step.
His arms and legs are like jelly. Holding that position probably wasn’t the best of ideas, his thighs will ache tomorrow, but judging from Potter’s glassy-eyed look it was worth it. Draco rubs a strip of his cum from his stomach and brings it to Potter’s face, presses it against the skin right where his mouth should be. “Want a taste?” he asks and smirks at the challenge in Potter’s eyes.
He’d held the image in his head and paced three times in front of the door while Draco had stood off to the side with Percy’s portrait in his arms. Once they stepped inside, even Draco had broken down and said the words; “Okay, you were right.”
Harry smiles and laughs as he retrieves his wand from Draco to show the other student’s that there are no hard feelings. Someone has to set a good example for the children after all.
The tongue retreated into his mouth and Malfoy smiled widely. “I’m celebrating my birthday with Lucas, he’s taking me to Giverny for the weekend.”
Draco does a little wiggle. “Feels fine to me,” he says. “Takes a bloody long time though, doesn’t it?”
Harry tips his head back and clutches at Draco’s hips. Honestly, he’d be happy to just continue talking about the fantasy of it, maybe let Draco rock that stiffening cock against his while he whispers filth into his ear.
The spells had worn off minutes after Draco left and he’d been left gasping with the taste of Draco’s cum on his lips and his cock soft and sticky on his thigh. It had not been pleasant and as much as he’d wanted to track down the little shit, he still needed to finish his work.
“Can’t you at least teach me something useful?” asked Harry, deciding to ignore the ridiculousness of the situation where Draco Malfoy taught him French curse words over coffee.
A laugh bubbles up from Harry’s newly freed chest. “You know all the really dirty and kinky stuff costs extra.”
Harry smirks. “Oh yes, it certainly is, and you’re going to have to make it very good too if you want that potion back. You do want your potion back don’t you, Malfoy?” Casually, he leans back against the wall and starts rubbing his bulge through his trousers, Draco can’t keep his eyes off the motion and he licks his lips again, the little tart.
Slowly the hand on Harry’s head slides down the side of his neck, over his shoulder, down his arm, until familiar fingers are sliding through his own and lifting his hand up for closer inspection. He knows Draco’s examining his nails to see if they need further cutting, but this time, at least, they seem to pass inspection as Draco next reaches for the buffer. Harry’s hands rest in Draco’s as each of his fingernails is brought to a fine shine.
Harry sort of wonders if Fe might be up for it, he knows that Charlie’s a pretty kinky bastard himself.
Harry sits back on his heels and strokes himself as he watches Draco dance in his bondage. Three cards go off in quick succession, one on the back of his neck which goes flying, one against the sensitive skin of his wrist, and another that's tucked into his hip. Each time he jumps, he swings a bit. The cards on his arse, fall from their little house and spread across his cheeks. He whimpers because now they’re all in contact with his skin so he’ll feel each one. They’ll set each other off, he knows. If any cards are nearby when one goes it will set off a chain reaction.
She laughed. “Not for me, for you. I met him through my book club. An English book club, obviously. He’s American too, from New York City, very cosmopolitan, very attractive.”
Harry’s smile faded and he stared back at Malfoy, weighing the moment. Malfoy did not wave, or acknowledge Harry in any way, but simply looked away, threw some notes onto the table and left.
“Tell me about your shower,” says Harry, letting his eyes close. With Draco’s hand steadily teasing his shaft it’s easy to relax and imagine he’s there, with Draco, standing in his steamy green-tiled shower, watching him soap up with that poncy gel of his.
Draco meets Harry’s eyes and they both giggle. “Now get me down from here so we can shove him in the closet and have a shower.”
They’re both gasping by the time Draco pulls out of Potter’s head. Considering the last images, they’re both hard too.
Malfoy was shaking his head. “I didn’t think you’d be any more interested in going to the Wizarding quarter any more than I would be. Not if you’re hanging around in the 14th Adrionessment.”
Harry shrugged and shifted uncomfortably. He was still standing, hoping to only stay long enough to somehow make Malfoy feel better before he could make his escape. He was in desperate need of a real shower and he didn’t much like the idea of being around Malfoy after leaving another man’s company.
“You like that, don’t you?” answers Harry. He knows his voice is far too deep to ever be mistaken for a woman’s. Draco knows it too, and Harry gets a thrill at the response he invokes by speaking out.
“I will murder you,” says Draco. “No one would even be surprised, would they? Everyone knows it’s only a matter of time before one of us kills the other, don’t they? Death by Death Eater?”
“I just want you happy,” Ron tries desperately. “Can you tell me that, can you tell me you’re happy?”
He hums and considers. “Yes, I’ve been thinking the same thing, but his basics are sloppy, he’s got to get his footwork practised out or—”
“He is rather, isn’t he?” said Harry, enjoying both the fact that he was now involved in the conversation, and turning one of Malfoy’s own friends against him.
In all the time he’d spent with Malfoy over the past few months, he’d never once seen the other man’s wand. He hadn’t been sure Malfoy even had one anymore. Harry sucked in his breath through his teeth and nodded in understanding.
Draco remains frozen, merely nodding and offering brief smiles to the returning students as they wave hello. Jonathan Rigby slaps him on the back and nearly sends him flying. That summer growth spurt has made him taller than Draco, but Draco doesn’t chastise him, merely holds up a hand and accepts the poor sixth year’s mortified apology.
When they’re finished they walk back down the corridor. McGonagall has started the staff meeting already. The room is full of professors, some sitting around the communal table, others perched in the more comfortable armchairs that decorate the space. Harry’s at the table and there’s an open seat next to him with Draco’s bag on it. Harry’s biting his lip as he carefully writes out the dates McGonagall is reading out.
Draco doesn’t answer until he’s finished chewing. He never talks with his mouthful as he has pointedly explained to Harry many times. “Why?”
“Hmm,” he hummed when James and Albus were finished. He fished a box of biscuits out from under his desk and tossed them to the boys. “Save my waistline and waste the rest of these then will you?”
Harry’s not bothered, he sort of wants to see how Francis does. It looks like Marietta Clark has spotted Francis disobeying, her narrow-eyed focus has drifted over more than once, but so far she hasn’t said anything. And Harry’s not worried about his partner because Francis is duelling Guy Frank and Francis and Frankie have been joined at the hip since their first year so Harry knows Frankie can take it.
Potter doesn’t move, but he does playfully bite Draco’s shoulder through his robe. “You’re comfortable.”
Draco sets the pieces aside, pulling out the panties and kneels once more at Harry’s feet. One delicate hand grasps around Harry’s ankle and Harry lifts his feet on cue, first one, then the other. Draco rises to his knees, bringing the silky panties up Harry’s calves then his thighs. Harry’s erection has softened somewhat so that he is now only semi-hard, but Draco easily captures his cock in the soft material without ever brushing it with a bare hand. The elastic waistband feels tight against Harry’s belly and his cock feels almost too confined, but even he has to admit that the fabric does feel amazing. He’s not so sure about the way the thong splits his arse though, but since the sight of it makes even Draco forget himself and swallow heavily, Harry won’t complain.
His need to cum is near-instantaneous, so strong are the sensations. This is why he’s particularly surprised to see Potter walk away from him to clean his hands and roll down his cuffs.
Eddie’s a handsome man, but it’s Potter’s face Draco concentrates on as he starts thrusting his hips, sinking into the movement of the vibrator. There’s not much he can do besides wiggle and dance on his tiptoes, but he makes sure his body is writhing.
While Harry wasn’t sure what cosmopolitan actually meant, Matthew did turn out to be very attractive. And he was a grown up, two years older than him even, which Harry liked. They had a good conversation about trying to date younger men that had ended up being far more revealing than Harry had intended, but had been taken in good spirit.
Harry evades them to gasp as his cock is released and grinds against Draco’s trousers. “I’m soaking, Draco.”
There were few things that Harry missed about the Wizarding world, but one of them was most definitely Honeydukes chocolate. With his bags packed and shrunken in his magically expanding pockets (bigger on the inside thanks to Hermione), he decided to brave the Wizarding village before returning to his Muggle seclusion. There was nothing he could do about his glasses, but he tugged a knit hat (Weasley made) over his forehead, and turned his collar up around his face. He knew it was too much to hope to avoid recognition, but maybe if he was lucky…
Still, Draco hasn’t blinked. Harry’s sure he hasn’t missed it, but now he desperately wants to blink himself.
It’s not hard to chase the edge again. It’s been hoovering, Draco’s just been doing his damnedest to keep it at bay. But Potter wants to see him cum one more time so that’s what he does. It’s every bit as fantastically torturous as his other two orgasms. This time his cock barely twitches as he cums, he has so little left to give, but his whole body shakes with the sensation and he’s crying again without even realising it. But this time, thankfully, the moment he cums, the vibrator switches off and falls wetly from his body. His arsehole gapes around its loss, it feels numb, and he can still feel the phantom sensation of the vibrator deep inside.
“You’re going to cum just like this,” he says as he strokes himself. “And when that card in your mouth goes off you’re going to stick out your sore tongue and give me the best blowjob of your life, you understand?”
At Christmas, Marie invited Harry to another one of Lauren’s parties. He didn’t see Malfoy there, but had decided not to bring Matthew along, just in case. He had a lot more fun than he had the last time. His French was better, and he recognized more of the people from around the neighborhood, and he invited Kate and her husband Jon along to add more English speakers in case he got nervous (which he didn’t).
Aurora shakes her head. “You’ll get the balance soon. It sneaks up on the best of us and you’re still figuring it out.”
Malfoy groaned and pushed Harry through the threshold back into his apartment. Pickles made a yowling noise at the intrusion and scampered off. Malfoy kicked the door shut behind them and reached for Harry again. This time Harry skittered away, breathing heavily.
Eventually an older woman with blond hair piled atop her head caught Malfoy’s eye from the street and joined them at their table. She nodded at Harry and then started rattling off French at such a rapid rate that Harry felt his eyes glazing over. Malfoy kept up his side of the conversation easily enough, but eventually Harry grew bored and started playing with the sugar packets on the table.
He continued arguing with himself until he realized that he was peering into the bathroom mirror, actually trying to put some style into his hopeless hair. He was primping for Draco Malfoy.
There’s a smile on Draco’s face, but he still looks sad. “You think you do, but it won’t last. Not with who I am.” Draco shakes off Harry’s hand and lifts his arm, carefully unbuttoning his cuff and rolling back his sleeve.
Draco is, no surprise, a fantastic kisser, sucking on Harry’s bottom lip, slipping his tongue inside to massage Harry’s own. Harry groans into the kiss, opening his mouth further to let Draco in. He has an armful of a desperate wizard and now Harry sees what Draco meant about the handcuffs. An uninhibited Draco Malfoy is apparently touch hungry, his hands roving across Harry’s body, sneaking under the top of his collar and in between the buttons on his chest.
Malfoy huffed. “Yes, but he didn’t know that,” he said with a shake of his head in Harry’s direction.
Harry sighed and shook his head. “There’s no crocodile, sweetheart.” Once she scampered off to look at the flowers Harry shot Malfoy a dirty look. “Thanks. Now she’s going to have nightmares about being eaten by an crocodile.”
It’s so, so good, that first initial stretch, particularly after so long. Draco’s cockhead pushes him open and rests just inside. He takes him slowly, sinking slightly down and then back up in little motions as the feeling becomes more comfortable. It takes a long time for Harry’s arse to come to rest against Draco’s balls but when he does he throws back his head and lets out a long moan. He can feel a faint vibration through the base of Draco’s cock from the vibrator buried in his arse. Draco’s whole pelvis is trembling with the effects of it.
Draco becomes, if possible, even more, desperate now, and makes quick work of Harry’s belt buckle. Harry has to scramble to keep up but manages to divest Draco of his own trousers and pants by the time his own are falling around his ankles. They kick them aside, along with their socks and shoes, as Draco sucks another love bite into the skin under Harry’s chin and then they are pressing together, naked from head to toe.
The boy suckled and licked while Harry panted and pulled himself back under control. Then just as Harry was starting to feel overly sensitive the boy withdrew and settled back on his knees. His smile was positively smug. Clearly, he was aware of his own talents.
“Of course you did,” says Draco, who disappears for a moment, then returns with his glasses in hand. They must be scratched up because Draco gives them an episky before sliding them back onto Harry’s face.
The woman shot him a look and said something Harry didn’t understand. He gave her a sheepish smile in return.
Harry looked down at his plate to see that Draco’s somehow managed to steal half the piece in one bite. He shook his head in silent laughter, knocked the fork out of Draco’s hand, and entwined their fingers once more.
The sixth years still haven’t noticed them, they haven’t even put out a scout, the amateurs. They look closer to completing their plan though, they’re all looking into a bag of something that Rigby is holding up.
Out of the confines of his pants, Harry’s cock in Draco’s hand has room to grow, plumping and lengthening with the help of Draco’s careful stroking. He whispers a slickening spell into Harry’s ear and bites down on his lobe as his strokes suddenly smooth out. The wet slide is so much better that Harry can’t help but thrust up. “Tell me,” he demands.
So Harry spent several awkward moments standing at the till with Malfoy’s mother while she purchased the truffle medley and wrote out a short note to be attached after it was gift-wrapped.
Eventually Draco finishes his missive, flips on the wireless and stands behind Harry, resting his hands on his shoulders. Something light and classical bounces through the room as Draco runs a hand through Harry’s still-wet locks. He hums in a way Harry’s learned is contentment and picks up a brush.
Harry exchanged a look with Malfoy. They hadn’t delved too deeply into their recent pasts during their conversation on Montmartre. He wasn’t sure if Malfoy had been entirely honest when he’d set himself up here. Harry certainly wouldn’t blame him for pretending to be something, or someone he wasn’t.
Harry smiled and took a seat on what he considered to be his stool. “So, Draco,” he said. “Do you want to come to my birthday party next week?”
It turned out that Harry hadn’t gotten any better at parties since the last one he’d attended. After Lauren had gravitated towards the other guests, he tried to circulate with the people he had been assured spoke English, but he had never been very good at small talk. As a result he polished off the bottle of red he’d brought all on his own, and started in on the gin and tonics that the young red headed woman was pouring in the kitchen. He drank two and tried not to think of Ginny. He also took several trips to the toilet, waiting in a short queue each time.
“Alright, alright, is this what you want, you randy slut?” And then he presses the button at the bottom of the vibrator and the thing starts fucking him. Sliding in and out in a long smooth motion, battering his prostate with vibrations on every thrust.
“No. You got detention for being out after curfew and consorting with a man with an illegal dragon. I received a detention because your head of house had it out for Slytherin.”
“This isn’t the prettiest city I’ve been to. It isn’t the friendliest, or the most interesting, and I don’t speak the language so it’s certainly not the most inviting for a man like me. But when I got here, no one gave two shits about me at all. They had this gala in my honor, and half the invitees didn’t show. My liaison with the French Ministry hated me, and I’m pretty sure she was spitting in my coffee. And every time I showed up for work in the morning, security made me provide two forms of identification.”
Their coffee came, and this time Harry added liberal amounts of sugar, following Malfoy’s lead. It tasted much better that way.
Potter’s hard in his trousers, a side effect of the full body bind. It’s not the most pleasant feeling, Draco knows from experience. He’s not even sure Potter will be able to cum as it’s not a real erection. It is, however, hard enough for what he needs it for.
Harry pressed his eyes closed and forced himself to remain still. He wasn’t sure what he would do otherwise. Would he hold Malfoy closer or push him away?
There’s no way Potter can go any harder than he is, but it doesn’t matter because the robes against his cock feel so good as he jerks himself through the material, his tip catching once, then twice, then—
It also probably hadn’t helped that the cleaning spell Draco used on his robes had left a slight film and that they had needed to practically run to make it back to the Head Table on time for the Welcome Feast so he hadn’t had time to change. And probably Harry shouldn’t have asked Draco about the stain in front of the other professors and winked at the flimsy excuse of a misbehaving potion.
“I think you can wait,” he says against Draco’s lips. And then in parseltongue, he says; “Hey. Wake up.”
He wants to disagree, but Potter’s massaging his wet rim with the pad of his finger, not quite dipping in.
They compared notes about apples, and Malfoy gave Harry advice about the pâtés then they wandered over to the checkout counter.
A laugh was still on his lips when he looked across the room in search of the waiter with their wine. Instead his eyes lighted on a pale figure, sitting across the dining room, alone at a table set for two, staring back at him.
He can only hope that the sentiment is reciprocated. Because he might still be a bit of an awful teacher, but he was a good Auror and he is the Boy-Who-Lived, as cringe of a title as that is, for a reason. And there are things that only he, Harry Potter, is good at and that only he can do for Draco.
Draco, the utter shit, is smiling with his teeth showing, but he doesn’t even bother going for his wand when Harry sends an incarcerous his way.
“I like it,” says Harry, the rope running through his fingers like water as he pulls it through the knot. “Challenging, but relaxing.”
Lauren didn’t even respond to the question. “He has been coming around with Draco for a few years now. Never stays long. Never does any good.”
She frowns. “Don’t try and make me feel sorry for you, Harry Potter. We both know that’s not what’s going on and I’m worried about you. You’re constantly in the gossip rags, and with a different person every time. Don’t you ever have any second dates?”
Harry shivers, his cock twitches in his trousers though he’s not hard yet. If Draco keeps pressing soft kisses in that spot though, he will be soon.
His wand sails through the space between them and Draco snatches it out of the air with a look of triumph. The cheating little shit.
He tosses another fish into the air and ducks to avoid the water dripping over him from the tentacle that catches it.
“The furniture is mine,” Draco assures him. “I had the same thought. I moved everything over from the manor.”
“Because it would be rude,” the woman continued in English. Then she turned to Harry. “I’m sorry, but we haven’t been properly introduced, my name is Lauren Arret.”
“Some idiot hung him in the boy’s bathroom in Slytherin. Severus had him removed during my first year because he was perving on all the students in the showers.”
Potter’s office is a disaster. It’s no surprise since the man is supremely disorganised. Everything about him is a mess. His hair, his fashion sense, his work diary. Draco doesn’t usually come up here. Usually waits for Potter to corner him in some hidden corner, or to get desperate enough to come to his office.
“It wasn’t so bad really. He wasn’t ugly or anything, even though he was a lot older, and I had a lot of time to myself. And he helped me pay for L’Universite when I decided to enroll.”
Bars were easier than parties. At parties he felt the need to prove that he was a productive member of society, by making witty and hopefully intellectual conversational. At bars he only needed to prove he was interested in moving this to a secondary location.
Draco whimpers as a card goes off against his belly button, he tenses up so much that he swings a bit in his bondage. And despite it all, he’s relentlessly hard, cock leaking, pointing down to the bed beneath him, probably leaking shamelessly on the duvet.
Until meeting with Draco, Harry’s never thought he’s made a very convincing woman, or considered himself to be particularly feminine. But even he has to admit that he’s certainly passable. Draco, it seems, is an amazing stylist, and no one at the restaurant has glanced at Harry with anything other than appreciation.
The crushed lacewing flies fall into the cauldron and the potion ripples, turning darker just like it’s supposed to. Draco has to lean over the cauldron to monitor the progress. 30 seconds now, he taps his wand to reduce the heat.
The spell hits Draco’s right nipple first, then at his exuberant nod, Harry spells the left as well. Draco shouts then falls forward, and without his arms to catch him nearly winds up on his face. Harry grabs him by the shoulders just in time with a finite on his lips before Draco stops him.
The fire crabs are in a pen beside the Care of Magical Creatures shed. There’s five of them and when they spot Harry with the bucket of food they waddle over, farting out flames in their excitement.
He probes between his own cheeks, two fingers seeking out and easily sinking into his open wet hole. He hisses as he fingers himself, already ready for more, though he is admittedly tender. It’s been a while and the stretching spell isn’t the gentlest way to prep.
Draco shakes his head and squeezes his wrist through his shirt. Potter’s eyes follow, he knows what's there. “Not unsure,” he says. “I just— don’t want to disappoint you.”
As if sensing his discomfort Potter gives him a sidelong glance, eyes roving briefly up and down his body before winking. The prick.
Draco snorts. “Not too different from Potions is it? And I can do that with your cock up my arse if you’d care to remember. I’m sure I could learn.”
He won’t let Draco thrust up, keeps one hand pressed against his hip to keep him still, but Draco only needs to lay back and take it because Potter is capable of fucking his face with Draco’s cock all on his own.
Harry almost asks ‘what do you want?’ but he isn’t sure he’s ready for the answer. Instead he licks Draco’s neck and makes quick work on the buttons of his finely-pressed shirt.
Draco just shrugs with a slight dip of his shoulders. “Had time to nip into Dervish and Banges. Bought myself these.” He shows Harry the inside of his slim box where a pair of soft black gloves rest. They look soft and lush, and Harry can’t help but think they’d make a much nicer present on a cold autumn afternoon than a necklace. He shuts the lid quickly and tucks the box back into his robes.
After a month Harry realized that he apparently enjoyed living like a barnyard animal. It felt as if he was living life to his own design for once.
Draco considers the proposal over his tea. He’s been avoiding taking that step not because he doesn’t want it, but because he might want it too much. Potter’s already crawling into every aspect of his daily life, if starts claiming his nights too it’s going to hurt all the more when it’s gone. He still doesn’t quite believe it when Potter says he wants to be with him of all people. It’s probably just proximity speaking. There aren’t exactly any other horny gay teachers in rural Scotland to shack up with.
Harry’s cock is sensitive, but still twitching, and Draco is so hot he could probably get it up for another round, but not quite yet. “Be gentle,” he warns.
After following the hosepipe to the connector and making sure the water was off Harry hurried to follow him.
Draco keens as his cock drools against his stomach, he wants Potter’s attention back on him again. Why is he digging through his drawer now? It’s hard to focus while he’s so close to the edge, but the fog clears for a moment if only because he’s so damned confused because Potter is hanging up a piece of cloth from the rod behind his desk. It unfurls like a banner directly in front of Draco, brushing against his front, and it would block him from sight from head to toe if Draco couldn’t for some reason see through the damn thing. Why is it sheer? Is it some kind of hammock or new bondage?
Malfoy, ignored the complaint and ordered two. Presumably one of them was for Harry, but it was never clarified.
“If it’s your cock it will cancel once you ejaculate. It’s a fertility spell, don’t you know. For all the homosexual pureblood types who end up with the likes of me instead of their pretty wives. If you’ve spelled anything else you’ll need to cancel it manually.”
One of the first things Harry discovered about the grown-up Draco Malfoy was that he works very hard to make sure all of his students trust him and feel safe around him. Both the name Malfoy and the Potions Master of Hogwarts title carry too much weight to not be cautious and shouting at Harry Potter over breakfast probably won’t help his image with the newest Hogwarts students.
“You want all these?” Neville asks. There’s about ten stacked in a haphazard pile, leaning against a tall mirror.
This year they’d taken up the whole of the tiny restaurant. His kids had a table to themselves where Lily was making faces to entertain Kate and Jon’s giggling daughter. Marie had brought along her new beau, an English man by the name of Gerald. She’d thanked Harry profusely for all of the English lessons since otherwise, she said, she never would have understood that Gerald was trying to ask her out. Craig and Pierre arrived accompanied by Charles the teacup poodle or as Pierre put it ‘Their darling baby boy.’ Lauren had arrived with a number of other acquaintances Harry had made at her numerous parties, and Harry’s partner Adrian had joined in and brought a majority of their department. Of course the magical folks were all dressed so ridiculously that Harry had needed to explain away their wardrobes in an attempt at fancy dress.
Harry turns and catches him looking again, eyes resting for a beat too long on his chest to be casual. Draco catches Harry catching him and flushes but otherwise looks unaffected. His mask, so carefully undone in private, is ironclad in front of the children.
“You need to get your cock sucked, Potter,” Malfoy started off as he took a deep sip from his takeaway coffee.
“I love those little noises you make for me,” says Potter, thrusting again to make Draco whimper. “You’re opening up so well. Just look at you.”
“Are you going to invite your friend to the party tomorrow night, Draco?” she asked once she was sure she had their attention.
It’s still Draco and Harry, but now they’re sitting together in a crowded pub, surrounded by their friends and family and Harry’s arm is wrapped firmly around his shoulders, Draco’s hand resting on his leg. No one is looking at them, no one cares, even when Harry and Draco lean into each other for a brief kiss.
“Mmm, love it when you go traditional,” says Potter, and his voice is muffled because he’s under Draco’s robe.
True. “Well, someone had to say the spell to pull the beads out at the right time, my hands were a little busy.” Also, he liked the audience.
“Malfoy,” Harry sighed, somehow he felt like a monster and he wasn’t entirely sure what he’d done wrong.
He needed time to think about that. Later though, when Malfoy wasn’t looking at him as it was somehow his fault.
Draco’s heart gives a little lurch, it doesn’t much like the idea of having its secrets stripped bare. “Can you see what I see?” he asks.
It makes him cry again, or maybe he hadn’t properly stopped. The tears leak from his eye, so he wipes them against Potter’s shirt. He’s a mess both emotionally and physically, so fucked out that he doesn’t think he’s going to want sex for at least a week. All he wants to do is curl closer to Potter and be taken care of. A cloth settles across his shoulders, covering up his shivering body. He looks down and twitches at what he doesn’t see.
The heat on his cheeks does something for Harry. He didn’t figure it out until after the first time they fucked, but Draco goes just as pink when he’s angry as he does when he’s turned on. It’s fantastic.
